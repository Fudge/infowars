[00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:00.537]  Network.
[00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:08.443]  Big Brother.
[00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:10.164]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.965]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.446]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.108]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:19.410]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:34.836]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:38.999]  It is Thursday, the 23rd day of June 2005.
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.882]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:44.924]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:51.730]  This broadcast is dedicated to property rights, the Second Amendment, controlling our borders.
[00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.773]  We are strongly opposed to abortion and pro-life.
[00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:59.115]  We are against the United Nations and UNESCO.
[00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:05.281]  We are against genetically engineered cross-species, trans-species food.
[00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:11.367]  We are against the deadly dangerous, demonstrably dangerous, vaccines.
[00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:18.795]  We are against the police state and the militarization of our police and the high-tech control grid that is going into place.
[00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:24.518]  Cities may seize homes for economic development.
[00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:25.779]  Court rules.
[00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.160]  This just came out this morning.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.365]  The Supreme Court ruled today that local governments may seize people's homes and businesses even against their will for private economic development.
[00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:44.930]  Not for highways, not for reservoirs, not for city council buildings,
[00:01:46.483 --> 00:02:01.711]  Now, in one case in Connecticut, beautiful old homes on a lake and a river, and the developers want that land, and they're, by the way, offering the people much less than it's actually worth, and they're going to take it and bulldoze it.
[00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.452]  No one is safe.
[00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:08.934]  The politicians are paid off by the realtors, and they come and take your property.
[00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:13.957]  By the way, four years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Reno, Nevada,
[00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:21.995]  They're by the lake that people can have their property taken by the government without just compensation.
[00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:33.320]  So we have them saying, no just compensation, and now they're saying, hey, it isn't just for public works, you know, for a highway that's coming through, which you can argue is acceptable.
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.421]  No, now it is for everything.
[00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:42.564]  And we have a guest joining us to cover this subject in about 30 minutes.
[00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.790]  Of exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds.
[00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.312]  House OK's ban on flag burning.
[00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:57.155]  So they'll pass a constitutional amendment or pass the beginning of the process for a constitutional amendment.
[00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:02.457]  So you can't burn the flag, which I don't like burning the flag.
[00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:03.118]  I love the flag.
[00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:05.499]  It symbolizes the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.261]  Meanwhile, what the flag stands for is being burned.
[00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:19.764]  So, form over substance, yet again, as they butcher property rights even further.
[00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:21.506]  This is a big ruling, folks.
[00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.848]  This Connecticut case has been highly watched.
[00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.192]  Chinese oil company offers $18.5 billion for Unicole.
[00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:37.178]  And they're also offering money for one of the last American makers of appliances, Maytag.
[00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:42.815]  Pentagon sued by its own soldier for being beaten and basically tortured.
[00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:45.537]  Yeah, they even beat and tortured their own people there.
[00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.478]  It's so fun.
[00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:48.619]  It's so great.
[00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.565]  And now, now the United Nations is weighing in, trying to make themselves look good by criticizing the U.S.
[00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:59.287]  and it'll all be more good cop, bad cop, and, oh, you must be for the U.N.
[00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:00.268]  if you're against torture.
[00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.050]  It's amazing.
[00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:03.631]  Also,
[00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:05.449]  U.S.
[00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:18.592]  poised to rule on livestock, cloned livestock, and experts are saying looks like the court is going to rule that cloned meat, cloned milk from farm animals can be put on the market.
[00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:23.513]  This is getting more and more out of control.
[00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:26.614]  Karl Rove criticizes liberals on 9-11.
[00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:31.295]  More on martial law.
[00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:33.837]  They're trying to declare martial law in Richmond, Virginia.
[00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:35.799]  That's out of the Associated Press.
[00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:37.640]  So much today.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.123]  The key issues that really affect you and your family.
[00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:42.724]  Real talk radio.
[00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:46.187]  Real issues that actually affect the society.
[00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:50.230]  Straight ahead on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:52.192]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:07.377]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:07.597 --> 00:05:09.178]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:14.221]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.963]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:23.546]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:26.607]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:31.369]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.990]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.432]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:46.113]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:14.348]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:22.113]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.495]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:31.498]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:37.961]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:42.203]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:42.243 --> 00:06:44.124]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:44.324 --> 00:06:50.267]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:54.449]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:55.030]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:11.213]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:17.159]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:27.568]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:30.110]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.513]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:35.114]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:38.116]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:42.740]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.701]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:07:45.062 --> 00:07:56.371]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:01.673]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:08:03.454 --> 00:08:05.656]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:09.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.346]  Eight minutes, twenty seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:27.887]  Let's plunge straight into the news.
[00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:29.427]  Cities!
[00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:31.088]  Cities, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:31.968 --> 00:08:40.491]  These little corporations that private individuals can just set up may seize homes for economic development, court rules for private ventures.
[00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:48.154]  And that means the real estate councils go and lobby to steal your property to build whatever they want on it, including homes.
[00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:53.116]  Big K's up in Connecticut been watched very closely in the last two years.
[00:08:54.125 --> 00:09:07.428]  And the Supreme Court, four years ago, in the case of land around the big lake up there in Reno, Nevada, they ruled no just compensation, that the government can take your land and not pay you.
[00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:14.730]  I mean, this is, there is nothing in America that is so great a cornerstone as private property.
[00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.331]  I mean, it is the absolute, total bedrock.
[00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:30.929]  And then it's free speech, and then the right to defend yourself, the Second Amendment, and the right to not be illegally searched and seized, Fourth Amendment, and not to incriminate yourself, innocent until proven guilty.
[00:09:32.129 --> 00:09:38.492]  These are the basic canons of a free society, and they're all being dismantled.
[00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.552]  Not piecemeal, but in giant chunks.
[00:09:42.612 --> 00:09:50.456]  It's like a great white, 30-foot great white shark in America is a fur seal, and they've literally bitten this country in half.
[00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:53.797]  Before, they were just eating around the edges.
[00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:58.840]  Cities may seize homes for economic development court rules.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:08.725]  This is out of the Associated Press, the Supreme Court ruled today that local government may seize people's homes and businesses even against their will for private economic development.
[00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:21.287]  It was a decision fraught with huge implications for a country with many areas, particularly the rapidly growing urban and suburban areas, facing countervailing pressures of development and property ownership rights.
[00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:30.676]  The 5-4 ruling represented a defeat for some Connecticut residents whose homes are slated for destruction to make room for an office complex and private homes, I would add.
[00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:39.680]  They argue that the cities have no right to take their land except for projects with a clear public use such as roads and schools or to revitalize blighted areas.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:48.904]  As a result, cities now have wide power to bulldoze residences for projects such as shopping malls, hotel complexes, in order to generate tax revenue.
[00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:49.664]  Let's stop right there.
[00:10:52.768 --> 00:11:01.813]  In Connecticut, this particular Real Estate Council came in, because this has been covered ad nauseam on this broadcast in the last two years, and all over the place.
[00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:08.637]  I mean, even people like Neil Bortz, who I normally disagree with, as he's a neocon, is spot on when it comes to land grabbing.
[00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:10.298]  And he's really covered this.
[00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:12.739]  I listen to him routinely when I'm driving around at night.
[00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.900]  They re-air him here in Austin.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.541]  And he's had all the guests on.
[00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:17.782]  And so, you know, I know about this case.
[00:11:17.842 --> 00:11:19.083]  It's like a soap opera.
[00:11:19.123 --> 00:11:22.525]  For two years, I've been interviewing people and listening to folks interview.
[00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:24.226]  I mean, it is so horrible.
[00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:28.969]  These are beautiful, Victorian-style homes, right there on the water.
[00:11:29.409 --> 00:11:34.633]  And they are going to bulldoze hundreds, and they're talking about thousands, just a whole neighborhood.
[00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.214]  A hundred-year-old neighborhood.
[00:11:36.694 --> 00:11:37.394]  Tear it out.
[00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:38.415]  Middle-class neighborhood.
[00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:45.237]  And build luxury homes, luxury high-rise condos, luxury office buildings.
[00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:57.960]  And folks, all the Real Estate Council's got to do is come pay off your politicians, and then the politicians will pay out the money to steal the land, and then basically give it to these corporations.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.021]  We saw this through the environmental guise of smart growth.
[00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:07.963]  I went to a smart growth conference in 1998 here in Austin, shot video of it, put it on the TV show.
[00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:13.495]  I'm thinking about putting it in a new documentary and going back and doing a film on property rights.
[00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:15.936]  Because it's so important.
[00:12:16.356 --> 00:12:19.817]  And I go to the Smart Growth Conference and there's like three or four thousand people there.
[00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:21.818]  There's the heads of major banks.
[00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:23.359]  I mean, big national banks.
[00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:25.460]  I don't mean just their vice presidents.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.780]  I mean the CEOs.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.701]  There's Michael Dell.
[00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:31.822]  There's Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club.
[00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:33.283]  And I'm sitting there.
[00:12:33.323 --> 00:12:34.403]  It was a three-day conference.
[00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:35.844]  I was only there for about five hours.
[00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:41.161]  And I interviewed Michael Dell in press conferences, and that got written up in the paper.
[00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:46.704]  How he confronted me, but... I'm sitting there, and they're all literally laughing!
[00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:50.066]  They had a former Dallas Cowboy, who's a big developer up there.
[00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:52.248]  I tried to talk to him, he got in my face.
[00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:53.629]  Very aggressive!
[00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.151]  And they're up there laughing!
[00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:07.138]  Yes, we're gonna take all the property, and then we're going to decide the use of it, and then the development will be given over to the banks, and then that'll be selectively handed out to the different real estate moguls.
[00:13:08.716 --> 00:13:25.423]  And they got past the SOS expansion and took about 20,000 acres, took hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, and basically everything in southwest Austin and south of Austin was laid off limits.
[00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:28.104]  Totally laid off limits.
[00:13:28.977 --> 00:13:44.844]  And then we have read documents of what they've done in other areas of the country, three or four years later when people forget about it, they then take the restrictions off, and the city, for literal pennies on the dollar, sells it to select big developers.
[00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:49.246]  So it's crony capitalism, or it's mercantilism.
[00:13:49.526 --> 00:13:51.507]  It's not free market, it's managed.
[00:13:51.847 --> 00:13:56.709]  Kind of like the oligarchs in Russia today, or what Hitler did, or what Mussolini did.
[00:13:58.897 --> 00:14:03.020]  They basically control the country, but then hand it off to their private interest.
[00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:06.162]  And here are the poor environmentalists.
[00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:11.486]  They send out squadrons for as long as I've lived in Austin.
[00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:13.228]  15 years.
[00:14:14.368 --> 00:14:18.912]  I mean, I remember so many times living in my parents' home, or then in my own apartment, or in my home today.
[00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.125]  Nice young lady, nice young man, 18, 20 years old.
[00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:23.886]  Hi!
[00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:25.147]  And they're sincere.
[00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:26.267]  Best type of salesperson.
[00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:27.749]  Listen, they're destroying the water.
[00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:30.531]  They're destroying the golden cheek warbler, the salamander.
[00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.633]  Please give me $100 for Save Our Springs.
[00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.995]  Please, so we can stop development.
[00:14:36.055 --> 00:14:36.936]  It's so horrible.
[00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:37.316]  Please.
[00:14:37.957 --> 00:14:39.518]  And I'd say, no, no.
[00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:43.020]  I'd watch my mother write a big fat check, but I figured it out.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.222]  And, you know, later in my own home, wouldn't give them money.
[00:14:45.242 --> 00:14:45.983]  And they'd get mad.
[00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:46.984]  They'd say, how dare you?
[00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:48.585]  You know, very self-righteous.
[00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:53.032]  And then I'd watch them go to neighbors' houses and get checks!
[00:14:55.674 --> 00:14:56.875]  And so it's big business.
[00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.017]  So they have all these useful idiots working for them.
[00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:04.382]  And now, seven years later, man, they're building hotels.
[00:15:04.422 --> 00:15:06.784]  They're building five-star golf courses.
[00:15:07.104 --> 00:15:08.766]  They're building luxury homes.
[00:15:09.286 --> 00:15:10.887]  They're building all over it!
[00:15:12.929 --> 00:15:15.231]  But you've got to be one of those select developers.
[00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:15.992]  You go to the city,
[00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:22.373]  And you say, uh, we'd like to buy this land from you, city, or other people refuse to sell.
[00:15:22.433 --> 00:15:24.595]  They may have laid 20,000 acres off limits and bought it.
[00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:30.579]  There is, you know, many times that in people's land, where they just say, okay, you can't build on it anything.
[00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:37.104]  Well, I bought it when it was zoned for full construction, or for homes, or for, sorry, you can't build anything.
[00:15:38.644 --> 00:15:42.125]  And then you can sue them, and they'll go, okay, you can build on 5% of it.
[00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:44.886]  Well, I own a two lot parcel.
[00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:46.927]  I couldn't even build an outhouse on it.
[00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.628]  I mean, you know, well, sorry.
[00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:54.589]  You can sell to Billy Bob, the developer, and the developer will go, sorry, it's not worth anything.
[00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:57.030]  I'll pay you five cents on the dollar for your ranch.
[00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:06.453]  They sell it, and three years later, the restrictions are off, and there are giant, $500,000 a piece, million dollar, million and a half dollar homes.
[00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:15.938]  This is what we're dealing with, and now they don't even need the environmental fraud to get your land.
[00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:18.280]  Now they'll just say, we're taking it.
[00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:20.341]  We're taking it.
[00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:28.247]  Oh, by the way, beautiful place called Reimer's Ranch where I'd go rock climbing or go camping back when I had time to do such things ten years ago.
[00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:32.593]  I'd still go out to Reimer's Ranch out in the German Hill Country maybe once a year.
[00:16:32.953 --> 00:16:34.454]  Do some fishing there on the river.
[00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:39.916]  It's beautiful cliffs and gnarled oak trees.
[00:16:40.977 --> 00:16:45.840]  Well, they convinced the old guy to sell it to the state through a private consortium.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.820]  And guess what?
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.222]  After they got the land, oh, we're going to build houses on it!
[00:16:51.603 --> 00:16:53.383]  The environmental group's going to build houses on it.
[00:16:55.124 --> 00:16:55.324]  Ha!
[00:16:55.545 --> 00:16:55.725]  Ha!
[00:16:55.965 --> 00:16:56.065]  Ha!
[00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:02.139]  Oh man, it just gets richer and richer and richer.
[00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:05.560]  And of course, old Reimer didn't intend for that to happen.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.820]  I read he was a little bit upset now.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.361]  That guy was a really nice fellow up there.
[00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:12.721]  Chewing his tobacco when you pull up.
[00:17:13.181 --> 00:17:14.581]  Got his goats out front of his house.
[00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.842]  Oh man, these people are out of control.
[00:17:18.282 --> 00:17:19.202]  Such a scam.
[00:17:19.242 --> 00:17:19.803]  And you know what?
[00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:22.143]  It won't stop these zit-faced kids from coming to your door.
[00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:25.330]  Every month on the month, give me money, give me money.
[00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.954]  And you try to tell them it's a scam, they just drool at you.
[00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:32.638]  That's not true, actually a lot of them are waking up.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.401]  Amazing!
[00:17:36.983 --> 00:17:42.309]  So this morning I've been working on getting some guests on, and we do have some coming up on this subject.
[00:17:43.894 --> 00:17:44.634]  But that's okay.
[00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:47.995]  Forget it if they're now saying for houses they can take your property.
[00:17:48.515 --> 00:17:49.315]  Because of real estate.
[00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:51.296]  Oh, by the way, it's the Real Estate Council in Austin.
[00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:53.836]  They were also there at the Smart Growth Conference.
[00:17:53.856 --> 00:17:54.297]  They love it.
[00:17:55.037 --> 00:17:57.857]  It's the Land Grabbing Conference and Control Conference.
[00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:04.219]  They're also behind pushing for the massive toll roads on almost every major road in Austin.
[00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:06.259]  And it's the same all over the state.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.760]  Because they're going to control where the roads go.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.420]  They're going to control.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.781]  They already bought the land up five, ten years ago when these decisions were made.
[00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.052]  It is such a unholy scam.
[00:18:17.812 --> 00:18:19.112]  And of course, it's like everything else.
[00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:21.093]  Every realtor I've talked to is against it.
[00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:27.116]  Every realtor I've talked to knows it's driving down property values in the areas where these toll roads are going to block off populations.
[00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:31.538]  In studies they've done, the vast majority of realtors are against it.
[00:18:31.598 --> 00:18:32.578]  It's the council.
[00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.079]  It's the elitist, because they're going to control it.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.380]  I'm sick of it.
[00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.646]  Makes me very angry, and none of us are safe.
[00:18:44.607 --> 00:18:50.770]  You know, right behind my house, they are now annihilating the Greenbelt.
[00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:58.593]  There are eight bulldozers out back my house, just knocking down giant oak trees everywhere, about to build some gigantic monstrosity.
[00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.435]  And under SOS, that's not supposed to be happening.
[00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:05.957]  Oh no, this land won't be built on.
[00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:07.433]  We promise you.
[00:19:07.453 --> 00:19:11.275]  And right now there's bulldozers, just right now, crashing into oak trees.
[00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:14.136]  And again, I'm not one of these so-called environmentalists.
[00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:14.836]  Don't call me that.
[00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:16.177]  I'm a conservationist.
[00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:19.158]  I'm somebody who really does love the environment.
[00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:21.279]  I believe you should be able to sell your private property if you want to.
[00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:25.421]  And by having land holding being diversified, you will protect the land.
[00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:28.322]  Not by having the corporations do whatever they want.
[00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:33.084]  So, uh, unbelievable.
[00:19:33.304 --> 00:19:36.145]  I know so many ranchers, so many people that lost their land.
[00:19:37.148 --> 00:19:38.309]  Because you're selling it to us.
[00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:43.072]  First they take, first they, in many cases, first they say there's a land use restriction.
[00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:45.574]  Then they get the property.
[00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:48.556]  Then the property value drops.
[00:19:48.797 --> 00:19:49.757]  Then they offer to buy it.
[00:19:50.098 --> 00:19:51.599]  Then they buy it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:53.360]  I forgot that part of the equation.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.722]  Then they take the restrictions off and sell it to their buddies.
[00:19:56.883 --> 00:19:57.863]  At a discount, of course.
[00:19:57.903 --> 00:19:58.364]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:05.427]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:20:05.707 --> 00:20:10.312]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:10.632 --> 00:20:12.975]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:14.736]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:20.262]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:21.744]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:20:21.784 --> 00:20:24.487]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:21:04.924 --> 00:21:05.965]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:06.285 --> 00:21:09.068]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:13.492]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:14.733]  So what do you do?
[00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:19.658]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:20.138 --> 00:21:22.260]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:23.622]  Sheltering in place.
[00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:37.430]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:44.535]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:22:03.517 --> 00:22:05.959]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:10.322]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:14.845]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:22:15.525 --> 00:22:24.131]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:22:25.092 --> 00:22:32.237]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:41.314]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:44.914]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:45.735]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:45.995]  Call now.
[00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:49.796]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:05.305]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:09.408]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:09.728 --> 00:23:10.529]  Read the labels.
[00:23:10.969 --> 00:23:15.091]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:19.494]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:19.874 --> 00:23:24.757]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:28.720]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:34.244]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:34.524 --> 00:23:37.266]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:37.547 --> 00:23:38.447]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:59.761]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:24:10.727 --> 00:24:12.868]  Things really are accelerating.
[00:24:13.428 --> 00:24:19.251]  I mean, the amount of open New World Order activity that I see in a single day
[00:24:20.254 --> 00:24:26.137]  Is more than we would see ten years ago in an entire six-month, maybe a year-long period.
[00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:30.419]  I mean, the stack of news I've got today is just massive.
[00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:37.802]  But continuing with this AP article about the Supreme Court ruling, 5-4 ruling, represented a defeat for homeowners.
[00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:47.727]  As a result, cities now have water power to bulldoze residences for other residences, for hotels, for shopping malls, for other projects, not just highways.
[00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:52.368]  As a result, this is really going to hurt property rights.
[00:24:52.428 --> 00:24:54.208]  Local officials, not federal judges.
[00:24:54.228 --> 00:24:55.469]  This is from the Associated Press.
[00:24:55.989 --> 00:25:02.631]  Local officials, not federal judges, know best in deciding whether a development project will benefit the community.
[00:25:03.071 --> 00:25:04.011]  Justice is said.
[00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:15.274]  So, oh, the local people put into office by the bankers and put into office by all these other control freaks, they know best.
[00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:16.114]  They'll decide.
[00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:31.412]  The city has carefully formulated an economic development that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but by no means limited to, new jobs, increased tax revenue, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority.
[00:25:31.553 --> 00:25:37.937]  He was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer.
[00:25:38.712 --> 00:25:41.835]  And of course, seven of the nine were appointed by Republicans.
[00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:43.056]  This is your conservative court.
[00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:50.482]  At issue was the scope of the Fifth Amendment, which allows governments to take private property through eminent domain if the land is for public use.
[00:25:50.522 --> 00:26:05.554]  And again, four years ago they ruled, in a case in Nevada, up by Reno, by a lake, that they don't have to give just compensation for government intimate domain, so I wonder how they'll mesh these two nightmare rulings together.
[00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:12.569]  And this area up in Connecticut is just a beautiful area.
[00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:14.290]  I've seen photographs of it.
[00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.890]  Beautiful hundred-year-old homes.
[00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.970]  Middle class.
[00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:22.491]  And the people unanimously do not want it.
[00:26:22.531 --> 00:26:27.232]  It is a huge neighborhood along a large body of water and it is gone.
[00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.213]  The bulldozers are a coming.
[00:26:31.207 --> 00:26:38.092]  And there's a whole other area of debate where it shows that clearly they're not giving them what the homes are worth.
[00:26:40.193 --> 00:26:44.676]  But again, the same corrupt city is going to decide what people are going to be paid.
[00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:51.300]  And with this federal ruling that they don't have to pay you anything... Look out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.685]  I mean, this is diametrically, 180 degrees against what this country is supposed to be.
[00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.571]  How this country is supposed to operate.
[00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:03.953]  We got a guest coming up in a few minutes to talk about it.
[00:27:04.513 --> 00:27:05.194]  House O.K.'
[00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:16.361]  's ban on flag burning, though, the flag symbolizes the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, America, the veterans that have fought and died for this country.
[00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:22.645]  The flag itself is not those rights, and I do not like people that burn the American flag.
[00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.606]  Most of them are misguided idiots.
[00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.451]  I do not appreciate it.
[00:27:28.912 --> 00:27:30.773]  But, I'm not an emotional idiot.
[00:27:31.454 --> 00:27:35.597]  And I will fight for their right to burn that flag.
[00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:41.181]  I will fight for their right to do it because it's under the First Amendment.
[00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:53.711]  And when you arrest somebody for burning that flag, ladies and gentlemen, what you are in a sense doing is burning the First Amendment.
[00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:56.393]  You're actually burning the soul of that flag.
[00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:58.824]  And I hope people understand that.
[00:27:58.864 --> 00:28:03.326]  So here they are giving you non-existent petty rights, which actually restrict your rights.
[00:28:04.607 --> 00:28:17.013]  The House yesterday approved a constitutional amendment that would give Congress the power to ban desecration of the American flag, a measure rejected twice by the Senate in the past decade, but expected to get closer vote this year.
[00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:28.148]  By 286 to 130, House members approved the amendment after a debate over whether such a ban would run afoul of the Constitution's free speech protections.
[00:28:28.388 --> 00:28:40.035]  And if this then passes the Senate, it will go to the states and they could easily try to tack other amendments on and try to change the 22nd Amendment.
[00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:41.375]  A bill is introduced to do that.
[00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:47.339]  So Bill Clinton or George Bush or Hillary or Arnold can run for more than two consecutive terms.
[00:28:48.982 --> 00:28:56.609]  They've got bills in there to change Article 2, Clause 3, so Schwarzenegger... Article 2, Clause 5, excuse me.
[00:28:57.189 --> 00:28:59.231]  So Schwarzenegger can run for President?
[00:29:00.793 --> 00:29:02.534]  Very, very serious.
[00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:05.717]  Very, very dangerous.
[00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:11.883]  And of course, in January, the Congress voted to basically give up their authority to the executive branch.
[00:29:12.323 --> 00:29:14.225]  What was called the Doomsday Bill.
[00:29:16.132 --> 00:29:20.673]  And we have Tommy Franks and others talking about martial law after another terror attack.
[00:29:21.154 --> 00:29:26.655]  And in Richmond, Virginia, they're trying to declare martial law because there's been less shootings this year than last year.
[00:29:27.856 --> 00:29:28.836]  At the six-month mark.
[00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:30.656]  They don't care.
[00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:32.357]  They're calling it an emergency.
[00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:38.059]  So everywhere, we hear these terms.
[00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:42.040]  Everywhere we see martial law, the term martial law being used.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.141]  Federalization of major cities.
[00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:47.339]  We'll be right back with our guests.
[00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:50.363]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net are the websites.
[00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:51.043]  Check them out.
[00:29:53.846 --> 00:29:54.767]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.248 --> 00:29:56.850]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.771 --> 00:30:00.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.493 --> 00:30:05.454]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:16.258]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:30:16.638 --> 00:30:21.160]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:32.564]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:30:33.144 --> 00:30:40.012]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:30:40.392 --> 00:30:42.534]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:30:43.035 --> 00:30:48.000]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:33:08.375 --> 00:33:10.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:13.597]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:33:16.198 --> 00:33:22.661]  Coming up in a few minutes, Carol W. LaGrasse, President of Property Rights Foundation of America.
[00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:27.803]  Talk about cities may cease homes, or Economic Development Court says.
[00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:33.812]  Also, Chinese company about to buy Unicold for $18.5 billion.
[00:33:33.832 --> 00:33:40.253]  They're also on the verge of buying Maytag, another American corporation, one of our few manufacturers left.
[00:33:41.194 --> 00:33:42.594]  This is getting worse and worse.
[00:33:42.974 --> 00:33:45.155]  UN uncovers torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:47.935]  That way, if you're against torture, you're for the UN.
[00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:49.255]  This is more propaganda.
[00:33:50.076 --> 00:33:56.217]  Meanwhile, an army soldier suing over the fact that he was beaten up while taking part in drills at the camp.
[00:33:57.648 --> 00:33:58.669]  So they got big problems.
[00:33:58.689 --> 00:34:00.810]  There is just so much news coming up today.
[00:34:01.771 --> 00:34:10.778]  Before we go to Carol W. LaGrasse, I'm going to have one more showing of my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:16.902]  Next Monday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:20.505]  One last showing.
[00:34:21.546 --> 00:34:24.168]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, 8 o'clock next Monday.
[00:34:24.853 --> 00:34:28.135]  And these babies have always sold out before the night of the event.
[00:34:28.735 --> 00:34:36.179]  So I suggest you go to Infowars.com, link through via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart over to the Alamo Draft House and get your tickets online.
[00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.361]  Or if you live in Austin, Texas, they're selling them at the door right now.
[00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:40.962]  Pull through and get tickets for yourself.
[00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:45.725]  And the misses are for you and your hubby, or for you and your grandma, or for you and your children.
[00:34:46.225 --> 00:34:46.685]  Whatever.
[00:34:46.745 --> 00:34:48.026]  It's a family event.
[00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:57.160]  A lot of people will be there, a lot of great folks, a lot of like-minded people, so I can't wait to see you there next Monday.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.623]  Of course, we're having the fifth event tonight, which was sold out in the middle of last week.
[00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:11.749]  If you want to get a hard copy of Martial Law, the toll-free number to order it is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:20.003]  It covers the latest police state developments.
[00:35:20.103 --> 00:35:23.366]  It covers what really happened on 9-11 and who these globalists are.
[00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:32.755]  Three hours long, I also have 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design, Matrix of Evil, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:35:33.433 --> 00:35:39.856]  We got discounts on some of the films as low as 25% of the regular price.
[00:35:39.896 --> 00:35:42.577]  You know, a 25.95 DVD is 5.95.
[00:35:42.837 --> 00:35:45.678]  When you buy one copy of American Dictators, the second copy is 5.95.
[00:35:46.058 --> 00:35:48.059]  I just want to get these out to people.
[00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.840]  Or buy one copy and make copies.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.300]  It's having such a big effect.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:52.381]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:05.772]  Before we go to our guest, I have one more comment I'm going to make, and it's going to be short and sweet.
[00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:30.326]  I got calls this morning, I was up at 7 o'clock trying to set guests up concerning this seizure of private property all over the country that's going on, the Supreme Court ruling, and then at about 9 o'clock I'm in the shower, and I get a call, hey, tune into this, tune into local radio station, and right as I tune in, somebody's saying, I kill people!
[00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:36.748]  I'll come down to Austin and I'll, you know, and I'm hearing this and I'm going, my God, what in the world?
[00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:43.594]  And the last ten times or so I've been death-threatened, I've filed complaints with the police.
[00:36:44.775 --> 00:36:45.916]  One time something happened.
[00:36:47.498 --> 00:36:56.006]  When we got a threat against the President on this show via email, it had headers to a hundred people, or like 75 people the person sent it to.
[00:36:57.273 --> 00:36:57.753]  Didn't matter.
[00:36:57.833 --> 00:36:58.773]  I thought it was a setup.
[00:36:58.913 --> 00:37:00.014]  I called the Secret Service.
[00:37:00.034 --> 00:37:01.554]  The person was arrested in Tennessee.
[00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:02.994]  It was all over Tennessee newspapers.
[00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:06.295]  So, uh, you... We know who you are.
[00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:12.176]  And, uh, when I get off the air here today, I don't have time to be doing this, but I'm gonna go file a police report.
[00:37:13.316 --> 00:37:15.977]  And I'm gonna do one over the phone, uh, in Arkansas.
[00:37:18.017 --> 00:37:23.338]  And, uh, you know, uh, sitting there saying that if people don't do what you want, you know, you kill people.
[00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:25.839]  And you're gonna be coming down to our front doors.
[00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:26.239]  Well,
[00:37:27.253 --> 00:37:28.594]  Again, we don't put up with that.
[00:37:28.634 --> 00:37:30.295]  You wanted to get my attention, you got it.
[00:37:31.356 --> 00:37:34.137]  If people want to declare war on us, we will defend ourselves.
[00:37:34.177 --> 00:37:39.220]  You know, it's like when I was on Coast to Coast AM, and I was being personally attacked by one of the people.
[00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:41.362]  They never went anywhere that far.
[00:37:41.482 --> 00:37:42.302]  I didn't respond.
[00:37:43.083 --> 00:37:44.904]  And people say I won the debate because of that.
[00:37:45.484 --> 00:37:46.605]  This is about the issues.
[00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:49.507]  About the loss of sovereignty, the open borders, the gun control.
[00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:54.530]  This broadcast is number one in Freedom Radio because we focus on issues.
[00:37:55.402 --> 00:38:01.084]  But when you death threat, or when you imply you're going to kill people, we have to respond.
[00:38:02.164 --> 00:38:07.385]  And so, and it is unbelievable that people would allow this type of stuff to go on.
[00:38:07.866 --> 00:38:13.767]  They are extremely culpable, as it stands, the long history of abuse against my person and others.
[00:38:15.088 --> 00:38:16.128]  But again, I don't care.
[00:38:16.148 --> 00:38:19.129]  I mean, I may have a beautiful case against people.
[00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:23.170]  I've gone after folks twice for slander, and I've won.
[00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:26.942]  Both times, but he'd waste so much time and so much money.
[00:38:27.643 --> 00:38:33.890]  But when it gets into threats, we have to respond, and you want a response, you're going to get one.
[00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.893]  You're going to get a big, peaceful response.
[00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.675]  I hope you enjoy it.
[00:38:39.476 --> 00:38:43.641]  I'll be visiting with the lawyers later this afternoon, and you know when I say it, you can bet on it.
[00:38:44.101 --> 00:38:44.962]  So prepare yourselves.
[00:38:44.982 --> 00:38:45.603]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:52.733]  All right, let's go ahead and go to our guest, Carol W. Lagrasse, President, Property Rights Foundation of America.
[00:38:53.053 --> 00:38:56.135]  Carol, sorry you had to sit through that, but thank you for joining us.
[00:38:56.676 --> 00:38:57.616]  Oh, you're more than welcome.
[00:38:57.636 --> 00:39:04.301]  It's a pleasure to be on your show, and I'm so pleased that you're fighting back and not letting people try to run your life with threats.
[00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:07.523]  Oh, no, they never run my... I'm not afraid of the corrupt government.
[00:39:07.543 --> 00:39:08.624]  I'm certainly not afraid of punks.
[00:39:08.804 --> 00:39:09.044]  Yeah.
[00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.005]  I didn't come to the dance, I was dragged to it, but I will dance once I'm dancing.
[00:39:17.368 --> 00:39:20.090]  Now, Carol, this is a massive ruling today.
[00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.552]  Yeah, it's the worst ruling in my lifetime.
[00:39:22.612 --> 00:39:25.355]  I've been following these issues in one way or another.
[00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:33.582]  Yeah, first off, tell us, Carol, about Property Rights Foundation of America, because when I was researching who to have on this morning, your group has done so much to educate people.
[00:39:33.622 --> 00:39:34.122]  Tell us about it.
[00:39:34.603 --> 00:39:35.163]  Well, thank you.
[00:39:35.203 --> 00:39:37.645]  I just want to talk about the decision so people understand.
[00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:42.209]  The Supreme Court ruled today that people's homes can be taken if the
[00:39:43.152 --> 00:39:49.677]  city or whatever government agency says that this is good for the economy of the area if they can get more taxes or improve the economy.
[00:39:50.037 --> 00:39:56.922]  So that means that no one's house is safe because it's always something better financially that can be done with anyone's property.
[00:39:58.103 --> 00:40:06.669]  Many municipalities have been waiting to see what the Supreme Court would do and there's no doubt that there'll be a wave of condemnations all over the country.
[00:40:07.209 --> 00:40:12.613]  So if you've been hearing rumors of urban redevelopment in your area, you better beware.
[00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:33.056]  Then I'd like to say also that the only way we'll stop this, because the Supreme Court has now clarified that whereas before, when they dealt with a blighted neighborhood, there were outhouses in the middle of the city, there was disease, there were fire traps, now they're dealing with ordinary middle class neighborhoods just because something better can be done.
[00:40:33.737 --> 00:40:34.857]  So we have to rise up
[00:40:35.673 --> 00:40:40.597]  We have to make the Congress understand that we don't like this idea of a public purpose.
[00:40:41.137 --> 00:40:43.059]  The Constitution says public use.
[00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:45.961]  It doesn't say public purpose, however government defines it.
[00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:49.884]  So we must get the Congress to overturn this decision.
[00:40:50.304 --> 00:40:59.771]  Because they did say one small thing that they said the wrong way, that they'll defer to the legislature, but we must now make them defer to the legislature on our side.
[00:41:01.314 --> 00:41:02.334]  Well, absolutely.
[00:41:02.614 --> 00:41:07.356]  And look, Connecticut, this case in Connecticut has been watched so closely.
[00:41:07.636 --> 00:41:10.717]  For those that aren't aware of this particular case, why don't you fill us in, Carol?
[00:41:10.997 --> 00:41:15.738]  Well, it's a case of a middle-class neighborhood in Fort Trumbull, Connecticut.
[00:41:16.378 --> 00:41:20.279]  A group of the people were supported by a wonderful organization in Washington, D.C.
[00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:26.741]  when their property was going to be condemned for redevelopment for, you know, big stores and things like that.
[00:41:26.761 --> 00:41:29.622]  They have beautiful waterfront property, but it's ordinary homes.
[00:41:29.722 --> 00:41:30.602]  It isn't wealthy homes.
[00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:34.603]  And they carried the case all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:41:35.103 --> 00:41:57.093]  Many of the organizations, ranging from the NAACP, to the Association for the Advancement of Retired People, to this organization, the Property Rights Foundation of America, many of the great thinkers, you know, that believe in freedom, Richard Epstein at Chicago University School of Law, they all did friend of the court briefs to back up Suzette Kelo and those people, and the Institute for Justice.
[00:41:57.857 --> 00:42:07.525]  And I think we proved beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt that every claim in that case that went to the Supreme Court was simply legally bereft of any logic.
[00:42:08.406 --> 00:42:13.690]  I mean, they used a case from the fifties where, as I said, they condemned houses.
[00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.513]  About half of them had outhouses in the middle of Washington, D.C.
[00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:19.394]  This is not a blighted neighborhood.
[00:42:19.695 --> 00:42:22.337]  And all over the country we have the same situation.
[00:42:22.417 --> 00:42:24.318]  So, yes, everyone followed this case.
[00:42:24.358 --> 00:42:24.959]  We had our
[00:42:25.738 --> 00:42:41.134]  Uh, you know, our hearts are in our throats waiting for the outcome because we knew that we had wonderful friends in the Supreme Court, but we also know we have enemies of freedom, and it was, of course, closely divided, and Justice Stevens was the swing vote, so we got a 5-4 decision against us.
[00:42:42.275 --> 00:42:43.577]  And there we stand.
[00:42:44.601 --> 00:43:02.850]  Well, for those that don't know the particulars of the case in Connecticut, it's these old Victorian-style homes, middle-class, on this body of water, and the Real Estate Council and others want to tear it down and build office parks, luxury homes, high-rise apartments, and this is not where they're building a highway or something.
[00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.932]  No, this isn't an ordinary public thing, a hospital, a highway, a park, a school.
[00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:08.773]  This is just to build
[00:43:09.293 --> 00:43:12.636]  Better homes, better businesses, more expensive things.
[00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:17.459]  Nothing to do with a declaration that this neighborhood is even run down.
[00:43:17.619 --> 00:43:24.084]  And if the elite can come in and pay off your mayor and get your property because they want to build something, that's not a free country.
[00:43:24.664 --> 00:43:26.385]  No, this is absolute tyranny.
[00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:29.507]  This is completely against the American heritage.
[00:43:29.768 --> 00:43:31.249]  This is against our Constitution.
[00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.950]  A complete violation of what the decision says.
[00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:35.071]  We have
[00:43:36.758 --> 00:43:37.278]  Where is it?
[00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:49.485]  Without question, the court has defined the concept broadly of a public use, to mean a public purpose, reflecting its long-span policy of deference to legislative judgment.
[00:43:49.525 --> 00:43:54.068]  So, in other words, it's a natural interpretation of public use, they call it, as a public purpose.
[00:43:54.348 --> 00:43:56.449]  Well, anything could be a public purpose.
[00:43:57.289 --> 00:43:57.609]  You know?
[00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:05.654]  I mean, it might be a public purpose that they decide that they'll have a theme of blue and make everyone who has a red house tear it down because it can't be painted over.
[00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:08.371]  So you can define anything as the public.
[00:44:08.391 --> 00:44:09.732]  It has to be a public use.
[00:44:09.952 --> 00:44:18.240]  Were you aware of the ruling of four years ago up by Reno in Nevada where the Supreme Court ruled that they could take private property without just compensation?
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.724]  Well, there's a constant stream of Supreme Court rulings where they'll
[00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:30.350]  Overcome the private use of the property and require that you defer to the government's determination of your use.
[00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.611]  Those are regulatory takings?
[00:44:31.631 --> 00:44:41.294]  Is that the... Yes, and so they tell you, you know, openly, you know, the taxes say your land's worth a million bucks, and they go, no, it's worth $50,000, and that's what they tell you.
[00:44:41.614 --> 00:44:42.474]  Yeah, and so, well, you...
[00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:44.695]  You have a real problem fighting the values.
[00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:52.658]  You can even have the tax receipts in these cases showing how much taxes you've been paying, how much the government says it's worth, and they'll determine it, you know, 5-10% of value.
[00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:55.720]  Well, it's a very difficult situation financially.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:01.382]  Even if you receive the value of your house, there are so many other losses, you know.
[00:45:02.142 --> 00:45:10.446]  There have been some wonderful sociologists commenting on what the wave of condemnations of the 50s and 60s did to the black neighborhoods.
[00:45:10.807 --> 00:45:17.765]  Those neighborhoods, some of them were quite poverty-stricken, but they were places where the family and the community was based, where the churches, where the musicians were.
[00:45:18.046 --> 00:45:19.049]  They were all destroyed.
[00:45:19.776 --> 00:45:21.517]  And they had a whole culture.
[00:45:22.377 --> 00:45:22.837]  It's gone.
[00:45:22.857 --> 00:45:26.939]  Now the same thing is going to hit middle-class white neighborhoods.
[00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:32.722]  Every middle-class neighborhood is now subject to the same threat.
[00:45:32.782 --> 00:45:37.724]  Yeah, they tear down the privately owned homes of people and communities, and then build government housing, you name it.
[00:45:38.024 --> 00:45:39.705]  Yeah, build government housing, as you said.
[00:45:39.745 --> 00:45:40.985]  Build high-rises, something.
[00:45:41.285 --> 00:45:44.207]  Anytime you see a nice piece of waterfront property, forget it.
[00:45:44.247 --> 00:45:47.608]  You're just going to live in insecurity unless we get this changed by the Congress.
[00:45:48.044 --> 00:45:52.529]  And then that's a long shot, but people have to rise up.
[00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.031]  They just can't ignore this.
[00:45:54.071 --> 00:45:55.552]  They can't not pay attention.
[00:45:55.572 --> 00:45:59.196]  Well, you know, the Supreme Court has these arrogant statements here in their ruling.
[00:45:59.236 --> 00:46:00.798]  I have quotes out of their filing.
[00:46:01.238 --> 00:46:02.219]  I have the filing itself.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.982]  I printed the ruling, but I also have these little quotes here in AP.
[00:46:06.084 --> 00:46:13.130]  And it says local officials, not federal judges, know best in deciding whether a development project will benefit the community justice is set.
[00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.393]  So now local mayors are like kings.
[00:46:16.753 --> 00:46:17.413]  Absolutely.
[00:46:17.453 --> 00:46:21.537]  That's what the... I'm sitting here on the little syllabus of the decision right from the Supreme Court.
[00:46:21.577 --> 00:46:22.558]  You're exactly right.
[00:46:23.078 --> 00:46:30.144]  This is a complete deference to, frankly, a lot of sleazy politicians.
[00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:43.502]  Uh, and now, I'm saying this, I held public office for many years, so I'm going to think all politicians are sleazy, but there's a lot of sleaziness, there's a lot of corruption, but even if there's a non-oral person, I'll do my community some good, you know, and I'll make it more prosperous.
[00:46:43.662 --> 00:46:44.362]  No, no, no.
[00:46:44.943 --> 00:46:45.623]  We don't want that.
[00:46:45.723 --> 00:46:48.545]  We don't want houses condemned just to make the community more prosperous.
[00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:54.729]  We want only the burden of condemnation for hospitals, highways, things of a very restricted nature.
[00:46:56.002 --> 00:47:08.285]  It's unbelievable that, I mean, for those that don't know about this particular case in Connecticut, I mean, we're talking about a whole neighborhood that's established, a beautiful neighborhood, and they're just going to destroy it.
[00:47:08.505 --> 00:47:14.006]  I mean, to build other houses, a large portion of this will be homes.
[00:47:14.867 --> 00:47:16.327]  Yeah.
[00:47:16.527 --> 00:47:18.367]  You're just completely right.
[00:47:19.848 --> 00:47:22.528]  This is perfectly, exactly accurate, what you're saying.
[00:47:22.728 --> 00:47:24.869]  Well, how are they, I mean, I'm
[00:47:25.874 --> 00:47:31.398]  Getting to where I'm not stunned by government's tyranny, but this is so overt, Carol!
[00:47:31.578 --> 00:47:33.820]  This is the worst decision in my lifetime.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.303]  And I've been watching this sort of thing for so many years.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:47.669]  I mean, as a civil engineer, as a person involved in public affairs, I mean, my adulthood goes back a bit of time.
[00:47:47.709 --> 00:47:49.630]  This is the worst decision in my lifetime.
[00:47:50.091 --> 00:47:51.652]  If we can't undo this,
[00:47:53.382 --> 00:47:54.563]  I say goodbye to freedom.
[00:47:54.643 --> 00:47:56.384]  No one is safe in his or her own home.
[00:47:57.865 --> 00:47:58.866]  We must undo this.
[00:47:59.286 --> 00:48:08.753]  Also, have you noticed that they use phony environmental groups to get land restrictions on use retroactively and then try to take property as well?
[00:48:09.293 --> 00:48:09.973]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:48:10.134 --> 00:48:13.016]  You don't want to get me on this whole topic.
[00:48:13.176 --> 00:48:14.277]  No, no, please get into it.
[00:48:14.357 --> 00:48:14.697]  Please.
[00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:21.862]  Well, I mean, you've got the land trust working hand in glove with the government to act as land agents for government with every
[00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:33.913]  Uh, sleazy and sometimes genuinely, clearly illegal method to get land and also to get land and tax deductions and things like that for each other.
[00:48:33.933 --> 00:48:40.441]  I mean, the Nature Conservancy with the Board of Directors getting property from the Nature Conservancy.
[00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:42.750]  I mean, that went through Congressional hearings.
[00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.350]  It's all extremely documented.
[00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.911]  These environmental groups are pretty sleazy.
[00:48:46.971 --> 00:48:54.274]  I've got a man who just, John Dial in Illinois, he just won a court settlement against the National Wildlife Federation.
[00:48:54.694 --> 00:48:58.076]  They stole his children's book and published it illegally without paying him.
[00:48:58.536 --> 00:49:00.677]  And he just got $300,000 out of court.
[00:49:01.517 --> 00:49:02.838]  There's nothing they won't do.
[00:49:03.078 --> 00:49:05.339]  Well, I've been to smart growth conferences, Carol.
[00:49:05.379 --> 00:49:07.320]  They don't even hide what they're up to.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.500]  No, no.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.541]  I spoke last night to try to help
[00:49:11.651 --> 00:49:18.673]  Uh, a community in New York State, and it's not terribly far away, and after I spoke, wow, you should have heard the smart growth meadows in the audience.
[00:49:19.053 --> 00:49:21.294]  They just completely lie.
[00:49:21.794 --> 00:49:23.555]  They have no basis for what they say.
[00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:31.717]  They basically all have, if you talk to the individuals in the local communities, they have the idea they've gotten theirs, they moved it to the nice subdivision, now they don't want another subdivision, you know.
[00:49:32.417 --> 00:49:34.318]  Yeah, so I know, people have to wake up.
[00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.499]  Well, I think this is going to be a wake-up call.
[00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:41.260]  Yeah, this is, this decision received more interest than any other case that I've followed
[00:49:41.852 --> 00:49:55.807]  And the whole issue of these thousands, literally, of communities that have started condemning nice middle-class areas in the city centers has gotten more interest in government reform and in private property rights than any other issue.
[00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:59.872]  And bottom line, we're talking about incredibly valuable
[00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:12.693]  Businesses and homes all over the country, and the Real Estate Council comes in, pays off the council, and they just come in and try to steal the property, and then not even pay the people full market value.
[00:50:12.733 --> 00:50:14.074]  Folks, you need to go to your website.
[00:50:14.394 --> 00:50:17.355]  It's prfamerica.org.
[00:50:17.455 --> 00:50:20.096]  P-R-F-A-M-E-R-I-C-A dot O-R-G.
[00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:23.477]  Property Rights Foundation of America.
[00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:24.837]  But I would say this, Carol.
[00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:27.298]  Five years ago, people wouldn't listen to me on these issues.
[00:50:27.718 --> 00:50:30.659]  Now, everybody I talk to is aware of what's going on, Carol.
[00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:39.902]  Yeah, I had some hope that people would really make a difference because they have a tremendous interest now in the private property rights issues.
[00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:50.226]  But unfortunately, all of their interest, all of the remarkable treatises that were sent to the Supreme Court from this great range of groups had no influence on this swinging Judge Stevens.
[00:50:50.726 --> 00:50:52.808]  The others, uh, they're iffy.
[00:50:53.208 --> 00:50:57.893]  But, uh, we almost had, uh... I'll tell you what, do one more five minute segment with us, Carol.
[00:50:57.913 --> 00:51:00.195]  I know you're very busy on this dark day, but stay with us.
[00:51:00.235 --> 00:51:01.316]  Five more minutes on the other side.
[00:51:03.624 --> 00:51:10.470]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.151]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:12.352 --> 00:51:14.574]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:14.714 --> 00:51:16.796]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:17.076 --> 00:51:22.000]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.404]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:26.624 --> 00:51:28.404]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:39.127]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:39.267 --> 00:51:41.168]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:37.516]  I'm good.
[00:54:06.105 --> 00:54:12.111]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:12.552 --> 00:54:15.675]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.977 --> 00:54:19.619]  We're talking to Carol McGraw.
[00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:22.342]  She's the President of Property Rights Foundation of America.
[00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:28.264]  Talking about this headline, Cities May Cease Homes for Economic Development Court Rules.
[00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:32.007]  That means for private developers, private operations.
[00:54:32.308 --> 00:54:34.130]  Very, very serious, as she said.
[00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:38.054]  The worst ruling in her lifetime, and I would agree concerning property rights.
[00:54:39.014 --> 00:54:40.676]  And it's very, very serious.
[00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:45.340]  Details on this are at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:52.686]  Carol, seven of the nine members were appointed by Republicans, but we continue to see these rulings where, oh, we'll follow U.N.
[00:54:52.746 --> 00:54:56.750]  rulings, oh, we'll take private property, oh, we're ruling against the Second Amendment.
[00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.112]  I mean, this is not a conservative court.
[00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:17.982]  Yeah, we have a core of Judge Scalia, Judge Thomas, Senator O'Connor, she came through, but we don't have Judge Souda, he was appointed by, oh God, I know he was appointed by Reagan or Bush, I can't remember.
[00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:18.562]  I think it was Reagan.
[00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:24.896]  But, I mean, it's a real disappointment what he turned out to be.
[00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:27.496]  And of course, Judge Rehnquist has been on our side a lot of the time.
[00:55:27.716 --> 00:55:28.937]  Well, I want to point this out.
[00:55:28.977 --> 00:55:33.478]  The Supreme Court has, in the past, said that black people weren't human beings.
[00:55:34.258 --> 00:55:37.359]  And we just ignored those rulings because we know they are human beings.
[00:55:37.419 --> 00:55:41.299]  So, at a certain point, the Supreme Court is not the end-all be-all, are they?
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.520]  Well, they are until the Congress overturns this.
[00:55:45.921 --> 00:55:46.601]  The Congress can
[00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:50.791]  Uh, make a ruling that would overturn this ruling.
[00:55:51.071 --> 00:55:52.552]  Are you going to be lobbying to Congress?
[00:55:52.972 --> 00:56:03.559]  Well, our organization isn't, uh, you know, inherently a lobbying organization, but I certainly will be contacting my congressman and advising people how to do that, and, uh, and calling for them to do it.
[00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:06.881]  Uh, you know, they will testify, I will testify.
[00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:13.445]  It's just like Congress almost passed a law, uh, so they couldn't sue gun manufacturers, but they didn't get that done in the Senate.
[00:56:13.765 --> 00:56:16.387]  We need something similar here saying no.
[00:56:17.637 --> 00:56:21.001]  You can only take property for a hospital, or a highway, or a school.
[00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:23.645]  You cannot take it for luxury apartments.
[00:56:23.946 --> 00:56:27.911]  Absolutely, and it's very hard to do this state by state, although we have some progress in the states.
[00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:34.040]  For instance, in New York State, the Republicans were against eminent domain reform, and it was the Democrats
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:42.963]  I must say, that work for eminent domain reform in our particular state, that was really interesting.
[00:56:43.003 --> 00:56:48.125]  So here I was, allied with the party that's not the party of my family's birth, you know what I'm saying?
[00:56:48.665 --> 00:56:53.546]  And so, you never know where support and betrayal will come from.
[00:56:53.586 --> 00:56:54.427]  You just never know.
[00:56:54.447 --> 00:57:00.009]  Well, bottom line, the grassroots, Carol, as you know better than I, are totally against this garbage.
[00:57:00.889 --> 00:57:03.790]  There's no one, I know, that doesn't understand this.
[00:57:04.338 --> 00:57:05.259]  You explain it to them.
[00:57:05.519 --> 00:57:07.039]  They can take your house for stores.
[00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:09.040]  They can take your house for apartment houses.
[00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:09.581]  What?
[00:57:10.441 --> 00:57:13.443]  And they will not even pay you market value!
[00:57:13.983 --> 00:57:20.066]  Yeah, well, it's very hard to collect when you're the subject of an eminent domain proceeding because you have to be in court.
[00:57:20.346 --> 00:57:21.827]  You have to pay the appraisers.
[00:57:22.167 --> 00:57:25.829]  You have to get the judge to hear your case and to be fair about your case.
[00:57:26.625 --> 00:57:30.808]  And that costs tens of thousands of dollars, and most people don't have that discretionary income.
[00:57:31.228 --> 00:57:34.390]  Well, you have to invest in it, and it may all be lost.
[00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:39.093]  You may just get the same amount as before, or maybe after the expenses are taken out, it will amount to the same as before.
[00:57:39.653 --> 00:57:46.358]  Yeah, I mean, the federal government has rules and eminent domain to protect the people, but they're obeyed in the disregarding of them.
[00:57:46.378 --> 00:57:52.141]  I mean, it's all written in code books, but they never regard them with eminent domain for ordinary things like rights of way.
[00:57:52.161 --> 00:57:53.982]  What else can we do, Carol, to fight this?
[00:57:56.269 --> 00:58:03.598]  We, ourselves, people who have the public eye, you know, just keep harping on it, getting... I mean, we need busloads of people.
[00:58:03.638 --> 00:58:05.541]  We need protests in Washington.
[00:58:05.881 --> 00:58:10.747]  We need people going to their members of the legislature, or if not, one at a time, you know, like...
[00:58:11.768 --> 00:58:14.850]  I totally agree with you and a man's home is his castle, a woman's home is her palace.
[00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:17.092]  If we don't have this base right, we don't have any rights.
[00:58:41.748 --> 00:58:43.589]  Let me get the actual website here for people.
[00:58:43.629 --> 00:58:46.731]  PRFAmerica.org.
[00:58:46.911 --> 00:58:48.232]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:58:48.292 --> 00:58:49.153]  God bless you Alex Jones.
[00:58:59.958 --> 00:59:00.578]  Big Brother.
[00:59:01.259 --> 00:59:02.299]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.141]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:05.601]  You want answers?
[00:59:06.362 --> 00:59:07.883]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:07.923 --> 00:59:11.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.105 --> 00:59:16.248]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:22.392]  Alright, my friends, we're now into our number two.
[00:59:24.782 --> 00:59:28.203]  Of this live Thursday edition of the 23rd day of June 2005.
[00:59:29.303 --> 00:59:36.345]  And in the last hour we had on the President of the Property Rights Foundation of America.
[00:59:37.145 --> 00:59:41.747]  We got the break fired a little bit early there so I was unable to finish what I was saying.
[00:59:41.827 --> 00:59:43.907]  PRFAmerica.org.
[00:59:45.608 --> 00:59:48.669]  Cities may seize homes for economic development court rules.
[00:59:48.689 --> 00:59:50.129]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:59:50.689 --> 00:59:53.150]  A big case up in Connecticut where they want to build homes and
[00:59:54.045 --> 01:00:01.333]  Apartments and stores, where a hundred-year-old middle-class neighborhood is, they're now going to be bulldozing that.
[01:00:02.635 --> 01:00:08.501]  And federal courts have been ruling all over the country that a big case four years ago, they can take your property without just compensation.
[01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:11.714]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:11.754 --> 01:00:15.917]  I hope callers want to talk about this subject because I think it's very important.
[01:00:16.277 --> 01:00:24.803]  Bunch of other news here as well on Chinese Communist companies trying to buy up major blue chip American companies.
[01:00:25.424 --> 01:00:29.887]  Also, new developments with Torturegate coming out.
[01:00:30.207 --> 01:00:35.891]  There is just so much in the next two hours that we'll be here discussing.
[01:00:36.692 --> 01:00:38.714]  Right now, let's go to Eric in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:38.754 --> 01:00:39.254]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:00:42.132 --> 01:00:47.595]  Three or four times before, and I'm here to promote a march on Ground Zero in New York City on 9-11-2005.
[01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:53.238]  The 9-11 Truth Movement is trying to get as many people as it possibly can.
[01:00:53.618 --> 01:00:54.218]  Well that's good.
[01:00:54.278 --> 01:00:55.679]  Listen, Eric, thank you for your call.
[01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.079]  I appreciate that.
[01:00:57.139 --> 01:01:00.121]  Yeah, I've been at two marches at Ground Zero.
[01:01:01.813 --> 01:01:06.817]  And we do think it's good to have people there at Ground Zero on 9-11.
[01:01:07.337 --> 01:01:10.839]  And the Truth Movement all over the country for three years has been having rallies.
[01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:16.403]  In some cases, last year it was like, I don't know, 30-something cities that I saw photographs from and articles from.
[01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.624]  I'm sure it's more than that.
[01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:30.851]  Kansas City, L.A., New York, Tampa, Florida, just all over the place with people with their signs out there, people out there getting the truth out and exposing 9-11.
[01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:34.432]  So thank you so much for that call, Eric.
[01:01:34.452 --> 01:01:37.394]  Again, we're going to hurry through your calls today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:43.901]  And you can talk about any issue you want, but I would predominantly like a little bit to talk about property rights.
[01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:45.142]  It's a very big deal.
[01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:47.004]  Ron in New York, go ahead Ron.
[01:01:47.344 --> 01:01:49.546]  Yes Alex, and that's the topic I'm going to talk about.
[01:01:49.566 --> 01:01:50.907]  This is outrageous.
[01:01:51.048 --> 01:01:55.392]  We're talking about the collaboration of government power with corporate power.
[01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.049]  To displace the average citizen.
[01:01:58.289 --> 01:02:00.892]  And that's the big F word.
[01:02:00.912 --> 01:02:04.155]  The purpose of government is to even out the playing field to some degree.
[01:02:05.116 --> 01:02:08.379]  To help the people against private power.
[01:02:08.419 --> 01:02:09.941]  What you have here is corporatism.
[01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:11.642]  Mussolini discussed this in the 1920s.
[01:02:11.822 --> 01:02:15.386]  The marriage between government power and private corporate power.
[01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:18.790]  That's what we're being, you know, subjected to, corporatism.
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:25.898]  And Mussolini said, as you just stated, I was about to say that, he said it should properly be called corporatism or mercantilism.
[01:02:25.978 --> 01:02:26.959]  It's not free market.
[01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:27.299]  Go ahead.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.821]  Absolutely not free market.
[01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:32.906]  Now, another thing, too, is these people are not going to get the free market value of their homes.
[01:02:33.466 --> 01:02:42.149]  They're going to get the assessed value of their homes, and any homeowner knows that an assessed value is always one-third to one-fifth of the free market value of their homes.
[01:02:42.629 --> 01:02:46.491]  What happens here now... The free market value is best use of the term.
[01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:48.631]  It is the maximum amount you could get.
[01:02:48.971 --> 01:02:53.233]  Right, which you'll never get as part of an eminent domain claim from your local government.
[01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:59.055]  Yeah, I mean, if you hold out some in your house for a shopping mall, you might get $10 million for it when you bought $100,000.
[01:02:59.315 --> 01:03:01.136]  That's how the free market works.
[01:03:01.396 --> 01:03:09.339]  Right, but the government comes in aiding corporations, and they give you what they call the assessed value, so you get $30,000 for a home that might be worth $250,000.
[01:03:09.399 --> 01:03:10.459]  Now, what happens to displaced populations?
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.021]  They now lost the equity in their home.
[01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:17.122]  They've now been downgraded into poverty.
[01:03:17.182 --> 01:03:17.863]  What do they do now?
[01:03:17.963 --> 01:03:19.584]  Move on to poverty reservations?
[01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:20.644]  Ghetto-wise people?
[01:03:20.684 --> 01:03:21.365]  Is this how you do it?
[01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:25.087]  You take their property and you make them poor so we all have to be concentrated in the ghetto?
[01:03:25.147 --> 01:03:25.747]  Stay there, Ron.
[01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.088]  I'm gonna let you go through more of this.
[01:03:27.108 --> 01:03:28.929]  You're bringing up all the salient points.
[01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:31.211]  And we'll take more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:31.291]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.411]  This issue and a lot of others.
[01:03:40.576 --> 01:03:43.319]  On the other side of this quick break, I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[01:04:15.916 --> 01:04:18.758]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:18.858 --> 01:04:23.520]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:28.123]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:35.587]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.401]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[01:06:46.119 --> 01:06:46.579]  Big Brother.
[01:06:46.599 --> 01:06:47.500]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:03.124 --> 01:07:04.225]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:04.886 --> 01:07:05.726]  You want answers?
[01:07:06.447 --> 01:07:07.348]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:07.368 --> 01:07:11.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:12.212 --> 01:07:16.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:19.898]  Alright, 8 minutes, 23 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:19.918 --> 01:07:21.219]  A total of three number to join us.
[01:07:21.239 --> 01:07:21.479]  1-800-2599-231.
[01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:21.559]  1-800-2599-231.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.481]  Predominantly in the last hour,
[01:07:33.317 --> 01:07:36.478]  I was getting into the Supreme Court ruling of this morning.
[01:07:36.498 --> 01:07:39.099]  I have the briefing here in front of me.
[01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:40.180]  They're ruling in front of me.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.962]  They can now take your property and not even give you just compensation.
[01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:52.505]  Not just if it is on a highway or a hospital or a school, but now for apartments or for businesses.
[01:07:54.145 --> 01:07:55.286]  Very, very serious.
[01:07:55.346 --> 01:07:57.867]  And they've been picking on the inner cities for a long time.
[01:07:58.567 --> 01:08:01.228]  Now it's going to be middle class America.
[01:08:03.314 --> 01:08:05.615]  We were talking to Ron in New York about this subject.
[01:08:05.635 --> 01:08:06.915]  We'll go back to Ron in a second.
[01:08:07.055 --> 01:08:14.698]  But then, I want to get into Chinese oil company offers $18.5 billion for Unicold.
[01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:20.461]  Also, the Chinese are trying to buy Maytag right now.
[01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:23.682]  One of the few companies that still makes things here in the United States.
[01:08:24.426 --> 01:08:27.969]  Pentagon sued by its own soldier over Gitmo beating he received.
[01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:34.014]  Now we have interrogators quitting, refusing, interpreters, their own general over the camp, all these army reports admitting it.
[01:08:34.915 --> 01:08:38.058]  And this stuff comes out in the mainstream news but never hits the nightly news.
[01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:45.244]  It's on the news wires, it's in a few newspapers, but never, you know, a big nightly issue like Michael Jackson or something.
[01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:47.886]  So the average person doesn't even know that this is happening.
[01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:48.607]  It is admitted.
[01:08:48.987 --> 01:08:49.968]  Massive torture.
[01:08:51.676 --> 01:08:52.016]  U.S.
[01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:53.977]  is poised to rule on cloned livestock.
[01:08:53.997 --> 01:09:03.819]  The Financial Times of London is reporting, as of last night, that it looks like the Supreme Court's going to rule that cloned milk, cloned cows, cloned pigs, chickens, that it's healthy.
[01:09:04.619 --> 01:09:09.440]  And we've had top scientists on, you know, the fathers of modern genetic engineering on this broadcast.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.101]  When you change one gene in a potato,
[01:09:12.879 --> 01:09:17.961]  It then manipulates the other 96% of the genetics they thought was, quote, junk DNA.
[01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:18.901]  They found out it's not.
[01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:34.647]  It creates in the tissues artificial proteins that didn't exist before and are bad for the animal in question, or the life form in question, the vegetable, the plant, or animal in question, or the microorganism in question.
[01:09:35.907 --> 01:09:38.128]  Gives rise to very dangerous mutations.
[01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:41.749]  And it's bad for those that eat it.
[01:09:42.327 --> 01:09:48.772]  We have their own internal studies from Monsanto and others, not just all the other independent studies, where they admit it's very dangerous, but oh no!
[01:09:49.112 --> 01:09:51.133]  The Supreme Court, it's good for you!
[01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:53.235]  It's good for you!
[01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:58.592]  So that's coming up as well, but Ron in New York, finish up what you were saying, my friend.
[01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:03.175]  So as I said, what this will do now... Yeah, recap everything you said, because it's so important.
[01:10:03.475 --> 01:10:15.342]  Okay, it'll drive people into poverty, because if you've invested your life in a home, and all of a sudden the rug is pulled out from under you, and you're given one-third the value of your home, you're being driven into poverty, where you're going to have to go.
[01:10:15.363 --> 01:10:22.467]  You're going to have to go and live in an impoverished area, which means they're going to concentrate you in impoverished areas, ghettos, poverty reservations, call them what you will.
[01:10:23.027 --> 01:10:24.848]  This is what the purpose of this type of thing is.
[01:10:24.868 --> 01:10:36.111]  And what you're going to have is you're going to have, especially in big cities like New York, you have developers who are just drooling at the mouth to get hold of neighborhoods, flatten them for their own purpose.
[01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:38.692]  And what is the good of these places?
[01:10:38.952 --> 01:10:44.654]  So they build a Walmart so you could have a minimum wage job with marginal to no medical benefits?
[01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:47.675]  Or are they building an area where elites can move in?
[01:10:48.135 --> 01:10:50.256]  And only elites can move in and afford to move in?
[01:10:50.276 --> 01:10:57.479]  So you could move back, you could go back to the area, work in Walmart for minimum wage, to serve an elite who's the only one that can afford to live in that neighborhood.
[01:10:57.579 --> 01:11:12.305]  Well let's be clear, this big case up in Connecticut is a middle class, hundred year old, Victorian style homes, hundreds of them that were just condemned, they're trying to get thousands, the entire gigantic neighborhood along the water there, along the river and the lake it connects to,
[01:11:13.414 --> 01:11:29.823]  And they're saying, we will choose what is built, what can be done, for private interest, and the Real Estate Council is openly arguing to get that property for reduced prices, and this is so amazing!
[01:11:30.064 --> 01:11:31.744]  And you know how real estate works, these people...
[01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:40.807]  Well, the people that have bought into this have something that's very valuable, but now they're going to be given reduced value and not even be able to buy into the same thing they had.
[01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:41.647]  That's right.
[01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:42.448]  And you know what?
[01:11:42.468 --> 01:11:45.748]  This is going to give a green light to these developers to go hog wild.
[01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:47.889]  Oh, they're now admitting it.
[01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:52.350]  Cities all over the country are now announcing within hours that the grabbing is about to start.
[01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:58.972]  And let me ask you, how come in the midst of this, and as you say, it's one of the most fundamental rights we have, the right to your property,
[01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.383]  How come in the midst of this, the U.S.
[01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:12.374]  Congress is dealing with the meaningless emotionalism of flag-burning amendments, why don't they introduce a property rights amendment, or reinforce the Fourth Amendment with an additional property rights amendment?
[01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.658]  Let's have substance over stupid, mindless emotionalism.
[01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:20.323]  Well, I'm not in favor... Well, for those that just joined us, explain where you stand on the flag.
[01:12:21.447 --> 01:12:23.168]  Well, I'm not in favor of flag-burning.
[01:12:23.288 --> 01:12:24.748]  Let's get our priorities correct.
[01:12:25.288 --> 01:12:29.549]  Right now, we have a bigger problem after this ruling, and we're going to need an amendment to the U.S.
[01:12:29.569 --> 01:12:31.049]  Constitution to protect people.
[01:12:31.109 --> 01:12:33.950]  A new amendment to protect people from property seizures.
[01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:41.792]  Because the developers, the corporatists, the oligarchs, whatever you call them, they are the money power in this country, and they're running this country.
[01:12:41.832 --> 01:12:43.212]  They've usurped public power.
[01:12:43.232 --> 01:12:44.413]  They've usurped your government.
[01:12:44.733 --> 01:12:45.133]  They own it.
[01:12:46.098 --> 01:12:50.620]  You're going to have to put some pressure on and stand up and get some protection.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:59.423]  The flag, I'm not in favor of burning the flag, but that is secondary to someone's ability to come and take the home, the roof from overhead.
[01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:00.243]  Yeah, let's be specific.
[01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:02.464]  We love the flag and respect it.
[01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:06.667]  Because it symbolizes the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:13:07.107 --> 01:13:08.789]  It symbolizes our country.
[01:13:09.309 --> 01:13:09.850]  That's why.
[01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:18.276]  And the First Amendment, which is what the flag symbolizes, a large portion of it, is the right to burn that flag.
[01:13:18.316 --> 01:13:25.122]  Whereas, I have the right to tell the screwball burning it, they're an idiot, I have the right to burn a United Nations flag.
[01:13:25.162 --> 01:13:29.545]  So, I defend the right to burn the flag, though I don't support that right.
[01:13:30.026 --> 01:13:32.568]  That is, I support the right to burn it, though I don't like burning it.
[01:13:32.828 --> 01:13:34.649]  Legalities versus morality.
[01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:35.110]  It's okay.
[01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:35.690]  We're not confused.
[01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.652]  Well, this is form over substance, Ron.
[01:13:37.712 --> 01:13:41.495]  I mean, we're destroying what the flag symbolizes.
[01:13:41.555 --> 01:13:46.218]  We're destroying the real liberties, the real base freedoms.
[01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:48.600]  And don't worry, we'll protect your symbol.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.101]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:13:50.502 --> 01:13:58.708]  I say that the big move right now should be, and it should be massive, to push for an additional and new amendment to the Constitution to protect private property in light of this ruling.
[01:14:00.549 --> 01:14:02.470]  We have areas in the Bill of Rights that do that.
[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.851]  The 9th Amendment, the 10th Amendment.
[01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:06.792]  Let me finish, Ron, since you brought this up.
[01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.934]  We have literally thousands of federal and state rulings.
[01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:14.857]  All the precedent, until now, says that it is sacrosanct private property.
[01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:17.518]  Right, and the Supreme Court just threw that all out the window this morning.
[01:14:18.058 --> 01:14:21.100]  But let's do that, because it'll serve multiple good purposes.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.501]  And you know one of the great things it'll do?
[01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:27.243]  It'll finally flush out our phony representatives in Washington, both left and right.
[01:14:27.603 --> 01:14:34.845]  The rightists who always say they're in favor of private property rights, well, they have a chance to get down on the blotter on that and prove that they are.
[01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:43.668]  And the leftists who say they're in favor of the little man over the corporation, well, they'll have a chance to get down on the blotter and vote for an amendment like that to protect the little man.
[01:14:43.988 --> 01:14:48.230]  We'll get to see what the true substance of our leaders are if we force an issue like that.
[01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:53.393]  An amendment to reinforce, as you say there are amendments there, but let's reaffirm them, okay?
[01:14:53.913 --> 01:15:01.438]  To reinforce the United States Constitution, to reinforce the Bill of Rights with reference to protection of private property rights.
[01:15:02.078 --> 01:15:03.800]  Let's see what the roll call will be on that.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.381]  Alright, I agree with you, thank you.
[01:15:07.222 --> 01:15:09.223]  Bush has control of the House, the Senate.
[01:15:10.024 --> 01:15:16.447]  Uh, the courts, 30 plus governorships, he has control of the executive, and he wants to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[01:15:17.008 --> 01:15:25.272]  They've built a new giant BATF building in D.C., and Alberto Gonzales says he wants more gun control, he believes in it in his heart, victim disarmament.
[01:15:26.133 --> 01:15:28.194]  Uh, where is the restriction on abortion?
[01:15:28.254 --> 01:15:29.754]  Where is the restriction on the borders?
[01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:32.476]  Where is the restriction on UNESCO and the U.N.?
[01:15:32.916 --> 01:15:34.577]  We're seeing the opposite!
[01:15:35.858 --> 01:15:36.638]  The opposite!
[01:15:37.999 --> 01:15:38.199]  Now,
[01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:42.896]  Again, I don't want to hear it from people that think they're conservatives who aren't really conservatives.
[01:15:42.976 --> 01:15:44.217]  Stop defending George Bush.
[01:15:44.558 --> 01:15:45.979]  George Bush is just a puppet.
[01:15:46.479 --> 01:15:52.684]  But see, because you believe he's really in power, you sit there and defend everything this government's doing because, well, George Bush couldn't do wrong.
[01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:54.746]  That's just not true!
[01:15:55.026 --> 01:15:56.568]  We're losing this country!
[01:15:57.108 --> 01:15:59.790]  Well then, Alex, are you saying we should have the Democrats?
[01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:04.254]  I guarantee you, if the Democrats were in office right now, they wouldn't be getting away with all of this.
[01:16:04.334 --> 01:16:05.275]  Oh, they'd be trying it.
[01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:13.281]  Only a so-called... Look at what happens when you get a Nixon, or a Reagan, or a Bush, or a Bush Sr.
[01:16:13.882 --> 01:16:16.384]  Look at all the big government, the loss of freedom.
[01:16:16.804 --> 01:16:22.788]  That's because the elite knows we're a conservative country, and they know that if they put a phony conservative in, they can fool everybody.
[01:16:24.309 --> 01:16:25.110]  You understand that?
[01:16:26.488 --> 01:16:30.871]  And both parties are totally, totally corrupt and blown out.
[01:16:31.191 --> 01:16:31.832]  Kim in Texas.
[01:16:31.872 --> 01:16:32.412]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:16:32.692 --> 01:16:34.593]  This is Kim with a K. I'm sorry.
[01:16:34.653 --> 01:16:35.574]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:16:36.314 --> 01:16:39.596]  Alex, is he doing this to open the Constitution?
[01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:43.679]  I know you were telling us a while back that Bush wants to open the Constitution.
[01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.021]  So is this another move to try to open the Constitution again?
[01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:49.963]  Because you said we're covered under the Bill of Rights.
[01:16:50.905 --> 01:16:54.568]  That Ron was saying, you know, can we open the Constitution and get an amendment done?
[01:16:55.029 --> 01:16:57.091]  Well, I think Ron's a really smart, good guy.
[01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:00.294]  He's a retired police officer in New York, sent me a lot of good info.
[01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:02.556]  I don't think Ron was fully thinking that through.
[01:17:02.596 --> 01:17:06.660]  I mean, I didn't want to tell him he was wrong, but I did say, hey, it's already protected.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:13.382]  But I think, I mean, a limited declaration, you know, new amendment saying, hey, it's totally sacrosanct wouldn't hurt.
[01:17:13.742 --> 01:17:30.466]  The problem is, in that process, it could open up other amendments, which the 22nd Amendment, they're trying to repeal that, so Bush can be president for life, or Hillary or whoever, they've got a bill in there to repeal Article 2, Clause 5, so Swartzy can be president.
[01:17:30.866 --> 01:17:31.867]  So it is dangerous.
[01:17:31.907 --> 01:17:34.507]  We need to enforce the Constitution that's there, Kim.
[01:17:34.527 --> 01:17:36.208]  Yes, also, Alex,
[01:17:36.969 --> 01:17:41.091]  I was driving outside of Dallas on 45, Dallas, Texas.
[01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:41.712]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:17:41.852 --> 01:17:44.873]  And I saw a company that makes RFID chips.
[01:17:47.155 --> 01:17:48.415]  What, did you see the factory?
[01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:49.376]  Yeah, the factory.
[01:17:49.396 --> 01:17:50.696]  I was just amazed.
[01:17:51.617 --> 01:17:52.177]  Oh, yeah, ma'am.
[01:17:52.197 --> 01:17:53.198]  They're building the factories.
[01:17:53.238 --> 01:17:58.921]  The Army, what, a year ago, ordered over the next five years, I forget, what, three billion chips?
[01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:00.022]  Wow.
[01:18:00.062 --> 01:18:01.482]  They're not playing games, dear.
[01:18:01.502 --> 01:18:06.145]  Walmart ordered all their manufacturers two years ago, by this year,
[01:18:07.297 --> 01:18:13.342]  And they're 35% of total retail sales globally, not just in America.
[01:18:13.362 --> 01:18:16.544]  And so that's 35% of manufacturers.
[01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:19.847]  They ordered and put RFID in or we're not going to take your products.
[01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:24.690]  Now, most of them said no because of protest, but they're still trying to push it.
[01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:31.235]  But they were already, this year, by right now, mid-05, everything was supposed to have it, dear.
[01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:32.556]  Oh my gosh.
[01:18:32.596 --> 01:18:33.337]  Let me ask you this.
[01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:36.279]  When I called Washington about this property,
[01:18:36.932 --> 01:18:39.133]  And I speak to my congressmen and my senators.
[01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:42.134]  Who do I, how do I put this to them?
[01:18:42.194 --> 01:18:43.595]  Is there like a number?
[01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:46.576]  Well I'll tell you what, stay there and we'll talk about it on the other side.
[01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:48.556]  Stay there, Kim, in Texas.
[01:18:49.337 --> 01:18:52.578]  And we'll go to Megan and Marilyn and many others.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.540]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[01:19:09.068 --> 01:19:09.509]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:10.089 --> 01:19:12.429]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:19:12.489 --> 01:19:15.710]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:25.419 --> 01:19:27.760]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:31.040]  A 16% increase in real money.

[01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:04.190]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:11.933]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:21.517]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?

[01:22:51.750 --> 01:23:14.647]  Alright, we were talking to Kim in Texas, and we'll talk to Megan, Marilyn, Eric, Ian, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:15.928 --> 01:23:19.331]  Kim, when you call Congress, you say, this is unbelievable.
[01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:35.522]  The Supreme Court just ruled today, or if you call them tomorrow, they just ruled yesterday, that now they're going to have government takings for corporations that isn't even for public works projects or public domain.
[01:23:36.302 --> 01:23:44.867]  And this is totally against the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, property rights going back to the Magna Carta, and even before that.
[01:23:46.128 --> 01:23:49.630]  Now Alex, when I said that before they asked for my name and everything,
[01:23:51.246 --> 01:23:52.987]  Well, that's because they want to know that you're a constituent.
[01:23:53.347 --> 01:23:54.648]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:54.828 --> 01:23:56.989]  But, you know, ask them their name.
[01:23:57.009 --> 01:24:03.113]  I mean, it's usually just some staffer who wants to be able to write you a letter back to make you think that they're listening to you.
[01:24:03.133 --> 01:24:03.333]  Oh, okay.
[01:24:03.533 --> 01:24:07.555]  And they are listening to you at a certain level, but you don't have to give them your name.
[01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:09.196]  You just say, look, I'm just a concerned citizen.
[01:24:09.956 --> 01:24:12.838]  This affects every district in the country, including my district.
[01:24:13.538 --> 01:24:15.239]  Do you know who your congressman or woman is?
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:15.960]  Me?
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:16.560]  Yes.
[01:24:17.962 --> 01:24:20.123]  No, I just asked for the one in Texas.
[01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:21.244]  I don't even get their name.
[01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:22.144]  I live in Houston.
[01:24:22.164 --> 01:24:22.284]  Right.
[01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:39.222]  That's something we've all got to learn.
[01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:43.245]  Who our Senators are, who our Congress people are, who our City Council are.
[01:24:43.325 --> 01:24:45.606]  It's hard, but we've got to keep track of it.
[01:24:45.626 --> 01:24:46.167]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:47.147 --> 01:24:47.848]  I appreciate it.
[01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:55.213]  Part of Ron Paul's district runs along the side down to Houston, but he's not really the person for Houston.
[01:24:55.313 --> 01:24:56.134]  Great Congressman.
[01:24:56.154 --> 01:24:56.674]  Best we've got.
[01:24:57.524 --> 01:24:59.405]  Thanks for the call, Kim, and thanks for your concern.
[01:24:59.425 --> 01:25:02.786]  Hey, just being concerned and doing something is better than nothing.
[01:25:03.326 --> 01:25:04.847]  Megan in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[01:25:04.867 --> 01:25:06.047]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:25:06.307 --> 01:25:06.907]  Good.
[01:25:07.188 --> 01:25:24.894]  One thing I heard a couple weeks ago on your favorite radio station, NPR, they did a story about when this kind of thing passed in Oregon, then the citizens got together and passed another initiative through a vote that the environmentalists were really trying hard to fight, that if your property gets taken,
[01:25:25.547 --> 01:25:42.796]  And you're not given proper property value, then unfortunately, they made it affect the other citizens, but to hammer the point home anyway, that if this corporation isn't going to pay you proper value, then the slack has to be taken up by the taxpayers.
[01:25:42.856 --> 01:25:43.857]  They have to pay you the back.
[01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:46.118]  No, I'm aware of that, which the corporations love.
[01:25:46.138 --> 01:25:47.439]  They'll just tax all of us more.
[01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:48.139]  Exactly.
[01:25:48.179 --> 01:25:48.960]  They'll go, sure!
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:49.820]  Right.
[01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:53.142]  And this is happening here in my area, actually.
[01:25:53.162 --> 01:25:54.783]  They're going to take
[01:25:55.419 --> 01:26:07.221]  A shopping district that is, you know, probably there's some businesses that have been there for 60 years, but they're not upscale enough for the yuppies to go shopping at and there's not enough parking for them to shop at the other more expensive shops they want.
[01:26:07.781 --> 01:26:14.883]  So they're going to tear down like a quarter mile strip of apartments and businesses that have been here for years and years and years.
[01:26:15.903 --> 01:26:17.503]  And that's the way they do it.
[01:26:17.903 --> 01:26:20.524]  But you're missing a lot of fun in Philadelphia this summer.
[01:26:20.544 --> 01:26:22.804]  I don't know if you know about the Live Aid concert.
[01:26:23.365 --> 01:26:24.386]  I've heard about that, yes.
[01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:27.749]  And also, La Raza is having their national convention here in July.
[01:26:27.769 --> 01:26:31.973]  And Hillary's going to be here, and so is Gutierrez, doing lectures.
[01:26:32.013 --> 01:26:38.499]  So I might have to go down there and try to write some articles about it, because it's pretty... Yeah, send us some articles.
[01:26:38.519 --> 01:26:40.621]  We'd love to have a reporter there on the ground, Megan.
[01:26:40.842 --> 01:26:47.468]  Yeah, and the only other thing I was going to say about this Live Aid is that it's interesting that the length, and I may email that to Paul, but the length
[01:26:48.106 --> 01:26:49.286]  That come from Live Aid.
[01:26:49.306 --> 01:26:54.908]  First of all, it comes from Bob Geldof, who became a knight by the Queen after he did his first Live Aid concert.
[01:26:54.928 --> 01:27:03.130]  Yeah, the supposed aid that goes to Africa, all these people mean well, most of the organizers mean well, but it's used to control and manipulate Africa.
[01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:16.453]  Right, so now there's this new organization called One.org, and they have other, you know, besides their liberal left-wings, then they have Pat Robertson on there as part of their foundation to unify the world.
[01:27:16.877 --> 01:27:27.931]  And also the leader of World Vision, and it quotes right on their website, he's suggesting to George Bush, since they're both Christians, that we should donate 1% of our annual GDP to this fund.
[01:27:28.895 --> 01:27:31.458]  Oh yes, World Tax and of course World Vision.
[01:27:31.698 --> 01:27:32.779]  World Vision, what a scam.
[01:27:32.859 --> 01:27:41.228]  Is the shadowy CIA front group, I mean directly connected, where all these famous mass shooters happen to be in their training camps before they do it.
[01:27:41.508 --> 01:27:45.171]  Right, was it, I think, was Nicholas Burke part of World Vision at one time or something like that?
[01:27:45.191 --> 01:27:52.239]  There was a connection, but the guy that shot John Lennon, the person that, just a bunch of other people.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.685]  The guy that shot Ronald Reagan, his dad was the head of World Vision, and he'd been trained at World Vision.
[01:27:59.205 --> 01:28:07.892]  Okay, and then the last thing going on here in Philadelphia this week, I wish I'd known earlier, I would have got down to try to write some things about this, the Biotech 2005 Convention.
[01:28:08.213 --> 01:28:10.995]  We've got a Homeland Security Convention going on here in Austin right now.
[01:28:11.035 --> 01:28:13.437]  I've been so busy, I haven't been able to go to it.
[01:28:13.477 --> 01:28:14.338]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:28:15.396 --> 01:28:19.139]  We got a call last week, a couple weeks ago, when they shot this poor Hispanic man in the back.
[01:28:19.159 --> 01:28:20.520]  Of course, day one, it happened.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.621]  We had a guest on about it.
[01:28:21.761 --> 01:28:23.563]  Some lady calls our comment line real mad.
[01:28:23.923 --> 01:28:24.964]  Why wasn't Alex there?
[01:28:25.024 --> 01:28:26.165]  Why wasn't he on the scene?
[01:28:27.226 --> 01:28:29.628]  And so Mike Nansen answered the comment line.
[01:28:29.648 --> 01:28:34.712]  He said, uh, because he still gets the comments from the TV show, even though Mike really doesn't work for him much anymore.
[01:28:34.732 --> 01:28:35.472]  He just runs one of the TV shows.
[01:28:35.512 --> 01:28:36.213]  He does a great job.
[01:28:36.913 --> 01:28:38.435]  And Mike just said, you know what he's doing today?
[01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:42.698]  His own radio show, a movie showing, and Coast to Coast AM, and some interviews.
[01:28:43.359 --> 01:28:44.680]  Now, I mean, what more can we do?
[01:28:46.144 --> 01:28:47.047]  We're on the march.
[01:28:47.548 --> 01:28:49.152]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.762]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.672 --> 01:28:59.054]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:28:59.294 --> 01:28:59.634]  Why?
[01:28:59.974 --> 01:29:02.595]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:57.256]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:57.416 --> 01:30:01.417]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:01.657 --> 01:30:04.539]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:04.619 --> 01:30:11.341]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:11.501 --> 01:30:14.523]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:14.723 --> 01:30:17.104]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:17.244 --> 01:30:25.127]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:25.427 --> 01:30:36.713]  Fertizine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[01:31:32.454 --> 01:31:35.977]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:43.964]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[01:31:44.224 --> 01:31:47.487]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[01:31:47.927 --> 01:31:51.570]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:53.652]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:08.073]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:31.278 --> 01:32:34.299]  Maryland and Eric and Ian and many others are coming up.
[01:32:34.339 --> 01:32:38.520]  Then I'm going to get off and do the torture news, the economic news, the cloning news.
[01:32:39.321 --> 01:32:40.241]  There is a lot of it.
[01:32:40.281 --> 01:32:43.602]  Just briefly coming up next Monday, last showing of Martial Law.
[01:32:44.162 --> 01:32:48.043]  The other five showings sold out in many cases a week before we even show the film.
[01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:53.005]  This will be the last showing, at least for the summer, at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:32:54.257 --> 01:33:03.407]  8 o'clock next Monday, go to InfoWars.com, link through over to the Alamo Draft House, get your tickets online via their safe, secure ticketing system, or drive by the door.
[01:33:04.609 --> 01:33:10.355]  You can buy tickets there today, tomorrow, Monday, Saturday, Sunday, they're open until like midnight every night.
[01:33:11.456 --> 01:33:13.338]  You can buy tickets right there at the box office.
[01:33:13.358 --> 01:33:15.380]  I think the box office is open until about 10 or 11 though.
[01:33:17.048 --> 01:33:18.469]  And I just hope to see you out there.
[01:33:18.489 --> 01:33:19.430]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:20.632]  Tickets are really going quick.
[01:33:21.092 --> 01:33:25.858]  If you want to get a hard copy of Martial Law on DVD or VHS, it's three hours long.
[01:33:27.419 --> 01:33:28.721]  It's a mini-series.
[01:33:28.801 --> 01:33:32.425]  It covers what happened on 9-11, who's at level of star, their mindset.
[01:33:32.525 --> 01:33:34.587]  It covers the latest police state developments.
[01:33:34.768 --> 01:33:35.789]  It is my best film.
[01:33:36.576 --> 01:33:43.182]  My other videos are excellent, but it is heads and shoulders above the rest, and many are calling it the best Patriot film out there, bar none.
[01:33:43.583 --> 01:33:44.203]  I hope you'll get it.
[01:33:44.223 --> 01:33:45.044]  I hope you'll make copies.
[01:33:45.064 --> 01:33:49.048]  Toll-free number to order Martial Law 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or go to infowars.com

[01:34:37.206 --> 01:34:49.672]  For the next 5-10 minutes though, I kind of want to go back in time here because we've got Stuart Nelson on the line with us, a good friend of mine.
[01:34:51.181 --> 01:35:03.488]  When Joe Campana, a atomic veteran, a veteran of World War II, a veteran of the Korean conflict, he never bragged about his medals.
[01:35:03.508 --> 01:35:05.569]  We got into his stuff when we were moving him out of his house.
[01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:08.630]  There were all these incredible medals and commendations.
[01:35:09.131 --> 01:35:11.872]  He was at Bikini Island during bomb testing.
[01:35:12.412 --> 01:35:13.813]  He was in World War II.
[01:35:15.514 --> 01:35:18.116]  And he wasn't even getting his full disability from the
[01:35:20.112 --> 01:35:20.752]  from the VA.
[01:35:20.772 --> 01:35:21.492]  They were cheating him.
[01:35:21.512 --> 01:35:22.553]  He never asked for help.
[01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:25.813]  And his neighbor called us.
[01:35:26.473 --> 01:35:28.054]  This is about, this is in 1998.
[01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:33.675]  His neighbor calls and goes, look, he's got like an acre of land, a little under an acre.
[01:35:33.795 --> 01:35:36.075]  It's worth, you know, 500,000 bucks.
[01:35:36.555 --> 01:35:38.015]  An area that was gentrifying.
[01:35:38.075 --> 01:35:39.856]  Same story we were talking about last hour.
[01:35:41.176 --> 01:35:43.736]  Some other neighbors that are realtors want the property.
[01:35:45.117 --> 01:35:47.357]  And they're trying to force Joe Campana out.
[01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:49.322]  And his house is in bad repair.
[01:35:49.382 --> 01:35:50.682]  He lives in like a bunker in there.
[01:35:50.742 --> 01:35:51.343]  He's afraid.
[01:35:51.623 --> 01:35:55.825]  When airplanes fly over, he's afraid, because he was bombed and strafed in two different wars.
[01:35:57.205 --> 01:36:00.187]  I wouldn't call him, you know, crazy, but he was eccentric, and that's just right.
[01:36:01.127 --> 01:36:08.491]  You know, and I've talked to a lot of Vietnam vets themselves that, you know, for years after Vietnam, they jump under a table, and a car outside backfired.
[01:36:09.851 --> 01:36:11.072]  And Joe kept to himself.
[01:36:11.092 --> 01:36:12.733]  He died a couple years ago.
[01:36:13.793 --> 01:36:15.874]  But this is going back about eight years ago.
[01:36:16.334 --> 01:36:17.135]  Seven, eight years ago.
[01:36:19.242 --> 01:36:21.023]  And so we went out there to fix the house.
[01:36:21.683 --> 01:36:22.263]  I'd heard about it.
[01:36:22.283 --> 01:36:24.444]  We go out there, find out, get the letters from the city.
[01:36:25.884 --> 01:36:35.507]  They were fining him for not fixing his house, so then when they took and bulldozed the house, they were even going to take the property for the cost of $14,000 for bulldozing his home.
[01:36:36.447 --> 01:36:37.227]  We said, no way.
[01:36:37.807 --> 01:36:38.848]  We're going to fix this house.
[01:36:38.888 --> 01:36:42.169]  Well, the city shows up and says, you'll be arrested, myself and Mike Hanson.
[01:36:42.789 --> 01:36:44.369]  You'll be arrested if you fix that house.
[01:36:44.449 --> 01:36:46.890]  Mike was a carpenter, is a carpenter.
[01:36:48.061 --> 01:36:51.042]  And we said, all right, we're going to build him a new house.
[01:36:51.323 --> 01:36:52.403]  And it was a city record.
[01:36:52.423 --> 01:37:01.487]  13 days, fully furnished, jacuzzi style, the bathtub, a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom.
[01:37:01.527 --> 01:37:02.347]  A little cottage.
[01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:09.090]  And by the end of the 13 days, we had city council members there announcing that it was all their plan, all their operation.
[01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:11.791]  And veterans groups there begging for money that hadn't even helped him.
[01:37:12.852 --> 01:37:13.712]  But that was fine.
[01:37:13.752 --> 01:37:16.614]  We didn't raise one red cent, by the way, into our coffers.
[01:37:16.634 --> 01:37:17.314]  What we did was,
[01:37:18.228 --> 01:37:20.849]  Because this is such a pure thing to do that was so enjoyable.
[01:37:20.889 --> 01:37:23.989]  We said, okay, use Home Depot, Lowe's, whoever you want.
[01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:28.210]  And all the newspaper clippings are on Infowars.com.
[01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:30.051]  We'd say, all right, we need an engineer.
[01:37:30.651 --> 01:37:31.931]  All right, we need concrete.
[01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:32.851]  We need rebar.
[01:37:33.632 --> 01:37:36.652]  All right, and people would deliver it as we needed it.
[01:37:37.672 --> 01:37:39.993]  And in 13 days, a beautiful little cottage.
[01:37:40.802 --> 01:37:42.703]  Fully furnished, couches, TV.
[01:37:43.223 --> 01:37:46.746]  I mean, and then suddenly builders got involved in the last few days and fully furnished it.
[01:37:46.806 --> 01:37:51.228]  I mean, that place was pretty swanky.
[01:37:51.288 --> 01:37:53.029]  I mean, it was really, really nice.
[01:37:55.171 --> 01:38:02.235]  And then we got money together and, you know, when they bulldoze his house, they wouldn't take the new house we built him.
[01:38:03.115 --> 01:38:10.401]  And then me and Mike were up there interviewing Clive Doyle and how their church had been destroyed.
[01:38:10.421 --> 01:38:11.482]  They didn't even have a chapel.
[01:38:13.103 --> 01:38:16.746]  Federal controlled groups were trying to provocateur and take their land.
[01:38:17.247 --> 01:38:19.008]  So we said, well, we'll build a memorial church.
[01:38:19.088 --> 01:38:30.838]  Well, George Pulliam was the engineer, the architect, the degreed architect, who came and gave 13 days of his time to design and oversee and be the foreman on the house.
[01:38:33.592 --> 01:38:35.113]  Such great people showed up to help.
[01:38:35.173 --> 01:38:37.635]  One guy shot a nail into his knee and didn't get mad.
[01:38:38.575 --> 01:38:40.036]  Just really nice people out there.
[01:38:40.896 --> 01:38:42.737]  And George did all this nice stuff.
[01:38:43.398 --> 01:38:50.182]  And then George helped out every weekend for six months to build a memorial church that seats 400 people in Waco.
[01:38:50.242 --> 01:38:55.504]  Again, we said use Lowe's, Home Depot, or directly bring it to us.
[01:38:56.125 --> 01:39:00.547]  Say we need 65 of the tubes for the concrete pillars.
[01:39:00.987 --> 01:39:01.888]  66 would get delivered.
[01:39:02.947 --> 01:39:04.368]  And then one of them would get broken.
[01:39:04.408 --> 01:39:04.788]  We need to know.
[01:39:04.808 --> 01:39:07.029]  I mean, it was just, it was, it was, talk about providence.
[01:39:07.069 --> 01:39:08.909]  It was a, again, I'm not a Davidian.
[01:39:08.949 --> 01:39:09.930]  George wasn't a Davidian.
[01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:11.751]  He was a Christian, a Baptist, whatever.
[01:39:11.971 --> 01:39:14.572]  The point is, is that, you know, it was wrong what happened.
[01:39:14.612 --> 01:39:15.752]  So we, we did that.
[01:39:17.173 --> 01:39:21.355]  And George got cancer a few years ago, got sick, spent all their money on medical bills.
[01:39:21.835 --> 01:39:27.377]  Uh, when he died, uh, I don't know, four or five, six months ago, they were deeply in debt.
[01:39:28.756 --> 01:39:31.858]  And I spoke at the funeral and we tried to get some support there.
[01:39:31.878 --> 01:39:33.880]  His wife is just a sweetheart.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.463]  His home here in Austin, the roof's falling apart, the house is falling apart.
[01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.646]  We're asking folks to come this Sunday.
[01:39:44.686 --> 01:39:46.307]  Don't bring any materials, they paid for those.
[01:39:46.668 --> 01:39:49.309]  Just help them paint the house, put a new roof on it, fix the gutters.
[01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:55.013]  And joining us is a good friend of George Pulliam's, a good friend of mine, and Stuart Nelson.
[01:39:55.817 --> 01:39:57.198]  Stuart, good to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:39:57.218 --> 01:39:57.839]  Hey, great.
[01:39:57.879 --> 01:39:58.739]  It's great to be on.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:02.923]  It's great that we can jump in and show some love to a true American patriot.
[01:40:03.623 --> 01:40:07.567]  Yeah, he was a great guy, and then he had cancer surgery and died from complications of that.
[01:40:08.327 --> 01:40:08.848]  Poor guy.
[01:40:08.908 --> 01:40:11.230]  Held on for quite a while.
[01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:20.457]  Went into a coma, but the family is in financial trouble, and all we're asking is for some folks to show up that have carpentry skills and to help us fix this house on Sunday, right?
[01:40:20.897 --> 01:40:21.738]  That's right, yeah.
[01:40:21.798 --> 01:40:23.800]  Now, the house is in Pflugerville.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.201]  I can give the address.
[01:40:25.771 --> 01:40:27.172]  Yeah, do that please.
[01:40:27.412 --> 01:40:30.933]  Okay, it's 1-1-0-2 Settlers Valley.
[01:40:31.113 --> 01:40:31.814]  Settlers Valley.
[01:40:31.834 --> 01:40:33.434]  1-1-0-2 Settlers Valley.
[01:40:33.454 --> 01:40:35.675]  It's right behind Pflugerville High School.
[01:40:37.456 --> 01:40:39.557]  Anybody in the Central Texas area will know where that is.
[01:40:39.577 --> 01:40:42.878]  Yeah, we need to put a roof on.
[01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:49.381]  They had all these repairs planned and George got sick and it's just ridiculous, the expenses for everything.
[01:40:50.522 --> 01:40:54.047]  Uh, they're really in debt and got some problems and the house is just a mess.
[01:40:54.387 --> 01:40:59.574]  And, uh, we've got the paint, the roofing materials, card paper, nails, everything ready to go.
[01:40:59.714 --> 01:41:08.785]  And if everybody in the Austin area could just come and give an hour or two or bring up some water, casserole, anything, casserole dish, you know, kind of just
[01:41:09.659 --> 01:41:12.960]  You know, mainly just come and let's get the work done and show them some love.
[01:41:14.021 --> 01:41:17.862]  Well, I was saying I was going to try to be there, but I've got some legal things I've got to do.
[01:41:17.882 --> 01:41:23.965]  I may be there, but if you'll come by the showing tonight, I want to give you a couple hundred dollars, Stuart.
[01:41:24.365 --> 01:41:24.765]  Oh, great.
[01:41:24.925 --> 01:41:25.225]  Okay.
[01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:29.787]  Yeah, I want to do that, but I just never get to see my family.
[01:41:30.427 --> 01:41:34.509]  I have been working a lot lately again, but I'm going to try to come out.
[01:41:35.129 --> 01:41:35.790]  We'll see.
[01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:36.990]  How's the family doing?
[01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:37.750]  They're doing great.
[01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:38.691]  Now, Stuart,
[01:41:40.951 --> 01:41:41.892]  So I understand this.
[01:41:42.192 --> 01:41:55.038]  Give folks your cell phone number as the coordinator of this and then tell us like two or three times the directions and maybe at RadioFreeAustin.org maybe we should post the directions so you guys can do that.
[01:41:55.058 --> 01:41:56.479]  I know you're affiliated with that.
[01:41:57.019 --> 01:41:57.219]  Right.
[01:41:57.559 --> 01:42:00.701]  We need to get that done and tell folks how they can come out.
[01:42:01.101 --> 01:42:07.944]  Okay, from downtown Austin you head north on 35 and you take the I guess the highway 1820
[01:42:09.764 --> 01:42:11.644]  Which runs through Pflugerville.
[01:42:12.384 --> 01:42:14.805]  And you just take a right.
[01:42:16.045 --> 01:42:17.745]  Well, you can grab a map.
[01:42:18.086 --> 01:42:21.266]  Settlers Valley is a real busy street.
[01:42:21.426 --> 01:42:23.206]  And it's right behind Pflugerville High School.
[01:42:23.227 --> 01:42:25.527]  If you look on a map, you can see Pflugerville High School.
[01:42:25.807 --> 01:42:28.307]  And one street behind that is Settlers Valley.
[01:42:28.367 --> 01:42:29.648]  And it's 1102.
[01:42:30.368 --> 01:42:33.208]  Just look for all the dump trucks.
[01:42:33.228 --> 01:42:35.149]  We're going to get started about 7 o'clock.
[01:42:37.389 --> 01:42:42.832]  Because it's going to be easier to put a roof on in the cool than it is in the heat.
[01:42:43.312 --> 01:42:46.653]  A bunch of the guys from Waco, the surviving Branch Davidians, are going to be there.
[01:42:47.054 --> 01:42:48.794]  And that's going to be 7 o'clock in the morning?
[01:42:49.095 --> 01:42:49.415]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:50.055 --> 01:42:51.156]  That's when I'm getting started.
[01:42:51.176 --> 01:42:52.636]  Yeah, I might just come by early.
[01:42:54.677 --> 01:42:55.698]  Please give the address out again.
[01:42:55.858 --> 01:43:01.280]  Okay, it's 1102 Settlers Valley in Pflugerville, Texas.
[01:43:03.345 --> 01:43:04.346]  Settlers Valley.
[01:43:04.386 --> 01:43:13.310]  And my phone number, if you have any questions or if you're listening and you want to just send a check to Nell or whatever, my phone number is Area Code 512-789-5093.
[01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:19.634]  Get that number out again and say a word about George.
[01:43:19.654 --> 01:43:21.114]  Okay.
[01:43:21.134 --> 01:43:22.615]  My phone number is 512-789-5093.
[01:43:33.014 --> 01:43:39.317]  5093.
[01:43:33.354 --> 01:43:39.317]  He was the kind of guy that made me a better man.
[01:43:40.117 --> 01:43:44.879]  He was a man that gave, didn't complain, always had a smile on his face.
[01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:50.441]  When we were working on the church in Waco, I'd smash my finger and he'd always have some joke.
[01:43:50.481 --> 01:43:51.922]  Well, Stewart, you hit the wrong nail.
[01:43:52.462 --> 01:43:53.002]  Just whatever.
[01:43:55.214 --> 01:43:56.155]  Always positive.
[01:43:56.255 --> 01:43:57.937]  Always had a smile on his face.
[01:43:57.997 --> 01:44:02.761]  He was a caring, loving, gentle, compassionate man.
[01:44:04.303 --> 01:44:05.304]  He made me a better man.
[01:44:06.104 --> 01:44:12.831]  I knew George even before we built the Veteran a new house.
[01:44:14.072 --> 01:44:15.113]  Steady record, folks.
[01:44:16.414 --> 01:44:19.297]  Campana got to enjoy that house for about five years before he died.
[01:44:20.393 --> 01:44:23.894]  We're losing so many of those great, great Americans, those World War II vets.
[01:44:24.334 --> 01:44:27.936]  Alright, Stuart, well, come by and see me the night if you can, or have somebody come by.
[01:44:27.956 --> 01:44:36.439]  Okay, and I just want to commend those that joined in in Campana, and joined in in rebuilding the church in Waco, because they came from all over the country in Waco.
[01:44:37.019 --> 01:44:42.361]  And just a real, I don't know, group hug, or pat on the back, some kind of acknowledgement.
[01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:46.823]  It was just terrific for the call to go out, and so many people to respond.
[01:44:46.903 --> 01:44:47.983]  It was just fantastic.
[01:44:48.703 --> 01:44:49.724]  Take care, my friend.
[01:44:49.844 --> 01:44:50.565]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:44:50.745 --> 01:44:52.166]  Alright, uh, yeah.
[01:44:53.507 --> 01:44:57.490]  I tell ya, it's just, we ought to post that video.
[01:44:59.672 --> 01:45:08.679]  I know we got the old TV shows we did where we rebuilt his house, the veteran, and then we, uh, a totally new house, and then what happened to Waco.
[01:45:08.759 --> 01:45:13.003]  And that's old history, ancient history, but it's still very important today.
[01:45:13.603 --> 01:45:15.725]  Alright, thanks for holding, folks, but that is important.
[01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.318]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marilyn.
[01:45:20.098 --> 01:45:22.159]  Marilyn, where are you calling from?
[01:45:22.579 --> 01:45:23.820]  Independence, Missouri.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.280]  Welcome!
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:33.744]  You know, in Independence, our city code compliance goes out and just scrapes bare the property of a 93-year-old World War II veteran.
[01:45:33.784 --> 01:45:34.585]  But you know what?
[01:45:35.045 --> 01:45:44.809]  That 93-year-old veteran was before our city council Monday night, standing up, speaking for individual rights and property rights.
[01:45:45.578 --> 01:45:54.566]  But the point I wanted to make, Alex, is that I think people on the local level oftentimes do not recognize these infringements.
[01:45:55.267 --> 01:45:56.988]  They come in small increments.
[01:45:58.009 --> 01:46:12.582]  For instance, here in Independence, back in 1972, there was a federal grant available if the city would go inside every home in the city and inspect it, look in closets and so forth.
[01:46:13.402 --> 01:46:23.090]  And I organized the petition drive at that time, having been told by a city council member that, oh, if we could bring in 500 signatures, he'd put a stop to it.
[01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:27.853]  So we took in a few thousand, and it was stopped.
[01:46:28.134 --> 01:46:38.762]  In 1976, the city attempted to pass the Missouri Statute 353 provisions in our city, the Urban Redevelopment Corporation Law.
[01:46:38.942 --> 01:46:41.464]  And for those that just joined us, we've got to do this because a lot of listeners
[01:46:42.222 --> 01:46:48.263]  I think average time listening is about 35 minutes this broadcast, so that's about triple most other radio shows still.
[01:46:48.283 --> 01:46:49.704]  A lot of people have missed it.
[01:46:50.224 --> 01:46:57.425]  The Supreme Court ruled this morning they can take your property, not even for eminent domain, but for private corporations to come build on it.
[01:46:58.345 --> 01:47:00.486]  Apartments, houses, you name it.
[01:47:00.966 --> 01:47:02.186]  A very serious case.
[01:47:02.226 --> 01:47:02.566]  Go ahead.
[01:47:02.866 --> 01:47:05.967]  The key to that is the declaration of blight.
[01:47:06.995 --> 01:47:11.699]  uh... in nineteen seventy six week but now they're saying even outside of urban renewal my dear.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:12.460]  Pardon me?
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.882]  They're saying even outside of declaring blight.
[01:47:15.363 --> 01:47:16.083]  I understand that.
[01:47:16.103 --> 01:47:17.605]  This is not a blighted area in Connecticut.
[01:47:17.645 --> 01:47:30.597]  It deals with both the declaration of blight and the definition of public use but now you're saying that private use is public use but they've been in fact implementing that in our city for some time.
[01:47:30.617 --> 01:47:33.159]  They've virtually destroyed the old part of our town
[01:47:33.786 --> 01:47:43.908]  By building a new town with tax increment financing to the southeast of our city, which, you know, has caused the older parts to deteriorate.
[01:47:44.508 --> 01:47:54.710]  Now, our city council, they did have to back down on the urban redevelopment corporation law back in 76 because we petitioned for a public vote.
[01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:56.211]  And we beat it.
[01:47:56.991 --> 01:48:02.872]  But they brought it back a few years later and you know how these things come back until they wear down the opposition.
[01:48:03.707 --> 01:48:08.650]  In 1980, I began serving on our Independent City Council for four years.
[01:48:09.411 --> 01:48:14.894]  And so for that four-year period, I had a founding board.
[01:48:15.034 --> 01:48:22.479]  I had a bully pulpit to fight for some of these things, but it's very hard to sustain it.
[01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:27.873]  When the general citizenry do not see these things as they come in small doses.
[01:48:27.893 --> 01:48:28.253]  That's right.
[01:48:28.413 --> 01:48:41.321]  There's so many few people that are doing all the work, but the good news is, Marilyn, more people are starting to join the ranks, are starting to do more than just talk, and it's women like you and men out there like you that are saving this country.
[01:48:41.361 --> 01:48:42.982]  We'd be in a lot worse position now.
[01:48:43.343 --> 01:48:50.047]  Well, this past Monday night we had three members of the Libertarian Party before our city council to speak
[01:48:51.151 --> 01:49:06.547]  In opposition to the city's attempt to place in our city code a clause that said if you have a major casualty loss on your property, they can withhold from your insurance company 25% of your claim payment.
[01:49:07.661 --> 01:49:09.242]  So, that's our battle at the moment.
[01:49:09.262 --> 01:49:11.544]  There's just all sorts of highway robbery going on.
[01:49:11.584 --> 01:49:15.447]  Well, we're on there for five years in independence, going into KC.
[01:49:15.948 --> 01:49:17.429]  Great folks listening.
[01:49:17.469 --> 01:49:24.474]  Unfortunately, today the first hour of your program was not broadcast on our local station, but I was able to pick it up on shortwave.
[01:49:24.794 --> 01:49:25.335]  Yeah, I know.
[01:49:25.355 --> 01:49:31.640]  KCXL, some days carries three, some days two, some days one, but they've been carrying us for five years and we love them.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.361]  Well, encourage your listeners.
[01:49:34.281 --> 01:49:36.843]  To take a great interest in their local government.
[01:49:36.883 --> 01:49:40.024]  That's where we average folks have a chance of making a change.
[01:49:40.504 --> 01:49:49.268]  And no matter what the Supreme Court says, that they are allowed to do, we can apply political pressure to stop them from doing it at the local level.
[01:49:49.728 --> 01:49:50.269]  Good job.
[01:49:50.329 --> 01:49:51.209]  Good to hear from you.
[01:49:51.609 --> 01:49:54.871]  We'll be right back with a lot of other calls in a ton of news.
[01:49:56.632 --> 01:49:59.513]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:50:00.223 --> 01:50:01.524]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:50:01.724 --> 01:50:07.469]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:12.993]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction-solution.
[01:50:13.293 --> 01:50:17.457]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:17.617 --> 01:50:21.400]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:26.284]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:26.404 --> 01:50:29.126]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:29.426 --> 01:50:32.608]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[01:50:32.668 --> 01:50:34.549]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:34.989 --> 01:50:37.070]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:39.752]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:39.892 --> 01:50:42.773]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:48.797 --> 01:50:50.798]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[01:50:51.018 --> 01:50:52.559]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:52.719 --> 01:50:54.800]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:55.848 --> 01:51:01.074]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:51:01.214 --> 01:51:09.304]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:09.564 --> 01:51:16.612]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:16.792 --> 01:51:18.073]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:18.153 --> 01:51:24.037]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:24.237 --> 01:51:29.321]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:38.307]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.

[01:51:58.599 --> 01:52:01.080]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:05.081]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:52:05.381 --> 01:52:10.223]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:52:10.564 --> 01:52:11.264]  Don't wait for when.
[01:52:11.504 --> 01:52:12.624]  It's important to act now.

[01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:47.513]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[01:52:58.698 --> 01:52:59.158]  Don't worry.
[01:52:59.679 --> 01:53:01.220]  This show is documented.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.442]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.882 --> 01:53:08.445]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:08.825 --> 01:53:13.008]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:13.448 --> 01:53:17.651]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:53:18.651 --> 01:53:20.032]  The ring of fire.
[01:53:20.172 --> 01:53:20.713]  Welcome back.
[01:53:21.313 --> 01:53:21.953]  And it's burning.
[01:53:21.993 --> 01:53:24.795]  We are now accelerating, blasting towards the third hour.
[01:53:24.815 --> 01:53:25.636]  The ring of fire.
[01:53:26.622 --> 01:53:29.543]  Late last night I walked into a hamburger joint.
[01:53:30.424 --> 01:53:31.204]  They eat something.
[01:53:32.184 --> 01:53:32.724]  Restaurant.
[01:53:32.825 --> 01:53:40.688]  And there was in the magazine rack at MIT, a big technology university's monthly magazine.
[01:53:41.728 --> 01:53:44.029]  And it was about the revolution in military affairs.
[01:53:45.613 --> 01:53:53.699]  And last year the Pentagon came out and said the cameras and microphone systems in America were designed by the Pentagon.
[01:53:53.839 --> 01:53:57.061]  It is a control grid to dominate a population.
[01:53:58.522 --> 01:54:00.303]  And they get into this in this article.
[01:54:00.363 --> 01:54:04.106]  And I asked the waitress, I said, can I have this?
[01:54:04.126 --> 01:54:05.046]  She goes, let me go ask.
[01:54:05.106 --> 01:54:06.027]  And the owner comes out.
[01:54:06.067 --> 01:54:06.607]  He was a fan.
[01:54:06.647 --> 01:54:09.169]  He goes, oh, hey, Mr. Jones, yes, you can have my magazine.
[01:54:10.524 --> 01:54:11.925]  So, that's actually out in the car.
[01:54:11.965 --> 01:54:12.665]  I forgot to bring it in.
[01:54:12.685 --> 01:54:16.506]  During a break, I'm going to go out and get it and bring it in the studio and cover some of that.
[01:54:16.566 --> 01:54:18.687]  I mean, it's just right out in the open, folks.
[01:54:18.707 --> 01:54:23.969]  They're going to put that same system in Iraq with the cameras and microphones and this total control grid.
[01:54:23.989 --> 01:54:27.190]  And they admit that in the future, it's about controlling populations.
[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.250]  That's the new freedom.
[01:54:30.011 --> 01:54:31.872]  So, we'll be getting into that.
[01:54:32.372 --> 01:54:38.254]  I really want to get into all these American corporations being bought or about to be bought by Communist China and the torture and all of it.
[01:54:40.636 --> 01:54:43.757]  But let's get some more of the callers out of the way that have been holding so patiently.
[01:54:43.817 --> 01:54:46.177]  A lot of callers from Canada and Texas today for some reason.
[01:54:47.038 --> 01:54:53.639]  Eric in Texas, then Ian in Ontario, George in Texas, and others in Ontario, Canada as well.
[01:54:54.439 --> 01:54:56.480]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Eric.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.120]  How you doing, Hollywood Jones?
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:58.700]  Good!
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:01.181]  This is Eric, Prison Planet contributor.
[01:55:01.741 --> 01:55:04.182]  Have you ever seen a commercial by World Vision?
[01:55:05.982 --> 01:55:07.802]  I've never seen one, but I just want to mention it.
[01:55:07.822 --> 01:55:09.843]  Yeah, I've heard their commercials on the radio.
[01:55:10.978 --> 01:55:21.848]  On Fox News, there was just a flash and I have DVR and I saw a rainbow and some words and I put it back and it was a subliminal less than a second and it said World Vision on it.
[01:55:22.468 --> 01:55:34.158]  But about this new American communism and the stealing of private property, I just think they're pushing to this thing where it's going to be a conflict so what I believe we really have to do is what you've been saying is
[01:55:34.724 --> 01:55:40.466]  We need a triple, quadruple effort to wake up the minds of the people, because when that happens, it's not going to be because we want it.
[01:55:40.766 --> 01:55:47.828]  They're pushing it on us, but the more people we have knowing what this country is supposed to be about, the more people are going to stand up.
[01:55:47.868 --> 01:55:57.952]  Yeah, they don't teach property rights in public schools, so then the next generations, and even these generations to a great extent don't know, but this is so flagrant that people are going to wake up.
[01:55:58.012 --> 01:56:01.353]  And for those that don't know, World Vision is basically a CIA front.
[01:56:02.802 --> 01:56:12.229]  Connected to the Bushes and others that carry out clandestine operations under the guise of aid workers all over Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia.
[01:56:13.029 --> 01:56:15.451]  And yeah, I've heard World Vision ads.
[01:56:16.151 --> 01:56:18.753]  I've heard a World Vision ad on that other Patriot Network.
[01:56:18.773 --> 01:56:24.177]  It blew me away when I heard it a few months ago, and then I didn't hear it anymore, so that was interesting.
[01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:30.261]  People just need to remember, the central tenet of communism, the abolition of private property,
[01:56:30.757 --> 01:56:37.363]  And polling private property is a central tenet of capitalism, which we don't have capitalism here anymore.
[01:56:37.463 --> 01:56:38.964]  It is corporatism, fascism now.
[01:56:38.984 --> 01:56:40.065]  Yeah, it's not free market.
[01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:43.529]  It's a group of gangsters get control of the government and start stealing.
[01:56:43.549 --> 01:56:44.189]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:46.651]  And then they love it when we call for socialism.
[01:56:46.671 --> 01:56:48.793]  You know, the liberals go, oh, socialism will counter them.
[01:56:49.053 --> 01:56:49.994]  No, that's what they want.
[01:56:50.054 --> 01:56:53.958]  They actually fund that to consolidate our wealth so they can suck it out of us.
[01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:56.452]  Really, really good points, my friend.
[01:56:57.732 --> 01:57:02.874]  We don't have time to go to Ian right now, or George, or all the others, but we'll get you in the next hour.
[01:57:02.894 --> 01:57:08.336]  In fact, right when we start the next hour, then in the next segment after that, I'm going to go right into news.
[01:57:08.396 --> 01:57:09.396]  And boy, there is a lot of it.
[01:57:11.777 --> 01:57:16.498]  So prepare yourselves for an ultra-massive news blitz as we go into the third hour.
[01:57:17.279 --> 01:57:24.101]  And please visit the websites, get the materials, get the news articles on the sites, get them out to people, wake folks up.
[01:57:24.978 --> 01:57:27.079]  About 90% of the stuff on the sites is free.
[01:57:27.479 --> 01:57:30.301]  About 10% of course are videos and books and other things.

[01:57:32.742 --> 01:57:33.362]  We'll be right back.

[01:57:55.308 --> 01:57:56.408]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:57.048 --> 01:57:57.908]  You want answers?
[01:57:58.649 --> 01:57:59.549]  Well, so does he.

[01:58:45.879 --> 01:58:51.100]  Alright, masses of news on torture, cloning, you're going to be eating cloned meat on the store shelves soon.
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.801]  Masses of news on what's happening with the economy.
[01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:56.721]  Right now, let's keep going to your calls.
[01:58:56.741 --> 01:58:58.422]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:58:58.442 --> 01:58:59.302]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:59:09.827 --> 01:59:11.268]  Ian in Ontario, Canada.
[01:59:11.368 --> 01:59:12.069]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:59:12.509 --> 01:59:13.250]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:14.091 --> 01:59:26.501]  This morning I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming decision early next week, I understand, from the Supreme Court in Washington on the Ten Commandments issue in the courts of your country.
[01:59:27.041 --> 01:59:35.668]  And I thought it might be a little off topic, but I think it's right on topic because the Supreme Court this morning delivered a decision which effectively throws out
[01:59:36.343 --> 01:59:44.427]  One of the Ten Commandments, the Tenth Commandment, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's property, and it leaves the Eighth Commandment, thou shalt not steal, hanging by a shred.
[01:59:45.568 --> 01:59:47.389]  I wonder if the season is the reason.
[01:59:48.249 --> 01:59:58.355]  If you reckon from the Passover weekend of Easter, today Moses would be coming down off the mountain with the tablets of the Ten Commandments.
[01:59:58.515 --> 02:00:04.558]  I think the Supreme Court is delivering a whole new law of commandments, little by little.
[02:00:05.382 --> 02:00:12.764]  No, they love to do things through symbolism and I mean, they are just butchering the Bill of Rights wholesale!
[02:00:13.664 --> 02:00:18.225]  And for those that just joined us, the Supreme Court ruled they can take your property even if it isn't for public works.
[02:00:18.285 --> 02:00:21.646]  Just some corporation wants it, they can steal it and not even give you the value.
[02:00:22.446 --> 02:00:23.166]  Alex, am I right?
[02:00:23.246 --> 02:00:26.867]  Is the Supreme Court due to bring down a decision on the Ten Commandment issue?
[02:00:27.167 --> 02:00:28.167]  I've heard that discussed.
[02:00:28.207 --> 02:00:30.888]  I've heard they did hear it and it could be out any time.
[02:00:31.568 --> 02:00:31.848]  Wow.
[02:00:32.428 --> 02:00:33.289]  Thanks very much.
[02:00:33.809 --> 02:00:34.209]  Thank you.
[02:00:35.794 --> 02:00:44.241]  I've gotten emails from so-called conservatives who go, George Bush didn't promote the Attorney General of Alabama that went after Judge Roy Moore.
[02:00:45.201 --> 02:00:46.663]  Bush was a forward of the Ten Commandments.
[02:00:46.723 --> 02:00:47.343]  No, he wasn't!
[02:00:49.105 --> 02:00:49.965]  No, that's not true!
[02:00:51.066 --> 02:00:52.907]  I mean, again, you're just living in denial!
[02:00:54.028 --> 02:00:55.029]  Living in denial!
[02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:57.271]  Good points, Ian.
[02:00:57.691 --> 02:00:58.712]  George, in Texas.
[02:00:58.732 --> 02:00:59.413]  George, go ahead.
[02:01:00.153 --> 02:01:00.694]  Yes, Alex.
[02:01:00.814 --> 02:01:04.877]  I think an important point is, during the debate on the House floor,
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:13.624]  When Congressman Ron Paul stood up and said, well let's obey the Constitution and get a declaration of war if we're going to go into Iraq.
[02:01:14.604 --> 02:01:24.689]  And Congressman Henry Hyde, the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the Constitution is an antiquated document and no longer in effect.
[02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:33.674]  Yeah, he said on the floor, I have the Washington Post article, and I never got the video of it, but he said it is an antiquated document and is not part of this debate.
[02:01:34.344 --> 02:01:37.826]  How dare you, in the well of the house, bring up the Constitution!
[02:01:38.106 --> 02:01:39.607]  Think of how radical that is!
[02:01:39.807 --> 02:01:44.830]  That's almost as radical as saying we shouldn't feed rotten animals to cows, that we should feed them grass!
[02:01:45.791 --> 02:01:47.392]  Well, of course, I raise cattle, Alex.
[02:01:47.992 --> 02:01:52.054]  I don't know of any cattle producer that feeds his cattle meat.
[02:01:52.835 --> 02:02:01.700]  Well, sir, a lot of those different types of cubes and different types of feeds that they give them on feedlots are made out of dead animals, sir.
[02:02:02.498 --> 02:02:04.459]  Well, I'll check into that.
[02:02:04.719 --> 02:02:05.500]  No, that's well known.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.200]  You didn't know about that?
[02:02:07.161 --> 02:02:10.322]  You've never heard of blood meal for a calf?
[02:02:11.443 --> 02:02:14.685]  Well, we don't use blood meal or bone meal anymore.
[02:02:14.725 --> 02:02:15.625]  At least I don't.
[02:02:15.866 --> 02:02:16.566]  Of course you don't.
[02:02:16.606 --> 02:02:16.986]  You're good.
[02:02:17.767 --> 02:02:18.627]  Sir, you're in Texas.
[02:02:18.647 --> 02:02:19.768]  We've got enough open range.
[02:02:19.968 --> 02:02:20.989]  Who wants to spend the money?
[02:02:21.469 --> 02:02:22.770]  It's up north where they do this.
[02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:26.292]  I had another point that I wanted to make real quick.
[02:02:26.652 --> 02:02:30.474]  Yes sir, that's what's caused Mad Cow is feeding meat products
[02:02:32.325 --> 02:02:34.548]  I'll describe the process for you on the other side.
[02:02:34.968 --> 02:02:36.571]  I know a little bit about ranching too, brother.
[02:02:37.292 --> 02:02:39.194]  We've got quite a few head of cattle in East Texas.
[02:02:39.695 --> 02:02:40.396]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.416 --> 02:02:41.558]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.741]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:52.001 --> 02:02:53.581]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:53.922 --> 02:02:58.583]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:58.923 --> 02:03:03.365]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:03.785 --> 02:03:07.946]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:08.186 --> 02:03:11.027]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:11.127 --> 02:03:15.768]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[02:05:04.718 --> 02:05:04.998]  I think so.
[02:05:21.721 --> 02:05:22.201]  I think so.
[02:05:48.479 --> 02:06:01.289]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.210 --> 02:06:08.175]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, we're here my friends.
[02:06:08.195 --> 02:06:14.220]  Alright, I'm gonna finish up in a few minutes here with George in Texas.
[02:06:15.632 --> 02:06:18.514]  Then we're going to go to Mark and Michael and John and Terry.
[02:06:19.134 --> 02:06:31.882]  But after I finish up with that caller, that first caller that's been holding that we were just talking to in the last segment, I'm going to get into the latest torture news, the Communist Chinese acquiring or trying to acquire more and more big, staple American companies.
[02:06:32.743 --> 02:06:37.786]  There's just so much here in my stack of stuff we haven't gotten to yet, yet we've been predominantly
[02:06:38.539 --> 02:06:44.041]  Getting into the Supreme Court ruling that we're not just going to take your property for highways or schools or universities.
[02:06:44.061 --> 02:06:45.801]  We're going to take your property for anything we want.
[02:06:46.461 --> 02:06:47.682]  Anything developers want to do.
[02:06:48.622 --> 02:06:50.082]  Just total into private property.
[02:06:50.342 --> 02:06:52.103]  And we're not going to give you fair value for it either.
[02:06:52.743 --> 02:06:53.983]  You know, those corporations want it.
[02:06:54.003 --> 02:06:56.604]  They can offer a price you're willing to pay or they can build it somewhere else.
[02:06:57.284 --> 02:07:00.485]  Huge attack on the foundation of this country, private property.
[02:07:01.725 --> 02:07:03.606]  But the globalists are coming out of the woodwork, folks.
[02:07:03.626 --> 02:07:04.466]  They know they're in trouble.
[02:07:04.486 --> 02:07:05.366]  People are waking up to them.
[02:07:05.386 --> 02:07:07.687]  So they're just trying to overtly flaunt it.
[02:07:08.490 --> 02:07:12.332]  I mean, at every level, they're provocateurs and agents that are attacking patriots.
[02:07:12.372 --> 02:07:15.213]  At every level, they're trying to pass draconian laws.
[02:07:16.014 --> 02:07:16.754]  And passing them.
[02:07:16.774 --> 02:07:18.455]  At every level, they're just flaunting it.
[02:07:19.575 --> 02:07:27.639]  And also, I want to get into this MIT article about the Military Revolution and Affairs, or the Revolution of Military Affairs, about the control grid they're building for us.
[02:07:27.679 --> 02:07:28.460]  I mean, they admit it.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:33.262]  But before we go back to the calls and the news, Debbie Morrow!
[02:07:33.282 --> 02:07:36.583]  I haven't had her on in a few weeks, so now I'm going to have her on a couple times this week.
[02:07:36.603 --> 02:07:37.724]  We're always honored to have her.
[02:07:39.065 --> 02:07:47.008]  But especially because they've come out with a new line of the Black Berkey Super Filters, made in America, with stainless steel housings.
[02:07:47.649 --> 02:07:51.090]  Really beautiful systems at ridiculously low prices.
[02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:56.252]  They also have the other models, the see-through models, that are really nice.
[02:07:56.372 --> 02:07:57.473]  I've bought several of those.
[02:07:58.173 --> 02:07:58.353]  What?
[02:07:58.393 --> 02:07:59.914]  I bought three of those from Debbie.
[02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:02.631]  And give us some as gifts and keep the others.
[02:08:03.291 --> 02:08:05.693]  They do tens of thousands of gallons in their lifetime.
[02:08:05.753 --> 02:08:14.297]  They really cut the garbage out unlike, you know, the cheap filter that comes on your refrigerator or the filter that comes in the coffee maker or the filter that you buy for 50 bucks.
[02:08:15.077 --> 02:08:23.321]  Or you can buy a cheap Indian or Chinese knockoff that's supposedly a gravity filter that admittedly cuts out almost nothing but bad taste.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:26.721]  You just feel the elements of the knockoffs that cost the same amount.
[02:08:27.101 --> 02:08:27.922]  They're like a feather.
[02:08:27.962 --> 02:08:31.203]  You feel a black element or even one of their white British elements they've got.
[02:08:31.523 --> 02:08:32.204]  They are heavy.
[02:08:33.744 --> 02:08:35.105]  Debbie, good to have you on, my dear.
[02:08:35.125 --> 02:08:38.347]  I was told we had Debbie.
[02:08:39.847 --> 02:08:41.168]  Maybe she's having phone lines up.
[02:08:41.208 --> 02:08:42.208]  I'm here, I'm here.
[02:08:42.228 --> 02:08:42.829]  I'm here.
[02:08:42.849 --> 02:08:43.089]  Oh, great!
[02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:46.210]  Hi, I'm sorry I had the phone on mute while I was listening to your program.
[02:08:46.230 --> 02:08:47.511]  Hey, that's okay.
[02:08:47.551 --> 02:08:50.172]  And I go on so long, you never know when I'm going to go to you.
[02:08:51.568 --> 02:08:52.568]  Win by Jones.
[02:08:53.368 --> 02:08:57.229]  Debbie, tell us about the special first off and then the new products.
[02:08:57.729 --> 02:09:16.293]  Well, of course we have our Berkey Light Special, which is the Berkey Light for $259 and for being an Alex Jones listener, they get the Berkey Sport Bottle and an auxiliary battery adapter, which is really handy because this is the time of year we have a lot of power outages.
[02:09:17.358 --> 02:09:31.422]  And you can actually just add four AA batteries and plug it into your Berkey Light Base and it'll give you up to two weeks worth of lighting by using those four AA batteries along with your Berkey Light Base.
[02:09:31.482 --> 02:09:34.243]  So that's a real handy thing to have with it.
[02:09:35.863 --> 02:09:43.926]  It's $2.59 for that Alex Jones Special and to me, I mean, that's one of my favorites because I absolutely love the Berkey Light.
[02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:57.298]  Just so convenient and pretty and you can see your water levels which I think is a huge thing for me because I'm so short and it's hard for me to peek into the top and see if it's full or not.
[02:09:57.859 --> 02:10:07.905]  But for those people who really love stainless steel we now have our own stainless steel Made in America products and
[02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:16.561]  You can get them in several different sizes now and with different combinations of the black filters and I'll be glad to go over those with you.
[02:10:17.077 --> 02:10:18.297]  Anyone that calls in.
[02:10:18.637 --> 02:10:24.739]  We're really excited about finally getting stainless steel available with our Made in America filters.
[02:10:24.959 --> 02:10:29.541]  Now what about that just crazy good deal, which I would have gotten that a few years ago.
[02:10:29.561 --> 02:10:32.441]  I mean, I got a good deal, but not that inexpensive.
[02:10:32.922 --> 02:10:39.463]  I mean, when I bought a big murky, just a two gallon from a dealer, I paid like 320 bucks five years ago.
[02:10:39.523 --> 02:10:41.344]  You guys have got a three gallon
[02:10:42.777 --> 02:10:46.460]  Stainless for $225?
[02:10:47.661 --> 02:10:48.481]  That is correct.
[02:10:49.322 --> 02:10:54.987]  And, excuse me, it can expand to four filters if they want, you know, later.
[02:10:55.007 --> 02:10:58.270]  How many gallons a day would four do?
[02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:03.334]  Four gallons a day, well, it would do, but it would fill up in an hour, first of all.
[02:11:03.394 --> 02:11:05.656]  So, I mean, you know, you could get, you know,
[02:11:06.232 --> 02:11:11.837]  Three gallons every hour if you stood over it and kept it full.
[02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:12.598]  So 24 times 3.
[02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:19.404]  Yeah, so it's like 75 gallons a day if you continually kept filling it and taking it apart.
[02:11:19.484 --> 02:11:24.709]  So if you owned a restaurant, you could filter all the water you use to cook food.
[02:11:26.212 --> 02:11:26.872]  Absolutely.
[02:11:27.293 --> 02:11:30.475]  And we also have the 5 and 6 gallon Berkey.
[02:11:30.595 --> 02:11:33.556]  But the Berkey you're talking about is only about 2 feet tall.
[02:11:33.877 --> 02:11:34.397]  That's right.
[02:11:34.637 --> 02:11:36.218]  So it goes in the corner.
[02:11:36.538 --> 02:11:36.998]  It's great.
[02:11:37.058 --> 02:11:38.199]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[02:11:38.219 --> 02:11:39.080]  A bunch of different specials.
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:40.881]  If the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[02:11:40.901 --> 02:11:41.701]  She'll call you right back.
[02:11:42.181 --> 02:11:45.103]  Or one of the other great gals in there will.
[02:11:45.123 --> 02:11:45.924]  1-triple-8.
[02:11:48.102 --> 02:12:08.230]  803-4438, 1-888-803-4438, or go to BerkeyWater.com, BerkeyWater.com, and you've got all the specials up there, BerkeyWater.com, or 888-803-4438, and I guess, Debbie, you've got to get with my webmaster, we need to get all these new specials up on M4.
[02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:14.632]  Right, we do, and people can link on to our new products under BerkeyWater.com, and they can see the new products.
[02:12:15.072 --> 02:12:22.056]  Another thing I do want to remind people, I've had several people call me and ask me about storing water recently.
[02:12:22.076 --> 02:12:24.638]  And they ask me, you know, how do I do it?
[02:12:25.038 --> 02:12:29.461]  You know, what do I do for precautionary to have extra water this time of year?
[02:12:30.021 --> 02:12:34.004]  And I'd like to just remind people that I keep barrels in my backyard.
[02:12:34.841 --> 02:12:39.723]  And you know, I have those big blue barrels and I have them full of water and you're changing them out once a year.
[02:12:40.183 --> 02:12:41.923]  Put a cup of chlorine bleach in it.
[02:12:41.963 --> 02:12:46.805]  And I just wanted to remind people that those are really great ways to have extra water.
[02:12:47.165 --> 02:12:50.606]  But don't filter the water before you fill them.
[02:12:50.626 --> 02:12:52.667]  You filter the water as you go.
[02:12:52.867 --> 02:12:53.307]  Exactly.
[02:12:53.347 --> 02:12:54.327]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:12:54.347 --> 02:12:55.107]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:55.488 --> 02:12:56.048]  God bless.
[02:12:56.088 --> 02:12:58.208]  And that number, if you missed it, 888-803-4438.
[02:12:58.689 --> 02:13:02.630]  Alright, as the caller we were talking to earlier,
[02:13:04.201 --> 02:13:05.501]  George in Texas, he still there?
[02:13:06.102 --> 02:13:07.562]  George, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[02:13:07.582 --> 02:13:08.162]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:08.422 --> 02:13:21.987]  Okay, the second point I wanted to make, I've been involved a lot in private property rights issues in the past because where I used to live, I had a red-cockaded woodpecker in the area and it blocked me from getting a power line down to my property.
[02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:32.611]  But the point I'm trying to make is on these condemnation type lawsuits, there is no jury trial allowed.
[02:13:32.891 --> 02:13:33.711]  The Supreme Court
[02:13:34.275 --> 02:13:37.097]  They made a ruling, oh, about 80 years ago.
[02:13:37.117 --> 02:13:39.600]  Yeah, they have their own little special courts.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:40.761]  Right.
[02:13:40.941 --> 02:13:50.269]  Well, but what I'm getting at is, even if you were to appeal it, there will never be a jury trial on a condemnation suit like this.
[02:13:51.258 --> 02:13:59.201]  I know, and like predators, they're incrementally out there feeding on people and we don't help our neighbor when it's happening to them, then it happens to us and nobody helps us.
[02:13:59.241 --> 02:14:00.421]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:04.622]  As if things weren't already bad enough, now they're expanding it, my friend.
[02:14:05.062 --> 02:14:12.205]  Well, it's expanding and they are taking jury trials away from a lot of criminal proceedings.
[02:14:13.205 --> 02:14:19.507]  I testified back in May in the Texas Senate against the Animal ID Bill
[02:14:20.267 --> 02:14:20.687]  We're good to go.
[02:14:40.566 --> 02:14:42.167]  With cattle from foreign countries.
[02:14:42.427 --> 02:14:44.409]  Exactly, thanks for the call.
[02:14:44.749 --> 02:14:45.429]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:45.469 --> 02:14:46.190]  Great points, sir.
[02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:46.970]  We've got to move on.
[02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:50.653]  I mean, look, it's all over the local paper that whooping cough is exploding.
[02:14:51.253 --> 02:14:52.174]  And I couldn't believe it.
[02:14:52.234 --> 02:14:54.215]  They even admitted that it's illegal aliens.
[02:14:54.956 --> 02:14:58.218]  They had one example of 150-something living in one house.
[02:14:59.739 --> 02:15:02.361]  And whooping cough can kill babies.
[02:15:03.081 --> 02:15:04.202]  But then you look at the
[02:15:05.237 --> 02:15:10.942]  Adverse effects of the whooping cough vaccine, which is famous for having really toxic effects.
[02:15:11.422 --> 02:15:13.744]  Statistically, it's even worse to give that to your child.
[02:15:13.804 --> 02:15:18.448]  Just don't put them in public school next to these illegal aliens, whether it's from Russia or Mexico.
[02:15:18.848 --> 02:15:20.469]  Predominantly, it is Latin America.
[02:15:21.330 --> 02:15:29.116]  I mean, we've now got 7,000 cases that came out two weeks ago in the last year of leprosy.
[02:15:29.777 --> 02:15:31.999]  And before that, they'd have like five cases a year.
[02:15:34.285 --> 02:15:36.686]  7,000 cases of leprosy?
[02:15:37.947 --> 02:15:41.769]  And yeah, they're bringing in all this cattle from England and places where they've had foot and mouth.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:51.395]  I mean, it's just a matter... They had drills with the British Army four years ago in Texas and Minnesota of taking over and killing our cows with foreign troops!
[02:15:52.115 --> 02:15:54.276]  Just type that in, you'll get Dallas Morning News!
[02:15:54.296 --> 02:15:57.098]  I mean, you can't make stuff this weird up, folks.
[02:15:59.170 --> 02:16:00.611]  You cannot make stuff this weird up.
[02:16:00.651 --> 02:16:05.254]  I mean, I got the Richmond, Virginia article, AP, yesterday about martial law.
[02:16:05.774 --> 02:16:07.015]  Well, there's too much crime.
[02:16:07.035 --> 02:16:12.839]  Well, the crime rate's actually down six plus percent, and even more than that from last year, but so what?
[02:16:13.119 --> 02:16:14.100]  One shooting's enough.
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:25.067]  You know, we got gangs here, and we gotta have checkpoints and no more freedoms and curfews for everybody in Richmond, Virginia, because... because of the gangs!
[02:16:28.419 --> 02:16:32.140]  This is how they do it, and the caller is absolutely right.
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:32.480]  All right.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:38.161]  We're going to break here in a minute, and I'm going to start plunging into the news as long as it takes.
[02:16:38.361 --> 02:16:39.521]  It'll probably take 15 minutes.
[02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:41.121]  With the breaks, about 20.
[02:16:41.561 --> 02:16:44.502]  But at about 40 after, we should start going to your calls if you want to hold.
[02:16:45.722 --> 02:16:48.663]  Mark and Michael and John and Terry and many others.
[02:16:48.683 --> 02:16:48.883]  800-259-9231.
[02:16:48.923 --> 02:16:54.504]  But I do need to get into this stack of stuff, as Lord Limbaugh calls it.
[02:16:54.524 --> 02:16:55.924]  And boy, is it a stack of stuff.
[02:16:57.551 --> 02:16:57.811]  U.S.
[02:16:57.851 --> 02:16:59.552]  uncovers torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:16:59.812 --> 02:17:01.013]  Well, so does the United Nations.
[02:17:01.053 --> 02:17:03.674]  So now, if you talk about torture being bad, you're with the U.N.
[02:17:03.915 --> 02:17:06.416]  Pentagon sued by soldier over Gitmo beating.
[02:17:08.217 --> 02:17:22.046]  Also, Financial Times of London, Supreme Court, another little gift they're going to give us, set to rule that they can put cloned food, cloned beef, poultry, pork, cloned milk, cloned animals on your store shelves.
[02:17:22.546 --> 02:17:25.688]  That revolution in military affairs, I want to read a little bit of that.
[02:17:27.365 --> 02:17:30.108]  And, uh, also, uh, take some of your calls a little bit later.
[02:17:30.689 --> 02:17:37.796]  So stay with us, and it's all on... Well, that MIT article isn't on the website yet, but I think I'm gonna try to find it online and put it on there.
[02:17:38.257 --> 02:17:43.842]  But all the other stuff is on InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:44.283 --> 02:17:46.145]  Stay with us, we'll be right back on the other side.
[02:17:48.251 --> 02:17:49.732]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:17:50.012 --> 02:17:54.614]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:54.935 --> 02:17:57.276]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:57.516 --> 02:17:59.057]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:59.417 --> 02:18:04.580]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:06.040]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:08.802]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:09.202 --> 02:18:15.127]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering a 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:15.207 --> 02:18:16.128]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:16.168 --> 02:18:16.408]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:19.331]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:28.759 --> 02:18:35.407]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:35.647 --> 02:18:36.308]  Get the map.
[02:18:36.328 --> 02:18:38.730]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[02:18:38.951 --> 02:18:39.952]  The time is now.
[02:18:40.292 --> 02:18:41.253]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:43.195 --> 02:18:46.299]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:18:47.609 --> 02:18:50.891]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:50.931 --> 02:18:55.134]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:55.374 --> 02:18:58.155]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:58.356 --> 02:19:00.757]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:00.937 --> 02:19:09.582]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:09.783 --> 02:19:11.123]  The Brookie light is different.
[02:19:11.323 --> 02:19:15.486]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:15.806 --> 02:19:16.267]  We're good to go!
[02:19:47.689 --> 02:19:50.213]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:50.894 --> 02:20:00.468]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:01.528 --> 02:20:11.074]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:20:12.095 --> 02:20:17.579]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:20:49.594 --> 02:20:53.176]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[02:20:53.296 --> 02:20:53.676]  Shocking?
[02:20:53.776 --> 02:20:54.236]  Of course!
[02:20:54.496 --> 02:20:56.558]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[02:20:56.718 --> 02:20:59.620]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:01.180]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[02:21:48.958 --> 02:21:54.141]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:54.781 --> 02:21:57.082]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:04.865 --> 02:22:06.726]  Alright, let's plunge into the news here.
[02:22:08.507 --> 02:22:10.449]  W-B-O-Y-T-V.
[02:22:10.589 --> 02:22:14.391]  Police use a taser on an 82-year-old man.
[02:22:15.011 --> 02:22:23.536]  On Saturday morning, 82-year-old Alfred Jim Edwards reportedly urinated in Martins Ferry City Park.
[02:22:24.457 --> 02:22:30.861]  Police say they questioned him about the urinating and he started to walk away several times and finally they say
[02:22:31.716 --> 02:22:32.698]  He resisted arrest.
[02:22:32.758 --> 02:22:34.682]  Police then used a taser on the man.
[02:22:35.323 --> 02:22:37.928]  Edwards' family says he has, uh, dementia.
[02:22:38.658 --> 02:22:41.860]  And he was frightened and confused, but never combative.
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:54.646]  Martins Ferry Police Chief Barry Carpenter called the FBI in to investigate who will whitewash or federalize the city, and they say if they find there was excessive force or civil rights violations, the officer will face discipline.
[02:22:55.047 --> 02:22:56.648]  Why are the feds the arbiters?
[02:22:56.708 --> 02:22:59.589]  Why is it designed where the cities always call the feds in?
[02:22:59.649 --> 02:23:03.051]  See, that's... and then they federalize your city and there's so many problems.
[02:23:04.224 --> 02:23:06.786]  I mean, these are the guys that burn down buildings full of children.
[02:23:06.806 --> 02:23:10.069]  It's like asking Satan in to investigate Beelzebub.
[02:23:10.349 --> 02:23:11.130]  Or Baphomet.
[02:23:13.052 --> 02:23:14.153]  Or Garen.
[02:23:15.314 --> 02:23:17.335]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[02:23:18.516 --> 02:23:21.719]  And, uh, folks, I have a friend who has diabetes.
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:23.921]  Sixty-something years old.
[02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:25.723]  I should say, I had a friend.
[02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.604]  He died a few years ago of diabetes.
[02:23:29.226 --> 02:23:32.008]  And he was on a walk on a greenbelt in Houston.
[02:23:32.628 --> 02:23:34.189]  Out in the middle of nowhere with his family.
[02:23:34.289 --> 02:23:35.269]  This is a good guy.
[02:23:35.329 --> 02:23:36.030]  Was a good guy.
[02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.470]  Chuck.
[02:23:37.891 --> 02:23:39.291]  You know, worked at a chemical plant.
[02:23:39.371 --> 02:23:40.092]  You know, nice guy.
[02:23:40.132 --> 02:23:40.512]  Veteran.
[02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:43.293]  And man, you know, he's got diabetes.
[02:23:43.333 --> 02:23:44.754]  When he's gotta go, he's gotta go.
[02:23:44.794 --> 02:23:46.134]  And so he was urinating.
[02:23:47.435 --> 02:23:48.316]  Cops arrested him.
[02:23:49.236 --> 02:23:50.056]  Now, come on folks.
[02:23:50.076 --> 02:23:51.157]  I remember when I was a child.
[02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:53.117]  Uh, everybody did it.
[02:23:53.657 --> 02:24:03.702]  You know, out on some rural highway with a gas station every 70 miles, I mean, you'd see cars pulled over, you'd see trucks pulled over, you'd go and you'd wee-wee in the bushes.
[02:24:04.983 --> 02:24:06.864]  Again, they arrest you for this now, folks.
[02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:11.446]  Well, so I don't, I mean, you know, you better not do it or you'll get arrested.
[02:24:12.127 --> 02:24:17.370]  I mean, I many times have been driving even faster, you know, 80 miles an hour to get to a gas station when I'm on some road trip.
[02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:19.851]  Because I'm not about to pull over and go to jail.
[02:24:19.871 --> 02:24:21.512]  Man, they see you in the blue, you're going to jail!
[02:24:22.643 --> 02:24:25.104]  I guarantee you that cop, when he was a kid, did the same thing.
[02:24:25.544 --> 02:24:26.804]  Things are changing, folks.
[02:24:28.865 --> 02:24:29.905]  Everything is a crime.
[02:24:29.965 --> 02:24:31.246]  Everything is evil, we do.
[02:24:32.046 --> 02:24:35.127]  But this old fella has dementia, has Alzheimer's, it's admitted.
[02:24:35.907 --> 02:24:43.169]  And he's out there, you know, and had to relieve himself, so went to the bathroom, and the cops are so dumb, they don't know.
[02:24:44.210 --> 02:24:50.992]  There's cases every week that I see where they taser somebody with a 65 IQ who's so retarded they can't even say what their name is.
[02:24:51.855 --> 02:24:53.076]  Answer my question, who are you?
[02:24:53.096 --> 02:24:56.418]  And the person obviously has extreme down syndrome.
[02:24:57.018 --> 02:24:58.699]  And the person can't even talk.
[02:24:58.719 --> 02:25:01.701]  They get scared and start running.
[02:25:03.302 --> 02:25:03.702]  Tasers.
[02:25:04.642 --> 02:25:05.223]  They fall down.
[02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.604]  I mean, what is wrong with you?
[02:25:07.404 --> 02:25:09.765]  Some retarded kid and you taser him in the back?
[02:25:11.146 --> 02:25:11.767]  What's your name?
[02:25:11.787 --> 02:25:13.548]  You know, there was a case where the guy's choking.
[02:25:13.788 --> 02:25:14.808]  They call the ambulance.
[02:25:14.828 --> 02:25:15.449]  He's choking.
[02:25:15.489 --> 02:25:15.769]  Help him.
[02:25:16.069 --> 02:25:17.530]  The guy's falling down and stuff.
[02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:18.350]  The cops get there first.
[02:25:18.370 --> 02:25:19.131]  They go, he's choking.
[02:25:19.171 --> 02:25:19.471]  Help him.
[02:25:19.591 --> 02:25:20.912]  Instead of the cop doing the Heimlich.
[02:25:21.747 --> 02:25:22.527]  They taser them!
[02:25:23.188 --> 02:25:27.689]  By the way, a couple years ago I was in La Madeline Restaurant.
[02:25:27.709 --> 02:25:30.130]  It's like a French restaurant.
[02:25:31.770 --> 02:25:39.393]  And I'm in there with my wife and family and I go to the bathroom and I come out, speaking of the evil crime, I go to the bathroom and I come out and I hear all this ruckus.
[02:25:39.813 --> 02:25:42.854]  Everybody's standing around going, oh what do we do, what do we do, what do we do?
[02:25:42.894 --> 02:25:45.615]  And the woman was choking, face is blue, she's stumbling around.
[02:25:46.795 --> 02:25:49.116]  She's choking, coughing, trying to cough it out.
[02:25:49.616 --> 02:25:51.157]  I push everybody aside, grab her,
[02:25:52.136 --> 02:25:53.577]  She had a big chunk of food in her mouth.
[02:25:54.217 --> 02:25:55.197]  We'll get that out of her.
[02:25:56.938 --> 02:25:58.639]  I mean, anybody knows what to do.
[02:25:58.659 --> 02:26:02.580]  Well, I guess I took CPR one time, a quick course.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:03.520]  I guess everybody doesn't know.
[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:07.382]  But the point is, is that the cops probably would have tasered that lady.
[02:26:07.742 --> 02:26:11.043]  My gosh, she's bumbling around, bumping into stuff.
[02:26:11.083 --> 02:26:14.084]  What do you expect to happen when blood gets taken away from the brain?
[02:26:16.205 --> 02:26:17.846]  But that police chief from, um,
[02:26:18.596 --> 02:26:31.880]  Bergen County, Bergen County Police Chief up in New Jersey, he says, oh, well, because people who do go into these shocks or choke or have problems or have diabetes and go into shock, that's why you need a chip we can scan so we know whether to taser you.
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.441]  I mean, see how they've always got some sick thing we need to do?
[02:26:35.461 --> 02:26:39.742]  Alright, I've just spent four minutes on this and I've got a lot of news to cover, but
[02:26:41.377 --> 02:26:43.038]  I'm getting desensitized by the tasering.
[02:26:43.198 --> 02:26:45.059]  I mean, every day we've got like two or three stories.
[02:26:45.499 --> 02:26:48.160]  I've got to instruct my webmaster just to stop putting these up.
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:49.720]  Just to create a section.
[02:26:51.201 --> 02:26:52.101]  A permanent link.
[02:26:52.201 --> 02:26:54.042]  Why have it covered in the news every day?
[02:26:54.082 --> 02:27:02.325]  I mean, it's just, this guy dies, this old lady gets tasered, this five-year-old, this retarded person, this person choking, this Alzheimer's patient.
[02:27:04.186 --> 02:27:10.889]  I mean, you know, because we don't answer your questions exactly right while we're choking, or because we're retarded, or you taser us.
[02:27:12.486 --> 02:27:15.847]  I don't know, we've had a few cases of APD shooting retarded people the last few years.
[02:27:16.367 --> 02:27:18.488]  Maybe it's good they're tasering them instead of killing them.
[02:27:19.808 --> 02:27:20.929]  Oh, you didn't follow my orders!
[02:27:20.969 --> 02:27:21.889]  I'm gonna kill you!
[02:27:22.509 --> 02:27:24.310]  You didn't give a urine sample on order!
[02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:26.031]  I'm gonna taser you twice!
[02:27:26.091 --> 02:27:28.331]  I mean, this stuff is legion!
[02:27:29.292 --> 02:27:30.612]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.792 --> 02:27:33.153]  Masses of news, masses of goals straight ahead.

[02:29:54.293 --> 02:29:55.114]  Read the labels.
[02:29:55.534 --> 02:29:59.675]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:59.875 --> 02:30:04.076]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[02:30:38.292 --> 02:30:56.463]  I'll tell you what, let's get to the revolution in military affairs, which we've been talking about for many years since Colonel Alexander put it out.
[02:31:05.010 --> 02:31:08.831]  And then I'll get into all this other news, then we'll take your calls.
[02:31:09.751 --> 02:31:12.752]  Like I said, I was in a restaurant last night and saw this in the magazine rack.
[02:31:14.292 --> 02:31:15.593]  How tech failed him.
[02:31:15.653 --> 02:31:17.953]  Networking technologies were meant to transform the U.S.
[02:31:17.973 --> 02:31:18.453]  military.
[02:31:18.813 --> 02:31:20.214]  They didn't work in Iraq.
[02:31:20.834 --> 02:31:23.794]  This is MIT's Magazine of Innovation Technology.
[02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:25.935]  And what issue?
[02:31:25.995 --> 02:31:26.515]  November 2004.
[02:31:26.595 --> 02:31:27.075]  So this is old.
[02:31:30.985 --> 02:31:49.355]  Last year there was a report by the Pentagon where they bragged that cameras and microphones, this is called total spectrum dominance, they talk about how the new threat will be domestic populations worldwide during globalization and the birth pains that will cause, and that this is really a military system here in the U.S.
[02:31:49.395 --> 02:31:53.898]  and they even admit Lockheed runs red light cameras and their technicians oversee a lot of this.
[02:31:54.018 --> 02:31:54.778]  It's big money.
[02:31:54.838 --> 02:31:57.380]  Just make us the enemy and tax us to enslave us.
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:58.060]  It's a great system.
[02:31:59.150 --> 02:32:09.961]  But on page 38 inside the article it says, Pentagon maintains that the Iraq war had digital connectivity and many characteristics of networked warfare.
[02:32:09.981 --> 02:32:11.783]  Continues, information is armor.
[02:32:12.944 --> 02:32:16.047]  Military intellectuals call them revolutions in military affairs.
[02:32:16.467 --> 02:32:21.993]  Every few decades a new technology or a new doctrine to use the military jargon
[02:32:22.922 --> 02:32:24.602]  It changes the nature of war.
[02:32:25.082 --> 02:32:30.223]  Single technologies, like gunpowder or nuclear weapons, spur some of these revolutions.
[02:32:30.643 --> 02:32:35.864]  New doctrines, like Napoleonic staff organization or Nazi blitz tactics, drive others.
[02:32:36.404 --> 02:32:46.426]  And some are the result of many simultaneous advances, like airplanes, chemical weapons, and machine guns of World War I, which achieved new rates of slaughter.
[02:32:47.446 --> 02:32:51.407]  But they were still using Napoleonic charge tactics, so you got 20 million dead.
[02:32:52.535 --> 02:32:56.157]  The newest revolution is known to the Pentagon planners as Force Transformation.
[02:32:56.637 --> 02:32:59.239]  Rumsfeld's baby and Marshall's baby.
[02:32:59.619 --> 02:33:15.367]  The idea is that robotic planes and ground vehicles empowered by an ever-expanding range of sensing, targeting, imaging, and communications capabilities, new technologies, would support terms of networked soldiers, teams of networked soldiers, a new doctrine.
[02:33:16.728 --> 02:33:21.731]  But they're too busy, the article goes on, looking at their sensors to ever actually fight and get into the sixth sense.
[02:33:22.631 --> 02:33:26.539]  They don't say that here, but they may admit later that they're too busy with their junk.
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:33.092]  According to its most expansive definition, force transformation is intended to solve the problem
[02:33:33.906 --> 02:33:37.148]  of asymmetrical warfare in the 21st century, where U.S.
[02:33:37.188 --> 02:33:49.193]  forces are not directly confronted by conventional militaries, but rather must quell insurgencies, that's what they're setting up here, destroy terrorist cells, or mitigate regional instability.
[02:33:49.674 --> 02:33:58.278]  Among other things, more nimble network forces could employ tactics like swarming precise coordinated strikes from many directions at once.
[02:33:59.921 --> 02:34:03.342]  The technologies driving the force transformation are incredibly complicated.
[02:34:03.382 --> 02:34:15.367]  It will take at least 31 million lines of computer code to run something called Future Combat Systems, the centerpiece of the Pentagon's transformation effort, an army-run program expanding the cost of more than $100 billion.
[02:34:16.087 --> 02:34:26.751]  We're spending $76 billion in the next six years to create, well, half the military will be drone, half the Air Force and Air Services and the other services.
[02:34:27.703 --> 02:34:29.265]  Other air groups of the other services.
[02:34:29.846 --> 02:34:32.368]  And half of the ground forces will be robotic.
[02:34:32.408 --> 02:34:33.490]  And we read that a few weeks ago.
[02:34:34.971 --> 02:34:37.874]  They said they want them all changed and upgraded by 2014.
[02:34:37.914 --> 02:34:43.801]  And this stuff really will be devastating once it's all integrated.
[02:34:44.862 --> 02:34:49.667]  But they talk about how it's meant to handle guerrilla war, but it doesn't really do that.
[02:34:50.820 --> 02:35:02.531]  Because guerrilla forces, even when you've got ground-penetrating radar drones looking through walls, it's too easy for combatants just to sit still and to, you know, act like non-combatants until you come in on them.
[02:35:04.813 --> 02:35:11.058]  Alright, I don't want to get off into all this, but here they are admitting domestic, you know, controlling populations.
[02:35:11.659 --> 02:35:16.583]  And when they were trying to sell this last year for Iraq to pay for cameras and microphones,
[02:35:17.822 --> 02:35:19.323]  They were trying to push all of this.
[02:35:19.683 --> 02:35:21.925]  They advertised and said, look at America.
[02:35:21.985 --> 02:35:24.106]  Why, we put the system in in America.
[02:35:24.487 --> 02:35:25.928]  This is the military saying this.
[02:35:26.728 --> 02:35:28.109]  Those cameras in your neighborhoods.
[02:35:28.829 --> 02:35:29.470]  Those censors.
[02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:31.631]  This is out of the globe and mail out of Canada.
[02:35:31.691 --> 02:35:33.473]  Smile, you're on a communist camera.
[02:35:34.053 --> 02:35:37.595]  Surveillance in China has gone high-tech, but people are starting to complain.
[02:35:37.976 --> 02:35:39.797]  And in Taiwan, they're rioting over it.
[02:35:40.934 --> 02:35:42.515]  They're not taking national ID cards.
[02:35:42.535 --> 02:35:43.736]  They're refusing in China.
[02:35:44.077 --> 02:35:45.538]  They're refusing to have cameras.
[02:35:45.758 --> 02:35:46.899]  They're actually protesting.
[02:35:47.159 --> 02:35:48.501]  But not in America!
[02:35:48.621 --> 02:35:49.782]  No!
[02:35:50.282 --> 02:35:51.864]  No, because we're so free.
[02:35:53.606 --> 02:36:02.114]  The two young lovers are embracing tenderly in a secluded spot beside Beijing Lake until they notice the video camera hidden behind the tinted glass of what appears to be a lamppost.
[02:36:02.174 --> 02:36:03.195]  We have that here in America.
[02:36:03.455 --> 02:36:03.695]  Fake.
[02:36:04.015 --> 02:36:05.437]  No hidden cameras and transformers.
[02:36:05.979 --> 02:36:08.641]  The all-seeing eye of a camera has them under surveillance.
[02:36:08.661 --> 02:36:12.463]  Dozens of video cameras are dotted around the lake, concealed as street lamps.
[02:36:12.543 --> 02:36:15.825]  Each has a range of 200 meters and can swivel 360 degrees.
[02:36:16.866 --> 02:36:18.367]  A range of 400 feet, folks!
[02:36:19.688 --> 02:36:25.991]  Jen Nye, a 22-year-old secretary, jumps out of his arms of the boyfriend when it is pointed out that the camera is nearby.
[02:36:26.672 --> 02:36:29.334]  It violates our rights, she says angrily.
[02:36:29.714 --> 02:36:29.914]  Ha!
[02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:31.575]  And then it goes into how they're protesting.
[02:36:32.509 --> 02:36:36.932]  Americans, man, they do, they fight, they scream at each other in front of cameras when I'm on the green belt.
[02:36:37.873 --> 02:36:43.938]  Uh, people, uh, you know, uh, are kissing all over the place, just like it doesn't exist.
[02:36:44.939 --> 02:36:51.343]  And forget that, they got the blimps and the helicopters now, as of five years ago, with ground penetrating radar looking right through your walls.
[02:36:51.684 --> 02:36:57.488]  I'm not talking about infrared, folks, that shows the images, you know, foggy images, heat resonance signatures.
[02:36:57.548 --> 02:36:59.490]  I'm talking about crisp images.
[02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:01.011]  Crisp!
[02:37:02.816 --> 02:37:03.516]  That's your freedom!
[02:37:05.497 --> 02:37:06.058]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:06.098 --> 02:37:09.359]  So that's an article that goes along with this, as well as the Richmond article.
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:11.821]  Richmond debates whether to declare a state of emergency.
[02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:22.906]  The mayor said that a local declaration of emergency is used when you want to bring in National Guard, impose curfews, and suspend constitutional rights, and do process procedures.
[02:37:24.447 --> 02:37:26.228]  And we called their office today.
[02:37:26.668 --> 02:37:27.929]  It looks like they may pass it.
[02:37:29.770 --> 02:37:30.350]  Checkpoints.
[02:37:30.431 --> 02:37:30.911]  No rights.
[02:37:30.931 --> 02:37:31.731]  You just heard the mayor.
[02:37:31.791 --> 02:37:32.592]  Martial law.
[02:37:33.232 --> 02:37:34.573]  And the crime rate is down.
[02:37:34.633 --> 02:37:35.414]  Hold on, let me find it.
[02:37:36.334 --> 02:37:37.315]  Pull the article back out.
[02:37:37.335 --> 02:37:41.418]  The crime rate is down 6.7% since last year.
[02:37:41.458 --> 02:37:42.118]  But, oh!
[02:37:42.198 --> 02:37:44.440]  The media says gang warfare is an epidemic.
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:49.123]  So, because some gang members are shooting each other, we better give up all of our freedoms.
[02:37:50.744 --> 02:37:54.307]  So, and it says feds, the government, cameras, checkpoints.
[02:37:54.707 --> 02:37:56.088]  Again, the military grid.
[02:37:56.688 --> 02:37:57.909]  It is a military grid.
[02:37:59.142 --> 02:38:05.365]  I already mentioned police used taser on an 82-year-old Alzheimer's patient who didn't even touch them or resist, just walked away.
[02:38:06.566 --> 02:38:20.012]  China's hair, I love how they give themselves Deutsch names to confuse people, launches bold bid for U.S.
[02:38:20.052 --> 02:38:22.473]  appliance maker, Maytag.
[02:38:23.053 --> 02:38:26.435]  And another display of China's growing economic cloud appliance maker, Haier,
[02:38:27.791 --> 02:38:32.492]  ...has entered the bidding to take over Maytag Corp., a proud but struggling icon of U.S.
[02:38:32.652 --> 02:38:34.593]  white goods industry.
[02:38:36.573 --> 02:38:44.295]  A Chinese oil company offers $18.5 billion for Unicol, whose former vice president now is the dictator of Afghanistan.
[02:38:44.695 --> 02:38:47.856]  A Chinese state-controlled oil company made an $18.5 billion unsolicited cash bid.
[02:38:51.617 --> 02:38:56.619]  Igniting the first ever takeover battle between corporations in China and the United States.
[02:38:56.979 --> 02:39:11.586]  The bold bid by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, that's got the Panama Canal by the way, may be a watershed in Chinese corporate behavior and demonstrates the interesting influence of Wall Street-backed knuckle tactics.
[02:39:11.606 --> 02:39:12.146]  Excuse me.
[02:39:12.924 --> 02:39:24.812]  The increasing influence of Wall Street bare-knuckled tactics in Asia, the offer also illustrates how critical oil and gas resources are to China, given its huge growth already surpassing us this year in economic development.
[02:39:26.233 --> 02:39:27.674]  Oh boy, we're in trouble!
[02:39:28.675 --> 02:39:37.621]  And they're raising all the property taxes, they're setting up systems, bringing in more illegals to drop down wages, saying they can take the home you paid for and not even pay you a paltry sum of what it's worth.
[02:39:39.153 --> 02:39:40.073]  Continuing, U.N.
[02:39:40.133 --> 02:39:42.374]  uncovers torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:39:42.954 --> 02:39:43.975]  Associated Press, U.N.
[02:39:43.995 --> 02:39:48.256]  human rights experts said Thursday they have reliable accounts of detainees being tortured at all U.S.
[02:39:48.296 --> 02:39:49.557]  bases in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[02:39:49.877 --> 02:39:55.879]  The expert also said Washington did not respond to their latest request to check on the conditions of terror suspects at the facility in eastern Cuba.
[02:39:56.299 --> 02:39:57.620]  That request was made in April.
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:57.900]  U.S.
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:40:03.262]  officials have so far allowed only their National Committee of the Red Cross to visit Guantanamo detainees, and they said it was torture.
[02:40:03.722 --> 02:40:03.962]  The U.N.
[02:40:04.002 --> 02:40:07.063]  human rights investigations have been trying to visit, and so too.
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:09.940]  Now, let's just stop right there.
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:15.502]  I went and printed the UN's ICRC report this morning.
[02:40:15.522 --> 02:40:16.362]  I scanned over it.
[02:40:17.703 --> 02:40:28.586]  They don't... See, whenever you can tell something's a shill operation or a foil, a fake attack is when... They don't mention Rick Baucus, the general, quitting, refusing to torture.
[02:40:29.106 --> 02:40:32.647]  They don't mention the interrogators and interpreters quitting.
[02:40:33.227 --> 02:40:36.988]  They don't mention members of the staff saying they were beat up and abused.
[02:40:38.129 --> 02:40:42.152]  They don't mention Alberto Gonzales' own statements.
[02:40:42.433 --> 02:40:43.473]  See, it's all semantical.
[02:40:43.754 --> 02:40:47.737]  Oh, we don't torture, but torture, it isn't even torture to beat someone to death.
[02:40:48.958 --> 02:40:50.619]  See, so they just don't call that torture now.
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:53.601]  It's like Bush says there'll be no more amnesty.
[02:40:55.383 --> 02:40:58.465]  He's just going to legalize everyone, but that's not amnesty, so it's not amnesty.
[02:40:58.626 --> 02:40:59.766]  No, it's just total legalization.
[02:41:00.707 --> 02:41:05.051]  So by doing this now, see, you're with the UN if you're against the torture.
[02:41:05.231 --> 02:41:06.672]  Oh, well you must be a UN lover.
[02:41:07.310 --> 02:41:07.890]  Meanwhile, the U.N.
[02:41:07.970 --> 02:41:09.551]  is conducting torture all over the planet.
[02:41:10.011 --> 02:41:12.472]  And then they'll bring forward fake evidence and be discredited.
[02:41:14.773 --> 02:41:15.554]  They never stop.
[02:41:16.174 --> 02:41:16.554]  U.N.
[02:41:16.654 --> 02:41:18.515]  uncovers torture at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:41:18.575 --> 02:41:19.876]  So that article is there for you.
[02:41:20.576 --> 02:41:22.817]  Al Jazeera reports, Pentagon sued by U.S.
[02:41:22.877 --> 02:41:24.238]  soldier over Gitmo beating.
[02:41:24.338 --> 02:41:29.140]  Our comment is, if they're doing this to their own people, just imagine what they're doing to the Muslims.
[02:41:30.131 --> 02:41:38.776]  An American soldier who was seriously beaten when he posed as a foreign detainee during a training drill at Guantanamo is suing the Pentagon for $15 million.
[02:41:39.996 --> 02:41:48.200]  Special Sean Baker was medically retired from the military after he suffered a traumatic brain injury.
[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:50.742]  I mean, they stomped him so hard in 2003.
[02:41:51.202 --> 02:41:58.786]  A 38-year-old military policeman, I guess, I mean, is he with Al-Qaeda too, was assaulted after he volunteered to wear an orange jumpsuit and portray an
[02:41:59.682 --> 02:42:00.782]  Cooperative detainee.
[02:42:01.422 --> 02:42:06.824]  Baker said his fellow MPs were told that he was an unruly detainee who had been assaulting an American sergeant.
[02:42:07.144 --> 02:42:12.345]  Severely beat him, leaving him with seizures, blackouts, headaches, insomnia, and psychological problems.
[02:42:12.845 --> 02:42:17.106]  The Army had to give him full medical discharge and funds because it's true.
[02:42:17.126 --> 02:42:18.667]  The lawsuit filed in the U.S.
[02:42:18.707 --> 02:42:20.407]  District Court in Lexington, Kentucky.
[02:42:20.447 --> 02:42:24.488]  Baker asked the Army to reinstate him in a position that would accommodate his medical condition.
[02:42:24.928 --> 02:42:27.149]  The Army put him on medical retirement against his wishes.
[02:42:29.111 --> 02:42:30.652]  So, I mean, that's the freedom!
[02:42:30.692 --> 02:42:33.553]  We talked about this about a year ago, when it first came out.
[02:42:34.333 --> 02:42:35.994]  I mean, boy!
[02:42:36.534 --> 02:42:39.656]  They've had a whole bunch of deaths in there, but they claim they're natural deaths.
[02:42:41.056 --> 02:42:42.557]  Lots of suicide attempts.
[02:42:45.978 --> 02:42:56.643]  And by the way, whenever they bust one of their people that tortured somebody to death, they'll speak out, and then they'll arrest them, their own guards, and charge them under the Patriot Act, where they can't defend themselves.
[02:42:57.879 --> 02:43:03.802]  Oh yeah, did you know they're charging guards in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other areas where they have over a hundred camps.
[02:43:04.142 --> 02:43:08.364]  When they beat somebody to death and somebody finds out, they get in trouble and then they go to jail.
[02:43:09.064 --> 02:43:10.685]  And then they can't even have a regular trial.
[02:43:11.445 --> 02:43:15.487]  So you better think about that out there listening.
[02:43:15.547 --> 02:43:15.687]  U.S.
[02:43:15.727 --> 02:43:18.188]  poised to rule on cloned livestock, meat and milk.
[02:43:18.248 --> 02:43:19.489]  This is Financial Times of London.
[02:43:20.049 --> 02:43:24.971]  Meat and milk cloned from farm animals is about to be declared safe and the evidence shows it's not safe.
[02:43:25.748 --> 02:43:29.150]  It changes the proteins in the meat for human consumption by the U.S.
[02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:31.931]  Food and Drug Administration, one of the world's most powerful regulatory bodies.
[02:43:32.671 --> 02:43:40.095]  A favorable risk assessment from the FDA is expected to start the commercial exploitation of cloning to improve livestock quality around the world.
[02:43:40.655 --> 02:43:51.740]  FDA officials told the Bio05 Biotech Industry Conference that they had completed a four-year assessment process and concluded that cloned animals and their progeny would be safe to eat as conventional bred animals.
[02:43:52.310 --> 02:43:56.155]  They also found that cloning was acceptable for the viewpoint of animal welfare.
[02:43:56.236 --> 02:43:59.941]  Scientists said the first pork and beef from cloned animals could reach the market next year.
[02:44:00.041 --> 02:44:05.769]  John Matheson, Senior Regulatory Scientist at the FDA, said that uncertainty in U.S.
[02:44:05.809 --> 02:44:09.434]  government about the ethics of cloning had delayed publication of the assessment.
[02:44:11.514 --> 02:44:13.576]  The FDA's bought and paid for by these people.
[02:44:14.396 --> 02:44:17.119]  Continuing, Rove criticizes liberals on 9-11.
[02:44:17.399 --> 02:44:31.110]  See, now you're a liberal, if you... Karl Rove came to the heart of Manhattan last night to talk about the decline of liberalism in politics, saying Democrats responded weakly to September 11th and had placed American troops in greater danger by criticizing their actions.
[02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:33.552]  Is that why Bush has a 20-something approval rating?
[02:44:34.324 --> 02:44:39.708]  Conservatives saw the savagery of 9-11, we did see your savage attack, in the attacks and prepared for war.
[02:44:39.788 --> 02:44:47.034]  Liberals saw the savagery of the 9-11 attacks and waited to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.
[02:44:47.134 --> 02:44:48.134]  Pure garbage.
[02:44:48.495 --> 02:44:51.457]  George Bush is a liberal, by all of your yardsticks.
[02:44:52.538 --> 02:44:56.941]  HRP, treating children as young as 4 for bipolar disease.
[02:44:57.722 --> 02:44:58.702]  You didn't get the memo?
[02:44:58.882 --> 02:45:00.223]  It's as young as 18 months.
[02:45:01.644 --> 02:45:06.408]  Two-thirds of foster children plus in Texas are on it, and most other states on an average of four psychotrophics.
[02:45:06.848 --> 02:45:14.575]  A report in the Wall Street Journal should raise serious concerns about the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosing and drug prescribing for children.
[02:45:14.595 --> 02:45:16.477]  The Journal reports that close to 20,000 U.S.
[02:45:16.517 --> 02:45:19.819]  children are being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, much higher than that.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:25.184]  A condition that had until recently been very rarer according to respondents of child psychiatrists.
[02:45:25.604 --> 02:45:37.806]  The number of children diagnosed as bipolar rose 26% from 0-2 to 0-4 to 19,776 cases according to patient records kept by health care information company NDCH Health Corps.
[02:45:38.627 --> 02:45:51.969]  Increasing use of antidepressant medicines such as the Seroquel and Respiradol was a big driver in psychiatric drug costs last year according to pharmacy benefit manager Medco Health Solutions, people that sell this.
[02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:55.010]  Then it goes on to talk about how deadly it is.
[02:45:57.219 --> 02:45:58.120]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:45:59.220 --> 02:45:59.941]  I've got more news.
[02:45:59.981 --> 02:46:00.801]  We'll see if we can get to it.
[02:46:01.662 --> 02:46:02.442]  Mark in Texas.
[02:46:02.462 --> 02:46:03.102]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:46:03.563 --> 02:46:04.103]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:04.643 --> 02:46:05.604]  Hi.
[02:46:05.764 --> 02:46:14.109]  I think you and your readers have noticed that the elite in Britain and the elite in America are doing the same things at the same time to their people.
[02:46:14.629 --> 02:46:17.010]  Almost as if... Same thing in New Zealand, Australia, Canada.
[02:46:17.050 --> 02:46:18.872]  I call it the echelon group of countries.
[02:46:19.352 --> 02:46:21.933]  Well, it's as if they're reading from the same playbook.
[02:46:21.953 --> 02:46:24.375]  And that's, of course, because they are reading from the same playbook.
[02:46:24.395 --> 02:46:26.376]  They've even got programs with the same names, sir.
[02:46:27.137 --> 02:46:35.000]  Okay, well, this program I have in mind was announced this January in the UK to demolish 20,000 homes around Britain.
[02:46:35.681 --> 02:46:47.045]  Nice Victorian homes, they're not blighted, they're just fine, but John Prescott, the Housing Secretary, wants to demolish 20,000 homes and throw those people out on the street.
[02:46:47.525 --> 02:46:52.187]  And not give them, I saw that, give them proper compensation, and now the Supreme Court's saying the same thing here!
[02:46:52.487 --> 02:46:56.109]  Yeah, and so it's just a worldwide phenomenon, and
[02:46:57.458 --> 02:47:00.120]  The Supreme Court tries to abolish private property this morning.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.424]  The lead story on the so-called news networks is this missing girl in Aruba.
[02:47:06.624 --> 02:47:07.165]  It's just crazy.
[02:47:07.225 --> 02:47:13.369]  And people ask why they focus on that because Stalin said one person dying is a tragedy, 10,000 is a statistic.
[02:47:13.909 --> 02:47:17.112]  And so they know that they can create a serial soap opera.
[02:47:18.553 --> 02:47:19.934]  And by the way, their ratings are plummeting.
[02:47:19.974 --> 02:47:21.034]  No one even wants to watch it.
[02:47:21.355 --> 02:47:22.395]  A few weak minds do.
[02:47:22.816 --> 02:47:24.777]  And so that way they get to have filler.
[02:47:27.358 --> 02:47:27.538]  Yep.
[02:47:27.798 --> 02:47:30.359]  And I'm not saying she doesn't have value, but give me a break, folks.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:32.721]  Okay, well, keep up the work.
[02:47:32.901 --> 02:47:33.221]  Goodbye.
[02:47:33.421 --> 02:47:33.821]  Thank you.
[02:47:33.861 --> 02:47:37.103]  Yeah, the media found with the Lindbergh trial that this stuff did get ratings.
[02:47:37.443 --> 02:47:38.623]  Now they know it doesn't get ratings.
[02:47:38.643 --> 02:47:39.844]  They just do it to fill her.
[02:47:41.485 --> 02:47:42.585]  Uh, Michael in Ohio.
[02:47:42.605 --> 02:47:43.165]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:47:43.405 --> 02:47:44.126]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:47:44.406 --> 02:47:44.626]  Hi.
[02:47:45.687 --> 02:47:48.708]  Uh, on the Marshall Law, when did it officially go into effect?
[02:47:50.598 --> 02:47:51.658]  In the 40s or 50s?
[02:47:52.539 --> 02:47:58.860]  In the early 1930s when Roosevelt got in, they began to expand martial law.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.881]  State police are really federal police.
[02:48:00.921 --> 02:48:03.821]  I've got the charters on that, setting up martial law.
[02:48:03.841 --> 02:48:06.982]  They're always just... We've been under martial law for a long time.
[02:48:07.002 --> 02:48:09.703]  We have parallel freedom still running alongside it.
[02:48:09.763 --> 02:48:12.644]  Now they're dismantling the last vestiges of that.
[02:48:12.664 --> 02:48:18.025]  Do congressmen and senators have to be averse to that when they sign any bills into law?
[02:48:18.664 --> 02:48:20.765]  Well, they declare a new state of emergency every year.
[02:48:20.785 --> 02:48:25.227]  So when a person writes to their congressman or senators, they have to check with Marshall Law first?
[02:48:25.988 --> 02:48:26.828]  Yes, since 1933.
[02:48:26.928 --> 02:48:27.829]  Okay, thank you.
[02:48:27.869 --> 02:48:29.470]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:30.970 --> 02:48:33.132]  It's just, oh, we always redeclare the new emergency.
[02:48:33.172 --> 02:48:34.012]  There's always a reason.
[02:48:35.033 --> 02:48:36.133]  Always some pomp reason.
[02:48:36.153 --> 02:48:38.314]  Alright, I'll take a few final calls.
[02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:45.158]  On the other side of this quick transmission, this quick break, don't forget I'll be showing my film next Monday, Automotive Wrapped House, South Lamar.
[02:48:48.777 --> 02:48:56.163]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:56.443 --> 02:49:01.187]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:49:01.407 --> 02:49:07.052]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:07.312 --> 02:49:11.835]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:12.095 --> 02:49:19.200]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:23.703]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:23.923 --> 02:49:26.445]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:26.665 --> 02:49:33.009]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:49:33.129 --> 02:49:34.029]  We're good to go.
[02:49:47.782 --> 02:49:52.406]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:42.931]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:48.072 --> 02:50:54.956]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:50:55.477 --> 02:51:00.900]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:11.326]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:51:11.466 --> 02:51:13.748]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:51:14.188 --> 02:51:17.269]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:51:17.309 --> 02:51:18.870]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:51:19.010 --> 02:51:21.851]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:51:22.171 --> 02:51:26.473]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:51:26.753 --> 02:51:28.454]  It's also money-back guaranteed.

[02:51:41.079 --> 02:51:45.442]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:57.991]  Final segment folks.
[02:51:59.132 --> 02:52:02.595]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Florida.
[02:52:02.635 --> 02:52:03.415]  John, go ahead.
[02:52:03.435 --> 02:52:04.136]  Hello Alex.
[02:52:04.156 --> 02:52:08.679]  Alex, I want to discuss something that ties into
[02:52:09.692 --> 02:52:18.015]  One of the last news articles you read there about the Chinese wanting to buy up Maytag, as well as Unicom, I believe the oil company is?
[02:52:18.695 --> 02:52:19.035]  Yes.
[02:52:19.275 --> 02:52:29.878]  I'm sure earlier this week you were aware that our President had, I believe at the White House, the Prime Minister or the Premier of Vietnam, a communist country?
[02:52:31.339 --> 02:52:31.619]  Yes.
[02:52:32.039 --> 02:52:32.559]  Okay.
[02:52:32.859 --> 02:52:38.981]  I mean, the biggest laugh I had this week was when the pundits were saying how the Vietnamese are going to be buying American products.
[02:52:39.747 --> 02:52:43.129]  Yeah, all that's happening is our industries are moving to slave countries.
[02:52:43.169 --> 02:52:43.589]  Yeah, I know.
[02:52:43.629 --> 02:52:44.370]  Nike's over there.
[02:52:44.390 --> 02:52:55.315]  I mean, I can remember when Henry Kissinger left Paris when peace talks over there during, you know, the Nixon administration and flew off to Beijing to open up, you know, China for the West.
[02:52:55.576 --> 02:52:58.157]  Not only us, the United States, but the West, meaning Europe.
[02:52:59.484 --> 02:53:03.887]  We've seen the gradual relocation of American companies.
[02:53:03.947 --> 02:53:04.388]  Well, Bush Sr.
[02:53:04.408 --> 02:53:09.212]  lived there for years and posed for lots of photos with a picture of Mao with his wife.
[02:53:09.992 --> 02:53:13.936]  They were saying the same... Yeah, this has been a plan, a strategic plan.
[02:53:14.496 --> 02:53:16.918]  They're breaking us economically with China.
[02:53:16.998 --> 02:53:18.940]  Well, they were saying it would democratize China.
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:21.602]  As far as I know, China is still a Red Communist country.
[02:53:22.463 --> 02:53:25.065]  So, you know, I'll invite your comments and whatever on that.
[02:53:25.592 --> 02:53:26.152]  Well, I hear you.
[02:53:26.172 --> 02:53:26.633]  I agree with you.
[02:53:26.653 --> 02:53:27.273]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:27.333 --> 02:53:28.173]  Terry in Texas.
[02:53:28.213 --> 02:53:28.714]  Last caller.
[02:53:28.754 --> 02:53:29.294]  Go ahead, Terry.
[02:53:30.094 --> 02:53:30.754]  It's Charles.
[02:53:31.755 --> 02:53:32.095]  Okay.
[02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:33.056]  Charles in Texas.
[02:53:33.096 --> 02:53:33.536]  Go ahead.
[02:53:33.716 --> 02:53:33.936]  Okay.
[02:53:33.996 --> 02:53:36.117]  I heard you mention World Vision earlier.
[02:53:36.137 --> 02:53:40.219]  Have you ever heard that World Vision had a lot to do with Jonestown?
[02:53:41.359 --> 02:53:41.639]  Yes.
[02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:46.942]  And, I mean, the father of John Hinckley Jr., that supposedly shot Reagan, was the head of World Vision.
[02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:55.226]  And they had meetings, you know, dinners with the Bushes scheduled, and we also have the guy that shot John Lennon was World Vision.
[02:53:55.446 --> 02:53:57.668]  Yeah, he was at a Laotian camp or something.
[02:53:57.948 --> 02:53:59.409]  By the way, this is admitted, folks.
[02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:13.319]  And see, they use, you know, fake sociologists, fake missionary groups, fake aid groups as fronts, and World Vision clearly has been used as a front.
[02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:17.002]  What, did World Vision have the land that was used for the Jonestown?
[02:54:18.311 --> 02:54:21.233]  No, I just know that there has been reported on some connections.
[02:54:21.313 --> 02:54:28.016]  Not as strong as to Hinckley, and then also the gentleman that shot, I use that term lightly, shot John Lennon.
[02:54:28.476 --> 02:54:29.057]  Okay, thank you.
[02:54:29.697 --> 02:54:30.557]  Thank you for the call.
[02:54:30.597 --> 02:54:32.438]  Yeah, my mouth fell open a few months ago.
[02:54:32.458 --> 02:54:39.582]  One of these other Patriot Networks I was listening, and that was a World Vision ad, and I called up and said, you know there's a World Vision ad on there?
[02:54:39.762 --> 02:54:40.803]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:54:41.958 --> 02:54:42.559]  Pretty weird.
[02:54:42.579 --> 02:54:44.860]  I was like, man, World Vision ads.
[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:46.561]  But again, maybe they didn't know.
[02:54:46.621 --> 02:54:51.624]  I mean, they masquerade as a Christian conservative group.
[02:54:53.465 --> 02:54:55.246]  Very scary folks.
[02:54:55.426 --> 02:54:56.486]  Very, very scary.
[02:54:57.987 --> 02:55:01.869]  You know, I'm not a big animal rights activist, but I do believe you shouldn't torture the animals.
[02:55:02.009 --> 02:55:04.731]  And whales, folks, are just majestic creatures.
[02:55:06.278 --> 02:55:09.299]  Mammals raise their young, nurse their young, love their young.
[02:55:09.319 --> 02:55:12.341]  They get very sad when family pod members die.
[02:55:13.381 --> 02:55:16.823]  And the Japanese, quote for research, are slaughtering whales en masse.
[02:55:16.863 --> 02:55:18.203]  This is out of MSNBC.
[02:55:18.844 --> 02:55:20.624]  And serving them at hamburger places.
[02:55:20.644 --> 02:55:21.245]  Mmmmm.
[02:55:21.345 --> 02:55:25.647]  Japan restaurant chain uses whale burgers.
[02:55:27.587 --> 02:55:29.468]  Whales really have been decimated.
[02:55:29.528 --> 02:55:30.949]  And I just shame on the Japanese.
[02:55:31.852 --> 02:55:38.073]  I mean, folks, eating elephants, eating whales, it's just you've got to have some decency.
[02:55:38.973 --> 02:55:44.394]  I'm not against primitive Inuits in Alaska and other areas taking a few whales.
[02:55:45.055 --> 02:55:46.035]  That's part of their culture.
[02:55:46.795 --> 02:55:51.956]  But the Japanese, you know, for hamburger chains, selling whale, it's disgusting.
[02:55:52.236 --> 02:55:54.436]  Hey, final showing of martial law next Monday.

[02:56:23.094 --> 02:56:23.815]  God bless you all.
