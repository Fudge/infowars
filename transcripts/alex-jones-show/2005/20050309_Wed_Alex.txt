[00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:09.789]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.250]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.512]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:17.235]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:39.255]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.623]  It is Wednesday, the ninth day of March 2005.
[00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.227]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:51.255]  We're going to have wide open phones, take a bunch of your calls on any news item, any issue.
[00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:59.833]  Anything you'd like to cover or discuss, any questions or comments, toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:07.858]  And first-time callers, long-time callers, people who disagree, you're all welcome.
[00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:09.378]  Zero censorship.
[00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:13.921]  If you want to talk about any issue, you're welcome to do it right here on the broadcast.
[00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:14.001]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:21.045]  Because we can defend our ideas here.
[00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.588]  We can defend the facts and information we cover.
[00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.932]  I mentioned this yesterday, but when we get back in the second segment, I want to cover it in some detail.
[00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:41.820]  Student in high school zombie terror threat facing serious jail time, and they now admit that it was a story about zombies busting out of the ground.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.964]  Didn't even mention his school by name, and he'd simply written an article
[00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.352]  And his grandparents saw it and did the right thing.
[00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.573]  They called the government on him.
[00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:57.196]  And all the police just say, you write about zombies killing people, you go to jail!
[00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:08.203]  Young men whose fathers are in the Marine Corps write articles about their father's M-16 and his backpack, and they get arrested.
[00:02:08.883 --> 00:02:16.728]  Or you take a plastic Dixie knife and fork to school, you get kicked out of school.
[00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:22.836]  This is all part of the new freedom, training our children how to live in the new America.
[00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:26.817]  And that dovetails with a story out of WNBC out of New York.
[00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:31.718]  Girl Scouts vowed to take NYPD in cookie ticket flap.
[00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:42.521]  To take them on, the young girl was their number one cookie seller there, and she was in her old neighborhood with her father selling cookies.
[00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.380]  And the police screamed at them and said, get over here!
[00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:51.823]  And ticketed them and said, no cookie sales without a license.
[00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:54.844]  Gotta have a license for everything today.
[00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:56.625]  It's, again, what America's all about.
[00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:00.067]  Learning how to serve the government, learning how to be good slaves.
[00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:05.349]  Everything's designed to shut down small business or anything that's independent.
[00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.770]  And to empower the big global corporations.
[00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:12.292]  Interesting article out of the Associated Press.
[00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:15.995]  Ohioans could be arrested for not telling police their name.
[00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:18.498]  In total violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.565]  A ax murderer caught with a bloody ax doesn't have to, in a truckload of bodies, doesn't have to answer questions.
[00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.546]  It's called the Fifth Amendment.
[00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:41.696]  But now they're telling the general public we have to, but buried in this article out of the Associated Press they mention, oh by the way, Ohio's about to pass a law where cities and counties can't throw out the Patriot Act.
[00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.117]  Very interesting.
[00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:51.039]  Bush demands Syria out of Lebanon by May, and they're beating the war drums to invade.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.005]  China, they have 800 missiles aimed at Taiwan, and those six, the defense minister says, and they say they may invade.
[00:03:58.025 --> 00:03:59.986]  I also want to talk about Mount St.
[00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:01.707]  Helens, another eruption!
[00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:07.412]  And they've had a whole bunch of earthquakes just north of Mount St.
[00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:12.956]  Helens, just north of Washington State, up off the coast of Canada.
[00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:19.000]  Hundreds of moderate quakes in the last week, and you can find it on foreign
[00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:26.504]  Geological websites, but for some reason the USGS isn't talking about it.
[00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.445]  And now we have St.
[00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:29.925]  Helens.
[00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:39.589]  You know, whether it's part of some cycle or whether this is new, there is increased volcanic and tectonic activity.
[00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.010]  There's increased bizarre weather activity.
[00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:48.253]  And I believe it has to do with the sun, with Sol, the center of our
[00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:54.588]  Solar System, two-thirds of the way out with spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:56.709]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:57.409]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.350]  It'll be jam-packed.
[00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.876]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:09.578]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:11.980]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.222]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:19.447]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:23.791]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:25.811]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:36.534]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:38.595]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:42.656]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:44.036]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:48.618]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.866]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:55.127 --> 00:05:55.828]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:04.206]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.109]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.691]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:18.783]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:20.725]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:24.867]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:29.529]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.551]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:39.914]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:42.995]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:06:43.155 --> 00:06:46.477]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:50.458]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on a compost twin.
[00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:51.779]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:52.379]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.880]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.161]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:09.143]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:15.945]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:19.147]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:07:19.327 --> 00:07:21.728]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:29.751]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:41.338]  Fertizine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:47.802]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:48.062]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:48.082 --> 00:07:49.363]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:07.399]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:29.791]  Coming up in about 20 minutes, I'm going to play an episode, a small portion of a piece they did on The Daily Show, so we can analyze the propaganda within this so-called alternative media piece.
[00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:37.874]  And we have cut out the mild profanity, so it'll be child-listening friendly out there.
[00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:44.958]  So that's coming up, and then I want to get into the homosexual sex slave rings, the underage coal boys.
[00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:58.944]  In the mainstream news in the last almost 20 years, in Republican White Houses, very serious, and now it's breaking into the mainstream media.
[00:08:59.983 --> 00:09:01.984]  But they're desperately trying to put their spin on it.
[00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:06.207]  And of course, we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:11.409]  I'm going to give each caller about 60 seconds because I want to give everybody a chance to get involved on air.
[00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:13.831]  In fact, we're going to go to calls in this segment.
[00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:17.753]  Then I want to get into something I mentioned yesterday but didn't detail.
[00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:24.337]  Student in high school zombie terror threat for writing a fiction article, which they admit is fiction.
[00:09:24.957 --> 00:09:28.279]  He's facing years in jail as a terrorist.
[00:09:29.546 --> 00:09:33.748]  And, of course, Girl Scouts can't sell their Girl Scout cookies without a license in New York.
[00:09:33.768 --> 00:09:35.309]  The police hit them and hit them hard.
[00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:46.634]  Ohio is trying to pass federally manipulated law, among other things, so that they cannot, at the county and city level, throw out the Patriot Act.
[00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:51.376]  Something now, what, five states and 400 plus cities and towns have done?
[00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:55.546]  They're beating the war drums, big time for Iran and Syria.
[00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:59.507]  No matter how much they comply, they get kicked around.
[00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:01.107]  Meanwhile, North Korea's threatening to nuke us.
[00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:02.848]  Pakistan's saying they'll kill U.S.
[00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:03.168]  troops.
[00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:04.328]  We're going, oh, we love you!
[00:10:04.888 --> 00:10:05.529]  Oh, we love you!
[00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:06.649]  Oh, we love you, China!
[00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:08.369]  You say you're going to invade Taiwan.
[00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:08.910]  We love you!
[00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.191]  So we've got to the latest threats from China here against Taiwan.
[00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:17.712]  Plus the unusual activities in the latest eruption from Mount St.
[00:10:17.732 --> 00:10:21.093]  Helens that took place yesterday, March 8th.
[00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:34.014]  And it was a pretty good size eruption, and just volcanic and tectonic activity is off the charts in recorded history all over the planet, as is bizarre weather.
[00:10:35.515 --> 00:10:37.696]  Is it part of a normal cycle?
[00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:47.001]  Or is it part of a more rare cycle caused by sun activity, as many top experts are saying it is?
[00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.972]  Also, polar history shows melting ice cap may be a natural cycle.
[00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:53.532]  Well, they've known that for a long time.
[00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.773]  This is some new studies out on that.
[00:10:56.213 --> 00:10:57.554]  That I'm not as worried about.
[00:10:58.214 --> 00:11:12.841]  But this volcanic activity caused by the sun heating up and then causing the Earth's core to heat up, causing more magma to expand into areas of the crust, we'll talk about that coming up.
[00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:18.043]  But first, I do want to go to your calls, do things a little bit different.
[00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.530]  But before I do that, folks, this is not hype.
[00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:33.275]  The best video I've produced, my twelfth film, is Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:37.517]  And it's got the long title because really it's three films.
[00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:39.998]  It's two hours, 35 minutes long.
[00:11:40.558 --> 00:11:42.900]  It is of the highest production quality I've ever done.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.101]  It is totally riveting, non-stop, hard-hitting.
[00:11:46.542 --> 00:12:00.029]  The first 35 minutes is the hover blimps, the police threatening to arrest us, the fake terror alerts, the face scanning cameras, the sound wave weapons, people being put in the camp, camp x-ray during the RNC.
[00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:02.350]  Should we show you the police state in America?
[00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:04.712]  Then we spend a little over an hour
[00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:17.122]  First, we confront Michael Moore and show how his film was a whitewash and how it actually acts like Bush was just a bumbling idiot who vacationed too much and accidentally let 9-11 happen because he was friends with the Saudis.
[00:12:17.342 --> 00:12:18.082]  That's a whitewash.
[00:12:18.122 --> 00:12:23.085]  We show how the Globalists orchestrated 9-11, how they carried it out in total detail.
[00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:30.088]  I mean, just by itself, it's already being hailed as the best 9-11 film out there, and I have to be honest with you, that's my opinion.
[00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.573]  But, you know, I made the first 9-11 film.
[00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:36.694]  I've made the preeminent 9-11 films.
[00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:40.317]  Major publications reported that Moore basically ripped off Road to Tyranny.
[00:12:41.138 --> 00:12:43.800]  But, regardless, this is my greatest work.
[00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:45.422]  That's the second part.
[00:12:45.442 --> 00:12:46.783]  The third part's an hour long.
[00:12:48.172 --> 00:13:05.183]  And it gets into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, we confront David Gergen, we show the Nazi connection, the Fool Society, the Thule Society, who really runs the New World Order, right through Arnold at MSG, and how the Nazis were there in 39, in that very same auditorium, giving the same type speeches.
[00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:11.867]  We go right through it, we show the Bushes and the Nazis, interview John Buchanan and others, it's just amazing.
[00:13:11.887 --> 00:13:12.528]  Greg Palast,
[00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:20.973]  It's all in there and we go right through to Bush's inauguration and we show Bush giving his oath of office and how he's totally violated it.
[00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:23.975]  We go right down the line in a final five minutes.
[00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:28.258]  I mean, it is, it is the big one-two punch.
[00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:38.924]  It's a big left hook and a powerful jab from the right and then just a crashing blow of the metal chair over the head.
[00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.185]  Just a bombshell.
[00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:49.999]  It is very effective and we're putting the labels on the videos and getting ready to ship them out.
[00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:53.741]  We don't start shipping them Friday, we'll be shipping them on Monday, probably Friday.
[00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:57.163]  So you can go ahead and order a hard copy of the video right now.
[00:13:58.146 --> 00:14:02.607]  Martial law, 9-1-1, rise of the police state, evil has spread across the land.
[00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:08.449]  Martial law, 9-1-1, rise of the police state exposes the high-tech control grid that is being set up across America.
[00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:12.770]  Out of the ashes of September 11th, the dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.071]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.
[00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:21.112]  This film exposes not just who was behind 9-1-1 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:14:21.552 --> 00:14:25.153]  Learn the terrifying secret that holds the future of the world in its grasp.
[00:14:25.802 --> 00:14:30.337]  From the front lines of the police state to the darkest sanctum of the secret society that controls it.
[00:14:31.258 --> 00:14:37.279]  Martial Law reveals the master plan of a group hell-bent on capturing America today and tomorrow the world.
[00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:40.340]  The New World Order has set in motion the Fourth Reich.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.021]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:55.042]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power man cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:14:55.442 --> 00:15:00.323]  Discover the documentation and the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:18.313]  And just the reviews are just rave reviews by folks that have had a chance to see it on PrisonPlanet.TV and I just hope that you'll go to PrisonPlanet.TV.

[00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:56.759]  I just want to get it out to people.
[00:15:57.239 --> 00:15:59.021]  But if you're going to share it, download it yourself.
[00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:12.378]  Give it to people that way, because I just... Even though we have two servers for PrisonPlanet.TV, it's been having trouble, because everybody's been sharing the information, and it's hard for people that paid to get on and see it.
[00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.080]  Look, we couldn't continue this without charging.
[00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:20.864]  You know, when I got five, six thousand dollar bandwidth bills, I said, that's it, I gotta do something.
[00:16:20.884 --> 00:16:23.045]  So the membership's just paying for it, basically.
[00:16:25.447 --> 00:16:26.107]  PrisonPlanet.TV

[00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:30.690]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Alaska.
[00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:31.811]  John, go ahead.
[00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:32.972]  Hello Alex.
[00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:33.552]  Hello sir.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.443]  I ran across a little press release here in our Anchorage Daily Newspaper yesterday.
[00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:43.144]  This was released yesterday.
[00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:45.345]  That's titled, U.S.
[00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:49.266]  Government Resource to Terror Tactics and Manages its Workforce.
[00:17:49.867 --> 00:17:55.769]  Now, you've been talking about how the government is going to come down on its own people, you know, in the United States.
[00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.071]  But here it's talking about, even if you work for the government, you're not exempt.
[00:18:01.091 --> 00:18:02.172]  They're going to come down on you.
[00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:05.616]  So what does it say they're doing to their own minions?
[00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:09.059]  Okay, I'm going to read a little bit of this to you.
[00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:14.703]  It says, Federal Unions serve an important and valuable service to the American taxpayer.
[00:18:14.743 --> 00:18:16.545]  Oh yeah, they're busting all those up.
[00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:17.966]  Oh yeah.
[00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:20.668]  Indians and Russians are going to get those jobs.
[00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:21.669]  Right.
[00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:26.833]  Already 70 plus percent of our military hardware is made in Europe.
[00:18:26.853 --> 00:18:27.193]  Go ahead.
[00:18:28.134 --> 00:18:30.616]  They do something taxpayers and our representatives don't.
[00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.551]  don't have the time to do themselves.
[00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.593]  They are the watchdogs of the agencies that they serve.
[00:18:36.454 --> 00:18:42.898]  There is a push in the government to rewrite personal rules to take away the tools unions need to do their job.
[00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:58.028]  Unions cannot make sure the agency stay within the confines of protection of employees of the right to bargain collectively are taken away or curtailed by using various scare tactics in the name of national security
[00:18:58.447 --> 00:19:10.890]  The Departments of Homeland Security and Defense have been able to bully their way to establish a radical new personnel system that will not only reduce pay and undermine morale, but also strip away basic worker rights.
[00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.810]  Well, let me just stop you.
[00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.490]  That's all true.
[00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.850]  That started two years ago.
[00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.071]  They even use anti-terror investigations.
[00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:24.713]  But the bigger thing is, under the new national ID card, standardized state driver's license, you're going to have to have a certification to have any jobs.
[00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:26.253]  So it's going to be the private sector too.
[00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:28.375]  It's a reign of terror.
[00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:32.879]  I'll tell you what, email that article, go to PrisonPlanet.com and it says Contact Webmaster.
[00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:35.001]  Send it to that email, we'll get that posted.
[00:19:35.902 --> 00:19:36.122]  Okay.
[00:19:36.962 --> 00:19:39.144]  What else does it say about the terror tactics they're using?
[00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:50.674]  Well, it's saying that with the implementation of the National Security Personnel System comes the removal of one of the last means taxpayers have
[00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:55.663]  ...of insurance, insuring effectiveness... Yeah, whistleblowing under the Patriot Act is illegal.
[00:19:55.943 --> 00:19:56.683]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.823 --> 00:19:57.704]  Thanks for that great call.
[00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:05.267]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:20:05.527 --> 00:20:06.707]  Thank you, Cartovite.
[00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:11.730]  I was having a hard time breathing and I had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cartovite, that's all changed now.
[00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.371]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cartovite.

[00:24:17.188 --> 00:24:18.289]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:24:18.349 --> 00:24:20.330]  Let's talk to Thomas in Oregon.
[00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.051]  You're on the air.
[00:24:21.091 --> 00:24:21.431]  Welcome.
[00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:22.592]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:24:22.612 --> 00:24:22.972]  Good, sir.
[00:24:23.452 --> 00:24:24.193]  Alright, man.
[00:24:24.313 --> 00:24:26.934]  Hey, did you get a chance to watch CNN at all last night?
[00:24:27.635 --> 00:24:29.316]  No, I don't watch a lot of television.
[00:24:29.356 --> 00:24:30.617]  Well, that's good for you, anyway.
[00:24:30.637 --> 00:24:37.862]  Well, I was surfing through a little bit last night and I caught this bit they had on how easy it is for terrorists to buy firearms here in the U.S.
[00:24:39.053 --> 00:24:42.596]  Well, I've been seeing the text reports of that, and again, you see them all of a sudden.
[00:24:43.056 --> 00:24:49.161]  Oh, we've got to use the national ID card for this because terrorists are going to buy guns and shoot all of us.
[00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:55.346]  That's the new angle on gun control, and some conservative talk show host are saying maybe we should restrict guns.
[00:24:56.187 --> 00:24:57.328]  It's conservative!
[00:24:57.748 --> 00:24:58.729]  Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:01.851]  I mean, they went and bought a .50 caliber rifle.
[00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:02.812]  I mean, come on!
[00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:08.683]  A .50 caliber rifle has never been used in a crime in the United States.
[00:25:08.723 --> 00:25:13.372]  It was used in one armored car robbery.
[00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:15.665]  I think in Northern California, wasn't it?
[00:25:15.925 --> 00:25:17.526]  Yeah, I was correcting myself.
[00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:28.968]  One armored car robbery, and then one time the IRA used it in Ireland against some British troops, when all guns are banned over there to begin with.
[00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:34.229]  And the point is, is that this is just, look, they want to get you used to banning calibers.
[00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:36.110]  Arnold's already banned them in California.
[00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.250]  He's banning lots of different types of ammo.
[00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.831]  They want to ban stuff down to .40 caliber now.
[00:25:41.672 --> 00:25:43.053]  They're dead serious.
[00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:44.455]  The Republicans love it.
[00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:45.236]  They love Arnold.
[00:25:45.497 --> 00:25:47.860]  Well, after I got done with that, I was much more entertained.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.287]  I got a chance to watch Marshall Law last night, and that was absolutely your best work ever, hands down.
[00:25:54.161 --> 00:25:57.102]  Your little giddy with David Gergen was just hilarious.
[00:25:57.142 --> 00:25:57.802]  I almost cried.
[00:25:57.822 --> 00:26:02.604]  Well, I did cry a little bit on that, but, um... Well, I mean, here I am going, so are you part of rituals?
[00:26:02.664 --> 00:26:04.845]  And he starts saying, none of your bleepin' business!
[00:26:05.005 --> 00:26:05.505]  And he doesn't deny it!
[00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:06.325]  Yeah, he got pretty upset.
[00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:16.769]  He got pretty upset with you, so that was... I mean, it was just funny to watch how riled you got, and I mean, just from that simple question, and how it was all of a sudden you're an ambushed journalist, which I thought was also funny.
[00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.130]  But you were misquoted in that.
[00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.851]  You did, uh... You did misquote in that film, though, on the second part.
[00:26:23.295 --> 00:26:29.838]  About 20 minutes into the show, Manohar Yamazaki, the architect of the World Trade Center.
[00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:30.798]  Yes.
[00:26:31.278 --> 00:26:41.502]  Well, the quote in there that you had was that he went on record days after 9-11 and said that they designed the towers to take multiple jumbo jet strikes.
[00:26:41.762 --> 00:26:42.102]  Yes.
[00:26:42.402 --> 00:26:44.243]  Okay, well, he's dead, though.
[00:26:45.263 --> 00:26:48.484]  He didn't go on air saying that days after, because he's dead.
[00:26:48.544 --> 00:26:49.325]  He's been dead since 1986.
[00:26:51.644 --> 00:27:20.110]  Well, I was using his, there was a whole body, let me be clear, I show several news articles and he said that it would take multiple jumbo jet strikes and so I kind of merged in the quick voice over, I said a whole bunch of experts and then I said, first I said his name, then I said multiple jumbo jet hits and I might have kind of merged a bunch of quotes just in the, you know, trying to quickly say what the experts, I said experts went on record.
[00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.811]  So if it's not clear, who knows, I might change it.
[00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:25.432]  Yeah, you know how the pundits are.
[00:27:25.772 --> 00:27:29.253]  If they do any of their research, they'll go after whatever they can get.
[00:27:29.353 --> 00:27:32.234]  Other than that, that film was just awesome, Alex.
[00:27:32.274 --> 00:27:34.434]  That was your best work, hands down.
[00:27:34.794 --> 00:27:38.355]  I mean, if anyone's ever seen any of your work and has enjoyed it, they're going to love it.
[00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:40.756]  I can hardly wait until it comes out on DVD.
[00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:43.957]  We even have the video clip of it.
[00:27:44.777 --> 00:27:46.438]  In fact, I know it's in the computer.
[00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:53.369]  Not just the designer, but the engineer who built it told PBS it was meant to take multiple strikes.
[00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.411]  Oh, I don't doubt that whatsoever.
[00:27:55.451 --> 00:27:59.934]  I'm just saying, you know, the pundits, when they hear that, though, they're going to take it as.
[00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:03.939]  You know, well, how did this guy say this and he's been dead for 15 years?
[00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:17.108]  Well, he said it was meant to take multiple strikes and then I said other experts, but if it's not clear... Yeah, well, the way it was said on the film anyway, it was just that he said the way it was mentioned is that that gentleman had said it days after 9-11.
[00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:18.649]  No, that's a good point.
[00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:19.790]  I'd like to make that more clear.
[00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.853]  Yeah, instead you should, you know, like, make it say, well, the company, the firm that did that, because the firm did say that.
[00:28:24.873 --> 00:28:26.634]  You're totally right, because I did the research.
[00:28:26.674 --> 00:28:28.756]  I've been up all night long playing with this and
[00:28:29.756 --> 00:28:31.677]  I did the research and the company did say that.
[00:28:31.757 --> 00:28:32.658]  No doubt about it.
[00:28:32.738 --> 00:28:33.758]  It was just days after.
[00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:34.799]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:28:35.419 --> 00:28:36.640]  It's funny you mention this.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:43.163]  We actually have the PBS clip of the head engineer, not the architect, the head engineer.
[00:28:43.784 --> 00:28:46.225]  Of course, Yamasaki also said it was going to take multiple hits.
[00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:50.427]  But we have the engineer days after 9-11 saying it.
[00:28:51.448 --> 00:28:54.009]  And so what I think I'll do is, I think I will
[00:28:55.117 --> 00:28:56.158]  Grab that clip.
[00:28:56.538 --> 00:28:58.019]  In fact, let me just tell the folks in front of the show.
[00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:17.070]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, one of the, you know, 30-40 stories we put up today, I don't have the computer on in front of me, says, uh... Lessons Learned from the Madrid Collapse, or Lessons Learned from the Madrid vs. Towers Collapse.
[00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:19.872]  And if you click on that, it goes to what really happened.
[00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:22.274]  We also have the video clip, but it's just right there on the site.
[00:29:22.734 --> 00:29:23.654]  Or go to my WTC7
[00:29:25.215 --> 00:29:27.796]  Uh, Collapse site, and we have that clip there too.
[00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:33.057]  And it's Chief Engineer says buildings designed to take multiple hits.
[00:29:33.117 --> 00:29:34.578]  And I want to grab that clip for people.
[00:29:34.998 --> 00:29:35.958]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:29:36.178 --> 00:29:37.778]  I want to jam more calls in here.
[00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:43.020]  I said I keep each caller to about a minute, but the last two callers have had really good points, so I kept them on longer.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.080]  We got to move a little bit quicker, because I want to get to everybody.
[00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:46.641]  Bunch of news coming up as well.
[00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:47.041]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:54.746]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:58.387]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:05.150]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:09.713]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:30:09.953 --> 00:30:16.876]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:23.925]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:30:24.226 --> 00:30:27.690]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox to just concentrate.
[00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.491]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit biowox.com.
[00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:39.961]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:46.725]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:30:46.925 --> 00:30:51.608]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:54.329]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:59.132]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[00:31:01.352 --> 00:31:05.233]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.474 --> 00:31:10.896]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.176 --> 00:31:21.539]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:26.041]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:27.041]  We're good to go!
[00:31:41.206 --> 00:31:41.667]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:08.873]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.314 --> 00:32:13.538]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.778 --> 00:32:20.805]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.185 --> 00:32:27.291]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.451 --> 00:32:28.652]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.992 --> 00:32:31.936]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:32.096 --> 00:32:34.118]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:41.667]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:41.968 --> 00:32:45.352]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:32:48.873 --> 00:32:48.913]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:49.013]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.253 --> 00:32:50.174]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.194 --> 00:32:50.434]  Call today.
[00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:31.436]  Alright, I'm grabbing that clip of the Chief Engineer on PBS saying it was designed to take multiple large jet aircraft collisions.
[00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:37.420]  What I do in the film is I throw up Yamasaki, I throw up a bunch of other articles with other engineers.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:44.824]  We only spend about 45 seconds on it and if it's confusing, I guess people that get the first version of it are going to
[00:33:46.044 --> 00:33:46.404]  We're good to go.
[00:33:55.743 --> 00:33:58.045]  The DVD made, in fact, it's going to be sent off today.
[00:33:58.545 --> 00:33:59.746]  It's going to get sent off tomorrow.
[00:34:00.347 --> 00:34:01.288]  Guess I'll be up all night.
[00:34:01.688 --> 00:34:02.949]  But if it's not clear.
[00:34:02.989 --> 00:34:04.810]  But you know, that's the problem with all of this.
[00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:08.133]  If things aren't completely clear, it does confuse people.
[00:34:08.173 --> 00:34:25.227]  But when you're talking about mountains of evidence, you know, the underwriters saying this, and the designers saying it, and the engineers saying it, and the head of a engineering college saying it, and we show all these people, this rapid-fire, all these articles, and you know, I'm in their
[00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.065]  I kind of do things backwards.
[00:34:27.105 --> 00:34:31.727]  I put all the articles together and then I just sit there and voice them as I look at the screen.
[00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:39.090]  That's why if everybody gets Marshall Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, it really is my best work.
[00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:42.292]  And it's available right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:42.312 --> 00:34:44.893]  You can watch it online or call toll free to get a copy.
[00:34:44.913 --> 00:34:45.433]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:45.453 --> 00:34:45.493]  888-253-3139.
[00:34:57.345 --> 00:35:11.295]  Before I go to Joe and David and Eric and Harvey and everybody else that's patiently holding, I don't want to spend all day on this because there's just so much other really, really important news.
[00:35:12.475 --> 00:35:15.778]  Like this headline, Could the Super Volcano Nightmare Come True?
[00:35:15.918 --> 00:35:16.738]  London Independent.
[00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:20.801]  Or Large Plume Blows and Billows from Mount St.
[00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:21.201]  Helens.
[00:35:21.221 --> 00:35:23.543]  I mean, these are the serious articles I want to
[00:35:24.162 --> 00:35:25.162]  I have time to get to.
[00:35:25.282 --> 00:35:25.562]  U.S.
[00:35:25.602 --> 00:35:28.803]  Marine calls public story of Saddam capture fiction.
[00:35:29.383 --> 00:35:35.824]  Blown away from Discover Magazine talking about the clouds of depleted uranium blowing into the United States.
[00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:38.945]  Amongst other things.
[00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:42.486]  I mean, it's... They've used thousands of tons of this stuff.
[00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:45.366]  Serbia and Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:35:45.406 --> 00:35:46.186]  It's serious.
[00:35:46.206 --> 00:35:50.087]  It's not just hurting our troops and those poor people over there, my friends.
[00:35:50.883 --> 00:35:53.905]  Also, stocks are trying to stem their slide, but they keep sliding.
[00:35:54.346 --> 00:35:57.408]  Oil is up to $55 a barrel despite increased supply.
[00:35:57.428 --> 00:36:01.370]  I thought it was about supply and demand, not when you have a rigged system.
[00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.392]  But I wanted to talk about this.
[00:36:04.092 --> 00:36:06.274]  I mean, this has been now on CNN.
[00:36:06.354 --> 00:36:08.055]  It's been all over TV.
[00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:14.459]  I don't watch much TV, but I went on a few days of vacation this weekend, so I watched a few hours of TV.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.561]  And I saw CNN.
[00:36:16.601 --> 00:36:18.602]  I saw the piece you're about to hear from The Daily Show.
[00:36:18.622 --> 00:36:19.783]  We're going to hear a small part of it.
[00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:24.046]  I saw several Fox News, and the spin's the same.
[00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:27.167]  Look how bad the alternative media is!
[00:36:27.647 --> 00:36:36.450]  Why, they've got man-whores, you know, basically mail-call madams, running things.
[00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.211]  You can't trust the alternative media.
[00:36:38.591 --> 00:36:39.831]  It's not alternative media.
[00:36:39.851 --> 00:36:46.133]  This is the White House, paid, fake alternative media, neocon site, because we're taking over the web.
[00:36:46.353 --> 00:36:48.514]  They've got to put their shills in there.
[00:36:50.453 --> 00:37:00.697]  And we've exposed this, so this is the establishment trying to infiltrate, but they turn it around, CNN and the Daily Show and all these places, as if it's the alternative media that's done this.
[00:37:01.497 --> 00:37:04.859]  No, no, no, it's the mainstream media being paid CIA paychecks.
[00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:12.081]  That came out in the church hearings, you know, in the 70's, some of the last church hearings they had, about CIA payoffs.
[00:37:14.122 --> 00:37:16.223]  I mean, this is the facts of what we're talking about.
[00:37:18.275 --> 00:37:20.636]  And now it's worse than ever with Armstrong-Williams.
[00:37:20.676 --> 00:37:22.717]  It's just thousands of these people.
[00:37:23.797 --> 00:37:25.918]  But this is how they're masters of spin.
[00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:29.699]  Of course, all the new reports are coming out for the year of 2004.
[00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:32.200]  Always takes a few months after for it to come out.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.081]  Record numbers.
[00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:42.203]  79 million Americans got more of their news from alternative websites than they got it from the mainstream news.
[00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.558]  And it's much higher than that.
[00:37:44.578 --> 00:37:53.270]  I mean, if I'm getting, you know, 10 million individual visitors a month to my little websites, which are dwarfed by some of the alternative sites out there, the globalists have got big problems.
[00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:56.133]  Big, big, big, big problems.
[00:37:56.373 --> 00:38:02.017]  And we take their news, we decipher it, we show their lies, we show their propaganda, we show the legislation right next to it.
[00:38:02.057 --> 00:38:02.958]  People want that.
[00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:04.939]  They want critical analysis.
[00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:14.966]  Now there is a mass of people, probably a hundred plus million, who could care less, who live their lives playing video games and watching their sitcoms and dramas.
[00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:18.509]  They're friends of the imaginary characters on TV.
[00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:22.752]  They're getting dumber, while a large portion of us are getting smarter.
[00:38:23.955 --> 00:38:34.286]  And there are just more and more people... I mean, we have millions of people out there scanning information, checking every fact, cross-referencing.
[00:38:35.628 --> 00:38:42.635]  And that just makes us get better and better and hone our facts and make them more precise and more cross-referenced, like you heard with the last caller.
[00:38:42.655 --> 00:38:45.378]  I haven't checked it out yet, but if it's the case, I'm going to change it.
[00:38:46.111 --> 00:38:47.371]  That's why we're so effective.
[00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:48.912]  We have millions of brains.
[00:38:49.272 --> 00:38:52.033]  The globalists don't have that with their NSA and their CIA.
[00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:53.733]  And most of their people aren't bad.
[00:38:53.753 --> 00:38:55.614]  They're compartmentalized, doing real jobs.
[00:38:55.914 --> 00:38:58.154]  It's very small cabals of criminals doing this.
[00:38:58.534 --> 00:38:59.435]  Or it's nepotism.
[00:38:59.475 --> 00:39:02.656]  They're family members, the globalist family members, writing hit pieces.
[00:39:04.496 --> 00:39:11.218]  Or dumbed down ideologues who just buy the party line, but who are so innately stupid, they can't write good counters to us.
[00:39:11.698 --> 00:39:12.298]  They're failing.
[00:39:12.858 --> 00:39:14.979]  So here is the clip from the Daily Show, which is
[00:39:16.056 --> 00:39:18.319]  It sounds like it's bashing Bush, but it's really not.
[00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:19.840]  It's very sophisticated.
[00:39:20.421 --> 00:39:21.402]  And then we'll play that.
[00:39:21.422 --> 00:39:30.552]  We did find that clip of the chief engineer of the World Trade Center saying it was meant to take multiple large jet aircraft impacts.
[00:39:30.852 --> 00:39:32.434]  But let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.442]  There's an information revolution at hand.
[00:39:36.922 --> 00:39:41.845]  From Matt Drudge to MemoGate, we've been hearing a lot about the new journalism.
[00:39:42.265 --> 00:39:44.527]  But what is the new journalism?
[00:39:44.887 --> 00:39:46.168]  And what's in it for you?
[00:39:50.746 --> 00:39:54.048]  To begin your career in new journalism, you need the lay of the land.
[00:39:54.648 --> 00:39:56.810]  Professor of Journalism, Jay Rosen.
[00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:02.893]  The seal of approval that the old media once had doesn't mean the same thing anymore.
[00:40:03.193 --> 00:40:07.256]  People are not as impressed by the fact that it's CBS News as they once were.
[00:40:07.616 --> 00:40:12.339]  And so journalism now is going to be something that pros and amateurs do.
[00:40:12.879 --> 00:40:13.760]  So there are no rules?
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.882]  Yeah.
[00:40:17.142 --> 00:40:17.462]  Ready?
[00:40:18.302 --> 00:40:19.183]  Let's get started.
[00:40:20.468 --> 00:40:20.769]  Step 1.
[00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.632]  Create a persona.
[00:40:23.872 --> 00:40:27.897]  The first step in creating a news persona is to choose an ideology.
[00:40:28.498 --> 00:40:32.242]  And with over one to choose from, it shouldn't take long.
[00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:38.369]  Next, give yourself a catchy news name and make sure to hide your sordid past.
[00:40:39.554 --> 00:40:42.435]  Like ex-gay porn webmaster James Gooker.
[00:40:42.895 --> 00:40:49.596]  He became Jack Gannon of right-wing Talon News and ended up just 20 feet from the president.
[00:40:50.176 --> 00:40:56.277]  Senate Democratic leaders have painted a very bleak picture of the US economy.
[00:40:56.297 --> 00:41:01.038]  How are you going to work with people who seem to have divorced themselves from reality?
[00:41:01.418 --> 00:41:04.298]  If a man-whore can do it, anyone can.
[00:41:05.338 --> 00:41:08.779]  Credibility established, it's time to launch your blog.
[00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:11.955]  You are yourself a blogger.
[00:41:12.495 --> 00:41:13.155]  I am a blogger.
[00:41:13.816 --> 00:41:15.036]  Thank you for wearing pants.
[00:41:19.758 --> 00:41:20.938]  Thank me for wearing pants.
[00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:25.160]  The joke is, you know, bloggers... Make sure to give your blog the right name.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:31.162]  If you're conservative, you'll want strong words that show that you love your country.
[00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:46.732]  They work best in combination, like FreeForceAmerica.com, or StrongEagleCitadel.org, or... Extra Strength, uh... Actually, that's, uh, something else.
[00:41:48.073 --> 00:41:51.653]  If you're liberal, you want to show people you're smarter than they are.
[00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:54.234]  Try something obscure and literary.
[00:41:55.169 --> 00:41:57.850]  But please, no pension references.
[00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.191]  Those are so pre-post-mid-post-modern.
[00:42:03.992 --> 00:42:13.154]  In the old days, journalists had jobs at companies that paid them salaries in a manner that was all above board.
[00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:15.755]  Well, those limitations are gone.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:22.544]  If you've got a blog, more traffic means more ads means more money.
[00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:27.748]  So it's your responsibility to attract readers with exclusive, compelling content.
[00:42:27.968 --> 00:42:32.112]  Like, say, my four-part insinuation about the Speaker of the House.
[00:42:32.792 --> 00:42:34.914]  Dennis Hastert shaves his junk?
[00:42:35.495 --> 00:42:38.037]  That'll keep them reading until they punch the monkey.
[00:42:41.377 --> 00:42:44.246]  Don't have the patience to get rich a quarter penny at a time?
[00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:48.438]  Why not sell your credibility in bulk to the government?
[00:42:49.478 --> 00:42:57.723]  Syndicated columnist Maggie Gallagher came out for marriage and earned $21,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:42:58.303 --> 00:43:06.567]  CNN pundit Armstrong Williams plugged No Child Left Behind and made $240,000 from the Department of Education.
[00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:11.550]  And if you're good, you can work your plugs in so seamlessly, no one will know.
[00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:15.552]  March 20th, 2003.
[00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.694]  Rob, what can you tell us tonight about the scene in Baghdad?
[00:43:19.375 --> 00:43:22.238]  Well, John, the insurgency is active.
[00:43:22.338 --> 00:43:26.161]  And he's wearing a sandwich board that has an ad on it.
[00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:28.963]  I made 75 bucks for that, plus sandwiches.
[00:43:30.385 --> 00:43:32.466]  Okay, let's put it all together.
[00:43:33.107 --> 00:43:34.408]  Step 3.
[00:43:35.049 --> 00:43:36.350]  Go to work.
[00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.252]  Now I'm ready to become a new journalist.
[00:43:39.572 --> 00:43:41.614]  So say goodbye to Rob Corddry.
[00:43:43.256 --> 00:43:45.538]  And say hello to Dino Ironbody.
[00:43:45.858 --> 00:43:46.959]  Freedom Liberty News.
[00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:51.675]  Wednesday, 9 a.m., City Hall Press Conference.
[00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:54.897]  I would say that I don't think that's likely.
[00:43:54.937 --> 00:43:57.739]  Can they go to a real press conference?
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.163]  Unfortunately, the City Council cannot rezone.
[00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:03.864]  Mr. Speaker, Dino Ironbody.
[00:44:04.465 --> 00:44:08.608]  How do you feel about the President's awesome plan to privatize Social Security?
[00:44:12.613 --> 00:44:16.634]  I am not such a big fan of the President's plan to protest.
[00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:17.234]  Yeah!
[00:44:17.434 --> 00:44:19.895]  I'm going to prolong a rap out of this.
[00:44:19.935 --> 00:44:22.936]  Generations and we ought to stick with something that works.
[00:44:28.417 --> 00:44:39.880]  Alright folks, and then it went on and on, but notice, all the people out there planning false news and putting out propaganda and infiltrating the alternative media, it's all White House paid!
[00:44:41.076 --> 00:44:44.620]  Howard Dean got to have an alternative look.
[00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.626]  Paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to existing bloggers and alternative news sites.
[00:44:51.186 --> 00:44:56.271]  I mean, they all do it, and then they talk about Armstrong Williams and other people being paid off.
[00:44:56.291 --> 00:45:01.116]  I mean, these are big establishment people, and then try to associate it with the alternative media.
[00:45:01.897 --> 00:45:03.879]  And sure, the alternative media is full of a lot of garbage.
[00:45:04.366 --> 00:45:09.931]  But the point is, is that it's alternative, and there's every flavor, you know, in the rainbow, times a thousand.
[00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:15.455]  And it's up to you to go check it out, and look at it, and research it, and go to the source documents and history for yourself.
[00:45:15.896 --> 00:45:22.381]  And that's what these search engines, you know, these access to the libraries of the world, on demand, have helped us do.
[00:45:22.401 --> 00:45:25.924]  And that's why the 9-11 story is completely falling apart.
[00:45:26.825 --> 00:45:29.247]  Now, here is the chief engineer,
[00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:31.350]  Uh, who did die shortly after 9-11.
[00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:45.597]  Uh, here he is on PBS, shortly before 9-11, talking about how the buildings were designed, uh, as Yamasaki and others set on record, and we have those articles in the film, that it was designed to take multiple hits and, uh, uh, shouldn't collapse from it.
[00:45:46.057 --> 00:45:47.198]  It was over-engineered.
[00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:48.899]  So, here is that clip.
[00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:57.949]  The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it.
[00:45:58.469 --> 00:46:01.111]  That was the largest plane at the time.
[00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:15.902]  I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door.
[00:46:16.783 --> 00:46:18.404]  This intense grid.
[00:46:19.233 --> 00:46:23.474]  And the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen.
[00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:23.935]  Alright.
[00:46:24.355 --> 00:46:25.315]  It really does nothing.
[00:46:25.935 --> 00:46:27.196]  Really does nothing to the structure.
[00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:28.796]  I'm sorry, we cut off that last part.
[00:46:29.316 --> 00:46:30.077]  Uh, play it again.
[00:46:30.337 --> 00:46:31.197]  Sorry, I thought it was over.
[00:46:31.217 --> 00:46:31.957]  Play it again, please.
[00:46:33.518 --> 00:46:33.838]  Here it is.
[00:46:35.317 --> 00:46:41.121]  The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it.
[00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.303]  That was the largest plane at the time.
[00:46:44.904 --> 00:46:59.073]  I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door.
[00:46:59.974 --> 00:47:01.575]  This intense grid.
[00:47:02.424 --> 00:47:07.088]  And the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting.
[00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:10.110]  It really does nothing to the screen netting.
[00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.451]  You're not supposed to question authority, N.A.
[00:47:12.552 --> 00:47:20.758]  And again, that clip Anthony Hilder put in his video that you can watch, 9-1-1 The Biggest Lie Ever Sold, that's for prisonplanet.tv members.
[00:47:20.818 --> 00:47:24.140]  And you know, I didn't even put that clip in martial law.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.382]  There's just too much to put in there.
[00:47:28.283 --> 00:47:30.645]  I spend maybe 45 seconds on the engineers
[00:47:31.637 --> 00:47:40.521]  Saying, I mean all of them, the underwriters, the heads of universities, the designer of it, the engineer of it, on and on and on.
[00:47:40.561 --> 00:47:48.424]  But then we do spend about a minute or two on the Madrid building that burned for two days with 100 foot white flame shooting out.
[00:47:48.444 --> 00:47:49.904]  It didn't collapse, folks.
[00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:53.266]  None of the support columns even got damaged.
[00:47:53.286 --> 00:47:56.367]  You know, very small little roof supports.
[00:47:58.123 --> 00:48:01.627]  About an inch around, those did bend.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:11.096]  But none of the main support columns, because that's just... White hot flames at around 2,000 degrees, steel doesn't start melting until 3,000.
[00:48:11.537 --> 00:48:13.659]  That's just the facts.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.383]  And jet fuel doesn't get anywhere near 2,000 degrees.
[00:48:19.395 --> 00:48:22.136]  But again, it's all covered in the film, folks.
[00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.796]  You've just got to see it for yourself.
[00:48:24.616 --> 00:48:26.757]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:27.897]  Joe in Texas.
[00:48:27.917 --> 00:48:28.237]  Go ahead.
[00:48:28.257 --> 00:48:28.818]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:29.438 --> 00:48:30.118]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:48:30.358 --> 00:48:30.698]  Good, sir.
[00:48:30.998 --> 00:48:33.399]  Let's make every day a bad day for the New World Order.
[00:48:34.359 --> 00:48:36.120]  Got a quick comment and then a question.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.900]  The comment is on the Art Bell Show.
[00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:39.701]  Yes.
[00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:43.962]  And I'm not defending the show because I think it was poorly done.
[00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:48.463]  But I don't know who told you that you were challenged on air to call in.
[00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:50.637]  But you were not.
[00:48:50.777 --> 00:48:55.559]  I've listened to the show three times and I dropped a copy of the audio off, the full audio.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.940]  Yeah, I heard that got dropped off by the office.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.241]  Thank you.
[00:48:58.261 --> 00:48:59.261]  I'm going to try to listen to it.
[00:48:59.281 --> 00:49:01.522]  I've listened to small portions online.
[00:49:01.542 --> 00:49:04.444]  I just haven't had three and a half hours to listen to it.
[00:49:04.604 --> 00:49:06.765]  Well, I just edited down the complete show.
[00:49:06.785 --> 00:49:07.786]  You can get it.
[00:49:07.806 --> 00:49:08.586]  It's a 110 minute tape.
[00:49:08.686 --> 00:49:10.027]  But I understand you're a busy man.
[00:49:10.819 --> 00:49:15.262]  Whoever told you you were challenged, on air, is giving you bad information?
[00:49:15.282 --> 00:49:16.703]  Well, you heard the... Have you been listening?
[00:49:16.763 --> 00:49:17.644]  Callers have said that.
[00:49:17.904 --> 00:49:23.048]  Callers have also said that the lady calls in and says, I'm an anti-Semite, and that wasn't... Is that said?
[00:49:24.009 --> 00:49:31.574]  There is a woman in the last segment who does call you an anti-Semite, but neither Bell nor... No, I understand, but it wasn't challenged.
[00:49:31.614 --> 00:49:34.796]  What about... Alright, well, thank you for that information.
[00:49:34.816 --> 00:49:35.817]  I have a quick question.
[00:49:36.117 --> 00:49:36.377]  Okay.
[00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:39.800]  If you could discuss... You've kind of hinted around it before.
[00:49:40.616 --> 00:49:50.583]  Discuss the waking up process for people because, you know, when you make this breakthrough and you start to look at this information, it changes your reality.
[00:49:52.024 --> 00:49:56.588]  And I wondered if you could discuss your feelings on that.
[00:49:57.088 --> 00:50:00.511]  Well, I mean, how I woke up or the process of waking up?
[00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:03.493]  Yeah, the process of waking up and what it does to your reality.
[00:50:04.033 --> 00:50:09.097]  Well, it's different for every person depending on your genetics, how you were raised, you know, nature and nurture.
[00:50:10.298 --> 00:50:16.181]  But, you know, people have the courage when they are faced with facts to then deal with the reality.
[00:50:16.201 --> 00:50:19.442]  I mean, most people don't want to believe the world has these bad things happening in it.
[00:50:19.843 --> 00:50:23.264]  Most people are not, you know, just psychopaths themselves.
[00:50:23.744 --> 00:50:25.805]  So they see the world kind of through their lens.
[00:50:26.105 --> 00:50:29.127]  And so they can't believe that other people think and operate like this.
[00:50:29.607 --> 00:50:35.550]  So they kind of have that defense mechanism in them
[00:50:36.506 --> 00:50:38.328]  Uh, to where they can't deal with it.
[00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:43.011]  But for a lot of people who wake up, uh, you know, it's like being told you have cancer.
[00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:44.152]  At first, you're in denial.
[00:50:44.872 --> 00:50:48.095]  But, I mean, it's a huge topic, a giant area of discussion.
[00:50:48.115 --> 00:50:49.315]  Do you have anything else you want to add?
[00:50:49.355 --> 00:50:52.558]  I mean, just have a great day and keep up the great work in the film.
[00:50:52.598 --> 00:50:53.679]  The latest film is wonderful.
[00:50:54.339 --> 00:50:54.919]  Well, thank you.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.320]  I appreciate the call.
[00:50:56.881 --> 00:50:57.842]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:50:57.902 --> 00:50:58.302]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.528 --> 00:51:05.873]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.053 --> 00:51:10.479]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:15.004]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.044 --> 00:51:16.405]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.166 --> 00:51:22.387]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.447 --> 00:51:29.389]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.509 --> 00:51:31.569]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:42.311]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:46.232]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[00:51:46.852 --> 00:51:47.773]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.167 --> 00:52:02.768]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.928 --> 00:52:06.991]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.171 --> 00:52:10.054]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.134 --> 00:52:16.839]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.019 --> 00:52:20.041]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.241 --> 00:52:22.623]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.763 --> 00:52:30.649]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:42.235]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[00:53:50.111 --> 00:53:55.974]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:17.029]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:18.029 --> 00:54:29.252]  Homosexuals control Bush, White House, Russian paper, Moscow Gazette reports, and from the information they cover in this article, I mean, it's all been piecemeal in our mainstream media here.
[00:54:29.792 --> 00:54:38.014]  The notorious Gannon, a well-known American homosexual pornographer, and also a close worker with the Republicans in the White House,
[00:54:38.843 --> 00:54:48.349]  that basically ran a madam service for homosexuals, is revealing everything about the powerful ring of homosexuals that now are controlling President Bush.
[00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:54.793]  Gannon made many secret tape recordings while he was a front reporter for the right-wing Republicans at the White House.
[00:54:54.833 --> 00:55:04.920]  These tapes, which clearly show the influence of powerful perverts inside the most advanced of the American political circles, were made secretly by Gannon over a two-year period.
[00:55:06.058 --> 00:55:20.929]  With the assistance of a literary agent, Gannon has offered these most revealing and most private conversations to a Russian publishing company, offices in Malaysia, and it is confidently stating that a very dynamic and revealing book will be produced in the coming future.
[00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:35.019]  Gannon claims intimate connections with not only Mr. Bush, but also with top leaders of the Republican Party, and most especially acting as connection with the very powerful and controlling American Christian militant organizations.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:44.103]  He claims that several very famous Christian leaders are also homosexual, and that these work together with others in high political circles.
[00:55:44.623 --> 00:55:56.268]  One reporter advises that both Russian and English language editions of the book will be printed, and that promises to be an important study of the true and inner workings of leadership of American government.
[00:55:58.369 --> 00:55:59.349]  And folks, we know!
[00:55:59.749 --> 00:56:03.391]  I mean, we know they bus in male prostitutes and male porn stars at Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:04.291]  That's mainstream news.
[00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:14.575]  New York Post, Associated Press, Spy Magazine, Parade Magazine, I mean, it's in, um, you know, we get into it for a few minutes in, uh, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:15.315 --> 00:56:26.381]  Uh, my new film, when we get into the satanic elite, the Nazi satanic elite, literally, that controls our government, and funded Hitler, and we get into that, and it's well known that Hitler was into this stuff, and it's Rome.
[00:56:28.141 --> 00:56:29.462]  And it's just the same thing.
[00:56:29.602 --> 00:56:34.166]  It's the same thing over and over and over and over again in martial law.
[00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:37.469]  9-11 Rise of the Police State covers this in detail.
[00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:47.177]  And the question is, we know this is going on, but Gannon may bring all this out, then it gets discredited on purpose.
[00:56:47.197 --> 00:56:48.238]  He may be working for them.
[00:56:48.498 --> 00:56:48.998]  He has been.
[00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.700]  We know he has been working for them.
[00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:52.922]  They know this has already been coming out.
[00:56:54.543 --> 00:56:56.785]  Many people were working on it with procedures publications.
[00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:03.205]  So have Gannon bring it out, then have it be false info Gannon brings out, discredit that.
[00:57:04.486 --> 00:57:05.667]  That's what I think is going on here.
[00:57:06.748 --> 00:57:08.289]  Because he'd be dead if this was real.
[00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:15.274]  I mean, again, a gas man would blow up, his plane would crash, he'd die of a heart attack, he'd commit suicide, and then that'd be the end of it.
[00:57:15.814 --> 00:57:20.998]  Though we are getting reports that people surrounding this case are starting to arch inside themselves or die mysteriously.
[00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:27.205]  Or it could be another group in the Global Crime Syndicate that is using him to do this, to leverage and blackmail Bush.
[00:57:27.766 --> 00:57:28.346]  I don't know.
[00:57:28.986 --> 00:57:31.787]  I don't know the case, but I do know this stuff goes on.
[00:57:33.007 --> 00:57:34.447]  And it's big in Texas government.
[00:57:34.947 --> 00:57:36.488]  At the highest levels.
[00:57:37.508 --> 00:57:38.968]  And this is how they control people.
[00:57:39.008 --> 00:57:39.829]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:57:39.849 --> 00:57:47.010]  You know, why would Rupert Murdoch of the New York Post come out with, you know, top gay porn star services, moguls at Bohemian Grove?
[00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:49.351]  Well, again, to leverage people.
[00:57:50.784 --> 00:57:51.925]  These people fight with each other.
[00:57:51.945 --> 00:57:54.467]  They're a pack of gangsters.
[00:57:55.768 --> 00:57:57.049]  Look at the New Jersey governor.
[00:57:57.089 --> 00:58:02.273]  He has to leave office, but the prominent Republican congressman, a Californian, same stuff.
[00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:03.854]  Comes out, it's admitted, L.A.
[00:58:03.894 --> 00:58:04.174]  Times.
[00:58:04.475 --> 00:58:05.095]  Nothing happens.
[00:58:06.036 --> 00:58:08.878]  And you're an evil commie who's against family values if you're against it.
[00:58:09.759 --> 00:58:13.882]  If you're against homosexual orgies, you're a liberal.
[00:58:14.403 --> 00:58:19.727]  If you're for them, if you're for open borders, if you're for banning guns like Arnold is and others, you're a conservative.
[00:58:20.507 --> 00:58:23.169]  If you pose for gay porno mags like Arnold, you're a conservative.
[00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:25.391]  I mean, it's just across the board, folks.
[00:58:27.693 --> 00:58:33.778]  So I'm against, you know, the gay porno mags and our leaders posing for them, but that's because I'm liberal.
[00:58:34.459 --> 00:58:36.000]  I'm against gun control because I'm liberal.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.443]  We've got to learn the new lingo here in the double thing.
[00:58:39.743 --> 00:58:43.726]  War is peace, ignorance is strength, and freedom is slavery.
[00:58:44.186 --> 00:58:45.387]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:45.427 --> 00:58:46.508]  A ton of news, your calls.
[00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:48.350]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:58:57.521 --> 00:58:58.161]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.822 --> 00:58:59.882]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:01.703]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.344 --> 00:59:03.184]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.925 --> 00:59:04.845]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.506 --> 00:59:09.128]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.688 --> 00:59:13.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.056 --> 00:59:35.119]  Alright, my friends, now into hour number two on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:59:35.919 --> 00:59:37.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.161]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to get into it.
[00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:42.741]  Student and high school zombie terror threat.
[00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:47.863]  They admit it's a fiction account of zombies busting out of the ground and killing people, but it doesn't matter.
[00:59:47.903 --> 00:59:49.884]  He's facing jail time as a terrorist.
[00:59:51.304 --> 00:59:53.805]  Girl Scouts can't sell cookies in New York without a license.
[00:59:55.172 --> 01:00:01.035]  Ohio's trying to pass a state law that cities and counties can't throw out the Patriot Act, amongst other things.
[01:00:01.675 --> 01:00:03.817]  Bush is now going after Syria more than ever.
[01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:09.219]  The bizarre tectonic and volcanic activity going on with Mount St.
[01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.461]  Helens and other regions of the planet.
[01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:12.761]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:14.162 --> 01:00:16.163]  Right now, let's go back to your calls as promised.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.541]  Let's talk to David in Mass.
[01:00:19.561 --> 01:00:20.462]  David, you're on the air.
[01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:20.822]  Welcome.
[01:00:21.162 --> 01:00:21.322]  Hi.
[01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:22.243]  How are you today, Alex?
[01:00:22.263 --> 01:00:22.583]  Good, sir.
[01:00:23.363 --> 01:00:32.968]  Listen, I downloaded last night from PrisonPlanet.tv, 9-11, Martial Law and Rise of the Police State.
[01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:33.528]  It's great.
[01:00:33.548 --> 01:00:34.949]  I have to compliment you.
[01:00:35.209 --> 01:00:35.870]  Well, thank you.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.871]  I want to thank you for being a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.172]  And I put it actually on DVD.
[01:00:41.452 --> 01:00:45.454]  I've got the Windows Media Files, which you have up there.
[01:00:47.237 --> 01:00:56.443]  I remember about a week or two ago, maybe a couple weeks ago, a listener called in asking about how you can compress DVDs to fit on one disc.
[01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.005]  He was asking, you know, a lot of your questions.
[01:01:00.025 --> 01:01:04.207]  Yeah, because the new DVD that's coming out is going to be a DVD-9 because it's two and a half hours.
[01:01:04.267 --> 01:01:04.968]  Yeah, okay.
[01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:08.089]  Have your listeners go to dvd-shrink.org.
[01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:08.730]  Type that in.
[01:01:15.108 --> 01:01:21.181]  The freeware application that will compress a DVD to be able to sit on a 4.7 gig disk.
[01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.234]  What's the quality look like?
[01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:31.917]  The quality is really good because it's not like... because what you have up on your site is compression.
[01:01:31.997 --> 01:01:33.778]  It's MPEG-4, I believe.
[01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:34.078]  No, no.
[01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:40.402]  What I'm asking is when you download the high-quality version, how does it look when it's burned?
[01:01:41.622 --> 01:01:46.045]  It looks... I mean, really, that's more for playing actually on the computer.
[01:01:46.565 --> 01:01:49.407]  For something like Windows Media Player.
[01:01:49.427 --> 01:01:50.747]  No, I understand, but how does it look?
[01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:51.308]  It looks OK?
[01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.528]  It looks pretty good.
[01:01:52.568 --> 01:01:58.551]  It's kind of a little bit rough if you take the resolution up, which DVD will do automatically.
[01:01:59.072 --> 01:02:08.016]  But when you use this shrink application, it will keep the ratio of compression and bit rate and frame rate pretty even.
[01:02:08.657 --> 01:02:12.058]  So it's really good, and it does it with native DVD files.
[01:02:12.138 --> 01:02:14.300]  You know, the .vob, which is really
[01:02:15.655 --> 01:02:22.756]  Impact 2 extension, but I would recommend that because it's a freeware application and people can easily be able to compress.
[01:02:23.776 --> 01:02:29.818]  Do you think people will be able to handle going from a police state to 9-11 to Nazi devil worshippers?
[01:02:32.898 --> 01:02:35.299]  Nazi homosexual devil worshippers, I'm sorry.
[01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:43.480]  Yeah, well I'm hoping so, but I mean I have some tips for you if you want to discuss it off air about video and how to get a higher quality
[01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:47.312]  Videos so people can download maybe even what you have.
[01:02:47.332 --> 01:02:49.953]  You're talking about putting an even higher resolution up on the screen?
[01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:53.174]  Slightly higher, but not enough to totally destroy your bandwidth.
[01:02:53.814 --> 01:03:01.456]  Well, what we've done is we've put it up there, higher bandwidth before, and then even people that supposedly have high connection rates have trouble doing it.
[01:03:01.496 --> 01:03:05.557]  Why don't you just email me at tipsandinfowars.com?
[01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:06.737]  I could do that, absolutely.
[01:03:06.778 --> 01:03:07.918]  Now, I want to tell you another thing.
[01:03:07.998 --> 01:03:09.518]  I was in London about a week ago.
[01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:11.539]  I went to London and
[01:03:13.553 --> 01:03:23.339]  The poor guy who was sitting before we left, poor guy, three or four rows in front of us, just meekly sitting in the row.
[01:03:24.019 --> 01:03:31.164]  And all of a sudden, a state police guy at an airport, a spokesman guy, came off and pulled the guy off.
[01:03:31.524 --> 01:03:33.525]  Just said, sir, you have to come with us.
[01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:36.027]  And escorted him off, and he didn't do anything.
[01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:40.993]  I mean, I found out later what was going on, but it was unbelievable.
[01:03:42.014 --> 01:03:43.656]  Well, what had he supposedly done?
[01:03:43.696 --> 01:03:48.843]  Well, he supposedly wrote something that a woman sitting two seats over didn't like.
[01:03:49.543 --> 01:03:49.944]  Stay there.
[01:03:49.964 --> 01:03:50.725]  I want to hear more about it.
[01:03:53.012 --> 01:03:54.533]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.733 --> 01:03:57.796]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:57.936 --> 01:04:01.838]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:06.121]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.462 --> 01:04:10.224]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:12.186]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.668]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:20.431]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:23.632]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.812 --> 01:04:26.674]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:33.278]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.798 --> 01:04:37.601]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:59.933]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.174 --> 01:05:05.316]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.

[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:20.225]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:20.566 --> 01:05:24.570]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:29.535]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:29.975 --> 01:05:35.841]  Emergency Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:59.831]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:02.672]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:11.416]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:07:00.632 --> 01:07:01.713]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.374 --> 01:07:03.214]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.955 --> 01:07:04.835]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:09.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:13.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:20.607]  Alright, coming up in a few minutes, I'm gonna get into Mount St.
[01:07:20.647 --> 01:07:25.130]  Helens and its latest eruption, what's happening all over the world, volcanic and tectonic activity.
[01:07:26.272 --> 01:07:28.293]  More on thought crimes in America.
[01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:31.234]  You write a fiction story about zombies, you go to jail.
[01:07:31.894 --> 01:07:34.475]  The police know it's fiction, but say, still, you shouldn't write that.
[01:07:34.535 --> 01:07:36.536]  So, why haven't they arrested Stephen King?
[01:07:37.497 --> 01:07:40.818]  But the last segment, David just started telling a story about how...
[01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:45.650]  He was over in England and I guess we're on the flight back or the flight there.
[01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:46.831]  I'm trying to be clear about this.
[01:07:47.391 --> 01:07:54.295]  And you saw somebody get arrested or detained because somebody sitting next to them saw them write something that they thought was dangerous.
[01:07:55.496 --> 01:07:58.498]  I'm glad people are watching out so closely what people write.
[01:07:58.998 --> 01:08:01.059]  Better arrest them or none of us will be safe.
[01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:04.402]  Elaborate on the story please.
[01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:08.364]  Oh yeah, this was the flight actually to Heathrow.
[01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.259]  This was a U.S.
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:10.580]  flight?
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.300]  Yeah, a U.S.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:11.660]  flight.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:25.625]  And the guy was escorted off by a state trooper and I'm guessing some sort of either Customs or FAA or some sort of official airport official.
[01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:27.625]  So he's sitting there and suddenly these guys walk in?
[01:08:27.845 --> 01:08:33.127]  And all he was, I mean, I was looking and the guy just had his head down and he wasn't doing anything.
[01:08:33.187 --> 01:08:37.809]  The woman, two seats over on the left, apparently reported him
[01:08:38.692 --> 01:08:42.193]  To whatever official, because she didn't like what he was writing.
[01:08:42.973 --> 01:08:47.494]  And when they hauled the guy off, he just turned around with this bewildered look in his face.
[01:08:47.534 --> 01:08:52.475]  Look, the new profile for terrorists is blonde hair and blue eyes for racial profiling.
[01:08:53.376 --> 01:08:54.356]  Oh, he was a white guy?
[01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:55.296]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:55.656 --> 01:08:58.717]  I mean, I'm assuming he was British or Irish or something.
[01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:01.872]  Because, I mean, he turned around with this bewildered look.
[01:09:01.972 --> 01:09:04.334]  Did he ever get back on the plane?
[01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:07.636]  Well, I don't know what the status was after that point.
[01:09:07.656 --> 01:09:08.977]  They obviously detained him.
[01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:13.039]  But the thing that I found amazing... How did you find out it was what he'd written?
[01:09:13.059 --> 01:09:15.260]  Was she proud of herself and started announcing it?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.461]  It was whispered back and forth?
[01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:17.421]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:21.904]  On the flight, when we finally got off, the flight was delayed two hours.
[01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:28.548]  And because everybody had to identify their luggage in the overhead, and they had to pull out all the bags from underneath.
[01:09:29.464 --> 01:09:31.166]  The belly of the airplane and inspect them.
[01:09:32.347 --> 01:09:34.869]  And then how did you find out it was over what he was supposedly writing?
[01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:41.656]  Because apparently somebody who was sitting in that row found out that that was what was going on because I guess they talked to the woman.
[01:09:41.696 --> 01:09:47.281]  Look, my wife was with me and she swore, she's in medicine, she swore the woman was on medication.
[01:09:48.464 --> 01:09:54.488]  Just by the look in her eye and the whole flight, the whole six-hour flight, she was rewarded.
[01:09:54.968 --> 01:09:56.970]  She was rewarded with wine.
[01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:59.011]  She was rewarded with wine.
[01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:02.973]  They gave her first-class accommodations and coach.
[01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:04.615]  Oh, she got to move?
[01:10:04.995 --> 01:10:05.915]  Well, she didn't move.
[01:10:05.955 --> 01:10:07.236]  They just kept bringing her stuff.
[01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:10.318]  All the really nice, high-quality wine, everything.
[01:10:10.338 --> 01:10:11.279]  She was rewarded.
[01:10:12.926 --> 01:10:13.907]  It's funny you said that.
[01:10:13.947 --> 01:10:15.407]  You stole a word out of my mouth.
[01:10:15.887 --> 01:10:21.449]  Literally, in Nazi Germany, in Russia, in China today, they encouraged the crazies.
[01:10:21.489 --> 01:10:27.891]  They encouraged just an atmosphere of tattling and reporting and doing all of this.
[01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:30.731]  And it has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:35.233]  And now the cadres of TSA were sent to DC for Bush's coronation.
[01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:39.834]  They had one cop or military personnel for every person that showed up for the parade.
[01:10:40.951 --> 01:10:43.012]  And they're now going to train the rest of the country.
[01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:48.856]  The checkpoints that will also be paid for via the toll roads are going to have the same mode.
[01:10:48.876 --> 01:10:52.498]  They're teaching us to be good little tattletales, Alex.
[01:10:52.898 --> 01:10:53.418]  Well, they are.
[01:10:53.478 --> 01:10:56.160]  In fact, I'm glad you called and I appreciate the call.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:56.660]  Take care.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.602]  Let me, since you mentioned that, let me go ahead and get to this now.
[01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:01.723]  I mentioned this yesterday, but let me get into it.
[01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:03.824]  This is out of the register.
[01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:06.065]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[01:11:06.225 --> 01:11:08.967]  Student in high school zombie terror threat.
[01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.112]  This article is written tongue-in-cheek, but it's written off the facts.
[01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.273]  And this is our comment.
[01:11:15.373 --> 01:11:18.255]  We have highlighted this case before, but this new article sheds new light.
[01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:23.478]  It was actually his own grandparents that informed on him they would have been proud members of the East German Stasi.
[01:11:24.498 --> 01:11:25.599]  Here's the article.
[01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:27.040]  An 18-year-old U.S.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:32.803]  student is today behind bars after police uncovered his plot to raise a zombie army and attack his high school.
[01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:34.624]  The wannabe Papa Doc
[01:11:35.845 --> 01:11:47.133]  Chilling plan was uncovered after the youth's grandparents discovered his written proposal for the outrage in Winchester, Kentucky, Lex18TV reported.
[01:11:47.713 --> 01:11:53.618]  Mercifully, William Poole was cuffed before he could execute his macabre scheme.
[01:11:53.658 --> 01:12:01.023]  He faces a secondary felony, terrorist-threatening charge after investigators discovered materials at Poole's home that outlined
[01:12:01.866 --> 01:12:06.069]  That outline possible acts of violence aimed at students, teachers, and police.
[01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:19.140]  Now we have the police and the Associated Press admitting that it's a story of zombies busting out of the ground and killing people and then he machine guns them, but because it mentions him with a machine gun killing zombies, that's enough folks.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.443]  Naturally, by the way, the funny thing is, I remember an article I wrote.
[01:12:24.604 --> 01:12:26.786]  In the 8th grade they said, write a fiction story.
[01:12:27.705 --> 01:12:32.626]  And it was a story of me and my football buddy when we're, years later, you know, 16.
[01:12:32.666 --> 01:12:33.607]  I'm fantasizing of being 16.
[01:12:35.067 --> 01:12:42.109]  And zombies bust out of the ground and we are shotgunning them from the back of the pickup truck.
[01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:47.491]  I mean, I actually, I remember the teacher going, this is a very lively article, Alex.
[01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:48.831]  You should be a fiction writer.
[01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:50.832]  I remember getting an A+.
[01:12:52.975 --> 01:12:57.098]  In fact, somewhere in storage is like many of my papers and work for many years.
[01:12:57.178 --> 01:12:58.259]  I bet I still got that.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:04.464]  But it was like a 15-page, you know, little mini-story I wrote of zombies attacking the school.
[01:13:04.544 --> 01:13:05.805]  And I may be arrested, folks.
[01:13:05.885 --> 01:13:11.889]  I mean, I wrote a book, a little article, of course, total fiction, let me be careful here, of zombies.
[01:13:11.969 --> 01:13:13.330]  I mean, zombies aren't real.
[01:13:14.351 --> 01:13:14.712]  Okay?
[01:13:14.832 --> 01:13:18.414]  And it's just funny that I have written this story.
[01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:21.797]  And I guess if I was in school today, I'd have been arrested.
[01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.693]  Naturally, uh, in fact he didn't mention friends or anybody.
[01:13:25.733 --> 01:13:43.396]  I mean, in the article I wrote, uh, I mean, the little art story, I remember, uh, uh, Corey Strange, black friend of mine, uh, in the article, he was in the class with me too, uh, and he ended up writing some article similar to mine, uh, we're fighting zombies with shotguns.
[01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:45.916]  And boy, uh, folks, I may be arrested.
[01:13:45.956 --> 01:13:49.737]  I mean, I wrote an article, uh, I don't know,
[01:13:50.476 --> 01:13:51.456]  Seventeen years ago?
[01:13:51.516 --> 01:13:52.016]  Eighteen years?
[01:13:52.077 --> 01:13:53.237]  No, almost twenty years ago.
[01:13:55.517 --> 01:13:56.138]  Similar to this.
[01:13:56.718 --> 01:13:58.278]  In fact, I'm confessing right now.
[01:13:58.298 --> 01:13:59.919]  I'm not even being sarcastic, folks.
[01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:04.880]  I mean, part of me is going, did I even mention I wrote a fiction article?
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.021]  I mean, I better not ever try to write a Stephen King novel.
[01:14:09.101 --> 01:14:18.244]  Naturally, the fledgling baron Samedi, mentioning Papa Doc, who was into all this stuff from
[01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.616]  Uh, Haiti and the rest of it.
[01:14:21.978 --> 01:14:23.906]  Naturally, the fledgling baron, uh...
[01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:29.697]  Samidi has claimed that the writings were nothing more than a short story he penned for an English class.
[01:14:29.717 --> 01:14:32.019]  He said, my story is based on fiction.
[01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:33.219]  It's a fake story.
[01:14:33.239 --> 01:14:33.760]  I made it up.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.763]  I've been working on one of my short stories, and the short story they found was about zombies.
[01:14:38.823 --> 01:14:40.804]  Yes, it did say a high school.
[01:14:40.864 --> 01:14:42.565]  It was about a high school overrun by zombies.
[01:14:43.105 --> 01:14:45.126]  It didn't mention anybody who lives in Clark County.
[01:14:45.146 --> 01:14:47.588]  It didn't mention George Rogers Clark High School.
[01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:49.629]  It didn't mention the principal or cops.
[01:14:49.749 --> 01:14:50.049]  Nothing.
[01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.971]  Half the people at the high school know me.
[01:14:51.991 --> 01:14:54.112]  They know I'm not that stupid, that crazy.
[01:14:55.447 --> 01:15:01.074]  Despite the, uh, protestations, the authorities have wisely decided to cage the miscreant youth.
[01:15:01.434 --> 01:15:04.518]  Winchester Police Director Steven Caudill noted...
[01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:12.424]  Anytime you make any threat or possess a matter involving a school or function, it's a felony in the state of Kentucky.
[01:15:12.444 --> 01:15:25.669]  Accordingly, a judge last week reflected the seriousness of the threatening of your high school with annihilation at the hands of the undead by raising Poole's bond from $1,000 to $5,000 at the request of prosecutors.
[01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:30.331]  He is currently reflecting on his folly in the Clark County Detention Center.
[01:15:31.132 --> 01:15:34.553]  You know, I even wrote articles where I was an astronaut fighting aliens.
[01:15:35.758 --> 01:15:36.658]  I wrote stories.
[01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.040]  Am I now threatening NASA?
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:49.684]  I remember writing an article in high school, probably a twenty-pager, where we're on some Mars base fighting aliens.
[01:15:50.744 --> 01:15:54.906]  Have I threatened the Mars base?
[01:15:54.986 --> 01:16:02.509]  But the point is, they've got these video games where you rape and kill women and get bonus points, run over old ladies.
[01:16:02.549 --> 01:16:03.369]  I mean, I've been
[01:16:04.705 --> 01:16:05.374]  In the...
[01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:10.046]  Computer stores, when these games are on, don't have a look in there where you can play the games.
[01:16:10.086 --> 01:16:10.747]  And I've seen it.
[01:16:11.227 --> 01:16:14.509]  You know, young kids sitting there playing it, where you run over old ladies and get bonus points.
[01:16:14.829 --> 01:16:18.251]  They got games like Dungeon Keeper, where you kidnap children and torture them and get bonus points.
[01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:19.472]  And all these games.
[01:16:20.052 --> 01:16:22.874]  So the kids simulate all this, and there's all these zombie movies.
[01:16:22.894 --> 01:16:24.895]  There's like three of them that have come out in the last year.
[01:16:25.516 --> 01:16:31.699]  And so you write an article about zombies, and they admit that he wrote an article where zombies overtake the school.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.341]  Doesn't even mention his school, but he's in school.
[01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:35.722]  I mean, folks, this is insanity.
[01:16:36.457 --> 01:16:52.449]  And again, you've heard of the articles, the stories, where the honor roll student, football captain, you know, his dad's a captain in the Marine Corps, he writes an article about his dad and Iraq and his backpack and his web gear and his M-16.
[01:16:52.469 --> 01:16:59.214]  He writes the word M-16, he's arrested, or the case of a girl who was going to be valedictorian.
[01:17:00.747 --> 01:17:04.188]  Last week of school, she's putting on a party for an after-school meeting.
[01:17:05.048 --> 01:17:11.969]  Has the little paper tablecloth, the little box of Dixie spoons, knives, and forks.
[01:17:12.069 --> 01:17:14.330]  We've all, I guess, bought those before as terrorists.
[01:17:15.150 --> 01:17:20.171]  And the cop looked in the back of her car and saw the cake and cookies and Coca-Cola.
[01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:22.752]  I remember we even had her family on.
[01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.332]  And they arrested her.
[01:17:25.472 --> 01:17:28.853]  And then they later released her, dropped the charges, but she wasn't allowed to graduate.
[01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:32.093]  And then she had to go to summer school and get a GED over it.
[01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:33.294]  It would have been valedictorian.
[01:17:33.574 --> 01:17:43.560]  There's been other cases where it was another girl on the honor roll who actually made the big mistake of she was moving out that week to go to college to get started early.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.062]  You know, this is what top honor roll students do.
[01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:57.069]  And the cop saw in the back of her car the furniture and the plastic case with the butter knives
[01:17:58.110 --> 01:18:03.193]  And knives and forks, but the butter knife, you know, did have a little bit of a shredded edge, like most butter knives do.
[01:18:03.933 --> 01:18:06.074]  And I'm going to admit, I own some of these butter knives, folks.
[01:18:06.174 --> 01:18:10.816]  I have several sets of butter knives that are similar to this, and she was arrested.
[01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:14.038]  And, I mean, I see these cases every few days now.
[01:18:15.398 --> 01:18:24.883]  And so this guy is supposedly riding something that somebody didn't like on an airplane, according to the listener, and, you know, he's carried off.
[01:18:26.613 --> 01:18:29.395]  But, I mean, we've got Homeland Security going to Rubik's Cube sellers.
[01:18:29.475 --> 01:18:32.737]  We've got Homeland Security going to vets who, uh, complain too much.
[01:18:32.757 --> 01:18:35.779]  They say they didn't threaten anybody, but complaining is an act of terror.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.622]  Uh, pot dealers, topless bars, it's all terrorism.
[01:18:40.963 --> 01:18:46.987]  And, uh, they have a law they almost passed in Oregon where downloading music civilly is a life in prison.
[01:18:47.888 --> 01:18:48.928]  So that's what they're trying to do.
[01:18:48.989 --> 01:18:50.029]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:18:53.163 --> 01:18:57.989]  This is Jeff Donovan and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[01:18:58.089 --> 01:19:01.233]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[01:19:01.273 --> 01:19:02.074]  Her name was Joni.
[01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:05.919]  She'd already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days and she was so excited.
[01:19:06.019 --> 01:19:09.744]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[01:19:09.944 --> 01:19:14.648]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[01:19:15.008 --> 01:19:16.530]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.492]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[01:19:19.532 --> 01:19:26.398]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry.
[01:19:26.438 --> 01:19:28.319]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[01:19:28.379 --> 01:19:29.320]  It's a great product.
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.161]  And you're going to let people try this for free for two weeks?
[01:19:32.241 --> 01:19:35.363]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[01:19:35.383 --> 01:19:36.803]  You don't pay anything up front.
[01:19:36.843 --> 01:19:41.846]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[01:19:41.866 --> 01:19:42.266]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[01:19:42.286 --> 01:19:42.386]  1-888-223-2838.
[01:19:42.406 --> 01:19:43.827]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[01:19:53.737 --> 01:19:55.218]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:19:55.518 --> 01:20:00.099]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.781]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[01:20:53.260 --> 01:21:01.886]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:21:02.087 --> 01:21:13.375]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:21:13.595 --> 01:21:16.217]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:16.577 --> 01:21:23.042]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:21:23.182 --> 01:21:25.084]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:21:25.264 --> 01:21:31.289]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:21:31.529 --> 01:21:37.073]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:42.900]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.596 --> 01:21:55.938]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:56.198 --> 01:22:00.041]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:22:00.361 --> 01:22:01.182]  Read the labels.
[01:22:01.602 --> 01:22:05.725]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:05.945 --> 01:22:10.148]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:10.528 --> 01:22:15.392]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:22:15.772 --> 01:22:19.354]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:24.877]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:27.898]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:22:55.734 --> 01:23:01.758]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:05.320]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:32.758]  The bottom line is this, while the stimuli for violence and murder and death is being totally normalized, the government's telling you torture's good and terrorizing you with terroristic threats that, you know, Al-Qaeda's gonna nuke you any minute if you don't give all your rights up, people for doing absolutely nothing, obviously writing fiction articles or having plastic knives, you know, to cut the cake, are being arrested.
[01:23:33.579 --> 01:23:35.200]  Or just writing the word gun.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:36.721]  We have zero tolerance.
[01:23:36.781 --> 01:23:37.662]  It's a policy.
[01:23:37.702 --> 01:23:40.624]  Is there a law against writing the word gun?
[01:23:41.024 --> 01:23:41.244]  No.
[01:23:41.264 --> 01:23:43.866]  I guess we should strike it from the encyclopedia.
[01:23:44.326 --> 01:23:45.026]  The dictionary.
[01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:48.729]  But it's happening, folks, and it's not a joke.
[01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:57.134]  Let's go ahead and talk to Harvey in Florida, then Tyler, Roger, Joanne, Ron, and others.
[01:23:57.174 --> 01:23:57.774]  Go ahead, Harvey.
[01:23:58.435 --> 01:23:59.415]  Hello there, Mr. Alex.
[01:23:59.515 --> 01:24:00.296]  How are you today?
[01:24:00.316 --> 01:24:00.976]  Fine.
[01:24:02.208 --> 01:24:06.150]  It seems, you know, I heard Bush yesterday, he says the torch of freedom is on the move.
[01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:09.192]  He said what?
[01:24:09.532 --> 01:24:11.473]  The torch of freedom is on the move.
[01:24:12.574 --> 01:24:13.694]  What, did he slip up again?
[01:24:13.714 --> 01:24:18.497]  I mean, the things you're talking about tells me the torch of freedom is out.
[01:24:18.677 --> 01:24:21.298]  The light of the torch of freedom has been extinguished.
[01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:26.101]  Oh, the torch of freedom, not... The torch of freedom is on the move.
[01:24:26.141 --> 01:24:29.883]  That was in his speech in front of the warmongers convention yesterday.
[01:24:31.812 --> 01:24:36.893]  Well, you know, the torch used at the Olympics and the rings were designed by Adolf Hitler.
[01:24:36.913 --> 01:24:38.213]  Those are not even Olympic symbols.
[01:24:38.233 --> 01:24:42.274]  And when you hear the word torch, it's high-level Illuminati symbolism.
[01:24:42.554 --> 01:24:42.854]  Mm-hmm.
[01:24:43.574 --> 01:24:47.035]  Oh, this is getting to be the theater of the absurd.
[01:24:47.075 --> 01:24:49.015]  Anything out of this administration is still absurd.
[01:24:49.035 --> 01:24:50.135]  Well, this is freedom, sir.
[01:24:50.655 --> 01:24:51.836]  Everything that's happening is freedom.
[01:24:52.196 --> 01:24:59.957]  Well, when he was talking also in the last few days about Syria has to get out of Lebanon or else, what about us being in Iraq, Alex?
[01:25:01.215 --> 01:25:02.136]  Well, that's different.
[01:25:02.236 --> 01:25:03.737]  We're halfway across the world.
[01:25:05.138 --> 01:25:06.619]  Rob them, loot them, kill them.
[01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:10.082]  Now, now, now.
[01:25:10.202 --> 01:25:11.123]  We're liberating them.
[01:25:11.143 --> 01:25:11.903]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:12.384 --> 01:25:13.685]  Tyler, in Colorado.
[01:25:13.705 --> 01:25:14.285]  You're on the air.
[01:25:14.325 --> 01:25:14.646]  Welcome.
[01:25:16.227 --> 01:25:16.467]  Hello?
[01:25:16.827 --> 01:25:17.067]  Yes.
[01:25:18.248 --> 01:25:19.269]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:20.250]  Pretty good.
[01:25:21.111 --> 01:25:23.272]  Hey, I thought I knew a martial law film.
[01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:24.353]  It's awesome.
[01:25:24.413 --> 01:25:24.753]  I love it.
[01:25:24.773 --> 01:25:26.655]  I've watched all your films, Outside of Prison Planet.
[01:25:27.776 --> 01:25:30.418]  But I saw a show on TLC, Sunday night.
[01:25:31.218 --> 01:25:33.139]  Uh, called, called, uh, Trouble Next Door.
[01:25:34.059 --> 01:25:38.741]  And they were talking to neighbors about this guy who had, uh, some artwork out in his yard.
[01:25:39.242 --> 01:25:43.143]  He had, like, some planes out there and, uh, some, you know, exoskeletons of planes.
[01:25:44.004 --> 01:25:44.884]  And some other stuff.
[01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.405]  And, uh, his neighbors thought it was, like, trash.
[01:25:47.645 --> 01:25:50.166]  So they had filed a whole bunch of complaints.
[01:25:50.466 --> 01:25:52.487]  The city got up, uh, $600,000 worth of fines against him.
[01:25:55.494 --> 01:25:59.695]  And then I ended up throwing him in jail for a year for felony littering.
[01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:01.396]  Yeah, that was in Florida, wasn't it?
[01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:02.956]  Yeah, it was in Florida.
[01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:13.979]  Well, look, sir, they will move out into the country, zone the country, and then tell people to get, you know, their artwork, junk cars, whatever, off their own land.
[01:26:14.819 --> 01:26:18.260]  Yeah, I mean, I had this happen in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is where I'm from.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.481]  I had my neighbors do this to me.
[01:26:20.881 --> 01:26:22.922]  I had a Jeep that I was working on in my driveway.
[01:26:22.962 --> 01:26:24.222]  I had the city come and fine us
[01:26:24.824 --> 01:26:47.170]  Because we didn't have a lawn, we had a natural... Well look, one of the first big TV reports I did about 8 years ago, this old World War II vet had 3 inch grass, but the rich yuppies wanted the house he built back in the 50's, because now it was worth like a million dollars, and they went in and started giving him these giant fines, so it was $2,000 a day, just for grass!
[01:26:47.871 --> 01:26:49.351]  Yeah, I mean... So listen, listen.
[01:26:50.095 --> 01:26:55.156]  I went and I shot video of all the neighbors who had higher grass with all their Lexuses and Mercedes.
[01:26:55.976 --> 01:26:59.417]  Then I went to the city council people's houses and showed their grass being higher.
[01:27:00.077 --> 01:27:03.318]  Then I went to the health department doing the fines and showed three foot grass.
[01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.438]  And boy, they dropped that like a hot potato.
[01:27:06.758 --> 01:27:12.780]  Yeah, but I mean, my mom had to go against the board and show that the plants she had in her yard were native to New Mexico.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.640]  And because she didn't have a lawn, she didn't want, they have a drought there all the time.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.721]  Yeah, zero escape.
[01:27:17.741 --> 01:27:18.981]  There's a lot of that in the West.
[01:27:19.511 --> 01:27:24.433]  Yeah, but this guy, they're talking to his neighbors and they were comparing him to Ted Kaczynski because he was smart.
[01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:32.255]  They're saying, well, this guy's like Ted Kaczynski, you know, he's going to be a mass murderer because he's a smart guy and he defends his Second Amendment rights and Constitutional rights.
[01:27:32.355 --> 01:27:35.036]  They have this on TV implying he was a serial killer.
[01:27:35.436 --> 01:27:35.976]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:35.996 --> 01:27:37.717]  Well, I mean, this is what they do.
[01:27:37.737 --> 01:27:40.958]  It's like with a serial killer up in Missouri.
[01:27:41.278 --> 01:27:42.838]  They keep going, he was a family man.
[01:27:42.878 --> 01:27:43.558]  He went to church.
[01:27:43.579 --> 01:27:44.899]  Well, he was also a government official.
[01:27:45.639 --> 01:27:50.844]  See, now, people who are smart, people who are quiet, they're probably serial killers.
[01:27:51.865 --> 01:27:54.508]  Yeah, because they're smart and they follow our Constitution.
[01:27:54.528 --> 01:27:58.071]  A lot of them, he sued his neighbors, implying he's a Ted Kaczynski.
[01:27:59.905 --> 01:28:00.226]  I don't know.
[01:28:00.266 --> 01:28:02.108]  His neighbor didn't even talk to him.
[01:28:02.148 --> 01:28:03.349]  Well, we haven't even talked to him.
[01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:07.493]  I know, but you're saying they had the neighbors on TV and he was a Ted Kaczynski.
[01:28:07.933 --> 01:28:11.537]  And the guy who was interviewing him was being, you know, not nice to him at all.
[01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:12.718]  He was being real mean to him.
[01:28:12.738 --> 01:28:18.324]  Well, see, they're giving us the message that you don't follow our rules, we're going to treat you like a serial killer.
[01:28:18.844 --> 01:28:19.465]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:19.485 --> 01:28:22.508]  I also saw a cop show where they arrested a guy, put him in the car,
[01:28:23.432 --> 01:28:26.935]  The guy then pulled him back out and hogtied him and threw him back in the car.
[01:28:27.095 --> 01:28:28.016]  Now that was a little excessive.
[01:28:28.056 --> 01:28:32.459]  I don't see the need to hogtie him when he didn't resist to begin with and he was already in the back of the car.
[01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.761]  Well, the person may have been with Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:34.781 --> 01:28:35.501]  Thank you for the call.
[01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:37.142]  Everything's to fight Al-Qaeda now.
[01:28:37.643 --> 01:28:39.464]  Keep your rights up and they'll keep you safe.
[01:28:39.484 --> 01:28:40.905]  The nice men in black ski masks.
[01:28:43.487 --> 01:28:44.408]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.868 --> 01:28:46.529]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:50.072]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.083 --> 01:28:59.606]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:28:59.766 --> 01:29:00.827]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:29:00.947 --> 01:29:01.828]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:29:01.928 --> 01:29:04.769]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:29:04.969 --> 01:29:09.832]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:29:10.092 --> 01:29:11.173]  Check out this new product.
[01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:12.454]  It's called No B.O.
[01:29:12.534 --> 01:29:14.214]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:29:14.595 --> 01:29:16.676]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:29:16.696 --> 01:29:18.297]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:29:18.457 --> 01:29:18.617]  Look.
[01:29:18.817 --> 01:29:21.140]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.026]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:29.430]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:34.976]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:29:35.056 --> 01:29:35.817]  Try No-BO.
[01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:36.919]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.982]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:29:41.162 --> 01:29:44.023]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[01:29:44.224 --> 01:29:46.685]  Check out their website at No-BO.com.
[01:29:46.845 --> 01:29:50.127]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-BO.
[01:29:50.327 --> 01:29:51.348]  That's No-BO.com.
[01:29:53.593 --> 01:29:58.815]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.975 --> 01:30:07.058]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:14.360]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.821]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:21.805]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.985 --> 01:30:27.088]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:36.074]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:30:36.335 --> 01:30:39.857]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.738 --> 01:30:42.219]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.350 --> 01:31:00.835]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.256 --> 01:31:05.500]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:12.767]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.147 --> 01:31:19.253]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.413 --> 01:31:20.614]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.954 --> 01:31:23.898]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.058 --> 01:31:26.080]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:33.629]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:37.314]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:31:41.217 --> 01:31:42.178]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.238 --> 01:31:42.439]  Call today.
[01:31:42.499 --> 01:31:43.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.682]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.711 --> 01:32:09.275]  I was just talking to Scott during the break that runs the show up at The Network in Minnesota.
[01:32:10.095 --> 01:32:11.296]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:32:12.817 --> 01:32:18.542]  And he said, yeah, back when I was about 10 for our first writing class, I wrote a story about zombies.
[01:32:18.602 --> 01:32:20.843]  I think that's a pretty popular topic for young boys.
[01:32:21.844 --> 01:32:23.045]  Well, not anymore.
[01:32:23.225 --> 01:32:28.249]  You write an article about zombies busting out of graves, you're going to jail.
[01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:31.732]  I mean, folks, do you realize what a big deal this is?
[01:32:31.912 --> 01:32:33.333]  The mind control we're talking about?
[01:32:34.703 --> 01:32:36.603]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:32:36.683 --> 01:32:37.624]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:32:37.704 --> 01:32:38.144]  Go ahead.
[01:32:40.504 --> 01:32:41.864]  Roger, you're on the air, sir.
[01:32:42.784 --> 01:32:44.145]  Okay, Roger's not there.
[01:32:45.225 --> 01:32:47.165]  Let's talk to Joanne in Maryland.
[01:32:47.225 --> 01:32:48.285]  Joanne, you're on the air.
[01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:48.665]  Welcome.
[01:32:49.566 --> 01:32:50.066]  Hello.
[01:32:50.366 --> 01:32:50.746]  Hello.
[01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:53.546]  I haven't talked to you for a long time because I couldn't get in.
[01:32:54.066 --> 01:32:55.127]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:32:55.207 --> 01:32:55.687]  Thank you.
[01:32:56.647 --> 01:33:00.087]  I have a problem.
[01:33:00.327 --> 01:33:02.888]  I picked up my Saturday's paper and
[01:33:04.574 --> 01:33:06.075]  I don't live very far from the water.
[01:33:06.095 --> 01:33:11.577]  Approximately 35 miles or 30 miles from where I'm living.
[01:33:11.857 --> 01:33:14.178]  And here's what my headline says, Bombs Away!
[01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:14.519]  U.S.
[01:33:14.599 --> 01:33:20.281]  Navy Targets Bloodsworth Island for 24-Hour Military Training Exercise.
[01:33:21.342 --> 01:33:33.267]  With the United States involved in a war, the Navy hopes to expand practices year-round, day and night, to include bombing,
[01:33:33.871 --> 01:33:36.474]  Drafting runs and live fire on the islands.
[01:33:36.554 --> 01:33:41.999]  Navy personnel would fire machine guns and other small weapons during simulated combat.
[01:33:42.299 --> 01:33:45.502]  Now, how close is this to populated areas?
[01:33:46.003 --> 01:33:47.023]  Very close by water.
[01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:48.325]  Very, very close.
[01:33:48.385 --> 01:33:49.526]  Okay, a mile?
[01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:51.808]  Twenty-six, well, oh, fifty.
[01:33:52.529 --> 01:33:54.431]  A mile, probably.
[01:33:55.572 --> 01:33:57.594]  I'm looking at the map that it shows in there.
[01:33:58.891 --> 01:34:00.652]  I don't really know, because it's not that far away.
[01:34:01.292 --> 01:34:02.353]  Probably just a few miles.
[01:34:02.373 --> 01:34:04.934]  Well, this is in Maryland, off of a lake.
[01:34:04.995 --> 01:34:08.196]  I mean, how... It's off the Chesapeake Bay.
[01:34:08.757 --> 01:34:09.657]  Okay.
[01:34:09.857 --> 01:34:13.559]  Is this island a military reserve?
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:21.084]  Well, back before World War II, evidently, because they made mention of... In World War II, they also had...
[01:34:22.974 --> 01:34:31.178]  Well, let me comment on this, and I appreciate your call, Joanne.
[01:34:32.538 --> 01:34:36.500]  What you're going through is nothing compared to what other people have gone through.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:46.905]  What was it, two years ago, a West Texas town, and this was in the Associated Press, we even had the mayor on, a B-2 bomber dropped
[01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:50.672]  A dummy bomb, but it still weighed like a thousand pounds.
[01:34:51.212 --> 01:34:57.435]  It hit a tree coming in and hit the house, went through the bedroom, into the bathroom, and four feet into the ground.
[01:34:58.876 --> 01:34:59.917]  Wild people were home.
[01:35:00.317 --> 01:35:01.417]  We've had Fort Hood.
[01:35:02.178 --> 01:35:04.679]  That is about, I don't know, three times the size of Dallas.
[01:35:04.819 --> 01:35:07.881]  I mean, Fort Hood is the biggest U.S.
[01:35:08.061 --> 01:35:10.222]  military reservation in the world.
[01:35:11.623 --> 01:35:15.505]  Arguably, they say, they say there may be a Russian one that's bigger.
[01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:18.812]  I mean, it's gigantic.
[01:35:18.852 --> 01:35:20.433]  It's a large portion of the state.
[01:35:21.714 --> 01:35:22.855]  I don't have the square miles here.
[01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:25.336]  When I say three times bigger than Dallas, it's much bigger than that.
[01:35:25.376 --> 01:35:28.038]  I mean, it stretches for over a hundred miles.
[01:35:28.318 --> 01:35:29.539]  I mean, it's just huge.
[01:35:31.261 --> 01:35:34.403]  But no, they roll their artillery up right up to the edges of it.
[01:35:34.823 --> 01:35:37.345]  And a bunch of times they've blown up houses, barns.
[01:35:37.385 --> 01:35:38.586]  This didn't used to happen, by the way.
[01:35:38.626 --> 01:35:40.147]  This was in the last couple years.
[01:35:40.607 --> 01:35:41.928]  Cows, horses.
[01:35:42.829 --> 01:35:46.011]  I mean, giant artillery just shooting all over the place.
[01:35:47.228 --> 01:35:49.229]  And I don't know why that's happening now.
[01:35:50.809 --> 01:35:52.350]  But let's talk about what's really serious.
[01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:55.011]  The admitted conditioning.
[01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:59.652]  The Pentagon, and there are Rand Corporation documents on this.
[01:36:01.133 --> 01:36:02.513]  This has been in the mainstream news.
[01:36:03.094 --> 01:36:09.276]  It's been in the Houston Chronicle, Austin American Statesman, San Antonio Express News, Corpus Christi Caller Times.
[01:36:11.116 --> 01:36:15.338]  Now the Kingsville Record or whatever it is, it's all in my film Police State 2000.
[01:36:18.268 --> 01:36:28.277]  That you'll be sitting in a Texas town and 8 to 12 black helicopters will show up with Slavic troops along with U.S.
[01:36:28.317 --> 01:36:43.950]  troops and they'll pre-lease a building, tell no one they're coming, blow it up, it's got fires shooting out of it, people start having heart attacks, I mean they'll do it 200, 300 feet from a nursing home like Casa Ricarta in Kingsville, and I've been there in the morning when the building's still smoking.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:49.321]  In that case, they had the police pull out three days before into their new police station.
[01:36:49.341 --> 01:36:51.722]  The military covertly leased it.
[01:36:52.262 --> 01:36:55.423]  I guess to have the added freak-out of a police station being attacked.
[01:36:55.784 --> 01:36:57.144]  Right in downtown Kingsville.
[01:36:57.964 --> 01:36:59.145]  And man, they hit them and hit them hard.
[01:36:59.165 --> 01:37:01.806]  Then we go talk to the city manager and he admits it all.
[01:37:01.846 --> 01:37:03.186]  Then we go talk to Kingsville.
[01:37:04.046 --> 01:37:05.127]  Other officials.
[01:37:05.147 --> 01:37:07.067]  The emergency manager says it's horrible.
[01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:09.868]  It's part of PDD 25 for martial law.
[01:37:10.369 --> 01:37:12.969]  We have that gentleman.
[01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:14.650]  He was very upset about it.
[01:37:15.635 --> 01:37:16.816]  And he's a veteran himself.
[01:37:16.836 --> 01:37:25.179]  And then we go over to Alice, Texas, and sit down with the police chief, and this is in the film, and he goes, yeah, foreign troops were here, but I'm not at liberty to talk about them.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:34.043]  And then, of course, a year before that, in Miami, they had a drill, 1 AM, and a bunch of machine gun bullets.
[01:37:34.989 --> 01:37:49.773]  Didn't hit the traps they supposedly were shooting at in the warehouse, and shot into an all-night restaurant, shattering a man's glass of orange juice and embedding in the table, one inch from his hand, and another one hit the wall in the diner, a foot from a woman's head.
[01:37:52.673 --> 01:38:02.596]  And we had a Delta Force helicopter crash into a, in 98, into a skyscraper in Houston, killed all aboard, part of a training op.
[01:38:04.272 --> 01:38:12.818]  And then we had Ali Philippus, the longtime police chief of San Antonio, Army intelligence in his own right, I mean, he's not against the military.
[01:38:14.519 --> 01:38:16.421]  We went down and interviewed him, and it was in the local newspaper.
[01:38:16.461 --> 01:38:25.967]  They tried to bribe him with a satchel of cash, and tried to bribe other officials, Delta Force, Special Combat Applications Group, and he said, no, you're not going to terrorize people.
[01:38:26.448 --> 01:38:32.372]  You guys, right here in San Antonio, have hundreds and hundreds of square miles of bases.
[01:38:33.092 --> 01:38:33.913]  You're not going to do it.
[01:38:36.983 --> 01:38:40.925]  And he got spanked by the city officials after the cash was delivered.
[01:38:43.107 --> 01:38:45.628]  But he still would not allow it there in the city.
[01:38:46.148 --> 01:38:52.272]  So they went right into the Fort Sam Houston, the big hospital base, right off the major highways.
[01:38:52.312 --> 01:38:54.993]  The building they attacked was right on the expressway.
[01:38:55.314 --> 01:38:56.454]  This time they did announce it.
[01:38:57.015 --> 01:39:01.237]  And people got to see these Blackhawks come in and all the explosions of the buildings.
[01:39:01.897 --> 01:39:02.718]  Then the next day,
[01:39:04.358 --> 01:39:08.420]  We go down there and there's Delta Force up in the building and guys with cameras.
[01:39:09.701 --> 01:39:11.122]  And this is an open base for the public.
[01:39:11.162 --> 01:39:12.042]  It's a hospital base.
[01:39:13.303 --> 01:39:17.125]  We have troops come over, grab our camera, put guns to our heads.
[01:39:18.126 --> 01:39:21.127]  This is before 9-11 asks us if we're terrorists, you know, me and Mike Hanson.
[01:39:22.848 --> 01:39:27.351]  And it was picked up by WorldNet Daily and a couple other publications has happened.
[01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:30.232]  And they take our videotape and they erased it.
[01:39:32.473 --> 01:39:33.554]  And then gave it back to us.
[01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:37.132]  And the camera didn't work after that, of course, mysteriously.
[01:39:38.952 --> 01:39:40.453]  So this is America, folks.
[01:39:41.593 --> 01:39:53.977]  But, uh, then I went to Brooksville, Florida, in what, 2000, to cover Delta Force and the Regular Army doing a giant drill of the takeover of the town.
[01:39:55.857 --> 01:39:58.998]  And we tried, and we got video of this, we go up and talk to locals in the town,
[01:40:00.191 --> 01:40:01.132]  Oh, you're Alex Jones.
[01:40:01.172 --> 01:40:02.732]  I've been told by the troops not to talk to you.
[01:40:02.752 --> 01:40:04.693]  We're talking to town, I don't know, like 50,000 people.
[01:40:05.634 --> 01:40:07.015]  I mean, I'm just walking down the streets.
[01:40:07.895 --> 01:40:09.176]  I've been having the drills every night.
[01:40:09.796 --> 01:40:11.357]  They're going, we're not supposed to talk to you.
[01:40:11.397 --> 01:40:12.057]  You're crazy.
[01:40:12.077 --> 01:40:12.837]  You're dangerous.
[01:40:12.878 --> 01:40:14.518]  I go, oh, the Army's telling you this.
[01:40:16.459 --> 01:40:17.980]  And, uh, then another neighbor walks over.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:19.301]  Yeah, the troops were in my yard.
[01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:21.062]  You know, all this stuff's going on.
[01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:27.565]  And so, we're on the railroad property behind it.
[01:40:28.095 --> 01:40:29.976]  Which is just, you know, state property.
[01:40:30.376 --> 01:40:31.537]  There's a park right by it.
[01:40:32.578 --> 01:40:37.380]  And man, all of a sudden these dune buggies come roaring out at us, men in black uniforms.
[01:40:38.501 --> 01:40:41.582]  And, you know what, I wanted to keep videotaping, so of course I evaded them.
[01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:42.683]  And what's the military doing?
[01:40:43.043 --> 01:40:48.286]  Chasing me around at a city park in Brooksville, Florida, north of Tampa.
[01:40:49.387 --> 01:40:50.587]  And they had machine guns.
[01:40:51.968 --> 01:40:55.070]  And there's guys with machine guns chasing us.
[01:40:57.421 --> 01:40:58.141]  Through the woods.
[01:40:59.022 --> 01:41:03.465]  Every time I turn on my night vision camera, I couldn't film unless I turned the camera on, and that's like a giant spotlight to them.
[01:41:04.185 --> 01:41:11.389]  So, I mean, all I've got is, there's some footage, like helicopters above us, and, you know, eyewitnesses, and we go knock on the door.
[01:41:11.429 --> 01:41:11.929]  What'd you see?
[01:41:11.989 --> 01:41:14.211]  I saw a man in a black helmet with a dune buggy chasing you!
[01:41:14.671 --> 01:41:15.712]  And so we've got all that.
[01:41:15.772 --> 01:41:17.253]  I mean, it's just part of the video.
[01:41:18.513 --> 01:41:20.614]  And then, and then we go into the Sheriff's Department.
[01:41:20.634 --> 01:41:24.697]  We walk in real kindly, and go, Hi, I'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[01:41:25.407 --> 01:41:27.008]  I'll just talk to your public affairs spokesman.
[01:41:27.068 --> 01:41:28.329]  A woman comes out.
[01:41:29.549 --> 01:41:31.510]  Starts freaking out, asking why I'm there.
[01:41:32.431 --> 01:41:33.651]  Why I'm asking about the troops.
[01:41:34.092 --> 01:41:42.116]  Then a woman comes running from behind the counter in a Marine Corps shirt and starts screaming, Line them up and shoot them!
[01:41:43.076 --> 01:41:44.937]  It's time to start killing people!
[01:41:46.318 --> 01:41:47.719]  While you're seeing the takeover.
[01:41:48.299 --> 01:41:51.041]  And I'm standing there going, time to start killing people.
[01:41:51.721 --> 01:41:53.682]  And here I am, clean cut, standing there with a crew.
[01:41:54.864 --> 01:41:59.647]  And, uh, she's running around literally, literally freaking out.
[01:42:00.327 --> 01:42:01.348]  Let me try to do an imitation.
[01:42:01.368 --> 01:42:02.629]  I'll get the clip of that and play it.
[01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:05.891]  I'M SICK OF IT!
[01:42:06.771 --> 01:42:08.012]  WE'RE UNDER THREAT!
[01:42:08.492 --> 01:42:09.893]  WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
[01:42:10.313 --> 01:42:12.915]  THE TERRORISTS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE AND THE CRIMINALS!
[01:42:13.035 --> 01:42:15.036]  I SAY LINE THEM UP AND SHOOT THEM!
[01:42:15.436 --> 01:42:16.957]  IT'S TIME TO START KILLING!
[01:42:16.977 --> 01:42:19.419]  And I'm going, what?
[01:42:20.319 --> 01:42:23.401]  And then, you know, this spokeswoman, I think it's time for you to leave.
[01:42:24.116 --> 01:42:27.378]  I mean, I'm literally just in the midst of a frothing mental institution.
[01:42:27.978 --> 01:42:29.759]  Just a frothing mental institution.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.562]  And they've got a FEMA camp there and everything else.
[01:42:35.622 --> 01:42:36.603]  I'm just so sick of it.
[01:42:38.644 --> 01:42:40.765]  So, I mean, you talk about troops doing drills.
[01:42:41.005 --> 01:42:48.309]  They've got that little peninsula in Puerto Rico and they've dropped bombs on people's houses and everything else.
[01:42:49.209 --> 01:42:51.350]  And they've got so many areas to do this.
[01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:52.391]  Why do they do this?
[01:42:53.368 --> 01:42:54.929]  Why do they do this in populated areas?
[01:42:54.969 --> 01:42:55.910]  It's to condition you.
[01:42:55.930 --> 01:42:59.113]  We have the documents to accept this military takeover.
[01:43:00.875 --> 01:43:07.020]  And that's why when you go to New York or anywhere else and they got troops all over the streets and Homeland Security head shirt off.
[01:43:08.521 --> 01:43:13.385]  Before him, Ridge, you're on TV saying, here are the positive commentators, we're going to have to set aside the Constitution.
[01:43:13.786 --> 01:43:15.387]  We're a military form of government.
[01:43:17.909 --> 01:43:18.830]  All this is happening.
[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:19.811]  All this is going on.
[01:43:21.872 --> 01:43:24.233]  And so, I mean, do foreign troops attack U.S.
[01:43:24.253 --> 01:43:24.634]  cities?
[01:43:25.034 --> 01:43:25.594]  Yes, they do.
[01:43:25.634 --> 01:43:26.375]  I have police chiefs.
[01:43:26.475 --> 01:43:27.035]  I have video.
[01:43:28.155 --> 01:43:29.536]  And I have emergency managers.
[01:43:29.616 --> 01:43:31.457]  I have city managers.
[01:43:31.617 --> 01:43:32.538]  I have the news articles.
[01:43:34.659 --> 01:43:36.180]  And that's what black helicopters are.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.921]  That's where all the talk of that comes from.
[01:43:39.842 --> 01:43:51.188]  You know, I had one of these helicopter pilots, and most of them were fans, but I had one of them when I was at an academy buying family members some binoculars for Christmas.
[01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:54.584]  He just walked over and started shoving on me, putting his hands on me.
[01:43:56.506 --> 01:43:58.028]  And he was a pretty slick operator.
[01:43:59.369 --> 01:44:01.031]  I was also buying a knife as a gift.
[01:44:01.111 --> 01:44:03.513]  About 10 minutes later, I'm kind of ignoring him.
[01:44:03.914 --> 01:44:05.095]  I go, I'd like to see that knife.
[01:44:05.175 --> 01:44:05.915]  Oh, I'm getting out of here.
[01:44:05.936 --> 01:44:08.378]  You're not going to do something to me, are you?
[01:44:08.398 --> 01:44:11.000]  And I'm just like... The guy wanted me to get in a fight with him.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:15.445]  And I'm just like, man... I'm just at the counter buying some binoculars and a knife here.
[01:44:16.630 --> 01:44:17.991]  Listen, leave me alone.
[01:44:18.331 --> 01:44:25.076]  You know, like I said, go take your inoculations, go breathe your bloody uranium, make up just fine, okay?
[01:44:25.096 --> 01:44:25.956]  You don't know who your friends are.
[01:44:25.996 --> 01:44:26.537]  Leave me alone.
[01:44:28.618 --> 01:44:30.700]  He's like, I'm with the Night Stalkers.
[01:44:32.201 --> 01:44:33.101]  Well, good for you!
[01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:34.322]  You're with the Night Stalkers!
[01:44:35.583 --> 01:44:38.945]  You bring the people to the towns that shoot bullets into diners.
[01:44:39.966 --> 01:44:41.567]  And you make old ladies have heart attacks.
[01:44:42.461 --> 01:44:44.382]  Blowing up police stations next door to them.
[01:44:44.722 --> 01:44:50.343]  And your bosses try to bribe police chiefs in major metropolitan cities.
[01:44:50.423 --> 01:44:50.744]  Really?
[01:44:50.804 --> 01:44:51.464]  Good job!
[01:44:52.364 --> 01:44:52.684]  Good!
[01:44:52.744 --> 01:44:53.344]  Good for you!
[01:44:53.364 --> 01:44:57.646]  Oh, man.
[01:45:00.046 --> 01:45:01.907]  It's not that I'm not macho, folks.
[01:45:02.107 --> 01:45:03.527]  I mean, I'm smart enough to use my brain.
[01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:10.109]  I know when somebody starts blowing up to me and, you know, putting their hand on my shoulder and just lightly pushing me back,
[01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:16.011]  You know, I'm not gonna fall for it.
[01:45:17.593 --> 01:45:18.313]  I'm not stupid.
[01:45:18.914 --> 01:45:20.875]  That poor fool didn't know I was his friend.
[01:45:22.036 --> 01:45:23.097]  He has an identity.
[01:45:23.157 --> 01:45:23.917]  He's powerful.
[01:45:23.957 --> 01:45:24.518]  He's cool.
[01:45:24.558 --> 01:45:25.478]  He's part of the system.
[01:45:26.199 --> 01:45:26.759]  So good!
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:28.901]  Wait till they take your pension.
[01:45:29.662 --> 01:45:33.284]  Wait till, you know, your kids have got two heads from the shots you've taken.
[01:45:34.285 --> 01:45:36.166]  Uh, what, you know, triple the birth defects.
[01:45:36.787 --> 01:45:38.908]  Just wait till you get cancer in a few years.
[01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:41.150]  Uh, just, okay!
[01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:42.491]  Just leave me alone, man!
[01:45:42.631 --> 01:45:43.572]  I didn't, you know, fine!
[01:45:44.696 --> 01:45:45.878]  You don't know who your friends are.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:50.143]  And, uh, c'est la vie.
[01:45:52.266 --> 01:45:53.007]  So is life.
[01:45:53.707 --> 01:45:54.769]  There's looking at you, kid.
[01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:57.412]  You know, easy breaks.
[01:45:57.652 --> 01:45:58.253]  Go easy.
[01:45:59.134 --> 01:45:59.915]  Go with God.
[01:46:00.536 --> 01:46:00.956]  Whatever.
[01:46:01.597 --> 01:46:02.558]  I just feel sorry for you.
[01:46:02.578 --> 01:46:03.500]  It's like I'm talking to
[01:46:04.389 --> 01:46:14.514]  A demon-possessed hobgoblin or something, drooling, worshipping its master that'll, you know, spread it on a piece of bread like a piece of butter tomorrow.
[01:46:15.355 --> 01:46:17.416]  The New World Order could care less about you people.
[01:46:18.336 --> 01:46:19.477]  So you just keep serving them.
[01:46:19.497 --> 01:46:21.638]  You just keep doing whatever they say for you, okay?
[01:46:22.478 --> 01:46:23.639]  Just leave the borders wide open.
[01:46:23.659 --> 01:46:24.319]  Make sure you do that.
[01:46:24.339 --> 01:46:31.683]  Alright, let me get into what's happening with the Earth Changes and then I'll get to Ron and Fred and Ken and others.
[01:46:35.183 --> 01:46:36.644]  Oh, there is just so much here.
[01:46:36.664 --> 01:46:38.546]  I'm trying to dig through all of this.
[01:46:38.606 --> 01:46:42.989]  We've got, uh... Don't try to sell Girl Scout cookies in New York City.
[01:46:43.009 --> 01:46:43.930]  You've got to have a license.
[01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:45.371]  We'll ticket you or arrest you.
[01:46:46.331 --> 01:46:50.034]  Ohioans could be arrested for not telling police their name, AP.
[01:46:50.054 --> 01:46:57.960]  Of course, no for the minute anymore, but... It says, Ohioans could be detained or arrested for not telling police officers their name, address, and age under an anti-terrorism bill.
[01:46:59.421 --> 01:47:01.603]  Up for the Senate committee vote Wednesday.
[01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:09.074]  In addition, prosecutors and judges will be required to inform the federal government if a person convicted of a crime is also an illegal alien.
[01:47:09.334 --> 01:47:11.175]  They always add something like that to stop illegals.
[01:47:11.235 --> 01:47:12.135]  It always has loopholes.
[01:47:12.175 --> 01:47:12.755]  I looked at the law.
[01:47:12.795 --> 01:47:13.335]  It's not true.
[01:47:14.056 --> 01:47:15.036]  And listen to this.
[01:47:15.356 --> 01:47:22.179]  Villages, cities, and other municipalities would be banned from passing laws that hinder state and federal investigations into terrorism, i.e.
[01:47:22.239 --> 01:47:23.319]  throwing out the Patriot Act.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:24.820]  We'll get more into that.
[01:47:27.041 --> 01:47:31.663]  I want to get into some of these earth changes, though, here for just a few minutes.
[01:47:33.462 --> 01:47:36.444]  Large plume billows from Mount St.
[01:47:36.464 --> 01:47:36.944]  Helens.
[01:47:39.185 --> 01:47:39.766]  Mount St.
[01:47:39.826 --> 01:47:51.972]  Helens released a towering plume of ash Tuesday, its most significant emission in months, but one that seismologists did not believe heralded any major eruption.
[01:47:52.373 --> 01:47:58.176]  The volcano has vented ash and steam since last fall, when thousands of small earthquakes, and they had thousands this week,
[01:47:59.230 --> 01:48:03.792]  Marked the seismic reawakening of the 8,364 foot mountain.
[01:48:05.513 --> 01:48:12.417]  Late afternoon television footage showed the plume bellowing thousands of feet into the air, then drifting slowly to the northeast.
[01:48:14.125 --> 01:48:29.135]  The ash explosion happened at around 525 p.m., about an hour after a 2.0 magnitude quake rumbled off the east side of the mountain, said Bill Steele, coordinator of the Pacific Northwest Size, McGrath Network, University of Washington.
[01:48:30.316 --> 01:48:41.603]  But you see, the problem here is, all over the world, in modern recorded history, we have been seeing record volcanic and seismic events.
[01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:45.971]  Volcanoes that have been dormant in recorded history are reawakening.
[01:48:46.731 --> 01:48:51.893]  In areas that don't have a lot of volcanic or no volcanic activity in them, they're becoming reawakened.
[01:48:52.994 --> 01:48:55.494]  We've had actual giant mega-tectonic shifts.
[01:48:55.514 --> 01:49:04.637]  10.2, excuse me, 9.2 earthquakes, just mega-massive, that caused the tsunami.
[01:49:05.838 --> 01:49:10.580]  The Earth's rotation has actually sped up slightly, and gotten slightly smaller.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.640]  The planet's gotten smaller.
[01:49:12.228 --> 01:49:39.723]  The Sun, it directly correlates, has been ejecting mega, mega explosions, huge thermal nuclear reactions that have been changing our atmosphere and heating the Earth, and changing the core of the Earth, expanding the magma levels,
[01:49:42.131 --> 01:49:46.213]  In the mantle and the crust.
[01:49:47.694 --> 01:49:51.835]  We'll be right back and we'll continue to Fickles.
[01:49:53.436 --> 01:49:57.778]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.958 --> 01:50:02.420]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.922]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.962 --> 01:50:08.303]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.063 --> 01:50:09.984]  Panama.
[01:50:10.084 --> 01:50:14.327]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.367 --> 01:50:21.312]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.432 --> 01:50:23.434]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.814 --> 01:50:34.259]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.419 --> 01:50:39.822]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:56.459 --> 01:52:59.680]  Alright, again, your calls are coming up, but let me continue with the Earth changes.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.361]  This is on the London Independent.
[01:53:02.382 --> 01:53:04.823]  Could the supervolcano nightmare come true?
[01:53:06.083 --> 01:53:14.067]  Deep below Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming lies a slumbering giant that could bring the world to an end if it finally awakes.
[01:53:14.307 --> 01:53:15.188]  Fact or fiction?
[01:53:16.728 --> 01:53:19.290]  Science editor Steve Connor reports.
[01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:21.831]  And let me cover some of this story.
[01:53:25.836 --> 01:53:39.842]  When the supervolcano that lies beneath Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming finally awakes from its 640,000 year slumber, it will spew out enough ash and magma to change the world as we know it.
[01:53:40.462 --> 01:53:53.267]  This is the prediction of scientists who have calculated that the global risk posed by a supervolcanic eruption somewhere in the world is between 5 and 10 times greater than the probability of being struck by a giant asteroid.
[01:53:54.269 --> 01:54:10.217]  But it is a huge lake of molten magma lying dormant under the lush landscape of Yellowstone that is causing the greatest concern to volcanologists studying the special threat posed by supervolcanoes.
[01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:21.902]  Earth scientists commissioned by the Geological Society of London have calculated that there may be several super-eruptions big enough to cause a global disaster every 100,000 years.
[01:54:23.928 --> 01:54:37.777]  Whereas an asteroid larger than one kilometer, or 0.62 miles, six tenths of a mile in diameter, would be expected to hit Earth once in about every 600,000 years.
[01:54:38.517 --> 01:54:44.421]  Supervolcanoes may not look like much, but do not even have the traditional cone or
[01:54:45.855 --> 01:54:47.536]  shape of Vesuvius or Mount St.
[01:54:47.576 --> 01:54:54.038]  Helens, but their potential for destruction is many times greater than a traditional volcanic eruption.
[01:54:54.978 --> 01:55:01.240]  And I'll come back in the next hour and take calls and get back into this and cover another story here out of the Scotsman.
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:06.361]  Polar history shows melting ice cap may be natural cycle.
[01:55:07.022 --> 01:55:07.262]  U.S.
[01:55:07.302 --> 01:55:09.962]  Marine calls public story of Saddam capture fiction.
[01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:11.623]  United Press International
[01:55:12.442 --> 01:55:18.198]  And out of Discover Magazine, major dust storms go via the jet stream.
[01:55:19.671 --> 01:55:25.294]  Out of the Middle East are blowing masses of depleted uranium onto the American people.
[01:55:25.554 --> 01:55:28.095]  So, you can laugh at the Iraqis all day.
[01:55:28.115 --> 01:55:30.096]  You're going to get a small portion.
[01:55:30.136 --> 01:55:31.177]  I'm going to get a small portion.
[01:55:31.597 --> 01:55:42.322]  You reap what you sow of what has been rained down upon these poor people by the thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
[01:55:44.443 --> 01:55:47.385]  Before I end this hour, I do want to encourage every single solitary
[01:55:48.212 --> 01:55:50.134]  One of you out there, do not procrastinate.
[01:55:50.154 --> 01:55:53.236]  If you're online, go to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:53.636 --> 01:55:56.538]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day.

[01:56:01.942 --> 01:56:03.063]  I'm incredibly proud of it.
[01:56:03.103 --> 01:56:04.044]  It's my best work.
[01:56:04.964 --> 01:56:11.009]  And it's there on the site with all my other films, and my book, Paul Watson's book, and my weekly TV reports, and so much more.
[01:56:11.932 --> 01:56:13.973]  PrisonPlanet.TV.

[01:56:16.795 --> 01:56:22.379]  It covers the latest police state developments, the latest 9-11 info, so professionally done in JAMPAC.
[01:56:22.699 --> 01:56:31.464]  Then the ideology and mindset of the elite, how they're into this occult ideology, how they supported the Nazis, what they're doing with Schwarzenegger, the Bush-Nazi connection.
[01:56:32.525 --> 01:56:33.726]  Believe me, you just gotta see it.
[01:56:33.766 --> 01:56:34.346]  It's excellent.
[01:56:35.007 --> 01:56:38.369]  Two and a half plus hours, two hours, thirty-five minutes long.
[01:56:38.989 --> 01:56:39.990]  One triple eight.
[01:56:41.391 --> 01:56:49.713]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Triple 8 2-5-3 3-1-3-Niner Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 Don't believe the hype out there, folks.
[01:56:49.733 --> 01:56:52.494]  Other people that hype their material.
[01:56:52.534 --> 01:56:52.934]  This is it.
[01:56:52.954 --> 01:56:53.454]  This is the film.
[01:56:53.474 --> 01:56:54.574]  You've got to have this video.
[01:57:08.507 --> 01:57:09.008]  Believe me.
[01:57:09.128 --> 01:57:11.069]  I mean, it is so powerful.
[01:57:11.129 --> 01:57:11.910]  It's a must-have.
[01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:13.371]  Share it with the world.
[01:57:13.411 --> 01:57:22.079]  It is my hope and dream and aspiration and my prayers that people will see this and it's up to you to get it and make copies of it and get it out to people.
[01:57:22.319 --> 01:57:23.340]  So please take action.

[01:57:33.761 --> 01:57:34.942]  Alright, third hour.
[01:57:35.583 --> 01:57:36.224]  Straight ahead.
[01:57:36.264 --> 01:57:38.446]  Your call's a plethora of vital news.
[01:57:38.646 --> 01:57:39.327]  Keep it locked in.
[01:57:39.347 --> 01:57:41.069]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.905 --> 01:57:51.986]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.686 --> 01:57:53.766]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.447 --> 01:57:55.267]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.027 --> 01:57:57.928]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.948 --> 01:58:01.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:05.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.532 --> 01:58:10.154]  Could the supervolcano nightmare come true?
[01:58:10.214 --> 01:58:11.634]  London Independent, that's coming up.
[01:58:12.114 --> 01:58:14.936]  Polar History shows melting ice caps may be a natural cycle.
[01:58:15.416 --> 01:58:15.636]  U.S.
[01:58:15.676 --> 01:58:17.917]  Marine calls public story of Saddam capture fiction.
[01:58:18.852 --> 01:58:28.481]  It's all coming up, plus the jet stream carrying depleted uranium to our country's shore so we can breathe what we've put on others.
[01:58:29.782 --> 01:58:30.423]  It's a nightmare.
[01:58:31.129 --> 01:58:33.130]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:34.410]  Ron in New York.
[01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:35.370]  You're on the air, Ron.
[01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:40.152]  Alex, there's something that must be brought to the public's attention and your listeners' attention right away.
[01:58:40.212 --> 01:58:46.234]  There was a hearing before a House Congressional Subcommittee yesterday in which the Director of the FBI testified.
[01:58:46.754 --> 01:58:53.196]  And it got into some interesting facts that you and I have discussed in the past, only now it's been confirmed straight from the horse's mouth.
[01:58:54.312 --> 01:59:06.847]  with regards to the terrorist watch lists and regards to purchases of firearms they now want to uh... they in fact admitted something which i found shocking because in fact it's probably contrary to the way the law is constructed
[01:59:07.856 --> 01:59:12.961]  They now check a terrorist watch list when a person goes to buy a firearm.
[01:59:13.381 --> 01:59:26.134]  Now one should understand, or your audience should understand that, if a person is in fact not convicted of certain categories of offenses, which is only correct in a constitutional democracy, they cannot be deprived their basic right.
[01:59:26.594 --> 01:59:36.384]  They now admit that they have a terrorist watch list, which is an unaccountable... Yeah, it's a new area of unconvicted terrorists, criminals, who can't own guns.
[01:59:36.404 --> 01:59:46.774]  They're also going to add just people who are, quote, on criminal watch lists, who aren't criminals, and then you go sign the paperwork and say, yeah, I'm able to buy a gun, but they put you on the list like 350,000 Americans.
[01:59:48.837 --> 01:59:56.084]  It's probably more than 350,000 because they're getting the data from the Choice Point Corporation, Data Provider Corporation.
[01:59:56.104 --> 01:59:59.828]  They banned any black person with the last name of Brown from voting in Florida.
[02:00:00.268 --> 02:00:02.070]  Alex, please permit me to finish.
[02:00:02.090 --> 02:00:03.391]  It goes further than that.
[02:00:03.972 --> 02:00:10.479]  Anyone whose politics, like an Alex Jones, don't square well with this power structure can wind up on that list.
[02:00:11.059 --> 02:00:14.944]  As we know, members of the United States Congress have wound up in that category.
[02:00:14.984 --> 02:00:21.230]  We know that the Libertarian Party candidate for President of the United States has wound up on lists like that.
[02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:24.454]  Those same lists provided by that same corporation, Joyce.
[02:00:24.534 --> 02:00:29.780]  The only answer is suing those people, and they are getting in trouble, and they are getting caught doing it.
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:37.687]  But the problem with that is everybody who is probably on that list doesn't have the resources, and that's not the way democracy and constitutional rights should work.
[02:00:38.087 --> 02:00:42.371]  We now have, and we have both a prominent member... This is totally criminal, yes.
[02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:48.096]  A prominent member, Republican member of that committee, and a Democrat member in agreement with FBI Director Mueller.
[02:00:48.717 --> 02:00:50.539]  You're telling me they actually said that?
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:04.040]  Yes.
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:10.763]  I'm telling you that they said the law has to be changed, and you had a Republican and a Democrat member, and Mr. Mueller agreeing with that.
[02:01:10.903 --> 02:01:11.503]  Who were they?
[02:01:12.083 --> 02:01:12.304]  They?
[02:01:12.324 --> 02:01:13.244]  Uh, yes.
[02:01:13.404 --> 02:01:14.004]  I have the names.
[02:01:14.124 --> 02:01:18.686]  Frank Wolf, who is Chairman of the Finance Subcommittee, Justice Finance Subcommittee.
[02:01:19.146 --> 02:01:19.507]  Okay?
[02:01:19.827 --> 02:01:22.828]  Chaka Fattah, Mr. Wolf is a Republican from Virginia.
[02:01:23.528 --> 02:01:27.730]  Chaka Fattah, who's a prominent Democrat and member of the committee from Pennsylvania.
[02:01:28.946 --> 02:01:30.408]  And so here are the Republicans.
[02:01:30.448 --> 02:01:38.180]  Well, Larry Pratt warned us of this new national ID card law that has gun control in it of this exact thing.
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:41.865]  And of course the Republicans will go, good, take my guns, this is conservative.
[02:01:42.717 --> 02:01:45.418]  They're now talking, Alex, that list.
[02:01:45.818 --> 02:01:47.738]  First off, there's a lot of questions raised here.
[02:01:48.358 --> 02:01:51.799]  That list consists of people that are merely suspected.
[02:01:52.219 --> 02:01:53.499]  They're not convicted of anything.
[02:01:53.539 --> 02:01:56.100]  There's no further aggravating factor than mere suspicion.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.580]  They now want to elevate mere suspicion.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.741]  Imagine if Bill Clinton tried this.
[02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:01.801]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:01.841 --> 02:02:03.021]  Everybody would be up in arms.
[02:02:03.461 --> 02:02:08.182]  They now want to use mere suspicion as a basis to deprive an American citizen of their fundamental right.
[02:02:08.702 --> 02:02:13.627]  Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do, Ron, because you've called in over the years always with good documented info.
[02:02:14.147 --> 02:02:16.950]  Write me a one-page article.
[02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:18.291]  Okay.
[02:02:18.371 --> 02:02:20.053]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:20.233 --> 02:02:22.775]  I don't have a computer, but... Well, you need to go to the library, then.
[02:02:22.976 --> 02:02:23.236]  Okay.
[02:02:24.502 --> 02:02:25.143]  We need your help.
[02:02:25.263 --> 02:02:26.743]  I can't do it all.
[02:02:26.763 --> 02:02:29.745]  Write an article about this, email it to me, and millions will read it.
[02:02:30.265 --> 02:02:32.846]  Okay, I'm going to do that, and I'm going to alert people to this.
[02:02:33.086 --> 02:02:36.728]  And I'd appreciate it if you'd hold me over, because I had a few more things I wanted to say in reference to this.
[02:02:36.748 --> 02:02:39.949]  Well, quickly, because we've got a lot of calls and a lot of news, but this is important.
[02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:42.671]  I've known some elements of this.
[02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:43.051]  We'll be back.
[02:02:46.067 --> 02:02:53.457]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.737 --> 02:02:58.483]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.703 --> 02:03:04.351]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.571 --> 02:03:09.117]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.338 --> 02:03:16.487]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.527 --> 02:03:19.872]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:03:20.112 --> 02:03:20.973]  And much, much more.
[02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:23.695]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:03:23.936 --> 02:03:30.701]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:30.902 --> 02:03:36.146]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.166 --> 02:03:36.587]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:46.303 --> 02:03:50.785]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.145 --> 02:03:55.226]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.526 --> 02:03:56.086]  We listened.
[02:03:56.386 --> 02:04:01.388]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.648 --> 02:04:02.128]  We listened.
[02:04:02.508 --> 02:04:05.550]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:06.510]  We listened.
[02:04:06.970 --> 02:04:09.991]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:04:09.991 --> 02:04:10.652]  We're good to go.
[02:04:34.113 --> 02:04:34.153]  8803-4438.
[02:04:34.193 --> 02:04:34.893]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.913 --> 02:04:35.794]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.111 --> 02:04:48.233]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[02:04:48.534 --> 02:04:50.835]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:04:51.056 --> 02:04:58.201]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:04:58.381 --> 02:05:03.765]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:05:04.005 --> 02:05:08.649]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[02:05:08.889 --> 02:05:11.432]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:05:11.633 --> 02:05:12.774]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:05:12.994 --> 02:05:22.566]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.
[02:05:22.826 --> 02:05:27.172]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:05:27.472 --> 02:05:32.316]  Reclaim that youthful and energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help from Minerals from the Sea.

[02:05:44.927 --> 02:05:49.952]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:49.972 --> 02:05:52.614]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:03.081 --> 02:06:03.801]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:06:03.821 --> 02:06:05.102]  We're going to continue with your calls.
[02:06:05.122 --> 02:06:06.182]  Do we have Debbie Morrow yet?
[02:06:06.202 --> 02:06:08.183]  Excellent.
[02:06:08.203 --> 02:06:09.263]  We're going to go to her in just a second.
[02:06:09.283 --> 02:06:10.684]  I wanted Ron to be able to finish up.
[02:06:11.544 --> 02:06:12.945]  In New York, Ron called in.
[02:06:13.005 --> 02:06:15.106]  Ron's been calling for years, always with good information.
[02:06:15.686 --> 02:06:17.687]  I was aware that through the NICS system,
[02:06:18.587 --> 02:06:41.736]  You've all heard of the airline no-fly list, and I saw Governor Ridge, the former head of Homeland Security, about almost three years ago, before he got funding, on C-SPAN for two hours, meeting with corporate CEOs, and they said, you'll have a national ID card, you'll have to have this to have a job, bad credit, can't have a job, you'll have to go sign on with the government to work your payments off, so it'll be like debtor prison, without the walls.
[02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:49.353]  And they said that just any suspicion of anything, again, bad credit, just everything will be put in there.
[02:06:49.373 --> 02:06:53.575]  You'll have a green, a yellow, an orange, or a red rating.
[02:06:55.376 --> 02:07:00.318]  And of course your IDs will have an RFID chip in them, they'll be red everywhere you go.
[02:07:01.018 --> 02:07:02.779]  They just passed that standardization.
[02:07:03.779 --> 02:07:05.080]  And there's over 350,000 people on the no-fly list.
[02:07:08.121 --> 02:07:10.262]  And it's people with names like Johnson Jones.
[02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:17.446]  If there's somebody else, you know, who has a similar name to you, you just can't fly, then it turned out they were doing it to be politically mean.
[02:07:17.866 --> 02:07:23.288]  The Green Party and Libertarian Party people and anti-war activists, people with no criminal records.
[02:07:23.728 --> 02:07:26.570]  What is it, five members of Congress now that can't fly?
[02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:28.071]  And they just stay on the list.
[02:07:28.091 --> 02:07:30.792]  They complain, they fight, they miss their flights.
[02:07:30.952 --> 02:07:33.833]  Sometimes they're allowed to fly, but they're always on the list.
[02:07:33.933 --> 02:07:37.135]  And yeah, Larry Pratt had talked about these new laws.
[02:07:38.826 --> 02:07:42.729]  If there was any suspicion or even bad credit, we won't be able to buy a gun.
[02:07:42.749 --> 02:07:57.440]  And we know before Clinton left office, hundreds of thousands of veterans who had any type of, you know, heat collapse, anything in Vietnam, whatever, they had already put in their file that they had post-traumatic stress, so now you can't buy your grandson a .22 rifle.
[02:07:57.961 --> 02:07:59.702]  And the NRA and others won't talk about this.
[02:07:59.722 --> 02:08:01.784]  I mean, they won't tell you Bush is doing all this gun control.
[02:08:02.324 --> 02:08:05.306]  They'll tell you Gonzales is good when he says he wants more gun control.
[02:08:05.647 --> 02:08:07.508]  The new Attorney General, or Michael Chertoff.
[02:08:08.089 --> 02:08:10.930]  They'll support their nomination and confirmation because they're anti-gun.
[02:08:11.211 --> 02:08:15.292]  Same thing with Schwarzenegger, who the NRA supported, who was openly for banning guns.
[02:08:16.913 --> 02:08:23.797]  And Ron in New York said he was watching... I know Mueller was before yesterday.
[02:08:24.237 --> 02:08:27.879]  I did read that he was, quote, calling for keeping terrorists from getting guns.
[02:08:28.219 --> 02:08:29.399]  That's how the media spends it.
[02:08:29.779 --> 02:08:32.061]  But Ron said he actually watched it on C-SPAN.
[02:08:32.401 --> 02:08:34.942]  Tell us just a little bit more about that, then I've got to move on, Ron.
[02:08:35.638 --> 02:08:43.203]  Yes, the question came up from two members of the committee, to Mr. Mueller, regarding the terrorist watch list, that they're terrorists who purchased guns.
[02:08:43.763 --> 02:08:50.207]  There were 44 people who were on the terrorist watch list, of which 34 were permitted to purchase guns.
[02:08:50.708 --> 02:08:53.890]  So the members of the committee, of course, feigned, you know, indignation at this.
[02:08:53.970 --> 02:08:54.770]  How could this be?
[02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:57.032]  But you see, I analyze it more deeply.
[02:08:57.452 --> 02:09:02.055]  If you have 34 people who are such good citizens that they've never violated a law,
[02:09:02.655 --> 02:09:18.567]  Then, that's the most law-abiding terrorist I've ever seen, thus leading me to the suspicion that there are people on that list who are no more of a terrorist than you, or I, or... Well, sir, you've got to type Patriot.compliance into a search engine, hundreds of thousands of links.
[02:09:19.408 --> 02:09:23.691]  There was an article a few months ago where major check-cashing places are stopping to cash checks.
[02:09:23.731 --> 02:09:24.412]  They've shut down.
[02:09:25.092 --> 02:09:32.355]  Because under the law now, they've got to make sure anybody they're cashing a check for doesn't, isn't on a quote, criminal watch list.
[02:09:32.375 --> 02:09:36.777]  They have all these, and it isn't for somebody who's even wanted, or someone who's even convicted.
[02:09:37.237 --> 02:09:39.838]  It's that you've got to verify they're not quote, on the list.
[02:09:40.338 --> 02:09:41.899]  Well, consider that they're co-mingling.
[02:09:41.939 --> 02:09:43.800]  By the way, they're co-mingling these databases.
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:49.142]  So-called criminal and terrorist databases are being co-mingled and consolidated now, and coming to mean one.
[02:09:49.342 --> 02:09:53.724]  Well, they admit that, I mean, who out there has gotten something on your credit report that's somebody else?
[02:09:55.104 --> 02:09:58.385]  They now are going forward, as we speak, Frank Lautenberg, U.S.
[02:09:58.405 --> 02:10:13.990]  Senator from New Jersey, is now, as we speak, penning legislation to make it a matter of law that someone on this list, and you could wind up on this list due to nothing more than mere suspicion, or erroneous, or accidental, or sloppy information.
[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:14.890]  Well, they do it on purpose.
[02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:16.071]  Of course they do.
[02:10:16.211 --> 02:10:19.532]  When they did it to presidential candidates and certain members of Congress, we aren't that naive.
[02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:23.393]  Or you could just wind up there, as you said, quite accidentally, because you have a common name like Jones.
[02:10:24.295 --> 02:10:36.161]  And you, as a matter of fact and law now, will be deprived of the right, your most fundamental constitutional right, to purchase a firearm, based on a J. Edgar Hoover type file, in an electronic format.
[02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:38.202]  And they want to codify this into law.
[02:10:39.221 --> 02:10:47.125]  And you have both parties in agreement, because you have the Republican and the Democrat on that panel in agreement on this, and the Director of the FBI saying, yeah, maybe we need to do this.
[02:10:47.685 --> 02:10:50.306]  And as a matter of fact, the issue has been reported.
[02:10:50.727 --> 02:10:56.890]  It is in the editorial page of today's New York Times, in which the Times just thinks it's a great idea, of course, and they want to go ahead.
[02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:57.850]  This is what they're trying to do.
[02:10:57.930 --> 02:11:01.872]  And the question becomes, who is this choice point corporation?
[02:11:02.332 --> 02:11:05.334]  Who is this corporation that operates in the dark?
[02:11:05.994 --> 02:11:11.916]  Alright, and makes decisions to directly impact the lives and the constitutional and civil rights of American citizens.
[02:11:11.936 --> 02:11:16.217]  Well, it's been in the mainstream news all their connections to organized crime.
[02:11:16.717 --> 02:11:26.519]  We need to bring these people out into the light of day for public scrutiny and we need to investigate the relationship of this corporation to this government.
[02:11:26.819 --> 02:11:29.760]  The corporation is almost nearly unaccountable.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:30.600]  Here's the point.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:31.601]  I gotta let you go, Ron.
[02:11:31.621 --> 02:11:32.781]  I'll let you go for about 10 minutes.
[02:11:34.082 --> 02:11:35.723]  I'm going to let you go now.
[02:11:35.763 --> 02:11:36.084]  Thank you.
[02:11:36.384 --> 02:11:37.044]  Really good points.
[02:11:38.105 --> 02:11:39.026]  Just send me that article.
[02:11:40.007 --> 02:11:40.767]  We'll get it posted.
[02:11:40.787 --> 02:11:42.149]  We need to write some comments on this.
[02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:44.190]  I am aware that they're trying to do this.
[02:11:45.391 --> 02:11:47.353]  And this is what Republicans want, folks.
[02:11:48.033 --> 02:11:55.960]  They want to feel good about Bush and feel good about Schwarzenegger and feel good about Governor Pataki and feel good about the NRA and lose everything we've got.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.481]  And so we're going to lose it.
[02:11:57.922 --> 02:11:58.822]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:12:02.054 --> 02:12:04.736]  I mean, I watched Republicans cry and worship Schwarzenegger.
[02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:05.717]  I watched it.
[02:12:07.298 --> 02:12:15.605]  They don't care if he's pro-abortion, pro-open border, wants to ban guns outright, has been banning whole classes of guns in California, banning whole classes of ammo.
[02:12:16.045 --> 02:12:16.465]  They love it!
[02:12:17.586 --> 02:12:21.369]  They don't care if the NRA argues in federal court for registration of all guns.
[02:12:21.409 --> 02:12:22.410]  They don't know it's taken over.
[02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.930]  They don't care.
[02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:23.711]  You tell them they love it!
[02:12:24.750 --> 02:12:27.032]  They love it that Bush wants to sign the Assault of Japan.
[02:12:27.392 --> 02:12:31.195]  They love it that Alberto Gonzales is vehemently anti-gun.
[02:12:31.556 --> 02:12:33.297]  Folks, they don't like the Second Amendment.
[02:12:34.198 --> 02:12:36.179]  These Republicans are liberals and didn't know it.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.402]  And the Democrats have said they're going to get our guns and they're happy.
[02:12:39.922 --> 02:12:43.025]  They're all for the war, they're all for the lies, they're all for the Patriot Act.
[02:12:43.966 --> 02:12:47.769]  And the Democrats who listen to this show, who think the Democrats are going to save us, what are you talking about?
[02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:50.531]  They're all part and parcel.
[02:12:52.322 --> 02:12:55.584]  And so, you didn't see the NRA challenge Gonzalez, did you?
[02:12:55.644 --> 02:12:57.005]  Nope, they didn't challenge Chertoff.
[02:12:57.085 --> 02:12:57.565]  Nope, they didn't.
[02:12:59.046 --> 02:13:06.890]  And I listen to the neocons every day, driving in my car, and they say Bush is fighting for the Second Amendment, and fighting to control the borders, and it's all lies, but hey, so what?
[02:13:07.911 --> 02:13:18.816]  You know, if we all live inside our heads, and believe that whatever false reality we believe is reality, then, you know, I guess turn your guns in, and that's pro-gun.
[02:13:18.856 --> 02:13:19.757]  You know, I don't know.
[02:13:21.105 --> 02:13:22.886]  But no, it's all happening.
[02:13:22.946 --> 02:13:29.570]  It's like the Republicans all putting in giant toll roads everywhere that track and trace us.
[02:13:30.110 --> 02:13:31.431]  It's all happening.
[02:13:32.011 --> 02:13:33.012]  What are you going to do?
[02:13:33.052 --> 02:13:36.114]  For the next four or five minutes before we go to break, then we'll come back and take more of your calls.
[02:13:36.434 --> 02:13:37.094]  Debbie Morrow.
[02:13:37.114 --> 02:13:38.015]  Debbie, thanks for holding.
[02:13:38.075 --> 02:13:40.016]  Great to have you on.
[02:13:40.196 --> 02:13:43.378]  You're kind of a fellow extremist.
[02:13:43.658 --> 02:13:46.420]  A made-in-America product.
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.902]  Highest quality water purification that I use.
[02:13:50.803 --> 02:13:54.004]  I think we shouldn't not trust the government.
[02:13:54.024 --> 02:13:58.325]  We should not buy these filters and we should just trust them and drink the water, Debbie.
[02:13:59.546 --> 02:14:00.486]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:01.887]  You do that, Alex.
[02:14:02.027 --> 02:14:03.527]  I think I'll Berkey my water.
[02:14:04.007 --> 02:14:06.408]  And I think everybody out there ought to Berkey their water.
[02:14:06.428 --> 02:14:18.852]  I've had lots of testimonies from people calling in who are so happy with their Berkey water filters and really want to encourage people to give us a call
[02:14:19.898 --> 02:14:20.798]  Get them ordered.
[02:14:21.079 --> 02:14:31.544]  For those who aren't familiar with Berkeley Water Filters, they're a gravity water filter and they require no power to filter the water.
[02:14:31.604 --> 02:14:36.426]  They don't require any plumbing or anything like that.
[02:14:36.446 --> 02:14:42.289]  And they make fantastic water for you and for your home.
[02:14:42.850 --> 02:14:45.891]  We recommend that you use them on a daily basis.
[02:14:46.631 --> 02:14:51.992]  And that way, if an emergency should happen, you already have it working, you already have it going.
[02:14:52.493 --> 02:15:00.555]  But it's also important to drink good, healthy water now to take responsibility for your body and, you know, what you're putting into it.
[02:15:00.715 --> 02:15:05.416]  So, really want to encourage people to give us a call and order Berkey Water Filters.
[02:15:05.496 --> 02:15:09.137]  And to remember that it does support your short-wave airtime.
[02:15:09.827 --> 02:15:14.328]  Well, Debbie, there's already so many toxins in the air and in the food.
[02:15:15.089 --> 02:15:17.769]  Seventy percent of the toxins we pick up, though, are out of water.
[02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:22.051]  And this is a great way to reduce those.
[02:15:22.931 --> 02:15:35.815]  And so many major prestigious university medical center studies show that all of this chronic fatigue and the rest of it is connected directly to the toxins that we pick up in our daily lives.
[02:15:36.463 --> 02:15:38.144]  This is such an important thing to do.
[02:15:38.164 --> 02:15:41.106]  I mean, if you have children, folks, what is wrong with you?
[02:15:41.146 --> 02:15:44.167]  Put filters on the shower, on the bathtub.
[02:15:44.267 --> 02:15:44.928]  I've done this.
[02:15:45.648 --> 02:15:46.769]  Drink filtered water.
[02:15:46.889 --> 02:15:48.070]  Cook with filtered water.
[02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:50.771]  Look, I demand you do this.
[02:15:50.871 --> 02:15:52.172]  I don't sell magic creams.
[02:15:52.212 --> 02:15:53.933]  I don't sell magic machines that heal you.
[02:15:54.313 --> 02:15:55.334]  I don't believe in that stuff.
[02:15:56.094 --> 02:15:56.935]  This is real.
[02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:58.255]  It's made in America.
[02:15:58.335 --> 02:15:59.676]  It's the highest quality.
[02:16:00.036 --> 02:16:02.858]  It costs the same amount as a Chinese or Indian knockoff.
[02:16:03.658 --> 02:16:04.980]  That are just pieces of garbage.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:06.942]  So, give Debbie a call.
[02:16:06.962 --> 02:16:08.204]  We've got a bunch of other great products.
[02:16:08.224 --> 02:16:08.924]  Just give her a call.
[02:16:08.944 --> 02:16:09.565]  The phone's busy.
[02:16:09.946 --> 02:16:10.687]  Leave your name and number.
[02:16:10.707 --> 02:16:11.628]  She'll call you right back.
[02:16:11.648 --> 02:16:11.708]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:16:17.819 --> 02:16:19.540]  I mean, I feel real good guilting people.
[02:16:20.001 --> 02:16:27.286]  Having a real product like this supports what we're doing, but first and foremost, you know, stop feeding your kids the sodium fluoride and all this garbage.
[02:16:27.786 --> 02:16:29.227]  The pesticides, the herbicides.
[02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:31.529]  Give Debbie a call right now!
[02:16:31.549 --> 02:16:31.609]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:38.657]  888-803-4438.
[02:16:39.177 --> 02:16:43.801]  They've got sports bottles, they've got filters for the showers.
[02:16:43.922 --> 02:16:46.884]  Get it all!
[02:16:46.904 --> 02:16:50.688]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:16:50.708 --> 02:16:53.090]  And in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:55.512]  You get the full discounts and what free gifts you want.
[02:16:55.532 --> 02:16:56.353]  There's a list on the site.
[02:16:56.653 --> 02:17:02.758]  Berkeywater.com or link through at InfoWars.com via the banner or 888-803-4438.
[02:17:03.158 --> 02:17:06.021]  Debbie, I appreciate the fine work you're doing and the incredible service.
[02:17:06.421 --> 02:17:10.484]  I get nothing but rave reviews from the people that purchase from the New Millennium.
[02:17:10.824 --> 02:17:11.785]  And God bless you, my dear.
[02:17:12.045 --> 02:17:12.806]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:17:12.906 --> 02:17:13.787]  Have a great day.
[02:17:14.047 --> 02:17:14.367]  You bet.
[02:17:14.948 --> 02:17:15.388]  Take care.
[02:17:15.628 --> 02:17:19.151]  Give Debbie Morrow a call right now and the great folks at Jim Shepard.
[02:17:19.171 --> 02:17:19.671]  888-803-4438.
[02:17:19.751 --> 02:17:21.273]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:17:25.094 --> 02:17:27.355]  I don't have any magic pills or anything for you.
[02:17:28.296 --> 02:17:30.757]  I don't have anything that's, you know, magically going to heal you.
[02:17:31.557 --> 02:17:39.281]  Just purify your waters, put civilization's kind of built on, and one of the pillars of it, and you might want to not trust the government.
[02:17:39.781 --> 02:17:40.722]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.575 --> 02:17:47.917]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:48.177 --> 02:17:52.021]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:17:52.341 --> 02:17:53.162]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.602 --> 02:17:57.726]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:57.946 --> 02:18:02.149]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:07.374]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:07.754 --> 02:18:11.336]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:16.859]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:17.139 --> 02:18:19.860]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:20.181 --> 02:18:21.061]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:18:21.381 --> 02:18:32.107]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.970]  The real money folks.
[02:18:53.482 --> 02:18:55.402]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:55.903 --> 02:18:56.883]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:56.963 --> 02:18:58.343]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:58.383 --> 02:18:58.823]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:59.403 --> 02:19:01.844]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[02:19:01.864 --> 02:19:05.045]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:19:14.733 --> 02:19:17.074]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:19:17.094 --> 02:19:20.374]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:20.975 --> 02:19:24.015]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:20:44.618 --> 02:20:49.462]  This is Jeff Diamond, and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[02:20:49.562 --> 02:20:52.704]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[02:20:52.724 --> 02:20:57.408]  Her name was Joni, and she'd already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days, and she was so excited.
[02:20:57.508 --> 02:21:01.211]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[02:21:01.391 --> 02:21:06.116]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[02:21:06.176 --> 02:21:07.978]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[02:21:07.998 --> 02:21:10.941]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[02:21:11.001 --> 02:21:17.868]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry.
[02:21:17.908 --> 02:21:19.770]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:20.771]  It's a great product.
[02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:23.613]  You're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[02:21:23.693 --> 02:21:26.835]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[02:21:26.855 --> 02:21:28.255]  You don't pay anything up front.
[02:21:28.295 --> 02:21:33.298]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[02:21:33.318 --> 02:21:33.719]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:33.739 --> 02:21:33.839]  1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:33.859 --> 02:21:35.280]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[02:21:45.487 --> 02:21:47.687]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:48.248 --> 02:21:51.108]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:02.810]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:22:03.570 --> 02:22:05.231]  Fred in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:22:05.291 --> 02:22:05.651]  Welcome.
[02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:08.251]  Hi Alex.
[02:22:08.671 --> 02:22:11.792]  I just wanted to first bring up the trend of
[02:22:12.941 --> 02:22:14.222]  Let me break down the facts.
[02:22:14.242 --> 02:22:16.903]  Let's just cut right to their lives.
[02:22:17.023 --> 02:22:20.245]  Everyone born in a hospital in the last 32 years
[02:22:40.996 --> 02:22:42.537]  Has had blood ampoules taken.
[02:22:42.657 --> 02:22:44.478]  One does go to the health department for blood tests.
[02:22:44.518 --> 02:22:46.720]  The other goes into a federal database.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:48.481]  I've had congressmen on to talk about it.
[02:22:48.881 --> 02:22:51.202]  So first they set the DNA database up.
[02:22:52.303 --> 02:22:55.165]  Then they announce how they need it and how they want it.
[02:22:55.485 --> 02:22:57.206]  That's how these criminals operate.
[02:22:57.346 --> 02:22:59.988]  Yes, the verb need and the verb want.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:07.605]  And it somehow gets morphed into, uh, uh, have to, uh, whatever that means.
[02:23:07.665 --> 02:23:08.465]  And I don't buy it.
[02:23:08.525 --> 02:23:21.194]  I don't buy the premise of needing it or that... I think Ron Paul should offer legislation that would ban that development.
[02:23:21.434 --> 02:23:24.396]  We can't play defense any longer on something like that.
[02:23:24.416 --> 02:23:25.417]  Listen, the DNA is not 100%.
[02:23:29.597 --> 02:23:31.459]  Because they can frame you with it.
[02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:34.741]  Because the crime labs are so corrupt.
[02:23:35.102 --> 02:23:35.342]  Yeah.
[02:23:35.442 --> 02:23:37.584]  Look at all the articles where they've been caught cheating people.
[02:23:37.684 --> 02:23:39.285]  Yes, there are lots of articles on that.
[02:23:39.906 --> 02:23:43.328]  Now, the other thing that I wanted to mention was current events.
[02:23:43.388 --> 02:23:51.215]  The Italian journalist and the... He had four people in that car moving from the airport.
[02:23:51.235 --> 02:23:54.678]  You know, moving along a road.
[02:23:55.338 --> 02:23:57.941]  And I had found out, I think it was either...
[02:24:00.232 --> 02:24:06.797]  It was one of the major radio news services, CBC, Canadian, or was one of the other ones.
[02:24:07.418 --> 02:24:25.752]  It said that Prime Minister Bo Sconey himself, in person, was actually talking on cell phones to the occupants of that vehicle, and he was cut off not long after that vehicle started moving away from the airport.
[02:24:26.898 --> 02:24:35.849]  He was very angry about the situation as it happened and I'm thinking maybe that's the reason why he was and is very angry.
[02:24:37.658 --> 02:24:57.274]  Well, he's a total fascist, but the people of Italy are mad, so he's having to go along and act like he's mad, but look... But what I'm saying is that the call, the communication with Berlusconi, to have him, if that's verified, that that was happening,
[02:24:57.754 --> 02:24:58.715]  And it was cut off.
[02:24:59.576 --> 02:25:05.320]  Uh, we know that the, the, um... No, they admit that they shut off... It's coalition controlled.
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:07.242]  The cell phone is coalition controlled.
[02:25:07.862 --> 02:25:11.646]  Well, no, they admit that during the elections, the staged elections, they shut all the cell phones off.
[02:25:11.906 --> 02:25:12.586]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:12.626 --> 02:25:12.827]  Thanks.
[02:25:13.227 --> 02:25:18.811]  And, I mean, obviously the phone line to the Italian Prime Minister is being listened to by the NSA 24-7.
[02:25:20.092 --> 02:25:23.996]  But, um, they had a Fox News pundit yesterday.
[02:25:24.036 --> 02:25:25.197]  This was on prisonplanet.com.
[02:25:26.405 --> 02:25:28.549]  Come out and say, you know, too bad she got released.
[02:25:28.569 --> 02:25:29.471]  Too bad they didn't get her.
[02:25:30.273 --> 02:25:31.996]  You know, it's like an open joke now.
[02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:35.343]  Well, she wasn't patriotic, so... Wink, wink.
[02:25:36.552 --> 02:25:39.014]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:39.054 --> 02:25:39.795]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:25:39.935 --> 02:25:40.635]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[02:25:40.695 --> 02:25:47.500]  I called in on that, your David Gergen clip, which is even more damning to both his and the Bohemian Gros' position than you really analyzed.
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:49.242]  And I wouldn't have guessed before having heard it.
[02:25:49.342 --> 02:25:51.403]  Actually, I don't know why you don't play that more often.
[02:25:51.443 --> 02:25:54.626]  And also, I turned off on Popular Mechanics with George Inouye.
[02:25:55.206 --> 02:25:57.448]  And it's been passing quickly last night on Coast.
[02:25:58.445 --> 02:26:26.347]  George Norrie had Andre from Florida, I keep forgetting his last name, the superb black talk show host on the topic of the Federal Reserve, and so there I was, I should be ashamed, but glued bleary-eyed for the whole three hours, and I don't know how George does it, even though it's safely tucked away under the wee hours, or mixed in with a fruitcake spirituality and flying saucers, but to which I'd only add that both Andre and Norrie reinforced the number of the same points for us more articulately than the same points
[02:26:27.023 --> 02:26:32.246]  Which Art Bell and Chertoff had just a couple days before tried less persuasively to debunk.
[02:26:32.826 --> 02:26:33.806]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:26:34.067 --> 02:26:36.508]  I was up late last night working and driving home.
[02:26:36.548 --> 02:26:41.350]  I listened to the first 30 minutes of Norrie before his Federal Reserve guest came on.
[02:26:42.451 --> 02:26:46.613]  And he had a former FDIC official on.
[02:26:47.273 --> 02:26:51.215]  And he said, we got a guest come up about the private banking cartel that controls America.
[02:26:51.295 --> 02:26:52.016]  Is it not private?
[02:26:52.536 --> 02:26:54.857]  And his first guest goes, well, yes, George, it is private.
[02:26:55.663 --> 02:26:58.465]  So, I mean, but still, you got these yuppies that want to deny that.
[02:26:59.005 --> 02:27:05.248]  Yeah, so there was some overlap last night with the issues of 9-1-1 and the engineering disaster for power grabbing.
[02:27:05.648 --> 02:27:22.618]  And on that Gergen quote, your interview, I guess it was last summer's DNC clip, once analyzed first, Gergen pretends that he hasn't a clue what you're talking about at first, even though he, what, he hasn't been privately pigeonholed, say, 50 to 100 times over the last couple of years on his... Can you cut him over, please, Alex?
[02:27:23.058 --> 02:27:23.578]  No, I can't.
[02:27:23.598 --> 02:27:24.359]  I got more callers.
[02:27:24.399 --> 02:27:24.959]  Go ahead and finish.
[02:27:25.675 --> 02:27:28.077]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:28.097 --> 02:27:29.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:35.967 --> 02:30:37.167]  Alright, I gotta move quick.
[02:30:37.307 --> 02:30:38.828]  I'll let Roger briefly finish what he was saying.
[02:30:38.848 --> 02:30:40.409]  He's talking about a clip from my film.
[02:30:57.071 --> 02:31:00.192]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[02:31:00.612 --> 02:31:03.652]  I've only played it once here, once on Coast to Coast AM.
[02:31:03.672 --> 02:31:08.133]  The video, it's one of the free clips, which is just the raw footage of it.
[02:31:08.173 --> 02:31:13.354]  In the film it's all, you know, dulled up with all the news articles and documents and history.
[02:31:15.195 --> 02:31:20.336]  But that's just about ten minutes of the two and a half hour film, Martial Law.
[02:31:20.396 --> 02:31:26.097]  But yeah, this is the Karl Rove from Nixon to Clinton.
[02:31:27.139 --> 02:31:31.629]  Lee Karl Rove, the chief strategy mogul, or guru.
[02:31:32.932 --> 02:31:37.101]  And I politely walk up, I didn't ambush him, I didn't say what it was about, I just said I wanted to ask you questions.
[02:31:37.853 --> 02:31:42.817]  And he got very rude and got in my face, and then he went on Larry King Live and said, oh, they're very rude and mean out there.
[02:31:42.837 --> 02:31:44.158]  You know, they're very angry.
[02:31:44.218 --> 02:31:45.378]  No, he's the one that's very angry.
[02:31:45.679 --> 02:31:47.580]  And I brought up the rituals and he didn't deny them.
[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:49.161]  So finish up your point, Roger.
[02:31:49.201 --> 02:31:51.963]  Yeah, and of course he was Ronald Reagan's press secretary, I believe.
[02:31:52.323 --> 02:32:03.371]  So anyway, then after Gergen's failed stumble-bumming around you confronting him, then you have him locked in and he goes back with his, no justification, what you're doing, Alex, is beyond the pale line.
[02:32:04.172 --> 02:32:10.016]  Has a Democrat ever uttered a syllable against a hidden camera interview of, say, repackaging the old meat at the supermarket?
[02:32:10.516 --> 02:32:19.862]  Or he didn't even try a paparazzi celebrity harassment reason, which wouldn't have flied in the context any more than, say, an expose of sexual predation at a kiddie camp.
[02:32:20.262 --> 02:32:29.388]  So he had no reason more compelling than just, don't expose my fellow Hellspawn elites to the light of public scrutiny, let alone knowledge.
[02:32:29.908 --> 02:32:37.452]  And to them, I'm not even trying to deny his earlier comments about the perverted sexuality and lewdness, or the Grove's occultism.
[02:32:37.912 --> 02:32:39.913]  He still goes on to validate the Grove.
[02:32:40.313 --> 02:32:49.438]  But I'm sure you'll be glad to have him back on to refine his comments or redeem him of his position of guilt by silence, and God bless him.
[02:32:50.278 --> 02:32:51.679]  Yeah, take care.
[02:32:51.739 --> 02:32:52.339]  That's a good idea.
[02:32:52.359 --> 02:32:54.000]  I ought to try to get David Gergen on the show.
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.961]  But I don't like being dishonest with guests.
[02:32:57.021 --> 02:32:58.162]  I have to tell them who I was.
[02:33:00.221 --> 02:33:05.804]  Sometimes, you know, we just say, Alex Jones, and usually they know who I am and won't come on.
[02:33:07.885 --> 02:33:09.386]  And I don't get dishonest with them.
[02:33:09.426 --> 02:33:12.347]  I mean, we do it by omission.
[02:33:12.407 --> 02:33:18.950]  I mean, I don't tell them, by the way, I'm going to grill you, but I don't do like popular mechanics did.
[02:33:19.050 --> 02:33:23.652]  Oh, we promise, Mr. Jones, you know, I swear on Chertoff.
[02:33:24.386 --> 02:33:26.867]  Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my eye.
[02:33:28.048 --> 02:33:29.449]  This is not a hit piece!
[02:33:30.329 --> 02:33:34.631]  And of course it was in every sense of the meaning of the words.
[02:33:34.992 --> 02:33:36.112]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[02:33:36.152 --> 02:33:37.053]  Let's move quick here.
[02:33:37.873 --> 02:33:39.154]  Another Ron in New York.
[02:33:39.234 --> 02:33:40.354]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[02:33:40.675 --> 02:33:41.395]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:33:41.415 --> 02:33:41.935]  Two points.
[02:33:42.015 --> 02:33:43.356]  Art Bell is the establishment.
[02:33:43.756 --> 02:33:45.517]  He's always been over and over again.
[02:33:46.418 --> 02:33:50.680]  He shows he lacks the courage to stand up to the establishment.
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:51.740]  Always coming down.
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:52.861]  Let me just stop you for a minute.
[02:33:53.539 --> 02:33:54.500]  Now, I don't censor you.
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:56.121]  You can call in and talk about whatever you want.
[02:33:57.061 --> 02:34:03.425]  But, I mean, my show's kind of getting taken over by what Art Bell did Saturday night with the Homeland Security family member.
[02:34:04.366 --> 02:34:05.666]  Homeland Security Chief's cousin.
[02:34:06.267 --> 02:34:12.451]  So, at a certain point, I just... It was reactionary, and he's welcome to his views.
[02:34:12.511 --> 02:34:13.911]  Chertoff is a dirty liar.
[02:34:14.412 --> 02:34:18.134]  I know that for a fact, but I don't want to get into some type of match with Art Bell.
[02:34:20.245 --> 02:34:20.605]  Mm-hmm.
[02:34:21.026 --> 02:34:23.628]  The other point is, you mentioned the other... I caught the end of it.
[02:34:24.609 --> 02:34:29.132]  Somebody said to you, we're going to get you and you ask God to protect you until your work is done.
[02:34:29.673 --> 02:34:30.473]  What was that about?
[02:34:31.654 --> 02:34:32.715]  Well, a couple days ago?
[02:34:33.035 --> 02:34:34.376]  Yeah, a couple days ago.
[02:34:34.396 --> 02:34:36.298]  I came at the end of that statement you made.
[02:34:37.178 --> 02:34:37.719]  Well, no.
[02:34:37.739 --> 02:34:39.801]  I wasn't talking about that show.
[02:34:39.901 --> 02:34:40.701]  I'm just... No, no.
[02:34:40.721 --> 02:34:41.422]  Something different.
[02:34:41.462 --> 02:34:42.222]  Completely different.
[02:34:42.503 --> 02:34:42.803]  Well, no.
[02:34:42.843 --> 02:34:44.004]  I mean, I've been threatened before.
[02:34:44.861 --> 02:34:49.743]  I've been threatened to my face by people that get into unmarked cars.
[02:34:50.503 --> 02:34:57.205]  I was saying that I hope God will protect me and give me more time because I think I have more important work to do.
[02:34:57.265 --> 02:34:58.186]  I think that's up to God.
[02:34:58.666 --> 02:35:00.906]  I've made my decision like the folks at the Alamo.
[02:35:00.926 --> 02:35:02.627]  I'm committed.
[02:35:03.007 --> 02:35:03.987]  There's no going back.
[02:35:04.508 --> 02:35:05.248]  Here's my point.
[02:35:05.608 --> 02:35:07.769]  You're a national treasure, Alex.
[02:35:07.809 --> 02:35:08.789]  Everybody knows that.
[02:35:09.289 --> 02:35:11.390]  National treasures need to be protected.
[02:35:11.932 --> 02:35:16.636]  Maybe it's time for some of us to literally form a circle of protection around you.
[02:35:17.477 --> 02:35:18.878]  Well, nobody can be protected.
[02:35:19.279 --> 02:35:20.119]  I mean, there's no such thing.
[02:35:21.561 --> 02:35:24.583]  And, I mean, look, there are thousands of prominent people.
[02:35:24.644 --> 02:35:25.484]  I'm just one of them.
[02:35:26.205 --> 02:35:33.231]  And, you know, if the globalists strike me down, I think they'll just give our movement more power, which is probably why they haven't done it.
[02:35:33.932 --> 02:35:35.473]  So, look, don't worry about me.
[02:35:35.513 --> 02:35:36.094]  I'm a big boy.
[02:35:36.934 --> 02:35:39.475]  You know, today I'm going to go out and get in my car and drive down the highway.
[02:35:39.515 --> 02:35:42.657]  That's the most dangerous thing I can do, regardless of who I was.
[02:35:42.997 --> 02:35:46.299]  It's the number one cause of death until you hit 55 and it's heart attacks and cancer.
[02:35:46.779 --> 02:35:48.560]  But we all still get in our cars, don't we?
[02:35:48.861 --> 02:35:49.681]  Just for mobility.
[02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:53.943]  Well, why wouldn't I risk my life for my family and my country and my world's future?
[02:35:55.544 --> 02:35:58.126]  You know, those that are willing to lay down their life, win their life.
[02:35:58.166 --> 02:35:59.767]  Those that try to keep it, lose it.
[02:36:00.567 --> 02:36:02.288]  But I appreciate your kind words and take care.
[02:36:02.328 --> 02:36:04.189]  In fact, I'm glad you called with that subject.
[02:36:04.952 --> 02:36:06.232]  Let me try to dig it out here.
[02:36:06.352 --> 02:36:07.573]  It's a Chuck Baldwin.
[02:36:08.933 --> 02:36:12.054]  It was a vice presidential running mate with Michael Perutka.
[02:36:13.154 --> 02:36:19.415]  And he wrote a very elegant article that really tells it like it is.
[02:36:19.775 --> 02:36:26.297]  And if I can flip through this giant stack of news here, I'll find it about the Alamo.
[02:36:28.017 --> 02:36:32.238]  And it is a very and very important story.
[02:36:33.777 --> 02:36:41.079]  I'll continue with your calls while I try to find this article we have posted on Prison Planet about the Alamo.
[02:36:41.939 --> 02:36:47.140]  Let's talk to Rarrus up in Skull and Bones country, Connecticut.
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:47.880]  Go ahead, Rarrus.
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.740]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:58.742]  I think this whole bit of madness that's been going on with all this international, yes,
[02:37:00.168 --> 02:37:03.969]  There is a certain Achilles heel to it.
[02:37:04.590 --> 02:37:10.572]  They hate the exact technologies and all the tools that they actually try to use.
[02:37:10.592 --> 02:37:20.975]  They actually need experts to operate most of the machinery that they try to use on people.
[02:37:20.995 --> 02:37:21.936]  Personally, I think once
[02:37:28.686 --> 02:37:54.891]  Let me put it this way, technology doesn't work around bureaucracies and hierarchies, and there's a point where it just becomes unusable if you try to build it the way they think, and I think that's where... You're saying the globalists are going to have problems managing their technocracy, and that's why they need to warp the mindset of the American people, because they have to have millions of willing dupes that will go along with it.
[02:37:55.651 --> 02:37:56.131]  Exactly.
[02:37:58.067 --> 02:38:11.018]  I mean, really, it doesn't take much for somebody to deface a Web site to, you know, get credit card accounts and all this.
[02:38:11.078 --> 02:38:20.426]  What do you think it takes for someone to make one of these so-called fingerprint databases completely inoperable?
[02:38:21.112 --> 02:38:22.433]  Well, that's all part of the plan.
[02:38:22.453 --> 02:38:27.516]  The Globalists actually launched cyber attacks against themselves as a pretext for more and more control.
[02:38:27.536 --> 02:38:28.237]  Thank you for the call.
[02:38:29.617 --> 02:38:30.738]  I'll take some more calls here.
[02:38:30.938 --> 02:38:32.920]  I want to get into U.S.
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.683]  Marine Corps' public story of Saddam capture fiction, which it's now admitted that it was.
[02:38:38.783 --> 02:38:41.825]  But let me cover this story by Chuck Baldwin first.
[02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:44.467]  Alamo heroes seem foolish.
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:53.283]  It is the time of the year for me to remind my readers about the magnificent stand by the defenders of the Alamo back in 1836.
[02:38:53.703 --> 02:38:57.204]  The Alamo fell on March 6th of that year.
[02:38:58.084 --> 02:39:06.848]  For more than 13 days, 186 brave and determined patriots withstood Santa Ana's seasoned army of over 5,000 troops.
[02:39:07.448 --> 02:39:12.550]  To a man the defenders of the mission, Ford, knew they would never leave those ramparts alive.
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:17.101]  They had several opportunities to leave and live, yet they chose to fight and die.
[02:39:17.581 --> 02:39:21.343]  How foolish they must look to this generation of spoiled Americans.
[02:39:22.043 --> 02:39:37.488]  It is difficult to recall that stout-hearted men such as Davy Crockett, a nationally known frontiersman and former congressman, Will Travis, only 23 years old with a little baby at home, that my ancestors raised, by the way, the heirs,
[02:39:38.738 --> 02:39:44.480]  And Jim Bowie, a wealthy landowner with land on both sides of the Rio Grande, really existed.
[02:39:45.721 --> 02:39:49.102]  These were real men with real dreams and real desires.
[02:39:49.602 --> 02:39:51.463]  Real blood flowed through their veins.
[02:39:51.683 --> 02:39:55.145]  They loved their families and enjoyed life as much as any of us.
[02:39:56.065 --> 02:39:58.246]  But there was something different about them, however.
[02:39:58.566 --> 02:40:03.048]  They possessed a commitment to liberty that transcended personal safety and comfort.
[02:40:03.704 --> 02:40:06.945]  Liberty is an easy word to say, but it is a hard word to live up to.
[02:40:07.505 --> 02:40:10.485]  Freedom has little to do with financial gain or personal pleasure.
[02:40:11.005 --> 02:40:16.206]  Accompanying freedom is her constant and unattractive companion responsibility.
[02:40:16.866 --> 02:40:18.647]  Neither is she an only child.
[02:40:19.107 --> 02:40:21.827]  Patriotism and morality are her sisters.
[02:40:22.327 --> 02:40:23.387]  They are inseparable.
[02:40:23.687 --> 02:40:25.668]  Destroy one and all will die.
[02:40:26.368 --> 02:40:29.909]  Early in the siege, Travis wrote these words to the people of Texas.
[02:40:30.489 --> 02:40:32.169]  Fellow citizens and compatriots,
[02:40:33.297 --> 02:40:37.359]  I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Ana.
[02:40:37.419 --> 02:40:40.500]  The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion.
[02:40:41.821 --> 02:40:44.982]  Otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword.
[02:40:45.562 --> 02:40:50.845]  I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls.
[02:40:51.385 --> 02:40:54.586]  I shall never surrender or retreat, victory or death.
[02:40:55.126 --> 02:40:55.707]  P.S.
[02:40:55.767 --> 02:40:57.087]  The Lord is on our side.
[02:40:57.107 --> 02:40:58.568]  Travis.
[02:40:59.711 --> 02:41:14.101]  As you read those words, remember that Travis and the others did not have the ACLU, PETA, People for the Un-American Way, and the National Education Association tell them how intolerant and narrow-minded their notions of honor and patriotism were.
[02:41:14.962 --> 02:41:22.647]  A hostile media did not constantly castigate them as a bunch of off, wild-eyed extremists.
[02:41:23.288 --> 02:41:28.171]  As school children, they were not taught that their forefathers were nothing more than racist jerks.
[02:41:28.965 --> 02:41:35.390]  The brave men at the Alamo labored under the belief that America and Texas really was the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:41.414]  They believed that God was on their side and that freedom of the future generations depended on their courage and resolve.
[02:41:42.235 --> 02:41:49.100]  They further believed that posterity would remember their sacrifice, that's what it's all about, as an act of love and devotion.
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:50.921]  It all looks pale now.
[02:41:52.515 --> 02:41:55.836]  By today's standards, the gallant men of the Alamo seemed rather foolish.
[02:41:56.316 --> 02:42:02.938]  After all, they had no chance of winning.
[02:42:02.958 --> 02:42:05.479]  None!
[02:42:05.539 --> 02:42:09.040]  However, the call for pragmatism and practically was never sounded.
[02:42:10.221 --> 02:42:14.062]  Instead, they answered the clarion call, victory or death.
[02:42:15.042 --> 02:42:17.963]  Please try to remember the heroes of the Alamo as you listen.
[02:42:19.645 --> 02:42:35.939]  To our gutless political and religious leaders calling for compromise and quote tolerance and try to recall the time in our country when ordinary men and women had the courage of their convictions and were willing to sacrifice their lives for freedom and independence.
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:44.226]  One thing is certain, those courageous champions did not die for a political party or for some lesser of two evils mantra.
[02:42:44.606 --> 02:42:46.268]  They fought and died for principle.
[02:42:47.285 --> 02:42:49.405]  So did the men at Lexington and Concord.
[02:42:49.646 --> 02:42:50.666]  That is our heritage.
[02:42:51.306 --> 02:42:54.286]  On second thought, do they look foolish, or do we?
[02:42:56.047 --> 02:43:08.469]  Now, reading the writings of the founding fathers and the people that founded Texas, who've now been demonized in little propaganda films like the Alamo, released last year, that flop, people don't want your fraud.
[02:43:09.890 --> 02:43:11.070]  No one wants your fraud.
[02:43:14.250 --> 02:43:16.751]  They always talked about how they were living
[02:43:17.666 --> 02:43:20.367]  Off of what people had sacrificed before them to bring them.
[02:43:21.347 --> 02:43:27.148]  And everything was about how you lived, and how you stood up, and how much courage you had, and what you were willing to do.
[02:43:27.288 --> 02:43:27.929]  People knew.
[02:43:28.329 --> 02:43:32.210]  People already died, I guess by the 1830s, the average was about 40.
[02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:35.270]  They knew how short life was.
[02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:37.491]  And they weren't going to live on their knees.
[02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:46.193]  But they also said that they knew that the minute you started acting like a slave, the minute you started giving in to oppression, you got abused even worse.
[02:43:47.412 --> 02:43:51.715]  I mean, it wasn't that they were simply selflessly sacrificing themselves.
[02:43:51.995 --> 02:43:55.618]  I don't totally agree with Baldwin's analysis, though it's elegant and eloquent.
[02:43:57.079 --> 02:44:02.042]  They understood that the true safest course was right into the eye of the storm.
[02:44:02.983 --> 02:44:08.066]  They understood that the way of compromise led into stagnation and destruction.
[02:44:08.827 --> 02:44:15.411]  When everybody's a cowardly jellyfish, bad people always take over and fill that vacuum and abuse the living daylights out of you.
[02:44:19.508 --> 02:44:23.431]  The people of the Alamo were defending their families, many of which had been brought into the state and were north of them.
[02:44:24.692 --> 02:44:25.893]  And so that's why they did what they did.
[02:44:25.933 --> 02:44:28.034]  They had to hold out if they knew they were going to lose.
[02:44:28.534 --> 02:44:29.855]  And yes, they knew they were going to die.
[02:44:31.997 --> 02:44:37.381]  But it is totally alien to what we are today.
[02:44:39.042 --> 02:44:49.129]  And I'm not even going to sit here and tell you that if I was at the Alamo today, raised as weakly as I have been, stronger than most nowadays, but weak compared to people back then, I don't know what I would have done.
[02:44:49.764 --> 02:44:50.164]  Frankly, I do.
[02:44:50.184 --> 02:44:54.046]  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging out of state in a second, but the point is, is I would have my doubts.
[02:44:54.826 --> 02:44:57.968]  And I'm committed to the same thing here.
[02:44:58.168 --> 02:45:01.049]  I mean, if they win, the globalists are really bad folks.
[02:45:01.069 --> 02:45:05.792]  I mean, the most horrible, demonic thing that you can imagine, that's their M.O.
[02:45:05.832 --> 02:45:07.332]  I mean, the globalists are evil.
[02:45:08.513 --> 02:45:10.834]  They are wicked beyond belief.
[02:45:13.355 --> 02:45:15.216]  And they traffic in evil.
[02:45:15.436 --> 02:45:16.376]  They enjoy it.
[02:45:16.537 --> 02:45:17.397]  They're sadistic.
[02:45:18.719 --> 02:45:20.880]  And they're doing so many bad things to us.
[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.920]  I mean, they'll take U.S.
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:27.502]  troops and put them in a field and spray nerve gas on them and kill them and then admit it and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:45:27.522 --> 02:45:30.583]  They'll put cancer viruses in vaccines.
[02:45:30.603 --> 02:45:33.244]  They'll put poisons in our water and laugh about it.
[02:45:34.144 --> 02:45:36.585]  You know, they're all health food nuts drinking purified water.
[02:45:38.225 --> 02:45:40.466]  I mean, somebody's got to stand up against these people.
[02:45:40.506 --> 02:45:41.747]  Look at all the beauty in the world.
[02:45:41.807 --> 02:45:42.527]  All the goodness.
[02:45:42.567 --> 02:45:43.207]  All the honor.
[02:45:43.687 --> 02:45:45.048]  All the innocence.
[02:45:45.088 --> 02:45:45.908]  All the sweetness.
[02:45:46.698 --> 02:45:48.439]  That is protected by us.
[02:45:49.259 --> 02:45:50.880]  Those of us that are willing to stand up.
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:58.763]  And if your instincts don't control you to want to defend life and defend your family and defend it from a pack of crooks, something's wrong with you.
[02:46:00.444 --> 02:46:03.926]  You know, it's these people when the guy pulls a gun on them and says, get in the car, they just go along with it.
[02:46:04.386 --> 02:46:06.547]  Somebody pulls a gun on me, I'm going to go for the gun.
[02:46:12.029 --> 02:46:13.330]  Somebody pulls a knife on me.
[02:46:14.662 --> 02:46:18.965]  I'm going to go over the knife, and I'm not going to get into stories about that, but that happened a few times growing up in Dallas.
[02:46:19.245 --> 02:46:20.406]  Things were pretty rough back then.
[02:46:20.426 --> 02:46:23.508]  A lot rougher than they are here in Austin, I know that.
[02:46:24.009 --> 02:46:25.410]  The 80's were different than the 2000's.
[02:46:25.470 --> 02:46:28.112]  And I just, and it wasn't because I had courage.
[02:46:29.193 --> 02:46:31.274]  The people say, well, you know, I wasn't afraid.
[02:46:31.294 --> 02:46:33.556]  You know, I just did what I had to do, and that's courage.
[02:46:33.616 --> 02:46:34.636]  I don't even really agree.
[02:46:34.937 --> 02:46:38.019]  People I know that have what you call courage, they don't even think.
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.262]  I mean, it's not even, it's not even debatable.
[02:46:44.321 --> 02:46:51.965]  When you're threatened by something, when you're faced by something, sticking your head in the dirt means that the hyenas are going to chew your hind end off.
[02:46:53.186 --> 02:46:54.106]  And I'd rather fight.
[02:46:54.927 --> 02:46:56.308]  I use the analogy of a dog.
[02:46:56.348 --> 02:47:02.151]  A big mean dog runs at you, and most people run from it and get bitten by it, get mauled by it, get killed by it.
[02:47:02.751 --> 02:47:05.713]  They'll tell you, even the most vicious attack dogs,
[02:47:06.383 --> 02:47:12.847]  If you truly believe you're not afraid, and you have savage thought in your mind, and you go after that dog, they're going to run.
[02:47:12.887 --> 02:47:15.548]  Now, if you just bluff it and go after it, it's not going to stop.
[02:47:15.609 --> 02:47:19.231]  They literally pick up the smell, read your mind, whatever.
[02:47:19.251 --> 02:47:20.752]  It's the same thing with the globalists.
[02:47:22.473 --> 02:47:25.795]  I mean, they can smash me in a minute, if that's God's will.
[02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:30.437]  They can crush me, and then all the hardship of life is gone.
[02:47:30.477 --> 02:47:31.398]  All the beauty is gone, too.
[02:47:33.107 --> 02:47:35.948]  And, you know, I want to see space exploration.
[02:47:35.968 --> 02:47:37.448]  I want to see the new technologies.
[02:47:38.409 --> 02:47:39.529]  I'm kind of a technophile.
[02:47:40.349 --> 02:47:41.610]  I think there's a lot of incredible things.
[02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:42.770]  I want to be here to see it all.
[02:47:43.290 --> 02:47:44.591]  I think I'll be able to see that from heaven.
[02:47:45.351 --> 02:47:48.272]  But regardless, so what?
[02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:54.194]  I'm not going to commit my family and my society and my species to total
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:56.821]  Dehumanization.
[02:47:56.961 --> 02:47:58.122]  Scientifically crafted.
[02:47:58.142 --> 02:48:02.904]  You know, just ripping apart the family and the culture and everything that's good and wholesome.
[02:48:03.905 --> 02:48:07.467]  And I use the example a lot of, you know, you see a small child with a bus about to hit it?
[02:48:08.247 --> 02:48:13.950]  Most people, still today, unthinkingly, will jump out and shove the child out of the way.
[02:48:14.090 --> 02:48:15.651]  That happens quite often.
[02:48:15.671 --> 02:48:18.853]  A lot of firefighters go into a burning building.
[02:48:19.473 --> 02:48:20.834]  Even when there's not people inside.
[02:48:20.854 --> 02:48:22.034]  It's their job.
[02:48:22.095 --> 02:48:22.755]  They're real men.
[02:48:24.338 --> 02:48:25.479]  And, uh, they're not afraid.
[02:48:25.539 --> 02:48:25.999]  I've talked to them.
[02:48:26.019 --> 02:48:26.720]  They're focused.
[02:48:28.541 --> 02:48:29.181]  They're focused.
[02:48:30.742 --> 02:48:31.823]  They've got a job to do.
[02:48:31.843 --> 02:48:33.424]  It's to defend life.
[02:48:33.484 --> 02:48:35.285]  It's one of the most basic instincts we've got.
[02:48:35.565 --> 02:48:40.548]  And when we have that instinct, when we're ready to rock and roll at any time with the enemy, they're gonna back off.
[02:48:41.248 --> 02:48:43.830]  But when we act like a bunch of jellyfish, the wolves come.
[02:48:45.541 --> 02:48:49.866]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.066 --> 02:48:54.492]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.632 --> 02:48:59.037]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:48:59.117 --> 02:49:00.418]  A New World Order.
[02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:06.402]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.462 --> 02:49:13.407]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.527 --> 02:49:15.608]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.888 --> 02:49:26.274]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.535 --> 02:49:28.676]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:49:28.916 --> 02:49:31.938]  In my new two and a half hour video, Police Take 3 is for you!

[02:49:44.887 --> 02:49:47.909]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:53.153]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.414 --> 02:49:57.757]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.

[02:51:46.098 --> 02:51:48.859]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:48.879 --> 02:51:52.700]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.979 --> 02:51:57.219]  Welcome back, final segment.
[02:51:57.239 --> 02:51:59.560]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:10.143]  Not just going out on your local AM and FM dial, but at 9, 9 to midnight at 32 Gen on the Global Shortwave, 32 Gen during the day at 9.985, I believe it is.
[02:52:11.004 --> 02:52:12.744]  WWCR 9.985.
[02:52:14.185 --> 02:52:16.105]  On WWCR thereabouts.
[02:52:17.586 --> 02:52:18.706]  I got loaded phone lines.
[02:52:18.726 --> 02:52:20.406]  I don't know how many of these I can get to, if any.
[02:52:21.287 --> 02:52:25.708]  But I got a few other news pieces I want to hit here that are extremely
[02:52:26.547 --> 02:52:27.508]  Extremely important.
[02:52:28.329 --> 02:52:30.650]  This is out of the United Press International.
[02:52:31.952 --> 02:52:32.912]  And it says, U.S.
[02:52:32.932 --> 02:52:35.515]  Marine calls public story of Saddam capture fiction.
[02:52:36.015 --> 02:52:38.137]  Well, it's been in major European papers and admitted it.
[02:52:38.517 --> 02:52:40.299]  The Kurds had Saddam a month before.
[02:52:40.319 --> 02:52:42.761]  Handed him over to U.S.
[02:52:42.801 --> 02:52:44.342]  forces and they put him in the hole.
[02:52:45.363 --> 02:52:46.544]  And that's what a U.S.
[02:52:46.564 --> 02:52:48.025]  Marine is saying as well.
[02:52:50.207 --> 02:52:51.168]  But I mean, it's admitted.
[02:52:51.188 --> 02:52:52.309]  It was a staged deal.
[02:52:52.809 --> 02:52:54.851]  Actually, Saddam Hussein shot at the troops.
[02:52:55.996 --> 02:53:03.780]  It goes on US Marine calls public story of Saddam capture fiction just like what did Private Lynch call it?
[02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:05.140]  A fable.
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:13.244]  Of course five members of her team were calling that too and men in black uniforms would pop up over back walls at family barbecues and double tap them in the head.
[02:53:13.744 --> 02:53:15.645]  They'd drown themselves in a puddle of water.
[02:53:16.465 --> 02:53:18.726]  They'd get run over by a car in front of their house.
[02:53:19.507 --> 02:53:21.327]  Gotta keep these stories alive.
[02:53:21.347 --> 02:53:24.869]  That's why it was good of Lynch to go public before she could
[02:53:25.805 --> 02:53:27.727]  Fall down a flight of stairs.
[02:53:29.369 --> 02:53:30.149]  A former U.S.
[02:53:30.169 --> 02:53:36.916]  Marine who participated in capturing ousted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but the public version of his capture was fabricated.
[02:53:37.857 --> 02:53:43.783]  Ex-Sergeant Nadim Abu Rabid of Lebanese descent was quoted in the Saudi Daily.
[02:53:44.824 --> 02:53:48.428]  Al Medina, Wednesday, by saying Saddam was actually captured February
[02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:56.657]  In February, I mean Friday, December 12, 2003, and not the day after, as announced by the U.S.
[02:53:56.777 --> 02:54:06.023]  Army, I was among the 20-man unit, including eight of American descent, who searched for Saddam for three days in the area of Doner, near Tikrit.
[02:54:06.804 --> 02:54:09.765]  And we found him in a modest town, a small village.
[02:54:10.506 --> 02:54:12.387]  And not in a hole, as announced, he said.
[02:54:12.407 --> 02:54:19.652]  We captured him after fierce resistance, during which a Marine and a Sudanese was killed, he said.
[02:54:20.664 --> 02:54:24.286]  He said Saddam himself fired at them with a gun from a window of a room on the second floor.
[02:54:24.867 --> 02:54:26.208]  They were shouting at him in Arabic.
[02:54:26.948 --> 02:54:27.749]  You have to surrender.
[02:54:27.769 --> 02:54:29.089]  There is no point of resisting.
[02:54:29.129 --> 02:54:37.775]  Later on, a military production team fabricated the film of Saddam captured in a hole, which was in fact a deserted well, he said.
[02:54:37.795 --> 02:54:42.658]  He was interviewed from Lebanon.
[02:54:43.118 --> 02:54:44.679]  And that fits all the other stuff we've got.
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:49.382]  Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced The Private Lynch.
[02:54:50.143 --> 02:54:51.785]  Story, even the raid and everything.
[02:54:52.486 --> 02:54:53.447]  That's BBC.
[02:54:54.148 --> 02:54:55.669]  They have little crews that do this.
[02:54:55.829 --> 02:54:59.353]  The doctors were there waiting, waving at them.
[02:54:59.493 --> 02:55:01.115]  The Iraqis had pulled out two days before.
[02:55:01.135 --> 02:55:05.320]  So they beat them up and knocked down doors and did all that for the cameras.
[02:55:06.286 --> 02:55:10.789]  It was the Hispanic gentleman that killed all the Iraqis valiantly, but they stole that from him.
[02:55:11.389 --> 02:55:15.331]  David to Lynch, you hid in the tank and did absolutely nothing, and she went public and said that.
[02:55:15.892 --> 02:55:20.094]  It was because Bush wants women in the military, so it was another made-up lie, but hey, so what?
[02:55:20.574 --> 02:55:20.955]  So what?
[02:55:21.055 --> 02:55:22.275]  You know, hey, it feels good, doesn't it?
[02:55:23.356 --> 02:55:25.738]  Uh, before we end this broadcast, sorry, no more calls.
[02:55:25.878 --> 02:55:26.418]  I apologize.
[02:55:27.751 --> 02:55:31.595]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is my best work.
[02:55:32.055 --> 02:55:36.960]  It covers 9-11, the latest police state developments, the occult elite that run the planet.
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:39.722]  It exposes the biggest secret in this film.
[02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:45.107]  You will learn the secret that holds the grasp of the world's future in its talented hands.
[02:55:45.828 --> 02:55:48.430]  Two and a half hours plus, $25.95.
