[00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:06.232]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:07.953]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:09.815]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:11.256]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:13.918]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:17.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:21.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:25.648]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:29.311]  It is Thursday, the 15th day of September 2005.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.662]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:46.448]  Things are deteriorating visibly in Iraq as insurgents intensify their attacks on U.S.
[00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:50.070]  corporate forces based there in the Gulf.
[00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.293]  And the Pentagon plan rolls forward unabated.
[00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:59.475]  This has been their plan since the beginning.
[00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:01.256]  We have their own admissions.
[00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:09.800]  Also, with Hurricane Katrina, Bush gives yet another speech last night and takes full responsibility for it.
[00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:23.848]  And remember about two years ago when in Florida that company was dumping thousands of dead bodies in a lake and throwing them in the woods and wild hogs and dogs were gobbling?
[00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:30.672]  Well, that's the same company that Bush has hired to deal with the bodies
[00:01:31.533 --> 00:02:00.810]  from Hurricane Katrina and Bush was actually named as a defendant back in 2000 for criminal activities of the company here in Texas and you know it seems like a petty story compared to the big earth-shattering things that are happening all around us but just the incredible arrogance of not caring if we talk about it, not caring if we expose it
[00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:04.338]  Just, yeah, I'll hire the same company that's done all this.
[00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.179]  That's who we're going to use, because they're our big campaign contributors.
[00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.320]  It's just so overt, it's scary.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.961]  So FEMA, Louisiana, outsourcing Katrina body count, the firm implicated in body dumping scandals.
[00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:29.263]  And we've got one of the head lawyers, one of the head partners, Ted Leopold of
[00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:38.729]  Reesey and Leopold joining us, who just won a massive, massive lawsuit against the company.
[00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.094]  Well, the Air Force Times really loved this headline, so they ran it, and it's from Gannett News Service.
[00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:53.600]  Federal troops should be first responders to natural disasters, experts say.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.784]  So FEMA purposefully drops the ball, doesn't let food or water in, creates a crisis.
[00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:08.647]  accentuates an already developed crisis, an emergency, and then they blow the bugle and why?
[00:03:08.707 --> 00:03:19.189]  Here comes the cavalry, here comes the army, they are saving us and we need the army to run our lives and to keep us safe from the terrorists.
[00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.769]  So we'll go over this report as well.
[00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.531]  Terrorists unite to plot Iraqi civil war.
[00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.231]  This out of the
[00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:31.475]  Times of London today.
[00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:34.357]  Yes, anyone fighting is a terrorist.
[00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:48.847]  A terrorist mastermind has united insurgent groups in Baghdad to target the Iraqi Sunni Muslim community with the aim of bringing civil war to Iraq, the Times has learned.
[00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:51.426]  According to U.S.
[00:03:51.807 --> 00:04:10.796]  military intelligence sources, Abu Massab al-Zawahiri, the CIA front man, the man responsible for the bloodiest acts of terror in Iraq over the past two years, now commands thousands of fighters from various rival groups and is set to order future waves of bombings.
[00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:11.336]  Yes.
[00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:13.406]  He's just magical.
[00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:14.907]  He commands everyone.
[00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:18.429]  All these groups that hate each other magically work for him.
[00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.471]  He's been captured five times, killed twice.
[00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:24.513]  They never retract any of the captures or killings.
[00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:28.636]  And now he's back again.
[00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:34.200]  Why, if a pipe breaks in your house, in your basement, it was him.
[00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:41.245]  If a thunder, booms and lightning burns down your house, it was Al-Zawahiri.
[00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:44.254]  If Bush's approval ratings drop, it's him!
[00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:45.554]  It's him!
[00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:46.555]  He's everywhere!
[00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:48.836]  Run for your lives, Goldstein!
[00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:54.918]  Only Big Brother can save you from the wilds and the guile of Goldstein!
[00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:56.999]  Give up all your rights to the troops!
[00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.060]  They're here to save you!
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.401]  Goldstein will get you if you don't!
[00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:05.790]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.437]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:14.923]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:16.325]  The New World Order.
[00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:22.308]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:29.290]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.491]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.812]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccination.
[00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:42.233]  The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:47.815]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:52.215]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:11.129]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to the low detectable limits.
[00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:20.375]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.596]  Into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:28.659]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:35.502]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:42.565]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:44.626]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.947]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:03.076]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:07:03.136 --> 00:07:06.718]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:07.218]  Shocking?
[00:07:07.318 --> 00:07:07.779]  Of course!
[00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.100]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.141]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:14.722]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:07:14.882 --> 00:07:19.144]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott, Ph.D.
[00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:20.745]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.

[00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:26.988]  It should be mandatory.
[00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:27.468]  We're good to go.

[00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:06.454]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.114 --> 00:08:08.174]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:10.095]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:11.475]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:13.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:17.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:22.098]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:25.899]  Criminal elements.
[00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.879]  Corporate elements.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.980]  Non-free market elements.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.201]  Organized crime syndicate systems.
[00:08:35.658 --> 00:08:49.447]  have fed our troops over and over again into meat grinders into wars that are designed to be the most profitable for the defense contractors and their private banking owners.
[00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:52.910]  And that's exactly what's happening in Iraq.
[00:08:52.970 --> 00:09:00.375]  The Pentagon's own documents we've made films about that we link to on a daily basis admit
[00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:04.474]  That they want martial law in Iraq.
[00:09:04.514 --> 00:09:07.516]  They never want a real government to be put into power.
[00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.578]  They never want a strong government, a good government.
[00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:13.440]  They want endless civil war.
[00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:16.122]  Divide and conquer.
[00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:23.687]  And so now there have been scores of bombings yesterday and today.
[00:09:23.747 --> 00:09:24.928]  Just massive death.
[00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:28.350]  The bloodiest days to date.
[00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:35.718]  In the last two days, the bloodiest days since the supposed liberation two plus years ago.
[00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:53.890]  And our troops are being slaughtered left and right, and they're also being trained in gun confiscation, in checkpoints, in breaking up families, and people not having their papers in order, and being taken to one of 32 camps, which are in many cases death camps.
[00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.512]  This whole thing, and the Pentagon admits it,
[00:09:57.172 --> 00:10:16.388]  Is an exercise, is a drill, is a laboratory, just like New Orleans is a laboratory, of federalizing police from all over the country, sending them under joint command under the FBI, BATF, via NORTHCOM, or the North American Command.
[00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.034]  It looks horrible, it looks like the government screwed up, it looks like bedlam to you and I.
[00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:34.033]  But this booming, buzzing, exploding, sputtering, smoking is the emergence of the New World Order, or Order Out of Chaos.
[00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:50.545]  Now before I get into Iraq, and before I get into the body dumping scam and the criminal organization that Bush has hired to get rid of the bodies, just an illustration of the type of in-your-face corruption we're dealing with,
[00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:56.327]  And before I get into what's happening with the economy, there is just so much today.
[00:10:56.927 --> 00:11:02.608]  Paul Watson, by the way, is joining us in the third hour for one of his, I guess, bi-weekly reports.
[00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:12.950]  And his report from Prison Planet, and coming up in about 20 minutes we have the head of a major law firm that just won a major lawsuit against Bush's buddies.
[00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.731]  Remember in Florida, all the thousands of dead bodies dumped in the woods, pigs and dogs eating them?
[00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:19.995]  Remember that?
[00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:26.757]  Well, it's the same company Bush has hired for the cleanup in New Orleans, because they'll keep their mouths shut and do what they're told.
[00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:30.118]  So, that is coming up.
[00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:34.580]  I mean, in every case, Bush surrounds himself with criminal corporations.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.940]  He has to.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.981]  They know how to follow orders.
[00:11:38.381 --> 00:11:39.841]  They know how to break the law.
[00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:42.542]  They know how to get the job done.
[00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:47.477]  Just like a lot of your FEMA employees are hardcore criminals.
[00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:56.920]  We wrote a big article about that last week, pulling from multiple mainstream articles, where they hire, knowingly, hardcore felons to be leaders.
[00:11:58.081 --> 00:12:00.502]  Because again, Stalin, Hitler, they all do it.
[00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:01.702]  They hire criminals.
[00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:05.403]  They open up the jails to find their cadres.
[00:12:07.544 --> 00:12:09.045]  Because they'll do what they're told.
[00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:10.065]  They'll abuse you.
[00:12:12.563 --> 00:12:14.684]  But all that aside, look at this headline.
[00:12:14.744 --> 00:12:15.964]  Canadian official.
[00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:17.604]  Torture can be tolerated.
[00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:18.404]  UPI.
[00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:20.865]  So, here's the media, here's the government again.
[00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:22.005]  Torture is good.
[00:12:22.065 --> 00:12:23.345]  We'll get into that.
[00:12:23.446 --> 00:12:38.329]  But before I go any further and don't have time to cover it, remember three weeks ago the State Department listed conspiracy websites like Rents.com and others?
[00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:50.283]  And said that we're all insane liars, why we're probably funded, well they didn't say probably, they said we're funded by secret communist groups.
[00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:54.425]  Ah yes, the State Department isn't communist, we are.
[00:12:56.346 --> 00:13:07.951]  And we are completely evil, and we are just liars, we say the government was involved in 9-11, why we even say China is selling body parts,
[00:13:09.304 --> 00:13:11.845]  For cosmetics and organ transplantation.
[00:13:12.986 --> 00:13:30.774]  And then Steve Watson did an excellent analysis, a detailed analysis, from the State Department's own previous reports, where good people on the State Department had decried China selling body parts of political dissidents.
[00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:34.696]  Now you've got to love the richness of this.
[00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:38.318]  We criticize the Communist Chinese.
[00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:41.417]  We're selling political dissidents organs.
[00:13:41.857 --> 00:13:42.978]  We're murdering people.
[00:13:44.618 --> 00:13:58.824]  I mean, the BBC, the Associated Press, even the New York Times has reported on how giant hospitals in New York are brimming with doctors treating Americans who fly back every day with their new livers and hearts and kidneys.
[00:14:00.165 --> 00:14:00.765]  And lungs.
[00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:02.286]  And skin.
[00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:05.191]  I mean, this is old news.
[00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:10.863]  This is like the State Department denying that George Washington existed.
[00:14:11.645 --> 00:14:13.950]  Literally, I mean, it's of the same level.
[00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:24.359]  By the way, that Urban Legend website, who Rumsfeld and others love to quote, I mean, they say that the claim that WMDs, you know, that the Bush administration said there were WMDs, is a conspiracy.
[00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:28.681]  They say the claim that the Bushes flew out the Bin Ladens is a conspiracy.
[00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.103]  Well, the State Department does the same thing.
[00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:35.706]  I mean, it's like saying, saying Jesus Christ existed is a conspiracy.
[00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:39.908]  Saying George Washington existed is a conspiracy.
[00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:44.331]  Saying the sun came up in the morning is a conspiracy.
[00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:53.424]  And so we're evil, lying communists, and I give no evidence of this statement.
[00:14:54.384 --> 00:15:08.609]  We're evil, lying communists, ladies and gentlemen, because we say China is selling organs of people they've murdered.
[00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.931]  So, figure that one out, if you can.
[00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:28.005]  Well, here is the London Guardian, and literally, if you just type in, Chinese cosmetics firm using skin from executed prisoners, if you just type that in, literally there are like 50 articles plus this morning.
[00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:36.350]  And this broke yesterday, Chinese cosmetics firm using skin from executed prisoners, London Guardian.
[00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:49.965]  A Chinese cosmetics company is using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop beauty products for sale in Europe, an investigation by the Guardian has discovered.
[00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.267]  And by the way, how did the Guardian discover this?
[00:15:54.828 --> 00:16:03.813]  Well, there are ads in cosmetic magazines, it's never been a secret, and they say, we use the skin from people we've killed.
[00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:08.668]  The Chinese government actually advertises.
[00:16:08.728 --> 00:16:10.528]  See, this is the thing, folks.
[00:16:10.548 --> 00:16:14.589]  They have public executions in sports stadiums in China every day.
[00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.291]  It's like a public sport or something.
[00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:21.851]  The public just loves it.
[00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:24.332]  And we've got Scotsman articles.
[00:16:24.412 --> 00:16:26.312]  It's in my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:16:26.932 --> 00:16:32.934]  They have, what is it, 24 mobile execution vans
[00:16:34.051 --> 00:17:00.318]  And in one city, five of them are based in one of China's biggest cities, and they just drive around, no judge, no jury, and if you've been caught stealing anything, or if you've been caught criticizing the government, they literally pull up, and it shows a young woman being choked, and they walk you out, and they give you a lethal injection, and they hang you up right in the back of the truck, just like I skin a deer, folks, and they wrench off your fat and your skin, and put it in one bucket and your organs in another,
[00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.480]  And it's just all over the place.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.721]  It says they'll just stop down a little lonely road.
[00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:06.782]  They just do it in trucks.
[00:17:07.422 --> 00:17:09.824]  And people drive by and there's the gutting going on.
[00:17:10.224 --> 00:17:12.925]  You know, you gut them and the guts spill out in a big bucket.
[00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:14.766]  And it's just fun.
[00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.987]  And they show you the young woman being taken out.
[00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:19.068]  And the police are choking her with pleasure.
[00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:21.469]  They've got sick looks on their faces of pleasure.
[00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:22.710]  Getting off on it.
[00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.092]  And they just kill you and hang you up by your ankles.
[00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:30.434]  And they gut you and do all the goodies.
[00:17:31.448 --> 00:17:33.249]  And the State Department says, I'm a commie!
[00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:47.017]  Really, I mean, it just, it lists all these websites and all these patriots and all these good people, and then it just says, some of them are funded by communists.
[00:17:47.878 --> 00:17:50.500]  What in the world does that mean?
[00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:55.382]  This is Alger Hiss and the State Department, folks.
[00:17:55.803 --> 00:17:56.943]  Alger Hiss and the UN.
[00:17:56.983 --> 00:17:59.305]  This is the, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:18:01.687 --> 00:18:06.731]  And so it doesn't exist, everything's fine, go buy your cosmetics, everything's okay.
[00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:11.355]  Folks, they've been putting dead babies from America in cosmetics for a long time.
[00:18:13.116 --> 00:18:16.499]  And they've been putting dead Chinese babies in the cosmetics for a long time.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.244]  And they've been putting, I mean, they sell babies for pharmacological use every day.
[00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:29.830]  And now they just grow the embryos and use them, and then there's no connection to a woman's womb, so they claim it's alright.
[00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.090]  So,
[00:18:32.006 --> 00:18:48.996]  I don't know what I can say to you, or what I can do, but... I guess the State Department says it doesn't exist, so... It says agents from the firm have told would-be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot.
[00:18:49.516 --> 00:18:57.541]  The agent says some of the company's products have been exported to the UK and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is traditional.
[00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.001]  See, it's traditional!
[00:18:59.502 --> 00:19:01.683]  And nothing to make such a big fuss about.
[00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:05.529]  But again, if you expose the communist Chinese, you're a commie.
[00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:21.520]  With European regulations to control cosmetic treatment such as collagen not expected for several years, doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing number of people seeking to improve their looks.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.023]  Apart from ethical concerns, there is also the potential risk of infection.
[00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:28.765]  Uh, yeah.
[00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:34.245]  Cannibalism is very dangerous, folks, and make no mistake, this is cannibalism.
[00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:41.266]  Putting other people's fluids and body parts into your body, you're gonna pay the Pied Piper.
[00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:48.128]  But, hey, it doesn't exist, folks, so everything's fine.
[00:19:48.148 --> 00:19:49.508]  They're advertising it openly.
[00:19:50.048 --> 00:19:54.629]  They say, we've always done this, but their friends at the State Department say it doesn't exist.
[00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:57.210]  So I apologize, it doesn't exist.
[00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.790]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.074 --> 00:20:04.597]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:05.277 --> 00:20:14.907]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:20:15.908 --> 00:20:25.418]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:20:26.468 --> 00:20:31.369]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[00:21:53.153 --> 00:21:54.153]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.696]  Currency devaluation.
[00:22:00.816 --> 00:22:01.476]  Inflation.
[00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:02.157]  One and the same.
[00:22:02.217 --> 00:22:07.260]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.232 --> 00:22:24.353]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:24.613 --> 00:22:26.454]  The bank pays you 1%.
[00:22:26.694 --> 00:22:30.536]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:32.296]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:36.258]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:36.738 --> 00:22:40.399]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.781]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.123 --> 00:22:48.845]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:23:01.664 --> 00:23:05.547]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.687 --> 00:23:07.429]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.509 --> 00:23:08.750]  But not just any water.
[00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.053]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:22.821]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:28.748]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[00:23:28.928 --> 00:23:33.513]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[00:23:33.693 --> 00:23:37.638]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[00:23:37.978 --> 00:23:40.878]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.565 --> 00:24:12.328]  Government is not reason, it is force.
[00:24:12.428 --> 00:24:15.811]  It will abuse you as it gets big and unchecked.
[00:24:16.852 --> 00:24:17.913]  It always happens.
[00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:19.635]  It is a rule.
[00:24:19.755 --> 00:24:21.557]  It is a law of nature.
[00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:23.198]  A law of man.
[00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:25.460]  A law of history.
[00:24:26.722 --> 00:24:33.068]  And so you just trust the government and beg them to take all your rights away and don't mind the fact that police are wearing skulls and
[00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:41.014]  Flaming skulls and daggers and black widow insignias on their hats and on their shoulders.
[00:24:41.574 --> 00:24:44.534]  And don't mind the fact they're kicking indoors confiscating guns.
[00:24:45.175 --> 00:24:48.075]  Don't matter all the classic trappings of oppression.
[00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:53.537]  Never mind the fact they're already cloning embryos and cloning humans and using them for body parts.
[00:24:53.557 --> 00:25:00.578]  And never mind the fact they're melting people down and sucking their innards out for use in cosmetics.
[00:25:00.638 --> 00:25:01.618]  Just deny it!
[00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:03.759]  And don't care about those human rights.
[00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:07.241]  Don't worry, just care about yourself and you'll be okay.
[00:25:09.183 --> 00:25:11.064]  And you know, that's the fraud, my friends.
[00:25:11.544 --> 00:25:19.590]  All these yuppies and all these trendies and all these people, they think they get ahead because they burrow into the New World Order.
[00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.491]  They join the New World Order.
[00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:25.614]  They serve the system as little grasping yes-men.
[00:25:27.175 --> 00:25:30.838]  And they think that if they only care about themselves, that somehow they get ahead.
[00:25:31.795 --> 00:25:34.479]  And when you have that attitude, you are wide open.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.803]  You're going to be miserable your whole life.
[00:25:36.823 --> 00:25:39.868]  You're going to die friendless, loveless.
[00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.516]  You'll probably never even get married or have happy children, if you do get married.
[00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:55.333]  And you'll wonder why you have all these fake, cosmetic, you know, glowing, golf-playing, you know, friends that could care less about you.
[00:25:55.533 --> 00:26:01.095]  It's all about posing and primping and playing the part of some successful, powerful person.
[00:26:01.275 --> 00:26:02.996]  And it means absolutely nothing.
[00:26:03.276 --> 00:26:04.696]  I see you on the streets.
[00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:09.138]  I look at you putting on your fake, you know, facade, fronting.
[00:26:10.094 --> 00:26:12.536]  And you giggle and you laugh about the tyranny.
[00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:14.718]  You think it's all funny, you idiots.
[00:26:15.318 --> 00:26:18.861]  The New World Order sees you as a cockroach to be stomped on.
[00:26:20.322 --> 00:26:21.383]  So make your jokes.
[00:26:21.743 --> 00:26:23.764]  China isn't selling organs.
[00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:26.767]  Well, I've heard neocons on talk radio.
[00:26:27.147 --> 00:26:30.670]  Well, if we're going to execute people, we might as well get their organs.
[00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.932]  See, they're just selling us on this dehumanization.
[00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.155]  Let's go to Ron in New York.
[00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:38.276]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:38.756]  Go ahead.
[00:26:39.946 --> 00:26:40.567]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:41.187]  Hi.
[00:26:41.287 --> 00:26:45.291]  Calling you from New York City on a rather historical day.
[00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:49.454]  It was on this day in 1776 that the British occupied the city of New York.
[00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:55.139]  It was on this day in 1935 that the Nuremberg Laws were signed into law.
[00:26:55.879 --> 00:27:02.465]  And it was on this day, I believe in 1962, that there was a blast in a church in Alabama that killed a bunch of little girls.
[00:27:03.303 --> 00:27:11.666]  And it is on this day, at the present time, that we have a meeting of, I guess, people who pass what we would very loosely call leaders.
[00:27:12.886 --> 00:27:18.028]  They had signed a treaty at the UN over the last 24 hours.
[00:27:18.948 --> 00:27:21.549]  And it's rather a strange piece of work.
[00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.031]  They outlawed the criminal use of nuclear weapons.
[00:27:27.051 --> 00:27:27.911]  Which, okay, fine.
[00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:29.652]  That's an acceptable principle.
[00:27:30.305 --> 00:27:53.901]  However, they reserved and retained unto themselves the right of what they called an organized government or military to use nuclear weapons without any criminal... Yeah, what they're doing is authorizing, what they're doing is authorizing what Bush has already announced that he will preemptively use nuclear weapons on quote sponsors of terror or those that are harboring terror.
[00:27:54.742 --> 00:27:56.463]  And in doing this this way
[00:27:57.208 --> 00:28:04.073]  Basically, I guess, absolve himself and for other organized states, because I believe Putin was the prime mover behind this.
[00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:10.258]  Oh yeah, they're setting the precedent to start using nuclear, tactical nuclear weapons on a regular basis.
[00:28:10.278 --> 00:28:13.020]  And absolve themselves from any criminal responsibility.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.361]  Listen, I figured this out.
[00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:18.924]  Lots of neocon toothless followers, they're like moths to flames.
[00:28:19.284 --> 00:28:20.245]  I hear them on radio.
[00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:20.905]  Nuke!
[00:28:21.265 --> 00:28:21.525]  Nuke!
[00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:22.486]  Let's just kill them!
[00:28:22.746 --> 00:28:24.227]  Kill all the women and children!
[00:28:24.487 --> 00:28:25.748]  Start nuking cities!
[00:28:26.128 --> 00:28:29.510]  They're actually so dumbed down, they're like a moth to flame.
[00:28:29.771 --> 00:28:39.677]  They just know that they sense the power, the raw, tectonic, titan-like power of thermal weapons going off, and so they just go, Nuke!
[00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:40.578]  Nuke!
[00:28:40.978 --> 00:28:41.478]  Nuke!
[00:28:41.858 --> 00:28:42.079]  I mean,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.721]  Ron, I'm glad you called it about this.
[00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.822]  This is in the stack.
[00:28:46.162 --> 00:28:58.409]  But why don't you, why don't you not just talk about the bullying aggression of these world empires now moving to use nukes on defenseless people, but I want to get your comment on the slathering
[00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:14.681]  Hags and bimbos and whores that love getting their hands on melted down Chinese slaves and how the State Department says it doesn't exist as the cosmetic firms advertise the melted down slag of humans.
[00:29:15.142 --> 00:29:17.784]  Well, anybody who believes that is naive.
[00:29:17.824 --> 00:29:24.989]  This has been going on openly and the world in general has been aware of this as far as Red China for 20 years.
[00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:28.136]  You can go to markets in China.
[00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:32.138]  Out and out open street markets in which you can buy human embryos.
[00:29:32.158 --> 00:29:32.698]  Do you know that?
[00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:35.880]  They're succulent and delicious.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.701]  And if you're with, you're with Al-Qaeda, Ron.
[00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:39.682]  Please hold me over.
[00:29:39.702 --> 00:29:40.442]  I have one more thing.
[00:29:40.462 --> 00:29:42.303]  Okay, well I got a guest coming on, but he's not on for long.
[00:29:42.343 --> 00:29:44.184]  So after he comes on, we'll get to you.
[00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:46.385]  What's wrong with that?
[00:29:46.865 --> 00:29:47.806]  What's wrong with it?
[00:29:47.866 --> 00:29:48.686]  It's freedom.
[00:29:49.146 --> 00:29:49.867]  Delicious.
[00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:52.708]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.168 --> 00:29:54.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.686 --> 00:29:58.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:08.275]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:08.575 --> 00:30:13.878]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:17.261]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:18.321]  We're good to go.
[00:30:40.018 --> 00:30:41.778]  That's 50% off the regular price.

[00:31:01.596 --> 00:31:07.839]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.979 --> 00:31:14.122]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.422 --> 00:31:22.846]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:30.110]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:35.253]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:40.857]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.217 --> 00:31:44.299]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:52.585]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:03.433 --> 00:32:10.280]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.922]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:15.144]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.485 --> 00:32:20.830]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.472]  The keychain attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:32:25.932 --> 00:32:33.834]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10 year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:32:34.015 --> 00:32:41.117]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:32:41.597 --> 00:32:44.758]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[00:33:10.817 --> 00:33:14.520]  You know, some people accuse us of being negative.
[00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:18.684]  Of focusing too much on the bad things that are happening in the world.
[00:33:22.106 --> 00:33:31.254]  That's like saying if you go to the doctor with a broken leg, you know, the doctor is somehow bad because he tells you that you need to have a cast put on that leg.
[00:33:32.214 --> 00:33:33.756]  I'm sorry, we muckrake.
[00:33:33.816 --> 00:33:35.337]  We expose corruption.
[00:33:35.377 --> 00:33:36.338]  This is what we do.
[00:33:37.236 --> 00:33:52.187]  And when the Communist Chinese are grabbing political dissidents and literally gutting them in mobile trucks and melting their flesh down so bimbos can have collagen for their lips, I got a problem with it and we're gonna talk about it.
[00:33:53.488 --> 00:33:57.812]  I don't care if the State Department comes out and attacks our websites because we discuss it.
[00:33:58.032 --> 00:34:02.055]  It's in the BBC and London Guardian today, so who looks stupid now?
[00:34:04.227 --> 00:34:22.337]  And when George Bush's buddies, time and time again, show a callous disregard for life, a callous disregard for people's remains, when Bush at every level is involved with seedy criminals and other dirtbag organizations, we're going to expose it!
[00:34:24.858 --> 00:34:31.862]  I mean, the guy is nothing but a giant trail and his brothers of SNLs and scams and bank scams and
[00:34:32.552 --> 00:34:33.814]  It just makes me sick!
[00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:35.777]  Bill Clinton makes me sick!
[00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:41.407]  I'm tired of politicians that make Louisiana politicians look like saints!
[00:34:41.827 --> 00:34:43.169]  Look like choir boys!
[00:34:44.016 --> 00:34:54.458]  Do you remember two years ago all the dead bodies with pigs eating them, wild hogs eating them, dogs eating them, thousands of dead bodies in a pond, in the woods, skulls everywhere?
[00:34:54.478 --> 00:35:01.039]  You give your loved one to them to have them cremated and they just are so lazy they just throw a dead body out in the field?
[00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:11.221]  Well, long before that happened, the same company that subcontracted out to that ghoul was caught doing all sorts of things here in Texas.
[00:35:12.168 --> 00:35:15.910]  And we've put a section up on Infowars.com about it.
[00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:25.156]  Two days after the hurricane I said, watch they're going to hire Halliburton and have a bunch of bid scams and not even have bids and yes they've done it.
[00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:29.879]  Halliburton that feeds our troops rotten meals and gives them tainted water.
[00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:33.341]  Halliburton that runs all the other scams over in Iraq.
[00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.895]  Well, now they've given the same company that's been connected to just scam after scam.
[00:35:40.195 --> 00:35:42.238]  Bush has been named as a defendant before.
[00:35:42.858 --> 00:35:47.423]  I mean, it's just the dirtiest, crookedest stuff you can imagine.
[00:35:47.683 --> 00:35:49.025]  Always, they're involved in it.
[00:35:50.186 --> 00:35:53.970]  And this company, I guarantee you, will keep their mouth shut about the real numbers of dead.
[00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.354]  They'll keep their mouth shut about the condition of the dead.
[00:35:58.075 --> 00:36:00.677]  And they won't let the media take photos of the dead?
[00:36:00.977 --> 00:36:02.178]  Troops are still threatening?
[00:36:02.678 --> 00:36:14.406]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle and the AP two days ago that troops are marching up to mainstream reporters and saying, we kill reporters in Baghdad that show our operations.
[00:36:16.968 --> 00:36:18.889]  I mean, this is in major newspapers.
[00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:24.433]  So they're threatening basically to kill reporters if they don't keep their mouths shut about what's going on.
[00:36:24.653 --> 00:36:27.735]  So we don't know what's going on in New Orleans, but I tell you,
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:34.763]  For the people, and we're about to go to our guests, for the people that call for lawsuit reform, let me explain how this works.
[00:36:36.404 --> 00:36:37.745]  Are there bad lawyers out there?
[00:36:37.765 --> 00:36:38.005]  Yes.
[00:36:38.105 --> 00:36:39.146]  Are there frivolous lawsuits?
[00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:39.466]  Yes.
[00:36:40.947 --> 00:36:50.171]  But it's because we've become a corrupt society and because corporations are so out of control that we need to be able to have these lawsuits to hold them in check.
[00:36:50.432 --> 00:36:54.574]  But they want to restrict lawsuits so then nothing can stop them.
[00:36:55.074 --> 00:36:56.415]  So they can have their way with us.
[00:36:58.189 --> 00:37:06.200]  It's good that we have lawyers to fight the frivolous lawsuits and it's good that we have lawyers to then go out and sue people when they need to be sued.
[00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:14.010]  All of these lawyers and these new crops of lawyers are a product of this corrupt, decadent society.
[00:37:14.811 --> 00:37:16.393]  They are not the cause of it.
[00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:19.025]  I'm not kissing up to lawyers.
[00:37:19.465 --> 00:37:20.787]  I'm just simply stating the facts.
[00:37:21.027 --> 00:37:24.871]  And Bush wants to restrict lawsuits so they can do whatever they want to you.
[00:37:25.292 --> 00:37:26.233]  Alright, now I'm going to shut up.
[00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:28.596]  Ted Leopold is one of the...
[00:37:30.316 --> 00:37:54.660]  Heads of his law firm, and we're honored to have him on the air with us today, because now we have the headline, FEMA, Louisiana, outsourcing Katrina body counts to firm connected to body dumping scandals, and we again are honored to have you on, Ted Leopold, from, what, Recy and Leopold, Consumer Justice Attorneys.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.061]  Thanks for coming on with us, sir.
[00:37:56.321 --> 00:37:57.061]  Thank you for having me.
[00:37:57.081 --> 00:37:57.621]  How are you today?
[00:37:57.921 --> 00:38:10.910]  Good, I didn't mean to go through that whole rant there, but I mean, it's just literally this company that you guys just want a settlement against, they have got quite a long history of cockroach-like behavior.
[00:38:12.531 --> 00:38:23.819]  If you look historically, in terms of their business practices, they have been involved in litigation on a number of occasions over the years as it relates to the handling of bodies.
[00:38:25.151 --> 00:38:31.138]  One of the most famous is that big news story, one of the biggest news cycles of that year, two years ago.
[00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:37.585]  Just with the thousands of dead bodies everywhere, you guys just won a major suit against them for that.
[00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:45.114]  Well, there were two suits that were brought down in South Florida as a result of the cemetery and the digging up of bodies.
[00:38:46.651 --> 00:38:54.657]  Uh, throwing bodies into the woods, misplacing bodies when they were buried, burying bodies in the wrong location, a variety of different issues.
[00:38:54.717 --> 00:39:01.101]  Many family members would go to the grave sites thinking their loved ones were buried in a certain location when in fact they weren't there.
[00:39:01.642 --> 00:39:07.786]  And that was a class action litigation as well as an individual litigation here in South Florida.
[00:39:07.966 --> 00:39:10.768]  For those who forgot about the case, I mean, give us some details of it.
[00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:25.120]  Well, basically, it stemmed from the fact that one day bodies were found in the backwoods behind the cemetery of SCI, which is primarily in the West Palm Beach area and down in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:30.767]  And as a result, there was investigations done by the state government.
[00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:40.436]  It was eventually a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of the individuals for displacement of bodies.
[00:39:41.957 --> 00:39:44.259]  Bodies not being buried in the correct location.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.321]  It's just a variety of different avenues.
[00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:54.547]  Well, I have a specific AP article here about wild hogs eating bodies, dogs eating them, just piles of them.
[00:39:55.548 --> 00:40:01.433]  The fact that the bodies were out in the woods and it was determined that they were human bones that were back there
[00:40:01.994 --> 00:40:14.705]  It was assumed and alleged that of course in these areas there was going to be wild boar and things of that sort in and around the area that in all likelihood would have gotten to the bodies at some point in time.
[00:40:15.785 --> 00:40:17.827]  So they're just throwing bodies in the woods.
[00:40:17.887 --> 00:40:20.690]  Now I dug out stuff from 1999-2000 with Bush being named as a defendant.
[00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:24.669]  We're good to go.
[00:40:36.818 --> 00:40:47.321]  I mean, does Bush have no shame that they've now hired this company to deal with the dead bodies, the remains of victims of Katrina?
[00:40:47.701 --> 00:40:49.902]  Well, you know, it's an interesting question.
[00:40:49.942 --> 00:40:55.263]  I mean, historically, if you look at the FBI's background, they have had, there's no doubt, they've had problems.
[00:40:55.303 --> 00:40:59.625]  They are the largest funeral, cemetery, crematorium facility in the world.
[00:41:01.172 --> 00:41:02.173]  And they've had problems.
[00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:11.217]  And they've been brought to task to have their full measure of justice gotten against them by litigants for their conduct.
[00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:16.679]  Most importantly for these types of litigation, justice is very important.
[00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:25.363]  And these families need closure in terms of all of these bodies that are in cemeteries and what's gone on in a terrible situation in New Orleans.
[00:41:27.024 --> 00:41:30.005]  Fortunately in Florida, as a result of what's happened here,
[00:41:30.512 --> 00:41:43.356]  The state government got involved and there is now an examiner that has been put forward by the courts to oversee SDI's fixing of the cemeteries and making sure that all of the bodies are accounted for and the loved ones know exactly what has gone on.
[00:41:45.057 --> 00:41:49.138]  Whether or not SDI would be my first choice in overseeing what has gone on in New Orleans
[00:41:50.276 --> 00:42:01.222]  I'm not so sure that it would be, but I'm assuming and hoping that there was a good faith due diligence in terms of a variety of different cemetery facilities that could organize and do all of this properly.
[00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:05.805]  I'm familiar with the lawsuit with President Bush.
[00:42:06.005 --> 00:42:07.345]  I don't know the details of it.
[00:42:07.365 --> 00:42:08.466]  I don't know how involved he was.
[00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:16.178]  I don't know what came of it, and I don't know if he had any stake in the company at all before he was appointed to be the governor of Texas.
[00:42:16.258 --> 00:42:18.661]  Well, we know that they're some of his biggest contributors.
[00:42:19.802 --> 00:42:20.864]  I have heard that in the past.
[00:42:22.145 --> 00:42:29.834]  Again, I would hope that the federal government would have done a due diligence in terms of investigating all of the companies that had the potential
[00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:37.823]  To take care of all of these bodies in New Orleans and help all these families to bring closure to a very, very difficult situation.
[00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.550]  Arrogance!
[00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.151]  I mean, this is just arrogantly giving Halliburton the contracts.
[00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:49.572]  Arrogantly giving SCI the major contract.
[00:42:49.652 --> 00:42:57.593]  It's just, all of Bush's cronies, now they've turned Hurricane Katrina into their own giant private cash machine.
[00:42:58.233 --> 00:43:03.774]  And I would hope that if we find any impropriety this time, that SCI would get in trouble again.
[00:43:03.854 --> 00:43:09.555]  But do you think that all of their repeated spankings have adjusted their behavior?
[00:43:10.515 --> 00:43:11.296]  Well, we hope so.
[00:43:11.376 --> 00:43:26.186]  I mean, we as attorneys who do consumer justice litigation strongly believe that one of the purposes of going forward with litigation is making sure that people understand and appreciate what a defendant and company corporation has done.
[00:43:26.446 --> 00:43:29.468]  We all want to be proud of our corporations in the United States.
[00:43:29.508 --> 00:43:31.470]  We all want to hope that they do the right thing.
[00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:38.335]  But when they don't, that is the purpose for our justice system is to make sure that there is justice for those individuals whom they have harmed.
[00:43:38.835 --> 00:43:40.016]  And in past situations,
[00:43:41.115 --> 00:43:45.998]  Clearly, there have been instances where SDI has been brought to task because of their conduct.
[00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:49.260]  And the most glaring example is what happened here in South Florida.
[00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:56.125]  The conduct that occurred was clearly very disturbing and egregious in many circumstances.
[00:43:57.386 --> 00:43:59.887]  They are in the process of curing those situations.
[00:44:00.528 --> 00:44:07.192]  I hope and pray it has not happened anywhere else in the country where they run facilities or for that matter in the world because they are literally around the world.
[00:44:08.234 --> 00:44:18.455]  I can only hope that, again, there was due diligence in terms of picking the right company and that there will be extreme oversight by the government in making sure that they do the right thing here.
[00:44:19.571 --> 00:44:29.373]  Alright, well Mr. Leopold, I really appreciate you joining us and you guys have got some interesting press releases up on your website if folks want to go there and read more and learn more.
[00:44:29.913 --> 00:44:31.654]  It's ReciLaw.com.
[00:44:31.934 --> 00:44:40.855]  R-I-C-C-I-Law dot com and you can find it right there on the site and thank you so much for coming on with us today on such short notice.
[00:44:40.936 --> 00:44:41.696]  Thank you for having me.
[00:44:41.736 --> 00:44:42.256]  Have a nice day.
[00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:42.696]  You bet.
[00:44:42.716 --> 00:44:43.116]  Take care.
[00:44:44.956 --> 00:44:47.857]  And again, we had this guest on today because
[00:44:48.743 --> 00:44:55.262]  Compared to hundreds of deaths yesterday and today from bombings and shootings all over Iraq and compared
[00:44:56.249 --> 00:45:00.010]  The gun confiscation ongoing in New Orleans right now.
[00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.452]  A giant training drill for martial law unfolding right in front of us.
[00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:07.953]  A microcosm of what's coming to your town very soon, folks.
[00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:23.838]  If we don't get the word out and stop this, you know, we've got the Chinese firms melting down murdered political dissidents for their collagen so that bimbos can inject their lips and other things so they look more beautiful.
[00:45:24.834 --> 00:45:41.349]  You know, this pales in significance, but it just shows the ghoulish nature of these individuals and how all the scams in Texas, the dumping of dead bodies, just the... I mean, this company is in the news all the time in Texas.
[00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:43.811]  Big fat cats.
[00:45:45.092 --> 00:45:51.057]  Connected in with, you know, funding the swift boat idiots and just all of them.
[00:45:51.377 --> 00:45:52.178]  It's a big joke.
[00:45:52.992 --> 00:45:56.877]  It's like Bill Clinton was surrounded by a bunch of slime balls and crooks.
[00:45:57.297 --> 00:45:59.199]  They all work together.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.683]  And that's why I spent some time on that today.
[00:46:02.703 --> 00:46:03.784]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:07.849]  I'm going to let Ron finish up, then we're going to go to others that are holding.
[00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:09.371]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[00:46:10.091 --> 00:46:10.612]  Yes, Alex.
[00:46:10.732 --> 00:46:12.034]  By the way, you mentioned Bill Clinton.
[00:46:12.054 --> 00:46:25.091]  It was also reported in today's papers that he is sort of going to go on, I guess, a magical mystery tour in which he's going to develop his own form of United Nations and solve the problems of the world that are unsolvable.
[00:46:25.932 --> 00:46:27.454]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:34.985]  Well, they're getting him ready for the Secretary-Generalship in the next year under a reorganized UN.
[00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.126]  That is admitted.
[00:46:36.406 --> 00:46:37.567]  That was what I suspected.
[00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:40.829]  But I want to get back to the original point that I made.
[00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:43.351]  And I want to direct this to people listening.
[00:46:43.871 --> 00:46:48.755]  Now, when people think that they engage in international treaties and law, which says
[00:46:49.435 --> 00:46:58.497]  An organized state or organized military or government can utilize nuclear weapons without there being any legal ramifications or repercussions, crimes against humanity.
[00:46:58.517 --> 00:47:01.338]  And they're talking about preemptively, just nuke who you want, when you want.
[00:47:01.358 --> 00:47:03.398]  Hold on, hold on, let me finish my point, please.
[00:47:03.918 --> 00:47:11.300]  People that buy into that, that government is always good, by that same logic then, the Soviet Union was an organized government.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.181]  And if they had used nuclear weapons, and surely if they could have, they would have.
[00:47:15.701 --> 00:47:16.001]  Alright?
[00:47:16.281 --> 00:47:18.702]  Then I guess that makes the Soviet Union good, doesn't it?
[00:47:19.716 --> 00:47:20.056]  Doesn't it?
[00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:22.277]  I hear you and I appreciate the call, Ron.
[00:47:22.357 --> 00:47:23.537]  That's Romans 13.
[00:47:23.857 --> 00:47:24.657]  Out of context.
[00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:26.237]  Stalin is good.
[00:47:26.537 --> 00:47:27.418]  Hitler is good.
[00:47:27.818 --> 00:47:29.118]  Mao Zedong is good.
[00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:34.759]  If a governor is a Ku Klux Klan member and hates black people, well, he's the government.
[00:47:34.799 --> 00:47:35.599]  It must be good.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:41.500]  And of course, the Bible is nothing but prophets standing up against government and being killed.
[00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:44.121]  Christ standing up against the government.
[00:47:45.467 --> 00:47:48.108]  And then they said, well, who is on this money?
[00:47:48.228 --> 00:47:53.449]  Well, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and the things to God that are God's.
[00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.210]  They were trying to kill him on the spot.
[00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.071]  They were trying to get him to speak treason.
[00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:05.592]  And so Hitler's favorite quote was Romans 13, taken out of context.
[00:48:07.213 --> 00:48:09.253]  I mean, for that matter, why did the Israelites
[00:48:11.835 --> 00:48:14.817]  Go up on Masada and die fighting the Romans.
[00:48:15.217 --> 00:48:16.138]  They should have submitted.
[00:48:16.578 --> 00:48:17.238]  They were evil.
[00:48:17.779 --> 00:48:18.719]  Moses was evil.
[00:48:19.239 --> 00:48:22.541]  Of course he wasn't, going up against the Pharaoh.
[00:48:23.002 --> 00:48:24.082]  Up against Ramses.
[00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:27.865]  Because Ramses was the government God put above him.
[00:48:28.265 --> 00:48:29.526]  It's pure bull.
[00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:30.726]  Okay?
[00:48:31.227 --> 00:48:32.888]  It's total lies.
[00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:37.850]  But no, no, oh no, it is of the Lord.
[00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:40.232]  Hitler is of the Lord.
[00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.413]  Stalin is of the Lord!
[00:48:43.894 --> 00:48:45.975]  China is of the Lord!
[00:48:46.515 --> 00:48:48.216]  We must submit to it!
[00:48:48.576 --> 00:48:50.657]  We must do what it says!
[00:48:51.057 --> 00:48:53.359]  Because government is God!
[00:48:53.379 --> 00:48:57.741]  Well, by that measure, the Founding Fathers were bad.
[00:48:58.542 --> 00:49:00.022]  Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:49:00.082 --> 00:49:00.883]  Regina, go ahead.
[00:49:00.923 --> 00:49:01.283]  Welcome.
[00:49:01.763 --> 00:49:02.204]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:02.504 --> 00:49:02.784]  Hi.
[00:49:03.004 --> 00:49:08.327]  I have to say that Rick Santorum thinks that China's great because they give us cheap products.
[00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:10.962]  Nothing to do with anything else, I don't think.
[00:49:10.982 --> 00:49:21.731]  Yeah, they're great de-industrializing us, and the big corporations use China and economic warfare to destroy their competition, and then consolidate power.
[00:49:22.011 --> 00:49:25.734]  Right, he gets lots of power by, you know, submitting to Captain.
[00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:26.954]  Hey, it's a great product!
[00:49:26.995 --> 00:49:28.736]  Melting down murdered people, it's good!
[00:49:29.336 --> 00:49:34.580]  I had bought a shower curtain a while back, and it said actually on there, made in U.S.A.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.621]  I got it from a store that
[00:49:38.513 --> 00:49:44.017]  The defense has been closed, and it had that information about the rights to the patent.
[00:49:44.818 --> 00:49:46.079]  Do you see that anymore, Alex?
[00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:50.963]  The fact that you can't, remember, Phyllis Shafley brought that up years ago under these free trade agreements.
[00:49:52.284 --> 00:49:57.247]  They can't interfere with the rights to the patent, given all that away under these free trade agreements.
[00:49:57.287 --> 00:49:59.929]  But, you know, we should just lay down, I guess.
[00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:00.430]  Right, Alex?
[00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.731]  I mean, that's what they want us to do.
[00:50:02.478 --> 00:50:03.740]  Yes, I think it's a good idea.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.923]  We should all start eating babies for breakfast.
[00:50:05.943 --> 00:50:06.223]  Oh, please.
[00:50:06.423 --> 00:50:07.465]  Don't take it there.
[00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:11.791]  We ought to go to the store and just have them under plastic wrap and lay it.
[00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:14.474]  This is black Angus.
[00:50:14.514 --> 00:50:15.756]  This is red Angus.
[00:50:16.196 --> 00:50:17.218]  We don't want to get into their...
[00:50:17.708 --> 00:50:18.669]  They're confusion.
[00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:22.332]  You know, I mean, they really... Well, the State Department says it doesn't exist.
[00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:23.453]  Well, so what?
[00:50:23.493 --> 00:50:26.255]  You know, I have this article here I wanted to go over real quick.
[00:50:26.355 --> 00:50:32.721]  The Pittsburgh Post was out Wednesday, August 31st, and I had to call in because it made me think of, I believe it was, Police State 2, the takeover.
[00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:39.326]  Rick Santorum and Oil Inspector are really getting involved in this base realignment and closure commission.
[00:50:39.546 --> 00:50:44.911]  Santorum voted for CAFTA, but, you know, he has to save us on these commissions, you know, on these base closures.
[00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:49.456]  And it brings up the commission, the BRAC commission.
[00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:50.877]  They must be the ones in control.
[00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:52.857]  It isn't FEMA, it isn't our military.
[00:50:52.877 --> 00:50:54.918]  Do you know what I mean by the BRAC commission?
[00:50:54.938 --> 00:50:57.219]  Sure, stay there, I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[00:51:02.754 --> 00:51:05.616]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.876 --> 00:51:07.457]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.777 --> 00:51:12.460]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:19.544]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.864 --> 00:51:21.866]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.046 --> 00:51:24.888]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.988 --> 00:51:29.652]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.852 --> 00:51:34.255]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.496 --> 00:51:41.701]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:44.403]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.564 --> 00:51:46.305]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:01.798 --> 00:52:09.326]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.586 --> 00:52:20.517]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.757 --> 00:52:22.579]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.163]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.504 --> 00:52:27.845]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:52:27.965 --> 00:52:36.956]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.256 --> 00:52:37.757]  That's right!
[00:52:37.937 --> 00:52:45.043]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.343 --> 00:52:49.467]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.627 --> 00:52:54.090]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:54.591]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.655 --> 00:53:09.577]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.817 --> 00:53:12.058]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:12.258 --> 00:53:18.600]  We provide outstanding products like Easiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.601]  I think so.
[00:53:39.198 --> 00:53:39.378]  Folks!
[00:54:08.957 --> 00:54:10.058]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:54:10.298 --> 00:54:15.861]  I'm wrong to be upset about the Mexican Attorney General making his employees take cracker chips in their bodies.
[00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:20.965]  It shouldn't freak me out when 60 Minutes calls for all Americans to be forcibly chipped.
[00:54:22.546 --> 00:54:29.510]  I shouldn't be upset about Senator Biden bringing up forced chipping to Roberts during confirmation.
[00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:31.111]  It's totally normal.
[00:54:31.371 --> 00:54:35.994]  And China openly advertising melted down body fat for collagen injections.
[00:54:36.334 --> 00:54:37.175]  It's no big deal.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.281]  I should learn double think.
[00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:41.183]  The State Department says it doesn't exist.
[00:54:42.304 --> 00:54:45.867]  Even though the State Department's own website says it does and it's horrible.
[00:54:47.028 --> 00:54:53.213]  And we shouldn't be upset about de-industrialization, Bush calling for even more trade deals, getting rid of our borders.
[00:54:53.593 --> 00:54:56.596]  I shouldn't be upset about the foreign troops, the armed foreign troops.
[00:54:57.296 --> 00:54:58.517]  I shouldn't yell and scream about it.
[00:54:58.557 --> 00:55:01.680]  In fact, in the next hour, let's talk about the NFL.
[00:55:02.267 --> 00:55:04.948]  You want to call in, talk about the NFL, how it's going?
[00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:06.829]  Let's not talk about your children's future.
[00:55:07.189 --> 00:55:08.530]  Let's just talk about the NFL.
[00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:10.570]  Regina, go ahead and finish up.
[00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:15.332]  Speaking of the NFL, Alex, Lynn Swann's going to be running as governor in Pennsylvania.
[00:55:15.372 --> 00:55:21.855]  Anybody wants to go to a thing for the three candidates that the Butlers stage in October 10th?
[00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:22.735]  Good, good.
[00:55:22.755 --> 00:55:23.756]  Let's talk football.
[00:55:24.076 --> 00:55:26.297]  Well, you know, there's two other good guys.
[00:55:26.377 --> 00:55:28.337]  One other good guy, Pula, I've been watching.
[00:55:28.357 --> 00:55:29.118]  I think he's good.
[00:55:29.318 --> 00:55:30.698]  At least he has a record in the Senate.
[00:55:30.738 --> 00:55:31.359]  I can watch it.
[00:55:31.399 --> 00:55:32.019]  Bill Scranton.
[00:55:32.574 --> 00:55:33.414]  Who knows who he is?
[00:55:33.454 --> 00:55:34.755]  He sounds like one of those archivists.
[00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:36.255]  Well, let's not vote for somebody good.
[00:55:36.295 --> 00:55:37.655]  Let's vote for somebody that played football.
[00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:47.798]  Well, you know, they're already demonizing football, so I'm planning on going, you know, I hope other people show up and they can call 724-368-3520 if they want to get tickets for it.
[00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:49.719]  Okay, Regina, what else is on your mind?
[00:55:49.939 --> 00:56:00.062]  Okay, now, the BRAC Commission wants to send, it appears Rick Santorum and Spector want to do this thing with putting the aircraft, a bunch of the aircraft, back in their C-130s.
[00:56:03.417 --> 00:56:06.918]  It's the 9-1-1 Center right near Pittsburgh.
[00:56:07.118 --> 00:56:09.359]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:11.099]  You're talking about base closures.
[00:56:11.439 --> 00:56:11.999]  Exactly.
[00:56:12.019 --> 00:56:14.360]  And that's one of the ones that they want to close.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.500]  It's right near Pittsburgh.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.020]  It's Moontown.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.500]  We're almost out of time.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:25.782]  It says that the Commission directs the Defense Department to turn the 9-1-1 base into an enclave that will be capable of supporting flight operations
[00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:27.148]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:28.028]  Send me that article.
[00:56:28.048 --> 00:56:28.769]  Thank you, Regina.
[00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:30.070]  That's really important.
[00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.632]  All over the country, they'll, quote, shut down the old guard armory.
[00:56:49.190 --> 00:57:01.754]  And then next it reopens with the guards still there, the sheriff's department there, the FEMA command center there, the police department there, armored vehicles there, and then it's openly the new command center.
[00:57:02.254 --> 00:57:04.635]  Then the CIA puts an officer in there.
[00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:07.416]  Then it's drug interdiction and checkpoints.
[00:57:07.916 --> 00:57:09.756]  This is martial law.
[00:57:10.657 --> 00:57:13.778]  It has nothing to do with disasters, nothing to do with keeping you safe.
[00:57:14.238 --> 00:57:15.658]  This is the takeover.
[00:57:16.138 --> 00:57:18.119]  And I'm glad you called in about that, Regina.
[00:57:19.099 --> 00:57:24.643]  Folks, if you want to witness this, you need to get my film Police State 2000 or Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:57:25.084 --> 00:57:26.925]  We also cover it in Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:27.786 --> 00:57:39.295]  There's my new film that I just came out with, Martial Law, three hours long, a mini-series covering 9-11, the latest police state developments, and the globalist master plan.
[00:57:39.395 --> 00:57:40.275]  That's the three parts.

[00:58:57.483 --> 00:58:58.124]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.784 --> 00:58:59.844]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.544 --> 00:59:01.684]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:03.125]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:05.805]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.825 --> 00:59:09.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.626 --> 00:59:13.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.688 --> 00:59:20.929]  In the last hour, I talked about a London Guardian article where the Communist Chinese government
[00:59:21.932 --> 00:59:32.154]  Who's openly advertising in major publications that we kill political dissidents and we sell you their oil, their collagen.
[00:59:34.055 --> 00:59:39.256]  And the State Department's having real problems now, like they did three weeks ago, denying this is going on.
[00:59:41.897 --> 00:59:44.637]  So I'd like to hear from the callers on this subject.
[00:59:44.777 --> 00:59:48.038]  I mean, this shows what government's got in store for you.
[00:59:49.659 --> 00:59:51.319]  The big banks that run our planet
[00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:58.922]  Give China awards every year through the United Nations as a model country.
[00:59:59.822 --> 01:00:07.485]  And despite Bush's rhetoric against the UN, he's done more than any president in history to expand its funding and its power.
[01:00:08.826 --> 01:00:09.306]  I.e.
[01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:14.988]  one example is expanding UNESCO to manage the whole Agenda 21 integration.
[01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:20.553]  It's just such a startling example.
[01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:23.953]  Look at all the horrible things that are happening under this new world order.
[01:00:24.293 --> 01:00:26.314]  Look at how the whole program's accelerated.
[01:00:26.614 --> 01:00:42.217]  And as things get worse and worse for the economy and fuel prices, and then the effect on the entire economy because of the increased energy prices, the inflationary spike, the horrible news out of Iraq, the police-state gun confiscations going on in New Orleans,
[01:00:44.066 --> 01:00:48.730]  And it seems the neocons just increase their worship of the government.
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:55.754]  They just increase their zealot-like, blind worship.
[01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:01.699]  And they just prostrate themselves even greater before it.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.581]  Does this make you angry?
[01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:04.661]  1-800-259-9231
[01:01:09.952 --> 01:01:11.333]  I'm going to get into Canadian official.
[01:01:11.413 --> 01:01:12.774]  Torture can be tolerated.
[01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:14.695]  The Daily article about how wonderful torture is.
[01:01:15.055 --> 01:01:20.498]  Massive federal court rulings on secret arrest, secret executions, no rights, no nothing.
[01:01:21.498 --> 01:01:30.603]  Huge calls for the regular army to run our lives and be bivouacked in every local emergency center, literally aiming machine guns at us on a daily basis.
[01:01:30.943 --> 01:01:32.684]  Total martial law being announced.
[01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:37.018]  Troops will be at the shopping malls searching you when you go in.
[01:01:37.218 --> 01:01:38.818]  But the border will stay wide open.
[01:01:39.098 --> 01:01:42.939]  Deals with foreign troops to police America now manifesting.
[01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:45.279]  Bob in Alabama.
[01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:46.340]  You're on the air, Bob.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.320]  Hello.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.100]  Hi.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.901]  Uh... I just would like to thank you for all that you're doing, Alex.
[01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:55.921]  Well, you don't need to thank me.
[01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:56.862]  I'm just doing my duty.
[01:01:57.622 --> 01:01:58.102]  Well, yeah.
[01:01:58.442 --> 01:02:01.343]  And, um... Don't hurt yourself when you're doing all this stuff.
[01:02:01.863 --> 01:02:03.603]  Take a few vacations every once in a while.
[01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:07.346]  No, I was whining yesterday because I just have horrible allergies.
[01:02:07.806 --> 01:02:08.627]  I feel good, man.
[01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:09.087]  I love it.
[01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:09.967]  I want to work more.
[01:02:10.428 --> 01:02:12.189]  I know, but you know, just be careful.
[01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:22.915]  Anyway, I cannot find any double-sided DVDs where I'm looking for them because you can't burn your documentaries without the double-sided ones.
[01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:26.492]  Well, they sell DVD-9s at almost any electronic store.
[01:02:26.512 --> 01:02:30.134]  I mean, there's literally, I've probably been in 15 stores.
[01:02:30.754 --> 01:02:31.775]  That's an exaggeration.
[01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:36.418]  I've been in about 10 stores in Austin that sell double DVDs.
[01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:36.958]  Really?
[01:02:37.418 --> 01:02:42.081]  But Walmart doesn't sell them, so maybe they, um, Walmart may be in the cahoots with the, uh,
[01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:44.228]  I doubt that, sir.
[01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:50.033]  Walmart, you know, wasn't selling digital videotapes until two years ago when I was buying them eight years ago.
[01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.755]  I mean, they're just behind the times.
[01:02:53.376 --> 01:02:55.117]  Maybe you shouldn't be shopping at Walmart.
[01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:56.798]  Yeah, maybe that.
[01:02:58.159 --> 01:03:06.646]  But anyway, I was wondering if anybody out there listening could help me find some of these double-sided DVDs.
[01:03:07.227 --> 01:03:09.349]  Sir, sir, sir, let me help you right now.
[01:03:10.989 --> 01:03:18.212]  I know Walmart seems like it's the only place to go, but you know there are electronics stores, Best Buy, Circuit City.
[01:03:20.313 --> 01:03:21.353]  I mean, there's hundreds of them.
[01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:23.434]  Do you have a Yellow Pages?
[01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:24.694]  Yeah, I do.
[01:03:25.074 --> 01:03:27.335]  Well, get it, and look at video.
[01:03:28.015 --> 01:03:29.016]  Video, okay.
[01:03:29.176 --> 01:03:30.416]  And then start calling.
[01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:33.737]  And then by the third or fourth phone call, you'll find a place.
[01:03:33.757 --> 01:03:35.278]  But I want you to keep it up, Bob.
[01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:39.336]  I want you to make copies of Martial Law.
[01:03:39.396 --> 01:03:42.920]  Yes, Martial Law is three hours long, so it's on a DVD-9.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.685]  They even have DVD-9 burner machines for like 60 bucks.
[01:03:49.306 --> 01:03:50.527]  So you can burn them instantly.
[01:03:50.567 --> 01:03:51.188]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.183 --> 01:04:00.005]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.325 --> 01:04:01.705]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.885 --> 01:04:04.086]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:06.326]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.607 --> 01:04:11.548]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.888 --> 01:04:15.909]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.169 --> 01:04:17.950]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:28.677]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.817 --> 01:04:30.718]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.918 --> 01:04:34.801]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.701]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:06:54.435 --> 01:07:00.458]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:04.119]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.961]  We live in extreme times.
[01:07:10.342 --> 01:07:15.785]  And hence, therefore, this is an extreme broadcast.
[01:07:17.425 --> 01:07:20.987]  Our known technological prowess is doubling.
[01:07:21.878 --> 01:07:25.140]  Every two and a half years at an exponential level.
[01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:34.125]  And I assure you, the technologies we're aware of, on average, are 25 years old.
[01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:38.247]  We live in a managed economy.
[01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.348]  It is only free market to a certain level.
[01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:43.509]  And the baubles and trinkets we're allowed to trade in.
[01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:50.033]  In reality, we have social architects on incredible power trips with Malthus
[01:07:51.227 --> 01:08:04.594]  Social Darwinist views that see us as animals, that openly talk about how they're dumbing us down to then put us into compact cities and engage in an orderly culling of the population.
[01:08:07.276 --> 01:08:09.877]  This is the nature of the New World Order.
[01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:19.462]  And it's time for the yuppies and the ne'er-do-wells and the trendies and the hippies and the fake Christians and the pagans and all of ya!
[01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:28.415]  To stop playing games and stop giggling to yourself and stop laughing at all this evil as if it gives you power over it.
[01:08:28.836 --> 01:08:33.580]  As if only caring about yourself somehow blocks out reality.
[01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:39.643]  I can't tell you how many slimeballs I've seen that laugh and giggle about all the horrible things that are happening.
[01:08:39.843 --> 01:08:41.384]  Because deep down they're afraid.
[01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.465]  They're like little babies crying.
[01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:45.726]  They know how dangerous things are.
[01:08:45.946 --> 01:08:47.647]  So they decide to deny it.
[01:08:48.007 --> 01:08:50.168]  They decide to say they don't care about it.
[01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:54.409]  They decide to go back in their shell and let it have its will with them!
[01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:00.352]  Well, if we're going to go down as a species, and if we're going to go into the depths of enslavement,
[01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:07.999]  In a high-tech antichrist system that at least you're going to have your eyes wide open and not wide shut.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.101]  And you're going to have to look at it.
[01:09:10.121 --> 01:09:11.963]  And you're going to have to see it.
[01:09:12.343 --> 01:09:13.724]  And you're going to have to hear about it.
[01:09:18.148 --> 01:09:19.349]  We're about to go to your phone calls.
[01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.852]  But just look at the steady diet of news.
[01:09:22.232 --> 01:09:23.293]  UPI today.
[01:09:25.012 --> 01:09:28.194]  Canadian official, torture can be tolerated.
[01:09:28.374 --> 01:09:36.118]  Canadian official, during a hearing about a Canadian citizen deported to Syria, said the country will cooperate with other nations that practice torture.
[01:09:37.379 --> 01:09:48.845]  The Globe and Mail reports Canadian Security Intelligence Service lawyer, Barbara McIsaac, said that the government will work with anti-terrorism cases, with governments that practice torture, and it will save lives.
[01:09:49.425 --> 01:09:53.307]  The Liberal state went on to endorse torture and talk about how it's helpful.
[01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:56.446]  You can't trust a government that carries out torture.
[01:09:56.706 --> 01:10:00.888]  You can't trust confessions that are carried out and that come out of torture.
[01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:04.150]  Remember Saddam was bad because he tortured?
[01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:05.170]  But that's a double thing.
[01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:09.252]  Saddam's bad, Hitler's bad, Joseph Mengele's bad, but we're good.
[01:10:10.253 --> 01:10:12.634]  I remember law enforcement magazines before 9-11.
[01:10:13.394 --> 01:10:14.655]  It was like somebody gave the order.
[01:10:14.675 --> 01:10:19.017]  It was like the same person wrote all the articles off the same talking points, off the same treatment.
[01:10:20.498 --> 01:10:20.598]  Oh!
[01:10:21.514 --> 01:10:22.495]  Torture is good.
[01:10:22.555 --> 01:10:25.157]  Here's 10 reasons why we need to torture.
[01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:30.883]  Oh my goodness.
[01:10:31.743 --> 01:10:32.564]  In your face.
[01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:34.166]  And then here's the Cadet News Service.
[01:10:34.626 --> 01:10:40.391]  The same folks that told you two and a half years ago that under a red alert you'll all be treated as terrorists and can't leave your homes.
[01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:42.993]  That martial law is good.
[01:10:43.014 --> 01:10:44.875]  Well here's another one the Air Force Times carried.
[01:10:44.895 --> 01:10:45.636]  They're so proud of it.
[01:10:46.363 --> 01:10:52.566]  Federal troops should be first responders to natural disasters, experts say, said John Yockey.
[01:10:52.986 --> 01:10:56.948]  Hey, John Yockey, you getting a little, uh, Defense Department cash?
[01:10:57.549 --> 01:10:58.049]  Maybe not.
[01:10:58.429 --> 01:11:00.510]  Maybe you know you'll get a job, though, you lick boots.
[01:11:01.711 --> 01:11:06.313]  Again, I see so many of these reporters who just sycophantically trail after the government.
[01:11:07.145 --> 01:11:08.266]  Can I do something for you?
[01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:09.386]  Can I help you?
[01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:10.587]  Oh, you're so powerful.
[01:11:11.327 --> 01:11:13.828]  I just want to follow all your orders.
[01:11:14.148 --> 01:11:18.911]  Just give me some power so I can have some people under me to abuse.
[01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:25.314]  Hurricane Katrina invaded the Gulf Coast region like an enemy.
[01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:27.715]  Cutting communications.
[01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.796]  Isolating security forces.
[01:11:30.956 --> 01:11:32.497]  Now they're called security forces.
[01:11:33.077 --> 01:11:34.718]  And severing supply lines.
[01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:37.051]  See, they use military terms there.
[01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:40.773]  Just like they've been calling us civilians for 20 years.
[01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:43.054]  Now mayors call us civilians.
[01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.916]  The civilians don't need to know.
[01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.757]  It's a security operation.
[01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:51.419]  Everything's military nomenclature for our new martial law.
[01:11:52.139 --> 01:11:58.363]  We're the richest country in the world and we've been captured by the military-industrial complex and we're going to be used like a natural resource.
[01:11:58.543 --> 01:12:00.484]  So shut your mouth, scum!
[01:12:00.504 --> 01:12:02.425]  Let me continue with the article.
[01:12:03.459 --> 01:12:24.448]  It's no surprise, then, that disaster coordinators, Pentagon officials, and military experts are war-gaming future domestic catastrophes with the full-time military playing an integral first responder role, possibly as a police force, which is now illegal.
[01:12:26.649 --> 01:12:27.269]  I think that
[01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:37.577]  That's one of the interesting issues that Congress needs to take a look at, President Bush said while making his third tour of the battered Gulf Coast region this week.
[01:12:37.997 --> 01:12:54.024]  Some homeland security experts now believe there should be federal troops that don't need 72 hours per call up, as some National Guard units require, capable of dropping into disaster zones as the damage is being done, rather than afterwards.
[01:12:54.605 --> 01:12:55.605]  Now let's just stop right there.
[01:12:57.685 --> 01:12:59.886]  They've already built the camps nationwide.
[01:12:59.906 --> 01:13:04.009]  They've already moved into the emergency management centers right here in Austin and all over the country.
[01:13:04.029 --> 01:13:08.592]  You just heard a caller earlier talking about it in Pennsylvania, merging the military and police together.
[01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:13.495]  They've been doing drills covertly for 15 years, publicly for 4 years.
[01:13:14.616 --> 01:13:16.757]  I've shot endless video of it all over the nation.
[01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:23.181]  And they practice breaking up your families, taking your guns, and putting you in camps.
[01:13:23.621 --> 01:13:26.163]  But see, then they gotta have a disaster they don't respond to.
[01:13:26.203 --> 01:13:27.083]  They blockade.
[01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:29.064]  They cut police communications lines.
[01:13:29.385 --> 01:13:31.346]  The evidence is they blew the levees.
[01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:32.546]  That's really emerging now.
[01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.427]  Fits with the same M.O.
[01:13:35.768 --> 01:13:36.909]  They quote, screw up.
[01:13:37.069 --> 01:13:37.950]  Oh, we're sorry.
[01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.911]  Oh, give us total martial law power.
[01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:42.712]  But see, you can't just do that overnight.
[01:13:42.732 --> 01:13:43.953]  So they already set it up.
[01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:49.242]  See, now then they announce they're setting it up because you demand it.
[01:13:49.783 --> 01:13:54.884]  So when they do a suitcase nuke attack, that is the globalist, then you'll accept the foreign troops.
[01:13:54.904 --> 01:13:56.925]  It's like they signed the deals with foreign troops years ago.
[01:13:57.325 --> 01:13:59.486]  Now the foreign troops are here with food and water.
[01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:00.766]  Oh, you're getting used to it.
[01:14:01.006 --> 01:14:03.587]  Bush on the news with the Mexican Marines behind him.
[01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:05.608]  These men are here to help, he said.
[01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:09.023]  You're being acclimated.
[01:14:09.043 --> 01:14:10.064]  You're being conditioned.
[01:14:10.104 --> 01:14:10.965]  This is not a drill.
[01:14:11.225 --> 01:14:18.611]  And now all these neocons I've known who always brag, if I see a foreign troop, if I see a blue helmet, they're in trouble.
[01:14:19.111 --> 01:14:23.034]  They come around wanting my guns during some kind of disaster.
[01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:23.815]  It's over.
[01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:30.820]  And now they're like, I've actually heard them in person and on the radio, turning their guns in is what's needed.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.402]  We've got to trust the government and work with them.
[01:14:32.442 --> 01:14:33.503]  Foreign troops are here to help.
[01:14:33.783 --> 01:14:35.224]  We really appreciate it.
[01:14:37.859 --> 01:14:40.081]  I mean, you people are sick!
[01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:43.584]  You are the gibbering morons!
[01:14:45.026 --> 01:14:46.207]  You are scum!
[01:14:46.267 --> 01:14:47.108]  Go away from us!
[01:14:47.128 --> 01:14:48.209]  You're not our countrymen!
[01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:56.436]  And the left is just skittering and freaking out, and the left leaders are all telling us how great this is!
[01:14:56.857 --> 01:14:58.238]  Bush, you screwed up!
[01:14:58.999 --> 01:15:02.462]  We're gonna punish you with total martial law supreme leadership!
[01:15:03.621 --> 01:15:07.022]  We're gonna punish you with supreme funding and total takeover!
[01:15:07.262 --> 01:15:08.162]  How does that sound?
[01:15:08.623 --> 01:15:09.443]  I'm real sorry.
[01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.483]  I'm real sorry.
[01:15:10.523 --> 01:15:12.544]  It's WWF wrestling.
[01:15:12.864 --> 01:15:13.644]  It's staged.
[01:15:13.964 --> 01:15:15.805]  Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, folks.
[01:15:16.165 --> 01:15:17.265]  It isn't real!
[01:15:20.846 --> 01:15:22.087]  It isn't real!
[01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:27.708]  Tens of millions of Americans think wrestling's real, and more of you think this politics is real.
[01:15:28.068 --> 01:15:29.029]  It's as fake as a $3 bill!
[01:15:33.979 --> 01:15:35.200]  Well, what do we do then?
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.000]  What do we do?
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.661]  That's scary what you're saying.
[01:15:38.002 --> 01:15:41.104]  Alex, I just, I'm going to decide to do a split-second calculation.
[01:15:41.524 --> 01:15:42.084]  I'm scared.
[01:15:42.124 --> 01:15:46.347]  I'm going to decide to just tell myself I'm not scared and that it's alright and that I like it.
[01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:48.108]  And I'm going to join it.
[01:15:49.089 --> 01:15:50.270]  And I'll get to keep my guns.
[01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:53.332]  I'll be part of the neighborhood commando units that report to police.
[01:15:53.932 --> 01:15:59.216]  And then a year after the martial law comes in and they order me to turn mine in, I'll dutifully do it.
[01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:02.898]  Because at least I'll still be able to have a radio and report neighbors.
[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:04.110]  And such.
[01:16:06.411 --> 01:16:17.493]  Because the government, everything's falling apart because of the traitors, and we've just got to arrest anybody that criticizes the government, anybody that fights against our war on terror, because you're aiding Al Qaeda.
[01:16:17.733 --> 01:16:28.176]  Whenever you criticize anything the government does, whether it's forced inoculation, or gun turn-ins, when you fight against it,
[01:16:29.196 --> 01:16:30.637]  You're aiding Al-Qaeda!
[01:16:31.198 --> 01:16:45.569]  You're aiding, because by discrediting the government, that aids Al-Qaeda and al-Zawahiri and the attacks they're launching against our glorious troops overseas!
[01:16:49.653 --> 01:16:51.054]  I mean, that's how this really works.
[01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:54.577]  That's how this really works.
[01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:55.578]  Let's go to
[01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:59.404]  Tim in Florida, then Kevin, John, Jeremy, Clayton and others.
[01:16:59.645 --> 01:17:00.205]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:17:01.546 --> 01:17:05.829]  Hey, Alex, I'm glad you feel better today.
[01:17:05.849 --> 01:17:10.313]  Because, you know, the Lord does hear my prayers.
[01:17:11.454 --> 01:17:13.776]  I've just had bad allergies the last few weeks.
[01:17:13.876 --> 01:17:14.356]  I'm okay.
[01:17:14.376 --> 01:17:15.557]  I just whined about it a little bit.
[01:17:15.737 --> 01:17:16.598]  But thanks for the comments.
[01:17:16.998 --> 01:17:19.020]  What's on your mind?
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.702]  In the byways, there's something about 10,000 to flight.
[01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:26.863]  How do you put 10,000 to flight?
[01:17:27.783 --> 01:17:51.017]  Well, I think Ronald Reagan introduced it, something called Star Wars, and something about a lab in Africa, and something about the HAARP, H-A-A-R-P, and something about Nikola Tesla creating machines, and the hurricanes coming off of Africa,
[01:17:52.447 --> 01:18:09.064]  and the machines putting hot spots in the water well if you put fear into people they will give up their guns they will give up their they will give their blood up and once the military come to the people
[01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:16.125]  The military will say, we conned you, we did this to you, we did this to you, to that.
[01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:18.287]  Listen, I appreciate, I appreciate the call.
[01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:29.694]  No, how it'll work is, well-meaning troops, we just gotta take the guns, never thought it'd come to this, but stuff broke down in America, so it's time to turn them in, I'm sorry.
[01:18:29.714 --> 01:18:32.016]  I mean, that's the attitude.
[01:18:34.137 --> 01:18:38.520]  Look, it's all compartmentalized, it's very small groups manipulating and orchestrating all of this.
[01:18:39.463 --> 01:18:43.490]  Kevin, John, Jeremy, Clayton, I'm going to move quickly into your calls when we get back and there's a lot of other news coming up.
[01:18:43.831 --> 01:18:48.860]  And Paul Watson will give us a big news blitz on a score of issues in the third hour as well.
[01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.744]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.

[01:19:53.536 --> 01:19:55.157]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.278 --> 01:19:59.401]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.521 --> 01:20:02.403]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.483 --> 01:20:09.149]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.449 --> 01:20:09.870]  I think so.
[01:20:25.451 --> 01:20:26.212]  M-T-B-E.
[01:20:26.432 --> 01:20:27.233]  Radon 222.
[01:20:27.333 --> 01:20:29.314]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[01:20:29.474 --> 01:20:34.578]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[01:20:53.344 --> 01:20:57.248]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.468 --> 01:21:09.758]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:10.178 --> 01:21:10.579]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.619 --> 01:21:16.204]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.604 --> 01:21:18.806]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:21.728]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.748 --> 01:21:24.609]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.729 --> 01:21:30.752]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:21:31.172 --> 01:21:34.514]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:21:34.594 --> 01:21:40.937]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:45.520]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:46.041]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.822 --> 01:21:56.304]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.864 --> 01:22:10.936]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?

[01:22:54.079 --> 01:22:59.206]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:59.887 --> 01:23:02.150]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.995 --> 01:23:05.216]  It's simple.
[01:23:05.376 --> 01:23:07.877]  The globalists know how to train people.
[01:23:07.957 --> 01:23:18.463]  The military, the police, the public, all the first responders are being trained in a thousand drills that have happened in the last ten years across the country.
[01:23:18.503 --> 01:23:24.367]  How to take over city halls, how to confiscate guns, how to quote deal with rebels and insurgents.
[01:23:25.754 --> 01:23:28.717]  But then they need an even bigger live fire training up.
[01:23:29.217 --> 01:23:30.578]  And they're all getting a taste of blood.
[01:23:30.598 --> 01:23:32.420]  They're getting a taste of taking down old ladies.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:35.643]  A taste of killing old World War II vets held up in their houses.
[01:23:35.963 --> 01:23:37.144]  They won't give their guns up.
[01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:38.485]  There's reports of that coming out.
[01:23:38.886 --> 01:23:41.248]  You know, the SWAT teams just filling houses full of holes.
[01:23:41.268 --> 01:23:42.889]  You know, when people won't come out.
[01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:44.611]  This stuff's going on.
[01:23:45.451 --> 01:23:47.213]  And then it'll all be swept under the rug.
[01:23:47.253 --> 01:23:49.175]  It'll all be part of the exercise.
[01:23:49.295 --> 01:23:50.436]  We put it under the rug.
[01:23:50.796 --> 01:23:51.657]  Keep it quiet.
[01:23:52.603 --> 01:23:57.205]  Uh, and then you'll have those cadres of troops that have been trained to do this, where it's normalized.
[01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.586]  Well, we did this before in New Orleans!
[01:24:00.947 --> 01:24:02.467]  There's no reason to do this!
[01:24:04.788 --> 01:24:08.870]  Let's go ahead and, uh, go to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:09.530]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:11.311]  Hey, how's it going, Mr. Jones?
[01:24:11.531 --> 01:24:11.831]  Good, sir.
[01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:19.415]  Please let them guys come to my house and try to come up in here because I'm going to shoot every one of them and I don't care.
[01:24:19.795 --> 01:24:21.776]  I'll pull a Waco, Texas up in here.
[01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.717]  I don't care, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:25.337 --> 01:24:31.100]  I plan on being at your Alamo Theater convention thing for your Bohemian Grove.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.861]  You think I can talk to the audience?
[01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:43.585]  Well, you know, we've only got the theater for about two and a half hours, and so I'll speak for about 10-15 minutes and then play the documentary.
[01:24:44.085 --> 01:24:45.786]  That's coming up the 9th and the 10th.
[01:24:46.127 --> 01:24:52.512]  We'll have one showing downtown in October on that Sunday and then one showing on Monday night at the South Lamar.
[01:24:52.552 --> 01:24:56.174]  They wanted me to have more showings, but I just don't have the time or the energy.
[01:24:56.515 --> 01:24:59.237]  I'm working on other films right now and doing so much other stuff.
[01:24:59.837 --> 01:25:04.343]  We could obviously have ten showings and sell them all out.
[01:25:04.383 --> 01:25:06.907]  I'm sure you can talk to people when you're out in the hall.
[01:25:07.347 --> 01:25:09.170]  You can talk to people when you're in the foyer.
[01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:13.696]  This is an interesting phone call.
[01:25:14.292 --> 01:25:18.477]  I think that you've gotten complacent in your mission, okay?
[01:25:18.518 --> 01:25:19.879]  You have gotten complacent.
[01:25:19.979 --> 01:25:22.683]  All you want to do is report, report, report, report, report.
[01:25:22.723 --> 01:25:24.345]  We've got to start doing something, man.
[01:25:24.445 --> 01:25:27.789]  I'm talking physically doing something, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:29.191]  Texas is a big state.
[01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:30.072]  You want to come down?
[01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:32.155]  Texas is a huge state.
[01:25:32.722 --> 01:25:34.102]  Alabama's a big state.
[01:25:34.342 --> 01:25:42.684]  Let's get a freaking militia up and we'll go to New Orleans and we will run everybody out of there, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:42.764 --> 01:25:44.325]  Why don't you comprehend that?
[01:25:44.825 --> 01:25:46.605]  Why can't you get your head around that?
[01:25:46.925 --> 01:25:47.725]  We can do it.
[01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.006]  You're sitting here telling me.
[01:25:49.506 --> 01:25:50.746]  Every week I listen to you.
[01:25:50.806 --> 01:25:51.786]  Every night you're telling me.
[01:25:52.066 --> 01:25:52.766]  Come on, man.
[01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:53.547]  We gotta do something.
[01:25:53.567 --> 01:25:54.287]  We gotta do something.
[01:25:54.307 --> 01:25:54.927]  We gotta do something.
[01:25:54.947 --> 01:25:55.487]  Well, come on.
[01:25:55.527 --> 01:25:56.427]  Let's go do something, man.
[01:25:56.447 --> 01:25:58.648]  Well, Kevin, let me just say something here briefly, please.
[01:25:59.148 --> 01:25:59.428]  Okay.
[01:26:01.272 --> 01:26:12.842]  I've been doing this for coming up on 12 years and I've seen scores of people who shoot their mouths off about how they're Billy Bad Butt and how they're going to go shoot people who end up in the federal pen.
[01:26:13.462 --> 01:26:17.205]  Then I've watched other people... God ain't going to put me in a federal pen, Mr. Jones.
[01:26:17.225 --> 01:26:18.707]  Put him on hold for a second.
[01:26:18.747 --> 01:26:19.767]  Put him on hold for a second.
[01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.993]  I'm trying to talk some sense to you, Kevin.
[01:26:26.013 --> 01:26:28.955]  You also have to be wise about all of this.
[01:26:29.736 --> 01:26:30.016]  Okay?
[01:26:32.022 --> 01:26:32.903]  This is unbelievable.
[01:26:34.724 --> 01:26:43.211]  I've seen people shoot their mouths off about how they're going to go kill a bunch of people and then they either go to jail or they never get in trouble because they're feds.
[01:26:43.872 --> 01:26:48.916]  You want a sure sign of someone who's public and prominent and tells you their full name.
[01:26:50.416 --> 01:27:03.864]  You hear them as talk show hosts, you hear them on other networks, you hear somebody on air saying who they are and where they live and they talk like that, they are framed or they are charged or they are taken down instantly.
[01:27:04.904 --> 01:27:14.029]  You want a sure fire sign, they're a Fed, you will hear them say it over and over again and get away with it.
[01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:20.721]  Then you got callers like Kevin, who I'm sure is very brave, means well.
[01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.843]  I think he sounds legitimate.
[01:27:24.083 --> 01:27:25.304]  I don't think he's a bad person.
[01:27:26.725 --> 01:27:28.466]  But I don't think he's thought through this.
[01:27:29.267 --> 01:27:31.729]  And he's angry at me because I'm not doing enough.
[01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:34.290]  Let me just tell you something, Kevin.
[01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:40.174]  The people that don't go around shooting their mouths off are the first people that will defend this country.
[01:27:40.194 --> 01:27:41.555]  You need to understand that, number one.
[01:27:42.936 --> 01:27:43.256]  Okay?
[01:27:43.877 --> 01:27:45.378]  I try not to shoot my mouth off.
[01:27:46.224 --> 01:27:52.068]  I'm not the toughest person in the world, but believe me, if push comes to shove, I will defend myself and my family.
[01:27:52.608 --> 01:27:53.569]  And they'll be hell to pay.
[01:27:54.289 --> 01:27:56.310]  But, you need to understand something.
[01:27:56.531 --> 01:28:03.715]  The government has to blow up its own buildings, and has to provocateur its own attacks, and we've caught them to then blame it on us.
[01:28:07.077 --> 01:28:08.058]  Do you understand that?
[01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:09.939]  And so,
[01:28:11.607 --> 01:28:18.613]  You know, you say you want to come to one of my events and speak, and then I say, well, I don't think you can probably do that, and then, well, Alex, I got a problem with it, you're not doing enough.
[01:28:24.057 --> 01:28:25.859]  We are waking people up right now.
[01:28:25.939 --> 01:28:27.420]  People are seeing what's happening.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.682]  We are seeing what the New World Order is doing.
[01:28:30.983 --> 01:28:32.544]  We are witnessing what they're up to.
[01:28:33.425 --> 01:28:34.225]  They're losing.
[01:28:34.265 --> 01:28:36.547]  That's why they're trying to intimidate us right now.
[01:28:37.008 --> 01:28:38.429]  The last thing we need to do
[01:28:40.392 --> 01:28:43.177]  Is give them a pretext for even more control.
[01:28:43.778 --> 01:28:44.680]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.161 --> 01:28:46.784]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.685 --> 01:28:50.370]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:55.802]  We're good to go!
[01:29:21.249 --> 01:29:22.470]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:26.014]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:28.756]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:42.491]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.337 --> 01:29:55.318]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.398 --> 01:30:06.122]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.482 --> 01:30:11.004]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.084 --> 01:30:22.408]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.008 --> 01:30:29.856]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.256 --> 01:30:32.398]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.879 --> 01:30:37.864]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:30:38.164 --> 01:30:44.311]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:30:45.452 --> 01:30:45.732]  803-4438.
[01:30:45.893 --> 01:30:48.696]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.936 --> 01:30:49.677]  That's toll free.
[01:30:49.697 --> 01:30:49.737]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.185 --> 01:31:00.688]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:04.950]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:07.351]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:31:07.711 --> 01:31:14.735]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:31:15.055 --> 01:31:17.656]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:31:17.936 --> 01:31:21.398]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:31:21.698 --> 01:31:29.590]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:31.493]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:37.582]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[01:31:37.882 --> 01:31:44.566]  What I'm going to say here in a few minutes to Kevin and everybody else that talks like he does
[01:32:08.749 --> 01:32:10.651]  I've needed to say for a long time.
[01:32:10.671 --> 01:32:13.333]  I'm just going to lay it out there and I'm going to say it.
[01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:18.717]  So, get ready for that.
[01:32:19.257 --> 01:32:22.880]  Then we'll go to John in Oklahoma and Jeremy and Clayton and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:28.245]  And I am going to get into more details of the horrible events that have been happening in Iraq.
[01:32:29.806 --> 01:32:36.091]  And also I'm going to talk about some major new developments in New Orleans and surrounding areas and the tragic events that are unfolding there.
[01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:46.428]  But before we go back to Kevin and others, we had Ted Anderson on a few weeks ago, and he's the owner of the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:46.468 --> 01:32:48.751]  He also owns Midas Resources.
[01:32:51.834 --> 01:32:57.560]  And when I go and I buy gold, and I've shopped, I've researched it, I get it from Ted.
[01:32:57.821 --> 01:32:59.823]  And I get the same deal you get.
[01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:02.823]  Because I get such a great deal.
[01:33:03.283 --> 01:33:11.968]  I mean, I'm sure I could find gold a little cheaper out there, but the company doesn't have the great decade-plus long history that Midas Resources does.
[01:33:12.769 --> 01:33:18.752]  And I've bought bullion from Midas Resources, I've bought numismatic coins, I've bought semi-collectible coins.
[01:33:19.773 --> 01:33:25.056]  But I always get a good deal, and I know that it's supporting a beacon of free speech and the truth.
[01:33:26.909 --> 01:33:29.671]  And gold keeps going up and up and up and up and up and up.
[01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:34.515]  But Ted is able to secure it in his vault before it goes up.
[01:33:34.595 --> 01:33:40.339]  Now, a few weeks ago we told you those $5 gold pieces would go at that ridiculous price.
[01:33:40.619 --> 01:33:41.180]  They're gone.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.802]  And yes, I bought a few myself.
[01:33:46.243 --> 01:33:48.045]  Because the dollar is being devalued.
[01:33:48.425 --> 01:33:50.887]  And this is a hedge against inflation, a hedge against depression.
[01:33:51.267 --> 01:33:52.528]  This is a real security blanket.
[01:33:53.525 --> 01:33:57.086]  And if you don't have part of your portfolio in gold, you're crazy.
[01:33:57.106 --> 01:34:02.128]  I mean, if you've got real assets and they're just sitting around, you should put some of it into gold.
[01:34:03.349 --> 01:34:11.772]  And Ted's got a new special for you that is before the current prices we're now looking at.
[01:34:12.673 --> 01:34:13.713]  This is a really good deal.
[01:34:14.796 --> 01:34:26.991]  And these are $10 gold pieces that also are numismatic, but they're very close to bullion prices, so you get a collector's value to it and also the bullion value, just the raw gold value.
[01:34:27.431 --> 01:34:32.177]  So, to give us the details of this deal Ted's offering that won't be here long,
[01:34:32.837 --> 01:34:34.239]  It's Ted Anderson.
[01:34:34.279 --> 01:34:35.380]  Ted, good to have you on with us.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.841]  Hey, it's really good to be up again.
[01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:37.822]  Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[01:34:37.902 --> 01:34:40.965]  Gold is up another $10 from the last time I was on air with you.
[01:34:41.005 --> 01:34:43.828]  Right now, gold is at $455.20 on the spot.
[01:34:43.868 --> 01:34:49.673]  The December contract just went up over $460, which is a huge resistant level.
[01:34:49.733 --> 01:34:55.679]  I mean, we're looking, you know, with the way this is going, performing like it has in the past, we should see $470 gold very soon.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:05.165]  I can't promise that that's going to happen, but when you watch the futures market and how it trades, it's not very surprising to see it jump up like it does.
[01:35:05.785 --> 01:35:13.470]  Also, if you look at Bloomberg.com right now, they're saying that gold is defying every single currency out there in the world right now.
[01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:21.094]  As a matter of fact, it's increasing even against the Japanese Yen, against the Swiss Franc, just about everything out there.
[01:35:21.134 --> 01:35:22.775]  People are hedging for inflation.
[01:35:23.315 --> 01:35:28.701]  Inflation is showing up in every single nation of the world, and that's why gold is becoming so popular.
[01:35:28.781 --> 01:35:36.609]  Even the central banks, according to this article, are increasing their reserves to hedge against inflation, and they're the ones that create the currency to start with.
[01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:39.811]  So yeah, right now is a good time to be getting into the gold.
[01:35:40.212 --> 01:35:43.753]  You were talking about something about on the... I do just that.
[01:35:43.773 --> 01:35:45.954]  I make sure that I'm able to secure a position.
[01:35:46.335 --> 01:35:47.835]  Gold takes a $10 increase.
[01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:50.037]  This particular coin is still at the same price.
[01:35:50.717 --> 01:35:53.218]  What I have is I've got $10 Liberty rolls of 20.
[01:35:53.658 --> 01:35:55.539]  $10 Liberties in rolls of 20.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.300]  And this is kind of uncommon.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.602]  Right now I've got them in rolls of 20 with 20 different dates.
[01:36:01.368 --> 01:36:04.090]  That means that they span into the 1800s.
[01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:06.431]  I mean, we're now into the year 2000.
[01:36:06.771 --> 01:36:08.652]  These are back in the 1800s.
[01:36:09.253 --> 01:36:11.454]  20 different dates of $10 Liberties.
[01:36:12.054 --> 01:36:14.516]  And currently, right now, the rolls are trading at $6940.
[01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:19.953]  And Alex, I gotta say right now, I mean the handwriting is on the wall.
[01:36:20.373 --> 01:36:24.036]  We're all watching that oil prices come up, even though we've had a little bit of a break.
[01:36:24.356 --> 01:36:29.700]  You know, it's funny when you see, like for instance, we have it priced at $2.69 a gallon.
[01:36:30.101 --> 01:36:32.683]  And I'm looking at that and I'm going, wow, that's a good buy!
[01:36:33.123 --> 01:36:33.964]  That's crazy!
[01:36:34.704 --> 01:36:39.286]  Oil or gasoline at $2.69 a gallon, and I feel like it's a good buy.
[01:36:39.306 --> 01:36:43.928]  They're also talking, like you said, about $6 a gallon for a gallon of gasoline.
[01:36:44.408 --> 01:36:47.549]  That post gold price is over $800 an ounce.
[01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.150]  Obviously, right now is a good time to buy.
[01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:52.731]  People are getting involved in the precious metals market.
[01:36:52.751 --> 01:36:57.012]  I'm really glad we did a tremendous amount of those fives, and you're exactly right.
[01:36:57.072 --> 01:36:57.953]  I can't get them anymore.
[01:36:57.973 --> 01:36:58.793]  They're all sold out.
[01:36:59.373 --> 01:37:02.618]  Everybody who got in on it are watching their investments go up.
[01:37:02.678 --> 01:37:03.239]  It's great.
[01:37:03.299 --> 01:37:04.540]  It's just like the perfect time.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.244]  The gold I bought five years ago, I'm not selling it.
[01:37:07.665 --> 01:37:13.973]  For me, it's just an insurance policy because I know that the little bit of money I've got in the bank has already been devalued by 45%.
[01:37:15.615 --> 01:37:16.717]  It's basically worthless.
[01:37:17.317 --> 01:37:24.078]  And so having that ancient metal, you know, the original form of currency, is just the right thing to do.
[01:37:24.279 --> 01:37:29.940]  And the neat part about it, Alex, that gold that you bought five years ago, you'd have to pay two times as much to get it now.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.321]  That's how much, and you'd also have to almost pay two times as much to get a gallon of gasoline.
[01:37:34.661 --> 01:37:36.661]  So yeah, this is the time to be getting involved in it.
[01:37:36.761 --> 01:37:37.841]  No questions about it.
[01:37:38.341 --> 01:37:39.902]  And like I said, these are rolls of 20
[01:37:41.002 --> 01:37:46.331]  And there's 20 different dates in them, so that's... Now, what if people want to, you know, can't afford a whole roll today?
[01:37:46.351 --> 01:37:48.255]  Well, they can pick up the individual coins.
[01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:51.320]  They are at $347, and that's perfectly fine, too.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.225]  Obviously, you can't get 20 different dates when you're buying one coin.
[01:37:55.302 --> 01:38:00.228]  It's still a really good buy, and it's really something to be getting involved with at this particular time.
[01:38:00.688 --> 01:38:08.658]  But, you know, if you can afford it, and folks, you better do it soon, because I don't think you're going to be able to buy gold at these prices for very long.
[01:38:08.678 --> 01:38:13.303]  Well, regardless, gold has a real value.
[01:38:13.364 --> 01:38:14.345]  It's not a piece of paper.
[01:38:14.985 --> 01:38:17.187]  And folks, you need to give Ted Anderson a call.
[01:38:17.228 --> 01:38:20.491]  I mean, gold has gone up and up and up, and I'm not selling the gold I've got.
[01:38:20.731 --> 01:38:21.452]  I'm buying more.
[01:38:21.472 --> 01:38:21.832]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:21.852 --> 01:38:22.012]  800-686-2237.
[01:38:22.132 --> 01:38:27.017]  And tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[01:38:27.037 --> 01:38:31.741]  Don't people save if they tell them it's the Alex Jones Special, Ted?
[01:38:35.379 --> 01:38:42.686]  Well, yeah, they do say that when they call in, and it does definitely go, the proceeds of it go to support your show on this network.
[01:38:43.327 --> 01:38:50.534]  And so, yeah, they should call in and let us know that you heard it on the Alex Jones Show, because that helps us keep track of what's going on.
[01:38:50.574 --> 01:38:55.960]  Absolutely, what that does, I mean, understand folks, one of the network's digital satellites
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:02.841]  It's like $5,000 a month, so we have a lot of expenses what we do, and I just want to support what Ted Anderson is doing.
[01:39:03.161 --> 01:39:09.563]  Give Ted a call 800-686-2237.
[01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:10.023]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:12.784]  And Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:12.824 --> 01:39:14.084]  Hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:39:14.164 --> 01:39:14.764]  It's a great show.
[01:39:14.784 --> 01:39:16.084]  I've been enjoying listening to it.
[01:39:16.184 --> 01:39:16.484]  You bet.
[01:39:16.504 --> 01:39:17.204]  Take care, my friend.
[01:39:17.224 --> 01:39:17.665]  God bless.
[01:39:18.105 --> 01:39:24.026]  And again, I'll normally have Ted on two or three times a year, and I've had him on a couple times in the last few weeks just because
[01:39:24.893 --> 01:39:27.555]  I tell people to buy gold when it's down, and you don't listen to me.
[01:39:28.256 --> 01:39:28.876]  That's what I buy.
[01:39:29.997 --> 01:39:34.260]  And now it's skyrocketing, but Ted is selling it at the previous prices.
[01:39:35.141 --> 01:39:39.744]  And if I had the money, I just bought some gold, so I don't have the money to buy any more.
[01:39:40.625 --> 01:39:41.705]  I buy it in small amounts.
[01:39:42.266 --> 01:39:45.668]  But if I had the money, I would buy some of those that he just offered.
[01:39:45.728 --> 01:39:47.610]  But I did, two weeks ago, buy some gold.
[01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:50.752]  And now I've taken a receipt of it.
[01:39:52.977 --> 01:39:53.237]  686-2237.
[01:39:53.357 --> 01:39:55.639]  I mean, I believe in it.
[01:39:56.639 --> 01:40:05.605]  I believe in real things, not magic cures, and not super magic machines that heal you, and magic pyramids, and there's a lot of kooky stuff out there that charlatans are pushing.
[01:40:06.225 --> 01:40:09.928]  No, we just, hey, high-quality, made-in-America water filters.
[01:40:09.988 --> 01:40:10.888]  High-quality gold.
[01:40:12.369 --> 01:40:19.834]  You know, documentary films, books, and... It's all made in America, and it's all about
[01:40:20.996 --> 01:40:22.457]  Getting the truth out and telling the truth.
[01:40:22.597 --> 01:40:24.379]  And it's about protecting your assets, folks.
[01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:27.581]  So give them a call at 800-686-2237.
[01:40:27.701 --> 01:40:28.001]  Okay.
[01:40:29.262 --> 01:40:32.945]  Let me just now cut that off and refocus everybody.
[01:40:33.785 --> 01:40:35.286]  Kevin, who I'm going to go to, Kevin.
[01:40:35.486 --> 01:40:36.787]  And you seem angry at me.
[01:40:36.827 --> 01:40:39.569]  You seem a bit antagonistic and accusatory.
[01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:41.331]  And that's your right to do that.
[01:40:41.451 --> 01:40:44.973]  And I'm going to let you say whatever you want to me after I'm done saying this.
[01:40:48.916 --> 01:40:49.877]  I'm a macho person.
[01:40:51.932 --> 01:40:56.913]  Now, I'm the type of person that never, when I was younger, turned down a fight, even if somebody was twice my size.
[01:40:57.533 --> 01:40:59.294]  In fact, I instinctively enjoyed it.
[01:41:01.134 --> 01:41:12.957]  But as you get older, you realize that your mind, and fighting with your mind, and fighting with the pen, and fighting with the bullhorn, and fighting with the microphone, is more effective than fighting with a sword.
[01:41:14.758 --> 01:41:19.039]  It's like the old country song that I love so much.
[01:41:19.079 --> 01:41:20.579]  You've got to know when to hold them,
[01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:25.564]  Know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[01:41:27.205 --> 01:41:31.766]  And there's all these people, I mean I've heard them, I've heard the same callers for 12 years.
[01:41:34.587 --> 01:41:36.208]  Coming up on 12 years, 11 years.
[01:41:36.848 --> 01:41:45.871]  Calling in to the talk shows, we need to start killing them, we need to start shooting them, we need to start going after judges, we need to start, we need to start.
[01:41:46.431 --> 01:41:48.252]  The globalists would love that, folks.
[01:41:49.648 --> 01:42:14.282]  The globalists, we've caught them carrying out some of the bombings in Iraq against key groups to then get them to attack the other group to keep Bedlam and anarchy reigning so the globalists have an excuse to keep the military there, an excuse to build permanent bases and no centralized government really ever comes to power that can then make Iraq a strong nation so the oil will flow and then drive down prices.
[01:42:15.063 --> 01:42:17.104]  It's what we call the Goldfinger Effect.
[01:42:17.617 --> 01:42:25.983]  In that James Bond movie, where he's going to nuke the Fort Knox gold to make it radioactive to triple the prices of his gold.
[01:42:27.605 --> 01:42:29.886]  See, the globalists don't want the oil coming out of there.
[01:42:32.989 --> 01:42:34.770]  That's how they jack up the prices.
[01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:38.353]  They're all making record profits right now, and it's done through a cartel system.
[01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:42.272]  And these idiots go, those darn Arabs, they're a bunch of scum.
[01:42:42.553 --> 01:42:45.035]  And by and large, yeah, the Saudis are scum, the Saudi leadership.
[01:42:45.355 --> 01:42:46.797]  But, you know, they're ripping us off.
[01:42:46.837 --> 01:42:48.818]  Well, our government sets it with the cartels.
[01:42:49.219 --> 01:42:51.281]  I mean, the British made the deal and set up OPEC.
[01:42:51.661 --> 01:42:55.685]  Believe me, the Arabs get about 20% of the money and they do what they're told.
[01:42:56.605 --> 01:42:59.908]  When the globalists say, jump, they say, yes, boss, how high?
[01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:01.530]  But I'm digressing.
[01:43:02.751 --> 01:43:04.972]  The New World Order bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:43:05.052 --> 01:43:05.892]  We've totally caught them.
[01:43:05.952 --> 01:43:06.752]  I mean, that's public.
[01:43:07.032 --> 01:43:10.133]  The New World Order bombed Mosaddeq and blamed it on Mosaddeq.
[01:43:10.973 --> 01:43:12.334]  In 1953, in Iran.
[01:43:12.714 --> 01:43:16.415]  The New World Order attacked its own ship, the USS Liberty, to blame it on the Egyptians.
[01:43:17.375 --> 01:43:21.937]  The New World Order staged the Gulf of Tonkin attack that LBJ tapes have been released.
[01:43:21.997 --> 01:43:23.097]  He admits, never happened.
[01:43:25.988 --> 01:43:27.851]  So they need provocation.
[01:43:28.151 --> 01:43:37.383]  You think the globalists care if some of their Blackwater mercenaries or ISI mercenaries or Titan mercenaries got killed in New Orleans?
[01:43:37.884 --> 01:43:38.725]  They'd love it if...
[01:43:39.582 --> 01:43:44.144]  Twenty good ol' boys saddled up and went down there and engaged those guys.
[01:43:44.465 --> 01:43:45.925]  Then they'd really have an excuse.
[01:43:45.985 --> 01:43:46.265]  See?
[01:43:46.346 --> 01:43:46.606]  See?
[01:43:46.866 --> 01:43:47.846]  We need martial law.
[01:43:47.886 --> 01:43:48.066]  See?
[01:43:48.126 --> 01:43:48.267]  See?
[01:43:48.307 --> 01:43:49.007]  We need control.
[01:43:49.027 --> 01:44:00.173]  I mean, if you guys really want to do that, you've got to wait until they tackle more old ladies, or shoot old ladies, or pull off more Waco's, and push their agenda like the British did.
[01:44:00.713 --> 01:44:07.236]  We were going to lose a Revolutionary War in the first year, but the British just kept abusing people, kept massacring.
[01:44:09.446 --> 01:44:13.569]  And I hate to sit here and just coldly say this, but we're playing chess, folks.
[01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:15.451]  We're not playing checkers here.
[01:44:16.972 --> 01:44:22.957]  And if I thought that physically confronting somebody would defeat the New World Order, I would have done it a long time ago.
[01:44:23.277 --> 01:44:26.380]  That is not the way to go.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.381]  Now, we cannot turn loose of our guns.
[01:44:28.421 --> 01:44:31.364]  If we turn loose of our guns, they're going to win.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.206]  Because then, they went automatically.
[01:44:37.327 --> 01:44:39.513]  And then they can really oppress us and abuse us en masse.
[01:44:39.894 --> 01:44:42.080]  But there's 400 million guns in this country.
[01:44:42.601 --> 01:44:43.444]  They're not going to get them.
[01:44:44.887 --> 01:45:10.614]  They have to slowly kill the gun culture and slowly ratchet up the troops, where there's military bivouacs in every major neighborhood, not just city, where the police department is in the same building as the military, which is now happening, where the CIA has a local office, where they, quote, start fighting hate crimes, you know, and domestic violence, which they're now talking about, and the police search you at your bags at the shopping mall, which they're now talking about.
[01:45:10.834 --> 01:45:12.735]  They have to slowly put it all in place
[01:45:13.235 --> 01:45:18.737]  And then slowly start arresting dissidents, and slowly start shutting down websites, and you know what?
[01:45:19.017 --> 01:45:21.358]  Then at that point, it's going to blow up in their face.
[01:45:21.918 --> 01:45:23.879]  Everybody's starting to see what we're dealing with.
[01:45:24.079 --> 01:45:26.160]  People who never listened to me are listening to me now.
[01:45:27.182 --> 01:45:28.704]  Again, ten years ago they would laugh at me.
[01:45:28.965 --> 01:45:44.206]  Now I walk into the cleaners, there's already a state police about as high level as you get, that's all I can say, and he walks me outside with almost tears in his eyes and he goes, listen, we've learned about the takeover, we were taught this is what the communists would do, we know the truth about 9-11, I just want you to know that the leadership knows the truth.
[01:45:47.398 --> 01:45:53.923]  And this guy is, you know, very well known, and all these people have federal connections or were in the federal government previously, and they're upset.
[01:45:54.083 --> 01:45:56.165]  And you can't fake this type of being upset.
[01:45:56.365 --> 01:45:58.486]  They finally go, my God, this is true!
[01:45:59.327 --> 01:46:07.333]  So just let the New World Order, we'll keep waking people up, keep warning people, keep laying stores in, keep getting ready, and let them just keep moving.
[01:46:08.194 --> 01:46:09.094]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:46:09.595 --> 01:46:10.615]  They can't stop us.
[01:46:10.655 --> 01:46:11.476]  We're a sleeping giant.
[01:46:11.496 --> 01:46:13.137]  They could have 10 million foreign troops.
[01:46:13.337 --> 01:46:14.418]  We'll brush them aside.
[01:46:14.438 --> 01:46:16.760]  You understand that?
[01:46:17.729 --> 01:46:20.451]  Folks, there's nothing they can do in a guerrilla war.
[01:46:20.812 --> 01:46:23.574]  We have total superiority and total dominance.
[01:46:24.054 --> 01:46:26.816]  But again, we've got to let the troops wake up.
[01:46:26.876 --> 01:46:28.237]  We've got to let the military wake up.
[01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:29.458]  We've got to let the cops wake up.
[01:46:29.678 --> 01:46:31.780]  We've got to really let it come out in the open.
[01:46:33.244 --> 01:46:36.065]  And I wonder where you guys are going to be when it really starts.
[01:46:36.705 --> 01:46:38.645]  All the people that shot their mouths off.
[01:46:39.006 --> 01:46:40.006]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:46:40.466 --> 01:46:41.266]  I'm out in the open.
[01:46:41.366 --> 01:46:42.146]  I'm walking point.
[01:46:42.406 --> 01:46:43.367]  I'm right up front.
[01:46:43.907 --> 01:46:47.388]  I've been in the parking lot when the four thugs come up and say, shut your mouth.
[01:46:47.648 --> 01:46:49.108]  Don't talk about this anymore.
[01:46:49.288 --> 01:46:52.329]  And start breaking my nose and loosening my teeth.
[01:46:52.569 --> 01:46:54.750]  And I've had to buck up and take them on.
[01:46:55.230 --> 01:46:57.310]  I've had to buck up and hurt them bad.
[01:46:57.730 --> 01:46:59.851]  And you sit there and shoot your mouths off.
[01:47:00.422 --> 01:47:02.405]  I've had to get the death threats at 3 a.m.
[01:47:02.685 --> 01:47:04.848]  I've had to have the dead animals hung on my door.
[01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:08.833]  And you sit there shooting your mouth off when you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:47:09.534 --> 01:47:10.776]  Now let me give you the truth here.
[01:47:12.438 --> 01:47:15.763]  I've done a lot of research about it and I know who a lot of these feds are now.
[01:47:15.843 --> 01:47:16.624]  Let me tell you something.
[01:47:16.964 --> 01:47:18.046]  Here's rule number one.
[01:47:18.852 --> 01:47:21.513]  You're some good ol' boy shootin' their mouth off, they're probably not a fed.
[01:47:21.953 --> 01:47:32.198]  But the people on the radio who shoot their mouths off, and threaten the President, and threaten the police, and threaten judges, and don't get in trouble, they are feds, plain and simple.
[01:47:34.339 --> 01:47:43.063]  And the people that constantly bash the Jews, and call black people horrible names, I mean names I can't repeat here on air.
[01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.925]  You know, just unbelievable garbage.
[01:47:47.954 --> 01:47:49.776]  I guess we should just say what the stuff they say.
[01:47:50.156 --> 01:47:53.278]  People that do that, do that to make patriots look bad.
[01:47:53.559 --> 01:47:58.963]  These infiltrators come in, they take over, they talk about violence, they put racists on the air.
[01:48:00.544 --> 01:48:04.247]  You can criticize Israel for being racist themselves and being Zionist for being corrupt.
[01:48:04.527 --> 01:48:05.668]  They don't do that, folks.
[01:48:06.029 --> 01:48:11.313]  They get on there and call black people oyster-lipped baboons, okay?
[01:48:11.633 --> 01:48:12.494]  Stuff worse than that.
[01:48:13.445 --> 01:48:13.685]  Okay?
[01:48:13.705 --> 01:48:22.833]  And they get on there, and they do whatever they want, and they shoot their mouths off, and they turn everybody off, and it's people like that that can lose this war for us.
[01:48:23.073 --> 01:48:26.115]  And you listeners out there need to get more discernment.
[01:48:27.977 --> 01:48:35.443]  The other thing the feds do is they got their dissentful people out telling us the police state isn't that bad, and things aren't that bad, and I exaggerate, and this stuff isn't going on.
[01:48:35.623 --> 01:48:38.085]  Folks, we got the State Department attacking us now.
[01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.366]  You know, saying we're evil.
[01:48:39.586 --> 01:48:40.847]  You know, we're having an effect.
[01:48:42.173 --> 01:48:49.041]  Because we know the formula, and it's called the truth, and it's called including everybody, and it's called love.
[01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:55.369]  Loving your family enough that you're willing to die for them against this new world order, but not shooting your mouth off.
[01:48:56.337 --> 01:48:58.779]  You know, let's get a militia up and go down there in New Orleans.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.301]  You try to go get a militia up.
[01:49:00.561 --> 01:49:07.228]  Your first meeting that you advertise, half the people showing up are going to be feds, and they're going to go, yeah, we ought to go out and do something violent.
[01:49:07.448 --> 01:49:17.618]  And the minute you say that, they're going to take you down in the parking lot, boy, and you're going to be in a prison with some guy named Bubba raping you and giving you HIV and hepatitis.
[01:49:22.961 --> 01:49:26.024]  So you need to be, frankly, shooting your mouth off at me.
[01:49:26.064 --> 01:49:27.785]  I'm getting a little bit angry at you as I talk about it.
[01:49:28.025 --> 01:49:29.807]  You don't know how much danger you're in, Kevin.
[01:49:30.527 --> 01:49:32.149]  And to say, well, God will protect me.
[01:49:32.549 --> 01:49:34.711]  Hey, God, God does protect people.
[01:49:36.372 --> 01:49:38.914]  But you can't ever count on that.
[01:49:39.074 --> 01:49:40.355]  God does what God wants to do.
[01:49:41.476 --> 01:49:45.319]  And the old saying, you know, is trust in God but tie up your camel.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.021]  You know, the old Bedouin saying.
[01:49:47.301 --> 01:49:48.742]  God doesn't protect fools.
[01:49:49.162 --> 01:49:49.763]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.719 --> 01:49:57.560]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.400]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.741 --> 01:50:04.402]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.762 --> 01:50:09.184]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:13.765]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.005 --> 01:50:16.846]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.946 --> 01:50:21.587]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.807 --> 01:50:26.228]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.448 --> 01:50:33.669]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.929 --> 01:50:36.350]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:03.565]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[01:51:14.373 --> 01:51:18.717]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.917 --> 01:51:27.239]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.539 --> 01:51:33.901]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:34.001 --> 01:51:38.482]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:48.325 --> 01:51:48.645]  I think so.
[01:52:10.703 --> 01:52:11.304]  I think so.
[01:52:30.964 --> 01:52:31.364]  I think so.
[01:52:55.911 --> 01:53:01.935]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.536 --> 01:53:05.498]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.719 --> 01:53:14.885]  You'd think the federal government would just march Mexican and Dutch troops in here and say they're here to take your guns.
[01:53:14.965 --> 01:53:16.626]  No, they'd do it under some cover.
[01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:26.416]  They signed the deals to bring in foreign troops to quote deal with American terrorists and for disasters two-and-a-half years ago.
[01:53:27.076 --> 01:53:29.338]  The deals were being negotiated three-and-a-half years ago.
[01:53:29.598 --> 01:53:30.778]  I put it in road to tyranny.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.641]  And now you see it manifesting.
[01:53:36.382 --> 01:53:44.086]  Now they got Blackwater security and the rest of those goons out there manhandling families doing just ungodly things and it makes my blood boil.
[01:53:46.828 --> 01:53:47.388]  But uh...
[01:53:48.172 --> 01:53:51.393]  He who laughs last wins, folks.
[01:53:52.093 --> 01:53:53.014]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:53:53.574 --> 01:53:57.355]  But we're not going to win it shooting our mouths off and running around.
[01:53:58.875 --> 01:54:00.896]  I see good people like Kevin who mean well.
[01:54:01.016 --> 01:54:01.956]  Kevin's ready to fight.
[01:54:02.977 --> 01:54:06.978]  If Kevin was propagandized in another way, he'd be ready to go off and die in Iraq fighting.
[01:54:07.498 --> 01:54:08.319]  He means well.
[01:54:10.859 --> 01:54:13.540]  Please don't chastise me, Kevin, and tell me I haven't done enough.
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.681]  Please don't imply I'm bad.
[01:54:16.736 --> 01:54:18.097]  I've done as much as I can.
[01:54:18.117 --> 01:54:20.278]  I've thought about the best way to handle this.
[01:54:20.358 --> 01:54:26.861]  I've dealt with things in adversity and in trials and tribulations that you don't know anything about.
[01:54:29.402 --> 01:54:30.903]  I try to stay focused on myself.
[01:54:34.145 --> 01:54:36.206]  The people have to know who the enemy is first.
[01:54:36.226 --> 01:54:37.586]  They have to know this is not our government.
[01:54:37.886 --> 01:54:40.687]  The patriotism is not worshipping men in black masks.
[01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:44.588]  The patriotism is not worshipping an out-of-control government that's abusing you.
[01:54:44.789 --> 01:54:51.711]  But we have to educate people first about how they're being abused as the founding fathers did for a full decade before 1775.
[01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:55.252]  And the founding fathers didn't start that.
[01:54:56.412 --> 01:55:01.034]  Look, if it starts, if that's what God wants, if a war starts,
[01:55:02.023 --> 01:55:07.488]  Because they keep coming in trying to confiscate guns, then so be it.
[01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:12.332]  I mean, there were firefights where it wasn't just the military shooting dogs.
[01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:14.633]  We know they were going into houses killing people.
[01:55:15.114 --> 01:55:16.595]  We know that there were people fighting back.
[01:55:16.635 --> 01:55:21.139]  We know that now from sources inside the military and from fragments of news in the press.
[01:55:23.015 --> 01:55:30.679]  And then you notice real quick, they said, okay, we're canceling it, okay, we're not taking guns anymore, and they're still selectively doing it, but they're being more sneaky about it.
[01:55:30.879 --> 01:55:32.520]  It's because they can't get away with it!
[01:55:34.321 --> 01:55:39.504]  And we need to use this, and never shut up about it, and expose it, and use the people they killed against them.
[01:55:40.005 --> 01:55:42.326]  Who did die as great patriots against this tyranny.
[01:55:43.399 --> 01:55:49.601]  And that poor lawyer who shot his mouth off and said, I'm waiting on you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna shoot you if you come to my door.
[01:55:49.821 --> 01:55:52.601]  Well the SWAT teams all said, that's a challenge, we can't not take that.
[01:55:52.862 --> 01:55:55.422]  We gotta let the enemy, we gotta dominate the enemy.
[01:55:55.482 --> 01:55:56.863]  This is psychological warfare.
[01:55:57.063 --> 01:55:58.343]  We gotta let them know they're conquered.
[01:55:58.703 --> 01:55:59.583]  He stuck his head up.
[01:55:59.863 --> 01:56:02.324]  They all ran over there and did Lord knows what.
[01:56:02.344 --> 01:56:04.065]  We don't know the details, but they got him.
[01:56:06.685 --> 01:56:09.186]  Now again, if he was really gonna do stuff, then he shouldn't have shot his mouth off.
[01:56:12.128 --> 01:56:13.591]  And then it would have been a different situation.
[01:56:16.779 --> 01:56:17.120]  Oh yeah.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:19.104]  It would have been a real different situation.
[01:56:20.949 --> 01:56:21.209]  So...
[01:56:22.714 --> 01:56:23.694]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:56:23.714 --> 01:56:25.995]  You know, I'd rather wake up those military men and women.
[01:56:26.095 --> 01:56:28.196]  I'd rather wake up our police.
[01:56:28.336 --> 01:56:29.196]  And we are doing it.
[01:56:29.216 --> 01:56:30.016]  We're having an effect.
[01:56:30.176 --> 01:56:37.539]  And that's why the globalists are trying to get a police state going and get the martial law going now, because they know we're kicking their rear ends.
[01:56:37.839 --> 01:56:41.760]  With the help of God, we are bringing in mighty harvest right now.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.941]  I've never seen people waking up like this.
[01:56:44.541 --> 01:56:46.042]  Now let's go back to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:56:46.062 --> 01:56:46.942]  Kevin, you can respond.
[01:56:47.512 --> 01:56:48.312]  Thank God!
[01:56:48.553 --> 01:56:50.554]  I've only had to wait about 10 minutes.
[01:56:50.754 --> 01:56:52.695]  Okay, you mean let me go or you got a comment?
[01:56:52.735 --> 01:56:53.215]  No sir!
[01:56:53.415 --> 01:56:54.656]  No sir, please call it to me.
[01:56:55.316 --> 01:56:58.778]  I have more respect for you Mr. Jones than you would ever know, okay?
[01:56:59.378 --> 01:57:06.743]  I have severed relationships over the information that you have come out and that I have researched, okay?
[01:57:06.983 --> 01:57:08.243]  So I'm on your side.
[01:57:08.664 --> 01:57:13.046]  And yes, I do come on here and shoot my mouth off, but I can't!
[01:57:13.646 --> 01:57:15.827]  Because there's nobody that's going to stop me.
[01:57:16.147 --> 01:57:21.909]  Because, just like you say, federal agents know about 9-11 and know all this is really going on.
[01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:24.009]  You think they care if I'm on here saying this?
[01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:28.271]  Well, some of them, yeah, you bet, you bet.
[01:57:28.511 --> 01:57:30.412]  They'll order them to come after you, buddy.
[01:57:31.112 --> 01:57:31.772]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.773 --> 01:57:38.074]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:43.874 --> 01:57:50.358]  The Big Brother.
[01:57:50.998 --> 01:57:52.079]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.900]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:55.361]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.102 --> 01:57:57.002]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.022 --> 01:58:01.645]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.845 --> 01:58:05.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:13.524]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[01:58:13.544 --> 01:58:14.304]  We're here live.
[01:58:14.324 --> 01:58:18.125]  And of course we're back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:58:18.565 --> 01:58:20.485]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:20.505 --> 01:58:23.026]  The Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[01:58:23.066 --> 01:58:26.306]  A lot of people like to pose who aren't affiliated with this network.
[01:58:26.346 --> 01:58:28.067]  They like to imply they're affiliated with it.
[01:58:28.347 --> 01:58:30.867]  They like to ride on our coattails fighting the New World Order.
[01:58:31.828 --> 01:58:35.688]  Like to garner support that people try to direct at us, to themselves.
[01:58:36.049 --> 01:58:37.789]  We are not affiliated with those individuals.
[01:58:39.382 --> 01:58:52.909]  We are, right now, talking to Kevin in Alabama, for stations that just joined us, who in the last hour said it's time to get a posse together, basically, and go down there and engage the troops and police.
[01:58:53.289 --> 01:59:04.674]  Number one, most of the troops and police are being acclimated and are being conditioned and are watching as the already acclimated SWAT teams are led by the FBI and BATF to do this.
[01:59:05.375 --> 01:59:07.195]  They're being conditioned to work with foreign troops.
[01:59:07.235 --> 01:59:08.236]  That's on the news.
[01:59:08.886 --> 01:59:14.129]  So number one, most of these people down there are not legitimate military targets.
[01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.851]  Okay?
[01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:17.171]  That's number one.
[01:59:17.712 --> 01:59:19.373]  Most of them are not traitors yet.
[01:59:19.633 --> 01:59:21.634]  They're being bathed in evil right now.
[01:59:22.795 --> 01:59:25.096]  The word is bathed, or basted.
[01:59:25.677 --> 01:59:27.418]  They're being forged right now.
[01:59:28.298 --> 01:59:29.879]  They're being twisted right now.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.181]  Twisted to the Dark Lord's aims.
[01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:40.332]  Okay, that's why it's important to intensify our info war with the truth that smashes their mountains of lies that literally lays waste to them.
[01:59:41.272 --> 01:59:45.733]  Alright, finish up Kevin quickly because I've got to go to John and Jeremy and Clayton and I've got Paul Watson coming up later.
[01:59:45.753 --> 01:59:47.193]  Go ahead and get Watson on the line.
[01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:48.073]  Go ahead.
[01:59:48.573 --> 01:59:50.474]  I didn't say engage anybody.
[01:59:50.674 --> 02:00:01.476]  If there was 5 million American people on the outskirts of New Orleans and if they all said leave and didn't point no guns, do you think they'd stay or go Mr. Jones?
[02:00:02.955 --> 02:00:03.215]  Huh?
[02:00:04.256 --> 02:00:06.237]  I didn't say point a gun at nobody, did I?
[02:00:06.337 --> 02:00:07.877]  I didn't say point a gun, did I?
[02:00:08.058 --> 02:00:09.918]  Either way, now you're screaming.
[02:00:09.938 --> 02:00:11.839]  Well, sir, what you said is... You made me mad, dude.
[02:00:11.879 --> 02:00:12.880]  You won't let me talk.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.641]  You'll talk for 15 minutes and give me 30 seconds.
[02:00:15.721 --> 02:00:16.382]  You're screaming.
[02:00:16.902 --> 02:00:18.363]  Yeah, you're pissing me off, man.
[02:00:18.543 --> 02:00:19.323]  Alright, put him on hold.
[02:00:19.963 --> 02:00:22.605]  Look, we're not going to sit here and have that type of stuff go on.
[02:00:24.106 --> 02:00:26.827]  I don't know why you're so emotional and why you're so angry at me.
[02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:30.949]  You did say we need to get a militia together.
[02:00:31.579 --> 02:00:31.939]  Censoring me, man.
[02:00:31.959 --> 02:00:33.000]  You're censoring me too much.
[02:00:59.893 --> 02:01:06.038]  No, censoring is if the government came and stopped you from making phone calls or publishing a newspaper.
[02:01:06.518 --> 02:01:06.798]  Sir!
[02:01:07.098 --> 02:01:08.820]  I've had you on three segments, Kevin!
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:11.221]  I know, but you won't let me say nothing!
[02:01:11.321 --> 02:01:14.624]  I tell you what, are we able in the middle of recording to go back
[02:01:15.302 --> 02:01:17.464]  And to actually get what he said and re-air it?
[02:01:17.484 --> 02:01:17.544]  Yes.
[02:01:17.804 --> 02:01:18.405]  Please do.
[02:01:18.705 --> 02:01:19.866]  If I ever said that.
[02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:23.909]  Confronting and attacking is two different things, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:23.929 --> 02:01:29.394]  Well, number one, I just told you three times, Kevin, that I'm talking about what other people on the radio have said.
[02:01:29.674 --> 02:01:30.995]  What other callers have said.
[02:01:31.475 --> 02:01:32.376]  Okay, I'm done with you.
[02:01:32.676 --> 02:01:33.217]  I'm done with you.
[02:01:33.477 --> 02:01:35.839]  Listen, you can hate me and dislike me if you want.
[02:01:35.899 --> 02:01:36.640]  I don't think you do.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.142]  You need to not get so angry at me.
[02:01:39.842 --> 02:01:41.763]  And I'm done, Kevin, okay?
[02:01:41.943 --> 02:01:44.243]  You're welcome to call back on another day when you've cooled down a little bit.
[02:01:44.763 --> 02:01:49.405]  I clearly was talking about everyone out there.
[02:01:50.445 --> 02:01:57.327]  You know, the people that shoot their mouths off, the people that mean well, the people that are feds, the people that are provocateurs.
[02:01:57.367 --> 02:01:59.047]  I was talking about the gamut.
[02:01:59.728 --> 02:02:00.448]  The gamut.
[02:02:00.948 --> 02:02:04.729]  You know, the entire panopticon of individuals.
[02:02:06.832 --> 02:02:07.812]  We'll get Paul Watson on.
[02:02:07.852 --> 02:02:09.534]  We'll get to your calls early in the show.
[02:02:10.234 --> 02:02:11.555]  Everybody that's patiently holding.
[02:02:12.135 --> 02:02:13.196]  We're into the Iraq War.
[02:02:13.216 --> 02:02:13.957]  All these bombings.
[02:02:14.397 --> 02:02:15.758]  What really happened in New Orleans.
[02:02:15.778 --> 02:02:16.679]  What's unfolding there.
[02:02:17.939 --> 02:02:18.740]  And so much more.

[02:02:46.316 --> 02:02:49.220]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.918 --> 02:02:51.200]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:02:57.428 --> 02:03:02.695]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:02.976 --> 02:03:04.598]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:03:04.718 --> 02:03:07.121]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:11.065]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.345 --> 02:03:15.971]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.071 --> 02:03:22.318]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.378 --> 02:03:24.200]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:42.396 --> 02:03:44.478]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:47.074 --> 02:03:48.115]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.436 --> 02:03:51.219]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:55.645]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.085 --> 02:03:56.907]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.227 --> 02:04:01.793]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.273 --> 02:04:04.394]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:48.063 --> 02:04:51.904]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:52.224 --> 02:04:53.044]  Read the labels.
[02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:57.606]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.826 --> 02:05:02.007]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:02.387 --> 02:05:07.249]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:07.649 --> 02:05:11.192]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:05:45.431 --> 02:05:51.052]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.693 --> 02:06:01.734]  Look, I don't want to spend all day on this, because we've got a lot of news to cover, and Paul Watson joins us, and I do want to take your calls.
[02:06:03.146 --> 02:06:04.507]  But I called Kevin in Alabama.
[02:06:04.567 --> 02:06:05.468]  I'm sure he's a great guy.
[02:06:05.488 --> 02:06:10.551]  He called in and talked about how he was going to shoot a bunch of people if they tried to come to his house.
[02:06:11.152 --> 02:06:14.714]  And he talked about getting militia together in that same context and going down to New Orleans.
[02:06:15.235 --> 02:06:21.719]  And I talked about the different feds and people who are allowed to talk like that from their talk shows or from their websites and how they are feds.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:26.703]  How we have clear evidence of them setting up militia people in the past and doing all of this.
[02:06:27.103 --> 02:06:29.385]  And how I've just faced it and been researching it lately.
[02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:34.432]  And then he wanted to just, I guess, try to imply I was saying that about him, and no, I wasn't.
[02:06:35.112 --> 02:06:42.837]  But you clearly were, sir, talking about taking up arms, and my point was, is that that'll blow up in our face and that'll help the globalists.
[02:06:43.297 --> 02:06:52.283]  So here's about a two or three minute clip of this, because he was denying he was saying this, and I don't want to get in a fight with you, sir, just please don't make claims that, you know, you can't back up.
[02:06:52.883 --> 02:06:55.405]  And then we'll go to Paul Watson, then we'll go to all these callers that are
[02:06:56.727 --> 02:07:02.972]  Please let them guys come to my house and try to come up in here, because I'm going to shoot every one of them.
[02:07:02.992 --> 02:07:04.233]  And I don't care.
[02:07:04.293 --> 02:07:05.234]  I'm full of Waco, Texas up in here.
[02:07:05.254 --> 02:07:06.835]  I don't care, Mr. Jones.
[02:07:19.269 --> 02:07:25.017]  I plan on being at your Alamo Theater convention thing for your Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:25.358 --> 02:07:26.780]  You think I can talk to the audience?
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:37.502]  Well, you know, we've only got the theater for about two and a half hours, and so I'll speak for about 10-15 minutes and then play the documentary.
[02:07:38.003 --> 02:07:39.723]  That's coming up the 9th and the 10th.
[02:07:40.043 --> 02:07:46.425]  We'll have one showing downtown in October on that Sunday and then one showing on Monday night at the South Lamar.
[02:07:46.465 --> 02:07:50.086]  They wanted me to have more showings, but I just don't have the time or the energy.
[02:07:50.426 --> 02:07:53.167]  I'm working on other films right now and doing so much other stuff.
[02:07:53.767 --> 02:07:58.511]  We could obviously have ten showings and sell them all out.
[02:07:58.551 --> 02:08:00.833]  I'm sure you can talk to people when you're out in the hall.
[02:08:01.273 --> 02:08:03.094]  You can talk to people when you're in the foyer.
[02:08:03.114 --> 02:08:07.618]  This is an interesting phone call.
[02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:12.405]  I think that you've gotten complacent in your mission, okay?
[02:08:12.445 --> 02:08:13.806]  You have gotten complacent.
[02:08:13.906 --> 02:08:16.609]  All you want to do is report, report, report, report, report.
[02:08:16.649 --> 02:08:18.271]  We've got to start doing something, man.
[02:08:18.391 --> 02:08:21.715]  I'm talking physically doing something, Mr. Jones.
[02:08:22.115 --> 02:08:22.656]  Take it to the state.
[02:08:22.716 --> 02:08:23.677]  Take it to the huge state.
[02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:28.031]  Alabama's a big state.
[02:08:28.272 --> 02:08:36.619]  Let's get a freaking militia up and we'll go to New Orleans and we will run everybody out of there, Mr. Jones.
[02:08:36.699 --> 02:08:38.240]  Why don't you comprehend that?
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.542]  Why can't you get your head around that?
[02:08:40.862 --> 02:08:41.663]  We can do it.
[02:08:41.863 --> 02:08:42.944]  You're sitting here telling me.
[02:08:43.444 --> 02:08:44.665]  Every week I listen to you.
[02:08:44.746 --> 02:08:45.726]  Every night you're telling me.
[02:08:46.007 --> 02:08:46.707]  Come on, man.
[02:08:46.727 --> 02:08:47.468]  We gotta do something.
[02:08:47.508 --> 02:08:48.209]  We gotta do something.
[02:08:48.249 --> 02:08:48.849]  We gotta do something.
[02:08:48.889 --> 02:08:49.430]  Well, come on.
[02:08:49.450 --> 02:08:50.330]  Let's go do something.
[02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:52.552]  Well, Kevin, let me just say something here briefly, please.
[02:08:53.093 --> 02:08:53.333]  Okay.
[02:08:55.217 --> 02:09:06.763]  I've been doing this for coming up on 12 years and I've seen scores of people who shoot their mouths off about how they're Billy Bad Butt and how they're going to go shoot people who end up in the federal pen.
[02:09:07.363 --> 02:09:11.125]  Then I've watched other people... God ain't going to put me in a federal pen, Mr. Jones.
[02:09:11.145 --> 02:09:12.606]  Put him on hold for a second.
[02:09:12.646 --> 02:09:13.666]  Put him on hold for a second.
[02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:15.407]  Okay, folks.
[02:09:16.368 --> 02:09:22.951]  Now notice, I just said I've known scores of people and then I go into other talk show hosts and then he thinks I'm talking about him.
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:28.041]  Though he did pretty much say what then he accused me of saying he said.
[02:09:29.341 --> 02:09:32.342]  Again, folks, it isn't about Alex Jones or Kevin from Alabama.
[02:09:32.382 --> 02:09:35.223]  It's about the New World Order and how best to deal with it.
[02:09:35.563 --> 02:09:40.284]  Paul Watson, do you want to talk about this phenomenon?
[02:09:40.324 --> 02:09:42.664]  People who email us every day saying we need to get violent.
[02:09:43.064 --> 02:09:44.645]  But I just hear them year after year saying it.
[02:09:44.745 --> 02:09:46.065]  I don't see them out getting violent.
[02:09:46.913 --> 02:09:47.933]  You want to comment on that, Paul?
[02:09:47.973 --> 02:09:50.354]  I mean, Mahatma Gandhi knew what he was doing.
[02:09:50.374 --> 02:09:55.675]  I don't follow his religion, but I do follow some of his non-violence to a certain point.
[02:09:55.715 --> 02:09:58.355]  Then in pure life and limb defense, you're in the right.
[02:09:59.156 --> 02:10:00.056]  People know the truth.
[02:10:00.076 --> 02:10:02.556]  You then can defend yourself with deadly force.
[02:10:03.256 --> 02:10:04.017]  And I believe in that.
[02:10:04.217 --> 02:10:08.437]  But I mean, he said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:10:08.797 --> 02:10:09.958]  We're at the winning point.
[02:10:09.998 --> 02:10:11.858]  We've got the State Department attacking us, Paul.
[02:10:12.378 --> 02:10:13.738]  I mean, we're at the winning point.
[02:10:13.758 --> 02:10:15.059]  We've got ADL attacking us.
[02:10:15.379 --> 02:10:16.319]  We're at the winning point.
[02:10:16.929 --> 02:10:17.689]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:21.892]  Well, I mean, wouldn't it just be playing into their hands?
[02:10:22.292 --> 02:10:26.395]  I mean, if you had an organization like that, it would obviously be disorganized.
[02:10:27.275 --> 02:10:33.779]  It would be crushed, and then the media would have a field day demonizing anyone who opposes the Feds as crazy killers.
[02:10:35.561 --> 02:10:46.194]  Obviously you have the right to defend your own property and your own family but anything like some kind of militia movement has to happen organically as it did in the past.
[02:10:46.454 --> 02:10:53.403]  So you need to look at the lessons of the past and realize that things are a lot more sophisticated nowadays which is why
[02:10:54.167 --> 02:11:03.793]  The only way this can happen is a governor seizing control, calling out the militia, saying the feds are traitors, calling for other states to join him, and doing it that way.
[02:11:03.813 --> 02:11:06.354]  We need to get Ron Paul to be governor of Texas to secede.
[02:11:06.734 --> 02:11:08.215]  And I'm not joking about that, folks.
[02:11:08.556 --> 02:11:11.057]  We have to secede and then reform the Union again.
[02:11:11.077 --> 02:11:15.560]  That's what we were commanded to do, not our right, our duty, by the Founding Fathers.
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:22.704]  And for police that are laughing, you haven't read the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, you know nothing
[02:11:22.944 --> 02:11:25.105]  I don't know about your heritage, that's why you're stupid slaves.
[02:11:25.645 --> 02:11:31.827]  But, bottom line, we have hundreds of cities throwing out the Patriot Act.
[02:11:32.287 --> 02:11:33.207]  Six states doing it.
[02:11:33.828 --> 02:11:35.508]  We have Arizona ready to secede.
[02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:39.790]  A week before 9-11, New Hampshire was about to secede.
[02:11:40.050 --> 02:11:41.270]  They'd gotten the votes to do it.
[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:52.334]  We're on the edge of the victory, but the problem is they're going to have a fake secession run by the Lurican Quistas,
[02:11:53.462 --> 02:12:06.028]  In the next 10 years, in the Southwest, so the globalists are actually fomenting revolution to then redirect those energies into a false breakup of America and a recongealment into the Pan-American Union.
[02:12:06.068 --> 02:12:09.149]  This is the full, forward-looking version of what we're dealing with, Paul.
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:16.462]  Well yeah, that's why I said it has to happen organically, because that's exactly what you had with the Bolsheviks and the French Revolution.
[02:12:16.502 --> 02:12:22.949]  It turned out that the revolutionaries were just squabbling with the other statists for control of the country.
[02:12:22.969 --> 02:12:26.432]  It wasn't about freedom, which is why it has to happen organically.
[02:12:26.852 --> 02:12:28.634]  Obviously there are lines in the sand.
[02:12:29.555 --> 02:12:33.119]  Forcible injection of microchips for everyone, not just criminals.
[02:12:33.699 --> 02:12:39.902]  That's a line in the sand, and it's a line that many people won't allow to be crossed, and they'll have their own ways of dealing with it.
[02:12:39.942 --> 02:12:49.608]  So, these benchmarks are clear as to what point people stop putting up with it in a non-violent sense, but your website is called Infowars.com for a reason.
[02:12:49.648 --> 02:12:51.248]  It's about information warfare.
[02:12:52.389 --> 02:12:52.889]  H.G.
[02:12:52.929 --> 02:13:00.333]  Wells said the 20th and 21st centuries would be about the battle for men's minds, not their bodies, and that's exactly what it's about.
[02:13:00.393 --> 02:13:01.554]  It's more sophisticated.
[02:13:02.114 --> 02:13:10.357]  And they're getting desperate, and they're the ones moving physically, so us moving peacefully can only reflect that we're the good guys.
[02:13:11.537 --> 02:13:13.118]  It's always darkest before the dawn.
[02:13:13.178 --> 02:13:14.598]  We are creaming them.
[02:13:15.338 --> 02:13:17.439]  I mean, we are smashing them right now.
[02:13:19.299 --> 02:13:29.843]  Well, yeah, and you can look at the poll numbers, you can look at the hits to our website, the hits to other alternative news websites which have just ballooned over the past few years, since 9-11.
[02:13:30.996 --> 02:13:32.798]  We are winning that information war.
[02:13:32.818 --> 02:13:37.943]  The internet is the frontier of, if you want to call it the revolution, or the restoration.
[02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:44.408]  Well, definitely it's the vanguard, and as they move to block that, it only wakes more people up.
[02:13:44.749 --> 02:13:46.631]  I mean, everybody I know is waking up.
[02:13:47.111 --> 02:13:48.612]  Police, military, you name it.
[02:13:49.013 --> 02:13:50.474]  I mean, they're losing control.
[02:13:50.554 --> 02:13:53.237]  By doing this, they're going to lose.
[02:13:53.277 --> 02:13:54.318]  They can nuke cities.
[02:13:54.598 --> 02:13:55.539]  It's not going to work, Paul.
[02:13:57.512 --> 02:13:58.134]  Well, exactly.
[02:13:58.174 --> 02:14:07.494]  I mean, if you look at the statements that these people have made in light of this hurricane, then you can see that they are being ruled by their own inflated egos.
[02:14:08.348 --> 02:14:20.291]  But at the core of that, as Karl Rove said, they create their own reality and live in their own world in which their own mistakes don't exist, which is why they never admit to any mistakes.
[02:14:21.651 --> 02:14:24.692]  But they're taking into account, thinking that we're going to buy it.
[02:14:25.192 --> 02:14:28.913]  If we see what a delusional fraud that is, that just makes them lunatics.
[02:14:30.313 --> 02:14:34.814]  Exactly, and anyone with an ounce of common sense can see that, which is why they're getting more and more desperate.
[02:14:35.516 --> 02:14:38.879]  Well, I mean, they're prancing around saying they control reality.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:43.102]  Well, that's complete delusion, and it's another benchmark.
[02:14:43.202 --> 02:14:45.124]  I mean, Richard Perl's saying, you're next.
[02:14:45.684 --> 02:14:49.527]  You know, we're going to attack you, and then their whole system's falling apart.
[02:14:50.468 --> 02:14:54.731]  Well, I mean, that's what the neocons were known as back in the 80s, the crazies.
[02:14:55.292 --> 02:14:56.973]  And they're the people in control now.
[02:14:58.213 --> 02:15:04.137]  And again, because they're yes-men for the Rothschilds and others that are just, our plan's behind schedule, do it, do it!
[02:15:04.797 --> 02:15:07.639]  And so they're just, they're telling him, we can do it, we can do it!
[02:15:07.879 --> 02:15:16.324]  And they're desperately giving false reports to their bosses, Bush is giving false reports to his bosses, and ah, let them believe their own propaganda!
[02:15:18.206 --> 02:15:23.609]  Exactly, but I mean what they've created with Katrina, or Karina as Laura Bush calls it,
[02:15:24.898 --> 02:15:25.879]  Is the pretext.
[02:15:25.939 --> 02:15:29.401]  When a disaster takes place, whether natural or man-made, you have no rights.
[02:15:29.442 --> 02:15:32.704]  The federal government can arrest you if you don't follow their every order.
[02:15:33.464 --> 02:15:36.547]  And that goes for the mandatory evacuation and the gun confiscation.
[02:15:36.627 --> 02:15:44.393]  And they already had this illegitimate power claimed to themselves, but they need to now legitimize it and claim it as a new power after the fact.
[02:15:46.074 --> 02:15:46.534]  Exactly.
[02:15:46.734 --> 02:15:51.558]  And they are shifting tactics somewhat, because people can see a police state for what it is.
[02:15:52.375 --> 02:16:06.828]  Which is why, as others have pointed out, they're going to be more successful in the long term by privatizing the police state, which means, in the case of New Orleans, hiring out these Blackwater security thugs to do their dirty work for them.
[02:16:06.888 --> 02:16:13.714]  And ISI, I was reading in the AP, you need to add this to that article you're putting together, Paul, they actually have Israeli troops in New Orleans.
[02:16:15.155 --> 02:16:17.737]  It's hidden in plain view, but oh, they're private now.
[02:16:18.318 --> 02:16:19.419]  So that makes it okay.
[02:16:20.447 --> 02:16:21.588]  Yeah, that makes it okay.
[02:16:21.908 --> 02:16:26.672]  Having the foreign mercenary there to help police Americans, that's the pretext that's been set.
[02:16:26.933 --> 02:16:35.940]  Because, because FEMA didn't go in, the police didn't go in, because FEMA was jamming communications, and cutting off the food and water, didn't go in and deal with a few drug members.
[02:16:36.761 --> 02:16:38.903]  I mean, it's just, you know, the gang member idiots.
[02:16:38.963 --> 02:16:44.568]  I mean, they let it fall apart on purpose, point a camera at it, and then, oh look, we gotta take your lives over now.
[02:16:44.928 --> 02:16:47.871]  Here's some nice Dutch, Mexican, and Israelis.
[02:16:48.991 --> 02:17:00.845]  It's a very simple technique and the New York Times admitted that only the people with the security squads that they had hired, the wealthier residents, were allowed to keep their guns.
[02:17:01.345 --> 02:17:09.695]  Which of course was totally misleading because 99% of the thugs that were hired were hired by the federal government to kick in doors, grab guns, and drag old ladies in.
[02:17:09.775 --> 02:17:25.389]  And for those who don't understand, when they say that, they mean billionaires that live in New Orleans, congressmen, this has been in the news, when they say they're discarding, in fact they're at a billionaire's house using it as a base under his authorization, Blackwater is.
[02:17:25.729 --> 02:17:26.250]  No, no, no.
[02:17:27.371 --> 02:17:30.594]  People with million dollar houses are being drug out by their hair.
[02:17:32.702 --> 02:17:37.343]  So notice how that's carefully played to make middle class think, oh, I'll be okay during this.
[02:17:37.824 --> 02:17:41.025]  Not unless you're worth a million bucks and own stock in Blackwater.
[02:17:41.305 --> 02:17:41.985]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.646 --> 02:17:48.947]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[02:17:49.507 --> 02:17:51.928]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[02:19:46.359 --> 02:19:48.839]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:58.062]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts, number one and two, is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:59.068 --> 02:20:03.989]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:20:05.069 --> 02:20:06.890]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:08.110]  There may be more.

[02:20:47.242 --> 02:20:49.664]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[02:20:49.904 --> 02:20:52.707]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[02:20:53.047 --> 02:20:57.070]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[02:20:57.310 --> 02:21:06.598]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[02:21:06.898 --> 02:21:11.820]  Because Zango is made from the whole Mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:16.041]  Loaded with Danzones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[02:21:16.181 --> 02:21:24.064]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.

[02:21:46.194 --> 02:21:52.797]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.266 --> 02:21:59.747]  Waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:22:00.127 --> 02:22:02.708]  I know John and Jeremy and Clayton and Tim are all holding patiently.
[02:22:03.148 --> 02:22:06.229]  Paul, let's go to some calls here, but what are some of the other news items you want to cover?
[02:22:06.489 --> 02:22:16.651]  You've got a round-up story, just all the basics and details of what's happened in New Orleans, from many different angles, going to go up here in the next hour or so, as soon as you're off air with us.
[02:22:17.351 --> 02:22:18.632]  Tell us about some of what's coming up.
[02:22:21.112 --> 02:22:34.144]  Well, it basically ties into the fact that as Katrina was unfolding and the biggest danger that we could see was government incompetence at the very least and malevolence at the worst.
[02:22:34.505 --> 02:22:43.293]  That is the real threat, it always has been, yet we're presented on a daily basis with all these other fake threats like the Adam Perlman
[02:22:44.145 --> 02:22:46.706]  Well, I know you're writing that Roundup article.
[02:22:46.746 --> 02:22:48.707]  You and I have been working on it today.
[02:23:12.293 --> 02:23:13.613]  You're doing a lion's share of the work.
[02:23:13.754 --> 02:23:19.595]  Be sure and dig out the news articles where they reported the last three nights all the machine gun fire all night long.
[02:23:20.836 --> 02:23:25.237]  Because a lot of that is killing dogs, but some of that is shootouts with people in houses.
[02:23:26.018 --> 02:23:32.800]  Obviously some of that's going to be criminal, but the intel I'm getting from sources on the ground is that they are having some shootouts with gun owners.
[02:23:33.633 --> 02:23:37.320]  And then now they're trying to back off and going, okay, we're going to let people come back in the city.
[02:23:37.641 --> 02:23:40.246]  Stuff wasn't as bad as we said and we're not going to take your guns.
[02:23:40.707 --> 02:23:42.791]  But then they report, okay, we're still going to take your guns.
[02:23:43.632 --> 02:23:46.057]  And they're still telling reporters back off.
[02:23:46.956 --> 02:23:58.946]  Uh, or, you know, I mean that quote in the San Francisco Chronicle and Kurt Nemo reported on it, what, from an AP article, uh, where they walk up to reporters and say, we kill reporters in Iraq, they show our operations.
[02:23:58.986 --> 02:24:00.067]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[02:24:00.427 --> 02:24:03.870]  Make sure that's in there, but, but hidden, and then also hidden in plain view.
[02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:05.272]  I heard it on NPR last night.
[02:24:05.612 --> 02:24:06.853]  I read it in several articles.
[02:24:07.501 --> 02:24:08.042]  There are.
[02:24:08.282 --> 02:24:15.988]  ISI, which is a big private company, it's lion's share is Israeli former special forces troops.
[02:24:16.028 --> 02:24:19.511]  So they are foreign troops, folks, armed in New Orleans.
[02:24:19.571 --> 02:24:21.073]  We have got them.
[02:24:21.693 --> 02:24:23.034]  Dead in sights on that.
[02:24:23.094 --> 02:24:24.856]  That ought to be its own headline.
[02:24:25.236 --> 02:24:26.898]  Armed Israeli troops in New Orleans.
[02:24:27.238 --> 02:24:29.220]  We have got them caught red-handed there.
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:30.641]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:24:31.862 --> 02:24:34.004]  Well, the thing about the gun confiscation is
[02:24:34.631 --> 02:24:47.842]  There was one New York Times article last Thursday night, then a couple of days later there were a couple of statements from Second Amendment groups, and basically nothing after that in the mainstream media, the big media.
[02:24:47.902 --> 02:24:49.604]  So one
[02:24:50.342 --> 02:24:54.464]  You know, it suggests that they're trying to keep it undercover because it's not successful.
[02:24:54.624 --> 02:25:00.127]  Because if it was successful, everybody was giving up their guns, then it'd be top second headline every day.
[02:25:00.167 --> 02:25:01.868]  Oh, this is a definite probing.
[02:25:02.068 --> 02:25:11.513]  The first chance they got, they're doing a probing to see how many respond, how many fight back, to then do a calculation of how many troops they'll need for total disarmament.
[02:25:12.605 --> 02:25:16.488]  Yeah, so if that's happening, as you're suggesting, that people are resisting, then they would.
[02:25:17.028 --> 02:25:17.949]  It would be in their interest.
[02:25:17.969 --> 02:25:19.610]  Well, we know that old woman resisted.
[02:25:19.630 --> 02:25:21.151]  I mean, when they grabbed her, she fought back.
[02:25:21.551 --> 02:25:24.453]  We know that that lawyer resisted, and they went and swatted him.
[02:25:25.574 --> 02:25:26.794]  So, be sure to put that in there.
[02:25:28.115 --> 02:25:33.979]  Yeah, but O'Reilly loved the fact that the old woman got dragged out and a, what, 40-year-old handgun got confiscated.
[02:25:34.019 --> 02:25:35.380]  That was very conservative.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:36.661]  But, by the way,
[02:25:38.126 --> 02:25:42.587]  Gary Brownfield got the full clip, and we also played it, where she's going, Nooo!
[02:25:42.647 --> 02:25:44.368]  Bring me back home!
[02:25:44.468 --> 02:25:44.988]  Nooo!
[02:25:45.308 --> 02:25:47.768]  My cats!
[02:25:48.589 --> 02:25:49.589]  People need to hear that.
[02:25:49.609 --> 02:25:50.909]  I mean, it's so pathetic.
[02:25:51.289 --> 02:25:52.229]  She's so scared.
[02:25:52.249 --> 02:25:54.910]  They're just gonna go throw her in a pit of gang members.
[02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:57.431]  You know, I mean, it's just sick.
[02:25:57.991 --> 02:25:59.731]  Her cats are gonna starve to death, Paul.
[02:26:01.632 --> 02:26:02.232]  Well, that's right.
[02:26:02.272 --> 02:26:03.832]  My kitties!
[02:26:03.892 --> 02:26:04.952]  Nooo!
[02:26:05.733 --> 02:26:07.013]  And then, as I said before,
[02:26:07.944 --> 02:26:13.288]  You've got Bush giving the speech, I believe it's tonight, where he may accept some responsibility.
[02:26:14.889 --> 02:26:16.470]  He's given two speeches.
[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:20.093]  He gave one two days ago, one last night, and now there may be more speeches.
[02:26:20.923 --> 02:26:24.905]  But this is a guy who was playing guitar and eating cake as the disaster unfolded.
[02:26:25.245 --> 02:26:29.028]  Because, again, he's simply the script reader, he's not the script writer.
[02:26:29.048 --> 02:26:32.149]  No, I'll say Bush shouldn't be taken blame for this.
[02:26:32.509 --> 02:26:34.951]  I mean, he's a total puppet, but see, he has to do that.
[02:26:35.351 --> 02:26:48.378]  And how much more obvious does it need to be made that he's a puppet when Reuters are carrying the photo of his note to Condoleezza Rice at the Security Council UN meeting saying that he needs to go to the toilet.
[02:26:50.112 --> 02:26:57.017]  This is a man who needs to ask other people if he can go to the toilet, to hold his hands, and yet he's in control of everything.
[02:26:57.037 --> 02:27:06.204]  I know, Paul, I just... He actually, he does, they tell him everything, I and Bob... It's scary.
[02:27:07.045 --> 02:27:11.068]  And then again, he'll take all the blame, and the New World Order gets their police state put in place.
[02:27:12.685 --> 02:27:18.108]  But Laura Bush said no criticism of the President, a woman who couldn't even remember the name of the hurricane.
[02:27:18.428 --> 02:27:19.429]  Yeah, what did she call it?
[02:27:19.829 --> 02:27:20.389]  Karina.
[02:27:20.689 --> 02:27:21.410]  Karina!
[02:27:22.390 --> 02:27:26.592]  Like five days into the disaster, she's calling it... Katrina.
[02:27:27.053 --> 02:27:27.753]  I mean, Karina.
[02:27:28.073 --> 02:27:29.034]  I can't even say it wrong!
[02:27:29.394 --> 02:27:31.375]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:27:31.555 --> 02:27:32.095]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.817 --> 02:27:36.738]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.198 --> 02:27:38.699]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.694 --> 02:27:42.455]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.595 --> 02:27:47.576]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:27:47.636 --> 02:27:50.516]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:27:50.716 --> 02:27:56.097]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:27:56.337 --> 02:27:57.858]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:27:57.898 --> 02:28:00.138]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies.
[02:28:00.318 --> 02:28:03.879]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.219 --> 02:28:06.220]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:13.222]  This is how the establishment has been obtaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.

[02:28:47.942 --> 02:28:52.023]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.183 --> 02:28:55.064]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.144 --> 02:29:01.867]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.027 --> 02:29:05.048]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.248 --> 02:29:07.629]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.769 --> 02:29:12.491]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.671 --> 02:29:27.241]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[02:30:49.758 --> 02:30:58.100]  Alright, we'll go back to Paul in just a second and straight to your calls, 800-259-9231.
[02:30:58.300 --> 02:31:05.421]  But no, I mean the note is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and he says, Condoleezza, I need to go to the bathroom.
[02:31:05.441 --> 02:31:06.741]  I think I need a bathroom break.
[02:31:08.942 --> 02:31:11.662]  Then he gives it to her and she nods and gives permission.
[02:31:12.982 --> 02:31:16.663]  I don't know about you, but I haven't been asking to go to the bathroom since I was in elementary school.
[02:31:18.993 --> 02:31:22.596]  But, uh... I don't know, folks.
[02:31:23.316 --> 02:31:25.418]  It's like he became retarded, though.
[02:31:26.119 --> 02:31:28.560]  Because I... I know President Bush.
[02:31:29.161 --> 02:31:33.404]  And I don't know him well, but I've been at... I don't want to go through the whole story again.
[02:31:33.824 --> 02:31:48.796]  Point is, my sister went to the same school as Bush's daughters, and so I... One time at a dinner that he was at, and then another time, obviously I've been to a few events he was at, then one time he had me kidnapped when I asked him a question about the CFR at the end of a speech.
[02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:51.931]  But I mean, he could give good speeches.
[02:31:51.951 --> 02:31:54.872]  He wasn't just a gibbering moron who couldn't talk.
[02:31:54.972 --> 02:32:00.774]  And then, he got into office and he falls down and flops around and has bruises on both sides of his face.
[02:32:01.654 --> 02:32:07.416]  You know, passing out because of pretzels, because his heart rate's so as slow as a crocodile's.
[02:32:07.436 --> 02:32:09.917]  You know, all this weird stuff.
[02:32:11.217 --> 02:32:18.360]  It's really bizarre, but I don't want to focus on the potty humor all day, but he's at a meeting with Pootie Poot and has to get permission to go to the potty.
[02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:23.119]  Paul Watson, that aside, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:32:23.639 --> 02:32:32.862]  You have redesigned PrisonPlanet.TV with an interface so all the members' material is in one spot instead of just links to it all over the main page when new stuff comes up.
[02:32:33.202 --> 02:32:36.884]  And there's also still original reports and free video clips and free audio.
[02:32:36.944 --> 02:32:44.126]  A lot of stuff's free, but obviously a lot of it isn't because we've got to pay for bandwidth and we've got to give our supporters something exclusive and we appreciate them.
[02:32:44.566 --> 02:32:45.827]  Tell us about PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:32:47.668 --> 02:32:48.289]  Well, that's right.
[02:32:48.369 --> 02:32:52.752]  It's just been completely redesigned as per our members' request.
[02:32:53.893 --> 02:33:00.478]  It's got a central login page where all the new material is posted on a daily basis.
[02:33:01.099 --> 02:33:04.822]  The meter interview went up 30 minutes after the show ended.
[02:33:07.043 --> 02:33:09.826]  And the archives are there as well, so you can go back and visit.
[02:33:10.786 --> 02:33:12.528]  And my weekly TV report.
[02:33:12.868 --> 02:33:14.229]  And my weekly TV report.
[02:33:14.289 --> 02:33:14.950]  And also,
[02:33:15.862 --> 02:33:21.026]  Some of my older films have been on the web for a few years and they weren't in the highest quality.
[02:33:21.366 --> 02:33:27.611]  We're in the process of putting all my films on there in newer, higher bandwidth, better quality.
[02:33:27.911 --> 02:33:30.173]  Of course, my weekly TV reports are all there.
[02:33:30.914 --> 02:33:31.994]  Paul's book, my book.
[02:33:32.034 --> 02:33:34.076]  I mean, an e-book costs $6 on average.
[02:33:34.496 --> 02:33:37.198]  And you get a whole bunch of e-books in the first month for $5.95.
[02:33:38.319 --> 02:33:40.301]  You can just print copies of them off, folks.
[02:33:40.801 --> 02:33:44.084]  So there's so much to offer there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:44.224 --> 02:33:44.484]  Also,
[02:33:45.535 --> 02:33:52.482]  If you want hard copies of any of the documentaries I've made or any of the great documentaries I carry or books on tape or other books...
[02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:54.870]  by other great researchers.
[02:33:55.311 --> 02:34:00.252]  Go to nfowars.com and order them via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[02:34:00.513 --> 02:34:01.233]  You're authorized.
[02:34:01.293 --> 02:34:03.394]  I want you to make copies of my videos.
[02:34:03.694 --> 02:34:05.454]  The effect it's having is massive.
[02:34:05.754 --> 02:34:07.155]  We cannot overstate this.
[02:34:07.295 --> 02:34:07.975]  Please get them.
[02:34:08.255 --> 02:34:11.837]  Please make copies and you make what we do possible.
[02:34:11.957 --> 02:34:14.237]  We may even expand and be able to do more.
[02:34:14.838 --> 02:34:16.018]  If you continue to support us.
[02:34:16.118 --> 02:34:18.199]  If you don't, we'll have to contract
[02:34:18.639 --> 02:34:25.823]  I'm trying to decide now whether to contract or expand, so we need your support.
[02:34:25.843 --> 02:34:26.424]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:27.944 --> 02:34:29.485]  People ask every day, how do we support you?
[02:34:29.545 --> 02:34:30.166]  I want to donate.
[02:34:30.706 --> 02:34:34.588]  How you do that is you just, if you really want to support us, buy 10 copies of Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:34.828 --> 02:34:36.289]  Buy 10 copies of Martial Law.
[02:34:36.569 --> 02:34:40.712]  Buy 10 copies of America Destroyed by Design or American Dictators.
[02:34:41.172 --> 02:34:44.174]  I mean, they go down to like $5.95 apiece when you order a whole bunch.
[02:34:44.954 --> 02:34:46.174]  Uh, and give them to people.
[02:34:46.194 --> 02:34:49.695]  Instead of just, you know, helping us get material, it'll help others.
[02:34:50.175 --> 02:34:52.036]  That's the goal of what we do here.
[02:34:52.276 --> 02:34:54.336]  Or buy one copy and make copies of it.
[02:34:54.796 --> 02:34:56.857]  Regardless, just get the material.
[02:34:56.897 --> 02:34:59.098]  Go to InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:59.118 --> 02:35:03.979]  Paul, let's take some calls.
[02:35:04.479 --> 02:35:08.440]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to John in Oklahoma.
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:09.380]  Thanks for holding, John.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:10.820]  That's all right, Alex.
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:13.341]  It's been a while.
[02:35:15.283 --> 02:35:20.766]  The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States clearly defines the powers that be.
[02:35:20.806 --> 02:35:22.567]  I mentioned Romans 13.
[02:35:23.127 --> 02:35:25.849]  It's the people of the United States of America.
[02:35:25.869 --> 02:35:33.073]  If you read Romans 13.1, with that in mind, it makes perfect sense.
[02:35:33.914 --> 02:35:36.095]  And also, I'm glad... Yes, we're the government!
[02:35:36.415 --> 02:35:37.316]  We're the government!
[02:35:37.876 --> 02:35:39.277]  We are ordained of God.
[02:35:39.717 --> 02:35:43.179]  The reason the country is falling apart is because we're a king that sleeps.
[02:35:44.221 --> 02:35:44.822]  And we are!
[02:35:44.842 --> 02:35:49.386]  You know, your phone is really bad.
[02:35:49.427 --> 02:35:52.850]  What you're saying is so important, but I wish you could... Can you get closer to it?
[02:35:54.932 --> 02:35:55.513]  He dropped off.
[02:35:55.573 --> 02:35:56.334]  His phone cut out.
[02:35:57.375 --> 02:35:58.536]  Call back if you can, John.
[02:35:58.556 --> 02:36:00.418]  You held for 45 minutes to have 20 seconds.
[02:36:02.288 --> 02:36:02.988]  No, absolutely.
[02:36:03.088 --> 02:36:04.268]  We are the government.
[02:36:04.328 --> 02:36:11.390]  It isn't a crew of guys in black masks with some coke head pointing them around, you know, giving his buddies business deals.
[02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:15.690]  Hold this new thing with the company that dumped all the dead bodies in the woods.
[02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:24.012]  They're the ones Bush has hired because they're his cronies and Bush has been under, you know, named as a defendant before running scams with these people.
[02:36:25.312 --> 02:36:31.253]  Well, yeah, and also the reconstruction contracts going to Halliburton and Brown and Rue.
[02:36:32.194 --> 02:36:38.017]  Um, so you can take any aspect of it, of the whole fiasco, and in that you'll see the calling card of the New World Order.
[02:36:38.037 --> 02:36:45.781]  Not only the misery, the suffering, the death, the police state, but the cashing in on it after the event has actually happened.
[02:36:46.926 --> 02:36:49.027]  And the thing that Cole is mentioning is true.
[02:36:49.547 --> 02:37:05.752]  But the liberal media have, in their criticism of the government, made the case that it is the government's sole duty to protect the citizens, which is what Alderman said on MSNBC when he did that editorial rant.
[02:37:05.952 --> 02:37:10.654]  But meanwhile, the courts say they have no job.
[02:37:10.674 --> 02:37:13.895]  It is not their duty to protect us, but it is their duty to disarm us.
[02:37:14.864 --> 02:37:15.345]  Exactly.
[02:37:15.405 --> 02:37:18.548]  Their definition of protection is control.
[02:37:18.788 --> 02:37:20.850]  It's not the duty of government to protect us.
[02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:23.012]  Because, as you said, we are the government.
[02:37:23.532 --> 02:37:24.813]  It's their duty to serve us.
[02:37:25.694 --> 02:37:28.957]  They're called public servants, but now they're called authorities.
[02:37:29.458 --> 02:37:30.619]  Officials.
[02:37:31.019 --> 02:37:33.281]  And we're called civilians.
[02:37:33.341 --> 02:37:35.543]  See, martial law nomenclature.
[02:37:35.884 --> 02:37:37.445]  John of Oklahoma got back in.
[02:37:37.485 --> 02:37:39.427]  John, finish up what you were saying.
[02:37:40.009 --> 02:37:40.930]  I was going on.
[02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:42.671]  I don't know how far I got.
[02:37:42.691 --> 02:37:44.393]  You said we have a king that is asleep.
[02:37:44.833 --> 02:37:45.834]  But talk right into your phone.
[02:37:45.854 --> 02:37:46.555]  It's really bad.
[02:37:47.055 --> 02:37:47.896]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:37:48.677 --> 02:37:49.377]  Can you hear me now?
[02:37:49.417 --> 02:37:49.958]  Yes, I can.
[02:37:49.978 --> 02:37:50.438]  Please, sir.
[02:37:50.458 --> 02:37:50.818]  Go ahead.
[02:37:51.319 --> 02:37:51.719]  Okay.
[02:37:51.759 --> 02:37:53.781]  Well, anyway, that was my point.
[02:37:53.821 --> 02:37:55.703]  I think everybody should read Romans 13.
[02:37:55.763 --> 02:38:00.427]  Then they'll fully understand what he's talking about.
[02:38:00.887 --> 02:38:02.709]  Also, I'm glad you're doing what you're doing.
[02:38:03.149 --> 02:38:06.612]  Because if you went out and started to fight, we would lose that vital information.
[02:38:09.438 --> 02:38:10.639]  Well I appreciate your call.
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:12.921]  I want to expose the criminals.
[02:38:13.202 --> 02:38:17.045]  I want to fully expose them for what they are.
[02:38:17.085 --> 02:38:18.467]  I want to unmask them.
[02:38:18.487 --> 02:38:20.248]  I want to unskirt them.
[02:38:20.268 --> 02:38:22.631]  I want to take the veils away from them.
[02:38:22.691 --> 02:38:27.135]  I want to show the people that we have criminals masquerading as the government.
[02:38:27.845 --> 02:38:39.276]  And then I want to set about removing them peaceably, and then if they strike us, everyone will know that they are the criminal who is fleeing, and then we can remove them.
[02:38:39.616 --> 02:38:39.876]  Paul?
[02:38:41.217 --> 02:38:48.945]  Well that's right, and people have speculated that in the next primaries that impeachment proceedings will commence against Bush.
[02:38:50.115 --> 02:38:56.479]  We haven't heard anything about these proceedings regarding the outing of the CIA agent.
[02:38:56.519 --> 02:38:58.360]  That seemed to disappear off the radar.
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:09.706]  Well, I mean, how about a grand jury indicting Henry Kissinger for the declassified document where he ordered third world countries to forcibly sterilize their women for IMF money?
[02:39:09.806 --> 02:39:14.989]  I mean, where are the indictments for Noriega being an open drug partner with George Bush Senior?
[02:39:15.490 --> 02:39:18.071]  You know, we've got real reasons if you want to indict these people.
[02:39:19.045 --> 02:39:23.128]  Exactly, but I mean, many arms of government are just empty shells.
[02:39:23.168 --> 02:39:27.211]  It's like when we talked to Michael Meacher in London, who was on your show yesterday.
[02:39:27.912 --> 02:39:36.938]  He said for every issue, specifically the Iraq War, all they would do would turn up, have a debate, vote against the government, and then go home.
[02:39:37.359 --> 02:39:40.321]  Nothing would ever come of it, because it's an empty shell.
[02:39:40.381 --> 02:39:41.942]  It's a debating society.
[02:39:42.626 --> 02:39:51.608]  Meanwhile, the bureaucracies chaired and run by the big corporation heads, you know, who rotate between CEO and the heads of departments, they're running everything.
[02:39:52.668 --> 02:40:04.690]  Exactly, and then you've got the London Telegraph coming out two days ago and saying that Blair's decision to support America in the Iraq war was based on the advice of top Freemasons and that they made the decisions for him.
[02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:06.591]  And that was mainstream!
[02:40:06.871 --> 02:40:07.951]  Which newspaper was that?
[02:40:08.712 --> 02:40:11.533]  It was Daily Mail and London Telegraph.
[02:40:11.573 --> 02:40:14.055]  That's right, and I had that article and never even covered it.
[02:40:14.075 --> 02:40:17.516]  Just big papers going, Masons run things, ha ha ha!
[02:40:17.556 --> 02:40:18.377]  Exactly, and I mean it.
[02:40:18.897 --> 02:40:30.343]  We actually need to put those original articles up, because Al Jazeera magazine took it and spun it to say that Jews said that Blair had to go to war, making it an anti-Semitic perspective.
[02:40:30.423 --> 02:40:36.046]  But the original articles just said that Freemasons told Blair he had to go to war, and he went to war.
[02:40:37.106 --> 02:40:38.247]  Yeah, get those articles.
[02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:42.852]  Uh, just, in our face, uh, Jeremy in Pennsylvania.
[02:40:42.872 --> 02:40:43.592]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[02:40:43.953 --> 02:40:48.915]  Hello, um, did you, that Mason article you were talking about, is that the one that was on the cover of Newsweek?
[02:40:50.476 --> 02:40:53.398]  Or, uh... No, this is a new article that came out yesterday.
[02:40:53.418 --> 02:40:54.558]  Oh, okay, never mind.
[02:40:54.838 --> 02:40:59.561]  Um, did you hear about... Was there an article in Newsweek about Masons controlling Blair?
[02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:03.503]  Uh, it was, it was called the Secrets of, uh, the Masons.
[02:41:03.993 --> 02:41:04.373]  I don't know.
[02:41:04.693 --> 02:41:06.234]  No, that's simple.
[02:41:06.314 --> 02:41:10.436]  Well, anyway, yesterday, did you see Bush talking about destroying our trade barriers?
[02:41:11.557 --> 02:41:14.038]  Yes, as if there were any trade barriers.
[02:41:14.558 --> 02:41:20.481]  That's like if they've hatcheted off your arms and one of your legs, we're going to hatchet off the other leg now.
[02:41:21.062 --> 02:41:24.343]  The last driblets of blood haven't squirted out yet.
[02:41:24.883 --> 02:41:29.806]  Did you catch him last week saying that he's going to have to start taking action against terrorist propaganda?
[02:41:31.289 --> 02:41:31.930]  Yes, I did.
[02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:37.314]  And the Bilderberg Group, we got this year, said they're going to double oil prices and they're going to go after Patriots.
[02:41:37.734 --> 02:41:39.015]  Okay, one last question.
[02:41:41.397 --> 02:41:47.322]  Where can I find that article about the half monkey thing or whatever you were talking about before, where they do an experiment?
[02:41:47.342 --> 02:41:48.904]  That was in the Washington Post.
[02:41:49.184 --> 02:41:50.965]  That was in the Washington Post about a year ago.
[02:41:50.985 --> 02:41:51.706]  Oh, okay.
[02:41:52.629 --> 02:41:54.110]  All right, thank you.
[02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:54.550]  You bet.
[02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:55.411]  Thank you for the call.
[02:41:55.891 --> 02:42:00.174]  Yeah, did somebody tape Bush in front of the UN giving the trade talk?
[02:42:00.574 --> 02:42:01.495]  I forgot to do it.
[02:42:01.615 --> 02:42:03.076]  I did watch some online.
[02:42:03.496 --> 02:42:04.337]  I really need that.
[02:42:04.417 --> 02:42:05.498]  Folks, will you mail me that?
[02:42:06.038 --> 02:42:08.500]  Did anybody get the footage of Bush with the Mexican troops?
[02:42:09.358 --> 02:42:09.999]  Uh, behind him.
[02:42:10.179 --> 02:42:10.979]  I really need that.
[02:42:11.019 --> 02:42:15.342]  I have the AP photo, but not him giving the speech going, look at the Mexican troops behind me.
[02:42:15.662 --> 02:42:18.664]  I heard it on the radio and saying, look at the Mexican troops behind me.
[02:42:18.864 --> 02:42:19.665]  They're behind me.
[02:42:19.925 --> 02:42:20.665]  See, there's the message.
[02:42:20.685 --> 02:42:23.367]  The foreign troops are behind me.
[02:42:23.607 --> 02:42:33.033]  Do you understand our government signed an agreement two and a half years ago to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops to quote, deal with disasters and deal with American terrorists, Paul?
[02:42:34.622 --> 02:42:41.304]  Exactly, that's part of the pretext of, um, both privatizing the police state and handing it over to foreign mercenaries.
[02:42:41.384 --> 02:42:52.909]  I know we've covered that, Paul, but we need to put something together that just restates it and links to the old articles, where here's the deal to bring in Mexican troops, and see this time, oh, we've had Mexican troops here before, it's no big deal.
[02:42:53.849 --> 02:42:59.231]  Well, Reuters reported that the people were waving and cheering the Mexican convoys as they drove past.
[02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:06.873]  So whether that's true or not, or it's an attempt to rationalize it, I don't know, but it's certainly a scary development.
[02:43:07.773 --> 02:43:12.855]  Well, the AP reporter goes, this used to all belong to Mexico in his report, and he's kind of like, meh.
[02:43:14.796 --> 02:43:16.037]  Yeah, a lot of them love it.
[02:43:16.497 --> 02:43:17.958]  It's so great, move down there!
[02:43:19.218 --> 02:43:25.181]  It's so good, you know, I mean, they had a few outposts here, they stole it from the Indians, and then they claim it's theirs, it's a joke.
[02:43:26.001 --> 02:43:28.282]  Alright, let's talk to Clayton in, uh,
[02:43:29.255 --> 02:43:30.717]  Wisconsin, go ahead, Clayton.
[02:43:31.558 --> 02:43:32.319]  Good afternoon.
[02:43:32.339 --> 02:43:33.921]  Hi.
[02:43:34.001 --> 02:43:35.803]  All the wind has been taken out of my sails.
[02:43:36.945 --> 02:43:40.529]  I've been dumbed down here waiting, but anyway.
[02:43:41.370 --> 02:43:46.396]  I wanted to bring up the silent revolution of federal regionalism.
[02:43:47.217 --> 02:43:47.898]  Have you ever heard of it?
[02:43:48.536 --> 02:43:58.618]  Well yeah, they're covertly, now overtly, creating regional boards and federalizing everything by unifying the zoning and everything as part of Agenda 21 and the U.N.
[02:43:58.638 --> 02:43:59.078]  takeover.
[02:43:59.458 --> 02:44:03.979]  Oh yeah, up here in Wisconsin we have an organization, Taxpayers for Fair Zoning.
[02:44:04.639 --> 02:44:11.941]  We have all that information, the only thing is that we don't have the type of resources that you guys have down there.
[02:44:13.381 --> 02:44:16.442]  Well we don't have that many resources, we just got elbow grease, buddy.
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:23.544]  Well, I myself, I've worked from the top down, and then another gentleman that I know, he's worked from the bottom up.
[02:44:23.564 --> 02:44:25.725]  Let me just tell you this, Clayton, since you made that statement.
[02:44:26.486 --> 02:44:28.587]  You cannot expect instant responses.
[02:44:29.128 --> 02:44:34.131]  You have to just continue to batter physically, holding yourself up against the machinery.
[02:44:34.452 --> 02:44:42.717]  You have to just continue to press, continue to work, continue to labor, continue to move, continue to fight, continue to strive, continue to struggle.
[02:44:43.018 --> 02:44:44.479]  That's where you get results, buddy.
[02:44:44.499 --> 02:44:44.979]  Yep, yep.
[02:44:45.419 --> 02:44:45.660]  I know.
[02:44:46.641 --> 02:44:50.704]  I'm a cranberry farmer, so I'm unemployed in the wintertime, so I've got plenty of time then.
[02:44:51.204 --> 02:44:53.226]  We have our zoning board woken up.
[02:44:54.767 --> 02:44:59.730]  They oppose anything that the DNR says regarding smart growth.
[02:44:59.970 --> 02:45:01.311]  Well, you've done a great job.
[02:45:01.331 --> 02:45:03.833]  You need to run people off that board for higher office.
[02:45:04.513 --> 02:45:06.815]  Yeah, we need to take it to the next level.
[02:45:07.808 --> 02:45:12.311]  Other counties, the state, and then finally for the top of the mountain, Russia.
[02:45:12.752 --> 02:45:23.279]  Talking about martial law, remember when the city manager in Milwaukee was in trouble for corruption and they said, we can just declare martial law?
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:23.780]  Yeah.
[02:45:24.841 --> 02:45:25.621]  Yeah, I remember that.
[02:45:25.661 --> 02:45:27.663]  By the way, Paul, find that and put that in the article.
[02:45:27.703 --> 02:45:28.503]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:29.784 --> 02:45:30.064]  All right.
[02:45:31.906 --> 02:45:32.186]  Let's see.
[02:45:33.288 --> 02:45:40.052]  You know, with that young... I could tell that he was young because the way that he was talking and everything.
[02:45:40.812 --> 02:45:44.434]  I've been researching this conspiracy for 15 years myself.
[02:45:44.534 --> 02:45:45.655]  I'm 32 now.
[02:45:47.456 --> 02:45:52.899]  But what he should do is, you know, somehow start up a political party like, you know, Taxpayers for Fair Zoning, you know.
[02:45:53.219 --> 02:45:54.160]  Something real simple.
[02:45:55.700 --> 02:46:02.124]  And then, you know, get resources together, you know, what you can and research and wake other people up.
[02:46:02.662 --> 02:46:04.343]  You know, you have to play their game.
[02:46:05.443 --> 02:46:06.624]  That's just the way it is.
[02:46:06.864 --> 02:46:09.385]  Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.
[02:46:09.585 --> 02:46:11.106]  Well, Clayton, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:11.186 --> 02:46:12.666]  We play a whole new game.
[02:46:13.227 --> 02:46:16.688]  We're overturning their paradigm.
[02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:20.109]  It's a multi-faceted attack.
[02:46:20.250 --> 02:46:20.570]  Paul?
[02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:22.971]  Well, exactly.
[02:46:24.111 --> 02:46:28.153]  Ricola raised the issue of federalization, and with Katrina,
[02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:45.436]  Um, initially you had the local government appearing on the evening news crying for help because it wasn't coming and because FEMA was... Oh yeah, did you get that Times-Picayune we reposted yesterday from two and a half years ago from February 11th where they admit they federalized the city?
[02:46:46.697 --> 02:46:48.118]  I didn't see that, but I can get that.
[02:46:48.459 --> 02:46:49.699]  Oh, they didn't post it.
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:51.381]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:51.541 --> 02:46:53.742]  Folks, we're so busy we actually plan on air.
[02:46:54.123 --> 02:46:55.604]  Yeah, get... I'm sorry, I'm going to shut up.
[02:46:55.624 --> 02:46:55.904]  Go ahead.
[02:46:56.624 --> 02:46:57.565]  But the point is that
[02:46:58.314 --> 02:47:13.006]  After those initial desperate cries for help, the federal government stepped in and then you had the backlash calling the local government incompetent and it was their fault that the disaster caused as much devastation as it did.
[02:47:13.386 --> 02:47:20.772]  So then, Nagin and others offered their fealty to the federal government, said that Bush was doing a good job.
[02:47:21.212 --> 02:47:27.075]  So that gave the impression, overall, that it was the local government's incompetence that caused it.
[02:47:27.115 --> 02:47:31.358]  And Reagan and Bush, all of them, played that ruse because we have the documents.
[02:47:31.398 --> 02:47:34.400]  That city was totally federalized in February of 2003.
[02:47:35.959 --> 02:47:41.344]  Yeah, because early on the rhetoric was so harsh from the local government against Bush administration.
[02:47:41.384 --> 02:47:43.526]  And remember how the reporters were all mad at Bush?
[02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:49.532]  It turns out there were memos that went out at CNN and Fox and other areas that was all staged.
[02:47:49.913 --> 02:47:50.133]  Yeah.
[02:47:50.573 --> 02:47:51.394]  Oh, it's so sad.
[02:47:51.414 --> 02:47:55.278]  They told the local officials to get mad and angry at the federal government.
[02:47:55.658 --> 02:48:02.839]  And then it all switched when the support started flooding in to say that they were with the federal government and applauded their efforts.
[02:48:02.919 --> 02:48:07.500]  So then people thought, well, it must have been the local government that was inconstant that caused the problem.
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:13.721]  Therefore, more federalization, more funding for FEMA is the answer.
[02:48:14.101 --> 02:48:15.561]  Boy, they play us like a fiddle.
[02:48:18.902 --> 02:48:19.702]  Good job, Paul.
[02:48:19.722 --> 02:48:20.662]  Stay there, final segment.
[02:48:20.702 --> 02:48:24.863]  We'll let Jim in Ohio get a comment in and cover a few other important news items.
[02:48:25.811 --> 02:48:30.212]  Yeah, the Times-Picayune reported that was a federalized city in February of 2003.
[02:48:30.472 --> 02:48:32.433]  There's an article in February 11.
[02:48:34.133 --> 02:48:37.294]  They federalized the city under Homeland Security control.
[02:48:37.834 --> 02:48:39.895]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:40.135 --> 02:48:42.415]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[02:48:46.903 --> 02:48:49.764]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.005 --> 02:48:51.585]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.925 --> 02:48:56.608]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.948 --> 02:49:03.671]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.011 --> 02:49:05.993]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.193 --> 02:49:09.036]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.136 --> 02:49:13.800]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.404]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.644 --> 02:49:25.851]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.131 --> 02:49:28.573]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:51.434]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.574 --> 02:49:59.661]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.922 --> 02:50:06.988]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.148 --> 02:50:08.429]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.509 --> 02:50:14.414]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.594 --> 02:50:19.678]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.798 --> 02:50:28.685]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.945 --> 02:50:32.247]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:52.837 --> 02:52:02.366]  Just chronicling the unbelievable corruption and evil of the government, the private government controlled by criminal interests, the world government unfolding right in front of you.
[02:52:03.407 --> 02:52:19.501]  For those that deny the bizarreness of all of this, here's that clip, we have the video clip up on the website, where Senator Biden brings up implantable chips being forced on people during the confirmation hearing of Roberts.
[02:52:21.314 --> 02:52:32.517]  Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement?
[02:52:32.557 --> 02:52:34.358]  There's actual discussion about that.
[02:52:34.678 --> 02:52:38.679]  You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.
[02:52:39.463 --> 02:52:45.248]  Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior?
[02:52:45.568 --> 02:52:47.630]  You will rule on that.
[02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:52.874]  See, and they're preemptively already in England talking about brain scanning all the kids and taking them away.
[02:52:52.934 --> 02:52:55.377]  The scan shows you might be violent.
[02:52:55.817 --> 02:53:00.381]  They've already got scanners in five airports where the passive MRI decides if you're violent.
[02:53:00.761 --> 02:53:02.823]  And Paul, the State Department said we were evil.
[02:53:04.453 --> 02:53:06.814]  For saying that China sells body parts.
[02:53:06.854 --> 02:53:09.534]  We just knew they advertised them in major magazines.
[02:53:09.554 --> 02:53:12.515]  $200,000 for a kidney from a prisoner.
[02:53:12.555 --> 02:53:14.315]  And the Chinese officials say, well of course.
[02:53:15.056 --> 02:53:16.436]  We've been doing this for 20 years.
[02:53:16.856 --> 02:53:19.737]  And please buy the collagen from melted down people we murdered.
[02:53:20.277 --> 02:53:21.677]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[02:53:21.717 --> 02:53:23.437]  I mean, where's the State Department on this, Paul?
[02:53:24.538 --> 02:53:29.979]  Well, the fact is that the State Department criticized alternative websites for reporting that.
[02:53:30.535 --> 02:53:40.547]  When the State Department had on their own website a report about how body organs of executed Chinese prisoners were being trafficked around the world.
[02:53:40.968 --> 02:53:49.038]  It was on their own website, and then we have this article out of the Guardian, beauty products from the skin of executed Chinese prisoners.
[02:53:49.770 --> 02:53:56.293]  Where the company who is exporting these products to Europe says it's traditional and nothing to make a fuss about.
[02:53:57.094 --> 02:54:03.017]  It's traditional, just like during the Great Leap Forward they had the succulent pots roasting the children.
[02:54:03.377 --> 02:54:12.401]  I'll never forget Peter Jennings one night going, by the way, a new book put out by the Chinese government admits that they stewed children in large pots.
[02:54:13.422 --> 02:54:15.503]  And what do we see now in my own city?
[02:54:15.943 --> 02:54:17.143]  Mao's Restaurant.
[02:54:17.744 --> 02:54:18.164]  Yummy!
[02:54:18.849 --> 02:54:23.991]  Adorned with images of Mao, the menu's a little red book.
[02:54:24.471 --> 02:54:26.012]  You know, I wonder what's in the menu.
[02:54:26.052 --> 02:54:27.272]  Well, you know, we have Mao's.
[02:54:27.612 --> 02:54:29.613]  There's a bunch of Mao's here in the U.S.
[02:54:29.993 --> 02:54:32.594]  All the trendies with their iPods and Lexuses go there.
[02:54:33.255 --> 02:54:34.695]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:54:34.735 --> 02:54:35.375]  Tim, welcome.
[02:54:35.576 --> 02:54:36.196]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:54:36.576 --> 02:54:38.257]  Would you like some succulent human?
[02:54:38.597 --> 02:54:39.177]  Hello, Paul.
[02:54:39.857 --> 02:54:40.477]  No, thank you.
[02:54:41.658 --> 02:54:46.640]  Last we talked, I was mentioning to you about Richard C. Hoagland talking about the spirit of the hurricanes.
[02:54:48.058 --> 02:54:48.318]  Yes.
[02:54:48.638 --> 02:54:59.522]  And I was wondering if you gentlemen were aware of a UN treaty going back as far as 76, and the truth of it, where they actually talk about... Yeah, weather modification.
[02:54:59.562 --> 02:55:02.323]  Not engaging in the hostile use of weather modification.
[02:55:02.343 --> 02:55:07.005]  Yeah, no, that's in the treaty, and there's bills, and there's defense secretaries talking about it.
[02:55:07.265 --> 02:55:08.386]  It's certainly real.
[02:55:08.546 --> 02:55:13.688]  It seems like they're just showing off with Ophelia, the way that thing is bouncing all over the place, doing loop-de-loops.
[02:55:14.628 --> 02:55:16.530]  I'm looking and I'm waiting for them to come out and say
[02:55:28.601 --> 02:55:32.304]  Well, you know, we could have identified these dead people and all these missing people.
[02:55:32.324 --> 02:55:33.164]  Let me tell you what they're going to do.
[02:55:33.184 --> 02:55:34.025]  Let me tell you what they're going to do.
[02:55:34.045 --> 02:55:38.849]  They're going to carry out terror attacks in the future and blame it on an anti-microchip group.
[02:55:39.309 --> 02:55:41.551]  And to prove you're good, you'll have to go get the chip.
[02:55:42.071 --> 02:55:42.692]  That's the plan.
[02:55:42.712 --> 02:55:43.452]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:55:43.772 --> 02:55:45.554]  Lord Watson, you have the final comments?
[02:55:46.654 --> 02:55:54.437]  Well, yeah, I mean, experts in Russia and America have got the satellite images and said there's something very wrong with those Hurricane Katrina images.
[02:55:55.197 --> 02:55:59.318]  They had tsunami bomb experiments as far back as 1944.
[02:56:00.659 --> 02:56:05.740]  And with all the other stuff we know they've done, then I wouldn't put it past them to do something like this.
[02:56:06.481 --> 02:56:10.622]  You got some big reports coming out on prisonplanet.com today, don't you, Paul?
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:16.922]  That's right, we've got a rounder particle of Katrina, and I'd encourage everyone to get that and send it out, spread it around the internet.
[02:56:17.702 --> 02:56:18.902]  Alright, thank you my friend.
[02:56:18.942 --> 02:56:20.383]  Keep it up there in the UK.
[02:56:20.743 --> 02:56:21.983]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.063 --> 02:56:22.904]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.924 --> 02:56:24.024]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
