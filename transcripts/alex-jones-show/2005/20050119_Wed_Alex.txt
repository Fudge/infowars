[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.222]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:10.702]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.364]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.705]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:57.490]  Well, the inauguration, the re-coordination of the open borders promoting, gun grabbing, UN supporting, Bill of Rights shredding puppet, and he is just that, a puppet, for us to waste our energies on, is coming up tomorrow.
[00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:07.356]  And it's a nice example of the police state for you and your family when you watch television, and it's a nice example of total martial law for those living in D.C.
[00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.005]  And they have these big events all over the country at different conventions and government meetings and IMF and World Bank functions.
[00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:31.638]  Every city getting trained how to be good little slaves but the borders are totally wide open and the national ID card legislation actually gives amnesty to the illegal aliens by accepting all their fake ID cards.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.101]  That's the type of
[00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:39.398]  government activities that we're facing right now.
[00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.820]  Again, my friends, it is Wednesday, the 19th day of January, 2005.
[00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.662]  I still keep wanting to say four.
[00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.464]  By the time I get used to saying, oh, five, it'll be Christmas again.
[00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:57.626]  All right, UN chief warns of a mega disaster.
[00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:03.408]  BBC, the UN's disaster chief has outlined a ten-year plan of investment.
[00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:05.409]  Ah, world taxation.
[00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:13.678]  To avert a natural disaster that could be 100 times worse than the Asian mega tsunamis.
[00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:22.704]  And they say that the mega cities are what face the greatest problem.
[00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:27.548]  Also China warns Japan against unilateral action following new defense plan.
[00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.371]  China bristling with weapons constantly threatening everyone.
[00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.553]  Their little buddy North Korea firing missiles at people.
[00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:36.334]  Including this country.
[00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:37.835]  Oh yeah, you never heard about that, did you?
[00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.057]  North Korea fired a missile at the U.S.
[00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.579]  I'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.960]  This was years ago.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.862]  A test missile hit Alaska.
[00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:47.144]  But they're threatening Japan.
[00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:49.086]  How dare you say you'll defend yourself!
[00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:52.429]  Why, you might be with Al-Qaeda!
[00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.530]  Oh no, that's our government.
[00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.973]  If you defend yourself, you might be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:57.274]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:00.497]  So we'll get into this report as well.
[00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:05.194]  And a lot of new news about how your car is going to be watching you.
[00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.755]  I talked about this earlier this week and last week.
[00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:15.418]  Well, more mainstream news articles about how your car is going to be watching you.
[00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:16.679]  Cameras in it!
[00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.100]  Why, we've got to be watching at all times.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.340]  It's to keep us safe.
[00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.341]  What's wrong with that?
[00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.382]  And Paula Zahn last night
[00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:26.209]  Have the show.
[00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.271]  I did see the CNN website comment about it.
[00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:31.113]  I didn't get a chance to tune into it.
[00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.093]  Did you watch it?
[00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:44.563]  We had callers calling in yesterday about the ads for it, about citizen spies and the stay-at-home mom who sits at her computer watching police surveillance cameras joining the homeland.
[00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:52.049]  And yesterday I got a FEMA calendar that has a citizen corps and has photos reach
[00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:59.289]  Month of the year of the Citizen Corps volunteering to defend the homeland from Al-Ciada.
[00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.351]  But again, the border's completely wide open.
[00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:13.596]  I was listening to a radio show this morning locally, and they have the reporter up doing live broadcasting from DC.
[00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:37.061]  And because Karl Rove and many others in the Bush cabinet, or in the Bush White House, are from Austin, Texas, they were able to get Karl Rove on, and able to get Michael McCall on, and the stuff I heard them saying, I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:44.405]  And the twisting, and I'm talking about Republicans twisting, you just tuned in, it doesn't mean I'm a Democrat.
[00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:49.804]  I am a liberal, though, because I am for the Second Amendment.
[00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:52.505]  It's conservative now to want to ban guns.
[00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:54.065]  So I'm not conservative.
[00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:55.246]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.488 --> 00:05:04.850]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.451]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:13.953]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:13.993 --> 00:05:15.354]  The New World Order
[00:05:16.134 --> 00:05:17.074]  Panama!
[00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:21.336]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:28.339]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:30.540]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:41.224]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:43.605]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.866]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:02.636]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:05.737]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:10.159]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.419]  So what do you do?
[00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.281]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:18.903]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:51.969]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:07.469]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.611]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:07:12.271 --> 00:07:14.872]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.713]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:19.633]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:22.074]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:23.575]  Check with your doctor.
[00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:28.596]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:29.957]  In all likelihood,
[00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:33.776]  Your doctor will recommend Bright Light Therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:35.257]  Light up your life.
[00:07:35.357 --> 00:07:38.079]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a Northern Light.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:48.868]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com.

[00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.311]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:09.185]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:10.685]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:12.286]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:16.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.168 --> 00:08:21.250]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.144 --> 00:08:49.712]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're here back live now eight minutes and thirty seconds into the broadcast of the first hour.
[00:08:49.732 --> 00:08:53.294]  And let's just run through some of the news that's coming up.
[00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:56.276]  British Army Chief condemns abuse.
[00:08:57.122 --> 00:09:08.747]  Head of the British Army, General Sir Mike Jackson, has said he condemns utterly abuse as three soldiers face charges of mistreating Iraqi civilians.
[00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:16.890]  Some good news, police report recommends suspending handgun ID system.
[00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:31.974]  A law requiring Maryland State Police to collect ballistics information from each handgun sold in the state has not aided a single criminal investigation and should be repealed, a state police report has concluded.
[00:09:31.994 --> 00:09:34.276]  That's great news!
[00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:43.602]  Rarely do you see the police organizations stick their heads up above the federal propaganda and refute the lies.
[00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:49.935]  Bush won't rule out action against Iran over nukes.
[00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:56.697]  This is out of Reuters, and the Associated Press is reporting that it's not true!
[00:09:57.517 --> 00:10:08.560]  Iran doesn't have nukes, they're not developing nukes, and there's no evidence that Saddam shipped his weapons of mass destruction to Iran.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.341]  How many times has this White House
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.502]  Lied to us about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:20.706]  Now they're telling us the same lie again, but saying, hey, pretty pleased with sugar on top with my fingers crossed.
[00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:21.907]  It's in Iran.
[00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:23.108]  Let's go there next.
[00:10:23.948 --> 00:10:27.050]  So Bush won't rule out action against Iran over nukes.
[00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:33.675]  Iran vows deterrence after Bush refuses to rule out an attack.
[00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:36.177]  Openly saying, I think I'll attack you.
[00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:39.439]  And our troops for a year have been attacking Syria.
[00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:45.822]  Imagine if a country that bordered us was militarily attacking us, and we just laid there and took it.
[00:10:46.403 --> 00:10:49.105]  That's what Syria is doing, and wisely.
[00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:58.211]  And again, I'm no fan of Assad, and I'm no fan of any of these countries, but they're not threatening us.
[00:10:59.012 --> 00:11:01.834]  They've just got natural resources, and that's what this is all about.
[00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:08.079]  And here's a United Press International article from January 18th, from yesterday,
[00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:11.837]  We saw a similar article about this a few years ago, but here's another one.
[00:11:12.257 --> 00:11:14.119]  Israel to kill in U.S.
[00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:15.339]  and allied nations.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:30.029]  Israel is embarking upon a more aggressive approach to the war on terror that will include staging targeted killings in the United States and other friendly countries, former Israeli intelligence officials told United Press International.
[00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:32.951]  Wow!
[00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:36.694]  So now we're going to have foreign governments going around doing hits.
[00:11:39.062 --> 00:11:47.144]  Wouldn't it be bad enough to have our own government going around killing American citizens, killing people in America, without judge, jury, or executioner?
[00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:51.145]  And they just carry it all out in one big swipe?
[00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:52.845]  The trifecta?
[00:11:53.265 --> 00:11:55.666]  Now we'll have foreign governments doing it.
[00:11:55.686 --> 00:11:59.647]  I mean, we know foreign governments have been killing Americans here for a long time!
[00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:03.708]  But now, let's just flaunt it in your face.
[00:12:05.088 --> 00:12:05.608]  And, um,
[00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.272]  I also want to get into this Scotsman article.
[00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:13.314]  So, are you in the mood for a drive?
[00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:20.459]  And it says that special cameras hooked into AI computers.
[00:12:21.303 --> 00:12:38.989]  Won't just be analyzing your eye movement or your distracted driving, as Ergonomics Today reported two weeks ago, or as the Houston Chronicle reported years ago, this will be in the cars by law, every person watching by a camera 24 hours a day, every time you get in your car, your home, when you walk down the street.
[00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:41.310]  It's also going to listen to your voice.
[00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.631]  And if you sound upset, it's going to call the police on you.
[00:12:46.454 --> 00:12:52.877]  The Scotsman is the major daily paper of the country known as Scotland, that northern area of the British Isles.
[00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:01.762]  And so, hmm, you can still deny it and call it a conspiracy theory when it's in the Houston Chronicle, Ergonomics Today and The Scotsman.
[00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:07.765]  And just laugh and giggle about it until it comes to your car here very, very soon.
[00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:12.408]  Just like all major roads in Texas will be turned into toll roads,
[00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:15.040]  Told you that five years ago, you laughed at me.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:22.205]  Now it's going in nationwide, and Governor Rick Perry is being hailed as conservative for total taxation and control.
[00:13:22.225 --> 00:13:26.229]  And in the polls, 90 plus percent of Texans are against it, liberals and conservatives.
[00:13:26.749 --> 00:13:29.271]  And the governor just laughs at us and says, I'm conservative!
[00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:30.572]  Ha ha ha!
[00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:32.974]  Oh, thank you.
[00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:36.697]  So I thought I'd go back over that as well.
[00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:38.479]  Wave of horrible suicide blasts.
[00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:41.341]  Killed at least 25 in Iraq today alone.
[00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:47.048]  ahead of the staged elections coming up in, uh, what, 11 days?
[00:13:49.670 --> 00:14:06.942]  But I like to... I keep the radio on in the background in the morning while I'm reading news articles, while I'm in the shower, while I'm brushing my teeth, my toofies, and I've been monitoring talk radio, obviously, for a long time,
[00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:17.149]  I don't watch very much television these days, but I can read all the different synopses put on the websites, put on ABC and CBS and CNN and FOX.
[00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:22.771]  In 30 seconds I can read what a TV show was about and get the gist of it instead of watching it.
[00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:32.855]  Though you get a little bit more watching TV, but you guys always watch it and call me about it or send me videotapes of the specific TV shows that have little tidbits of brainwashing and tyranny in them.
[00:14:33.235 --> 00:14:34.676]  But I do listen to a lot of talk radio.
[00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:38.057]  And they are reading off a script.
[00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:41.793]  In more ways than one.
[00:14:41.993 --> 00:14:49.199]  Now, we've caught them putting out memos and scripts to different talk show hosts around the country.
[00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:54.583]  We've caught the government paying talk show hosts off to push a certain view.
[00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:56.824]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:59.927]  It's just... This is a credible broadcast.
[00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.288]  This is serious business.
[00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:05.591]  We don't talk about news unless we've already documented it.
[00:15:06.492 --> 00:15:09.134]  And just because you hear it here years before it's in the mainstream,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.342]  You say, well then where do you learn about it?
[00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:17.269]  From government documents, from congressional testimony, from people I know in the different industries.
[00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.452]  They're paying people off.
[00:15:22.675 --> 00:15:28.602]  But more than just paying off, because if they pay off the top broadcasters and top news writers,
[00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:43.997]  Then, those individuals get put on all the national TV shows as guests, and then all the little talk show hosts, all the little writers, see them, see what they're saying, pick up that worldview, and basically regurgitate it.
[00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:56.305]  Their program directors, their editors tell them, oh, write stories like Billy Bob does, see how successful he is, and then everybody goes out and basically imitates that.
[00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:00.067]  And that's how you get an even greater level
[00:16:00.848 --> 00:16:01.428]  of control.
[00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:07.791]  But listening to talk radio, I mean, it's the same words in the same order, the same propaganda.
[00:16:08.452 --> 00:16:10.113]  It's as if they're reading off scripts.
[00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:13.654]  And again, we know some national hosts have been caught doing this.
[00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:19.377]  But predominantly, again, it's just people imitating what they heard the big head honchos say.
[00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:21.638]  And it's despicable.
[00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:29.422]  But I was listening to talk radio this morning, flipping around on the channels, and on three separate
[00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.341]  One local and two syndicated.
[00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:37.765]  I heard the host and their guest saying the exact same thing.
[00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:44.970]  And these are radio shows and companies owned by different groups.
[00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:47.572]  And it was basically this.
[00:16:48.313 --> 00:16:50.214]  Illegal immigration is horrible.
[00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:52.376]  Everyone is against it.
[00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:56.659]  The answer is a national ID card.
[00:16:56.839 --> 00:16:58.961]  Oh boy, we sure need one.
[00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:07.168]  We sure need standardized biometrics to get a driver's license.
[00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.249]  This will stop the illegal aliens.
[00:17:11.749 --> 00:17:15.290]  And then I heard Lamar Smith on a show, congressman from San Antonio.
[00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:21.391]  I heard Michael McCall locally on a radio station saying the exact same things.
[00:17:22.892 --> 00:17:24.732]  They were on the shows with the host.
[00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:27.854]  And definitely Smith and McCall.
[00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:33.759]  I mean, McCall worked for Janet Reno, helped cover up Waco and other actions, helped cover up Chinagate.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.044]  Lamar Smith helped get biometrics in in Texas with Bill Clinton back in the early 90s.
[00:17:39.424 --> 00:17:45.290]  Right when Bill Clinton first got into office in 93, he sold it then as a way to stop the illegal aliens.
[00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:52.076]  And then a waiver was put in, this was even in the statesman, a local paper years ago, that illegal aliens get to get around that system.
[00:17:53.129 --> 00:18:09.177]  But here they are, knowing that the people are concerned about open borders, knowing that you want something to be done, knowing that the war on terror is a fraud on its face, because they're training us how to live under a microscope, but leaving the borders more wide open than they were before 9-11.
[00:18:09.357 --> 00:18:11.038]  And that's just the facts.
[00:18:12.699 --> 00:18:21.723]  And so they tell you, oh, this new national ID card, this new standardized driver's license that we really need, this will keep you safe.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:30.124]  And they wouldn't talk about it on the radio or on TV before the bill passed a month and a half ago.
[00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:33.307]  And before Bush signed it.
[00:18:34.487 --> 00:18:48.057]  Now that it's passed, it's in USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, all the big talk show hosts are pushing it, so all the little talk show hosts just parrot or repeat what they've heard over and over and over and over again.
[00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:54.971]  And the average person driving down the road hears this and says, yeah, I want a standardized driver's license.
[00:18:57.014 --> 00:19:02.239]  Now again, before they got it passed, they didn't want to talk about it in case you woke up to it and fought it.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.683]  Now that they've passed it, they're acting like they need it.
[00:19:05.883 --> 00:19:07.104]  Oh, we don't have it yet.
[00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:08.646]  Oh, we sure need it.
[00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:12.639]  So as it's implemented, you will accept it.
[00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:14.760]  It's just incredible propaganda.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.684]  And it's the same sentences being repeated verbatim by these shows, being regurgitated.
[00:19:22.365 --> 00:19:31.410]  But in the National ID Card Bill, it has a waiver in it for illegal aliens.
[00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:37.414]  We had Congressman Paul Long, Congressman Dan Credo about it a month ago, a month and a half ago as they were passing it.
[00:19:39.506 --> 00:19:41.928]  And so, this is how they operate.
[00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:44.830]  The bill is passed.
[00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:56.739]  It's in there that the states and cities and counties and the feds, instructing everybody, accept these foreign ID cards, basically legalizing the illegals.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.601]  And they tell you they're doing it to stop it.
[00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:06.826]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use, in business and socially.
[00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:13.850]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.171]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:22.854]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.

[00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.630]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.270]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:21:17.811 --> 00:21:19.811]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:27.852]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.

[00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:13.242]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:22:14.162 --> 00:22:20.968]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:23.289]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.592]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:06.947]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:07.427 --> 00:24:10.288]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.671]  Look, try to crystallize what I was saying simply before the break.
[00:24:21.332 --> 00:24:22.393]  Try to break it down.
[00:24:23.573 --> 00:24:29.436]  The national ID card bill that passed, that's still kind of a secret.
[00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:32.957]  I mean, it's in the media, but back of the paper.
[00:24:34.085 --> 00:24:37.468]  And they call it a standardization of driver's license and IDs.
[00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:47.617]  They're now selling it, because they've already passed it, now they've got to get us ready for it, as something that's going to stop illegal aliens.
[00:24:49.239 --> 00:25:00.529]  But the bill itself actually went in and made it legal, made all these matricula cards, issued by 30 plus nations, acceptable by the government.
[00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:08.423]  And to where the illegal aliens can drive around now and have their fake ID cards accepted as valid.
[00:25:11.044 --> 00:25:23.071]  And then, congressmen get on these talk shows and go, oh, this new national ID card system, they call it, again, driver's license standardization, this will stop the illegal aliens from having all these fake ID cards.
[00:25:23.852 --> 00:25:27.514]  When the bill itself actually opens it up to immigration.
[00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:31.631]  And so the talk show hosts go, my goodness, then I'm all for it!
[00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:32.893]  How do we get this passed?
[00:25:33.535 --> 00:25:37.301]  Michael McCall goes, oh well, we're working on it right now for ya.
[00:25:37.922 --> 00:25:39.245]  They just passed it!
[00:25:40.242 --> 00:25:50.004]  And then you open up the major newspapers, and they're, well, they did pass driver's license standardization, and some are calling it a national ID card, and, well, it does standardize that biometrically.
[00:25:50.484 --> 00:26:00.126]  And then Governor Ridge, the outgoing head of Homeland Security, who's going to be replaced by Michael Chertoff, who's even worse, goes over to England and says, torture is good.
[00:26:00.146 --> 00:26:05.807]  And then he says, by the way, we need a world ID card standardization.
[00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.628]  You see, once you've got a national ID card,
[00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:17.728]  through the state level, then they create a global database off the same biometric identifiers and you go into that database.
[00:26:19.188 --> 00:26:21.990]  And then they start the global taxation, the global regulation.
[00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.171]  It's all happening.
[00:26:25.892 --> 00:26:32.976]  What does forced psychological testing of every school-age child in the country up to age 18 have to do with terrorists?
[00:26:33.076 --> 00:26:33.476]  It doesn't.
[00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:36.398]  What does any of this have to do with it?
[00:26:36.518 --> 00:26:36.918]  It doesn't.
[00:26:36.998 --> 00:26:38.079]  It's about control.
[00:26:39.088 --> 00:26:43.471]  Alright, let's go to your calls, then we'll get back into just this incredible stack of news I've got in front of me.
[00:26:43.791 --> 00:26:51.216]  We've got a very interesting guest, an inventor that the Defense Department is very interested in, coming up in the next hour.
[00:26:52.437 --> 00:26:54.518]  Let's talk to Jean in Ohio.
[00:26:54.618 --> 00:26:55.399]  Jean, go ahead.
[00:26:55.959 --> 00:26:56.699]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.761]  I was just calling to find out how your contest panned out.
[00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:02.063]  Pardon me?
[00:27:02.603 --> 00:27:06.526]  I was calling to find out how your contest panned out.
[00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:09.575]  Well, I talked about this yesterday.
[00:27:09.715 --> 00:27:11.278]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.046]  We're going to have a contest that was going to be earlier this month.
[00:27:15.807 --> 00:27:16.970]  And we got, I don't know, like...
[00:27:18.152 --> 00:27:40.469]  Last time I checked, it was like 8 million visitors to ArnoldExposed.com, but only a few people entered the contest at ArnoldExposed.com to make a TV ad, and so I've extended the contest out even longer, and if we don't get more entries, I'll just have to go ahead, I guess, and give the prize to the few people that entered it.
[00:27:40.989 --> 00:27:43.932]  The problem is, is those that entered it really didn't follow the rules.
[00:27:44.853 --> 00:27:52.640]  Of the contest, but bottom line, I will award the $2,000 prize to somebody here pretty soon.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.042]  Okay, that was all I wanted to know.
[00:27:55.542 --> 00:27:55.983]  Thank you.
[00:27:56.203 --> 00:27:57.764]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:27:57.924 --> 00:27:58.645]  Okay, bye bye.
[00:27:58.785 --> 00:27:59.165]  You bet.
[00:27:59.246 --> 00:28:01.768]  Yeah, folks, we started ArnoldExposed.com
[00:28:02.802 --> 00:28:20.047]  And I personally am going to run some TV ads in areas of California and here in Austin as soon as I'm done with my film, Marshall Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, and that should be done here in the next few weeks and then we'll be offering it by the end of next month.
[00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:29.370]  But as soon as I'm done with that project, which literally I'm working eight, nine hours a day on, on top of doing my own radio show and my TV show and radio interviews,
[00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.271]  I worked about 18 hours yesterday.
[00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:37.092]  It's working a little too hard, but I'm almost done.
[00:28:37.192 --> 00:28:40.013]  Then I'm going to finish up these Arnold ads that I've been making myself.
[00:28:40.713 --> 00:28:51.136]  And then I'm going to, of course, give the prize for those that have entered the contest to make their own ads that we're going to post at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:58.958]  And for those that just joined us, Arnold Schwarzenegger's own biographer, the Kennedy biographer, is coming out with a book
[00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:04.742]  called Fantastic, where Arnold admits, quote, the secret plan to put him in the White House.
[00:29:04.802 --> 00:29:06.423]  So, there's no more debating it.
[00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:15.467]  This Amend for Arnold front group, with one of his former top campaign people running it, is just there softening us up.
[00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:17.148]  It's been all over the news pushing for this.
[00:29:17.588 --> 00:29:25.413]  George Bush Sr., a month ago, gave Arnold this big award at College Station and said, you know, you're looking at your next president, don't bet against Arnold.
[00:29:25.893 --> 00:29:27.954]  But still, people are in denial about this.
[00:29:28.823 --> 00:29:33.046]  It doesn't matter if he's anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-open border.
[00:29:33.927 --> 00:29:36.789]  The Sean Hannity's and Limbaugh's of the world are going to tell you to vote for him.
[00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.230]  They did for Governor.
[00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:40.352]  And, uh, we're in deep trouble.
[00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:42.634]  You want a foreigner in the White House?
[00:29:42.654 --> 00:29:43.694]  You're probably going to get one.
[00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:45.896]  A guy who says he admires Hitler.
[00:29:46.376 --> 00:29:47.277]  We'll be back with your calls.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.580]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:53.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:57.265]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.754 --> 00:30:06.996]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:07.736]  I use it.
[00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:10.097]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[00:30:10.157 --> 00:30:11.938]  It's called the Sacro Wedge.
[00:30:12.298 --> 00:30:16.299]  And it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[00:30:16.699 --> 00:30:21.963]  And what it is, is a wedge device, just a small one, that you put underneath your sacrum.
[00:30:22.263 --> 00:30:23.484]  And then you get down on it.
[00:30:23.544 --> 00:30:25.505]  You put your weight down on it, on the floor.
[00:30:25.966 --> 00:30:27.767]  And you let gravity do the work.
[00:30:28.187 --> 00:30:32.210]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away, chiropractors go away.
[00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.371]  You don't need them anymore.
[00:30:33.691 --> 00:30:34.812]  You gotta give it a try.
[00:30:35.152 --> 00:30:37.314]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[00:30:37.874 --> 00:30:39.175]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:03.814]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:04.174 --> 00:31:13.003]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:13.323 --> 00:31:18.008]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:18.468 --> 00:31:25.192]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:37.360]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.306]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:44.808]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:51.196]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:07.587]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.027 --> 00:32:12.268]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:12.488 --> 00:32:19.530]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:26.012]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.372]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:30.675]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.857]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:49.152]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[00:33:13.107 --> 00:33:18.108]  This country isn't America if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:22.769]  And that's all being dismantled right now.
[00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:29.851]  And they try a lot of different bait-and-switch, really sophisticated lies and propaganda on you.
[00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:36.732]  But if you're informed on the facts of the type of world that's being set up, if you know what the New World Order's goals are,
[00:33:37.498 --> 00:33:45.081]  And if you read their own documents, and their own policy reports, and industry publications, you can find out everything.
[00:33:46.822 --> 00:33:48.402]  Again, you have different types of media.
[00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:54.425]  You have the mass media that most people get their news from, though that's changing, you know, the nightly news, and then you've got
[00:33:55.491 --> 00:34:02.235]  Kind of the more high-brow publications, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, that people who think they're in the know read.
[00:34:02.496 --> 00:34:05.057]  Why, I spend 30 minutes a day reading the newspaper.
[00:34:05.457 --> 00:34:07.359]  I consider myself very informed.
[00:34:08.799 --> 00:34:20.927]  And then you've got individuals who are real researchers who spend hours every day reading government documents, reading legislation, and even most of those folks I talk to don't know about industry publications, don't know about the trade publications.
[00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:23.444]  Well, that's where you learn about all of it.
[00:34:23.544 --> 00:34:30.889]  Where, you know, our company's been contracted to put the face scanning and license plate scanning software into all the cameras!
[00:34:31.858 --> 00:34:35.981]  And we're putting in the systems for when the new citizen draft comes up.
[00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:43.888]  We've got our contract where citizens will be forced to sit at computer screens looking at surveillance cameras from around the country spying on citizens.
[00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:57.758]  Or there's going to be cameras in all cars scanning your faces and tracking your every move hooked into our new AI computers that record every word you say and what you're saying and doing and report it back.
[00:34:58.039 --> 00:35:00.881]  Why, it'll save lives and stop family violence.
[00:35:03.092 --> 00:35:08.538]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone when you actually start reading the industry publications.
[00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:17.006]  Which, by the way, we link to a lot of these industry publications every day on InfoWars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:18.227 --> 00:35:20.309]  And you can go read what they're saying, what they're doing.
[00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:24.914]  The stuff you're never going to see in the news wires, much less in your newspapers.
[00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:47.624]  And so after you've read all this, because these companies love to brag about what they're doing, and after you've read the legislation, then when you hear a politician on the air talking about how they're stopping illegal aliens with a national ID card, well, you would have read Ron Paul's analysis of the bill, where he breaks down how it gives amnesty to the illegal aliens.
[00:35:48.365 --> 00:35:49.566]  The complete opposite!
[00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:52.649]  I mean, I just can't get over this.
[00:35:53.928 --> 00:36:09.978]  And then I have to hear Michael McCall and a phony conservative, I mean, Janet Reno's cover-up artist, along with Lamar Smith, who's hailed as a conservative, on the radio telling me how good the National ID Card is to stop the illegal aliens!
[00:36:10.958 --> 00:36:12.019]  And they're not stupid!
[00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:16.542]  They're both on different talk shows saying the exact same things.
[00:36:16.582 --> 00:36:20.224]  I mean, it was line for line, word for word.
[00:36:21.485 --> 00:36:23.626]  And I just see this propaganda everywhere.
[00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:26.819]  It's sick, folks.
[00:36:26.879 --> 00:36:29.000]  Let's talk to Nick in Michigan.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.800]  Nick, you're on the air.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.240]  Go ahead.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.221]  Hey, Alex.
[00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:44.344]  You know, I was at work yesterday, and I get the mail, and we get a newsgram from California, and it's from a medical association.
[00:36:44.384 --> 00:36:46.125]  It's an interesting cover story.
[00:36:46.545 --> 00:36:49.466]  How to tell if the person sitting next to you is crazy.
[00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:54.607]  And it goes to say that you don't need to be a trained psychologist to diagnose somebody who's crazy.
[00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:59.674]  And I'm going to send you the article, because I think you'd find it very interesting, and I highlighted a few lines here.
[00:36:59.694 --> 00:37:06.318]  Well, they have hundreds of thousands of school teachers and school counselors and school nurses pushing Ritalin and Prozac on the children.
[00:37:06.818 --> 00:37:17.485]  Yeah, it goes like, one part says, when we ask this person how he or she is, what he or she has been doing for the past month or so, he may say something like, I've been walking on water.
[00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:19.686]  Well, that's just a regular expression, as you know.
[00:37:20.502 --> 00:37:25.005]  Um, and then it goes on to say, knowing such a claim can be irrational, we may ask for an explanation.
[00:37:25.366 --> 00:37:30.790]  Yeah, well, I walk on the surface of the water every morning, precisely at 540 AM, is the sort of reply one might get.
[00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:37.034]  Uh, and then it goes on to say... It tells you, you need to help this person by reporting them.
[00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:45.100]  Right, because what is most interesting is that there are many people who act, think, and feel in ways most people would regard as strange, peculiar, and weird.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.582]  And it just goes on to say about predictive, uh,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.542]  Well, this is the new thing.
[00:37:49.562 --> 00:37:52.166]  The government tries to get control of you through welfare,
[00:38:04.594 --> 00:38:12.820]  They try to get control of you by getting you to sign on to things like the military, where then you lose a lot of your rights.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.842]  They try to get you into the criminal system, the criminal injustice system.
[00:38:17.463 --> 00:38:19.945]  And the new thing is getting you into psychiatry.
[00:38:20.005 --> 00:38:23.207]  And you think it's bad with the drugging of children, folks?
[00:38:24.087 --> 00:38:25.448]  15% of them now on it.
[00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:26.448]  10% of adults on it.
[00:38:26.988 --> 00:38:30.009]  Now they're saying the goal is to get 50% of us on it.
[00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:33.170]  And they're going to have the government try to force us all onto it.
[00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:38.332]  And yes, they're teaching everyone how to be psychological spies.
[00:38:38.372 --> 00:38:39.212]  Thought police.
[00:38:39.232 --> 00:38:44.293]  It says if you dress kind of shabby or you're not well kept it means you're mentally ill.
[00:38:44.634 --> 00:38:45.634]  It says this right here.
[00:38:45.654 --> 00:38:46.274]  I have it in front of me.
[00:38:46.394 --> 00:38:48.035]  And does it tell you how to report it?
[00:38:48.455 --> 00:38:50.115]  It doesn't tell you how to report it.
[00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:52.596]  It's written by a... Well what's the point of it then?
[00:38:54.050 --> 00:39:01.795]  It doesn't say, you know, to go report it, but it's just like, it's more of an FYI for the people who subscribe to this sort of newsgram, I guess.
[00:39:03.296 --> 00:39:09.540]  I don't know, it was, I asked my boss if I could have it, he said, yes, next employees go ahead and take it, I don't care.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.141]  So, that's how I got a hold of it.
[00:39:12.162 --> 00:39:14.843]  So it's basically just propaganda they sent out to you.
[00:39:15.123 --> 00:39:15.824]  Right, exactly.
[00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:19.086]  Well, sir, you don't think government is God.
[00:39:19.146 --> 00:39:21.486]  You think the government needs to be watched and controlled.
[00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:25.267]  You're as insane as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[00:39:25.567 --> 00:39:27.508]  I thought you might find it interesting.
[00:39:27.568 --> 00:39:28.268]  Thanks for your time.
[00:39:28.688 --> 00:39:29.108]  Thank you.
[00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:30.128]  Yeah, send it to me.
[00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:31.509]  I'd like to see it, Nick.
[00:39:32.029 --> 00:39:33.429]  Bill in New York.
[00:39:33.529 --> 00:39:34.269]  Bill, go ahead.
[00:39:34.949 --> 00:39:35.450]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.130]  How are you today?
[00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.590]  Oh, I'm doing okay.
[00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.290]  I'm insane.
[00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:43.512]  Just wanted to tell you, we all here appreciate the great job you do.
[00:39:44.532 --> 00:39:45.332]  And keep it up.
[00:39:46.605 --> 00:39:49.227]  My family and friends, we really like it.
[00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:58.692]  And I just wanted to warn you, tomorrow we gotta go through that ugly display in Washington of the inauguration and all of that.
[00:39:59.352 --> 00:39:59.612]  Hello?
[00:40:00.113 --> 00:40:00.453]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:00.933 --> 00:40:13.460]  And, um, the worst part is watching Bush swear on his Bible to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:40:14.628 --> 00:40:15.329]  Truly sickening.
[00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:19.895]  While Bush is just a puppet, it is true that he will be violating his oath.
[00:40:20.436 --> 00:40:22.758]  He's violated the oath he took four years ago.
[00:40:22.779 --> 00:40:23.279]  Right.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.622]  And he's going to be violating his oath again.
[00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:30.328]  But I guess giving up our freedoms is what America's all about.
[00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:32.451]  Why isn't he held accountable?
[00:40:33.399 --> 00:40:36.720]  Well again, the globalists use presidents as a shield.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:45.282]  You know, we blame Bill Clinton, we blame George Bush, we blame Ronald Reagan, we blame Jimmy Carter for the tyranny.
[00:40:45.302 --> 00:40:50.764]  You know, we blame Jimmy Carter for giving up the Panama Canal, who now has been taken over by the Communist Chinese.
[00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:57.253]  But then when George Bush got into office, he went ahead and let that go forward, just like Bill Clinton did.
[00:40:57.634 --> 00:40:59.014]  They're all just puppets, sir.
[00:40:59.054 --> 00:40:59.915]  They're just front men.
[00:41:00.275 --> 00:41:01.055]  Yeah, I understand.
[00:41:01.495 --> 00:41:05.237]  And so we spend a lot of our time and energy focusing in on them, which I do, too.
[00:41:05.877 --> 00:41:08.998]  And really, overall, it's a distraction to the overall system.
[00:41:09.498 --> 00:41:10.079]  I understand.
[00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:16.421]  Well, last time I know, he swore on the Bible George Washington used.
[00:41:17.202 --> 00:41:20.363]  I don't know what he's going to use tomorrow, but whatever.
[00:41:21.223 --> 00:41:22.723]  But you keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:41:22.743 --> 00:41:25.144]  Thank you, Bill, and God bless you, and thanks for tuning in.
[00:41:26.004 --> 00:41:27.464]  Carlos in California.
[00:41:27.504 --> 00:41:28.304]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[00:41:29.465 --> 00:41:31.225]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:41:31.765 --> 00:41:33.285]  Thanks a lot for your show here.
[00:41:33.305 --> 00:41:34.026]  It's very interesting.
[00:41:34.046 --> 00:41:35.926]  Well, you guys are too good, but quit thanking me.
[00:41:35.966 --> 00:41:36.766]  Thanks for tuning in.
[00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:37.486]  Thanks for calling.
[00:41:38.226 --> 00:41:43.548]  Alex, you know, I've been pondering quite a bit about the number 11 in our 9-11.
[00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:46.468]  I mean, there's just too many 11s.
[00:41:46.488 --> 00:41:46.948]  9-1-1 equals 11.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:57.986]  When you start to look at the tragedy that happened on 9-11, the towers themselves make up an 11.
[00:41:59.307 --> 00:42:06.934]  And then you start thinking that in 1990, on September the 11th, Mr. George Bush Sr.
[00:42:07.675 --> 00:42:09.276]  made his New World Order speech.
[00:42:10.517 --> 00:42:17.143]  And you go back through history and you'll see other events that are crucial to the New World Order occurring on 9-11.
[00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:28.181]  The overthrow of Salvador Agende by the Kissinger orchestrated coup happened on September 11th, including the powers themselves.
[00:42:28.682 --> 00:42:34.568]  Pinochet's takeover and mass extermination program started on 9-11.
[00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:40.074]  Yes, and then you know the construction of the powers themselves was begun by
[00:42:41.437 --> 00:42:43.599]  A lot of followers on September 11, 1973, I believe.
[00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:01.606]  Of 9-11, the New York Lottery came up 9-11.
[00:43:01.926 --> 00:43:04.247]  Not the Illinois Lottery, not the Texas Lottery.
[00:43:04.607 --> 00:43:06.489]  The New York Lottery came up 9-11.
[00:43:06.769 --> 00:43:12.832]  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on the one-year anniversary came up 9-11.0000.
[00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:15.874]  Over 1 out of 14 billion is the chances on that.
[00:43:17.155 --> 00:43:19.396]  The Madrid bombing happened on 3-11.
[00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:24.858]  And that was 911 days after 9-11.
[00:43:24.878 --> 00:43:30.002]  And there are hundreds and hundreds of examples of this.
[00:43:30.062 --> 00:43:32.683]  Two of the flights were 11.
[00:43:32.723 --> 00:43:34.024]  11-11-11-11-11.
[00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:38.627]  And yes, they're obsessed with that number.
[00:43:39.048 --> 00:43:40.829]  And of course, then the emergency number.
[00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:42.590]  You call the government for help.
[00:43:44.323 --> 00:43:51.868]  I love these people at stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, whatever, with the little emergency tags, panic buttons around their necks.
[00:43:51.988 --> 00:43:52.629]  Oh, help me!
[00:43:52.749 --> 00:43:53.289]  Save me!
[00:43:53.509 --> 00:43:55.130]  You know, don't have a gun to defend yourself.
[00:43:55.471 --> 00:43:57.632]  Again, they call 9-11.
[00:43:58.513 --> 00:43:59.253]  So, yes, sir.
[00:44:00.414 --> 00:44:04.296]  And you know, and then you go on and on and on, and Jasper Arafat died on 11-11.
[00:44:04.316 --> 00:44:04.617]  I mean...
[00:44:09.169 --> 00:44:10.971]  The history is saturated with 11.
[00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:16.734]  What is the significance of 11 to the new world order, Alex?
[00:44:17.375 --> 00:44:18.235]  Do you have any idea?
[00:44:19.176 --> 00:44:21.497]  Well, you know, I'll talk about issues like this.
[00:44:21.578 --> 00:44:22.338]  It's real.
[00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:23.359]  Something is there.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.343]  It's a calling card that the globalists leave.
[00:44:29.483 --> 00:44:37.288]  Most psychopaths, whether it's a local, individual, lone wolf psychopath, or these organized crime syndicates run by societies,
[00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.830]  Or syndicates of psychopaths.
[00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.131]  They like to leave calling cards.
[00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:44.911]  And it's called magical thinking.
[00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:50.573]  And most lunatics are insane and have magical thinking.
[00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:54.213]  And they do it to leave their calling card.
[00:44:54.774 --> 00:45:02.615]  It's kind of like their, you know, it's taking, well, you know, say baseball players are legendarily superstitious.
[00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:06.236]  Well, it's taking superstition to the tenth degree.
[00:45:08.396 --> 00:45:20.180]  Well, you know, I believe that the next 9-11, should it occur, I believe the New World Order is going to resort to using a numerical number that's meaningful to them.
[00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:30.004]  Now, I understand that April the 19th is another day which they hold great esteem to.
[00:45:30.164 --> 00:45:36.806]  Supposedly, from what I heard, April the 19th is the day where the Druids commemorate
[00:45:38.014 --> 00:45:41.897]  Uh, a bloodbath for the Godball, B-A-L, the fun Godball.
[00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:45.941]  So I'm just wondering what their next pick is going to be.
[00:45:48.243 --> 00:45:50.024]  Well, a lot has happened in history.
[00:45:50.044 --> 00:45:53.087]  You know, the Revolutionary War started on April 19th.
[00:45:54.988 --> 00:45:58.831]  Uh, the British started going around confiscating the rifles on April 19th.
[00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:01.574]  And Oklahoma City happened on April 19th.
[00:46:01.614 --> 00:46:05.057]  The torching of the Waco Church was on April 19th.
[00:46:06.304 --> 00:46:12.528]  Uh, there are just a lot of, but again, I like to predominantly stick to things we can totally prove.
[00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:15.610]  A lot of people hear us talking about this and they're just not going to get it.
[00:46:16.311 --> 00:46:18.932]  Uh, but when you start investigating it, I mean, it's not an accident.
[00:46:19.393 --> 00:46:25.457]  Folks, the Chicago Mercantile, number one, it never comes up with a point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero behind it.
[00:46:26.437 --> 00:46:26.718]  Okay?
[00:46:26.738 --> 00:46:28.078]  I mean, that's billions to one.
[00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:31.341]  But having a 9-11 in front of it is impossible.
[00:46:32.401 --> 00:46:33.302]  Is impossible.
[00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:37.649]  And it just shows how the mercantile is completely staged.
[00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:39.751]  They totally control the stock markets.
[00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:40.631]  They control it all.
[00:46:41.211 --> 00:46:45.574]  They have the Plunge Protection Team of the Federal Reserve designed to control the stock market.
[00:46:45.614 --> 00:46:46.235]  That's admitted.
[00:46:46.475 --> 00:46:49.797]  But they can control it right down to the point it closes on.
[00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:52.699]  Because they don't even take the real numbers.
[00:46:52.759 --> 00:46:54.880]  At the end of the day, they just tell you what the numbers are.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.721]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:58.683]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[00:47:00.764 --> 00:47:01.704]  Rodney in Texas.
[00:47:01.724 --> 00:47:02.425]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:04.369]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:05.029]  Good, sir.
[00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:06.610]  Yeah, I'm glad to talk to you.
[00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:16.114]  I haven't talked with you in over a year, and I wanted to get your sense of the phony hearings with Condoleezza Rice this morning.
[00:47:17.074 --> 00:47:24.178]  I tuned in before C-SPAN came on air, and I heard a little exchange between her and Barbara Boxer.
[00:47:24.698 --> 00:47:31.341]  But the thing that caught my ear was when Condoleezza Rice basically told Barbara Boxer
[00:47:32.116 --> 00:47:35.879]  How dare you entomb my character?
[00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:40.502]  How dare you question my credibility?
[00:47:40.842 --> 00:47:42.263]  How dare you do this?
[00:47:42.283 --> 00:47:47.307]  And the senator basically was saying, but these are your own words.
[00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:49.208]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:47:49.888 --> 00:47:50.989]  These are not my words.
[00:47:51.049 --> 00:47:51.950]  These are your words.
[00:47:52.515 --> 00:47:55.437]  Well, again, this is part of WWF wrestling.
[00:47:56.057 --> 00:47:58.498]  Barbara Boxer and her having a staged event.
[00:47:58.538 --> 00:47:59.519]  That's all it is.
[00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:05.802]  You know, it's like when, again, when the Undertaker gets in a fight with The Rock, you know, it isn't real.
[00:48:05.822 --> 00:48:07.363]  They're there screaming at each other.
[00:48:08.044 --> 00:48:10.505]  And then the manager comes over and tells them to stop it.
[00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:15.728]  Take the wrestling example and then put it over to the committee hearings.
[00:48:16.188 --> 00:48:17.369]  I didn't read the text of that.
[00:48:17.389 --> 00:48:18.009]  I didn't see it.
[00:48:18.029 --> 00:48:20.731]  If somebody's got it on video, please send it to me.
[00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:21.151]  But look,
[00:48:23.391 --> 00:48:27.675]  She has been caught lying, bull-faced lying over and over and over again.
[00:48:27.715 --> 00:48:31.318]  We never heard of a plan to fly hijacked planes into buildings.
[00:48:31.718 --> 00:48:34.400]  Then you get her memo, and it says specifically that.
[00:48:35.361 --> 00:48:42.267]  And people bring this up, and she... I saw photos of her, you know, raising her fist and shaking it at Boxer.
[00:48:42.567 --> 00:48:45.069]  But what they do is they know the conservatives hate Boxer.
[00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:45.769]  I don't like her.
[00:48:45.869 --> 00:48:46.310]  Gun grab her.
[00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:52.213]  And so they know people that automatically go, man, Rice must be good at boxers against her.
[00:48:52.574 --> 00:48:55.956]  So again, it's all part of this fake left-right paradigm.
[00:48:55.996 --> 00:48:59.418]  But it's like Rumsfeld said over a hundred times.
[00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.059]  He has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:49:01.399 --> 00:49:03.160]  We know they're in the Tikrit area.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.422]  We know they're in the area around Baghdad.
[00:49:07.603 --> 00:49:09.424]  We know that this is going on.
[00:49:10.726 --> 00:49:11.667]  We know where they're at.
[00:49:11.707 --> 00:49:12.627]  We're going to get them.
[00:49:13.008 --> 00:49:16.410]  And then he got up on Face the Nation and said, I never said that.
[00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:17.551]  How dare you?
[00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:19.092]  That's an urban legend.
[00:49:19.493 --> 00:49:21.234]  And so they just played the clip of him saying it.
[00:49:22.175 --> 00:49:23.536]  And then he started fumbling.
[00:49:23.576 --> 00:49:25.577]  But no one ever really calls them on this.
[00:49:26.057 --> 00:49:29.940]  And yes, Condoleezza Rice is a congenital liar.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.785]  We all heard her lie over and over again about weapons of mass destruction, about
[00:49:37.288 --> 00:49:40.830]  Never knowing of plans to hijack planes and fly them into buildings.
[00:49:42.932 --> 00:49:46.714]  Again, they have a liberal Democrat come out and challenge her.
[00:49:47.475 --> 00:49:48.175]  I'm just sick of her.
[00:49:48.596 --> 00:49:49.296]  But you're right.
[00:49:49.556 --> 00:49:53.679]  No doubt, after the staged exchange there,
[00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:57.104]  They both probably went out and had martinis together.
[00:49:57.944 --> 00:50:00.086]  But of course, that's just speculation.
[00:50:00.146 --> 00:50:08.474]  But since we all know it was staged, that's probably closer to the truth than some of the things that we've heard come out of Condoleezza Rice's mouth.
[00:50:08.854 --> 00:50:13.418]  But I mean, how can Rumsfeld say, how dare you say that when we all saw it on TV?
[00:50:13.438 --> 00:50:15.720]  I mean, they're living in la-la land.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.344]  Well, and Condoleezza Rice actually said that she had evidence
[00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:29.026]  She had evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9-11.
[00:50:29.066 --> 00:50:33.468]  She said, and we will present this evidence in due time.
[00:50:33.608 --> 00:50:40.232]  And to this day, from what I understand, it hasn't been presented by Condoleezza Rice.
[00:50:40.553 --> 00:50:43.955]  Nor have any questions been asked of her about that evidence.
[00:50:44.715 --> 00:50:49.458]  Well, Condoleezza Rice is a piece of work, and she's a power-mad demon like the rest of them.
[00:50:50.712 --> 00:50:52.293]  She's going to be our new Secretary of State.
[00:50:52.493 --> 00:50:53.234]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:53.274 --> 00:50:55.035]  We'll be back with more news and information.
[00:50:55.055 --> 00:50:59.737]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.218 --> 00:51:01.718]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:01.919 --> 00:51:05.000]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:09.063]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:09.103 --> 00:51:13.325]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:13.665 --> 00:51:17.448]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:17.588 --> 00:51:19.389]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:22.870]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:27.632]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:30.833]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:31.013 --> 00:51:33.874]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:34.374 --> 00:51:40.476]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:41.016 --> 00:51:44.799]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:55:13.622 --> 00:55:18.445]  You got a bunch of lying control freaks that are good at manipulating you in control.
[00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:21.727]  And until we wake up to that, things are just going to get worse.
[00:55:22.207 --> 00:55:31.854]  They're setting up this police state so they can take your pension funds, so they can draft you into the military in a war for empire, so they can turn you into good little slaves for social engineering.
[00:55:32.434 --> 00:55:33.595]  And I'm not going along with it.
[00:55:34.261 --> 00:55:48.990]  And one of my best films for understanding the big, wide scope of what the New World Order is, who the neocons are, the fake left-right paradigm, Patriot Act II, Homeland Security, foreign troops, implantable microchips, government-sponsored terror.
[00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:51.732]  It just covers a wide range of subjects.
[00:55:51.792 --> 00:55:54.454]  It's two hours and 44 minutes long.
[00:55:54.474 --> 00:55:56.055]  It's really three or four films in one.
[00:55:56.635 --> 00:55:59.357]  It's Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:56:00.993 --> 00:56:10.080]  Then I have Matrix of Evil, where we interview Ron Paul and Colonel Craig Roberts and a bunch of other experts and go through the control grid that's being set up.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.021]  That film is great.
[00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:12.722]  A little over two hours long.
[00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:15.124]  It's, again, Matrix of Evil.
[00:56:15.424 --> 00:56:20.307]  My newest film is American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:56:20.788 --> 00:56:22.549]  Gets into how that was a staged event.
[00:56:22.929 --> 00:56:24.751]  Covers the latest 9-11 information.
[00:56:25.914 --> 00:56:32.835]  And still, if you buy one of 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, my permanent 9-11 film, for the regular price, each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:37.716]  You buy four or five copies to give as gifts, or just make copies of one copy.
[00:56:37.736 --> 00:56:39.197]  Just make copies and give them out to people.
[00:56:39.457 --> 00:56:44.418]  But at $5.95, why not just buy the originals and give those to people, or sell them at your store and make a profit?
[00:56:44.498 --> 00:56:45.098]  I don't care.
[00:56:45.938 --> 00:56:47.438]  I just want to get the information out.
[00:56:47.498 --> 00:56:50.999]  I'm offering American dictators for $5.95 when you buy one copy for $19.95.
[00:56:52.549 --> 00:57:06.057]  Go to InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com Peruse the SafeSecure online shopping cart and order online there or simply call toll free 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 Please take action today!
[00:57:06.077 --> 00:57:08.139]  888-253-3139 Alright, here's the Scotsman
[00:57:21.986 --> 00:57:23.007]  Came out yesterday.
[00:57:23.127 --> 00:57:25.208]  So, are you in the mood for a drive?
[00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:45.241]  And it says, machines which respond to their owners' emotions may seem like science fiction fantasy, but while the living androids portrayed in the blockbuster film, I, Robot, may never be built, one firm has developed an emotion sensor which could help cars of the future make better drivers out of us all.
[00:57:45.942 --> 00:57:58.912]  The computer software, which could soon be used in Toyota cars, and we have a link to where Toyota, a year ago, is already buying this and putting it in some new cars, can take steps to tackle potential road rage and drowsiness.
[00:57:59.193 --> 00:58:06.519]  The system works by monitoring the driver's speech for signs of certain types of behavior and talking appropriate action.
[00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:10.782]  And it warns you and then it calls the police on you.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:38.703]  And, in case you don't think this is coming, Ergonomics Today, last week, or week and a half ago, big brother behind the wheel of Watts Drivers, the NHTS, the Highway Traffic Safety Administration, wants to make it a law that all new cars will have a camera watching you, hooked into an embedded cell phone that goes back to the police department, and it watches you for signs of drowsiness, or yelling at your wife, and just watches you!
[00:58:38.723 --> 00:58:40.224]  It's freedom!
[00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.091]  And they're trying to do it.
[00:58:42.672 --> 00:58:45.575]  By the way, every road in America is about to be turned into a toll road.
[00:58:46.156 --> 00:58:46.857]  That's official.
[00:58:47.297 --> 00:58:49.219]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.503]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filter.
[00:58:56.467 --> 00:58:57.108]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.769 --> 00:58:58.730]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.392 --> 00:59:00.353]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:02.694]  Into the second hour, our great lordship.
[00:59:02.854 --> 00:59:08.297]  The Associated Press has reported you're not allowed to look in the eyes at the inauguration or you'll be arrested.
[00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:33.116]  Our great Lordship has turned, according to even mainstream reports, D.C.
[00:59:33.617 --> 00:59:37.981]  into the second most secure area in the world next to the Green Zone in Baghdad.
[00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.503]  Total martial law.
[00:59:40.063 --> 00:59:42.465]  Governor Ridge says that this is a test.
[00:59:42.525 --> 00:59:44.227]  It's on the Army's website, a speech he gave.
[00:59:44.688 --> 00:59:46.930]  A test of what we're going to do in the rest of the country.
[00:59:48.095 --> 00:59:56.222]  Merging the military and the police, the end of posse comitatus, the end of the Tenth Amendment, the end of freedom, if we put up with it.
[00:59:56.482 --> 01:00:00.065]  Has nothing to do with security, training you how to be a good little slave.
[01:00:01.586 --> 01:00:05.049]  Also, there's more discussions of attacking Iran and Syria, we'll be getting into that.
[01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:16.258]  But coming up in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Troy Hurtubise, and he is a scientist and inventor, quite an amazing individual,
[01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:20.477]  We've got a little clip from the Discovery Channel that interviewed him.
[01:00:20.557 --> 01:00:27.422]  It's off the web, so it's not the best, but that's coming up right before we talk to him here in just a few minutes.
[01:00:28.183 --> 01:00:33.607]  And we'll get into how his inventions are now being picked up by the Defense Department.
[01:00:35.348 --> 01:00:37.089]  Systems that look through walls.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:40.171]  Exoskeleton body armor.
[01:00:41.652 --> 01:00:45.275]  Fireproof compounds.
[01:00:46.107 --> 01:00:48.229]  A very interesting individual.
[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:56.936]  And he is only, only 33 years old.
[01:00:57.056 --> 01:01:05.422]  So, we'll be talking to Troy Kurtabish coming up here in just a little while.
[01:01:05.522 --> 01:01:08.585]  You do not want to miss this interview.
[01:01:09.325 --> 01:01:15.010]  And then later, of course, we'll go back to your calls and get into all this other news.
[01:01:16.804 --> 01:01:38.989]  And perhaps later in the broadcast, I want to read a little bit of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, because George Walker Bush, George W., the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, U.N.-loving neocon, is going to be swearing on the Bible tomorrow to protect and defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.
[01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:41.390]  And he couldn't be doing
[01:01:42.992 --> 01:01:46.254]  He couldn't be going further from that document with what he's doing.
[01:01:46.274 --> 01:01:48.676]  Now again, Bush obviously isn't really doing any of this.
[01:01:48.736 --> 01:01:50.797]  Bush is nothing more than a puppet.
[01:01:51.818 --> 01:01:55.760]  But it's still important to really remember what America is all about.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.602]  It's kind of a forgotten science.
[01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:01.083]  A forgotten document, the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:05.406]  A lot of people will tell you they have all these rights, but they don't know what their rights are.
[01:02:06.343 --> 01:02:23.850]  I would point out again that the Bill of Rights and Constitution doesn't give you rights, it points out the organic, God-given rights that we are born with innately, to not be slaves, to not be abused, to not be minions of this global crime syndicate.
[01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.011]  So that is coming up.
[01:02:26.711 --> 01:02:30.732]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:02:31.473 --> 01:02:32.953]  And who's up next here first?
[01:02:33.814 --> 01:02:34.934]  Barton, Texas, go ahead.
[01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:44.691]  Hey Alex, I was wondering if you, I'm sure you heard about it, but I just, it totally floored me watching this program the other night called Smallpox.
[01:02:45.591 --> 01:02:53.475]  If there was ever, or outbreak, if there was ever some propaganda on getting inoculations, that was it right there.
[01:02:54.122 --> 01:02:56.023]  Yes, millions are dying.
[01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:57.423]  The bio-attack has begun.
[01:02:57.463 --> 01:02:59.044]  We've all got to give up all our freedom.
[01:02:59.144 --> 01:03:01.165]  Oh, no, but I mean, it's so intense.
[01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:03.686]  I mean, it is literally right out of conditioning.
[01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:06.967]  I mean, the woman who resisted first, she tells them they're right.
[01:03:07.027 --> 01:03:08.488]  They tell her they're going to arrest her.
[01:03:09.108 --> 01:03:15.230]  Her son ends up dying, and the whole, you know, under-message is that maybe she had just gone with them.
[01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.411]  Well, no, it's her fault.
[01:03:16.671 --> 01:03:18.812]  Standing up for her rights killed her child.
[01:03:18.932 --> 01:03:19.612]  She is evil!
[01:03:20.872 --> 01:03:21.933]  Rights are evil!
[01:03:22.816 --> 01:03:27.440]  So, I mean, I just, the level of psychological programming on that was intense.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.804]  If you ever get a chance to watch it, I mean, it's textbook psychological... Well, I read the synopsis of it.
[01:03:33.285 --> 01:03:34.546]  That was on FX, right?
[01:03:34.966 --> 01:03:35.186]  Yes.
[01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:37.128]  Send me a copy of it.
[01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:37.688]  Anything else?
[01:03:38.449 --> 01:03:42.032]  Um, are you going to be going to this Indy Media Conference that's coming up in Austin?
[01:03:42.892 --> 01:03:43.593]  I might do that!
[01:03:43.613 --> 01:03:45.354]  Alright, cool, cool.
[01:03:45.394 --> 01:03:46.755]  I hope we get to run into you up there.
[01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:47.636]  Alright, brother.
[01:03:47.676 --> 01:03:48.137]  Take care.
[01:03:48.677 --> 01:03:49.658]  We'll be back with our guest.
[01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.476]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:03:54.676 --> 01:04:02.020]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.742]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:04:07.003 --> 01:04:16.848]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:04:17.609 --> 01:04:21.273]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:24.116]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:04:24.396 --> 01:04:30.323]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.105]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:04:32.385 --> 01:04:33.266]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:04:33.366 --> 01:04:36.350]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.411]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:04:37.451 --> 01:04:37.631]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:40.775]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:04:40.795 --> 01:04:41.756]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:04:52.378 --> 01:04:53.158]  Terrorism!
[01:04:53.299 --> 01:04:54.059]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.159 --> 01:05:00.222]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallouts, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:00.482 --> 01:05:02.083]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:02.303 --> 01:05:04.784]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.184 --> 01:05:19.752]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:20.112]  government.
[01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:22.093]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.453 --> 01:05:28.355]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:33.016]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:33.256 --> 01:05:38.878]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:40.698]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.718 --> 01:05:41.119]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.139 --> 01:05:42.659]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:51.664 --> 01:05:56.006]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:56.206 --> 01:06:00.608]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:00.768 --> 01:06:05.130]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.511]  The New World Order.
[01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:08.292]  Panama.
[01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:12.536]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:12.596 --> 01:06:19.542]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:19.662 --> 01:06:21.724]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.004 --> 01:06:32.473]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:32.674 --> 01:06:33.194]  If you want to
[01:06:33.234 --> 01:06:36.055]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:06.911]  Alright, I grabbed this clip off the internet, so it's not the best.
[01:07:08.212 --> 01:07:12.515]  But I think it gets the point across better than any introduction I can do.
[01:07:12.535 --> 01:07:20.201]  Troy Hurtubise is an incredible inventor, and he joins us from Canada.
[01:07:20.221 --> 01:07:25.405]  So I want to go ahead and play just a few minutes of this Discovery Channel piece, and then we'll go to our guest.
[01:07:25.425 --> 01:07:28.707]  But I think after hearing this, you'll know why we've got him on the broadcast.
[01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:29.168]  Here it is.
[01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:31.911]  This is my crazy horse right here.
[01:07:32.371 --> 01:07:33.892]  No bullets or arrows will ever touch her.
[01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:41.355]  There have been a lot of big days in the life of Troy Herchubis, but today could end up being the biggest.
[01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:42.575]  There you go.
[01:07:43.676 --> 01:07:47.037]  Troy has arranged a demonstration of his latest invention.
[01:07:47.577 --> 01:07:51.239]  He thinks it could save lives, and he plans to prove it.
[01:07:51.259 --> 01:07:58.042]  This light little bag right here will stop any handgun, any shotgun, any machine gun, any grenades,
[01:07:58.843 --> 01:07:59.763]  But not a landmine.
[01:07:59.823 --> 01:08:00.384]  Not one of them.
[01:08:01.224 --> 01:08:01.804]  But two.
[01:08:02.224 --> 01:08:06.186]  He calls these bags Light Infantry Military Blast Cushions.
[01:08:06.786 --> 01:08:08.867]  It's the cheapest, lightest product on the market.
[01:08:09.227 --> 01:08:11.648]  And it's protection is Herculean.
[01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:15.229]  Protection is something Troy knows an awful lot about.
[01:08:16.366 --> 01:08:22.369]  His first invention was an armored suit designed to protect the wearer against a grizzly bear attack.
[01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:27.432]  That suit kept Troy alive throughout some extreme and punishing tests.
[01:08:28.132 --> 01:08:30.994]  It could stand up to any impact he threw at it.
[01:08:31.494 --> 01:08:36.076]  But as Troy painfully discovered one day, the suit wasn't fireproof.
[01:08:36.937 --> 01:08:41.239]  So he went into his lab and invented what he calls fire paste.
[01:08:41.903 --> 01:08:47.367]  He won't say what's in it, but he will risk his life demonstrating that it works.
[01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:51.310]  Troy has another invention up his sleeves.
[01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:53.612]  A very strong paste called 1313.
[01:08:54.313 --> 01:08:57.936]  A six month old child can pull out a cart.
[01:09:00.077 --> 01:09:01.078]  These are the C2 pads.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:03.560]  Coated.
[01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:06.292]  With the 1313 solution.
[01:09:06.612 --> 01:09:08.633]  Stuff under a 20 ton press for 24 hours.
[01:09:08.973 --> 01:09:10.233]  This'll stop bullets.
[01:09:10.873 --> 01:09:13.174]  It's 105 times stronger than steel pound for pound.
[01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:16.034]  So, Troy knew how to make things strong.
[01:09:16.574 --> 01:09:19.895]  He could make them fireproof, and he could make them blastproof.
[01:09:20.715 --> 01:09:23.656]  And then something happened to make him combine the three.
[01:09:24.336 --> 01:09:27.416]  The deaths of two Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.
[01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:30.477]  Killed when their jeep ran over a landmine.
[01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:41.905]  When Troy heard about that attack, and similar deadly assaults against Coalition soldiers in Iraq, he got angry, because he knew he had the technology to protect them.
[01:09:43.146 --> 01:09:55.408]  These glass bags are made up of 60 layers of Kevlar, steel plates, aluminum plates, ceramic shields, and Troy's secret ingredients, fire paste and 1313.
[01:09:56.148 --> 01:09:59.069]  Now that he's made them, he wants them in war zones.
[01:09:59.938 --> 01:10:01.319]  There's men and women in uniform.
[01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:07.481]  Just normal 19, 20, 21 year old kids getting killed over there for no reason!
[01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:12.283]  If Troy seems a little agitated, it's because this crusade is personal.
[01:10:12.783 --> 01:10:15.824]  His little brother Blair is a private in the armed forces.
[01:10:16.716 --> 01:10:21.677]  Just the thought of my baby brother, who is my life, getting a six-month tour over there.
[01:10:22.077 --> 01:10:26.658]  Troy desperately wants to see his cushions on Jeeps in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:10:27.278 --> 01:10:34.280]  So today, he's invited a representative of the Canadian military to take a look at his cushions and see what they can do.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:42.862]  Troy hopes that Captain Mike Woyandek will be so impressed that he'll order up some tests and after that, get them to the soldiers.
[01:10:46.244 --> 01:10:46.884]  It's a great piece.
[01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:47.944]  It goes on and on.
[01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.105]  So many things he's invented.
[01:10:50.186 --> 01:10:54.308]  That's why I wanted to have Troy Hertubise on with us.
[01:10:54.508 --> 01:10:55.528]  Troy, thanks for coming on.
[01:10:55.948 --> 01:10:56.549]  No problem, Alex.
[01:10:56.629 --> 01:10:57.069]  It's a pleasure.
[01:10:58.009 --> 01:10:58.830]  You bet, my friend.
[01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.791]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:02.251]  I'm 41.
[01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:06.173]  I'm a natural resources technologist and a bear behavioral specialist.
[01:11:06.593 --> 01:11:10.215]  I live in the north and I basically study bears for a living.
[01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:13.497]  To do that, earlier on in college,
[01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:24.028]  Uh, looked at the problem like most biologists did and the problem was if you get close to grizzly bears and the experimentation goes awry in the field, um, the bear usually dies or, uh, the biologist does.
[01:11:24.369 --> 01:11:40.119]  So, uh, believe it or not, I was watching RoboCop when I first came out of college and I said if I had the time and the funds, I'd be able to build a suit like that, um, it'll allow me as a researcher to go in and do the, uh, research and then if things went awry and the bear attacked, uh, we wouldn't have to shoot the bear, I'd be okay and so would the bear.
[01:11:40.139 --> 01:11:41.760]  It's like a, think of a great white shark.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.661]  No cage, you're dead.
[01:11:43.181 --> 01:11:44.382]  Um, this is my mobile cage.
[01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:46.183]  So this is a bulletproof outfit.
[01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:48.365]  I mean, you ought to see it, folks.
[01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:50.167]  We've got a picture of it on Infowars.com.
[01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:16.913]  You can link through to news stories that have photos and video clips of it as well.
[01:12:17.893 --> 01:12:28.921]  But, I mean, literally somebody with one of these suits, as you build them up, the SWAT team leader could just walk right into the house and it wouldn't matter if the person was shooting at them, they could get in there and take them out.
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:30.002]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:30.042 --> 01:12:31.343]  I mean, they're completely bulletproof.
[01:12:32.183 --> 01:12:34.386]  Unfortunately, there's nothing in the world as bulletproof.
[01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:37.730]  You know, there's always a bigger bullet that can go through it or higher grains than that.
[01:12:38.471 --> 01:12:41.394]  But when you're talking about the limbic system, there is no bullet.
[01:12:41.935 --> 01:12:42.575]  I've had the best.
[01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:46.640]  I had 25-year Marines, two tours of Vietnam, sharpshooters, trained Navy SEALs.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.182]  They came down for the limbic test.
[01:12:48.882 --> 01:12:53.867]  They went from 223 penetrators to 308 snipers all the way up to elephant guns, 70mm.
[01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:55.448]  There's no bullet that can penetrate the bag.
[01:12:55.948 --> 01:12:57.610]  And there's no RPG that can get through it.
[01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.992]  And unfortunately they're not in Iraq, where they should be.
[01:13:00.392 --> 01:13:01.853]  And I don't ever think they will be.
[01:13:02.053 --> 01:13:04.035]  But, I mean, that's the politics of the day, right?
[01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:05.016]  Nobody really gives a damn.
[01:13:05.576 --> 01:13:09.220]  Well, why won't the Pentagon, if you've got something that RPGs don't go through?
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.100]  Because, you know what?
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:10.861]  I'm a Canadian hit.
[01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:12.342]  And I guess that's what it is.
[01:13:12.462 --> 01:13:15.084]  I sent 7,000 faxes.
[01:13:15.305 --> 01:13:16.626]  I have them all here, the two feet thick.
[01:13:17.265 --> 01:13:20.929]  A week before the Limbic, to invite all the politicians in the world.
[01:13:21.269 --> 01:13:28.838]  From Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld, Kerry, McCain, Prince Charles, both Clintons, the UN, everybody.
[01:13:28.998 --> 01:13:35.485]  The only two people that had the decency to respond, the only two, and it was a great honor, was President Clinton and Prince Charles.
[01:13:35.765 --> 01:13:36.646]  But of course they were busy.
[01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:45.777]  I sent the faxes and that same piece off Discovery Channel after they proved in a live field demonstration, those are RPGs, those are real bullets, that I have the answer.
[01:13:46.078 --> 01:13:47.419]  I was going to give it to the military free.
[01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:49.320]  Not interested in it.
[01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:55.165]  The kids out there are dying needlessly, not for the cause they're fighting, because their damn Hummers are useless.
[01:13:55.686 --> 01:14:01.931]  And all this crap that they're doing right now, Rumsfeld and that, upgrading it with plate armor, it does nothing.
[01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:02.531]  We already know that.
[01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:03.712]  I've already talked to the generals.
[01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:05.534]  I already have the facts from the scientists.
[01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:09.196]  So, I have been pushing and pushing and pushing, not even a call back.
[01:14:09.376 --> 01:14:12.638]  Well, you've got your little brother over there, and I know that you're upset about this.
[01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:13.938]  We have a lot of children listening.
[01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:16.039]  I just want to try to not get, you know, too upset.
[01:14:16.059 --> 01:14:16.820]  No, I understand that.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:21.622]  But, see, I have to field the calls from the American mothers, and I do, at least three a day.
[01:14:21.942 --> 01:14:25.424]  American mothers who have lost sons and daughters in Iraq.
[01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:26.845]  Now, what do I tell these poor women?
[01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:30.026]  Well, I understand, and I think it's admirable what you're doing, but...
[01:14:32.136 --> 01:14:32.937]  It's interesting, though.
[01:14:33.717 --> 01:14:36.859]  The government's got all different types of other armors they've developed.
[01:14:37.419 --> 01:14:38.580]  Which are useless, of course.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.181]  We already know that.
[01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:44.023]  But you're not even supposed to send Humvees into frontline combat, but they're doing it.
[01:14:44.544 --> 01:14:46.765]  Yeah, well, see, the whole thing is it wouldn't really make a difference.
[01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:48.886]  With the limbic system on it, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:49.907]  I mean, the limbic system...
[01:14:50.595 --> 01:14:52.095]  It can actually go on tanks.
[01:14:52.215 --> 01:14:54.496]  I mean, I can stop Hellfire missiles with the limbic system.
[01:14:56.596 --> 01:15:00.537]  Put it on the outside of the tank, similar to reactive armor.
[01:15:00.877 --> 01:15:01.277]  Absolutely.
[01:15:01.738 --> 01:15:02.418]  And it's dirt cheap.
[01:15:02.618 --> 01:15:04.418]  Dirt cheap, light, and it's got blunt trauma.
[01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.819]  There's no other protection in the world.
[01:15:05.999 --> 01:15:06.159]  None.
[01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:10.760]  It's never been invented that actually allows the individual blunt trauma protection.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.180]  The limbic system does, because it has the Excalibur system in it.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.321]  That's what allows me to get in the M7, stand in front of
[01:15:16.782 --> 01:15:20.500]  An 80-ton front-end loader at dead impact in fifth gear through a brick wall.
[01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:21.304]  Nothing happens to me.
[01:15:21.883 --> 01:15:23.704]  That same system is inside the limbic system.
[01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:26.486]  But of course, no response from anybody.
[01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:33.170]  Now, of course, I'm getting responses because my latest invention, AngelLight, well that now has national security implications.
[01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:34.291]  Now everybody's calling.
[01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:40.335]  Because now, not only can I see through walls, and not only can I pick up stealth technology, but anything electrical.
[01:15:40.655 --> 01:15:45.038]  It doesn't matter if it's a plane, it doesn't matter if it's a missile, it doesn't matter if it's a satellite.
[01:15:45.118 --> 01:15:48.480]  Anything electrical that comes in the view of AngelLight is completely blown out of the sky.
[01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:53.052]  I've got an article here out of the Baytown newspaper in California.
[01:15:53.989 --> 01:15:56.972]  And it says, uh, her to be says invention sees through walls.
[01:15:57.793 --> 01:16:00.755]  And, uh, it's got a picture of you standing behind it.
[01:16:00.795 --> 01:16:04.158]  Looks like something out of a 1950's science fiction movie.
[01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:11.204]  Now, how is this different from ground penetrating radar that I know that the defense department's been mounting on helicopters?
[01:16:11.745 --> 01:16:14.227]  Well, uh, my system sees in real time space.
[01:16:14.748 --> 01:16:17.610]  In that, it doesn't see, uh, like thermal.
[01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:20.793]  If you've got a two foot brick wall, and you put the angel light on it,
[01:16:21.408 --> 01:16:24.793]  It's the equivalent of cutting a hole through that wall and putting a window in it.
[01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:26.035]  You see in real time space.
[01:16:26.055 --> 01:16:26.836]  You don't see thermal.
[01:16:26.956 --> 01:16:28.158]  You don't see blurry images.
[01:16:28.439 --> 01:16:29.580]  You see in real time space.
[01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:31.083]  It penetrates through anything.
[01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:32.184]  Mine sees through.
[01:16:32.244 --> 01:16:34.187]  I've tried all the materials.
[01:16:34.528 --> 01:16:37.152]  What does your device project to do this?
[01:16:38.672 --> 01:16:45.436]  Well, it's about 14 feet long, weighs a quarter ton, and it's got everything from plasma to microwaves to, oh God, to things inside of Unreal.
[01:16:46.416 --> 01:16:48.377]  But of course, that's what I built it for, to see through walls.
[01:16:48.518 --> 01:16:55.782]  I didn't know that it could actually knock out... I mean, the booster that I'm building for France right now, I could take satellites out of space if I so wished.
[01:16:55.842 --> 01:16:58.183]  Not that I would want to, but that's basically what it does.
[01:16:58.223 --> 01:17:00.324]  Well, it looks like a giant ray gun to me.
[01:17:00.504 --> 01:17:01.645]  Yeah, that's basically what it is.
[01:17:01.665 --> 01:17:03.606]  Looks like something from Mars Attacks.
[01:17:04.146 --> 01:17:05.307]  Yeah, no doubt, no doubt.
[01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:09.329]  The only side effect to it, of course, it will kill you if the light hits you.
[01:17:09.349 --> 01:17:15.994]  I mean, I've been suffering quite... I've only been exposed to the rays for maybe three minutes over the last year, and I've basically got no immune system left.
[01:17:16.874 --> 01:17:17.975]  It's pretty deadly.
[01:17:18.455 --> 01:17:28.701]  That's the only side effect, and that's what I'm trying to get out right now, before I have... Well, why don't you place it in a lead shielding containment unit, and observe it with the cameras.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.081]  We've tried Puritan.
[01:17:31.882 --> 01:17:35.206]  My contacts at MIT keep telling me, you know, try this, try this, try this, try this.
[01:17:35.306 --> 01:17:36.868]  There's no material that it doesn't see through.
[01:17:36.888 --> 01:17:38.671]  What about Cobalt?
[01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:40.799]  Uh, don't know about Cobalt.
[01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:51.885]  I know when the French came up, they brought this box in, um, it was about, I guess, uh, a square foot around, and it had, looked like glass mirrors all over it, and I asked them what it was, and they said, just curiosity on our part.
[01:17:52.305 --> 01:17:58.529]  So they had the machine turned on, and I guess, whatever was in it, I guess it was guarded by, um, some kind of special thing.
[01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.891]  They didn't think that it could penetrate to take out the electronics, and of course it did.
[01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:06.153]  And I tried to tell them, it doesn't matter guys, what you point at, it's going to go straight through it.
[01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:07.234]  It actually goes through mirrors.
[01:18:07.915 --> 01:18:09.679]  Well, it sounds like a particle beam then.
[01:18:12.282 --> 01:18:14.083]  Something like that, yeah.
[01:18:14.263 --> 01:18:17.624]  And what's coming off it, I don't know what it is, but it basically breaks down the immune system.
[01:18:17.664 --> 01:18:20.445]  So, I mean, eight minutes exposed to it, you'd literally die.
[01:18:20.485 --> 01:18:25.667]  I mean, I've done experiments with rats and goldfish, and three, four, one hundredths of a second, you'd just wipe the money out.
[01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.788]  So, that's the side effect of trying to get away.
[01:18:28.428 --> 01:18:34.271]  Because I'm not really interested in giving it to France, or anybody else for that matter, and have them use it against troops, because that's what would happen.
[01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:37.692]  I mean, it's... Yeah, Mounties and jets.
[01:18:38.492 --> 01:18:40.514]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:18:41.035 --> 01:18:42.256]  How far does it penetrate?
[01:18:43.016 --> 01:18:50.303]  Right now, I'm at... I can actually, without the booster that I'm building for France right now, I can hit up to 70,000 feet in the air.
[01:18:50.323 --> 01:18:51.464]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:18:53.371 --> 01:18:57.873]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:58.213 --> 01:19:02.295]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:02.595 --> 01:19:03.155]  We listened.
[01:19:03.455 --> 01:19:08.438]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:08.718 --> 01:19:09.198]  We listened.
[01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.619]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:13.560]  We listened.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.101]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:18.982]  We listened.
[01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:24.563]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:24.963 --> 01:19:26.324]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:34.086]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:19:34.446 --> 01:19:37.607]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by

[01:19:55.554 --> 01:20:02.198]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:20:03.359 --> 01:20:05.680]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:20:06.461 --> 01:20:12.545]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crime.
[01:20:13.582 --> 01:20:21.706]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.

[01:21:39.272 --> 01:21:39.852]  Hi, folks.
[01:21:39.892 --> 01:21:42.454]  Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[01:21:42.474 --> 01:21:43.715]  The real money folks.
[01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:01.856]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:22:02.357 --> 01:22:03.217]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:22:03.257 --> 01:22:03.858]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:22:03.898 --> 01:22:04.278]  A 5% increase.
[01:22:04.318 --> 01:22:06.780]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.661]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:22:08.681 --> 01:22:10.122]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:11.623]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:22:27.418 --> 01:22:30.461]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:36.166]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:41.390]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[01:22:45.454 --> 01:22:46.755]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.088 --> 01:23:05.173]  All right, we're talking to inventor, scientist, naturalist, quite interesting individual, Troy Hurtubise.
[01:23:05.813 --> 01:23:12.678]  And he's up in Canada, and out of all his amazing inventions, the one that's now getting the most attention is the Angel Light.
[01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:16.057]  And he's got the French government now wanting to buy it.
[01:23:16.077 --> 01:23:20.851]  They came up with armor that was 100% effective in defending our troops against
[01:23:22.858 --> 01:23:25.180]  Medium-sized armaments, RPGs, you name it.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.121]  The Pentagon doesn't want that.
[01:23:27.882 --> 01:23:31.024]  But now they're getting interested in the angel light.
[01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:38.829]  And Troy, you're saying you invented this to look through walls, but now you've found all these weapons applications to it.
[01:23:38.869 --> 01:23:42.432]  You talk about how it can detect stealth technology.
[01:23:42.852 --> 01:23:43.753]  Can you tell us about that?
[01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:55.069]  Yeah, I've got some contacts in the military, in the States and that, and MIT and that, and because I don't know what the heck I'm doing in a lot of these areas, they simply asked because they knew basically what I was doing.
[01:23:55.089 --> 01:23:58.412]  They said, you're using the same basic principle as radar.
[01:23:58.692 --> 01:24:00.513]  Would you try this experiment for me?
[01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:05.997]  So they sent me down a six-inch piece of the new Comanche stealth technology.
[01:24:06.537 --> 01:24:10.678]  And I had to go through this whole rigmarole setting it up on a special track and stuff like that.
[01:24:11.158 --> 01:24:13.419]  And, yeah, it picks up fully stealth technology.
[01:24:13.599 --> 01:24:14.859]  So, I mean, stealth technology.
[01:24:14.879 --> 01:24:16.159]  But worse than that, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:16.199 --> 01:24:20.940]  I mean, if a stealth plane is flying overhead and it runs through the angel light, you don't have to worry about it being picked up.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.001]  It'll just fall out of the sky.
[01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:29.822]  Because once it hits the beam, anything that runs on electronics, anything, missiles, satellites, trains, planes, automobiles, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:29.942 --> 01:24:32.023]  It's just totally inoperable as soon as it hits the light.
[01:24:32.623 --> 01:24:33.203]  I don't know why.
[01:24:33.603 --> 01:24:36.164]  I mean, that's well beyond what my beliefs are.
[01:24:36.184 --> 01:24:38.185]  Well, a lot of pure research is like that.
[01:24:38.225 --> 01:24:41.206]  It's the people out doing pure research that discover things.
[01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:48.588]  And I was looking at the photo, and I asked you during the break, I said, are these gas arrays feeding at different gases on the side?
[01:24:48.608 --> 01:24:49.428]  And you said, yes.
[01:24:49.848 --> 01:24:52.949]  I don't want to get into any proprietary features of it.
[01:24:53.449 --> 01:25:01.232]  But now you were describing it as somewhat of a particle beam, but most particle beams I've read about don't have this effect.
[01:25:01.332 --> 01:25:01.412]  No.
[01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:12.118]  The beam, I've been asked to describe the beam, when the French were down, it was almost like they wanted to touch it, but I said, you'll die if you do.
[01:25:12.678 --> 01:25:14.579]  It looks solid, heavy.
[01:25:14.599 --> 01:25:18.582]  You've just never seen anything before like it.
[01:25:18.602 --> 01:25:21.743]  To actually penetrate glass, like a mirror.
[01:25:22.164 --> 01:25:23.244]  Light reflects off a mirror.
[01:25:23.564 --> 01:25:26.066]  This, if you set up a huge mirror in front of it, it'll go right through it.
[01:25:26.952 --> 01:25:31.558]  Well, particle beams will too, so there's a difference between this and a particle beam.
[01:25:35.749 --> 01:25:37.211]  Take it outside your front yard, Troy.
[01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:44.538]  And underneath your front lawn, it's already marked, is all the city's pipes and stuff like that.
[01:25:44.558 --> 01:25:46.420]  You know, gas pipes and all that kind of stuff like that.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.402]  Would you be able to see them in real time space?
[01:25:48.442 --> 01:25:48.962]  I said, well, sure.
[01:25:49.423 --> 01:25:52.145]  So I turned it on, and it basically opens up a hole in the ground.
[01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:56.390]  You actually think I almost broke my knuckles two or three times when you pointed at a brick wall.
[01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:58.552]  I've got a two-foot concrete wall in my lab.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.741]  You're looking straight through it like in real time.
[01:26:01.801 --> 01:26:02.561]  It's like there's a window.
[01:26:02.822 --> 01:26:06.943]  You're saying without even looking through a monitor that it's hooked to?
[01:26:07.283 --> 01:26:08.084]  That's right, that's right.
[01:26:08.144 --> 01:26:13.466]  So it actually, really, that's incredible.
[01:26:13.486 --> 01:26:17.148]  You just aim it without it going through a monitor or through a system.
[01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:23.891]  Exactly, that's why I call it... So it doesn't recreate it off the waves like ground penetrating radar, it actually just makes it disappear.
[01:26:24.031 --> 01:26:28.573]  Exactly, so what you want to do is you want to put your hand to the wall because... What does this look like when you do this?
[01:26:29.193 --> 01:26:29.493]  What is it?
[01:26:29.513 --> 01:26:29.713]  What?
[01:26:30.474 --> 01:26:34.756]  I mean, I mean, obviously, I mean, does it just look like real life?
[01:26:34.796 --> 01:26:35.256]  Exactly.
[01:26:35.376 --> 01:26:35.796]  Exactly.
[01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:38.677]  And what happens is I stopped doing it because it just broke my knuckles twice.
[01:26:39.418 --> 01:26:45.360]  When you're looking at the other side of the garage, like with the brick wall, you actually think that there's no wall there.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.961]  So you want to put your hand through it.
[01:26:47.021 --> 01:26:48.022]  Well, the wall is still there.
[01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:48.762]  You'll break your hand.
[01:26:49.384 --> 01:26:50.785]  It's the craziest thing you've ever seen.
[01:26:51.225 --> 01:26:56.087]  I mean, one scientist from MIT said, yeah, but Troy, my God, anthropologically speaking.
[01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:56.747]  I said, well, of course.
[01:26:57.047 --> 01:26:58.108]  My father's an anthropologist.
[01:26:58.128 --> 01:26:58.548]  Think about it.
[01:26:58.828 --> 01:27:06.711]  You put this on a low-flying plane, and you go over where you figure, I don't know, the Ming Dynasty, whatever, you know, stuff like that.
[01:27:06.811 --> 01:27:10.433]  Anthropological sites that are like hundreds of feet down in the ground, but you don't really know they're there.
[01:27:10.713 --> 01:27:12.974]  If you fly over it, it opens up the ground.
[01:27:13.522 --> 01:27:24.235]  It literally, I mean if you were in the plane, and let's say it was a chopper, and it would open up the ground, you would actually think that if you jumped out of the plane, you would fall through the hole, but there is no hole there.
[01:27:24.455 --> 01:27:28.540]  How deep does it penetrate right now before the booster is on it?
[01:27:29.481 --> 01:27:32.082]  Without the booster, I can go down about 250 feet.
[01:27:32.563 --> 01:27:34.323]  With the booster on, I haven't tried it yet.
[01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:37.585]  I don't really... But again, you've got the problem with shielding.
[01:27:38.005 --> 01:27:40.826]  You yourself said that it has a backsplash.
[01:27:41.466 --> 01:27:42.787]  And that's what's made me sick.
[01:27:42.827 --> 01:27:44.548]  I mean, in the last few months alone... Well, I call it leakage.
[01:27:45.028 --> 01:27:47.129]  How do you fix that to where it can be mounted?
[01:27:47.269 --> 01:27:48.269]  See, there's the paradox.
[01:27:48.589 --> 01:27:50.010]  Because, you know, wouldn't you know it?
[01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:53.592]  I mean, thank God I've got people at MIT that are always thinking, here's the paradox.
[01:27:53.632 --> 01:27:55.493]  I'm trying to get the damn height effect out.
[01:27:55.533 --> 01:27:56.373]  Whoops, sorry for saying that.
[01:27:57.093 --> 01:27:59.494]  I'm trying to get the height effect out, but here's the paradox.
[01:28:00.055 --> 01:28:16.323]  If you put the angel light, which has a negative, in front of another negative, like carbon monoxide, I've taken aquariums, closed them off completely, took a hose, hooked it up to the back of the car muffler, and pumped pure carbon monoxide into the tank with a rat.
[01:28:16.443 --> 01:28:17.683]  The rat dies, of course, in minutes.
[01:28:18.244 --> 01:28:20.805]  Do it with the angel light on, and the rat lives forever.
[01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:24.587]  So it actually turns carbon monoxide into clean air.
[01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:34.120]  So as an environmentalist, the implications with regards to industry, the smokestacks that, and with regards to cars, is beyond comprehension.
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.341]  Now the mainstream media is saying you really have invented all this.
[01:28:37.961 --> 01:28:39.822]  I kind of find it hard to believe.
[01:28:40.242 --> 01:28:40.662]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:41.563]  We're honored to have you.
[01:28:42.243 --> 01:28:43.183]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.644 --> 01:28:45.284]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.165 --> 01:28:48.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.590 --> 01:29:04.839]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:29:05.059 --> 01:29:11.524]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:12.365]  We're good to go!
[01:29:34.841 --> 01:29:36.501]  What America needs is affordable health insurance!
[01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:04.693]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[01:30:04.913 --> 01:30:07.595]  If you're self-employed, it's on your mind, too.
[01:30:07.755 --> 01:30:12.740]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.943]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.144]  Write this number down.
[01:30:17.705 --> 01:30:18.966]  800-807-5989.
[01:30:19.387 --> 01:30:23.813]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:30:24.193 --> 01:30:35.468]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[01:30:36.008 --> 01:30:40.032]  And if you have a COBRA plan that's about to expire, we can help you, too.
[01:30:40.152 --> 01:30:41.573]  So call us right now.
[01:30:41.593 --> 01:30:41.854]  800-807-5989.
[01:30:41.914 --> 01:30:42.094]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:30:42.134 --> 01:30:43.255]  Not available in all states.
[01:30:51.992 --> 01:30:53.513]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:55.975]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:30:56.315 --> 01:30:57.196]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:30:57.576 --> 01:30:58.797]  Oil War III has started.
[01:30:59.097 --> 01:31:01.538]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:05.341]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:05.781 --> 01:31:06.602]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:31:06.622 --> 01:31:09.604]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:31:09.844 --> 01:31:11.125]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:31:11.565 --> 01:31:16.068]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:31:16.488 --> 01:31:20.451]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:31:20.991 --> 01:31:26.876]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:31:27.136 --> 01:31:33.221]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:31:33.761 --> 01:31:34.342]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:34.362 --> 01:31:40.006]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:31:40.446 --> 01:31:40.666]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:40.687 --> 01:31:42.448]  Pre-email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:31:42.468 --> 01:31:42.688]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.342]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:55.362 --> 01:31:59.285]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.552 --> 01:32:14.117]  Ultra-wideband technology, while herd of bees claims appear on the surface as a stain,
[01:32:15.477 --> 01:32:24.363]  To strain fragility, he has now placed himself miles ahead in the quest of high-tech companies to invent something that will do the same thing.
[01:32:24.423 --> 01:32:32.488]  Motorola Incorporated, for example, has set its sights on emerging technology that would allow first responders and special forces to breathe through building walls.
[01:32:32.929 --> 01:32:35.631]  The Washington Post technology website reports.
[01:32:36.151 --> 01:32:43.696]  Folks, I saw the purchase orders five, six years ago where the Defense Department gave local police departments ground-penetrating radar pods
[01:32:44.614 --> 01:32:49.297]  And they've released a video of it where it gives you a black and white image of people hiding in a house.
[01:32:50.318 --> 01:32:53.560]  It's a lot more advanced than the old infrared systems.
[01:32:54.681 --> 01:32:57.283]  But this, again, is light years ahead of that.
[01:32:58.064 --> 01:33:04.989]  And I've got a big stack of mainstream news articles here that have been there, seen the demonstrations, witnessed all of this.
[01:33:05.729 --> 01:33:08.831]  And I heard her talking to you again during the break, sir.
[01:33:10.921 --> 01:33:17.184]  I think the off-air stuff is even more riveting than the on-air, but I was saying, well, when you go give lectures at MIT, I mean, don't you get followed?
[01:33:17.204 --> 01:33:18.064]  Don't you get harassed?
[01:33:18.365 --> 01:33:23.667]  You better watch yourself, because I'll guarantee you similar stuff, and I'm not trying to steal your thunder.
[01:33:23.967 --> 01:33:31.530]  I mean, a lot of times, pure research develops things that the biggest laboratories can't, but I know the Pentagon has been working on stuff like this for decades.
[01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:32.951]  A lot of it classified.
[01:33:33.957 --> 01:33:44.709]  I'd watch yourself, because a lot of times inventors who come up with things that the establisher doesn't control meet with bad ends, sad ends, and you had some comments for me when I said that.
[01:33:45.627 --> 01:33:46.288]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:33:46.328 --> 01:33:55.213]  I mean, when I was at MIT a couple years back, I was giving a demonstration on the HERCI, which is, you know, ballistic capabilities.
[01:33:55.673 --> 01:33:57.594]  And, I mean, I was followed for six months.
[01:33:57.814 --> 01:33:59.115]  When I got home, my phones were tapped.
[01:33:59.135 --> 01:33:59.996]  My phone's tapped right now.
[01:34:00.016 --> 01:34:00.516]  I already know that.
[01:34:00.536 --> 01:34:06.440]  I mean, I've got military connections through the yin-yang, and they come in there with these special things, and they say, yeah, yeah, here's a bug, here's a bug.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:07.840]  Your phone's still bugged.
[01:34:08.221 --> 01:34:10.782]  I mean, I know that, but, I mean, you know, I've got locked angels around me.
[01:34:10.802 --> 01:34:12.203]  I never worry about such stupidity.
[01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:16.398]  And again, you've tried to, uh, you've got all these foreign governments.
[01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:17.739]  The French are already paying you.
[01:34:17.759 --> 01:34:18.799]  You've got Saudi Arabia.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:19.440]  Yep.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.901]  The foreign governments are paying you, but our own government doesn't want it.
[01:34:23.201 --> 01:34:23.602]  Exactly.
[01:34:23.982 --> 01:34:25.382]  And the Canadian government, well, you know what?
[01:34:25.723 --> 01:34:27.583]  We can't afford bullets, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:27.683 --> 01:34:29.064]  So you can understand the Canadian government.
[01:34:29.124 --> 01:34:30.625]  I mean, our armed forces, come on, man.
[01:34:30.985 --> 01:34:32.225]  Our ships sink and our subs sink.
[01:34:32.265 --> 01:34:32.786]  I mean, forget it.
[01:34:33.146 --> 01:34:34.927]  But the United States military.
[01:34:35.047 --> 01:34:35.807]  I mean, I'm a patriot.
[01:34:36.007 --> 01:34:38.388]  I mean, my God, man, I consider myself to be an American.
[01:34:38.508 --> 01:34:40.229]  In North America, we all live in the same bloody continent.
[01:34:40.649 --> 01:34:41.789]  But, I mean, I have tried.
[01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:44.030]  I have tried for 17 years.
[01:34:44.610 --> 01:34:47.370]  I mean, Discovery Channel has covered everything I've ever done.
[01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:49.531]  I have brought all my innovations to universities.
[01:34:49.551 --> 01:34:55.972]  No, the Discovery Channel came down while you machine gunned and RPG'd your armor.
[01:34:56.032 --> 01:34:57.172]  Well, here's one for you.
[01:34:57.212 --> 01:34:59.432]  And it doesn't go through it, but the government doesn't want it.
[01:34:59.552 --> 01:35:00.432]  Well, here's one for you.
[01:35:00.632 --> 01:35:01.433]  Now, this is a fact.
[01:35:01.473 --> 01:35:02.313]  Check it out with yourself.
[01:35:03.033 --> 01:35:07.354]  John Kerry, in the second debate when he brought up the armor factor, okay?
[01:35:08.114 --> 01:35:09.854]  The American Discovery Channel
[01:35:10.609 --> 01:35:15.150]  Went to Canada, bought the piece that you just listened to, the entire piece, and showed it.
[01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:19.251]  Now this is eight days before the presidential election took place, November 3rd.
[01:35:19.671 --> 01:35:25.512]  Eight days before that, that piece aired in America, in America, twenty-two times in eight days.
[01:35:25.772 --> 01:35:30.073]  Now you tell me that's not politically motivated, and not one call from anybody from the Pentagon.
[01:35:30.153 --> 01:35:32.994]  And tapes have been sent, tapes have been sent to every single
[01:35:33.554 --> 01:35:34.935]  I'll tell you what it is.
[01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:55.018]  Why should the corporations that own our military pay for it if they can just, and that's what the NSA mainly does is industrial espionage, if they can just steal it from you?
[01:35:55.278 --> 01:35:55.498]  True.
[01:35:55.698 --> 01:35:56.259]  I've been told that.
[01:35:56.439 --> 01:35:56.819]  Absolutely.
[01:35:57.099 --> 01:35:57.460]  Absolutely.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.300]  But you know what?
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.601]  I've got God on my side.
[01:35:59.621 --> 01:36:00.322]  I don't fear anybody.
[01:36:00.342 --> 01:36:02.424]  If you want to come down here, you're more than invited, guys.
[01:36:02.624 --> 01:36:05.106]  I mean, you know, I left half my life in the Rocky Mountains.
[01:36:05.146 --> 01:36:06.127]  I mean, I deal with grizzly bears.
[01:36:06.347 --> 01:36:07.588]  I'm not interested in a couple of idiots.
[01:36:07.688 --> 01:36:08.629]  That's right.
[01:36:08.649 --> 01:36:14.518]  The Discovery Channel gets into your 1984 grizzly bear attack that you survived in northern British Columbia.
[01:36:14.538 --> 01:36:16.281]  I want to take some calls, but tell us about that.
[01:36:16.301 --> 01:36:20.246]  Well, as a young man, like I said, I spent most of my life in the Rockies.
[01:36:20.266 --> 01:36:22.329]  I had to go up just to pan for gold and live off the land.
[01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:24.669]  I got attacked by a grizzly bear.
[01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.273]  To make a long story short, the animal didn't kill me.
[01:36:28.293 --> 01:36:29.454]  I was fascinated by the species.
[01:36:29.675 --> 01:36:30.876]  So I went back to college.
[01:36:30.896 --> 01:36:34.100]  Tell us how the attack took place.
[01:36:34.741 --> 01:36:35.802]  I was in the bear's territory.
[01:36:35.842 --> 01:36:37.244]  I didn't know anything about bears at that time.
[01:36:38.545 --> 01:36:39.927]  It had been tracking me for three days.
[01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:45.072]  More likely out of curiosity than anything else, and we met in an open meadow.
[01:36:46.193 --> 01:36:49.736]  The whole thing could be seen on Project Griswold, which is the national film board.
[01:36:49.956 --> 01:36:53.159]  They did the movie on it and ended up being Quentin Tarantino's favorite.
[01:36:54.079 --> 01:36:55.821]  But they show the whole scene and everything like that.
[01:36:57.222 --> 01:37:00.425]  It basically fractured my chest plate.
[01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:05.958]  Just, you know, we went kind of toe-to-toe type of thing and it didn't kill me.
[01:37:06.098 --> 01:37:14.643]  It wandered back off and I was so fascinated by the species why it didn't kill me that I spent the rest of my life... By went toe-to-toe, describe that for us.
[01:37:15.692 --> 01:37:18.373]  Well, I mean, I've been a martial artist all my life.
[01:37:19.314 --> 01:37:20.854]  I've got 30 years in Shotokan.
[01:37:20.994 --> 01:37:22.255]  I've been an instructor for 20 years.
[01:37:22.315 --> 01:37:25.977]  So, I mean, fear isn't something that, you know, I don't say that out of conceit.
[01:37:26.017 --> 01:37:27.477]  It's just, that's just how you're brought up.
[01:37:28.338 --> 01:37:31.299]  But on that particular moment, I was completely shell-shocked.
[01:37:31.359 --> 01:37:34.280]  I mean, all my faculties went, literally, my physical faculties were gone.
[01:37:35.321 --> 01:37:36.081]  And I was terrified.
[01:37:36.121 --> 01:37:37.222]  And I was laying down on the ground.
[01:37:37.262 --> 01:37:41.324]  And the only thing I could remember from anything I've ever seen in National Geographic was, do you play dead?
[01:37:41.744 --> 01:37:43.985]  Well, I couldn't fathom playing dead with this 500-pound
[01:37:46.066 --> 01:37:49.147]  I mean, I basically knew I was finished.
[01:37:49.467 --> 01:37:53.109]  So I stood back up, and I always carry no less than nine knives on me, boys, man.
[01:37:53.529 --> 01:37:56.090]  And I drew them and said, I'm dead.
[01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:56.990]  There's no twist about it.
[01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:59.191]  But I'm going to put a couple in you before I get out.
[01:37:59.632 --> 01:38:02.913]  And the bear basically, I always said, if a bear could smile, it did.
[01:38:03.153 --> 01:38:05.414]  It just kind of knew that, yeah, OK, I could kill you.
[01:38:05.434 --> 01:38:05.974]  But you know what?
[01:38:06.355 --> 01:38:07.615]  Yeah, you'd probably get one or two in me.
[01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:08.515]  And off he went.
[01:38:08.776 --> 01:38:10.656]  And I was completely fascinated from that moment on.
[01:38:11.277 --> 01:38:13.818]  I mean, I've been to the Dakotas, talked to medicine men.
[01:38:14.538 --> 01:38:17.263]  By the way, on the Discovery Channel piece, they've got you with a giant
[01:38:25.214 --> 01:38:28.918]  I've been working on a fire piece for about 18 years.
[01:38:47.717 --> 01:38:51.319]  You know, did about four or five thousand pours over an 18 year period.
[01:38:51.339 --> 01:38:54.500]  I could never find what I call in the family tree, the sister.
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:55.461]  I could never find the sister.
[01:38:55.961 --> 01:39:00.803]  And after I nearly burnt alive, I was doing, I was building the suit for the fire department, the Columbia shuttle crashed.
[01:39:00.983 --> 01:39:02.204]  And I said, you know, this is ridiculous.
[01:39:02.224 --> 01:39:05.185]  I mean, with the technology they have out there, that should have never happened with their tile system.
[01:39:05.885 --> 01:39:14.109]  And sure enough, as I said, I do things that people say, well, if you haven't got any background in these areas, I mean, many laureates I've sat with, Nobel Prize winners, and they say,
[01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:19.072]  How do you do it, Troy, if you don't have... Well, I've always said... Einstein always said imagination.
[01:39:19.272 --> 01:39:21.714]  He always went to bed at night with a pen and a paper by his bed.
[01:39:21.734 --> 01:39:23.855]  Well, it's always been the pure research.
[01:39:24.255 --> 01:39:29.578]  Most of the big drugs they discover or materials they discover was an accident in the lab.
[01:39:29.718 --> 01:39:33.760]  Yeah, and when I hit fire paste... Remember, NASA's tile system, their best tiles are 5 inches thick.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.801]  They're called black tiles.
[01:39:35.121 --> 01:39:37.062]  And they can handle 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit heat.
[01:39:37.462 --> 01:39:39.423]  Well, my tile's 3 times stronger.
[01:39:39.443 --> 01:39:39.883]  45% lighter.
[01:39:41.224 --> 01:39:44.186]  And where they have 24,000 tiles on the shuttle.
[01:39:44.526 --> 01:39:49.910]  Their average tile, which is 6 by 6 inches, 2 inches thick, there's about 13,000 of them, cost $2,000 U.S.
[01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:52.451]  My same tile cost $4.50 Canadian.
[01:39:52.792 --> 01:39:54.773]  They can handle 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit heat.
[01:39:55.273 --> 01:39:59.576]  I've benchmarked 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit heat, and I've taken a half-inch, not five inches.
[01:39:59.596 --> 01:40:01.738]  Well, that sounds like a great material for the space planes.
[01:40:01.938 --> 01:40:04.459]  Absolutely, which has been sent to NASA, Discovery Channel.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.444]  Aurora, Black Manta... Oh, I mean I took a... Why hasn't the skunks, the skunkworks gone?
[01:40:10.464 --> 01:40:11.404]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:40:11.444 --> 01:40:12.945]  I mean, you know, there it is right there.
[01:40:13.026 --> 01:40:17.289]  I mean, to prove it, I called my people at Harvard and I said, this is what I'm going to do.
[01:40:17.569 --> 01:40:20.251]  And one of the professors said, Troy, that's insanity.
[01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:21.212]  You're going to die.
[01:40:21.552 --> 01:40:23.373]  There is no material on Earth, Troy.
[01:40:23.633 --> 01:40:24.354]  None on Earth.
[01:40:24.734 --> 01:40:27.976]  At a half inch thick, that can handle 3600 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:40:28.056 --> 01:40:32.718]  That's right, you have a giant blowtorch right up against your face with a thin layer of the sun.
[01:40:32.898 --> 01:40:34.299]  Half inch right between my eyes.
[01:40:34.539 --> 01:40:42.523]  I held it for 10 minutes and the cross transfer heat on the other side went up 10 minutes at 3600 degrees at a half inch, it went up 40 degrees.
[01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:44.244]  Science says that's an impossibility.
[01:40:45.044 --> 01:40:45.945]  And you know why I did it?
[01:40:45.965 --> 01:40:48.106]  In other words, they said, how could you discover this?
[01:40:48.326 --> 01:40:52.408]  Well, I found that the sister I was looking for for 18 years ended up being Diet Coke.
[01:40:54.594 --> 01:40:55.555]  You see, that's what science says.
[01:40:55.575 --> 01:40:56.496]  We'd never do that, Troy.
[01:40:56.596 --> 01:40:57.477]  Science doesn't do that.
[01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:10.808]  We would never be sitting in a lab one night, your wife walks in, leaves a half-drunk bottle of Diet Coke, and having tried over 4,000 different chemicals and polymers, you look, and out of just stupidity, say, you know what?
[01:41:10.828 --> 01:41:11.729]  I'll try Diet Coke.
[01:41:11.769 --> 01:41:12.510]  Well, sure enough, bang.
[01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:19.296]  So the answer was that complex alcohol slash
[01:41:20.394 --> 01:41:26.856]  Um, aspartame, alcohol, alcohol slash fluoride molecule?
[01:41:27.017 --> 01:41:27.357]  You're right.
[01:41:27.937 --> 01:41:28.137]  Right.
[01:41:28.257 --> 01:41:29.497]  And of course, science laughs at that.
[01:41:29.537 --> 01:41:30.198]  They know what I've done.
[01:41:30.258 --> 01:41:38.461]  I mean, I've brought it to universities where they've actually brought it, bought underneath a huge array of tests, and they still don't know what it is.
[01:41:38.481 --> 01:41:40.521]  Troy, you better tell your wife to stop drinking those codes.
[01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:40.962]  No doubt.
[01:41:41.182 --> 01:41:41.482]  No doubt.
[01:41:41.702 --> 01:41:43.182]  But again, you hit it right, Alex.
[01:41:43.262 --> 01:41:44.783]  Why isn't NASA looking at it?
[01:41:45.083 --> 01:41:48.245]  Why isn't the Pentagon looking at the Olympics?
[01:41:48.325 --> 01:41:49.845]  I mean, I can't get anything else here.
[01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:58.050]  So now I invent something that unfortunately has military aspects to the point that it could actually change a country to be a superpower, and now all of a sudden everybody's interested.
[01:41:58.090 --> 01:41:58.810]  And that's the travesty.
[01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:59.570]  It shouldn't be like that.
[01:42:01.591 --> 01:42:02.752]  Unbelievable, folks.
[01:42:02.792 --> 01:42:07.234]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com or just type into Google
[01:42:09.332 --> 01:42:13.013]  Hurt to Bees says Invention Sees Their Walls, Baytown.
[01:42:13.053 --> 01:42:15.074]  You can go read a bunch of news articles about it and look at it.
[01:42:16.314 --> 01:42:17.274]  Just amazing.
[01:42:18.074 --> 01:42:20.475]  Let's talk to Frank in West Virginia.
[01:42:20.515 --> 01:42:21.875]  Frank, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:42:22.696 --> 01:42:28.597]  Hello, this is one of the most interesting guests you've had in quite a long time, Alex, and you have some fantastic guests, every one of them.
[01:42:29.578 --> 01:42:31.398]  Troy, I have several questions for you.
[01:42:31.418 --> 01:42:32.478]  I'll just make it brief.
[01:42:32.898 --> 01:42:36.880]  First of all, can we listeners buy your ballistic vest?
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.460]  Are those available to the general public?
[01:42:40.515 --> 01:42:42.557]  The last cushions, I've got one 20 ton press.
[01:42:43.037 --> 01:42:43.918]  And I've all bought myself.
[01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:47.761]  So, you know, when these American mothers call, you know, crying on the phone.
[01:42:47.781 --> 01:42:51.524]  Well, we need to have one of these body armor companies come along and license it from you.
[01:42:51.544 --> 01:42:54.666]  See, everybody watches Discovery Channel, and they think they're already manufactured.
[01:42:54.927 --> 01:42:58.229]  And here's just poor old me, and I can only make so many bags.
[01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:05.815]  I would love to be able to send an entire Hummer outfitted for these mothers that are calling, but I can't do it by myself, and I've been doing it by myself for 17 years.
[01:43:07.521 --> 01:43:12.945]  So yeah, I'd love to be able to, you know, take calls and say, yeah, how many bags do you need?
[01:43:12.965 --> 01:43:13.546]  I'll send them to you.
[01:43:13.666 --> 01:43:16.088]  Unfortunately, I haven't got the resources to do it.
[01:43:16.468 --> 01:43:17.369]  And that's the traveling.
[01:43:17.789 --> 01:43:19.510]  Yes, that certainly is.
[01:43:20.731 --> 01:43:29.358]  You know, there's something I realize, and I'll try to keep it very brief, so this might sound a little bit odd to you if you haven't talked to a lot of soldiers, but I have, and I've
[01:43:30.442 --> 01:43:32.843]  I have a lot of friends that are in the military.
[01:43:33.383 --> 01:43:38.164]  Some quite as, just as much patriot as you and I and Alex.
[01:43:38.704 --> 01:43:51.408]  And there's a few, though, out there that have actually told me their own words that they'd actually fire upon American citizens if they were ever ordered to confiscate our weapons and we didn't turn them over.
[01:43:51.428 --> 01:43:53.709]  Yeah, this technology can be very dangerous.
[01:43:53.749 --> 01:43:58.730]  Imagine troops all armed and unstoppable running around confiscating our firearms.
[01:44:00.072 --> 01:44:11.467]  And I was wondering, is there anything that you have manufactured, you know, would it someday, possibly, if you had the finances, the backing, would it be available to
[01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:18.412]  Law-abiding Americans that will protect themselves from these soldiers if they were ever to order them.
[01:44:18.432 --> 01:44:20.733]  Perhaps we could buy some ray guns from you.
[01:44:20.833 --> 01:44:21.574]  Yeah, no doubt.
[01:44:21.594 --> 01:44:24.335]  The Olympic system, yeah, the Olympic system, I'd love to.
[01:44:24.355 --> 01:44:26.656]  I mean, the Olympic system is, you put on buildings.
[01:44:26.796 --> 01:44:31.798]  I mean, had the trade centers had the Olympic system and the fireplace inside, they'd have never fell.
[01:44:32.178 --> 01:44:33.339]  Now, that's a scientific fact.
[01:44:33.379 --> 01:44:35.219]  I've already proved it on a small scale.
[01:44:35.279 --> 01:44:35.660]  Sure.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.660]  They would have never fell.
[01:44:37.116 --> 01:44:38.496]  But I mean, they all know this.
[01:44:38.716 --> 01:44:41.017]  I mean, the American government, the Canadian government, they all know this.
[01:44:41.077 --> 01:44:41.917]  They've seen the results.
[01:44:42.137 --> 01:44:44.518]  They've seen the scientific studies done by the universities on it.
[01:44:44.538 --> 01:44:45.778]  They've seen the discovery channels.
[01:44:45.998 --> 01:44:47.198]  But God forbid they give me a call.
[01:44:47.358 --> 01:44:48.459]  I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[01:44:48.919 --> 01:44:51.579]  Well, why buy something you can just steal?
[01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:52.059]  Exactly.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.000]  Do you have a website by any chance?
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.180]  Or contact info?
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.721]  Yeah, I've got a website, projecttroy.com.
[01:44:59.962 --> 01:45:01.683]  I couldn't turn a computer on to save my life.
[01:45:01.743 --> 01:45:02.924]  Somebody else runs it.
[01:45:02.944 --> 01:45:03.485]  That's the joke.
[01:45:03.525 --> 01:45:06.327]  I couldn't hang drywall or turn a computer on, but I can build all these things.
[01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:09.910]  You're quite a man.
[01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.331]  I appreciate it.
[01:45:11.592 --> 01:45:12.252]  Kindred spirit.
[01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:12.733]  You take care.
[01:45:12.753 --> 01:45:14.254]  Thank you, sir.
[01:45:14.634 --> 01:45:15.515]  Thanks, Frank.
[01:45:16.136 --> 01:45:17.116]  Betty in Ohio.
[01:45:17.136 --> 01:45:18.197]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:45:18.217 --> 01:45:18.658]  Go ahead.
[01:45:19.378 --> 01:45:19.779]  Hello.
[01:45:19.879 --> 01:45:26.865]  I was wondering if Troy might be acquainted with an engineer in South Dakota at Hermosa.
[01:45:27.546 --> 01:45:39.970]  He has a company called Realtronics and he claims he has already invented this thing that can see through mountains and it's going to help the government find Osama Bin Laden in the mountains.
[01:45:41.392 --> 01:45:43.294]  No, I haven't.
[01:45:45.116 --> 01:45:50.721]  The problem is, what I invented it for, to see through things, that really doesn't matter.
[01:45:50.962 --> 01:45:54.425]  I don't believe that the French government is buying it because it sees through things.
[01:45:54.645 --> 01:45:59.750]  I believe they're buying it because anything electronic in the world, it'll completely disarm.
[01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:01.572]  So I think that's the way they're going to go.
[01:46:02.145 --> 01:46:08.306]  In other words, if you took this, and you built one the size of an 18-wheeler, you couldn't send a missile to France.
[01:46:08.746 --> 01:46:12.107]  You couldn't have a satellite go overhead, because if it hits the beam, they're just going to fall out of the sky.
[01:46:12.347 --> 01:46:15.888]  You could send in a whole squadron of F-18s and stealth bombers.
[01:46:16.228 --> 01:46:18.248]  Once they pass through the light, they all fall out of the sky.
[01:46:18.348 --> 01:46:20.869]  I think that's what the French are looking for, not because it sees two walls.
[01:46:21.609 --> 01:46:24.730]  Well, it sees through mountains.
[01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:29.831]  And if you're interested, get in touch with Scott Thompson in Hermosa, South Dakota.
[01:46:30.523 --> 01:46:31.264]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:46:38.757 --> 01:46:51.860]  The difference between those units and this unit, and these are, you know, admitted, patented, being used right now, is they take the feed from the waves that come back after the radar's projected, and then reads it and then displays it on a screen.
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:02.942]  According to, and again, the media's been there, and the French government's already put money down on it, this thing, in real time, you just shoot it at a wall, and you can look through the wall.
[01:47:03.262 --> 01:47:03.662]  Exactly.
[01:47:04.912 --> 01:47:07.054]  Well, I kind of hate to live next door to you.
[01:47:07.234 --> 01:47:10.757]  Yeah, what are your neighbors saying?
[01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.878]  Yeah, I don't think the neighbors know right now.
[01:47:13.619 --> 01:47:24.167]  Well, I guess they kind of, well, they know who I am because every, you know, two months Discovery Channel is down here or some network doing, you know, whether it's a limbic or fireplace demonstration and that, but Angel Light is kind of new, so.
[01:47:24.407 --> 01:47:25.508]  Where are you located?
[01:47:26.249 --> 01:47:28.291]  In North Bay, Ontario, Canada.
[01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:28.811]  Population 50,000.
[01:47:29.451 --> 01:47:32.454]  Just a quiet little villa in the middle of nowhere, basically, in the bush.
[01:47:32.854 --> 01:47:36.277]  With a gigantic particle beam in the lab.
[01:47:36.697 --> 01:47:38.098]  Alright, thank you buddy.
[01:47:38.678 --> 01:47:39.879]  Al in California.
[01:47:40.039 --> 01:47:40.760]  Al, go ahead.
[01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:43.382]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[01:47:43.682 --> 01:47:44.443]  Good sir, go ahead.
[01:47:45.343 --> 01:47:46.764]  You guys ever heard of Tom Bearden?
[01:47:48.346 --> 01:47:48.966]  Does it ring a bell?
[01:47:49.747 --> 01:47:50.547]  Does it ring a bell?
[01:47:51.088 --> 01:47:54.930]  I think the website is kennery.com, some way from Louisiana.
[01:47:54.951 --> 01:47:58.433]  But he talks about a lot of this stuff, what you're talking about doing.
[01:47:58.453 --> 01:48:00.915]  He mentions one device called the Priore device.
[01:48:01.678 --> 01:48:18.372]  It's similar to, say, the wildlife generator, but this thing, what it does is it boosts the immune system on a quantum level, and it'll help the immune system do things like cure cancer and all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:48:18.412 --> 01:48:20.434]  People preserve fruit for an extra long time.
[01:48:20.454 --> 01:48:22.596]  It's just electromagnetic means.
[01:48:24.574 --> 01:48:30.660]  Anyhow, this guy's name is Antoine Pierret, and the French government has this one, too.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:40.849]  This occurred back in the 1950s and 60s and 70s, and basically this guy was just curing cancer using this quantum-engineered electromagnetic signal.
[01:48:41.363 --> 01:48:44.386]  They weren't just ordinary electromagnetic signals.
[01:48:44.406 --> 01:48:46.708]  They had to be engineered from within.
[01:48:46.928 --> 01:48:56.477]  I did read in the BBC that the Queen Mother, who lived to be over 100, she used frequency treatments.
[01:48:57.285 --> 01:49:01.746]  And again, I'm not a scientist, so I don't get off into all this, but I'm sure there's something real to it.
[01:49:02.107 --> 01:49:09.929]  But then there's also a lot of people, and I'm not talking about this individual you're mentioning, but there's a lot of people out there who claim they've got devices and it's not really real.
[01:49:09.989 --> 01:49:11.049]  But thank you for the call.
[01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:12.290]  Comments, Troy?
[01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:15.011]  Well, two, I guess.
[01:49:15.031 --> 01:49:16.571]  One is I wish I had that effect.
[01:49:16.631 --> 01:49:19.372]  Unfortunately, this is not something you'd use to boost the immune...
[01:49:23.328 --> 01:49:24.049]  Stay there.
[01:49:24.089 --> 01:49:25.029]  We'll be right behind you.
[01:49:52.521 --> 01:49:59.909]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:04.914]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:05.135 --> 01:50:10.781]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:22.904]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:22.944 --> 01:50:27.465]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.625 --> 01:50:30.126]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:30.366 --> 01:50:35.887]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our
[01:50:36.207 --> 01:50:36.887]  We're good to go.
[01:50:51.423 --> 01:50:57.667]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:57.787 --> 01:51:03.951]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[01:51:04.231 --> 01:51:12.616]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:15.458]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter.
[01:51:15.599 --> 01:51:19.962]  And during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:20.243 --> 01:51:25.087]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:25.287 --> 01:51:30.692]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:31.052 --> 01:51:34.075]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or nightlight.
[01:51:34.435 --> 01:51:42.399]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:58.742 --> 01:53:01.485]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.983 --> 01:53:15.992]  Alright, folks, we're back live here with our guest, Troy Hurtubise.
[01:53:16.793 --> 01:53:20.658]  And, uh, Troy, you're saying this was in the news?
[01:53:21.079 --> 01:53:21.499]  Yes, it was.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.802]  That you got a visit by the FBI?
[01:53:24.947 --> 01:53:28.530]  No, I got the... But I mean, later you got a visit from the FBI.
[01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.910]  That's right.
[01:53:28.930 --> 01:53:31.072]  Oh yes, I called the FBI three times.
[01:53:31.632 --> 01:53:33.754]  I was in conversation with them, telling them about the whole thing.
[01:53:34.134 --> 01:53:34.955]  Who this guy was.
[01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:38.958]  It only hit after the Twin Towers went down and CNN put the pictures on TV.
[01:53:39.038 --> 01:53:42.081]  Okay, so tell folks who you got a visit by.
[01:53:43.519 --> 01:53:44.760]  God, I can't even pronounce the name.
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.720]  You pronounce it better than me.
[01:53:46.061 --> 01:53:46.741]  Bahamadana.
[01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:47.401]  That's right.
[01:53:48.182 --> 01:53:51.963]  One of the hijackers that flew the second plane into the towers.
[01:53:52.243 --> 01:53:59.047]  He came to my lab exactly 11 months before the Twin Towers went down here in North Bay with another gentleman.
[01:53:59.527 --> 01:54:01.668]  And they were after Superman suit, one of my innovations.
[01:54:02.448 --> 01:54:04.270]  And they looked at a prototype.
[01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:05.532]  I took them out in the backfield.
[01:54:05.752 --> 01:54:06.633]  They filmed the whole thing.
[01:54:07.614 --> 01:54:09.556]  I shot it with guns to show them what happens to the bullets.
[01:54:09.616 --> 01:54:10.617]  It doesn't even hit it.
[01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.119]  The bullets just basically disappear.
[01:54:12.919 --> 01:54:13.660]  They went nuts on that.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.383]  But you see, their accents, they were in three-piece suits.
[01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:17.584]  They said they were Americans.
[01:54:17.965 --> 01:54:18.906]  Now, I don't know the difference.
[01:54:19.466 --> 01:54:22.008]  So, I mean, no red flags went up to me.
[01:54:22.408 --> 01:54:24.810]  So they gave me $5,000, which you'd be surprised.
[01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:25.430]  A lot of people do.
[01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:27.231]  I mean, I've had people out of Texas call me.
[01:54:27.391 --> 01:54:27.751]  Literally.
[01:54:27.932 --> 01:54:28.752]  Doctors out of Texas.
[01:54:28.772 --> 01:54:29.533]  Hi Troy, how you doing?
[01:54:29.833 --> 01:54:30.273]  Oh, how you doing?
[01:54:30.313 --> 01:54:31.574]  Yes, I'm Dr. So-and-so.
[01:54:32.114 --> 01:54:33.255]  I'm so intrigued with your suit.
[01:54:33.275 --> 01:54:35.676]  Listen, do you think you could make something that's totally bulletproof?
[01:54:36.037 --> 01:54:37.237]  I said, yeah, but it would cost this much.
[01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.999]  They sent me $30,000, and then I invented Hersey.
[01:54:40.199 --> 01:54:40.980]  That's how it happens.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.801]  So this guy gave me five grand.
[01:54:42.821 --> 01:54:44.482]  These terrorists, I didn't know who the heck they were.
[01:54:45.143 --> 01:54:51.325]  And what they did was, they knew I was going to be out of town to go get some of the stuff that I needed for it, to build Superman suit, a prototype for them.
[01:54:51.345 --> 01:54:53.726]  They wanted a bigger prototype, a whole suit suit that they could wear.
[01:54:54.026 --> 01:54:55.127]  Now, this suit's not like you think.
[01:54:55.167 --> 01:54:56.207]  This is like a pair of coveralls.
[01:54:56.547 --> 01:54:59.908]  It weighs maybe 10 pounds, and it'll stop any bullet you can throw at it.
[01:54:59.988 --> 01:55:01.029]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:55:01.049 --> 01:55:06.550]  Let's go back to the grizzly bear suit, where you have the bulldozer running over you and all that.
[01:55:07.171 --> 01:55:08.111]  How thick is that?
[01:55:08.811 --> 01:55:10.552]  Well, see, yeah, that's the difference.
[01:55:10.592 --> 01:55:12.633]  If you look at the M7, that weighs 130 pounds.
[01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:13.953]  That's straight titanium.
[01:55:14.588 --> 01:55:16.149]  And it doesn't have a lot of maneuverability.
[01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:18.832]  Superman suit is basically material.
[01:55:18.972 --> 01:55:20.173]  Runs off a 9-volt battery.
[01:55:20.794 --> 01:55:23.556]  And if you were to shoot an arrow at it, I've got live demonstrations of it.
[01:55:23.636 --> 01:55:24.897]  It blows the arrow up before it hits you.
[01:55:25.558 --> 01:55:26.699]  Well, that's what they were interested in.
[01:55:26.979 --> 01:55:28.120]  And then they tried to steal it off me.
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.321]  Tracy, I gotta watch people when they call.
[01:55:30.401 --> 01:55:31.102]  I don't know who they are.
[01:55:31.122 --> 01:55:32.222]  I really don't.
[01:55:32.302 --> 01:55:34.364]  They gave me $5,000 to make a bigger prototype.
[01:55:34.684 --> 01:55:38.046]  I went out of town to get the materials, because, I mean, you don't buy these things in North Bay, Ontario.
[01:55:38.387 --> 01:55:41.549]  And when I came back, my lab was broken into, and they got half a Superman suit.
[01:55:41.989 --> 01:55:44.431]  Well, I didn't think anything of it, because I have lots of break-ins.
[01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:49.374]  Only when the Twin Towers went down, and then three weeks later, CNN put the pictures up there, I thought, holy jeez.
[01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:52.736]  I sat with the guy for three hours, so I immediately called the FBI.
[01:55:53.197 --> 01:55:55.278]  And I talked with the FBI on three different occasions about it.
[01:55:55.478 --> 01:55:56.759]  After that, man, I never got a call back.
[01:55:56.879 --> 01:55:57.760]  It's like, yeah, yeah, who cares?
[01:55:59.342 --> 01:56:11.424]  Well, all of this is hard to believe, but here's the mainstream news and Discovery Channel showing these inventions and it's very interesting, sir, and I want to get you back up in the near future as this
[01:56:12.516 --> 01:56:19.438]  develops and as you continue to improve upon the angel-like.
[01:56:19.458 --> 01:56:20.018]  Can we do that?
[01:56:20.238 --> 01:56:20.939]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:56:20.979 --> 01:56:21.619]  No problem at all.
[01:56:22.099 --> 01:56:22.439]  All right.
[01:56:22.519 --> 01:56:27.521]  Well, again, Troy, I want to thank you for coming on and take care and be careful.
[01:56:28.161 --> 01:56:29.681]  Thank you, sir, and thank you to all your listeners.
[01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:30.161]  You bet.
[01:56:30.201 --> 01:56:30.882]  Good hearing from you.
[01:56:32.002 --> 01:56:34.123]  Well, that was an interesting interview.
[01:56:35.723 --> 01:56:40.064]  I've got a big stack of mainstream news articles here saying it's documented.
[01:56:40.585 --> 01:56:41.805]  Again, I don't know that.
[01:56:43.977 --> 01:56:54.184]  But certainly, there have been a lot of genius inventors throughout history that just don't even know what they're doing, like Tesla and people who theoretically did a lot of stuff like Einstein.
[01:56:54.505 --> 01:56:56.446]  And he has invented a lot of really interesting things.
[01:56:56.666 --> 01:56:58.027]  I don't know about this angel light.
[01:56:58.688 --> 01:57:00.489]  I know particle beams do a lot of weird stuff.
[01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:09.036]  And I do know that they did the test of his body armor, and it's about four inches thick, and it's lightweight, and it stops an RPG.
[01:57:10.136 --> 01:57:12.298]  And our government doesn't want it.
[01:57:13.715 --> 01:57:14.895]  Very, very interesting.
[01:57:15.896 --> 01:57:18.857]  Alright, we'll get to all the callers who've been holding forever.
[01:57:20.017 --> 01:57:21.437]  We want to talk about other issues.
[01:57:22.098 --> 01:57:24.418]  Call the free number to get involved on air.
[01:57:24.438 --> 01:57:26.099]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:26.399 --> 01:57:33.261]  And we'll get you up on air.
[01:57:34.081 --> 01:57:39.183]  A bunch of news about the inauguration tomorrow, about what's happening in Iraq, and the upcoming invasion of Iran and Syria.
[01:57:42.074 --> 01:57:42.735]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:42.835 --> 01:57:48.739]  Alex Jones here, introducing... Big Brother.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.441]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.161 --> 01:57:52.262]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.923 --> 01:57:53.763]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.783 --> 01:57:55.445]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.065 --> 01:57:59.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.248 --> 01:58:04.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:33.798]  I'm here reading a news article out of the Bay Today and they've got quotes here by MIT professor Gary Dreyfus talking about there's a Nobel Prize for her to bees
[01:58:35.474 --> 01:58:41.776]  If the Angel Light really performs as described, there are laws of physics waiting to be rewritten for what he's talking about.
[01:58:42.236 --> 01:58:44.877]  The French aren't the only ones interested in Hertubise innovations.
[01:58:44.977 --> 01:59:04.523]  Bay Today has obtained documentation confirming that the former head of Saudi counterintelligence, who asked that his name not be used, has been in regular contact with Hertubise regarding the Angel Light, FirePace, and the Light Infantry Battalion Blast Cushions, or LIMBEX.
[01:59:07.353 --> 01:59:11.776]  And he's got Mohammed Adda dropping by, too, before 9-11.
[01:59:12.536 --> 01:59:14.817]  And it says, Ultra Wideband Technology.
[01:59:16.738 --> 01:59:19.139]  And it gets into plasma light.
[01:59:19.179 --> 01:59:21.060]  Three units make up the angel light.
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:31.145]  The main unit, which Herdebeest calls the centrifuge, contains angel light's brains and includes black, white, and red fluorescent light sources, as well as seven industrial lasers.
[01:59:32.156 --> 01:59:39.859]  The second unit, or the deflector grid, contains a large circle of optical glass, a microwave unit, and plasma intermixed with carbon dioxide.
[01:59:40.259 --> 01:59:49.743]  The third unit contains eight plasma light rods, or CO2 cartridges, industrial magnets, 108 mirrors, eight ionized cell industrial lights, and other components.
[01:59:50.123 --> 01:59:52.664]  Herdebeest chooses to remain tight liftable.
[01:59:54.509 --> 02:00:00.572]  And, uh, Herd of Beasts, uh, said, uh, Angel Light has cost $30,000 to build.
[02:00:00.612 --> 02:00:06.635]  He sold percentages of his other inventions to finance it, as well as 800 and 900 hours of his time.
[02:00:07.116 --> 02:00:10.818]  He credits his, uh, subconscious with the idea.
[02:00:10.838 --> 02:00:18.762]  I had a dream about a year ago, uh, as to most of my other inventions, just a dream, and I saw it, saw the whole casting and everything.
[02:00:19.954 --> 02:00:21.815]  And I saw what it could do, he said.
[02:00:21.835 --> 02:00:24.576]  I had a dream about these three times.
[02:00:24.896 --> 02:00:28.998]  For the third time, I had it in my head, and I started to build it through the wall.
[02:00:30.739 --> 02:00:34.940]  And then it talks about building it.
[02:00:35.961 --> 02:00:36.901]  Really bizarre.
[02:00:38.522 --> 02:00:48.026]  And he keeps, over the last couple decades, he just makes these claims, and the TV stations go out there, the scientists go out there, MIT goes out there, Discovery Channel goes out there, and he does what he claims.
[02:00:48.949 --> 02:00:54.093]  And a lot of the stuff he's done is very interesting, but you can believe it.
[02:00:54.153 --> 02:00:56.975]  Some of this stuff is getting pretty wild, so we'll see.
[02:00:58.016 --> 02:01:03.480]  But the French want to buy it basically as a weapon to shoot down aircraft.
[02:01:08.144 --> 02:01:09.685]  But this guy fits the M.O.
[02:01:09.725 --> 02:01:13.868]  of other inventors that have come up with a lot of amazing things.
[02:01:13.888 --> 02:01:16.370]  And there have been thousands of inventions that we know about.
[02:01:17.699 --> 02:01:21.200]  That don't get developed and used until 50 years later.
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:27.303]  I mean, 1954, they have these patented systems where you beam sound directly to the skull from a distance.
[02:01:28.023 --> 02:01:37.007]  And now Coke machines, that is soft drink machines, I interviewed the CEO a few years ago, are in, they haven't done it in this country, a few test sites, but in Tokyo they've accepted them.
[02:01:37.287 --> 02:01:43.289]  When you walk by it, it beams sound right at your head, and you hear, you know, come get a cold, delicious drink.
[02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:54.436]  They admit they've got all different sorts of types of stuff that's been developed that is admitted if you research it, but the average person thinks of it as science fiction.
[02:01:54.977 --> 02:01:57.098]  Well, yeah, it was science fiction back in the 60s.
[02:01:57.118 --> 02:01:59.099]  We're 2005 now.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.002]  We're not 1962.
[02:02:04.923 --> 02:02:05.803]  So, pretty weird.
[02:02:06.004 --> 02:02:11.047]  We'll come back and go to all the callers that are patiently holding, and then I'll get into
[02:02:12.259 --> 02:02:23.428]  Well, a lot of this important Big Brother news, what's happening with the national ID card, what's happening in Iraq, what's coming up with the inauguration tomorrow and some of the new Big Brother developments there as well.
[02:02:23.488 --> 02:02:25.590]  Full free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:29.753]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:30.253 --> 02:02:34.697]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are just two of our great websites.
[02:02:43.405 --> 02:02:47.727]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:52.349]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:52.489 --> 02:02:56.871]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:56.911 --> 02:02:58.272]  The New World Order.
[02:02:59.052 --> 02:03:00.433]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:13.797 --> 02:03:24.201]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:24.381 --> 02:03:29.743]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:30.263 --> 02:03:33.785]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.805 --> 02:03:34.325]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:34.405 --> 02:03:35.925]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:03:42.888 --> 02:03:46.170]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:46.210 --> 02:03:50.412]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:50.652 --> 02:03:53.433]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:53.633 --> 02:03:56.035]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:56.215 --> 02:04:04.859]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:05.059 --> 02:04:06.400]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:10.742]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:11.082 --> 02:04:11.283]  I think?
[02:04:30.106 --> 02:04:31.768]  Screams and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:31.948 --> 02:04:35.151]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.171 --> 02:04:36.272]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:42.327 --> 02:04:48.190]  Hey, I'll tell you, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[02:04:48.250 --> 02:04:49.950]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[02:04:50.191 --> 02:04:52.071]  Hey, last weekend I helped my neighbor move.
[02:04:52.292 --> 02:04:54.132]  That took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[02:04:54.433 --> 02:04:58.174]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[02:04:58.234 --> 02:05:01.516]  And then after that I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[02:05:01.656 --> 02:05:01.756]  Wow!
[02:05:02.516 --> 02:05:06.640]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.383]  Well that's great, and just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[02:05:10.443 --> 02:05:10.664]  Right.
[02:05:10.684 --> 02:05:15.568]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants, it's more that you, because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[02:05:15.788 --> 02:05:16.189]  Absolutely.
[02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:21.654]  I'm sleeping better, I feel better during the day, I don't get as tired in the afternoons, and I'm able to do a lot more.
[02:05:21.794 --> 02:05:26.478]  Collagenate is safe, it's natural, it's healthy, and it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.

[02:05:32.141 --> 02:05:32.542]  Big Brother.
[02:05:32.562 --> 02:05:33.282]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:33.382 --> 02:05:34.243]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:34.543 --> 02:05:34.883]  You want answers?
[02:05:34.923 --> 02:05:35.423]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:55.891 --> 02:05:59.873]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.073 --> 02:06:04.196]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.025 --> 02:06:21.685]  Welcome back.
[02:06:21.825 --> 02:06:23.466]  We're about to go straight to your calls.
[02:06:24.665 --> 02:06:30.771]  First off, I wanted to read this UPI article, a new one, Israel to kill in U.S.
[02:06:30.911 --> 02:06:31.692]  allied nations.
[02:06:32.312 --> 02:06:34.054]  We first read about this a few years ago.
[02:06:34.194 --> 02:06:47.306]  Israel is embarking upon a more aggressive approach to the war on terror that will include staging targeted killings in the United States and other friendly countries, former Israeli intelligence officials told United Press International.
[02:06:48.431 --> 02:06:52.073]  Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has forbidden the practice until now.
[02:06:52.454 --> 02:07:00.499]  These sources said, speaking on a condition of anonymity, the Israeli statements were confirmed by more than a half dozen former and current serving U.S.
[02:07:00.539 --> 02:07:05.002]  foreign policy and intelligence officials in interviews with United Press International.
[02:07:05.959 --> 02:07:10.002]  But an official at the Israeli Embassy in Washington told UPI, that is rubbish!
[02:07:10.503 --> 02:07:11.524]  It is completely untrue!
[02:07:11.544 --> 02:07:20.111]  Israel and the United States have such a close and cooperative intelligence relationship, especially in the field of counter-terrorism, that the assertion is ludicrous!
[02:07:21.772 --> 02:07:22.092]  Okay.
[02:07:24.334 --> 02:07:34.822]  Now, a former Israeli military intelligence source agreed, what Sharon wants is a much more extensive and tough approach to global terrorism, and this includes greater operational
[02:07:36.127 --> 02:07:36.847]  Maneuverability.
[02:07:36.987 --> 02:07:38.588]  Now, look.
[02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:44.651]  Your own government shouldn't be able to just go marching around killing whoever they want.
[02:07:44.711 --> 02:07:45.851]  That's total tyranny.
[02:07:46.411 --> 02:07:47.952]  Much less foreign governments.
[02:07:48.112 --> 02:07:49.793]  And folks, this has been going on for a while.
[02:07:50.873 --> 02:07:51.393]  The U.S.
[02:07:51.433 --> 02:07:53.774]  government uses Mossad to kill people for them.
[02:07:54.234 --> 02:07:55.355]  Mossad uses the U.S.
[02:07:55.395 --> 02:07:56.375]  government to kill for them.
[02:07:57.376 --> 02:08:00.877]  MI6 uses the CIA and other defense intelligence to kill for them.
[02:08:00.957 --> 02:08:02.878]  Our government contracts with them to do it.
[02:08:03.438 --> 02:08:05.099]  That is part of long-term
[02:08:06.201 --> 02:08:11.645]  Long set policy is you have somebody else do it for you for plausible deniability.
[02:08:12.826 --> 02:08:17.850]  But to have them out in the open talking about it is of great concern to me.
[02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:24.475]  I ran Val's deterrence after Bush refuses to rule out an attack.
[02:08:25.111 --> 02:08:29.433]  Tehran, Iran, has the military might to deter attacks against it.
[02:08:29.513 --> 02:08:37.715]  Its defense minister said in remarks published on Tuesday, one day after President George W. Bush, that he would not rule out military action against Iran.
[02:08:38.736 --> 02:08:44.838]  The defense minister, Ali Shamkhani, said Iran did not fear a military attack.
[02:08:45.178 --> 02:08:47.619]  We are able to say that we have the strength
[02:08:49.054 --> 02:09:13.601]  uh... that such that no country can attack us because they do not have precise information about our military abilities due to our ability to implement flexible strategies he told the news agency quoted him as saying we can claim that we have rapidly produced equipment that has resulted in the greatest deterrent he was quoted as saying without elaborating i.e.
[02:09:14.562 --> 02:09:15.562]  we've got uh...
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:21.544]  Lots of different cruise missiles and other Chinese and American made goodies.
[02:09:22.344 --> 02:09:27.568]  Our government, the British government, and the Israeli government have been caught arming Iran for the last five years.
[02:09:28.329 --> 02:09:31.131]  We have mainstream news articles on that, but they don't get in trouble for that.
[02:09:32.063 --> 02:09:39.128]  Bush said on Monday he would not rule out military action if Iran was not more forthcoming about its suspected nuclear weapons program.
[02:09:39.168 --> 02:09:46.113]  His comments in an interview with the NBC News followed the publication Sunday of an article in the New Yorker magazine that said U.S.
[02:09:46.153 --> 02:09:54.419]  commando units were conducting reconnaissance missions in Iran to identify hidden nuclear and chemical sites for possible future strikes.
[02:09:54.499 --> 02:09:58.682]  So, always before they attack, they put the special forces in.
[02:09:59.471 --> 02:10:02.693]  Who sneak around getting intelligence.
[02:10:04.694 --> 02:10:05.874]  This is serious, folks.
[02:10:06.034 --> 02:10:15.639]  And for a year, they've been admitting that our government has been bombing and strafing and killing Syrians upwards of 20 miles across the border.
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:22.102]  Imagine if a government was just flying over South Texas and attacking military bases.
[02:10:23.603 --> 02:10:27.005]  And Syria just lays there and takes it.
[02:10:28.394 --> 02:10:34.399]  Syria, it's been reported, doesn't even shoot back, because they know that this is a pretext to get a war going.
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:44.668]  Because it may be in the back of the paper that our military is attacking Syria, but the minute Syria shoots back, it'll be, Syria attacks!
[02:10:44.748 --> 02:10:45.149]  Here's
[02:10:46.798 --> 02:10:51.021]  Gun pod video from the jet as missiles were fired at it.
[02:10:51.301 --> 02:11:16.159]  The jet was dropping flowers to love the children at the time, being sarcastic, when the evil Syrians... Look again, I'm no fan of Iran, I'm no fan of Syria, but these guys are in the Stone Age compared to China and Russia and North Korea and the Ukraine and Pakistan and India and South Africa's got nuclear weapons and delivery systems.
[02:11:16.983 --> 02:11:18.464]  Oh, but we're not worried about them.
[02:11:18.544 --> 02:11:22.027]  No, our own government and our own companies have been arming these nations.
[02:11:23.068 --> 02:11:24.809]  Let's worry about these Arabs.
[02:11:24.869 --> 02:11:27.551]  Let's have a war with them.
[02:11:27.591 --> 02:11:29.573]  We can't even win the Iraq War.
[02:11:29.673 --> 02:11:32.195]  So let's go into other countries.
[02:11:32.215 --> 02:11:35.017]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:11:35.137 --> 02:11:37.779]  I've got so much other news here.
[02:11:37.799 --> 02:11:38.600]  There's just so much.
[02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:40.602]  Jim in California.
[02:11:40.642 --> 02:11:41.322]  You're on the air.
[02:11:41.362 --> 02:11:41.723]  Welcome.
[02:11:42.423 --> 02:11:44.485]  Yeah, you just mentioned Syria.
[02:11:44.505 --> 02:11:46.046]  I'm not laying down and not taking it.
[02:11:46.815 --> 02:11:50.578]  There's an old saying, no response is a response.
[02:11:52.259 --> 02:11:52.940]  Yeah, they're evil.
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:55.782]  We should nuke them because they're not responding.
[02:11:56.342 --> 02:11:57.103]  Now, I have a question.
[02:11:57.123 --> 02:11:59.664]  Do you think... What does your statement mean, sir?
[02:12:00.085 --> 02:12:02.126]  Well, no response is a response.
[02:12:02.546 --> 02:12:05.128]  Just because you're not reacting to a situation...
[02:12:07.441 --> 02:12:10.963]  So you're saying this show is just how evil they are?
[02:12:11.363 --> 02:12:11.563]  Right.
[02:12:11.843 --> 02:12:13.584]  You've got to be joking.
[02:12:13.864 --> 02:12:14.464]  No, no, no.
[02:12:14.684 --> 02:12:16.385]  What I mean is, no response isn't responsible.
[02:12:16.405 --> 02:12:24.208]  What I mean is, by not doing anything, you're sending a silent message without taking any action.
[02:12:24.509 --> 02:12:26.329]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:27.610]  Well, they're doing it.
[02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:29.491]  They lodge complaints every time.
[02:12:29.771 --> 02:12:32.132]  They're doing it, going, we know you want to start a fight.
[02:12:32.845 --> 02:12:33.285]  Exactly.
[02:12:33.325 --> 02:12:37.209]  I mean, it's like when a cop walks over and starts going, I've got a problem, Max, or it's pushing on you.
[02:12:37.609 --> 02:12:40.471]  They want you to raise one hand, they're going to call it assault.
[02:12:40.711 --> 02:12:50.039]  Right, they're not going to react to it, and by not reacting to it, that in itself is a silent response, saying we're not going to react because we know what you want as a pretext, we're not going to go along with the game.
[02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.139]  Oh, I agree with that.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.281]  So, that's what I mean by that statement.
[02:12:53.401 --> 02:12:57.704]  I didn't mean to... No, make whatever statement you want, I'm sorry I misunderstood.
[02:12:57.724 --> 02:12:59.005]  No, it's okay.
[02:12:59.186 --> 02:13:00.767]  That's all I wanted to say, just heard that and
[02:13:01.823 --> 02:13:03.104]  Wanted to comment on it.
[02:13:04.024 --> 02:13:05.225]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:13:05.265 --> 02:13:12.048]  What do you think about, uh, how they're now openly beating the drums and Ann Coulter's going, let's just nuke them for fun.
[02:13:13.129 --> 02:13:15.130]  Our troops just aren't brutal enough.
[02:13:15.150 --> 02:13:16.991]  They need to kill more civilians.
[02:13:17.231 --> 02:13:18.251]  She actually said that.
[02:13:18.291 --> 02:13:23.094]  I mean, this is getting so bloodthirsty and just disconnected from reality.
[02:13:23.234 --> 02:13:29.017]  Well, my question is, why is he, I mean, Bush, I mean he, um, is he trying to do
[02:13:30.003 --> 02:13:35.929]  What Hitler did in World War II, is he just trying to plow over all these countries?
[02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:40.755]  World domination, is that it?
[02:13:41.195 --> 02:13:46.381]  Because you also stated that they wanted to bring America down to the level of a second or third world country.
[02:13:46.901 --> 02:13:49.044]  But if we're acting as the big bully on the block,
[02:13:51.810 --> 02:13:53.171]  You understand what I'm trying to say?
[02:13:53.431 --> 02:13:54.392]  Oh, I totally understand.
[02:13:54.432 --> 02:13:55.833]  Who died and made us God?
[02:13:56.553 --> 02:13:59.095]  We can have nuclear weapons, but you can't, you can't, you can't.
[02:13:59.135 --> 02:14:06.459]  And if you don't do what we say, we're going to come in there and we're going to blast you out, we're going to kill all the civilians or whatever else that they have on their sick little agenda.
[02:14:06.939 --> 02:14:07.460]  No, I hear you.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:08.500]  Let me try to break that down.
[02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:11.182]  While we're taking other
[02:14:12.262 --> 02:14:21.809]  country's freedom while we're taking over, setting up police states there, and I think while we, we all associate ourselves with the government, domestically we're losing our freedoms too.
[02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:25.832]  The same systems are going in here, even to a greater level.
[02:14:26.332 --> 02:14:26.532]  Right.
[02:14:27.253 --> 02:14:30.095]  And so this is what world empire is all about.
[02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:31.936]  This is what it's always been about.
[02:14:32.577 --> 02:14:40.142]  Dictators, corrupt, oligarchies, plutocracies, they always seize a powerful nation, take control of it,
[02:14:41.090 --> 02:14:46.611]  And then they use that country as a base of operations to start expanding their empire.
[02:14:46.631 --> 02:14:49.892]  You know the old rock and roll song, everybody wants to rule the world.
[02:14:51.192 --> 02:14:52.292]  And so that's what this is about.
[02:14:52.612 --> 02:14:59.114]  And a lot of people associate their personal power with the government so they feel like they're part of the empire too.
[02:14:59.514 --> 02:15:05.835]  When really they'll be the people sending their sons and daughters to die in a war for empire that actually destabilizes the globe.
[02:15:05.895 --> 02:15:06.535]  Thank you for the call.
[02:15:06.815 --> 02:15:07.575]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:08.155 --> 02:15:10.516]  So, understand folks,
[02:15:11.525 --> 02:15:14.087]  That the globalists want wider war.
[02:15:14.147 --> 02:15:15.488]  They want destabilization.
[02:15:15.508 --> 02:15:18.690]  That's why they're busy arming Pakistan, arming North Korea.
[02:15:18.970 --> 02:15:19.650]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:15:19.810 --> 02:15:24.974]  Our government, our corporations, Republican, Democrat alike, are arming all these countries.
[02:15:26.114 --> 02:15:28.036]  They're putting all our industry into China.
[02:15:29.256 --> 02:15:35.200]  They go along with trade deals where China has tariffs, you know, 40 plus percent against 2 percent on average.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.461]  It's designed
[02:15:37.193 --> 02:15:47.180]  And so, while they run the gas out of America, while they use us to muscle the rest of the planet, we're then seen as the new Soviet Union, as the new bad cop, the new evil empire.
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:51.163]  Internationally, that then makes the UN and the IMF and the World Bank
[02:15:52.029 --> 02:15:57.911]  The WTO, they all speak out against us when their leaders are all our leaders and all own the same system.
[02:15:58.371 --> 02:16:00.192]  So again, it's this good cop, bad cop.
[02:16:00.392 --> 02:16:04.573]  Then we go out and play the part of the bad cop, taking over the planet for the New World Order.
[02:16:04.773 --> 02:16:07.014]  Then the New World Order chastises America.
[02:16:08.435 --> 02:16:12.276]  It's like a mafia boss chastising one of his captains for doing something bad.
[02:16:12.996 --> 02:16:13.817]  Slapping him around.
[02:16:14.277 --> 02:16:15.837]  I told you that was bad!
[02:16:15.877 --> 02:16:16.678]  Look what you did!
[02:16:17.478 --> 02:16:20.639]  But meanwhile, the mob boss gave him the orders to begin with.
[02:16:21.403 --> 02:16:25.746]  And then we have domestic propaganda telling us how good the war is and how good we are.
[02:16:26.526 --> 02:16:28.128]  It's like a big football game, as I say.
[02:16:28.928 --> 02:16:30.389]  Let's talk to Richard in Texas.
[02:16:30.449 --> 02:16:31.170]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:16:32.010 --> 02:16:32.651]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:16:32.811 --> 02:16:33.051]  Good.
[02:16:33.771 --> 02:16:36.213]  Listen, I just want to let you know you're doing a great job, man.
[02:16:36.253 --> 02:16:49.342]  I woke up probably about three months ago, and all the information I've taken in was a little bit too much for me at first, but once you get a basic understanding of what the ultimate goal is, you can do nothing but get mad, and we have no choice but to wake up.
[02:16:51.806 --> 02:16:53.187]  The first thing I have is three questions for you.
[02:16:53.987 --> 02:17:00.991]  When it comes to the Patriot Act, I know that I saw American Dictators that you said there's a sort of 300 or 400 cities that have thrown out the Patriot Act?
[02:17:01.091 --> 02:17:01.391]  Yes.
[02:17:01.851 --> 02:17:04.673]  What part of your website can we go just to list that?
[02:17:05.433 --> 02:17:15.198]  And second question, I know that on American Dictators you had Aldo Motley on one of the interviews, and I know that you've had conversations with the Dixie Chicks and some of the other
[02:17:16.383 --> 02:17:16.823]  Are you still there?
[02:17:17.124 --> 02:17:17.764]  Yes, we are.
[02:17:17.784 --> 02:17:18.405]  Okay.
[02:17:18.825 --> 02:17:34.017]  How many artists, producers, people in the elite movie stars, I know you mentioned the Mel Gibson, know what's going on and yet don't come out because of fear of probably being killed or being done with the Dixie Chicks that's been done to them.
[02:17:34.037 --> 02:17:35.919]  Okay, I'll try to answer those questions when we get back.
[02:17:35.939 --> 02:17:36.819]  Good questions.
[02:17:36.839 --> 02:17:37.600]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:38.421 --> 02:17:38.901]  We'll be back.
[02:17:38.941 --> 02:17:40.642]  Talk to Ron, DJ, Ed and others.
[02:17:40.662 --> 02:17:41.123]  Stay with us.
[02:17:43.442 --> 02:17:47.665]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:56.672]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:17:57.273 --> 02:17:59.014]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[02:17:59.735 --> 02:18:05.699]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:07.901]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:18:08.441 --> 02:18:10.603]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:18:11.183 --> 02:18:13.145]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:18:13.755 --> 02:18:14.835]  And it's so easy.
[02:18:15.556 --> 02:18:17.636]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:18:18.396 --> 02:18:19.057]  When you want.
[02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:20.217]  Where you want.
[02:18:21.017 --> 02:18:26.039]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[02:18:26.859 --> 02:18:29.700]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:30.480]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:30.960]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:31.120]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:18:43.223 --> 02:18:49.448]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:49.908 --> 02:18:57.674]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:58.015 --> 02:19:05.861]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:06.181 --> 02:19:10.945]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:11.265 --> 02:19:15.969]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:20.353]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:20.833 --> 02:19:21.854]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:21.934 --> 02:19:26.017]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:19:26.438 --> 02:19:30.841]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:19:31.342 --> 02:19:33.864]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:19:34.324 --> 02:19:36.025]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.085 --> 02:19:36.325]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.345 --> 02:19:39.287]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:54.568 --> 02:19:58.670]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:07.795]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:20:08.595 --> 02:20:13.918]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:22.042]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:22.822 --> 02:20:23.322]  Just call 1-800
[02:20:24.906 --> 02:20:24.986]  516-8736.
[02:20:25.006 --> 02:20:25.686]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.726 --> 02:20:27.147]  It's absolutely free.
[02:20:27.267 --> 02:20:29.468]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:20:29.488 --> 02:20:30.089]  Just call right now.
[02:20:42.797 --> 02:20:45.800]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:54.969]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:20:55.289 --> 02:20:59.954]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:21:00.434 --> 02:21:07.162]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:21:07.543 --> 02:21:19.357]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:19.797 --> 02:21:24.260]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:26.881]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:26.921 --> 02:21:28.742]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:21:28.762 --> 02:21:30.023]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:21:30.043 --> 02:21:31.504]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:21:31.524 --> 02:21:32.564]  Now get available in Iowa.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:22:07.974]  Alright, to answer Richard's first question, if you type in to a search engine, hundreds of cities throw out Patriot Act, you'll get news articles listing a whole bunch of the cities and saying over 400 in four states.
[02:22:08.034 --> 02:22:09.955]  The media's finally caught up to reality.
[02:22:10.596 --> 02:22:13.758]  Because back when they were saying 140 cities, it was over 300.
[02:22:13.798 --> 02:22:16.420]  Then when they were saying 250 plus cities, it was over 400.
[02:22:19.329 --> 02:22:21.550]  And there's some list out there on the web.
[02:22:22.691 --> 02:22:27.973]  The Bill of Rights Defense Committee and a bunch of other groups out there that have been pushing for this around the country.
[02:22:28.013 --> 02:22:31.455]  And it's on my site, but I can't direct you directly to it.
[02:22:31.475 --> 02:22:32.936]  I mean, that's what search engines are for.
[02:22:34.576 --> 02:22:36.277]  But it is exciting to see that happening.
[02:22:36.877 --> 02:22:38.298]  And then you mentioned the Dixie Chicks.
[02:22:38.318 --> 02:22:41.119]  The Dixie Chicks live here in Austin.
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.681]  And they did see Road to Tyranny.
[02:22:45.121 --> 02:22:45.722]  I know that.
[02:22:46.562 --> 02:22:48.503]  And they just said, hey, don't
[02:22:49.139 --> 02:22:50.139]  Blame us for Bush.
[02:22:50.179 --> 02:22:51.119]  We're embarrassed of him.
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:53.860]  Their full quote was, he's not from Texas.
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:07.303]  And the media, the neocon media, decided to use them as an example to demonize them, the record sales actually exploded, to intimidate everybody else and have a chilling effect going into the war.
[02:23:08.483 --> 02:23:14.464]  And I heard a neocon this morning on the radio, live from DC, a popular country singer,
[02:23:15.294 --> 02:23:18.395]  I'm talking about what a wonderful Texan Bush he is.
[02:23:18.435 --> 02:23:23.778]  Hell, a lot of the East Coast elites don't like his plain way of talking.
[02:23:24.518 --> 02:23:27.219]  He's just glad to have a real Texan.
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:36.763]  I've seen Bush slip out of his fake Texas talk many times into his dad's New Haven, Connecticut, blue blood, Atlantic, British accent.
[02:23:37.224 --> 02:23:40.085]  And I'm not saying it's bad to have that accent, but just don't come to my state.
[02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:50.789]  Be a blue blood, and then be a gun grabber, an open border promotin', tortured lovin', devil worshipin', piece of garbage, and then parade around like you're a Texan.
[02:23:51.549 --> 02:23:54.110]  I haven't even counted up all the generations I'm a Texan.
[02:23:54.130 --> 02:23:56.852]  What, 1830 on one side, 1844 on the other?
[02:23:58.872 --> 02:24:07.376]  I don't know, just since the turn of the last century, one, two, three, four, five, six, six generations, and then going back to the 1830s, three or four more generations.
[02:24:07.776 --> 02:24:09.897]  I don't know, I'm about as Texan as you can get.
[02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:17.939]  And again, it would be like if I was, you know, fifth generation, somebody from Illinois.
[02:24:18.379 --> 02:24:21.961]  Still come to my state and parade around about, you're a bunch of carpetbaggers.
[02:24:22.681 --> 02:24:24.382]  And Bush is a dirty carpetbagger.
[02:24:25.183 --> 02:24:28.246]  And I've got a, you know, the Dixie Chicks go, we're embarrassed of him.
[02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:29.667]  He's not even from Texas.
[02:24:29.687 --> 02:24:32.609]  Well, they cut that last part off and we're embarrassed of him.
[02:24:33.129 --> 02:24:34.510]  Oh, how dare you?
[02:24:34.530 --> 02:24:36.232]  How dare you?
[02:24:36.252 --> 02:24:41.336]  This is your not for the... I mean, I'm... Bush is afraid of horses, folks.
[02:24:41.916 --> 02:24:43.017]  That's been in the news.
[02:24:43.858 --> 02:24:46.220]  He has a fear of them.
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:48.481]  He doesn't like to get near them.
[02:24:50.083 --> 02:24:52.665]  I mean, he's a... He looks like a chimpanzee.
[02:24:53.025 --> 02:24:54.046]  Oh, I'm tired of him.
[02:24:54.978 --> 02:24:56.519]  And I don't hate Bush.
[02:24:56.559 --> 02:24:58.140]  He's a mindless puppet.
[02:24:59.261 --> 02:24:59.681]  Alright?
[02:25:00.062 --> 02:25:03.324]  Who likes to go to the Bohemian Grove where they bus in the male prostitutes.
[02:25:03.364 --> 02:25:04.125]  New York Post.
[02:25:04.885 --> 02:25:05.265]  You know?
[02:25:05.666 --> 02:25:06.526]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:25:06.566 --> 02:25:07.527]  I'm not a conservative.
[02:25:07.567 --> 02:25:09.068]  I'm not into male prostitutes.
[02:25:09.428 --> 02:25:10.849]  I'm not into banning guns.
[02:25:11.530 --> 02:25:14.012]  I'm not into appointing judges that are pro-abortion.
[02:25:15.052 --> 02:25:15.913]  I'm a liberal!
[02:25:17.274 --> 02:25:18.074]  I'm against it!
[02:25:19.756 --> 02:25:20.136]  Alright?
[02:25:21.730 --> 02:25:24.531]  I'm not a Constitutionalist because I'm for the Constitution.
[02:25:24.892 --> 02:25:27.853]  Bush says he's a Constitutionalist because he's butchering the Constitution.
[02:25:28.013 --> 02:25:28.853]  Well, then I'm not!
[02:25:29.634 --> 02:25:32.135]  I'm engaging in reverse double-think here now.
[02:25:33.156 --> 02:25:48.683]  But the Dixie Chips, yes, the Dixie, thinking about lunch, the Dixie Chicks are not, I mean, they're just, you know, they were just entertainers who were picked out to be targeted because they engaged in the First Amendment.
[02:25:50.011 --> 02:25:52.712]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[02:25:52.752 --> 02:25:53.413]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:25:53.893 --> 02:25:54.393]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:54.433 --> 02:25:55.394]  That was pretty good.
[02:25:55.594 --> 02:25:59.975]  Listen, I don't want to digress from my original reason in calling, but I'll say these two things.
[02:26:00.616 --> 02:26:01.876]  First off, he doesn't like horses.
[02:26:01.916 --> 02:26:05.858]  Of course, horses look you straight in the eye, if I seem to recall from when I came off a flock.
[02:26:05.878 --> 02:26:10.420]  Yeah, what do you think of that article in the AP and Scripps Shower News Service, don't look at President Bush?
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:17.243]  I think it's so typical of the type of characters that we now have straddling, and I say straddling, not governing us.
[02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:19.930]  It's just par for their course.
[02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:21.091]  And that's it.
[02:26:21.451 --> 02:26:22.231]  That's the way they are.
[02:26:22.511 --> 02:26:28.572]  Many, many dictatorial types in history have seemed to have that mental quirk or phobia.
[02:26:29.192 --> 02:26:31.312]  But, you know, I'll get to my point in a second.
[02:26:31.332 --> 02:26:35.113]  I just want to say this with reference to your last guess about that material he made.
[02:26:36.013 --> 02:26:44.135]  Does he really want to supply a diabolical system like we have in place today with more of an advantage than it already has?
[02:26:45.455 --> 02:26:46.555]  That's something to think about.
[02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:50.793]  Well, I guarantee you, the government's already developed all this stuff.
[02:26:50.853 --> 02:26:51.793]  It's just classified.
[02:26:52.494 --> 02:26:55.076]  Well, I think if they developed it, they'd be utilizing it.
[02:26:55.156 --> 02:27:01.761]  They may not have, because, well, they have their own reasons, and I believe it's because, let's face it, this guy invented something.
[02:27:02.261 --> 02:27:06.304]  He's not part of their circle, so they can't benefit from the use of that item.
[02:27:06.324 --> 02:27:12.689]  But I'm not sure that I would want to supply somebody with more of an advantage, or an entity with more of an advantage, being it's unethical.
[02:27:13.149 --> 02:27:14.930]  But my point now is, I want to get to this report.
[02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:15.551]  Yeah, stay there!
[02:27:16.266 --> 02:27:19.648]  We'll come back to you, Ron and DJ, Ed, Craig and others.
[02:27:20.649 --> 02:27:24.971]  And China's threatening Japan, our little ally, China.
[02:27:25.932 --> 02:27:28.633]  At it again, if you're not for China, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:33.696 --> 02:27:36.698]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.598 --> 02:27:40.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.706 --> 02:27:49.949]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.690]  I use it.
[02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:53.031]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[02:27:53.091 --> 02:27:59.254]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie, and it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[02:27:59.654 --> 02:28:01.415]  And what it is, is a wedge device.
[02:28:01.875 --> 02:28:02.616]  Just a small one.
[02:28:02.956 --> 02:28:04.897]  That you put underneath your sacrum.
[02:28:05.217 --> 02:28:06.438]  And then you get down on it.
[02:28:06.478 --> 02:28:07.839]  You put your weight down on it.
[02:28:07.919 --> 02:28:08.459]  On the floor.
[02:28:08.919 --> 02:28:10.720]  And you let gravity do the work.
[02:28:11.141 --> 02:28:13.462]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away.
[02:28:13.762 --> 02:28:15.143]  Chiropractors go away.
[02:28:15.183 --> 02:28:16.324]  You don't need them anymore.
[02:28:16.644 --> 02:28:17.764]  You gotta give it a try.
[02:28:18.105 --> 02:28:20.266]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[02:28:20.826 --> 02:28:22.107]  We're good to go.
[02:28:42.924 --> 02:28:50.433]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:50.713 --> 02:29:01.626]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:01.886 --> 02:29:03.707]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:03.967 --> 02:29:07.289]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:07.629 --> 02:29:18.095]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:18.375 --> 02:29:18.876]  That's right!
[02:29:19.056 --> 02:29:26.160]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:30.583]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:29:30.743 --> 02:29:35.206]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:35.927]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.484 --> 02:29:50.986]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:51.406 --> 02:29:55.947]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:56.067 --> 02:30:02.909]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:09.371]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:09.531 --> 02:30:10.731]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:11.091 --> 02:30:14.035]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:14.196 --> 02:30:16.158]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:16.519 --> 02:30:23.749]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:24.069 --> 02:30:27.434]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:27.874 --> 02:30:30.955]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:30.975 --> 02:30:31.015]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:31.035 --> 02:30:31.115]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:31.155 --> 02:30:32.515]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[02:30:32.535 --> 02:30:36.617]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:36.637 --> 02:30:38.497]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:53.991 --> 02:30:59.080]  Look, we got a corrupt world government getting rid of all of our freedoms, doing nothing to keep us safe.
[02:31:00.583 --> 02:31:02.106]  And it just goes downhill from here.
[02:31:02.817 --> 02:31:03.957]  Unless we turn this around.
[02:31:03.977 --> 02:31:05.778]  Unless we say no to this system.
[02:31:06.098 --> 02:31:10.659]  All the government does is prance around and go, give up your freedom, we'll take care of you.
[02:31:10.919 --> 02:31:11.859]  Give up your freedom.
[02:31:11.899 --> 02:31:13.459]  Hey, did you know you can give up your freedom?
[02:31:13.699 --> 02:31:18.300]  Now we're going to take some more of your freedoms and some more of your rights to keep you safe, okay?
[02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:19.861]  Now you just do what we say.
[02:31:19.901 --> 02:31:22.361]  We've got to watch and control and tell you what to do.
[02:31:22.861 --> 02:31:25.502]  Well, the government's made up of human beings too.
[02:31:26.202 --> 02:31:28.583]  But the government tells you they're infallible.
[02:31:30.063 --> 02:31:30.323]  Sick.
[02:31:31.474 --> 02:31:34.376]  To see our beloved country, our beloved world, being turned into this.
[02:31:35.777 --> 02:31:39.920]  Before I go back to Ron, DJ, Ed, and Craig, that'll be it for Call, because I want to cover some more news.
[02:31:40.901 --> 02:31:43.783]  Didn't plug my videos last hour, so I think I should do it now.
[02:31:45.064 --> 02:31:48.306]  Folks, I have made 11 films.
[02:31:48.406 --> 02:31:49.047]  And you know that!
[02:31:49.107 --> 02:31:50.168]  You've heard me talk about that.
[02:31:50.808 --> 02:31:53.390]  But still a lot of you have not ordered them.
[02:31:55.103 --> 02:32:00.107]  Imagine seeing John Ashcroft say, Patriot Act II doesn't exist.
[02:32:00.607 --> 02:32:02.929]  If you say it exists, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:02.949 --> 02:32:03.990]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:32:05.151 --> 02:32:06.231]  It is an urban legend.
[02:32:07.152 --> 02:32:12.176]  And then we show his signature, his enrollment on the bill, you know, six months before that he introduced.
[02:32:12.196 --> 02:32:15.318]  And then we show him months later after going, yes, of course I introduced it.
[02:32:15.398 --> 02:32:15.978]  It's good.
[02:32:16.259 --> 02:32:17.920]  Pass it or the terrorists will get you.
[02:32:19.661 --> 02:32:20.982]  And they've since passed much of it.
[02:32:21.422 --> 02:32:23.224]  You know, that's three or four minutes
[02:32:24.219 --> 02:32:29.360]  of a two-hour, forty-four minute film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:32.681]  And every three or four minutes covers something else.
[02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:34.041]  It just covers it all.
[02:32:34.441 --> 02:32:41.703]  Goes over the lies, goes over the corruption, goes over the architecture of the New World Order, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:32:41.763 --> 02:32:44.743]  I sneak into Bohemian Grove and show you the satanic rituals going on there.
[02:32:44.783 --> 02:32:45.503]  It's a great film.
[02:32:45.903 --> 02:32:47.984]  Why any of you wouldn't order that, I have no idea.
[02:32:48.004 --> 02:32:48.924]  It's a must-have.
[02:32:51.081 --> 02:32:55.863]  There's my two 9-11-films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[02:32:56.324 --> 02:32:59.185]  I'm still offering 9-11 The Road to Tyranny for $24.95.
[02:32:59.545 --> 02:33:01.286]  Almost three hours long on DVD.
[02:33:02.487 --> 02:33:06.489]  A second copy is only $5.95 to give somebody as a gift.
[02:33:06.529 --> 02:33:09.030]  As many copies as you want when you get the DVDs.
[02:33:09.931 --> 02:33:12.052]  A bunch of other videos I carry.
[02:33:12.452 --> 02:33:15.894]  George Humphrey's 9-11 The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[02:33:16.214 --> 02:33:17.835]  An amazing 9-11 film.
[02:33:18.215 --> 02:33:19.475]  Eric Huffman's video, 9-11
[02:33:21.963 --> 02:33:22.943]  The Great Deception!
[02:33:25.544 --> 02:33:29.826]  You need to have these videos, you need to have these materials.
[02:33:30.706 --> 02:33:34.868]  And I know sometimes the show sounds depressing, and oh my gosh, you know, what can we do?
[02:33:35.308 --> 02:33:44.772]  All we can do is resist this, talk about it, warn people, and that's what happened with the Committees of Correspondence in a decade before the Revolutionary War in this country.
[02:33:45.296 --> 02:33:46.276]  People got together.
[02:33:46.316 --> 02:33:51.558]  They had these little newsletters that went around listing the crimes of the crown, listing the abuses.
[02:33:51.918 --> 02:33:52.878]  People had meetings.
[02:33:52.918 --> 02:33:56.539]  They talked about what the abuses were, who was doing it, and how to stop it.
[02:33:57.539 --> 02:33:58.779]  And that's what we're doing in 2005.
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:06.001]  And so I want to thank all those that have gotten the videos, that have made copies of them, that have put them on AXS TV.
[02:34:06.101 --> 02:34:06.941]  Re-air them again.
[02:34:07.242 --> 02:34:07.922]  Get the new ones.
[02:34:08.022 --> 02:34:08.522]  Air those.
[02:34:08.882 --> 02:34:10.182]  Show them to your college students.
[02:34:10.262 --> 02:34:11.363]  Show them to your high school students.
[02:34:11.703 --> 02:34:12.883]  Show it at your Sunday school.
[02:34:13.737 --> 02:34:18.158]  You know, show it at your business.
[02:34:18.238 --> 02:34:19.519]  Just get it out to people.
[02:34:20.079 --> 02:34:21.679]  Toll-free number to order.
[02:34:21.779 --> 02:34:23.120]  A bunch of different discounts.
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:24.620]  A bunch of different specials.
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:26.140]  When you call, ask about titles.
[02:34:26.541 --> 02:34:27.501]  Ask about discounts.
[02:34:27.941 --> 02:34:29.941]  Ask about what the different films cover.
[02:34:30.462 --> 02:34:32.282]  And if you don't want to get any of the films, you don't have to order.
[02:34:32.302 --> 02:34:35.163]  But you can call and ask questions about the films or the books.
[02:34:36.064 --> 02:34:46.654]  One, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, or you can just write to me.
[02:34:46.734 --> 02:34:50.919]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:57.216 --> 02:34:58.716]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back
[02:35:24.614 --> 02:35:25.855]  To Ron in New York.
[02:35:25.915 --> 02:35:27.175]  Ron, finish up what you were saying.
[02:35:27.455 --> 02:35:29.836]  Okay, it's about the Mexican Matricula card.
[02:35:30.096 --> 02:35:32.477]  A big article in today's New York Sun.
[02:35:33.858 --> 02:35:38.379]  It's indicated in there, first off, these cards are like two-bit cards that are easily faked.
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:39.080]  Alright?
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:49.624]  They're being issued by a government that has a vested interest in looting this country, and by the government in power in this country, which I guess has a vested interest in allowing that to go on.
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:57.005]  You realize that you could go into a bank and open an account, and they say that the Citicorp group encourages it with this matricular card.
[02:35:57.085 --> 02:36:05.891]  Yet, conversely, if you're a generational, native-born American, you'll practically have to pull in a steamer trunk of identification to open an account in the bank.
[02:36:06.371 --> 02:36:13.076]  Now, the Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge, says he doesn't approve of the cards, but yet he doesn't say that he forbids their use.
[02:36:13.556 --> 02:36:15.438]  Let me tell you how this spin works.
[02:36:16.258 --> 02:36:18.600]  Did you hear me at the first of the broadcast talk about this?
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.961]  No, I didn't catch it because the reception was kind of bad up here until about the time your guest came on.
[02:36:23.222 --> 02:36:25.502]  Okay, well let me break this down again.
[02:36:26.303 --> 02:36:27.023]  This is important.
[02:36:27.043 --> 02:36:28.843]  I'm glad that you've said this.
[02:36:29.264 --> 02:36:30.724]  What you said is totally accurate.
[02:36:31.704 --> 02:36:33.205]  It isn't just the Mexican government.
[02:36:33.505 --> 02:36:35.926]  Over 30 nations issue matriculas.
[02:36:36.806 --> 02:36:41.848]  We use the term matricula, that's the Spanish for the consular card, the council card.
[02:36:43.368 --> 02:36:48.130]  I had, two years ago, the leader of the Republican Senate in Colorado on
[02:36:49.471 --> 02:36:56.533]  Who in one day himself went out and got four matricula cards with different names.
[02:36:58.194 --> 02:37:01.335]  Twenty-five dollars, the Mexicans will sell them to anybody.
[02:37:02.275 --> 02:37:13.679]  Now, then earlier last year, we went and bullhorned, it made the Associated Press and Reuters, we went and bullhorned Vicente Fox, shut down his press conference at the Governor's Mansion,
[02:37:14.545 --> 02:37:19.588]  He came to Austin, gave the Governor an award for violating the law, getting rid of the borders, openly.
[02:37:20.068 --> 02:37:32.536]  Gave the Austin Police Department an award, and gave Wells Fargo an award, because Wells Fargo doesn't just accept the matricula cards from Poland, Russia, China, Mexico, Venezuela.
[02:37:33.237 --> 02:37:36.359]  Numerous countries are now trying to issue them, they are.
[02:37:36.999 --> 02:37:38.900]  But here's the deal, I tell you after it's already happened.
[02:37:39.621 --> 02:37:40.261]  But here's the deal.
[02:37:42.694 --> 02:37:44.935]  But, Wells Fargo just doesn't do that.
[02:37:45.235 --> 02:37:49.797]  They're issuing an ID card that the state of Texas, Wells Fargo is.
[02:37:50.558 --> 02:37:53.219]  That the state of Texas is going to accept his ID card.
[02:37:53.279 --> 02:37:55.280]  Now, let's go further here.
[02:37:56.801 --> 02:38:01.583]  And I've had Ron Paul on, it's in the bill folks, in the 9-11 bill they passed a month and a half ago.
[02:38:02.407 --> 02:38:10.692]  It actually says the states are to accept these matricula to get driver's license, to get bank accounts, to get jobs.
[02:38:10.932 --> 02:38:12.593]  The banks were already doing it, but you're right.
[02:38:12.953 --> 02:38:16.235]  You or I go in, and we're a citizen.
[02:38:17.356 --> 02:38:22.518]  They make us show three forms of ID, at least, and then usually a bill or something.
[02:38:22.939 --> 02:38:23.459]  Absolutely.
[02:38:23.519 --> 02:38:28.322]  And I've talked to friends who manage, one lady manages the biggest apartment complex in Austin.
[02:38:28.582 --> 02:38:29.823]  She went to a corporate meeting in Dallas.
[02:38:29.843 --> 02:38:30.403]  They told them, look,
[02:38:31.562 --> 02:38:42.544]  You let ten illegals live in an apartment for one person, but if somebody who's an American, regardless of color, has their grandma visiting for a week, you fine them and kick them out.
[02:38:43.204 --> 02:38:45.685]  Because we want to make room for the illegals.
[02:38:46.025 --> 02:38:49.566]  They actually told her this in the board meeting.
[02:38:49.666 --> 02:38:54.167]  It is designed to drive the wages down and destroy this country.
[02:38:54.487 --> 02:38:59.888]  And then this morning, I'm listening to local radio, and they've got congressmen on there,
[02:39:01.379 --> 02:39:20.906]  Michael McCall and others, who was part of Homeland Security beforehand, saying, well, we've got to have the standardization of driver's licenses that we just passed, because this is going to stop Al-Qaeda and it's going to stop the illegal aliens, and the three hosts went, yes, yes, it's wonderful, good job, national ID cards.
[02:39:21.106 --> 02:39:21.326]  Alex.
[02:39:21.746 --> 02:39:23.167]  This is having me sick!
[02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:28.489]  Alex, the ironic part about it is the Patriot Act mandates you, a native generational American,
[02:39:28.969 --> 02:39:39.272]  Has to show multiple pieces of identification to do banking transactions and credit cards, and yet somebody could walk in with this fake, phony, easily forged document and do everything you could do.
[02:39:39.592 --> 02:39:43.593]  What do you call it when you have, and it is not, we say we, and we've got to change our jargon.
[02:39:43.913 --> 02:39:45.894]  It's not we and it's not our government anymore.
[02:39:45.974 --> 02:39:49.935]  It is the government and it is the power in this country, but it's not necessarily our government.
[02:39:50.275 --> 02:39:52.516]  Because what kind of government, if it was your government,
[02:39:52.776 --> 02:39:53.597]  Hey, that's my point!
[02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:56.719]  The new amnesty package, they got part of it in this 9-11 bill, but the full package...
[02:40:08.050 --> 02:40:16.134]  We'll bring in more foreigners and the government will pay corporations a supplement to fly skilled and unskilled here.
[02:40:16.474 --> 02:40:19.516]  And when you say the government, who finances this government?
[02:40:19.596 --> 02:40:21.777]  Your money, your hard-earned sweat finances it.
[02:40:21.797 --> 02:40:24.498]  You're paying for your own lynching is essentially what you're doing.
[02:40:24.899 --> 02:40:35.824]  And by the way folks, you just joined us, understand the spin on talk radio is Bush is doing something about them illegals with this national ID card when the bill actually opens it up to them.
[02:40:36.384 --> 02:40:37.065]  It's sick!
[02:40:37.605 --> 02:40:49.768]  He's using sophistry and rhetoric verbally to lull you to sleep, but in fact his actions and things that he supports legislatively facilitate the swamping of your nation.
[02:40:50.368 --> 02:40:52.189]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:54.589]  This is really what's happening.
[02:40:54.609 --> 02:40:56.790]  I almost called into this talk show this morning.
[02:40:57.370 --> 02:41:01.756]  But I was too busy and I just wanted to say, you know, here's the subsection of the bill.
[02:41:02.197 --> 02:41:02.797]  Here it is.
[02:41:02.917 --> 02:41:03.819]  This is what they're doing.
[02:41:03.859 --> 02:41:06.142]  How dare you say that, Congressman?
[02:41:06.802 --> 02:41:12.510]  And then another show had Lamar Smith on saying the same thing, another talk show.
[02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:14.172]  They're reading off a script.
[02:41:14.847 --> 02:41:15.707]  That's what they're doing.
[02:41:15.767 --> 02:41:18.668]  They know what they're doing, particularly those in political power.
[02:41:18.768 --> 02:41:22.530]  They're lying us into sleep, into a narcosis.
[02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:33.353]  And many people are buying it because they think that the party, the conservative or the republican party or George Bush, is their grandpappy's republican or conservative party.
[02:41:33.393 --> 02:41:34.574]  Well, folks, it's not.
[02:41:35.274 --> 02:41:35.634]  It's not.
[02:41:36.394 --> 02:41:43.764]  It's a name and a label that it uses to facilitate its conduct, which is anything but the type of conduct that... Hey, let me ask you a question.
[02:41:43.804 --> 02:41:45.966]  You've been calling for many years, Ron, and I'm gonna go to other calls.
[02:41:45.986 --> 02:41:46.367]  Sure.
[02:41:47.498 --> 02:41:50.499]  I have the Scotsman, I have Ergonomics Today, I have Reuters.
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:42:02.245]  They're trying to pass regulations that every car will have a camera in it with AI technology scanning your eyes, scanning your eye movement, listening to you, listening for keywords.
[02:42:02.645 --> 02:42:08.207]  It even says, you know, if you're arguing with your wife, it picks up on that.
[02:42:08.347 --> 02:42:09.228]  Speech patterns.
[02:42:10.368 --> 02:42:12.109]  It's hooked into a cell phone in the dash.
[02:42:13.032 --> 02:42:15.634]  And it beams back to the emergency management system.
[02:42:15.975 --> 02:42:18.677]  And if you don't stop, it calls the police on you.
[02:42:18.897 --> 02:42:20.939]  They're gonna have AI cameras.
[02:42:21.379 --> 02:42:22.840]  Folks, I told you about the toll roads.
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:24.562]  I told you about the satellite boxes.
[02:42:24.582 --> 02:42:25.823]  I told you about the chips.
[02:42:25.863 --> 02:42:26.843]  You better listen to me.
[02:42:27.324 --> 02:42:30.426]  They are going to put it in the cars.
[02:42:30.486 --> 02:42:31.908]  They're openly saying it.
[02:42:32.768 --> 02:42:37.953]  MSNBC three years ago said it's, well, in case children are locked in the car and they eat the infrared camera.
[02:42:38.273 --> 02:42:39.254]  All these different reasons.
[02:42:39.474 --> 02:42:39.994]  Folks, that's 1984!
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:44.381]  Those reasons are all dribble, Alex.
[02:42:44.401 --> 02:42:45.241]  They're minimal.
[02:42:45.341 --> 02:42:46.122]  They're plebeian.
[02:42:46.562 --> 02:42:53.204]  They're just using them to sail this type of thing through because they have another agenda that... Camera's in the car watching us, folks!
[02:42:53.305 --> 02:42:54.565]  It doesn't get any worse!
[02:42:54.785 --> 02:42:56.266]  We have them in the toilets already.
[02:42:56.546 --> 02:43:00.868]  I guess we figured if people tolerated that, when they're on a commode, why not in the cars?
[02:43:01.308 --> 02:43:04.849]  Listen, this isn't just an affront to our Constitution and American way of life.
[02:43:04.929 --> 02:43:08.591]  It's getting so severe that it is now an affront to our basic human dignity.
[02:43:09.111 --> 02:43:15.713]  Ron, Ron, Ron, I guess we're radical though because we can read the Associated Press saying school districts are putting cameras in the showers.
[02:43:15.753 --> 02:43:21.095]  I guess we're weird because we read the scientific Nobel Prize winners finding age virus in the vaccines.
[02:43:21.415 --> 02:43:29.878]  I guess we're weird because we read Henry Kissinger's own 1973 document declassified 1992 where he openly said sterilize half your women or no money.
[02:43:30.179 --> 02:43:34.200]  I guess we're bad because we actually know what's going on here.
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:34.780]  That's right.
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:39.165]  We're informed and intelligent Americans and ethical human beings.
[02:43:39.546 --> 02:43:40.286]  That's what we are.
[02:43:40.527 --> 02:43:41.167]  They're weird.
[02:43:41.548 --> 02:43:42.249]  They're strange.
[02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:46.333]  They're outside the scope of normal human behavior, normal social behavior.
[02:43:46.713 --> 02:43:50.718]  And it's time we start calling them what they are and start proclaiming what we are.
[02:43:51.078 --> 02:43:52.339]  We are the real patriots.
[02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:53.801]  They are the anti-patriot.
[02:43:53.821 --> 02:43:55.002]  We are the real Americans.
[02:43:55.042 --> 02:43:56.124]  They are the un-American.
[02:43:56.764 --> 02:43:58.204]  That's what we've got to start saying.
[02:43:58.625 --> 02:44:02.566]  We've got to start speaking in a lexicon, in a jargon, so we don't get confused.
[02:44:02.586 --> 02:44:06.406]  Like, for instance, when you said before, and you caught yourself, to your credit, we do.
[02:44:06.747 --> 02:44:08.067]  We've got to stop talking like that.
[02:44:08.367 --> 02:44:09.147]  We don't do that.
[02:44:09.447 --> 02:44:10.127]  They do that.
[02:44:10.608 --> 02:44:13.048]  It's not... Yeah, we're not in Iraq.
[02:44:13.388 --> 02:44:16.069]  We're not giving nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[02:44:16.729 --> 02:44:18.149]  We're not getting rid of the borders.
[02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:20.170]  The criminals that run this country are.
[02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:23.071]  I've never, you and I have never murdered a child.
[02:44:23.371 --> 02:44:27.472]  Though I'm sure that they have a long list of doing things like that under various different pretenses.
[02:44:27.872 --> 02:44:31.153]  You and I have never, ever, and would never consider bombing an innocent person.
[02:44:31.473 --> 02:44:34.694]  The Lord knows that they have done enough of that over a long period of time.
[02:44:35.054 --> 02:44:39.515]  So we have to start speaking in ways, because remember, you think as you speak.
[02:44:39.855 --> 02:44:46.557]  And we have to develop the jargon, the language, and the lexicon that makes us conscious of the fact that there is a difference there.
[02:44:46.617 --> 02:44:47.297]  Now, great point.
[02:44:47.337 --> 02:44:47.897]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:48.337 --> 02:44:48.938]  Great call.
[02:44:49.198 --> 02:44:50.899]  DJ in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:44:53.801 --> 02:44:54.901]  No one wants DJ.
[02:44:55.362 --> 02:44:57.383]  I was very intrigued by the guy that you had on.
[02:44:58.444 --> 02:45:01.045]  He actually is not pie in the sky.
[02:45:01.726 --> 02:45:03.407]  He has actually proven what he's talking about.
[02:45:03.827 --> 02:45:08.530]  But that's enough to make anybody in a military family really, really mad.
[02:45:09.071 --> 02:45:13.914]  Well no, he's proven the cheap armor that's impregnable.
[02:45:14.714 --> 02:45:15.595]  That's my point.
[02:45:15.835 --> 02:45:16.956]  Now this limbic system.
[02:45:18.709 --> 02:45:40.629]  As long as it's been available, as long as he has had the invitations to it, it proves that 99. how many percent of the soldiers' deaths have been wrongful deaths, and that not just the Bush, but the Clinton administration as well, don't care, they're more interested in cannon fodder, and they need to be investigated, and if need be, prosecuted.
[02:45:40.649 --> 02:45:42.491]  This is so stupid!
[02:45:43.982 --> 02:45:44.403]  Yes, I heard that.
[02:45:44.463 --> 02:45:47.808]  Now how many other military families out there wouldn't have had funerals if the officials that
[02:45:59.997 --> 02:46:01.838]  Supposedly, we put an office.
[02:46:01.898 --> 02:46:03.979]  But see, we call them officials and authorities.
[02:46:04.279 --> 02:46:05.440]  They are servants.
[02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:08.222]  But notice how we're now civilians.
[02:46:08.602 --> 02:46:13.885]  They're officials, meaning officers over us, as if we're all in some military boot camp.
[02:46:15.426 --> 02:46:22.270]  Okay, now what's the odds of doing a recourse suit of those that actually got this guy's invitations and refused it?
[02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:26.092]  The problem is the government's so corrupt, the judges are so corrupt, they just throw them out.
[02:46:27.072 --> 02:46:28.253]  Yeah, I don't doubt that.
[02:46:29.164 --> 02:46:32.528]  We got Stanley Hilton tomorrow coming on about his 9-11 suit being thrown out.
[02:46:32.828 --> 02:46:37.733]  Yeah, he was talking about it actually being possible for people to get that.
[02:46:38.093 --> 02:46:43.139]  I mean, if families have gone and bought body armor for their soldiers, why can't we
[02:46:44.318 --> 02:46:47.801]  Get ahold of this guy and get something useful for our family members.
[02:46:47.821 --> 02:46:48.682]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:46:49.202 --> 02:46:56.829]  It's a very small manufacturing process and this is a fabric-filled casing that would be put on the bottoms and sides of the vehicles.
[02:46:58.210 --> 02:47:00.612]  A lot like reactive armor, thanks for the call.
[02:47:01.012 --> 02:47:03.294]  So it would have to be a Pentagon-sanctioned thing.
[02:47:03.815 --> 02:47:05.496]  Let's talk to Ed in Illinois.
[02:47:05.616 --> 02:47:06.197]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:47:10.026 --> 02:47:14.108]  God bless you and everything that you're doing for my family and myself.
[02:47:14.448 --> 02:47:15.009]  Thank you, Ed.
[02:47:15.029 --> 02:47:15.729]  Thank you for calling.
[02:47:15.749 --> 02:47:16.330]  What's on your mind?
[02:47:16.990 --> 02:47:20.312]  I have an idea about promoting your tapes and website.
[02:47:21.293 --> 02:47:36.042]  The who, what, when, where, and how is, who would be, if we can get 5, 10, 15, 20 people in different areas to call in to talk show hosts and either ask them if they've heard of InfoWars or your video, etc.
[02:47:37.297 --> 02:47:46.162]  But what would be like, the first person would ask the question, maybe another person would call, the second person would call in and say, oh, I've heard about that.
[02:47:46.222 --> 02:47:47.563]  Yeah, that's really good, you know.
[02:47:47.603 --> 02:47:49.905]  Well, that already happens naturally.
[02:47:50.085 --> 02:47:58.970]  I mean, I get emails every day where a bunch of people, listeners, one listener calls in, another listener calls into the show, and then the talk show host calls me up and has me on as a guest.
[02:47:59.550 --> 02:48:04.693]  I understand that, and this would just be kind of an orchestrated
[02:48:06.638 --> 02:48:08.638]  thing, you know, that we could do like that.
[02:48:09.859 --> 02:48:12.799]  I think it's just as good to have you guys inform and call in and do it.
[02:48:12.879 --> 02:48:28.543]  I frankly... Well, no, I've got an email address that if anybody's interested in doing this and getting kind of, you know, together on this, then we could maybe promote it and you wouldn't have to do a thing.
[02:48:29.683 --> 02:48:30.843]  Well, that sounds good.
[02:48:30.883 --> 02:48:33.224]  Why don't you write up a little article with your idea
[02:48:34.145 --> 02:48:39.709]  Send it to Paul Watson and we'll post it on our Yahoo group and send it out to a bunch of people.
[02:48:40.489 --> 02:48:40.809]  Alright?
[02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:42.370]  Do that.
[02:48:43.051 --> 02:48:44.572]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:44.752 --> 02:48:47.834]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:47.974 --> 02:48:51.876]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:51.936 --> 02:48:56.139]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:56.499 --> 02:49:00.282]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:00.362 --> 02:49:02.223]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:02.803 --> 02:49:05.705]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:05.745 --> 02:49:10.488]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:10.628 --> 02:49:13.669]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:13.849 --> 02:49:16.711]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:17.191 --> 02:49:23.335]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:23.855 --> 02:49:27.637]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:28.037 --> 02:49:29.397]  Order your video today.
[02:49:29.797 --> 02:49:30.798]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.

[02:49:42.282 --> 02:49:44.243]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:44.323 --> 02:49:55.046]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:55.426 --> 02:49:59.948]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[02:50:00.008 --> 02:50:11.352]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:11.932 --> 02:50:18.782]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:19.183 --> 02:50:21.326]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:21.827 --> 02:50:26.774]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:50:38.639 --> 02:50:38.679]  888-803-4438.

[02:51:49.193 --> 02:51:50.275]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:51:50.415 --> 02:51:57.584]  On PrisonPlanet.com, we have a little 20-minute report from the BBC, where they lavishly
[02:52:08.669 --> 02:52:25.333]  It's a radio interview, lavishly, oh how convenient, how fun, and how it'll control people, and how that's good, how we need implantable microchips, and how great it is that bars in England are gonna make you take a chip to be in the bar.
[02:52:27.074 --> 02:52:34.395]  That's already happening in Miami, it's happening in Spain, it's happening all over the place now, I mean it's really happening.
[02:52:35.015 --> 02:52:37.036]  And I guess I'm weird because I'm against that.
[02:52:37.762 --> 02:52:39.682]  You're normal because you want your implantable chip.
[02:52:39.742 --> 02:52:39.982]  Okay.
[02:52:40.443 --> 02:52:44.223]  China warns Japan against unilateral action following new defense plan.
[02:52:44.743 --> 02:52:56.266]  China yesterday urged Japan to refrain from unilateral action following reports that Tokyo has developed a plan to defend the island if disputed parts of the East China Sea.
[02:52:57.706 --> 02:53:03.947]  China always advocates that in disputes of the issue between China and Japan should be resolved through consultation.
[02:53:04.853 --> 02:53:07.860]  Both sides should refrain from any unilateral action.
[02:53:09.725 --> 02:53:11.809]  So it's a big
[02:53:13.175 --> 02:53:14.076]  Escalation.
[02:53:14.116 --> 02:53:15.977]  Here's the Washington Times' Bill Gertz.
[02:53:16.557 --> 02:53:18.578]  China builds up strategic sea lanes.
[02:53:18.658 --> 02:53:32.667]  China is building up military forces and setting up bases along the sea lanes from the Middle East to protect its power overseas and protect its oil shipments, according to a previously undisclosed internal report prepared for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.
[02:53:33.087 --> 02:53:34.888]  China is building strategic relationships.
[02:53:35.408 --> 02:53:39.011]  China's a much bigger threat than Iran or Syria, but let's just move all our industry over there.
[02:53:39.031 --> 02:53:39.411]  Let's just
[02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:06.101]  Let's just leave them alone.
[02:54:06.201 --> 02:54:08.421]  We can trust them.
[02:54:08.481 --> 02:54:09.642]  They're our good friends.
[02:54:10.462 --> 02:54:13.903]  Disaster looms for megacities, UN official says.
[02:54:14.483 --> 02:54:27.248]  Floods and other natural disasters could kill millions in the world's teeming megacities, and time is running out to prevent such a catastrophe, the United Nations point man on emergency relief said on Tuesday.
[02:54:27.828 --> 02:54:41.699]  Jan Eagland, the UN Director of Disaster Relief, said many of the world's mega cities, including Tokyo, are extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, and the poor were most at risk from lack of investment and planning.
[02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:43.260]  And their answer?
[02:54:43.861 --> 02:54:52.527]  World taxation to protect us from natural disasters, as if the UN can protect anybody from that.
[02:54:54.696 --> 02:54:57.258]  There's tons of news along these lines.
[02:54:57.298 --> 02:54:58.399]  We're out of time, folks.
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:05.645]  And I don't try to be negative on this broadcast, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:55:06.085 --> 02:55:07.886]  A lot of this stuff is scary we talk about.
[02:55:08.687 --> 02:55:11.309]  But it's very positive that we are talking about it.
[02:55:11.689 --> 02:55:13.891]  That we're informing people of what's happening.
[02:55:14.472 --> 02:55:15.452]  That we're involved.
[02:55:17.054 --> 02:55:23.759]  And the globalists have a lot of powerful tools at their disposal, but they get their real power through conning good people.
[02:55:24.545 --> 02:55:33.332]  By propagandizing the compartmentalized power structures that serve them into going along with the horrible things that they're setting up.
[02:55:34.352 --> 02:55:40.437]  And by compartmentalization, it's like little Lego pieces where people don't know what they're part of because they're not conscious of it.
[02:55:40.717 --> 02:55:41.838]  They don't look at the big picture.
[02:55:42.118 --> 02:55:45.401]  And the globalists assemble it and build these monstrosities.
[02:55:46.341 --> 02:55:48.002]  We've got to become involved.
[02:55:48.383 --> 02:55:53.807]  We've got to become involved in seeing the big picture and in helping to open the eyes of others around us.
[02:55:54.725 --> 02:55:57.046]  If we don't, we're going to live in a prison planet.
[02:55:57.626 --> 02:56:04.510]  We're going to live in a totally surveilled, micromanaged, force-drugged nightmare.
[02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:09.312]  We're going to be slaves to the state to a level that people never would endure.
[02:56:09.332 --> 02:56:15.675]  A new level of enslavement and servitude.
[02:56:16.535 --> 02:56:18.536]  And it isn't something you want to be part of.
[02:56:18.556 --> 02:56:22.178]  It isn't something you want to sign your children over to.
[02:56:23.223 --> 02:56:26.107]  A lot of people think that they can serve this system and that will protect them.
[02:56:26.848 --> 02:56:28.230]  History shows that's a fraud.
[02:56:28.570 --> 02:56:29.912]  So stand up for humanity.
