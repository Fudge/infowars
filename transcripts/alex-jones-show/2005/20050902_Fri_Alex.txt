[00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.606]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:08.328]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.150]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:13.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:17.777]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:22.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.723]  It's already September 2nd, 2005.
[00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.285]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:45.134]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours, continuing our coverage of the aftermath of Katrina that is threatening our very economy right now.
[00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:55.582]  We have the fumbling, fumbling control freak feds that are experts at taking our liberties and setting up checkpoints with police and black masks.
[00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:58.802]  But don't know how to deliver food and water to people.
[00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:13.509]  I mean it is frankly not that hard to deliver food and water to a sports stadium and they still have only had limited deliveries five days into this disaster.
[00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:22.894]  The FEMA chiefs told the people of New Orleans on Monday to get to the dome, the Superdome
[00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.952]  And when they got there, six police officers were waiting.
[00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:32.897]  And then they evacuated and basically barricaded themselves up in the police station.
[00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:45.628]  And there's so many facets to this, but I tell ya, I thought the mainstream media the first two or three days would never talk about how the government ordered the money slashed to fix the levies.
[00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:50.292]  I thought they'd never talk about the horrible response of FEMA and Chertoff.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:12.851]  And they tried the first few days to defend it, but now because of just the overwhelming outcry of the public around the country saying the Emperor has no clothes, the people universally decrying it on the streets, in the pockets of dry areas in New Orleans, they are just viciously attacking Bush right now that, well frankly, is pretty suspicious.
[00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.653]  I was watching CNN right before I went on air,
[00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:23.856]  And Bush was talking about how basically it's as if the whole Gulf Coast was hit by a powerful enemy weapon.
[00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.377]  Or bomb.
[00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.599]  And was just totally destroyed.
[00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:34.543]  And then they cut to the anchorwoman on CNN and she just said, that seems ridiculous, like a photo op.
[00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:37.024]  He's already been briefed, he knows what's going on.
[00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:38.786]  Why isn't he helping?
[00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:40.787]  Why isn't he doing something?
[00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.572]  And, you know, it seems spontaneous, though, like she was actually angry.
[00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.654]  It's as if they've lost control.
[00:02:48.014 --> 00:03:00.084]  Because I was thinking the very thing, you know, this... He's bumbling up there for ten minutes, and there's just dozens and dozens and dozens of helicopter pilots behind him, standing around, and they're all clapping for Bush.
[00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.547]  And I was thinking the same thing.
[00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.048]  What a disgusting photo op.
[00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:08.491]  I mean, I was surprised that he wasn't in some type of commando
[00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:12.337]  You know, Snake Plissken escaped from New York.
[00:03:12.377 --> 00:03:17.681]  I'm surprised he didn't paratroop in with Bill Clinton and his father, you know, to supply the cocaine route.
[00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:32.131]  But just because I was thinking it, and you were thinking it, why was CNN, that normally covers up for Bush and his globalist activities, Fox News has even been criticizing Lord Bush.
[00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:35.494]  Even that beady-eyed neocon Scarborough.
[00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:38.276]  I thought he was Alex Jones last night!
[00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:41.616]  When I was watching Scarborough Country.
[00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:45.158]  I mean, he was ranting and raving and spitting and frothing.
[00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:54.724]  The, uh, mayor has come out and said what a horrible job Bush is doing and grandstanding, flying over by Air Force One two days ago.
[00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.746]  So it's your chance to respond to all of this.
[00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.707]  When we get back, I'm going to write your calls.
[00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:03.048]  I'll hit a few of the headlines and we're going to write your calls.
[00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:03.128]  1-800-259-9231
[00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:16.424]  I have friends and family in New Orleans, in surrounding areas, I've talked to them, and it is ten times worse.
[00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:21.205]  Well, you heard the calls, many of them from Louisiana, yesterday.
[00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:25.746]  Ten times worse than we're even hearing.
[00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:37.328]  By the way, there's been a huge explosion overnight, and fires starting in multiple areas of the city, burning unabated, smoking large structures,
[00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:39.497]  Just bellowing in flames.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.043]  Well, the government can't, won't, and isn't protecting you.
[00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:51.109]  And I'll tell you what the most outlandish, most egregious thing is when we get back.
[00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.550]  And we have confirmed this.
[00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.953]  Just wait until we get back.
[00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:59.538]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are being updated every 10 minutes.
[00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.171]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:06.392]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:10.434]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:14.696]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:15.057 --> 00:05:18.839]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.840]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.301]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:25.402]  The medical bills!
[00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:29.023]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:32.224]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:35.245]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:41.868]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:46.210]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:47.971]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:49.352]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:04.616]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:08.378]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:12.399]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:18.781]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:27.104]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:32.870]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.794]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:39.016]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclainable.
[00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:41.258]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.498 --> 00:06:46.423]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.463 --> 00:06:50.587]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-424-9000.
[00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:53.251]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:54.793]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:02.765]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.829]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.969]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.533]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.753 --> 00:07:16.937]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:22.201]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.164]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:31.689]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.691]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:34.992 --> 00:07:35.893]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:41.938]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:07.397]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.944]  Folks, I'm not trying to shoot my horn here, but I think
[00:08:17.153 --> 00:08:22.151]  Folks out there really should pay attention to the issues that we focus in on.
[00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:53.515]  That we think are most important, because whereas the general public is focused in on football, and baseball, and basketball, or the newest cosmetics, or the newest vacation, or the newest diet plan, or the newest health food, me, me, me, always self-centered, we focus on geopolitical movements, on what the elites are saying, on what the elites are doing, on what investments they're making, on what preparations they're preparing for.
[00:08:55.499 --> 00:09:03.121]  And I remember last year that Houston Chronicle article that we have up on PrisonPlanet.com that we posted on Monday.
[00:09:05.842 --> 00:09:10.904]  From last year, a flashback we did, 500,000 could die if a Category 4 or 5 hurricane hits New Orleans.
[00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:22.581]  We saw the FEMA report in 2001, another in 2003.
[00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:25.482]  Because again, most of FEMA isn't evil people.
[00:09:25.562 --> 00:09:26.623]  It's the agenda at the top.
[00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:36.127]  And they have the hydrographers and the experts and the meteorologists and they said, look, even a glancing blow by a category 5 or 4 will flood the city.
[00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:39.289]  We will equalize with Lake Pontchartrain.
[00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:42.610]  This is a city of millions of people metro.
[00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.751]  Millions and millions.
[00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:50.566]  We have large portions, around 25% of our oil is brought in there.
[00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:53.948]  More than 25% is refined there.
[00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:56.150]  This is massive.
[00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:59.032]  You talk about national security.
[00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:00.954]  You talk about infrastructure.
[00:10:01.574 --> 00:10:02.875]  But no, no, no.
[00:10:02.955 --> 00:10:11.782]  We've got troops to march around Afghanistan and to march around Iraq and to set up checkpoints in Virginia and to set up checkpoints in Iowa.
[00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:21.869]  We have the newscast of checkpoints searching vehicles randomly, but we don't have troops to get in there and build those dikes to support those levees.
[00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:31.011]  I mean, folks, they have bigger dikes and levees around Houston, Texas that is above sea level than they do in New Orleans.
[00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:39.447]  There are many cities that have flooding problems that have better dikes and canal systems than New Orleans.
[00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:41.007]  I mean, Los Angeles does.
[00:10:41.547 --> 00:10:44.348]  They have giant canals feeding out to the sea.
[00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:50.110]  Because they've got a danger of flooding because of those mountains and being in that bowl.
[00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.090]  But nothing like being under sea level!
[00:10:53.531 --> 00:10:54.811]  Under the level of the ocean!
[00:10:57.493 --> 00:11:00.674]  And so we warn people, and we wrote articles about this.
[00:11:00.774 --> 00:11:07.397]  I mean, it's always listeners who remind us of this and go, hey, did you see this article you posted and the comment you made a year and a half ago?
[00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:08.637]  And then we go, oh, thank you.
[00:11:08.657 --> 00:11:10.998]  Well, thank you for pointing out that we pointed this out.
[00:11:12.098 --> 00:11:22.962]  And it's because there are millions of you, thousands of you sending us emails a day, thousands of you making points, doctors, scientists, lawyers, school teachers, mechanics, engineers,
[00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:29.598]  Hydrographers, you name it, listening to this broadcast and we listen to you.
[00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:36.160]  It isn't just a few pinheads at FEMA making all the decisions.
[00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:39.962]  We actually collectively look at the facts and look at the evidence.
[00:11:41.322 --> 00:11:46.524]  FEMA said the number one threat would be a nuclear meltdown or attack.
[00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:48.165]  Obviously.
[00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:55.466]  Number 2 would be a massive 7.5 or higher earthquake in San Francisco or L.A.
[00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.507]  It could kill hundreds of thousands, totally destroy the economy.
[00:11:58.687 --> 00:11:59.127]  That's number 2.
[00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:06.450]  Number 3 is New Orleans being hit by a category 4 or higher hurricane.
[00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.210]  Period.
[00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.871]  The city would cease to exist.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.982]  So it wasn't hard for us to get up here on air and go, what is wrong?
[00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:18.342]  One of the many things I pointed out.
[00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:24.665]  Why are we in Iraq when New Orleans is on the verge of turning into New Atlantis?
[00:12:25.306 --> 00:12:27.086]  You know, we've got York in Northern England.
[00:12:28.087 --> 00:12:29.187]  We've got New York here.
[00:12:29.267 --> 00:12:31.488]  Well, now we've got Atlantis somewhere in the Atlantic.
[00:12:31.789 --> 00:12:39.152]  But we've got New Atlantis down there on the eastern, southern, southeastern tip of Louisiana.
[00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:49.898]  And there are so many valiant people fighting and laboring and so many good Americans, so many good people in Louisiana.
[00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:55.522]  You've also got a very decadent population like you have in any big city who's completely out of control.
[00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.425]  And then you've got a lot of poor people who are being fed on by these creatures.
[00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:01.827]  And it's just a nightmare to watch.
[00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:08.492]  But on Monday we came out and said Bush didn't let them fix the dykes.
[00:13:09.338 --> 00:13:10.299]  People didn't believe that.
[00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:11.399]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.300]  I can't believe it.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.601]  It's all over the news now.
[00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:15.142]  It's all over the news.
[00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:17.563]  What we learned two days ago.
[00:13:18.544 --> 00:13:22.926]  That the French tried to bring in thousands of water filters.
[00:13:23.927 --> 00:13:25.268]  Using their heads, they said.
[00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:28.009]  This is in the French newspapers, by the way.
[00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.071]  Saying the same things we said.
[00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.812]  But we can't have those evil French help us.
[00:13:32.232 --> 00:13:33.833]  They just helped us found this country.
[00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.632]  It's just amazing how we're taught to hate the French.
[00:13:38.012 --> 00:13:47.497]  But the French came out and said, well, if you're having to fly tons of water in, but you can't fly tons of people out, wouldn't it be better just to fly water filters in?
[00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:52.860]  We're going to give you a couple thousand water filters and even fly some big units over.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.901]  And Bush said, no!
[00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:55.001]  No!
[00:13:56.962 --> 00:14:01.044]  And the British said, we're going to fly some experts in.
[00:14:01.405 --> 00:14:03.986]  And our government said, no, you'll just get in the way.
[00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:06.408]  You'll just get in the way.
[00:14:07.108 --> 00:14:19.514]  And citizens, uh, sheriffs and others would get posses together, what they're supposed to do, with hundreds of boats on trailers, and FEMA would actually commandeer their boats and trailers and then have them just sit there.
[00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:23.496]  This is actually now on national news.
[00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:25.577]  It's actually on the news wires.
[00:14:25.937 --> 00:14:26.598]  I can't believe it.
[00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:27.838]  We knew this two days ago.
[00:14:28.198 --> 00:14:30.540]  People couldn't believe it, but now it's mainstream news.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.421]  Can you imagine
[00:14:34.662 --> 00:14:37.903]  Can you imagine that... It's insane!
[00:14:38.483 --> 00:14:43.305]  And it's because FEMA bureaucrats that don't know what they're doing... I mean, I don't want to say they want to make this worse.
[00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:44.886]  I can't believe they want to do that.
[00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:45.726]  It makes them look bad.
[00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:49.467]  Maybe they've got some big plan down the line.
[00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:52.068]  I mean, maybe they plan to have the economy implode.
[00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:57.070]  Maybe they want gas prices at six bucks a gallon, as they are in some areas.
[00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.332]  I mean, I just can't imagine that they're this stupid and...
[00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:07.758]  Bottom line, folks, should they fly in the thousands of tons of water every day?
[00:15:07.778 --> 00:15:09.480]  That it takes?
[00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:13.065]  Or, which they can't even get delivered because it's all just stacking up?
[00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.909]  Because they won't let the citizens or the police do it?
[00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:21.980]  I mean the police chief didn't even stay in the city to tell the cops what to do.
[00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:26.544]  The cops are valiantly trying to do something in New Orleans.
[00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:29.267]  They have to meet in little groups and decide what to do.
[00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:33.070]  That's the quarter of the police that were valiant and stayed.
[00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.253]  They're saying 75% just walked off the job.
[00:15:38.135 --> 00:15:39.196]  Those 75% need to be fired.
[00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.886]  The 25% need to get serious promotions.
[00:15:44.606 --> 00:15:56.369]  I mean, this is just, these are the times that try men's souls, as one of our founding fathers, who was it, Hancock, said, or was it Paine, during the first few months of the Revolutionary War.
[00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:06.612]  Now again, in hindsight, it's easy to say the government's doing a horrible job, but I mean, they have to work to do this bad of a job.
[00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:16.364]  I mean, the French have jets, passenger jets, military transport jets, day one saying, you're going to need water.
[00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:19.827]  We will fly you tens of thousands of water filters.
[00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.849]  And our government is, no, we don't want them.
[00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:25.591]  Water filters that make the water totally safe to drink.
[00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:29.193]  And so the people get no water for the first three days.
[00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:29.894]  Literally.
[00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:40.433]  And imagine the British trying to help, and all these other countries trying to help, and Bush says... And Chertoff was on Larry King Live and several other shows last night, and he had the same script.
[00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.134]  I watched a bunch of TV last night.
[00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:43.675]  I watched like three hours of TV.
[00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:48.617]  I haven't watched three hours of TV in the last three months, but uh... I watched three hours of TV last night.
[00:16:49.657 --> 00:16:53.499]  They would say, well, you're not letting local states and other governments help.
[00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:53.999]  Why?
[00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.680]  Well, that's not true.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.660]  We're letting them help.
[00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:01.822]  But once we get set up and have an orderly, uh...
[00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:04.642]  Orderly way to deliver the help.
[00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.222]  There is no orderly way.
[00:17:07.363 --> 00:17:11.944]  You've got to get anybody in there that wants to help those people to get them out.
[00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:20.226]  Instead of coming in and dropping big containers of bottled water, you should be dropping water filters on these people.
[00:17:21.247 --> 00:17:22.987]  I mean, they're cheap, inexpensive.
[00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:24.448]  Folks, we sell them.
[00:17:24.508 --> 00:17:30.369]  I mean, little sports bottles that will take the most dirty swamp water there is and make it totally safe to drink.
[00:17:33.027 --> 00:17:35.348]  That's basically all the French were trying to do.
[00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:50.234]  Tens of thousands of those small filters, thousands of larger filters, and several very expensive airborne facilities that they were going to fly in and roll off the backs of their transport planes to be delivered to them.
[00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:57.136]  So, it's just unbelievable.
[00:17:57.216 --> 00:17:58.697]  And now the city is on fire.
[00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:05.831]  Now there are fires in multiple areas of the city, not being fought, spreading prodigiously.
[00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:10.273]  Let's go to Charles, who's been giving us updates from Louisiana.
[00:18:10.753 --> 00:18:15.636]  Charles, you said yesterday morning that it was ten times worse than we were hearing in the press.
[00:18:16.076 --> 00:18:20.039]  Now, within hours, it got ten times worse in the reporting.
[00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:23.961]  Is it still ten times worse than we're hearing, Charles?
[00:18:23.981 --> 00:18:28.984]  Okay, I'm going to give you this website with the mayor of New Orleans is saying.
[00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:32.446]  It's W-B-R-Z, Channel 2, Baton Rouge.
[00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:35.028]  He said he's using strong language.
[00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:36.369]  You know, I know.
[00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:37.430]  We actually have the clips.
[00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.311]  He's using them profoundly.
[00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:39.292]  Well, I didn't know that.
[00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:42.054]  But anyway, how come they're not dropping water?
[00:18:42.074 --> 00:18:42.875]  We got water here.
[00:18:42.895 --> 00:18:45.057]  When they bring the boats, they could bring water with them.
[00:18:45.397 --> 00:18:46.878]  How come they're not dropping the water?
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.361]  You know what I'm talking about?
[00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:50.782]  It's just like they want a disaster.
[00:18:51.002 --> 00:18:53.464]  The levee, they said they were trying to fix.
[00:18:53.484 --> 00:18:55.426]  The mayor said it wasn't touched.
[00:18:55.905 --> 00:18:57.988]  They lied about trying to fix that levy.
[00:18:58.148 --> 00:19:00.130]  He said that his words to Mayor New Orleans.
[00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:00.791]  No, I know.
[00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:05.337]  The mayor just says it's absolutely disgusting what the feds have done.
[00:19:05.698 --> 00:19:07.260]  We brought water down there.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.863]  I asked the policeman, I said, how come you're not dropping the water?
[00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:11.459]  Well, we've got to have oil.
[00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:12.659]  I said, Wendy, people are thirsty.
[00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:13.560]  These kids are dying.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.341]  I said, man, you've got to have oil.
[00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.182]  You should just take it on yourself, man.
[00:19:18.622 --> 00:19:19.523]  I just don't understand.
[00:19:19.543 --> 00:19:20.964]  Well, now the new numbers are out.
[00:19:21.024 --> 00:19:22.885]  Dozens of dead in the Superdome.
[00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:24.245]  Dozens raped.
[00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:25.926]  People passing out.
[00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:28.928]  I mean, people are dying while the news cameras are there.
[00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:30.129]  Let me explain this to you.
[00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.949]  I'm going to try to be calm.
[00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.110]  They said they're shooting at the helicopters.
[00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.511]  I found out they're not shooting at the helicopters.
[00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:38.153]  They're shooting in the air, letting the helicopters know what he had.
[00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:39.474]  You understand?
[00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:40.915]  Well, that's the reports we got, yeah.
[00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:42.317]  They're not shooting at the helicopters.
[00:19:42.357 --> 00:19:45.340]  They shoot to get attention, and then the helicopters flee.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.085]  But the Blanco's ordered troops, combat troops, threaten the people on the television.
[00:19:50.365 --> 00:19:55.330]  Well, I did hear the mayor say, and others, that instead of helping people, the troops are like doing a show of force.
[00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:59.294]  Again, FEMA has trained to oppress us, not to help us.
[00:19:59.354 --> 00:19:59.735]  Stay there.
[00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:05.535]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:07.556]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:11.399]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:20:11.699 --> 00:20:17.564]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:23.649]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:20:23.969 --> 00:20:27.653]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:32.658]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:40.366]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic, you can experience Gano Café for yourself.

[00:21:02.293 --> 00:21:03.935]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:08.179]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:11.161]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:17.968]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:18.148 --> 00:21:21.151]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:23.753]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.873 --> 00:21:25.955]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic
[00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:26.996]  We're good to go!
[00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:53.514]  803-4438.
[00:21:53.574 --> 00:21:54.014]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:54.034 --> 00:21:56.355]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:21:56.395 --> 00:21:57.576]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:57.656 --> 00:21:58.036]  Inflation.
[00:21:58.136 --> 00:21:58.836]  One and the same.
[00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:07.980]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:23.256]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:23.696 --> 00:22:24.377]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:24.417 --> 00:22:25.739]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:32.870]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.792]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.893 --> 00:22:41.576]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:42.316 --> 00:22:46.920]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.782]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.764]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.864 --> 00:22:53.064]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:03.273 --> 00:23:05.714]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:23:05.954 --> 00:23:08.755]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:13.097]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:22.642]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:27.867]  Because Zango is made from the whole Mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[00:23:28.147 --> 00:23:32.071]  Loaded with Xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:40.118]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:46.364]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:13.605]  We've got the clip of the mayor.
[00:24:13.766 --> 00:24:20.950]  There's actually several of them on talk radio and on TV talking about the response.
[00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:29.076]  Go ahead folks, give up all your liberty, give up your children's birthright, the name of security, and you're going to get the exact opposite.
[00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:33.659]  Quite frankly, if you want to take care of yourself and your family, you have to do it.
[00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:37.862]  The federal government can't or won't.
[00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:39.603]  Now throughout history,
[00:24:40.428 --> 00:24:43.430]  Back when we had a freer nation, we had the Swiss system.
[00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:52.417]  Or more properly, the Swiss have our system of the entire population being trained in disaster, being armed, being trained to be self-sufficient.
[00:24:53.078 --> 00:24:54.839]  And then you don't have these type of crises.
[00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:57.801]  Or if you do have a crisis, the people know how to deal with it.
[00:24:58.762 --> 00:25:09.470]  But you get a city that doesn't fix its levees, for whatever reason, and you get a city that has a large welfare population that doesn't have the money to evacuate the city,
[00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:17.373]  And you get a federal response like this on top of it, we've got a disaster that's only going to get worse.
[00:25:17.653 --> 00:25:21.795]  And by the way, the Astro Dome is already full.
[00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:27.758]  Austin, Texas, a mile from where I sit, already has tens of thousands of refugees.
[00:25:28.878 --> 00:25:33.100]  The economy of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region is decimated.
[00:25:33.846 --> 00:25:36.270]  Charles, in Louisiana, finish up what you were saying.
[00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:39.216]  Uh, DeBlanco's just talking about using force.
[00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:41.239]  He's sending, uh, combat troops there.
[00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:43.202]  He said they're carrying M-16s.
[00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:44.304]  They're locked and loaded.
[00:25:44.725 --> 00:25:46.168]  And they're more than willing to shoot.
[00:25:46.727 --> 00:26:04.380]  Yeah, and instead of going after the few looters and the few people, I've heard locals and news reporters on the ground saying that the troops are literally just doing a show of force, a lot of them, shoving the people around, which then only makes them angry.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.681]  So, it's always the same.
[00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.663]  Well, they're going to have troops here in Baton Rouge.
[00:26:10.164 --> 00:26:12.345]  I was told a couple of things this morning.
[00:26:12.365 --> 00:26:16.248]  They said, we don't want you going to air with this, but we're going to tell you and I'll tell you off the air if you want.
[00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:17.841]  But, uh, it's getting bad.
[00:26:17.881 --> 00:26:19.385]  The crime rate is bad down here.
[00:26:19.405 --> 00:26:20.588]  They're running up in the houses.
[00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:22.472]  Well, why can't we say it on air, Charles?
[00:26:22.492 --> 00:26:24.177]  Well, because I promised a guy, well...
[00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:28.652]  There's crime right here over the store.
[00:26:28.792 --> 00:26:30.933]  Listen, they've already said it on the National News.
[00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:32.393]  Anarchy is breaking out.
[00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:36.074]  The veneer of civilization is very, very thin.
[00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:45.898]  You may have total anarchy statewide and the officials may just cower in fear and it could spread.
[00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:47.418]  Is that basically what you were told?
[00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:51.819]  Well, there's children being raped in some of these facilities.
[00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:53.320]  There's already been a few rapes.
[00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:55.797]  In the facilities, they're bringing the people here.
[00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:00.081]  So there's already lawlessness in your facilities?
[00:27:00.101 --> 00:27:01.121]  Yes, but I'll say it.
[00:27:01.802 --> 00:27:04.624]  Seven-year-old girls raped and other things like this.
[00:27:04.644 --> 00:27:06.646]  They're going to put troops on the street here.
[00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:11.169]  And they said they were going to have 900 people here before the year's out.
[00:27:11.189 --> 00:27:11.389]  900,000 people.
[00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.292]  There's gas shortages, disease.
[00:27:14.312 --> 00:27:17.874]  They're getting prepared here for bad news.
[00:27:17.894 --> 00:27:19.836]  They ain't worried about New Orleans.
[00:27:19.876 --> 00:27:21.237]  They ain't worried about getting in the water.
[00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.372]  They're going to try to hold us down, but this is going to go down.
[00:27:24.892 --> 00:27:32.917]  So you're saying, talking to local police and others, that they're just bracing to deal with stopping total bedlam where you're at?
[00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:33.377]  Yes.
[00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:34.038]  Yes.
[00:27:34.118 --> 00:27:36.439]  Well, okay, we have news articles right here at the gas station.
[00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:37.840]  I've got a news article in my book.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.901]  They're pulling guns in the gas station getting gas.
[00:27:39.921 --> 00:27:41.082]  There's a gas shortage here.
[00:27:41.322 --> 00:27:43.984]  You can get shot getting gas right now as we speak.
[00:27:44.645 --> 00:27:49.009]  I mean, you said yesterday your wife was down at the store and somebody got their head blown off yesterday.
[00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:54.915]  Yeah, a woman was going on her way to Walmart and I called the cab and she started making abrupt as they shot her.
[00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:59.199]  All we have is all these gang member types that have stolen cars.
[00:27:59.239 --> 00:28:00.901]  Well, they're just roaming down here now.
[00:28:02.727 --> 00:28:05.391]  Well, no amount of National Guard will keep you safe.
[00:28:05.411 --> 00:28:16.446]  It's going to take the sheriffs calling out the good, respectable men of the community to form posses to go out and if these gang members shoot at you, kill them.
[00:28:16.686 --> 00:28:18.429]  Charles, it's going to take the police
[00:28:19.221 --> 00:28:28.188]  Going to the public and admitting that we've got the power, we've got the authority, only the people can stop your state from sliding into the Stone Age.
[00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:29.609]  I'd like to know one thing.
[00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:30.650]  We've got all this water here.
[00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.613]  How come they're not dropping it off and putting it on a boat and bringing it to the people as they need it?
[00:28:35.154 --> 00:28:36.114]  They donate water.
[00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:38.836]  I would like to know, and I know they're listening.
[00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.672]  Why ain't they putting that water on the boat?
[00:28:41.692 --> 00:28:44.254]  No, I've seen the warehouses piled with food and water.
[00:28:44.274 --> 00:28:44.994]  I asked him that.
[00:28:45.054 --> 00:28:47.997]  I told him, I said, man, this is a sin before God.
[00:28:48.297 --> 00:28:52.640]  I said, when we're all in hell, I said, I hope I'm the water boy, because I'm going to let you know how it feels.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.943]  I said, man, people are burning up the kids.
[00:28:56.003 --> 00:28:57.024]  Well, that's the question.
[00:28:57.144 --> 00:29:00.286]  Why aren't they, if it's all piled up, bringing it to the people?
[00:29:00.586 --> 00:29:01.747]  I don't know, Mr. Jones.
[00:29:02.108 --> 00:29:03.809]  I just don't understand it.
[00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:05.671]  They've got helicopters that go there every day.
[00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:14.661]  Four or five thousand of these little bottles of water just start dropping them out by the dome of the stadium, the people on the roofs, but they're shooting at the helicopters.
[00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:15.522]  It's all lies.
[00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:17.403]  They want to use force.
[00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:20.425]  The Blancos want to use force and combat troops.
[00:29:20.445 --> 00:29:24.708]  So you think they're on purpose letting this get out of control?
[00:29:24.748 --> 00:29:24.988]  Yes.
[00:29:25.188 --> 00:29:25.828]  Yes, I do.
[00:29:25.928 --> 00:29:26.389]  Yes, I do.
[00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:28.370]  They lied about the levee, trying to fix the levee.
[00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.771]  Why would they lie about that?
[00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:32.284]  Why would the mayor condemn them?
[00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:33.885]  Saying they need to do something.
[00:29:34.085 --> 00:29:35.725]  They don't have the support they're having.
[00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:38.407]  And they're saying 24 more hours, 2 more days.
[00:29:39.107 --> 00:29:39.947]  People can't last.
[00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:41.388]  It's already been 5 or 6 days.
[00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:43.429]  They got their water, they're passing down the street.
[00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:45.970]  Well, it's only 20,000 at the sports dump.
[00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.231]  I mean, 10 helicopters could bring them enough water.
[00:29:48.511 --> 00:29:49.812]  What about water filters?
[00:29:50.272 --> 00:29:51.012]  Thank you, Charles.
[00:29:52.133 --> 00:29:53.053]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.513 --> 00:29:55.134]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.035 --> 00:29:58.716]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:05.757]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:06.297]  are located?
[00:31:06.517 --> 00:31:09.901]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.122 --> 00:31:14.847]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:20.113]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.413 --> 00:31:20.734]  I think so.
[00:31:38.993 --> 00:31:39.493]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.012 --> 00:32:08.319]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.947]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:17.311]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:11.234]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.254 --> 00:33:24.117]  I have Eustace Mullins, who is literally one of the oldest surviving patriots in the country, been exposing the Federal Reserve for something like 70 years.
[00:33:24.137 --> 00:33:25.497]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:27.858]  I cancelled him today, he'll be on next Tuesday.
[00:33:27.878 --> 00:33:33.679]  I've cancelled other guests as well, just so we can talk about what's happening in New Orleans, because
[00:33:34.503 --> 00:33:38.445]  You know, Bush said on Tuesday, this isn't going to hurt the economy, it already has.
[00:33:40.326 --> 00:33:43.068]  And you can forget the economy, what about those people there?
[00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:55.054]  I mean, we have better responses to third world populations than we do to our own cities, because FEMA is designed to oppress populations and to control populations.
[00:33:55.634 --> 00:34:02.038]  All the money, there's been big articles written about it in the last five years, has gone into bullets, not needles.
[00:34:02.719 --> 00:34:05.740]  You know, bullets, not medicine, as the doctors have said.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:13.823]  And, uh, the troops that are there saving people, that are allowed to have that job, are doing a great job.
[00:34:13.863 --> 00:34:16.964]  But the majority just walk around with M16s.
[00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:20.225]  Meanwhile, the looters just stay out of their way.
[00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:22.306]  I mean, it's a huge city.
[00:34:22.366 --> 00:34:24.186]  Huge, sprawling city.
[00:34:24.887 --> 00:34:26.827]  And 50,000 troops can't control that city from looters.
[00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:28.708]  And, uh,
[00:34:31.075 --> 00:34:38.317]  You know, day one, if the police wouldn't have evacuated, 75% of them just quit and went home, I guess, to take care of their families.
[00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:50.581]  If they'd have stayed on the job, and if they would have shot looters up front, right when it started, then this wouldn't have happened.
[00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:53.242]  I mean, there's actually handbooks on how to handle this.
[00:34:53.943 --> 00:34:55.963]  There's 101 on how to deal with this.
[00:34:57.004 --> 00:34:58.384]  And it was not followed.
[00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:09.226]  And then now, understand, the federal government blocked, the federal government blocked fixing the dikes and levees and dams.
[00:35:10.887 --> 00:35:27.239]  When they knew that it was one of the main looming crises, that it was not a question of if but when, New Orleans would become the Greater Lake Entretrain, also known as New Atlantis.
[00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:29.815]  And I'm not being sarcastic, folks.
[00:35:31.036 --> 00:35:34.378]  And then on top of it, state and local governments wanted to help.
[00:35:34.818 --> 00:35:46.845]  There were go-getters that knew the topography, that knew the lay of the land, that wanted to get in there with food and water, and they were just told by FEMA, no, we're turning the boats around because somebody shot a gun.
[00:35:47.366 --> 00:35:48.166]  Well, so what?
[00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:51.268]  You send citizens in with guns to take out those people.
[00:35:51.877 --> 00:35:53.738]  That's what we've always done during crises.
[00:35:53.758 --> 00:36:05.504]  That's why Americans were always the best at handling crises, and Europeans weren't good at handling it, because they didn't trust their populations even 200 years ago, 300 years ago, to have guns and to be involved.
[00:36:06.104 --> 00:36:10.666]  Here, if we had a crisis, the sheriff said, come with me, and they did something about it.
[00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:14.188]  Instead, we got a bunch of feds micromanaging everything,
[00:36:16.002 --> 00:36:18.364]  And actually making the disaster much worse.
[00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:24.208]  We're going to go to Robert and Tim and Mike and Tim and many others here in a few minutes.
[00:36:25.188 --> 00:36:26.149]  Jim as well first.
[00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:26.870]  Here in just a second.
[00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.030]  But here is the Mayor.
[00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:38.878]  And here is the Mayor Ray Nagin there in New Orleans on WWL last night with some of his harshest words yet.
[00:36:38.978 --> 00:36:42.680]  And we have some of the mild profanities bleeped out.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.301]  But here it is.
[00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:49.169]  We authorized 8 billion dollars to go to Iraq.
[00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.011]  Lickety-squick!
[00:36:53.052 --> 00:36:57.716]  After 9-11, we gave the President unprecedented powers.
[00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:00.318]  Lickety-squick!
[00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.480]  To take care of New York and other places.
[00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:09.145]  Now you need to tell me that a place where most of your oil is coming through
[00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:16.057]  A place that is so unique, when you mention New Orleans anywhere around the world, everybody's eyes light up.
[00:37:17.038 --> 00:37:31.804]  You mean to tell me that a place where you probably have thousands of people that have died and thousands more that are dying every day, that we can't figure out a way to authorize the resources that we need?
[00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:32.704]  Come on, man.
[00:37:33.493 --> 00:37:35.315]  You know, I'm not one of those drug addicts.
[00:37:35.555 --> 00:37:36.916]  I am thinking very clearly.
[00:37:37.316 --> 00:37:38.938]  And I don't know whose problem it is.
[00:37:39.358 --> 00:37:41.099]  I don't know whether it's the governor's problem.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.161]  I don't know whether it's the president's problem.
[00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:49.767]  But somebody needs to get that a** on the plane and sit down, the two of them, and figure this out right now.
[00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:52.687]  I need reinforcements.
[00:37:52.887 --> 00:37:55.368]  I need troops, man.
[00:37:56.428 --> 00:37:57.889]  I need 500 buses, man.
[00:37:57.929 --> 00:38:07.372]  We were talking about, you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting, uh, uh, you know, public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here.
[00:38:07.453 --> 00:38:08.893]  I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:38:08.913 --> 00:38:10.474]  This is a national disaster.
[00:38:10.854 --> 00:38:16.336]  Get every dog-gone-greyhound bus line in the country and get that s*** moving to New Orleans.
[00:38:17.236 --> 00:38:22.040]  That's a big and small, man, and this is a major, major, major deal.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.762]  I've talked directly with the President.
[00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:26.464]  I've talked to the head of the Homeland Security.
[00:38:26.564 --> 00:38:28.486]  I've talked to everybody under the sun.
[00:38:28.526 --> 00:38:29.747]  I've been out there, man.
[00:38:29.767 --> 00:38:36.272]  I flew these helicopters, been in the crowds, talking to people, crying, don't know where their relatives are.
[00:38:36.713 --> 00:38:41.737]  I've done it all, man, and I tell you, man, Garland, I keep hearing that it's coming.
[00:38:42.506 --> 00:38:48.289]  This is coming, that is coming, and my answer to that today is, BS, where is the beef?
[00:38:49.850 --> 00:39:07.680]  Well, there you go, and so they got plenty of troops to run checkpoints and have drills in Virginia, where they call the citizens rebels and practice taking our guns, and they got plenty of money to build a three plus billion dollar fence in Afghanistan, a two billion dollar fence in Iraq,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.383]  But they can't control our border, which is just as big a disaster, just in slow motion.
[00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:18.707]  And they can't get helicopters, they can't get food, they can't get water to New Orleans.
[00:39:18.887 --> 00:39:20.848]  And now going into, what, day six?
[00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.871]  This all started Sunday night.
[00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:27.852]  So, going into day six tomorrow.
[00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:31.415]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:39:32.696 --> 00:39:36.418]  And it shows the government is not going to keep you safe.
[00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:45.612]  Only local, informed, armed, trained citizens can give you civil defense.
[00:39:46.753 --> 00:39:47.133]  I.e.
[00:39:47.173 --> 00:39:49.275]  that evil byword, militia.
[00:39:50.697 --> 00:39:52.519]  And I've harped on this for year after year.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.622]  Over and over again, I've said, own firearms.
[00:39:56.223 --> 00:39:58.565]  Be proficient with firearms.
[00:39:58.645 --> 00:40:00.047]  Firearms make you safer.
[00:40:01.522 --> 00:40:03.583]  We have a very thin veneer of society.
[00:40:03.804 --> 00:40:04.584]  Own some gold.
[00:40:04.844 --> 00:40:06.485]  Own quality water filters.
[00:40:06.846 --> 00:40:08.307]  Have a year's supply of food.
[00:40:08.347 --> 00:40:12.830]  I mean, I've got a two-year supply of food, and it's not because I'm some crazy person.
[00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:14.351]  I love my family.
[00:40:16.532 --> 00:40:23.136]  I'm not about to put my family's welfare in the hands of these out-of-control bureaucrats.
[00:40:23.216 --> 00:40:27.399]  I mean, God bless Greyhound for donating some buses.
[00:40:27.439 --> 00:40:28.520]  Where are the other bus lines?
[00:40:29.232 --> 00:40:33.615]  They've been begging Carnival Cruise Lines that docks four ships in New Orleans.
[00:40:33.695 --> 00:40:36.837]  Four ships that will hold about 4,000 people apiece.
[00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:39.219]  3,000 people apiece or more.
[00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:43.641]  They've been begging them for days to let them use the ships and Carnival still hasn't made the deal.
[00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:46.043]  Because they, again, only care about money.
[00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:49.365]  It's just an absolute greediness.
[00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:50.846]  And you know what?
[00:40:50.986 --> 00:40:52.767]  I don't want to hear that Walmart gave $15 million.
[00:40:52.787 --> 00:40:53.908]  They make like, what is it, $100 billion a year?
[00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.911]  Ooh, Walmart gave $15 million.
[00:40:58.951 --> 00:41:00.692]  That's like chicken feed.
[00:41:01.993 --> 00:41:04.475]  And I'm not criticizing Walmart for giving money.
[00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.096]  I mean, I've already given money.
[00:41:06.616 --> 00:41:07.616]  I've already given food.
[00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:11.079]  My wife's already, you know, given them half our clothes.
[00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:18.343]  And we tried to drive down clothes yesterday to the Burger Center or the Bergen Center, whatever it's called.
[00:41:18.523 --> 00:41:19.644]  It's like a mile from here.
[00:41:20.424 --> 00:41:21.965]  And there are refugees there.
[00:41:22.045 --> 00:41:24.627]  And they were like, well, just give it to us and we're going to sell it.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:35.108]  You know, we had to try to get through the Red Cross, but we'd rather money, or get through the, what's it called?
[00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:35.809]  Goodwill.
[00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:41.493]  Oh well, we're going to sell these clothes, or we'll give them vouchers, but they've got to come here and get them.
[00:41:44.116 --> 00:41:46.037]  That's why I said just give them food, folks.
[00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:49.300]  The Austin Food Bank, and I can just talk about what I know.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:55.544]  The Austin Food Bank here locally is loading trucks and already sending trucks two days ago there.
[00:41:55.885 --> 00:42:02.350]  But again, the trucks just pile up, there are now piles of food and piles of water and no one is allowed to get it into them.
[00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:08.355]  And then people come in with buses, citizens come in with private buses they own or they lease.
[00:42:09.473 --> 00:42:17.719]  And they're being commandeered by the military, who then just stack the buses up at some famous staging area because we've got to have trained bus drivers.
[00:42:17.979 --> 00:42:23.503]  That's what the mayor was alluding to, about we've got to get trained bus drivers in here.
[00:42:24.904 --> 00:42:36.432]  And I've got a piece out of Houston where they're talking about arresting a young black man who got a, in the middle of this disaster, who got a school bus.
[00:42:38.445 --> 00:42:41.887]  And loaded it up full of men, women, and children, and eight-day-old babies.
[00:42:42.607 --> 00:42:47.010]  And drove that thing with no training, and they almost didn't let them into the Astrodome.
[00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.351]  They were the first bus to show up.
[00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:50.152]  They talked about arresting Emerson.
[00:42:50.172 --> 00:42:51.292]  Well, we'll decide later.
[00:42:52.753 --> 00:42:55.415]  And you know, there are looters, folks, but it's a handful of them.
[00:42:55.495 --> 00:43:05.801]  Most of those people you saw out there, the cops admit they have to supply themselves by going to Walmart, and going to Target, and going to Kroger's.
[00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.538]  Because there's no support!
[00:43:08.778 --> 00:43:11.099]  The police chief and everybody else just pulled out!
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.241]  About 25% of the police stayed.
[00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:17.102]  The rest just left, too.
[00:43:18.983 --> 00:43:26.006]  You know, when I was on vacation last week, I talked to a San Francisco cop, and he said, oh yeah, there's a terror attack, we've already all talked, we're just not going to go into work.
[00:43:26.726 --> 00:43:29.608]  Folks, the government isn't going to help you, it's never helped you.
[00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:32.049]  Alright, I'm ranting and raving, and I know we've got
[00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:33.951]  Loaded phone lines here.
[00:43:33.971 --> 00:43:35.672]  We're going to take your calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:47.863]  You know, I called Jim Shepard up this morning because for five years he has been our number one sponsor and I know he sent hundreds of filters free of charge to the troops in Iraq,
[00:43:48.556 --> 00:43:51.357]  Because Halliburton was bringing them tainted water via trucks.
[00:43:51.817 --> 00:43:53.558]  Why didn't Halliburton give them water filters?
[00:43:53.598 --> 00:44:02.962]  Because then they wouldn't make money hauling them the water each time, you know, at hazard fees of thousands and thousands of dollars per load of water.
[00:44:04.002 --> 00:44:07.684]  And so Jim, I mean, is just the best you can imagine.
[00:44:08.288 --> 00:44:16.430]  We have been on the phone for days, I've been on the phone with Debbie and others trying to figure out a way to get filters to them.
[00:44:16.811 --> 00:44:27.694]  We tried to donate a filter yesterday, I did, just locally, and when we learned they're just going to sell it, if we give it to one of these local aid agencies, I didn't give it.
[00:44:28.754 --> 00:44:30.534]  So we got Jim on, because on 9-11,
[00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:40.247]  We told people to send gas masks and breathing apparatus so the rescue workers wouldn't breathe asbestos.
[00:44:41.828 --> 00:44:46.210]  And we found a local church that was about two blocks away that would take them.
[00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:53.813]  Talking to the church, just our listeners, in a few days we plugged it and sent several hundred breathing apparatus.
[00:44:54.822 --> 00:44:59.005]  You know, for when you're painting your house or whatever, because the feds weren't supplying them.
[00:44:59.406 --> 00:45:07.932]  Because they were telling the firefighters, don't worry, there's no asbestos, because to give them breathing apparatus, they'd have to admit there was a problem, so just say there's not a problem.
[00:45:10.414 --> 00:45:15.357]  We don't know how to get filters there, but you should get yourself filters.
[00:45:16.618 --> 00:45:18.480]  And I know it's very frustrating to Jim.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.381]  Jim, has it been frustrating to you?
[00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:22.803]  I mean, as I imagined it would be,
[00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:28.673]  Whereas they could be rescuing people, instead they're having to haul tons of water to them in bottles?
[00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:31.195]  Instead of just giving them water filters?
[00:45:32.116 --> 00:45:38.121]  Well, I would say just watching the way that the situation is being handled, the answer to that question, Alex, is yes.
[00:45:38.781 --> 00:45:41.023]  With respect to the water situation.
[00:45:41.764 --> 00:45:49.370]  Now, what I have heard is that there's an estimated quarter of a million people that are trapped in New Orleans.
[00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.312]  A lot of these people, Alex, are in high-rise hotels.
[00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:55.710]  And, you know, they've just moved up.
[00:45:56.571 --> 00:45:58.132]  In these hotels, there's no water.
[00:45:58.252 --> 00:46:00.554]  There's no purified water of any kind.
[00:46:01.835 --> 00:46:07.659]  The doctors in the medical facilities, they can't even wash their hands, let alone washing their instruments.
[00:46:07.899 --> 00:46:08.959]  All of their water is polluted.
[00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:12.082]  And Jim, when I watch the news, they go, what can we do about this in the future?
[00:46:12.502 --> 00:46:14.083]  And they said, just fill bathtubs.
[00:46:14.203 --> 00:46:17.445]  Why don't they tell the people to get water filtration?
[00:46:17.485 --> 00:46:21.168]  The French offered a bunch of water filters and Bush said no.
[00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:24.169]  Well, it's a puzzler to me, Alex.
[00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:39.332]  You know, even when you hear the immediate talk and say, we've got to figure out how to get bottled water into these people, it's almost as if there is this mindset that the only way to solve for this problem is to bring in bottled water.
[00:46:39.912 --> 00:46:43.433]  None of it is self-sufficiency.
[00:46:43.553 --> 00:46:45.853]  The motto is, there's no self-sufficiency.
[00:46:46.093 --> 00:46:47.334]  Government's got to run your life.
[00:46:47.474 --> 00:46:49.274]  Now, let's just discuss this for a minute.
[00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:58.304]  You've got a quarter of a million that are trapped inside the swamp that used to be New Orleans, surrounded by polluted water.
[00:46:59.124 --> 00:47:12.009]  Now, to keep these people going so that they don't drink that water and come down with cholera, salmonella, or some other nasty disease, they're going to need a minimum of a gallon a day for each one of those people.
[00:47:12.169 --> 00:47:15.770]  That's 250,000 gallons or 2 million gallons of water
[00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:26.452]  A day that they're going to have to fly in with helicopters because they can't bring boats because the bridges are in the way and they can't drive the roads.
[00:47:26.512 --> 00:47:29.959]  The only way to get this water in there is to airlift it in.
[00:47:30.652 --> 00:47:34.775]  So we're talking about 2 million gallons a day and they don't have the assets?
[00:47:34.835 --> 00:47:36.616]  And this is where the listeners can help.
[00:47:37.076 --> 00:47:38.637]  This is where the listeners can help.
[00:47:38.677 --> 00:47:40.718]  We don't care what water filters you get.
[00:47:40.738 --> 00:47:43.700]  Just make sure that they're rated to be able to take swamp water.
[00:47:44.241 --> 00:47:45.641]  We don't care how it works.
[00:47:45.882 --> 00:47:48.303]  Everybody should call local talk stations.
[00:47:48.683 --> 00:47:49.984]  You should call the White House.
[00:47:50.004 --> 00:47:50.985]  You should call FEMA.
[00:47:51.585 --> 00:47:53.567]  And say, what is your problem?
[00:47:53.667 --> 00:47:59.333]  A few thousand water filters could fix the number one problem, water, instantly.
[00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:02.837]  People are dying for two days for lack of water.
[00:48:03.117 --> 00:48:03.838]  You heard the mayor.
[00:48:03.918 --> 00:48:05.319]  Thousands are dying a day.
[00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:07.641]  They're covering up the true numbers, folks.
[00:48:08.082 --> 00:48:12.006]  Thousands are dying a day from this, and the government is too
[00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:13.849]  Stupid!
[00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.170]  Or is it on?
[00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:16.890]  They can't be this dumb!
[00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:21.472]  Why did they refuse the French deliveries of filters?
[00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:25.633]  The French said, we'll fly military transports in and give your people filters.
[00:48:25.973 --> 00:48:26.814]  Problem solved.
[00:48:27.094 --> 00:48:30.215]  And Bush said, no, that'll be confusing.
[00:48:31.135 --> 00:48:36.617]  Now, Alex, let me just point out something that really makes you scratch your head.
[00:48:37.517 --> 00:48:42.039]  If we took 600 of our large systems into their... 600!
[00:48:43.208 --> 00:48:45.269]  That would weigh 5,000 pounds.
[00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:46.730]  Not 2 million per day.
[00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.611]  One-time drop-off.
[00:48:48.671 --> 00:48:51.792]  Put 600 of these systems around the city.
[00:48:51.832 --> 00:48:53.153]  Put them in these large hotels.
[00:48:53.213 --> 00:48:54.754]  Put one in a medical facility.
[00:48:55.385 --> 00:49:00.529]  They could drop these off, these 600, in probably 8 hours maximum.
[00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:01.409]  Oh literally!
[00:49:01.469 --> 00:49:06.393]  I mean, you could carry 600 filters in 10 or 15 helicopter flights.
[00:49:06.913 --> 00:49:07.173]  Right.
[00:49:07.574 --> 00:49:14.038]  And what this would do is get people purified water until they can get the assets in place to get those people out of there.
[00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:24.926]  But instead, the plan is to bring these people essentially 2 million bottles of water a day, and they can't get those in there, so they're doing nothing.
[00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:33.218]  Well, for those that don't know, purified water is safer than... I mean, even better than bottled water.
[00:49:33.238 --> 00:49:38.002]  And you can read Majors... Jim, I just... The government isn't this stupid, Jim.
[00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:38.883]  They've got to know.
[00:49:38.903 --> 00:49:40.204]  I mean, they refuse the French.
[00:49:40.505 --> 00:49:43.347]  It's not like somebody hasn't gone, hey, you need water purifiers.
[00:49:44.308 --> 00:49:49.453]  Well, what I understand is that, you know, years ago, people wrote down these protocols
[00:49:50.334 --> 00:49:52.556]  And the protocol specified bottled water.
[00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.937]  And it's like, OK, we can't think outside the box.
[00:49:54.957 --> 00:49:56.298]  You know, we've got to do bottled water.
[00:49:56.438 --> 00:49:58.140]  And no, we can't get the bottled water in.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.502]  But at least put it, you know, get those out.
[00:50:01.542 --> 00:50:03.664]  I know for a fact FEMA has water filters.
[00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:06.726]  And I know for a fact sporting goods stores all over the country do.
[00:50:07.146 --> 00:50:12.690]  And I know for a fact, Jim, I mean, you've got, I would guess, thousands of filters in your warehouse.
[00:50:13.591 --> 00:50:14.151]  Yes, we do.
[00:50:14.631 --> 00:50:18.254]  Jim, I know for days we've been talking about how you're willing to even give some of these to them.
[00:50:18.294 --> 00:50:19.635]  But there's no way to get them there.
[00:50:19.835 --> 00:50:29.385]  You can't get them in, because... Well, okay, if somebody can get a hold of FEMA, or a governor, or somebody, and is willing to... You know, luckily you've got these filters right here in Texas.
[00:50:29.806 --> 00:50:31.187]  We can get these over to them.
[00:50:31.227 --> 00:50:32.028]  I mean, how do we do that?
[00:50:32.909 --> 00:50:34.010]  I've tried to make phone calls.
[00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:34.811]  I know you have.
[00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:36.969]  Ah, it's incredible.
[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.411]  Folks, call your local governments.
[00:50:39.451 --> 00:50:40.651]  Tell them to call Jim Shepard.
[00:50:40.691 --> 00:50:42.312]  He's got the filters.
[00:50:42.332 --> 00:50:46.914]  1-800, or 1-888-803-4438.
[00:50:46.934 --> 00:50:49.375]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:50:50.376 --> 00:50:51.116]  Jim, stay there.
[00:50:51.136 --> 00:50:54.558]  We'll talk in a few more minutes on the other side, and we'll go to your calls.
[00:50:54.598 --> 00:50:57.879]  The city's got fires raging in several different areas, explosions.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.600]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.000]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.115 --> 00:51:05.977]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:51:13.162 --> 00:51:19.886]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.226 --> 00:51:22.208]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.408 --> 00:51:25.250]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:30.015]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.215 --> 00:51:34.619]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:42.085]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.345 --> 00:51:44.767]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:54.699 --> 00:52:58.922]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:00.483]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:03.465 --> 00:53:09.409]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.629 --> 00:53:11.891]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:18.815 --> 00:53:19.416]  I think so.
[00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:39.248]  I think so.
[00:54:19.482 --> 00:54:21.563]  It's time to get prepared.
[00:54:21.643 --> 00:54:26.985]  It's time to get water filters and to protect your family.
[00:54:27.025 --> 00:54:36.929]  I mean, if I lived in New Orleans and knew that it could flood at any moment, and Phenom was saying it was one of the main disasters just waiting to happen, I would have had water filters.
[00:54:38.661 --> 00:54:52.205]  It's time to give the Millennium a call and get water filters and Jim's going to offer a whole bunch of just incredible cut rate specials and you know what free two-day shipping and things like that for people in the area to get it.
[00:54:52.325 --> 00:55:01.688]  He has been in contact with FEMA offering them basically the filters at cost and they're saying oh that sounds great but we've got to pass it up the chain.
[00:55:02.446 --> 00:55:06.429]  I just learned that during the break, so it may be too late here pretty soon.
[00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:12.032]  Give New Millennium a call, and that's 888-803-4438.
[00:55:12.152 --> 00:55:13.413]  The phone's busy.
[00:55:13.774 --> 00:55:15.275]  Leave your name and number and they'll call you right back.
[00:55:17.087 --> 00:55:24.650]  803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com and order via their Safe, Secure Shopping Cart and those orders will go out right now.
[00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:28.772]  So Berkeywater.com or 888-803-4438.
[00:55:29.573 --> 00:55:31.393]  Jim, I mean it's really simple.
[00:55:31.473 --> 00:55:42.238]  If they just had tens of thousands of sports bottles, not to mention your big Berkey systems, the problem would be solved because they've got food, it's water they don't have.
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:43.700]  Yes.
[00:55:45.282 --> 00:55:47.863]  Let me just mention two things to you, Alex.
[00:55:48.224 --> 00:55:55.849]  The first thing is that I sent an email with my suggestion to a gentleman who is in touch with FEMA.
[00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:56.870]  He passed it on.
[00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.511]  I have not been directly in touch with them.
[00:55:59.712 --> 00:56:02.273]  I just know my email has been passed on to them.
[00:56:02.814 --> 00:56:10.859]  The second thing that I want to mention to the listeners is the objective is however we can get these in there, we've got to try to get them in there.
[00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:19.966]  We have special pricing for relief programs whereby the filters are used in an emergency.
[00:56:20.546 --> 00:56:26.190]  If there are any listeners out there that are part of a church group or an organization, please call us.
[00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:34.395]  We have special prices for situations where there are emergencies and we just try to get the filters in there.
[00:56:34.935 --> 00:56:36.416]  For folks that live in the area,
[00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:43.115]  I, you know, I was watching the Weather Channel and they said there's another one that's starting to start up.
[00:56:43.455 --> 00:56:46.696]  It'll be a week and a half before it will, we have to worry about it.
[00:56:46.716 --> 00:56:51.138]  Yeah, it's off the coast of America, but the point is... It's off the coast of Africa, yeah.
[00:56:51.198 --> 00:56:54.219]  Yeah, the point is, is once something like this happens, it's too late.
[00:56:54.259 --> 00:56:56.600]  We can't get stuff, you know, to the folks that need it.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.921]  It really has to be in place beforehand.
[00:56:59.521 --> 00:57:02.442]  So for folks who, who want to get one for themselves,
[00:57:03.064 --> 00:57:12.746]  Or, who want to get one and go down and try to be part of the relief effort, we will send it second day air, no additional charge.
[00:57:12.786 --> 00:57:14.987]  That's the Berkey Light at $199.
[00:57:15.507 --> 00:57:21.769]  And again, if you have a relief group that wants to order a quantity, we have special pricing for relief products.
[00:57:21.969 --> 00:57:24.249]  Okay, Jim, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:57:24.289 --> 00:57:26.530]  It was a good idea to have you on, and God bless.
[00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:27.550]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:28.790]  Take care.
[00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:30.511]  And look, it's simple, folks.
[00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.736]  We need to be prepared as a society.
[00:57:33.776 --> 00:57:35.296]  The government cannot take care of you.
[00:57:35.716 --> 00:57:37.536]  And I can think of no better example of this.
[00:57:37.656 --> 00:57:41.898]  I mean, instead of giving them water filters, which the French offered to fly in there.
[00:57:42.718 --> 00:57:46.799]  They offered to fly in big units that could do tens of thousands of gallons a day, mobile units.
[00:57:47.179 --> 00:57:50.000]  They offered to fly in tens of thousands of small water filters.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.840]  And the federal government said no.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.881]  I mean, I have the AP article right here in front of me.
[00:57:54.561 --> 00:57:56.041]  Other states offered to help.
[00:57:56.221 --> 00:57:59.422]  Other areas of Louisiana offered to help.
[00:58:00.962 --> 00:58:02.563]  And the federal government just said no.
[00:58:03.303 --> 00:58:13.286]  Then the mayor of Houston stepped up to the plate and he said, you know, we'll take people at the Astrodome.
[00:58:13.346 --> 00:58:13.846]  And they did.
[00:58:13.866 --> 00:58:18.608]  And that was more relief than the feds put together.
[00:58:19.428 --> 00:58:21.769]  Just one mayor doing something.
[00:58:22.927 --> 00:58:23.908]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:58:24.208 --> 00:58:34.315]  And I've thought about trying to go to New Orleans, but there's no way to get in there to help these people, because the feds will commandeer whatever you've got, and their idea of helping somebody is sticking a machine gun in their face.
[00:58:34.335 --> 00:58:39.759]  Alright, we'll come right back and go scrape your calls, Robert, Kim, Michael, Tim, Myron, everybody else.
[00:58:39.779 --> 00:58:40.739]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.183]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.139 --> 00:58:58.780]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.501]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.221 --> 00:59:02.322]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.983 --> 00:59:03.783]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.564 --> 00:59:05.445]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.125 --> 00:59:09.868]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.308 --> 00:59:14.392]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.883 --> 00:59:19.705]  We're going into its fifth day of being submerged.
[00:59:19.985 --> 00:59:24.548]  Anarchy is a little bedlam breaking out as society unravels.
[00:59:24.608 --> 00:59:25.728]  Explosions overnight.
[00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:30.451]  Fires in multiple areas of the city as high-rise buildings are burned.
[00:59:32.613 --> 00:59:37.576]  And surprisingly, the mainstream media is admitting that the federal government totally screwed all this up.
[00:59:37.956 --> 00:59:41.238]  Now I guess the answer is a bigger federal government, more loss of liberty.
[00:59:42.158 --> 00:59:44.079]  I mean, that's what they'll try to do out of all of this.
[00:59:44.099 --> 00:59:46.581]  But bottom line, the government cannot and will not protect you.
[00:59:47.222 --> 00:59:49.444]  You've got to protect yourselves and take care of yourselves.
[00:59:49.824 --> 00:59:53.327]  Let's go to Robert in Colorado, then Kim, Michael, John, Bill, and others.
[00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:54.268]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:59:54.948 --> 00:59:55.769]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[00:59:55.809 --> 00:59:56.570]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:57.350]  Thank you for calling.
[00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:57.971]  Great show once again.
[00:59:57.991 --> 00:59:58.951]  No problem.
[00:59:59.272 --> 01:00:00.273]  Just a quick something.
[01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:04.076]  I was on the internet this morning going over, I think it was MSN.com.
[01:00:05.196 --> 01:00:10.421]  There's the little article I read saying that the New Orleans City is basically decimated, unestablishable.
[01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.381]  Maybe, maybe not.
[01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:15.765]  But the article also talked about possibly moving the city or rebuilding it or something.
[01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:17.984]  I was wondering what your take on that is.
[01:00:18.284 --> 01:00:42.482]  Well, the Speaker of the House, Dennis CFR Hastert, said yesterday, don't rebuild it, and I think that's stupid, but if they do rebuild it, which I think they will to a certain degree, they need to first build a proper wall around the city, which the experts have been saying for decades they've absolutely got to have, at least repair the old areas.
[01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:46.336]  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:50.319]  If the levy had been in place properly, we could have avoided all this mayhem.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.581]  Okay, that makes sense.
[01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:53.422]  Thanks for the call.
[01:00:53.622 --> 01:00:55.443]  And look, I don't know why they didn't repair it.
[01:00:56.084 --> 01:00:59.206]  I mean, Bush doubled, on average, every other federal agency.
[01:00:59.226 --> 01:00:59.927]  It was a doubling.
[01:01:00.687 --> 01:01:02.649]  Why slash the funding for that?
[01:01:02.729 --> 01:01:09.214]  And then again, tell foreign governments, our own government, state governments, you can't help them.
[01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:11.416]  FEMA is going to command you.
[01:01:11.496 --> 01:01:12.977]  FEMA is going to control this.
[01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:18.855]  I mean, folks, it's not hard to bring food and water to 20,000 people that are in that Superdome.
[01:01:19.395 --> 01:01:20.396]  That is not hard to do.
[01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:22.156]  They got the food, they got the water.
[01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.117]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:27.178]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in West Virginia.
[01:01:27.198 --> 01:01:28.099]  Thanks for holding, Kim.
[01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:29.639]  Thank you.
[01:01:29.659 --> 01:01:33.161]  Hey, Alex, it's nice to talk to you.
[01:01:33.941 --> 01:01:43.425]  I called this morning about something completely different from what you're talking about, that as I saw the paper today that WVU in West Virginia and about 17 other colleges
[01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:44.920]  I don't think so.
[01:01:53.467 --> 01:02:09.630]  Have a lot of people with names that are donating all houses and also rooms for anybody that... Now again, the American Red Cross will take citizens who will donate and let them do it, when the American Red Cross has tens of billions in its slush fund and can take care of all these people.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:13.231]  Again, there's another example of what the American Red Cross is up to.
[01:02:13.871 --> 01:02:14.411]  Exactly.
[01:02:14.471 --> 01:02:17.732]  They're asking for the people not to send food or clothing.
[01:02:17.772 --> 01:02:18.992]  They want money, of course.
[01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:23.613]  And for those that don't know, we posted an article where they've been caught actually stealing.
[01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:25.874]  I don't mean not giving money to people.
[01:02:25.954 --> 01:02:29.035]  I mean, they will rob the mail, folks.
[01:02:29.816 --> 01:02:35.619]  Meanwhile, the Red Cross, the American Red Cross, does some good, but that's done by the grassroots people.
[01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:36.939]  Exactly.
[01:02:37.339 --> 01:02:40.601]  I was wondering if you knew anything about the Amberview Project?
[01:02:41.765 --> 01:02:54.788]  In West Virginia, the West Virginia High Technology Consortium has started taking 3D pictures of our children in schools, and now they know how to morph it with just a two-dimensional picture.
[01:02:54.868 --> 01:02:58.129]  Yeah, they've got all sorts of programs to get us all on their databases.
[01:02:58.449 --> 01:02:58.789]  Right.
[01:02:59.449 --> 01:03:00.149]  I wasn't sure.
[01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:06.791]  I've only been listening to you for about two months, and I have been trying to spread the word and show all your movies, and I thought,
[01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:19.211]  Uh, pamphlets that I'm putting out on papers, flyers, with all these, uh, websites where they can go to, saying 9-1-1, is it an inside job, a question, and then have you check it out for yourself.
[01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:20.732]  So I've got to get the word around.
[01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:23.813]  My mom was a devout Republican.
[01:03:23.873 --> 01:03:27.755]  After she saw these movies, she is just totally in despair.
[01:03:27.795 --> 01:03:30.216]  And my dad, a Democrat, and he won't even listen to it.
[01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:31.176]  He just denies it all.
[01:03:31.756 --> 01:03:34.237]  So the Democrat, oh no, Bush wouldn't do that.
[01:03:35.993 --> 01:03:37.594]  Well, good job waking your mom up.
[01:03:37.654 --> 01:03:39.276]  At least she knows the truth, and God bless you.
[01:03:39.296 --> 01:03:39.916]  Yes, you too.
[01:03:39.956 --> 01:03:40.377]  Thank you.
[01:03:40.697 --> 01:03:41.478]  Take care, Kim.
[01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:53.047]  Michael and John and Bill and others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231, as we continue to cover the breakdown of society in the Gulf Coast area.
[01:03:53.908 --> 01:03:58.252]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:02.776]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:07.363]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.403 --> 01:04:10.204]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:04:10.545 --> 01:04:14.767]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:21.752]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:23.893]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:24.133 --> 01:04:34.700]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.263]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:03.836]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.257 --> 01:05:05.098]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.399 --> 01:05:09.985]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.465 --> 01:05:12.586]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:05:54.805 --> 01:06:00.133]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:00.453 --> 01:06:05.740]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:09.125]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:06:53.404 --> 01:06:58.464]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.845 --> 01:07:01.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:14.765]  Continuing coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as gas prices explode across the United States.
[01:07:17.286 --> 01:07:30.531]  You know, I saw George Bush a few hours ago there in a hangar about to tour New Orleans and the people clapping for him and talking about how he's looking forward to seeing the devastation.
[01:07:30.571 --> 01:07:31.692]  It's hard to look at and
[01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:41.320]  How it's basically like an incredibly powerful weapon was dropped on the Gulf Coast area.
[01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:50.365]  And then I just think about how a example, a microcosm, a thumbnail of all of this
[01:07:52.609 --> 01:08:04.739]  Is the fact that you've got FEMA just basically shouting orders at each other, but not letting anyone operate, anyone do anything, unless the most minute detail is checked off by the FEMA control freaks.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:19.771]  Meanwhile, the mayor of Houston says, hey, we'll take people in, and now the Astro Dome is already full, but more help has been delivered there than I would say in the entire scope of everything else.
[01:08:21.678 --> 01:08:38.562]  But even there, things are so rigid that a young black man driving a school bus full of refugees, a school bus that was just going to sit there and rot in downtown New Orleans, he gets out hundreds of people and the police sit around for over an hour deciding on whether they should arrest him or not.
[01:08:39.702 --> 01:08:40.982]  And making the people wait.
[01:08:41.802 --> 01:08:44.223]  And that was the first bus to get to the Astro Dome.
[01:08:47.532 --> 01:08:49.073]  I mean, that's insane, folks.
[01:08:50.974 --> 01:08:55.958]  Americans didn't operate like that 20 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago.
[01:08:56.498 --> 01:08:58.820]  Go-getters took action individually.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.063]  But now we're so bureaucratic, we've been trained to only follow orders.
[01:09:05.044 --> 01:09:06.705]  Only do what is correct.
[01:09:07.986 --> 01:09:11.048]  And it's just part of the systemic mind control.
[01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.930]  Let's go to Mike in New York.
[01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:15.611]  You're on the air.
[01:09:15.671 --> 01:09:16.071]  Go ahead.
[01:09:16.713 --> 01:09:18.454]  Hey Alex, nice to talk to you again.
[01:09:19.635 --> 01:09:29.841]  Alex, what's very outrageous, first of all, is the fact that the governor of Louisiana is not abiding under his constitutional oath and bringing in his National Guard, at least whatever's available.
[01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:32.302]  Of course, most of those guys are probably in Iraq.
[01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:39.667]  But keeping the federal government at bay and allowing local and county and state officials
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.922]  Take the reins of the situation so that, of course, the federal government cannot be so manipulative as they've been.
[01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:48.643]  Well, it was all about a turf war.
[01:09:48.683 --> 01:10:02.027]  Day one, she groveled and prostrated herself before the feds, and the feds have basically spent all their time, and folks, this is, and now admit it, we were reporting this two days ago and got some heat for it, but I mean, now it is mainstream news.
[01:10:02.547 --> 01:10:04.208]  We were just going off the local reports.
[01:10:04.888 --> 01:10:10.212]  But now it's mainstream news that the troops have been ordered to commandeer to stop other rescue groups.
[01:10:10.772 --> 01:10:18.197]  Basically it's all been about control and most the troops strutting around basically trying to intimidate the people that aren't rioting.
[01:10:19.217 --> 01:10:23.280]  Yes Alex, and all the more reason why the people have to be outraged.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.464]  It's time to, this is a prime situation for us to take everything you've been teaching for
[01:10:30.086 --> 01:10:33.827]  Forever on the New World Order agenda, what they plan on doing to us.
[01:10:33.847 --> 01:10:36.907]  This is a prime situation for the people to finally wake up.
[01:10:36.947 --> 01:10:40.868]  Well, I've been trying to not, I agree with you, I've been trying to not blame the government.
[01:10:41.268 --> 01:10:46.249]  Day one, I said, well, Bush didn't fix the levees, but is it really the Fed's job?
[01:10:46.269 --> 01:10:52.971]  I mean, I'm always ready to jump on the government, but I mean, it's just hard to believe that on purpose
[01:10:53.763 --> 01:10:55.324]  They would do something this bad.
[01:10:55.865 --> 01:11:09.376]  But now I'm starting to realize that the Globalist may flush Bush now and give him the blame, but out of this give us a National Service Bill for quote, you know, crises.
[01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:14.320]  That's actually what is in the legislation for the Universal Service Act.
[01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:24.203]  In there it says for national emergencies and disasters, so I think out of this we're going to see an even greater expansion of FEMA and Homeland Security.
[01:11:24.463 --> 01:11:32.534]  I mean, what is that skeletor-looking, palpably evil individual, not just in his actions, but even his look?
[01:11:33.246 --> 01:11:38.968]  You know, Chertoff going around making excuses and smirking about all of this.
[01:11:39.008 --> 01:11:39.908]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[01:11:40.168 --> 01:11:44.190]  And he's an Israeli citizen, right Alex?
[01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:45.730]  Yeah, yes he is.
[01:11:45.831 --> 01:11:47.831]  That's incredibly outrageous right there.
[01:11:48.111 --> 01:11:49.392]  But Alex, you're probably right.
[01:11:49.412 --> 01:11:55.354]  They're going to manipulate the situation to advance their plans further from this, but at the same time,
[01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:58.676]  The people of this country better wake up and take this opportunity.
[01:11:58.716 --> 01:12:00.317]  Get the states back under control.
[01:12:00.857 --> 01:12:03.859]  Make them stop sending tax money to the federal government.
[01:12:03.879 --> 01:12:07.341]  Keep the tax money at home for their own investment and their own infrastructure.
[01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:10.323]  They obviously know the federal government is not reliable for that.
[01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:10.963]  Exactly.
[01:12:11.003 --> 01:12:11.744]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:11.804 --> 01:12:12.784]  I appreciate it, Michael.
[01:12:13.305 --> 01:12:16.947]  Look, again, three nights ago I saw Chris Matthews.
[01:12:18.007 --> 01:12:18.768]  I got it on tape.
[01:12:18.828 --> 01:12:20.469]  I was recording it.
[01:12:21.793 --> 01:12:26.895]  And he was going, you know, people complain about states' rights and the feds, but look at the great job they're doing.
[01:12:26.915 --> 01:12:28.135]  Look at how they're coming in.
[01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:33.317]  Man, only they've got this type of muscle and this type of power, and they got the money.
[01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:38.839]  On average, if the feds tax a dollar, 30 cents of it comes back to the state.
[01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:50.083]  With strings attached, over 70% of state money that is taxed locally comes back in service, as if you really want most of those services.
[01:12:51.636 --> 01:12:59.261]  It really is the governor's job, and a couple hundred million dollars, folks, I mean, high schools cost fifteen million bucks apiece.
[01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:10.089]  There is no reason that they didn't have a Masada-like wall around that city.
[01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:12.770]  And they knew what was going to happen.
[01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:19.515]  So, you know, this groveling and begging to the feds, I mean,
[01:13:20.348 --> 01:13:37.994]  The state should have done it, but they were just so busy building casinos, so busy in... I mean, it's easy to sit here and say, oh, look, the government's screwing up, but I mean, they're screwing up so badly that maybe the listeners are right.
[01:13:38.034 --> 01:13:41.115]  I mean, maybe, maybe it is an inside job.
[01:13:41.175 --> 01:13:43.276]  I mean, maybe, maybe they let this happen.
[01:13:43.316 --> 01:13:46.197]  We know they let it happen, but maybe they want it to get really bad.
[01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:50.963]  I mean, how many days does it take to get aid in there?
[01:13:51.783 --> 01:14:00.609]  And to see the way the media is attacking Bush right now, I mean, they are savaging him, which I find very suspicious.
[01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:04.451]  Because, again, Bush is just a puppet.
[01:14:05.091 --> 01:14:10.635]  And are the globalists getting ready to kind of remove this piece of birdcage liner and put a new one in?
[01:14:11.556 --> 01:14:13.857]  See, the globalists never get the heat for their policies.
[01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.238]  It's always their puppets that do.
[01:14:16.427 --> 01:14:19.049]  Let's go ahead and go to John.
[01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:20.830]  John, where are you calling us from?
[01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:22.791]  I'm calling from Norfolk, Virginia.
[01:14:23.071 --> 01:14:23.411]  Welcome.
[01:14:23.431 --> 01:14:24.812]  How are you doing there, Alex?
[01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:26.352]  I'm doing all right.
[01:14:26.392 --> 01:14:26.933]  How are you doing?
[01:14:27.273 --> 01:14:28.173]  I'm doing great, man.
[01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:32.055]  Well, it's funny, on your show yesterday you were talking about weather control.
[01:14:32.075 --> 01:14:33.676]  You had that gentleman online with you.
[01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.691]  I actually saw, I've got a video from a guy named Robert Fletcher.
[01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:39.772]  Have you heard of Robert Fletcher?
[01:14:39.852 --> 01:14:40.152]  Yes.
[01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:55.777]  He actually showed documentation, showed a brochure to the United Nations that they passed on to fellow United Nations guys, that it's like the top 20 things that they're trying to do, and one of them is which they're wanting to control the weather and use it as a weapon.
[01:14:57.838 --> 01:14:58.938]  Well, I know this.
[01:15:00.179 --> 01:15:03.360]  Secretary of Defense Cohen, and we read the quote yesterday,
[01:15:04.577 --> 01:15:13.083]  Openly said that weather weapons are the weapons of the future and already existed then, and I know that they've introduced legislation to restrict these.
[01:15:13.863 --> 01:15:16.985]  I don't think this was a weather weapon.
[01:15:17.926 --> 01:15:18.846]  I don't think so either.
[01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:23.049]  It's just, you know, it's kind of something to look at, you know, to just see.
[01:15:23.069 --> 01:15:24.030]  I think it was more of a
[01:15:25.253 --> 01:15:31.434]  You know, it's more of them trying to grasp, practically, the theme and make it larger and show people what it can actually, what it's actually not.
[01:15:31.454 --> 01:15:35.475]  Well, they're certainly doing things deliberately that are causing the total breakdown.
[01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:36.555]  Totally.
[01:15:37.175 --> 01:15:38.616]  And thanks for the call.
[01:15:39.016 --> 01:15:43.597]  What we've got to look at right now, more than anything, is what else is going on?
[01:15:43.657 --> 01:15:48.118]  What else is the government trying to pass and do while we're busy looking at this?
[01:15:49.138 --> 01:15:50.438]  A lot of stuff's happening.
[01:15:52.772 --> 01:15:54.233]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill.
[01:15:54.253 --> 01:15:55.714]  Bill, where are you calling us from?
[01:15:56.174 --> 01:15:58.035]  I'm out here in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:58.316 --> 01:15:58.836]  All right, sir.
[01:15:58.876 --> 01:15:59.556]  What's on your mind?
[01:15:59.777 --> 01:16:08.042]  Well, you know, I listened to your last guest and I'm wondering, you know, they're sending these bottles of water into New Orleans.
[01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:09.863]  Who do you think bottled these waters?
[01:16:12.699 --> 01:16:14.200]  Well, there's a lot of different companies.
[01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:17.964]  A lot of the water's been donated, or it's water that FEMA's bought.
[01:16:18.384 --> 01:16:19.565]  I don't know the particular company.
[01:16:19.926 --> 01:16:38.423]  Well, I was strolling through the grocery store the other day here in Austin, actually at Randall's over there off of Lamar, real close to Lamar, and I was looking at the bottle of water, you know, because I try to get that distilled water, and I was looking at one of the waters, and it was made by a company called DS Waters of America,
[01:16:39.483 --> 01:16:41.444]  And I looked up, it was like for babies.
[01:16:41.604 --> 01:16:44.765]  It was... And so it said we add fluoride.
[01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:45.666]  Exactly.
[01:16:46.346 --> 01:16:47.466]  I mean, it's like... No, it's weird.
[01:16:47.846 --> 01:16:55.790]  Fluoride for babies, four to five, when they don't even have teeth yet, and that's when the sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride damages their brains the most.
[01:16:56.050 --> 01:17:00.831]  Well, what I'm thinking is, is maybe they're one of the companies who are actually donating these bottled waters.
[01:17:00.912 --> 01:17:04.333]  I mean, that could potentially be pretty dangerous to everybody else too, you know?
[01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:17.771]  Well, anyways, I have a toll-free number that was on the back of it, you know, and it's like, I figure if I give it out on the air, you know, and people call and say, hey man, take that sodium fluoride out of the water, though, it'll really give them some grief.
[01:17:18.731 --> 01:17:19.972]  But, uh, do you mind?
[01:17:20.772 --> 01:17:21.572]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:22.912]  It's, uh, E.S.
[01:17:23.032 --> 01:17:25.913]  Waters of America, it's, uh, number is 1-800-682-0246.
[01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:28.313]  Okay, Bill, thank you for the call.
[01:17:28.433 --> 01:17:28.773]  You know,
[01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:40.825]  The government openly passed a law to start psychological testing and drugging of our children.
[01:17:40.845 --> 01:17:42.146]  Now they're trying to implement it.
[01:17:43.346 --> 01:17:46.368]  That's real, that's bizarre, that's out of control.
[01:17:47.549 --> 01:17:48.389]  That's dangerous.
[01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:56.714]  You know, Tommy Thompson, former Secretary of the Federal Government, is traveling around
[01:17:57.643 --> 01:17:59.965]  Trying to get children to take implantable chips.
[01:18:00.205 --> 01:18:00.986]  That's bizarre.
[01:18:01.186 --> 01:18:01.867]  That's real.
[01:18:02.327 --> 01:18:03.228]  That's out of control.
[01:18:03.288 --> 01:18:11.775]  But so many times, people want to ignore all the real stuff that's going on and it's, well I saw a water company that puts fluoride in the water.
[01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:12.856]  Now obviously that's bad.
[01:18:13.877 --> 01:18:17.460]  But then maybe that's what they're shipping and that's why they want to hurt the people.
[01:18:19.382 --> 01:18:21.343]  See I mean that connection, there's no connection there.
[01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:22.064]  It's just
[01:18:24.036 --> 01:18:26.196]  Quite frankly, it gave me a really bad headache.
[01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:27.517]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:18:30.437 --> 01:18:35.838]  You know, I just hear how... I don't know how to explain it.
[01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:44.640]  We're always talking about stuff we can't prove, or that is ridiculous, or that is nebulous, instead of just all the real things we can prove.
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.241]  Like the French tried to ship in a bunch of water filters and Bush said, no!
[01:18:50.341 --> 01:18:50.941]  I'll be right back.

[01:23:07.313 --> 01:23:09.155]  And he has a pretty big internet business.
[01:23:09.195 --> 01:23:11.276]  Talks to a lot of different customers across the state.
[01:23:11.657 --> 01:23:13.278]  He's going to be calling in here in a few minutes.
[01:23:13.338 --> 01:23:16.380]  Right now, let's go to JW, who's in Louisiana.
[01:23:17.161 --> 01:23:19.663]  And JW gave us a great report yesterday.
[01:23:19.723 --> 01:23:21.304]  JW, what's going on today?
[01:23:21.645 --> 01:23:22.405]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:22.585 --> 01:23:24.187]  Brief update.
[01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:35.856]  Last night, WBRZ, a local ABC affiliate, announced that a doctor at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans could not contact anyone in the city of New Orleans.
[01:23:36.368 --> 01:23:46.479]  He contacted WBRZ in Baton Rouge and told them, begging for help, that they've had over a hundred patients die in the hospital.
[01:23:46.519 --> 01:23:48.221]  They are totally cut off.
[01:23:48.441 --> 01:23:48.762]  Nothing.
[01:23:48.902 --> 01:23:51.144]  And by the way, that is in my stack.
[01:23:51.224 --> 01:23:52.866]  That is in local newspapers.
[01:23:53.186 --> 01:23:54.588]  None of that is on the national news.
[01:23:54.628 --> 01:23:55.329]  You heard the mayor.
[01:23:55.849 --> 01:24:06.277]  Thousands dying a day, 250,000 people in the city, not 14,000 at the Dome, and the feds are covering up the magnitude of this.
[01:24:06.777 --> 01:24:10.900]  And I mean, I'm sorry folks, they can get troops into these hospitals.
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.842]  They can get troops in to drop generators on the roofs.
[01:24:14.202 --> 01:24:19.166]  They should be in there with their FEMA credit cards buying the generators from all the tractor shops.
[01:24:19.566 --> 01:24:21.247]  Dropping them on the roof with the fuel.
[01:24:21.468 --> 01:24:23.689]  They should be dropping water filters on the roofs.
[01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:26.031]  I mean, I've got to tell you, this is pathetic.
[01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:28.312]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[01:24:29.874 --> 01:24:30.454]  Stay there.
[01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:31.295]  Stay there.
[01:24:31.615 --> 01:24:33.216]  Because I want you guys to go back and forth.
[01:24:33.256 --> 01:24:34.037]  This is J.W.
[01:24:34.057 --> 01:24:34.797]  from Louisiana.
[01:24:35.037 --> 01:24:42.523]  Duane Coots, good friend of mine for many years, and he's the backbone of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, our IT specialists.
[01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:43.564]  Duane,
[01:24:44.821 --> 01:25:02.258]  What I'm getting from people in Louisiana is, it is descending into Bedlam, and the feds and the locals are just trying to hold down the other cities where the murder rate is exploding, carjackings, killings, gas shortages, that you guys are on the edge.
[01:25:02.438 --> 01:25:03.279]  Is that accurate?
[01:25:03.835 --> 01:25:04.916]  Yes, sir, that's accurate.
[01:25:04.956 --> 01:25:15.345]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media is playing it down as much as possible and trying to deliver the bright side of the news while seriously undercutting the delivery of information.
[01:25:16.226 --> 01:25:24.453]  And I really don't know what good it would have to have this information disseminated to the nation at large, except that the one glaring fact that it's the truth, Alex.
[01:25:25.677 --> 01:25:30.979]  You know, we're far away from the path of the hurricane over here, about 100 miles, 150 miles.
[01:25:31.079 --> 01:25:33.320]  And so people know how devastating this is.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.281]  I mean, I don't know if it's okay for me to mention what's happened to your business.
[01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:37.201]  Sure, man.
[01:25:37.321 --> 01:25:38.001]  Oh, of course.
[01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:38.602]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:48.425]  I mean, we never had a drop of rain or a cloud in the sky over here, and a third of my business is wiped out because our data lines are down for our wide area network subscribers.
[01:25:48.845 --> 01:25:53.247]  So, I mean, everyone went down in one fell swoop, and it could be between 30 days and 180 days.
[01:25:56.428 --> 01:25:59.009]  Because all the repair people are so busy in other areas.
[01:25:59.069 --> 01:26:08.273]  I mean, we need to call the troops back from Iraq, all 140,000, right now and get them in Louisiana or this could bring down our whole economy!
[01:26:09.048 --> 01:26:10.189]  Sure, sure.
[01:26:10.449 --> 01:26:13.892]  We're seeing even little local reports, and we're here in Hooterville, don't get me wrong.
[01:26:14.413 --> 01:26:18.956]  Our population in the town I'm in now, where my main office is, is only about 10,000.
[01:26:20.237 --> 01:26:37.572]  We've already taken in about 1,000 refugees, and we've had some reports here locally of people disembarking and causing trouble, so our local law enforcement is trying to put up with the own impact in our own small way, and I'm sure that's amplified 1,000 times in the larger cities.
[01:26:38.392 --> 01:26:39.873]  Well, we'll stay there, Dwayne.
[01:26:39.893 --> 01:26:40.934]  I'm going to hold you over the break.
[01:26:40.954 --> 01:26:42.195]  I know you're very, very busy.
[01:26:42.896 --> 01:26:45.237]  And just God bless you for just such a great guy.
[01:26:45.257 --> 01:26:46.999]  I'm so sad this is happening to you as well.
[01:26:47.899 --> 01:26:50.201]  J.W., comments on what Dwayne was saying?
[01:26:50.441 --> 01:26:58.287]  Well, I don't know what city he's in in Louisiana, but I can tell you Baton Rouge now has the distinction of being the largest city in Louisiana.
[01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:01.949]  Now, your population's already doubled in Baton Rouge, has it not?
[01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:05.372]  It probably, at this point in time, we're over-doubled it.
[01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:09.609]  We are, um, they're announcing that we are the largest city in the state.
[01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:15.552]  I don't like to say again, I don't know where Wayne's calling from, but this is, it is, it is chaos.
[01:27:15.952 --> 01:27:17.952]  We don't have the infrastructure to handle this.
[01:27:20.173 --> 01:27:20.834]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:20.954 --> 01:27:25.435]  And they closed the super, the, uh, not the Superdome, they closed the Astrodome in Houston.
[01:27:25.715 --> 01:27:26.856]  I heard that this morning.
[01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:27.256]  Correct.
[01:27:28.296 --> 01:27:32.818]  And that's already getting, meanwhile, they're, they've got police out.
[01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:37.663]  I mean, quite frankly, trying to stop people that are stealing clothes and stuff.
[01:27:37.983 --> 01:27:39.803]  I mean, if somebody's shooting at people, kill them.
[01:27:40.403 --> 01:27:43.724]  But we don't need police going after people that are looting t-shirts.
[01:27:44.144 --> 01:27:46.304]  We need police to get in there and rescue people.
[01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:47.244]  Your comments on that?
[01:27:48.505 --> 01:27:49.085]  Exactly.
[01:27:49.245 --> 01:27:59.567]  And I have, speaking of police, I have some additional information for you regarding an interview I saw last night on a correctional CBS affiliate, WAFB.
[01:28:00.327 --> 01:28:00.627]  Tell us.
[01:28:02.597 --> 01:28:04.398]  Lieutenant Waller, N.O.P.D.
[01:28:04.638 --> 01:28:07.119]  was there in New Orleans from start to finish.
[01:28:07.159 --> 01:28:08.499]  He told a horror story.
[01:28:08.539 --> 01:28:11.220]  He was interviewed locally by W.A.F.D.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.721]  He was in the studio here in Baton Rouge.
[01:28:14.402 --> 01:28:15.822]  It was a horror story, Alex.
[01:28:16.382 --> 01:28:22.785]  And I urge you, I implore you to have, I have the contact numbers for W.A.F.D.
[01:28:22.945 --> 01:28:24.766]  I implore you to have this gentleman on.
[01:28:24.786 --> 01:28:25.886]  Well, I tell you what, stay there.
[01:28:25.966 --> 01:28:27.627]  Tell us what he said when we get back, okay?
[01:28:28.539 --> 01:28:30.100]  That was what he said, J.W., when we get back.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.963]  We'll also get more from Dwayne Cooch, a personal friend of mine on the other side.
[01:28:34.983 --> 01:28:38.905]  I mean, this is one of the biggest disasters, if not the biggest, in U.S.
[01:28:38.945 --> 01:28:39.385]  history.
[01:28:40.086 --> 01:28:44.168]  And George Bush spent the first two days on vacation playing guitar.
[01:28:44.248 --> 01:28:45.169]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:47.270]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:50.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.418 --> 01:28:57.481]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:28:57.701 --> 01:28:59.503]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[01:28:59.703 --> 01:29:03.367]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:29:03.647 --> 01:29:09.512]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:29:09.632 --> 01:29:11.594]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:29:11.734 --> 01:29:15.538]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:19.602]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:29:19.783 --> 01:29:24.608]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:29:24.748 --> 01:29:29.774]  With several delicious varieties including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[01:29:29.934 --> 01:29:32.316]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[01:29:32.557 --> 01:29:35.440]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.924]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.

[01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:57.114]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.414 --> 01:30:02.358]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.599 --> 01:30:06.962]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.263 --> 01:30:16.171]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.391 --> 01:30:20.014]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.294 --> 01:30:25.320]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.601 --> 01:30:32.309]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.822 --> 01:30:33.483]  What about you?
[01:30:34.123 --> 01:30:39.487]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:55.914 --> 01:31:02.756]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:03.036 --> 01:31:05.397]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:05.657 --> 01:31:07.617]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:07.957 --> 01:31:13.319]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:13.699 --> 01:31:17.962]  The keychain attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:18.422 --> 01:31:26.327]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10 year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:26.507 --> 01:31:33.572]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:34.092 --> 01:31:36.614]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.343 --> 01:32:09.924]  Alright, we're talking to Dwayne Coutts, a friend of mine there in Louisiana.
[01:32:10.724 --> 01:32:13.845]  Also, we're talking to JW, who is in Baton Rouge.
[01:32:15.025 --> 01:32:17.346]  Very nice city, and now doubled in size.
[01:32:18.286 --> 01:32:21.727]  And it had some of its own, of course, damage from the hurricane.
[01:32:22.267 --> 01:32:33.130]  Dwayne, listening to JW talk about the city doubling in size and all over the state, there are gas lines and people carjacking and
[01:32:33.989 --> 01:32:38.010]  And basically roving bands that left New Orleans that have run out of money.
[01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:46.293]  And I guess instead of going to a local charity, they just decide to rob some poor, hapless individual.
[01:32:47.513 --> 01:32:49.113]  You're in a small town.
[01:32:49.714 --> 01:32:54.575]  You've heard about a few problems, but nothing that bad, Dwayne?
[01:32:55.943 --> 01:33:00.387]  Nothing directly where it got out of hand, where it couldn't be controlled by local law enforcement.
[01:33:02.169 --> 01:33:03.470]  Name your town for folks!
[01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:05.391]  Name your town!
[01:33:05.491 --> 01:33:07.533]  Well, my main office is in Jennings, Louisiana.
[01:33:07.593 --> 01:33:09.515]  It's right on I-10, on the I-10 Corridor.
[01:33:10.676 --> 01:33:18.142]  We have the distinction of being almost directly to the mile in between New Orleans and Houston.
[01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:20.930]  That's where our city sits.
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:23.411]  So, I mean, we're on the main exodus path.
[01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.374]  But you did hear from local police that there were some problems?
[01:33:26.954 --> 01:33:27.674]  Oh, sure, sure.
[01:33:27.694 --> 01:33:33.979]  I mean, we've got nothing that got out of hand where they couldn't handle it, but the local shelters, the people are really starting to get fed up.
[01:33:34.119 --> 01:33:35.680]  I mean, the patience is at an end.
[01:33:36.261 --> 01:33:41.785]  Well, I hope the refugees realize they can't go back to New Orleans, they're saying, for at least a year.
[01:33:42.205 --> 01:33:42.866]  Oh, no, right.
[01:33:42.906 --> 01:33:47.129]  We had a couple folks come in that were headed back to Kenner,
[01:33:47.969 --> 01:33:48.429]  Where is Tenor?
[01:34:06.061 --> 01:34:07.482]  Relationship to New Orleans?
[01:34:08.203 --> 01:34:12.688]  It's going to probably be about 40 miles before you even get to it.
[01:34:13.108 --> 01:34:16.812]  So people that are 40 miles away from New Orleans can't even stay at their house?
[01:34:17.432 --> 01:34:19.675]  Oh, oh gosh, no, no, no man.
[01:34:20.355 --> 01:34:25.701]  You know, and like towns that were not directly in the basin are also devastated too.
[01:34:25.981 --> 01:34:28.063]  How many millions of people are in Louisiana?
[01:34:29.077 --> 01:34:31.819]  So, I think about six and a half million total.
[01:34:31.839 --> 01:34:33.500]  Okay, six and a half million total.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.382]  How many of that six and a half million are right now?
[01:34:37.803 --> 01:34:39.784]  Metro New Orleans is 1.6 million.
[01:34:40.424 --> 01:34:42.866]  So that's all New Orleans and the surrounding areas.
[01:34:44.287 --> 01:34:45.147]  Okay, 1.6 million.
[01:34:45.227 --> 01:34:49.930]  I mean, how many other hundreds of thousands have you heard around the state are having problems?
[01:34:50.991 --> 01:34:56.274]  Probably close to three quarters of a million that were not in New Orleans are also homeless.
[01:34:56.886 --> 01:35:00.069]  So we're looking at 2 million homeless people?
[01:35:00.449 --> 01:35:14.020]  Oh sure, about 2 million that have to be absorbed in and probably half of those will be able to return to something like a home or at least to their hometown within the next six months.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.922]  And Louisiana is the poorest state in the Union?
[01:35:18.223 --> 01:35:19.584]  Oh, pretty close to it.
[01:35:19.624 --> 01:35:26.370]  I really wouldn't have pride in my voice to parrot that statistic, but I'm sure we're in the bottom five
[01:35:27.146 --> 01:35:28.767]  Well, I mean, don't feel bad.
[01:35:28.787 --> 01:35:29.368]  Sure, sure, man.
[01:35:29.408 --> 01:35:30.969]  Don't feel bad, Texas is too, so.
[01:35:31.469 --> 01:35:33.931]  Yeah, right, right, right.
[01:35:34.031 --> 01:35:36.112]  What's shocking to me is some of the stuff.
[01:35:36.172 --> 01:35:54.165]  The last time I was looking at a television screen this morning before I was talking to Paul Watson about some of the same stuff, a female bureaucrat, somebody from FEMA, or maybe it was a former FEMA talking head they had come in, the newscaster was asking them about
[01:35:55.118 --> 01:35:56.199]  You know, what are the priorities?
[01:35:56.239 --> 01:35:57.559]  What is the plan of action?
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:05.083]  And I was shocked to hear that the first priority... This is unofficial, of course, but this is coming from a talk in here, so I'm assuming they're in channel.
[01:36:05.923 --> 01:36:13.867]  The first priority is to get the levees fixed, and then to get the people evacuated, which is totally, totally, completely backwards.
[01:36:13.887 --> 01:36:16.709]  Well, the levees have already equalized.
[01:36:16.829 --> 01:36:17.369]  Equalized.
[01:36:17.449 --> 01:36:19.370]  I told you, didn't we talk about this Tuesday?
[01:36:19.670 --> 01:36:20.931]  And for those that don't know...
[01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:26.235]  For those that don't know, that means that fixing the levee means nothing because you're already underwater.
[01:36:26.355 --> 01:36:26.835]  Right, right.
[01:36:26.876 --> 01:36:29.838]  We talked about this Tuesday or Wednesday when we were on the show.
[01:36:30.719 --> 01:36:31.820]  They're going to equalize.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:32.840]  That's already given up.
[01:36:32.941 --> 01:36:33.701]  It's been surrendered.
[01:36:34.061 --> 01:36:40.106]  Anything anyone else said is silly because they knew it was a lost cause when the second levee came.
[01:36:40.146 --> 01:36:47.813]  Do you think Hastert, I mean he's being decried right now and I don't support his statement, but do you think Hastert was trying to be realistic when he said the city's gone?
[01:36:49.074 --> 01:36:49.494]  Of course.
[01:36:49.574 --> 01:36:50.435]  I said that Monday.
[01:36:51.147 --> 01:36:52.628]  And I said that on your show Wednesday.
[01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:59.113]  I mean, they may very well abandon that area and put a monument there and it's the modern-day Pompeii or Atlanta.
[01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:07.860]  Let me get a comment from JW, who's in Baton Rouge, now the biggest city in New Orleans, literally overnight.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:25.707]  Yesterday you talked about police that you were talking with personally saying that it is a powder keg and that now even national news is saying that Louisiana could descend into total anarchy but they're having trouble just controlling anarchy in the other cities themselves.
[01:37:27.248 --> 01:37:28.348]  Give us your thoughts on that.
[01:37:28.748 --> 01:37:35.291]  Well the local news media and of course our local politicians are downplaying the
[01:37:36.792 --> 01:37:40.755]  The activity around some of the shelters in downtown Baton Rouge.
[01:37:41.516 --> 01:37:58.109]  But in the same token, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office has called out and put in force their SWAT team to patrol the particular area around the Riverside Central Plex, where the majority of the refugees are being housed 24-7.
[01:37:58.169 --> 01:38:02.312]  So if everything is great, why are they activating
[01:38:02.935 --> 01:38:04.716]  The SWAT team to be on patrol 24-7.
[01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:12.021]  Well, I mean, what's a SWAT team of 10-15 people going to do when you've got tens of thousands of refugees?
[01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:15.583]  How many total do you have right now that are in Baton Rouge?
[01:38:15.983 --> 01:38:18.225]  Alex, they have not given an actual number.
[01:38:18.305 --> 01:38:21.126]  I don't think it's possible because they're not just here.
[01:38:21.206 --> 01:38:25.389]  They're spread out all over the city of Baton Rouge, all over the northern suburbs.
[01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:34.172]  To the east suburbs, to the west suburbs, everywhere there's a small town that's got a community center adjacent to Baton Rouge are taking home refugees.
[01:38:34.252 --> 01:38:36.953]  Now I believe it was you that complained about the churches.
[01:38:37.073 --> 01:38:38.414]  Are they stepping up to the plate?
[01:38:38.734 --> 01:38:40.574]  No sir, I didn't complain about the churches.
[01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.655]  That was another caller from Louisiana.
[01:38:43.355 --> 01:38:50.500]  To my knowledge, the churches have stepped up, especially out in the Denham Springs, which is truly an adjacent community.
[01:38:50.741 --> 01:38:53.563]  I heard Franklin Graham issuing a challenge last night.
[01:38:54.423 --> 01:39:01.669]  The churches here locally have stepped up, even some of the real smaller churches that probably don't have the true resources that the larger churches do.
[01:39:02.529 --> 01:39:03.470]  They have stepped up.
[01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:05.891]  What are the large churches doing?
[01:39:06.171 --> 01:39:09.513]  The larger churches in Baton Rouge are several.
[01:39:09.793 --> 01:39:16.536]  Honestly and truly, I don't know how a lot of these folks would have survived if the churches wouldn't have stepped up to the plate, Alex.
[01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:22.399]  They have one church in Baton Rouge that is turning out 16,000 hot meals a day.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:26.181]  It's a large church on Florida Boulevard in Baton Rouge.
[01:39:26.281 --> 01:39:29.083]  And I've been watching a lot of TV, reading all the news wires,
[01:39:31.013 --> 01:39:49.449]  There's just a few examples of FEMA giving people MREs and water, but it seems that the 160-something canteens, that's what the Salvation Army calls their mobile food trucks, and the churches are doing hundreds of times what FEMA's doing, and it seems that FEMA is getting in the way of all of this.
[01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:58.577]  I can't actually comment on that aspect of it because I'm not there first hand, but some rumors that I'm hearing, you're exactly correct.
[01:39:59.133 --> 01:40:04.375]  Well, I've seen FEMA on the news, admittedly, commandeering local buses and things.
[01:40:04.855 --> 01:40:11.578]  People are coming in, trying to do rescues, and FEMA's saying, no, no, no, it's not secured, somebody shot a gun.
[01:40:11.918 --> 01:40:19.301]  Well, that's what, you know, when things get bad, the government is supposed to get tough and, you know, go in and save those people.
[01:40:19.361 --> 01:40:23.883]  But, oh my gosh, somebody shot a gun, and so let's all cower in fear.
[01:40:23.903 --> 01:40:25.904]  Duane, do you have comments on that?
[01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:29.791]  Oh sure, it's the same thing we're hearing on this end.
[01:40:30.392 --> 01:40:37.875]  We're in Jennings, Louisiana, on the western end of the state and it's like, you know, everything we're getting, we're getting from the news media.
[01:40:38.715 --> 01:40:41.456]  Just like the interview I was describing,
[01:40:42.106 --> 01:40:42.567]  I don't
[01:41:01.966 --> 01:41:02.346]  Block.
[01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:06.087]  And then he was doing photo ops before he took his walking tour.
[01:41:06.107 --> 01:41:07.567]  I don't know where he got it.
[01:41:07.587 --> 01:41:08.268]  No, I saw it.
[01:41:08.468 --> 01:41:08.868]  I saw it.
[01:41:08.908 --> 01:41:13.509]  And even the CNN pundit said, what on earth is he doing?
[01:41:13.549 --> 01:41:15.509]  That's a disgusting photo op.
[01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:17.050]  I couldn't believe how honest they were.
[01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.370]  So crass and ridiculous.
[01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.811]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.971 --> 01:41:20.711]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:20.731 --> 01:41:23.692]  And he had like hundreds of people standing around him instead of rescuing.
[01:41:23.712 --> 01:41:27.853]  I mean, they need to be haul and tail, full tilt boogie, 110%.
[01:41:30.513 --> 01:41:30.954]  In there.
[01:41:31.714 --> 01:41:38.560]  And look, if they invited citizens in right now, I'd be on my way out there to try to help people.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.921]  Folks, but they won't let you in.
[01:41:40.241 --> 01:41:46.506]  JW, you said you saw a government official on TV from the local police department.
[01:41:46.526 --> 01:41:47.287]  Tell us what he said.
[01:41:47.887 --> 01:41:52.951]  Well, I was referring earlier to an NOPD, a Lieutenant Waller.
[01:41:53.512 --> 01:41:55.173]  That's what I was speaking of.
[01:41:55.854 --> 01:41:59.817]  They had an interview on the WAFB Channel 9, the CBS affiliate here.
[01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:01.271]  We're good to go.
[01:42:17.523 --> 01:42:18.784]  This guy is furious.
[01:42:19.204 --> 01:42:21.585]  Alex, I beg you to have this guy on your show.
[01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:23.947]  Well, tell us, I mean, in a nutshell, I'll try.
[01:42:23.987 --> 01:42:29.650]  I'm sure it'd be hard to get a hold of him, but Lieutenant Waller, now in Baton Rouge, formerly Lieutenant in the, uh, in Orange Police Department.
[01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:33.332]  But, I mean, tell us what he said in a nutshell, because we're not getting this on the national news.
[01:42:33.552 --> 01:42:33.892]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:33.952 --> 01:42:36.834]  He, he was told to report to work at six o'clock.
[01:42:36.874 --> 01:42:37.735]  I don't know if it was a.m.
[01:42:37.795 --> 01:42:38.155]  or p.m.
[01:42:38.175 --> 01:42:39.095]  He didn't make it clear.
[01:42:39.135 --> 01:42:40.476]  I'm assuming it was that morning.
[01:42:41.577 --> 01:42:42.577]  But no big deal.
[01:42:42.698 --> 01:42:43.378]  He got to work.
[01:42:45.305 --> 01:42:48.487]  They had no supplies in the police station.
[01:42:49.107 --> 01:42:53.088]  When the storm hit, of course, they wasn't hunkered down like everybody else.
[01:42:53.128 --> 01:42:55.449]  They ventured out as soon as they possibly could.
[01:42:55.789 --> 01:42:59.191]  He says it was already out of control when they ventured out.
[01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:01.352]  They were outmanned and outgunned.
[01:43:01.392 --> 01:43:07.414]  He said they had nothing but sidearms and one or two of his, he had 16 men approximately under his command.
[01:43:08.021 --> 01:43:13.024]  He said one or two of them had brought their deal rifles, their personal weapons from home, shotguns and stuff.
[01:43:13.284 --> 01:43:15.746]  They had no heavy armaments.
[01:43:16.426 --> 01:43:19.448]  They literally had to watch the looters.
[01:43:19.488 --> 01:43:21.169]  He said there was nothing they could do.
[01:43:21.809 --> 01:43:22.770]  Physically nothing.
[01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:25.311]  I'm going to say it again, outmanned and outgunned.
[01:43:25.692 --> 01:43:34.877]  They had to themselves, the police, go into several stores and actually loot the stores to have supplies in order to sustain themselves.
[01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:38.071]  Alex, it goes on and on.
[01:43:38.151 --> 01:43:39.972]  It was 45 minutes.
[01:43:40.372 --> 01:43:44.836]  Alex, it's unbelievable what this guy said.
[01:43:44.876 --> 01:43:51.361]  He is resigning and he said they are mass resigning because they were sold out by the administration.
[01:43:52.545 --> 01:43:54.828]  My administration, they mean the mayor?
[01:43:55.048 --> 01:43:58.471]  The mayor, or in the upper echelon of the NOPD.
[01:43:58.711 --> 01:43:59.832]  Well, where was the police?
[01:43:59.912 --> 01:44:00.893]  I mean, I know this.
[01:44:01.013 --> 01:44:11.884]  I know that they reported, and I don't know if this is accurate, that almost 75% of the police just didn't show up to duty, and so it was these very small units that were left, just a few hundred,
[01:44:12.744 --> 01:44:16.286]  Uh, that literally just planned amongst themselves what to do.
[01:44:16.746 --> 01:44:21.428]  That's why there were less than 10 police at the Superdome when people got there.
[01:44:21.468 --> 01:44:22.909]  I mean, that is just insane.
[01:44:23.529 --> 01:44:26.831]  Well, he didn't comment on the number.
[01:44:26.851 --> 01:44:27.852]  It didn't show up for work.
[01:44:27.972 --> 01:44:31.794]  All he commented on is what he did himself and what his men did.
[01:44:32.554 --> 01:44:40.898]  They commandeered a Chevron station near the police station that had, in fact, it was across the street.
[01:44:41.894 --> 01:44:47.558]  That hadn't been looted, and he said the only reason it hadn't been looted because it was across the street from the police department.
[01:44:47.598 --> 01:44:59.327]  He said they literally had to go into that Chevron, kick in the doors, and get water, the basic snack food, junk food, out of the Chevron in order to sustain their men and keep going.
[01:44:59.707 --> 01:45:06.652]  And he said while they were doing that, they were literally having to hold off the looters at gunpoint to keep them from being overrun.
[01:45:07.570 --> 01:45:10.333]  So, according to him, there really was a massive number of looters.
[01:45:10.933 --> 01:45:12.254]  Massive number of looters.
[01:45:12.614 --> 01:45:14.496]  Total breakdown in everything.
[01:45:14.516 --> 01:45:17.218]  He said they had no communication with any of the other units.
[01:45:17.238 --> 01:45:19.440]  Now, again, FEMA sent its own reports.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:25.905]  The number three major disaster after nuclear or huge earthquake on the West Coast is New Orleans.
[01:45:26.306 --> 01:45:27.607]  They knew what would happen.
[01:45:27.647 --> 01:45:28.948]  They didn't fix the levees.
[01:45:29.548 --> 01:45:32.190]  And the population was in denial about this.
[01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.892]  I mean, it's the same old story
[01:45:34.654 --> 01:45:39.505]  Time and time again, Dwayne comments on just the incredible things that J.W.
[01:45:40.247 --> 01:45:40.869]  is talking about.
[01:45:41.463 --> 01:45:41.903]  Oh, sure.
[01:45:42.023 --> 01:45:45.864]  And, you know, it's some great information to be coming out.
[01:45:46.444 --> 01:45:47.585]  No one's getting this stuff.
[01:45:48.245 --> 01:45:52.766]  The first-hand accounts from the evacuees is where the truth is really coming out, I think.
[01:45:53.566 --> 01:45:55.587]  Because they have nothing to lose, nothing to gain.
[01:45:56.587 --> 01:45:58.848]  They have no job to go to.
[01:45:58.908 --> 01:46:02.089]  There's really nothing left but them and their own frustration.
[01:46:02.509 --> 01:46:04.750]  And stories like this are all over the place.
[01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:09.731]  We're talking about a major city dying right in front of us.
[01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:11.332]  They knew this, Alex.
[01:46:11.693 --> 01:46:14.236]  This is not something that just fell out of the sky.
[01:46:14.256 --> 01:46:16.258]  New Orleans has been at risk all these years.
[01:46:16.278 --> 01:46:17.800]  Well then why do you think they let it happen?
[01:46:20.603 --> 01:46:27.411]  Well, I mean, if it was just, and I know this really sounds crazy, but if it was just a city in the Hortland,
[01:46:28.195 --> 01:46:28.896]  We're good to go.
[01:46:47.899 --> 01:46:57.807]  You know, when they're paying five bucks for a loaf of bread because the grain and everything that shipped out of the mouth of the Mississippi is shut down, not to mention the gas, the impact is just going to be huge.
[01:46:57.927 --> 01:47:04.953]  Exactly, the Mississippi supplies, the railheads, the shipping going up and down, it's like the third biggest port in the U.S.
[01:47:04.973 --> 01:47:05.893]  for import-export.
[01:47:08.135 --> 01:47:11.318]  Large portions of our fuels refined there?
[01:47:11.338 --> 01:47:12.519]  Ten major refineries, right.
[01:47:12.599 --> 01:47:15.242]  Ten major refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi are gone.
[01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:20.046]  They're shut in, which means they'll have to be cleaned out, turned around.
[01:47:20.066 --> 01:47:23.910]  And we're still saying that this isn't going to affect our economy.
[01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:34.063]  Uh, oh no, but I mean, you know, I know you keep asking for, you know, my personal feelings, and you know my personal feelings is that they revel in this misery.
[01:47:34.483 --> 01:47:35.083]  They love it.
[01:47:35.183 --> 01:47:51.551]  He can hardly contain himself when he bites his lip and looks square in the camera with, you know, this, uh, I don't know, that famous look he gives you, like, you know, the smirk on his face just drives you out of your mind sometimes because you just don't know what's in his head, but I think some of us know what's in his head.
[01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:52.672]  It's frightening.
[01:47:53.112 --> 01:47:54.252]  They revel in this misery.
[01:47:54.372 --> 01:47:55.473]  They don't have a problem with it.
[01:47:56.153 --> 01:47:57.854]  They'd rather be doing crap photo-op.
[01:47:57.894 --> 01:48:01.575]  Well, the evidence is they did nothing to stop it and now they're accentuating it.
[01:48:02.015 --> 01:48:07.677]  When your basic brains would have stopped much of this, do you agree with what you're hearing, JW?
[01:48:08.497 --> 01:48:09.277]  Yes, sir, I do.
[01:48:09.558 --> 01:48:14.619]  And if you'd like, I can get back to the additional information this officer gave.
[01:48:14.799 --> 01:48:16.020]  Sure, tell us a little bit more.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.701]  He managed to commandeer a mark.
[01:48:20.333 --> 01:48:20.953]  N.O.P.D.
[01:48:20.993 --> 01:48:22.894]  Sheriff Unit, Police Unit.
[01:48:22.974 --> 01:48:24.234]  He didn't have the keys to it.
[01:48:24.254 --> 01:48:37.697]  He broke the back glass out of the car, found some keys, drove it from out of New Orleans, got up to Gonzales, which is approximately 30-40 miles north of New Orleans, coming into Baton Rouge.
[01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:40.237]  It's there, again, up the distant suburb of Baton Rouge.
[01:48:41.037 --> 01:48:44.118]  Contacted his father and brother, who were in Baton Rouge.
[01:48:44.138 --> 01:48:48.319]  They met him in Gonzales, the local Walmart in Gonzales.
[01:48:50.151 --> 01:49:00.654]  Donated some clothing he purchased with his own money water and provisions and loaded them in his father's and his brother's personal vehicles and
[01:49:01.858 --> 01:49:03.520]  Escorted him back to New Orleans.
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:13.910]  He could not get in to help his men out with the... That is... You're telling me that a police lieutenant had to drive to a distant town to get water to go back to the police?
[01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:20.536]  That is absolutely... Oh, Alec, this story is horrifying, but I tell you what, this man, it is unbelievable.
[01:49:20.576 --> 01:49:21.917]  That's the reports we're getting.
[01:49:21.997 --> 01:49:23.479]  I mean, inklings of that are coming out.
[01:49:23.559 --> 01:49:26.922]  It's on the news wires, but you never see it on the nightly news.
[01:49:27.853 --> 01:49:32.714]  He earned him a round and he wouldn't jeopardize bringing his brother and his father in.
[01:49:55.114 --> 01:49:57.978]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.218 --> 01:49:59.800]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:04.826]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.166 --> 01:50:09.591]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:10.012 --> 01:50:14.197]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.417 --> 01:50:17.238]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.338 --> 01:50:22.000]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.642]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.842 --> 01:50:34.064]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:59.156 --> 01:53:01.037]  We're going to work on getting Lt.
[01:53:01.077 --> 01:53:01.837]  Waller on.
[01:53:01.877 --> 01:53:03.398]  We're calling the phone numbers right now.
[01:53:03.478 --> 01:53:06.760]  And it fits with the other stories that we've already gotten.
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.842]  But we're going to hear some more about this from J.W.
[01:53:10.862 --> 01:53:13.764]  there in Louisiana and Dwayne Cooch who's in Louisiana as well.
[01:53:14.704 --> 01:53:17.906]  Just briefly, my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[01:53:18.446 --> 01:53:23.409]  Oh yeah, the film's called Martial Law and we see Martial Law now in New Orleans.
[01:53:25.342 --> 01:53:28.283]  Everything is being geared up for this nationwide.
[01:53:28.403 --> 01:53:32.665]  Crises have been prepared that the globalists want to bring America down.
[01:53:34.185 --> 01:53:37.627]  And if they can use national disasters to do it, they will.
[01:53:37.687 --> 01:53:43.049]  But you need to get martial law because the criminal elements in the government orchestrated 9-11.
[01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:45.910]  The evidence is incontrovertible.
[01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:47.630]  It's totally documented.

[01:54:27.264 --> 01:54:32.886]  And you guys both speak whenever you wish, Dwayne and JW.
[01:54:33.286 --> 01:54:35.587]  JW, you said also that this Lt.
[01:54:35.627 --> 01:54:44.831]  Waller on your local TV station, WAFB Channel 9, was also saying that more details of what was happening in the Superdome
[01:54:45.799 --> 01:54:46.479]  That's correct.
[01:54:46.619 --> 01:54:57.062]  While he was in Gonzales, after he was turned around leaving New Orleans, he got made it back up to the Gonzales area, to the Lamar Dixon Center, where they was using as a staging area.
[01:54:57.482 --> 01:55:01.704]  And he ran into two friends of his that works for the Superdome Security or Police.
[01:55:02.264 --> 01:55:03.904]  I'm assuming they have their own division.
[01:55:04.664 --> 01:55:10.366]  And that's when he was advised of the horror stories that had taken place in the Superdome.
[01:55:10.825 --> 01:55:18.272]  Apparently they were a vigilante group who were trying to stop the pillaging, the plundering, and the raping that was going on.
[01:55:18.292 --> 01:55:25.159]  And when they actually could intervene in it, they literally were beating to death the rapers or the pillagers or whatever.
[01:55:25.939 --> 01:55:28.242]  Anarchy never lasts more than a month or so.
[01:55:28.442 --> 01:55:32.125]  Always good people rise up and reestablish government.
[01:55:32.766 --> 01:55:35.388]  Well, this is true and I firmly believe that.
[01:55:36.451 --> 01:55:41.655]  They would literally, after they beat him to death, open the doors and throw him out the Superdome.
[01:55:41.835 --> 01:55:45.517]  What type of scum runs around during a crisis trying to rape people?
[01:55:45.818 --> 01:55:48.619]  Alex, they were children being raped.
[01:55:48.639 --> 01:55:51.702]  He has got direct information on everything.
[01:55:51.882 --> 01:55:52.622]  He can verify everything.
[01:55:52.642 --> 01:55:53.463]  Well, that's admitted.
[01:55:53.523 --> 01:55:55.124]  The raping of the children is admitted.
[01:55:55.484 --> 01:55:56.365]  This is unbelievable.
[01:55:56.405 --> 01:55:57.906]  Dwayne, comments on what you're hearing?
[01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:00.012]  Sure, I'm still on?
[01:56:00.372 --> 01:56:00.693]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:00.893 --> 01:56:01.874]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:56:02.514 --> 01:56:03.876]  I stepped away during the break.
[01:56:04.476 --> 01:56:05.978]  We have a local thing here.
[01:56:06.498 --> 01:56:08.360]  There's a bus down on I-10.
[01:56:09.731 --> 01:56:10.192]  We're good to go.
[01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:31.870]  They were causing trouble.
[01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:36.611]  There was like a little micro-riot on the bus or whatever, so they had to just pull it off and they ran everyone off the bus.
[01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:37.131]  Oh, really?
[01:56:37.171 --> 01:56:39.232]  Okay, DeWayne, call us back as stuff develops.
[01:56:39.432 --> 01:56:42.133]  If I know anything, I'll get a hold of you as soon as I can.
[01:56:42.293 --> 01:56:44.133]  Thanks, DeWayne, and take care of yourself, my friend.
[01:56:44.153 --> 01:56:44.573]  God bless.
[01:56:45.554 --> 01:56:49.435]  Well, I tell you, J.W., you certainly called in with some important reports.
[01:56:49.495 --> 01:56:55.116]  A lot of what you're saying I've gotten bits and pieces of on the news wires, but maybe I'm missing it.
[01:56:55.136 --> 01:56:56.717]  Have you been watching national TV?
[01:56:58.468 --> 01:56:59.488]  Here's my last question.
[01:56:59.789 --> 01:57:04.470]  Are there two separate news feeds compared to local and national?
[01:57:05.210 --> 01:57:14.534]  Initially, yes there was Alex, but now I think the national media is coming on board with the local agencies because the coverage seems to be kind of going hand in hand.
[01:57:15.014 --> 01:57:21.356]  But regarding what he's talking about, the bus incidents, they were having to put armed guards on the buses.
[01:57:21.775 --> 01:57:29.782]  When they were transporting from point A to point B, wherever it may be, all the buses should have had armed security on them, on account of the problems that they were encountering.
[01:57:30.202 --> 01:57:30.983]  Unbelievable!
[01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:31.944]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:57:31.964 --> 01:57:32.864]  We're going to give you a phone number.
[01:57:33.745 --> 01:57:38.629]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:51.031]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:52.772]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.453 --> 01:57:54.574]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.214 --> 01:57:56.035]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.795 --> 01:57:57.716]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.357 --> 01:58:01.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:06.663]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.524 --> 01:58:14.490]  By the way, there is a holiday coming up on Monday, but I'm not taking off on Monday.
[01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:17.012]  I will be here live in studio
[01:58:17.955 --> 01:58:26.883]  For the full three hours, and I challenge the other talk show hosts on the Genesis Network to not take off, to be here.
[01:58:26.903 --> 01:58:31.307]  I know there's a bunch of live shows coming up this weekend.
[01:58:32.775 --> 01:58:36.016]  That are going to be covering what's happening here on the network.
[01:58:36.056 --> 01:58:46.260]  And I know our local affiliates, AM and FM out there that carry this broadcast, have also got a lot of great local shows that are going to be tracking what's happening.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:56.663]  But absolutely what the last caller in Baton Rouge was saying, up until about last night, the mainstream media, the dominant national news, was covering up what was happening.
[01:58:57.637 --> 01:59:07.223]  But it seems like the reporters got emotional on the ground and were just freaking out and screaming and complaining and crying and bad-mouthing the government.
[01:59:07.303 --> 01:59:12.687]  And then they go to break and they come back and apologize and say how great the government was.
[01:59:13.607 --> 01:59:15.429]  You could see they were being chastised.
[01:59:15.689 --> 01:59:17.830]  And now today there's more reporting.
[01:59:18.611 --> 01:59:21.192]  But not what you're getting from the local news channels.
[01:59:21.252 --> 01:59:21.853]  And we are
[01:59:23.303 --> 01:59:30.767]  Going to the local TV stations at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and so are a lot of other alternative news sites.
[01:59:30.807 --> 01:59:39.111]  We've always learned to circumvent the mainstream national news and go right to regional and local news and it's even worse when we go to the local news.
[01:59:40.152 --> 01:59:52.278]  But that is heartening, frankly, that the degenerates were raping and killing in the Superdome and citizens took the law into their own hands because we are the law and killed them.
[01:59:53.624 --> 01:59:58.186]  You know, the police today will tell you that there's no such thing as citizen's arrest.
[01:59:58.226 --> 02:00:04.770]  Well, what is it if somebody is robbing your house and you pull a gun on them and call the police?
[02:00:05.070 --> 02:00:06.110]  You have detained them.
[02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:08.672]  You have arrested them right there when you do that.
[02:00:09.792 --> 02:00:17.716]  What is it when you, you know, catch somebody robbing the liquor store next door and you pull a gun on them and get them down on the ground until the police get there?
[02:00:18.076 --> 02:00:19.277]  That's a citizen's arrest.
[02:00:21.204 --> 02:00:33.009]  And, uh, you know, if you don't even have guns to defend yourself, and it comes down to tire irons against a roving gang that's raping people, I mean, it's men's job to get together and take those thugs on.
[02:00:33.289 --> 02:00:35.610]  I mean, I'm not a tough guy, folks, but I guarantee you.
[02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:38.331]  There were roving gangs, and I was stuck in New Orleans.
[02:00:38.351 --> 02:00:39.291]  They were raping women.
[02:00:39.731 --> 02:00:40.872]  I don't care if there's ten of them.
[02:00:40.972 --> 02:00:41.852]  I'm gonna go after them.
[02:00:43.192 --> 02:00:45.433]  I'm gonna... It's just instinctive.
[02:00:45.954 --> 02:00:49.675]  And you'll be surprised, when you're in the right, folks, going up against people in the wrong,
[02:00:50.664 --> 02:00:52.045]  I mean, they're in trouble.
[02:00:52.285 --> 02:00:54.226]  It's just that's the way things work.
[02:00:55.546 --> 02:00:57.667]  So I commend the people that have been of the 250,000.
[02:00:57.707 --> 02:00:58.048]  It's not 15,000 folks.
[02:00:58.068 --> 02:01:03.750]  250,000 is the numbers we're getting from the officials in the area that are stuck in that city right now.
[02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:04.411]  I mean, it is.
[02:01:16.892 --> 02:01:17.712]  It is horrible.
[02:01:17.932 --> 02:01:20.133]  And the mayor said thousands dying a day.
[02:01:20.793 --> 02:01:21.954]  Now, I don't know if that's accurate.
[02:01:22.034 --> 02:01:26.595]  I think it's more accurate than, you know, what we're hearing from the federal government.
[02:01:26.635 --> 02:01:37.059]  So we'll go to break, and we'll come back and go straight to Tim, Art, Rick, Kyle, Barbara, and others, and I'm going to move quickly through your calls.
[02:01:37.119 --> 02:01:39.740]  In fact, right now, Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.180]  Go ahead.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.400]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:01:41.941 --> 02:01:45.682]  I think what we're seeing here with this rescue effort is a classic example
[02:01:46.494 --> 02:01:49.156]  Of your Hegelian dialectic that you talk about so much.
[02:01:49.557 --> 02:01:51.978]  They put them in shelters with no food, no water.
[02:01:52.039 --> 02:01:52.859]  They left them there.
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:54.260]  Days at a time.
[02:01:54.601 --> 02:01:57.323]  Now you know in medical community they talk about the three's rule.
[02:01:57.723 --> 02:02:01.986]  You can go three minutes without air, three days without water, and three weeks without food.
[02:02:02.026 --> 02:02:06.370]  So the longer that they extend this, the more desperate people are going to become.
[02:02:07.579 --> 02:02:08.279]  Well, I agree.
[02:02:08.359 --> 02:02:14.862]  And then FEMA, who's always wanted to have a big takeover, gets more funding, more control, more emergency powers.
[02:02:15.182 --> 02:02:19.844]  It legitimizes all those martial law powers that FEMA was given decades ago.
[02:02:19.924 --> 02:02:20.184]  No, no.
[02:02:20.524 --> 02:02:29.008]  I've been thinking this, and I haven't wanted to say this, Tim, but I think on purpose they've let this get out of control so they can now train us how to be good slaves.
[02:02:29.348 --> 02:02:30.188]  Sure.
[02:02:30.248 --> 02:02:35.070]  I saw that thing with Bush and Chertoff, the same thing you talked about in the hangar with the shirk, and both the governments were there saying,
[02:02:35.490 --> 02:02:38.174]  Oh, government is good, FEMA is great, blah blah blah.
[02:02:38.614 --> 02:02:45.303]  I just couldn't believe it that they were, while they're both standing there with their arms crossed, with the most negative, don't bother me body language that...
[02:02:45.931 --> 02:02:52.754]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:53.074 --> 02:02:54.454]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.654 --> 02:02:56.855]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:57.015 --> 02:02:59.096]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.376 --> 02:03:04.298]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.638 --> 02:03:08.680]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.701]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.781 --> 02:03:21.425]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.585 --> 02:03:23.465]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:03:47.136 --> 02:03:48.197]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.497 --> 02:03:51.279]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.559 --> 02:03:55.721]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.142 --> 02:03:56.982]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.282 --> 02:04:01.845]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.325 --> 02:04:04.466]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:45.726 --> 02:04:52.236]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:04:52.456 --> 02:04:56.502]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:04:56.743 --> 02:04:58.906]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:04:59.266 --> 02:05:00.949]  All Natural Non-X clears out the
[02:05:01.049 --> 02:05:01.449]  I don't know.
[02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:37.974]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:38.374 --> 02:05:43.756]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:46.758 --> 02:05:48.939]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:52.321]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:17.159 --> 02:06:41.307]  You know, it's taken me a few days to come to this conclusion, and I didn't want to, but from every indicator we've got, from every piece of evidence, every action by this federal government, it is overwhelmingly clear that they knew New Orleans in the very near future would be hit by a hurricane and would flood out.
[02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:44.428]  They deliberately didn't fix it.
[02:06:45.592 --> 02:07:01.117]  They deliberately did not get aid into those people, told them to go to the Superdome, didn't give them any security, any protection, food, water, nothing, knowing it would descend into bedlam.
[02:07:01.157 --> 02:07:07.199]  Now the Feds are going to get criticized, but then they're going to come in and we're going to hear, oh, they need more power, more control.
[02:07:07.539 --> 02:07:09.280]  Well, FEMA's always had those powers.
[02:07:11.092 --> 02:07:25.110]  For total martial law, for work brigades, for national drafts, and just this whole thing stinks to high heaven, and bad things are going to come out of this, period.
[02:07:27.365 --> 02:07:34.414]  And don't expect people to learn from the fact that government can't protect you, won't protect you, and doesn't want to protect you.
[02:07:34.875 --> 02:07:36.597]  Tim in Ohio, finish up what you were saying.
[02:07:36.797 --> 02:07:37.758]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:07:37.818 --> 02:07:39.040]  Thank you Alex, too, for holding me over.
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:44.707]  I saw that Bush and Chertoff in the hangar there when they were going over to things, and they both
[02:07:45.154 --> 02:07:54.279]  Just had their arms crossed across their bodies with them smirks on their faces, you know, and if you study body language, that's like, you know, go away, leave me alone, I don't want to be bothered with it.
[02:07:54.619 --> 02:07:58.361]  What we're looking at here, I think, is part of genocide.
[02:07:58.401 --> 02:08:01.843]  We have poor people, we have black people, a lot of people on welfare down there.
[02:08:03.264 --> 02:08:07.186]  You're talking about 75,000 refugees headed towards your state already.
[02:08:07.526 --> 02:08:18.956]  What it looks like to me is the New World Order getting a toehold from Texas all the way to Florida and I pray that that Bell South building down in New Orleans doesn't catch on fire because your whole region is going to lose telephone service.
[02:08:19.916 --> 02:08:21.418]  Because a lot of lines go through there.
[02:08:22.498 --> 02:08:28.183]  Well, I hope that's not the case, but yeah, there are fires now burning out of control in different areas of New Orleans.
[02:08:28.203 --> 02:08:29.644]  Who do you think is setting those?
[02:08:29.704 --> 02:08:32.367]  Do you think that could be agents or do you think that's gangs going around?
[02:08:33.187 --> 02:08:36.450]  Well, also you've got gas mains that never got turned off, you've got
[02:08:38.091 --> 02:08:46.837]  You've got looters, you've got people trying to start fires to cook food... And when you order an evacuation, why didn't they have buses going around collecting these people beforehand?
[02:08:46.877 --> 02:08:53.942]  They just don't... You know, if FEMA's supposed to... And listen up, freedom-loving listeners, Alex is exactly right.
[02:08:54.082 --> 02:09:00.126]  FEMA is not there to help any of us, or else this situation would not have escalated into what it has.
[02:09:00.406 --> 02:09:04.029]  Well, we've had thousands of deaths before in Florida, and they just covered it up.
[02:09:05.106 --> 02:09:06.067]  Oh yeah, K.T.
[02:09:06.127 --> 02:09:07.388]  Brankovich's book, right?
[02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:16.394]  Where Heavens Meet, where the one FEMA agent told her to put her name and her phone number in her pocket, and her next of kin, so we found her dead the next day, no one to call.
[02:09:18.575 --> 02:09:23.819]  Well, it's a really arrogant attitude, and it's about controlling populations, and again,
[02:09:24.795 --> 02:09:26.736]  Foreign governments tried to bring in water filters.
[02:09:26.776 --> 02:09:27.496]  They said no.
[02:09:28.176 --> 02:09:34.318]  Other state governments tried to come with convoys of police and others with emergency gear and they said no.
[02:09:34.898 --> 02:09:38.899]  We've got to do it the way we say and then now look at it, it's a total disaster.
[02:09:40.159 --> 02:09:46.681]  Still the media though isn't talking about how the government ordered the funding slashed to nothing to fix those levees.
[02:09:46.701 --> 02:09:47.621]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:48.521 --> 02:09:50.622]  Problem, reaction, solution, yes.
[02:09:51.529 --> 02:09:54.951]  Uh, let's go ahead and go on to the next caller here.
[02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:57.212]  Arton, Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:09:57.252 --> 02:09:57.952]  Go ahead, welcome.
[02:09:58.232 --> 02:09:58.793]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:59.153 --> 02:09:59.533]  Hi.
[02:09:59.633 --> 02:10:02.634]  We had the burning of Atlanta, now we've got the flooding of New Orleans.
[02:10:04.455 --> 02:10:12.439]  And, did you hear, somebody called in Joyce Riley's show this morning reporting there were explosions in the levee area before the flooding began.
[02:10:14.634 --> 02:10:21.215]  Well, did they list a news, or a newspaper, or a source, or did they just say that?
[02:10:21.635 --> 02:10:23.316]  It was second-hand, they just said it.
[02:10:23.636 --> 02:10:27.217]  But they acted like they knew what they were talking about, the residents near the levee.
[02:10:27.237 --> 02:10:28.837]  Unfortunately, I can't go with that.
[02:10:29.637 --> 02:10:29.957]  I know.
[02:10:30.217 --> 02:10:38.799]  But I do find it very, very suspicious that the one area that was being worked on, the levee, that it just had a contractor there, is the area that broke.
[02:10:39.767 --> 02:10:44.570]  Just like the one area of the Pentagon being worked on is the area that gets hit by a magic airplane.
[02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:45.330]  Exactly.
[02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:46.531]  Exactly.
[02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:49.592]  I figured those holes at the Pentagon were already pre-cut.
[02:10:50.853 --> 02:10:51.873]  For whatever that's worth.
[02:10:52.254 --> 02:10:56.256]  But now I've also heard that Bush was at two parties during these last five days.
[02:10:56.296 --> 02:10:57.256]  Some birthday party.
[02:10:57.296 --> 02:10:57.716]  No, no.
[02:10:57.836 --> 02:10:58.517]  That is true.
[02:10:58.777 --> 02:11:00.498]  In fact, he was at more than two parties.
[02:11:00.558 --> 02:11:02.879]  He was at about... He's unfit for office then.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:04.500]  I'm sorry.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:05.040]  I don't care.
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.342]  Maybe Halliburton might take him or Bechtel or whoever might take him.
[02:11:08.959 --> 02:11:10.643]  But not for a country.
[02:11:11.785 --> 02:11:17.757]  And somebody also reported this morning that troops were coming in to go house to house to disarm down there.
[02:11:18.338 --> 02:11:19.561]  But they'd have to do it by boat.
[02:11:21.005 --> 02:11:31.331]  Oh, well that's admittedly what's happening out in the open, is they're sending in 300, as if they could do anything, hardened Iraq veterans who've done checkpoints and gun confiscation.
[02:11:31.751 --> 02:11:38.575]  They're sending them in to lead the other 20,000 troops that are in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[02:11:38.975 --> 02:11:46.259]  I guess a total of 50,000 all counting those on ships and regular army and those piloting the helicopters and C-130s.
[02:11:49.207 --> 02:11:50.687]  That's going to do absolutely nothing.
[02:11:51.108 --> 02:11:59.930]  They've got to specifically target the leaders of these armed gangs that are basically going around piling up huge caches of goodies.
[02:11:59.950 --> 02:12:02.491]  What if those gangs are actual residents?
[02:12:03.931 --> 02:12:05.992]  I've got a sneaking suspicion they are.
[02:12:06.072 --> 02:12:10.173]  I mean, you've got one of the poorest, most gang member type
[02:12:11.368 --> 02:12:15.471]  group, you know, populations in the country is in New Orleans, sir.
[02:12:15.491 --> 02:12:15.951]  Yeah.
[02:12:16.311 --> 02:12:18.993]  And, I mean, this type of stuff has happened throughout history.
[02:12:19.033 --> 02:12:19.593]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:20.254 --> 02:12:21.955]  I mean, I will say this about our military.
[02:12:23.176 --> 02:12:30.680]  Our military is not looting and is not killing, and most armies throughout history do do that in bad situations.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:38.605]  In fact, the American Army, even back in 1776, when they took Boston back from the British,
[02:12:40.195 --> 02:12:46.183]  Their looting and riping was small compared to the British.
[02:12:47.905 --> 02:12:48.907]  They did do it, though.
[02:12:49.948 --> 02:12:51.751]  And that is a tendency of war.
[02:12:53.092 --> 02:12:57.178]  But you popped in my ear, John, and told me something I didn't understand.
[02:12:59.975 --> 02:13:01.336]  Oh, okay.
[02:13:02.057 --> 02:13:02.357]  Thank you.
[02:13:02.718 --> 02:13:05.680]  I did hear his radio was on, and I should have told him to turn it off.
[02:13:05.741 --> 02:13:16.791]  Yeah, folks, you call in with your radio blaring in the background, and I never understand that, because then I hear it rebroadcast, and half of what you're saying is inaudible, and I don't know why.
[02:13:18.392 --> 02:13:21.795]  And I get so used to it that I don't even ask people to turn them off anymore.
[02:13:22.616 --> 02:13:24.438]  It just makes your call sound horrible.
[02:13:26.846 --> 02:13:29.449]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:33.853]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Washington.
[02:13:33.933 --> 02:13:34.554]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:13:34.574 --> 02:13:35.355]  Hey, Guy.
[02:13:35.975 --> 02:13:36.896]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:13:36.936 --> 02:13:37.897]  First time caller.
[02:13:37.917 --> 02:13:39.238]  Nice to talk to you, sir.
[02:13:39.258 --> 02:13:39.659]  Go ahead.
[02:13:40.139 --> 02:13:41.200]  Okay.
[02:13:41.801 --> 02:13:43.603]  We're trying to find you up on C, Ben.
[02:13:43.643 --> 02:13:45.705]  Can't do that, but I'll continue on.
[02:13:46.112 --> 02:13:49.595]  I think what everybody should get a hold of is some AOR scanners.
[02:13:49.675 --> 02:13:53.899]  If Ted can make a deal on that and have you guys sell them.
[02:13:53.999 --> 02:13:57.603]  Police scanners and you can find out a lot of information that way.
[02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:02.107]  Your caller guy told me to go ahead and pass it along.
[02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:05.222]  Up on G3 for the guys that have the big C-Band.
[02:14:05.262 --> 02:14:06.563]  My caller guy.
[02:14:06.744 --> 02:14:07.865]  Who's my caller guy?
[02:14:08.365 --> 02:14:11.488]  I'm confused what you're talking about.
[02:14:12.028 --> 02:14:13.770]  The guy that receives your calls for you.
[02:14:14.190 --> 02:14:17.573]  And then can't find me on C-Span and my caller guy.
[02:14:19.014 --> 02:14:19.514]  Okay.
[02:14:19.974 --> 02:14:20.975]  I'm just confused.
[02:14:21.175 --> 02:14:21.755]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:14:21.795 --> 02:14:24.215]  I'm fighting through a little migraine headache here.
[02:14:24.255 --> 02:14:26.556]  They've been spraying us the last couple days up here.
[02:14:26.656 --> 02:14:27.496]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:14:27.576 --> 02:14:28.836]  I'm just, I'm stupid.
[02:14:28.956 --> 02:14:29.817]  I need your help.
[02:14:30.317 --> 02:14:31.557]  I'm not at the level you are.
[02:14:31.697 --> 02:14:32.797]  Explain to me what you're saying.
[02:14:33.338 --> 02:14:38.259]  Oh, I think you're beyond my level here, but anyway, guy, I'm trying to talk with this migraine going on.
[02:14:39.179 --> 02:14:44.860]  Up on the C-band satellite dishes, the big ones, a lot of the C-band guys, they're listening.
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:46.361]  You can see on G3,
[02:14:47.603 --> 02:14:50.265]  And KU banned K3, a lot of Fox feed.
[02:14:50.785 --> 02:14:53.787]  You can see their little security guards and the police holding back crowds.
[02:14:53.907 --> 02:14:57.590]  No wonder these reporters are breaking down.
[02:14:58.834 --> 02:15:00.275]  Well, I'm begging you.
[02:15:00.295 --> 02:15:02.476]  Yeah, reality's coming in.
[02:15:02.536 --> 02:15:03.796]  I think this is all a big test.
[02:15:03.856 --> 02:15:07.078]  Frankly, I think this is a New World Order takeover test.
[02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:08.318]  It isn't going well for them.
[02:15:08.738 --> 02:15:16.081]  And frankly, in the long term, that bodes well for the American people that the globalist takeover plan is showing how pathetic they are.
[02:15:16.442 --> 02:15:18.042]  It's bad for the people of New Orleans.
[02:15:18.462 --> 02:15:22.004]  But I'm begging you, those of you that have the unscrambled feeds,
[02:15:22.464 --> 02:15:24.044]  Please record that.
[02:15:24.484 --> 02:15:26.105]  Please mail that to me.
[02:15:27.105 --> 02:15:30.726]  Okay, thank you for describing the first part of what you were talking about.
[02:15:30.766 --> 02:15:31.626]  Now the second part.
[02:15:32.126 --> 02:15:38.587]  Yeah, well, I wish I could be sending you some tapes, too, but we seem to keep getting stuff destroyed up here that goes towards your place.
[02:15:39.448 --> 02:15:43.108]  FoxSpeed's also on S4, so is the Univision.
[02:15:43.328 --> 02:15:47.629]  I don't speak Mexican, so I don't know what they're saying, but they're showing a lot more stuff.
[02:15:47.909 --> 02:15:50.810]  And FEMA shows up sometimes on T5.
[02:15:51.974 --> 02:15:53.735]  For you guys out there with the big C-Band.
[02:15:53.915 --> 02:15:54.175]  Okay.
[02:15:54.195 --> 02:15:56.556]  And we send Alex the tapes.
[02:15:56.656 --> 02:15:58.937]  We got our Wally World VCRs.
[02:15:58.977 --> 02:16:00.518]  We just turned two back in.
[02:16:00.778 --> 02:16:04.639]  And we go through about ten every couple months or whatever.
[02:16:05.059 --> 02:16:11.622]  And the only place I would trust to donate to is Salvation Army, even though they are part of the United Way.
[02:16:11.702 --> 02:16:12.823]  I think they're going to be involved.
[02:16:12.843 --> 02:16:13.343]  No, totally.
[02:16:13.683 --> 02:16:15.004]  They're part of the United Way.
[02:16:15.024 --> 02:16:15.104]  Yeah.
[02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:18.050]  They took them over a long time ago.
[02:16:18.230 --> 02:16:19.752]  Man, to show my ignorance.
[02:16:19.992 --> 02:16:23.936]  No, no, no.
[02:16:24.036 --> 02:16:26.619]  We used to volunteer for them on Christmas and New Years.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:33.386]  I'd spend Christmas and New Years in downtown Dallas with my parents at the soup lines taking care of people.
[02:16:33.446 --> 02:16:35.869]  I'm not bragging but that's what we did for Christmas.
[02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:38.970]  Back in the 80's I knew a lot of people that left it.
[02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:45.292]  But I knew they weren't as good as they used to be, but I knew that still they actually did some good compared to other charities.
[02:16:45.332 --> 02:16:47.672]  You're telling me the evil United Way took them over?
[02:16:48.653 --> 02:16:55.715]  Back in the 80's, this is what I remember, because I had several guys that quit the Salvation Army that went into other ministries than that.
[02:16:55.815 --> 02:17:00.636]  But anyway, I would highly recommend everybody get a police scanner.
[02:17:00.716 --> 02:17:04.217]  I know there's a lot of municipalities that are scrambled in that.
[02:17:04.853 --> 02:17:07.194]  And I would also highly suggest get shortwave.
[02:17:08.234 --> 02:17:10.094]  We've got that woodpecker signal up here.
[02:17:10.134 --> 02:17:12.915]  It seems to get stronger anytime there's a disaster around.
[02:17:13.575 --> 02:17:17.797]  But for people, you can still... Hello?
[02:17:18.937 --> 02:17:20.277]  Yeah, you just hit your redial button.
[02:17:21.197 --> 02:17:21.738]  Oh, I didn't.
[02:17:22.058 --> 02:17:23.058]  Okay, well, somebody did.
[02:17:23.078 --> 02:17:23.538]  Just... Okay.
[02:17:23.938 --> 02:17:26.179]  Anyway, I appreciate everything.
[02:17:26.199 --> 02:17:30.320]  We're still trying to find you up here and on several of the deals.
[02:17:30.979 --> 02:17:32.382]  By trying to find me.
[02:17:32.582 --> 02:17:33.484]  Find me on what?
[02:17:33.845 --> 02:17:36.670]  Try to find you on C-band, because shortwave does not make it up here.
[02:17:37.311 --> 02:17:38.093]  Oh, I gotcha.
[02:17:39.195 --> 02:17:40.698]  Alright, thank you for the call, sir.
[02:17:40.798 --> 02:17:41.680]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.050 --> 02:17:49.431]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:17:49.671 --> 02:17:50.011]  Why?
[02:17:50.031 --> 02:17:52.972]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[02:18:48.576 --> 02:18:53.078]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:53.418 --> 02:18:57.519]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:57.799 --> 02:18:58.359]  We listened.
[02:18:58.659 --> 02:19:03.641]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:03.921 --> 02:19:04.401]  We listened.
[02:19:04.801 --> 02:19:07.843]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:08.243 --> 02:19:08.803]  We listened.
[02:19:09.263 --> 02:19:12.244]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:19:12.244 --> 02:19:12.644]  I think so.
[02:19:39.154 --> 02:19:43.158]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:19:43.638 --> 02:19:46.321]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:48.803 --> 02:19:51.125]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[02:19:51.445 --> 02:19:52.466]  The real money folks.
[02:19:55.769 --> 02:19:57.671]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:19:58.171 --> 02:19:59.072]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:20:01.681 --> 02:20:03.562]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[02:20:04.083 --> 02:20:06.465]  A 5% increase.
[02:20:07.005 --> 02:20:12.929]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[02:20:13.049 --> 02:20:16.232]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:20:17.012 --> 02:20:19.374]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:20:19.394 --> 02:20:22.636]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:23.257 --> 02:20:26.259]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:20:47.961 --> 02:20:52.324]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of different medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:20:52.584 --> 02:20:54.246]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:20:54.406 --> 02:20:57.088]  Yes, I said drinking water, but not just any water.
[02:20:57.268 --> 02:21:01.571]  You need Electrolyzed Oxidized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[02:21:01.671 --> 02:21:10.838]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.

[02:21:40.659 --> 02:21:41.059]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:21:54.657 --> 02:22:01.441]  A couple weeks ago, Alan Greenspan comes out and says the economy could plunge, we could have a crash in the housing.
[02:22:01.982 --> 02:22:08.746]  It's because we're protectionist, we're the opposite of a protectionist economy when it comes to our trade policies.
[02:22:09.907 --> 02:22:20.514]  And then now we have this, where much of the country's fuel, over half the East Coast fuel, is refined, is totally shut down.
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:24.722]  We have about a quarter million people stuck in a major city.
[02:22:25.702 --> 02:22:28.424]  We have several other states that are devastated.
[02:22:29.444 --> 02:22:35.107]  And Bush and Chertoff are dancing around telling us everything's fine, both of them looking like total psychopaths.
[02:22:35.167 --> 02:22:45.933]  I mean, Chertoff, not just that he's evil and responsible for all the anti-patriot, anti-christian stuff in FEMA and Homeland Security, but just that he just looks evil.
[02:22:45.953 --> 02:22:49.735]  It's like some evil character from a horror movie.
[02:22:50.906 --> 02:22:54.268]  Uh, prancing around, people clapping for them.
[02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:58.310]  I mean, it just shows the delusional nature of all these people.
[02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:06.115]  And Bush waddles with his arms out at his sides like a chimpanzee, like he's some super powerful gorilla or something.
[02:23:06.175 --> 02:23:09.176]  I mean, heaven help us.
[02:23:09.316 --> 02:23:13.719]  I mean, we got that little trollop, that little creature in there.
[02:23:14.059 --> 02:23:15.680]  Again, he's just a puppet, folks.
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:18.081]  I think they may be getting ready to flush Bush.
[02:23:18.221 --> 02:23:19.322]  I have to say I was wrong.
[02:23:20.074 --> 02:23:24.156]  Back on Monday and Tuesday I said he'll get an approval rating boost out of this because he'll handle it.
[02:23:24.716 --> 02:23:27.217]  Because Jeb had always done that and others had always done that.
[02:23:28.177 --> 02:23:31.939]  And they're not doing that this time and the media is just savaging him.
[02:23:33.119 --> 02:23:36.361]  So will Georgie Porgy carry out some type of terror attack?
[02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:39.342]  Is this a shift inside the New World Order?
[02:23:39.382 --> 02:23:42.003]  Are they getting ready to hang him out to dry?
[02:23:43.703 --> 02:23:47.305]  I don't know, but I tell you, we are on the razor's edge right now.
[02:23:48.132 --> 02:23:51.273]  We're going to be here tracking and following this as it happens.
[02:23:53.073 --> 02:23:55.694]  Some talk show hosts call it radio graffiti.
[02:23:57.634 --> 02:24:00.615]  That's where they give each person one sentence or one statement.
[02:24:00.715 --> 02:24:07.316]  I'm not going to do that, but I'm going to give you all just a little bit of time because I want people who can't get in to have a chance.
[02:24:07.336 --> 02:24:08.257]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:08.277 --> 02:24:09.837]  We've got about 34 minutes left here today.
[02:24:15.101 --> 02:24:17.462]  Let's go to Kyle in California.
[02:24:17.502 --> 02:24:17.982]  Go ahead.
[02:24:19.743 --> 02:24:21.644]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:21.684 --> 02:24:29.107]  You son of a gun, you beat me to the punch, because that's exactly what I think, that's throwing Bush under the bus with this whole thing.
[02:24:29.167 --> 02:24:34.210]  In my opinion, weeks of New World Order, as crazy as the hurricane itself.
[02:24:35.930 --> 02:24:37.491]  They have the legislation they want.
[02:24:37.591 --> 02:24:41.533]  I really don't think they need them anymore, to be honest with you, and they need to be empowered.
[02:24:42.153 --> 02:24:43.974]  I wanted to call with a
[02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:52.293]  A message to everybody, if you can, connect to families in that area through craigslist.org.
[02:24:52.733 --> 02:24:54.834]  We need to get people out of that area.
[02:24:54.854 --> 02:24:57.696]  There's probably going to be another 10 storms coming through there.
[02:24:58.096 --> 02:24:59.897]  We need to provide jobs.
[02:25:00.017 --> 02:25:05.139]  Well, I don't know about 10, but the chance of another hurricane hitting the Gulf is very good.
[02:25:06.505 --> 02:25:10.007]  Well, there's plenty of options.
[02:25:10.227 --> 02:25:12.829]  They can do pretty funny things with this letter, I think.
[02:25:13.169 --> 02:25:14.910]  If they want to keep hitting them, they will.
[02:25:16.331 --> 02:25:18.612]  So you think there's a group controlling it?
[02:25:19.695 --> 02:25:27.337]  I'm not sure of it, sir, but I think that there's plenty of evidence or plenty of information put forward to allow that.
[02:25:27.397 --> 02:25:28.818]  But it's people above Bush.
[02:25:28.898 --> 02:25:31.818]  I mean, I'm talking... Oh, certainly, Bush is a puppet either way.
[02:25:32.018 --> 02:25:33.639]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:33.659 --> 02:25:34.299]  Great points.
[02:25:35.419 --> 02:25:36.420]  Look, I've got to say this.
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:45.122]  Some of the tracks of the hurricanes we've had in the last three years have never happened before.
[02:25:48.115 --> 02:25:51.358]  I mean, stuff is happening that's never happened before.
[02:25:51.598 --> 02:25:53.640]  They were very predictable in the past.
[02:25:55.301 --> 02:25:57.744]  And there is weather modification devices.
[02:25:58.444 --> 02:25:59.926]  It is real.
[02:26:00.706 --> 02:26:04.189]  The people I've talked to that I trust, they don't have the power to control storms.
[02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:08.453]  They do have the power to make storms worse or to create storms.
[02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:10.275]  I just...
[02:26:10.905 --> 02:26:11.265]  You know what?
[02:26:11.345 --> 02:26:12.166]  I don't know what to think.
[02:26:12.246 --> 02:26:13.087]  I mean, you know what?
[02:26:13.227 --> 02:26:29.199]  I go off what I can prove, and I know the government purposefully didn't fix those dykes, and purposefully won't let people in to help those folks, and they want it to go bad, and I think they want it to wreck the economy so they can blame it on that.
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:35.725]  Because they're already ready to pop the real estate bubble, the plunge of the dollar.
[02:26:36.325 --> 02:26:37.246]  They're already ready.
[02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:43.014]  They're already making noises, that is the controllers above Bush, that they want to do this.
[02:26:43.154 --> 02:26:56.323]  And I said, some type of disaster or some type of terror attack will come right before any type of real plunge in the economy so they can blame it on that.
[02:26:57.824 --> 02:27:03.268]  And I tell you, I've got a lot of anxiety right now and things do not look good.
[02:27:03.328 --> 02:27:04.489]  I think we're going to make it through this.
[02:27:05.513 --> 02:27:08.135]  With the pack of criminals we have running things, I don't know.
[02:27:08.696 --> 02:27:11.057]  Okay, now, see, I just spent about a minute and a half with that caller.
[02:27:11.498 --> 02:27:13.959]  I just babbled for about a minute and a half, and we got to one call.
[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:16.802]  When I come back, I am controlling myself.
[02:27:17.202 --> 02:27:22.766]  No matter how good your points are, you get no more than 60 seconds so we can get the next person in.
[02:27:23.487 --> 02:27:25.388]  And as soon as you hear somebody hang up, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:25.428 --> 02:27:27.049]  We're going right to your calls.
[02:27:27.069 --> 02:27:27.129]  Bam!
[02:27:27.209 --> 02:27:27.490]  Bam!
[02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.590]  Bam!
[02:27:27.930 --> 02:27:28.430]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:36.328 --> 02:27:39.358]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.261 --> 02:27:42.950]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.512 --> 02:27:49.853]  ...to suffer from pain, illness and disease.
[02:27:50.014 --> 02:27:58.399]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach, hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.719 --> 02:28:06.644]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.784 --> 02:28:13.828]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:14.048 --> 02:28:15.248]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:15.409 --> 02:28:18.790]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:19.970]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:20.250 --> 02:28:21.531]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.731 --> 02:28:28.573]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.673 --> 02:28:31.134]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:34.315 --> 02:28:35.276]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.636 --> 02:28:51.619]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[02:28:54.221 --> 02:28:57.363]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.

[02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:08.791]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:09.111 --> 02:29:18.482]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.722 --> 02:29:22.226]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.467 --> 02:29:29.575]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:47.964 --> 02:29:54.807]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:55.087 --> 02:29:57.448]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:57.708 --> 02:29:59.669]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:30:00.010 --> 02:30:05.352]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:05.752 --> 02:30:06.212]  We're good to go.
[02:30:26.139 --> 02:30:29.281]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:29.521 --> 02:30:32.982]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.179 --> 02:30:58.420]  Look folks, it's simple.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:17.332]  People that couldn't make a living in the free market, people that just couldn't get it together to be entrepreneurs, parasites, criminals, lazy bureaucrats, that's who you get in government.
[02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:28.846]  And they'll never protect you, they can't protect you, they don't want to protect you, and FEMA's going to get massive increases in funding off of this.
[02:31:29.427 --> 02:31:34.630]  Which they'll use for cameras and microphones and armored vehicles and oppression.
[02:31:35.811 --> 02:31:40.554]  And just like the Redcoats learned in 1776, you know, during the next eight years of war,
[02:31:43.263 --> 02:31:44.243]  It doesn't matter.
[02:31:45.504 --> 02:31:48.805]  If they're in the wrong, they're never going to be able to dominate us.
[02:31:49.765 --> 02:31:56.587]  So for those of you that are afraid of the federal government and think they're going to come take your liberty, they have to have your acquiescence.
[02:31:56.607 --> 02:31:58.507]  They have to have you feel like you're powerless.
[02:31:58.807 --> 02:32:00.708]  They have to have you follow their orders.
[02:32:01.548 --> 02:32:08.850]  Whether it's for the new Freedom Initiative, or a national draft, or for the Open Border Program, or for anything!
[02:32:09.250 --> 02:32:10.310]  Just say no!
[02:32:11.131 --> 02:32:12.471]  I'm not going along with you!
[02:32:14.136 --> 02:32:27.681]  The only thing the government can do effectively is block aid, is try to block the Minutemen from defending the border, is try to block churches from really helping the homeless, which they do in many different cities.
[02:32:28.262 --> 02:32:39.086]  All they can do is effectively block the police chiefs and sheriffs trying to bring in convoys of police to restore order, because it's got to be FEMA's way, and FEMA's got to direct everybody.
[02:32:39.866 --> 02:32:43.528]  I love Pat Buchanan saying, you know, don't wait for orders from headquarters,
[02:32:44.159 --> 02:32:45.680]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[02:32:46.421 --> 02:32:49.522]  People always say, we need a centralized patriot movement.
[02:32:49.983 --> 02:32:51.944]  We need to all be under one banner.
[02:32:52.825 --> 02:32:55.766]  Well, it's federal provocateur groups that always say that.
[02:32:57.247 --> 02:32:59.789]  So they can then cut the head off of the leadership.
[02:32:59.809 --> 02:33:02.631]  So they can then, we need leaderless resistance.
[02:33:03.251 --> 02:33:05.052]  Leaderless leadership.
[02:33:05.733 --> 02:33:07.354]  We need all of you to be leaders.
[02:33:08.644 --> 02:33:11.786]  And, uh, you start by being self-sufficient.
[02:33:11.846 --> 02:33:15.569]  You start by having a community of people you trust locally.
[02:33:16.089 --> 02:33:18.771]  You start by taking over your city or town.
[02:33:19.351 --> 02:33:20.492]  And that can be done.
[02:33:20.572 --> 02:33:22.073]  Just ignore the feds.
[02:33:22.353 --> 02:33:23.634]  Just a pack of criminals.
[02:33:24.314 --> 02:33:35.561]  Too busy sucking off the government, you know, with bid rigging and contracts to even... Look, the New World Order has got control of this country, but now they want to butcher it.
[02:33:36.322 --> 02:33:38.003]  And they're going to have trouble butchering it.
[02:33:38.812 --> 02:33:41.735]  And they're going to lose all credibility in the process of butchering it.
[02:33:42.195 --> 02:33:45.338]  Empires always fail, folks, and they're going to fail.
[02:33:45.779 --> 02:33:47.160]  They don't have all the power.
[02:33:47.941 --> 02:33:57.089]  Their own minions, their own servants are waking up every day and joining us, the patriots, the truth seekers, the freedom lovers.
[02:33:58.311 --> 02:34:02.575]  And I think this FEMA grandstanding operation is blowing up in their face.
[02:34:04.176 --> 02:34:09.458]  Unfortunately, it's at the expense of an entire region and perhaps an entire country's economy.
[02:34:09.838 --> 02:34:10.958]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:34:12.299 --> 02:34:13.919]  Here we go to your calls, quickly.
[02:34:14.639 --> 02:34:16.540]  Barbara in Nebraska, go ahead.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:17.540]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:23.042]  I'm looking in a newspaper article from the Omaha paper last August 31.
[02:34:23.142 --> 02:34:31.425]  The FEMA coordinating officer for Louisiana is named William Locus, L-O-K-E-S.
[02:34:32.734 --> 02:34:46.013]  He said that in recent years, years, FEMA had been asked to simulate housing one million people after a catastrophic event in southern Louisiana.
[02:34:47.075 --> 02:34:48.938]  Now that sounds like somebody knew something.
[02:34:51.076 --> 02:34:51.697]  Great points.
[02:34:51.877 --> 02:35:00.800]  They admittedly knew that it would become Lake Pontchartrain or New Atlantis if there was anywhere near a direct hit and they did nothing.
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:03.161]  In fact, they cut the funding on the levees.
[02:35:03.221 --> 02:35:04.081]  That is public.
[02:35:04.101 --> 02:35:04.761]  That is admitted.
[02:35:07.762 --> 02:35:09.283]  Thank you for all the coverage, Alex.
[02:35:09.463 --> 02:35:11.484]  Well, thank you for the call and the great point.
[02:35:11.584 --> 02:35:12.624]  I mean, of course they knew.
[02:35:13.718 --> 02:35:18.021]  And no matter how bad this makes the government look, they're going to use this to get even more power.
[02:35:18.461 --> 02:35:19.862]  Well, see, we screwed up.
[02:35:20.522 --> 02:35:21.783]  It's just like education.
[02:35:22.123 --> 02:35:25.685]  Their own manuals say it's to dumb kids down, but those are internal.
[02:35:26.085 --> 02:35:26.565]  We have them.
[02:35:26.585 --> 02:35:28.667]  They're public, but not widely distributed.
[02:35:29.047 --> 02:35:32.889]  Then education scores drop, and they go, see, we need more funds.
[02:35:33.169 --> 02:35:34.050]  They drop even more.
[02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:35.090]  See, we need more funds.
[02:35:35.571 --> 02:35:36.611]  Same thing with the hurricane.
[02:35:36.631 --> 02:35:37.752]  Oh, we need more funds.
[02:35:39.594 --> 02:35:42.676]  We've had a war on terror, and terrorism is worse than ever.
[02:35:42.716 --> 02:35:45.078]  We've had a war on drugs, more drugs than ever.
[02:35:45.378 --> 02:35:47.519]  We've had a war on poverty, more poverty than ever.
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:49.941]  This is meant to not work.
[02:35:50.021 --> 02:35:51.142]  It's meant to get worse.
[02:35:51.242 --> 02:35:53.883]  It's meant to give them an excuse to get more control.
[02:35:55.404 --> 02:35:58.326]  Let's go ahead and go to Wolfgang in Missouri.
[02:35:58.386 --> 02:35:59.087]  Go ahead, Wolfgang.
[02:36:01.648 --> 02:36:02.229]  Hello, Alex.
[02:36:02.509 --> 02:36:02.769]  Hi.
[02:36:02.789 --> 02:36:04.730]  Hey, uh, real quick here.
[02:36:04.770 --> 02:36:05.591]  How about if we put a
[02:36:06.047 --> 02:36:13.274]  A citizen's flotilla together of national militia units can go down there ourselves and deliver water filters.
[02:36:13.814 --> 02:36:20.501]  Well, FEMA would start trying to hold you back, and if you resisted, they would arrest you or try to... they would open fire on you.
[02:36:21.081 --> 02:36:21.462]  Oh, well.
[02:36:21.802 --> 02:36:23.664]  Of course, that would make them look pretty bad, but...
[02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:32.475]  I think there's enough militia units in the country that if we put together our own Navy, we could go down there and turn the situation around.
[02:36:33.015 --> 02:36:45.242]  Well obviously, they're turning boats back because a few gunshots were fired, they turned back thousands of boats of militia, that's what the citizen defense is, and they turned them back and said no.
[02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:48.124]  So Wolfgang, it's a good idea to go down there
[02:36:48.784 --> 02:36:51.646]  Alright, well isn't there more of us than there is of them?
[02:37:08.512 --> 02:37:09.953]  I agree with you, thanks for the call.
[02:37:10.013 --> 02:37:16.555]  That's what it boils down to is that you've got a bunch of degenerate feds who will not let the local sheriffs do their job.
[02:37:16.595 --> 02:37:18.695]  The local sheriffs have tried to do their job.
[02:37:19.356 --> 02:37:24.577]  Even the French tried to fly in planes full of water filters and they said no.
[02:37:25.758 --> 02:37:29.479]  Venezuela is offering free oil and Bush is saying no.
[02:37:30.359 --> 02:37:32.880]  Because only FEMA can save you.
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:35.801]  You've got to learn to worship FEMA and no one else.
[02:37:36.528 --> 02:37:42.851]  Not the evil Frenchies or the evil Venezuelans.
[02:37:43.732 --> 02:37:44.712]  Chavez down there.
[02:37:45.493 --> 02:37:48.154]  Let's go ahead and go to Michael in Illinois.
[02:37:48.174 --> 02:37:48.794]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:37:49.455 --> 02:37:55.478]  Alex, I thought exactly like you did when I watched Bush in his little speech in that hangar with his arms out.
[02:37:55.638 --> 02:38:03.062]  I used to lift weights, Alex, and you'd see these guys walk like they're big apes, like, I'm a tough guy, hanging his arms out, walking up to the
[02:38:04.386 --> 02:38:04.987]  People up there?
[02:38:05.107 --> 02:38:06.648]  I mean, they look ridiculous.
[02:38:06.709 --> 02:38:09.772]  And listen, I walk usually hunched over because I'm always thinking about stuff.
[02:38:10.192 --> 02:38:11.974]  And I'm not thinking about how I look.
[02:38:12.154 --> 02:38:12.655]  I used to.
[02:38:12.735 --> 02:38:13.356]  I don't anymore.
[02:38:13.396 --> 02:38:17.040]  I'm like some weird monk or something hunched over thinking all the time.
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.585]  But yeah, Bush is like this arrogant person with his arms out like a rooster.
[02:38:22.305 --> 02:38:24.326]  I mean, I had a football coach who used to make fun of me.
[02:38:24.366 --> 02:38:29.568]  He said that he could always tell, even from a distance, where I was on the field because I had my arms out like a gorilla.
[02:38:30.088 --> 02:38:31.349]  And I mean, that's what Bush does.
[02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:33.470]  It's like an adolescent tough guy behavior.
[02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:34.450]  Yeah, a real tough guy.
[02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:40.453]  He can't even speak in front of a camera and he can't even look into the camera because he knows he's guilty, Alex.
[02:38:40.473 --> 02:38:42.954]  But here, I want to make this quick point so you can tell our callers.
[02:38:43.534 --> 02:38:50.337]  A friend of mine is from Louisiana and he's up here and he's talked to some relatives that live down in Baton Rouge area.
[02:38:51.753 --> 02:38:53.034]  And Alex, it is right.
[02:38:53.074 --> 02:38:57.478]  That caller a few callers ago, that call from Washington talking about the mayhem that they're not showing on the regular news.
[02:38:57.919 --> 02:39:03.203]  He said he talked to the local news in Baton Rouge is showing things that were not being shown on CNN and Red Fox.
[02:39:03.243 --> 02:39:06.947]  I need people in Louisiana to take this from me, exactly.
[02:39:07.187 --> 02:39:09.509]  Alex, it's unbelievable the mayhem that's going on down there.
[02:39:09.549 --> 02:39:10.630]  And one quick point.
[02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:14.633]  These news people here from CNBC, CNN, all these corrupt newscasters.
[02:39:15.054 --> 02:39:18.557]  Isn't it funny that they could go down there and interview a family that's been ravaged by a hurricane?
[02:39:18.976 --> 02:39:20.597]  But they can get them out of there.
[02:39:20.737 --> 02:39:22.117]  They can get the news people out of there.
[02:39:22.137 --> 02:39:22.758]  Get these people.
[02:39:23.118 --> 02:39:24.638]  The one woman yesterday at CNBC.
[02:39:24.658 --> 02:39:28.220]  She's interviewing a family in Mississippi.
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.161]  And they said, well, how are you going to get your family out of here?
[02:39:30.441 --> 02:39:31.021]  Gee, I don't know.
[02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:34.662]  Well, I saw that lady later today on CNBC, and she's back in the studio.
[02:39:34.682 --> 02:39:37.263]  They got her out of there, but they can't get the family out of there.
[02:39:37.283 --> 02:39:37.563]  Exactly.
[02:39:37.623 --> 02:39:38.604]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:38.644 --> 02:39:39.744]  I was thinking that exact thing.
[02:39:40.185 --> 02:39:44.966]  Folks, everything is basically submerged except for about 20% of the city.
[02:39:45.046 --> 02:39:46.367]  And then you've got all the highways.
[02:39:46.927 --> 02:39:48.588]  You're able to drive on the highways.
[02:39:49.497 --> 02:39:53.039]  And, you know, turn around, and the people could be gotten out by buses.
[02:39:53.799 --> 02:39:56.441]  You just sent buses to random points, you could fill them up.
[02:39:57.121 --> 02:40:07.286]  But the government cowers in so much fear, if some scummy bull... and I'm not saying I'm macho and tough, but I just... when it comes to doing what's right, you just don't worry about it.
[02:40:08.587 --> 02:40:17.712]  I know we could find police that would volunteer, and we've got real men out there, to get on buses, to drive them in there, and if somebody shoots at them, they just shoot back.
[02:40:18.539 --> 02:40:22.980]  I mean, over and over again, well, no more buses allowed because shots have been fired.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.641]  Well, no more helicopters.
[02:40:24.661 --> 02:40:26.822]  Well, no more boats because somebody shot.
[02:40:27.522 --> 02:40:28.462]  So what?
[02:40:29.662 --> 02:40:34.204]  We got women and children that need to be saved by the hundreds of thousands, folks.
[02:40:34.544 --> 02:40:35.604]  It's hundreds of thousands.
[02:40:36.284 --> 02:40:37.885]  And that's admitted locally on the news.
[02:40:37.925 --> 02:40:38.805]  The mayor admits that.
[02:40:40.085 --> 02:40:41.586]  So what if you're getting shot at?
[02:40:43.428 --> 02:40:47.769]  Again, I mean, last night I was tempted to get in the car and drive there, because you can't fly there.
[02:40:47.789 --> 02:40:49.229]  I'm only about 10 hours away.
[02:40:49.890 --> 02:40:51.290]  But I know I'd get arrested, folks.
[02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:52.750]  They are not going to let me through there.
[02:40:54.771 --> 02:40:57.511]  I've got access to a little aluminum boat with a motor.
[02:40:58.191 --> 02:41:02.592]  And I mean, I could probably go in there and get five or six people out and drive them back out and be arrested on the spot.
[02:41:03.513 --> 02:41:04.513]  It's just pathetic.
[02:41:04.533 --> 02:41:06.273]  I mean, the government is disgusting.
[02:41:07.794 --> 02:41:09.194]  Davey in Texas, go ahead.
[02:41:09.984 --> 02:41:17.730]  Yes sir, I got in on your program late so I don't know if anybody's called in on this about the Singapore Air Force flying into Louisiana.
[02:41:19.371 --> 02:41:24.594]  WFAA TV in Dallas Channel 8 had a report last night on their 5 p.m.
[02:41:24.634 --> 02:41:33.961]  newscast Brad somebody was a reporter and they had four or five Chinook helicopters at former Carswell Air Force Base in western Fort Worth and
[02:41:34.944 --> 02:41:43.593]  And they were, belonged to the Singapore Air Force and they had air crews and they'd been training for four or five weeks to build helicopters located to the east and that's where they build their helicopters.
[02:41:43.613 --> 02:41:46.436]  Yeah, I know my uncle from Vietnam was trained on helicopters out there.
[02:41:46.756 --> 02:41:56.746]  And they had requested and it was announced on the little newscast that it had been approved that they can assist in the rescue effort in New Orleans so they had these pictures of the
[02:41:58.968 --> 02:42:02.991]  Well, that's classic.
[02:42:03.031 --> 02:42:06.674]  We can't let the citizens into hell, but we can let the people from Singapore in.
[02:42:07.275 --> 02:42:12.699]  Well, they were already here and we could use the Chinooks, but I could go on for hours.
[02:42:12.719 --> 02:42:14.240]  Well, it's a dangerous precedent.
[02:42:15.313 --> 02:42:21.115]  I don't have a problem with the foreigners bringing us goods or bringing us water filters and stuff, but you set the precedent.
[02:42:21.155 --> 02:42:24.236]  Believe me, they want to set the precedent for foreign troops in here.
[02:42:24.296 --> 02:42:26.016]  Boy, we'll never see the end of it.
[02:42:26.657 --> 02:42:32.739]  I saw a gal locally, her husband's local game warden here in this county, and he's heading out for Louisiana this afternoon.
[02:42:32.799 --> 02:42:33.799]  I guess they're sending some more.
[02:42:34.321 --> 02:42:35.721]  Texas gang wardens over there.
[02:42:36.061 --> 02:42:37.222]  Well that's good.
[02:42:37.262 --> 02:42:42.963]  I mean we shouldn't have so many gang wardens and so many checkpoints and so many telling us how to live our lives.
[02:42:43.263 --> 02:42:46.444]  We should have had the government building levees and dikes this whole time.
[02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:55.986]  I mean think how much energy the government spends just oppressing us and feeding on us and taxing us instead of doing basic stuff like they used to like fixing things.
[02:42:56.726 --> 02:42:59.326]  Well what's interesting is they can shut that whole area down.
[02:42:59.346 --> 02:43:02.787]  You know Louisiana, Mississippi, Louisiana or Alabama
[02:43:03.376 --> 02:43:08.538]  Where supposedly civilians can't get in, and they can do that in two or three days, but they can't shut down the Mexican border.
[02:43:09.699 --> 02:43:10.279]  Good point!
[02:43:10.479 --> 02:43:17.342]  I mean, they can spend billions on borders for Afghanistan and Iraq, billions per country, but we can't control our border.
[02:43:17.623 --> 02:43:18.463]  Okay, I'll talk to you later.
[02:43:18.563 --> 02:43:19.203]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:19.243 --> 02:43:20.024]  Who's up next here?
[02:43:21.424 --> 02:43:23.005]  George in Canada, Toronto.
[02:43:23.305 --> 02:43:23.965]  Go ahead, George.
[02:43:24.306 --> 02:43:25.146]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:43:25.366 --> 02:43:25.626]  Hi.
[02:43:25.826 --> 02:43:27.267]  A couple of points I'd like to bring up.
[02:43:27.327 --> 02:43:29.368]  I agree with you, not just no, but hell no.
[02:43:30.035 --> 02:43:32.800]  And for people who want to help, just use the Nike motto.
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:33.421]  Just do it.
[02:43:33.561 --> 02:43:40.973]  Somehow, someway, you've got to make a way to get these people out even if you find them on the fringes and get them to safety or make sure they have food and water so they're not stranded.
[02:43:41.654 --> 02:43:43.016]  But one thing we have to do before 5 p.m.
[02:43:43.036 --> 02:43:43.337]  Eastern.
[02:43:44.494 --> 02:43:56.843]  Is everybody's gotta lobby their senators, their congressmen, their members of parliament here in Canada, and just get them off their duffs and say we have to just open up the floodgates to get aid, appropriate aid, in their ASAP.
[02:43:56.923 --> 02:44:02.947]  Yeah, for those who don't know, Bush has openly told all these foreign governments that want to give us money and oil, no.
[02:44:03.587 --> 02:44:07.450]  Because he's gotta work little deals first where Halliburton gets a piece of it or something.
[02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:11.373]  I'm telling you, the delay is while they figure out how to make money off this.
[02:44:12.066 --> 02:44:12.707]  Exactly right.
[02:44:12.767 --> 02:44:13.607]  We have a treaty.
[02:44:13.767 --> 02:44:21.933]  I didn't agree with the treaty when it was signed, but we signed a treaty last summer where Canadian troops can go into the United States, American troops can come into Canada in an emergency.
[02:44:22.313 --> 02:44:24.695]  General Hillier, the chief of our defense staff, is ready.
[02:44:25.106 --> 02:44:27.228]  His men are equipped, loaded, and prepared to go.
[02:44:27.568 --> 02:44:29.770]  We're just waiting for word from America to come in.
[02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:33.472]  And that's that mutual American regional deal.
[02:44:33.833 --> 02:44:34.413]  Exactly.
[02:44:34.473 --> 02:44:37.115]  I don't agree with it, but politics have to be set aside.
[02:44:37.155 --> 02:44:39.757]  People are in need, they're dying, and they're dead by Tuesday.
[02:44:39.777 --> 02:44:45.501]  Why don't they just let the local police in, and let the local counties that want to help in from other states?
[02:44:45.561 --> 02:44:46.302]  We wouldn't need that.
[02:44:46.972 --> 02:44:47.592]  Oh, exactly.
[02:44:47.732 --> 02:44:50.954]  But, you know, there's no time for any feelings.
[02:44:51.014 --> 02:44:55.076]  If there's any aid anywhere that can be got to these people, any life you save is another life.
[02:44:55.477 --> 02:44:56.457]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:44:56.497 --> 02:44:57.178]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:57.538 --> 02:44:58.198]  Who's up next?
[02:44:59.859 --> 02:45:01.760]  Joe in Chicago, the Windy City.
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:02.460]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:45:02.641 --> 02:45:03.561]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:45:03.581 --> 02:45:03.801]  Good.
[02:45:04.201 --> 02:45:06.403]  Hey, I don't know if you guys have covered this.
[02:45:06.423 --> 02:45:10.085]  I haven't been listening the remainder of your show earlier.
[02:45:11.095 --> 02:45:19.118]  I just took a look on CNN.com and they've got Mayor Ray Nagin that had an interview with Garland Robinette.
[02:45:19.318 --> 02:45:20.379]  WWL!
[02:45:20.739 --> 02:45:24.000]  Yeah, did you, by any chance, were able to listen to that?
[02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:24.901]  Yeah, we played it.
[02:45:25.241 --> 02:45:25.761]  Oh, awesome.
[02:45:25.821 --> 02:45:26.901]  Alright, I just wanted to make sure.
[02:45:26.981 --> 02:45:28.162]  Well, go ahead and comment on it.
[02:45:28.222 --> 02:45:29.622]  I mean, he's telling it like it is.
[02:45:30.183 --> 02:45:30.823]  Absolutely.
[02:45:30.843 --> 02:45:32.203]  About Bush and all these people.
[02:45:32.224 --> 02:45:36.785]  I mean, they're too busy acting like FEMA's saving you so nobody else can save anybody.
[02:45:37.025 --> 02:45:40.587]  So the people are dying and the mayor says thousands a day are dying.
[02:45:41.227 --> 02:45:42.869]  Absolutely, and it's really interesting.
[02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:55.823]  I'm really glad to know that, I mean, if it takes some sort of a, you know, destruction like this to finally get politicians to finally get above all the hoopla and finally, you know, talk the truth, it's pretty sad.
[02:45:55.843 --> 02:45:56.603]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:45:58.035 --> 02:46:08.682]  I can't stand Scarborough, I can't stand these people, but they're actually breaking down the women on Fox, the people on CNN are like, going, what's Bush's problem?
[02:46:09.643 --> 02:46:27.135]  I mean, they're actually getting, and believe me, it's not scripted, folks, because then they'll go to break and they'll come back and they'll apologize and you can tell they've been griped dead, but people on the ground who are seeing it, their humanity is rising above the pompousness and they see how the government's actually causing the problem
[02:46:27.675 --> 02:46:32.397]  And they're getting angry, and so, again, another example of the government losing control.
[02:46:32.497 --> 02:46:36.638]  They think they can control the situation and can lie to us, and it's not working.
[02:46:37.278 --> 02:46:37.638]  Absolutely.
[02:46:37.658 --> 02:46:40.439]  I mean, have you seen the reporters not going along with the official story?
[02:46:40.999 --> 02:46:46.861]  Um, actually, I've been so inundated with other stuff that, unfortunately, I really don't even watch the mainstream programs.
[02:46:46.901 --> 02:46:49.482]  I just... I never watch it either, and I couldn't believe what I saw last night.
[02:46:49.542 --> 02:46:50.122]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:50.662 --> 02:46:51.422]  Really great points.
[02:46:51.682 --> 02:46:53.483]  And, uh, who's up at... who's first in line?
[02:46:54.844 --> 02:46:55.625]  Esther in Missouri.
[02:46:55.685 --> 02:46:56.325]  Go ahead, Esther.
[02:46:56.465 --> 02:46:57.506]  Oh, hi.
[02:46:57.566 --> 02:47:09.056]  KCXL, our local station here, is loading a truck that will probably be heading down tomorrow, and I just thought I'd throw out there that maybe they ought to have an armed escort.
[02:47:09.376 --> 02:47:12.018]  Well, KCXL is absolutely fabulous.
[02:47:12.438 --> 02:47:14.200]  People really should support that station.
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:15.521]  One of our oldest affiliates.
[02:47:15.941 --> 02:47:20.565]  They're about to get a new, even more powerful radio station, but they need your support.
[02:47:21.475 --> 02:47:22.636]  To do that financially.
[02:47:22.676 --> 02:47:25.056]  I meant to mention that earlier this week, but the hurricane came.
[02:47:25.437 --> 02:47:28.358]  I've been focused on that, and people need to support KCXL.
[02:47:28.738 --> 02:47:30.218]  Give them food, water, stuff.
[02:47:31.699 --> 02:47:36.140]  And yes, they do need some people to go with them to try to deliver that food.
[02:47:36.981 --> 02:47:37.721]  One other thing.
[02:47:37.901 --> 02:47:49.265]  If you were a remote viewer looking down the road, like three to five years, I think you would see that there were oil wells that sprouted all over what used to be New Orleans.
[02:47:51.514 --> 02:47:54.756]  Oh, you think now that it's been destroyed they'll be able to go in and get all that oil?
[02:47:54.776 --> 02:47:58.257]  I think it was destroyed so that they could drill there.
[02:47:59.838 --> 02:48:01.739]  There's a lot of oil under New Orleans.
[02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:04.761]  I think that's the ultimate end of the whole thing.
[02:48:04.781 --> 02:48:09.183]  A lot of other things going on in between, but I think that will... Well, there's also a lot of oil in the Gulf.
[02:48:09.223 --> 02:48:10.123]  They won't let us have.
[02:48:10.684 --> 02:48:13.425]  Well... You know, like 90% of the Gulf's off limits.
[02:48:14.005 --> 02:48:17.607]  Yeah, but they've got to put those fragile rigs out there.
[02:48:18.388 --> 02:48:20.849]  It's a lot more secure to drill on land.
[02:48:22.353 --> 02:48:22.833]  Interesting.
[02:48:22.854 --> 02:48:23.654]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:24.114 --> 02:48:40.127]  We'll jam four or five more calls in on the other side, and we'll continue throughout the weekend to track this as it develops here on the GCN radio network, the Genesis Communications radio network, often imitated but never duplicated, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:40.447 --> 02:48:41.228]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.248 --> 02:48:41.688]  Stay with us.
[02:48:47.299 --> 02:48:50.142]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.402 --> 02:48:51.984]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.324 --> 02:48:57.009]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.349 --> 02:49:01.773]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:02.194 --> 02:49:06.378]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.598 --> 02:49:09.439]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.519 --> 02:49:14.181]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.381 --> 02:49:18.823]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.043 --> 02:49:26.245]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.505 --> 02:49:28.926]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:29.086 --> 02:49:30.827]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:59.521 --> 02:50:03.006]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:03.266 --> 02:50:07.488]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.769 --> 02:50:11.691]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.931 --> 02:50:18.435]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.675 --> 02:50:24.138]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.398 --> 02:50:31.321]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:38.223 --> 02:50:39.404]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:47.395 --> 02:50:53.324]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.564 --> 02:50:55.807]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:56.008 --> 02:51:02.357]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.737 --> 02:51:03.338]  I think so.
[02:51:23.792 --> 02:51:24.292]  We're good to go.
[02:51:51.301 --> 02:51:55.102]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:51:55.122 --> 02:52:01.023]  And we'll be broadcast throughout the weekend, Genesis Programming, and then I'll be back live on Monday.
[02:52:01.043 --> 02:52:04.044]  We'll pick a few final calls here at the end of this transmission.
[02:52:04.064 --> 02:52:14.066]  We should pray for all the people in New Orleans, in Mississippi, in Louisiana, in surrounding areas, Alabama, and we forget a lot of these other towns and cities that have been destroyed as well.
[02:52:15.046 --> 02:52:16.387]  Millions of homeless people.
[02:52:16.467 --> 02:52:18.287]  Millions and millions and millions.
[02:52:19.454 --> 02:52:27.381]  We're talking a million and a half in New Orleans metro, close to a million in other parts of the state.
[02:52:27.441 --> 02:52:28.562]  I mean, it is horrible.
[02:52:28.903 --> 02:52:31.265]  We're feeling it right here in Austin, Texas, where I live.
[02:52:32.159 --> 02:52:35.720]  And again, it was hard to go find a real charity to give food and clothes to yesterday.
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:37.860]  They would say, oh no, we're going to be selling these.
[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:39.241]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[02:52:39.741 --> 02:52:41.861]  We've got a big expose on the Red Cross, folks.
[02:52:41.881 --> 02:52:48.143]  They don't just not give the money you give them, they actually steal mail, and steal food, and steal things.
[02:52:48.403 --> 02:52:50.204]  We have all their convictions posted.
[02:52:50.964 --> 02:52:55.665]  In an article Paul Watson wrote yesterday, it's full of hyperlinks to all the times they've been caught.
[02:52:56.145 --> 02:52:59.706]  You've got to ask yourself, why is the mainstream media only focusing on them?
[02:53:01.556 --> 02:53:04.119]  I mean, they're not doing anything, folks.
[02:53:04.199 --> 02:53:07.202]  Now, I'm not talking about the volunteers who are at low level.
[02:53:07.222 --> 02:53:08.803]  I'm talking about the people who are running.
[02:53:09.924 --> 02:53:11.206]  And we do need your support.
[02:53:11.246 --> 02:53:12.907]  This radio show needs your support.
[02:53:13.708 --> 02:53:16.351]  And a good way to support us is by getting my documentary films.
[02:53:16.411 --> 02:53:17.232]  I've made 12 of them.
[02:53:17.867 --> 02:53:35.461]  I carry a bunch of other books and videos in my bookstore that's on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free to get the videos 1-888-253-3139 or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and see them all online right now.
[02:53:36.441 --> 02:53:37.822]  Joe in California, go ahead.
[02:53:37.842 --> 02:53:39.203]  Hi, how are you doing Alex?
[02:53:39.223 --> 02:53:47.650]  First time caller and I got all your movies and you've changed my life significantly but on the point on yesterday's show you had Scott Stevens, a meteorologist
[02:53:48.585 --> 02:53:50.129]  I thought I'd bring this up to your attention.
[02:53:50.290 --> 02:53:52.476]  There's a bill number 517 in your home state.
[02:53:55.072 --> 02:53:59.975]  Written and sponsored by Senator Kay Hutchinson, called, Weather Modification Operations.
[02:54:00.696 --> 02:54:01.296]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:01.336 --> 02:54:02.277]  Look it up on Google.
[02:54:02.757 --> 02:54:03.178]  It's right on.
[02:54:03.198 --> 02:54:06.080]  Well, I mean, I've got the Pentagon's Owning the Weather document.
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:08.481]  I've got Cohen's own statements, yeah.
[02:54:09.082 --> 02:54:12.644]  It's just, it's frightening and it's sick and I hope that's not what's happened.
[02:54:12.664 --> 02:54:13.665]  I know you've been advocating it.
[02:54:13.685 --> 02:54:17.047]  It looks like, from the evidence, it's a natural... Well, I don't know.
[02:54:17.087 --> 02:54:18.908]  I'm not going to say it's some group.
[02:54:18.948 --> 02:54:24.112]  I mean, weather control is real, but I mean, I'm not just going to go, well, then it's the government, you know.
[02:54:25.475 --> 02:54:29.157]  You know what, that's what makes you the real deal, because you don't jump to conclusions.
[02:54:29.217 --> 02:54:34.500]  I've checked a lot of your documentation, and it's right on the money, and I'm a big believer, and I'm serious.
[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:35.060]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:38.441]  I mean, if we say MI6 carried out the bombings in England, you can bet on it.
[02:54:38.782 --> 02:54:39.702]  You can back it up.
[02:54:39.922 --> 02:54:42.804]  I mean, it might turn out this was weather modification.
[02:54:42.904 --> 02:54:43.604]  I just don't know.
[02:54:43.844 --> 02:54:47.286]  Right, and I know that once you, you know, your sources
[02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:49.111]  Are more solidified?
[02:54:49.411 --> 02:54:50.592]  Should you arrive at that conclusion?
[02:54:50.632 --> 02:54:51.172]  I know you will.
[02:54:51.192 --> 02:54:51.532]  I will.
[02:54:51.552 --> 02:54:52.313]  We're out of time.
[02:54:52.413 --> 02:54:53.993]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:54:54.374 --> 02:54:55.314]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:54:55.374 --> 02:54:55.855]  Go ahead.
[02:54:56.035 --> 02:54:56.675]  In Iowa.
[02:54:56.695 --> 02:54:57.776]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:54:58.016 --> 02:54:58.236]  Good.
[02:54:58.456 --> 02:55:10.663]  Alex, I just want to say that you have a great show, but these people better get educated down there and you need to get that mayor on from Louisiana, from New Orleans.
[02:55:10.683 --> 02:55:11.723]  You've got to get him on your show.
[02:55:12.224 --> 02:55:13.825]  Because that man will come on your show.
[02:55:13.885 --> 02:55:16.046]  Because I know that, Alex, you think you could do that?
[02:55:17.222 --> 02:55:18.503]  We've actually been trying.
[02:55:18.523 --> 02:55:21.645]  It's very hard to even get a hold of his staff.
[02:55:22.045 --> 02:55:31.410]  Alex, I was in the military back in the 1950s, and I was down in Kefla Air Force Base, and I've been to New Orleans many times, and that city's been underwater.
[02:55:31.450 --> 02:55:37.434]  And I remember our Army Corps of Engineers was down at the base, and they were doing all kinds of investigation on that site back then.
[02:55:37.614 --> 02:55:41.216]  And Alex, that's 50 years ago, and they haven't done anything since.
[02:55:41.256 --> 02:55:42.497]  Now, you know you've got to smell a rat.
[02:55:43.237 --> 02:55:44.097]  No, that's a fact.
[02:55:44.117 --> 02:55:44.958]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:45.138 --> 02:55:46.638]  Allen in Texas, last caller.
[02:55:46.959 --> 02:55:47.759]  Sorry to others.
[02:55:47.859 --> 02:55:48.679]  Allen, go ahead.
[02:55:48.899 --> 02:55:49.520]  Alex, hi.
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:58.023]  This is not everybody's favorite topic, but drinking urine in times of emergencies like this, they told sailors at sea to do that.
[02:55:58.403 --> 02:56:02.145]  They used to broadcast over bullhorns to people in earthquakes.
[02:56:02.585 --> 02:56:03.826]  Drink your urine.
[02:56:04.366 --> 02:56:09.268]  If you're not eating food after five hours, it's clear, odorless, tasteless.
[02:56:09.761 --> 02:56:10.702]  We'll save your life.
[02:56:10.742 --> 02:56:15.444]  Instead of three days, you can survive for ten days without water.
[02:56:15.604 --> 02:56:17.986]  Well, that's quite a way to end the broadcast.
[02:56:18.026 --> 02:56:19.747]  Drink your urine, but it's true.
[02:56:19.767 --> 02:56:21.508]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.568 --> 02:56:25.230]  Pray for the folks in the devastated areas.
