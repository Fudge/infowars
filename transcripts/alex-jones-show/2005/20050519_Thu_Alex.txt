[00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:06.099]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.841]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.642]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.123]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:12.744]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.087]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:21.691]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:44.283]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 19th day of May 2005.
[00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:46.524]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:47.164 --> 00:01:04.930]  Coming up in 30 minutes, Len Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com will be joining us to be exposing the new racist mayor of Los Angeles, who might as well be a Ku Klux Klan member, but he's a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan member, made a lot of really disgusting
[00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:16.619]  racist statements over the years with the media just wants to ignore that at least some of the dominant media there are a few mainstream news articles about his unbelievable comments.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.082]  I mean, he said things that make Louis Fairconn look like somebody who loves every race.
[00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:33.926]  And Louis Fairconn has been criticized for some comments that are totally tame compared to Mr. Villaraigosa, the Mecha Commando.
[00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:36.754]  We'll be covering it.
[00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:43.438]  Also, I've had a lot of requests to do this since the 12th of last week when I had that police chief on.
[00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:52.582]  They have police chiefs for the county of Bergen County, one of the biggest counties in New Jersey, saying he's taking the microchip and why we all ought to have a microchip.
[00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:55.923]  And if the government orders us to take it, he'll enforce it.
[00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:03.687]  So in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, I'm going to re-air that, but we'll be live for two and a half hours.
[00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.488]  But again, I've had
[00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:09.356]  Probably a hundred requests in email that I've seen.
[00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:13.539]  Just an amazing response to hear that re-aired.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.781]  And so, we'll be re-airing.
[00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:17.863]  We've had calls into the network asking for it.
[00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:19.284]  So, you want it.
[00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:20.465]  You've got it.
[00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.127]  We're here to serve you and get the information out.
[00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:26.990]  It was an incredible interview and if you missed it, it's coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.268]  So much news to cover.
[00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.870]  I mean, it is really breaking big time.
[00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.395]  Remember a few months ago, a CNN executive said, oh yeah, they're targeting journalists in the Middle East.
[00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:39.937]  And then the Pentagon said, what's your proof?
[00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:41.758]  And then he was told to shut up.
[00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:52.468]  We have a giant archive on PrisonPlanet.com, intentional targeting of independent journalists, where the Pentagon said openly before the Iraq War even started, we will kill journalists that report our operations.
[00:02:53.194 --> 00:03:02.380]  And they've done it in front of journalists, pulled up with tanks, blown up the Baghdad Hotel, killed a bunch of Reuters employees, right in front of everybody, targeting the hotel, targeting the ninth floor.
[00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.663]  And now, a major union head, union rep, U.S.
[00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:12.666]  troops killing journalists, president of Newspaper Guild, echoes claim of ex-CNN exec.
[00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.148]  It's not a claim, I mean, the Pentagon admits it!
[00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:20.491]  But they'll have somebody at CNN retract it, though, and go, oh look, it's been retracted.
[00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:22.572]  This is part of one of their tactics.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.161]  Pretty desperate tactic at that.
[00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:41.546]  I told you a lot of Canadian and Mexican papers are openly reporting that the American border with Mexico and Canada will be liquidated, as well as the border with Mexico and Guatemala, with the Union of American States, Pan American Union, Free Trade Area of the Americas grid.
[00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:44.047]  This is Reuters today!
[00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:47.228]  Experts call for common North American border.
[00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:51.009]  Again, they start calling for it as it's already being set up.
[00:03:52.012 --> 00:03:53.472]  Another glowing article here.
[00:03:53.953 --> 00:03:56.993]  Illegal immigrants can't cash in on American Dream.
[00:03:57.013 --> 00:04:01.295]  That's a positive report out of Madison, Wisconsin.
[00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:02.095]  How great it is.
[00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:03.295]  It doesn't matter if you're felons.
[00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:04.596]  We'll give you free housing.
[00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:07.156]  We'll give you free health care.
[00:04:07.757 --> 00:04:09.997]  We'll give you more tuition than citizens get.
[00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:19.300]  And then the Mechilla-Raza race groups run around screaming that there's some type of rebels fighting the government when the government loves you and created your liberation theology.
[00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:29.500]  So, we'll get into this in this new disgusting swarm group, SwarmTheMinuteMen.com, calling for really terroristic activities.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.462]  Now they're backing off of it, but calling to harass and stalk, basically, the Minutemen.
[00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.183]  Really disgusting behavior.
[00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:42.804]  I mean, according to Bush's definition of terrorism, and he misdemeanors terrorism, so I guess
[00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:46.337]  This could be considered, I don't really call it terrorism, but stalking certainly.
[00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.420]  And they're getting a lot of media attention.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.484]  Despicable, despicable activities here.
[00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:55.329]  Army National Guard who invade the Suncoast, that's the headline.
[00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.610]  It's all coming up after this break.
[00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:57.371]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:09.112]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:14.114]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:19.996]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.779]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:32.124]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:36.687]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.369]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:46.353]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:47.514]  Order online now.

[00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:22.023]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.363 --> 00:06:28.068]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:34.952]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:41.976]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.038]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:46.359]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:02.427]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:06.528]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:07.649]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:12.210]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.611]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:21.873]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:25.835]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:50.151]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:07.802]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:09.623]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.263 --> 00:08:11.124]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:12.725]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:17.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.588 --> 00:08:21.731]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:30.117]  Eight minutes, 27 seconds into this transmission, second segment.
[00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.978]  It is Thursday,
[00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:38.120]  Year 2005, my friends, the 19th of May.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:53.831]  Again, coming up is Glenn Spencer to talk about this incredible racist plan with a tan leader, Villaraigosa, the new mayor of Mechia Land, La Raza Raceland.
[00:08:54.904 --> 00:09:08.678]  I'm just waiting for some major city like Chicago to say, all blacks and Hispanics and Asians out, this is a white capital, go back to Mexico, go back to China, go back to Africa, and to be hailed by the media as a loving good person.
[00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:18.227]  We've played the clips here before of his incredibly racist comments, and it, I mean, again, folks, I don't ever want to hear anybody criticize Louis Farrakhan.
[00:09:19.928 --> 00:09:24.951]  I don't agree with a lot of things he has to say, but overall he just says, stick up for his own race.
[00:09:25.451 --> 00:09:27.772]  Blacks need to take care of themselves, need to stick together.
[00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:29.033]  Hey, that's a good idea!
[00:09:29.213 --> 00:09:30.053]  Everybody should do that.
[00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:33.995]  We all need to keep our heritage, and I'm proud of everybody's heritage.
[00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:40.418]  He has popped off and said some mean things about Jews and white people, but that was years ago.
[00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:45.841]  But compared to Vera Dosa, this guy is nothing!
[00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.026]  And I'm sick of these double and triple and quadruple standards.
[00:09:51.187 --> 00:10:00.295]  And so we're going to be talking about that with Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com coming up here in about twenty-two minutes.
[00:10:01.696 --> 00:10:04.859]  And yes, we'll be taking calls today as well, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:13.647]  We aired about four minutes of Member of Parliament Galloway's comments a few days ago before that whitewash committee
[00:10:14.457 --> 00:10:15.717]  But I've got the full comments.
[00:10:15.757 --> 00:10:22.020]  I've got the demonization that's six minutes with the chairman attacking him with lies and about 12 minutes of him countering.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:32.423]  I'm going to play all roughly 18, 19 minutes of that next hour and comment on it and take your calls on that subject.
[00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:42.007]  Before I get into experts call for common North American border, that's out of Reuters or the Pan American Union, boys and girls,
[00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:48.307]  Before I get into that report, just out of the gates I want to say this because it's important.
[00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:55.372]  You've absolutely got to get Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:57.533]  It is a mini-series.
[00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:03.937]  It is three hours long on DVD, two and a half plus hours, two hours thirty-five minutes to be exact, on VHS.
[00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.378]  It is professionally produced.
[00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:13.874]  We get to New York at the RNC, we show the hover blimps, the sound cannons, the police threatening to arrest us over and over again, smashing people's cameras.
[00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:16.436]  I mean, that's like the first five minutes.
[00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:21.481]  We show you the massive crowds that the media didn't cover, the police attacking people.
[00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:23.963]  We show you the FEMA camp owned by Bechtel.
[00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:27.106]  They put thousands of demonstrators, peaceful demonstrators in.
[00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:30.382]  That's on the first 35 minutes or so.
[00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:37.766]  Then we confront Michael Warren, show how he's a whitewasher, actually helping George Bush by covering up government involvement, not just prior knowledge of 9-11.
[00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:39.587]  He doesn't even get into prior knowledge.
[00:11:41.307 --> 00:11:45.530]  And then we spend an hour on 9-11, unlike any other 9-11 film out there.
[00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.551]  And you know, I don't just make claims, folks.
[00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:50.412]  This is really powerful stuff.
[00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.562]  How they blew up Building 7.
[00:11:52.922 --> 00:11:54.444]  How they blew up Tower 1 and 2.
[00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:56.145]  How they had NORAD stand down.
[00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:57.566]  How they controlled the attacks.
[00:11:57.706 --> 00:11:59.248]  We give you the facts.
[00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:01.450]  There's hundreds of pieces of evidence on scene.
[00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.371]  Witnesses that were told to get back.
[00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.332]  Bombs were in the buildings.
[00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:06.234]  Silverstein admitting they blew it up.
[00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:07.315]  All of it.
[00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:09.296]  You have got to get this video.
[00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:10.938]  Then we spend another hour
[00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:28.645]  On who the Globalist are, who the Illuminati are, how they funded the Nazis, how they funded the Bush, how they control Schwarzenegger, what they're doing, and then we spend ten minutes at the end on the police state and the latest developments there with the grid nationwide and show you the plan for world domination.
[00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:29.886]  It is my tour de force.
[00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:32.728]  It is the creme de la creme of my work.
[00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:33.848]  It is top shelf.
[00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:34.949]  It is a must-have.
[00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:37.110]  Believe me, you need to have it.
[00:12:38.004 --> 00:12:49.294]  And, uh, you can get one copy for $25.95, second copy for $19.95, third copy for $16.95, fourth copy for $14.95, down to 14 smackers when you get your fifth or sixth copy.
[00:12:50.194 --> 00:12:59.342]  Uh, you can get my, the last film I made before that one, American Dictators, which is excellent, documenting the voting machines, the electronic fraud, and how both candidates were controlled and how it was all staged.
[00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:01.163]  We're good to go.
[00:13:21.707 --> 00:13:22.987]  I need your support, folks.
[00:13:23.608 --> 00:13:29.529]  You know, our AM and FM affiliates pick us up and, you know, it's syndicated and they get some of the ads, the network gets some of the ads.
[00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:30.770]  I don't get any of that.
[00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.291]  I've got three full-time employees, a couple other part-time employees.
[00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:37.411]  I'm working all the time.
[00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:46.534]  And when the money doesn't come in, it gets a little bit of a squeeze, to be quite frank with you.
[00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:48.174]  And I don't want to cut back what I do.
[00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:50.355]  We're getting a lot done.
[00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:56.543]  But that's a secondary caveat or addendum or proviso.
[00:13:56.623 --> 00:13:58.724]  I mean, the main reason to get the film is because it's excellent.
[00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.046]  But secondarily, I need your support.
[00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:02.326]  And you know I don't ask for that a lot.
[00:14:02.907 --> 00:14:05.989]  But the listenership's bigger than ever, but I know the economy's falling apart.
[00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:12.473]  And I need you folks to get these films and to make copies of them and to get them out to people and to effect change.
[00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:26.312]  So the toll free number to order my videos, be sure and ask about the specials when you call, be sure and ask about the other videos I carry by other authors, the other books by other authors, the books on tape, just the best stuff out there, I carry it.
[00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:28.533]  Toll free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:14:28.553 --> 00:14:28.733]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:56.818]  Or, you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L A M A R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or order the films via InfoWars.com.
[00:14:57.078 --> 00:15:01.622]  Watch lengthy clips of them, read about them, look at the different specials, and order via InfoWars.com.
[00:15:02.362 --> 00:15:07.687]  They offer safe and secure, highest security level Yahoo shopping cart.
[00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:14.660]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch all 12 of my films, dozens of other films, hundreds of weekly TV reports.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.041]  My TV show is One Best of Austin, by the way.
[00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:18.961]  I've got a real treat for you going up today for members.
[00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:26.304]  And also hundreds of audio interviews, text reports, my films there weeks before they're ever released to the public.
[00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:30.565]  It's been running for over a year now, 14 months, pretty successful.
[00:15:30.585 --> 00:15:31.465]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:15:31.485 --> 00:15:35.427]  Order the films or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership.
[00:15:39.514 --> 00:15:44.062]  And again, our internet bill is about $5,000 a month on top of paying webmasters.
[00:15:44.482 --> 00:15:47.667]  Count all that together, I guess it's about $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 a month.
[00:15:48.288 --> 00:15:50.231]  And my shortwave bill is about $10,000 a month.
[00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:51.594]  We do that as a world service.
[00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.451]  And the water filter is the main sponsor for that, but most months it just pays for about half of it.
[00:15:56.471 --> 00:15:57.231]  I gotta pay for the rest.
[00:15:57.251 --> 00:16:11.575]  I mean, I don't like talking about this, but I do it because I know, I get letters from Africa, letters from Indonesia, letters from Russia, letters from Christian underground churches in China that are smuggled out and mailed from Taiwan.
[00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:14.916]  I mean, I get incredible stuff every day.
[00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:20.172]  Uh, via the shortwave, the great job WWCR is doing.
[00:16:20.192 --> 00:16:23.133]  100,000 watts, super blowtorches, six hours a day.
[00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.854]  But, it's expensive, folks.
[00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:28.957]  And we're not NPR, we're not funded by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation, and the U.S.
[00:16:28.997 --> 00:16:31.458]  government, like NPR is, constantly begs for money.
[00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:32.939]  I don't want your donations.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.120]  I don't ask for them.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.881]  What I ask for is for you to get the films.
[00:16:36.522 --> 00:16:36.982]  But, um...
[00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.854]  Again, quite frankly, I'll probably just end up spending a little bit of money in my bank account to keep paying for everything until it runs out.
[00:16:43.615 --> 00:16:48.719]  The new film sold quite well, but still not enough to continue what we're doing.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.341]  So I need your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:54.104]  And the network also needs your support.
[00:16:54.464 --> 00:17:00.549]  Just the satellites alone, I don't know how many... I mean, one of our digital satellites is like $5,000 a month.
[00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.632]  The stations demand we have high-quality digital.
[00:17:04.112 --> 00:17:05.573]  Bird, we've got a rent from Clear Channel.
[00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.174]  They've got it.
[00:17:07.263 --> 00:17:09.544]  We've got the analog satellites for you out there.
[00:17:09.684 --> 00:17:10.785]  And the network pays for that.
[00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:16.928]  I know Ted Anderson doesn't like to talk about it, but this guy's done stuff like mortgage his house over the years.
[00:17:17.008 --> 00:17:19.249]  He's put everything he's had into this network.
[00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:22.190]  And it's been wildly successful with listeners and affiliates.
[00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:26.873]  But still, you need to support the network because they need your support.
[00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:28.173]  I mean, $7.95.
[00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:32.475]  You get unlimited access to all the archives of all the shows.
[00:17:33.556 --> 00:17:36.097]  $9.95, you get a 16-bit live stream as well.
[00:17:36.883 --> 00:17:40.145]  That and the archives for $9.95, doubling the audio quality.
[00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:41.667]  We'll still give you the free 8-bit stream.
[00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:45.109]  Though I know Ted Sommons has had a $10,000 internet bill.
[00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.251]  It's victims of our own success.
[00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:52.535]  I mean, when you start getting a couple hundred thousand people listening a day on the net, believe me brother, it gets expensive.
[00:17:53.195 --> 00:18:02.502]  So, unlike the other big networks who only have paid streams, we have a free stream, but to try to pay part of that bill, it only pays part of it.
[00:18:02.904 --> 00:18:07.086]  And to pay for the employee that uploads this and keeps the computers running, they've got that system.
[00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:11.748]  And for a little bit more, you get a 32-bit stream and the unlimited archives.
[00:18:12.228 --> 00:18:19.612]  So go to GCNLive.com, GCNLive.com, GCNLive.com, and click on the subscribe page and become members.

[00:18:23.694 --> 00:18:24.294]  I am a member.
[00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:27.696]  Didn't ask them to give me a free account.
[00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:28.856]  I wanted to support the network.
[00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:29.657]  GCNLive.com.

[00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:41.963]  What is that?
[00:18:42.023 --> 00:18:44.885]  Hundreds of hours of radio and good quality audio?
[00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:47.166]  For $19.95, give them a call.

[00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:07.299]  But don't wait.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.502]  I appreciate the stations letting me spend about seven minutes on this.
[00:19:10.722 --> 00:19:14.204]  I don't ever do this, but we can do so much more if you support us.
[00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:17.146]  Support those local stations, too, that carry these programs.
[00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:18.827]  Call and thank their sponsors.
[00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:20.809]  Buy products from their sponsors.
[00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:22.350]  We're getting a lot of new stations.
[00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.370]  Thank those stations.
[00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.251]  If you're a business owner,
[00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:27.119]  Call them and advertise your hardware store.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.405]  Or call them and advertise your golf course.
[00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:31.611]  Call them and advertise your restaurant.
[00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:32.775]  Or your video store.
[00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:38.446]  Tell them thank you, because we're defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:55.733]  Alright, I'll plunge into the latest news and information on the other side, then we'll have Glenn Spencer on, who's fighting the incredible racism of the new mayor of Los Angeles, who he's been exposing for years, and we'll get into Galloway and the Senate, and then we'll also take your calls.
[00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:56.553]  It's all coming up.
[00:19:56.874 --> 00:19:57.454]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.049 --> 00:20:08.933]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.

[00:20:25.443 --> 00:20:27.724]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:20:28.164 --> 00:20:31.226]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:20:31.326 --> 00:20:32.847]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:35.908]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:20:36.148 --> 00:20:40.451]  It's podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:42.472]  It's also money-back guaranteed.

[00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:56.245]  Non-X Nail Gel!

[00:21:54.466 --> 00:21:56.751]  Hi folks, Jack Browner here from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:11.126]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:12.487]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:12.527 --> 00:22:13.127]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:13.547]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:13.587 --> 00:22:16.029]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:17.931]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:19.412]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:22:19.432 --> 00:22:20.993]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:39.743]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:23:51.707 --> 00:23:52.208]  Call now!
[00:24:09.205 --> 00:24:21.730]  Ten years ago, on TV, and then nine years ago on radio, I would read the official government plans to create a Pan-American Union, to dissolve our borders, to merge our social security, law enforcement, everything.
[00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.551]  And that's how the EU started, as a quote, trade deal.
[00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:28.392]  So the public over there didn't know what was happening until it was too late.
[00:24:28.412 --> 00:24:29.653]  Well, now it's happening here.
[00:24:30.273 --> 00:24:33.534]  And I mean, every other day I see a big Canadian or Mexican newspaper.
[00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:36.515]  The Mexicans love it, the people don't, but the government does.
[00:24:36.555 --> 00:24:38.756]  The Canadian government doesn't like it, and their people really hate it.
[00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:46.729]  And they say the end of their currency, the end of their sovereignty, the deals are all being made to do this now.
[00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.131]  Well here's Reuters.
[00:24:50.372 --> 00:24:52.514]  First time I've seen Reuters reporting on this.
[00:24:53.235 --> 00:24:55.277]  Experts call for common North American border.
[00:24:55.297 --> 00:24:59.060]  And of course the task force is the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force.
[00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:03.665]  The United States, Canada and Mexico should establish a common security perimeter.
[00:25:04.315 --> 00:25:04.995]  This is what the U.N.
[00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:07.337]  called for eight days after 9-11 on Nightline.
[00:25:07.357 --> 00:25:07.997]  I'll never forget it.
[00:25:08.518 --> 00:25:08.698]  U.N.
[00:25:08.738 --> 00:25:09.919]  General McKenzie got up there.
[00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:12.340]  I was watching Nightline back when I watched TV a lot.
[00:25:13.021 --> 00:25:15.322]  And he just said, yeah, we're going to have a continental security border.
[00:25:15.402 --> 00:25:17.263]  Not our internal borders, but the outside.
[00:25:17.904 --> 00:25:18.184]  You see?
[00:25:19.197 --> 00:25:24.159]  The United States, Canada, and Mexico should establish a common security perimeter to guard against terrorism in North America.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.642]  A tri-national independent task force sent a report released on Tuesday.
[00:25:29.082 --> 00:25:36.045]  The countries should police their borders together to help border trade, allow easier movement of citizens, and to keep out potential security threats.
[00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:38.066]  That means totally open the internal borders.
[00:25:38.086 --> 00:25:40.447]  Again, that'll be around North America.
[00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:44.789]  From Guatemala, where it borders Mexico, up to Alaska.
[00:25:46.903 --> 00:25:57.931]  And it, again it says, countries should police their borders together to help border trade, allow easier movement of citizens, and to keep out potential security threats, the task force said in New York's Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:25:59.754 --> 00:26:04.075]  If our borders and our two borders, one between Mexico and the United States and the other with the U.S.
[00:26:04.115 --> 00:26:16.557]  and Mexico, become a front line for security, an impact that should have on normal relations and economic relations would be profound, said Co-Chairman John Manley, a former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.
[00:26:16.577 --> 00:26:26.059]  The task force was sponsored by private groups, each of the three countries including the United States Council on Foreign Relations, and there was no indication that governments would act on the proposals.
[00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:28.779]  That's pure poppycock, they're already doing it.
[00:26:29.565 --> 00:26:30.786]  Now, again, this is what they're going to do.
[00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:32.707]  They're going to carry out another terror attack.
[00:26:32.787 --> 00:26:35.790]  Everybody's going to ignore that Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.134]  Then we have the Border Patrol Union Chief a year ago tell us this, and now it's been in the mainstream news last week and this week.
[00:26:41.774 --> 00:26:43.335]  It's all over the country, North and South.
[00:26:43.775 --> 00:26:45.597]  They're ordered to let the illegals walk right past them.
[00:26:45.617 --> 00:26:46.237]  That's their orders.
[00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:53.783]  Just have a few arrests for the numbers, and a few raids of Walmart once a year to make everybody think everything's okay, to grab all the illegals.
[00:26:53.883 --> 00:26:54.784]  It's just, it's a joke.
[00:26:54.844 --> 00:26:55.264]  It's theater.
[00:26:56.608 --> 00:27:01.009]  And, uh, what they're going to do is there's going to be another big, fat, disgusting, murderous terror attack.
[00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:03.129]  They'll kill a bunch more innocent people and their children.
[00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.230]  Murdering bastards that they are.
[00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.330]  Excuse the French.
[00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.251]  And, uh, they'll go, oh, that's it.
[00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:12.391]  We're going to put you in troops as part of a multinational force on the border.
[00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:14.152]  And that'll deal with it.
[00:27:14.372 --> 00:27:16.892]  But the highways, the NAFTA highways will be wide open.
[00:27:17.272 --> 00:27:21.913]  You'll just have to have a transponder and we're just going to legalize all the illegals and make them take an ID card.
[00:27:23.294 --> 00:27:24.874]  So that's the plan and that's what they're going to do.
[00:27:25.766 --> 00:27:32.470]  And it goes on, it actually says, biometric border passes for anyone that wants one, and that's Bush's amnesty plan.
[00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:46.518]  The title of the report is building a North American community, also call for free movement within the continent for citizens throughout North American border, through border passes with biometric identifiers and other measures to increase economic and military cooperation between the countries.
[00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:47.558]  You hear that?
[00:27:47.578 --> 00:27:49.500]  And again, the article goes on more.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.601]  There's no reason, I guess, to repeat this.
[00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:55.463]  I mean, I told you that they're doing this, and this is what's happened.
[00:27:56.129 --> 00:27:57.029]  This is not a joke.
[00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:05.352]  Meanwhile, this is out of Madison NBC 15 News, illegal immigrants can cash in on American Dream.
[00:28:06.392 --> 00:28:08.753]  And it says, you can watch the video report, they're on the site.
[00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:18.316]  Undocumented workers who are taking steps towards citizenship, that means they just issued them a local ID card, totally legalizing them, can now apply for housing assistance.
[00:28:18.517 --> 00:28:22.738]  Again, they're not illegal aliens anymore, they're undocumented workers for housing assistance.
[00:28:23.604 --> 00:28:37.515]  Tuesday night, in a vote of 15 to 4, a majority of the Madison Common Council signed off on a resolution allowing undocumented workers to apply for low-interest housing loans through the city's Community Development Block Grant Program, which they just give to them.
[00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:43.680]  One stipulation, workers must have an individual tax identification number, meaning they pay federal taxes and apply for a loan.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:49.044]  Opponents say city leaders shouldn't condone illegal activity by supporting those who don't follow immigration laws.
[00:28:49.918 --> 00:28:54.381]  But supporters say the idea is supported by HUD, again, federal grants, and the U.S.
[00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:55.742]  Department of Housing and Urban Development.
[00:28:56.102 --> 00:29:01.446]  Yeah, last year, and I bullhorned him, Vicente Fox, a year and a half ago, was here in Austin.
[00:29:01.486 --> 00:29:09.491]  He gave out awards to city council, to the police chief, the police department, to the governor, and to Wells Fargo.
[00:29:09.551 --> 00:29:13.214]  Wells Fargo issues ID cards that the state and local governments accept.
[00:29:14.234 --> 00:29:16.916]  The city is not prosecuting or enforcing on illegals.
[00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:17.957]  He gave them awards for this.
[00:29:18.758 --> 00:29:21.059]  And the Governor is for the Pan-American Open Border.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.861]  I mean, he tried to have a press conference outside.
[00:29:24.921 --> 00:29:27.843]  I went up there and stuck my bullhorn up against the gate and shut him down.
[00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:36.487]  That narco-terrorist blob, he's not even a Mexican by the way, didn't even have a chance to get anything out of his mouth.
[00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:39.969]  I was there with a bunch of Hispanics who were bullhorning him too.
[00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.471]  Going, you're not Mexican!
[00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:43.771]  It was great!
[00:29:44.852 --> 00:29:45.712]  I love it!
[00:29:46.413 --> 00:29:47.033]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.468 --> 00:29:54.492]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:58.076]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.524 --> 00:30:09.009]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.674]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:13.894 --> 00:30:20.941]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:27.427]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:28.788]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.108 --> 00:30:32.069]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.209 --> 00:30:34.150]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:41.773]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:03.902]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.222 --> 00:31:09.146]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:13.769]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:22.977]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.

[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.125]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:39.152]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.633 --> 00:31:40.173]  What about you?

[00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:22.699]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:23.139 --> 00:33:28.883]  We're here live and back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time with two rebroadcasts from midnight to 6 a.m.
[00:33:29.483 --> 00:33:32.945]  So no excuse, any time zone you're in globally, you can catch this broadcast.
[00:33:32.965 --> 00:33:44.991]  We're going to Glenn Spencer, AmericanPatrol.com, who first started out working with Native Americans and their communities and fighting for under-advantaged people's rights.
[00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:47.393]  He then found out about horrible racist groups
[00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.534]  Uh, that just dwarfed the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan and began fighting them.
[00:33:51.914 --> 00:34:00.062]  So we'll be going to him to talk about just these vicious, savage hate groups that are being funded by our government and are hell-bent on destroying this country.
[00:34:00.302 --> 00:34:00.623]  Open them!
[00:34:02.004 --> 00:34:07.910]  Uh, they march around with signs of certain races, uh, with people's heads cut off, saying they're gonna kill everyone, and then the media says it's good.
[00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:09.371]  And I have the video of it.
[00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:11.794]  But that's coming up here in just a few minutes, uh,
[00:34:12.922 --> 00:34:19.244]  After he leaves us, we'll get into the entire Galloway clip where he tore them to pieces about their lies about the Iraq war.
[00:34:19.284 --> 00:34:20.324]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:26.426]  Not just a four-minute clip, but about a 15-minute clip or longer that I'm going to be playing and analyzing.
[00:34:26.566 --> 00:34:28.167]  Mainstream news is reporting on the U.S.
[00:34:28.227 --> 00:34:28.887]  military.
[00:34:28.907 --> 00:34:33.668]  More and more evidence of targeting and killing journalists in Iraq.
[00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.689]  It is all coming up today.
[00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.070]  One little caveat I wanted to add.
[00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.031]  You heard me earlier plug GCNlive.com.
[00:34:43.012 --> 00:34:45.953]  And the archives of all the shows you can subscribe to for $7.95.
[00:34:46.233 --> 00:34:51.576]  For $2 more, $9.95, you get a 16-bit stream instead of an 8-bit stream, the free stream.
[00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.997]  A 16-bit stream, double the audio quality.
[00:34:54.457 --> 00:34:57.598]  Again, most networks don't even offer it for a free stream.
[00:34:57.618 --> 00:34:59.099]  You know, the big ones, Clear Channel and others.
[00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:00.499]  It's subscription, period.
[00:35:00.799 --> 00:35:03.000]  But we still offer the free one because we want to get the word out.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.102]  But we do need support to be able to do that, so go get a membership.
[00:35:06.762 --> 00:35:08.603]  And for even a little bit more money, you get a 32-bit stream.
[00:35:09.904 --> 00:35:12.526]  Which is just incredible audio quality and the archives.
[00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:22.713]  Go to GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645 to get a full month on MP3 that plays in most CD players and all computers.
[00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:26.276]  The entire month of this show or any other show, fuckin' hundreds of hours.
[00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.136]  How many hours is that?
[00:35:27.156 --> 00:35:35.942]  I don't know, twenty-something days of broadcast, three hours a day, I don't know what the... Okay, sixty hours a month.
[00:35:35.982 --> 00:35:36.803]  Okay, thanks for the math.
[00:35:37.749 --> 00:35:38.890]  They're telling me the actual numbers.
[00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.752]  So 60 hours a month of my show, 1995.
[00:35:41.412 --> 00:35:43.233]  And I don't get a red cent of that.
[00:35:43.654 --> 00:35:48.457]  And it all goes to the network to support the websites and what they're doing, and it's a great deal.
[00:35:48.777 --> 00:35:57.404]  And then this network, you hear Larry Pratt, you hear Ron Paul, you hear Glenn Spencer, you hear the Minutemen, you hear Congressman Tom Tancredo.
[00:35:57.484 --> 00:36:01.287]  I mean, all we bring on are activists and patriots and freedom lovers.
[00:36:02.007 --> 00:36:04.891]  People who are fighting the land grabbers.
[00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:06.773]  People that are fighting for our sovereignty.
[00:36:07.073 --> 00:36:08.755]  People that are fighting for the Second Amendment.
[00:36:09.096 --> 00:36:13.301]  We bring them on here and support them and expose you to them and what they're doing.
[00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:16.805]  And that's why we deserve your support, ladies and gentlemen, and need your support.
[00:36:17.365 --> 00:36:24.147]  Alright, so GCNlive.com or 877-376-45 to call and get the monthly CD.
[00:36:24.287 --> 00:36:28.028]  You can get one month or get a subscription for six months, which is a big discount.
[00:36:28.448 --> 00:36:29.288]  I suggest you get it.
[00:36:29.308 --> 00:36:29.448]  877-376-45.
[00:36:29.648 --> 00:36:39.291]  I plugged that again because we were getting calls, people going, I missed that number, I missed that website, because I talk like an auctioneer sometimes.
[00:36:39.311 --> 00:36:40.951]  Alright, going to Glenn Spencer.
[00:36:41.811 --> 00:36:43.852]  Glenn, we have a new mayor.
[00:36:44.808 --> 00:36:46.509]  Uh, who you've been exposing for years.
[00:36:46.529 --> 00:36:49.651]  I know you've got audio clips of his racist comments and his statements.
[00:36:50.512 --> 00:37:00.298]  Uh, we have Antonio Villaraigosa, uh, the Mecha LaRicanquista overlord, the Vader, uh, the LaRicanquista, an attorney general who's a LaRaza Mecha member.
[00:37:00.638 --> 00:37:02.439]  Boy, this is, uh, this is really nice!
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.781]  Well, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:13.586]  It's pretty serious when you, when the United States of America essentially loses, uh, the first territory
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:28.129]  It's always been adding territory, the Louisiana Purchase, the Gadsden Purchase, the Mexican Secession Session, and the like.
[00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:30.631]  We've always been adding territory.
[00:37:31.331 --> 00:37:43.401]  I think history will show that the election of Antonio Villarigosa, his real name is Antonio Villa, Antonio Villarigosa
[00:37:44.198 --> 00:37:48.586]  was really sealed the fate, sealed the fate of Southern California.
[00:37:48.606 --> 00:37:55.798]  Uh, as, uh, it sealed its fate as a province of Mexico.
[00:37:57.268 --> 00:38:00.531]  And Vicente Fox and the President before him have been saying just that.
[00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:03.113]  Are you at a computer with those clips today?
[00:38:04.234 --> 00:38:06.015]  Yes, I can get them, yes.
[00:38:06.475 --> 00:38:09.478]  Okay, well take your time, but whenever you get a chance I want to play some of those.
[00:38:09.498 --> 00:38:13.281]  We're talking to Glenn Spencer, AmericaPatrol.com.
[00:38:14.201 --> 00:38:18.705]  Glenn, I think people are finally starting to realize how serious that
[00:38:19.392 --> 00:38:27.817]  Now this is, before we get to this individual, I wanted to go over the Border Patrol being ordered to stand down.
[00:38:28.178 --> 00:38:29.639]  You've been talking about that for years.
[00:38:30.259 --> 00:38:32.981]  Well, yeah, the Border Patrol is designed to fail.
[00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:36.083]  It's designed to be a speed bump, not a barrier.
[00:38:37.444 --> 00:38:42.687]  And it has been that way, really, ever since Robert Bach took over
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.442]  Uh, in charge of policy and planning in the earthly 1990s.
[00:38:46.562 --> 00:38:48.243]  And he was the former Ford Foundation.
[00:38:48.403 --> 00:38:48.983]  That's correct.
[00:38:49.023 --> 00:38:52.805]  He was, he worked for the Ford Foundation, the people who financed the Open Borders groups.
[00:38:53.285 --> 00:38:54.706]  He worked for them for seven years.
[00:38:54.886 --> 00:38:56.707]  And also before that, tried to finance Chetler.
[00:38:56.727 --> 00:38:57.748]  They're a nice crew of folks.
[00:38:57.788 --> 00:38:58.768]  Yeah, they're very nice.
[00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:00.229]  Always doing nice things.
[00:39:00.649 --> 00:39:00.909]  Yes.
[00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:11.475]  And so, uh, what happened was an Open Borders advocate, an ally, really, of the Mexican government, was put in charge of setting policy for the Border Patrol.
[00:39:12.063 --> 00:39:13.184]  There's no question about that.
[00:39:13.424 --> 00:39:17.267]  Now the head of the Border Patrol is Aguilar, another Laurie Conquista.
[00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.249]  Yes, that is correct.
[00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:31.039]  Aguilar was in Washington for years, came out and headed up the, he was under the tutelage of, worked under the tutelage of Bach and Doris Meisner and the rest.
[00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:36.343]  So if I want to have first class citizenship, do I need to move to Mexico and become a citizen and then move back?
[00:39:36.463 --> 00:39:36.763]  Right.
[00:39:37.704 --> 00:39:40.086]  So he was trained, and so all the people in the highest
[00:39:41.365 --> 00:39:55.415]  Highest levels of management in the Border Patrol are there to cleverly, very cleverly operate it, making the people feel that they're trying to protect the borders, while at the same time, very cleverly leaving it open.
[00:39:55.435 --> 00:40:00.638]  By the way, I've had three Congressmen on the last seven broadcasts, last week and this week.
[00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:01.299]  J.D.
[00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:04.181]  Hayworth, Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, they all agree with you.
[00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:07.783]  They all say it is, quote, new world order, takeover of America.
[00:40:07.904 --> 00:40:08.444]  That is correct.
[00:40:10.572 --> 00:40:13.093]  I was with them in Washington for the Feet to the Fire.
[00:40:13.113 --> 00:40:17.354]  I appeared with the Minute Men at the National Press Club, and we talked, too.
[00:40:17.454 --> 00:40:18.495]  I was on C-SPAN.
[00:40:19.315 --> 00:40:28.018]  I was there with Jim Gilchrist, and I briefed the Americans for Tax Reform, and they have turned around.
[00:40:29.779 --> 00:40:30.639]  I was with J.D.
[00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:31.539]  Hayworth there.
[00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:32.540]  He was on the radio.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.420]  I was on the radio.
[00:40:34.068 --> 00:40:35.349]  I have a question for you, Glenn.
[00:40:35.909 --> 00:40:41.752]  You know, again, 80% of Hispanics I talk to are very patriotic and they're very upset about what's happening.
[00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:44.193]  60-plus percent are against open borders, and that's Hispanics.
[00:40:44.434 --> 00:40:45.914]  It's 80-plus percent of the general public.
[00:40:46.295 --> 00:40:48.736]  But the media keeps acting like this is something they want.
[00:40:49.636 --> 00:40:59.684]  But the congressmen were all agreeing that this isn't even a popular issue, even with Hispanics, but for this racist cadre of Mexicans that they keep putting in power positions.
[00:41:00.185 --> 00:41:04.468]  Why do the Lurican Quista foot soldiers buy that they're fighting the U.S.
[00:41:04.508 --> 00:41:05.429]  government and taking over?
[00:41:05.689 --> 00:41:06.750]  Don't they know the U.S.
[00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.351]  government is funding and financing them?
[00:41:08.871 --> 00:41:10.512]  Yes, they are financing them.
[00:41:10.532 --> 00:41:13.014]  They did in California.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.543]  Uh, when, uh, when, um, uh, what's his name?
[00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:23.143]  I'm trying to think.
[00:41:23.183 --> 00:41:29.207]  It was Lopez, uh, Beat, what's his guy, the Congressman, um, oh gosh, I'm getting old.
[00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:31.909]  But in any case, yes, they do finance these people.
[00:41:31.929 --> 00:41:32.309]  Dornan.
[00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:33.790]  Dornan, yeah, Dornan.
[00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.631]  Bob Dornan.
[00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:38.633]  And he helped get $30 million for this Open Borders group.
[00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:41.395]  And they turned around and turned against him.
[00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:43.096]  And forced him out of office.
[00:41:43.316 --> 00:41:44.337]  These people never learn.
[00:41:45.137 --> 00:41:45.818]  They never learn.
[00:41:46.966 --> 00:41:52.050]  They think that by placating them, by giving them money, they're going to make friends with them.
[00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.270]  What a joke!
[00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:54.971]  What a joke!
[00:41:55.632 --> 00:41:59.955]  And Bush has these people into the White House all the time, patting them on the back?
[00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:02.797]  And you saw what happened out at Baldwin Park!
[00:42:03.993 --> 00:42:30.385]  Well, for those that don't know, basically any time you try to have a, and I mean a mainstream Fourth of July parade with blacks, whites, Hispanics, savage groups run up with huge banners with white people's heads cut off, long-haired, blue-eyed heads cut off with blood dripping, the paintings of it, they begin savagely beating black men, Hispanics, whites in the head with two-by-fours, the cops stand by on video and laugh, the news reporters go, look, there's a fight while the, I mean, you're not allowed a Fourth of July parade in L.A.
[00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:31.845]  or San Diego now.
[00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:33.286]  I mean, folks, we're not joking.
[00:42:33.946 --> 00:42:40.711]  And Antonio Villaraigosa is out spouting off all these racist comments and it's ignored.
[00:42:41.712 --> 00:42:44.794]  Well, did you see what the UCLA Bruins did?
[00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:46.576]  The Bruin Alumni Association?
[00:42:47.677 --> 00:42:49.158]  I mean, they outed this guy.
[00:42:50.499 --> 00:42:59.906]  They showed, if you go to the UCLA Bruin Alumni and show that when he was at UCLA, they have a photograph of him.
[00:43:00.858 --> 00:43:16.465]  Uh, their caption is, Antonio Villarigosa, then Tony Villar, leading a protest to include the communist organization, Comité de Frilos Tres, on the steering committee of the Chicano Study Center, UCLA campus, May 23, 1974.
[00:43:18.406 --> 00:43:22.047]  And Meche's slogan is, for the race, everything, for others, nothing.
[00:43:22.188 --> 00:43:22.948]  That's correct.
[00:43:23.268 --> 00:43:24.388]  Give it to us in Spanish.
[00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:28.090]  I don't know what it is in Spanish.
[00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.331]  What is it in Spanish?
[00:43:30.737 --> 00:43:32.980]  Terry Anderson did it, boy, it was great.
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.724]  I've got it here, but I don't... Here was a guy...
[00:43:41.087 --> 00:43:43.609]  You know, I could probably translate it, but I can't do it on the fly.
[00:43:43.629 --> 00:43:52.795]  Well, Glenn, I mean, you spent your life, before you found out about this, in the 80s, you know, fighting for Native Americans' rights, and, you know, and doing, you know, really some... I spent ten years working with Native American Indians.
[00:43:52.815 --> 00:44:05.164]  Yeah, I mean, so, I mean, I mean, I mean, well, I mean, from your experience with that, what would happen if, if white people started marching around with symbols of Mexicans' heads cut off, saying, all, all Mexicans out?
[00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:06.785]  I guess we'd elect you mayor.
[00:44:06.805 --> 00:44:07.946]  Well, I mean, there would be a civil war.
[00:44:08.806 --> 00:44:09.587]  They would be killed.
[00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:16.611]  But you have to understand, just go to there, you have links on our website.
[00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:18.531]  He never graduated from UCLA.
[00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:19.672]  Never graduated.
[00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:31.915]  Was head of MECHA, and in 1999, his picture on the front page of the Los Angeles Times, with the then president of Mexico, applauding the killing of Proposition 187.
[00:44:33.936 --> 00:44:40.138]  Here, and there was a letter in the LA Times, letter to the editor, that they published on August 8th.
[00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:46.061]  Uh, saying, uh, we know who Zedillo works for, but who does Villaraigosa work for?
[00:44:46.182 --> 00:44:47.363]  Octavio he works for!
[00:44:47.463 --> 00:44:49.104]  He works for the Mexican government!
[00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:53.269]  And he's now, uh, mayor of Los Angeles!
[00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.411]  Which is mostly Mexican!
[00:44:55.551 --> 00:45:03.019]  A one with six and a half percent of the vote in a town of four million people, remember this,
[00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.791]  He got 260,000 votes.
[00:45:06.251 --> 00:45:07.851]  Well, what do you mean, why didn't people vote?
[00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:08.491]  They can't!
[00:45:09.892 --> 00:45:13.113]  The city has been filled up with illegal aliens who can't vote.
[00:45:13.433 --> 00:45:25.556]  So there's a small little group of people, a few citizens, naturalized mainly, who decide the future of the second largest city in the United States, and nobody pays any attention to it!
[00:45:25.736 --> 00:45:29.337]  And the government, federal states, are preparing to let illegals vote everywhere.
[00:45:30.226 --> 00:45:32.388]  They're gonna let him vote in L.A.
[00:45:32.608 --> 00:45:34.269]  Look, look, let me tell you something.
[00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:35.790]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:45:36.191 --> 00:45:38.513]  That city is gone!
[00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:39.593]  You live there?
[00:45:40.134 --> 00:45:41.415]  I live- I was born there!
[00:45:42.057 --> 00:45:42.858]  I grew up there!
[00:45:43.438 --> 00:45:51.484]  That city is now Mexican, and it will never be anything else again until radical action is taken.
[00:45:51.944 --> 00:46:03.392]  They will be so entrenched at every level of the city, the police department, and every department will be filled up with Reconquistas!
[00:46:04.793 --> 00:46:05.573]  Believe me!
[00:46:05.694 --> 00:46:10.417]  And Bush is putting Reconquistas, or takeover, retakeover groups, Reconquer,
[00:46:11.284 --> 00:46:11.685]  Everywhere.
[00:46:12.265 --> 00:46:14.307]  Everywhere he can.
[00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:17.010]  Everywhere he can.
[00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.271]  Part of globalization.
[00:46:18.432 --> 00:46:19.192]  That is correct.
[00:46:19.212 --> 00:46:22.276]  He's sacrificing us on the altar of globalism.
[00:46:22.756 --> 00:46:27.141]  And then you saw, if you saw our feature today,
[00:46:27.737 --> 00:46:41.908]  Jesse Jackson going to Mexico City after a racist comment by the Mexican government, by Fox, that Mexicans are taking jobs not even blacks would take?
[00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:53.757]  What would happen if Louis Faircom was marching around saying, all whites out, with pictures of white people's heads cut off?
[00:46:55.218 --> 00:46:55.639]  Of course.
[00:46:57.979 --> 00:47:07.607]  Here's Larry Elder, a lawyer, a black radio talk show host in Los Angeles, coming out on television yesterday and saying, what is going on down here?
[00:47:08.328 --> 00:47:15.074]  He's marching with MALDEF, he goes with, he goes, Jesse Jackson goes with MALDEF to Mexico City.
[00:47:15.134 --> 00:47:18.617]  MALDEF is an open borders Mexican reconquista organization.
[00:47:19.177 --> 00:47:23.280]  But we've got video of Jesse Jackson marching through the city of Los Angeles.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.022]  Video we took, right?
[00:47:25.766 --> 00:47:30.248]  He's heading up Justice for Janitors, organizing these illegal aliens.
[00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:31.589]  Everybody knows, every one of them.
[00:47:31.709 --> 00:47:33.730]  Thousands of them are in the country illegally.
[00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.690]  What happened?
[00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:40.593]  Those jobs were all held 30 years ago in downtown Los Angeles, mostly by blacks.
[00:47:41.073 --> 00:47:43.114]  And they were making 15 bucks an hour!
[00:47:43.854 --> 00:47:48.976]  They were put out of work by illegal aliens!
[00:47:49.216 --> 00:47:54.979]  They were put out of work and under welfare, and then Jesse Jensen comes down and organizes them!
[00:47:57.347 --> 00:47:59.609]  Well, you've got some of these clips.
[00:47:59.629 --> 00:48:00.630]  Which clips do you want to play?
[00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:08.315]  Oh, well, I mean, you know, the one that really says it all is really Zedillo.
[00:48:08.996 --> 00:48:24.628]  I have proudly affirmed that the Mexican nation extends beyond the territory encroached by its borders and that Mexican migrants are an important, a very important part of it.
[00:48:25.911 --> 00:48:27.252]  You know, that's the Mexican President.
[00:48:27.293 --> 00:48:30.556]  What about the clips you've got where everybody ought to, whites ought to go back to Europe?
[00:48:30.836 --> 00:48:33.979]  Oh, well here's, oh yeah, here's, here's, here's Mario Obrado.
[00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:35.160]  We talking about MALDEF?
[00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:39.865]  This is, this is the, this is the guy who founded it with Ford Foundation money.
[00:48:39.885 --> 00:48:40.446]  Now listen to this.
[00:48:41.893 --> 00:48:45.296]  We're going to take over all the political institutions of California.
[00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:49.819]  In five years, the Hispanics are going to be the majority population of the state.
[00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:57.904]  You also made the statement that California is going to become a Hispanic state, and if anyone doesn't like it, they should leave.
[00:48:57.944 --> 00:48:58.745]  Did you say that?
[00:48:58.885 --> 00:48:59.225]  I did.
[00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:00.906]  They ought to go back to Europe.
[00:49:01.847 --> 00:49:02.247]  Okay.
[00:49:02.448 --> 00:49:03.869]  Now that was, what, three years ago?
[00:49:03.889 --> 00:49:04.609]  Yeah.
[00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:06.470]  And so now the plan's going well.
[00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:10.093]  I don't see why not, but yeah, the plan's going well.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.902]  Here is the co-founder of MALDEF.
[00:49:13.302 --> 00:49:20.849]  MALDEF is down with Jesse Jackson in Mexico City, kissing the boots of the President of Mexico.
[00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:22.730]  He's owned by Chase Manhattan City Bank.
[00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:23.631]  Absolutely.
[00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:32.939]  I want the racists out there listening who are getting off on all this to know you're working for the globalists, the same people that have kept Latin America in slavery, and this is all part of their plan.
[00:49:32.959 --> 00:49:33.960]  You're bringing down America.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:34.980]  I hope you're proud of it.
[00:49:35.361 --> 00:49:35.601]  Yeah.
[00:49:37.082 --> 00:49:37.923]  And now it's coming out.
[00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:50.185]  Now, after all of these years we've been talking about this, trying to tell people about it, now because the issue is joined, now these people are being flushed out into the open.
[00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:56.627]  Well, everybody should see the video where they have the banners they have at most of their marches with white people's heads cut off.
[00:49:56.807 --> 00:49:57.887]  Oh yeah!
[00:49:57.907 --> 00:50:01.568]  They're holding a man's head and his head is cut off.
[00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:03.509]  That's on the front page of an album.
[00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:06.870]  The guy's head is cut off and he's holding him by the hair.
[00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.389]  Okay?
[00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.251]  And the blood is dripping down.
[00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:13.033]  And, um... And they hand out these wires.
[00:50:13.513 --> 00:50:15.315]  You know, the white people.
[00:50:16.676 --> 00:50:20.819]  Man, I mean, boy, and we've been taught, this is how multiculturalism works.
[00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:27.464]  It's meant to neutralize most of the groups, and then they pick a few groups to militarize, and then break the country down.
[00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:27.844]  Right.
[00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.207]  I mean, I'm not going to put up with people that say they want to cut my head off.
[00:50:31.247 --> 00:50:31.928]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:50:33.249 --> 00:50:34.089]  What about you, Glenn?
[00:50:34.129 --> 00:50:36.071]  You know, they do that over at, um...
[00:50:37.441 --> 00:50:38.422]  In the Middle East, don't they?
[00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:42.024]  Well, I'm sick of it, and I'm going to stay... And you know what, though?
[00:50:42.324 --> 00:50:44.785]  The sleeping giant is waking up, isn't he, Glenn?
[00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:45.405]  He better!
[00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:48.387]  Or he won't... He'll never wake up!
[00:50:49.087 --> 00:50:51.288]  You know, die a quiet death!
[00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:52.169]  Stay there.
[00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.669]  You know?
[00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:53.590]  Stay there, Glenn.
[00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.491]  These folks are going to get more and more arrogant.
[00:50:56.171 --> 00:50:59.193]  They're going to punch us too many times in the nose, and they're going to get their behinds kicked.
[00:50:59.213 --> 00:50:59.613]  You watch.
[00:51:01.323 --> 00:51:05.670]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.277]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:14.804]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.844 --> 00:51:16.206]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:22.213]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:29.201]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.321 --> 00:51:31.324]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.684 --> 00:51:42.171]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.311 --> 00:51:47.695]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.428 --> 00:52:04.431]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.792 --> 00:52:13.621]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:13.921 --> 00:52:18.606]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.066 --> 00:52:25.793]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.194 --> 00:52:37.946]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:42.908]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.068 --> 00:52:45.528]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.210]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.715 --> 00:53:02.256]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.157 --> 00:53:17.757]  I think so.
[00:53:39.725 --> 00:53:41.806]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[00:53:41.986 --> 00:53:46.409]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[00:53:46.629 --> 00:53:49.711]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:55.735]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:05.514 --> 00:54:14.497]  Look, I know we've had a load of phone lines since the beginning of the broadcast, and we'll get to Jeff and Andy, or Anthony, and David, and Michael, and Mike, and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[00:54:15.277 --> 00:54:28.262]  There's a lot of other clips, and there's so much coming up in the next two hours, or the second and third hour, but we're talking to Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com, and folks, it's so horrible, you just cannot imagine it.
[00:54:28.282 --> 00:54:29.843]  These people are so self-righteous,
[00:54:30.635 --> 00:54:34.738]  I mean, I've been at, you know, pro-Texas rallies just for Texas independence, nothing to do with race.
[00:54:35.299 --> 00:54:43.105]  And I've had these people in Aztec outfits come up and grab the birthday cake for Texas and spit it out and throw it at us and scream racist stuff, you white honky, go home.
[00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:45.267]  You know, it's just like, man, what is your problem?
[00:54:46.148 --> 00:54:54.194]  And again, this isn't the majority of Hispanics, but it is the leaders of the Hispanics because our government has put them in.
[00:54:54.294 --> 00:54:55.235]  That's who they want.
[00:54:55.575 --> 00:54:56.676]  They want to Balkanize us.
[00:54:58.112 --> 00:55:00.074]  You've got some other clips for us, don't you?
[00:55:00.294 --> 00:55:00.654]  Well, sure.
[00:55:00.674 --> 00:55:03.036]  I've got, you know, here's Antonio Villarigosa.
[00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:11.282]  He's talking about people in the California State Legislature who might oppose or not vote for driver's licenses for illegal aliens.
[00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:15.286]  Because you know what?
[00:55:15.826 --> 00:55:19.169]  It's not enough to elect Latino leadership.
[00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:24.573]  If they're supporting legislation that denies the undocumented
[00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.210]  Driver's licenses?
[00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:28.091]  They don't belong in office, friends.
[00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:29.972]  They don't belong here.
[00:55:29.992 --> 00:55:35.694]  If they can't stand... Alright, he really went off.
[00:55:36.114 --> 00:55:37.895]  So here's the mayor of Los Angeles.
[00:55:38.455 --> 00:55:46.338]  Here's a guy who, with the United States government, just passed a law, the Real ID Act, saying you can't get a driver's license if you're an illegal alien.
[00:55:46.838 --> 00:55:48.459]  And he's the mayor of Los Angeles.
[00:55:48.479 --> 00:55:51.660]  We understand he's now planning to run for governor of California in two years.
[00:55:52.188 --> 00:55:52.368]  Right?
[00:55:52.768 --> 00:55:57.731]  He says the illegal aliens must have driver's licenses.
[00:55:58.112 --> 00:55:59.032]  They must have them.
[00:55:59.472 --> 00:55:59.813]  Okay?
[00:56:00.313 --> 00:56:04.215]  Now, we have Angel Gutierrez.
[00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:06.717]  Here is a leader of the Hispanic community.
[00:56:08.057 --> 00:56:14.001]  We cannot, we will not, and we must not be made illegal in our own homeland!
[00:56:14.795 --> 00:56:20.436]  We are not immigrants that came from another country to another country.
[00:56:20.856 --> 00:56:27.638]  We are migrants free to travel the length and breadth of the Americas because we belong here!
[00:56:28.278 --> 00:56:30.539]  We're indigenous people from here!
[00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:32.999]  We need no passports!
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:42.782]  And that fits in nicely to the UN plan of no borders to drive down the wages which the globalists want, which you idiots play into.
[00:56:42.802 --> 00:56:43.502]  That's correct.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:50.062]  Art Card is the head of the California Democratic Party right now.
[00:56:50.642 --> 00:56:54.903]  This is what he said about Proposition 187 when it was passed ten years ago.
[00:56:55.884 --> 00:57:02.806]  Remember, 187 is the last gasp of white America in California.
[00:57:03.826 --> 00:57:06.887]  And the last gasp of white America in California.
[00:57:07.127 --> 00:57:11.529]  He is presently the head of the California Democratic Party.
[00:57:12.091 --> 00:57:14.012]  And he has said many things similar to that.
[00:57:14.032 --> 00:57:20.115]  But if whites are so bad, I mean, I've noticed all these Lorican Quistas don't mind having white girlfriends.
[00:57:21.255 --> 00:57:21.576]  Oh, no.
[00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:21.976]  No.
[00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:23.557]  There's no problem with that.
[00:57:24.357 --> 00:57:26.218]  I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out.
[00:57:27.719 --> 00:57:38.904]  Well, you know, Armando Navarro, who is a leading advocate for the Hispanic community, he is a professor
[00:57:39.768 --> 00:57:41.189]  I don't know.
[00:57:56.793 --> 00:57:58.374]  Ladies and gentlemen, what this means is a transfer of power.
[00:57:58.394 --> 00:57:58.815]  It means control.
[00:57:58.835 --> 00:57:59.736]  It means who's going to influence.
[00:57:59.756 --> 00:58:06.361]  Only when young people and the people are now moving to the American agenda for the 21st century, they're going to be in a position to really make the promise of what the Chicano movement is all about in terms of self-determination, in terms of empowerment, even in terms of an idea of an asylum.
[00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:20.901]  Okay.
[00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:23.103]  A nation, an idea of Aslan, I believe he said?
[00:58:23.123 --> 00:58:23.543]  That's right.
[00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:28.126]  Even in terms of an idea of an Aslan, their own nation, their own separate country.
[00:58:28.626 --> 00:58:33.170]  Now, what does Mecha mean?
[00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.091]  It's the student movement of the students of Aslan.
[00:58:36.492 --> 00:58:38.653]  Now, who was Antonio Villarigosa?
[00:58:38.993 --> 00:58:41.875]  He was head of the Mecha group at UCLA.
[00:58:42.356 --> 00:58:47.799]  And the foundation that funded Adolf Hitler funds him.
[00:58:47.839 --> 00:58:48.580]  Why is that?
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.080]  Stay there.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.560]  Stay there.
[00:58:51.282 --> 00:58:51.802]  Hello, folks!
[00:58:57.605 --> 00:58:58.246]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.906 --> 00:58:59.967]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.687 --> 00:59:01.808]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.428 --> 00:59:03.269]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.009 --> 00:59:04.910]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:09.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.752 --> 00:59:13.835]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.828 --> 00:59:21.736]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number two of this live Thursday, May 19, 2005 edition.
[00:59:22.577 --> 00:59:27.363]  Coming up, we're going to get into the Iraq War and the full text of the opening statement.
[00:59:27.403 --> 00:59:28.444]  We only heard four minutes of it.
[00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:29.205]  It's about 12, 14 minutes long.
[00:59:30.659 --> 00:59:39.406]  uh... with uh... member of parliament Galloway uh... exposing the lies of these uh... committees uh... on the oil for food program.
[00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:41.807]  First we'll take your calls though in the next segment.
[00:59:42.108 --> 00:59:48.773]  Get the calls you've been holding for time immemorial uh... through uh... first but uh... expert calls for common North American border.
[00:59:49.133 --> 00:59:49.913]  This is Reuters.
[00:59:50.354 --> 00:59:57.459]  Council on Foreign Relations calls for merging with Canada and Mexico and not having borders and having a security perimeter around the North American continent.
[00:59:57.799 --> 01:00:07.421]  This is all part of the plan, and the racist LaRika Kiska is now with the former head of METCHA, for the race, everything, for others, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:00:07.981 --> 01:00:14.042]  That's their motto, and I mean, it just shows the double standard here, and it's got to be exposed.
[01:00:14.442 --> 01:00:17.463]  Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com, we've got about three or four minutes left.
[01:00:17.783 --> 01:00:18.943]  What are your closing comments?
[01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:23.824]  Well, I think that this is now bubbling to the surface with such force,
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:30.803]  That the mainstream media are going to be unable to keep a lid on it as they have for 10 to 15 years.
[01:00:31.483 --> 01:00:38.847]  And when it finally surfaces, it's going to be, it's going to happen with such a vengeance, it's going to blindside the American people.
[01:00:39.627 --> 01:00:45.490]  I see some very serious and very hard, hard days ahead for the American people, especially in the Southwest.
[01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:51.233]  American Border Patrol worked with the Minutemen here, by the way, and gave them support.
[01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:52.974]  We were with them in Washington when we went back.
[01:00:54.142 --> 01:01:00.768]  We will be supporting Friends of the Border in August out on the San Diego border with Jim Gilchrist and others.
[01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:07.554]  And we will be out there with our UAV, our manned aerial vehicle, and our ground control station.
[01:01:08.214 --> 01:01:18.944]  But stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show because this is going to be one of the only avenues where you'll really be able to find the truth and get the truth about what's really going on.
[01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:23.091]  Well, I mean, Glenn, I've gone out and bullhorned the Klan.
[01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:25.153]  I've gone and protested the Aryan Nations.
[01:01:25.173 --> 01:01:27.595]  I mean, I did that, you know, six, seven years ago, quite a few times.
[01:01:27.835 --> 01:01:29.296]  And I will stand up against this group.
[01:01:29.496 --> 01:01:30.417]  They're more organized.
[01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:31.998]  They're much more dangerous.
[01:01:32.218 --> 01:01:33.659]  And they've got the support of our government.
[01:01:33.679 --> 01:01:43.207]  And isn't it vital to have the wonderful, patriotic Hispanics, who are just as American as you or I, or even more so, who are outraged by this, to stand up and speak out?
[01:01:43.487 --> 01:01:44.808]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:44.948 --> 01:01:47.570]  And, you know, we're beginning to see this more and more.
[01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:55.654]  We're beginning to see Hispanics take a position of leadership, and we're really delighted to see that.
[01:01:56.174 --> 01:02:01.136]  You know, the group out in California is headed up by Andy Ramirez.
[01:02:01.816 --> 01:02:09.279]  He's the chairman of the Friends of the Border Patrol, and we're going to be working with Andy and Jim Gilchrist out standing on the border this August.
[01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:15.181]  I mean, what are you supposed to do when a group comes in and says, this is our country, we don't like you, leave, and we're going to kill you?
[01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:16.722]  I mean, what are you supposed to do, folks?
[01:02:17.446 --> 01:02:19.207]  And the globalists are behind this!
[01:02:19.247 --> 01:02:24.349]  Do you remember we're a nation of laws and that we insist that our government enforce those laws?
[01:02:25.649 --> 01:02:29.931]  Do you think it really has hurt them badly that it's come out that Bush is ordering stand down on the border?
[01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:31.731]  I think it did.
[01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.912]  We were the ones who broke that story, by the way.
[01:02:34.192 --> 01:02:37.654]  If you look at the website, that was our rumor mill first.
[01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:40.175]  And it's now confirmed by 12 Border Patrol agents.
[01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:43.836]  What about that disgusting billboard declaring California Mexico?
[01:02:44.764 --> 01:02:46.145]  That's right.
[01:02:46.185 --> 01:02:48.105]  This is Los Angeles is Mexico.
[01:02:48.145 --> 01:02:50.146]  Well, you know, there's some truth in that now.
[01:02:50.886 --> 01:02:51.507]  I believe it is.
[01:02:51.527 --> 01:02:56.669]  I believe there are more... Mexico, the Mexican government will have more of an influence.
[01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:57.909]  What was it?
[01:02:57.929 --> 01:02:58.769]  69 of those suckers?
[01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:59.490]  Those billboards?
[01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:00.430]  Yes.
[01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.650]  No, 75.
[01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:01.791]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:05.832]  75 billboards saying that Los Angeles was now part of Mexico.
[01:03:06.573 --> 01:03:11.174]  And it was confirmed with the election of Antonio Villarigosa, who reports directly to Mexico City.
[01:03:11.514 --> 01:03:12.555]  I mean, folks!
[01:03:13.858 --> 01:03:18.000]  And George Bush is a good conservative, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Planet 12.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:31.748]  Well, as you know, before the war in Iraq started, I went on national television and said, here we are about to attack a country that is no direct threat to us, but every night we're being invaded by thousands of people who think this is their land.
[01:03:32.648 --> 01:03:37.331]  Border Patrol, AmericanBorderPatrol.com, people need to go there and support you.
[01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.591]  What's the toll-free number, Glenn?
[01:03:38.751 --> 01:03:39.252]  Well, we're at 1-800-600-8642.
[01:03:42.729 --> 01:03:42.829]  1-800-600-8642.
[01:03:42.849 --> 01:03:47.032]  Be happy to talk to you.
[01:03:47.292 --> 01:03:50.294]  Well, you've started bushfires in the minds of men and women, and God bless you.
[01:03:50.414 --> 01:03:50.995]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:51.275 --> 01:03:52.756]  We'll be right back with some other key news.
[01:03:53.176 --> 01:03:54.657]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.877 --> 01:03:57.959]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.099 --> 01:04:02.022]  One look in the mirror, and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.062 --> 01:04:06.305]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:10.408]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.528 --> 01:04:12.349]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.569 --> 01:04:16.010]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:20.572]  Medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:23.793]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.953 --> 01:04:26.814]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.315 --> 01:04:33.437]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:37.762]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.581]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:58.701 --> 01:05:01.582]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:01.662 --> 01:05:08.384]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.564 --> 01:05:11.565]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:11.765 --> 01:05:14.186]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:22.189]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:33.774]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:41.678]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:52.017 --> 01:05:57.422]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[01:05:57.562 --> 01:06:05.870]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.712]  More than likely, this includes you.
[01:06:07.892 --> 01:06:10.995]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.
[01:06:11.255 --> 01:06:24.368]  Mother Earth Minerals specializes in providing the primary building blocks for nutritional supplementation, including liquid, water-soluble, elemental mineral suspensions contain the essential nutrients required for the proper function of muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and organs.

[01:06:53.923 --> 01:06:59.905]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.385 --> 01:07:06.466]  There is so much incredible news on getting rid of the borders, the Pan-American Union, on the economy, on the Iraq War.
[01:07:08.147 --> 01:07:08.867]  It's just crazy.
[01:07:08.907 --> 01:07:10.027]  But callers have been holding.
[01:07:10.047 --> 01:07:11.988]  I haven't taken any calls yet because I had a guest on.
[01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:16.869]  Let's just get the callers that have been holding for an hour on.
[01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:17.749]  Let's do it quickly.
[01:07:18.389 --> 01:07:19.450]  Jeff in mass.
[01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:20.150]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:07:21.929 --> 01:07:22.209]  Hello?
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.090]  Yes, Jeff.
[01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.710]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.452]  Yeah, this is Jeff from Chelsea.
[01:07:25.492 --> 01:07:29.414]  Yeah, the illegals like the brown shirt in the U.S.
[01:07:29.815 --> 01:07:32.537]  You know what happened to the brown shirts the night of the Long Night?
[01:07:32.577 --> 01:07:34.178]  That's right, the globalists are using them.
[01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:42.304]  Oh, they're going to have a counter-swing against it, probably in five, ten years, and then have a total police state to stop it, and there'll be huge deportations.
[01:07:42.344 --> 01:07:43.865]  Oh, yeah, the globalists are controlling it.
[01:07:44.324 --> 01:07:45.224]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.264 --> 01:07:51.006]  Regardless of what color you are, if you love your children, you've got to be against all the policies of this federal government.
[01:07:51.466 --> 01:08:03.929]  Yes, and I also have a contribution, too, which is up in Massachusetts we have a large Brazilian illegal immigration up in the Framingham area, and the organization... Hardcore gangs, aren't they?
[01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:06.430]  Oh yeah, and Hispanic gangs, too.
[01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.170]  Also, too, in my area,
[01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:16.000]  There's an organization called MCIR, the Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.321]  Can I give out the website address?
[01:08:17.341 --> 01:08:17.501]  Sure.
[01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:18.281]  Yes.
[01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:22.503]  www.massimmigration.com.
[01:08:22.563 --> 01:08:24.244]  And with your permission, can I give out the phone number?
[01:08:24.264 --> 01:08:25.525]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:08:25.885 --> 01:08:26.085]  Okay.
[01:08:26.105 --> 01:08:26.165]  781-340-5429.
[01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.606]  That's up in the northeast area of Massachusetts.
[01:08:33.536 --> 01:08:37.158]  So your area is not the only area that's getting... Sir, you don't know.
[01:08:37.318 --> 01:08:39.359]  There's 30 million illegals here!
[01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:40.439]  Yeah!
[01:08:40.459 --> 01:08:45.241]  30 million and there's over a couple million each year, over a million illegal.
[01:08:45.281 --> 01:08:45.922]  Thanks for the call.
[01:08:45.942 --> 01:08:46.482]  No problem.
[01:08:46.742 --> 01:08:47.503]  Great points, Jeff.
[01:08:47.683 --> 01:08:48.863]  And look, I'm going to say this again.
[01:08:50.144 --> 01:08:51.724]  I am sick of little reconquises.
[01:08:51.744 --> 01:08:54.826]  We're always talking about Latin America because that's like 80% of the immigrants.
[01:08:56.559 --> 01:09:00.503]  And you know, when the Chinese come here, except for the Chinese triad gangs, they're pretty bad.
[01:09:00.523 --> 01:09:03.747]  They don't say, this is our country, we're not Americans, we want to kill you.
[01:09:04.788 --> 01:09:10.694]  You know, the Russians and others, I mean, they're just not as aggressive.
[01:09:11.539 --> 01:09:20.886]  But the bottom line is they drive the wages down and the government, that's for the gun control, that's for all of these bad policies, that's for the war, they also support this.
[01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:27.631]  So I'm tired of the Lurican Quistas and the Brown Berets, that's a group of the Mecha people that march around the Southwest.
[01:09:29.153 --> 01:09:30.173]  Very racist group.
[01:09:30.954 --> 01:09:32.595]  They're always claiming they're fighting the U.S.
[01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:33.016]  government.
[01:09:33.576 --> 01:09:34.437]  Baloney!
[01:09:35.357 --> 01:09:37.459]  You know, like, oh, we're some type of revolutionaries.
[01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:38.300]  No, you're not!
[01:09:38.996 --> 01:09:40.417]  You're disgusting is what you are.
[01:09:40.937 --> 01:09:41.797]  And I'm sick of you.
[01:09:42.438 --> 01:09:45.599]  You don't intimidate me, and I'm not afraid to stand up against you.
[01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:46.460]  You're the racist.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.842]  And, uh, you know, you keep pushing, you're gonna get exposed.
[01:09:50.942 --> 01:09:51.702]  You don't worry.
[01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:53.303]  You just keep going.
[01:09:53.983 --> 01:09:56.404]  You're gonna be caught between the American people and the New World Order.
[01:09:56.645 --> 01:09:58.105]  And the New World Order's gonna turn on you.
[01:09:58.145 --> 01:09:58.786]  You watch.
[01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:00.526]  This is what they do.
[01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:03.728]  So, look, my best friend's Hispanic.
[01:10:04.682 --> 01:10:09.783]  A person I like to hang out with when I every once in a while get to go mountain biking or playing baseball or something.
[01:10:13.224 --> 01:10:17.185]  Bottom line, he knows about this stuff.
[01:10:18.745 --> 01:10:25.706]  Again, I don't care what color you are, but you go around shooting your mouth off about how I'm bad and how you're going to kill me, you're going to get big trouble.
[01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:26.526]  You understand me?
[01:10:27.047 --> 01:10:28.627]  You're going to get big trouble.
[01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:30.627]  You're going to get big time resistance.
[01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:33.548]  Let's talk to Anthony in Louisiana.
[01:10:33.588 --> 01:10:34.248]  Anthony, go ahead.
[01:10:35.069 --> 01:10:43.315]  Hi Alex, what do you think the influence of Operation Mockingbird has on the free press now?
[01:10:45.450 --> 01:11:09.575]  Well, Mockingbird came out in the 70s, declassified the congressional hearings, the church committee and others looked at it, and it was the CIA controlling and paying key editors and key newsrooms and TV and print around the country, and now it's not even really run- some of it's run by the CIA and the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence, which admittedly three years ago said, we're going to plant fake news stories and lie to you for your own good, that way when they get caught they say, well, we told you.
[01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:20.118]  But now it's just $240-something million for one program, one propaganda piece, fake newscasts that they paid local news stations to air that were packaged as news.
[01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:22.381]  And that's been going on for a long time.
[01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:23.443]  Now it's pandemic.
[01:11:24.304 --> 01:11:27.746]  Okay, there's a couple points of irony, I guess.
[01:11:28.126 --> 01:11:42.293]  It was George Bush Sr., who in 1976, when he assumed control of the CIA, he publicly, I'm not saying he really did it, but he publicly said that Operation Mockingbird was going to stop the CIA from being allowed to do that anymore, blah blah blah.
[01:11:42.413 --> 01:11:43.214]  That's because they got caught.
[01:11:43.454 --> 01:11:49.697]  Okay, but the other point of irony is that, of all things, you cite George Orwell a lot,
[01:11:50.157 --> 01:11:53.740]  But it was the Office of Policy Coordination, which was a subset of Mockingbird.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.161]  Where he worked for the BBC.
[01:11:55.361 --> 01:12:07.329]  Who, in 1954, arranged the funding of a Hollywood production called Animal Farm to be shown in theaters as a step to, like, make us fight the commies.
[01:12:07.609 --> 01:12:16.255]  So it's odd that you cite 1984, but that you use the same guy to make us think, you know, that we should fight... Well, do you know about... I mean, do you know the history of Eric Blair?
[01:12:17.036 --> 01:12:17.396]  No, sir.
[01:12:17.937 --> 01:12:19.518]  That's George Orwell's real name.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.123]  I'll tell you what, so there's not a bunch of background noise, put Andy on hold, and I'll comment on this for two minutes, then I'll go back to him and let him comment.
[01:12:27.884 --> 01:12:29.484]  Stay there, not Andy, Anthony.
[01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:32.826]  Okay, it's odd that I source Eric Blair.
[01:12:35.147 --> 01:12:38.909]  The government can take anything and throw it in our face and spin it.
[01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:46.914]  And back in the 1950s, we had a lot of better people in our government that were doing some good things.
[01:12:46.954 --> 01:12:47.814]  That's how they started.
[01:12:48.194 --> 01:12:50.795]  Oh, we're going to have propaganda because we're fighting the evil commies.
[01:12:51.275 --> 01:12:53.756]  That gets our government used to thinking about propaganda.
[01:12:54.076 --> 01:13:04.981]  Then once you get them accepting to propagandize, then you slowly twist them over to the dark side, if you will, to just flat-out lying and pushing about agenda using propaganda.
[01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.762]  Now, what is propaganda?
[01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.923]  I mean, there's different terms for it, but anything could be called propaganda.
[01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:17.412]  Eric Blair, a man named George Orwell, was born in England when he was about, I don't know, ten years old.
[01:13:17.452 --> 01:13:18.273]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:13:18.313 --> 01:13:20.295]  I've read his memoirs and read several books about him.
[01:13:20.415 --> 01:13:21.035]  I really like him.
[01:13:22.517 --> 01:13:26.020]  He moved to India, and his father was a bureaucrat there.
[01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:30.043]  And he was a member of the British Police.
[01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:38.230]  And then he got into the British Secret Police, and he was there at executions of people, and arrests, and torture, and he wrote about that.
[01:13:40.539 --> 01:13:47.641]  And, uh, you know, other little side tales about having to kill a mad elephant in the town square, and, you know, he wrote an article called To Kill an Elephant, and stuff like that.
[01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:53.962]  Then he thought, oh my gosh, imperialism is bad and evil, I'm going to rebel, I'm going to join the communists.
[01:13:54.522 --> 01:14:03.224]  So he went during the 1930s, during the Franco-Spanish Civil War, where the Nazis were taking over the country, headed up by Franco,
[01:14:05.135 --> 01:14:10.876]  And he fought with the Communists, along with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Communists from the U.S.
[01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.436]  He was shot in the throat.
[01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:16.457]  Amazing battlefield stories.
[01:14:16.797 --> 01:14:22.498]  He noticed how the Communists were all corrupt and were arresting each other and screwing each other out of money.
[01:14:22.578 --> 01:14:24.959]  And he figured out Communism was controlled.
[01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.879]  So they thought, well, I'll go join the Empire to fight Nazism.
[01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:31.560]  So he went and worked for the BBC in Propaganda Division.
[01:14:33.274 --> 01:14:54.572]  uh... in strategic influence and uh... then he found out that our government was funding the communist and then he wrote nineteen eighty four to explain that how basically uh... the the east asia eurasia that the airstrip one that's the anglo-american establishment uh... oceania written in the u.s.
[01:14:55.632 --> 01:15:00.837]  uh... that it was all staged you know in the book they carry out terror attacks daily in the city of london
[01:15:01.551 --> 01:15:05.133]  In airstrip one, command base, to scare the public.
[01:15:05.153 --> 01:15:09.195]  Black helicopters, the book opens with a dark blue helicopter flying around scanning through your walls.
[01:15:09.815 --> 01:15:10.736]  Everything watches you.
[01:15:10.776 --> 01:15:14.357]  Microphones are in the street corners, like we have now under federal grants.
[01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:17.139]  We have articles today going in everywhere by the hundreds of thousands as we speak.
[01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:19.640]  Hundreds of thousands in some cities alone.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.621]  And just all of this.
[01:15:22.642 --> 01:15:26.984]  So, there's a lot of evidence that he didn't die of tuberculosis, that he was poisoned.
[01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:29.405]  Now, that's what happened.
[01:15:29.844 --> 01:15:35.148]  He was a secret police officer, policeman, he was a communist front-line fighter, he then worked in propaganda.
[01:15:35.828 --> 01:15:40.491]  For a while he decided to be homeless, even though he had some money, and went and lived as a homeless person for a few years.
[01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:43.533]  He experienced that, being locked up in debtor prisons.
[01:15:43.593 --> 01:15:44.834]  I mean, the guy really lived.
[01:15:45.695 --> 01:15:47.336]  In his short life, fifty-something years.
[01:15:47.996 --> 01:15:53.360]  And he died one year after, less than one, nine, ten months after publishing, 1984.
[01:15:54.961 --> 01:15:56.662]  And he reversed those numbers.
[01:15:56.702 --> 01:15:57.623]  He believed that
[01:15:58.925 --> 01:15:59.785]  Because that's when he published it, 1948.
[01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:03.066]  Alright?
[01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:08.968]  And, uh, so people can look at Huxley and, uh, work that was written in 1933.
[01:16:09.968 --> 01:16:13.609]  And Huxley gave a speech before he died in 62 at Berkeley that I've aired here before.
[01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:14.669]  You can find it online.
[01:16:15.049 --> 01:16:19.870]  Where he said, look, by 2000 they're going to have us all forcibly drugged, uh, with microchips in our brains.
[01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:24.672]  He says, I've been to the government laboratories in England where they're already putting wires into people's brains.
[01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:26.052]  You know, he was a good guy.
[01:16:26.641 --> 01:16:35.788]  So you can say, well, since the governments have used us to go, oh look, the Soviets are like this, to demonize them, well, now you can show it and show our own government.
[01:16:37.449 --> 01:16:53.181]  So that propaganda they used in the 50s and 60s, Animal Farm in 84 to expose the communists, which was predominantly exposing the Soviet regime, he was exposing communists at that time, Orwell was, now that can backfire on our own government showing how they're creating that system.
[01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:57.327]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:16:58.228 --> 01:16:59.329]  Anthony, go ahead and finish up.
[01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.533]  Yeah, it's just odd that he worked in propaganda.
[01:17:03.593 --> 01:17:08.677]  I have read his stories like Killing an Elephant about his experiences in India.
[01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:12.000]  Alright, yeah, and just one last thing.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.862]  I researched Alberto Gonzales.
[01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:17.536]  I mean, he's not a LaRosa member, per se.
[01:17:17.936 --> 01:17:24.326]  All they actually did that I could find was send him a congratulatory note upon his... That's wrong.
[01:17:24.466 --> 01:17:26.950]  It's been mentioned that he was a member of MACHA.
[01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:29.911]  Okay, can you post that?
[01:17:30.011 --> 01:17:31.532]  Yeah, it's been posted.
[01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:32.993]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:33.814 --> 01:17:34.754]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:17:34.854 --> 01:17:40.198]  I mean, Alberto Gonzales is for 12-year-olds not having to tell their parents when they're going to have an abortion.
[01:17:40.758 --> 01:17:43.780]  Alberto Gonzales says he wants more than just the assault weapons ban.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.743]  He, in his heart, believes in more gun control because his brother is a SWAT team leader in Houston.
[01:17:49.143 --> 01:17:50.684]  I mean, just don't give me that, okay?
[01:17:51.725 --> 01:17:54.547]  I mean, I don't mind you disagreeing with me on stuff, but that's just not true.
[01:17:55.487 --> 01:17:57.749]  All right, um, oh boy, we got a break here.
[01:17:57.769 --> 01:17:59.630]  I only got through two calls and I want to play this.
[01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:02.312]  I was being a little mean to the caller.
[01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:04.013]  I'm not mad at you, caller, Anthony.
[01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:04.693]  Thanks for calling.
[01:18:04.733 --> 01:18:05.474]  Call back anytime.
[01:18:05.554 --> 01:18:06.915]  I'm mad at Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:18:06.975 --> 01:18:08.396]  I mean, killing babies makes me mad.
[01:18:09.256 --> 01:18:16.281]  Supporting twelve-year-olds on having to tell their parents when they go out on abortion makes steam come out of my ears and I kind of lashed out at you and I'm sorry.
[01:18:17.002 --> 01:18:20.904]  But, uh, you know, you're talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
[01:18:22.305 --> 01:18:23.946]  I mean, now I'm bad because I promote 1984.
[01:18:25.922 --> 01:18:34.666]  I mean, that was a good policy to have school children read that until the mid-1980s, and now, it's not even in most of the libraries, and it's not curriculum in the public schools.
[01:18:34.686 --> 01:18:35.807]  It's been removed.
[01:18:37.388 --> 01:18:39.369]  So, there's been some good stuff that's happened, too.
[01:18:39.409 --> 01:18:40.729]  The globalists don't control everything.
[01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:42.950]  And Eric Blair was a hero.
[01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:44.651]  He's a hero of mine.
[01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:46.912]  So don't besmirch his record.
[01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:48.033]  He sought for the truth.
[01:18:48.073 --> 01:18:49.714]  He tried to be a good person.
[01:18:49.734 --> 01:18:50.514]  Let me write a book.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.921]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[01:18:58.181 --> 01:19:06.623]  Doctor recommended safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere without a prescription.
[01:19:06.823 --> 01:19:08.844]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.
[01:19:09.164 --> 01:19:14.345]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[01:19:14.565 --> 01:19:20.871]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:25.376]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[01:19:25.576 --> 01:19:27.237]  Here's Cheryl G. in California.
[01:19:27.478 --> 01:19:33.944]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do without an exercise in two to three years.
[01:19:34.244 --> 01:19:40.808]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid Quell is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at QuellDirect.com.
[01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:42.569]  Quell your cholesterol today.
[01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:44.551]  Risk-free and guaranteed.
[01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:47.873]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:51.195]  Quell is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:19:51.415 --> 01:19:52.596]  Individual results may vary.
[01:19:53.479 --> 01:20:04.205]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.386 --> 01:20:11.970]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:15.372]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.632 --> 01:20:21.356]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:21.656 --> 01:20:27.820]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:32.063]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:32.123 --> 01:20:34.004]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:34.184 --> 01:20:40.148]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:44.650]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:46.171]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[01:20:53.746 --> 01:20:57.408]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:57.808 --> 01:21:03.232]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.792]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:04.812 --> 01:21:08.835]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:09.515 --> 01:21:22.803]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:28.627]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:34.811]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:35.572 --> 01:21:36.913]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:37.053 --> 01:21:41.575]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:21:42.015 --> 01:21:42.656]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:44.837]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:44.857 --> 01:21:44.917]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.363]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:21:59.503 --> 01:22:00.563]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:01.564]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:22:01.664 --> 01:22:04.505]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:22:04.705 --> 01:22:09.587]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:22:09.827 --> 01:22:10.928]  Check out this new product.
[01:22:11.068 --> 01:22:12.188]  It's called No B.O.
[01:22:12.268 --> 01:22:13.949]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.410]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:17.991]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:22:18.271 --> 01:22:20.853]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:25.776]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:22:26.056 --> 01:22:29.178]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:22:29.298 --> 01:22:34.721]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:22:34.801 --> 01:22:35.541]  Try No-B-O.
[01:22:35.682 --> 01:22:36.642]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:22:38.063 --> 01:22:40.725]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:46.430]  Check out their website at No-B-O.com.
[01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:50.853]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O at No-B-O.com.
[01:23:02.398 --> 01:23:08.500]  I'm going to air more of Galloway's testimony coming up in the next segment, then we'll get into news.
[01:23:09.961 --> 01:23:11.461]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:13.222]  David in Delaware.
[01:23:13.302 --> 01:23:13.942]  Welcome, David.
[01:23:14.283 --> 01:23:15.543]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:16.443]  Fine, my friend.
[01:23:16.864 --> 01:23:19.685]  I'm the fellow that's putting out the videos in the libraries.
[01:23:20.085 --> 01:23:20.805]  Well, good job!
[01:23:20.845 --> 01:23:21.765]  What's on your mind today, David?
[01:23:21.825 --> 01:23:25.927]  I've got them out in three libraries now, getting ready to go to the fourth one.
[01:23:27.899 --> 01:23:31.481]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:23:31.501 --> 01:23:32.381]  You're doing something.
[01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:37.163]  What I'm doing, what I'm asking you, you said today you needed support.
[01:23:39.304 --> 01:23:40.085]  I need support.
[01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:42.886]  Okay, how do we support you?
[01:23:43.066 --> 01:23:51.310]  I need somebody to send you enough money that I can load up on videos to put them in these three libraries that I'm now having one of yours in.
[01:23:51.929 --> 01:23:55.534]  And I have the Power Hour also in the videos, in the library.
[01:23:55.554 --> 01:23:56.896]  Well, here's the problem with that.
[01:23:57.217 --> 01:24:01.523]  I've got about total three full-time employees, a couple part-time employees.
[01:24:02.524 --> 01:24:07.267]  And if we started trying to do all the legwork of getting people free videos, it'd be over.
[01:24:07.747 --> 01:24:12.090]  All I can do is say, you're free to make copies of my films.
[01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:17.533]  It wouldn't be free to you, it'd be somebody sending you the money to send me some videos to put in the library.
[01:24:17.593 --> 01:24:24.156]  I know, but just the legwork of getting with them, getting the money, that would take an entire employee, at least that'd be a good program.
[01:24:25.877 --> 01:24:28.199]  A good thing to do, but I just, I mean, man, listen.
[01:24:29.446 --> 01:24:36.692]  I can place up to 25 or 30 videos, including TechSmars, into all three of those libraries and getting ready to go for the fourth one.
[01:24:38.013 --> 01:24:40.976]  I wish we had some patriotic foundations that did things like this.
[01:24:41.536 --> 01:24:44.278]  That's kind of like foundation type work, but it sounds great, sir.
[01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:46.560]  Well, I'm still trying my best.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:53.606]  I went out last week and bought over 200 DVD cases, and I'm still putting it out, but
[01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:56.603]  Only one at a time or so, because that's all I can afford.
[01:24:56.843 --> 01:24:59.304]  Hey, it's everybody like you doing it one at a time.
[01:24:59.364 --> 01:25:02.124]  That's the grassroots system, David.
[01:25:02.425 --> 01:25:02.765]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:03.025 --> 01:25:04.265]  And I want to commend you.
[01:25:04.345 --> 01:25:04.865]  Anything else?
[01:25:05.325 --> 01:25:06.266]  Also, one other thing.
[01:25:06.326 --> 01:25:08.526]  I went through the Harrington Delaware Police Department.
[01:25:09.127 --> 01:25:12.888]  They were out at Seatbelt Checkpoint the other day, and I took about ten pictures.
[01:25:14.372 --> 01:25:18.416]  Of them stopping the cars and everything else, and there was about six... And again, that's a federal grant.
[01:25:18.436 --> 01:25:19.697]  It has nothing to do with seatbelts.
[01:25:19.737 --> 01:25:21.518]  In Part 3 of the... I know it doesn't.
[01:25:21.538 --> 01:25:23.780]  ...Astronaut Seatbelt Initiative, it says it's to search cars.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.322]  It's also unconstitutional.
[01:25:25.642 --> 01:25:26.242]  Of course it is.
[01:25:26.262 --> 01:25:26.443]  Yes.
[01:25:26.703 --> 01:25:26.803]  Yes.
[01:25:26.823 --> 01:25:28.865]  But I mean, these guys are so arrogant.
[01:25:28.885 --> 01:25:34.730]  When Bill Clinton funded it, and Bush continues it, $2.2 billion a year, it says it has nothing to do with seatbelts.
[01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.891]  That's the pretext.
[01:25:35.911 --> 01:25:36.711]  They even say that.
[01:25:36.892 --> 01:25:37.292]  That's right.
[01:25:38.183 --> 01:25:39.024]  Hey, thanks for the call, David.
[01:25:39.044 --> 01:25:39.865]  Hey, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:25:39.925 --> 01:25:40.705]  Send me those photos.
[01:25:40.725 --> 01:25:41.246]  Send me copies.
[01:25:41.286 --> 01:25:41.886]  I might post them.
[01:25:42.107 --> 01:25:42.627]  Thank you, sir.
[01:25:42.787 --> 01:25:43.068]  You bet.
[01:25:43.348 --> 01:25:47.852]  The best thing is digital photos, because we don't have to scan them and then put them up and then write an article.
[01:25:48.112 --> 01:25:55.779]  If you'll write comments and send us digital photos, the tips at Infowars.com or over to Paul Watson at Prison Planet.
[01:25:56.299 --> 01:25:57.721]  Just contact Webmaster.
[01:25:57.741 --> 01:25:58.261]  We'll get it up.
[01:25:58.982 --> 01:25:59.943]  Mike in North Carolina.
[01:25:59.963 --> 01:26:00.483]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:26:01.384 --> 01:26:04.427]  Alex, thank you for allowing me to stand here beside you today.
[01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:05.757]  Well, thanks for calling.
[01:26:05.777 --> 01:26:06.277]  What's on your mind?
[01:26:06.577 --> 01:26:12.939]  My friend, I have seven sentences from an article that I just received in the mail that I would like to read for you.
[01:26:13.699 --> 01:26:18.040]  It is entitled, um, Every Step You Take I'll Be Watching You.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.620]  Got the article right here in front of me.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:20.900]  Here, let me dig it out and we'll read together.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:21.740]  Alright.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:22.741]  Go ahead and start reading.
[01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:27.722]  Um, I would like to just break down in the middle of it, uh, and begin there.
[01:26:28.382 --> 01:26:34.123]  A company called Empire North in Copenhagen, Denmark introduced a law enforcement tool called the I.D.
[01:26:34.163 --> 01:26:34.843]  Sniper Rifle.
[01:26:35.405 --> 01:26:46.590]  According to Empire North's website, a device similar to a traditional sniper rifle is used to shoot a GPS microchip into the body of a person's observed and suspicious behavior.
[01:26:47.171 --> 01:26:52.173]  The microchip, they say, causes no internal damage as it enters the subject's body.
[01:26:52.493 --> 01:26:52.713]  Sir?
[01:26:52.973 --> 01:26:53.213]  Sir?
[01:26:53.854 --> 01:26:57.255]  I have another article titled close to that, but it's from the Washington Times.
[01:26:58.016 --> 01:27:01.097]  That article you're covering, I believe that's a prank website.
[01:27:02.365 --> 01:27:08.892]  Um, I've got it out of Brigade Quartermaster's catalog at actiongear.com.
[01:27:08.912 --> 01:27:09.793]  Well, then that's real.
[01:27:09.873 --> 01:27:10.194]  Wow.
[01:27:10.895 --> 01:27:13.017]  I thought that was a joke when I saw that a few months ago.
[01:27:13.497 --> 01:27:17.442]  Well, um, all I can do is offer it to you, my friend.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.482]  And, uh, I'll listen to you comment on it.
[01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:21.303]  No, no, no.
[01:27:21.323 --> 01:27:30.571]  I mean, if it's in the law enforcement catalog, I mean, I didn't believe it when ShimmerTech, and I got the catalog, uh, has machines cops use to make crowds sick without them knowing it.
[01:27:30.872 --> 01:27:31.252]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:31.292 --> 01:27:32.453]  I also have that catalog.
[01:27:32.613 --> 01:27:33.474]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:27:33.534 --> 01:27:34.415]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:34.815 --> 01:27:35.656]  It's overwhelming us.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.603]  The microchip, they say, causes no internal damage as it enters the body.
[01:27:39.643 --> 01:27:43.588]  The subject can't tell the chip has been implanted and only feels like a mosquito bite.
[01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:48.012]  At the same time, a digital camcorder takes a high-resolution picture of the target.
[01:27:48.413 --> 01:27:51.416]  The image is stored on a memory card for later analysis.
[01:27:51.996 --> 01:27:55.400]  The manufacturer maintains that this law enforcement needs this tool.
[01:27:56.078 --> 01:28:10.201]  To gain an advantage on the new urban battlefield because it is difficult to engage a subject in the street without endangering or involving... Well that's what Iraq, and we even have documents on this, that's what Iraq and Bosnia and places are for, is to test all this stuff.
[01:28:10.602 --> 01:28:14.443]  Sounds like they're planning to maybe use it on protesters or something.
[01:28:14.763 --> 01:28:17.643]  Sounds insane, but that's uh, send me the catalog.
[01:28:18.283 --> 01:28:20.824]  I'll promise Joyce and Dave, but I'll send you a copy.
[01:28:21.064 --> 01:28:21.904]  Alright, God bless you.
[01:28:21.984 --> 01:28:22.324]  Thank you.
[01:28:22.565 --> 01:28:24.205]  Appreciate it my friend, great points.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:25.760]  Uh, here's one.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:29.422]  Counter-terror grants fund city cameras' data mining.
[01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:32.584]  And I got another one, uh, here.
[01:28:32.764 --> 01:28:35.286]  There, there really are watching you.
[01:28:36.106 --> 01:28:36.226]  Heh.
[01:28:37.087 --> 01:28:38.607]  We'll, uh, we'll be right back.
[01:28:38.627 --> 01:28:39.048]  Stay with us.
[01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:39.948]  A lot's going on.
[01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:44.531]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.011 --> 01:28:46.612]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.532 --> 01:28:50.234]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.337 --> 01:29:01.288]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:29:01.689 --> 01:29:02.850]  It suppresses your immune system!
[01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:03.832]  Now check this out.
[01:29:04.212 --> 01:29:07.637]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:29:07.958 --> 01:29:08.498]  That's about 120 pounds.
[01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:09.599]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.286 --> 01:29:32.407]  For a limited time only, get a Garicus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[01:29:32.727 --> 01:29:34.107]  Call 877-817-9829 to order a Garicus Bio at 20% off.
[01:29:34.127 --> 01:29:35.488]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[01:29:35.508 --> 01:29:36.148]  A Garicus Bio.
[01:29:36.188 --> 01:29:37.488]  Because healthy is what you want to be.
[01:29:37.528 --> 01:29:38.648]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[01:29:53.451 --> 01:29:58.416]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:29:58.716 --> 01:30:04.161]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:08.505]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:08.825 --> 01:30:11.848]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.168 --> 01:30:15.591]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:25.280]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.043]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:29.263 --> 01:30:36.370]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:37.991]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[01:30:53.400 --> 01:31:00.282]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:06.224]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:16.648]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:31:16.788 --> 01:31:19.069]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:31:19.509 --> 01:31:22.590]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:31:22.831 --> 01:31:24.211]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:31:24.331 --> 01:31:31.815]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:31:32.075 --> 01:31:33.795]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:31:34.136 --> 01:31:45.801]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:50.784]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:32:02.932 --> 01:32:09.076]  Warrior calls are coming up, and then we'll get into giving illegal aliens government housing.
[01:32:09.256 --> 01:32:11.017]  Yeah, you're just felons, it's okay.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.861]  We'll also get into how journalists are being targeted in Iraq.
[01:32:15.921 --> 01:32:19.543]  More and more prestigious organizations and groups are coming out with the evidence.
[01:32:19.703 --> 01:32:22.985]  I've got the Pentagon from before the war saying they were going to kill reporters.
[01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:24.125]  There's no mystery.
[01:32:24.165 --> 01:32:25.286]  And I've got an article here.
[01:32:25.786 --> 01:32:28.107]  Army National Guard invades the Suncoast.
[01:32:28.607 --> 01:32:31.869]  They're going to have huge urban warfare training drills all to condition the public.
[01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:36.111]  But there was an explosive showdown in the Senate.
[01:32:37.768 --> 01:32:41.631]  And George Galloway, the Member of Parliament in England, had vowed to give U.S.
[01:32:41.711 --> 01:32:43.372]  Senators both barrels.
[01:32:45.394 --> 01:32:54.240]  And after sitting coiled through an hour and a half of testimony against him, he unloaded all of his ammunition.
[01:32:55.381 --> 01:32:57.382]  And we're going to go through some of that.
[01:32:57.402 --> 01:32:58.683]  We just played four minutes of it today.
[01:32:58.703 --> 01:32:59.744]  We'll play a little bit more.
[01:33:00.624 --> 01:33:03.506]  And then we'll go back to your calls and the news.
[01:33:03.566 --> 01:33:06.929]  And then I've had just massive requests to re-air this.
[01:33:09.091 --> 01:33:25.596]  And so I'm going to play the 30-minute interview I did, the last 30 minutes of the show, from back on the 12th of this month, last week, with that police chief, that county police chief in Bergen County, New Jersey, who's taken the microchip, and he thinks that if the government orders us to take it, we should all take it.
[01:33:25.636 --> 01:33:26.996]  Yeah, that's freedom!
[01:33:27.776 --> 01:33:29.837]  So I'm going to play that, the last 30 minutes of the show.
[01:33:30.893 --> 01:33:37.606]  But right now, let's go to Galloway, being questioned by the head of the committee, and they've been telling him his rights after demonizing him.
[01:33:38.187 --> 01:33:39.791]  And we have the whole thing posted.
[01:33:40.757 --> 01:33:53.766]  Well, an hour of it posted right now on personplanted.com, but here's a few more minutes of it, and then it goes to Mr. Galloway, who, again, it's been turned out, was totally demonized, and they falsified documents on him.
[01:33:54.567 --> 01:33:59.190]  They've been caught so many times doing this, when our own government are the ones profiting from the oil for food program.
[01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:02.112]  And of course, Europe was doing it too, but Galloway had nothing to do with it.
[01:34:02.612 --> 01:34:06.373]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to that piece of audio.
[01:34:06.453 --> 01:34:14.616]  ...of the performance of any of your official duties as a member of the British Parliament, but instead concern actions taken by you in your capacity as a private citizen.
[01:34:15.276 --> 01:34:20.018]  Before we begin, pursuant to Rule 6, all witnesses who testify before this subcommittee are required to be sworn.
[01:34:20.038 --> 01:34:22.519]  At this time, I ask you to rise and please raise your right hand.
[01:34:22.539 --> 01:34:29.621]  You swear to the testimony you're about to give before this subcommittee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.
[01:34:32.071 --> 01:34:34.933]  We will be using a timing system today, uh, Mr. Galloway.
[01:34:34.953 --> 01:34:36.574]  Uh, we have ten minutes for opening statement.
[01:34:36.634 --> 01:34:38.495]  If you need more time, we'll certainly accommodate that.
[01:34:38.835 --> 01:34:39.896]  And, uh, you may proceed.
[01:34:42.958 --> 01:34:49.562]  Senator, I am not now, nor have I ever been, an oil trader.
[01:34:50.923 --> 01:34:54.325]  And neither has anyone on my behalf.
[01:34:55.826 --> 01:35:00.449]  I have never seen a bottle of oil, owned one, bought one,
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.321]  Sold one, and neither has anybody on my behalf.
[01:35:07.182 --> 01:35:16.305]  Now I know that standards have slipped over the last few years in Washington, but for a lawyer, you're remarkably cavalier with any idea of justice.
[01:35:17.605 --> 01:35:22.867]  I'm here today, but last week, you already found me guilty.
[01:35:23.987 --> 01:35:30.289]  You traduced my name around the world, without ever having asked me a single question,
[01:35:31.252 --> 01:35:40.435]  Without ever having contacted me, without ever having written to me, or telephoned me, without any contact with me whatsoever.
[01:35:41.876 --> 01:35:43.897]  And you call that justice?
[01:35:45.217 --> 01:35:59.222]  Now I want to deal with the pages that relate to me in this dossier, and I want to point out areas where there are, let's be charitable, and say errors.
[01:36:00.583 --> 01:36:05.564]  And then I want to put this in the context that I believe it ought to be.
[01:36:05.584 --> 01:36:19.808]  On the very first page of your document about me, you assert that I have had many meetings with Saddam Hussein.
[01:36:21.088 --> 01:36:21.968]  This is false.
[01:36:23.489 --> 01:36:26.329]  I have had two meetings with Saddam Hussein.
[01:36:27.429 --> 01:36:27.810]  Once in 1994,
[01:36:30.313 --> 01:36:32.154]  And once in August of 2002.
[01:36:34.635 --> 01:36:40.799]  By no stretch of the English language can that be described as many meetings with Saddam Hussein.
[01:36:40.959 --> 01:36:48.743]  As a matter of fact, I've met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him.
[01:36:49.884 --> 01:36:54.426]  The difference is, Donald Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns.
[01:36:55.287 --> 01:36:59.469]  And to give him maps, the better to target those guns.
[01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:18.590]  I met him to try and bring about an end to sanctions, suffering, and war, and on the second of the two occasions, I met him to try and persuade him to allow Dr. Hans Blix and the United Nations Weapons Inspectors back into the country.
[01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:27.274]  A rather better use of two meetings with Saddam Hussein than your own Secretary of State for Defense made of his.
[01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:39.190]  This is false.
[01:37:40.390 --> 01:38:02.055]  I have brought along here a dossier, a dossier for all the members of your committee, of statements by me as late, as early rather, as the 15th of March 1990, in which I condemn the Saddam Hussein dictatorship in the most withering terms.
[01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:09.542]  A stance I have taken since around about the time you were an anti-Vietnam War demonstrator.
[01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:20.168]  I was an opponent of Saddam Hussein when British and American governments and businessmen were selling him guns and gas.
[01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:28.793]  I used to demonstrate outside the Iraqi Embassy when British and American officials were going in and out doing commerce.
[01:38:29.716 --> 01:38:52.960]  You will see from the official parliamentary record, Hansard, from the 15th of March 1990 onwards, voluminous evidence that I have a rather better record of opposition to Saddam Hussein than you do and than any member of the British or American governments do.
[01:38:54.682 --> 01:39:04.744]  Now you say in this document, you quote a source, you have the gall to quote a source without ever having asked me if the allegation from the source was true.
[01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:15.047]  That I am, quote, the owner of a company which has made substantial profits from trading in Iraqi oil.
[01:39:15.687 --> 01:39:24.069]  Senator, I do not own any companies beyond a small company whose entire purpose
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:33.343]  Whose sole purpose is to receive the income from my journalistic earnings from my employer Associated Newspapers in London.
[01:39:37.464 --> 01:39:41.685]  And I believe that's a little clip point in the tape.
[01:39:41.745 --> 01:39:45.726]  I was told we've recorded like 45 minutes of this.
[01:39:47.307 --> 01:39:48.707]  Uh, George, are you there, my friend?
[01:39:49.748 --> 01:39:50.728]  What's going on with the tape?
[01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:55.731]  Okay, you've paused it.
[01:39:55.912 --> 01:39:56.672]  Does it continue?
[01:39:58.854 --> 01:40:00.956]  Okay, let's go back to it and see what happens.
[01:40:00.976 --> 01:40:03.739]  We downloaded this off the British... Okay, go ahead and roll it.
[01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:20.013]  Okay, George, are we on the air right now?
[01:40:21.383 --> 01:40:22.723]  Well, you're saying it's still rolling.
[01:40:22.863 --> 01:40:24.104]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:40:25.204 --> 01:40:27.145]  I would take that to mean it's rolling on the air.
[01:40:27.205 --> 01:40:28.585]  That's why I stopped talking.
[01:40:29.746 --> 01:40:33.307]  But, uh, well, I thought I was told it was downloaded.
[01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:39.169]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com, ladies and gentlemen, and, uh, it's really important what he says, because it's all true.
[01:40:39.209 --> 01:40:47.511]  I've researched it, and it's just really despicable what they do, and how they're the ones doing what they blame him for, or bearing against it.
[01:40:47.752 --> 01:40:48.992]  George, are we able to play that?
[01:40:52.521 --> 01:40:53.201]  All righty then.
[01:40:53.822 --> 01:40:55.823]  Maybe we should just stream it right off my website.
[01:40:55.843 --> 01:40:59.225]  Maybe that's what needs to be done here.
[01:40:59.665 --> 01:41:00.966]  Who knows?
[01:41:01.026 --> 01:41:06.029]  I'm hell-bent on, as they say, to play this because it's important.
[01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:09.831]  I'll try to figure out what's going on.
[01:41:09.951 --> 01:41:13.133]  I'd like to be able to do that.
[01:41:13.213 --> 01:41:15.214]  I'll figure it out.
[01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:16.936]  I'll see what happens.
[01:41:19.148 --> 01:41:24.049]  Again, folks, he goes into how our government is involved in the trading for oil for food.
[01:41:24.609 --> 01:41:25.530]  The manipulations.
[01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:32.431]  And it was our government that put the sanctions on Iraq, back in 1990 on the eve of the Gulf War, after.
[01:41:33.412 --> 01:41:34.732]  And this is very, very important.
[01:41:35.952 --> 01:41:36.573]  Right after.
[01:41:37.573 --> 01:41:39.593]  They had told Saddam to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:41:39.613 --> 01:41:40.494]  He was our little buddy.
[01:41:40.534 --> 01:41:45.735]  They had given him the anthrax, the botulism, the West Nile, the sarin, the VX,
[01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:49.102]  The mustard gas, how to spray it, what to do.
[01:41:49.122 --> 01:42:03.769]  I remember sitting in the kitchen, when I was in school, while my mother was chopping up vegetables with the TV on, hearing about how great Sinan was fighting those evil Iranians.
[01:42:05.449 --> 01:42:10.392]  And Mr. Gallo reading that and exposing that, way back then as a journalist and as an activist.
[01:42:16.013 --> 01:42:17.895]  It's just so ridiculous what they do.
[01:42:18.155 --> 01:42:26.181]  I mean, it's Dick Cheney selling oil field equipment and weapons equipment through their companies to Saddam right through until 2002.
[01:42:26.842 --> 01:42:37.670]  And that's all admitted, and they have the nerve to, like, paste his name, Mr. Galloway's name, onto another document and go after him.
[01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:43.174]  I think we were about five minutes into his testimony.
[01:42:43.214 --> 01:42:43.455]  Can we...
[01:42:48.007 --> 01:42:50.828]  Okay, so we're just going to go directly to my website and stream it.
[01:42:51.168 --> 01:42:54.069]  Alright, and if too many people aren't here we might be able to do it.
[01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:57.651]  I'm sorry folks, I thought that was recorded and didn't know.
[01:42:58.731 --> 01:43:04.473]  But, again, folks, this is what we're dealing with.
[01:43:04.893 --> 01:43:07.414]  I mean, just bald-faced lies.
[01:43:07.894 --> 01:43:10.775]  We're talking about people here.
[01:43:11.956 --> 01:43:14.657]  We're talking about individuals here.
[01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:26.287]  Who will tell you there's weapons of mass destruction and tell you hundreds of times they know right where they're at, because they've got the receipt, because they sold it to them, but the UN's been in there and made sure it was all destroyed.
[01:43:26.468 --> 01:43:30.849]  Something our government sold them, but still, he's evil, we've got to destroy it, so it's destroyed.
[01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:37.452]  And then they get up on the news and say dozens of times, we never said that, it's a conspiracy theory, it's an urban legend.
[01:43:37.492 --> 01:43:40.694]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:43:43.054 --> 01:43:43.875]  How big an idiot
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:45.741]  Do they think we are?
[01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:47.222]  And they do this on every subject.
[01:43:47.262 --> 01:43:51.366]  You know, Bush says, I've got this new plan for immigration, but it's not an amnesty plan.
[01:43:51.386 --> 01:43:53.768]  Then you read the bill, we have Congress put on to analyze it.
[01:43:54.088 --> 01:43:55.409]  A two-year-old could understand it.
[01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:57.011]  No, that's exaggeration.
[01:43:57.031 --> 01:43:58.592]  An eight-year-old could understand it.
[01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.714]  To be accurate and serious.
[01:44:01.295 --> 01:44:03.537]  And it says, anybody who's here for six years is legal.
[01:44:04.057 --> 01:44:05.859]  Anybody who gets here for six years is legal.
[01:44:05.899 --> 01:44:11.384]  Corporations can bring in skilled, unskilled workers, and it gives them all ID cards, but it's not
[01:44:12.131 --> 01:44:12.892]  An amnesty plan.
[01:44:12.932 --> 01:44:14.693]  No, it's just the biggest amnesty plan ever.
[01:44:15.073 --> 01:44:17.515]  But he says it's not an amnesty, so people will argue with you.
[01:44:17.915 --> 01:44:19.656]  They'll get blue in the face that it's not an amnesty.
[01:44:19.736 --> 01:44:22.058]  I mean, it's just a wall of lies.
[01:44:22.919 --> 01:44:27.202]  And they change the lies on a daily basis, and the dominant media doesn't call them on it.
[01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:33.786]  We're being bathed, basted, in lies.
[01:44:35.127 --> 01:44:37.109]  And it's despicable.
[01:44:38.029 --> 01:44:41.512]  It's very, very, very dangerous.
[01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:48.172]  And as a country, we need to realize that the corruption has reached all-time highs.
[01:44:52.354 --> 01:45:00.717]  Let me continue just with some other news items, and I don't know if we'll be able to air that today, but I assure you, you're going to hear it if I have to record it on CD and play it from my studio.
[01:45:01.477 --> 01:45:02.237]  You will hear that.
[01:45:02.898 --> 01:45:03.218]  On air.
[01:45:03.858 --> 01:45:08.780]  Whether it's tomorrow, whether it's next week, we're going to play Galloway's testimony.
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:23.149]  Well, if we're at 7 minutes 8 seconds in it, though we've already aired that, we'd probably want to go to about 12 minutes in or something like that.
[01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:36.059]  But I don't think we have time to play it now, so... We'll air a little more and see if we're able to, but just tell me when you're up to... Go ahead and start it over there, then.
[01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:37.300]  If we repeat something, that's okay.
[01:45:38.925 --> 01:45:40.826]  Go ahead and roll that one, whatever you like, George.
[01:45:40.846 --> 01:45:42.426]  Do we have it?
[01:45:42.486 --> 01:45:45.808]  There were 270 names on that list originally.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:11.122]  That's somehow been filleted down to the names you chose to deal with in this committee.
[01:46:12.203 --> 01:46:31.050]  Some of the names on that committee included the former secretary to His Holiness Pope John Paul II, the former head of the African National Congress presidential office, and many others who had one defining characteristic in common.
[01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:34.191]  They all stood against the policy
[01:46:34.787 --> 01:46:42.129]  Of sanctions and war which you vociferously prosecuted and which has led us to this disaster.
[01:46:43.410 --> 01:46:46.651]  You quote Mr. Taha Yassin Ramadan.
[01:46:47.691 --> 01:46:48.811]  Well you have something on me.
[01:46:49.751 --> 01:46:52.772]  I've never met Mr. Taha Yassin Ramadan.
[01:46:53.212 --> 01:46:55.573]  Your subcommittee apparently has.
[01:46:56.433 --> 01:46:58.394]  But I do know that he's your prisoner.
[01:46:59.154 --> 01:47:01.555]  I believe he's in Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:08.573]  I believe he's facing war crimes, charges, punishable by death.
[01:47:09.633 --> 01:47:27.058]  In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison, in Bagram Air Base, in Guantanamo Bay, including, I may say, British citizens being held in those places.
[01:47:27.878 --> 01:47:31.879]  I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything
[01:47:32.327 --> 01:47:36.210]  You managed to get from a prisoner in those circumstances.
[01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:42.874]  But you quote 13 words from Taha Yasin Ramadan, whom I have never met.
[01:47:43.635 --> 01:47:47.938]  If he said what he said, then he is wrong.
[01:47:49.038 --> 01:48:00.366]  And if you had any evidence that I had ever engaged in any actual oil transaction, if you had any evidence that anybody ever gave me any money,
[01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:04.774]  It would be before the public and before this commitment today.
[01:48:04.814 --> 01:48:07.536]  Because I agreed with your Mr. Greenblatt.
[01:48:08.918 --> 01:48:11.620]  Your Mr. Greenblatt was absolutely correct.
[01:48:12.441 --> 01:48:15.124]  What counts is not the names on the paper.
[01:48:15.844 --> 01:48:18.767]  What counts is where's the money, Senator.
[01:48:19.608 --> 01:48:23.171]  Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars of money?
[01:48:23.692 --> 01:48:25.654]  The answer to that is nobody.
[01:48:26.112 --> 01:48:32.056]  And if you had anybody who ever paid me a penny, you would have produced them here today.
[01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:43.583]  Now you refer, at length, to a company named in these documents as Iredio Petroleum.
[01:48:45.264 --> 01:48:51.788]  I say to you under oath here today, I have never heard of this company.
[01:48:52.509 --> 01:48:55.591]  I have never met anyone from this company.
[01:48:56.394 --> 01:49:01.417]  This company has never paid a penny to me, and I'll tell you something else.
[01:49:02.437 --> 01:49:10.942]  I can assure you that A Radio Petroleum has never paid a single penny to the Marriam Appeal campaign.
[01:49:11.542 --> 01:49:13.803]  Not a thin dime.
[01:49:14.704 --> 01:49:24.849]  I don't know who A Radio Petroleum are, but I dare say if you were to ask them, they would confirm that they have never met me or ever paid me a penny.
[01:49:26.678 --> 01:49:33.905]  Whilst I'm on that subject, who is this senior former regime official that you spoke to yesterday?
[01:49:34.586 --> 01:49:36.587]  Don't you think I have a right to know?
[01:49:37.528 --> 01:49:40.591]  Don't you think the committee and the public have a right to know?
[01:49:40.611 --> 01:49:43.474]  We'll pause it right there and we'll be back folks.
[01:49:43.634 --> 01:49:45.516]  A lot more coming up so stay with us.
[01:49:51.866 --> 01:49:56.210]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.390 --> 01:50:00.814]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:00.954 --> 01:50:05.337]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:05.357 --> 01:50:06.719]  The New World Order.
[01:50:07.519 --> 01:50:08.460]  Hammer!
[01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:12.725]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:12.785 --> 01:50:19.733]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:19.853 --> 01:50:21.856]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.216 --> 01:50:32.683]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:32.843 --> 01:50:38.267]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:43.090]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.110 --> 01:50:44.951]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:50:52.979 --> 01:51:04.257]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:04.477 --> 01:51:07.963]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:08.223 --> 01:51:12.444]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:12.724 --> 01:51:23.407]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:23.627 --> 01:51:29.128]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:29.348 --> 01:51:33.589]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting
[01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:34.269]  I think so.
[01:51:51.988 --> 01:51:52.529]  Thank you.
[01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:08.028]  We're good to go.

[01:52:57.639 --> 01:53:02.901]  I'll be getting into some of the urban warfare drills that are going on around the country to desensitize the public.
[01:53:03.822 --> 01:53:10.765]  Coming up in the next hour, a bunch of other news, and we may have time to take some more calls, but I want to continue with this Galloway speech.
[01:53:10.825 --> 01:53:12.666]  Go ahead and continue rolling that, please.
[01:53:15.107 --> 01:53:20.670]  Anyone from this company, this company has never paid a penny to me
[01:53:21.437 --> 01:53:22.478]  And I'll tell you something else.
[01:53:23.479 --> 01:53:31.985]  I can assure you that a Radio Petroleum has never paid a single penny to the Mariam Appeal campaign.
[01:53:32.586 --> 01:53:34.868]  Not a thin dime.
[01:53:35.728 --> 01:53:45.957]  I don't know who a Radio Petroleum are, but I dare say if you were to ask them, they would confirm that they have never met me or ever paid me a penny.
[01:53:47.758 --> 01:53:48.839]  Whilst I'm on that subject,
[01:53:49.423 --> 01:53:54.886]  Who is this senior former regime official that you spoke to yesterday?
[01:53:55.606 --> 01:53:57.647]  Don't you think I have a right to know?
[01:53:58.568 --> 01:54:10.253]  Don't you think the committee and the public have a right to know who this senior former regime official you were quoting against me interviewed yesterday actually is?
[01:54:13.475 --> 01:54:19.098]  Now, one of the most serious of the mistakes that you have made
[01:54:19.822 --> 01:54:46.543]  in this set of documents is to be frank such a schoolboy howler as to make a fool of the efforts that you have made you assert on page 19 not once but twice that the documents that you're referring to
[01:54:48.809 --> 01:55:04.216]  cover a different period in time from the documents covered by the Daily Telegraph which were the subject of a libel action won by me in the High Court in England late last year.
[01:55:05.497 --> 01:55:11.219]  You state that the Daily Telegraph article cited documents from 1992 and 1993 whilst you
[01:55:16.232 --> 01:55:18.654]  are dealing with documents dating from 2001.
[01:55:19.134 --> 01:55:31.823]  Senator, the Daily Telegraph's documents date identically to the documents that you're dealing with in your report here.
[01:55:33.044 --> 01:55:36.947]  None of the Daily Telegraph's documents dealt with a period of 1992-1993.
[01:55:37.067 --> 01:55:38.788]  I had never set foot in Iraq until
[01:55:44.875 --> 01:55:46.796]  Late in 1993.
[01:55:47.196 --> 01:56:00.562]  Never in my life there could possibly be no documents relating to oil for food matters in 1992-93, for the oil for food scheme did not exist at that time.
[01:56:01.502 --> 01:56:14.408]  And yet, you've allocated a full section of this document to claiming that your documents are from a different era to the Daily Telegraph documents when the opposite is true.
[01:56:15.228 --> 01:56:20.529]  Your documents and the Daily Telegraph documents deal with exactly the same period.
[01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:28.151]  But perhaps you were confusing the Daily Telegraph action with the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:56:29.171 --> 01:56:40.973]  The Christian Science Monitor did indeed publish on its front pages a set of allegations against me very similar to the ones that your committee have made.
[01:56:41.753 --> 01:56:44.934]  They did indeed rely on documents which started
[01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:46.101]  In 1992, 1993.
[01:56:48.122 --> 01:56:55.445]  These documents were unmasked by the Christian Science Monitor themselves as forgeries.
[01:56:56.706 --> 01:57:03.249]  Now, the neocon websites and newspapers in which you're such a hero, Senator.
[01:57:03.269 --> 01:57:04.089]  Alright, hit pause.
[01:57:04.129 --> 01:57:05.810]  We're all absolutely cock-a-whoop.
[01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:08.011]  Alright, and we're going to back up a few seconds.
[01:57:08.031 --> 01:57:14.834]  We're going to play the rest of this because understand, they're so sloppy with the fake documents that they create.
[01:57:15.777 --> 01:57:19.881]  That it's not even in the same year where the program was even set up.
[01:57:20.161 --> 01:57:24.225]  And he sued a major newspaper and won, and now he's going to sue all these people!
[01:57:25.326 --> 01:57:26.908]  He's standing up against these liars.
[01:57:26.948 --> 01:57:28.189]  He should sue them all!
[01:57:29.770 --> 01:57:31.432]  They love to make fake documents.
[01:57:31.472 --> 01:57:32.753]  Well, there's only about 5-6 minutes left.
[01:57:32.773 --> 01:57:35.316]  We'll play it, cover some other news, and take your calls.
[01:57:36.036 --> 01:57:37.137]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:37.157 --> 01:57:38.739]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:57:47.789 --> 01:57:48.394]  Big brother.
[01:57:49.082 --> 01:57:50.183]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:51.984]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.585 --> 01:57:53.465]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.206 --> 01:57:55.167]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.187 --> 01:57:59.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.950 --> 01:58:04.073]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.874 --> 01:58:10.058]  The globalists are masters at accusing others of what they themselves are doing.
[01:58:10.238 --> 01:58:16.583]  While Halliburton and many others have contracts with Saddam, or involved in the oil for food program scam,
[01:58:17.982 --> 01:58:21.364]  Ripping the Iraqis off, engaging in that genocide.
[01:58:22.144 --> 01:58:30.788]  The people that stood up against it and fought against it then have their names forged onto documents and that's now been exposed again even by mainstream news here in the United States.
[01:58:31.088 --> 01:58:38.531]  And here is Member of Parliament George Galloway continuing to go over this there in the Congress just a few days ago.
[01:58:38.591 --> 01:58:39.192]  Please continue.
[01:58:40.252 --> 01:58:44.794]  The Christian Science Monitor did indeed publish on its front pages
[01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:52.033]  A set of allegations against me, very similar to the ones that your committee have made.
[01:58:52.834 --> 01:58:57.817]  They did indeed rely on documents which started in 1992-1993.
[01:58:59.218 --> 01:59:06.523]  These documents were unmasked by the Christian Science Monitor themselves as forgeries.
[01:59:07.764 --> 01:59:14.308]  Now, the neocon websites and newspapers in which you're such a hero, Senator,
[01:59:15.137 --> 01:59:20.119]  We're all absolutely cock-a-hoop at the publication of the Christian Science Monitor documents.
[01:59:20.699 --> 01:59:23.820]  They were all absolutely convinced of their authenticity.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:33.063]  They were all absolutely convinced that these documents showed me receiving 10 million dollars from the Saddam Hussein regime.
[01:59:33.463 --> 01:59:35.043]  And they were all lies.
[01:59:36.003 --> 01:59:40.605]  In the same week as the Daily Telegraph published their documents against me,
[01:59:41.283 --> 01:59:46.047]  The Christian Science Monitor published theirs, which turned out to be forgeries.
[01:59:46.787 --> 01:59:55.694]  And the British newspaper Mail on Sunday purchased a third set of documents, which also on forensic examination turned out to be forgeries.
[01:59:56.135 --> 01:59:58.476]  So there's nothing fanciful about this.
[01:59:59.177 --> 02:00:01.699]  Nothing at all fanciful about it.
[02:00:02.419 --> 02:00:09.425]  The existence of forged documents implicating me in commercial activities with the Iraqi regime
[02:00:10.365 --> 02:00:11.286]  It's a proven fact.
[02:00:11.446 --> 02:00:25.135]  It's a proven fact that these forged documents existed and were being circulated amongst right-wing newspapers in Baghdad and around the world in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Iraqi regime.
[02:00:25.396 --> 02:00:32.440]  Now Senator, I gave my heart and soul to oppose the policy that you promoted.
[02:00:33.501 --> 02:00:38.765]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop
[02:00:40.006 --> 02:00:44.787]  The mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq.
[02:00:45.387 --> 02:00:47.308]  Which killed a million Iraqis.
[02:00:47.788 --> 02:00:48.988]  Most of them children.
[02:00:50.188 --> 02:00:53.769]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis.
[02:00:54.569 --> 02:00:58.670]  But they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis.
[02:00:59.230 --> 02:01:02.391]  With the misfortune to be born at that time.
[02:01:03.451 --> 02:01:08.972]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit.
[02:01:09.682 --> 02:01:11.023]  In invading Iraq.
[02:01:12.043 --> 02:01:17.886]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[02:01:18.786 --> 02:01:25.149]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:01:25.889 --> 02:01:31.872]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:32.612 --> 02:01:35.113]  I told the world, contrary to your claims,
[02:01:35.635 --> 02:01:40.579]  That Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[02:01:41.099 --> 02:01:56.331]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country, and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[02:01:57.111 --> 02:02:04.277]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right, and you turned out to be wrong.
[02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:07.491]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[02:02:08.071 --> 02:02:10.412]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers.
[02:02:10.893 --> 02:02:11.833]  Sent to their deaths.
[02:02:12.113 --> 02:02:12.433]  Alright.
[02:02:12.553 --> 02:02:14.054]  On a pack of lies.
[02:02:15.935 --> 02:02:16.595]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:02:16.615 --> 02:02:17.175]  We're gonna come back.
[02:02:17.195 --> 02:02:18.836]  There's only a few minutes left of this.
[02:02:19.016 --> 02:02:23.778]  We got most of it out today and I appreciate the crew up there on such short notice getting it downloaded.
[02:02:23.818 --> 02:02:26.159]  But the web's a strange thing so we didn't have the file earlier.
[02:02:26.199 --> 02:02:26.679]  We do now.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:33.102]  And we'll finish up with it then get into a bunch of other key news and then interview that police chief who wants you all to have microchips.
[02:02:34.321 --> 02:02:36.967]  A few other key announcements coming up as well.
[02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:40.133]  So, uh, interesting stuff straight ahead.
[02:02:40.153 --> 02:02:41.055]  I hope you'll stay with us.
[02:02:41.075 --> 02:02:42.258]  The website's InfoWars.com.
[02:02:43.334 --> 02:02:50.178]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:50.498 --> 02:02:51.859]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:52.059 --> 02:02:54.280]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.521]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:56.781 --> 02:03:01.704]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:02.044 --> 02:03:06.086]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:06.346 --> 02:03:08.108]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:08.188 --> 02:03:18.841]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:19.001 --> 02:03:20.883]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:21.104 --> 02:03:23.146]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[02:03:23.346 --> 02:03:23.987]  We're good to go.
[02:03:42.603 --> 02:03:44.204]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.565 --> 02:03:50.309]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:50.569 --> 02:03:55.713]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:56.053 --> 02:03:58.535]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove
[02:03:58.595 --> 02:04:05.339]  Patogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.679 --> 02:04:10.622]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:04:10.942 --> 02:04:14.965]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:04:15.165 --> 02:04:19.948]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light, and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:04:20.288 --> 02:04:26.275]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:26.555 --> 02:04:32.762]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:32.822 --> 02:04:33.804]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.864 --> 02:04:35.065]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.146 --> 02:04:46.528]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[02:04:46.668 --> 02:04:50.351]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[02:04:50.531 --> 02:04:56.575]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[02:04:56.815 --> 02:05:03.880]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:07.883]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[02:05:08.263 --> 02:05:11.246]  That God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one.
[02:05:11.466 --> 02:05:14.268]  And that we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor.
[02:05:14.469 --> 02:05:18.973]  Christ promises to grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in his mercy.
[02:05:19.173 --> 02:05:24.277]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[02:05:24.497 --> 02:05:28.481]  I'm offering you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about divine mercy.
[02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:29.141]  We're good to go.
[02:05:49.136 --> 02:05:50.157]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:50.898 --> 02:05:52.000]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:53.481]  You want answers?
[02:05:54.242 --> 02:05:55.123]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:55.804 --> 02:05:59.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.989 --> 02:06:04.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:07.291]  Alright, eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:06:07.351 --> 02:06:08.632]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:08.692 --> 02:06:10.073]  It's May 19, 2005.
[02:06:10.573 --> 02:06:12.535]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.875 --> 02:06:19.541]  In a few minutes, we'll air the conclusion of the opening statements that we didn't get to all of yesterday.
[02:06:19.581 --> 02:06:23.023]  We are going to air all of it here today, and I appreciate the crew getting that for us.
[02:06:23.063 --> 02:06:29.348]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com, where he exposed their lies and their fraud for what it was.
[02:06:29.508 --> 02:06:32.551]  We'll back it up just a few seconds and start over in a minute.
[02:06:33.368 --> 02:06:35.748]  But before I do that, then we'll get into some other news.
[02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:42.990]  Before I do that, there is a special that's only going to be offered while supplies last, just for a couple weeks.
[02:06:43.770 --> 02:06:49.991]  Nubulium Concepts is the national distributor, the distributor of the British Berkey, the big Berkey.
[02:06:50.591 --> 02:06:53.732]  They also improved upon it with the black Berkey element.
[02:06:54.652 --> 02:06:59.493]  I have the white elements, I have the black elements, they're all excellent.
[02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:06.352]  Folks, it is a great system, and the normal systems hold about a gallon and a half of water.
[02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:16.835]  They have what's normally called an Imperial, with a stainless steel, 3-gallon system, with the white elements, a British Berkey.
[02:07:16.875 --> 02:07:23.537]  They also have the Made in America Berkeys, but right now they're offering it just for an insanely low price,
[02:07:24.375 --> 02:07:26.376]  Give Debbie a call and ask her about it.
[02:07:26.396 --> 02:07:27.897]  They've got a bunch of other specials.
[02:07:28.217 --> 02:07:29.098]  They're running right now.
[02:07:29.118 --> 02:07:36.121]  If you've been waiting to get a big Berkey filter, a sports bottle filter, or any of these systems, now is the time to give her a call.
[02:07:36.361 --> 02:07:38.623]  It is just a fabulous system.
[02:07:39.203 --> 02:07:41.984]  They cost the same as Indian and Chinese knockoffs.
[02:07:42.004 --> 02:07:52.510]  When you feel the British or the black American Berkey elements, they're so much more heavy than these Chinese and Indian knockoffs that are the same price, sometimes more.
[02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:56.154]  I mean, I bought a gravity filter back in the mid-90s that was like $200.
[02:07:57.014 --> 02:07:58.596]  It was made in India, a piece of junk.
[02:07:58.976 --> 02:08:06.604]  I paid the same amount for a British Berkey in 1999 that just had heads and shoulders above it.
[02:08:06.885 --> 02:08:08.927]  And now the American Berkeys are even better.
[02:08:09.733 --> 02:08:17.000]  But if you want a stainless steel body and British elements, or you can pay a little more and get the black elements, give Debbie a call right now.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:25.769]  She was on during the break and told me the price, and I'm a bit flustered today with technical stuff, and it slipped my mind.
[02:08:25.789 --> 02:08:26.690]  So just give her a call.
[02:08:26.710 --> 02:08:26.770]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:08:34.177 --> 02:08:34.637]  4-4-3-8.
[02:08:35.437 --> 02:08:37.678]  British and American made Berkey's.
[02:08:38.058 --> 02:08:43.499]  Give her a call.
[02:08:43.519 --> 02:08:45.080]  888-803-4438.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440]  $2.25 is the price.
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:47.380]  Wow!
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.120]  Thank you, George.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.421]  How did you find that out so quick?
[02:08:51.521 --> 02:08:52.842]  Yeah, it was $2.25.
[02:08:52.882 --> 02:08:53.982]  I guess he remembered and I didn't.
[02:08:54.802 --> 02:08:55.682]  That's how he found out.
[02:08:55.702 --> 02:08:56.923]  He heard me talking to her during the break.
[02:08:58.203 --> 02:08:59.223]  Yeah.
[02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:00.163]  $2.25, folks.
[02:09:00.503 --> 02:09:02.744]  A three gallon stainless steel Berkey.
[02:09:03.678 --> 02:09:05.459]  I think those things retail at like $350 or something.
[02:09:05.539 --> 02:09:06.320]  I mean, $225, that is a great price.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:07.681]  That is an insane price.
[02:09:07.701 --> 02:09:09.482]  1-888-803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com
[02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:23.573]  And, uh, link through and tell them which, uh, which Berkey you want.
[02:09:23.593 --> 02:09:26.875]  I think you probably need to call for that particular one, but give her a call.
[02:09:26.895 --> 02:09:27.095]  888-803-4438.
[02:09:27.195 --> 02:09:36.642]  Alright, let's go back to Galloway, uh, who has been just demonized and now sued the first newspaper that did this, and they've lost the libel suit.
[02:09:37.243 --> 02:09:43.287]  Um, uh, here it is, ladies and gentlemen, standing up to them about the Oil for Food program and exposing who was really behind it.
[02:09:43.328 --> 02:09:43.688]  Here it is.
[02:09:44.906 --> 02:09:50.167]  15,000 of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies.
[02:09:50.727 --> 02:09:55.449]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded.
[02:09:56.149 --> 02:10:02.450]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor.
[02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:10.292]  If the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we're in today.
[02:10:11.155 --> 02:10:14.636]  Senator, this is the mother of all smokescreens.
[02:10:15.516 --> 02:10:24.538]  You are trying to divert attention from the crimes that you supported, from the theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth.
[02:10:25.798 --> 02:10:28.839]  Have a look at the real oil for food scandal.
[02:10:29.399 --> 02:10:40.602]  Have a look at the 14 months you were in charge of Baghdad, the first 14 months, when 8.8 billion dollars of Iraq's wealth went missing on your watch.
[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:49.246]  Have a look at Halliburton and the other American corporations that stole not only Iraq's money, but the money of the American taxpayer.
[02:10:49.987 --> 02:10:58.834]  Have a look at the oil that you didn't even meter that you were shipping out of the country and selling, the proceeds of which went who knows where.
[02:10:59.175 --> 02:11:08.282]  Have a look at the $800 million you gave to American military commanders to hand out around the country without even counting it or weighing it.
[02:11:09.167 --> 02:11:12.669]  Have a look at the real scandal breaking in the newspapers today.
[02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:25.216]  Revealed in the earlier testimony in this committee that the biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians.
[02:11:25.696 --> 02:11:32.359]  The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government.
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:35.201]  Thank you, Mr. Galloway.
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.383]  Mr. Galloway, can we start by talking about Farway Zircon?
[02:11:40.524 --> 02:11:41.304]  Do you know the individual?
[02:11:41.825 --> 02:11:42.365]  I know him very well.
[02:11:42.846 --> 02:11:44.147]  In fact, you were the best man at his wedding?
[02:11:44.567 --> 02:11:44.807]  I was.
[02:11:45.868 --> 02:11:48.770]  And at some point in time, he became chair of Merriam's Appeal, is that correct?
[02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:49.291]  He did, yeah.
[02:11:49.891 --> 02:11:51.092]  And can you tell me when that occurred?
[02:11:52.013 --> 02:11:53.714]  I think in late 2000 or early 2001.
[02:11:54.114 --> 02:12:02.361]  Alright, now this skips ahead to questioning, and that's it for the clip, but
[02:12:04.111 --> 02:12:08.594]  Again, you've really got to see it in its full context without the breaks, and it's at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:24.005]  Going up in the next hour or so will be large excerpts of my TV report I did last night, and shifting gears radically, it has to do with a popular Star Wars phenomenon, which is New Age and occulting.
[02:12:24.165 --> 02:12:25.346]  Yes, I'm fully aware of that.
[02:12:26.013 --> 02:12:32.074]  But the question is, why has it had such a powerful effect on the grip psychology?
[02:12:32.534 --> 02:12:35.175]  Why has it resonated, despite all the cheesiness of it?
[02:12:36.195 --> 02:12:39.856]  Because George Lucas admittedly studied secret societies and the occult.
[02:12:39.936 --> 02:12:42.217]  I've read his writings on it in his interviews.
[02:12:43.377 --> 02:12:44.577]  He studied the Nazis.
[02:12:45.297 --> 02:12:48.938]  He studied the Thule Society and Thule Society that Hitler was a member of.
[02:12:49.952 --> 02:12:57.056]  Darth Vader wears the garb of the Dark Sorcerer, the Secret Police, the Inquisitor, the Ringwraith.
[02:12:58.236 --> 02:13:00.177]  Our SWAT teams dress like this today.
[02:13:01.058 --> 02:13:08.742]  And it's based around governments carrying out terror attacks, that's how the Emperor comes to power, to blame it on his political enemies and centralize control.
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:10.981]  So, I did something that's pretty funny.
[02:13:11.581 --> 02:13:13.922]  About five years ago, I did it two or three times.
[02:13:13.962 --> 02:13:15.963]  It was very popular on the TV show.
[02:13:16.383 --> 02:13:21.405]  I wore a German black war helmet, a kurzel helmet, with a black ski mask.
[02:13:21.465 --> 02:13:24.246]  And I'd sit up there in a military uniform and black gloves.
[02:13:24.647 --> 02:13:25.967]  I'd say, a special guest is coming.
[02:13:25.987 --> 02:13:26.848]  We're going to go to a tape.
[02:13:27.128 --> 02:13:28.468]  We'll be right back with a special guest.
[02:13:28.908 --> 02:13:34.571]  Then I would dress up in this outfit and sit there and talk about how the New World Order was good and all of our reasons for it.
[02:13:35.996 --> 02:13:37.456]  Why you should go along with it.
[02:13:37.516 --> 02:13:38.737]  You know, being sarcastic.
[02:13:38.957 --> 02:13:41.978]  A little bit of dark satire.
[02:13:42.918 --> 02:13:43.538]  To say the least.
[02:13:43.578 --> 02:13:45.219]  Well, I did this yesterday.
[02:13:46.179 --> 02:13:46.939]  And it's pretty funny.
[02:13:47.199 --> 02:13:50.600]  I went out and got one of the Darth Vader helmets and the Darth Vader outfit.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.541]  And I got up there on TV.
[02:13:53.621 --> 02:13:55.501]  I said, we're going to our special guest.
[02:13:55.541 --> 02:13:57.422]  And then I even did the Emperor.
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.242]  Uh, which I think I did a pretty good job of.
[02:14:00.262 --> 02:14:01.363]  The Darth Vader's not that good.
[02:14:01.403 --> 02:14:03.045]  The Emperor is really good.
[02:14:03.526 --> 02:14:08.010]  And I'm doing this because it'll wake children and young people and Star Wars fans up.
[02:14:08.511 --> 02:14:13.276]  Then when they go read my articles about it, I get into how it's occultic and really, overall, not a good thing.
[02:14:14.157 --> 02:14:19.703]  But, because it's the biggest movie ever, the biggest group of movies ever, because it's affecting...
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:25.463]  Ronald Reagan named the Star Wars Space Weapons Program, a defense program, after it.
[02:14:25.603 --> 02:14:28.205]  It's just so many things in the culture.
[02:14:28.945 --> 02:14:42.153]  That'll be going up, free play for everybody, on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com here in the next... I was told it'd already be up, but it should be up very, very soon.
[02:14:42.193 --> 02:14:46.896]  George, did my wife call yet and tell you if that'd been posted yet?
[02:14:48.559 --> 02:14:51.302]  Okay, because she called during the last break.
[02:14:51.342 --> 02:14:53.163]  I was busy talking to her, Debbie, everybody else.
[02:14:53.644 --> 02:14:55.085]  It's like a war room around here.
[02:14:55.105 --> 02:14:58.308]  She said that one of our great employees was going to be getting that up.
[02:14:58.348 --> 02:14:59.889]  I gave it to him at 8 a.m.
[02:14:59.929 --> 02:15:00.410]  this morning.
[02:15:01.111 --> 02:15:02.352]  I got up at 5 a.m.
[02:15:02.372 --> 02:15:02.852]  this morning.
[02:15:02.872 --> 02:15:04.013]  I've been doing interviews all day.
[02:15:04.173 --> 02:15:06.155]  I'm almost punch drunk.
[02:15:06.275 --> 02:15:07.216]  I've got to get some sleep.
[02:15:07.316 --> 02:15:11.540]  It took a lot of energy to do these little pieces.
[02:15:12.261 --> 02:15:12.921]  I am an actor.
[02:15:14.949 --> 02:15:18.172]  Been in a few things here and there, so it's a pretty good little piece that I did.
[02:15:18.192 --> 02:15:24.617]  I think one of the better emperor impersonations that you'll see out there.
[02:15:24.637 --> 02:15:25.998]  And it's actually a little bit scary.
[02:15:26.559 --> 02:15:28.060]  The Darth Vader is pretty stupid.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:29.801]  And that'll be posted.
[02:15:30.041 --> 02:15:34.325]  I did that for you, and I hope you'll email it out to folks and spread the word on it.
[02:15:35.426 --> 02:15:38.629]  The Patriot Act, they've been meeting in secret trying to reauthorize it.
[02:15:38.729 --> 02:15:40.410]  Won't even have public hearings over it.
[02:15:41.191 --> 02:15:43.813]  And I have a little smattering here of mainstream news articles.
[02:15:44.548 --> 02:15:46.249]  Here's one out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:15:46.309 --> 02:15:46.809]  G.O.P.
[02:15:46.969 --> 02:16:01.054]  aids say new Patriot Act obliges Bush, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is working on a bill that would renew the Patriot Act and expand government powers in the name of fighting terrorism, letting the FBI subpoena records without permission from a judge or grand jury.
[02:16:02.295 --> 02:16:05.116]  Folks, I wrote the analysis on Patriot Act II almost two years ago.
[02:16:06.276 --> 02:16:07.036]  What, January 7th, 2003.
[02:16:09.814 --> 02:16:11.195]  And you need to go read it for yourself.
[02:16:11.355 --> 02:16:12.636]  We have links to the bill itself.
[02:16:12.656 --> 02:16:13.997]  You can just find out what it really says.
[02:16:14.337 --> 02:16:21.662]  Folks, it's sneaking peeks in your house, your business, your corporation, without even a warrant.
[02:16:21.882 --> 02:16:22.882]  That's what it really does.
[02:16:23.222 --> 02:16:25.504]  By the time they whitewash it in the paper, it says this.
[02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:28.246]  Now, I do have the Associated Press admitting it means warrants.
[02:16:28.726 --> 02:16:30.307]  I mean, searches without warrants, period.
[02:16:30.607 --> 02:16:31.988]  And it's non-terror related, folks.
[02:16:32.048 --> 02:16:32.748]  Everything's terror.
[02:16:32.808 --> 02:16:34.509]  So, it's kind of an oxymoron.
[02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:36.871]  You know, type into Google.
[02:16:36.951 --> 02:16:38.492]  Toy Store gets Homeland Security visit.
[02:16:39.389 --> 02:16:41.110]  We had the lady on, it was in the Associated Press.
[02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:44.232]  They said, well, selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes is terrorism.
[02:16:44.953 --> 02:16:47.174]  And I mean, this is, you know, you called and complained too much.
[02:16:47.194 --> 02:16:51.617]  You didn't threaten anybody at the VA, but you called too much, so we're arresting you under Homeland Security.
[02:16:52.337 --> 02:17:06.647]  I mean, you've seen what they've been doing with it, but to read the secret arrest national DNA databases of everybody, but you know, all of this, it's just unbelievable to really look at the facts of
[02:17:07.897 --> 02:17:09.518]  of what this does.
[02:17:10.799 --> 02:17:13.581]  When we return, I want to get into Union Representative U.S.
[02:17:13.642 --> 02:17:17.504]  Groups Killing Journalists, and then I'll get to this article.
[02:17:18.065 --> 02:17:23.349]  Counter-Terror Grants Fund City Cameras Data Mining.
[02:17:23.769 --> 02:17:28.773]  Getting the cities doing it as little nodes of the greater empire.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:38.832]  So we'll cover all this on the other side and then that much-awaited re-airing of that interview with that police chief that's taking the microchip and has no problem with the government making us take it.
[02:17:39.073 --> 02:17:40.314]  You'll hear him in his own words.
[02:17:40.715 --> 02:17:42.317]  PrisonPlanet.tv, check it out.
[02:17:44.722 --> 02:17:45.883]  All water isn't the same.
[02:17:46.144 --> 02:17:51.149]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:17:51.409 --> 02:17:54.012]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:17:54.212 --> 02:18:02.761]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[02:18:44.653 --> 02:18:47.276]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[02:18:47.736 --> 02:18:55.404]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[02:18:55.765 --> 02:18:59.549]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.

[02:19:42.777 --> 02:19:48.920]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:49.381 --> 02:19:57.165]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:57.505 --> 02:20:05.349]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:05.669 --> 02:20:10.430]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:15.451]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:20:15.971 --> 02:20:19.832]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:20:20.332 --> 02:20:21.332]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:25.493]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:20:25.913 --> 02:20:30.314]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:20:30.814 --> 02:20:33.335]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:39.482]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:42.085 --> 02:20:50.676]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:20:50.896 --> 02:21:02.161]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:21:02.382 --> 02:21:05.043]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:05.383 --> 02:21:11.846]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:21:12.006 --> 02:21:13.867]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:21:14.067 --> 02:21:20.050]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:26.013]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:21:48.101 --> 02:21:50.002]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:50.483 --> 02:21:53.304]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.525 --> 02:21:57.427]  An Ebola outbreak has spread to the Congo.
[02:21:57.447 --> 02:22:07.934]  The World Health Organization, who can't trust to do anything, totally corrupt, has confirmed an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the Congo and has already killed nine people.
[02:22:08.738 --> 02:22:12.739]  Scientists unveil a new earthquake forecast system, as reported by the Associated Press.
[02:22:13.119 --> 02:22:18.540]  Californians wondering if tomorrow's forecast will be sunny can now find out if there's also a chance of afternoon tremor.
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:27.062]  Scientists launched a website Wednesday that calculates the probability of strong ground shaking and seismic locations over a 24-hour period.
[02:22:27.102 --> 02:22:29.103]  We have details of where you can look at that forecast map.
[02:22:29.743 --> 02:22:40.226]  On Infowars.com, also an American Free Press article by James Tucker, Bilderberg exposed, Wernell's shadow government uncovered by AFP again, with a lot of new developments.
[02:22:41.246 --> 02:22:53.509]  Well, like the fact that they think oil's going to go to, what, about six bucks a gallon by the time it turns into gasoline, by the time it's refined into gasoline.
[02:22:53.729 --> 02:22:56.349]  So, they're talking about $150 a barrel.
[02:22:56.369 --> 02:22:58.910]  That's a nightmare, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:59.922 --> 02:23:03.603]  Also, the French are being implored to vote yes on the EU pact.
[02:23:04.423 --> 02:23:11.265]  Because if they don't, the whole EU may start falling apart, so all is not well in the kingdom of the New World Order.
[02:23:11.565 --> 02:23:12.666]  Got a bunch of articles here.
[02:23:12.706 --> 02:23:14.006]  This is from WorldNet Daily.
[02:23:14.026 --> 02:23:15.707]  Union representative, U.S.
[02:23:15.727 --> 02:23:20.588]  troops killing journalists, President of Newspaper Guild, echoes claim of ex-CNN executive.
[02:23:21.431 --> 02:23:29.074]  Economic claim that led to the CNN executive Eason Jordan's resigning the president of the 35,000 member Newspaper Guild Association.
[02:23:29.494 --> 02:23:29.755]  U.S.
[02:23:29.795 --> 02:23:32.035]  troops deliberately are killing journalists in Iraq.
[02:23:32.356 --> 02:23:34.356]  Linda Foley speaking Friday in St.
[02:23:34.396 --> 02:23:42.880]  Louis, said the American attacks are focused particularly on Arab journalists according to a tape aired on Sinclair Broadcasting, The Point, a commentary segment by Mark Heyman.
[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:51.662]  The remarks came as Newsweek Magazine continued to manage fallout for a report in its May 9th edition that sparked protest and rioting across the Muslim world resulting in 17 dead.
[02:23:51.702 --> 02:23:53.843]  So they're trying to imply this isn't true.
[02:23:54.163 --> 02:23:58.584]  We have the mainstream articles where the Pentagon said they'd kill journalists if they got in the way.
[02:23:59.525 --> 02:24:04.546]  They pulled up in front of the Baghdad Hotel and aimed at the Reuters floor and blew it up with an Abrams.
[02:24:07.187 --> 02:24:08.247]  I mean, this is a joke!
[02:24:08.789 --> 02:24:13.951]  There's footage of him rolling up to a Reuters camera guy, right up to him as he stands there with his camera and killing him!
[02:24:15.392 --> 02:24:16.372]  I mean, it is sick!
[02:24:16.672 --> 02:24:19.873]  You know how many American journals, British journals have been dying over there?
[02:24:19.893 --> 02:24:21.674]  And I'm tired of the lies!
[02:24:22.414 --> 02:24:23.555]  I mean, it's really getting old!
[02:24:24.508 --> 02:24:31.431]  And they try to mix it in with, oh, and there was a retraction by Newsweek with some other thing, and there wasn't even a real retraction.
[02:24:31.451 --> 02:24:32.951]  They just did it under pressure from the White House.
[02:24:33.652 --> 02:24:39.234]  They've had interrogators quit and say they're doing stuff like this at Gitmo, at Camp X-Ray.
[02:24:40.632 --> 02:24:41.453]  Guantanamo Bay.
[02:24:41.733 --> 02:24:43.315]  They don't go put those guys in the article.
[02:24:43.335 --> 02:24:44.196]  They don't go talk to them.
[02:24:44.216 --> 02:24:45.097]  It's just Newsweek.
[02:24:45.117 --> 02:24:46.919]  Well, the person we talked to might have exaggerated.
[02:24:46.939 --> 02:24:47.560]  We're sorry.
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:48.741]  What does that mean?
[02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:54.627]  They have their fake newspapers retract stuff on purpose because they're government operations.
[02:24:55.668 --> 02:24:56.950]  It's unbelievable.
[02:24:58.007 --> 02:24:59.468]  This interview is great that it's coming up.
[02:24:59.508 --> 02:25:06.713]  We've had a lot of requests to re-air it, and he gets into the Israelis, they're arrested, cheering on top of the rooftop, but that was a side issue concerning 9-11.
[02:25:06.973 --> 02:25:19.862]  It's this big New Jersey police chief, they have police chiefs for the county there, in a county of two million people, and he thinks of how he has a chip and how it's going to be wonderful for all of us to have a chip, and he supports the government making us have a chip.
[02:25:19.902 --> 02:25:20.703]  It's just going to be wonderful.
[02:25:21.163 --> 02:25:24.746]  So that's coming up in the last minute or so here I have left in this segment.
[02:25:25.894 --> 02:25:27.316]  Folks, it's the best film ever made.
[02:25:27.336 --> 02:25:34.223]  It covers the police state, 9-11, and the occult control grid that the globalists are part of, the Nazi connection, the Bushes.
[02:25:34.824 --> 02:25:36.265]  You need to have this film.
[02:25:36.345 --> 02:25:37.326]  It is powerful.
[02:25:37.386 --> 02:25:39.048]  Martial law, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:39.068 --> 02:25:40.950]  9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:25:40.970 --> 02:25:41.911]  Three hours long.

[02:26:37.284 --> 02:26:39.465]  I'm a normal guy that runs my shows on vacation this week.
[02:26:39.505 --> 02:26:44.428]  And George, the engineer up there, has been running my show all week on top of his other duties and doing a great job.
[02:26:45.668 --> 02:26:50.571]  And I want to thank all the affiliates, the sponsors, you, the listeners, the callers, everybody.
[02:26:50.831 --> 02:26:52.832]  My webmasters, my employees, everybody.
[02:26:53.552 --> 02:26:55.873]  Together, we're really putting a dent in the New World Order.
[02:26:56.173 --> 02:26:59.455]  And believe me, if we weren't here doing this, it'd be a lot worse.
[02:27:00.362 --> 02:27:05.849]  If you weren't out there, you the listener, taking action, being the leaders you are, things would be a lot worse.
[02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:06.190]  And hey!
[02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:09.466]  We've added a lot to this big Star Wars article I've written.
[02:27:09.606 --> 02:27:13.428]  Audio clips, video clips, you know, those little music pieces people have put together.
[02:27:14.189 --> 02:27:16.170]  It's going up, the little video piece I did.
[02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:24.475]  That's a great way to reach out to Star Wars fans and children and people and show them the political parallels, which the mainstream media is finally pointing out.
[02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:29.198]  So that'll be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 30 minutes or so.
[02:27:29.758 --> 02:27:30.639]  Alright, stay with us.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:36.706]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.608 --> 02:27:40.293]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.794 --> 02:27:51.259]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:55.944]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:56.164 --> 02:28:03.211]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:03.591 --> 02:28:09.697]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:09.837 --> 02:28:11.058]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:11.378 --> 02:28:14.342]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:14.483 --> 02:28:16.505]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:16.826 --> 02:28:24.056]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:24.356 --> 02:28:27.741]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:49.467]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:49.607 --> 02:28:55.773]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:56.053 --> 02:29:04.442]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:04.722 --> 02:29:11.769]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:16.895]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:17.095 --> 02:29:22.500]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:22.841 --> 02:29:25.884]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:30:50.783 --> 02:30:53.603]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.584 --> 02:31:01.725]  Alright folks, it's real talk radio, issues of real significance, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas.
[02:31:02.265 --> 02:31:12.467]  Blasting out across the nation on dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations, simulcasting a global shortwave during the day at 9.985, third hour 9.975, at night 3210 from 9 to midnight, and of course the internet.
[02:31:17.063 --> 02:31:18.524]  at GCNlive.com.
[02:31:19.684 --> 02:31:21.766]  We've got Congressman Ron Paul confirmed.
[02:31:21.786 --> 02:31:34.052]  He was floating today, depending on when he would be coming on, to talk about the new REAL ID Act and analyze it with us, what's really in the legislation that Bush is due to sign sometime next week, perhaps as early as this Friday.
[02:31:34.432 --> 02:31:38.454]  That's going to be, he'll be with us for 30 minutes, coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[02:31:39.115 --> 02:31:43.537]  And we have Jews of Preservation of Firearms Ownership joining us tomorrow
[02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:47.370]  They give us updates on the Second Amendment and a bunch of other key issues.
[02:31:47.530 --> 02:31:49.871]  I am really, it's exciting to get this guest on.
[02:31:49.911 --> 02:31:50.992]  This is an interesting story.
[02:31:51.012 --> 02:31:57.094]  It was covered by Business Wire, Associated Press, you name it, back on April 22nd.
[02:31:57.674 --> 02:32:07.838]  Bergen County Chief of Police, they have a Chief of Police for the county, Jack Schmidig, leaves regional rollout of Verichip by receiving a Verichip.
[02:32:08.553 --> 02:32:16.596]  Now, remember last year, the Mexican Attorney General told 160 plus of his employees, and it was going to be even more, that they had to take this microchip.
[02:32:16.916 --> 02:32:18.136]  It'll get into secure areas.
[02:32:18.576 --> 02:32:20.177]  The Chief is not making his employees take it.
[02:32:20.517 --> 02:32:21.997]  Well, I guess he might be recommending it.
[02:32:22.657 --> 02:32:28.519]  But joining us to talk about this important issue is Chief Jack Kashmetic.
[02:32:29.159 --> 02:32:30.560]  Chief, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:31.320]  Thank you.
[02:32:32.601 --> 02:32:36.482]  Tell us how this happened, why you got the idea, what you've done, you've got the chip.
[02:32:36.502 --> 02:32:37.022]  Tell us about it.
[02:32:37.905 --> 02:32:44.126]  All right, it started with a dear friend of mine, a Mr. Nicholas Minacucci, who's the founder of the Molly Foundation.
[02:32:44.666 --> 02:32:46.947]  It's a foundation for diabetes research.
[02:32:47.707 --> 02:32:57.409]  His daughter, Molly, has had the disease for 20 years, and I'm a member of the Board of Trustees on the Molly Foundation.
[02:32:58.589 --> 02:33:05.070]  He, Mr. Minacucci, came up with the idea through the Verichip Company of implanting a chip
[02:33:06.521 --> 02:33:07.561]  Mine is in my arm.
[02:33:07.621 --> 02:33:17.228]  I don't know if it can be located anywhere else, but it is readily available to obtain your medical information.
[02:33:17.928 --> 02:33:20.870]  When you have the chip implanted, they ask you a series of questions.
[02:33:20.970 --> 02:33:23.132]  Are you allergic to anything next of kin?
[02:33:23.772 --> 02:33:25.433]  Who do you want to have this information?
[02:33:25.573 --> 02:33:27.094]  All kinds of series of questions.
[02:33:27.855 --> 02:33:34.439]  And by scanning the chip in my arm, they have immediate access to my medical history.
[02:33:35.026 --> 02:33:36.086]  When were you in Plangent?
[02:33:36.827 --> 02:33:38.127]  Uh, April 12th.
[02:33:40.148 --> 02:33:41.648]  And it got a lot of attention.
[02:33:41.668 --> 02:33:43.769]  Are you aware of what the Mexican Attorney General did?
[02:33:43.789 --> 02:33:45.029]  No, not at all.
[02:33:46.289 --> 02:33:51.231]  Yeah, it's getting big and also I've heard from special forces that some of them have been getting the chip.
[02:33:52.117 --> 02:33:59.259]  I can tell you, and maybe a side light to this, my German Shepherd had the chip implanted for identification.
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:01.600]  Mine isn't for identification.
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:07.902]  It's not like a tracking device that emits a transponder that's going to follow you around.
[02:34:09.323 --> 02:34:19.866]  The protocol here in New Jersey will be if you're admitted to a hospital and for some reason you're incapacitated and can't provide that information, they can scan that chip in your arm
[02:34:20.535 --> 02:34:27.219]  And through the computer, access your medical history, so they potentially can find out what's wrong with you.
[02:34:27.459 --> 02:34:42.769]  Well, Applied Digital has now bought the software in a company dealing with cell towers, and they're saying with a bigger chip, they're going to be able, since you brought that up with RFID, Radio Frequency Identification Devices, to use it as a tracking system.
[02:34:42.789 --> 02:34:43.970]  Were you aware of that?
[02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:49.794]  No, but how big must that chip be to follow you around or have RF signals
[02:34:50.652 --> 02:34:53.153]  Well, the chip I have in my arm is about the size of a grain of rice.
[02:35:09.881 --> 02:35:10.982]  I've seen the current chip.
[02:35:11.282 --> 02:35:13.283]  We've interviewed the scientists that invented it.
[02:35:13.303 --> 02:35:15.945]  We've interviewed the CEO a few years ago.
[02:35:16.025 --> 02:35:17.886]  We've interviewed the Chipson family.
[02:35:18.426 --> 02:35:22.628]  You know, the family that the Jacobsons, I believe, that got the chip.
[02:35:23.769 --> 02:35:27.391]  But what do the officers under your command think about this?
[02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:32.274]  To be honest with you, I don't think it's gotten the recognition that it should have.
[02:35:32.354 --> 02:35:36.416]  I think it's an exceptional idea, and I know of one other officer
[02:35:37.034 --> 02:35:52.440]  Who had the chip implanted, and my secretary, who's hypoglycemic, and this initially started here as a result of the diabetes research and the foundation, the Molly Foundation, she's made an appointment to have the chip implanted also.
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:57.181]  Well, they've got the chipmobiles, these, uh, have you seen those?
[02:35:57.561 --> 02:36:01.523]  No, this is, we're in the very early stages of it here in New Jersey.
[02:36:01.663 --> 02:36:04.504]  I don't know what any other venue
[02:36:05.385 --> 02:36:11.128]  It is providing, or... Well, I'm just thinking, Bear Chip has these chipmobiles that go around chipping, and they have Mr. Chip.
[02:36:12.009 --> 02:36:12.849]  You haven't heard about that?
[02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.490]  No.
[02:36:14.390 --> 02:36:21.634]  Well, yeah, they gave the readers of some hospitals in Florida, but only a few.
[02:36:21.654 --> 02:36:24.716]  I mean, have they given readers to the hospitals in New Jersey?
[02:36:25.437 --> 02:36:28.739]  There's only one hospital in the state, and that's in our county doing it right now.
[02:36:32.221 --> 02:36:32.741]  Interesting.
[02:36:33.743 --> 02:36:42.546]  Well, did you hear about in Miami and also in Spain and now Germany and England and other areas, the same chip to get into the VIP area?
[02:36:44.206 --> 02:36:47.987]  No, again, they scan your arm to get into select areas.
[02:36:49.047 --> 02:37:01.291]  Potentially down the line, I could see limited access events like maybe an inauguration ball or something like that for the president where you might need one of these to get in, but I think we're way ahead of ourselves.
[02:37:02.702 --> 02:37:07.725]  Were you approached by Verichip to do this, or did you and your friend just spontaneously want to get a chip?
[02:37:08.245 --> 02:37:20.933]  I wanted it, and while I'm on the board of trustees for that foundation, the information was brought to a trustee meeting, and I thought it was an exceptional idea, and I said, put me in.
[02:37:21.454 --> 02:37:24.896]  And I had the, like I said, I had the chip implanted.
[02:37:25.504 --> 02:37:26.345]  The 12th of April.
[02:37:26.865 --> 02:37:28.807]  And there's no residual effects.
[02:37:29.247 --> 02:37:32.890]  So are you waiting then for the readers to get into local hospitals?
[02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:35.272]  Because what use will it be if they're not in the local hospitals?
[02:37:35.292 --> 02:37:35.853]  Well, that's true.
[02:37:35.933 --> 02:37:36.953]  It's going to take some time.
[02:37:37.194 --> 02:37:38.995]  But I'm on the cutting edge.
[02:37:39.275 --> 02:37:41.998]  Oh, is your foundation lobbying the hospital?
[02:37:42.258 --> 02:37:42.478]  Yes.
[02:37:44.339 --> 02:37:44.960]  All hospitals.
[02:37:45.615 --> 02:37:59.502]  You know, we found a lot of the people like the Jacobsons and others and some of the hospitals that accepted the chip readers in the Miami and Palm Beach area actually had employees there that were investors or even part of Applied Digital and that's why they were doing this.
[02:38:00.202 --> 02:38:01.743]  Are you an investor in Applied Digital?
[02:38:02.043 --> 02:38:02.423]  Not at all.
[02:38:02.443 --> 02:38:04.604]  I have no stock in this at all.
[02:38:04.864 --> 02:38:09.626]  What about, I mean I'm just curious, what about the individual that's on the foundation with you?
[02:38:10.587 --> 02:38:12.708]  The president of the foundation, Mr. Minacucci?
[02:38:12.868 --> 02:38:13.068]  Yes.
[02:38:13.248 --> 02:38:14.829]  I don't believe he's the stockholder either.
[02:38:15.396 --> 02:38:20.979]  So basically somebody just approached the foundation and you guys said, hey, this is a good medical bracelet basically implanted.
[02:38:21.319 --> 02:38:21.799]  Absolutely.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.181]  That was my logic behind getting mine.
[02:38:28.211 --> 02:38:31.632]  I'm going to be honest with you on my views of this.
[02:38:31.652 --> 02:38:32.012]  Sure.
[02:38:32.172 --> 02:38:34.013]  You know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:38:34.033 --> 02:38:35.853]  For people like you, this sounds good.
[02:38:35.873 --> 02:38:39.534]  Hey, you can lose a medical alert bracelet.
[02:38:40.515 --> 02:38:42.735]  Who wants a tattoo with all your data on it?
[02:38:43.135 --> 02:38:43.756]  This sounds good.
[02:38:43.776 --> 02:38:47.877]  Or for people with Alzheimer's, or now California Bureau of Prisons signed a contract.
[02:38:48.317 --> 02:38:51.938]  Reuters reported it, but then it got dropped the public screening to implant prisoners.
[02:38:52.918 --> 02:38:54.099]  Maximum Security Presidents.
[02:38:54.259 --> 02:38:54.979]  That was two years ago.
[02:38:54.999 --> 02:38:55.680]  That got cancelled.
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:01.763]  There's all these arguments for it, but when you go on down the road, it sounds like revelations.
[02:39:01.823 --> 02:39:04.865]  I mean, people getting the microchip and all this.
[02:39:04.925 --> 02:39:15.010]  And Applied Digital says that... I've had Applied Digital executives on, and they say, yes, we'll have this for buy and selling, and everyone will, you know, in the future, take the chip.
[02:39:15.491 --> 02:39:16.371]  I mean, they've said it.
[02:39:16.411 --> 02:39:17.792]  I've got the transcripts on my website.
[02:39:18.607 --> 02:39:20.749]  Well, right now I think that's a matter of opinion.
[02:39:20.769 --> 02:39:22.850]  I don't believe it's Big Brother watching me.
[02:39:23.371 --> 02:39:24.812]  But I'm talking about the company itself.
[02:39:24.832 --> 02:39:32.317]  I mean, you can type in, Applied Digital says it'll be used for tracking, it'll be used for prisoners, Applied Digital will be used for cashless transactions.
[02:39:32.617 --> 02:39:34.719]  Type it into Google, Chief, and you'll find it.
[02:39:35.559 --> 02:39:38.421]  Well, I'm sure those potentials are there.
[02:39:39.062 --> 02:39:47.008]  My intention was to protect my life, hopefully, if something happens to me where I'm incapacitated and I get
[02:39:48.399 --> 02:39:55.264]  Taken to a hospital, I want people to know that I'm not allergic to penicillin.
[02:39:55.805 --> 02:39:57.346]  My next of kin is my wife.
[02:39:57.426 --> 02:39:58.567]  Contact her immediately.
[02:39:58.847 --> 02:40:00.068]  Things like that.
[02:40:00.088 --> 02:40:02.229]  That's what I was looking at it for.
[02:40:02.370 --> 02:40:07.053]  Well, if you were in a car wreck, wouldn't they know all that from your car and your plates?
[02:40:07.253 --> 02:40:08.714]  Potentially, sure.
[02:40:08.734 --> 02:40:13.398]  I think it's a great backup system.
[02:40:14.483 --> 02:40:35.870]  Another thing is what what sold us on some of this was the um... especially for the foundation if a person goes into diabetic shock sometimes they can look like they're drunk and you know people don't understand what... No, there have been a lot of cases of police thinking somebody's resisting when they're in the shock, yeah, and then tasering them and... Yeah, all of that stuff.
[02:40:35.930 --> 02:40:39.531]  So if you, you know, if you can get that scan you know that this person got
[02:40:41.761 --> 02:40:43.327]  A propensity towards diabetes is a problem.
[02:40:48.351 --> 02:40:48.571]  Yes.
[02:40:49.111 --> 02:40:51.593]  I mean, that's been in Time, Newsweek, it's USA Today.
[02:40:51.973 --> 02:40:54.254]  In Texas, it's about to pass the legislature.
[02:40:54.715 --> 02:41:00.618]  Next year, with our inspection stickers, we'll all get cracker chips that are very small, that are read by radio readers.
[02:41:01.058 --> 02:41:02.919]  We're going to be taxed by the mile down the road.
[02:41:02.979 --> 02:41:09.863]  I mean, you see how this chipping of all the products, RFID, the chipping of people, I mean, it is going to the extreme right away.
[02:41:10.083 --> 02:41:15.046]  In New Jersey, we have a system called EasyPass, and it gets you down a New Jersey turnpike,
[02:41:15.786 --> 02:41:16.327]  We're good to go.
[02:41:31.005 --> 02:41:39.893]  Right now it's almost 12.45 here at 12.45 I pass through exit 159 on the Garden State Parkway and that information comes to you.
[02:41:39.973 --> 02:41:44.698]  Man, going across from New York to you guys when I was there this summer, it was like seven smackers.
[02:41:45.038 --> 02:41:49.562]  Oh yeah, and the E-ZPass works on the George Washington Bridge.
[02:41:49.602 --> 02:41:51.564]  Why should we turn all our roads into this?
[02:41:51.864 --> 02:41:56.369]  And now it's not going to be the size of a tiny matchbox.
[02:41:56.809 --> 02:42:01.032]  Well, I've got that little bitty chip, but I don't see a downside for me and those people who are looking at Big Brother.
[02:42:01.052 --> 02:42:01.873]  I don't find that.
[02:42:23.484 --> 02:42:25.125]  Well, I mean, that's what I find.
[02:42:25.765 --> 02:42:28.927]  I want to shift gears just because a listener emailed this to me this morning.
[02:42:29.308 --> 02:42:33.430]  This is not why I got you on the show, but I find it incredibly intriguing.
[02:42:33.490 --> 02:42:42.876]  And again, my friends, we're talking to the chief of police in the county of Bergen in New Jersey.
[02:42:42.896 --> 02:42:46.919]  And he's taken the implantable microchip, but I was sent this by several listeners.
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:49.661]  It's still a hot topic.
[02:42:50.102 --> 02:42:54.065]  I have Fox News here in front of me, I have the New York Post, and I have the Bergen Record.
[02:42:54.125 --> 02:42:55.406]  Bergen Record, the town you're in.
[02:42:56.287 --> 02:43:03.614]  Five men detained as suspected conspirators by a Palo Lima staff writer.
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:05.861]  And in here, it's got a quote from you.
[02:43:06.261 --> 02:43:11.705]  We got an alert to be on the lookout for a white Chevrolet van with New Jersey registration and writing on the side.
[02:43:11.725 --> 02:43:12.806]  Oh, that was during 9-11.
[02:43:12.846 --> 02:43:14.007]  No, no, this is a totally separate issue.
[02:43:14.027 --> 02:43:15.828]  This is interesting.
[02:43:15.928 --> 02:43:21.652]  Suspicious Middle Easterners cheered terror attack from moving van, and then it turned out in Fox News that it was Israelis.
[02:43:22.033 --> 02:43:23.414]  What actually happened with that, sir?
[02:43:24.675 --> 02:43:26.316]  We turned those people over to the FBI.
[02:43:26.336 --> 02:43:27.937]  They were thoroughly checked out and released.
[02:43:28.918 --> 02:43:30.659]  No charges were ever filed against those people.
[02:43:31.536 --> 02:43:35.078]  But what about the witnesses that said they saw him jumping up and cheering and videotaping?
[02:43:36.858 --> 02:43:38.599]  That was the information reported to us.
[02:43:38.659 --> 02:43:40.960]  We couldn't confirm through the witnesses.
[02:43:40.980 --> 02:43:42.421]  No one would identify themselves.
[02:43:42.461 --> 02:43:49.624]  They said that they saw this white van with several people applauding or cheering the attack on the Trade Center.
[02:43:49.824 --> 02:43:54.487]  And when we finally found the van, located the van, no one would step forward to
[02:43:55.507 --> 02:44:00.952]  I'm not sure I don't remember all the details of that particular case and like I said when we first
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:20.743]  Located the van, we notified the FBI and they came and scooped them up.
[02:44:20.844 --> 02:44:21.404]  How did that happen?
[02:44:21.424 --> 02:44:22.204]  You pulled them over?
[02:44:22.524 --> 02:44:22.925]  What happened?
[02:44:22.945 --> 02:44:27.867]  We had to be on the lookout for a particular type of van.
[02:44:28.328 --> 02:44:30.629]  One of my patrol officers found it, located it.
[02:44:31.509 --> 02:44:39.894]  We pulled them over, we detained them, and then we notified the state police and the FBI who were working at Joint Terrorism Task Force.
[02:44:40.484 --> 02:44:43.667]  Were you aware of the hundreds of Israeli art students that were really spies?
[02:44:44.408 --> 02:44:46.310]  And they were quote, following Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:46.350 --> 02:44:48.512]  This was even on Fox News and the Associated Press.
[02:44:49.053 --> 02:44:52.256]  And then they grabbed them and then they were ordered to release them to Israel.
[02:44:52.276 --> 02:44:52.957]  Did you hear about that?
[02:44:53.077 --> 02:44:55.540]  No.
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:57.902]  Did they have any video cameras on them?
[02:44:58.142 --> 02:45:00.685]  And then secondarily, how many days after 9-11 was this arrest?
[02:45:03.602 --> 02:45:06.643]  It was, I believe it occurred the night of 9-11.
[02:45:06.923 --> 02:45:07.544]  I'm not sure.
[02:45:07.564 --> 02:45:09.984]  Did you find any video cameras on him?
[02:45:10.004 --> 02:45:10.265]  No.
[02:45:10.305 --> 02:45:21.969]  I don't recall any video cameras on him, but like I said, being in the administrative position, I don't do the road work anymore, and it gets passed down to my detective captain, and unfortunately he's not here today.
[02:45:23.249 --> 02:45:23.790]  What's his name?
[02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:25.830]  Captain Kevin Hartnett.
[02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.751]  H-A-R-T-N-E-T.
[02:45:28.286 --> 02:45:29.966]  Can I get Kevin Partman on about that?
[02:45:30.486 --> 02:45:32.387]  Um, if he's willing to come on, I'm sure.
[02:45:32.427 --> 02:45:34.267]  I don't have an objection to speaking with the media.
[02:45:34.487 --> 02:45:37.608]  Well, this just keeps coming up over and over again.
[02:45:37.648 --> 02:45:39.728]  Well, it was a hot-button issue.
[02:45:39.808 --> 02:45:50.990]  After 9-11, they wanted any kind of attention they could get, and they kept re-running and repeating those catchphrases there.
[02:45:51.370 --> 02:45:55.691]  And if I Google my own name, it comes up with that quote about four or five times.
[02:45:58.556 --> 02:46:00.957]  But, I mean, it's true though that they wouldn't talk to you.
[02:46:01.277 --> 02:46:03.138]  That shows some pretty serious training.
[02:46:04.738 --> 02:46:05.919]  How many people do you pull over?
[02:46:06.339 --> 02:46:07.159]  How many were arrested?
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.760]  I thought there were three or four, but I'm not sure.
[02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:11.641]  I mean, to have four people that none of them talk?
[02:46:11.681 --> 02:46:14.342]  Boy, that's pretty, uh... I mean, do you see that a lot?
[02:46:15.142 --> 02:46:15.282]  No.
[02:46:15.763 --> 02:46:16.763]  Yeah, you don't see that a lot, do you?
[02:46:18.416 --> 02:46:30.041]  I mean, you're usually, according to criminology, I mean, I took a little bit of it in college, I don't have a degree in it, but when you end up with one person that won't talk, you end up with two, three, four, usually when you end up with four people, it means there's some pretty serious training going on.
[02:46:30.902 --> 02:46:44.228]  Once again, I can't, I don't know their background, it was, we received some information, we stopped them, and then we turned them over to people more interested in
[02:46:45.418 --> 02:46:49.482]  How long did they interrogate?
[02:46:49.622 --> 02:46:50.703]  How long did you interrogate?
[02:46:52.024 --> 02:46:53.625]  We didn't participate in the interrogation.
[02:46:54.025 --> 02:46:55.847]  They were turned over to the state police.
[02:46:55.867 --> 02:46:58.509]  Well, we talked to them at the road stop.
[02:47:00.251 --> 02:47:03.373]  And then were they brought into the jail, or were they just given right over to the FBI?
[02:47:03.633 --> 02:47:07.056]  I think they were taken to the FBI's field office in Newark, but I'm not sure.
[02:47:07.076 --> 02:47:07.877]  What did the FBI say?
[02:47:08.497 --> 02:47:08.838]  I don't know.
[02:47:09.838 --> 02:47:11.139]  Have you ever asked them what came of it?
[02:47:12.788 --> 02:47:17.671]  Mr. Jones, I'm... You know, you're talking... We started on one subject, now we're on another.
[02:47:18.331 --> 02:47:22.974]  I know, but I mean, I... I mean, I didn't put two and two together when I saw your name get the microchip.
[02:47:23.415 --> 02:47:27.037]  And then, uh, I start getting emails about it, and I go, yeah, I mean, I remember this article.
[02:47:27.077 --> 02:47:28.798]  I mean, it's... it's an interesting topic.
[02:47:29.018 --> 02:47:33.421]  This was... this was a very interesting day, September 11, 2001.
[02:47:34.321 --> 02:47:37.983]  And a lot of... Did you see the tower smoking when it happened?
[02:47:38.324 --> 02:47:38.824]  Absolutely.
[02:47:38.984 --> 02:47:39.644]  What was that like?
[02:47:39.664 --> 02:47:40.605]  It was terrible.
[02:47:41.758 --> 02:47:42.398]  It was terrible.
[02:47:42.638 --> 02:47:44.199]  Well, I wish we could control our borders.
[02:47:44.259 --> 02:47:45.259]  That might keep us safe.
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.481]  You'll have to talk to another agency on that.
[02:47:50.541 --> 02:47:50.881]  No, I know.
[02:47:50.901 --> 02:47:53.002]  You're not even near the border, so I understand that.
[02:47:53.522 --> 02:47:54.622]  I'm on the border with New York.
[02:47:55.062 --> 02:47:55.682]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:47:56.743 --> 02:48:00.044]  Well, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:48:00.991 --> 02:48:07.134]  And I hope that you wake up and see the real ramifications of the implantable microchip.
[02:48:07.534 --> 02:48:13.617]  Will you say no to the chip if in ten years the government says you've got to use this for identification when you pay for goods and services?
[02:48:13.937 --> 02:48:14.097]  No.
[02:48:15.778 --> 02:48:16.639]  You won't go along with that?
[02:48:17.059 --> 02:48:19.500]  No, I'd go along with it, sure.
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:27.344]  Rather than carry my credit cards, they want to put all my information on my chip and as I walk out the grocery store with a loaf of bread and a quart of milk, you know, they just
[02:48:28.504 --> 02:48:29.084]  Say what, Chief?
[02:48:29.124 --> 02:48:29.705]  We gotta break.
[02:48:29.785 --> 02:48:30.705]  Quick three-minute break.
[02:48:30.766 --> 02:48:31.166]  Stay there.
[02:48:31.886 --> 02:48:33.407]  Just do five more minutes with us.
[02:48:34.868 --> 02:48:36.629]  This is just amazing information.
[02:48:37.170 --> 02:48:37.570]  Stay with us.
[02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:40.152]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our guest.
[02:48:44.094 --> 02:48:46.976]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:47.697 --> 02:48:48.978]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:49.178 --> 02:48:54.921]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:55.201 --> 02:49:00.464]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:00.744 --> 02:49:04.866]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:05.046 --> 02:49:08.850]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:09.111 --> 02:49:13.756]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:13.856 --> 02:49:20.103]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.143 --> 02:49:21.965]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:40.181 --> 02:49:42.263]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:42.927 --> 02:49:50.451]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:50.731 --> 02:50:01.637]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:03.198 --> 02:50:07.302]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:07.642 --> 02:50:18.112]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:18.393 --> 02:50:18.893]  That's right!
[02:50:19.073 --> 02:50:26.180]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[02:50:44.685 --> 02:50:45.025]  I think so.

[02:51:46.162 --> 02:51:52.205]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:52.805 --> 02:51:55.767]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.548 --> 02:51:58.088]  That's right!
[02:51:59.869 --> 02:52:01.189]  Fighting the culture war.
[02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:09.293]  Right here my friend, just a few minutes left with the county police chief up there in Bergen County.
[02:52:11.291 --> 02:52:12.212]  The music was playing, folks.
[02:52:12.232 --> 02:52:13.233]  You might not have heard what you said.
[02:52:13.253 --> 02:52:14.796]  I want to state that again for the record.
[02:52:15.457 --> 02:52:19.562]  I said if in ten years the Army documents say this is the plan, it will be by 2020.
[02:52:19.843 --> 02:52:24.550]  That's the January 1st, 2000 report by the Army War College.
[02:52:25.777 --> 02:52:29.540]  Then everybody's going to have a chip, and I've had the CEO, again, on a Verichip.
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:34.043]  That's the plan I've had their distributors on from Spain, from Miami.
[02:52:34.443 --> 02:52:35.224]  They've said the same thing.
[02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:37.526]  We're all going to have chips, and we're going to buy and sell these.
[02:52:38.126 --> 02:52:46.692]  And the Chief was saying he's not for Big Brother, he's not worried about Big Brother, but then I said, in ten years if they say you've got to use this to buy and sell, you said, you're happy with that, Chief.
[02:52:46.873 --> 02:52:49.575]  I wouldn't object to it.
[02:52:49.915 --> 02:52:53.758]  I mean, if they say we have to take the chip, you wouldn't object?
[02:52:54.078 --> 02:52:54.158]  No.
[02:52:55.991 --> 02:53:13.745]  No, if I, like I said before the break, if I went into a grocery store and bought a loaf of bread and a quart of milk and walked out and read my chip and debited my bank account, I'd work with you.
[02:53:13.865 --> 02:53:14.886]  I don't have a problem with that.
[02:53:14.906 --> 02:53:16.347]  Chief, it's either two separate things.
[02:53:17.617 --> 02:53:20.639]  You're a really nice guy who totally trusts the government and society.
[02:53:21.019 --> 02:53:22.740]  I am the government, okay?
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:28.943]  By trusting the government, you bet your life I trust the government because I am part of government.
[02:53:30.003 --> 02:53:32.524]  Either it's that, you're naive, or you're demon possessed.
[02:53:32.544 --> 02:53:35.986]  Well, if you want to think that I'm naive, that's certainly your opinion.
[02:53:37.839 --> 02:53:41.283]  Well, Chief, I appreciate you coming on the show, but I totally disagree with you.
[02:53:41.343 --> 02:53:42.924]  Well, you can, and that's your right.
[02:53:43.024 --> 02:53:43.745]  Well, wait a minute!
[02:53:43.785 --> 02:53:50.352]  You're going to make me, so the government says, everybody's got to get chipped ten years from now, and it's the law, you'll start arresting people that don't have it.
[02:53:52.006 --> 02:53:53.187]  I won't be here ten years from now.
[02:53:53.207 --> 02:53:53.947]  How does that sound?
[02:53:54.307 --> 02:53:58.969]  I've got a short time to go before I take my retirement and leave.
[02:53:59.109 --> 02:54:00.509]  People look under rocks for scary things too.
[02:54:10.357 --> 02:54:16.703]  The Founding Fathers Chief said that we should not trust our government, we should keep it small, keep control of it.
[02:54:16.723 --> 02:54:20.786]  You're just saying, I am the government, I trust it, and if they say we've got to have chips, we've got to have them.
[02:54:21.066 --> 02:54:21.807]  Is that my opinion?
[02:54:22.427 --> 02:54:22.648]  Yes.
[02:54:22.988 --> 02:54:23.608]  Well, then thank you.
[02:54:23.989 --> 02:54:25.210]  No, you just said that, sir.
[02:54:25.310 --> 02:54:26.050]  Exactly.
[02:54:26.611 --> 02:54:32.416]  And it's my opinion, and I'm entitled to my opinion, and Mr. Jones, you're entitled to yours, and I think, sir, that
[02:54:33.616 --> 02:54:34.997]  It was nice of you to have me on.
[02:54:35.037 --> 02:54:35.777]  Are you a Christian?
[02:54:36.117 --> 02:54:36.858]  Yes, I am.
[02:54:37.338 --> 02:54:42.941]  And you have to have this mark to buy and sell, but you're saying if that happens you don't have a problem with it?
[02:54:43.501 --> 02:54:43.841]  I don't.
[02:54:45.822 --> 02:54:48.563]  So, maybe you are just naive.
[02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:50.204]  Hey, that's your opinion too.
[02:54:50.524 --> 02:54:52.405]  I'm not picking up from you that you're evil.
[02:54:53.126 --> 02:54:53.546]  I am not evil.
[02:54:54.927 --> 02:54:55.948]  I don't pick that up from you.
[02:54:55.988 --> 02:54:58.751]  I pick it up that you're just totally trusting and naive, chief.
[02:54:59.191 --> 02:55:02.835]  Okay, uh, Mr. Jones, I think your interview with me is over.
[02:55:02.975 --> 02:55:04.937]  Hey, Bayo Condios, I'm gonna pray for you.
[02:55:05.297 --> 02:55:06.098]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:06.178 --> 02:55:06.759]  Go with God.
[02:55:06.859 --> 02:55:07.239]  Take care.
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:09.321]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:09.341 --> 02:55:11.023]  That's how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[02:55:11.243 --> 02:55:12.404]  We gotta have a transcript of that.
[02:55:12.444 --> 02:55:16.105]  That is the all-time most out of control, in your face.
[02:55:16.165 --> 02:55:16.585]  You see?
[02:55:16.906 --> 02:55:17.866]  You see what we're facing?
[02:55:18.086 --> 02:55:19.467]  You understand what we're facing now?
[02:55:19.847 --> 02:55:21.508]  Get the new film, Martial Law, folks.
[02:55:21.568 --> 02:55:22.388]  Do not delay.
[02:55:22.468 --> 02:55:23.689]  Expose all of this.
[02:55:23.729 --> 02:55:24.249]  Expose 9-11.
[02:55:24.509 --> 02:55:25.569]  Expose the police state.
[02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:26.950]  Expose who controls it.
[02:55:26.970 --> 02:55:26.950]  $24.95.
[02:55:27.550 --> 02:55:27.971]  Second copy, $19.95.
[02:55:28.011 --> 02:55:28.231]  Third copy, $16.95.
[02:55:28.291 --> 02:55:28.671]  Fourth copy, $14.95.
[02:55:28.711 --> 02:55:29.111]  Fifth copy, $14.
[02:55:36.204 --> 02:55:38.346]  Or buy one copy and make copies and get them out to people.
[02:55:38.406 --> 02:55:40.068]  It's my all-time most powerful film.
[02:55:40.108 --> 02:55:42.130]  Get it and expose this insanity now.
[02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:43.691]  We're the normal people.
[02:55:43.731 --> 02:55:45.713]  They are the ones that are just off their rockers.
[02:55:45.733 --> 02:55:46.393]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:46.414 --> 02:55:50.037]  888-253-3139 to get the new film or any of my great films.
[02:55:50.057 --> 02:55:52.279]  Everybody else is raising prizes.
[02:55:52.579 --> 02:55:54.901]  We're slashing prizes on the films.
[02:55:55.262 --> 02:55:55.742]  All of them.
[02:56:01.932 --> 02:56:03.313]  We just want to get the information out.
[02:56:03.333 --> 02:56:12.258]  888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.tv right now to sign up online and get a monthly or yearly subscription, 15 cents a day.
[02:56:12.778 --> 02:56:16.561]  All my films, other films, weekly TV reports, audio interviews, this one will be there.
[02:56:16.841 --> 02:56:18.442]  prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:18.522 --> 02:56:19.102]  Do not wait.
[02:56:19.122 --> 02:56:20.583]  Get the film and stand up against this.
[02:56:21.483 --> 02:56:24.185]  The majority of us, 98% in major polls, are against the chip.
[02:56:24.445 --> 02:56:26.086]  But the 2% is in power.
[02:56:26.626 --> 02:56:27.947]  And they think it's completely normal.
[02:56:27.967 --> 02:56:28.908]  They're totally deceived.
[02:56:29.308 --> 02:56:30.889]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[02:56:33.676 --> 02:56:34.245]  Terrible!
