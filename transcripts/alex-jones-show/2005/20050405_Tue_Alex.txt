[00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.374]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:08.074]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:09.915]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.396]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:12.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:17.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:22.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.602]  Tuesday, my friends, the fifth day of April, 2005,
[00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:34.745]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.966]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.966]  We're going to have wide open phones again today.
[00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.147]  We'll go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:57.929]  Any issue, any topic, any news item, any question, comment, if you disagree with me, you agree with something I've said, some propaganda you witnessed on television, or in your newspaper, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:14.792]  1-800-259-9231 Well my friends, yesterday we posted this on InfoWars.com under the Big Brother section.
[00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:30.539]  For some reason I missed it and didn't cover it, but a lot of listeners emailed me concerning it so I did become aware of it last night and I do have it here in front of me today and it is very ominous
[00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:39.188]  And it shows us just exactly what our new lives are going to be like here in the global plantation.
[00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:53.451]  And I told one of the webmasters for InfoWars.com to repost this at the top of the main page as one of the four tiles that are our top stories.
[00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:58.652]  Yes, my friends, they're going to put RFID
[00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:16.659]  In your inspection stickers, in the stickers you get for your car, or toll roads in Texas, and they're going to turn all the roads, basically all the state roads, all the major roads, into toll roads.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.485]  Now, I know we've been talking about this for many, many, many, many years, because I've seen the federal plans.
[00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.672]  You see, now it's not, I've seen federal plans, here are the federal plans.
[00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:32.094]  It's, here's the legislation, they're doing it.
[00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:38.137]  And I want to talk about this, because it illustrates so many things.
[00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:45.361]  I want to take my time on this, and go over it for about five minutes, when we get back on the other side.
[00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:50.965]  And then we'll plunge into your phone calls, and there's a bunch of other news too.
[00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:53.346]  All very important.
[00:02:54.491 --> 00:03:02.496]  Parents are very upset about a mandatory vaccination database that the different states are setting up.
[00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:04.617]  One of them, of course, Colorado.
[00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:10.380]  And then on the heels of that, it'll be illegal not to take all the different vaccines they order you to take.
[00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:17.984]  Over a hundred new vaccines deployed a year, and they'll just tell you that your basic day will be filled with injections.
[00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:18.825]  I'm not joking.
[00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.148]  I'm not kidding, folks, okay?
[00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.190]  It'll be in the food you eat.
[00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.671]  This will be the new freedom.
[00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:31.075]  And they say these vaccines will actually change your brain chemistry makeup.
[00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:34.598]  Permanent lobotomies.
[00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.520]  Specific lobotomies.
[00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:39.121]  You think I'm joking?
[00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:40.682]  I'll document it when we get back.
[00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:43.164]  This is the new Brave New World, folks.
[00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:47.868]  This is the new Brave New World that they're setting up right in front of us.
[00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:59.687]  And you can keep sucking your thumbs out there like little babies and denying it, or you can wake up to the New World Order and join us and come in for the big win against it.
[00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:07.812]  But when we get back, I've got the mainstream news articles, I've got the bill here.
[00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:14.337]  Your car will have to have a transponder chip on it, everybody in Texas, and of course,
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.102]  You're sitting there in Minnesota, or California, or New York, or Florida, or Kansas, and you're saying, it's not going to happen here.
[00:04:23.122 --> 00:04:24.882]  Yeah, it's happening where you're at, too.
[00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:28.523]  It's all federally controlled and manipulated.
[00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.924]  And it's a total nightmare.
[00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:35.985]  We'll be back and we'll discuss this and a lot more.
[00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.485]  There's just so much to cover today.
[00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:41.326]  Call the free number to join us again, 1-800
[00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:45.039]  2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[00:04:46.942 --> 00:04:51.969]  Websites are Infowars.com and presentplanet.tv as well as Infowars.net.
[00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:52.791]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:05.630]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:10.233]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:14.755]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.176]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:17.897]  Panama!
[00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:22.139]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.142]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.363]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:42.009]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.430]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.651]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:51.352]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:51.892]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.912 --> 00:05:53.213]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:04.056]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:08.298]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:11.319]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.920]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.744]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:24.284]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:28.626]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:29.627]  We're good to go!
[00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.041]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.040]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.242]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:05.122]  Prepare yourself.
[00:07:05.282 --> 00:07:08.965]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:14.888]  Call toll free 888-211-1715 and receive the book, The Bible Says, for free.
[00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:16.329]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:19.111]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:20.812]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:23.894]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll free 888-211-1715.
[00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:24.695]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:30.622]  U.S.
[00:07:30.662 --> 00:07:31.703]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:32.924]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:33.844]  Which are collectible?
[00:07:33.884 --> 00:07:34.625]  Which are bullion?
[00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:36.806]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:39.288]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:39.708]  Coins.
[00:07:39.908 --> 00:07:45.651]  As a special offer, Midas Resources will send you a 2005 Red Book and a Genuine Silver Dollar for only $22.95.

[00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:06.039]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.761]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:24.690]  The number one movie in the country right now is Sin City.
[00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:28.432]  And
[00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:35.077]  I knew when I saw mainstream reviewers attacking it savagely that I had to go see it.
[00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:37.438]  And it is extremely violent.
[00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:40.319]  It is extremely bloody.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.983]  There isn't really any sex in the film other than some scantily dressed women.
[00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:54.186]  And even the violence itself is stylized in black and white.
[00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:55.227]  It's really animated.
[00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:57.388]  And it has Bruce Willis and
[00:08:58.098 --> 00:09:07.783]  Mickey Rourke, and a lot of actors I like in it, and I do not take your children to see this film, but I thought, why are they attacking it so much?
[00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:09.624]  Why are they going after it?
[00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:18.708]  Well, I went to see Sin City, and it is decidedly anti-New World Order.
[00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:27.493]  It shows that the government deals the drugs, runs the prostitutes, that our so-called religious leaders are really devil worshippers,
[00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:39.385]  Quite frankly, I thought that it was more reality-based, even though it's a comic book, than the nightly news in many respects.
[00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:45.627]  And you know, I wasn't going to talk about Sin City, but number one, I don't want to plagiarize it on the air.
[00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:47.928]  Or Frank Miller.
[00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:51.829]  Or Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:55.070]  By the way, the film was made right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:57.703 --> 00:10:00.085]  I don't really talk about movies on this broadcast.
[00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:01.726]  That's not what this show is about.
[00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:07.029]  But, you've got to give credit where credit is due.
[00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.014]  Because it's not as violent as a lot of movies that are hailed as conservative and good.
[00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:17.635]  So why was it being demonized?
[00:10:18.276 --> 00:10:21.217]  And again, I'm really not recommending, if you're faint of heart, going to see it.
[00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:22.918]  But I want to analyze it.
[00:10:22.938 --> 00:10:24.099]  I went in there with an open mind.
[00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:25.480]  Maybe this will be a piece of trash.
[00:10:29.386 --> 00:10:39.214]  But, you know, when Matt Drudge is attacking something, it's always got to be a little bit questionable if he's attacking it.
[00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:44.818]  But there's a scene where they've shot Bruce Willis up, because he's a cop.
[00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:51.043]  I mean, I have to give the movie away, and I'm not going to give much of it away, but he's trying to stop government-run child-kidnapping rings.
[00:10:52.498 --> 00:10:53.559]  Which is what they really do.
[00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.822]  I mean, we played Cynthia McKinney a couple weeks ago in Congress.
[00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.323]  You know, 200,000 children, women.
[00:10:58.363 --> 00:11:00.585]  They ought to make a movie about that!
[00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:02.527]  Boy, people wouldn't believe it though.
[00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:03.568]  200,000 people?
[00:11:03.608 --> 00:11:06.771]  That's two giant football stadiums full of people.
[00:11:07.812 --> 00:11:11.915]  Kidnapped in one year alone at Machine Gun Point and flown out to slave brothels.
[00:11:12.436 --> 00:11:13.577]  That's a lot of slave brothels.
[00:11:13.957 --> 00:11:14.498]  Big business.
[00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:24.374]  Maybe it'll be like gambling one day, especially if NAMBLA gets its way, the North American Man-Boy Love Association.
[00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:26.716]  It'll be like gambling that was in the back alleys.
[00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:28.777]  It'll be right up there at the grocery store.
[00:11:28.797 --> 00:11:31.138]  Maybe you'll buy little kids at the grocery store.
[00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:31.958]  These people have their way.
[00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:32.719]  No, I don't think so.
[00:11:32.739 --> 00:11:36.961]  They want to keep it illegal so they make higher profits, like the heroin and cocaine.
[00:11:39.602 --> 00:11:44.905]  And the senator comes in to explain to Bruce Willis, you know, the senator who's running the whole operation, basically.
[00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.166]  He tells him, I'm going to keep you alive.
[00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:51.565]  I'm going to frame you for all this, and he goes, let me tell you what power is.
[00:11:52.806 --> 00:12:01.528]  And this isn't the exact quote, but he said power is telling a big lie, a lie that, a huge lie, that people know is a lie.
[00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:03.889]  But they still go along with it.
[00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.850]  Because they're part of the system.
[00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:12.172]  He pulls out his gun and he says, I could kill you right now.
[00:12:15.114 --> 00:12:17.995]  In this hospital room, and they do nothing to me!
[00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:22.516]  Because if I go down, this whole house of cards goes down!
[00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:23.696]  And that's power.
[00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:26.437]  They're gonna go along with me, they're gonna go along with my evil.
[00:12:29.057 --> 00:12:39.880]  And isn't that the truth on 9-11, and on gun control, on the open borders, and on toll roads, and forced vaccinations, and all of it!
[00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:47.543]  It doesn't matter if I got Henry Kissinger saying they're going to forcibly sterilize half the population and then watch them carry the plan out from 73.
[00:12:47.923 --> 00:12:50.683]  Doesn't matter if that's the Library of Congress website.
[00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:56.284]  Doesn't matter if I've got DynCorp kidnapping 200,000 women and little children, little boys and girls.
[00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:58.125]  Nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:00.045]  They're going to do it right out in the open.
[00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:01.826]  We're all just going to go along with it.
[00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:03.086]  Well, I'm not.
[00:13:03.106 --> 00:13:03.786]  And you're not.
[00:13:04.386 --> 00:13:05.386]  General public, they are.
[00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:07.627]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.303]  They think it keeps them safe to go along with it, and that's what gives the evil power.
[00:13:12.943 --> 00:13:13.444]  And it's true!
[00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:19.529]  And so, um, that's our world.
[00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:24.013]  You know, shrink away from an artist's rendition of real things that are happening.
[00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:30.838]  Put in a fictional account, kind of like William Shakespeare did.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.203]  Get all upset about that, but don't get upset about the real stuff going on.
[00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:41.852]  It's unbelievable.
[00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:44.313]  And the government knows that about us.
[00:13:44.393 --> 00:13:50.736]  I mean, they'll keep all the bloody images of our dead and dying cribs away from us and the dead and dying Iraqi children.
[00:13:51.777 --> 00:13:55.318]  But then we love a steady diet of violence and death and carnage on television.
[00:13:55.338 --> 00:13:56.158]  That's all okay.
[00:13:56.178 --> 00:13:58.840]  But they don't even show us the coffins coming off the planes.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.081]  Why, that might offend somebody, even when the families want the coffins seen.
[00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:07.066]  This is the difference.
[00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:12.248]  People 50 years ago could stand to see real violence in the real world.
[00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:13.048]  That didn't affect them.
[00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:13.928]  They wanted reality.
[00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:18.850]  But if you showed them violence on TV, they'd become very upset because they knew you didn't take violence lightly.
[00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.410]  They knew it was a big deal.
[00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:32.874]  But now that we're separated from reality, we're upset by the real image, but not upset by the manufactured image.
[00:14:35.763 --> 00:14:37.464]  Alright, I don't want to get into too much philosophy.
[00:14:37.504 --> 00:14:45.090]  We've got loaded phone lines with Travis and Johnny and Jeff and folks in Toronto, Canada and Steve and Georgia and many others.
[00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.210]  I'll get to your calls.
[00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.411]  I want to get to you in this segment.
[00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.112]  I said I would.
[00:14:49.613 --> 00:14:52.395]  But I really do need to talk about toll roads.
[00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:59.900]  Again, eight years ago I got federal documents and even truck driving publications and
[00:15:00.862 --> 00:15:04.145]  Everybody sent me the information and attempted legislation.
[00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:13.032]  Six years ago I interviewed a member of the Federal Transportation Board who was a Democratic House member from Wisconsin.
[00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:14.994]  He was very upset about it.
[00:15:15.354 --> 00:15:16.875]  He faxed me internal documents.
[00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:23.561]  And I told you you're going to have transponders before anybody even knew what an RFID was.
[00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:25.322]  And I'm not bragging, folks.
[00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:29.726]  It's like, now when I tell you about something that's coming in a couple years, please listen to me, okay?
[00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:31.185]  All right?
[00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:32.666]  Just please.
[00:15:34.106 --> 00:15:34.787]  This is what I do.
[00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:35.627]  I research this.
[00:15:37.688 --> 00:15:41.409]  And they're going to put toll roads in all over the country.
[00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.970]  And I've been warning people about this for a long time.
[00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:54.535]  Not to mention the fact that the IMF and World Bank are basically ordering OPEC to radically increase prices.
[00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:56.255]  It's all a major scam.
[00:15:57.616 --> 00:15:59.737]  We'll talk about what's happening at the pump right now.
[00:16:00.413 --> 00:16:01.054]  A little bit later.
[00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:01.894]  It all ties together.
[00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.015]  It's all about control.
[00:16:03.115 --> 00:16:04.456]  It isn't about making money.
[00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:05.956]  The globalists print the money.
[00:16:05.976 --> 00:16:07.077]  They own the printing presses.
[00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:08.898]  It's about controlling society.
[00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:11.220]  The economy is set up to control populations.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.721]  It's not free market.
[00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:14.662]  It's free market down at the local level.
[00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:24.888]  You know, if you're selling golf clubs or vacuum cleaners, but it's not free market when you get into real economies of scale and real pinnacles of power.
[00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.651]  We're basically like a bunch of pigs
[00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:42.022]  Living in a pigsty and they throw us some slop, some leftovers, and yeah, it's a free market for us to scurry around and try to gobble it up and fight with each other over it.
[00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:47.207]  This is on InfoWars.com right now, and you can go read the bill.
[00:16:48.748 --> 00:16:49.328]  Introduced.
[00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:51.090]  Very good chance of passing.
[00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.753]  House Bill 2893 of the Texas Legislature, now in session. 2893.
[00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:04.735]  Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Compliance Program.
[00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:08.077]  And later I'll read much of the bill.
[00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:08.878]  It's a long bill.
[00:17:08.898 --> 00:17:09.578]  I won't read it all.
[00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.220]  I'll read a lot of it, subsection by subsection.
[00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:15.542]  Oh, everybody needs insurance?
[00:17:15.562 --> 00:17:16.783]  Yeah, keep us safe.
[00:17:16.923 --> 00:17:18.404]  Can't have all these illegals without it.
[00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:20.085]  Which is a scourge.
[00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:22.486]  Running over people, wrecking everywhere, no insurance.
[00:17:24.287 --> 00:17:29.751]  But when you read into the bill, it says, oh, also the transponder will be affixed to every car for the toll roads.
[00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:32.291]  For the toll roads.
[00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:35.032]  It says, for the toll road payment system.
[00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:36.853]  Actually says it.
[00:17:39.234 --> 00:17:41.455]  Every car will have a transponder.
[00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:48.857]  And if you complain about that, the cameras can measure you from camera to camera, point to point.
[00:17:49.698 --> 00:17:51.278]  And also tax you.
[00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:53.799]  Reading your license plate, instantly scanning it.
[00:17:54.479 --> 00:17:56.260]  London's already doing that with the transponders.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.061]  Already started a test program in California, Oregon.
[00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:05.543]  They've got bills pending in California, New York, a bunch of other states.
[00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:07.203]  It's here!
[00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:14.246]  And I know you're a yuppie, and you think that if you deny something has power over you, it suddenly doesn't exist.
[00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:15.706]  You have a two-year-old mentality.
[00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:16.766]  I'm in a two-year-old.
[00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:18.287]  You have an 18-month-old mentality.
[00:18:18.907 --> 00:18:21.508]  But if you cover your eyes up, it makes the world go away.
[00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:24.649]  And if you just giggle about this now, it won't happen to you.
[00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:27.710]  Well, it's going to happen to you, because you're an idiot.
[00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:38.313]  You're the type of people that send me emails denying this stuff, denying legislation, denying that Patriot Act II says all Americans are terrorists in Section 802.
[00:18:39.193 --> 00:18:40.494]  You won't even read Section 802.
[00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.876]  You just say it isn't true, and then it isn't true.
[00:18:43.116 --> 00:18:44.397]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:45.438]  It is true!
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.222]  And I know that you're not going to talk about it on local radio stations.
[00:18:51.242 --> 00:18:52.943]  You're not going to talk about it around the country.
[00:18:52.963 --> 00:18:55.605]  You're just going to go quietly into the night.
[00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:05.330]  And, you know, that was the problem back in 93-94 when they put thumb scanners in at all the DPS facilities in the state of Texas.
[00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.251]  Thumb scan you to get a driver's license.
[00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:11.014]  We'll go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:14.257]  Straight away when we get back.
[00:19:15.178 --> 00:19:16.439]  That was the problem with the thumb scanners.
[00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.420]  I mean, people would argue with me going, I didn't thumb scan.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.083]  I go, don't you remember the little black box with the red light?
[00:19:21.183 --> 00:19:22.003]  Oh yeah, I do.
[00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:23.805]  Oh.
[00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:28.188]  Well, first they denied it, and then, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.109]  I said, well, listen, they didn't ask you about this.
[00:19:30.449 --> 00:19:31.930]  They didn't tell you what this was for, did they?
[00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.190]  No.
[00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.971]  Well, they're going to do other stuff.
[00:19:35.192 --> 00:19:36.772]  Everything is about mobility.
[00:19:37.653 --> 00:19:46.777]  They're going to control that mobility, and it's going to be used to buy and sell for national sales tax that the libertarians you can trust are going to push.
[00:19:48.158 --> 00:19:49.798]  Which they're not libertarians you can trust.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:52.820]  Alright, we'll
[00:19:54.252 --> 00:19:55.833]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[00:19:57.594 --> 00:20:00.675]  Hope you'll stay with us.
[00:20:01.336 --> 00:20:07.559]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:15.783]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:20:16.123 --> 00:20:23.987]  Is this a flaw free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:20:24.287 --> 00:20:29.051]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:34.094]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:20:34.614 --> 00:20:38.457]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.978]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:44.121]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:20:44.562 --> 00:20:48.945]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:51.967]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:20:57.768 --> 00:21:04.150]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:13.332]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:21:13.652 --> 00:21:18.313]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:25.520]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:37.712]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:42.636]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:45.138]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:21:49.882 --> 00:21:50.943]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:00.702 --> 00:22:03.164]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:07.527]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:22:08.147 --> 00:22:12.030]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:21.316]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:22:22.276 --> 00:22:29.441]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:22:30.373 --> 00:22:38.496]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:59.747 --> 00:23:05.270]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:13.035]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:23:13.155 --> 00:23:19.758]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:21.319]  Now it's available to you.
[00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:28.063]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:23:28.303 --> 00:23:32.587]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:39.132]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:43.355]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[00:23:57.466 --> 00:24:09.933]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.534 --> 00:24:13.495]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.097 --> 00:24:22.661]  So just like cattle, you march in, get your thumb scan, get your face scanned, a digital photo.
[00:24:23.627 --> 00:24:25.848]  Now under federal law, all the states are doing it.
[00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:28.330]  The dropper's license is the national ID card.
[00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.933]  Then all across the country, they start putting transponders in the cars.
[00:24:34.013 --> 00:24:34.693]  And, oh!
[00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:37.135]  They don't even tell you what it's for!
[00:24:37.815 --> 00:24:42.178]  Just, it's part of your, part of your little sticker now that you get.
[00:24:43.338 --> 00:24:44.479]  Part of your tags.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.242]  Oh, and now we're gonna toll road you with that, alright?
[00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:50.702]  Okay, you're our slave.
[00:24:50.742 --> 00:24:51.583]  You do what we say.
[00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:53.818]  There's never a public debate.
[00:24:53.878 --> 00:24:54.839]  No one even knows about it.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.005]  Because the corporations that own the dominant media own the toll road companies that own our government.
[00:25:02.025 --> 00:25:03.366]  Travis in Seattle.
[00:25:03.406 --> 00:25:04.087]  You're on the air.
[00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.007]  Go ahead, Travis.
[00:25:05.388 --> 00:25:05.808]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:05.828 --> 00:25:06.749]  How you doing?
[00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.569]  Good.
[00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.790]  Just a couple of comments.
[00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:09.851]  I got a girl.
[00:25:09.931 --> 00:25:10.932]  I can't get through to her.
[00:25:10.972 --> 00:25:12.594]  I've been with her for the last four years.
[00:25:12.934 --> 00:25:17.017]  I would have married her, but I didn't want to enter into a contract with the state about how much I love her.
[00:25:17.077 --> 00:25:17.758]  I mean, that was it.
[00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:22.627]  So anyway, the bottom line is, she's going to college now to be a doctor's assistant.
[00:25:23.088 --> 00:25:28.872]  And they shot her with this Hepatitis C virus, took them three shots to do it on three different occasions.
[00:25:29.553 --> 00:25:40.281]  And what I'm wondering is if you think they may be putting weird stuff into the vaccine to make them do an about-face in their way of thinking, or if it's just the way it is.
[00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:40.802]  I don't know.
[00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:49.447]  Medical workers have to take, I don't know, every three or four years, the round of three hepatitis shots.
[00:25:50.828 --> 00:25:57.974]  And with those injections, we have caught them in Africa adding things to the hepatitis shots.
[00:25:58.534 --> 00:26:11.185]  We know through the hepatitis shots in New York, back in the 70s, late 70s, that's how they put the HIV virus into the gay population, homosexual population.
[00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:14.907]  Folks, this is confirmed, okay?
[00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:17.788]  I wouldn't trust this.
[00:26:18.008 --> 00:26:24.431]  We have a government that thousands of times has released chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals over U.S.
[00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:24.891]  cities.
[00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:26.772]  I mean, that's declassified.
[00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.981]  You shouldn't trust them to put anything in you.
[00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:30.521]  Right.
[00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:37.688]  I couldn't get through to her not to go to the school to start with, so... Well, I mean, if I was you, I would, um... I mean, she's a Christian girl.
[00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:38.949]  She goes to Christian church.
[00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:49.638]  Her kid goes to Christian school, but... Well, I mean, we've got a Nobel laureate who's an epidemiologist saying, uh, if you take the, uh, flu shot, you've got a thousand percent increase in Alzheimer's.
[00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:51.267]  Yeah, I believe it.
[00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:51.848]  I believe it.
[00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:53.771]  Well, I mean, go to my website.
[00:26:53.931 --> 00:26:55.393]  It's somewhere there in the archives.
[00:26:55.453 --> 00:27:01.902]  I think it's in the vaccine section of Prison Planet, where Henry Kissinger says they're going to forcibly sterilize the women through vaccines.
[00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.511]  Well, I think I've heard that.
[00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:06.652]  I've pretty much examined your website.
[00:27:06.672 --> 00:27:10.494]  But I wouldn't... I mean, I'd get her the documents and go, and here's the URLs of the government.
[00:27:11.214 --> 00:27:12.875]  That's how dumb they think we are!
[00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:14.396]  They admit all this!
[00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:15.857]  They just do it right in front of us!
[00:27:16.097 --> 00:27:17.538]  Well, I don't get these people.
[00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:23.280]  She goes to this church, they sing for 45 minutes, and then he says a few quotes out of the Bible and passes the plate, and the church is over.
[00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:31.985]  And her kids, they got her 10-year-old kid, a girl, playing basketball, and they got them running up to each other, trying to scare each other to drop the ball.
[00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:35.021]  I mean, that doesn't sound very Christian to me.
[00:27:35.522 --> 00:27:36.102]  I don't get it.
[00:27:36.902 --> 00:27:39.382]  Listen, I appreciate the call, Travis.
[00:27:39.562 --> 00:27:41.523]  I don't know what I can say.
[00:27:42.263 --> 00:27:47.544]  Sounds like your girlfriend's a nice person who's very trusting and she sees the world through her eyes.
[00:27:48.624 --> 00:27:53.525]  Because she's a good, decent person who has love in her heart and wouldn't hurt a fly.
[00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:55.446]  She thinks the world is like that.
[00:27:56.406 --> 00:27:58.566]  See, I don't see the world through my eyes, folks.
[00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:01.367]  I go out and I research what the world really is.
[00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:04.615]  But most people see it through their eyes.
[00:28:04.835 --> 00:28:05.916]  I don't believe my eyes.
[00:28:07.556 --> 00:28:10.477]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Canada, then Jeff and others.
[00:28:10.537 --> 00:28:11.277]  Johnny, go ahead.
[00:28:11.737 --> 00:28:12.137]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:12.937 --> 00:28:14.197]  Two quick points.
[00:28:14.757 --> 00:28:17.198]  Gas in Vancouver now has reached a dollar-two a liter.
[00:28:17.558 --> 00:28:18.618]  And it's just a scam.
[00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:20.419]  The biggest scam I can ever imagine.
[00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.699]  What does that translate out to in gallons?
[00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:25.479]  About four bucks a gallon.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.300]  Well, it's like...
[00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:40.196]  Just the garbage gas, the 87 octanes, here in Texas is like, here in Austin, I think it's like a 2010, and it's like three and a half bucks in areas of California.
[00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:41.556]  I know.
[00:28:41.616 --> 00:28:45.718]  I got a recommendation for a documentary that I saw last night at the video store.
[00:28:46.118 --> 00:28:47.138]  Not sure if you've ever heard of it.
[00:28:47.198 --> 00:28:48.938]  It's called Angels and Demons Revealed.
[00:28:50.699 --> 00:28:51.339]  Never seen it.
[00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:54.740]  You should check this out because the movie is perfect
[00:28:55.453 --> 00:29:00.555]  Um, documentary, it talks about all the stuff that you guys have ever talked about, about society.
[00:29:01.715 --> 00:29:13.618]  And, uh, it starts at the Knight Templars and it goes up to the Masons and the Illuminati and how, um, they've infiltrated the Vatican, the KGB, and, uh, I mean, you know what?
[00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:15.099]  It's, it's worth checking out.
[00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:22.541]  It is mainstream, um, but it, it, it's worth actually looking at because it seems that people nowadays
[00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:33.774]  They respect mainstream more than they do the video of yours, because yours is kind of underground, whereas this is now something that you can go to the video store and you can get.
[00:29:33.934 --> 00:29:36.796]  Sure, but I'll tell you this, Johnny, I think the worm has turned.
[00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:41.840]  I think people respect alternative media more than they respect mainstream media.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.281]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.042]  Sounds interesting.
[00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:48.144]  We'll come back and talk to Jeff and others on the other side.
[00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:54.871]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:58.478]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.492]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:30:05.692 --> 00:30:08.394]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:30:08.594 --> 00:30:09.975]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:20.061]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:22.022]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[00:30:22.302 --> 00:30:26.164]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:30:26.404 --> 00:30:30.846]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:34.867]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:30:35.107 --> 00:30:41.270]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.291]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:47.792]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[00:30:47.892 --> 00:30:51.694]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:30:51.874 --> 00:30:53.096]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:30:53.256 --> 00:30:53.657]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:31:01.255 --> 00:31:04.277]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.598 --> 00:31:09.521]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.782 --> 00:31:14.145]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.425 --> 00:31:23.352]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.552 --> 00:31:27.175]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.455 --> 00:31:32.498]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.778 --> 00:31:39.521]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:40.542]  What about you?
[00:31:41.298 --> 00:31:46.660]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.861]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.881 --> 00:31:49.762]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.227 --> 00:32:03.588]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:03.828 --> 00:32:07.669]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:08.809]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:13.371]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.591 --> 00:32:17.772]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.152 --> 00:32:23.014]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.414 --> 00:32:26.996]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Calbem Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:27.177 --> 00:32:32.520]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.522]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:35.822 --> 00:32:36.723]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:37.023 --> 00:32:47.750]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Calbem Pure Soaps.

[00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:58.075]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresilk.com.
[00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:08.220]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:11.542]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.463 --> 00:33:17.005]  They say never judge a book by its cover.
[00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:20.551]  And I found that to be true.
[00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:30.067]  But so many people look at politicians because they got short haircuts and are wearing suits and ties and, oh, they're trustworthy.
[00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.812]  They must be good.
[00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:33.173]  We can
[00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:36.378]  We can give up our liberties to these people.
[00:33:36.738 --> 00:33:37.739]  They'll take care of us.
[00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:45.605]  Never mind if they're in business with the Bin Ladens, or vacation with them, or engage in insider trading against American and United Airlines.
[00:33:45.685 --> 00:33:49.929]  Never mind if they warn public officials on the flight to New York the night before 9-11.
[00:33:50.329 --> 00:33:52.551]  Never mind if NORAD stood down.
[00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:59.316]  Never mind if they were running drills that morning of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the exact same time the real thing was happening.
[00:33:59.896 --> 00:34:01.137]  All that's a coincidence.
[00:34:01.738 --> 00:34:03.059]  Let's just give up our freedoms.
[00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:07.990]  Oh, and okay, maybe they are going to put transponders in all our cars and taxes.
[00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.251]  Well, maybe we need to pay more taxes, you know.
[00:34:12.552 --> 00:34:14.272]  And, uh, well, that's just part of freedom.
[00:34:15.312 --> 00:34:16.393]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:34:16.573 --> 00:34:17.613]  Jeff in Ohio.
[00:34:17.673 --> 00:34:18.413]  Jeff, go ahead.
[00:34:21.454 --> 00:34:22.715]  Jeff, you're on the air, sir.
[00:34:23.155 --> 00:34:23.935]  Afternoon, Alex.
[00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:27.776]  Had kind of a crazy turn of events here in, uh, Ohio.
[00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:32.478]  I live about, uh, 30 miles south of Wright State Air Force Base.
[00:34:32.818 --> 00:34:33.038]  Yes.
[00:34:33.058 --> 00:34:33.458]  Right, Pat?
[00:34:34.418 --> 00:34:46.365]  And we have had an incredible amount of low-level, slow-speed flyovers by stealth fighter aircraft and also refueling aircraft.
[00:34:46.925 --> 00:34:49.147]  And it sounds like a tornado when it's going by.
[00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:50.427]  Yeah, they're doing a lot of drills.
[00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:56.131]  I'm getting reports all over the country of really a massive increase in drilling.
[00:34:56.971 --> 00:35:03.435]  And also, we've been seeing Boeing has an unmanned plane that they fly around.
[00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:08.532]  And we've been catching glimpses of that as it darts in and out of the clouds up top.
[00:35:08.592 --> 00:35:11.695]  You have to almost know what you're looking for to even see them.
[00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:12.936]  You're talking about the Predator?
[00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:15.979]  Uh, this looks like a stealth fighter craft.
[00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:19.542]  It's really small, maybe 7, 8, 10 feet across.
[00:35:19.662 --> 00:35:22.145]  Oh yeah, it has the boomerang shape?
[00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:22.725]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:23.146 --> 00:35:24.327]  Those are the ones we've been seeing.
[00:35:24.407 --> 00:35:25.127]  I've seen those.
[00:35:25.187 --> 00:35:25.948]  Tons of them.
[00:35:26.068 --> 00:35:27.750]  I mean, it's just been incredible.
[00:35:28.314 --> 00:35:30.255]  You know, what's been going on around here.
[00:35:30.275 --> 00:35:32.295]  Well, you're going to see a lot more in 2010.
[00:35:32.835 --> 00:35:34.696]  Half the Air Force is going to be unmanned.
[00:35:36.216 --> 00:35:41.457]  And they're also going to have $76 billion worth of ground robots.
[00:35:42.478 --> 00:35:44.218]  Yeah, that'll be really nice, won't it?
[00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:45.718]  Well, they'll follow orders.
[00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:48.199]  Unconditionally.
[00:35:48.699 --> 00:35:55.741]  I'll tell you another thing that's been shocking me is since I've been listening to you, after 9-11, I really watched a massive amount of television
[00:35:56.753 --> 00:36:08.100]  And since I started listening to you and Blood and other people like that, I have just been amazed at the terminology that the TV stations are picking up that you guys are using now.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:23.429]  I mean, Michelle Malkin was on Fox News the other day and actually spit out that the ACLU had a New World Order Orwellian agenda for, you know, the people coming across the border and how they were against the Minutemen and
[00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:32.542]  It's just amazing the terminology that you guys use to describe what's going on, how that is just utterly flooding into our major media now.
[00:36:32.642 --> 00:36:41.232]  Well, what they do is, again, they know that you'll judge a book by its cover, so whereas we've been talking about New World Order for decades, some Patriots for 50 years,
[00:36:43.092 --> 00:36:45.094]  Hitler talked about it, H.G.
[00:36:45.114 --> 00:36:48.897]  Wells talked about it, Woodrow Wilson talked about it, George Bush Sr.
[00:36:48.937 --> 00:36:50.239]  talked about it, George Jr.
[00:36:50.259 --> 00:36:59.447]  has now used it, Dan Quayle, you know, countless people have used it, but when we'd use it, the neocons would say it didn't exist, we were crazy.
[00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:03.611]  And yes, I have heard them, because I mainly listen to radio,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:09.143]  They'll say, we've got to vote for George Bush, he'll defeat the New World Order.
[00:37:09.783 --> 00:37:14.906]  Or Michelle Malkin, who has her book, The Case for Internment Camps.
[00:37:15.446 --> 00:37:18.408]  She'll go, we've got to fight the New World Order, we've got to put people in camps.
[00:37:19.008 --> 00:37:21.670]  We've got to have more Patriot Acts, that fights the New World Order.
[00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.272]  We've got to have our global government to fight their global government.
[00:37:27.102 --> 00:37:28.283]  They give you a false choice.
[00:37:28.303 --> 00:37:45.750]  Well, there's the liberal world government, there's the conservative world government, and yes, the ACLU will fight the Patriot Act, but then will go try to stop the Minutemen simply reporting to the Border Patrol the illegals pouring across in Arizona, and then she'll use the label New World Order to attack the ACLU.
[00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:50.092]  But notice, I bet she wouldn't attack Bush, who was for total open borders himself.
[00:37:50.152 --> 00:37:51.673]  See, so they keep it kind of
[00:37:52.574 --> 00:38:00.143]  Uh, parishioned or segregated, uh, in kind of a schizophrenic nature.
[00:38:00.283 --> 00:38:02.266]  Oh, the evil Democrats, they want open borders.
[00:38:02.306 --> 00:38:02.726]  Well, wait!
[00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:04.609]  It's Bush calling the Minutemen
[00:38:05.527 --> 00:38:09.668]  I get enraged at people like Sean Hannity that'll sit there for 20 minutes and talk about
[00:38:30.082 --> 00:38:37.828]  Uh, how the aliens coming across is bad, and how it's bad for America, and they'll blame everyone, and never mention George Bush's name.
[00:38:38.128 --> 00:38:38.368]  Never.
[00:38:38.709 --> 00:38:40.270]  And it's like, hello?
[00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:51.398]  You know, you know that he's, you know, the one who offered amnesty to these people, and all these things, and they'll sit there and proliferate, you know, all these facts about how horrible it is.
[00:38:52.034 --> 00:38:55.875]  You know, that the illegals are coming across, and never mention the main person.
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:59.956]  Listen, I mean this is really important, what you brought up, and I appreciate the call, Jeff, take care.
[00:39:00.416 --> 00:39:01.316]  Really great points.
[00:39:02.356 --> 00:39:03.176]  It's the same thing.
[00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:16.919]  Democrats will pull their hair out, screaming and yelling, Bush and the Patriot Act, and Bush and our liberties, and our freedoms, and Bush and electronic voting machines that take our right to vote, and these Republicans are fascists!
[00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:24.887]  Meanwhile, the Democrats, in many cases, are outvoting Republicans at the state and federal level for all these initiatives.
[00:39:27.549 --> 00:39:38.997]  So, again, the most basic, simplest analogy for your friends and family that can't understand this is professional wrestling.
[00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:44.702]  Next time professional wrestling is going to be on, say, I got something, a political test, I want to show this to you.
[00:39:45.502 --> 00:39:47.684]  Turn it on, even though they don't watch professional wrestling,
[00:39:48.524 --> 00:39:50.445]  And go, now you can tell this isn't real, right?
[00:39:50.485 --> 00:39:58.910]  You know, you pile-drive somebody's head from, you know, six feet off the ropes, it'll break their neck, or usually, at least give them a concussion.
[00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:04.793]  Now, you know, you can't pile-drive somebody five times and, you know, they not go to the emergency room.
[00:40:05.493 --> 00:40:07.154]  And they'll go, yes, it's fake.
[00:40:07.915 --> 00:40:12.617]  Well, did you know that millions of Americans, full-grown men, they'll probably call angrily to this show.
[00:40:12.697 --> 00:40:13.258]  They do sometimes.
[00:40:13.738 --> 00:40:15.679]  And say, no, wrestling is real, don't talk about it.
[00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:18.475]  It's the same thing.
[00:40:19.115 --> 00:40:23.318]  I mean, you're trying to explain to Republicans and Democrats that it's a staged event.
[00:40:23.358 --> 00:40:24.058]  It isn't real.
[00:40:24.098 --> 00:40:31.243]  I mean, it is several steps worse than a boxing match, as I said yesterday, that is staged.
[00:40:32.303 --> 00:40:40.349]  Boxing has fallen out of favor, and people don't watch it as much as they used to, because most people know that most of the fights are rigged.
[00:40:40.869 --> 00:40:42.290]  I mean, that's come out many times.
[00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.272]  Well, who wants to watch a rigged boxing match?
[00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:50.348]  Who wants to watch a system where the best boxers never get a shot?
[00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.431]  Did you know a lot of football games are rigged?
[00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:56.592]  Did you know a lot of baseballs are rigged?
[00:40:57.113 --> 00:40:58.274]  I know, you don't want to hear that.
[00:40:58.594 --> 00:41:00.015]  Fine, it's not rigged.
[00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:00.735]  You can believe it.
[00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:04.878]  But I'll tell you what is rigged is professional wrestling.
[00:41:04.958 --> 00:41:06.739]  That is not real.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:14.244]  Now, just like with acrobats or anybody else who performs, people do get hurt sometimes and they play that up.
[00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:16.226]  And when they don't do the
[00:41:17.293 --> 00:41:19.855]  The body slammed correctly, you know, bones get broken.
[00:41:20.616 --> 00:41:22.398]  And people will argue that it's real.
[00:41:22.658 --> 00:41:27.322]  And I'm a conspiracy theorist because I say professional wrestling is not real.
[00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:32.907]  I mean, Rowdy Rowdy Piper has gone public and said it's not real.
[00:41:32.947 --> 00:41:34.969]  I mean, as a child, I knew it wasn't real.
[00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.612]  And I'd have friends over and we'd be watching wrestling and I'd be laughing at it.
[00:41:38.993 --> 00:41:42.596]  I mean, I thought it was entertaining and they'd get mad and say it's real.
[00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:47.764]  You know, my dad takes me to the wrestling matches.
[00:41:47.884 --> 00:41:48.444]  It's real.
[00:41:49.325 --> 00:41:51.186]  Oh, the Von Eriks, you know, up in Dallas.
[00:41:51.246 --> 00:41:51.626]  It's real.
[00:41:51.706 --> 00:41:53.407]  And I remember, it's not real.
[00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:59.030]  Well, it's the same basic rules in politics.
[00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:04.333]  They get up there and, you know, John Kerry goes, Oh yeah!
[00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:06.014]  You're going down!
[00:42:06.744 --> 00:42:08.005]  Step up to a Slim Jim!
[00:42:08.185 --> 00:42:09.946]  Let me tell you something right now!
[00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:15.169]  I didn't skip this title for 10 years to lay down to you, Hulk Hogan!
[00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.151]  And let me tell you something, oh yeah!
[00:42:18.592 --> 00:42:22.174]  And then Hulk Hogan, oh yeah, you're going down, boy!
[00:42:22.194 --> 00:42:24.215]  Then they get in there and fight for an hour.
[00:42:27.781 --> 00:42:30.123]  70 pound men punching each other in the face full force.
[00:42:30.143 --> 00:42:32.905]  There's not blood and broken bones and teeth all over the ground.
[00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:35.007]  And people really think that's real.
[00:42:35.087 --> 00:42:38.109]  People in colorful outfits and sequins all over them.
[00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.951]  You know, their assistant in the bikini.
[00:42:41.011 --> 00:42:44.014]  I mean, look folks.
[00:42:44.654 --> 00:42:45.195]  What do they say?
[00:42:45.215 --> 00:42:49.758]  Like 50 million people watch wrestling and go see it and most of them think it's real?
[00:42:50.238 --> 00:42:52.120]  They'll get violent if you tell them it's not.
[00:42:53.861 --> 00:42:56.243]  And so, this is the mentality we're dealing with.
[00:42:57.877 --> 00:43:02.341]  And John Kerry is Macho Man Randy Savage, and George Bush is Hulk Hogan.
[00:43:03.002 --> 00:43:05.804]  He was a character from the 80's, or the early 90's.
[00:43:06.905 --> 00:43:08.827]  And you cannot explain this to these people.
[00:43:08.887 --> 00:43:10.308]  You are never going to explain it to them.
[00:43:10.328 --> 00:43:11.469]  They're not going to listen to you.
[00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:16.193]  They have the minds of children, folks.
[00:43:16.233 --> 00:43:17.794]  That's why the globalists call us cattle.
[00:43:19.476 --> 00:43:25.241]  And people have always had problems with reality, but now they're literally dumbing us down even further by design.
[00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:29.670]  And so that's what John Kerry and George Bush did.
[00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.851]  I mean, they were cousins on every side of their family.
[00:43:31.871 --> 00:43:33.412]  It was like a breed of dog, folks.
[00:43:33.832 --> 00:43:37.153]  You know, I mean, just everyone's related to everybody, completely.
[00:43:37.173 --> 00:43:40.375]  You know, this aunt's married to that uncle, married to that.
[00:43:40.435 --> 00:43:44.256]  I mean, my grandfather was, you know, the son of your great-great-grandfather.
[00:43:44.276 --> 00:43:45.917]  You know, it's just on and on.
[00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:50.519]  And they go to the same secret society.
[00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:52.900]  Kerry was for the war.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.181]  Kerry was for all the same stuff.
[00:43:57.341 --> 00:43:58.922]  And the Democrats thought he was going to save them.
[00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.243]  They just don't get it.
[00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:11.793]  And so... Secander and others will go to you in a second, but I just want to briefly comment on this.
[00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:14.655]  But I guess the next hour I'll detail it.
[00:44:15.456 --> 00:44:26.865]  You might want to know that at the state level, all across the country, all across the nation, all across the land,
[00:44:27.893 --> 00:44:31.095]  They are preparing to put transponders in all cars by law.
[00:44:33.397 --> 00:44:36.879]  And the bills are in the legislatures right now.
[00:44:38.981 --> 00:44:41.382]  And I've got one of the bills for here in Texas, HB 2893.
[00:44:41.542 --> 00:44:41.382]  2893.
[00:44:41.562 --> 00:44:43.684]  And it's got a good chance of passing.
[00:44:43.704 --> 00:44:44.384]  And I'm begging you.
[00:44:44.404 --> 00:44:45.065]  I'm pleading with you.
[00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:58.256]  I know you don't want to believe this because it's a threat to you.
[00:44:58.276 --> 00:45:10.424]  You want to just deny it exists and then go on about your business until you go to pick up your sticker, your yearly sticker, or comes in the mail and you put it on your car and it's got a transponder in it.
[00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:14.948]  And they say in the bill it is to tax you on the toll roads.
[00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.670]  I mean, here's the bill.
[00:45:20.572 --> 00:45:23.734]  We are now, if this passes, a year away from this happening.
[00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:25.836]  Right as the toll roads start opening.
[00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.599]  Every major road in the state.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.263]  And the average person I talk to has no idea.
[00:45:33.923 --> 00:45:38.087]  Because they've been told to keep their mouths shut at the local TV stations and local radio stations.
[00:45:39.968 --> 00:45:41.069]  It's very upsetting to me.
[00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:46.334]  Not just the taxation, the thousands of dollars a year, that's their own documents.
[00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:51.318]  Not just the fact that, no, they're also going to track and trace everything you do.
[00:45:54.862 --> 00:45:55.383]  It's horrible.
[00:45:56.183 --> 00:46:08.269]  And we can stop this, this is wildly unpopular, where they've just announced it on a city by city basis, Houston and Austin, upwards of 98% in Houston, 93% in Austin are against it.
[00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:17.894]  We can have thousands of people show up at a meeting, two people raise their hands for it, 2,000 raise their hands against it, and the unelected boards just say, we don't care what you say.
[00:46:19.895 --> 00:46:23.697]  And the cops that are going to enforce this, they're not going to like it either.
[00:46:25.057 --> 00:46:27.159]  But you know what, they'll enforce it, because it's their job.
[00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:31.101]  Because they're cowards too.
[00:46:33.663 --> 00:46:36.645]  And so don't say I didn't warn you when you're listening many years from now.
[00:46:39.647 --> 00:46:43.730]  Not even many years from now now, but pretty soon, but I don't know.
[00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:47.113]  Sikander in Ontario, Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:51.956]  Yep, I'm in Toronto actually, and the government here in 1997
[00:46:54.006 --> 00:46:57.168]  with their corporate friends open up Highway 407.
[00:46:58.189 --> 00:47:02.092]  It's a toll-operated highway just north of Toronto.
[00:47:03.193 --> 00:47:10.978]  It's owned and operated by a private company called 407 ETR, Electronic Toll Route.
[00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:16.982]  And basically, they have the transponders in the cars and easy to use.
[00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:18.363]  Just put it into your car and
[00:47:20.787 --> 00:47:24.110]  It looks at your license plate, it gets all your information.
[00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:32.877]  And in Illinois, they still had some of the cash toll roads, so they said, we're doubling your price if you don't get transponders.
[00:47:33.177 --> 00:47:41.544]  They actually, the prices went up 200% during peak hours here, on that highway.
[00:47:41.824 --> 00:47:42.144]  I know!
[00:47:42.565 --> 00:47:46.848]  And another thing, my brother works for American Express,
[00:47:47.654 --> 00:47:49.835]  And I just brought it up yesterday.
[00:47:49.916 --> 00:48:06.706]  I said, um, you know, they're going to start asking you, not asking you specifically, but they're going to start asking employees now to, uh, you know, um, swipe their finger or get their eye retina or whatever, whatever to, um, for your security.
[00:48:07.307 --> 00:48:08.708]  And everyone's like, yeah, right.
[00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:08.968]  Yeah.
[00:48:09.028 --> 00:48:09.188]  Right.
[00:48:09.248 --> 00:48:15.192]  And my brother's like, yeah, they're asking me for my thumb scan for corporate identity or,
[00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:17.392]  Because of security or whatever.
[00:48:17.432 --> 00:48:25.697]  And again, for the average fool out there, it sounds reasonable, but it's part of a seamless integrated system that they didn't ask us about.
[00:48:26.257 --> 00:48:28.599]  They didn't ask us if we wanted this, they just put it in.
[00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:30.380]  Where did this come from all of a sudden?
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.821]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:34.642]  Sir, have you seen my first film?
[00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:36.583]  Oh yeah, I've seen a lot of your films.
[00:48:36.603 --> 00:48:36.783]  Made in 1997.
[00:48:36.823 --> 00:48:37.144]  Released in late 1997.
[00:48:37.184 --> 00:48:38.224]  America Destroyed by Design.
[00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:48.581]  I lay out in the last 20 minutes of the film exactly what we'd see today, and it's exactly what I said.
[00:48:48.982 --> 00:48:49.162]  Right.
[00:48:49.262 --> 00:48:51.883]  Not because I have a crystal ball, because I have the federal documents.
[00:48:52.403 --> 00:48:52.643]  I know.
[00:48:53.404 --> 00:48:56.665]  I've seen a lot of your work, and I mean, I called in a couple times.
[00:48:57.045 --> 00:48:58.586]  Well, I just wish it wasn't true.
[00:48:58.626 --> 00:49:00.067]  I mean, I wish this wasn't going to happen.
[00:49:00.603 --> 00:49:03.365]  Oh yeah, but I mean it has happened.
[00:49:03.385 --> 00:49:06.227]  You were asking where it all started.
[00:49:07.708 --> 00:49:11.991]  The Pentagon has it for terms for it, but it's called Total Battlefield Awareness.
[00:49:12.932 --> 00:49:14.353]  They call it Control Cities.
[00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:19.757]  The Pentagon actually developed it and it is a total control grid.
[00:49:21.322 --> 00:49:25.465]  The actual, the very specific term is escape, and it'll pop my head in a second.
[00:49:25.725 --> 00:49:30.549]  It's a really scary term, and it's a Pentagon model being put in for it to make everything a prison.
[00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.053]  The entire country, the entire western world will be a total prison.
[00:49:35.513 --> 00:49:43.060]  Welcome to the modern world of privatization, and it always ends the same way.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.961]  Corporations win and people lose.
[00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:47.443]  I appreciate the call, you're absolutely right.
[00:49:47.483 --> 00:49:47.883]  It's like
[00:49:48.937 --> 00:49:51.579]  And again, words have been manipulated.
[00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:53.020]  It's like they call it the Patriot Act.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.341]  It's not patriotic.
[00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:57.283]  New freedom for psychological testing is not new freedom.
[00:49:58.865 --> 00:50:00.106]  And it's like privatization.
[00:50:00.146 --> 00:50:01.967]  Privatization is not privatization.
[00:50:02.788 --> 00:50:04.409]  But people can't get past the semantics.
[00:50:05.229 --> 00:50:09.393]  Privatization is where, folks, we're not talking about a new road making it a toll road.
[00:50:09.413 --> 00:50:16.598]  We're talking about taking existing highways and just plopping transponder readers on it.
[00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:18.426]  And just charging you to drive.
[00:50:19.986 --> 00:50:21.647]  6,000 miles of toll roads in Texas.
[00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:24.889]  You know how many miles of roads are in Texas?
[00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:26.850]  This is phase one.
[00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:36.794]  There are about 10,000 miles of state, federal, and local roads in Texas.
[00:50:36.814 --> 00:50:37.295]  6,000 of them.
[00:50:38.595 --> 00:50:43.878]  And I saw John Hurt, the spokesman for TxDOT in the paper the other day, just said, we're not even having public comment on this.
[00:50:44.972 --> 00:50:46.033]  You don't get public comment.
[00:50:46.514 --> 00:50:47.314]  And that's their attitude.
[00:50:47.354 --> 00:50:48.155]  Just shut up!
[00:50:48.836 --> 00:50:51.438]  We have police in black uniforms with machine guns.
[00:50:51.959 --> 00:50:53.020]  They're ready to kill you.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.002]  We're building lots of prisons for you.
[00:50:55.542 --> 00:50:57.144]  Shut up, scum slave!
[00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:09.806]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:14.812]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.032 --> 00:51:20.699]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.919 --> 00:51:25.443]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.664 --> 00:51:32.831]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.851 --> 00:51:33.651]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:36.374]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:51:36.414 --> 00:51:37.335]  And much, much more.
[00:51:37.535 --> 00:51:40.036]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:40.276 --> 00:51:47.040]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:52:02.003 --> 00:52:05.004]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.344 --> 00:52:14.167]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.487 --> 00:52:19.149]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.629 --> 00:52:26.351]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:38.555]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:39.015 --> 00:52:43.476]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:54:02.357 --> 00:54:18.060]  Alright, this is a cornucopia of really important news coming up in your calls in the second hour, but I do want to take some time to read over HB 2893.
[00:54:18.761 --> 00:54:30.283]  And again, if you live in another state, this is happening right now in your state, the federally mandated transponders.
[00:54:32.637 --> 00:54:35.919]  And then, of course, once you're used to that, they're even going to satellite tracker boxes.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:44.285]  But they figured out folks weren't going to really go along with that, so the transponder will just be added to the little sticker you get, your tags.
[00:54:46.146 --> 00:54:53.511]  And this goes into my first film, where we show the official UN plan, where half the country will be off limits.
[00:54:54.792 --> 00:55:00.236]  And if you drive up out of Oklahoma into Kansas into Missouri, you'll drive for 50 miles before there's an exit.
[00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:03.216]  And they blocked off all the old exits.
[00:55:03.276 --> 00:55:04.717]  There's all these ghost towns.
[00:55:05.977 --> 00:55:15.942]  And the McDonald's and the gas stations are every ten miles or so built in the medians of I-35.
[00:55:17.883 --> 00:55:19.464]  And they didn't ask for small towns.
[00:55:19.504 --> 00:55:28.248]  The state just comes in, blocks the road, can't get to it, and they say it's part of this plan that they're literally going to wall off most of the small towns.
[00:55:28.308 --> 00:55:29.569]  Folks, I'm not joking, okay?
[00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:30.389]  This is not a joke.
[00:55:31.364 --> 00:55:37.327]  They just come in and put concrete dividers right down the sides and you are not allowed to exit.
[00:55:38.348 --> 00:55:43.890]  And people in those small towns have to drive 30, 40, 50 miles to one of the entrance points to get on the highway.
[00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.152]  And they just do it!
[00:55:48.213 --> 00:55:54.736]  And I-35, the Federal Highway, all these big state corridors are going to be locked down.
[00:55:56.417 --> 00:55:58.878]  And again, everybody, everybody hates it.
[00:56:00.039 --> 00:56:00.739]  90 plus percent.
[00:56:01.576 --> 00:56:03.697]  And Governor Rick Perry just says, I don't care!
[00:56:05.078 --> 00:56:07.699]  And the Republicans don't attack him, they just go, he's conservative.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.541]  He's for open borders and wants to put toll roads everywhere.
[00:56:11.621 --> 00:56:12.522]  Hail Rick Perry!
[00:56:14.803 --> 00:56:18.245]  And it's the same thing with Schwarzenegger and all of them, and it's happening everywhere.
[00:56:18.785 --> 00:56:20.086]  The Democrats are doing it too.
[00:56:21.767 --> 00:56:24.769]  And because the conservative talk shows don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.
[00:56:25.929 --> 00:56:26.570]  All right then.
[00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:30.972]  Folks, you want to be in slavery, you're going to be in slavery.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.961]  And that's all about control.
[00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:35.981]  All about control.
[00:56:37.482 --> 00:56:40.803]  Some of these transponder toll roads are seven and a half dollars.
[00:56:41.784 --> 00:56:42.804]  Just across a bridge.
[00:56:43.644 --> 00:56:49.107]  They go into existing roads and they just... they just... turn them into toll roads!
[00:56:49.767 --> 00:56:50.807]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:56:50.887 --> 00:56:52.028]  Ha ha!
[00:56:52.288 --> 00:56:54.769]  And you keep paying the gas tax on top of that though.
[00:56:56.053 --> 00:57:01.198]  And they got little phony libertarians get out there and say, oh well, this is privatization, we're all for it.
[00:57:01.258 --> 00:57:06.482]  Oh, the government just gives the roads to private corporations and keeps the taxation going as well.
[00:57:07.904 --> 00:57:09.305]  That's called corporate looting.
[00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.427]  It's just the corporations becoming government.
[00:57:12.748 --> 00:57:18.213]  We'll come back with Steve and Eric and Chris and John and Ron in the next hour.
[00:57:20.686 --> 00:57:22.447]  We're in the last minute of this hour.
[00:57:22.627 --> 00:57:29.410]  I do want to encourage every single solitary one of you to get my new film, Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, my best film.
[00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:32.211]  We now have it in stock in DVD.
[00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:35.073]  A little over three hours long.
[00:57:35.213 --> 00:57:37.214]  On VHS, two hours thirty-five minutes.
[00:57:37.234 --> 00:57:38.915]  We cover the latest police state developments.
[00:57:39.675 --> 00:57:42.896]  We cover what really happened on 9-11 like no other film does.
[00:57:43.557 --> 00:57:44.537]  A full hour of the film.
[00:57:45.358 --> 00:57:46.558]  And then we get into the elite.
[00:57:46.658 --> 00:57:48.199]  We confront the globalists.
[00:57:49.085 --> 00:57:54.972]  We show you the Nazi connections to Bohemian Grove, and Skull and Bones, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the Bushes, and the Nazis.
[00:57:55.973 --> 00:58:00.458]  We expose what really drives their ideology, the death cults that control western civilization.
[00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:03.000]  Toll free number to order the new film, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:11.370]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:58:32.994 --> 00:58:33.974]  Please take action.
[00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:37.255]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that we do nothing.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.422]  And these films will light people up.
[00:58:40.502 --> 00:58:41.062]  Triple 8.
[00:58:41.102 --> 00:58:41.242]  2-5-3.
[00:58:41.262 --> 00:58:41.523]  3-1-3-9.
[00:58:41.563 --> 00:58:42.724]  Second hour is 70 seconds away.
[00:58:42.744 --> 00:58:43.024]  Big Brother.
[00:58:43.044 --> 00:58:44.605]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.742 --> 00:59:01.802]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:01.882 --> 00:59:05.763]  We're now into the second hour of this Tuesday, April 5th, 2005 edition.
[00:59:05.783 --> 00:59:06.323]  So I guess it's
[00:59:31.636 --> 00:59:34.138]  Time to get into the news and information.
[00:59:34.178 --> 00:59:35.940]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:41.884]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:43.365 --> 00:59:50.011]  I mentioned in the last hour a bill here in Texas, and there are similar bills across the nation, HB 2893.
[00:59:52.793 --> 00:59:58.958]  And it always has a nice little deceptive headline for you relating to Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Compliance Program.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.861]  Providing civil and criminal penalties.
[01:00:03.521 --> 01:00:08.843]  But then you read deeper into the bill, and it says, oh, by the way, all the cars are going to have to have transponders.
[01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:18.706]  When you get your tags, you know, little stickers you stick in your windshield every year, that'll have a transponder in it for toll road compliance and taxation.
[01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:25.368]  But if this ever even makes it to the mainstream media, they'll just go, well, you're for people having insurance, are you?
[01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:29.189]  Well, this scans and makes sure everybody's in compliance up to a database.
[01:00:29.907 --> 01:00:37.412]  And then they could also, with a transponder, from radio reader point-to-point, figure out how fast you're driving and automatically mail you tickets.
[01:00:37.432 --> 01:00:41.795]  That's already happening in several areas around the country in test programs and in England.
[01:00:43.195 --> 01:00:44.456]  And they're going to tax you with it.
[01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.818]  So, hope you enjoy!
[01:00:46.838 --> 01:00:48.419]  We're going to get into that article.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:50.940]  We're going to discuss it.
[01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:58.065]  Parents are very upset about a plan for statewide immunization databases.
[01:00:58.846 --> 01:01:01.248]  This is out of Colorado, but it's happening around the country.
[01:01:01.268 --> 01:01:01.928]  We'll get into that.
[01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:08.632]  And we will also get into teachers embrace Big Brother, police state and schools.
[01:01:09.553 --> 01:01:10.753]  Another one here, Bush Sr.
[01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:14.796]  proposed Pope John Paul become the chaplain of the New World Order.
[01:01:16.817 --> 01:01:23.281]  And also I want to get into Bush Order allows isolation of those with bird flu.
[01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.797]  If it makes it to the United States.
[01:01:26.477 --> 01:01:31.020]  Newsmax reporting that Zogby poll Americans wanted Terry to live.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:42.085]  Other polls are diametrically opposed in their findings to what we saw with the ABC News push poll saying 60 plus percent wanted her to die.
[01:01:42.845 --> 01:01:49.729]  And a lot of insiders in the economy are saying that the global economy is near the tipping point.
[01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:58.285]  And as I reported last week, Goldman Sachs is saying that oil could hit over $100 a barrel.
[01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:06.091]  So you'll be looking at the lowest gas in this country at that price will be about $430.
[01:02:06.512 --> 01:02:19.442]  And I told you folks, and this is all a scam, we got oil, giant oil fields everywhere, just so much oil it's unbelievable.
[01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:26.438]  And just like they staged the energy crisis in the seventies, that's admitted, they're going to stage this.
[01:02:26.678 --> 01:02:28.980]  And what are you going to do about it?
[01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.261]  It's part of the New World Order.
[01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:33.463]  You've got five big oil companies globally now.
[01:02:35.425 --> 01:02:37.426]  And they're scamming you big time.
[01:02:38.227 --> 01:02:40.829]  So we'll get into that report as well.
[01:02:41.449 --> 01:02:44.592]  And of course your phone calls when we get back from this break.
[01:02:44.672 --> 01:02:46.753]  And I'm sorry if I'm laughing.
[01:02:47.014 --> 01:02:47.434]  It's just
[01:02:49.190 --> 01:03:02.438]  To watch the New World Order raping the American people, and to know that it's going to get a lot worse, it's very painful to me.
[01:03:03.799 --> 01:03:14.466]  But I have to laugh because so many arrogant people who think they're members of the establishment, who serve this corrupt system, who make excuses, this is going to be a wake-up call for them.
[01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:16.367]  All of this is.
[01:03:18.112 --> 01:03:21.975]  The sad part is, is many of these little minions will just go along with it and think it's great.
[01:03:21.995 --> 01:03:25.398]  In fact, the scarier they get, the more they'll bootlick the system.
[01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:33.885]  Which only makes it worse for all of us, so... I guess I should be crying instead of laughing and cackling.
[01:03:34.926 --> 01:03:36.567]  It's just, it's too rich.
[01:03:37.788 --> 01:03:44.634]  At a certain point, it just defies belief, just how bad things have already gotten.
[01:03:45.828 --> 01:03:49.870]  The average person's busy watching sitcoms and has no idea what I'm even talking about.
[01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:57.813]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.993 --> 01:04:02.435]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:06.976]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:08.337]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.097 --> 01:04:09.918]  Panama.
[01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:14.363]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.423 --> 01:04:21.351]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:23.494]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:34.276]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.456 --> 01:04:39.857]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:52.519 --> 01:05:59.164]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:05:59.504 --> 01:06:09.612]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, and particularly the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:11.773]  With a 100% kill.

[01:06:45.246 --> 01:06:45.706]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.346 --> 01:07:00.367]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.108 --> 01:07:02.209]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:03.671]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.431 --> 01:07:05.312]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.332 --> 01:07:09.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.197 --> 01:07:14.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.263 --> 01:07:17.425]  Alright, we're gonna go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:32.354]  And then later in this hour, I'm going to read large sections of HB 2893 written by the insurance companies, which are owned by the big banks, owned by the military-industrial complex, and predominantly owned by the media.
[01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:36.356]  That's the top of the food chain with the elite, is these insurance companies.
[01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:43.160]  It's a lengthy six-page bill, but to boil it down, this will be the same model all over the country.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.701]  We've already seen this in other areas.
[01:07:47.082 --> 01:07:48.403]  When you get insurance,
[01:07:50.131 --> 01:08:03.837]  The insurance company will issue you a number and they will report instantly through their computer systems to the Texas Department of Public Safety whether your insurance is up to date.
[01:08:05.278 --> 01:08:17.844]  When you get your tags, when you get your sticker yearly that your car is up to date, that you paid your tax, it will have a transponder affixed to it and it says in here
[01:08:18.954 --> 01:08:21.997]  It's to make sure we're all safe and everyone has their insurance.
[01:08:24.219 --> 01:08:35.249]  But then you read into it, it says that the main reason, it says it in here, that the transponder will be red for the purposes of toll roads statewide.
[01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.052]  So see, that's how they do it.
[01:08:38.472 --> 01:08:40.934]  Oh, it's to make sure you've got your insurance.
[01:08:42.115 --> 01:08:43.717]  To make sure you're up to date.
[01:08:44.776 --> 01:08:52.703]  And then the police cars will also have these readers, and they'll be able to type into a computer and pick up off the readers that they're already putting up everywhere.
[01:08:53.103 --> 01:08:56.967]  When you drive by, it'll scan and tell them where you're at, so it'll also be a tracking system.
[01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:00.350]  Because all of us don't have cell phones.
[01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:03.352]  Since 2001, all new cell phones track you down to 15 feet.
[01:09:03.392 --> 01:09:08.016]  Because they have GPS in the cell towers, and they triangulate off the radio signal.
[01:09:08.037 --> 01:09:10.699]  It's actually the microwave signal.
[01:09:11.337 --> 01:09:11.879]  We're good to go.
[01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.453]  No, that's going on, and you'll be happy to go along with it.
[01:09:26.214 --> 01:09:26.774]  Federal law.
[01:09:27.235 --> 01:09:30.537]  But still, some of you don't have a cell phone, so we've got to do this.
[01:09:30.897 --> 01:09:37.183]  Most cars already have the black boxes that track how fast you drive, how you brake, what you did, but that's only if you're in a wreck.
[01:09:37.223 --> 01:09:38.223]  They then use that against you.
[01:09:38.504 --> 01:09:48.231]  This new system will track how fast you drive from reader to reader point, along with the cameras that scan your license plates, and it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:50.033]  You know, it's funny.
[01:09:51.790 --> 01:10:10.135]  As I said earlier, 90 plus percent of Austinites and Houstonites, it's 98 percent in Houston, are against the fact that they're going to take almost every major road, all the major thoroughfares, existing 70-year-old roads in many cases, and turn them into toll roads.
[01:10:12.735 --> 01:10:18.397]  Because in the past, you know, they build a new road, it is free market, a private company does it, they charge a toll for 10 years.
[01:10:18.697 --> 01:10:19.197]  Fine!
[01:10:20.003 --> 01:10:22.724]  They pay people for the property they get to build the road.
[01:10:23.305 --> 01:10:24.485]  It's a toll road for 10 years.
[01:10:24.525 --> 01:10:25.466]  They take the toll down.
[01:10:26.126 --> 01:10:29.267]  Growing up in Dallas, I saw many roads that were tolls and not tolls anymore.
[01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:30.568]  Free market, baby.
[01:10:30.648 --> 01:10:31.028]  I love it.
[01:10:31.868 --> 01:10:35.250]  It is not free market to go, we're going to take all the existing roads.
[01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:41.693]  I mean, folks, all the big existing state highways, federal, all the major roads.
[01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:44.014]  When I say all, I mean all the major ones.
[01:10:44.054 --> 01:10:46.435]  The major ones you've got to use to get places.
[01:10:47.135 --> 01:10:47.996]  Little neighborhoods, no.
[01:10:49.164 --> 01:10:50.225]  Little side street to know.
[01:10:52.466 --> 01:11:02.512]  And, uh, they've been saying on the news, oh, well, they say that, don't worry, you won't have to drive through a toll road booth, it won't slow traffic.
[01:11:02.532 --> 01:11:03.812]  And people go, well, give us the tails.
[01:11:03.832 --> 01:11:06.134]  And they go, you'll see, you'll see.
[01:11:06.594 --> 01:11:11.737]  And three years ago, they were putting in the toll readers, which are just scanners, antennas,
[01:11:12.705 --> 01:11:24.154]  Transponder readers, I mean, we have the federal plans, and then here's a picture of it, you know, of the RFID reader I saw eight years ago, government documents, and wow, I could walk down the street from my house and there they are!
[01:11:24.294 --> 01:11:28.517]  And then they go, well, we're not going to tell you how we're going to do it, but just don't worry.
[01:11:29.678 --> 01:11:31.139]  And then now they're telling us as we knew.
[01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:32.280]  Transponders.
[01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:36.804]  Just insane.
[01:11:38.645 --> 01:11:41.808]  And they have transponders in the Bay Area around San Francisco,
[01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:45.426]  And the price is much higher if you pay cash.
[01:11:45.466 --> 01:11:47.086]  They penalize you just like Illinois.
[01:11:47.586 --> 01:11:49.707]  Double the price in Illinois if you don't have the transponder.
[01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:53.108]  So everybody gets the transponder.
[01:11:53.128 --> 01:11:58.289]  And then they caught them in the San Francisco area putting up hundreds of radio readers to track people.
[01:11:58.389 --> 01:12:04.311]  And your little RFID has your name, number, social security, driver's license.
[01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:05.071]  It's all on there.
[01:12:07.312 --> 01:12:09.812]  And of course they don't care if it causes identity theft on top of it.
[01:12:09.852 --> 01:12:11.873]  People can just walk up with a scanner and get that info.
[01:12:14.366 --> 01:12:20.650]  And Visa has announced by 2007, all of their cards will have chips in them.
[01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:23.852]  Just when your card expires, you'll get your new chip on them.
[01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:29.855]  It's the exact same parameters as they've got the scanner readers in the grocery stores already up.
[01:12:30.336 --> 01:12:42.243]  In any new grocery store, if it's a Safeway or a Kroger's or it's been in the USA today, they've already got readers up testing smart shelves with microphones that listen to you and
[01:12:43.611 --> 01:12:44.831]  It's there, folks.
[01:12:44.872 --> 01:12:45.892]  It's total control.
[01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:48.955]  So everywhere you go, you're tracked and traced.
[01:12:50.436 --> 01:12:51.977]  And it's all about control.
[01:12:51.997 --> 01:12:55.540]  They're going to have criminal watch lists, terrorist watch lists.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.842]  If you've got bad credit, you'll get a yellow rating.
[01:12:58.502 --> 01:13:01.404]  The cops will say, well, you don't have any Fourth Amendment because you've got a yellow rating.
[01:13:02.525 --> 01:13:04.547]  I saw Ridge three years ago say this on C-SPAN.
[01:13:04.607 --> 01:13:08.330]  I mean, folks, this is worse than Brave New World.
[01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:09.090]  Worse than 1984.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.241]  And I gotta commend the people, actually.
[01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:15.882]  Ninety-plus percent of you are against it.
[01:13:17.203 --> 01:13:19.104]  Even though you don't know the full scope.
[01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:21.466]  You know a transponder in your car taxing is bad.
[01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:27.970]  But, again, the politicians just say, hey, vote us out if you don't like it and laugh.
[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:32.653]  And then, by the way, did we mention we just put in electronic voting machines with no record of how you voted?
[01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:33.694]  Ha ha ha!
[01:13:34.054 --> 01:13:37.236]  That matter of the exit polls show that somebody else won.
[01:13:37.316 --> 01:13:38.577]  We always win now.
[01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:42.718]  Then you look at who owns the companies.
[01:13:43.058 --> 01:13:44.779]  Hardener Civics, owned by Clear Channel.
[01:13:45.519 --> 01:13:55.204]  The son of the son-in-law of the daughter of the owner of Clear Channel, Lowry Mays.
[01:13:57.185 --> 01:13:58.486]  He runs unopposed.
[01:13:58.506 --> 01:13:58.946]  People knew.
[01:13:58.966 --> 01:14:00.427]  Nobody ran against him in Austin.
[01:14:03.008 --> 01:14:07.331]  But even in the primaries, when he did have Republicans running against him, no Democrat ran against him.
[01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:08.111]  They're in on the game.
[01:14:09.162 --> 01:14:11.924]  The polls all showed the other guy was going to win, but it didn't matter.
[01:14:11.984 --> 01:14:12.724]  He was confident.
[01:14:13.885 --> 01:14:16.447]  This is, I mean, you know, his father-in-law owned the voting machines.
[01:14:17.607 --> 01:14:19.648]  And was his number one contributor on top of that.
[01:14:19.668 --> 01:14:22.830]  And he's a good Republican anyways.
[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:30.075]  I mean, he helped protect Janet Reno, her own personal lawyer, on Waco, on... on everything.
[01:14:32.276 --> 01:14:33.957]  On Shinagate, he helped cover that up.
[01:14:34.517 --> 01:14:35.238]  Michael McCall.
[01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:40.261]  That's just how it works!
[01:14:41.202 --> 01:14:45.864]  The other big three voting machine companies are all run by former CIA Directors or Deputy Directors.
[01:14:45.904 --> 01:14:48.345]  One of them is headed up by the former head of the NSA.
[01:14:48.385 --> 01:14:51.287]  They're all Generals and Admirals up there running it.
[01:14:52.027 --> 01:14:55.189]  We've talked to folks that have gone into these buildings, walked into this receptionist.
[01:14:55.249 --> 01:14:58.470]  It'll be a young man with a short haircut with a bulge under his jacket.
[01:14:59.511 --> 01:15:00.311]  Excuse me one moment.
[01:15:00.511 --> 01:15:01.612]  Sector 784Q.
[01:15:01.992 --> 01:15:04.934]  Call in the guards, lead you out in black uniforms.
[01:15:04.994 --> 01:15:05.594]  It's government!
[01:15:05.614 --> 01:15:07.015]  These are CIA offices!
[01:15:09.108 --> 01:15:09.868]  You don't believe that?
[01:15:09.888 --> 01:15:11.569]  I mean, you know about the fake newscast, right?
[01:15:11.949 --> 01:15:15.571]  The Pentagon paying for hundreds of millions in fake newscasts and fake reporters.
[01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.032]  Folks, it's bad, okay?
[01:15:17.772 --> 01:15:19.473]  They're taking us for all we're worth!
[01:15:21.714 --> 01:15:23.715]  Well, in which case, we're still alive!
[01:15:24.175 --> 01:15:28.897]  Because there's thousands of prominent people like myself fighting, and a lot of people in government are good.
[01:15:29.978 --> 01:15:31.199]  Most people in government are good.
[01:15:31.239 --> 01:15:38.082]  It's all compartmentalized with very evil people at the top, and they're trying to sell us on evil so their minions will accept these programs.
[01:15:38.644 --> 01:15:41.166]  We're in a death fight for this country, folks.
[01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:42.727]  America is dying.
[01:15:42.767 --> 01:15:43.927]  We have a chance to save her.
[01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.490]  But I'm begging you.
[01:15:49.371 --> 01:15:51.012]  I'm pleading with you to get involved.
[01:15:52.012 --> 01:15:56.815]  I'm glad that most of you don't like what's happening, but I'm upset that you don't get involved.
[01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:57.916]  You don't start websites.
[01:15:57.936 --> 01:15:58.976]  You don't sue people.
[01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:00.858]  You don't do investigations.
[01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.319]  You don't expose.
[01:16:03.739 --> 01:16:05.060]  I mean, that's what we can do.
[01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:08.022]  You don't say no to these systems.
[01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:13.319]  You don't call in the local talk stations and demand they talk about this bill.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.102]  HB 2893.
[01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:20.723]  You gotta get involved.
[01:16:21.764 --> 01:16:23.165]  Let's go to, who's up next here?
[01:16:24.545 --> 01:16:25.406]  Steve in Georgia.
[01:16:25.446 --> 01:16:26.066]  Go ahead Steve.
[01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:27.307]  Hi Alex.
[01:16:27.647 --> 01:16:27.947]  Hello.
[01:16:28.628 --> 01:16:32.370]  Thank you for allowing we the people to exercise our First Amendment right.
[01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:38.213]  This morning while driving to work, I passed the post office and noticed the flag
[01:16:38.703 --> 01:16:49.410]  Flying at half mast, our government post office, and after observing the network being inundated with Vatican news, I felt I had to call.
[01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:56.255]  I know how careful you are, being neutral about religion, so I'm not calling to talk about religion.
[01:16:56.435 --> 01:16:59.037]  Sir, you can talk about whatever you want, we don't censor you.
[01:16:59.557 --> 01:17:00.057]  Okay, I know.
[01:17:00.077 --> 01:17:01.278]  You can talk about whatever you want.
[01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:05.421]  I want to tell the listeners, you do not censor, and I appreciate that.
[01:17:05.581 --> 01:17:07.002]  We the people appreciate that.
[01:17:07.992 --> 01:17:11.775]  And so, and I'm not going to talk about the sincere Catholic people.
[01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:26.086]  I'm just calling to talk about a global political power that hides behind the facade of a church whose avowed purpose for hundreds of years has been to destroy our Constitution.
[01:17:27.127 --> 01:17:36.854]  Alex, you and I and most Americans used to know at least a hundred years ago that our country was founded by people fleeing persecution from European government
[01:17:37.455 --> 01:17:45.022]  that were controlled by the Vatican and as a consequence millions of Christians were martyred.
[01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:54.331]  From the beginning the Vatican has hated our form of popular government because it's supposed to be ruled by we the people.
[01:17:54.351 --> 01:18:03.299]  Now one major tool that the Vatican has used over the last couple hundred years was
[01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:30.909]  the tool of immigration and Samuel Morse you know the inventor of Telegraph and the Morse Code he exposed this plan in the 1830s when he wrote about it in the New York Observer and later published his articles from that paper in a book which I have and in that book he exposed this plan out that the Vatican is trying to make America Catholic and I hear some music
[01:18:32.614 --> 01:18:34.475]  I'll let you finish up quickly on the other side.
[01:18:34.495 --> 01:18:36.636]  People are welcome to call in and respond to what you're saying.
[01:18:37.157 --> 01:18:40.118]  I'd like you to send me that information, but to stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:45.241]  Steve, we'll go to Eric, Chris, John, Ron, and many others.
[01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.303]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:51.044]  800-259-9231 is the number to call in.
[01:18:51.745 --> 01:18:57.568]  Hi folks, Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.928 --> 01:18:58.889]  The real money folks.
[01:19:02.188 --> 01:19:04.109]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:05.589]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:07.070]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.530]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:10.911]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[01:19:10.931 --> 01:19:14.232]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:19:14.252 --> 01:19:15.593]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:19:15.633 --> 01:19:16.773]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.668 --> 01:19:32.709]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:38.412]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.712 --> 01:19:43.654]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[01:19:47.715 --> 01:19:48.996]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.627 --> 01:19:57.108]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:19:57.368 --> 01:20:00.869]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:00.969 --> 01:20:04.910]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:05.151 --> 01:20:11.292]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:19.615]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:20.035 --> 01:20:20.916]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.969 --> 01:20:36.450]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:40.072]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:02.575 --> 01:21:09.459]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:19.125]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:28.190]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:53.613 --> 01:21:54.774]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.054 --> 01:22:00.038]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.298 --> 01:22:02.900]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:11.646]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:22:45.646 --> 01:22:49.370]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[01:22:53.795 --> 01:22:55.978]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.559 --> 01:22:59.342]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.336 --> 01:23:07.859]  Alright, I need to hurry through these calls, but you can go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Steve.
[01:23:07.879 --> 01:23:08.300]  Go ahead.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.320]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:21.067]  I was saying how, back in the 1830s, inventor Samuel Morse uncovered a plot to make America Catholic, and the main tool was through immigration.
[01:23:21.287 --> 01:23:27.731]  And if you look at history, the records you'll see, there was a massive influx of Irish Catholics and Italian Catholics.
[01:23:28.411 --> 01:23:31.313]  Now it's happening all over again, only they're Mexican
[01:23:32.071 --> 01:23:34.617]  Roman Catholic voters coming across the border.
[01:23:34.657 --> 01:23:41.853]  Well it hasn't worked very well if that's the case because there's 40 million Catholics in America and the Catholic Church is falling apart.
[01:23:42.395 --> 01:23:46.598]  But I believe... The New World Order... I mean, certainly there's been corruption in the Catholic Church.
[01:23:46.638 --> 01:23:47.498]  I'm not going to deny that.
[01:23:48.059 --> 01:23:50.880]  I've actually studied its history quite a bit and had a lot of expert guests on.
[01:23:51.401 --> 01:24:05.109]  But, I mean, I would say the Catholic Church has been... I mean, even if you're saying it was evil before, something else has taken it over and is basically turning it on its head, even from what it was before.
[01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:06.991]  You know, something that's amazing is
[01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:11.192]  Well, look, people say the Jesuits run the Catholic Church and the Black Pope.
[01:24:11.432 --> 01:24:14.533]  Well, why did Pope John Paul II then go after the Jesuits?
[01:24:15.053 --> 01:24:16.953]  Well, they are controlled sometimes.
[01:24:17.313 --> 01:24:21.234]  They will destroy their own to make them look more innocent, I believe.
[01:24:21.254 --> 01:24:25.555]  And when you study history... So you think the Catholic Church is the head of the New World Order?
[01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:29.856]  I think the Jesuits, the Vatican... I'm not talking about the Catholic people.
[01:24:30.356 --> 01:24:33.517]  I believe that the Jesuits and the Vatican
[01:24:34.455 --> 01:24:39.840]  In other orders, as in New World Order, of the Vatican, is running our country.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.621]  I really do.
[01:24:40.641 --> 01:24:42.383]  I think they're heavily influenced.
[01:24:42.443 --> 01:24:44.024]  Just look at the media right now.
[01:24:44.285 --> 01:24:46.146]  What do you see when you turn the TV on?
[01:24:46.767 --> 01:24:49.209]  Look at half-mast at our government building.
[01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:54.855]  Early in the 1960s, JFK flew from D.C.
[01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:59.479]  down to Texas to reassure a group of Protestant ministers that he would
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:01.761]  Maintain the separation of churches.
[01:25:01.822 --> 01:25:02.782]  No, I know.
[01:25:03.043 --> 01:25:05.224]  That's what he was coming to Texas for when they killed him.
[01:25:05.605 --> 01:25:07.826]  So if he was so New World Order, why did they kill him?
[01:25:08.147 --> 01:25:11.129]  And then, in this same New York, I think... Well, let me answer my question.
[01:25:11.249 --> 01:25:11.770]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.691]  If he was so New World Order, why did they kill him?
[01:25:14.612 --> 01:25:17.134]  Well, maybe he wasn't going along with their plan.
[01:25:17.554 --> 01:25:17.895]  Well, no.
[01:25:17.955 --> 01:25:19.876]  He wasn't going along with the plan.
[01:25:19.896 --> 01:25:23.760]  But if he was this Catholic agent, and the Catholics run things, why would they kill him?
[01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:28.824]  What I'm telling you is... Look, I've really looked at this.
[01:25:30.888 --> 01:25:33.009]  Devil worshippers run the New World Order.
[01:25:33.469 --> 01:25:33.849]  Okay?
[01:25:34.609 --> 01:25:36.830]  High-level Masons run the New World Order.
[01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:41.212]  And they have infiltrated the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jews.
[01:25:42.092 --> 01:25:45.333]  And so I can criticize all these groups because they haven't infiltrated.
[01:25:45.793 --> 01:25:51.995]  But to say one group runs it all... Yes, one group does run it all, and it's the Luciferians.
[01:25:52.656 --> 01:25:55.256]  But that isn't saying all Masons even know about this.
[01:25:55.657 --> 01:25:58.558]  Ninety-eight percent of Masons aren't even in the higher echelons.
[01:25:58.838 --> 01:25:59.678]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:26:00.552 --> 01:26:08.900]  Very interesting points, and I'm fully aware of the excesses of any big government institution, and the Catholic Church has done a lot of things that are bad.
[01:26:12.364 --> 01:26:19.511]  Now we will descend into people calling up bashing Catholics, bashing Protestants, back and forth.
[01:26:20.432 --> 01:26:24.316]  I'm a believer in Jesus Christ.
[01:26:25.542 --> 01:26:26.383]  And I don't hide that.
[01:26:26.403 --> 01:26:27.124]  I'm not ashamed of that.
[01:26:27.144 --> 01:26:27.744]  I'm proud of that.
[01:26:28.224 --> 01:26:31.187]  But I do a news show, and certainly it's been wall-to-wall coverage of the Pope.
[01:26:32.528 --> 01:26:38.713]  But, folks, it's wall-to-wall coverage of Michael Jackson, wall-to-wall coverage of Terry Schiavo, O.J.
[01:26:38.753 --> 01:26:39.113]  Simpson.
[01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:42.315]  I mean, they pick things they want to turn into a circus.
[01:26:43.336 --> 01:26:47.139]  And I'll tell you what is important is this conclave that's coming up and the next Pope they do pick.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.263]  And if that Pope's a New World Order agent, we will expose him.
[01:26:56.081 --> 01:26:56.401]  I don't know.
[01:26:56.641 --> 01:27:01.464]  I've got to ask, why does the media expose the Catholic Church and all the pedophilia, which it should?
[01:27:02.224 --> 01:27:03.385]  And that stuff is going on.
[01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:09.348]  But why don't they talk about DynCorp and 200,000 women and children?
[01:27:10.909 --> 01:27:11.429]  I mean, why?
[01:27:11.989 --> 01:27:12.609]  That's admitted.
[01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:18.772]  You see, if the Vatican controlled things, why would they be destroying their own church?
[01:27:19.973 --> 01:27:23.795]  There is some fighting going on, I think, at the higher echelons of this whole thing.
[01:27:27.637 --> 01:27:36.724]  Again, I mean, it is a... The Catholic Church is a favorite thing for people to say, you know, it's the beast, it's the antichrist, it's gonna get us.
[01:27:37.945 --> 01:27:43.130]  And I have no doubt that in this new world order, you know, it'll be taken over, or has been taken over, and it'll be used.
[01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:44.551]  I'm not saying it's not being used.
[01:27:44.571 --> 01:27:48.594]  I mean, it's full of horrible stuff.
[01:27:49.495 --> 01:27:57.141]  But, I mean, we got Pat Robertson flashing the lion's paw on the cover of Time Magazine and telling us microchips are good and abortion is good in China.
[01:27:57.893 --> 01:27:59.874]  I mean, he said it on CNN, folks.
[01:28:00.294 --> 01:28:01.894]  And Protestants get mad at me.
[01:28:02.474 --> 01:28:03.775]  I've been brought up a Protestant.
[01:28:04.155 --> 01:28:05.415]  Call me a Protestant if you want.
[01:28:06.596 --> 01:28:09.397]  But, I mean, I don't follow these Protestant leaders, folks.
[01:28:11.057 --> 01:28:13.278]  I mean, I got criticized for bashing Pat Robertson.
[01:28:14.778 --> 01:28:18.780]  Well, I know he did say that, Alex, but still, he's a good man and don't talk bad about him.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.021]  Well, I didn't say it, so don't blame me for him saying it.
[01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:25.962]  I didn't say we need a new world order like Pope John Paul II said.
[01:28:26.986 --> 01:28:28.307]  Don't blame me, blame him!
[01:28:28.327 --> 01:28:30.969]  Yeah, I just report what these people are doing.
[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:37.473]  And, you know, the Bible tells us that the devil controls the governments and the institutions.
[01:28:38.633 --> 01:28:40.915]  The people in high places, and he rules this world.
[01:28:44.017 --> 01:28:47.019]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:50.621]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.903 --> 01:28:56.265]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.505 --> 01:29:00.348]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:01.489]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.929 --> 01:29:06.052]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.272 --> 01:29:10.455]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.835 --> 01:29:15.699]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:16.079 --> 01:29:19.661]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.862 --> 01:29:25.205]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.224]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.464 --> 01:31:12.511]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:18.997]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.137 --> 01:31:20.358]  There are no side effects.

[01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:42.151]  Call today.
[01:31:42.171 --> 01:31:44.772]  Alright, I'm going to bam, bam, bam through your calls.
[01:31:44.792 --> 01:31:47.194]  Because I want to get into this actual bill.
[01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:14.617]  And this bill shows the control grid they're building for taxation, tracking, and total control with the transponders in the cars under the federal mandates.
[01:32:15.518 --> 01:32:17.439]  But right now let's go to Eric in California.
[01:32:17.519 --> 01:32:18.300]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:18.780]  Go ahead.
[01:32:19.321 --> 01:32:20.682]  Thank you very much, Alex, for having me on.
[01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:29.468]  Hey, I want to tell you that I've been doing a lot of research on nforest.com and prison planet and really trying to get my friends into it, but the saddest fact
[01:32:29.952 --> 01:32:31.374]  is that they're not coming to it.
[01:32:31.534 --> 01:32:35.699]  How is it, Alex, that we are actually supposed to fight this New World Order?
[01:32:35.859 --> 01:32:47.212]  Well, it's hard to wake up new people by saying, go look at a bunch of government bills and documents on Infowars.com because, frankly, your friends probably don't even read the newspaper, much less 50 to 75 articles a day on the websites.
[01:32:50.416 --> 01:32:57.962]  But let me tell you, videos, people are, we're a society that watches now, we don't read on average as much as we used to.
[01:32:58.342 --> 01:33:02.165]  That's where my videos come in, get my videos, make copies of them, give them to people.
[01:33:02.606 --> 01:33:08.771]  I have found my films are very, very effective at waking people up, so I would suggest you do that.
[01:33:09.825 --> 01:33:14.612]  Uh, so many scholars that we have that are experts on the global crime syndicate write books.
[01:33:15.073 --> 01:33:19.158]  And I've written a book, but books are not as effective for the general public.
[01:33:19.218 --> 01:33:19.999]  Videos are.
[01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:21.522]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:24.926]  Uh, I mean, I've been like, well that's what I meant to say in the original place.
[01:33:25.026 --> 01:33:26.048]  I've been showing a lot of the videos.
[01:33:26.108 --> 01:33:26.769]  One of them was, uh,
[01:33:27.225 --> 01:33:35.210]  Also, my friend, the Marshall Law video, which is... I mean, that video right there, I mean, I've seen George Humphrey's 9-11, The Great Illusion, and your Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:49.699]  Which, by the way, I find that video just completely strange, and how we've been so enticed with this saintinistic ritual, which... I don't understand, if this is a Christian nation, how come our presidents are deliberately doing it, and no one is reporting this?
[01:33:49.779 --> 01:33:51.540]  No CBS News or anything like that?
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.441]  Well, Hollywood flaunts it.
[01:33:53.481 --> 01:33:56.183]  Have you ever seen the Tom Hanks movie, Dragnet?
[01:33:56.812 --> 01:33:57.252]  Dragnet?
[01:33:57.312 --> 01:33:57.952]  No, I haven't.
[01:33:58.032 --> 01:33:59.633]  It's a comedy made in the 80s.
[01:33:59.673 --> 01:34:00.533]  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:00.633 --> 01:34:01.553]  I remember.
[01:34:01.833 --> 01:34:02.893]  Okay.
[01:34:03.233 --> 01:34:13.075]  The Playboy magazine owner, he's a bad guy, but he's not, you know, really bad, but the Christian leader is really the devil worshiper?
[01:34:13.735 --> 01:34:15.895]  You see, that's Hollywood throwing it in our face.
[01:34:16.196 --> 01:34:17.096]  Oh, I see.
[01:34:17.136 --> 01:34:21.016]  I remember that movie where they went with Dan Aykroyd, and they're all disguised.
[01:34:21.076 --> 01:34:22.977]  I remember seeing... Yeah, and it's a comedy.
[01:34:22.997 --> 01:34:24.177]  It's real funny, but the point is,
[01:34:25.138 --> 01:34:27.260]  Have you seen Eyes Wide Shut by Stanley Kubrick?
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.062]  Oh, I was too young to see it, but I know Stanley Kubrick.
[01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:42.233]  I saw a lot of his... Yeah, it's not a film for children, but the point is, is that from all our inside details, senators, congressmen, documents, mainstream news, FBI investigations, that's what they really do.
[01:34:42.273 --> 01:34:44.975]  Now, I was inside Bohemian Grove for five hours.
[01:34:45.035 --> 01:34:46.116]  It goes on for 15 days.
[01:34:46.737 --> 01:34:47.998]  That's what goes on, sir.
[01:34:48.899 --> 01:34:50.500]  And, you know,
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:56.841]  This is Kubrick only made films about real things or things that were going to happen.
[01:34:56.861 --> 01:34:57.782]  Very visionary.
[01:34:58.302 --> 01:35:00.783]  And his film is about what really goes on.
[01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:01.383]  Really?
[01:35:01.503 --> 01:35:08.885]  And the last thing is that, now this is going to sound really strange, but honestly do you think we can really do something about this?
[01:35:08.905 --> 01:35:10.145]  Because I've been telling my friends about
[01:35:10.598 --> 01:35:16.159]  That the 9-11 incident actually did happen, and like, it was confronted by the government, and no one really seems to care.
[01:35:16.479 --> 01:35:18.040]  It's just like, yeah, yeah, whatever, like that.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.120]  And it's just like, they're not seeing this image.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.321]  I mean, do you really think there's any possibility, Alex, that we can really stop this thing?
[01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:26.642]  You're calling me from California?
[01:35:26.782 --> 01:35:27.302]  That is correct.
[01:35:27.542 --> 01:35:28.582]  Where are you in California?
[01:35:28.662 --> 01:35:29.522]  I'm in San Diego.
[01:35:30.382 --> 01:35:31.443]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[01:35:31.483 --> 01:35:32.983]  Let me comment on that.
[01:35:34.065 --> 01:35:36.766]  There are places I call kind of dead zones.
[01:35:37.327 --> 01:35:40.348]  I mean, I'm on, what, two affiliates in California.
[01:35:40.448 --> 01:35:44.691]  One of them, in between San Diego and L.A., covers most of both those cities.
[01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:46.652]  God bless that fine affiliate.
[01:35:46.672 --> 01:35:47.792]  In fact, we're on there right now.
[01:35:48.873 --> 01:35:49.253]  Live.
[01:35:50.414 --> 01:35:53.295]  This hour particularly is carried live there.
[01:35:56.132 --> 01:35:57.013]  Five people a day.
[01:35:57.073 --> 01:35:58.013]  I mean, I do this all the time.
[01:35:58.033 --> 01:36:03.896]  I'll be driving in my car and a guy's got talk radio on next to me and I'll lean over here in Austin and I'll go, tune to 100.1.
[01:36:04.857 --> 01:36:05.797]  You want to hear of the truth?
[01:36:06.598 --> 01:36:08.118]  I'll do it in grocery store lines.
[01:36:08.519 --> 01:36:11.620]  Humans are supposed to communicate with each other and get involved and talk.
[01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:14.722]  But California really is bad.
[01:36:14.742 --> 01:36:18.824]  I mean, it's the most populous state, a key state, and the propaganda is worse there than other places.
[01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:24.587]  But, you know, you sound like you've got some young friends that are kind of nihilistic and only care about themselves.
[01:36:25.328 --> 01:36:26.589]  I would just move on to others.
[01:36:26.889 --> 01:36:28.290]  I mean, pearls before swine.
[01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:30.832]  When somebody doesn't want to be warned, just move on, sir.
[01:36:30.852 --> 01:36:33.094]  Don't spend all day on people that go, ah, yeah, so what?
[01:36:33.835 --> 01:36:37.318]  I've found a lot of people will go, oh, yeah, the government did carry out 9-11, so what?
[01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:43.382]  I know good old boys, successful in business, that go, well, we had to do that to get them Arabs, I guess, you know.
[01:36:43.402 --> 01:36:44.583]  It's part of business.
[01:36:45.464 --> 01:36:46.805]  They think they're part of the system.
[01:36:48.847 --> 01:36:54.131]  So, a lot of people when they're faced with something that they know is true deep inside their guts, in their bones,
[01:36:55.021 --> 01:36:56.202]  They'll just go along with it.
[01:36:57.003 --> 01:37:05.468]  But you tell your friends that Governor Schwarzenegger wants to put satellite tracker boxes and transponders in all cars and tax you by the mile 65 cents a mile.
[01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:07.189]  That'll get their attention.
[01:37:08.931 --> 01:37:10.071]  That'll get their attention.
[01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:12.493]  That's going on right now out there.
[01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:15.175]  I guarantee you they'll think about themselves.
[01:37:16.457 --> 01:37:25.345]  And they'll laugh at you now, and when those transponders go in, in the next 12 to 18 months, as they're scheduled to, your little friends won't be laughing anymore.
[01:37:26.326 --> 01:37:29.009]  So, look, number one, you've got to be confident, too.
[01:37:29.049 --> 01:37:35.795]  When you've got an attitude of, yeah, I know you don't want to believe me, but, and I'm not being condescending, I'm just telling you, you want an answer, I'll give you one.
[01:37:37.016 --> 01:37:38.658]  I know this sounds weird, but it's true.
[01:37:39.198 --> 01:37:41.220]  People don't, people don't listen to that.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.221]  You've got to be bold.
[01:37:44.039 --> 01:37:45.821]  And you've got to telegraph confidence.
[01:37:46.041 --> 01:37:47.222]  And I don't do that on purpose.
[01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:49.224]  I am confident.
[01:37:49.724 --> 01:37:50.805]  That is real confidence.
[01:37:51.286 --> 01:37:52.046]  I've got a mission.
[01:37:52.187 --> 01:37:52.927]  I'm warning someone.
[01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:53.568]  I'm right.
[01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:54.989]  I've done my homework.
[01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:56.110]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:57.191]  Hey, listen to me.
[01:37:57.231 --> 01:37:58.132]  You're being enslaved.
[01:37:58.392 --> 01:37:59.513]  You better check this out.
[01:38:00.254 --> 01:38:03.157]  You've got to connect with them on that almost animal level.
[01:38:05.058 --> 01:38:07.561]  You know, it's like a bird will alert and make a chirp.
[01:38:08.061 --> 01:38:09.843]  A crow will to warn the other crows.
[01:38:10.649 --> 01:38:13.250]  You know, he doesn't kind of sheepishly chirp.
[01:38:13.731 --> 01:38:14.511]  He... Ha!
[01:38:14.571 --> 01:38:15.051]  Ka!
[01:38:15.111 --> 01:38:15.572]  Ka!
[01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:17.493]  You know, people still have that instinct.
[01:38:17.513 --> 01:38:18.273]  You've got to warn them.
[01:38:18.553 --> 01:38:18.953]  Hey!
[01:38:19.133 --> 01:38:22.735]  You know... One of by land, two of by sea, or whatever it is.
[01:38:22.775 --> 01:38:23.876]  The redcoats are coming.
[01:38:23.956 --> 01:38:24.556]  Wake up!
[01:38:26.177 --> 01:38:27.478]  You've got to have that attitude.
[01:38:28.919 --> 01:38:30.439]  Now I want to play that song, Revolution.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.040]  Ha!
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:31.280]  Ha!
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:32.901]  I think that says it all.
[01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:37.243]  But, uh... You know, I can't control myself.
[01:38:38.797 --> 01:38:39.578]  Fine revolution.
[01:38:39.598 --> 01:38:40.598]  I want to play that in a second.
[01:38:41.379 --> 01:38:41.979]  Let's go ahead.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.240]  See, I've got to move quicker.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.722]  I just spent five minutes with that guy.
[01:38:44.762 --> 01:38:45.382]  Good call, though.
[01:38:45.942 --> 01:38:47.243]  Chris in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:38:47.263 --> 01:38:48.084]  Hello, Alex.
[01:38:48.244 --> 01:38:58.432]  Alex, have you seen this week's edition of American Free Press that states 11,000 of our veterans from the first Persian Gulf War have died from depleted uranium?
[01:38:58.952 --> 01:39:00.754]  There was a total... I think it's more than that.
[01:39:00.894 --> 01:39:01.254]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:01.534 --> 01:39:02.475]  Well, I'm getting there.
[01:39:02.635 --> 01:39:05.817]  Well, anyway, it's 11,000 right now, and out of the
[01:39:07.638 --> 01:39:10.180]  580,000 troops that went over there.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.805]  325,000 of them have tested positive for depleted uranium.
[01:39:16.305 --> 01:39:20.909]  And within the next couple of years, the Veterans Administration expects 518,000.
[01:39:21.009 --> 01:39:27.695]  But listen, in double-think land, up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black,
[01:39:28.644 --> 01:39:29.905]  You've got to support the troops.
[01:39:29.985 --> 01:39:37.994]  Supporting them means not caring about them, putting a plastic flag made in China by slaves on your car, and supporting the government putting them in a meat grinder.
[01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:40.677]  So supporting the troops means you don't care about them.
[01:39:41.338 --> 01:39:43.821]  See, you really care about the troops, so you're bad.
[01:39:44.622 --> 01:39:47.565]  Well, the thing that interested me the most is the Pentagon
[01:39:48.038 --> 01:39:50.900]  Denied depleted uranium all the way through this?
[01:40:08.531 --> 01:40:10.873]  Um, because of course they're not just putting DU in there.
[01:40:10.913 --> 01:40:11.393]  They're lazy.
[01:40:11.433 --> 01:40:12.534]  They put an even higher grade in.
[01:40:13.014 --> 01:40:14.575]  And, uh, they're all dead and dying.
[01:40:14.595 --> 01:40:15.595]  I mean, it's a real deal.
[01:40:15.615 --> 01:40:17.677]  And they use three times as much this time.
[01:40:18.077 --> 01:40:23.040]  Could I give out the phone number for the veterans, to contact the veterans for our constitutional law?
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.581]  It'll help anybody who's sick.
[01:40:25.721 --> 01:40:26.302]  Who is that?
[01:40:26.682 --> 01:40:28.543]  Veterans for Constitutional Law.
[01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:29.924]  Who is that group?
[01:40:30.384 --> 01:40:31.024]  That's who it is.
[01:40:31.145 --> 01:40:31.705]  That's who it is.
[01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:33.106]  It's for veterans.
[01:40:33.146 --> 01:40:34.647]  Tell me about the group.
[01:40:34.887 --> 01:40:36.428]  The group is for veterans.
[01:40:37.185 --> 01:40:40.086]  To help other veterans who have been exposed to depleted uranium.
[01:40:40.746 --> 01:40:41.887]  And who runs this group?
[01:40:42.487 --> 01:40:45.048]  It says right here, Veterans for Constitutional Law.
[01:40:45.528 --> 01:40:48.249]  It's in this week's edition of American Fruit Press.
[01:40:48.329 --> 01:40:50.550]  Oh, I think I've heard that group on the air.
[01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:53.471]  Yeah, I just sometimes want to check it.
[01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.332]  Their phone number, if you're sick, you can call them to help you.
[01:40:56.392 --> 01:40:57.032]  It's Area Code 516-474-4261.
[01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:57.893]  And thank you again, Alex.
[01:40:57.913 --> 01:40:59.593]  Thank you for the call.
[01:41:05.789 --> 01:41:16.235]  Oh boy, here's Revolution, then we'll go to John Tennessee, Ron, and another caller from Connecticut, and then I'll start getting into this bill.
[01:41:16.255 --> 01:41:20.257]  I want to hurry through this bill, but we'll play part of Revolution.
[01:41:20.277 --> 01:41:20.677]  Here it is.
[01:41:20.737 --> 01:41:26.820]  Go ahead and hit it.
[01:41:45.683 --> 01:41:49.526]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:41:51.387 --> 01:41:55.209]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:01.274]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[01:42:02.014 --> 01:42:04.816]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[01:42:07.262 --> 01:42:27.848]  There are men coming down from the valley There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:42:30.349 --> 01:42:34.310]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver
[01:42:39.729 --> 01:42:52.639]  It's been so many years, so many tears we have lost once before, now we'll settle the
[01:43:18.867 --> 01:43:19.648]  We're good to go.
[01:43:56.152 --> 01:43:57.292]  We're good to go.
[01:44:23.803 --> 01:44:44.910]  All right.
[01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:49.211]  That's Chris DeBerg from Ireland.
[01:44:51.641 --> 01:44:54.482]  There are many among us who have not yet seen the light.
[01:44:55.142 --> 01:45:05.567]  We must go to every corner of this land, ladies and gentlemen, to every hill and mountain, and let them know that the time is now at hand to light a fire.
[01:45:09.668 --> 01:45:12.530]  If you won't stand up and fight for freedom, you will be enslaved.
[01:45:12.690 --> 01:45:14.110]  It's cause and effect.
[01:45:14.190 --> 01:45:16.071]  It's the law of nature.
[01:45:16.171 --> 01:45:17.492]  It's the way things work.
[01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:21.511]  I've programmed you to not understand that.
[01:45:23.292 --> 01:45:25.413]  Let's go to John in Tennessee.
[01:45:25.473 --> 01:45:26.194]  John, go ahead.
[01:45:26.214 --> 01:45:26.694]  Hello.
[01:45:27.134 --> 01:45:27.474]  Hello.
[01:45:27.735 --> 01:45:38.361]  I've got a copy of the Catholic Pocket Dictionary, and it's published at 666 5th Avenue, New York City, by Dell Doubleday, which is a Jewish corporation.
[01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:47.186]  It talks all about Satanism and the Black Mass, and maybe that's why the Vatican is going to cut out John Paul's heart and worship it, according to TV news.
[01:45:49.525 --> 01:45:56.028]  They're going to, what, turn his heart into some kind of... What do they call those?
[01:45:56.088 --> 01:45:58.689]  I don't know what they call it, but it's insane.
[01:46:01.391 --> 01:46:02.511]  That's all over the news.
[01:46:04.632 --> 01:46:04.972]  Okay.
[01:46:05.613 --> 01:46:16.498]  And also, I had someone, Frank Miller of Sin City, on History Channel, they did an interview with Miller, and it was a show about comics used for propaganda in wartime.
[01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:29.377]  Miller confessed that on 9-11, 2001, his comics had Batman's aircraft crashing into a New York City skyscraper, causing its collapse, and that killed Superman's wife, Lois Lane.
[01:46:30.758 --> 01:46:38.423]  So, Miller had some kind of prior knowledge, and he's got the same last name as the owner of BFI that was paid $7 billion to demolish the skyscraper.
[01:46:38.443 --> 01:46:41.825]  Well, all I know is, again, I don't recommend anybody
[01:46:43.612 --> 01:46:44.492]  The film is very violent.
[01:46:44.512 --> 01:46:45.352]  Children shouldn't see it.
[01:46:45.753 --> 01:46:52.356]  I'm telling you, the guy does have some kind of inside knowledge because the film is... I saw Sin City, folks.
[01:46:52.396 --> 01:46:53.956]  It's totally anti-New World Order.
[01:46:54.297 --> 01:46:57.238]  But very, very violent and yeah, it's something else.
[01:46:57.518 --> 01:46:59.359]  Well, William Miller owns BFI.
[01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:00.840]  You know, I'd heard that.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.001]  Yeah, so he had a comic book right before 9-11 where the same thing happens.
[01:47:04.241 --> 01:47:09.404]  I guess everybody was... We've got the guy who does Clear and Present Danger.
[01:47:10.262 --> 01:47:13.164]  Now, we've got just all these big authors writing about it.
[01:47:13.204 --> 01:47:15.445]  We had X-Files TV shows about it.
[01:47:15.785 --> 01:47:17.006]  But the government didn't know about it.
[01:47:17.686 --> 01:47:21.548]  Well, he was teamed up with controlled demolitions, the BFI people.
[01:47:22.069 --> 01:47:24.450]  And Marilyn Monroe... Well, Miller's a very common name.
[01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:25.771]  You can't make that tenuous.
[01:47:25.791 --> 01:47:26.551]  It's a Jewish name.
[01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:30.814]  It's a good Jewish name, like Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe's wife, who got her into Kabbalah.
[01:47:31.694 --> 01:47:36.377]  So it's a Jewish name, and the Marvel Comics is owned by a Jew named Arie
[01:47:37.168 --> 01:47:39.369]  Heller, or Erie Geller, or something like that.
[01:47:39.489 --> 01:47:40.849]  He was on History Channel, too.
[01:47:41.469 --> 01:47:44.570]  Clearly a Jewish corporation.
[01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:49.211]  I didn't know that, regardless, I didn't know that Miller was always a Jewish name.
[01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:52.232]  I thought it meant somebody in their background was a Miller.
[01:47:52.572 --> 01:47:54.993]  It's not always, but it is apparently.
[01:47:55.233 --> 01:47:56.893]  Milling Grain.
[01:47:57.333 --> 01:47:59.114]  Well, the BFI people are Jewish.
[01:47:59.814 --> 01:48:04.575]  And they live here in Knoxville, Tennessee, the world headquarters right here.
[01:48:05.256 --> 01:48:05.937]  William Miller.
[01:48:06.057 --> 01:48:08.778]  So, we had a big transaction against him.
[01:48:08.959 --> 01:48:10.119]  John, I appreciate your call.
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:15.883]  I mean, from one call to the next, it's the Catholics, it's the Jews, it's evil people, folks.
[01:48:17.084 --> 01:48:21.067]  And, uh, maybe I'll try to get Miller on this show.
[01:48:22.368 --> 01:48:23.889]  Uh, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:26.991]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:27.751]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:48:28.132 --> 01:48:32.335]  Alex, George Norrie had, uh, Catherine Austin, former
[01:48:34.184 --> 01:48:42.931]  Assistant Secretary of HUD on last night talking about the $4 trillion that has gone missing from the Treasury, looted out of our government.
[01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:45.293]  I got Cynthia McKinney talking about over $3 trillion.
[01:48:45.333 --> 01:48:46.414]  I thought it was $2.4.
[01:48:47.054 --> 01:48:48.335]  That's from the Pentagon.
[01:48:48.736 --> 01:48:48.976]  Right.
[01:48:48.996 --> 01:48:50.957]  She said over $4 trillion total.
[01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:54.320]  Alex, I heard that clip from Cynthia McKinney.
[01:48:55.001 --> 01:48:59.044]  They use the same tactics, according to her, any government agency does.
[01:49:00.922 --> 01:49:04.605]  Alex, I could just as easily have been listening to you last night.
[01:49:04.625 --> 01:49:06.706]  This woman is really sharp.
[01:49:06.746 --> 01:49:07.466]  Yeah, we've had her on.
[01:49:08.527 --> 01:49:09.588]  You need to have her back.
[01:49:09.648 --> 01:49:10.989]  She is truly amazing.
[01:49:11.029 --> 01:49:19.774]  She validates everything you've said so far about high-level corruption in the government, the looting of the treasury, basically 9-11.
[01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.756]  There's not a whole lot of difference in you guys.
[01:49:23.496 --> 01:49:28.179]  Also, Alex, of course, I'm a raised in the Baptist church, not a Catholic, but
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:42.086]  I suspect a lot of what we see in the Catholic Church, this ritualism, is simply to keep people involved, whether it's exorcism or whatever, kind of a mysticism there, rather than out and out evil.
[01:49:44.027 --> 01:49:46.968]  Like I say, I'm just an observer from the side.
[01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:48.969]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:49.770]  No.
[01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.490]  No.
[01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.791]  Alright, good points.
[01:49:51.831 --> 01:49:52.391]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:53.777 --> 01:49:55.297]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.478 --> 01:49:58.579]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.719 --> 01:50:02.600]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:06.881]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:11.022]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.102 --> 01:50:12.943]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.543 --> 01:50:16.444]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.484 --> 01:50:21.205]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.365 --> 01:50:24.406]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.586 --> 01:50:27.447]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.947 --> 01:50:34.049]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:38.372]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:51:18.652 --> 01:51:25.177]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.

[01:53:12.943 --> 01:53:24.929]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:27.971]  Of course, Murphy's Law.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:36.243]  I was sitting here during the break, big huge stack of papers slid off the desk and hit the ground.
[01:53:36.263 --> 01:53:47.268]  And I had this bill, HB 2893, to put the transponders in all the cars and track and trace you.
[01:53:47.288 --> 01:53:52.610]  I had all the subsections listed and now they're all scrambled.
[01:53:54.491 --> 01:53:55.932]  I'm gonna find it here in a second.
[01:53:57.059 --> 01:53:58.881]  Let's go to a call while I try to find this.
[01:53:58.921 --> 01:54:00.802]  I wanted to jam this in before the hour ended.
[01:54:03.143 --> 01:54:07.846]  I guess up next here would be Rarsh in Connecticut.
[01:54:07.886 --> 01:54:08.587]  Go ahead, Rarsh.
[01:54:08.887 --> 01:54:09.187]  Okay.
[01:54:09.527 --> 01:54:22.416]  I gotta ask you, when did these so-called libertarians forget that chances for privatism belong first to individuals and small businesses?
[01:54:23.076 --> 01:54:23.476]  There's
[01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:30.500]  I believe at least one individual in Maine, and I was in Maine about seven years ago.
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:38.421]  I mean, apparently he owns one of the main highways and he takes care of it.
[01:54:38.441 --> 01:54:42.862]  I've never seen a highway taken care of so well.
[01:54:43.322 --> 01:54:51.444]  This thing with the toll roads and giving it to huge companies, it's going to be like that thing from falling down.
[01:54:53.089 --> 01:54:55.871]  Yeah, when he destroys the bridge.
[01:54:55.891 --> 01:54:58.753]  I mean, they're not there to do real work.
[01:54:58.793 --> 01:55:03.617]  They're just there to keep siphoning our earnings.
[01:55:05.278 --> 01:55:08.240]  Well, these are existing roads we've paid for.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:08.920]  Exactly.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:12.943]  It's free market to build a new road and say it'll be a toll road for ten years.
[01:55:13.684 --> 01:55:14.304]  That's fine.
[01:55:14.324 --> 01:55:15.165]  You don't have to use it.
[01:55:15.425 --> 01:55:19.148]  Taking the existing roads and making them toll roads and then
[01:55:20.299 --> 01:55:25.283]  Radically increasing the prices and then giving it to private companies that paid off the government.
[01:55:25.323 --> 01:55:26.264]  That's not free market.
[01:55:26.304 --> 01:55:27.245]  That's organized crime.
[01:55:27.625 --> 01:55:28.326]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:28.806 --> 01:55:29.366]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:29.386 --> 01:55:30.647]  In fact, I found it.
[01:55:31.848 --> 01:55:35.131]  I'm going to read more of this in the next hour, but HB 2893.
[01:55:37.273 --> 01:55:41.136]  And this is related to Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Compliance Program.
[01:55:42.498 --> 01:55:55.486]  Providing civil and criminal penalties being enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, Section 1, Chapter 601, Transportation Code, is amended by adding sub-chapter N to read as follows.
[01:55:56.927 --> 01:56:02.250]  And this was introduced by State Legislature minion, Mr. Phillips.
[01:56:03.831 --> 01:56:04.551]  So, State Rep.
[01:56:04.611 --> 01:56:05.012]  Phillips.
[01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:08.014]  And it looks like this bill may pass.
[01:56:08.054 --> 01:56:10.295]  And it goes on for six pages, small print.
[01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:25.955]  But deep in here, in subsection 601.503, subsection, it's hard to read these folks, I've been trying to mark these up so it'll be easier.
[01:56:26.776 --> 01:56:32.140]  This is actually in subsection, subsection 601.506, in subsection 601.506, and it says,
[01:56:41.349 --> 01:56:57.713]  Standards for the state established by the Texas Department of Transportation and other entities for use of the system of toll roads and toll facilities in the state through the electronic reading systems on state highways to be administered through the transponders.
[01:56:59.954 --> 01:57:02.055]  So, there it is!
[01:57:03.915 --> 01:57:08.096]  And when you get your tags, they'll just put these on your car.
[01:57:08.116 --> 01:57:09.297]  That's what they say in this bill.
[01:57:09.317 --> 01:57:10.437]  I want to read more of it later.
[01:57:11.471 --> 01:57:14.912]  We'll start the third hour and get into this and a lot more.
[01:57:16.453 --> 01:57:20.054]  Also, they're going to have forced databases to make sure you've taken your vaccines.
[01:57:21.195 --> 01:57:28.997]  They're moving to try to make that the law at the state and federal levels, so we'll cover that as well when we start the third hour.
[01:57:29.037 --> 01:57:33.179]  Didn't really plug my videos this hour, but Martial Law, my new film, is out on DVD.
[01:57:33.819 --> 01:57:34.359]  Hope you'll get it.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:36.320]  The long wait is over.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.621]  Alright, third hour, 70 seconds away.
[01:57:38.661 --> 01:57:39.061]  Stay with us.
[01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:49.855]  Hello!
[01:57:50.095 --> 01:57:50.755]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.416 --> 01:57:52.496]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.177 --> 01:57:54.318]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.938 --> 01:57:55.779]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.539 --> 01:57:58.440]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:02.063]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.263 --> 01:58:06.365]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.708 --> 01:58:21.730]  We're already into hour number three.
[01:58:22.090 --> 01:58:24.051]  We have wide open telephones today.
[01:58:24.151 --> 01:58:32.295]  Any news item, any topic, any issue you want to discuss, no holds barred, you're welcome to join us here live on air.
[01:58:33.615 --> 01:58:38.437]  The toll free number to get involved is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:39.538 --> 01:58:44.100]  Predominantly in the last two hours I've been talking about national toll roads going in at the state level.
[01:58:45.797 --> 01:58:53.079]  When you get your sticker every year that you pay your tax, there will be a transponder in it that reads it and taxes you as you drive down the road.
[01:58:53.919 --> 01:59:03.281]  Also, the insurance companies will report into a database that's affixed to that transponder number, and the minute your insurance runs out, the police are going to pull you over and take you to jail.
[01:59:05.082 --> 01:59:10.463]  One more little wrinkle in what the globalists are putting in this control grid.
[01:59:10.983 --> 01:59:13.084]  But right now, let's go back to the calls
[01:59:13.979 --> 01:59:16.040]  Let's talk to another John in Tennessee.
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:17.641]  John, you're on the air.
[01:59:17.881 --> 01:59:18.361]  Go ahead.
[01:59:18.381 --> 01:59:21.162]  Hey Alex, I think I probably need to start calling over my middle name.
[01:59:21.182 --> 01:59:23.103]  There's going to be a lot of Johns from Tennessee today.
[01:59:23.203 --> 01:59:24.784]  There are a lot of Johns out there, yeah.
[01:59:25.744 --> 01:59:31.327]  I was wondering if you were aware of Malachi Martin, the author of the book, The Keys of This Blood?
[01:59:32.087 --> 01:59:33.167]  I have heard a lot about him.
[01:59:33.187 --> 01:59:35.809]  I think you should get that book and read it.
[01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:42.031]  The subtitle for this book is Pope John Paul II vs. Russia and the West for Control of the New World Order.
[01:59:42.652 --> 01:59:43.392]  This book was written
[01:59:44.472 --> 01:59:50.657]  About a decade or so ago, and Malachi Martin, as you may be aware, is a former Jesuit.
[01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:56.282]  When he quit the Jesuit order, he didn't quit being a priest, though, and he was a Vatican scholar.
[01:59:56.302 --> 01:59:57.763]  I'm not sure if he's still alive or not.
[01:59:58.403 --> 02:00:08.732]  But it goes into a lot of the detail about the fall of the Eastern Bloc, and basically the struggle for control of the New World Order.
[02:00:08.952 --> 02:00:13.756]  And they're not hiding it, that the papacy is trying to control stuff.
[02:00:14.866 --> 02:00:21.279]  Um, and I agree with you that there's definitely a lot of evil and a lot of different religions.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.584]  I totally agree with you about Pat Robertson.
[02:00:24.201 --> 02:00:25.622]  I thank you for putting that information out.
[02:00:25.642 --> 02:00:30.224]  I wasn't aware about his stance on forced abortion until I heard that on your radio station.
[02:00:30.264 --> 02:00:32.485]  Well, CNN asked him about four years ago.
[02:00:32.525 --> 02:00:37.287]  They said, what about China with their Planned Parenthood, with abortions and all of this?
[02:00:37.307 --> 02:00:40.388]  And he said, well, they're doing what they have to do and it should be more aggressive.
[02:00:40.788 --> 02:00:41.128]  Right.
[02:00:41.609 --> 02:00:46.951]  And then his clarification on the CBN website said, well, yeah, China's got a problem.
[02:00:46.991 --> 02:00:47.891]  They've got to do something.
[02:00:48.212 --> 02:00:48.412]  Yeah.
[02:00:48.872 --> 02:00:50.413]  But what separates
[02:00:51.673 --> 02:01:01.598]  The Catholic Church, and someone like Pat Robertson, is not what they do so much as the power that they wield.
[02:01:02.138 --> 02:01:04.980]  We're looking at a church that's actually a nation.
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:06.560]  They have ambassadors.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.041]  Yeah, it is.
[02:01:07.061 --> 02:01:08.901]  Vatican City, 2,000 years old, yeah.
[02:01:09.222 --> 02:01:18.046]  Right, and we can see from just this funeral the enormous influence we have head-to-state
[02:01:19.033 --> 02:01:42.998]  No, I know, it's just when we bring up a topic like this, then it just dominates everything, and then we'll have the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Seventh-day Adventists and the, and the, every other group calling in saying, we're the way, we're the way, and it just turns into a big Balkanized fight, whereas I'm just a follower of Christ, and that's the end of it for me, and
[02:01:44.528 --> 02:01:47.649]  You know, certainly, but people are welcome to talk about this.
[02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:55.713]  I totally agree with you on that we shouldn't squabble over the religious differences.
[02:01:55.773 --> 02:02:00.935]  When Pope John Paul II comes out and calls for a new world order, or calls for this global religion, I expose it.
[02:02:01.436 --> 02:02:01.716]  Right.
[02:02:02.436 --> 02:02:08.359]  I'm just, I mean, so, but I'm just not going to try to alienate all the Catholic listeners who I have found
[02:02:09.349 --> 02:02:12.430]  You really are more active than most people and out there doing a lot of good stuff.
[02:02:12.630 --> 02:02:13.290]  Oh, I agree.
[02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:18.371]  I think that there are a ton of really good Catholic people.
[02:02:18.391 --> 02:02:26.933]  I look at what happened down in Central America with Negroponte ignoring the murder of the nuns that were trying to stand up for rights.
[02:02:27.333 --> 02:02:34.294]  I'm just saying that in this one particular instance, this one institution is just in a position to do a lot that other people are not in a position to do.
[02:02:34.981 --> 02:02:36.162]  Alrighty, thanks for the call.
[02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:38.443]  We'll come back and take more calls on the other side.
[02:02:38.463 --> 02:02:40.243]  See if you want to talk about toll roads.
[02:02:40.264 --> 02:02:41.344]  We can talk about the pulp though.
[02:02:41.944 --> 02:02:42.885]  Mainstream media is.
[02:02:45.606 --> 02:02:49.968]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.148 --> 02:02:54.570]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:59.112]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.132 --> 02:03:00.453]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.253 --> 02:03:02.213]  Panama!
[02:03:02.253 --> 02:03:06.474]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.534 --> 02:03:13.476]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.596 --> 02:03:15.676]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.956 --> 02:03:26.378]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.598 --> 02:03:30.199]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[02:03:30.759 --> 02:03:30.799]  888-253-3139
[02:03:45.271 --> 02:03:55.999]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:56.179 --> 02:04:03.764]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.025 --> 02:04:07.147]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.407 --> 02:04:13.170]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:13.450 --> 02:04:19.593]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:04:19.953 --> 02:04:23.855]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:04:23.895 --> 02:04:25.776]  The water level is always visible.
[02:04:25.976 --> 02:04:31.939]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:32.159 --> 02:04:36.100]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:36.701]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:46.016 --> 02:04:51.558]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:51.678 --> 02:04:52.739]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:52.859 --> 02:04:53.739]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:53.839 --> 02:04:56.680]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:01.742]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:02.003 --> 02:05:03.083]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:03.243 --> 02:05:06.164]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:06.504 --> 02:05:10.206]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:05:10.386 --> 02:05:12.867]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:05:13.127 --> 02:05:17.989]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:21.330]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[02:05:21.471 --> 02:05:26.873]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:05:26.973 --> 02:05:27.733]  Trinobio.
[02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:28.834]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:05:29.994 --> 02:05:32.895]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:05:33.075 --> 02:05:35.956]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[02:05:36.136 --> 02:05:38.597]  Check out their website at no-b-o.com.
[02:05:38.777 --> 02:05:42.058]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O.
[02:05:42.258 --> 02:05:43.019]  That's no-b-o.com.
[02:05:46.815 --> 02:05:52.839]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.439 --> 02:05:56.481]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.882 --> 02:06:02.325]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:03.125 --> 02:06:09.029]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central, going out on the AM and FM dial.
[02:06:09.049 --> 02:06:12.431]  A lot of new great affiliates out there, we're definitely growing, praise God.
[02:06:13.223 --> 02:06:18.626]  Ensemble casting on global shortwave during the day at 9.985 and at night at 3210.
[02:06:19.286 --> 02:06:23.188]  And of course at Infowars.com.
[02:06:23.288 --> 02:06:36.235]  I'm going to go to, here in just a few minutes, to Larry and to Brock and Tim and John and Mark and everybody else that's patiently holding and then I'll get into some of the other news.
[02:06:36.315 --> 02:06:39.857]  But, you know, I notice things societally.
[02:06:41.903 --> 02:06:47.766]  And I've really intuitively studied how people respond to information, how people see the world.
[02:06:49.327 --> 02:06:51.148]  How things can be hidden in plain view.
[02:06:53.569 --> 02:06:57.251]  The power of getting people to play along with the big lie.
[02:06:58.651 --> 02:07:00.272]  Because they feel like they're part of the system.
[02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:03.534]  What people know is a lie, but they still go along with it.
[02:07:05.995 --> 02:07:09.897]  And then I look at the minds of young people that are new and
[02:07:11.630 --> 02:07:18.071]  Crackling with intelligence and creativity and exploration.
[02:07:19.831 --> 02:07:21.532]  And I look at children's movies.
[02:07:23.032 --> 02:07:26.353]  Predominantly films that target children.
[02:07:28.293 --> 02:07:30.653]  And I look at how adults interpret those films.
[02:07:30.693 --> 02:07:31.773]  I'll actually ask people.
[02:07:31.813 --> 02:07:33.794]  Because I don't watch a lot of TV.
[02:07:33.934 --> 02:07:37.594]  Maybe 30 to 45 minutes of news a week.
[02:07:38.415 --> 02:07:40.515]  The last few weeks I haven't been working as much.
[02:07:41.485 --> 02:07:42.826]  Twelve hours a day on average.
[02:07:42.866 --> 02:07:44.066]  About ten hours a day on average.
[02:07:44.647 --> 02:07:48.048]  So I've been working eighteen, sixteen to eighteen hours a day the last four or five months.
[02:07:48.068 --> 02:07:51.690]  So I kind of cut back a little bit just to rest.
[02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:52.510]  I was exhausted.
[02:07:54.011 --> 02:07:57.213]  So it feels like a vacation just working ten to twelve hours a day.
[02:07:59.174 --> 02:08:00.835]  But why am I getting into this?
[02:08:00.855 --> 02:08:01.335]  It doesn't matter.
[02:08:01.655 --> 02:08:05.417]  The point is that I do watch movies.
[02:08:06.197 --> 02:08:07.698]  I go see a movie every couple weeks.
[02:08:09.409 --> 02:08:13.890]  And I go see movies I don't agree with, you know, to go see what the popular culture is pushing.
[02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:16.471]  To kind of give you reviews occasionally.
[02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:22.572]  And when I go into a movie, I don't suspend my disbelief.
[02:08:22.592 --> 02:08:32.735]  You know, they'll tell you most adults suspend their disbelief and they actually put electrodes on people's heads, especially on the big screen,
[02:08:33.781 --> 02:08:37.082]  It happens with TV too, even to a greater extent in some cases.
[02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:41.244]  Literally, the brain is accepting the information as if it's real.
[02:08:42.724 --> 02:08:43.725]  But I digress.
[02:08:45.705 --> 02:09:00.451]  I've seen plots, predominantly in children's films, where the government is carrying out terror attacks, or other groups are carrying out terror attacks, to blame it on their enemies, and to then pose as the saviors.
[02:09:02.853 --> 02:09:12.617]  The Incredibles, which is a pretty family-friendly film compared to most I've seen out there, which I just thought was great.
[02:09:14.158 --> 02:09:14.818]  The Incredibles.
[02:09:15.939 --> 02:09:17.379]  And it's animated.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:23.622]  And I'll just give the film away, because it's more important to talk about this.
[02:09:24.462 --> 02:09:28.284]  There's a terrorist, basically, who sells weapons to the government.
[02:09:29.346 --> 02:09:49.466]  And he's jealous of the superheroes so he's been hunting them down and killing them so he can launch a fake attack on New York City with a giant robot that he really controls and he can show up on the scene and defeat the robot and save New York and then basically be their leader.
[02:09:51.688 --> 02:09:52.949]  And I've talked to young people
[02:09:54.093 --> 02:09:59.175]  I'll be in a grocery store line and I'll see them people with that in the cart, the DVD in the cart.
[02:09:59.195 --> 02:10:05.078]  This was like a week ago and I said to the family, it was like a 12 year old boy and an 8 year old girl and their mother, and I said, oh the Incredibles, you see that?
[02:10:06.039 --> 02:10:08.680]  And they go, yeah, yeah, it's a really good movie.
[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:11.801]  And I said, I asked the young man, I said, well what did you get from the film?
[02:10:12.062 --> 02:10:12.702]  What was it about?
[02:10:13.182 --> 02:10:19.285]  Well the bad guy, he attacks the city because he wants to be a superhero and be light.
[02:10:21.374 --> 02:10:24.115]  And then I talk to adults about the film, and this is what I do.
[02:10:25.255 --> 02:10:26.176]  I'm a weirdo, folks.
[02:10:26.356 --> 02:10:27.396]  This is how I study things.
[02:10:28.897 --> 02:10:31.858]  I talk to adults, and they go, yeah, I really like the movie, but I didn't get it.
[02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:33.919]  I didn't understand it.
[02:10:39.321 --> 02:10:45.263]  And it's the same thing with Final Fantasy, which is a very New Age occult-y film, but it's done well.
[02:10:45.763 --> 02:10:50.505]  And there's this evil top general who actually opens up the gates of the city
[02:10:51.204 --> 02:10:58.566]  To let this enemy force in, so he can then blame his political enemies that they didn't do enough and get control.
[02:10:59.787 --> 02:11:01.187]  And I've talked to children about that.
[02:11:01.287 --> 02:11:02.387]  Young people, they get it.
[02:11:02.888 --> 02:11:06.689]  I've talked to adults, they go, these are people that have $100,000 a year jobs.
[02:11:06.949 --> 02:11:08.589]  They go, yeah, I saw Final Fantasy.
[02:11:08.949 --> 02:11:09.830]  I didn't get the plot.
[02:11:09.850 --> 02:11:10.830]  Because I'll say, what was the plot?
[02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:11.710]  And they'll go, I don't know.
[02:11:13.171 --> 02:11:15.791]  Well, did you pick up on that?
[02:11:15.851 --> 02:11:17.752]  And they'll go, no, I didn't understand why he did that.
[02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.642]  You know, why did he open the gates to let the aliens in to attack?
[02:11:22.843 --> 02:11:23.663]  That didn't make sense.
[02:11:23.683 --> 02:11:24.304]  Well, of course it did!
[02:11:24.324 --> 02:11:25.824]  He wanted to blame the council!
[02:11:27.945 --> 02:11:29.746]  And I was the first person to talk about this.
[02:11:29.766 --> 02:11:33.688]  I think it was the... Yeah, it was Washington Post wrote a story about it.
[02:11:34.308 --> 02:11:35.268]  Same thing with Lord of the Rings.
[02:11:35.308 --> 02:11:35.809]  I talked about it.
[02:11:35.829 --> 02:11:36.969]  I'm not saying they're listening to me.
[02:11:37.389 --> 02:11:40.991]  It's just that... It's common sense.
[02:11:42.431 --> 02:11:43.192]  In Lord of the Rings...
[02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:51.562]  USA Today compared the all-seeing, burning eye to the Total Information Awareness Network symbol and how it's all-seeing, total information awareness.
[02:11:52.563 --> 02:11:54.104]  And then USA Today wrote an article about it.
[02:11:55.145 --> 02:12:00.770]  It was the same thing with, um, with Attack of the Clones, Part 2 of the Star Wars trilogy.
[02:12:02.151 --> 02:12:02.751]  The prequels.
[02:12:03.712 --> 02:12:05.734]  What's your new age and occulty and all that stuff.
[02:12:05.754 --> 02:12:10.618]  But the point is, is that I've seen the deleted scenes from the first Star Wars film, Episode 4,
[02:12:11.866 --> 02:12:17.708]  Where it's the global empire and a galactic slave state and the taxation and all this.
[02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:21.729]  It really has that message in it.
[02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:26.050]  Well, in Attack of the Clones, I've talked to adults.
[02:12:26.110 --> 02:12:30.612]  I was talking to a really smart editor the other day and he said, I didn't get the plot.
[02:12:31.492 --> 02:12:33.993]  I said, I didn't get the plot, but I know children that did.
[02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:40.795]  But the Washington Post did write an article about it, and so did others, going, well,
[02:12:41.676 --> 02:12:42.956]  People don't get this plot.
[02:12:42.996 --> 02:12:43.576]  It's simple.
[02:12:44.297 --> 02:12:50.838]  Count Dooku, who is this separatist leader, he really works.
[02:12:51.758 --> 02:12:57.039]  I talk about films because people societally interface and interact through films more than any other medium.
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:00.160]  Count Dooku really works for the Emperor.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.921]  Who was really a secret Emperor of a shadow government.
[02:13:04.381 --> 02:13:06.882]  He's Senator.
[02:13:07.382 --> 02:13:08.202]  He's the Chancellor.
[02:13:09.654 --> 02:13:13.855]  And when he was just a Senator he created a crisis that he then managed to become Chancellor.
[02:13:14.236 --> 02:13:18.977]  Then he creates a new crisis to become basically Emperor.
[02:13:20.998 --> 02:13:32.582]  And Count Dooku goes and starts blowing up planets and causing wars and doing all this and he gets defeated at the end by the Chancellor with his big army.
[02:13:33.394 --> 02:13:40.817]  Of stormtroopers, and they praise the stormtroopers, and everybody's hailing the starships as they take off at the end of the film.
[02:13:41.437 --> 02:13:46.099]  And then Count Dooku flies and lands and meets with the Emperor, and he goes, Good news, my lord!
[02:13:46.119 --> 02:13:47.599]  The war has begun!
[02:13:51.341 --> 02:13:54.962]  And, I mean, I talk to children, they understand.
[02:13:54.982 --> 02:14:00.784]  They go, Count Dooku works for the Emperor, and they're creating a war so he can take over!
[02:14:01.423 --> 02:14:04.745]  No, I talk to adults who've got 150 IQs.
[02:14:04.985 --> 02:14:06.665]  It's like there's a mental block, folks.
[02:14:07.026 --> 02:14:08.106]  They can't even see it.
[02:14:08.166 --> 02:14:10.607]  They can't even get the plots of children's movies.
[02:14:11.208 --> 02:14:12.528]  How are they going to get 9-11?
[02:14:13.769 --> 02:14:15.310]  I go, Hitler blew up his own Reichstag.
[02:14:15.730 --> 02:14:16.950]  It's in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.410]  They admit it.
[02:14:17.811 --> 02:14:18.771]  We have the Nazi documents.
[02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:20.552]  They go, well, why would he want to blow up his own building?
[02:14:20.592 --> 02:14:21.272]  It was his building.
[02:14:21.632 --> 02:14:23.793]  Because he wanted to blame it on enemies and take control.
[02:14:23.813 --> 02:14:24.774]  Huh?
[02:14:25.962 --> 02:14:26.422]  Huh?
[02:14:26.683 --> 02:14:27.944]  Well, Operation Northwood, U.S.
[02:14:27.964 --> 02:14:32.046]  Government plan to attack and hijack jets and crash them and bomb D.C.
[02:14:32.607 --> 02:14:33.127]  Real stuff.
[02:14:33.387 --> 02:14:34.628]  Well, why would they do that?
[02:14:34.728 --> 02:14:35.149]  Why?
[02:14:35.249 --> 02:14:35.669]  Why?
[02:14:36.009 --> 02:14:38.591]  I just don't because then that gives them the excuse to take over.
[02:14:43.995 --> 02:14:47.798]  And the similarities, you know, in that film, and this was again picked up by others,
[02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:56.664]  Where you've got this terrorist, Count Dooku, on this desert planet, who's carrying out terror attacks, and he really works for the Chancellor, who wants total martial law.
[02:14:57.805 --> 02:15:00.326]  It's the same thing with Bin Laden in the real world, folks.
[02:15:01.106 --> 02:15:02.326]  And people can't get this.
[02:15:02.786 --> 02:15:04.107]  But let's go ahead and play this.
[02:15:04.147 --> 02:15:08.689]  This is the trailer for Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.
[02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:13.751]  On May 19th, the dark side will be unleashed.
[02:15:13.851 --> 02:15:17.132]  That's the text that goes along with the trailer.
[02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:21.552]  And, uh, I'd say the Dark Side has already been released here in the real world.
[02:15:21.852 --> 02:15:22.813]  But, uh, here it is!
[02:15:30.597 --> 02:15:42.584]  The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
[02:15:43.224 --> 02:15:45.165]  Is it possible to learn this power?
[02:15:46.554 --> 02:15:48.115]  Not from a Jedi.
[02:15:49.176 --> 02:15:52.758]  The council wants you to report on all the Chancellor's dealings.
[02:15:53.018 --> 02:15:53.779]  That's treason.
[02:15:54.119 --> 02:15:55.159]  We are at war, Anakin.
[02:15:58.641 --> 02:16:00.803]  Very dangerous putting them together.
[02:16:00.823 --> 02:16:02.504]  I don't think the boy can handle them.
[02:16:02.884 --> 02:16:03.484]  I don't trust him.
[02:16:06.335 --> 02:16:07.516]  I need your help, sir.
[02:16:07.796 --> 02:16:11.479]  I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
[02:16:11.559 --> 02:16:14.741]  You're on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
[02:16:14.801 --> 02:16:15.242]  What?
[02:16:15.602 --> 02:16:17.383]  Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
[02:16:19.725 --> 02:16:26.010]  Learn to know the Dark Side Force and you will achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
[02:16:29.192 --> 02:16:30.773]  You're under arrest, Chancellor.
[02:16:30.994 --> 02:16:32.815]  Are you frightening me, Master Jedi?
[02:16:48.261 --> 02:16:53.343]  Every single Jedi is now an enemy of the Republic.
[02:16:54.643 --> 02:16:57.864]  Do what must be done.
[02:16:58.764 --> 02:17:01.545]  Do not hesitate.
[02:17:02.365 --> 02:17:03.606]  Show no mercy.
[02:17:04.886 --> 02:17:08.467]  Who could have done this?
[02:17:08.507 --> 02:17:10.928]  Wisdom on the dark side.
[02:17:10.948 --> 02:17:13.589]  Young Skywalker has become.
[02:17:13.689 --> 02:17:14.989]  I feel so helpless.
[02:17:23.510 --> 02:17:38.046]  You were the chosen one!
[02:17:38.106 --> 02:17:43.211]  Children understand it, but adults don't.
[02:17:43.632 --> 02:17:44.493]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.164 --> 02:17:47.626]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:52.531]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.851 --> 02:17:55.194]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.434 --> 02:17:56.955]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.336 --> 02:18:02.421]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[02:18:47.156 --> 02:18:48.177]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:18:48.517 --> 02:18:51.299]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.723]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.163 --> 02:18:56.984]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.304 --> 02:19:01.868]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.348 --> 02:19:04.490]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:19:45.658 --> 02:19:48.162]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.863 --> 02:19:58.437]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:19:59.494 --> 02:20:09.041]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:20:10.062 --> 02:20:15.565]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:20:45.728 --> 02:20:48.889]  I was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:50.330]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:20:50.370 --> 02:20:55.352]  I was having a hard time breathing and I had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:20:55.452 --> 02:20:58.974]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:20:59.034 --> 02:21:01.015]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:21:01.035 --> 02:21:01.515]  Cardivite.
[02:21:01.555 --> 02:21:02.055]  Cardivite.
[02:21:02.115 --> 02:21:03.656]  We all use Cardivite!
[02:21:04.526 --> 02:21:07.988]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[02:21:34.386 --> 02:21:36.507]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:36.768 --> 02:21:38.649]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:21:38.689 --> 02:21:49.976]  But I use the examples of popular culture to illustrate that
[02:22:03.308 --> 02:22:12.774]  Children's movies, predominantly for children, you know, have this theme of government-sponsored terror to get control throughout them.
[02:22:13.835 --> 02:22:16.876]  But then I talk to young people, they get the plots, adults don't.
[02:22:16.916 --> 02:22:20.078]  There is a mental block out there.
[02:22:20.699 --> 02:22:30.605]  We have official government plans like Gladio that they carried out for a decade from 69 to 79 in Europe, blowing up school buses, one of their favorite tactics to blame it on their political enemies.
[02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:33.890]  You blow something up and blame it on somebody.
[02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:35.011]  It's real simple, folks.
[02:22:35.071 --> 02:22:35.852]  Call the frame up.
[02:22:37.653 --> 02:22:40.254]  Then the people come clamoring to you to save them.
[02:22:41.815 --> 02:22:50.801]  And adults better wake up to this and get the understanding that, you know, go out of the mouths of babes, as the good book says.
[02:22:52.863 --> 02:22:56.145]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:22:56.165 --> 02:22:58.066]  Who should I go to next?
[02:22:59.267 --> 02:23:01.028]  Larry in Arizona, then Brock, Tim.
[02:23:02.202 --> 02:23:04.124]  John, Tom, Mark, others.
[02:23:04.384 --> 02:23:05.364]  Go ahead, Larry.
[02:23:05.384 --> 02:23:08.126]  Hey Alex, thank you for letting me on your show.
[02:23:08.647 --> 02:23:13.110]  I talked to the Tombstone Tumbleweed newspaper this morning.
[02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:15.772]  Yeah, Chris Simcox, heading up the Minuteman Project.
[02:23:15.792 --> 02:23:18.774]  Well, the employee I talked to was named Gray, G-R-A-Y.
[02:23:19.555 --> 02:23:22.497]  And here's some information he asked me to give to you and your listeners.
[02:23:23.217 --> 02:23:25.179]  I've got a few points, I'll just make it real fast.
[02:23:25.796 --> 02:23:34.519]  There's been a 96% decrease in the illegal aliens coming across that section of the border where the Minuteman Project is taking place.
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:40.482]  The illegal aliens are backing up on the Mexican side of the border at the rate of 3,000 per day.
[02:23:41.742 --> 02:23:48.825]  The Mexican Army has brought in about 10,000 troops to give water to the illegal aliens, I guess, so they can cross at night.
[02:23:50.382 --> 02:23:54.723]  That's incredible, because Chris Simcox has always been very accurate in giving us good info.
[02:23:55.723 --> 02:23:56.823]  I've got to get him on.
[02:23:56.843 --> 02:24:01.224]  Yes, and I'll give out the phone number if you want to in a few minutes, a few seconds here.
[02:24:01.404 --> 02:24:04.265]  Well, that won't help him to give out a phone number for a bunch of folks to call him.
[02:24:05.045 --> 02:24:07.285]  What I'll do is, I don't have the number on me.
[02:24:07.325 --> 02:24:08.346]  Give it to me during the break.
[02:24:08.386 --> 02:24:12.126]  I'll call and try to get one of their people on for five minutes to give us this report.
[02:24:12.386 --> 02:24:13.427]  Okay, yes, I agree.
[02:24:14.127 --> 02:24:15.967]  Let me make a few more comments.
[02:24:17.047 --> 02:24:19.928]  There's a huge army fort right near Naco.
[02:24:20.703 --> 02:24:21.723]  I've called Fort Huachuca.
[02:24:21.963 --> 02:24:22.204]  Yes.
[02:24:22.504 --> 02:24:23.964]  And it's a fabulous fort.
[02:24:24.024 --> 02:24:25.745]  If you ever visit it, you'll just fall in love with it.
[02:24:26.145 --> 02:24:32.727]  But anyway, the commander is the previous commander of Ebro, you know, a prison over there in Iraq.
[02:24:32.887 --> 02:24:33.528]  Abu Ghraib.
[02:24:33.768 --> 02:24:40.410]  Yeah, and she has ordered her troops at Fort Huachuca not to get involved and don't help the Tombstone Minutemen.
[02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:43.171]  Well, Bush has been attacking the Minutemen.
[02:24:43.571 --> 02:24:45.172]  How dare them go call the police?
[02:24:45.252 --> 02:24:48.093]  All they do is sit there with a telephone and call the police.
[02:24:48.809 --> 02:24:52.551]  We're supposed to all tattle on our neighbors for no reason, but don't go protect the border!
[02:24:52.991 --> 02:25:06.259]  Now the residents that are living in that area are asking the question, now what happens when the Minutemen go away, you know, because they fear retribution from the border crossers and the illegal aliens and the terrorists.
[02:25:06.979 --> 02:25:13.023]  And so, you know, we would like to ask your listeners if they would like to come over and participate in the Minutemen
[02:25:13.817 --> 02:25:16.380]  A project after the first phase is over?
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:19.443]  Yeah, we need to keep the Minuteman project going.
[02:25:20.624 --> 02:25:22.286]  Not just a few weeks, but a few months.
[02:25:22.506 --> 02:25:28.512]  I did see a little tidbit in the news about it cutting way back on the number of illegals and that they are backing up.
[02:25:28.853 --> 02:25:30.975]  I hadn't seen that 3,000 a day number.
[02:25:31.035 --> 02:25:31.776]  Goodness gracious!
[02:25:32.850 --> 02:25:34.791]  I knew it was over 3,000 a day crossing.
[02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:36.231]  Three million a year.
[02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:39.292]  That's the number one crossing in the country, but goodness gracious.
[02:25:39.412 --> 02:25:40.773]  They're just stuck on the other side.
[02:25:40.793 --> 02:25:44.114]  They're sitting on the desert floor and the Mexican Army is giving them water.
[02:25:44.374 --> 02:25:46.835]  Well, the Mexican government gives them training manuals on how to get across.
[02:25:47.095 --> 02:25:48.115]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:25:48.695 --> 02:25:50.336]  Give me the Tombstone Tumbleweed's number.
[02:25:50.456 --> 02:25:50.956]  I'll call them.
[02:25:50.976 --> 02:25:52.497]  We'll try to get one of their people on right now.
[02:25:53.877 --> 02:25:54.277]  Alright?
[02:25:56.118 --> 02:25:58.379]  So, folks, get that number from him.
[02:25:58.519 --> 02:25:59.379]  Call the Tumbleweed.
[02:26:00.089 --> 02:26:00.689]  Thanks Alex.
[02:26:00.709 --> 02:26:03.851]  I wanted to ask you a couple of things if you could possibly encapsulate them.
[02:26:28.450 --> 02:26:33.993]  The first one is, what is the agenda of the very highest level masons?
[02:26:35.274 --> 02:26:46.281]  And if you could touch on the white slavery rings, particularly, I guess Kofi Annan's involved in one of them, I hear.
[02:26:46.301 --> 02:26:49.082]  Yeah, that's been in the mainstream news.
[02:26:50.043 --> 02:26:54.846]  And if you could just encapsulate about the masons and that, I'd appreciate it.
[02:26:55.746 --> 02:26:56.327]  I'll do that.
[02:26:56.367 --> 02:26:57.267]  We're about to break.
[02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:59.129]  Any other questions?
[02:26:59.169 --> 02:27:00.991]  I'll do it when we get back.
[02:27:01.211 --> 02:27:02.292]  One comment.
[02:27:02.873 --> 02:27:07.957]  I don't know what you think of this, but I'm predicting that Condoleezza Rice will be the next president.
[02:27:09.659 --> 02:27:10.660]  I've been hearing that.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:13.262]  But people thought it'd be Powell, too.
[02:27:13.702 --> 02:27:14.123]  I don't know.
[02:27:15.704 --> 02:27:18.667]  My money's on Swartzy in 08 or 012.
[02:27:19.708 --> 02:27:21.009]  That's what all the indicators are.
[02:27:22.973 --> 02:27:24.754]  Okay, well, thank you, Alex.
[02:27:25.234 --> 02:27:25.814]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:25.854 --> 02:27:32.956]  I'll try to answer your two questions when we get back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:36.218 --> 02:27:37.118]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.598 --> 02:27:39.199]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.119 --> 02:27:42.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.619 --> 02:27:49.761]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:52.663]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:54.244]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:27:54.424 --> 02:28:04.330]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:06.271]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:28:06.571 --> 02:28:10.434]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:28:10.674 --> 02:28:15.078]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:28:15.298 --> 02:28:19.121]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:28:19.381 --> 02:28:25.506]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:28:25.746 --> 02:28:28.547]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:28:28.727 --> 02:28:32.068]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[02:28:32.168 --> 02:28:36.029]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[02:28:36.149 --> 02:28:38.189]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:28:38.489 --> 02:28:39.970]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:51.845]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.985 --> 02:28:58.149]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.429 --> 02:29:06.876]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.116 --> 02:29:14.141]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.441 --> 02:29:19.284]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.484 --> 02:29:24.888]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.228 --> 02:29:28.310]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.651 --> 02:29:36.596]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.656 --> 02:29:37.216]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:53.130]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:29:53.511 --> 02:29:54.792]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:29:54.992 --> 02:29:55.673]  Now check this out.
[02:29:56.013 --> 02:29:59.457]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:29:59.757 --> 02:30:01.940]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:05.103]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:06.064]  Your health suffers.
[02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:06.984]  It's that simple.
[02:30:07.305 --> 02:30:11.286]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[02:30:11.727 --> 02:30:19.730]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:24.192]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[02:30:24.553 --> 02:30:25.893]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[02:30:30.075 --> 02:30:36.219]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:39.381]  I'm Gary Cusmato, because healthy is what you want to do.
[02:30:39.401 --> 02:30:40.322]  Call 877-817-9829, or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:31:00.566 --> 02:31:06.470]  I guess I missed the notification, but in the third hour each day of the daytime show, we have a new frequency on shortwave.
[02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:14.455]  Of course, for those that lost what frequency we're on, it's kind of hard to explain that to them, but we'll try to tell you that before we end the broadcast.
[02:31:15.635 --> 02:31:19.398]  I'll answer the last caller's question after we're done with this guest.
[02:31:20.298 --> 02:31:21.239]  He's Gray Deegan.
[02:31:22.071 --> 02:31:27.616]  And he's the head administrator there at the Tombstone Tumbleweed for the Minuteman Project.
[02:31:27.636 --> 02:31:29.218]  He's a volunteer in his own capacity.
[02:31:29.818 --> 02:31:33.221]  And so the caller called in and talked about talking to Gray, and I'm aware of Gray's work.
[02:31:34.082 --> 02:31:42.590]  And to bring us up to speed, not just on what the mainstream media is saying about the thousand plus volunteers down that one sector of the southern border in Arizona,
[02:31:44.016 --> 02:31:44.737]  No problem at all.
[02:31:44.937 --> 02:31:45.918]  When you do this I love it.
[02:31:58.456 --> 02:32:00.697]  I think there's a radio on in the background, but it doesn't matter.
[02:32:00.717 --> 02:32:01.698]  You can leave it on, whatever.
[02:32:02.238 --> 02:32:04.079]  We've just got a lot of people in this room.
[02:32:04.339 --> 02:32:05.059]  I bet you do.
[02:32:05.139 --> 02:32:10.102]  Well, listen, the caller was saying that 3,000 a day are stacking up.
[02:32:10.162 --> 02:32:13.203]  We know the Mexican Army's already there giving them water in the past.
[02:32:13.244 --> 02:32:15.245]  Give us a report exactly what's happening.
[02:32:15.865 --> 02:32:27.931]  Well, the Mexican Army and other special units of the Mexican government are trying to move the Mexican people away from the border as it's set up right now in our particular area.
[02:32:28.653 --> 02:32:33.575]  We're actually observing areas about 60 miles long on the border.
[02:32:33.675 --> 02:32:56.163]  They're trying to move people both to the east and west of us and staging them to cross so they avoid our observation points, but also so they avoid the many hundreds of Border Patrol agents which have been brought in from other parts of Arizona.
[02:32:56.778 --> 02:32:59.059]  California and New Mexico.
[02:32:59.679 --> 02:33:04.301]  So, again folks, thousands and thousands of people cross there every day.
[02:33:05.082 --> 02:33:06.742]  They're stacking up like cordwood.
[02:33:06.762 --> 02:33:09.704]  The Mexican government puts out manuals on how to infiltrate.
[02:33:09.984 --> 02:33:14.466]  And here are the Mexican troops who've shot and killed federal officers, attacked and kidnapped families.
[02:33:14.506 --> 02:33:15.286]  Mainstream news.
[02:33:15.746 --> 02:33:19.748]  They're now staging them and moving them around to other areas.
[02:33:19.808 --> 02:33:21.569]  Is the mainstream media picking up on this?
[02:33:22.529 --> 02:33:26.291]  Actually, a couple of them are actually starting to pay attention.
[02:33:27.522 --> 02:33:29.768]  They're not all paying attention, of course, but...
[02:33:36.207 --> 02:33:37.028]  I have no idea.
[02:33:37.048 --> 02:33:42.834]  You know, we look at about somewhere between $2,500 and $3,000, and that comes through our little section.
[02:33:42.854 --> 02:33:55.187]  Those are going to be shifted over to other places, which the present administration has pulled the resources, the meager resources that usually watch those areas, over to this area to make a publicity show.
[02:33:55.608 --> 02:33:57.089]  Now, we've already got...
[02:33:58.931 --> 02:34:01.352]  We've already got dozens of aircraft in the air.
[02:34:01.372 --> 02:34:03.052]  Is that how you're able to know what they're doing?
[02:34:03.072 --> 02:34:13.434]  Yes, we have aircraft, we have observers of all kinds, and then we of course have the mainstream media coming in here and giving us reports.
[02:34:13.494 --> 02:34:17.215]  Has the Tombstone Tumbleweed been able to post any photos or video?
[02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:18.616]  No, not yet.
[02:34:18.636 --> 02:34:24.457]  What we're doing right now is we're using every bit of our resources to do nothing more than to keep up with
[02:34:25.898 --> 02:34:27.680]  This volunteer effort.
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:32.985]  What about heading them off at the pass and traveling to the other staging points to expose that?
[02:34:34.026 --> 02:34:35.287]  There has been discussion of that.
[02:34:35.347 --> 02:34:41.192]  Right now what we have to do, first of all, and you realize this, we have to make sure our people are kept out of harm's way.
[02:34:41.752 --> 02:34:52.462]  And so any additional work that we do or any additional sites that we do have to be completely scouted out in advance to assure ourselves that our volunteers will not be put in harm's way.
[02:34:53.991 --> 02:34:55.112]  I wish I could be there.
[02:34:55.132 --> 02:35:02.176]  Well, you're more than welcome to come on down and set up a remote feed and talk to the people right from where it's happening.
[02:35:03.016 --> 02:35:09.500]  Yeah, I just, unfortunately for a three hour show, phone feeds really don't work well, or affiliates don't like that.
[02:35:11.781 --> 02:35:17.024]  If I had some good guest hosts who I could get to fill in for me, I'd probably... How long is this going to be going on?
[02:35:17.324 --> 02:35:19.445]  We're going to be doing this through the 30th of April.
[02:35:20.237 --> 02:35:22.701]  And boy, I tell you, thousands are stacked up now.
[02:35:22.781 --> 02:35:27.348]  How do you know the Mex... I mean, we know the Mexican troops are there, but how do you know they're there giving them water and all this?
[02:35:27.568 --> 02:35:30.813]  Well, because we've got... well, the volunteers have been observing them.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:38.642]  I mean, we're talking, you know, we're well within very good field classes viewing from our points of observation.
[02:35:38.742 --> 02:35:41.782]  One of the Mexican troops doing is grabbing around with trucks, giving them water?
[02:35:41.882 --> 02:35:46.063]  Well, basically what they've been doing the last four days is that's what they normally do.
[02:35:46.583 --> 02:35:50.004]  And then they also set up guard stations over the staging areas.
[02:35:50.024 --> 02:35:53.225]  But now what they've been doing is loading them into the back of the trucks and
[02:35:54.145 --> 02:35:59.634]  Well, Mr. Deegan, this is so beautiful in the spirit of 1776 or the Alamo, to see over a thousand Americans.
[02:36:09.961 --> 02:36:15.942]  Down there resisting this invasion, this open invasion, I mean, the troops are there helping them!
[02:36:16.282 --> 02:36:17.323]  This is insane!
[02:36:18.083 --> 02:36:33.026]  Any other country in the world, if you had 3,000 people coming across from one little area, remember, this is just an area we picked out for operations because it is familiar to the folks here in Arizona that started Civil Homeland Defense.
[02:36:34.179 --> 02:36:53.583]  Remember, this is Civil Home Defense, which is essentially a neighborhood watch group, which finally said, hold it... Listen, Homeland Security tells people to look through neighbor's fences and spy on them, but then you guys go down to the border to show illegal aliens engaging in felonies, and you're bad.
[02:36:54.296 --> 02:36:57.320]  Well, actually, the President of the United States called us vigilantes.
[02:36:57.620 --> 02:37:00.183]  As if calling us nasty names would make us go away.
[02:37:00.383 --> 02:37:02.085]  Well, I don't think vigilante is a nasty name.
[02:37:02.526 --> 02:37:06.571]  Well, you know, he tried to do it that way, so he tried to paint us as something terrible.
[02:37:08.573 --> 02:37:09.814]  Because he wants amnesty.
[02:37:11.636 --> 02:37:13.699]  Well, I'm not sure he deserves amnesty.
[02:37:16.824 --> 02:37:20.667]  It's treason, isn't it?
[02:37:21.668 --> 02:37:30.856]  The real mission of the Minutemen is to come down here and do just exactly what this president asked us to do when he created the Department of Homeland Defense.
[02:37:31.637 --> 02:37:34.039]  You'll remember this, all you listeners will remember.
[02:37:34.079 --> 02:37:36.001]  We were encouraged to be ever vigilant.
[02:37:36.579 --> 02:37:40.342]  And to report any unusual activity to the appropriate authorities.
[02:37:40.442 --> 02:37:41.503]  That's precisely what we're doing.
[02:37:41.543 --> 02:37:45.847]  But that's internally to set up a police state, not to actually defend the country.
[02:37:45.907 --> 02:37:47.888]  Well, we turned it around on him a little bit.
[02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:54.073]  And we said, hold it, we're going to look outward and we're going to talk about the invasion that is taking place.
[02:37:54.194 --> 02:37:56.475]  And of course, what you're doing is wildly popular.
[02:37:56.676 --> 02:37:59.098]  They passed that proposition in Arizona.
[02:37:59.138 --> 02:38:01.099]  A majority of Hispanics voted for it as well.
[02:38:01.339 --> 02:38:02.601]  They're trying to make it racial.
[02:38:02.661 --> 02:38:03.081]  It's not.
[02:38:03.481 --> 02:38:05.483]  Stop giving all the illegals all this welfare.
[02:38:06.826 --> 02:38:10.027]  Meanwhile, North Carolina is going to give free tuition to illegals.
[02:38:10.667 --> 02:38:12.907]  There are other states considering that also.
[02:38:14.268 --> 02:38:23.670]  At some point, the people of the United States are going to have to stand up to their state, local, and federal governments and tell them very clearly, no, this is not what we want.
[02:38:24.090 --> 02:38:26.030]  Are more people now?
[02:38:26.190 --> 02:38:27.230]  Are more people now?
[02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:35.672]  As long as people sit and watch situation comedies on their TV sets and do not become active in their nations,
[02:38:36.559 --> 02:38:45.166]  Well, Gray, I can only commend you and Chris and everybody else for actually putting your bodies, your flesh and blood where your mouth is and you are there!
[02:38:56.635 --> 02:39:00.037]  I mean, I hear even more people are now flocking there.
[02:39:00.097 --> 02:39:04.279]  This could possibly go into a second month, couldn't it?
[02:39:04.839 --> 02:39:06.980]  The biggest thing we need right now is resources.
[02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:12.323]  We've got a lot of bodies coming in, but just the Port-a-Potty bill is kind of astronomical.
[02:39:13.664 --> 02:39:18.246]  All this is taking place in extremely rural areas.
[02:39:19.062 --> 02:39:31.736]  We've been informed by both the BLM and the state land managers that anybody going potty that is not in a port-a-potty can be arrested for, I guess, littering or sewage disposal or something.
[02:39:31.756 --> 02:39:34.018]  But they won't arrest the illegals for doing that stuff?
[02:39:34.359 --> 02:39:35.300]  No sir, they do not.
[02:39:38.536 --> 02:39:43.379]  BLM people do not take any action at all against illegals.
[02:39:43.479 --> 02:39:46.901]  I don't want to give them ideas, but they'll probably blame you for what they're doing.
[02:39:47.281 --> 02:39:53.784]  Well, that is probably, but you know, the thing is Mexican trash is pretty easy to determine because it has Mexican labels on it.
[02:39:54.325 --> 02:40:00.888]  Ours have American labels on what we may have left out there, which our people are told every day, pack it in, pack it out.
[02:40:01.028 --> 02:40:05.351]  Do not leave a single thing there and make sure you do not use the dumpsters provided
[02:40:05.891 --> 02:40:12.835]  By the county or the state, we have areas where you can dispose of it.
[02:40:13.195 --> 02:40:16.597]  They talked about putting dumpsters in and then forcing us to pay for the dumpsters.
[02:40:16.617 --> 02:40:17.738]  We've already got that covered.
[02:40:21.819 --> 02:40:33.909]  Now, at the same time, we've had Forest Service agents killed in that area, Border Patrol killed in that area, Mexican troops shooting up houses, kidnapping families here in Texas.
[02:40:34.029 --> 02:40:35.811]  Members of the Park Service were killed also.
[02:40:36.271 --> 02:40:39.374]  Yes, but still, I've talked to your organization before.
[02:40:39.794 --> 02:40:43.057]  You're still bad and evil though, even though you're trying to save their lives.
[02:40:45.203 --> 02:40:48.424]  According to the federal government and the current administration, yes sir.
[02:40:48.744 --> 02:40:56.767]  But I have had the head of the Border Patrol Union on and he said this is about a New World Order and that most of their agents are on your side.
[02:40:57.527 --> 02:41:04.829]  I have received thumbs up from almost every Border Patrol agent I've driven past except for the higher ranking.
[02:41:05.509 --> 02:41:06.650]  Those are the Commissars?
[02:41:07.770 --> 02:41:11.051]  They're appointed by the current administration, yes sir.
[02:41:12.117 --> 02:41:13.157]  Unbelievable!
[02:41:13.277 --> 02:41:15.498]  Well, how do we support the Minuteman Project?
[02:41:15.618 --> 02:41:31.241]  Well, you know, you can call down here after tomorrow if you want to volunteer directly, if you want to actually provide help out with a little bit of funding, help pay for some of the porta-potties and electricity we burn and gas we burn to get people in and out of this stuff.
[02:41:32.761 --> 02:41:39.683]  You can mail checks to Civil Homeland Defense, and of course you know that's our parent organization.
[02:41:40.345 --> 02:41:42.086]  And that's one you've talked to in the past, right?
[02:41:42.327 --> 02:41:42.707]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:42.867 --> 02:41:51.674]  So it's Civil Homeland Defense, or CHD, and that is DO Box 1579, Tombstone, Arizona, 85638.
[02:42:03.408 --> 02:42:06.530]  Now, and of course the website for the Tombstone Tumbleweed.
[02:42:06.931 --> 02:42:14.316]  Yes, or you can also go into the Minuteman, or you can go into civilhomelanddefense.us.
[02:42:16.795 --> 02:42:21.218]  And that will take you directly to our parent organization and we have a PayPal site there.
[02:42:21.578 --> 02:42:22.338]  Alright, good.
[02:42:22.358 --> 02:42:24.580]  Just a few more questions and I'm going to let you go.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:26.801]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:27.901 --> 02:42:33.084]  We heard about the MS-13 Latin gangs wanting to come and kill the Mexican troops.
[02:42:34.305 --> 02:42:35.266]  What's happened so far?
[02:42:35.286 --> 02:42:36.046]  Nothing.
[02:42:38.307 --> 02:42:44.251]  So they're basically just over there trying to stage the massive invasion but you're holding them back right now?
[02:42:45.166 --> 02:42:57.311]  Well, what they're doing is the Mexican government personnel are trying to move the invaders to the right and to the left of our lines.
[02:42:57.891 --> 02:43:01.353]  Otherwise, they're trying to outflank us, which they'll be able to do because we don't have enough people.
[02:43:02.853 --> 02:43:10.797]  And as for the MS-13 and the other criminal elements, you've got to realize that we are, in fact, standing in the way
[02:43:11.915 --> 02:43:13.936]  of huge criminal gangs.
[02:43:14.217 --> 02:43:17.039]  Drug dealers, cocaine, heroin dealers, everything.
[02:43:17.519 --> 02:43:21.501]  Weapons dealers, sex slave dealers, and human smugglers.
[02:43:22.562 --> 02:43:24.864]  All of these things are terrible.
[02:43:25.704 --> 02:43:38.833]  You know, and the problem is, and each one of the listeners, ask yourself, I'm begging you, ask yourself, why would people flee their country unless they were fleeing a totalitarian government?
[02:43:40.572 --> 02:43:42.513]  This is a rhetorical question, but think about it.
[02:43:43.753 --> 02:43:50.236]  Well, I agree with you in what you're doing is historical, and this is a chance for folks out there listening to be part of history.
[02:43:50.256 --> 02:43:51.557]  Know that it is dangerous.
[02:43:52.077 --> 02:43:54.338]  Know what you're getting into, but freedom is dangerous.
[02:43:54.638 --> 02:43:56.299]  But slavery is even more dangerous.
[02:43:56.839 --> 02:43:58.600]  And, uh, Gray, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:43:59.160]  Hey, hold up.
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:01.201]  Before you... Can I have another minute?
[02:44:01.241 --> 02:44:03.042]  I've got an interesting quote here for you.
[02:44:03.402 --> 02:44:03.622]  Sure.
[02:44:04.123 --> 02:44:04.603]  Okay?
[02:44:05.183 --> 02:44:07.084]  I'm going to reach across my desk here and grab it.
[02:44:11.588 --> 02:44:14.530]  If you're listening to the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:18.452]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:44:18.472 --> 02:44:18.892]  Go ahead.
[02:44:19.332 --> 02:44:26.516]  Okay, that quote came from NETCOM, which is a spokesman for the large army force that is here.
[02:44:27.256 --> 02:44:34.560]  And many of the soldiers and the dependents have asked the Army if they can take part in what we're doing.
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.221]  And the commanding general
[02:44:38.135 --> 02:44:51.057]  uh... refused to do that and uh... he issued a statement uh... that said that uh... that they have to keep them from participating in any activity of patrolling, monitoring or otherwise intentional act.
[02:44:51.237 --> 02:44:54.898]  But one spot they could actually defend the country's the border but they can't do it.
[02:44:55.238 --> 02:44:59.499]  From associating with, identifying or detaining illegal immigrants.
[02:44:59.579 --> 02:45:01.019]  We do not detain by the way.
[02:45:01.039 --> 02:45:07.200]  Now he was asked about that statement later and his spokesman Mr. Eric Horton
[02:45:07.953 --> 02:45:09.594]  Yeah, don't put soldiers in that situation.
[02:45:09.674 --> 02:45:10.755]  That's not their job.
[02:45:27.867 --> 02:45:38.592]  The President of the United States calls us vigilantes, and then one of his general officers states that it is too dangerous to do the job, that the majority of us are grandmas and grandpas.
[02:45:39.493 --> 02:45:42.554]  Most of us are between 55 and 80 years of age.
[02:45:44.875 --> 02:45:45.896]  I need to come down there.
[02:45:45.916 --> 02:45:47.577]  Alright, thanks for coming on, Greg.
[02:45:47.597 --> 02:45:48.557]  You betcha.
[02:45:48.977 --> 02:45:52.919]  Keep up the good work, and if anybody can help out in any way, we could use the help.
[02:45:53.099 --> 02:45:53.940]  Alright, God bless you.
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:54.320]  Take care.
[02:45:55.641 --> 02:45:56.942]  Unbelievable, folks.
[02:45:57.042 --> 02:45:58.083]  So there you have it.
[02:46:00.385 --> 02:46:01.926]  Let's jam a few calls in here.
[02:46:03.287 --> 02:46:05.209]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:46:05.249 --> 02:46:06.210]  Tim, go ahead quickly.
[02:46:06.370 --> 02:46:06.950]  Afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:08.472]  Finally, some resistance.
[02:46:09.092 --> 02:46:19.901]  I asked you before, what do you think the overall level of resistance is going to be when they start pushing for all of this, you know, the swiping of our cards and the RFID stuff?
[02:46:20.441 --> 02:46:21.282]  And when will it begin?
[02:46:22.270 --> 02:46:24.071]  Well, the resistance has already begun.
[02:46:24.091 --> 02:46:28.152]  It's just the mainstream media doesn't cover it, so the average person doesn't know it exists.
[02:46:28.192 --> 02:46:28.673]  It's huge.
[02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:33.735]  In your opinion, do you consider China a model New World Order country?
[02:46:34.075 --> 02:46:35.155]  The United Nations does.
[02:46:35.195 --> 02:46:36.716]  They give them all the big awards.
[02:46:36.916 --> 02:46:40.457]  The chief laborer, the totalitarian government, instant execution, stuff like that.
[02:46:41.058 --> 02:46:43.238]  And earlier you were talking about movies and TV.
[02:46:43.839 --> 02:46:48.621]  And in the past I've heard you talk about Stanley Kubrick and his last movie, Eyes Wide Shut.
[02:46:49.281 --> 02:46:49.501]  Yes.
[02:46:51.204 --> 02:46:59.028]  I know you're not into celebrity, but what would be really interesting is if you could ever get Tom Cruise to come on and ask him about those scenes that were deleted.
[02:46:59.528 --> 02:47:03.630]  And maybe he would talk to you about it and give you some insight as to what was actually taken out of that film.
[02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:06.191]  But didn't it have to do with ritual and things like that?
[02:47:06.811 --> 02:47:07.551]  Yes, it did.
[02:47:07.752 --> 02:47:10.573]  And he died shortly during the production of it, didn't he?
[02:47:11.233 --> 02:47:11.513]  Yes.
[02:47:11.633 --> 02:47:13.094]  He had a major heart attack or something?
[02:47:13.114 --> 02:47:13.814]  Right at the end, yeah.
[02:47:14.194 --> 02:47:14.655]  Holy cow.
[02:47:15.895 --> 02:47:19.857]  Well, anyway, thanks for all your work and we're all behind you.
[02:47:20.444 --> 02:47:21.344]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:22.145 --> 02:47:28.907]  We'll come back and take a few final calls in this final segment that's coming up and I'll give you that new frequency change as well.
[02:47:29.407 --> 02:47:30.727]  So have your pens and paper ready.
[02:47:31.667 --> 02:47:34.648]  My new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[02:47:34.708 --> 02:47:36.569]  Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:42.451]  Three hours long, three hours plus long on DVD.
[02:47:44.316 --> 02:47:47.798]  2 hours 35 minutes on VHS is now available.
[02:47:47.858 --> 02:47:49.179]  It is an amazing film.

[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:52.741]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.041 --> 02:48:54.422]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.602 --> 02:48:56.822]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.962 --> 02:48:59.043]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.323 --> 02:49:04.265]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.605 --> 02:49:08.626]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.886 --> 02:49:10.647]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.747 --> 02:49:21.390]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.530 --> 02:49:23.431]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.631 --> 02:49:27.512]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:50:04.082 --> 02:50:05.882]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:06.162 --> 02:50:09.463]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.803 --> 02:50:20.285]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.565 --> 02:50:21.065]  That's right!
[02:50:21.246 --> 02:50:28.347]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.647 --> 02:50:32.773]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:51:40.842 --> 02:51:48.812]  You know, Tim was so interested in me about these two candidates, and I talked about it a fair amount during the campaign.
[02:51:49.232 --> 02:51:50.514]  Here are two sons of privilege.
[02:51:51.209 --> 02:51:54.670]  Who were raised by distinguished families in the Northeast.
[02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:58.051]  They went to two of the best prep schools in America, Andover and St.
[02:51:58.091 --> 02:51:58.412]  Paul's.
[02:51:58.832 --> 02:52:01.953]  They were at Yale at the same time, members of a secret society.
[02:52:02.313 --> 02:52:06.154]  They went in distinctly different directions after they left Yale University.
[02:52:06.534 --> 02:52:08.295]  And they come around now to meet each other.
[02:52:08.335 --> 02:52:09.976]  I was counting up their degrees the other day.
[02:52:10.036 --> 02:52:11.736]  This is an argument for a good education.
[02:52:11.756 --> 02:52:15.077]  Two degrees from Yale, one from Harvard and one from Boston College.
[02:52:15.097 --> 02:52:16.458]  That was Tom Brokaw.
[02:52:17.256 --> 02:52:18.096]  During the election.
[02:52:18.156 --> 02:52:19.717]  Oh, it's just because they have good education.
[02:52:19.737 --> 02:52:21.018]  You know, secret societies.
[02:52:21.618 --> 02:52:22.378]  No big deal.
[02:52:22.418 --> 02:52:23.759]  My new film, Martial Law.
[02:52:24.659 --> 02:52:27.720]  A whole hour of the two and a half hour plus film covers that.
[02:52:27.921 --> 02:52:29.141]  Get Martial Law, folks.
[02:52:29.441 --> 02:52:31.302]  Let's jam three final calls in here.
[02:52:31.382 --> 02:52:33.163]  Mark, Gary, and JR.
[02:52:33.583 --> 02:52:35.043]  Mark in South Dakota.
[02:52:35.464 --> 02:52:36.284]  Not South Dakota.
[02:52:36.604 --> 02:52:38.405]  That's San Diego, SD.
[02:52:38.865 --> 02:52:39.425]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:52:39.906 --> 02:52:41.206]  Hey, Mr. Alex.
[02:52:41.226 --> 02:52:43.167]  You're the definition of a one-man army.
[02:52:43.607 --> 02:52:45.107]  Setting the example for everybody.
[02:52:45.447 --> 02:52:51.409]  Hey, listen, Mr. Alex, I like to travel Southeast Asia, you know, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos, and Thailand, stuff like that.
[02:52:51.669 --> 02:52:53.109]  But I know about the depleted uranium.
[02:52:53.309 --> 02:52:54.349]  What do you think about going there?
[02:52:54.369 --> 02:52:57.370]  I mean, you know, am I going to come back all lit up or something, or what?
[02:52:58.210 --> 02:53:01.391]  Well, I don't think there's DU in Southeast Asia.
[02:53:02.051 --> 02:53:04.031]  From like, you know, blow-by or whatever, you know?
[02:53:04.952 --> 02:53:06.652]  Well, that stuff blows all over the planet.
[02:53:06.792 --> 02:53:09.612]  It's really being in the saturated areas where it's really bad.
[02:53:09.973 --> 02:53:11.893]  Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia.
[02:53:12.577 --> 02:53:13.678]  So I can get away with it then?
[02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:23.368]  Yeah, I mean, DU does in small levels blow around the globe, but those jet streams and trade winds carry dust across the planet.
[02:53:23.768 --> 02:53:29.854]  Routinely, stuff from the Mongolian desert covers our cars here in Texas.
[02:53:31.730 --> 02:53:33.611]  Um, alright, how about like ascorbic acid?
[02:53:33.631 --> 02:53:34.472]  What do you know about that?
[02:53:34.632 --> 02:53:42.937]  I called up one of these, uh, you know, one of these manufacturers, and the lady told me there was like wood alcohol in there, and the way it affected me, I'd kind of have to agree with it.
[02:53:42.957 --> 02:53:44.357]  What do you have to say about that?
[02:53:44.618 --> 02:53:45.758]  Are you talking about aspartame?
[02:53:46.519 --> 02:53:48.600]  Uh, actually, ascorbic acid.
[02:53:49.105 --> 02:53:49.665]  Yeah, I'm not.
[02:53:49.765 --> 02:53:51.006]  I don't really know the details on that.
[02:53:51.046 --> 02:53:53.748]  I know that's part of the molecule with aspartame.
[02:53:54.108 --> 02:53:54.769]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:54.789 --> 02:53:57.150]  Good to hear from you, Mark in San Diego.
[02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:58.171]  Appreciate the compliment.
[02:53:58.951 --> 02:54:01.072]  Let's talk to Gary in Virginia.
[02:54:01.132 --> 02:54:01.833]  Gary, go ahead.
[02:54:01.853 --> 02:54:02.853]  Well, hi, Alex.
[02:54:02.913 --> 02:54:03.614]  How you doing, sir?
[02:54:04.094 --> 02:54:04.454]  Pretty good.
[02:54:04.695 --> 02:54:16.362]  Listen, I got your video there that day, and I really do got to commend you, my friend, for your courage to go up there during the coronation and video that.
[02:54:16.382 --> 02:54:18.423]  That was a lot of my friends that I've seen up there.
[02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:22.852]  That was out there protesting that fiasco.
[02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:26.054]  So you got the Phil Marshall Law in your hand?
[02:54:26.635 --> 02:54:28.896]  Oh yeah, yeah, oh definitely, definitely.
[02:54:28.936 --> 02:54:30.898]  Well please make copies of it and get it out to people.
[02:54:30.918 --> 02:54:32.579]  Oh yeah, that I definitely doing.
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:36.382]  And there's just a couple of things that I'd like to say.
[02:54:36.402 --> 02:54:43.367]  That previous caller that was going to NOM or whatever, tell him to just be real careful because of the mines.
[02:54:44.293 --> 02:54:49.356]  And there's a whole lot of kids over there that are blown to pieces, and there's still a bunch of them in the ground.
[02:54:49.956 --> 02:54:55.098]  Anyhow... Well, unless he's out in the rice paddies, you shouldn't have a problem with undetonated munitions.
[02:54:55.518 --> 02:55:04.243]  Well... That remains a different, uh, you know what I'm saying, they didn't have any, uh, rice paddy, uh, city, didn't matter.
[02:55:04.863 --> 02:55:05.163]  I hear you.
[02:55:05.183 --> 02:55:06.444]  You know what I'm saying.
[02:55:06.844 --> 02:55:07.024]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:07.044 --> 02:55:11.686]  There's no, uh, there was no clarification about, you know, just take them out any way you can.
[02:55:11.986 --> 02:55:13.347]  Alright, thank you for the call, Gary.
[02:55:14.328 --> 02:55:14.788]  Good points.
[02:55:14.808 --> 02:55:15.669]  Thanks for getting the video.
[02:55:15.709 --> 02:55:21.951]  Before I go to J.R., the third hour of the daytime show has switched its frequency to 9.975.
[02:55:24.231 --> 02:55:31.274]  The first two hours are still on 9.985, but the last hour during the day, the third hour is 9.975.
[02:55:32.734 --> 02:55:34.015]  At night, it's still 3210.
[02:55:34.915 --> 02:55:35.415]  J.R.
[02:55:35.475 --> 02:55:36.015]  in Texas.
[02:55:36.075 --> 02:55:37.516]  J.R., you're our tail gunner.
[02:55:37.556 --> 02:55:37.996]  Go ahead.
[02:55:38.156 --> 02:55:38.536]  Alright.
[02:55:38.556 --> 02:55:39.937]  Thanks a lot for picking my call, Alex.
[02:55:41.465 --> 02:55:44.507]  There's something that affects my life almost on a daily basis.
[02:55:44.787 --> 02:55:47.069]  Here at the border, South Texas.
[02:55:47.549 --> 02:55:50.772]  And I'm sure it affects billions of other Americans' lives as well.
[02:55:50.952 --> 02:55:51.512]  Checkpoints?
[02:55:52.093 --> 02:55:53.053]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:55:53.093 --> 02:55:54.795]  Right at the border, Homeland Security.
[02:55:56.015 --> 02:56:03.140]  My question is... Well, they just run that on the border, and 20 miles away from the border are searching vehicles, and they just wave the illegals through.
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:04.862]  It's about searching your car, correct?
[02:56:05.382 --> 02:56:06.123]  That's it, yeah.
[02:56:06.283 --> 02:56:09.445]  And the thing is, I'm really concerned and worried and upset about
[02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:14.788]  I've been trying to find out what my rights are as an American border crosser.
[02:56:14.808 --> 02:56:18.770]  I mean, I can't find anything on the internet, on Homeland Security's website.
[02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:20.411]  Well, let me tell you the rules.
[02:56:20.911 --> 02:56:26.894]  Take your freedoms, but then any foreigner, whether they're Russian, Chinese, or Mexican, has total rights.
[02:56:27.454 --> 02:56:28.154]  We're out of time.
[02:56:28.214 --> 02:56:28.915]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:28.935 --> 02:56:29.735]  We'll talk more about it.
[02:56:30.435 --> 02:56:32.676]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:32.696 --> 02:56:33.176]  God bless.
[02:56:35.878 --> 02:56:36.478]  Hello, folks.
