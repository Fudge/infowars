[00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:06.292]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:08.033]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.813]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:11.313]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:13.594]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.594]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:21.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:33.337]  Well, the Pentagon has come out and said that torturing women and children in Abu Ghraib and other camps in Iraq
[00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.702]  Was just R&R.
[00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.002]  Rest and relocation.
[00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.703]  Rest and relaxation.
[00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:42.745]  And so I guess that's exactly what happened.
[00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:50.048]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh said last year that they were just relaxing and blowing off steam.
[00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:51.589]  And we have the clip of him saying that.
[00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:59.593]  So I guess next time somebody kidnaps a young woman in your town and rapes her and tortures her to death, they shouldn't charge the person.
[00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.494]  They should just say, hey, they were resting and relaxing.
[00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.151]  I mean, this is the New York Times, the London Guardian, you name it.
[00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:21.563]  Michael Meacher has come out, the Senior Member of Parliament, number three in the Blair government, until he resigned and laid out the evidence of the British government being involved in funding terrorists and carrying out terrorist operations.
[00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:27.468]  Much of what he said a few weeks ago on this broadcast, but even more in this new article,
[00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:36.253]  I'm not here to defend Mr. Bennett, but really his comments about abortions and blacks was taken out of context.
[00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:41.157]  The caller said that, and then he simply said that that was wrong.
[00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.522]  I'm not defending Bennett and his race forces and his gambling and his...
[00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.108]  You know, how fake he is.
[00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:49.948]  He's a globalist.
[00:01:50.088 --> 00:01:57.752]  Obviously, he and his brother play both sides of the political spectrum, but that's a diversionary issue, but we'll talk about it as well today.
[00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:04.255]  Incoming New York Fire Department chaplain questioned 9-1-1 story.
[00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:10.098]  He questioned the official 9-11 story.
[00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:15.901]  And he has now been relieved from his position.
[00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:16.782]  All he said was,
[00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:23.316]  Well, the experts say it would take weeks to wire a building like that, much less three of them, to bring them down.
[00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:35.640]  And it looks like controlled demolitions might have been used, so they said, sayonara, when he came out and said that, so he's been forced to resign.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:46.523]  And remember the whistleblower in the Pentagon who went public about how they knew that Mohammed Atta was, quote, Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-D-A, and that he was being protected?
[00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:54.835]  Well, now they're revoking his security clearance and talking about charging him.
[00:02:55.395 --> 00:03:04.937]  They've gone over his record with a fine-tooth comb and they found $67.79 in personal cell phone charges.
[00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:09.838]  He said the amount was a legitimate expense accrued so he could forward calls.
[00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:12.399]  So, they've picked over his record and
[00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:18.970]  All these years, they've picked over this Lieutenant Colonel's record, and why?
[00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.372]  Falsely claiming $341.80 in mileage and toll fees!
[00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:31.775]  He said he filed travel expenses based on what he was told by Human Resources staff.
[00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:34.416]  I mean... See?
[00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:36.713]  You're just evil, folks.
[00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:39.414]  Let's not talk about the government protecting Muhammad Ata.
[00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:57.465]  Let's have the whole news now focus in on this evil colonel who blew the whistle why he, he might have made $67 in a year of phone calls on his government cell phone that weren't really government calls.
[00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:03.036]  Well, calling his wife, how would that not be a government call when he's at work and he's got to tell her he's going to be late?
[00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:07.319]  But again, it shows how they divert us off of the issue.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.442]  And he may get some prison time now.
[00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:13.663]  He made phone calls.
[00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:17.946]  Forget the government controlling Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:25.352]  Let's talk about cell phone calls and toll road charges in his government car.
[00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.056]  Will Israel Start World War 3?
[00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:30.378]  An article that Paul Watson and I put together.
[00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:31.339]  A very important article.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.922]  That we shall go over.
[00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:37.624]  And we got Tex Mars joining us.
[00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.085]  Talking about his new mega book.
[00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:40.306]  It's a begging.
[00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:43.749]  Codex Magicka.
[00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.691]  A huge encyclopedic volume.
[00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:51.763]  On all the different occult activities and societies and symbolism.
[00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:54.246]  It is a blockbuster.
[00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:56.148]  You'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:57.770]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:58.011 --> 00:04:58.872]  InfoWars.net.
[00:04:59.152 --> 00:04:59.733]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:02.947]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:06.210]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.233]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:14.517]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:18.481]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:20.583]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:24.066]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:28.830]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.032]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:35.075]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:41.680]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.005]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:47.787]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:49.169]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.472]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:52.773]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:07.686]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:12.109]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.949]  We listened.
[00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.253]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:19.013]  We listened.
[00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:22.416]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.856 --> 00:06:23.396]  We listened.
[00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:25.978]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:28.766]  We listened.
[00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:34.347]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:36.108]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:43.870]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.551]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:57.941]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:02.584]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:05.826]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:08.868]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.251]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:07:13.492 --> 00:07:22.798]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname, Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:28.003]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:39.753]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support in so many ways.
[00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:40.253]  Much more.
[00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:46.516]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.
[00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.537]  Order your Zango by calling now, 800-625-2890.

[00:07:58.982 --> 00:08:06.106]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:08.747]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.938 --> 00:08:18.083]  Well, my friends, it is Monday.
[00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:20.585]  I trust you had a good weekend.
[00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:26.470]  Already, my friends, the third day of October, 2005.
[00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:33.717]  We're going to be here for the next two hours and 52 minutes, roughly.
[00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:36.760]  Tex Meyers will be joining us to talk about his new book,
[00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:39.855]  Codex Magicka in the second hour.
[00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:41.175]  Of course, we're going to have open phones.
[00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:52.779]  You're always welcome to call in about any news issue you wish to discuss or any new legislation that's been introduced, anything that's happening on the geopolitical scene.
[00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:56.280]  If you disagree with me, if you agree, whatever, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.901]  And I have a rule that if you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line with
[00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:07.938]  As far as the calls go.
[00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:16.208]  Now, what happens a lot of the time is people really don't disagree and they'll disagree in a sarcastic fashion just to go to the other line and that's not very fair.
[00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:21.714]  But there's really no way to control that because we don't screen calls.
[00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:27.701]  We ask your first name, where you're calling from, and if you volunteer that
[00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.772]  You disagree, you will go to the head of the line.
[00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:40.696]  And I'm told that Jeff in New Mexico disagrees, so he'll go ahead of David and Keith and others that are patiently, patiently holding.
[00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:41.417]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:52.101]  Coming up, we will get into Michael Meacher, that Member of Parliament coming out now.
[00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:56.023]  Even more evidence of government involvement in terrorism, funding, controlling,
[00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:00.457]  Al-Mi6a, Al-Ci8a.
[00:10:01.598 --> 00:10:03.779]  It's just the same story over and over again.
[00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.361]  New evidence of government involvement in the Bali bombing.
[00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:13.747]  And as that evidence came out, right on the heels of it, a government report of, oh yeah, here's a video clip showing who we say is the bomber.
[00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.730]  But there's now actual wars going on.
[00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.493]  As we expose these people, they then throw out more propaganda.
[00:10:22.862 --> 00:10:23.923]  So, very, very interesting.
[00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:25.364]  But I wanted to start with this first.
[00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:35.271]  So many people call into this radio show and they say, or I get emails or I get faxes or questions on other talk shows when I'm a guest.
[00:10:36.572 --> 00:10:48.981]  If the government, that is, elements of the government, I'm not saying the government, a criminal element of the government carried out 9-11, it'd be such a big deal that they'd never be able to contain it and the truth would come out.
[00:10:50.862 --> 00:10:52.563]  Well, yes, the truth did come out.
[00:10:52.703 --> 00:10:54.403]  The truth came out about killing Kennedy.
[00:10:55.404 --> 00:11:00.026]  The truth came out about the Gulf of Tonkin never really happening that triggered us into Vietnam.
[00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:02.767]  The truth came out about the USS Liberty.
[00:11:03.587 --> 00:11:10.310]  Our own government, in collusion with Israel, trying to sink that ship, our own ship, to blame it on Egypt for a pretext to invade Egypt.
[00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.170]  It's now admitted.
[00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.392]  I mean, I've had former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff on this show.
[00:11:14.592 --> 00:11:19.934]  I've had the admirals that took the phone call from LBJ saying, I want that ship going to the bottom.
[00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:23.832]  Understand, folks, it's not our opinion.
[00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:26.294]  Gladio's declassified.
[00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.155]  The U.S.
[00:11:27.175 --> 00:11:31.438]  government terror attacks carried out in Europe to be blamed on leftists.
[00:11:32.138 --> 00:11:34.600]  There's example after example after example.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.081]  Northwood's declassified.
[00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:37.162]  Official U.S.
[00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:42.326]  government plan to carry out terror attacks on our own nation and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:44.948]  Example after example after example.
[00:11:45.708 --> 00:11:47.009]  It does all come out.
[00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.972]  But no one ever gets in trouble
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.763]  People inside the government never go to jail for the crimes that they commit.
[00:12:03.203 --> 00:12:04.164]  That's the bottom line.
[00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:09.265]  And so they get more and more bold.
[00:12:10.085 --> 00:12:18.088]  And you talk about 9-11, I mean, we've had, what is it, like, nine FBI agents go public?
[00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:18.828]  Robert Wright,
[00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:28.113]  One of the most senior, the head of counter-terrorism, John O'Neill, went public and then was killed a few months later.
[00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:34.818]  I mean, told British newspapers that our government's going to allow an attack as a pretext to get Afghan oil.
[00:12:35.098 --> 00:12:36.859]  See, he didn't get the full picture at that time.
[00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:38.000]  He couldn't believe it.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.262]  But he did say, it's like Al-Qaeda's got a mole in the FBI.
[00:12:43.183 --> 00:12:46.305]  Well, see, you just, again, Mr. O'Neill, you didn't get the full picture.
[00:12:47.003 --> 00:12:55.267]  The people that control the FBI, control the CIA, control Al-Cieda, control Al-Mi6a, they control it all, buddy!
[00:12:55.587 --> 00:12:56.727]  It's all in history!
[00:12:57.308 --> 00:13:06.972]  Kermit Roosevelt admits he carried out bombings in 1953 in Iran, and blamed it on Mozadek to put the Shah in!
[00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:11.614]  Again, that guy gets up on NPR!
[00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:18.383]  I heard an interview from the early 80's and he just comes out and he just, Kermit Roosevelt, admits they carry out terror attacks.
[00:13:18.623 --> 00:13:19.444]  They're proud of it!
[00:13:19.684 --> 00:13:22.226]  Yeah, we blew up some mosques and shot some people.
[00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.588]  And then we blamed it on Mozadek.
[00:13:25.628 --> 00:13:26.849]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.712]  We hired 2,000 thugs to burn buildings and shoot people and blow stuff up.
[00:13:32.032 --> 00:13:33.053]  It worked real well.
[00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:37.696]  Just me and about a dozen other men were able to bring down the entire government.
[00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:38.497]  I'm pretty powerful.
[00:13:40.075 --> 00:13:42.197]  Oh, this stuff would come out!
[00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:43.118]  Yeah, it comes out!
[00:13:43.358 --> 00:13:44.579]  They go on TV!
[00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.720]  They go on the radio!
[00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:49.224]  And they say they did it 50 years later, and people don't even care.
[00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:50.545]  It's just like, oh, so what?
[00:13:51.306 --> 00:13:52.747]  But they wouldn't do that today!
[00:13:55.149 --> 00:14:05.559]  And we've got, you know, the civil admins of the world, and the neighborhood shippers of the world, and just all these people in government, and FAA employees go public and say, we were ordered to shred tapes!
[00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:12.252]  And Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco goes, I got a call the night before not to fly, what's going on?
[00:14:13.774 --> 00:14:17.777]  But all of it gets swept under the rug, goes into the memory hole, never existed.
[00:14:19.018 --> 00:14:24.482]  And all we do is collate all this information and make films about it and do radio shows covering it.
[00:14:24.683 --> 00:14:28.426]  We're not radical, we're not bizarre, we're not extreme.
[00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:32.600]  We go, gee, our own government says they carry out terror attacks.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.620]  They blame it on people.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.221]  Wow!
[00:14:34.401 --> 00:14:36.061]  They have whole doctrines written on it.
[00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:37.762]  They have whole textbooks written on it.
[00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:41.063]  Gee, let's... Oh, they have army field manuals on it.
[00:14:41.223 --> 00:14:42.123]  Here, here's a copy.
[00:14:42.183 --> 00:14:42.724]  It's public.
[00:14:43.064 --> 00:14:45.404]  Here, let's talk... Ooh, you're reading an army field manual.
[00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.405]  You're weird.
[00:14:46.425 --> 00:14:48.646]  Mmm, what do you think of the Red Sox?
[00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.027]  So, with all of that said, we come to this point.
[00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:58.409]  Pentagon revokes 9-1-1 officers' clearance.
[00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:17.028]  An officer who has claimed that a classified military unit identified four September 11th hijackers, you mean decoys, but these guys just can't face the full harm, before the 2001 attacks is facing Pentagon accusations of breaking numerous rules.
[00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:22.031]  Charges, his lawyers suggest, are aimed at undermining his credibility.
[00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:22.831]  Really?
[00:15:24.112 --> 00:15:28.234]  The alleged infractions by Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, 42,
[00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:41.799]  Include obtaining a service medal under false pretenses, improperly flashing military identification while drunk, and stealing pens!
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.440]  Oh!
[00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:46.583]  So now they've got a little army file on him, all the dirt they dug up over the years.
[00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:50.627]  Somebody claims he was drunk when he got pulled over.
[00:15:51.207 --> 00:15:52.668]  Some military police filed that.
[00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:54.490]  According to military paperwork,
[00:15:55.237 --> 00:15:57.978]  Uh, shown by his attorney at the Associated Press.
[00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:00.338]  Oh, he might have taken some pins home.
[00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:01.459]  Oh!
[00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:02.699]  Oh!
[00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:04.559]  This is pure evil.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.400]  Even if it's true, it's pure evil.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.962]  Schaefer was one of the first publicly linked September 11th leader Bahamut Adab to the unit code named Able Danger.
[00:16:12.982 --> 00:16:16.723]  Schaefer was one of five witnesses the Pentagon ordered not to appear.
[00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:18.043]  I'm sure they're all bad.
[00:16:18.903 --> 00:16:22.645]  September 21st before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the unit's findings.
[00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:26.507]  You know, these unit leaders, they know they're ruining their careers.
[00:16:26.947 --> 00:16:29.488]  They know what they're doing is career suicide.
[00:16:30.608 --> 00:16:32.169]  They're not doing it for money, fame.
[00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:33.730]  They're doing it because they love this country.
[00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.671]  And they're trying to protect this country.
[00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:38.212]  They're heroes.
[00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:50.453]  I mean, just on the face of it, they have nothing to gain but defending this country, and that's why they did it in their heroes, and now they're being crucified on the most ridiculous of flimsy charges.
[00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:54.514]  I mean, if all of this is true, oh wait, we haven't gotten to the worst part.
[00:16:54.955 --> 00:16:58.216]  Sixty-something dollars in cell phone calls to his wife.
[00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:08.179]  The military revoked Schaeffer's top security clearance this month, a day before he was supposed to testify to the Congressional Committee.
[00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.722]  That was going to be in secret, folks, if they ordered him under national security not to.
[00:17:12.022 --> 00:17:23.249]  It's like they told FBI agent Robert Wright not to, and he got up there and cried and said, All I can say is, the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens are what I know now.
[00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.510]  Yeah, you know now.
[00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:26.891]  It's horrible.
[00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:28.892]  You do, you know now, don't you?
[00:17:29.272 --> 00:17:30.193]  You know who they are.
[00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:30.813]  They are!
[00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:32.014]  They're the killers!
[00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:33.595]  And they're gonna kill more!
[00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:39.038]  Until we all become men and women and wake up to just how serious this is!
[00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:40.639]  This isn't a game!
[00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:41.939]  This isn't a joke!
[00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:46.862]  Here's the letter!
[00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:49.663]  I can't tell you what we know!
[00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:51.144]  Alright.
[00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:53.766]  I mean, yeah, wouldn't you cry?
[00:17:53.786 --> 00:17:54.826]  You thought you were a good guy?
[00:17:54.846 --> 00:17:55.947]  You thought you worked for the good guys?
[00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:57.868]  You find out you work for Beelzebub?
[00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:02.070]  And see, that's how this evil system works.
[00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:07.434]  It's got all these incredible heroes, these incredible men and women, in the military, in the FBI, everywhere.
[00:18:07.614 --> 00:18:08.815]  But you delude yourselves!
[00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:10.136]  You lie to yourselves!
[00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:12.018]  You do not face what you're a part of!
[00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:13.559]  Stop it!
[00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:15.040]  Stop it right now!
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:29.391]  This country's going to hell in a handbasket because you haven't had the ultimate courage, the moral courage, and the psychological studies show, moral courage, going against the grain, going against peer pressure, takes more courage than charging machine gun nests.
[00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:32.325]  You've gotta have the moral courage!
[00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:44.797]  Sighting concerns with the Privacy Act, Commander Terry Southerland, a Defense Intelligence Agency spokesman, declined to release any information on Schaefer.
[00:18:47.248 --> 00:18:55.775]  Zaid said he can't prove the Pentagon went after Schaefer because he's a whistleblower, but all the timing associated with the clearance issue has been suspiciously coincidental.
[00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:57.236]  No, really.
[00:18:57.297 --> 00:19:00.339]  They trump up all these charges the day before he's to testify.
[00:19:00.779 --> 00:19:02.201]  They're trumping them up on the other five.
[00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:10.227]  According to papers provided by Zaid, the Defense Intelligence Agency is questioning whether Schaefer deserved a Defense Moratorium Service Medal.
[00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:10.808]  He was awarded.
[00:19:10.848 --> 00:19:13.150]  Schaefer, who is supported by our retired colonel,
[00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:18.228]  Who has praised his work, says those challenging the medal do not have first-hand knowledge of his actions.
[00:19:18.468 --> 00:19:20.508]  So they just start challenging a medal he's got.
[00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:21.309]  I mean, how stupid.
[00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:31.972]  And it goes on to say, according to paperwork, the alleged infractions against Schaefer also include obtaining $67.79 in personal cell phone charges.
[00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:37.294]  He said the amount was a legitimate expense accrued so he could forward calls.
[00:19:38.294 --> 00:19:40.295]  Imagine being a colonel.
[00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:44.478]  And you're making cell phone calls on your government phone.
[00:19:45.078 --> 00:19:49.000]  Meanwhile, folks, there are tens of billions of dollars a year stolen.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.182]  I mean, most of these guys are like loading up 18 wheelers full of computers for sale.
[00:19:54.442 --> 00:19:55.402]  No one gets in trouble.
[00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:59.144]  This guy has some cell phone calls.
[00:19:59.424 --> 00:20:02.926]  Currency devaluation.
[00:20:03.006 --> 00:20:03.526]  Inflation.
[00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:04.226]  One and the same.
[00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:15.096]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:20:15.116 --> 00:20:17.177]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:20:17.197 --> 00:20:17.697]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:19.238]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:20:19.538 --> 00:20:19.978]  Here is reality.
[00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:22.039]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.562]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:44.864]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:20:45.284 --> 00:20:49.005]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:57.491]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:22:15.197 --> 00:22:22.000]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:24.341]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:27.643]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[00:23:05.023 --> 00:23:06.324]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:06.784 --> 00:23:09.485]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:12.567]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:13.007 --> 00:23:19.490]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:41.937 --> 00:23:42.277]  Have you?
[00:23:42.857 --> 00:23:44.377]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:46.318]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:47.898]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:23:53.035 --> 00:23:54.076]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[00:23:54.637 --> 00:23:55.818]  Osama Bin Forgotten?
[00:23:56.258 --> 00:23:59.882]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today!
[00:24:21.038 --> 00:24:30.461]  My final point on this army colonel who's being crucified is that you ask, where are they?
[00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:31.542]  Why don't they go public?
[00:24:31.582 --> 00:24:32.462]  Why don't they speak out?
[00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.603]  Why something this big would be exposed?
[00:24:36.443 --> 00:24:37.644]  They do speak out all the time.
[00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:40.545]  And we don't support them properly.
[00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:41.905]  You don't support them properly.
[00:24:42.605 --> 00:24:47.587]  And the government breaks them or busts them down or
[00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:50.945]  Goes after them for crooked toenails.
[00:24:52.906 --> 00:24:53.706]  For hangnails.
[00:24:55.007 --> 00:24:56.468]  And so that's what's happening here.
[00:24:57.349 --> 00:25:00.271]  And there is an ocean of whistleblowers.
[00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:03.113]  There is an ocean of people exposing corruption.
[00:25:03.633 --> 00:25:05.795]  And the system supports the corruption.
[00:25:06.935 --> 00:25:12.059]  There's a new book out by the former police chief of San Diego and Seattle.
[00:25:13.186 --> 00:25:14.227]  Or he talks about that.
[00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:28.438]  But they'd sit around in rooms and go, well, our officers are involved in crime, our officers are involved in pillage, they're involved in the murder of innocent people, but we have to cover it up because the city lawyers say we'll be liable.
[00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:43.196]  And then it actually creates a culture where the bad cops don't get in trouble, ravage whoever they want, and then it ends up costing the city, the county, the state, the country, even more money, and it makes the people hate all the good cops wrongly.
[00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:48.178]  And that's a big city police chief just came out with that book a few months ago.
[00:25:48.198 --> 00:25:49.038]  It's getting rave reviews.
[00:25:49.058 --> 00:25:49.818]  I've got to get him on.
[00:25:50.199 --> 00:25:51.299]  In fact, I forgot to do that.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.901]  I had Jack McClam on about the book, and there were a couple big magazine articles about it.
[00:25:58.429 --> 00:26:00.351]  Again, evil never pays.
[00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:02.933]  Cutting corners never pays.
[00:26:03.914 --> 00:26:06.536]  You know, it seems like it's working the first few times you do it.
[00:26:07.177 --> 00:26:09.239]  The first few times you falsify a report.
[00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:11.401]  The first few times you keep your mouth shut.
[00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:13.382]  The first few times you follow orders.
[00:26:13.763 --> 00:26:16.685]  But the society then starts breaking down.
[00:26:17.246 --> 00:26:18.807]  And it may not come back on you.
[00:26:19.268 --> 00:26:21.490]  It may come back on your son, on your daughter.
[00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:27.839]  Maybe when you're 75 years old and something horrible happens to that grandbaby, you love more than anything on earth.
[00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:31.780]  You're crying so hard, you feel like your guts are going to bust.
[00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:38.483]  You're wrenching so hard, and I want all those sins, when it happens, to flash in front of your eyes.
[00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:44.546]  I wish I'd have done something before it was too late.
[00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:47.647]  I wish I'd have listened to Alex Jones.
[00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:50.428]  It's going to be really bad.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.881]  Are so evil.
[00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:56.341]  I don't have words to describe them.
[00:26:58.402 --> 00:27:00.243]  Okay, there's a lot of news here.
[00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:07.345]  And I know we have phone calls we're going to get to, but I really do want to cover some of Will Israel start World War 3?
[00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:14.088]  And to finish the setup the US started by radicalizing and arming Iran in the first place.
[00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:22.561]  A detailed article getting into how they are openly saying, back on Friday, they may go ahead and start attacking Iran any day.
[00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:25.944]  When Iran admittedly has peaceful systems.
[00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:38.375]  Our own CIA's reports that are coming out that the government and the media doesn't want to talk about, the non-falsified reports say that it'll be ten years if they were to move forward with a public nuclear program.
[00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:41.658]  I mean, it's not easy to create an A-bomb, folks, much less a hydrogen bomb.
[00:27:42.972 --> 00:27:45.793]  Or an x-ray bomb, or a neutron bomb.
[00:27:45.853 --> 00:27:48.253]  It's very complex, but an A-bomb is hard enough.
[00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.814]  For another ten years!
[00:27:51.774 --> 00:27:53.174]  Ten years!
[00:27:54.334 --> 00:27:57.055]  And they've got UN video cameras, which is bad enough.
[00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:58.295]  They've given them to UN control.
[00:27:58.595 --> 00:28:03.416]  See, I mean, the good cops give them to UN control, the bad cop is, or we'll bomb you.
[00:28:04.837 --> 00:28:06.577]  And is it good for the people of Iran?
[00:28:06.597 --> 00:28:07.557]  Good for the people of Israel?
[00:28:07.577 --> 00:28:08.697]  Good for the people of America?
[00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:11.338]  Is it good for anybody to go to war with Iran?
[00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:18.087]  I mean, I know some of you want to sit around in your easy chair drinking whiskey and watching the war like it's a football game, but it isn't!
[00:28:19.007 --> 00:28:25.128]  Or a lot of you work for defense contractors and you figure you'll make some money off of it.
[00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:27.849]  It's bad, folks.
[00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:29.650]  Iran is not Iraq.
[00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:38.112]  Where our government was able to covertly pay off over two-thirds of Saddam's generals even before they attacked in 2003.
[00:28:41.724 --> 00:28:48.006]  Iran is in a situation where the CIA put Saddam Hussein in and do his every action, his every move.
[00:28:48.566 --> 00:28:49.706]  Trained him from the age of 18.
[00:28:53.047 --> 00:28:55.227]  No, these are people that our government doesn't control.
[00:28:59.268 --> 00:29:01.669]  They already tried to overthrow Iran two years ago.
[00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:03.629]  During the Iraq invasion.
[00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.110]  Remember all the rioting and bombing and stuff that went on in Iran?
[00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.851]  They tried to get the college students to
[00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:14.320]  You know, caused some popular insurrection, got squashed.
[00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.542]  And I'm sure those are wonderful youth.
[00:29:17.562 --> 00:29:20.564]  There's a lot of corruption that needs to be exposed in Iran.
[00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:30.990]  So then again, getting the resistance to flower and hacking it off, just like they did with the Shiites in 1991 in Iran.
[00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:36.734]  All right, we'll come back and hit a few news items and take some calls and go back in the news.
[00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:39.015]  And then Tex Mars joins us.
[00:29:39.764 --> 00:29:41.246]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:29:42.527 --> 00:29:43.649]  And don't forget the website.
[00:29:43.709 --> 00:29:45.511]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:46.052 --> 00:29:47.333]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:52.540]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.622]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:58.227]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:10.572]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:13.233]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:30:13.473 --> 00:30:15.434]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:21.117]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:30:21.517 --> 00:30:21.617]  Yes.
[00:30:21.637 --> 00:30:25.779]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:28.741]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[00:30:28.981 --> 00:30:34.123]  With its 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:30:34.323 --> 00:30:41.387]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:45.048]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:08.087]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.207 --> 00:31:14.372]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.652 --> 00:31:23.040]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:30.365]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:35.469]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.689 --> 00:31:41.093]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.454 --> 00:31:44.476]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:08.369]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:13.971]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:32:14.391 --> 00:32:17.392]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:13.857]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.221]  8 p.m.
[00:33:18.281 --> 00:33:18.901]  tonight.
[00:33:19.722 --> 00:33:20.582]  I won't be watching it.
[00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:22.604]  I'll be busy working on a new documentary.
[00:33:23.365 --> 00:33:25.927]  But perhaps I'll remember to tape it and watch it later.
[00:33:25.947 --> 00:33:27.168]  They're going to have a
[00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:30.616]  You were telling me about it, John.
[00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:32.458]  Is it Discovery Channel or History Channel?
[00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:34.019]  History Channel.
[00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.420]  John saw the ad for it.
[00:33:36.902 --> 00:33:38.944]  History Channel show about the Illuminati.
[00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:41.506]  The New World Order Illuminati.
[00:33:42.647 --> 00:33:45.950]  And of course, I'm sure it'll be a gigantic whitewash.
[00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:54.657]  The moral of the story is you're really a Ku Klux Klan member if you think royalty ever had any power or that elites ever wanted control.
[00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:59.392]  You know, the Founding Fathers are bad and evil, too.
[00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.612]  I mean, who knows?
[00:34:01.652 --> 00:34:02.532]  Who knows what they'll do?
[00:34:02.572 --> 00:34:04.753]  I've actually seen some good stuff on the History Channel.
[00:34:06.553 --> 00:34:13.735]  They had that big, what, week-long special where they had the eyewitnesses to the government killing Kennedy.
[00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:24.657]  LBJ's lawyer, the current White House Press Secretary's father, Barr McClellan, who we've had on the show, saying, yeah, LBJ told me he had Kennedy killed.
[00:34:26.229 --> 00:34:35.478]  I've had LBJ's mistress on, his admitted mistress, who had his only son, who later died of cancer by the way, mysteriously.
[00:34:36.018 --> 00:34:48.850]  But I've interviewed her in the studio, where she's there talking about, she's dead now, about being at the meeting with all the big globalists there in Dallas that had come in.
[00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:51.869]  And that is globalist gophers.
[00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:56.311]  All the top men for the globalists, all their top executives were there.
[00:34:57.111 --> 00:35:00.793]  And then LBJ said, well, we're going to kill that son of a bitch tomorrow.
[00:35:02.214 --> 00:35:03.034]  That's another quote.
[00:35:04.544 --> 00:35:09.549]  I had the other Admiral on who was on the phone with him over the radio phone when he said, I want that G.D.
[00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:10.590]  ship going to the bottom.
[00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.672]  Really nice fellow with the U.S.S.
[00:35:12.732 --> 00:35:13.332]  Liberty.
[00:35:14.473 --> 00:35:16.795]  I've heard the tape of L.B.J.
[00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:24.102]  on the phone at his ranch talking to McNamara in Washington at 2 o'clock in the morning and totally the attack didn't happen.
[00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:25.403]  We're telling the public it did.
[00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.265]  That's right, Mr. President.
[00:35:27.305 --> 00:35:28.566]  We've got to keep this quiet.
[00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:31.621]  This is the pretext we needed, actually.
[00:35:31.661 --> 00:35:33.182]  Our ships were in there attacking them.
[00:35:33.802 --> 00:35:36.583]  Alright, well, what do I tell the press and the media?
[00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:37.923]  What do I tell them then?
[00:35:37.943 --> 00:35:42.364]  I mean, again, I mean... I talked to his mistress.
[00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:43.645]  I talked to his lawyer.
[00:35:43.865 --> 00:35:46.586]  I listened to tapes of him on the phone with McNamara.
[00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:48.506]  We've got the evidence!
[00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:49.606]  Eyewitnesses!
[00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:51.087]  Tapes of him saying it!
[00:35:51.367 --> 00:35:52.547]  They're terrorists!
[00:35:52.607 --> 00:35:53.547]  They're ruthless!
[00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.568]  Stop being naive!
[00:35:57.769 --> 00:35:59.149]  But, uh, I would like to see that.
[00:36:00.996 --> 00:36:02.337]  Here's some of the news that's coming up.
[00:36:02.477 --> 00:36:06.920]  Brunton recruited terrorist, Michael Meacher claims, Agent News.
[00:36:08.801 --> 00:36:21.108]  An astonishing claim that MI6 recruited Muslim extremists in Britain for terror training abroad has been made by Oldham Member of Parliament and former Cabinet Minister Michael Meacher.
[00:36:21.866 --> 00:36:28.712]  Mr. Meacher also suggested that a British Muslim held under sentence of death in Pakistan for beheading a U.S.
[00:36:28.752 --> 00:36:32.235]  journalist is being kept alive because he was a British double agent.
[00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:42.684]  The Old Ham West and Royalton Member of Parliament makes these sensational claims in an article for the Asian news sister paper, The Guardian.
[00:36:43.783 --> 00:36:57.832]  A former environment secretary claims that Britain's overseas security organization, MI6, set about recruiting UK Muslims, directing them to support US efforts to overthrow communist governments in Afghanistan and Yugoslavia.
[00:36:58.373 --> 00:37:09.820]  He highlights a Delphi-based research foundation that estimates anything up to 200 UK Muslims could have been underground training in overseas terrorist camps.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.841]  And he goes in to talk about
[00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:16.535]  Top MI6 terrorist, or top terrorist or MI6.
[00:37:17.075 --> 00:37:29.120]  Basically a lot of what he talked about on the air here three weeks ago, but we published the interview and the statements he made and it didn't make one-tenth the splash that this Asia News article did.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.961]  We need to get the transcript of that Mitra article up.
[00:37:33.021 --> 00:37:40.824]  We need to write an expansive article on this because he said a lot more in the interview here than he said in this London Guardian story.
[00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:45.191]  We need to get the full ramifications out there for the public.
[00:37:46.252 --> 00:37:51.415]  But we'll get into Al-Ciada, Al-Mi6a.
[00:37:51.995 --> 00:37:55.657]  He writes, during an interview for Fox TV this summer, the former U.S.
[00:37:55.697 --> 00:38:07.804]  Federal Prosecutor John Watts reported that the British intelligence had used Al-Mujahideen group to recruit Islamist militants with British passports for the war against Serbs in Kosovo.
[00:38:07.844 --> 00:38:08.865]  Well, yeah, that was Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:23.316]  The now disbanded Al-Mujahideen group held meetings in Manchester after 9-11, praising the courage of the suicide bombers and claimed to be helping UK Muslims to fight US troops in Afghanistan.
[00:38:23.336 --> 00:38:31.965]  The feature also highlights the case of UK-born Muslim Omar Saeed Shaikh, sentenced to death for the murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl.
[00:38:32.714 --> 00:38:46.857]  He then goes on to get into the latest SWAT character who they're protecting who was on the terrorist watch list but was allowed back into the UK and now making cell phone calls the days of both bombings to both groups of supposed bombers.
[00:38:46.977 --> 00:38:48.978]  Well, yeah, he's the MI6 handler.
[00:38:49.798 --> 00:39:02.141]  The article goes on for three pages and gets into ISI and Amoud Ahmed wiring the money to Amoud Ahmed wiring the money
[00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:32.697]  to the supposed lead hijacker and then of course we have uh... the able danger colonel and the other five brass five members of the army brass in defense intelligence going public and saying look we knew he was al-qaeda and uh... our government knew and wouldn't let us stop them well of course they didn't let you stop the decoys they had to get on board so the remote control system could take over and carry out the attack ship
[00:39:33.937 --> 00:39:35.998]  Again, it's staring you right there in the face.
[00:39:37.579 --> 00:39:38.820]  So, uh, we have that article.
[00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:41.642]  Then we have this out of the Sunday Herald.
[00:39:41.982 --> 00:39:46.105]  Torture of Iraqis was for stress relief, say, U.S.
[00:39:46.165 --> 00:39:46.605]  soldiers.
[00:39:46.805 --> 00:39:49.887]  So, uh, just what Limbaugh said.
[00:39:49.947 --> 00:39:50.928]  It's stress relief.
[00:39:51.028 --> 00:39:55.311]  You know, torturing, killing is enjoyable for Ted Bundy and people like you.
[00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:57.472]  Uh, that's just admitted public.
[00:39:57.932 --> 00:40:03.256]  ABC, Inside the Secret of Bilderberg Group, big article, just flaunting Bilderberg Group in your face.
[00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:09.661]  Again, five years ago, Bilderberg Grip didn't exist, and I was attacked by the New York Times for even talking about it.
[00:40:09.681 --> 00:40:10.441]  It just didn't exist.
[00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:11.381]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:40:12.921 --> 00:40:17.803]  And, uh, striking Iran would shoot up oil prices to $400 a barrel.
[00:40:17.963 --> 00:40:20.043]  So, uh, what would $400 a barrel be?
[00:40:22.224 --> 00:40:25.065]  You'd be paying $10, $12 a gallon for fuel.
[00:40:30.823 --> 00:40:42.487]  And, uh, Military Occupies the U.S., that was our sub-headline last week in our two-part series, part three has yet to be written, about the end of posse commentatus.
[00:40:42.927 --> 00:40:47.969]  Well, I like Jim Tucker's headline, and all I'm saying is he came to the same conclusion.
[00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:55.092]  Uh, Military Occupies U.S., Army to Take Control During National Crisis.
[00:40:55.752 --> 00:40:58.693]  And that's really what they're doing, military occupying the U.S.
[00:40:59.705 --> 00:41:02.346]  And Jim Tucker has written an American Free Press article about this.
[00:41:02.366 --> 00:41:03.346]  We've got to get Jim on.
[00:41:03.366 --> 00:41:05.887]  Give us some of his expertise on that.
[00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:06.867]  Big, big deal.
[00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:09.168]  Glad somebody else sees it the same way we do.
[00:41:11.208 --> 00:41:14.629]  And Bush chooses Myers for Supreme Court.
[00:41:15.189 --> 00:41:16.210]  Tell you all about her.
[00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.271]  Thank God it's not Gonzalez, but I'm sure this one will be just as bad.
[00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:24.012]  And ID chips for all livestock.
[00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:28.375]  That's now starting up, and Big Brother, should it be in your car?
[00:41:28.795 --> 00:41:30.096]  This out of the Detroit News.
[00:41:30.116 --> 00:41:33.197]  That's right, already in your car.
[00:41:33.217 --> 00:41:34.418]  Nobody asked you.
[00:41:34.498 --> 00:41:36.819]  The transponders are now going to go in and start taxing you.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.302]  Former Education Secretary, black abortions would lower crime.
[00:41:41.842 --> 00:41:43.063]  I'm sure you've heard about this.
[00:41:45.444 --> 00:41:49.206]  And I don't like Mr. Bennett, but this is the last article I'll cover.
[00:41:49.606 --> 00:41:51.427]  Then I'll take calls and we'll go into more detail.
[00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.418]  Sorry if I sound a little stuffy, folks.
[00:41:55.498 --> 00:42:01.002]  I've got the perpetual allergies we're all laboring under here in the capital of allergies, Austin, Texas.
[00:42:03.343 --> 00:42:07.906]  So, uh, whenever I'm stopped up, I don't talk like this.
[00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:09.087]  I talk like this.
[00:42:09.987 --> 00:42:16.111]  Former Education Secretary, black abortions would lower crime.
[00:42:17.276 --> 00:42:30.622]  The White House on Friday criticized former Education Secretary William Bennett on Mr. 45,000 a night gambling, Mr. Virtue, for remarks linking the crime rate and the abortion of black babies.
[00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:34.560]  The President believes the comments were not appropriate.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:41.743]  White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, son of the man who was LBJ's lawyer, who says LBJ told him he killed Kennedy.
[00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:42.843]  Oh, side issue, sorry.
[00:42:43.203 --> 00:42:48.705]  The President believes the comments were not appropriate, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said.
[00:42:49.887 --> 00:43:01.872]  Bennett, on his radio show, Mourning an American, was answering caller's questions when he took issue with the hypothesis put forth in a recent book that one reason crime is down is that abortion is up.
[00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:06.974]  And folks, I've heard the clip of what Bennett did, and I don't know why he's being attacked.
[00:43:07.034 --> 00:43:09.955]  He actually said it was wrong to push that idea.
[00:43:10.395 --> 00:43:11.896]  That Peter Singer type idea.
[00:43:13.637 --> 00:43:14.959]  This is really twisted, folks.
[00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:17.001]  See, this is a dishonest attack.
[00:43:17.281 --> 00:43:20.745]  So conservatives see this, then, and then think everything liberals say is a lie.
[00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:30.795]  You've got to attack the globalists, whether they're liberal or, you know, liberal Democrats or conservative Republicans, on the issues.
[00:43:31.816 --> 00:43:32.957]  And they've got to be honest.
[00:43:33.097 --> 00:43:35.500]  But let me just get to the article.
[00:43:36.491 --> 00:43:46.821]  Bennett on his radio show, Morning in America, was answering a caller's question when he took issue with the hypothesis put forward in a recent book that one reason crime is down is that abortion is up.
[00:43:48.323 --> 00:44:00.955]  Now quote, but I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crimes you could, if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down, said Bennett, author of the Book of Virtues.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:08.105]  Well, I mean, if you aborted every baby, period, young people are always the new crime wave, statistically.
[00:44:08.165 --> 00:44:09.226]  Black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:18.173]  And you would see a reduction once that aborted age group got up to about 15 to 20, you would see a drop.
[00:44:18.993 --> 00:44:31.183]  He went on to call that an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down, so these far-reaching, extensive explorations are, I think, tricky.
[00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:42.821]  Responding later to criticism, Bennett said his comments have been mischaracterized and that his point was the idea of supporting abortion to reduce crime was morally reprehensible.
[00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:49.683]  Bennett was Education Secretary under President Reagan and Director of Drug Control Policy when President Bush's father was president.
[00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:53.225]  He's a horrible globalist creature.
[00:44:53.245 --> 00:44:55.505]  I mean, I can't stand Mr. Bennett.
[00:44:56.826 --> 00:45:02.248]  But, it is true that
[00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:08.573]  The highest crime rate in this country is in illegal aliens.
[00:45:09.653 --> 00:45:13.915]  The second highest crime rate is in black males between the age of 13 and 20.
[00:45:13.975 --> 00:45:20.758]  And the next, of course, highest crime rate is white males between that age.
[00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:24.019]  I mean, that's when people go robbing liquor stores.
[00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:27.640]  That's when people rob, you know, shoplift.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.661]  That's when people get into gang activities.
[00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:34.274]  That's when the military tries to recruit you to go kill people overseas.
[00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:39.836]  That's the age where you get violent and aggressive and want to go out and count coups.
[00:45:39.856 --> 00:45:45.619]  I mean, that's the age that Native Americans would send their young men off on their first raiding parties.
[00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:50.660]  So, the caller asked the question.
[00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:57.943]  And then Bennett said, well, it's true that if you aborted every black person, you would have lower crime.
[00:45:59.204 --> 00:46:02.727]  But again, if you aborted everybody in that age group, you would have lower crime.
[00:46:03.888 --> 00:46:11.635]  So, now obviously, the largest portion per capita, race-wise, are black males.
[00:46:12.356 --> 00:46:13.697]  And a lot of them are innocent.
[00:46:13.717 --> 00:46:15.378]  A lot of them are in there for petty reasons.
[00:46:16.159 --> 00:46:21.584]  A lot of them are, I mean, blacks, statistically, are treated different by the judicial system.
[00:46:22.585 --> 00:46:23.886]  They are treated different by police.
[00:46:24.834 --> 00:46:32.258]  And a lot of that is because it is acceptable to do that because it's well known that statistically they don't have as much money.
[00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:35.620]  Tony Brown has talked about this on this show.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.421]  He's done a lot of studies on it.
[00:46:38.001 --> 00:46:39.622]  And looked at some of the other studies.
[00:46:39.882 --> 00:46:42.824]  He's done several studies himself and looked at other studies, to say it properly.
[00:46:45.101 --> 00:46:51.285]  And all that happens is, poor areas is where the crime centers to begin with.
[00:46:51.686 --> 00:46:53.086]  It's where the whorehouses center.
[00:46:53.146 --> 00:46:55.248]  It's where the money laundering centers.
[00:46:55.308 --> 00:46:56.749]  It's where the drug production centers.
[00:46:57.689 --> 00:47:02.873]  Because that's where the establishment allowed it to center.
[00:47:03.413 --> 00:47:05.935]  It's like in The Godfather, which is based on a true story.
[00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:18.841]  When they're having the big commission meeting with all the top gangsters, and the racist mob boss says, keep the prostitution and the drugs and the gambling in the colored areas, they're animals, let them lose their souls.
[00:47:21.122 --> 00:47:27.527]  And so, that's where you stick the whorehouses, that's where you stick the crack dens, that's where it's acceptable, that's the zones.
[00:47:28.407 --> 00:47:30.008]  And now it's spilt out everywhere.
[00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:34.271]  So, that's a big part of it, folks.
[00:47:35.225 --> 00:47:44.167]  People, you know, racists like to point their finger at blacks and say, you know, they're just inferior because look at the crime in their areas.
[00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:55.549]  Well, they were drugged from areas that were not very civilized to begin with, that resembled Germania 2,000 years ago.
[00:47:55.569 --> 00:48:00.390]  Well, they were drugged in the last 500, 600 years to places all over the world, enslaved.
[00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:01.870]  Their leaders were killed.
[00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:04.452]  They weren't allowed to have any education.
[00:48:04.793 --> 00:48:09.183]  They were then put in modern plantations, modern reservations, the inner cities.
[00:48:12.302 --> 00:48:36.164]  and uh... systematically every crime base you can imagine was implanted and their community and the police in the private prisons i mean fifty years ago sixty years ago these big private prisons you know the good old boy uh... private prisons managed by the local government uh... warden but but but but privatizing their services i mean they needed some good black slaves again to go build the roads and cut the cotton
[00:48:37.085 --> 00:48:38.445]  Pick the cotton and do all of it.
[00:48:38.485 --> 00:48:39.946]  It's like Shawshank Redemption, folks.
[00:48:39.966 --> 00:48:41.986]  That's how the prisons really operate.
[00:48:42.947 --> 00:48:44.467]  And it's like Tulea, Texas.
[00:48:45.307 --> 00:48:53.090]  The local economy fell apart, so they just built the prison and all the local rich boys actually owned the prison and they needed some more people in the prison and the local factory.
[00:48:53.430 --> 00:49:00.812]  They just went out like it was a raiding party and just grabbed a dozen blacks here, 50 blacks there.
[00:49:01.658 --> 00:49:07.283]  Five blacks here, totally innocent, no drugs found, they'd go put them in the prison building and stuff.
[00:49:08.163 --> 00:49:08.904]  As slaves.
[00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:10.245]  So that is going on.
[00:49:10.665 --> 00:49:23.335]  But to just freak out and pull our hair out because Bennett says this, it shows the level of manipulation, the level of political correctness, the level of... They're training us to have this mindset so there can't be free speech.
[00:49:24.637 --> 00:49:27.699]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in New Mexico.
[00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:28.640]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.020]  Go ahead.
[00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:35.030]  22nd statement before the disagreement.
[00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.250]  The so-called authorities are terrorists.
[00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:59.274]  Non-government people are terrorized of police arresting and imprisoning them for disobeying all these actually unconstitutional laws more than they are terrorized by those fellow ordinary citizens with jobs and or savings that also own semi-automatic pistols or carbines.
[00:50:02.364 --> 00:50:08.566]  And, uh, what I disagreed with you about is the way you handle Kevin in Alabama when he calls in.
[00:50:10.706 --> 00:50:13.687]  The fella who said we need to get, uh, physical?
[00:50:14.788 --> 00:50:24.250]  Yeah, I think you should ask him first if he's serious or joking, because, like, when he said about Bohemian Grove, I was, like, laughing about that.
[00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.691]  I thought... No, he's serious!
[00:50:25.711 --> 00:50:29.592]  Okay, well, you know, I remember when Ronald Reagan
[00:50:30.316 --> 00:50:34.940]  You made that joke about something like the bombing is going to start tomorrow or something like that.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.620]  You remember that?
[00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:36.721]  Yeah, about Russia.
[00:50:37.542 --> 00:50:40.985]  Yeah, I mean, we should have equal protection under the law.
[00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:47.290]  Kevin isn't at an airport or something where he's going through the checkpoint at the airport where you can't make jokes.
[00:50:48.751 --> 00:50:50.833]  I think you should make it more clear.
[00:50:50.853 --> 00:50:53.055]  No, I understand.
[00:50:53.115 --> 00:50:56.077]  I think Reagan said the bombing starts in 20 minutes.
[00:50:56.918 --> 00:50:57.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:57.979]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.683]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:53:19.409 --> 00:53:20.010]  I think so.
[00:53:39.585 --> 00:53:41.186]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:53:41.246 --> 00:53:43.448]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.588 --> 00:54:13.689]  I want to go to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:54:14.409 --> 00:54:20.350]  You hadn't given us a report in a couple of weeks on what's happening there in the aftermath of Katrina and now Rita.
[00:54:21.111 --> 00:54:24.191]  But go ahead and finish up what you had to say there, Jeff, in New Mexico.
[00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:27.912]  Yeah, when I was on hold, I thought of another thing.
[00:54:28.973 --> 00:54:37.275]  You know, you said that you protest against the KKK at the same level you do as La Raza or some of these other things.
[00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:45.564]  But you know, the non-violent KKK might actually agree with the way you protect your family.
[00:54:46.244 --> 00:54:53.486]  Like you said, if you ever had to be evacuated, people better get out of your way or something like that.
[00:54:54.566 --> 00:54:57.907]  Isn't that the same as what Kevin was saying?
[00:54:58.667 --> 00:55:01.988]  He said you drive around a checkpoint, you better get out of your way.
[00:55:02.008 --> 00:55:03.388]  What does that have to do with the KKK?
[00:55:03.629 --> 00:55:05.269]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but listen to me.
[00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:10.023]  The KKK is a Luciferian organization.
[00:55:12.385 --> 00:55:15.068]  They are Knights of the Secret Circle.
[00:55:15.728 --> 00:55:17.250]  Knights of the Golden Circle.
[00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:21.474]  Now most KKK members don't even know that.
[00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:24.697]  It's pretty obvious, just the outfits.
[00:55:24.737 --> 00:55:25.658]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:55:25.678 --> 00:55:31.063]  You know, these wizard outfits and what they call themselves, Cyclopsian Rulers and Grand Dragons.
[00:55:32.688 --> 00:55:36.830]  But it's a Masonic Order founded by Albert Pike, Supreme Grand Mason.
[00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:43.732]  You never hear Jesse Jackson saying, take down the big Albert Pike statue right beside the Supreme Court building.
[00:55:44.112 --> 00:55:48.354]  Founder of the Klan, who wrote books, published them, saying, I am possessed by Lucifer.
[00:55:48.734 --> 00:55:50.435]  We Masons worship Lucifer.
[00:55:51.475 --> 00:55:56.256]  You know, you tell a mason, hey, why do you have a picture of Albert Pike up in your lodge?
[00:55:56.296 --> 00:55:57.716]  And they'll go, he was a great mason.
[00:55:58.036 --> 00:55:59.536]  Oh, have you read Morals and Dogma?
[00:55:59.616 --> 00:56:07.158]  No, I just go to this, we eat steaks and we learn little secret rituals that don't mean nothing.
[00:56:07.678 --> 00:56:11.559]  Oh, you've only progressed to the third degree, haven't you, Master Mason?
[00:56:11.899 --> 00:56:13.139]  Yep, I sure have.
[00:56:13.419 --> 00:56:15.439]  Well, you don't know anything, little boy.
[00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:18.480]  I know the degrees up to the 160th.
[00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:23.058]  You don't know anything, little boy!
[00:56:24.039 --> 00:56:25.800]  You think there's only 33rd Degrees.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.081]  You don't know anything!
[00:56:29.043 --> 00:56:31.104]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:56:31.144 --> 00:56:32.165]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:56:32.185 --> 00:56:33.486]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:56:33.546 --> 00:56:34.307]  Pretty good, my friend.
[00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:36.829]  Well, I just wanted to say a couple of things.
[00:56:37.729 --> 00:56:41.192]  Now, they're playing now this deal with the Superdome.
[00:56:41.592 --> 00:56:43.734]  They're saying there's only six bodies in there.
[00:56:43.754 --> 00:56:45.915]  There wasn't women, wasn't assaulted, and all that.
[00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:50.799]  Well, I know that's a lie, because I was up there when they were taking the people, you know, transferring them.
[00:56:51.294 --> 00:56:55.337]  And another thing is, we ran FEMA out of Liverston Parish.
[00:56:57.058 --> 00:57:03.222]  They wanted to put trailers here, and when we had 3,000 people in a Red Cross car, they said, well, you take care of it, we can't handle it.
[00:57:04.002 --> 00:57:07.705]  And now FEMA's giving money away hand and foot, Mr. Jones.
[00:57:08.265 --> 00:57:10.967]  I mean, people are fighting over this free money for nothing.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.541]  They're giving food stamps.
[00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:13.621]  They're giving that.
[00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:16.663]  These people haven't been hurt by the storm that much.
[00:57:17.023 --> 00:57:20.585]  Now Phoenix is giving them $300 for per person when they go to this place.
[00:57:20.965 --> 00:57:22.026]  I think it's at the courthouse.
[00:57:22.386 --> 00:57:24.467]  And people are actually camping out at night.
[00:57:24.687 --> 00:57:26.088]  Camping out to get this money.
[00:57:26.628 --> 00:57:32.831]  And I don't think it's fair because Phoenix is trying to buy us because we ran them out and they're giving us free money.
[00:57:32.911 --> 00:57:35.633]  People are just enjoying it and living a good life.
[00:57:36.952 --> 00:57:38.733]  No, that's exactly what FEMA does.
[00:57:38.773 --> 00:57:39.913]  They've done it in the past.
[00:57:39.953 --> 00:57:41.714]  They did the worst job they could.
[00:57:42.294 --> 00:57:43.815]  Caused things to break down.
[00:57:43.835 --> 00:57:50.657]  Then they call for an end to posse comitatus and for the military to occupy the United States of America.
[00:57:51.697 --> 00:57:57.700]  Then they come in and hand out a bunch of cash to locals and the government to get you trained to accept federal control.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:58.200]  Right.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:58.980]  Exactly.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.580]  Exactly.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.461]  That's exactly what's happening up there.
[00:58:01.889 --> 00:58:03.030]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.513]  I think that the American people, with their greed, they just have a curse on them.
[00:58:06.553 --> 00:58:07.354]  I really believe that.
[00:58:07.955 --> 00:58:16.522]  And another thing, as far as our military, after what I've seen, our military confiscating these guns and all that, Mr. Jones, I would never back up our military no more.
[00:58:16.742 --> 00:58:18.024]  If you like it or not, this is the truth.
[00:58:18.324 --> 00:58:19.265]  They are our enemies.
[00:58:20.709 --> 00:58:29.071]  Well, when our military, just like when the German military started following Hitler, when they start breaking the Constitution, they do become enemies of America.
[00:58:29.091 --> 00:58:32.993]  I mean, George Washington said that, and I stand with George Washington.
[00:58:33.473 --> 00:58:34.433]  Anything else, Charles?
[00:58:34.673 --> 00:58:35.053]  No, sir.
[00:58:35.133 --> 00:58:36.814]  I just want to thank you for what you're doing, sir.
[00:58:37.074 --> 00:58:38.014]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:58:38.374 --> 00:58:38.814]  Take care.
[00:58:38.894 --> 00:58:39.854]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.335 --> 00:58:45.996]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.421]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:00.142]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.842 --> 00:59:01.963]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.604 --> 00:59:03.444]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.185 --> 00:59:05.085]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.746 --> 00:59:09.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:14.091]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.251 --> 00:59:21.036]  All right, my friends, coming up in about five minutes, Tex Mars will be joining us.
[00:59:21.076 --> 00:59:22.697]  We're checking your calls right now.
[00:59:23.918 --> 00:59:24.699]  Later, we'll get into
[00:59:26.838 --> 00:59:32.942]  Israel's open discussions and statements about attacking Iran anytime now.
[00:59:34.684 --> 00:59:38.026]  Openly pushing us towards World War 3.
[00:59:39.087 --> 00:59:42.249]  More evidence comes out of British sponsored terrorism as well.
[00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:49.274]  And the BBC has the headline, Inside the secretive Bilderberg group.
[00:59:50.126 --> 00:59:52.307]  Probably the most disgusting article of them all.
[00:59:52.967 --> 00:59:56.628]  Torture of Iraqis was for stress relief, says U.S.
[00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:57.128]  soldiers.
[00:59:57.588 --> 00:59:59.829]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:05.491]  Up next is David and Mass, then Keith, Jarrett, and others.
[01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:06.671]  Go ahead, David.
[01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:08.311]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:08.872]  Good, my friend.
[01:00:10.172 --> 01:00:12.653]  A little bit of local Massachusetts news today.
[01:00:14.686 --> 01:00:15.167]  This is it.
[01:00:15.427 --> 01:00:17.988]  Cameras may catch red light runners in the act.
[01:00:18.028 --> 01:00:19.248]  Now listen to how clever this is.
[01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:23.010]  They're going to try to put it in the context of a safety issue.
[01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.451]  Let me just read this in a couple little small paragraphs.
[01:00:25.471 --> 01:00:34.835]  Red light runners in Boston and Cambridge could soon be handing over some green if the legislature let cities set up cameras at intersections to nab violators.
[01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:39.317]  The bill aired before the Joint Committee on Transportation last week would establish
[01:00:39.818 --> 01:00:45.621]  A citation-like parking ticket that would carry a fine of up to a hundred dollars for those caught on film.
[01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:55.086]  They tried to successfully push this in 86 and they couldn't do it but they said that now because they have a fresh new batch of lawmakers that they think it's going to pass.
[01:00:55.746 --> 01:01:03.290]  But let me tell you this Alex, the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association is totally against this.
[01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:05.551]  They say that only humans on the street
[01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:07.702]  It's only for revenue purposes.
[01:01:07.762 --> 01:01:08.682]  It's only for taxing.
[01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:10.423]  It's setting up the control grid.
[01:01:11.244 --> 01:01:19.828]  Sir, the federal and state courts have said that these cameras cannot give you tickets, and especially because in the case of San Diego,
[01:01:21.184 --> 01:01:27.609]  They caught Lockheed Martin running the system and shortening the old lights to make more money.
[01:01:27.669 --> 01:01:32.493]  I mean, to have, again, defense contractors running the cameras, running the systems.
[01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:38.498]  Literally, the defense contractors are seizing America through the government.
[01:01:38.558 --> 01:01:40.039]  And yes, it's totally illegal.
[01:01:40.519 --> 01:01:41.400]  You've got to stop it.
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:41.800]  Go ahead.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.701]  Absolutely.
[01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:45.023]  I mean, we're going to organize against this, Alex.
[01:01:45.043 --> 01:01:45.383]  Don't worry.
[01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:52.655]  And the bill, as drafted how it is now, would permit cameras on all of Boston and Cambridge Street at intersections.
[01:01:52.975 --> 01:02:00.502]  Well, some red light cameras at four-way stops can make upwards of $15 million a year.
[01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:07.229]  And the way they work is, if you roll six inches past the white line,
[01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:10.872]  The camera is always constantly taking pictures.
[01:02:11.393 --> 01:02:12.433]  And there's different types.
[01:02:12.453 --> 01:02:13.714]  Sometimes they have a motion sensor.
[01:02:13.754 --> 01:02:15.395]  Sometimes the camera is just rolling all the time.
[01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:19.056]  Sometimes it has a laser pointed at that certain point in the street.
[01:02:19.076 --> 01:02:20.157]  They malfunction a lot.
[01:02:21.318 --> 01:02:27.861]  But if you roll past that point, it snaps a picture and then still mails you the ticket.
[01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:33.972]  And then there's also been major problems where, you know, the judge doesn't like it because he gets caught with his mistress.
[01:02:34.413 --> 01:02:37.175]  You know, the black and white photo gets mailed to his house.
[01:02:37.696 --> 01:02:41.519]  There's a lot of problems with this, but on its face, it's Big Brother.
[01:02:41.539 --> 01:02:50.427]  But listen, here in Texas, they're going to have a transponder in every inspection sticker, and with radio readers, they're going to mail you tickets in the mail.
[01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:51.068]  This is in the bill.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:03:07.385]  Point to point, they will clock you according to the radio readers, and then just randomly mail you tickets, because you quote, we're going 8 miles over the speed limit, you know, 78 in a 70, and that'll get rid of police and their jobs as well, and that's the plan.
[01:03:07.685 --> 01:03:08.865]  They don't want people.
[01:03:09.346 --> 01:03:12.507]  Everything's going to be robotic within the next 15 years.
[01:03:13.027 --> 01:03:15.227]  That's exactly it, and they said in the 1996 experiment in Boston,
[01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:24.221]  They, uh, you know, they got an average, they snapped an average of like 30 violators a day at big, busy intersections.
[01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:24.961]  But yeah, you're right.
[01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.343]  It's totally controlled for taxation and tracking.
[01:03:28.423 --> 01:03:29.024]  There's no question.
[01:03:29.344 --> 01:03:33.087]  And when Lockheed got caught running these nationwide, they got sued over it.
[01:03:33.327 --> 01:03:35.428]  So they created a separate division.
[01:03:35.468 --> 01:03:36.769]  It's really still Lockheed.
[01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:41.872]  And, uh, so it's not so obvious that it's the defense contractors.
[01:03:42.233 --> 01:03:44.754]  Look folks, their job is taking over countries.
[01:03:45.175 --> 01:03:46.956]  They said, why don't we just take America over?
[01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:48.311]  And they're doing it!
[01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.872]  We're being occupied like Iraq!
[01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:57.795]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.995 --> 01:04:02.437]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.537 --> 01:04:06.919]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.979 --> 01:04:08.320]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:14.325]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.385 --> 01:04:21.311]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.451 --> 01:04:23.513]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.813 --> 01:04:24.774]  Homeland Security
[01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.055]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.906]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.266 --> 01:05:06.073]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.413 --> 01:05:11.077]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.557 --> 01:05:18.262]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:30.452]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.932 --> 01:05:35.394]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:35.554 --> 01:05:38.016]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.036 --> 01:05:39.856]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:41.157 --> 01:05:42.618]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:43.678]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.346 --> 01:05:55.707]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.948 --> 01:05:59.790]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:00.931]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.351 --> 01:06:05.493]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.693 --> 01:06:09.896]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:10.256 --> 01:06:15.139]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.519 --> 01:06:19.101]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:19.281 --> 01:06:24.623]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.903 --> 01:06:27.644]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:59.703]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.305 --> 01:07:08.269]  Most people that I've talked to are not aware of the fact that Tex Lars
[01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:18.291]  Was a multi-multi-multi best-selling author before he ever discovered the New World Order.
[01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:27.547]  And began writing best-selling books on the occult elite, the dark majesty system that they're building.
[01:07:27.748 --> 01:07:39.917]  And of course he is one of the, if not the, preeminent minds in studying all of this demonology and the occult systems and the interlocking pyramid structures of power.
[01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:42.899]  And Tex, in the last few years,
[01:07:44.401 --> 01:08:00.463]  Since Israeli bulldozers have run over innocent peace activists and carried out terror attacks and blamed it on their enemies, which has even been in the major British and Israeli papers, Texas has also been exposing the occult origins of the modern Zionist.
[01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:03.511]  So we'll talk about that some as well.
[01:08:03.791 --> 01:08:08.074]  But of course, he's an Air Force officer, Space and Aeronautics professor from UT.
[01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:09.375]  He is a pastor.
[01:08:09.876 --> 01:08:12.197]  And he married myself and my wife, of course.
[01:08:12.637 --> 01:08:13.558]  A good friend.
[01:08:13.978 --> 01:08:15.940]  Unfortunately, Texas is so busy.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.700]  I'm so busy.
[01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:20.323]  I haven't seen Texas in about a year since we went out and had dinner.
[01:08:20.923 --> 01:08:23.645]  My wife, Violet, and of course his lovely wife, Wanda.
[01:08:24.426 --> 01:08:27.068]  And he's got a new book coming out in about a month.
[01:08:27.568 --> 01:08:30.410]  You really need to mark your calendar to get it in a month.
[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.892]  And it's Codex Magicka.
[01:08:33.432 --> 01:08:36.975]  And by the way, Tex normally would write a book in a year or so, do a lot of research.
[01:08:37.395 --> 01:08:40.477]  I know Tex has been working on this for three or four years that I know of.
[01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.239]  And so we're really excited about that.
[01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.099]  He's got a lot of new stuff out right now.
[01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:47.580]  Videos and newsletters and CDs.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.041]  So we'll tell you how to get those.
[01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:50.822]  Have a pen and paper ready.
[01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:53.823]  But Tex, it's always a real blessing.
[01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.464]  I always learn something having you on, sir.
[01:08:57.244 --> 01:09:00.045]  Alex, it's great to be with you and your wonderful audience.
[01:09:00.065 --> 01:09:01.406]  You know, people who really care.
[01:09:02.686 --> 01:09:05.167]  And you know, you mentioned the occult world.
[01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:06.107]  You're absolutely right.
[01:09:06.147 --> 01:09:06.948]  That's where I started.
[01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:09.849]  Exposing the occult, the satanic,
[01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:11.381]  Secret societies.
[01:09:11.641 --> 01:09:28.307]  What I found out though, the amazing thing, I looked at it first from the religious aspect, but I found the money trail and the connections with the various organizations, you know, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, all of these various groups.
[01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:39.211]  It's just a huge hodgepodge of satanic activity and even the incursions, the horrible things going on in some of the
[01:09:40.772 --> 01:09:42.553]  Christian, so-called Christian areas.
[01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:54.218]  I found out, for example, that many of the top tele-evangelists were funded by the CIA and by various secret societies.
[01:09:54.798 --> 01:10:00.741]  So we have an incredible confrontation here of evil.
[01:10:01.301 --> 01:10:04.403]  And so, you know, the connections are so amazing.
[01:10:04.443 --> 01:10:05.323]  The network
[01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:07.029]  of evil.
[01:10:07.209 --> 01:10:15.272]  You cannot separate what's going on in the governmental field from the economics and the religious.
[01:10:15.452 --> 01:10:19.093]  It's a horrible, satanic conspiracy.
[01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:20.634]  Well, Tex, here's an example.
[01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:23.815]  It's been likened to pyramids and inside of pyramids.
[01:10:24.615 --> 01:10:26.576]  Or Russian dolls.
[01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:38.120]  For those who don't know what Russian dolls are, you know, there's the big doll, you pull one doll off, there's another smaller doll, and then down 20 levels to this teeny tiny little bitty doll the size of a pea.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.380]  Well, it's kind of the inverse of that.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:51.024]  You've got all these compartmentalized structures, pyramids, built into the pyramid right up to that very point of the pyramid, symbolized on the back of the dollar bill, the eye of Horace or Lucifer.
[01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:53.187]  And Tex, here's an example.
[01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:55.551]  You know, as these alchemists say...
[01:10:56.463 --> 01:11:17.107]  These dark magicians, as above, below, as below, above, the exact same stuff that goes on at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and other places is what we're seeing with the torture and rape and the sexual perversion in the torture at Abu Ghraib and Camp X-Ray.
[01:11:17.387 --> 01:11:19.268]  And then Rush Limbaugh knows that.
[01:11:19.648 --> 01:11:25.369]  He comes out and says, oh, the stuff going on in Abu Ghraib, that's just like Skull and Bones.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:37.286]  They're just blowing off steam, then the Pentagon comes out and says, yes, this is how we blow off steam, beating and raping people's children in front of them.
[01:11:37.546 --> 01:11:37.886]  Tex?
[01:11:38.807 --> 01:11:41.549]  Well, it's more than blowing off steam.
[01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:46.811]  We have a culture, an environment that's set up there from the top down.
[01:11:47.412 --> 01:11:51.234]  And what we're seeing, this poor little girl, Lindy England,
[01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:56.375]  I'm not saying that they should get off, but these are scapegoats.
[01:11:57.155 --> 01:12:02.258]  And all of these orders came down from the very top, from, you know, from Rumsfeld.
[01:12:02.658 --> 01:12:03.999]  Bush knew what was going on.
[01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:06.640]  We have Gonzales' own memo advising him to do it!
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:07.561]  Oh, of course.
[01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.342]  Everything has been planned, designed.
[01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:21.088]  But remember, what most people cannot understand, and I know you get letters blasting you, and I get them too, saying, we just don't understand George W. Bush is such a wonderful Christian man.
[01:12:22.014 --> 01:12:27.317]  But the fact is, these people have a mindset of evil.
[01:12:28.737 --> 01:12:44.165]  You know, I remember reading the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, who talked about, in the book First Lady of the World, he said the reason the site for the United Nations building there in New York, it was chosen
[01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:52.636]  Because there used to be, many years ago, remember by the way, the land was actually donated by the Rockefellers, or the United Nations.
[01:12:52.976 --> 01:13:01.882]  But he said the site was chosen because there had previously been a huge cattle slaughterhouse there.
[01:13:02.643 --> 01:13:08.987]  And he said tens of thousands of cattle were slain there, and then the meat went out throughout the East Coast.
[01:13:09.768 --> 01:13:10.929]  But he said the blood
[01:13:11.693 --> 01:13:15.716]  That went into the ground there, made that site sacred.
[01:13:16.897 --> 01:13:19.339]  So this is a religious ritual.
[01:13:19.419 --> 01:13:20.620]  It is a religious ritual.
[01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:28.947]  All Satanists believe that when you torture somebody, or especially when you kill them, it releases an energy force.
[01:13:30.408 --> 01:13:40.216]  You remember the monster who killed John Lennon, believed that in killing him, the satanic energy force then would come into him, and he would become famous.
[01:13:40.771 --> 01:13:43.033]  So, this is a satanic principle.
[01:13:44.054 --> 01:13:50.339]  Torture, human sacrifice, is made to endow yourself with power.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.543]  The energy of that person that you torture.
[01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.985]  So, it's more than just sadism.
[01:13:57.005 --> 01:13:59.507]  We're not talking about a Marquis de Sade thing.
[01:13:59.547 --> 01:14:02.930]  We're talking about a satanic principle.
[01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:09.015]  And then, of course, when you combine that with their overall reigning philosophy, Ordo of Chaos,
[01:14:09.525 --> 01:14:22.798]  They must have chaos, bloodshed and death in order that they can convince the people that we need more order, that we need security to make the people fearful.
[01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:30.346]  So all of these things, I have no doubt that most of the bombings and the killings in Iraq now are actually perpetrated
[01:14:30.928 --> 01:14:33.971]  By United States Intelligence and Israeli Mossad.
[01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:36.693]  Well, Tex, I'm sure you know the latest news.
[01:14:37.193 --> 01:14:40.136]  We've caught Israelis twice shooting and bombing Marines.
[01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:42.958]  The Marines catch them, beat them up, then are ordered to release them.
[01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.200]  They pull off the wigs and stuff, and it's Israelis.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:57.950]  And now, just a week and a half ago, they caught two British Special Forces troops in Basra, the city they control, running around shooting police dressed up like Arabs with a car full of explosives.
[01:14:58.911 --> 01:14:59.251]  Absolutely.
[01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:00.332]  You have two Brits there.
[01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:13.725]  And then, of course, to get those guys out, they bring tanks in, the British General there, and bash the General House down to take those guys out, because they didn't want them to talk, because they knew what was going on.
[01:15:13.845 --> 01:15:23.587]  Again, most of the terrorism in the world has been planned by the British intelligence, the American intelligence, and the Israeli Mossad working hand-in-glove.
[01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:26.068]  Often they also work, of course, with the Russians.
[01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:31.458]  So all of these things are planned to drive us ever moving forward.
[01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:35.157]  Uh, into this new age, uh, Ordo Op Caelum.
[01:15:35.317 --> 01:15:43.243]  Now, Tex, clearly, do, do, do you agree with many, uh, people who have shown the evidence that the Cold War, all of it, was completely staged?
[01:15:43.283 --> 01:15:57.134]  I mean, now they even have the old CIA section chief, a few years ago I saw him on the History Channel, go, yeah, we didn't like Chiang Kai-shek, we actually put Mao in, we like him, and then David Rockefeller, when Mao dies in 76, says, oh, we love Mao!
[01:15:57.614 --> 01:15:59.516]  So, uh, I mean, this whole thing's really staged.
[01:15:59.836 --> 01:16:00.016]  Sure.
[01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:03.218]  In my upcoming book, Codex Magic, you may have seen the picture before.
[01:16:03.238 --> 01:16:04.439]  It's been in just a few places.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:18.929]  When Mikhail Gorbachev, in 1985, during the dismantling of the old USSR, the failed system, Mikhail Gorbachev visited the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:16:19.349 --> 01:16:28.956]  They took him into that little museum-type area, and one of the very first issues of foreign affairs, you know, the CFR's official publication,
[01:16:29.591 --> 01:16:31.652]  They have it on display in a glass case.
[01:16:32.092 --> 01:16:36.033]  Now remember, the CFR is the bastion of capitalism.
[01:16:36.453 --> 01:16:47.035]  But there, what they have on display, and you can actually see it if you visit the Pratt House there, the CFR headquarters, is one of the first issues of Foreign Affairs dated 1921.
[01:16:47.575 --> 01:16:48.416]  Listen to this, Alex.
[01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:54.357]  It has the, in the margins, handwritten notes by Vladimir Lenin.
[01:16:55.023 --> 01:16:57.264]  He never missed an issue of the C.F.R.
[01:16:57.304 --> 01:16:57.985]  publication!
[01:16:58.345 --> 01:17:02.107]  It was like his guide, but it actually has the handwritten notes.
[01:17:02.207 --> 01:17:10.691]  And what you'll see in this picture is Gorbachev putting his hand forth in what is called the Masonic sign of admiration.
[01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:19.535]  He puts his hand forth and touches the glass case as if he's actually worshipping this C.F.R.
[01:17:19.595 --> 01:17:24.598]  journal, 1921, with Vladimir Lenin's own personal handwritten notes on the margins.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.761]  He's actually worshipping it as a sacred document, as if it were some kind of a Bible.
[01:17:30.102 --> 01:17:34.903]  What is Pat Robertson doing on that Time Magazine cover with his fingers bent in under?
[01:17:34.943 --> 01:17:37.264]  What does the lion's paw mean?
[01:17:37.304 --> 01:17:40.305]  This is actually... That is not actually the lion's paw.
[01:17:40.325 --> 01:17:41.745]  That's the second degree.
[01:17:42.085 --> 01:17:43.126]  That has a special meaning.
[01:17:43.186 --> 01:17:49.207]  It's the... It's the craft sign of the approved oppressed.
[01:17:49.808 --> 01:17:54.169]  What it basically means is that he is a leader of the common people.
[01:17:55.746 --> 01:18:05.148]  So, what they have done, of course, from the very beginning, you know, he flunked out of law school, Pat Robertson, wanted to be an attorney, went to Yale, just like all the other boys did, but he flunked out.
[01:18:05.728 --> 01:18:12.309]  Now, J. Peter Grace of the Knights of Malta, one of the other secret societies, took him on to be an understudy in Brazil.
[01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:14.089]  You've heard about the boys from Brazil.
[01:18:14.509 --> 01:18:21.170]  He was brought back, and it was decided, of all things, that he would go off into the religious area.
[01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:24.391]  But make no mistake about it.
[01:18:25.012 --> 01:18:32.375]  His very first television station was given to him for one dollar by none other than Ted Turner.
[01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:33.456]  One dollar!
[01:18:33.676 --> 01:18:35.637]  How would you like to buy a TV station for a dollar?
[01:18:36.477 --> 01:18:37.578]  Sounds like a good deal!
[01:18:38.258 --> 01:18:38.858]  Absolutely!
[01:18:38.878 --> 01:18:42.000]  And by the way, Channel 33 in Dallas.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.142]  Channel 33 was given to him in a sweetheart deal.
[01:18:46.302 --> 01:18:47.802]  And they believe in foundations.
[01:18:47.862 --> 01:18:49.943]  The numbers have to be right when they start something.
[01:18:50.303 --> 01:18:51.364]  We'll be right back with Tex Moore.
[01:18:54.528 --> 01:18:56.873]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Red Book.

[01:20:03.878 --> 01:20:15.102]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:20:15.423 --> 01:20:21.145]  Nitrates, Nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are no problem.
[01:20:21.385 --> 01:20:28.028]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:28.268 --> 01:20:35.071]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:35.351 --> 01:20:37.112]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[01:20:37.372 --> 01:20:39.432]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:56.199]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:03.503]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:21:04.683 --> 01:21:06.984]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:21:07.784 --> 01:21:13.927]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:21:14.915 --> 01:21:23.041]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:31.887]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.748 --> 01:21:34.289]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.309 --> 01:21:34.669]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:42.403]  516-8736.
[01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:43.104]  Call now.
[01:21:43.224 --> 01:21:47.229]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:58.573]  Folks, a massive fraud has been deceiving many millions of good people for decades.
[01:21:59.053 --> 01:22:05.175]  The lie we have been sold by the so-called health food industry is that taking vitamins will make us healthy.
[01:22:05.555 --> 01:22:11.418]  They tell us our dietary habits are so poor we can't possibly get adequate nutrition from mere food.
[01:22:11.918 --> 01:22:16.760]  And though it's true we may not always eat right, God did not create a vitamin tree.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:23.422]  Consuming isolated or synthetic nutrients will never give you total health and in some cases can actually
[01:22:23.422 --> 01:22:24.243]  We're good to go.
[01:22:55.663 --> 01:22:58.025]  Alright folks, let's jump right back in.
[01:22:58.085 --> 01:22:59.686]  Alex Jones here live, your host.
[01:23:00.787 --> 01:23:09.154]  We're talking to Professor Tex Mars, Pastor Tex Mars, Author Tex Mars, good friend of mine Tex Mars, from right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:15.159]  And there are a lot of Masons listening right now who are what the Illuminati call Porch Masons.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.864]  And you're in the first three degrees, most of you, or you certainly never get up to the 33rd degree.
[01:23:23.474 --> 01:23:28.320]  Uh, where you really become a Mason, and then of course there are a bunch of degrees after that.
[01:23:29.641 --> 01:23:33.506]  And, you know, you hear us talking about how you worship Lucifer and how it's a cult.
[01:23:34.026 --> 01:23:35.608]  We didn't pull this out of a hat.
[01:23:35.808 --> 01:23:41.575]  I mean, there are people like Albert Pike and many others who were Supreme Grand Masons who wrote published books.
[01:23:42.553 --> 01:23:46.114]  Where they said, we have Lucifer possessing us, Lucifer in our hands.
[01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:53.575]  But Tex, you were telling me about another top Mason and his books that are in bookstores right now, who Masons basically worship.
[01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:54.975]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:23:54.995 --> 01:23:59.876]  In an issue of Scottish Rite Journal, R.W.
[01:24:00.016 --> 01:24:10.838]  Ledbetter, who's the 33rd Degree Mason, and was also involved with the O.T.O., the Ordo Templi Orientis, which is one of the more satanic Masonic organizations,
[01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:16.611]  That even calls itself the Illuminati, by the way, was sort of fascinating.
[01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:30.995]  But Ledbetter states in his book, Mystic Masonry, that at the 33rd degree, when you receive your 33rd degree, that Lucifer himself actually is the present.
[01:24:31.495 --> 01:24:32.276]  He's present!
[01:24:33.356 --> 01:24:35.216]  And literally possesses the person.
[01:24:35.497 --> 01:24:40.818]  And he describes him, and I can't remember the whole description, but he said he's a huge, beautiful creature,
[01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:49.635]  Who just suddenly appears out of the mist inside the sanctuary of Freemasonry.
[01:24:50.076 --> 01:24:53.297]  And by the way, they called it the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.
[01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:58.060]  And there's a huge, I have a picture of it in my upcoming book, a huge black altar.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:05.784]  And behind it, you will see in the book, there are two huge phoenix serpents facing each other.
[01:25:07.162 --> 01:25:18.629]  And so people bow at that altar, they drink from a human skull, wine from a human skull, but he says Lucifer actually makes an appearance at the 33rd degree ritual.
[01:25:18.729 --> 01:25:27.714]  And for those who don't know, the owners of HEB are into this, most of your big supposed Christian leaders, and they're all there telling you the war is good.
[01:25:27.754 --> 01:25:34.698]  They're saying we have to build the temple so Jesus can come back into it when Revelation says the Antichrist is going to do that.
[01:25:36.537 --> 01:25:37.638]  I'm no Bible scholar!
[01:25:37.678 --> 01:25:39.698]  This is all obvious to a two-year-old!
[01:25:39.939 --> 01:25:43.780]  How are hundreds of millions of Christians totally deceived by this?
[01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:54.045]  One of the ways they're deceived by it is the Zionist philosophy, which goes far deeper than just who gets the land over in the Middle East.
[01:25:54.565 --> 01:26:03.469]  The average Jewish person has no idea that there is a Grand Lodge of Jerusalem, a Grand Lodge of
[01:26:04.313 --> 01:26:04.693]  Israel.
[01:26:05.033 --> 01:26:15.917]  And by the way, I have full documentation that the Grand Lodge of Jerusalem meets periodically deep under the earth where they believe the temple used to be.
[01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:27.641]  They go in the cave of Zedekiah and if you go deep in those tunnels there you will actually find a room that's closed off, has a bronze plaque on it that says the Grand Lodge of Jerusalem meets here!
[01:26:28.467 --> 01:26:32.649]  And I have pictures of that bronze plaque on this strange door.
[01:26:32.809 --> 01:26:35.491]  Well, also they've built, expanded on the Knesset.
[01:26:35.531 --> 01:26:39.092]  Their Supreme Court has a giant, all-seeing-gold eye over it.
[01:26:39.633 --> 01:26:49.357]  Yes, because in Hebrew University, for example, that is funded in Maine by the Rothschilds, they have erected a huge Egyptian obelisk.
[01:26:49.678 --> 01:26:53.039]  Now, notice, this is not the Old Testament religion.
[01:26:53.059 --> 01:26:56.601]  Remember, even God told them to come out of Egypt, right?
[01:26:57.153 --> 01:27:01.255]  He told his people the Israelites come out of Egypt, but many didn't.
[01:27:01.695 --> 01:27:12.539]  And throughout history, these apostate Jews, so-called, have sought to bring the Israeli people back under subjection to the Egyptian gods.
[01:27:13.894 --> 01:27:21.502]  Sorry, that's the same crowd that when Moses comes down off the mount, they got the golden calf and they're all dancing around naked, and then God smites them.
[01:27:22.944 --> 01:27:26.988]  So again, people argue, no, it's Kabbalah mysticism, no, it's Egyptian.
[01:27:27.289 --> 01:27:29.011]  It all goes back to Egypt, doesn't it, Tex?
[01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:30.232]  Well, it does.
[01:27:30.272 --> 01:27:36.957]  Of course, if you go to the House of the Temple, which is exactly, supernaturally, thirteen blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C.
[01:27:37.398 --> 01:27:57.155]  And by the way, the House of the Temple, the international headquarters for the Scottish Rite, the largest rite of Freemasonry, it is actually built on the model, they say, to within one-eighth of an inch architecturally, to the Hele Karnassus over in, well, it's actually in Turkey today,
[01:27:57.802 --> 01:27:59.622]  But it was a huge mausoleum.
[01:28:00.723 --> 01:28:08.184]  In fact, King Mausolus, the king died and that's why we now have the name mausoleum.
[01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:12.225]  But imagine, it's like the place of the dead.
[01:28:12.905 --> 01:28:17.106]  And you mention Albert Pike, Sovereign Grand Commander back in the 19th century.
[01:28:17.627 --> 01:28:23.448]  His tomb, his bones are interred at the house of the temple, this tomb in Washington, D.C.
[01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:27.192]  But Jesse Jackson doesn't talk about that, does he?
[01:28:27.392 --> 01:28:29.272]  Well, he's a 33rd degree mason, too.
[01:28:30.192 --> 01:28:34.473]  So there's a connection there amongst all of these elites.
[01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:41.995]  That's right, folks, and they all conspire against us, including their lowly masons, who they look at as cattle as well.
[01:28:43.715 --> 01:28:44.656]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.116 --> 01:28:46.736]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.636 --> 01:28:50.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.125 --> 01:28:58.008]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:28:58.148 --> 01:28:59.889]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:28:59.969 --> 01:29:01.230]  But not just any water.
[01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:05.514]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:29:05.594 --> 01:29:15.281]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.

[01:29:45.665 --> 01:29:46.065]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:29:53.999 --> 01:29:55.980]  You've asked for them, and now they're here!
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:06.765]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.145 --> 01:30:11.667]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.747 --> 01:30:23.073]  When used, water flows through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.653 --> 01:30:30.496]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.896 --> 01:30:33.036]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.537 --> 01:30:38.518]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[01:30:46.161 --> 01:30:56.423]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:30:56.483 --> 01:30:59.363]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:30:59.563 --> 01:31:04.944]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:31:05.185 --> 01:31:06.685]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:31:06.745 --> 01:31:08.985]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:31:09.165 --> 01:31:12.726]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:31:13.066 --> 01:31:13.466]  I think so.
[01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:36.048]  Thank you.
[01:32:10.282 --> 01:32:13.203]  Our caller in England, Greg.
[01:32:13.503 --> 01:32:15.084]  Everybody, we'll get to you here in a few minutes.
[01:32:15.464 --> 01:32:18.345]  We got Tex Mars riding his shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:32:18.405 --> 01:32:20.245]  Always great to have him on.
[01:32:20.265 --> 01:32:21.246]  Always very enlightening.
[01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:22.786]  And he really does his research.
[01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:25.307]  When Tex reports on it, you can bet on it.
[01:32:25.367 --> 01:32:26.967]  I mean, he's exhaustive.
[01:32:27.928 --> 01:32:31.589]  Very scholarly, unfortunately, a lot of other people aren't.
[01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:41.120]  In fact, you know, I'm not even the best sometimes, but Tex really tries to cross all of his T's and dot all of his I's.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.287]  Before we go back to Tex, my new film, Martial Law, is out, and it's my best work, and really, it's a mini-series.
[01:32:47.387 --> 01:32:48.889]  Three one-hour videos.
[01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:52.053]  It is three hours long, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:52.828 --> 01:33:03.431]  The first hour covers the police state, the latest sound wave weapons, the surveillance blimps, the police threatening to arrest us over and over again here in this supposed free country for simply reporting.
[01:33:04.091 --> 01:33:12.613]  Then we spend a whole hour on how the globalists carried out 9-11, detailing how they did it, what their motives were, and then a full hour on the order of death.
[01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:30.819]  The modern Illuminati through Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and our confrontation with David Gergen, the White House Presidential Advisor, the Karl Rove of four administrations, into Schwarzenegger and just a wide panoramic view of what their goals are and who we're facing.
[01:33:31.059 --> 01:33:36.262]  Really the architecture of this key pillar inside these secret societies, because there are other pillars.
[01:33:37.643 --> 01:33:38.945]  I hope you'll get Marshall Law.
[01:33:38.965 --> 01:33:43.150]  I also hope you'll get our film, American Dictators, exposing the false left-right paradigm.
[01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:47.014]  George Bush and John Kerry and the staged election of 2004.
[01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:50.238]  A great film to wake up people on the false left-right system.
[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:52.911]  And then just so many other books and videos.
[01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:55.632]  We carry some of Texas great books and videos.
[01:33:56.053 --> 01:34:00.175]  Just peruse the Safe Secure Shopping Cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:00.435 --> 01:34:03.016]  That's I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S dot com.

[01:34:33.301 --> 01:34:34.661]  Archived video reports.
[01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:39.382]  I'm pulling some of my best TV shows of the last five years and posting them on the site.
[01:34:39.722 --> 01:34:41.103]  Posted two of those last week.
[01:34:41.563 --> 01:34:43.183]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:43.523 --> 01:34:52.005]  Fifteen cents a day to sign up and to get a monthly or yearly membership and that makes all of our web activities possible.
[01:34:52.505 --> 01:34:54.625]  And that is frankly the biggest part of our outreach.
[01:34:54.645 --> 01:34:56.106]  We are having a massive effect there.
[01:34:56.686 --> 01:34:57.166]  Thank God.
[01:34:58.152 --> 01:35:01.475]  I'm thanking you out there for taking action and getting involved.
[01:35:01.876 --> 01:35:04.038]  Without you folks, we're going nowhere in this fight.
[01:35:04.178 --> 01:35:05.159]  You have the power.
[01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:07.336]  Now, going back to Tex Marsh.
[01:35:07.396 --> 01:35:10.157]  Tex, your classic circle of intrigue.
[01:35:10.197 --> 01:35:11.117]  Everybody should have it.
[01:35:11.517 --> 01:35:17.219]  Also, you offer just wonderful newsletters jam-packed with information.
[01:35:17.519 --> 01:35:19.119]  These are handsome newsletters.
[01:35:19.539 --> 01:35:20.520]  I mean, really nice.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:29.162]  And when I did a newsletter for a short time, I modeled mine after yours because it was the best packaging I'd seen out there and the best information.
[01:35:29.722 --> 01:35:34.923]  How do folks get a circle of intrigue book, or how do they get your newsletter?
[01:35:35.658 --> 01:35:38.559]  Well, Alex, we'll be glad to give people a free copy of our newsletter.
[01:35:38.879 --> 01:35:44.961]  You know, we never call people and try to get them to buy anything, but they will see our various books in there.
[01:35:45.761 --> 01:35:53.784]  But if folks want a free, absolutely free copy of our newsletter, it's called Power of Prophecy, all they need to do is call us our toll-free number, 1-800-234-9673.
[01:35:53.804 --> 01:35:53.864]  1-800-234-9673.
[01:35:53.884 --> 01:35:56.464]  And say, hey, send me that free newsletter.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.281]  We'll also make sure they get our special edition of this Codex Magica.
[01:36:10.041 --> 01:36:11.741]  I'll tell a bit about my upcoming book.
[01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:17.903]  It's going to be over 600 pages, Alex, large format, over 1,000 pictures.
[01:36:19.003 --> 01:36:20.403]  It's an amazing book.
[01:36:21.603 --> 01:36:29.285]  It's an expose of the secret signs, hand signs, body signs, mysterious symbols, and the hidden codes
[01:36:30.006 --> 01:36:31.467]  and language of the Illuminati.
[01:36:31.847 --> 01:36:35.690]  You'll see them giving all kind of secret signs in plain sight.
[01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:43.775]  They send messages over TV and magazines, secret messages to each other.
[01:36:44.616 --> 01:36:45.356]  Why do they do it?
[01:36:45.416 --> 01:36:58.085]  Well of course we have cryptographic equipment, modern communications, but this is a satanic ritual that's being conducted and they believe this gives them special powers
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:04.882]  And they especially love to mock and ridicule people like us.
[01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:09.883]  They call us vulgar, profane, ignorant masses.
[01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:10.904]  Barbarians.
[01:37:11.244 --> 01:37:13.304]  Yeah, we're the useless eaters.
[01:37:13.885 --> 01:37:20.887]  So they love to actually conduct satanic rituals in plain sight on TV.
[01:37:21.527 --> 01:37:26.549]  And they use various languages, symbols, logos, emblems.
[01:37:26.689 --> 01:37:27.829]  It's just an amazing
[01:37:28.771 --> 01:37:29.552]  But hey, they're caught.
[01:37:29.672 --> 01:37:33.916]  Over 1,000 pictures, and I explain what each hand sign means.
[01:37:34.596 --> 01:37:39.500]  Whether it's Bill Clinton or George Bush or Vladimir Putin, you'll see all of these people exposed.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.281]  Oh, that's the thing.
[01:37:40.901 --> 01:37:50.789]  Bush is constantly flashing the Diablo, and in Europe, everybody saw the Song of the Devil and Gasp, and then they said, oh, that's just for the UT band.
[01:37:51.269 --> 01:37:53.831]  Well, folks, the point is, why do we have Putin doing it?
[01:37:53.891 --> 01:37:55.773]  Why do we have Bersoloni doing it of Italy?
[01:37:56.193 --> 01:37:57.874]  Why don't we have the Queen of England doing it?
[01:37:57.914 --> 01:37:59.415]  Why don't we have Prince Charles doing it?
[01:37:59.435 --> 01:38:00.876]  Why don't we have Prince Harry doing it?
[01:38:01.236 --> 01:38:04.598]  Why don't we have, you know, Vicente Fox doing it?
[01:38:04.658 --> 01:38:06.619]  Why don't we have General Tommy Franks doing it?
[01:38:06.999 --> 01:38:09.260]  Why don't we have Mikhail Gorbachev doing it?
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.641]  Why don't we have Bill Clinton doing it?
[01:38:10.841 --> 01:38:12.302]  Why don't we have Hillary Clinton doing it?
[01:38:12.482 --> 01:38:14.623]  You know, are they all fans of UT?
[01:38:14.643 --> 01:38:18.805]  University of Texas has a big fan base, doesn't it, Alex?
[01:38:19.366 --> 01:38:25.349]  But you know, it's not only that, you mentioned the clenched fist that's sort of like the salute.
[01:38:26.111 --> 01:38:28.373]  Across the chest, on the heart.
[01:38:29.094 --> 01:38:38.782]  And you mentioned that Time Magazine actually had, when he was running for President, Pat Robertson, the televangelist, giving that Masonic sign.
[01:38:39.102 --> 01:38:40.644]  What is it?
[01:38:40.744 --> 01:38:44.807]  What it is, is a sign, it's called the Dugard, and it's the penalty sign.
[01:38:44.847 --> 01:38:53.575]  What it means is, if I divulge the secrets of the Order, may my chest be torn open.
[01:38:54.947 --> 01:38:58.368]  And my heart exposed to the elements.
[01:38:58.448 --> 01:39:05.410]  So this is really, you know, a very heinous oath that they have taken, and it's a sign of the oath that they have taken.
[01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:21.014]  So there are many signs such as that, various hand signs, and if you watch these people on TV, you think their hands just happen to be in that shape, but what I do is I have all of the Masonic manuals, and I show the sign
[01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:28.277]  Exactly as the Masons themselves, or not only that, the Rosicrucians, the O.T.O., the various secret societies.
[01:39:28.297 --> 01:39:29.258]  Well, here's an example.
[01:39:29.518 --> 01:39:33.304]  For those that aren't getting this, there's this professor
[01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:35.062]  I forget his name.
[01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:41.746]  He attacked me on C-SPAN for an hour and a half with Brian Lamb the day after I went on Coast to Coast AM and exposed Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:42.126 --> 01:39:46.129]  And he went on and he had his fingers so twisted around and so templed.
[01:39:46.529 --> 01:39:53.033]  And then I looked in books and those were really complex symbols that he was flashing at the screen.
[01:39:53.854 --> 01:40:02.880]  What he was trying to do, no doubt, was to invoke deities, in other words, devils, to give him extra powers in his debate with you.
[01:40:03.821 --> 01:40:30.804]  I remember I did a live program down in Miami on a radio talk show, one of those popular talk shows, and I was debating an occultist, and she had an assistant, it was a woman, she had an assistant with her, and he had a satanic medallion around his neck, and he was mouthing some little, you know, ditty, some little spell, and he was trying to shine the light from that bronze-like disc into my eye,
[01:40:32.186 --> 01:40:36.553]  Asking his satanic powers to help confuse and confound me.
[01:40:37.014 --> 01:40:40.039]  So these are, to us, these are silly things.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:41.081]  They're idiotic.
[01:40:42.797 --> 01:40:54.725]  But to these people, being Satanists, everything they do is based on number and ritual, colors... It's very obsessive-compulsive, isn't it?
[01:40:55.265 --> 01:40:56.886]  Well, it is obsessive-compulsive.
[01:40:57.527 --> 01:40:58.888]  Remember there were little hints of this.
[01:40:58.948 --> 01:41:06.733]  They mentioned way back in the era of senior George Bush, they said that he was an expert on sign language.
[01:41:07.782 --> 01:41:18.545]  But when he was over in Australia, he gave the people, he was mad because they were riding and pelting his car, his limo, with tomatoes.
[01:41:19.066 --> 01:41:20.766]  And he gave them the OK sign.
[01:41:21.566 --> 01:41:24.987]  But over in Australia, that is a sign that basically means nephew.
[01:41:26.308 --> 01:41:30.069]  Because it is the, you know, the circle is the woman's organ.
[01:41:30.609 --> 01:41:36.051]  And then, you know, so again, in every culture these signs mean different things.
[01:41:37.472 --> 01:41:40.274]  And he knew that, and he was just basically saying, F you.
[01:41:41.435 --> 01:41:43.396]  Which is understandable now.
[01:41:43.436 --> 01:41:45.517]  I think Dick Cheney says it a lot now, doesn't he?
[01:41:46.578 --> 01:41:47.939]  Well, he certainly does.
[01:41:48.379 --> 01:41:52.021]  He said it to Senator Leahy on the floor of the Senate.
[01:41:52.041 --> 01:41:56.104]  Well, we have video of the President flipping off the camera crew.
[01:41:57.085 --> 01:41:57.465]  That's right.
[01:41:57.485 --> 01:41:59.146]  I have that in my newest newsletter, by the way.
[01:41:59.166 --> 01:42:00.807]  George W. Bush shooting the finger.
[01:42:03.876 --> 01:42:05.236]  These people are satanists.
[01:42:05.297 --> 01:42:06.637]  They're vulgar people.
[01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:34.771]  Which is a very evil book.
[01:42:35.071 --> 01:42:37.233]  Again, this is not Old Testament stuff at all.
[01:42:37.834 --> 01:42:39.915]  This is not what the Israelites did.
[01:42:40.376 --> 01:43:01.433]  So, we have a modern, Kabbalistic Talmud mindset, which believes, you know, in their Kol Nidre, they basically, at the beginning of the year, the Kabbalists make a... they ask God to overlook all of the promises and commitments they make during the coming year.
[01:43:02.406 --> 01:43:13.113]  Therefore, they have made the Cole McNeidray Oath, which says that if they tell you, you know, make a business deal with you, and then they squelch on it and cheat you, it's okay.
[01:43:13.893 --> 01:43:17.676]  Because everything has been null and voided at the first of the year.
[01:43:17.996 --> 01:43:19.917]  So all of these things we cannot understand them.
[01:43:20.137 --> 01:43:21.078]  But yes, this is true.
[01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:28.603]  Here's another reason why many of the things from the JFK assassination and on, they later will actually
[01:43:29.321 --> 01:43:32.644]  Show you, they will reveal to you what they did.
[01:43:33.464 --> 01:43:37.107]  And then if you do nothing about it, they are absolved.
[01:43:37.388 --> 01:43:39.829]  Well, Tex, I mean, it's more than just a trial balloon.
[01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:54.021]  For those that want a further example of this, there's literally a million of them, they had a Philips TV commercial where F-16s bomb the World Trade Center, it flashes, and they say, Philips, changing your world.
[01:43:54.681 --> 01:43:56.763]  And there's about ten other examples, but one of the best
[01:43:57.484 --> 01:43:59.747]  Uh, is six months before 9-11.
[01:43:59.947 --> 01:44:10.881]  It was written and then produced, the Lone Gunman episode of the X-Files, where a secret group in the government runs an anti-terror drill
[01:44:11.869 --> 01:44:25.217]  And to confuse the rest of the government so that they stand down, they tell them it's a drill, then they try to fly a jumbo jet by remote control into the World Trade Center as a pretext to invade Afghanistan.
[01:44:25.517 --> 01:44:29.359]  Now, not only did they say the government, a secret group is going to fly a plane into the building,
[01:44:29.959 --> 01:44:39.282]  Uh, to invade Afghanistan, they said they're gonna use a drill to smoke screen it, and then the exact thing happens six months later.
[01:44:39.502 --> 01:44:47.865]  Then, a sweaty X-Files star, Dean Haglund, one of the chief stars, shows up at my door, going, I just want to talk to you, I want to talk to you.
[01:44:48.005 --> 01:44:50.626]  And he goes, listen, the CIA came and planted that story on us.
[01:44:50.646 --> 01:44:57.389]  And he said most of that on tape, wouldn't say it all on tape, he said some of it on this radio show too, and I interviewed him and have that video and put it on the web.
[01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:58.409]  What do you think of that, Tex?
[01:44:59.149 --> 01:45:01.190]  Well, I can believe that exactly.
[01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:04.390]  And I remember that episode you're talking about, reading about that.
[01:45:05.711 --> 01:45:13.773]  Here again, if they tell you what they're going to do, and you do nothing to prevent it, it gives them great occult power.
[01:45:14.473 --> 01:45:15.353]  It's a ritual.
[01:45:15.913 --> 01:45:18.334]  Isn't that what Counting Coup is with the Native Americans?
[01:45:18.514 --> 01:45:21.414]  Where before they kill you, they would do simulated blows of killing you?
[01:45:21.634 --> 01:45:22.655]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:45:23.215 --> 01:45:24.615]  All of these are satanic rituals.
[01:45:24.695 --> 01:45:25.675]  It's grand theater.
[01:45:26.135 --> 01:45:27.236]  Psycho drama.
[01:45:27.776 --> 01:45:28.296]  That's done.
[01:45:29.548 --> 01:45:41.294]  And again, if the person participates in the ritual, the victim, by not taking overt action to prevent it, then they are responsible for their own death.
[01:45:42.154 --> 01:45:44.916]  And you are absolved of guilt.
[01:45:44.956 --> 01:45:47.917]  Of course, this is very evil, insane.
[01:45:48.237 --> 01:45:53.780]  We cannot fathom the mind of these occultists, these satanic people.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.401]  But everything is done according to ritual.
[01:45:57.318 --> 01:45:59.820]  You remember, even the buildings in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:04.743]  are dedicated to devils through Masonic cornerstone ceremonies.
[01:46:04.763 --> 01:46:11.908]  Well, they're openly, all of them, all of them, folks, are built as exact models and replicas of other famous occult facilities.
[01:46:12.969 --> 01:46:13.489]  They are indeed.
[01:46:13.509 --> 01:46:16.171]  The obelisk, of course, built exactly 555 feet high.
[01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:21.555]  Uh, and everything in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:21.615 --> 01:46:22.856]  is designed in this way.
[01:46:23.016 --> 01:46:31.183]  Well, the capitals are breast, the, uh, the, the, the steeples of the male member, uh... They are.
[01:46:31.223 --> 01:46:35.747]  The great goddess, of course, sits on top of the capital dome, which is her breast.
[01:46:35.807 --> 01:46:38.149]  There she is, the warrior goddess, Athena.
[01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:41.833]  And by the way, her sacred, her sacred bird was the owl.
[01:46:43.132 --> 01:46:51.598]  And in your new upcoming video, you've already got it, but I know you're revising, it's going to be tremendous, on the dark secrets of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:51.858 --> 01:46:54.599]  Now you'll see why the owl was chosen.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.721]  It is the sacred bird of Athena.
[01:46:57.761 --> 01:47:00.023]  By the way, we know... At the top of our Capitol building.
[01:47:00.283 --> 01:47:03.985]  Skull and Bones worships Eulogia, the goddess.
[01:47:04.186 --> 01:47:07.368]  We now found at the Grove that they worship Diana.
[01:47:08.508 --> 01:47:09.309]  Well, that makes sense.
[01:47:09.329 --> 01:47:12.351]  You know, the Apostle Paul, in the book of Acts,
[01:47:13.027 --> 01:47:22.317]  Call Diana, you remember he went to visit Ephesus in Greece, and there they worshipped Diana, who is basically the witchcraft goddess.
[01:47:22.678 --> 01:47:29.846]  But Paul said, this is in the Bible now, Paul called Diana, the goddess whom all the world worshipeth.
[01:47:30.484 --> 01:47:38.187]  Now, she was worshipped in a thousand names, you know, as Aphrodite, as Venus, as Isis in Egypt, and Semiramis in Babylon.
[01:47:38.508 --> 01:47:42.069]  But she was the goddess, Diana, whom all the world worshipped.
[01:47:42.089 --> 01:47:43.510]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:52.334]  On top of every Islamic mosque, you will see the crescent moon and the star of Diana, the witchcraft goddess.
[01:47:52.754 --> 01:47:59.337]  And yet, I've talked to many Muslims who say that one of the things they hate most of all is idols.
[01:48:00.003 --> 01:48:05.307]  And I ask them why they have the idol of Diana, the witchcraft goddess, and they are perplexed!
[01:48:05.847 --> 01:48:12.131]  Many of them have gone to their Imams and written me back and say, even my Imam doesn't know what that stands for.
[01:48:12.972 --> 01:48:16.534]  But of course, if you go back into history, you know, you will find out what it stands for.
[01:48:16.915 --> 01:48:25.881]  Just as the black stone that they kiss and worship in the Kaaba at Mecca, you know, they make a at least once-a-lifetime pilgrimage there, Alex.
[01:48:26.593 --> 01:48:37.060]  That stone was the remains of a falling star that fell to Earth, and they believed it was from the goddess Venus, who really was Diana.
[01:48:37.481 --> 01:48:39.302]  And thus, that's why... Well, that's another thing.
[01:48:40.121 --> 01:48:41.262]  People always get confused.
[01:48:41.302 --> 01:48:42.903]  They go, is it the Bilderberg Group?
[01:48:42.943 --> 01:48:44.004]  Is it the CFR?
[01:48:44.044 --> 01:48:45.224]  Is it the Bohemian Grove?
[01:48:45.525 --> 01:48:46.405]  Is it Diana?
[01:48:46.625 --> 01:48:47.746]  Or is it Moloch?
[01:48:48.467 --> 01:48:50.828]  That's what this occult system does.
[01:48:50.908 --> 01:48:58.533]  It's a few deities with Lucifer at the center, and then for all these different tribes and tongues, they all have different names, but it's the exact same creatures.
[01:48:59.334 --> 01:48:59.594]  It is.
[01:49:00.074 --> 01:49:01.115]  Take the Islamic faith.
[01:49:01.235 --> 01:49:09.060]  Isn't it interesting that the Masons, back in the late 19th century, founded a Masonic order called the Shriners.
[01:49:09.913 --> 01:49:13.494]  They worship at the shrine of Allah and Mohammed.
[01:49:14.554 --> 01:49:21.376]  Now, of course, this is not very popular today with the so-called war on terrorism against the Muslims, so they sort of downplay it a little.
[01:49:21.396 --> 01:49:22.817]  Well, it's real big here in Texas.
[01:49:22.857 --> 01:49:27.638]  I see all the Cadillacs with the old men with the sword and the crescent and the star.
[01:49:27.958 --> 01:49:31.239]  Yeah, there you go, the Islamic, and they literally take an oath.
[01:49:31.974 --> 01:49:37.677]  To obey the dictates of Allah and Mohammed, and yet they call themselves American patriots.
[01:49:38.097 --> 01:49:38.697]  Tex, stay there.
[01:49:38.717 --> 01:49:39.978]  I want to come back and take some calls.
[01:49:40.038 --> 01:49:43.319]  Folks have been holding patiently and had a few other key issues to discuss with you.
[01:49:43.659 --> 01:49:46.881]  It's always, uh, time always flies when Tex Marsh joins us.
[01:49:47.261 --> 01:49:47.921]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:47.941 --> 01:49:49.242]  We'll also give you some of his websites.
[01:49:54.947 --> 01:49:57.829]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.069 --> 01:49:59.650]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:04.653]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.993 --> 01:50:09.456]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.856 --> 01:50:14.019]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.239 --> 01:50:17.101]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.201 --> 01:50:21.843]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.043 --> 01:50:26.466]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.706 --> 01:50:33.890]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:36.591]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:52:11.338 --> 01:52:11.939]  I think so.
[01:52:31.613 --> 01:52:32.013]  I think so.
[01:53:07.376 --> 01:53:10.478]  I know you've been holding for a while.
[01:53:10.518 --> 01:53:11.599]  We're going to go to your calls.
[01:53:11.639 --> 01:53:15.221]  Text has been gracious enough to stay with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:17.582]  Who's up first here, John?
[01:53:19.523 --> 01:53:20.303]  Jared and Mass.
[01:53:20.323 --> 01:53:21.784]  I know you've been holding for an eon.
[01:53:21.824 --> 01:53:22.885]  What's on your mind, Jared?
[01:53:24.305 --> 01:53:24.806]  Good afternoon.
[01:53:24.826 --> 01:53:25.786]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:53:26.226 --> 01:53:26.506]  You bet.
[01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:33.110]  I heard your first comment about the Red Sox, and I've got to say, living in Mass, you are 100% right on.
[01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:34.951]  That's got to be the number one distraction.
[01:53:35.461 --> 01:53:38.842]  Between the Red Sox and the Patriots and all other sports.
[01:53:39.923 --> 01:53:41.003]  Well, nothing against sports.
[01:53:41.063 --> 01:53:48.846]  I was pointing out earlier that people need to get focused on real issues and start getting upset, not about sports, but get upset about losing our freedoms.
[01:53:49.406 --> 01:53:49.926]  Exactly.
[01:53:50.466 --> 01:54:02.230]  And secondly, my question is, seeing how all that's happening right now directly relates to the processing in the book of Revelations, why is there not more emphasis on that?
[01:54:02.891 --> 01:54:03.551]  And number two,
[01:54:04.561 --> 01:54:07.602]  Uh, what I've read in Revelations, it doesn't get any better.
[01:54:07.622 --> 01:54:09.002]  This is only going to get worse.
[01:54:09.582 --> 01:54:12.183]  So, you know, there's not really anything we can do.
[01:54:12.783 --> 01:54:13.803]  We can't stop them.
[01:54:13.943 --> 01:54:16.264]  Well, Jared, thanks for those two important questions.
[01:54:16.304 --> 01:54:19.624]  Let's let Tex Mars respond to that.
[01:54:19.704 --> 01:54:19.984]  Tex?
[01:54:20.804 --> 01:54:26.546]  One of the things Jared needs to understand, and all of our listeners, is that we can do something.
[01:54:27.986 --> 01:54:30.466]  You know, in Revelation 13, it talks about the beast.
[01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:32.727]  This is a world system of evil.
[01:54:33.354 --> 01:54:40.000]  And it says the whole world wondered after the beast and said, who could possibly make war against him?
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:45.685]  But the very next verse says that he makes war against the saints.
[01:54:46.806 --> 01:54:52.090]  Now, so the only people that will prevent this beast is the saints.
[01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:55.173]  The only people who can make war are the saints.
[01:54:55.233 --> 01:54:58.035]  That are those who are knowledgeable, educated, and
[01:55:00.665 --> 01:55:02.426]  Believe in the true God.
[01:55:02.506 --> 01:55:03.386]  You know, Tex, you're right.
[01:55:03.406 --> 01:55:04.527]  They take that out of context.
[01:55:04.547 --> 01:55:10.470]  They say, who can make war, as if, oh, you can't make war, but then it shows who he's making war with, who he's worried about.
[01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.370]  Absolutely.
[01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:14.652]  Later in Revelation, it talks about the overcomers.
[01:55:15.172 --> 01:55:21.135]  They overcame through the power of their testimony and the blood of the Lamb, of Jesus.
[01:55:21.395 --> 01:55:26.577]  So again, Christ being under the Holy Spirit, and by speaking the truth,
[01:55:28.394 --> 01:55:29.334]  It smashes them.
[01:55:29.495 --> 01:55:30.255]  Can you believe that?
[01:55:30.295 --> 01:55:32.236]  The power of their testimony.
[01:55:32.816 --> 01:55:37.658]  You know, when we talk about the truth, and this is what your program is, your program is a program of truth.
[01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:43.160]  Listen, they've got millions of dollars in disinformation agents to fight you.
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:51.464]  But listen, when you were on C-SPAN, and they had to bring on this fake expert, and I know this gentleman, and he's fake from the word go.
[01:55:51.524 --> 01:55:53.064]  I've known about him for 15 years.
[01:55:53.505 --> 01:55:56.626]  They had to bring him in because you were making such an impact.
[01:55:57.233 --> 01:56:01.236]  You see, if you're not making an impact, they just disregard you.
[01:56:02.057 --> 01:56:02.958]  You're a gadfly.
[01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:07.361]  They pay you no attention because they say he'll die through neglect.
[01:56:07.702 --> 01:56:11.465]  But when you are making an impact, then they've got to fight you.
[01:56:11.505 --> 01:56:16.629]  They've got to bring on their so-called experts, their liars, and this is what they do.
[01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.651]  And I think it's a wonderful thing.
[01:56:19.721 --> 01:56:23.724]  When they come on, and of course they'll try to use ridicule.
[01:56:24.265 --> 01:56:26.526]  Oh, he's a conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:56:26.907 --> 01:56:28.288]  Don't believe anything he says.
[01:56:28.688 --> 01:56:42.498]  You know, they're so afraid of our testimony, Alex, that Karen Hughes, you know her, they even made her the Undersecretary of State for, I think she's like Joseph Goebbels, the new Minister of Propaganda.
[01:56:43.443 --> 01:56:44.724]  And what is her job?
[01:56:45.004 --> 01:56:47.285]  To put out fake news stories.
[01:56:47.385 --> 01:56:50.886]  To go to the other countries and even in the United States.
[01:56:51.226 --> 01:56:54.148]  And look, last year they paid this guy, Armstrong, $240,000 to be a shrill.
[01:56:58.141 --> 01:57:01.885]  Well, by the way, the Congress just found that to be illegal again.
[01:57:02.226 --> 01:57:05.289]  Two hundred and something million just for fake newscasts.
[01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:06.591]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:06.931 --> 01:57:17.002]  Every time you watch Fox News, CNN, talking heads, ex-military people, they are all paid for by the CIA, the Defense Department.
[01:57:17.303 --> 01:57:18.444]  Don't believe these guys.
[01:57:18.484 --> 01:57:19.145]  They're liars!
[01:57:21.568 --> 01:57:22.989]  And Tex, stay there my friend.
[01:57:23.009 --> 01:57:26.330]  We're going to come back and continue covering the news and information.
[01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:28.572]  Of course, Tex himself was a colonel in the Air Force.
[01:57:29.092 --> 01:57:30.152]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.434 --> 01:57:38.316]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:50.521]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.182 --> 01:57:52.262]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.943 --> 01:57:54.063]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.704 --> 01:57:55.524]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.284 --> 01:57:57.205]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.845 --> 01:58:01.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.027 --> 01:58:06.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.269 --> 01:58:12.313]  Tex Lars is with us for about 15, 20 more minutes.
[01:58:12.973 --> 01:58:16.054]  And we're going to be taking calls quickly for him.
[01:58:16.074 --> 01:58:16.135]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:19.617 --> 01:58:25.919]  But before he leaves us, we'll get his answer on what is the final goal of these occultist Illuminati people.
[01:58:26.299 --> 01:58:29.960]  You know, how have they been deceived into serving their dark master?
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:33.641]  Let's go to John in Tennessee, who I'm told disagrees with something.
[01:58:33.701 --> 01:58:34.441]  John, go ahead.
[01:58:34.782 --> 01:58:42.564]  Yeah, it might be a misunderstanding, but I thought I heard you commenting on William Bennett saying that he had disagreed with a caller about the Freakonomics book.
[01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:58.958]  But the actual quote, the caller had called in to make a point against abortion, saying that the babies had been aborted, if they had been allowed to live and grow up, they could have been helped to sign Social Security.
[01:58:59.525 --> 01:59:04.167]  And William Bennett actually argued against the pro-life position that the caller had been making.
[01:59:04.567 --> 01:59:08.228]  Well, I wasn't aware of that, and if that's the case, I did hear a small clip of it.
[01:59:08.248 --> 01:59:09.469]  I didn't hear the full clip.
[01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:12.570]  I've got the whole quote, and I've emailed it to your tip.
[01:59:12.590 --> 01:59:14.991]  Well, no, that is bad that he said that.
[01:59:15.051 --> 01:59:20.873]  I mean, I thought it was just politically correct people freaking out, you know, because it looks like he didn't criticize it.
[01:59:20.893 --> 01:59:21.874]  He said we shouldn't abort.
[01:59:22.274 --> 01:59:23.354]  He said that'd be immoral.
[01:59:23.574 --> 01:59:25.775]  Well, see, the caller had said... I've got the whole thing.
[01:59:25.795 --> 01:59:26.736]  You're saying he didn't say that?
[01:59:28.136 --> 01:59:37.861]  Bennett did say that if you aborted all the black babies that crime would go down, but that would be immoral and so forth.
[01:59:38.261 --> 01:59:45.944]  But he was using that as a counter against the college argument that was saying that if... Here's a college quote.
[01:59:46.104 --> 01:59:51.126]  I know it's in the national media that they talk a lot about the loss of revenue and inability to fund Social Security.
[01:59:51.146 --> 01:59:52.747]  Listen, I've been texting with this for a long time.
[01:59:52.787 --> 01:59:53.708]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:59:53.728 --> 01:59:54.548]  We'll get back to you later.
[01:59:55.028 --> 01:59:55.809]  I agree with you on that.
[01:59:55.829 --> 01:59:55.949]  It is.
[01:59:55.969 --> 01:59:58.230]  In context, what he said was not such a bad thing.
[01:59:58.270 --> 02:00:00.792]  There are certain things you cannot say in society, or even discuss, even if they're true.
[02:00:00.812 --> 02:00:03.974]  And that's what he did, and he's just being bashed by people who want to be politically correct.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:29.785]  Meanwhile, Bennett, you know, is spending $45,000 a night gambling and running around carousing at the Bohemian Grove.
[02:00:30.306 --> 02:00:31.266]  Well, that's right.
[02:00:31.286 --> 02:00:34.369]  He's one of the boys, and he's paid to be a commentator.
[02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:40.274]  He's on the Hannity Combs show practically every night, but he put out the book of virtues.
[02:00:40.334 --> 02:00:50.522]  By the way, he didn't write... None of these people write their own books, you know, and so they have ghostwriters, but the virtues man was exposed for blowing
[02:00:51.181 --> 02:00:53.583]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars at Las Vegas, that's right.
[02:00:54.204 --> 02:00:56.646]  And then we've got Pat Robertson with Racehorses.
[02:00:56.706 --> 02:00:59.268]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in England.
[02:00:59.568 --> 02:01:00.629]  Joseph, thanks for holding.
[02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:03.111]  Hi, no problem.
[02:01:03.691 --> 02:01:05.453]  Yeah, just a question for Tex.
[02:01:05.553 --> 02:01:15.241]  Just firstly though, I just want to say, at the risk of sounding a bit sick of fanfic, I just want to say, Tex, you know, I've read one of your books here and seen a few of your videos, and I think
[02:01:16.233 --> 02:01:25.196]  They're a pretty good way of waking up a lot of Christian people in this, because what you write about is very hardcore, and I think a lot of people can relate to it in the Christian movement.
[02:01:26.036 --> 02:01:33.098]  And, you know, you've got quite a... I hesitate to use the word fanbase, but you've got, you know, quite a following over here, because of some of the material I've passed out.
[02:01:34.058 --> 02:01:37.379]  Well, thank you, Jim, and, you know, I... It's sort of interesting.
[02:01:37.419 --> 02:01:40.420]  We have a lot of people who write us on our newsletter list from England.
[02:01:40.888 --> 02:01:41.488]  Great Britain.
[02:01:41.869 --> 02:01:46.451]  But the publishers over there have told me that my books are too controversial.
[02:01:46.952 --> 02:01:50.154]  No publisher over there will take them because they're so afraid of the government.
[02:01:51.955 --> 02:01:55.097]  Well, they've got thought crimes units over there that come and arrest you.
[02:01:55.117 --> 02:01:56.037]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:01:56.077 --> 02:01:56.517]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:57.678 --> 02:02:00.360]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know about Alex, because you've been over here recently.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.882]  But, no, I mean, I've got... I read Project Lucid.
[02:02:03.922 --> 02:02:04.802]  That was very good.
[02:02:04.943 --> 02:02:06.183]  I've read that all the way through.
[02:02:06.303 --> 02:02:09.185]  Yeah, Tex was writing about RFID chips back in 1996.
[02:02:11.181 --> 02:02:12.862]  And the news didn't start reporting on him until 2001.
[02:02:12.922 --> 02:02:20.925]  Well, that's what makes it so good, because it's recent enough to be up to date, but it's about, what, ten years ago.
[02:02:20.945 --> 02:02:22.806]  So a lot of what he said has actually come true.
[02:02:24.046 --> 02:02:27.568]  Well, that's the real test of a researcher, is time.
[02:02:27.588 --> 02:02:31.970]  It's like, you know, the real test of a bunch of grapes in a bottle is time.
[02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.770]  Does it age well?
[02:02:33.414 --> 02:02:35.857]  And Texas stuff, unfortunately, ages very well.
[02:02:36.378 --> 02:02:38.861]  And I say unfortunate because I wish this stuff wasn't happening.
[02:02:39.201 --> 02:02:41.184]  We'll be right back with Tex Mars and more calls.
[02:02:41.244 --> 02:02:41.825]  Thanks, Joseph.
[02:02:45.586 --> 02:02:52.429]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.729 --> 02:02:54.110]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:56.491]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.651 --> 02:02:58.732]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.012 --> 02:03:03.954]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.294 --> 02:03:08.316]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.576 --> 02:03:10.357]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.377 --> 02:03:21.085]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.225 --> 02:03:23.126]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:04:57.449 --> 02:05:05.353]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.493 --> 02:05:12.537]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.757 --> 02:05:13.979]  There are no side effects.

[02:05:54.978 --> 02:05:55.779]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.539 --> 02:05:57.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.283 --> 02:06:04.625]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:06:05.525 --> 02:06:06.386]  Alex Jones.

[02:06:20.338 --> 02:06:22.860]  I want to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:27.684]  Global Shortwave at www.crtheinternet.infowars.com.
[02:06:28.024 --> 02:06:30.386]  Don't forget the network site GCNlive.com.
[02:06:31.255 --> 02:06:35.337]  And all the great micros out there known by the mainstream media as pirates.
[02:06:35.377 --> 02:06:37.879]  A lot of you doing a great job as well.
[02:06:39.199 --> 02:06:43.562]  Our final segment with Tex Mars, I want to talk to Lynn and Jerry and Mike and a few others.
[02:06:44.642 --> 02:06:52.907]  But Tex Mars, I mean you were an Air Force officer, you know, space and aeronautics professor at UT.
[02:06:53.507 --> 02:06:56.549]  I mean you've always been a Christian, but when did you start
[02:06:57.629 --> 02:07:01.111]  Start really figuring out that it was the occult.
[02:07:01.172 --> 02:07:01.892]  It was the occult.
[02:07:01.932 --> 02:07:07.756]  Because in my own research, I mean, I know who Tex Mars was, I've read a lot of your material, but I personally hadn't run into that.
[02:07:07.816 --> 02:07:09.197]  I was more of a mainline guy.
[02:07:09.217 --> 02:07:12.459]  And then every time I would do research, that's what I run into.
[02:07:12.559 --> 02:07:14.080]  So, that's what I report.
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:16.182]  I mean, they eat, breathe, sleep.
[02:07:16.802 --> 02:07:18.203]  This is all they think about.
[02:07:18.223 --> 02:07:19.424]  It is pathological.
[02:07:20.914 --> 02:07:27.558]  I mean, I liken it to the obsessive compulsive person that has to wash their hands a hundred times a day or flip the light switch on ten times.
[02:07:27.618 --> 02:07:29.719]  I mean, you know, they just have to do this.
[02:07:29.779 --> 02:07:31.139]  They have to have wars.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:32.320]  They have to kill people.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.901]  They have to torture people.
[02:07:33.941 --> 02:07:39.624]  They have to have certain colors in their rituals, they believe, as it resonates with the spiritual plane.
[02:07:40.304 --> 02:07:52.912]  I mean, how did you start waking up to all of this, and then I want to shift gears and talk about what Lucifer's master plan is, and how he's fooled these people, because a lot of them think they're going to share in some utopian kingdom.
[02:07:52.932 --> 02:07:58.715]  That's the big delusion, and they've got to do all these horrible things to ensure it, but in reality they're being fooled.
[02:07:59.335 --> 02:08:01.557]  Well, you know, I began at first to expose.
[02:08:01.577 --> 02:08:03.558]  I had a book called Dark Secrets of the New Age.
[02:08:03.578 --> 02:08:05.639]  It's a number one Christian bestseller.
[02:08:06.039 --> 02:08:07.280]  I exposed the occult.
[02:08:08.084 --> 02:08:13.588]  And the new age movement, but the deeper occult and satanic aspects of it.
[02:08:14.048 --> 02:08:18.111]  I found that their goals were the same as these other organizations and secret societies.
[02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:18.971]  But it's interesting.
[02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:20.452]  I had a friend who came to me.
[02:08:20.813 --> 02:08:24.575]  He was a graduate of Yale University, but obviously he's a brilliant man.
[02:08:24.615 --> 02:08:27.697]  He was an engineer here, one of the high-tech companies.
[02:08:27.757 --> 02:08:29.858]  Roger Javins was his name.
[02:08:29.899 --> 02:08:31.359]  He doesn't live here in Austin anymore.
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:33.981]  He went to New York to work for IBM.
[02:08:34.522 --> 02:08:35.002]  But Roger
[02:08:35.558 --> 02:08:44.120]  He visited me one day, he was in my home, and he said, you know, you've written these wonderful books, Tex, but have you looked into, really, the secret society, such as the Order of Skull and Bones?
[02:08:45.081 --> 02:08:49.822]  And I said, well, I don't know, there's something, you know, maybe the Holy Spirit is telling me to look in that area.
[02:08:49.862 --> 02:08:51.222]  Tell me what you know about it.
[02:08:51.242 --> 02:08:58.584]  He says, well, I went to Yale, and I did my senior thesis paper on the Order of Skull and Bones.
[02:08:59.444 --> 02:09:00.805]  And he showed me his paper.
[02:09:01.285 --> 02:09:03.105]  This was an unpublished paper.
[02:09:03.125 --> 02:09:04.946]  Remember, he was a Yale graduate.
[02:09:05.695 --> 02:09:11.218]  And I read it, and I could see the incredible connections with the occult world.
[02:09:11.758 --> 02:09:13.659]  And he said, you really need to look into this.
[02:09:14.799 --> 02:09:18.301]  I believe this is bigger than you can imagine.
[02:09:19.301 --> 02:09:20.322]  And I did.
[02:09:20.402 --> 02:09:27.925]  I still give Roger Javins credit for sort of waking me up to, you know, the Masonic Order, the O.T.O.
[02:09:28.025 --> 02:09:34.388]  And now you've reached tens of millions of people, and so many listeners think that by themselves they're supposed to defeat
[02:09:35.154 --> 02:09:38.216]  You know, Beelzebub and all of his generals overnight.
[02:09:38.496 --> 02:09:43.979]  No folks, it's all of us doing a little something and you don't know who that person is that you talk to.
[02:09:44.059 --> 02:09:50.242]  You don't know how many years down the road they'll wake up or what that triggering event is going to be.
[02:09:50.542 --> 02:09:52.764]  It's just all of us doing a little something.
[02:09:53.504 --> 02:09:55.625]  I really see a lot of people waking up right now, Tex.
[02:09:55.985 --> 02:09:56.726]  Oh, I do too.
[02:09:56.786 --> 02:09:58.247]  I think we're waking up a lot of people.
[02:09:58.647 --> 02:10:00.788]  Again, at first they wanted to ignore us.
[02:10:00.968 --> 02:10:02.189]  They thought we would just go away.
[02:10:03.059 --> 02:10:10.685]  Uh, but now they're beginning to, and second thing they did was to try to ridicule or mock us, but now they're beginning to really attack us.
[02:10:11.166 --> 02:10:12.007]  They're worried now.
[02:10:12.047 --> 02:10:16.430]  They're saying, you know, we're going to have to have hate crimes laws.
[02:10:17.091 --> 02:10:18.572]  These conspiracy theorists.
[02:10:19.301 --> 02:10:20.222]  Are dangerous.
[02:10:20.582 --> 02:10:24.364]  That's right, they're now not saying the war on terror, it's the war on extremists.
[02:10:24.644 --> 02:10:26.545]  That's right, and we're of course extremists.
[02:10:26.565 --> 02:10:35.370]  Remember, George Bush even went to the United Nations, President Bush, and warned the whole world, don't listen to the conspiracy theorists.
[02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:41.854]  And now, if we were just silly people, silly idiots, they wouldn't worry about us at all.
[02:10:42.694 --> 02:10:45.055]  They would say, that's just a comedy act.
[02:10:45.496 --> 02:10:48.057]  Hey, they are really worried now, and they're spending
[02:10:48.576 --> 02:10:52.338]  Hundreds of millions of dollars to confront and try to stop us.
[02:10:52.538 --> 02:10:57.821]  What about the most popular question, well if that's true, why are you still alive?
[02:10:58.402 --> 02:11:05.386]  Well, that's a very silly question, but God has his own reasons for us being alive.
[02:11:06.006 --> 02:11:07.627]  But there are many people who are dead.
[02:11:08.484 --> 02:11:09.705]  I mean, look, we could make a list.
[02:11:10.065 --> 02:11:16.609]  Alex, if we started dredging up the people from, you know, Danny Casolaro, you could go on and on.
[02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:19.090]  Paul Wilcher, people who are dead.
[02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:20.331]  William Cooper?
[02:11:20.551 --> 02:11:22.072]  William Cooper, absolutely.
[02:11:22.352 --> 02:11:23.352]  Killed in an ambush.
[02:11:24.333 --> 02:11:25.434]  Why are we not dead?
[02:11:25.774 --> 02:11:29.936]  Well, I think God is more powerful than the evil side.
[02:11:30.456 --> 02:11:36.780]  And as long as God wants us to tell the truth, remember the power of their testimony, we will be here.
[02:11:37.944 --> 02:11:42.108]  I have no doubt that they have the power to destroy us.
[02:11:42.528 --> 02:11:44.170]  That's two-sided.
[02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:46.091]  Number one, God is protecting us.
[02:11:46.131 --> 02:11:47.393]  Thank you, God.
[02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:50.315]  That hedge could be taken up at any minute.
[02:11:50.516 --> 02:11:52.037]  If it's part of God's plan, so be it.
[02:11:53.098 --> 02:11:55.961]  But also, the globalists know we're too popular.
[02:11:56.001 --> 02:11:56.982]  We're too in the light.
[02:11:57.082 --> 02:11:58.023]  They kill the people.
[02:11:58.303 --> 02:12:00.184]  Who have the secret that don't expose it.
[02:12:00.364 --> 02:12:01.525]  We've already spilt the beans.
[02:12:02.085 --> 02:12:05.547]  More textbooks, more books are going to sell if they kill Tex Mars.
[02:12:05.767 --> 02:12:11.090]  If they gun me down tomorrow, you know, more of my videos are going to sell than ever before, Tex.
[02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:13.651]  Well not only that, but you have, what you said is true.
[02:12:14.111 --> 02:12:15.372]  We have planted seeds.
[02:12:16.132 --> 02:12:24.056]  At first, the most intelligent people out there in your audience, if they were like you and me at first, I was a mainstream guy.
[02:12:24.377 --> 02:12:27.138]  Hey, listen, I have a degree in political science.
[02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:31.320]  I never learned this from my college, my university professors.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.461]  But people out there, at first, they say, no, this cannot be true.
[02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:37.661]  This is so dumb.
[02:12:38.242 --> 02:12:44.663]  No, everything must be just as I've seen on TV and read in the newspapers and Time Magazine.
[02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:47.624]  But after a while, they keep listening to your program.
[02:12:48.024 --> 02:12:51.365]  At first, some people listen to it just to get a good laugh.
[02:12:51.965 --> 02:12:53.345]  Ah, no, this can't be true.
[02:12:53.405 --> 02:12:54.345]  I've been told this, yes.
[02:12:54.565 --> 02:12:56.726]  But after a few months, they say, you know what?
[02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:58.411]  This is making sense!
[02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.252]  And then they begin to read their newspaper.
[02:13:01.393 --> 02:13:02.693]  Everything, they change.
[02:13:02.713 --> 02:13:04.294]  You know, the paradigm changes.
[02:13:05.015 --> 02:13:11.359]  From the brainwashed propaganda, they start analyzing things for themselves.
[02:13:11.899 --> 02:13:16.702]  And by the way, this is why Y2K had to be prevented by the government.
[02:13:17.502 --> 02:13:24.206]  Because can you imagine if people quit watching government-approved TV just for two weeks?
[02:13:24.266 --> 02:13:25.107]  They would wake up!
[02:13:25.527 --> 02:13:26.948]  The zombies would wake up!
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:28.600]  And they can't allow that.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.081]  They've got to keep pumping the disinformation and propaganda.
[02:13:32.582 --> 02:13:38.864]  So, here we have a program, and if they were to kill you and me, I believe seeds would sprout out there.
[02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:42.065]  There's going to be more people come up saying, I don't believe you.
[02:13:42.865 --> 02:13:44.265]  Two and two does make four.
[02:13:45.966 --> 02:13:48.587]  And, you know, remember in the George Orwell book, 1984,
[02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:56.809]  The whole key was the guy wanted the ability, the freedom to say that two and two makes four.
[02:13:57.209 --> 02:14:00.092]  The government comes along and says, Alex Jones, you're teaching that.
[02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:01.393]  That's not good.
[02:14:01.593 --> 02:14:09.782]  Well, the globalists know that... Who was the founding father that said the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots?
[02:14:09.842 --> 02:14:11.023]  Thomas Jefferson, uh-huh.
[02:14:11.883 --> 02:14:18.867]  So, I mean, really, in history, folks, if they squash us into the ground, we are like Miracle-Gro fertilizer.
[02:14:19.247 --> 02:14:23.669]  But they're running a dangerous race here by allowing us to exist.
[02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:29.392]  It might be, you know, right now, they're attempting to pass law.
[02:14:29.452 --> 02:14:30.833]  We could have a night of the long knives.
[02:14:31.273 --> 02:14:35.936]  We could have a night of the long knives if they really are threatened.
[02:14:36.316 --> 02:14:37.937]  And I believe it's coming to that level.
[02:14:38.747 --> 02:14:41.390]  They're beginning to pass laws and legislation to stop us.
[02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:42.170]  Hate Crimes Act.
[02:14:42.671 --> 02:14:51.359]  You know, this whole guise of the European Union having the power to control the internet, along with the United States.
[02:14:51.779 --> 02:14:56.464]  The reason for that is, they have a little problem called the First Amendment in America.
[02:14:57.164 --> 02:14:59.466]  But over in Europe, they don't have a First Amendment.
[02:14:59.967 --> 02:15:03.210]  And if they can give control to the European community,
[02:15:03.812 --> 02:15:09.496]  of the Internet, they'll close InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com real quick.
[02:15:09.536 --> 02:15:12.158]  By the way, Tex, give us some of the websites for Power Prophecy.
[02:15:12.579 --> 02:15:14.700]  Sure, PowerProphecy.com.
[02:15:15.401 --> 02:15:19.704]  And then we also have one called ConspiracyWorld.com.
[02:15:19.804 --> 02:15:21.866]  ConspiracyWorld.com.
[02:15:22.026 --> 02:15:25.108]  And there's also, Tex, there's also... I'm sorry.
[02:15:25.128 --> 02:15:25.869]  That's okay.
[02:15:26.029 --> 02:15:27.930]  You know, I'm a master of interrupting.
[02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:28.431]  No, no.
[02:15:30.845 --> 02:15:32.406]  Uh, there's also textmars.com.
[02:15:32.786 --> 02:15:34.206]  Oh yeah, textmars.com.
[02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:37.948]  That'll bring you to actually, I believe, to powerofprophecy.com.
[02:15:38.148 --> 02:15:40.909]  We have a lot of free articles, even if people don't want to buy anything.
[02:15:40.949 --> 02:15:44.510]  Go there and check the little button that says articles, and you'll have a list of them.
[02:15:44.530 --> 02:15:47.031]  In fact, Tex, give us that toll-free number for the free newsletter again.
[02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:48.112]  Yeah, free newsletter.
[02:15:48.192 --> 02:15:51.773]  We'll tell you all about George Bush shooting the finger at people.
[02:15:51.853 --> 02:15:55.775]  Actually, this issue has a picture of that, and you mentioned the satanic thing.
[02:15:56.215 --> 02:16:03.980]  You'll see King Abdullah of Jordan giving the satanic symbol sign to Vladimir Putin.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:04.701]  Sort of interesting.
[02:16:05.001 --> 02:16:16.668]  To get that issue free, just call toll free 1-800-234-9673 and simply say, hey, put me on your mailing list.
[02:16:16.688 --> 02:16:17.749]  I want that free newsletter.
[02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:20.771]  Great, I'm going to jam a caller in here at the end.
[02:16:20.851 --> 02:16:22.092]  Lynn in Oklahoma, real quick.
[02:16:22.132 --> 02:16:22.672]  Go ahead, Lynn.
[02:16:22.852 --> 02:16:23.513]  Yeah, Alex, you know,
[02:16:24.372 --> 02:16:30.754]  The globalists do what they do because their master, Satan, comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:16:30.774 --> 02:16:33.895]  So of course this truly is a spiritual battleground.
[02:16:33.935 --> 02:16:37.736]  But I wanted to mention, you touched on this briefly in the first hour, Alex.
[02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:44.718]  Tonight at 8pm Central, the History Channel is part of their Decoding the Past series.
[02:16:44.858 --> 02:16:50.200]  It's going to have secret societies as a theme for the program tonight.
[02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:54.081]  And during the promo they specifically mentioned Skull and Bones.
[02:16:54.921 --> 02:17:01.910]  And one of the questions in caption during the promo that they ask is, are these groups our shadow government?
[02:17:02.671 --> 02:17:04.393]  I've seen the promo and I've heard the promo.
[02:17:04.413 --> 02:17:06.756]  Tex, why are we seeing a coming out?
[02:17:06.856 --> 02:17:09.639]  I mean, the globalists are really coming out and admitting a lot right now.
[02:17:11.061 --> 02:17:14.305]  You know the term, Alex, you and I have discussed it, a partial hangout.
[02:17:15.442 --> 02:17:18.584]  They believe what they want is their own spin on it.
[02:17:18.644 --> 02:17:22.245]  They'll admit to certain things that before they said we were just crazy.
[02:17:22.646 --> 02:17:27.788]  Now they admit to them, but then they conclude by saying, don't worry, it's really not a shadow government.
[02:17:28.108 --> 02:17:29.489]  It's not such a big deal.
[02:17:29.729 --> 02:17:31.910]  It's just a fraternity at Yale of young men.
[02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:33.511]  Go back to sleep.
[02:17:34.311 --> 02:17:37.093]  Tex Marsh, it's always great having you on.
[02:17:37.453 --> 02:17:38.293]  We're going to break.
[02:17:38.633 --> 02:17:39.734]  I'd like to talk to you during the break.
[02:17:39.754 --> 02:17:41.074]  Please stay there for a second.
[02:17:41.295 --> 02:17:42.115]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:17:46.027 --> 02:17:49.390]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[02:17:49.711 --> 02:17:52.273]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[02:17:52.793 --> 02:17:54.875]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[02:17:55.456 --> 02:17:58.599]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[02:17:58.859 --> 02:18:02.603]  Conversely, where oxygen is deficient, disease thrives.
[02:18:02.963 --> 02:18:09.189]  With atmospheric oxygen levels commonly dipping as low as 10% in today's indoor and urban environments,
[02:18:09.529 --> 02:18:12.450]  Is it any wonder we have so much chronic disease to deal with?
[02:18:12.610 --> 02:18:15.912]  Most of us are oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[02:18:16.172 --> 02:18:20.774]  Without sufficient oxygen, both our physical and mental health will deteriorate.
[02:18:21.094 --> 02:18:28.577]  Clearly, increasing the body's oxygen without negative side effects is critical to achieving good health and a sense of well-being.
[02:18:28.777 --> 02:18:35.500]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:43.552]  To learn more about safely increasing your body's oxygen level, click the blue and white oxygen banner at GCNlive.com.
[02:18:45.777 --> 02:18:49.239]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:49.519 --> 02:18:53.020]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:57.062]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:57.262 --> 02:19:03.425]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.845 --> 02:19:11.749]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:19:12.169 --> 02:19:17.510]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:17.650 --> 02:19:21.411]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:21.791 --> 02:19:23.632]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.

[02:19:37.455 --> 02:19:47.637]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:48.037 --> 02:19:53.518]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:54.078 --> 02:19:54.578]  That's right.
[02:19:54.898 --> 02:19:57.199]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:58.579 --> 02:20:04.660]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:05.234 --> 02:20:12.920]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:18.224]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:18.844 --> 02:20:21.866]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:24.648 --> 02:20:28.792]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:20:29.173 --> 02:20:29.453]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:29.473 --> 02:20:31.355]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:20:31.435 --> 02:20:31.735]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:32.035 --> 02:20:32.316]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.529 --> 02:20:48.070]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:52.772]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[02:20:53.352 --> 02:20:58.994]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[02:20:59.574 --> 02:21:05.697]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?
[02:21:06.557 --> 02:21:16.908]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.941]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:21:50.405 --> 02:21:52.306]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.786 --> 02:21:55.588]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.189 --> 02:21:59.710]  Well, I mean, I really am abusing text today.
[02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:04.192]  I've drug him now into about an hour and twenty minutes being on the air with us.
[02:22:04.752 --> 02:22:09.455]  But just to answer that question I posed earlier and then I interrupted him a few times and he couldn't finish.
[02:22:11.736 --> 02:22:19.220]  The globalists, when I read their internal literature and I study them, oh, we've got to kill and destroy and have all this power because it's not that we like it,
[02:22:20.157 --> 02:22:23.767]  Though they do, it's because we've got to be more evil than the evil.
[02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:28.620]  That's what they tell our special forces when they carry out terror attacks on our own people.
[02:22:29.324 --> 02:22:31.126]  And these are cases where we've caught them doing it.
[02:22:31.866 --> 02:22:44.977]  Well, the globalists say they've got to kill 85% of us to bring in this utopia, when really the Bible says that that's how the devil will dilute them, and that his plan is to destroy everything.
[02:22:45.237 --> 02:22:46.258]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:22:46.318 --> 02:22:48.280]  Tex, what's wrong with these people?
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:54.004]  I mean, a lot of them are really smart, but at the same time, it's like they're fatally stupid at a certain level.
[02:22:55.826 --> 02:22:56.947]  They must kill.
[02:22:57.047 --> 02:22:58.168]  They must have blood.
[02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:00.581]  To create an energy force.
[02:23:01.582 --> 02:23:05.045]  They actually have a program, it's called Creative Destruction.
[02:23:05.706 --> 02:23:12.131]  If they can annihilate, kill most of the people on Earth, they believe this will give them the energy.
[02:23:12.831 --> 02:23:17.215]  You know, Vladimir Lenin was one of these satanic conspirators.
[02:23:17.996 --> 02:23:21.378]  And he created, of course, the Red Terror in the Soviet Union.
[02:23:22.119 --> 02:23:28.344]  But when they would come back with reports on how many had been purged, had been murdered, he actually
[02:23:28.869 --> 02:23:31.750]  Screamed out, we need more blood!
[02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:36.792]  Hitler was a member of the Thule Society, a very secret society.
[02:23:37.292 --> 02:23:38.473]  The very same thing.
[02:23:39.173 --> 02:23:42.634]  He was pleased to hear sometimes of the troop reports, how many died.
[02:23:43.134 --> 02:23:44.435]  He said, we need more!
[02:23:45.815 --> 02:23:48.436]  Remember, Proverbs has a very interesting passage.
[02:23:48.897 --> 02:23:55.299]  God says this, it says, all those who hate me love death.
[02:23:55.919 --> 02:23:57.960]  They have an obsession with death.
[02:23:58.789 --> 02:24:00.151]  And I believe this is what it is.
[02:24:00.251 --> 02:24:14.690]  They wish to annihilate most of the people of the earth, to create tremendous bloodshed, and then they will create their great kingdom on top of the rubble of the embers of earth that are left.
[02:24:15.154 --> 02:24:18.936]  They actually think this will give them the power from their demonic spirits.
[02:24:19.056 --> 02:24:20.637]  You know, I'm finishing a video right now.
[02:24:20.697 --> 02:24:23.398]  I think at the start I want to put that Proverbs quote.
[02:24:23.879 --> 02:24:27.120]  All those that hate me love death.
[02:24:27.601 --> 02:24:29.682]  Off the top of your head text, do you know which proverb that is?
[02:24:30.202 --> 02:24:33.444]  I believe it's Proverbs 28, but I'll have my...
[02:24:35.675 --> 02:24:42.464]  I don't want to sound like a wimp here, but growing up I liked being tough.
[02:24:42.524 --> 02:24:44.567]  I liked getting in street fights growing up in Dallas.
[02:24:45.007 --> 02:24:48.572]  I was kind of, I wouldn't say dark, but I was rebellious and destructive.
[02:24:49.275 --> 02:24:52.656]  But now as I've gotten older, I feel stronger than I've ever felt.
[02:24:52.716 --> 02:24:57.657]  I don't even, you know, I feel really strong like I could take on 20 people, but I don't want to.
[02:24:57.677 --> 02:25:06.060]  But like if a lizard gets caught in my house and I can't get it out, and I know he's going to starve to death, I'm like worried about the lizard, and I don't like stepping on bugs, and I mean,
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:09.441]  But I feel good having it.
[02:25:09.501 --> 02:25:13.523]  I feel stronger loving life and loving little people.
[02:25:14.684 --> 02:25:17.986]  But then I see these other people that went to the extreme of that other path.
[02:25:18.206 --> 02:25:20.408]  They love being ruthless, Tex.
[02:25:20.428 --> 02:25:20.848]  Well, they do.
[02:25:20.968 --> 02:25:23.109]  Abu Ghraib is nothing for them.
[02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:24.890]  It's like Rush Limbaugh.
[02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:27.452]  You quoted him as saying, they're just blowing off some steam.
[02:25:28.653 --> 02:25:32.815]  And they do not have a finely developed sense of compassion.
[02:25:33.295 --> 02:25:37.238]  But I think as you grow as a person, you become a much better person.
[02:25:38.102 --> 02:25:39.705]  Uh, and I've got a way, too.
[02:25:39.765 --> 02:25:42.168]  I'm just, you know, it'd be hard for me to kill somebody.
[02:25:42.568 --> 02:25:49.277]  But keep in mind that you and I, our minds are totally different than these people.
[02:25:50.241 --> 02:25:57.065]  And remember, you know, the whole Masonic Kabbalah is based on the same thing as the Hindu system.
[02:25:57.445 --> 02:26:02.687]  You know, the goddess Kali, the cobra serpent goddess, she was the goddess of death.
[02:26:03.188 --> 02:26:05.669]  And they believe that you do people service.
[02:26:06.229 --> 02:26:11.332]  Jesus said they will kill you, and thinketh they do God service.
[02:26:11.812 --> 02:26:16.274]  And of course their God is different than our God, and they do Him service by killing.
[02:26:17.452 --> 02:26:24.937]  At the highest levels of the Illuminati, do they know the real plan is to destroy everything and that they're going to lose?
[02:26:24.957 --> 02:26:27.859]  As far as losing, I believe they've been deceived.
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:31.742]  The Bible talks about how they have been blinded.
[02:26:33.083 --> 02:26:39.167]  Paul even said in the last days, men will go about deceiving and being deceived.
[02:26:39.988 --> 02:26:43.230]  They, I believe, are deceived that they will have victory.
[02:26:44.036 --> 02:26:48.519]  And this is the great delusion in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[02:26:48.979 --> 02:26:53.802]  A strong delusion will fall on the world and they will believe the lie.
[02:26:54.082 --> 02:26:55.223]  And here we have it.
[02:26:55.623 --> 02:26:57.524]  These people are actually blinded.
[02:26:57.944 --> 02:26:59.805]  Interestingly enough though, Satan is not.
[02:26:59.865 --> 02:27:05.889]  It says that he is furious in the last days because he knows he has but a short time.
[02:27:07.811 --> 02:27:10.032]  So he's just trying to kill everything beautiful.
[02:27:10.692 --> 02:27:15.014]  He wants to kill everything beautiful, bring it all down to destruction with him.
[02:27:15.755 --> 02:27:16.135]  That's right.
[02:27:16.215 --> 02:27:18.796]  Well, I can't wait till that old serpent's bound, Tex.
[02:27:18.836 --> 02:27:19.336]  What about you?
[02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:22.318]  Absolutely, and it's only a matter of time, Alex.
[02:27:22.798 --> 02:27:23.818]  Tex, thanks for coming on.
[02:27:23.838 --> 02:27:24.499]  We're out of time.
[02:27:24.739 --> 02:27:25.899]  Vaya con Dios, my friend.
[02:27:25.959 --> 02:27:26.820]  Hey, Vaya con Dios.
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.020]  God bless you and your audience.
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:29.041]  Take care, my friend.
[02:27:29.161 --> 02:27:29.481]  Bye-bye.
[02:27:29.681 --> 02:27:30.681]  We'll be right back, folks.

[02:28:47.788 --> 02:28:51.869]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.029 --> 02:28:54.891]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.991 --> 02:29:01.693]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.873 --> 02:29:04.875]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.075 --> 02:29:07.476]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.596 --> 02:29:15.499]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:15.879 --> 02:29:27.067]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:37.741]  All those who hate me love death.
[02:30:37.861 --> 02:30:40.802]  Again, you come from a different world than they do.
[02:30:40.822 --> 02:30:41.562]  You're not ruthless.
[02:30:41.582 --> 02:30:42.582]  You don't like to kill.
[02:31:06.221 --> 02:31:07.781]  You're not possessed by evil.
[02:31:08.522 --> 02:31:10.062]  You may be decadent, slovenly.
[02:31:10.362 --> 02:31:11.442]  We've all got problems.
[02:31:14.263 --> 02:31:20.985]  But, again, the average person just cannot believe how evil the globalists are.
[02:31:23.225 --> 02:31:24.846]  And I judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:31:24.966 --> 02:31:26.546]  I look at most atheists I know.
[02:31:28.367 --> 02:31:31.047]  And you'll tell them, hey, the New World Order believes in the occult.
[02:31:31.327 --> 02:31:33.648]  And they go, I don't believe in God or the devil.
[02:31:34.238 --> 02:31:40.342]  Well, regardless of whether you believe in it or not, the belief system of the elite is Satanism.
[02:31:41.443 --> 02:31:55.753]  You know, the lower and mid-level people are, at the bottom it's New Agers, and then up above that it's a cultist, and then they get into, uh, oh well, the devil's really good, he's friendly, kind of this gold type, golden dawn type magic.
[02:31:57.153 --> 02:32:00.074]  And then above that, when you get to the highest level, hey man!
[02:32:00.474 --> 02:32:01.334]  Black magic, baby!
[02:32:01.354 --> 02:32:01.914]  We're into death!
[02:32:01.954 --> 02:32:02.794]  Let's drink some blood!
[02:32:03.435 --> 02:32:05.515]  I mean, that's really what's at the top.
[02:32:06.035 --> 02:32:06.935]  Death and destruction.
[02:32:08.456 --> 02:32:11.676]  And... It's real!
[02:32:14.477 --> 02:32:17.998]  These individuals that believe in it are manifesting it through the real world.
[02:32:18.078 --> 02:32:19.018]  They are making it real.
[02:32:20.012 --> 02:32:21.413]  No, no, you're just nuts.
[02:32:21.454 --> 02:32:22.815]  You believe the elite are devil worshippers.
[02:32:22.855 --> 02:32:24.036]  Well, it's historical.
[02:32:24.096 --> 02:32:24.657]  It's proven.
[02:32:24.937 --> 02:32:25.838]  It's documented.
[02:32:26.238 --> 02:32:27.459]  Their symbols are everywhere.
[02:32:27.539 --> 02:32:28.520]  They go have these meetings.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.441]  We've got them on tape.
[02:32:29.661 --> 02:32:31.083]  Bohemian Grove, skull and bones.
[02:32:32.825 --> 02:32:34.466]  I mean, what are we supposed to do for you?
[02:32:34.726 --> 02:32:36.448]  I mean, I'm sorry this is scary.
[02:32:36.728 --> 02:32:37.990]  I'm sorry it's weird.
[02:32:39.551 --> 02:32:43.395]  But they're building a world according to these ideas, these mindsets.
[02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:54.455]  And, you know, most really powerful people that are in real positions of power into this, you know, they're not doing it for nothing, folks, it's because they are getting power on this plane.
[02:32:54.835 --> 02:32:58.358]  It's because, folks, I've studied it, I've seen it, I've experienced it, this stuff is real.
[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:06.703]  But, I look at the fruits of atheists, they'll be like, so what, I like China, so what if they're selling organs?
[02:33:07.904 --> 02:33:09.405]  Ah, so what if we clone humans?
[02:33:09.545 --> 02:33:11.447]  Ah, so what about genetically modified food?
[02:33:12.007 --> 02:33:16.510]  I've noticed with most atheists, they also support the whole dehumanizing agenda.
[02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:19.230]  See, I judge them by their fruits.
[02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:22.791]  I see how unhappy they are.
[02:33:22.811 --> 02:33:24.211]  They don't have a family.
[02:33:24.231 --> 02:33:25.632]  They don't have children, most of them.
[02:33:25.912 --> 02:33:27.112]  Even if they're 50 years old.
[02:33:28.092 --> 02:33:33.494]  And if you really get to talking to them, they do like the occult.
[02:33:33.534 --> 02:33:34.675]  But, oh, it's just fun.
[02:33:34.695 --> 02:33:35.855]  I just think it's interesting.
[02:33:37.836 --> 02:33:39.256]  And I'm just so sad for them.
[02:33:40.156 --> 02:33:42.437]  Or they'll say, yeah, we need a one world government.
[02:33:43.084 --> 02:33:46.105]  And there's so many New Agers who are good people at heart.
[02:33:46.125 --> 02:33:47.466]  I mean, they mean well.
[02:33:48.626 --> 02:33:54.749]  But they're seriously deceived.
[02:33:55.009 --> 02:33:55.509]  You know what?
[02:33:55.569 --> 02:33:57.189]  I mean, this stuff is real, folks.
[02:33:57.790 --> 02:34:03.632]  I mean, even if you don't believe the Bible, even if you don't believe in Jesus Christ, Yahweh, Jehovah,
[02:34:05.231 --> 02:34:09.093]  Still, the elite does, and they are manifesting it.
[02:34:09.393 --> 02:34:18.537]  It's like if I believe I can carve a fallen tree into a canoe, even if the tree isn't a canoe, I can carve it and turn it into that.
[02:34:19.858 --> 02:34:21.759]  So see, there is no debating it.
[02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:29.322]  Whether God's real and the devil's real and this stuff's happening, or whether they're not real and this stuff's happening is a moot point.
[02:34:31.616 --> 02:34:34.518]  As far as the argument goes, it's obviously not a mute point.
[02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:35.478]  It's very important.
[02:34:35.818 --> 02:34:38.820]  But in the argument of whether God exists or not, it doesn't.
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:40.521]  Because they're doing it!
[02:34:40.641 --> 02:34:41.601]  They do believe it!
[02:34:41.822 --> 02:34:43.062]  They're true believers!
[02:34:43.102 --> 02:34:44.103]  Do you understand that?
[02:34:45.003 --> 02:34:48.905]  I mean, we've got leaders that drink blood, folks, out of skulls.
[02:34:49.346 --> 02:34:50.226]  I mean, this is public.
[02:34:50.566 --> 02:34:52.187]  Who openly say they worship Lucifer.
[02:34:52.647 --> 02:34:53.588]  Do you understand this?
[02:34:53.628 --> 02:34:55.289]  They're not playing games!
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:59.383]  And in the real world, they have our troops breathing DU.
[02:34:59.944 --> 02:35:02.707]  In the real world, they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:35:03.007 --> 02:35:05.630]  In the real world, they put mercury in the vaccines.
[02:35:05.810 --> 02:35:10.195]  In the real world, they put stannous, sodium, deadly poison fluoride in the water supply.
[02:35:10.635 --> 02:35:13.819]  In the real world, the scientific reports say it's a toxic sedative.
[02:35:14.588 --> 02:35:17.391]  In the real world, they created Hitler.
[02:35:17.631 --> 02:35:19.933]  In the real world, they put Lenin into power.
[02:35:20.133 --> 02:35:22.335]  In the real world, they put Mao into power.
[02:35:22.535 --> 02:35:26.999]  In the real world, they put Saddam into power and told him to invade countries and then shut him up.
[02:35:27.439 --> 02:35:30.401]  In the real world, our government carries out terror attacks.
[02:35:30.662 --> 02:35:39.169]  In the real world, they are torturing little children in front of their parents at Abu Ghraib and people get on the news and say it's a good thing.
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:47.823]  In the real world, they're trying to warp our military and police's minds to follow orders to arrest patriots.
[02:35:48.023 --> 02:35:49.144]  People say, why haven't they done it yet?
[02:35:49.264 --> 02:35:50.025]  God, number one.
[02:35:50.425 --> 02:35:51.766]  They'd make martyrs out of us, number two.
[02:35:51.826 --> 02:35:56.048]  But number three, and this is very important, they don't have the cod grace.
[02:35:57.629 --> 02:35:58.970]  They don't have the cod grace.
[02:35:59.410 --> 02:36:04.273]  You know, a lot of times when I get pulled over, because I do speed votes, I mean, I can't drive 55, I can't drive 65, I can't drive 75.
[02:36:04.374 --> 02:36:04.814]  I can drive 55!
[02:36:04.854 --> 02:36:05.734]  It was Sammy Hagar, son.
[02:36:12.236 --> 02:36:41.567]  uh... but uh... one of these let me go oh alex you know you know some of them don't but the point is is that uh... the cop gave me a ticket a few weeks ago he was a fan of the show he's also going to give you a ticket which i actually kind of thought was good in a way i i don't want favoritism you know the point is is that the state police all the senior ones that i know are fans of freedom fans the wrong word they are they understand what i'm saying they know it's true though a lot of military is on our side
[02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:44.775]  You see, they've got cadres of killers.
[02:36:44.815 --> 02:36:48.078]  They've got cadres of little psychopaths that will go out and kill whoever they say.
[02:36:48.658 --> 02:36:50.300]  But those guys usually aren't the best.
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:51.361]  They're usually screwed up.
[02:36:51.381 --> 02:36:53.243]  And that's not the best type of operative.
[02:36:53.543 --> 02:37:01.792]  Who they've got that's very dangerous and very scary are people who are really conservative Christian soldiers.
[02:37:02.563 --> 02:37:10.345]  Who have been slowly manipulated and tested and brainwashed, who go out and kill and bomb and do all these things for the end justifies the means.
[02:37:11.045 --> 02:37:15.907]  And they've got to do this for the greater good and they're totally under a delusion.
[02:37:17.347 --> 02:37:24.709]  And so they're just trying to get them ready now and get them to accept the end of Pasa Kamantanas and that we've got to do assassinations domestically.
[02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:29.951]  Men, if we don't get control of this country, the ZX12 super virus will be released.
[02:37:30.683 --> 02:37:34.728]  Uh, that some terrorist has, and then America's gonna be killed, and everybody on the planet.
[02:37:35.088 --> 02:37:40.394]  Now, men, are you ready to go out and kill, you know, this radio talk show host that won't shut up?
[02:37:41.195 --> 02:37:42.456]  Then that's when that happens.
[02:37:43.016 --> 02:37:44.158]  And they feel good about it.
[02:37:44.198 --> 02:37:45.079]  They're brainwashed.
[02:37:45.499 --> 02:37:51.726]  What they don't know is the ZX12Q, uh, retrovirus, that's a fictional virus, but it'll have the NSA hopping,
[02:37:52.299 --> 02:38:01.406]  You know, it has been given to an operative, Habib Shamed Gazout, made-up name, I'm just being sarcastic here, uh, who, if they want to release it, they will.
[02:38:02.667 --> 02:38:03.888]  You understand that, folks?
[02:38:04.068 --> 02:38:05.229]  Order out of chaos.
[02:38:05.529 --> 02:38:18.139]  If you love the country, if you love your family, if you love the truth, it's gonna take having the strength to go, my country's been totally hijacked by a bunch of slick scammers who, in their off hours, kneel before Lucifer.
[02:38:18.459 --> 02:38:19.340]  I mean, I'm sorry!
[02:38:20.229 --> 02:38:21.330]  The devil is cunning.
[02:38:21.370 --> 02:38:22.831]  He is slick.
[02:38:22.891 --> 02:38:23.852]  He is deceptive.
[02:38:24.192 --> 02:38:26.233]  Look at what he's done through his operatives.
[02:38:29.796 --> 02:38:30.556]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:38:30.616 --> 02:38:31.757]  The text has all the documents.
[02:38:32.197 --> 02:38:33.898]  I've got boxes of documents.
[02:38:33.958 --> 02:38:38.101]  It is admitted the CIA, starting in the 50s, started radicalizing the Muslims.
[02:38:38.642 --> 02:38:39.842]  Radicalizing the Jews.
[02:38:40.243 --> 02:38:41.383]  And they weren't through there.
[02:38:41.644 --> 02:38:44.285]  They came in and created the fake televangelists.
[02:38:44.686 --> 02:38:45.966]  They came in and funded them.
[02:38:46.006 --> 02:38:47.688]  These are officers in the U.S.
[02:38:47.728 --> 02:38:48.168]  government.
[02:38:50.057 --> 02:38:52.358]  And they get the hundreds of millions of dollars while they're at it.
[02:38:52.839 --> 02:38:59.822]  And they march around and tell you to lay down and they act like a bunch of kooks and make Christians look stupid and run all those charlatan scams.
[02:39:02.244 --> 02:39:04.105]  And they just get away with it.
[02:39:04.825 --> 02:39:09.668]  And they tell Christians lay down and go along with the government and go along with whatever Israel wants to do.
[02:39:09.728 --> 02:39:12.009]  It's sophisticated!
[02:39:12.029 --> 02:39:14.630]  What, you don't think the devil wouldn't target the churches?
[02:39:14.890 --> 02:39:17.812]  You think the devil wouldn't put out false leaders and false prophets?
[02:39:19.309 --> 02:39:21.010]  And again, you don't believe in the devil, some of you.
[02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.331]  Fine!
[02:39:21.491 --> 02:39:25.314]  You don't think the government wouldn't try to take over religion because it's a powerful way to control people?
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:35.402]  Man, the globalists want to bring you hell!
[02:39:35.982 --> 02:39:37.444]  They want to bring you death!
[02:39:37.524 --> 02:39:39.926]  They want to bring you sorrow!
[02:39:40.306 --> 02:39:41.407]  That's what they do!
[02:39:41.607 --> 02:39:42.588]  That's who they are!
[02:39:42.788 --> 02:39:43.909]  That's their nature!
[02:39:45.606 --> 02:39:49.769]  And you weren't taught history, so you don't know that's the rule!
[02:39:50.470 --> 02:40:03.440]  You live in this... You know, we're so spoiled since World War II, and the two-car garage, and the big houses, and the swimming pools, and the slits, and the burgers on the grill, man, and I'm going on vacation, and everything's fine, and I don't want to hear it!
[02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:09.985]  And it's under that atmosphere of incredible decas and incredible plenty that liberty brought us
[02:40:11.368 --> 02:40:24.301]  That we have been enslaved in a bunch of slick advertisement technologies created by Edward Bernays and others has been used to totally scramble our brains!
[02:40:25.241 --> 02:40:29.846]  You know, you tell the average person on the street, you know there's subliminal mind control all over TV.
[02:40:30.487 --> 02:40:31.267]  They'll laugh at you.
[02:40:31.467 --> 02:40:32.168]  But you go to UT
[02:40:34.486 --> 02:40:40.488]  And you take advertising courses, or you go to Stanford and take an advertising course, advanced graduate courses, it's admitted.
[02:40:40.888 --> 02:40:41.909]  It's all subliminal.
[02:40:42.769 --> 02:40:43.229]  On TV.
[02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:46.190]  The nationally produced stuff.
[02:40:46.430 --> 02:40:50.692]  All that orange and blue mist on Fox and CNN, with weird letters and stuff in it.
[02:40:51.012 --> 02:41:01.776]  All the time, graduate students are pausing it and freezing it and slowing it down, and it's submit, buy, Satan, blood, murder, sacrifice, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil!
[02:41:02.572 --> 02:41:03.233]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[02:41:03.273 --> 02:41:03.713]  Google it.
[02:41:03.933 --> 02:41:05.314]  LexisNexis it, reporters.
[02:41:05.534 --> 02:41:06.815]  You'll pull up Times of London.
[02:41:07.175 --> 02:41:11.078]  You know, Toyota is in trouble for running ads calling for child sacrifice in Europe.
[02:41:13.579 --> 02:41:15.320]  Film students slowed it down and caught it.
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:25.347]  I mean, it's just taught in the textbooks, but I tell you on the street, hey, uh, by the way, see, it isn't just subliminals to buy buyer, or, you know, subliminals at the movie theater that aren't you hungry, go buy some popcorn.
[02:41:26.888 --> 02:41:27.668]  And a Coca-Cola.
[02:41:28.209 --> 02:41:30.210]  It's devil, Satan, drink the blood.
[02:41:31.337 --> 02:41:33.122]  Devil, Satan, drink the blood!
[02:41:33.442 --> 02:41:35.247]  See how weird it sounds when I say it in full speed?
[02:41:35.507 --> 02:41:37.011]  Devil, Satan, drink the blood!
[02:41:37.031 --> 02:41:37.953]  You're like, I'm in no way!
[02:41:38.743 --> 02:42:07.568]  See, it's devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan drink the blood, devil satan
[02:42:08.351 --> 02:42:11.152]  We just say that because it's shocking and it gets them to pay attention.
[02:42:12.212 --> 02:42:17.854]  Well, you could use a quick image of the roar of a lion and the flashing of a lion on somebody to arouse them.
[02:42:18.074 --> 02:42:19.955]  And that's still manipulative and sneaky.
[02:42:20.115 --> 02:42:21.956]  Why does it always have to be devil, Satan, drink the blood?
[02:42:23.956 --> 02:42:24.517]  Kill the baby.
[02:42:26.257 --> 02:42:30.659]  Why do the Walmart toys say kill, kill, kill, die, die, commit suicide?
[02:42:30.739 --> 02:42:31.639]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[02:42:31.659 --> 02:42:33.400]  The Walmart toys, some of them?
[02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:34.900]  Oh, you didn't know about that.
[02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:36.101]  Just type it into Google.
[02:42:36.121 --> 02:42:37.181]  You'll get Associated Press.
[02:42:38.732 --> 02:42:42.413]  These people are like trying to resonate and bring something over.
[02:42:42.433 --> 02:42:45.755]  They believe that they're turning this into hell, that hell is paradise.
[02:42:45.795 --> 02:42:48.476]  They're psychopathic crazies, okay?
[02:42:48.816 --> 02:42:50.156]  No matter how you look at it.
[02:42:53.217 --> 02:42:54.678]  That said about a hundred times faster than that.
[02:42:54.918 --> 02:42:55.938]  Devil, Satan, drink the blood.
[02:42:56.078 --> 02:42:57.399]  I mean, stuff like that, folks.
[02:42:58.109 --> 02:43:09.853]  When you let your child sit there and watch the supposed most Christian program you can imagine, they can broadcast through the bandwidth images over it that the original producers didn't even put on it.
[02:43:12.014 --> 02:43:14.094]  Do not let your children watch television.
[02:43:15.675 --> 02:43:20.897]  I mean, you will put your children in front of something that since the fifties they've been using subliminal messages on.
[02:43:23.198 --> 02:43:24.058]  Ah, you don't believe me.
[02:43:24.598 --> 02:43:25.158]  You know what?
[02:43:25.178 --> 02:43:25.818]  Just don't believe me.
[02:43:25.858 --> 02:43:26.579]  Everything's fine.
[02:43:26.599 --> 02:43:27.499]  Just worship the government.
[02:43:28.047 --> 02:43:28.828]  Everything's good.
[02:43:30.069 --> 02:43:30.889]  Oh, man.
[02:43:30.929 --> 02:43:33.051]  The incredible thing is it's admitted.
[02:43:34.592 --> 02:43:39.015]  I run into people that go, I don't believe in the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and the Bilderberg Group.
[02:43:39.075 --> 02:43:44.239]  And I go, well, they're openly calling for world government in their own publications.
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:50.264]  Then finally they'll see them on TV call for it and they go, well, maybe we need a world government, Alex.
[02:43:50.604 --> 02:43:51.765]  That's the mind control.
[02:43:52.385 --> 02:43:54.587]  Accepting something doesn't give you power over it.
[02:43:56.038 --> 02:44:00.060]  You know, the old Japanese saying of, if rape's inevitable, go ahead and enjoy it.
[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:04.922]  Well, this isn't rape being inevitable, this is having your freedoms destroyed, your head chopped off.
[02:44:06.283 --> 02:44:07.844]  And if it's inevitable, don't enjoy it.
[02:44:07.944 --> 02:44:08.985]  Fight, fight, fight!
[02:44:09.025 --> 02:44:09.825]  It's not inevitable.
[02:44:11.546 --> 02:44:17.869]  And I know a lot of you aren't believing me, so just type in subliminal messaging into Google, or type in subliminal messaging, satanic subliminal messaging.
[02:44:17.889 --> 02:44:24.012]  You know, as Bush said, uh, you know, we're talking about subliminal messages.
[02:44:24.652 --> 02:44:25.653]  He invented a new word.
[02:44:26.394 --> 02:44:30.638]  Subdiminable or something, but... And Nigeria is a very important continent.
[02:44:31.258 --> 02:44:36.102]  But, uh... We gotta catapult the propaganda.
[02:44:36.142 --> 02:44:36.943]  Bush said that too.
[02:44:36.963 --> 02:44:40.306]  We gotta keep repeating it to catapult the propaganda over them.
[02:44:40.826 --> 02:44:41.066]  What?
[02:44:41.587 --> 02:44:42.968]  Yeah, to brainwash us.
[02:44:43.989 --> 02:44:45.110]  Look, we can win.
[02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:46.191]  We're not gonna submit.
[02:44:46.551 --> 02:44:47.512]  You're gonna lose.
[02:44:47.812 --> 02:44:49.173]  And that isn't just propaganda.
[02:44:49.193 --> 02:44:49.834]  That's the truth.
[02:44:51.027 --> 02:44:51.767]  See, that's the difference.
[02:44:51.787 --> 02:44:54.008]  They've got their mountains of slick lies and packaging.
[02:44:54.048 --> 02:44:58.749]  But our unpolished truth just is like anti-matter to them.
[02:44:59.090 --> 02:45:00.830]  It just blows giant holes in them.
[02:45:00.850 --> 02:45:02.271]  They're scared to death of us!
[02:45:02.951 --> 02:45:04.611]  Do you realize how much power we've got?
[02:45:04.891 --> 02:45:07.832]  What they see when they see us when we've got the sword of the Lord?
[02:45:08.152 --> 02:45:10.093]  It's like a gigantic monster to them.
[02:45:10.573 --> 02:45:12.294]  They run screaming in fear.
[02:45:12.334 --> 02:45:14.134]  They are scared to death of us.
[02:45:15.195 --> 02:45:19.476]  But again, they fool and they bamboozle most people.
[02:45:20.396 --> 02:45:32.641]  Alright, look, I told him the whole eons ago, John in Tennessee, he brought up this thing about Bennett saying, saying blacks, uh, all I saw on the AP and the clip I heard on the web was him saying, oh no, that's despicable.
[02:45:32.981 --> 02:45:35.682]  I didn't know he was saying despicable after he heard what he'd said.
[02:45:35.702 --> 02:45:41.944]  If that quote's right, that he said earlier, oh no, it's, you know, basically a good thing, then that is horrible.
[02:45:42.125 --> 02:45:43.305]  But go ahead and finish up, John.
[02:45:43.765 --> 02:45:48.147]  Yeah, the caller had called in and said that the media was covering up the fact that, um,
[02:45:48.942 --> 02:45:49.463]  That's great.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:08.122]  And then it was like, well, maybe, maybe, but you don't know the cause, and I think abortion is a disproportionate... So he was showing his true colors as a social engineer.
[02:46:08.302 --> 02:46:09.362]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:46:09.402 --> 02:46:21.404]  And you're right, the media is only pushing the black-white issue, but there's a... But he... Well, see, I only heard the clip where he was kind of backtracking, and they acted like, again, it's media deception.
[02:46:21.785 --> 02:46:22.045]  Right.
[02:46:22.065 --> 02:46:23.285]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:46:23.325 --> 02:46:24.205]  I really appreciate it.
[02:46:24.305 --> 02:46:25.705]  Lynn, Lynn Oklahoma's gone.
[02:46:25.765 --> 02:46:28.566]  Up next is... Who's up next?
[02:46:30.248 --> 02:46:31.088]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:46:31.108 --> 02:46:31.769]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:46:32.129 --> 02:46:32.869]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:46:33.089 --> 02:46:36.971]  I've got a news article on the radio that I just heard the other day.
[02:46:37.011 --> 02:46:41.813]  The FBI is doing background checks and digital thumb scanning for the refugees from the hurricane.
[02:46:41.873 --> 02:46:43.914]  And I was just flipped out when I heard that.
[02:46:44.434 --> 02:46:46.595]  Yeah, any reason to get you in the databases?
[02:46:47.035 --> 02:46:49.396]  Any reason to get you in the databases and the roundups?
[02:46:49.856 --> 02:46:50.836]  And this is just incredible.
[02:46:50.856 --> 02:46:57.539]  Well, I mean, look, we defeated the bill to put transponders in all the cars, and techs just turned around and ordered millions of them.
[02:46:57.739 --> 02:46:58.860]  You know, they're criminal.
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:46:59.880]  They're not stopping.
[02:47:00.478 --> 02:47:05.719]  Yeah, they're absolutely criminals, and I've also noticed a lot of military recruiters everywhere.
[02:47:05.759 --> 02:47:09.740]  They're in these skateboard parks, the malls, everywhere.
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:18.662]  Yeah, what they do is, they go find young foolish kids, and they offer them, well there's articles, money, sex, they're bringing in prostitutes for them.
[02:47:19.002 --> 02:47:24.504]  I'm not kidding folks, this was in the news over the weekend, bringing in whores.
[02:47:24.544 --> 02:47:27.284]  Just sign it, just sign it, you're going to get a big recruiting bonus.
[02:47:28.965 --> 02:47:30.145]  Or they threaten to arrest them.
[02:47:30.797 --> 02:47:32.538]  They tell them, you'll be arrested if you don't sign.
[02:47:32.578 --> 02:47:36.340]  These poor kids whose parents are, you know, off at the bar drunk or whatever.
[02:47:36.701 --> 02:47:40.503]  Just let their... I mean, folks, you should let a recruiter get within a hundred yards of your child.
[02:47:41.904 --> 02:47:42.344]  Exactly.
[02:47:42.644 --> 02:47:43.064]  Exactly.
[02:47:43.084 --> 02:47:46.026]  You know, and I just... The thing is, they're all over the high schools.
[02:47:46.046 --> 02:47:47.127]  They're just everywhere.
[02:47:47.227 --> 02:47:59.394]  Look, they make the kids here in Austin at some of the high schools, multiple high schools now we've learned, wear a badge around their neck and it's an Army Recruiting Lariat about almost an inch wide saying, you know, Army of One and all this stuff.
[02:48:00.566 --> 02:48:03.067]  They make the kids wear necklaces that say Army.
[02:48:04.108 --> 02:48:04.788]  It's incredible.
[02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:05.789]  Incredible.
[02:48:06.369 --> 02:48:11.192]  Some of the kids I've talked to are aware of what's going on with the Iraq War.
[02:48:11.212 --> 02:48:13.693]  They know what's going on, but there's a lot of them that need to be waking up.
[02:48:14.394 --> 02:48:16.715]  It's just like the slave ships of old.
[02:48:17.636 --> 02:48:21.098]  They truck a lot of people onto those ships in many cases.
[02:48:24.173 --> 02:48:27.714]  The old British press gangs, they just go around grabbing people off the street.
[02:48:27.994 --> 02:48:28.794]  Anything else, sir?
[02:48:29.154 --> 02:48:36.536]  Yeah, I just wanted to say to the people out there, if you don't think this is real, I used to be a non-believer, but I got in here and started thinking to see what the globalists are really doing.
[02:48:36.596 --> 02:48:37.196]  It's real, folks.
[02:48:37.956 --> 02:48:38.696]  Oh, it is real!
[02:48:39.397 --> 02:48:41.417]  And denying it doesn't make it go away, by the way.
[02:48:46.972 --> 02:48:49.835]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.096 --> 02:48:51.677]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.018 --> 02:48:56.703]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.024 --> 02:49:01.469]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.889 --> 02:49:06.054]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.274 --> 02:49:09.115]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.195 --> 02:49:13.857]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.057 --> 02:49:18.499]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.719 --> 02:49:25.941]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.181 --> 02:49:28.602]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:46.465 --> 02:49:51.670]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:59.917]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.177 --> 02:50:07.223]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:14.668]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.848 --> 02:50:19.932]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:20.052 --> 02:50:28.938]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:29.198 --> 02:50:32.481]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:02.905 --> 02:51:03.526]  I think so.
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:23.580]  I think so.
[02:51:53.351 --> 02:51:56.352]  There's something historical, a fact, that you cannot deny.
[02:51:57.692 --> 02:51:58.933]  Elites become decadent.
[02:52:00.033 --> 02:52:01.834]  They become power-mad.
[02:52:02.574 --> 02:52:04.514]  They do horrible, sickening things.
[02:52:05.035 --> 02:52:11.517]  That is the experience in the vast, vast, vast majority of societies.
[02:52:13.737 --> 02:52:18.279]  And then they're real good at making the people, brainwashing the people in many cases, to worship and love the abuse.
[02:52:18.299 --> 02:52:19.539]  Well, I'm not putting up with it.
[02:52:20.208 --> 02:52:21.449]  And I'm not going along with it.
[02:52:21.509 --> 02:52:25.233]  And I know the globalists are the authors of much of the misery and corruption.
[02:52:25.253 --> 02:52:31.800]  They actually generate it to create the crisis so they can offer their abomination solution.
[02:52:33.041 --> 02:52:36.245]  I hope you'll visit PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:52:36.265 --> 02:52:39.047]  I mean, there's so much news there on the sites every day.
[02:52:40.169 --> 02:52:41.430]  Britain recruited terrorists.
[02:52:42.085 --> 02:52:45.808]  Member of Parliament documents in London Guardian, Asian News.
[02:52:47.049 --> 02:52:51.853]  He just goes through example after example of our government, their government, being involved in terrorism.
[02:52:53.355 --> 02:52:55.396]  An incredible article that Paul and I put together.
[02:52:55.437 --> 02:52:56.758]  I should have read this in the first hour.
[02:52:56.818 --> 02:52:57.578]  I might tomorrow.
[02:52:57.598 --> 02:52:59.580]  But, Will Israel Start World War III?
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:00.861]  I should have read this on air.
[02:53:02.242 --> 02:53:03.784]  And finish the setup the U.S.
[02:53:03.824 --> 02:53:06.786]  started by radicalizing and arming Iran in the first place.
[02:53:07.267 --> 02:53:08.608]  You need to read this article.
[02:53:08.668 --> 02:53:09.749]  Everybody needs to see this.
[02:53:10.814 --> 02:53:12.975]  I mean, we're getting really close right now.
[02:53:12.995 --> 02:53:16.737]  And the BBC comes out with a big whitewash about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:53:16.797 --> 02:53:19.818]  Yeah, they push world government, but so what?
[02:53:19.878 --> 02:53:21.999]  They just want to give you peace and love.
[02:53:22.599 --> 02:53:29.242]  Inside the secretive Bilderberg Group, how much influence do private networks, the rich and powerful, have on government policies?
[02:53:29.522 --> 02:53:30.043]  Gee, I wonder.
[02:53:30.063 --> 02:53:31.723]  They get corporate welfare from the government.
[02:53:32.123 --> 02:53:33.224]  Would they want to have influence?
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:39.043]  One group, the Bilderberg Group, has often attracted speculation that it forms a shadowy global government.
[02:53:39.063 --> 02:53:43.385]  Well, we've stolen their corporate minutes about, what, 15 times or something?
[02:53:44.526 --> 02:53:46.167]  Next year, the wall will fall.
[02:53:47.228 --> 02:53:50.210]  We will not invade in March of 2002, as we've told the public.
[02:53:50.250 --> 02:53:51.470]  It will be March of 2003.
[02:53:51.770 --> 02:53:52.731]  Order Bush now.
[02:53:53.231 --> 02:54:01.596]  You know, let me tell people, it's not like... As part of the BBC's Who Runs the World series, Bill Hayton tries to find out more.
[02:54:02.757 --> 02:54:04.058]  The chairman of the secretive
[02:54:04.954 --> 02:54:06.695]  He prefers the word private.
[02:54:06.795 --> 02:54:09.596]  Bilderberg is 73-year-old by his count.
[02:54:10.616 --> 02:54:11.436]  And it goes on.
[02:54:11.496 --> 02:54:12.937]  I mean, just come on!
[02:54:13.017 --> 02:54:14.237]  It's just all in your face!
[02:54:14.257 --> 02:54:18.359]  I used to hear Rush Limbaugh 12, 15 years ago before I totally woke up.
[02:54:18.879 --> 02:54:21.580]  Oh, and the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist, only not to talk about it.
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:24.561]  I mean, I've heard it come out of his fat mouth.
[02:54:25.221 --> 02:54:28.762]  His books are published by the CFR, by one of their imprints.
[02:54:30.023 --> 02:54:31.763]  Military Occupied U.S.
[02:54:32.384 --> 02:54:33.244]  James Tucker gets it.
[02:54:34.295 --> 02:54:38.358]  Army to take control during national crises, exactly as we've been saying.
[02:54:38.398 --> 02:54:40.659]  I mean, this is the other shoe drop.
[02:54:40.699 --> 02:54:43.541]  And you know, I wanted to go to Alex and Mass and many others that we're holding.
[02:54:44.581 --> 02:54:45.482]  We're just out of time.
[02:54:45.782 --> 02:54:49.704]  Be sure and join us back tonight, 9 to midnight Central and back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.

[02:54:57.609 --> 02:55:00.151]  The DVDs, the VHS, whatever format you want it in.

[02:55:21.649 --> 02:55:24.751]  The really good videos will be discounted.
[02:55:24.791 --> 02:55:26.413]  Because we want to get this out to people.
[02:55:26.813 --> 02:55:29.155]  And secondarily, it makes this broadcast possible.
[02:55:30.029 --> 02:55:37.631]  I mean, I plug just enough to support what we're doing, and I really should plug more, because such a big part of our fight is these videos.
