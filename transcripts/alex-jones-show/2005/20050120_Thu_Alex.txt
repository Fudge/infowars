[00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:06.283]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.943 --> 00:00:07.984]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:09.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:12.905]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:21.888]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:43.939]  Well, my friends, it is the 20th day of January 2005, and I guess we can all celebrate!
[00:00:45.219 --> 00:01:03.386]  George Walker Bush was just sworn in a few minutes ago, and he laid his hand on the Bible, and he swore to protect and defend and uphold the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:06.253]  And of course, no one in U.S.
[00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:12.196]  history has ever dismantled the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:23.961]  No one has trampled on it, chewed holes in it, used it as birdcage liner like the little retarded chimpanzee.
[00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:28.308]  And we've got stacks of news.
[00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:30.369]  His new agenda will be gun control.
[00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.510]  I actually have the mainstream news here.
[00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.871]  He's now making his announcements.
[00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:39.954]  Gun control, amnesty, a bunch of new forms of regulation and taxation.
[00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:48.698]  And Hillary Clinton has come out in support of him with a faith-based initiative to take over the churches with federal money.
[00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.320]  I'm sure you think that's very conservative out there listening.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.604]  And Bill Clinton, they're announcing, is such good special friends with him and his father now.
[00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:02.066]  They were always friends back to the mean Arkansas days.
[00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.671]  But George W. Bush is just a puppet.
[00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:11.273]  That's all he is.
[00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:25.884]  Karl Rove is a strategist, but he still just takes his orders from the big corporations that are not free market, that are organized crime syndicates, that want big government to confiscate our wealth.
[00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:31.687]  And watching it this morning, the streets were dead.
[00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:32.808]  There was no one there.
[00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:41.713]  Only people who had passes to get in, kind of the camp followers, you know, the vandals,
[00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:50.840]  Or the Huns would have their camp followers, their minions, their women, their slaves, following them.
[00:02:52.301 --> 00:03:10.633]  So other than the train of slaves and minions and bottom feeders and parasite lords and mafia kings that were there in attendance as Julius Caesar was coronated, inaugurated,
[00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.965]  Worshipped, crowned, given his scepter.
[00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:26.331]  I mean, I remember watching many other inaugurations, and there'd be protesters all the way down the roads, there'd be demonstrations.
[00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:40.420]  When Bush was elected back in 2000, or put into office in 2000, there were people throwing eggs and screaming all the way up the roads.
[00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:46.116]  Not this time, because you're not allowed to for security reasons.
[00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:48.857]  Oh, you've still got a First Amendment.
[00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:52.318]  Just no protest on the armored tank.
[00:03:52.818 --> 00:04:01.520]  I wish our troops had armor like that on the, you know, four-inch thick titanium armored Cadillac.
[00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.321]  Just incredible.
[00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:16.859]  So, look at that scene, but the incredible thing was, I had a couple TVs going, a couple different DVRs recording and VHS recording different channels.
[00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.001]  I was watching two or three different TVs, and no one was showing protesters.
[00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:24.581]  The media wasn't talking about them.
[00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.202]  They weren't giving any coverage because they were miles and miles away.
[00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:37.345]  And even there, no crosses allowed, no anti-war signs allowed,
[00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:45.959]  There were just thousands and thousands of Praetorian Guard and military in their black berets.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.621]  Military, by the way, was commanding the whole thing.
[00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:57.425]  Just, oh, a triumphant arch for our Emperor, and you don't have to look at one person that doesn't like you, because you're such a gun grabber.
[00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:05.517]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.697 --> 00:05:10.121]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.262 --> 00:05:14.646]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:16.028]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:22.048]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.108 --> 00:05:29.050]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.210]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:41.892]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:44.293]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:47.556]  My new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:12.890]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:20.118]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:26.620]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.000]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:31.282]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:33.462]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:41.005]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.890]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.493]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:56.894]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.733 --> 00:08:14.874]  Alright, my friends, it is Thursday, the 20th day of January 2004.
[00:08:15.174 --> 00:08:16.994]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:30.017]  Coming up later in this hour, we've got one of the scientists who has been developing these AI computers that will watch you via cameras in your car.
[00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:34.898]  And if you're not a good globalist, they will report you to Big Brother.
[00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:39.719]  And the source is the Times of London, the
[00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.912]  Houston Chronicle, the Associated Press, Ergonomics Today.
[00:08:43.932 --> 00:08:50.338]  I have stacks of these articles and the government's really moving forward in England and the U.S.
[00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:59.868]  to where we will drive around in our cars watched by these on-board computers that are hooked into the police department.
[00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:02.090]  So, that's your freedom.
[00:09:02.868 --> 00:09:12.014]  And watching the inauguration ceremony, and why don't you look up inauguration in a 25-year-old, 20-year-old dictionary.
[00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:14.516]  I think you might find that interesting.
[00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:19.559]  But magical ceremony calling up power.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:30.987]  But we have new definitions for you today, just like a 10-year-old dictionary says a communitarian is someone who promotes communist forms of government.
[00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:37.588]  But, uh, starting about nine years ago, we noticed the dictionary say, one who promotes communities.
[00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:40.871]  One that promotes community action.
[00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:42.873]  And all these sweet little things.
[00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:44.875]  And Bush calls himself a communitarian.
[00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:48.138]  That's what he called himself in the 2000 election.
[00:09:48.378 --> 00:09:51.461]  Still calls himself, describes himself a communitarian.
[00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:55.757]  And I think all of this is really kind of an inside joke.
[00:09:56.158 --> 00:10:05.392]  I'm not saying Bush is really a communist, but they give themselves little terms like this just to, kind of an inside joke to laugh at how stupid we are.
[00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:07.939]  I wouldn't even call Bush a fascist.
[00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:10.181]  I'd call him a feudal puppet.
[00:10:10.742 --> 00:10:12.603]  A puppet of our feudal owners.
[00:10:13.043 --> 00:10:24.412]  Because communism, fascism, these are all terms that we were given to confuse us and to make us think we had choices in what form of command and control government we were going to have.
[00:10:25.393 --> 00:10:28.916]  Let's see what his lordship is saying right now.
[00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:31.177]  Oh!
[00:10:31.758 --> 00:10:32.278]  Clapping!
[00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:33.119]  Oh!
[00:10:35.612 --> 00:10:36.973]  Millions more will find it.
[00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:41.256]  By our efforts we have lit a fire as well.
[00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.479]  A fire in the minds of men.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.881]  It warms those who feel its power.
[00:10:49.022 --> 00:10:51.284]  It burns those who fight its progress.
[00:10:52.144 --> 00:10:58.529]  And one day, the untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.
[00:11:06.252 --> 00:11:08.772]  Americans have accepted the hardest duty in this cause.
[00:11:10.193 --> 00:11:12.553]  The quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy.
[00:11:13.653 --> 00:11:16.394]  The idealistic work of helping raise up free governments.
[00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:20.315]  The dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies.
[00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:27.716]  Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives.
[00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:33.377]  And we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.
[00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:37.181]  All right.
[00:11:38.762 --> 00:11:43.923]  And again, we're streaming that off the web, so I think it's buffering there, little cutouts you were hearing.
[00:11:44.643 --> 00:11:52.325]  And coming up later in the broadcast today, I will play some more clips of his speech and analyze it.
[00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:58.887]  We're also going to play Lord Bush and Lord Cheney giving their oath of office.
[00:12:00.007 --> 00:12:01.928]  Saying, oh yes, I will protect and defend it.
[00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:02.988]  The Constitution.
[00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:22.658]  You'd have to be hiding in a mineshaft somewhere in the deepest recesses with a bunch of cave bugs to not know that the Constitution has been opened up like somebody took a can opener to it.
[00:12:24.298 --> 00:12:25.239]  It's amazing!
[00:12:27.054 --> 00:12:45.371]  Unspeakable how across the board this morning listening to the singers, the speakers, it was all about freedom and liberty and the individual spirit and how God loves us and looks down on our great leader.
[00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:52.578]  And I sat there in just abject disgust watching several different television sets
[00:12:54.289 --> 00:13:04.695]  This morning, and every time they would say the word God, which they said over and over again, God protect us, God come to our aid, they kept cutting to Bush.
[00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:06.636]  I'm sure you saw this.
[00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:16.803]  They kept cutting to him, you know, driving in the car or sitting there in the review stands just minutes before we went on air.
[00:13:17.203 --> 00:13:21.165]  Every time they'd say God, which was about every 60 seconds, they would cut to Bush.
[00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.113]  Implying it's our God.
[00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:33.780]  And by the way, I've even heard promos on so-called Christian stations over the years where they talk about, God protects us.
[00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:35.441]  God loves us.
[00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.424]  And they would play clips of George Bush speaking.
[00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:42.467]  And at the end of it, they'd go, He's our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:49.333]  And left it open to the fact that perhaps God is George Bush.
[00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:52.579]  I mean, I notice this stuff.
[00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:53.819]  Do you notice this stuff?
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:04.044]  So they're up there with all these nice songs and all this regalia and the protesters, nowhere to be seen.
[00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:12.108]  In 2000, there were tens of thousands of people protesting, throwing eggs, knocking down police barricades.
[00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:18.651]  I have the video of the armored vehicle that Bush and other presidents drive around in covered in eggs.
[00:14:20.077 --> 00:14:31.760]  Not this time, it was just walls of police and plainclothes security people and military lined up as he drove down to the Capitol.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.741]  No more going down the parade route.
[00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:44.444]  Can't do that, but then, even more curiously, I started flipping around all the channels, MSNBC, Fox, CNN, and they didn't show the protesters.
[00:14:45.222 --> 00:14:57.670]  And then I went online and typed in protesters at inauguration and there were the Indymedia sites already with the photos, already up with thousands of protesters, but they're all kept back, they're all kept miles away, can't see them!
[00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:13.540]  And even those that have tickets to get up, you know, a mile away from El Capital, outside the main inner security room around the Capitol itself, where, you know, even the throngs of minions are held back, no crosses, no nothing.
[00:15:15.563 --> 00:15:16.523]  Just amazing!
[00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:34.831]  But we tuned into what Bush was saying just randomly and it was about hope and fire burning in our minds and the fire is going to spread and warm those that submit to it and burn those that don't.
[00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:42.954]  Why, George Bush wants to stop babies being killed everywhere and kill terrorists everywhere.
[00:15:42.994 --> 00:15:44.635]  That's kind of a little slogan.
[00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:49.486]  You know, he quadruples abortion funding for the U.N., cuts a small U.N.
[00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:54.968]  abortion program, overall it was tripled, and then they hail it as stopping abortion!
[00:15:56.469 --> 00:16:01.270]  Or he appoints a bunch of judges who openly want to ban guns, and it's hailed as conservative!
[00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:05.312]  You know, don't confuse you with the facts!
[00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:08.593]  Don't confuse us with the facts!
[00:16:11.252 --> 00:16:15.774]  Just absolutely amazing to watch it.
[00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:18.335]  I watched hours of it.
[00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:25.758]  Everything was liberty and freedom and God and we're Christian and we're good and we're standing up against evil.
[00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.739]  And then you look at what's really happening.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.260]  It's the complete opposite.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:39.944]  And then I would watch the cameras in the stands and there was John Ashcroft, there was Alberto Gonzalez, there was Claudelisa Rice,
[00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:51.916]  Watching CSPAN, the Bush daughters were swaggering through the Capitol, and they were walking by cameras, and I've got it on video, just giving them the most ugly, arrogant looks.
[00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:59.881]  And Bush looking so arrogant and pompous, and his father and his mother strutting around.
[00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:02.083]  We now have hereditary leaders.
[00:17:04.201 --> 00:17:08.784]  And if you tuned in for the first time, you're going, oh, you must like John Kerry!
[00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:10.905]  It was all staged.
[00:17:11.005 --> 00:17:14.407]  I don't like either one of the fighters in a staged fight.
[00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:23.512]  Not the one that takes the dive, and I really don't like the one that stands up there and gets his gloves raised and worshipped as the heavyweight champ.
[00:17:26.074 --> 00:17:30.036]  I don't like frauds, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:33.758]  I don't like somebody who's afraid of horses.
[00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:35.119]  Who runs... literally!
[00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:36.940]  Vicente Fox shows up.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.781]  Boy, they're real cowboys down there in Mexico.
[00:17:39.402 --> 00:17:41.243]  That guy's got a bunch of ranches and horses.
[00:17:41.263 --> 00:17:44.185]  You know, even if he's a horrible guy, at least he's the real deal.
[00:17:44.205 --> 00:17:48.809]  He walks around in a cowboy hat and said, let's go riding!
[00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:52.592]  This was in the news years ago and Bush said, I don't have any horses.
[00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:53.572]  I don't like them.
[00:17:53.612 --> 00:17:54.293]  I'm afraid of them.
[00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.374]  And Fox is like, excuse me?
[00:17:57.715 --> 00:17:58.696]  Excuse me?
[00:18:00.893 --> 00:18:02.655]  Folks, he's terrified of horses!
[00:18:03.976 --> 00:18:06.237]  He's from Kennebunkport, Maine.
[00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:10.560]  They were Tories in the Revolutionary War against America.
[00:18:13.162 --> 00:18:14.983]  They're trash, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:16.024 --> 00:18:16.624]  Trash.
[00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:19.086]  Trash.
[00:18:20.387 --> 00:18:21.008]  Trash.
[00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:25.030]  Their family is a mafia family.
[00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:29.934]  They are a crime family by every definition.
[00:18:31.593 --> 00:18:40.135]  And you watch Bush riding around in his giant armored vehicle with three to four inches of armor of titanium.
[00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:46.957]  Reportedly there's even other forms of armor in the vehicle and he doesn't even care about our troops getting armor.
[00:18:49.298 --> 00:18:50.238]  Our troops, I forgot.
[00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:51.619]  They're owned by you.
[00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:53.459]  They belong to you.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.520]  Let's fade it back up and go out to break with our great leader speaking.
[00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:06.404]  History has a flow of justice.
[00:19:06.784 --> 00:19:07.424]  I'm sorry.
[00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:12.046]  You know, that's off the White House website and I guess it's getting too much traffic.
[00:19:12.607 --> 00:19:14.087]  Try to find another feed.
[00:19:14.147 --> 00:19:17.909]  Try another governmental feed.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:22.551]  Maybe try National Archives or something like that will be streaming it.
[00:19:24.315 --> 00:19:27.397]  And we'll get that back up for folks.
[00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:35.262]  Working fine before the broadcast, but I guess a lot of people have started, not from this little show, but from all the other ones, tuning in to his lordship.
[00:19:37.003 --> 00:19:40.445]  The world right now, by the way, is stricken with fear.
[00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:44.308]  America's being demonized, but it's all part of the larger plan.
[00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:47.770]  All part of America playing the part of the bad cop.
[00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.992]  All the UN and the EU play the part of the good cop.
[00:19:52.313 --> 00:19:58.258]  We'll come back and continue our analysis of King George II.
[00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:05.764]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:14.792]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:15.372 --> 00:20:17.114]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:18.435]  While you listen,
[00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:23.773]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:20:24.414 --> 00:20:25.974]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:28.676]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:20:29.256 --> 00:20:31.277]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:32.938]  And it's so easy.
[00:20:33.658 --> 00:20:35.679]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:37.120]  When you want.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.300]  Where you want.
[00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:44.083]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:47.678]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[00:20:47.698 --> 00:20:47.778]  1-800-4419-W.
[00:20:47.798 --> 00:20:48.639]  That's 419WORD.
[00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:48.739]  1-800-419-W.
[00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:05.480]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:11.308]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:12.850]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.876]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:30.860]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.681]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.981 --> 00:21:42.863]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:43.627 --> 00:21:45.428]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.469 --> 00:21:49.651]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:50.091 --> 00:21:50.692]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.752 --> 00:21:52.893]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:52.913 --> 00:21:52.973]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.101]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:08.464]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:22:09.104 --> 00:22:12.966]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:22.251]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:30.409]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:39.452]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:43.053]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.073 --> 00:22:43.854]  That's 1-800-5736.
[00:22:51.118 --> 00:22:51.258]  516-8736.
[00:22:51.278 --> 00:22:51.900]  Call now.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.869]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:04.134]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:08.377]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:11.399]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.001]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:22.828]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:24.369]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:28.712]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:23:29.052 --> 00:23:29.352]  I think so.
[00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:20.124]  Alright, coming up in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up so you can talk about the inauguration, the oath of office to not violate the Constitution, to protect and defend it.
[00:24:21.405 --> 00:24:25.047]  I mean, I guess protecting and defending now means to put something in a meat grinder.
[00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:35.114]  And we did get a good recording of the speech on another feed, so we're going to be playing clips of that as well as the swearing in of Lord Cheney and Lord Bush.
[00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.215]  And then coming up, the conservatism is just getting better and better.
[00:24:38.575 --> 00:24:46.818]  Gonzalez supports assault weapons ban, and he says that he will aggressively try to enforce its repassage.
[00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:51.620]  And he is being supported by the NRA and others, of course.
[00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:57.171]  John Ashcroft claimed that he was against the assault ban unless prescribed by law.
[00:24:57.211 --> 00:25:01.313]  That's saying any two-bit law supersedes the Second Amendment.
[00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:10.157]  I'm sorry, a state police policy or some little federal regulation does not supersede the Second Amendment.
[00:25:10.597 --> 00:25:13.419]  Nothing does but God Almighty.
[00:25:14.259 --> 00:25:16.020]  Do you understand that, you punk?
[00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:20.240]  You little torture weasel, who loves to torture people.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.082]  San Francisco, considering handgun ban, the freedom just continues to spread.
[00:25:25.363 --> 00:25:27.965]  Governor Pataki is very pleased.
[00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:32.629]  UPI, landmark precedent, blames gun manufacturers for firearms deaths.
[00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:33.850]  They now can sue them all.
[00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:37.353]  Thanks to our Republican governor, as usual.
[00:25:38.488 --> 00:25:42.189]  And Cheney thought Iraq would recover quickly because he's totally delusional.
[00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:44.270]  Talking about the Clintons working with the Bushes.
[00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.231]  Senator Clinton urges use of faith-based initiatives.
[00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:52.953]  I told you two years ago the Democrats are going to act like they're against it, but I've been noticing they're really trying to get it passed.
[00:25:53.373 --> 00:25:56.154]  Federal money and regulation brought into all churches.
[00:25:57.048 --> 00:25:58.408]  Talk about no more First Amendment.
[00:25:58.949 --> 00:26:00.789]  On the eve of the Presidential Inauguration, U.S.
[00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:07.691]  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton last night embraced an issue some pundits say helped seal a second term for George W. Bush.
[00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:11.052]  Acceptance of the role of faith in addressing social ills.
[00:26:11.672 --> 00:26:15.573]  She says that she now supports President Bush's faith-based initiative.
[00:26:16.293 --> 00:26:22.095]  Congress shall make no law restricting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.776]  Government isn't supposed to touch religion.
[00:26:27.193 --> 00:26:34.877]  But they're guaranteeing upwards of $9 billion a year to start to pay off the churches.
[00:26:34.977 --> 00:26:40.399]  Boy, your church is going to be a government mouthpiece, just like your state, just like your city.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.581]  Pretty soon, you think you're preachers worshiping the government right now?
[00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:50.864]  There's nothing like the patriotic church of Russia or China or Cuba.
[00:26:51.488 --> 00:26:53.869]  We're gonna have our own boys and girls.
[00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:55.289]  Nine billion to start.
[00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.590]  Five's quite a bit.
[00:26:58.571 --> 00:27:01.151]  Also, a virtual lockdown for Washington.
[00:27:01.211 --> 00:27:02.172]  Again, this is your freedom.
[00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:05.073]  No protesters allowed miles away from it.
[00:27:05.093 --> 00:27:08.214]  Nobody with crosses as well, again.
[00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:11.655]  But we're not violating the Constitution while we're protecting.
[00:27:12.455 --> 00:27:14.376]  We're defending her!
[00:27:15.797 --> 00:27:16.737]  Sure ya are!
[00:27:17.677 --> 00:27:19.358]  And I'm an Easter Bunny from Planet 10.
[00:27:20.757 --> 00:27:23.258]  Folks, this is so painful.
[00:27:25.459 --> 00:27:28.601]  But you didn't think the social architects were stupid, did you?
[00:27:28.641 --> 00:27:35.405]  You didn't... They knew you were a weight to the Democrats and their attempt to take over the government and set up a police state.
[00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:40.727]  And we fought Bill Clinton tooth and nail valiantly, and he was just a corporate stooge.
[00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:44.049]  But George W. got in, didn't he?
[00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:48.552]  And boy, you love that R before his name.
[00:27:48.572 --> 00:27:51.154]  You love the fake cowboy hat.
[00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:56.698]  You love the hay bales of the old tractor that even Fox News admits is part of a set.
[00:27:57.478 --> 00:28:06.425]  He walks around in front of the tractor, talks about how good our boy is, and you just love it.
[00:28:06.605 --> 00:28:07.226]  Oh, I do.
[00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:08.507]  I sure do.
[00:28:08.527 --> 00:28:11.028]  The terrorist detective.
[00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:14.231]  He's got to give up all the freedom now.
[00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.752]  You just love the open borders, total amnesty.
[00:28:18.012 --> 00:28:19.633]  You just love it all, don't you?
[00:28:19.653 --> 00:28:21.114]  Because it doesn't matter.
[00:28:21.154 --> 00:28:22.795]  The country doesn't really matter to you.
[00:28:23.075 --> 00:28:24.896]  Your grandchildren don't really matter to you.
[00:28:25.257 --> 00:28:29.059]  Struttin' around and feelin' like everything's alright.
[00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:31.401]  George W. is a good man.
[00:28:32.181 --> 00:28:33.622]  But George W. is for amnesty.
[00:28:33.722 --> 00:28:34.723]  He's for gun control.
[00:28:35.163 --> 00:28:36.444]  He's for takin' over the churches.
[00:28:37.124 --> 00:28:38.765]  He's for increasing U.N.
[00:28:38.825 --> 00:28:39.866]  funding and UNESCO.
[00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:42.548]  Oh, whatever, communist, you shut up!
[00:28:43.406 --> 00:28:44.627]  But we're losing America!
[00:28:44.687 --> 00:28:46.128]  We're losing our freedoms!
[00:28:46.168 --> 00:28:47.349]  He's out-Clintonin' Clinton!
[00:28:47.629 --> 00:28:52.653]  Clinton's saying he loves him, and they're hanging out, and Hillary's supporting him, and all these big issues!
[00:28:53.033 --> 00:28:54.714]  Oh, whatever, ya liar!
[00:28:56.115 --> 00:28:58.417]  Well, they're torturing women and children in Iraq!
[00:28:58.497 --> 00:28:59.197]  So what?
[00:28:59.398 --> 00:29:00.719]  They're subhuman!
[00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:02.220]  They're not subhuman!
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.561]  Come on, we're in America!
[00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:04.821]  We can't act like this!
[00:29:05.042 --> 00:29:06.423]  It's a war, punk!
[00:29:06.823 --> 00:29:08.784]  Well, they're torturing people in our prisons, too!
[00:29:09.004 --> 00:29:10.165]  God, they deserve it!
[00:29:11.721 --> 00:29:15.365]  But no, most people in the prisons are non-violent offenders and a lot of them are innocent.
[00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:16.886]  Oh, they all say that.
[00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:21.330]  Well, hundreds of crime labs have been caught framing people at the federal and state level.
[00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:23.853]  That don't matter, so what?
[00:29:24.676 --> 00:29:26.318]  But then a month later... Alex!
[00:29:26.518 --> 00:29:27.198]  Can you help me?
[00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:29.360]  My daughter didn't do nothing!
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.863]  And they beat her up!
[00:29:31.883 --> 00:29:33.384]  She's facing 10 years in prison!
[00:29:33.604 --> 00:29:35.246]  She had a bag of marijuana!
[00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:36.407]  Help me, Alex!
[00:29:36.867 --> 00:29:37.908]  Help me!
[00:29:38.188 --> 00:29:38.909]  I was wrong!
[00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:42.892]  I want to do something with my daughter!
[00:29:43.973 --> 00:29:45.755]  They just took my kids!
[00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:46.856]  CPS did!
[00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:47.917]  Help me, Alex!
[00:29:48.137 --> 00:29:48.698]  Help me!
[00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:49.779]  Help me!
[00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:50.639]  George W.!
[00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:51.080]  Help me!
[00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:54.726]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.647 --> 00:29:58.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.394 --> 00:30:04.396]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:09.640]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.263]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:23.469]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:27.292]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:30:27.572 --> 00:30:32.617]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:39.643]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:30:40.123 --> 00:30:40.664]  What about you?
[00:30:41.417 --> 00:30:46.780]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.921]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:49.882]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:01.371 --> 00:31:07.613]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:08.353]  I use it.
[00:31:08.373 --> 00:31:10.694]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[00:31:10.774 --> 00:31:12.555]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie.
[00:31:12.935 --> 00:31:16.916]  And it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[00:31:17.316 --> 00:31:28.401]  And what it is, it's a wedge device, just a small one, that you put underneath your sacrum, and then you get down on it, you put your weight down on it, on the floor, and you let gravity do the work.
[00:31:28.802 --> 00:31:33.984]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away, chiropractors go away, you don't need them anymore.
[00:31:34.304 --> 00:31:35.425]  You gotta give it a try.
[00:31:35.765 --> 00:31:37.946]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[00:31:38.486 --> 00:31:39.787]  We're good to go.
[00:32:01.613 --> 00:32:03.134]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.194 --> 00:32:05.596]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:06.817]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:07.198 --> 00:32:08.399]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:11.161]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.581 --> 00:32:14.984]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.404 --> 00:32:16.245]  Why else would the U.S.
[00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:19.227]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.487 --> 00:32:20.728]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:25.652]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:30.076]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:36.480]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:36.761 --> 00:32:42.865]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:43.725]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:43.966 --> 00:32:49.609]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.692]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.712 --> 00:32:53.252]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:33:17.148 --> 00:33:38.734]  Alright, coming up in the next hour, we're going to air large portions of King George's speech, plus, well, his perjury, or his violation of office when he gets up there with one of the Supreme Court justices and tells the world he's going to uphold the Constitution, protect and defend it.
[00:33:39.214 --> 00:33:40.234]  We're going to play Cheney's
[00:33:41.397 --> 00:33:44.338]  swearing in as well, and take your calls.
[00:33:46.138 --> 00:33:57.861]  But remember last week I read Ergonomics Today, where the big car makers are going to put these infrared cameras in the cars that scan your iris, and they pick up microscopic movements.
[00:33:57.881 --> 00:34:01.542]  It was in the Houston Chronicle a few years ago, and it'll decide if you're tired.
[00:34:02.022 --> 00:34:04.002]  You'll have to retina scan before your car starts.
[00:34:04.602 --> 00:34:07.643]  It'll decide if you're tired, or if you're on drugs.
[00:34:08.483 --> 00:34:15.967]  And then the Ergonomics today reported also that a bunch of big car manufacturers are going to start putting it in new vehicles as early as next year.
[00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:23.210]  And there's moves to perhaps make it the law that's being discussed by the Department of Transportation and the Safety Board.
[00:34:24.133 --> 00:34:26.874]  That these systems will pick up distracted drivers.
[00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:30.556]  If you look away too long, it will warn you three times.
[00:34:30.636 --> 00:34:42.943]  And the next time, it will dial through a cell phone, just like your OnStar, to the emergency management centers that have been built in every region of every state of the nation, even rural areas.
[00:34:43.283 --> 00:34:46.905]  Four or five counties get together with federal funds and build the command base.
[00:34:48.343 --> 00:34:52.044]  And they will dial in and you will be ticketed on the spot.
[00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:59.547]  It even said in some of the articles that arguing, yelling at your wife, the AI system picks up on that.
[00:34:59.907 --> 00:35:02.048]  But there's an even more advanced system.
[00:35:03.148 --> 00:35:09.231]  And this came out just a couple days ago in the Scotsman.
[00:35:09.251 --> 00:35:12.632]  And this is posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:34.071]  And it says, Machines which respond to their owner's emotions may seem like science fiction fantasy, but while living androids portrayed in the blockbuster film, I, Robot, may never be built, they're almost about to be built, folks, one firm has developed an emotion sensor which can help cars of the future make better drivers out of us.
[00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.293]  And it does voice print
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.742]  And it says it can tackle potential road rage, drowsiness.
[00:35:41.382 --> 00:35:44.644]  It monitors the driver's speech for signs of certain types of behavior.
[00:35:45.104 --> 00:35:54.289]  Actually, NASA has put some of these in similar systems, developed by NASA, not by the great scientists we're about to talk to, in five of the airports.
[00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.951]  So, joining us is Dr. Christian Jones.
[00:35:59.792 --> 00:36:03.634]  And, Dr. Jones, good to have you on with us, sir, from the United Kingdom.
[00:36:04.273 --> 00:36:06.074]  That's right, yeah, nice to talk to you.
[00:36:06.575 --> 00:36:07.895]  It's gone dark here at the moment.
[00:36:08.296 --> 00:36:10.417]  It's half five in the evening.
[00:36:11.498 --> 00:36:14.400]  Well, it's a sincere pleasure having you on with us.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:25.867]  Why don't you tell us, because your bio is so encyclopedic and prolific, it's prodigious, why don't you tell us about yourself in a nutshell?
[00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:32.020]  Yeah, well, this all comes from my background in speech technologies and animation.
[00:36:32.961 --> 00:36:38.204]  My first work was in creating lip synchronisation for the animation industry.
[00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:47.971]  So, the idea that you could actually record Tom Hanks' voice and automatically Woody in Toy Story would have the same lip movements.
[00:36:48.552 --> 00:36:55.277]  And this was the idea that it would help animators and help the film industry to create these CG movies that you see at the moment.
[00:36:55.877 --> 00:36:58.018]  Well, they have biometrics that detect your walk.
[00:37:18.702 --> 00:37:25.489]  That detect facial movements here that are now being tested in some airports and it looks like you're upset.
[00:37:25.549 --> 00:37:27.090]  That may be a reason for questioning.
[00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:28.592]  I'm sure you've seen those articles.
[00:37:29.193 --> 00:37:29.813]  That's right, yeah.
[00:37:30.053 --> 00:37:39.042]  It is interesting how all this starts in sort of the animation sector because obviously the biometrics and the walk patterns all come out of motion capture, which is used in the films.
[00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:40.243]  Did you see Forrest Gump?
[00:37:42.982 --> 00:37:43.443]  I did, yeah.
[00:37:43.943 --> 00:37:46.885]  You know when he walks up and is given the award by JFK?
[00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:52.349]  I know, he had the decomposite video, like aligning new footage with old footage.
[00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:59.114]  Yes, and then now we see Steve McQueen, 20 plus years in the grade, but he's back pitching Mustangs.
[00:37:59.774 --> 00:38:04.377]  Exactly, yeah, so it's interesting how you can do a lot with computer graphics.
[00:38:04.417 --> 00:38:06.179]  Doctor, did you see The Running Man?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.261]  I think I have, yeah.
[00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:12.243]  Yeah, where the government creates fake newscasts?
[00:38:12.945 --> 00:38:14.385]  That's right, yeah.
[00:38:14.405 --> 00:38:18.267]  Couldn't this, I mean, couldn't this, this technology's old now, couldn't this be dangerous?
[00:38:18.287 --> 00:38:34.191]  Because I knew they had the software out there where if they can just get you talking, they can then take you and then create a fake of you and then instantly have whatever words they want fed in to a computer program that then moves your lips in exactly the way you would talk and you can put words in people's mouths.
[00:38:35.047 --> 00:38:50.201]  You can, and you've seen people do this for entertainment purposes, where we have some satire over here which has taken George Bush and edited his conferences in such a way where he's doing various songs and he's singing to Tony Blair.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.142]  So, yeah, it can be abused.
[00:38:54.163 --> 00:39:03.430]  And what we've done, we started with this lip synchronization, which is interesting in itself, but then developed this, essentially, an emotion detection system.
[00:39:04.171 --> 00:39:14.860]  And so, like I said, we were going to use this in the animation sector, but then suddenly the ability to detect whether somebody's happy or angry or aggressive or surprised,
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:41.404]  had many more applications than just simply animation and I'm sure we can all get these like if you're calling into a call center and you know you're aggressive and you're angry then it'd be great if you could monitor these calls and so that you'd be able to get some information saying that say Ford have a great customer call center because they can say that 70% of their callers are happier at the end of the call after talking to their agents
[00:39:41.924 --> 00:39:47.451]  And you can get real figures like this because our technology will listen to all these calls and be able to gauge whether they're happier.
[00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:58.844]  Are you aware of the Houston firm years ago that when the employees get to work they have to retina scan and it picks up microscopic movements and decides if they're tired or on drugs?
[00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:02.008]  Yeah, I mean, it's exactly the same sort of thing.
[00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:25.472]  The way that we've looked at this in the call centre sector is that people are making calls and trying to sell you insurance, and the call centres want these agents, these people, to be motivated, they want them to be alert and attentive, and essentially our technology can listen to them as they're talking to you, and determine whether they're actually, you know, it's after lunch on a Friday, and in fact they don't seem as motivated.
[00:40:25.552 --> 00:40:28.613]  And then ask their chain if they have engaged in a thought crime.
[00:40:29.313 --> 00:40:30.413]  Exactly, yes.
[00:40:31.374 --> 00:40:34.294]  Some sort of liquid lunches might have slowed them down a bit.
[00:40:35.254 --> 00:40:37.295]  So it has many, many applications.
[00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.476]  Another one we've been looking at is the games sector.
[00:40:40.976 --> 00:40:46.737]  Because it'd be great if games of the future, computer games of the future, could actually be emotionally engaging.
[00:40:47.217 --> 00:40:50.858]  It's like games now are all very visual and very graphic and very violent.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:41:10.101]  I've read that soon the hand controls aren't going to deliver pain to your hands just like that famous James Bond movie where he's playing the video game with the guy at the casino and it starts shocking him.
[00:41:10.861 --> 00:41:11.202]  Exactly.
[00:41:11.222 --> 00:41:13.424]  The game is called World Domination, yes.
[00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.646]  Remember that?
[00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:16.066]  I do.
[00:41:16.327 --> 00:41:20.150]  I've actually just got a... It might have that over there as well.
[00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:26.437]  This little game where you hold on to the four sort of joysticks and the light flashes in the middle.
[00:41:27.137 --> 00:41:29.920]  And when the light turns green, you have to press a button.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.903]  And the person last to press the button gets an electric shock.
[00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:40.071]  And that's a really sort of simplistic game, but again has this idea that, you know, you get pain if you don't play right.
[00:41:40.711 --> 00:41:44.692]  But essentially, I mean, it'd be great if you could make these games emotionally appealing.
[00:41:44.892 --> 00:41:52.914]  One idea, and engaging, one idea is that, you know, say you're playing your computer game and you're getting frustrated because you've been playing for the same, you know, playing for an hour on the same level.
[00:41:53.675 --> 00:42:03.599]  The game could actually detect that you're getting frustrated and angry with it, and suddenly some sort of help would appear, like there might be an extra power-up, or some tool, which will actually help you get to the next level.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.581]  Or maybe you're bored, you've been playing the game for a while.
[00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:11.763]  Well, imagine, sir, imagine the military application, because the first video games were developed,
[00:42:12.203 --> 00:42:23.121]  To condition soldiers to shoot at people up close, to get past that compulsion not to do it, and I'm sure the military will want to add these pain delivery units to the devices.
[00:42:23.161 --> 00:42:25.685]  That way it'll bring people to the next level.
[00:42:26.454 --> 00:42:26.674]  It is.
[00:42:26.754 --> 00:42:29.336]  It's all about believability and realism.
[00:42:30.236 --> 00:42:32.618]  You want to feel immersed in whatever you're doing.
[00:42:32.998 --> 00:42:44.565]  And that's when this technology will obviously immerse you even further, because whatever you're interacting with will know what state of mind you're in, know whether you're feeling upbeat or happy, or know whether you're a really aggressive person.
[00:42:44.945 --> 00:42:49.267]  And therefore, the technology can try and adapt in some way for its purpose.
[00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:55.491]  And one of those things that we've been talking about is how you could actually help people driving by knowing what route they're in.
[00:42:56.372 --> 00:43:05.055]  Ah yes, and again we're talking to Christian Jones, doctor, professor, CEO of Effective Media Ltd.
[00:43:05.556 --> 00:43:07.976]  And the website is EffectiveMedia.com?
[00:43:09.117 --> 00:43:09.557]  That's right, yep.
[00:43:10.777 --> 00:43:17.360]  Sir, I want to get into the cars because I don't think people in America and in England understand that
[00:43:18.203 --> 00:43:28.793]  The National Traffic Safety Board, and I've had members of the board on, I don't think they realize that every square mile of every major public road in the U.S.
[00:43:29.254 --> 00:43:33.298]  will have cameras scanning the license plates, scanning faces,
[00:43:33.798 --> 00:43:45.721]  I don't think they realize that MSNBC reported four years ago, three and a half years ago, excuse me, that they're going to put infrared cameras in all the cars so the children don't get locked in and burn up and die.
[00:43:45.761 --> 00:43:47.481]  That's the public reason.
[00:43:47.781 --> 00:43:49.361]  Now it's to stop road rage.
[00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:52.982]  Now it's going to be to stop distracted or tired driving.
[00:43:53.382 --> 00:43:57.223]  But again, that goes off of head movement and eye movement.
[00:43:58.244 --> 00:44:03.134]  But your system goes to another level analyzing the speech.
[00:44:03.174 --> 00:44:04.175]  Were you aware that the U.S.
[00:44:04.196 --> 00:44:10.086]  government is talking about linking these by cell phone uplink to police departments?
[00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:23.255]  I mean, it is all trying to... You can put it in a negative light with all these sort of intrusive cameras and the police force trying to intrude into our lives and into our driving habits.
[00:44:23.615 --> 00:44:30.437]  But from a positive point of view, it's all designed to try and improve driving performance and try to improve your safety.
[00:44:30.857 --> 00:44:38.679]  So, the fact that, you know, the car's listening to you or monitoring you in some way is all, hopefully, trying to assist you so that
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.365]  You're not going to have an accident.
[00:44:40.525 --> 00:44:43.637]  And if you do have an accident, then you're going to be able to get away from the car.
[00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:59.020]  The way that we've been working on this is that our motion recognition technology actually has a sort of voice print, voice print analysis on it, so that as you're talking to your car, it will actually detect what mood you're in.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:09.109]  Now you may say, well, currently I don't talk to my car, but in the future, and not so distant future, with the insight of things like... Toyota has announced they may be installing this!
[00:45:10.554 --> 00:45:18.898]  Okay, well, if you think you've got GPS, you've got navigation, you've got sat-nav in your car, you can voice dial people as you're driving along.
[00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:26.202]  It makes much more sense to be able to drive and talk to your car than it does trying to press buttons, which will obviously distract you.
[00:45:26.562 --> 00:45:28.623]  A number of accidents people have had through changing car channels.
[00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:31.805]  And then again, it's been described though, arguing with your wife?
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.220]  Driving too distracted?
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:44.045]  The government is saying that after it warns you three times that the police department is going to be watching and you may get pulled over!
[00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:45.321]  Exactly.
[00:45:45.381 --> 00:45:55.069]  I mean, what we would like to do, rather than the heavy-handed approach, which really that sounds like when you put it in that way, is that... Just go ahead and get the system in.
[00:45:55.089 --> 00:45:56.169]  The fun can come later.
[00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:57.190]  Exactly.
[00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:02.414]  The technology actually is meant to be assistive.
[00:46:02.454 --> 00:46:08.578]  So as you're talking to your car about... You may be saying things like, look, I'm quite hungry.
[00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:10.420]  Is there any way that I can get a quick snack?
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.161]  And the car will actually know where it is, obviously.
[00:46:13.181 --> 00:46:13.501]  Yes, Dave.
[00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:15.142]  There is a place where you can get it.
[00:46:15.462 --> 00:46:18.704]  Dave, I've been quite confused lately, Dave, about the mission.
[00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:23.326]  The way we were all kept in hyperstasis before the mission, Dave.
[00:46:24.107 --> 00:46:25.728]  Dave, are you feeling alright?
[00:46:26.308 --> 00:46:31.531]  Dave, I think you need to go outside the ship and fix the EM-12 CQX unit, Dave.
[00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:32.791]  Open the pod bay doors, Hal!
[00:46:35.899 --> 00:46:42.126]  But what about the problem here of the government having control of all of our cars?
[00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:45.690]  You know they're coming out with mechanized remote-controlled tanks.
[00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.153]  The whole Air Force in the next decade is going to go over to drone control.
[00:46:49.954 --> 00:46:54.459]  Isn't this a recipe for a few techno-tyrants to control the whole planet?
[00:46:55.504 --> 00:47:08.380]  There is always this abuse in technology, and my background is in usability studies, which is all about designing systems which actually help people rather than trying to have some sort of government control.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.803]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[00:47:11.083 --> 00:47:12.786]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[00:47:14.387 --> 00:47:24.371]  What the intention is here is to simply, you know, the car will talk to you and engage you in conversation and try to, you know, improve your mood, try to help you.
[00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:29.933]  And if it can do that subtly and talk to you... But also, there's a lot of mental illness out there.
[00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:35.235]  It can be pre-programmed and this is being discussed to pick up that you're mentally ill and report it back.
[00:47:36.775 --> 00:47:43.580]  It's very amusing when you can throw all these anecdotal ideas.
[00:47:44.421 --> 00:47:45.362]  Sir, they're not ideas.
[00:47:45.402 --> 00:47:47.263]  These are being discussed by the bureaucrats.
[00:47:47.803 --> 00:47:48.444]  Exactly.
[00:47:48.484 --> 00:47:51.886]  Would you like me to... Doctor, Doctor, I'm sure you're a good guy, very talented.
[00:47:52.607 --> 00:47:56.530]  You sound like a genius, but I'm trying to explain something to you.
[00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:02.394]  Do you understand that the bad application will always be used by the military-industrial complex?
[00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:09.170]  I think it's also how we actually incorporate this and how much access we give to various people.
[00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:17.895]  I mean, we have rights to allow people certain access to information, certain data protection acts and certain sorts of services.
[00:48:17.915 --> 00:48:18.295]  Really?
[00:48:19.746 --> 00:48:22.749]  Well, we can, at every stage of any development, you build these in.
[00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:31.778]  And I know of studies where there's actually sort of a black box that you can put in your car which will track your driving behavior.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.481]  All new cars sold in the U.S.
[00:48:34.561 --> 00:48:35.342]  already have the box.
[00:48:35.823 --> 00:48:36.443]  Exactly, yes.
[00:48:36.503 --> 00:48:41.589]  So, if you're a good driver, if you've got a good, you know, profile of how you drive, then your insurance can come down.
[00:48:42.209 --> 00:48:51.999]  And if you drive normally quite well, then what is the negative point of having this put into your car and actually seeing your premium come down?
[00:48:52.139 --> 00:48:59.586]  So what was wrong as the clocks striked 13 on the cold morning as Winston walked to the Ministry of Truth?
[00:49:00.307 --> 00:49:01.969]  I mean, what was wrong with there being cameras?
[00:49:02.149 --> 00:49:03.330]  Did you know here in the U.S.
[00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.253]  hundreds of schools have put cameras in the bathrooms?
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.761]  There is some very bizarre things.
[00:49:09.981 --> 00:49:19.749]  In Edinburgh here, I can tell you that, I don't know if it's the same for you, but you can't go to your nativity play and film your child at that event.
[00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:28.196]  You can't film the sports day when you're running along trying to beat all the other fathers for fear that this may be used by the wrong people.
[00:49:28.296 --> 00:49:32.920]  But the government can surveil everybody else.
[00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:35.943]  And it is that big brother approach.
[00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:59.990]  And, there is, there is so, you have to, we have to be careful at every stage to make sure that... Doctor, of course, I mean, Doctor Jones, look, your application is like a gun, or a knife, or a computer, it's an inanimate object, not bad in and of itself, but I'm just, and I know you know this stuff, you're not, you're not ignorant, the government's racing ahead for total big brother applications that dwarf 1984.
[00:50:02.314 --> 00:50:11.401]  It is, and even iRobot, written in the past, particularly in the future, is very close to reality.
[00:50:11.421 --> 00:50:17.305]  If we start talking about robotics, and including this technology as part of that robotic system,
[00:50:18.718 --> 00:50:22.899]  Each of those androids is portrayed as a useful item, which will help our daily activity.
[00:50:23.199 --> 00:50:28.421]  But then, in the wrong hands of some tyrant, they become the world domination, as you're predicting.
[00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:30.142]  And it is that control.
[00:50:30.202 --> 00:50:35.203]  It's control of the technology, so that the technology doesn't control you, but you actually have control over it.
[00:50:35.263 --> 00:50:37.544]  And it then becomes a helpful thing, rather than a hindrance.
[00:50:37.564 --> 00:50:44.186]  Yeah, but built into this, built into this technology, is a pyramidal structure where it is going to be controlled by the government.
[00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.112]  Tell you what, tell you what.
[00:50:47.512 --> 00:50:48.254]  Doctors, stay there.
[00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:50.096]  Just five more minutes, we'll be on the other side.
[00:50:50.116 --> 00:50:52.660]  I want to give you some more examples of this.
[00:50:53.321 --> 00:50:53.642]  Okay?
[00:50:54.002 --> 00:50:54.603]  Let me get back.
[00:50:54.724 --> 00:50:58.730]  And I want to talk more about the applications of effectivemedia.com.
[00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.431]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.565 --> 00:51:03.067]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.267 --> 00:51:06.351]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.491 --> 00:51:10.395]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.435 --> 00:51:14.680]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.604]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.724 --> 00:51:20.747]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.327 --> 00:51:24.228]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.268 --> 00:51:28.989]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.149 --> 00:51:32.190]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.231]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.711 --> 00:51:41.833]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.353 --> 00:51:46.158]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:01.545 --> 00:52:04.529]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:13.721]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.042 --> 00:52:18.728]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.168 --> 00:52:25.892]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.293 --> 00:52:38.080]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.003]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.184 --> 00:52:45.645]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:12.925 --> 00:54:16.248]  In 2001, October 1st, they passed a law six years before.
[00:54:16.288 --> 00:54:21.153]  They said industry, every cell phone sold must be satellite triangulated.
[00:54:21.193 --> 00:54:22.895]  That is, there's no satellite tracker in it.
[00:54:23.475 --> 00:54:28.000]  There is a radio homing device that triangulates from the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.263]  Really down to 3 feet, but the minimum law is 15 feet.
[00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:45.581]  They can also dial in and listen to you over the phone, and we've caught them with OnStarm using NSA computers just randomly listening to people over the audio sensors on it.
[00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:54.046]  Almost all the major table boxes sold in the last five years have a microphone in them, though there's no application for the microphone.
[00:54:54.807 --> 00:54:55.829]  I've talked to the technicians.
[00:54:55.889 --> 00:54:57.132]  I've seen the diagrams.
[00:54:57.633 --> 00:55:00.198]  They admit that they can listen to you over it.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.526]  When Janet Jackson showed her breasts at the last Super Bowl a year ago,
[00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:10.142]  Tivo came out and bragged, oh, we know there was a record rewind and replay on that.
[00:55:10.182 --> 00:55:11.202]  People said, well, how do you know that?
[00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:12.603]  Because it's two-way.
[00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:16.005]  We're building psychological data algorithms on you.
[00:55:16.545 --> 00:55:23.129]  And so, this, you get mad and you scream at somebody on the road and, you know, go, I'd like to kill you!
[00:55:23.149 --> 00:55:25.510]  You know, just through your window.
[00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:28.872]  And, oh, nice men show up at your house.
[00:55:29.816 --> 00:55:31.258]  And they've got the recording.
[00:55:31.298 --> 00:55:34.161]  It's flagged, recorded, and data shifted up to them.
[00:55:34.702 --> 00:55:35.522]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:36.483]  This is the official plan.
[00:55:36.824 --> 00:55:45.333]  So, Dr. Jones, I'm sure you're not a bad person pushing this voice print system, but I'm telling you what the government's going to do with it.
[00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:46.014]  What do you say to that?
[00:55:47.722 --> 00:55:49.603]  It's scary when you put it in that way.
[00:55:51.064 --> 00:55:57.188]  All our designs have been trying to help people to drive more safely.
[00:55:58.649 --> 00:56:03.952]  When you think about how these technologies have been used in the past, it's like your shopping habits.
[00:56:04.592 --> 00:56:10.738]  You go and buy your food, and suddenly they know exactly what you buy week by week.
[00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:14.061]  And then you get coupons for that in the mailbox.
[00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:14.742]  Yeah.
[00:56:14.802 --> 00:56:20.006]  I mean, if you've got coupons so you get food cheaper, that's not a bad thing.
[00:56:20.147 --> 00:56:25.932]  They actually learn what you'll absolutely buy, regardless of price, and actually jack up prices.
[00:56:27.042 --> 00:56:33.451]  I mean, if they can provide what people actually want and want to buy, then that's a good way.
[00:56:33.792 --> 00:56:35.194]  Doctor, this is your problem.
[00:56:35.515 --> 00:56:36.376]  This is your problem.
[00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:41.344]  You think you're a nice guy, so you think the rest of the world is nice, and I'm telling you it's not.
[00:56:43.002 --> 00:56:50.306]  I mean, the number of technologies in the past, historically, which have been abused and at the detriment of society is great.
[00:56:50.746 --> 00:56:58.631]  And the number of technologies which are coming out of the marketplace, which always start, like you said, with the mobile phone example of being able to triangulate.
[00:56:58.911 --> 00:57:02.914]  And people can put a spin on this and say, it's great, we can track our kids, we know where they are.
[00:57:03.314 --> 00:57:06.816]  If there's some sort of kidnapping, then we can always track where they've been taken to.
[00:57:07.296 --> 00:57:12.518]  And then other people can say, well isn't that, you know, it's terrible because your boss can track where you are.
[00:57:12.538 --> 00:57:21.661]  You know, you've gone out for your lunch break and somebody could track that behavior, or they could try and predict that you were going to the wrong society, meeting the wrong kinds of people.
[00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:23.481]  And people can keep progressing.
[00:57:23.761 --> 00:57:24.321]  Exactly!
[00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:27.202]  Let's say we had a perfect government right now, we can trust them.
[00:57:27.422 --> 00:57:28.003]  Which we can't.
[00:57:28.263 --> 00:57:33.644]  But imagine these mechanisms of control in the hands of dictators.
[00:57:33.964 --> 00:57:35.585]  Imagine Hitler with these systems.
[00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:51.801]  In terms of, well, the storming technologies out there, which would, their global communication is so minute now, the world is so small, that information can be passed about so readily, that the supporters of this are saying, well, we need to keep track of this information.
[00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:55.442]  And it's also very easy to put false data in on people.
[00:57:57.383 --> 00:57:58.284]  In terms of their records.
[00:57:58.897 --> 00:58:07.560]  Yes, and it's also, if one half of one percent is corrupt, which is a conservative number, we're talking about tens of millions of people getting into problems that's already happened.
[00:58:08.061 --> 00:58:10.682]  Listen, Dr. Jones, great talking to you.
[00:58:11.062 --> 00:58:12.362]  Effectivemedia.com.
[00:58:12.462 --> 00:58:24.747]  I hope that you'll think about what we've said as you develop these things, and I hope you'll be a supporter of liberty and only sell your applications to worthwhile things that are good for humanity.
[00:58:25.787 --> 00:58:27.348]  Well, we've knocked off policy in life.
[00:58:29.224 --> 00:58:32.165]  Well, I'm sure it is, my friend, but I hope we've given you something to think about.
[00:58:32.465 --> 00:58:35.086]  Thank you for spending time with us, and, uh, cheers!
[00:58:35.686 --> 00:58:37.327]  Alright, good luck, and, uh, take care.
[00:58:37.467 --> 00:58:38.387]  Take care, my friend.
[00:58:39.248 --> 00:58:41.229]  Alright, we just talked to Lord Jones.
[00:58:41.909 --> 00:58:42.609]  Nice fellow.
[00:58:43.429 --> 00:58:44.670]  And, uh, we'll be right back.
[00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:48.451]  Talking about the inauguration of his lordship.
[00:58:49.051 --> 00:58:49.612]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.216 --> 00:59:00.277]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:02.099]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:03.580]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:05.822]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.902 --> 00:59:09.685]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.086 --> 00:59:14.230]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.512 --> 00:59:20.615]  Alright, into hour number 2 on this 20th day of January 2005.
[00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:33.482]  We're going to be playing clips of George W. Bush's speech and going over the fact of how it's complete hypocrisy and doublespeak and how he
[00:59:34.366 --> 00:59:36.167]  is totally violating his oath of office.
[00:59:36.187 --> 00:59:41.009]  We're going to play the oath, taking, and the swearing in of Lord Bush and Lord Cheney.
[00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:43.830]  And we're going to talk to Teach in D.C.
[00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:49.973]  and West in New Mexico, John Ohio, David in Mass, and Chris in Alabama, and others.
[00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:52.154]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:52.194 --> 00:59:54.275]  The last 30 minutes I had this professor, doctor on,
[01:00:00.689 --> 01:00:06.554]  With these technologies that monitor your speech for road rage or distracted driving or whatever.
[01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:15.721]  And in our own media, the government's announcing, by law, they want to put these systems in your cars to watch you and track you and report back on you.
[01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:23.668]  And so I thought I'd play this Neocon star piece, just to give you an idea of what we're facing.
[01:00:23.708 --> 01:00:24.809]  So that's coming.
[01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:25.990]  I haven't played that in a few months.
[01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:30.073]  So we'll play that coming up in the next segment, actually.
[01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:41.726]  Also, I want to get into just the amazing police state things that are happening right now.
[01:00:41.746 --> 01:00:47.869]  I want to go over Alberto Gonzalez says his main job is going to be getting the assault weapons ban passed.
[01:00:48.369 --> 01:00:55.693]  A bunch of other horrible things have happened to the Second Amendment here in just the last day.
[01:00:56.533 --> 01:00:58.954]  And the NRA is not talking about it.
[01:01:00.315 --> 01:01:01.936]  And the media is not talking about it.
[01:01:02.908 --> 01:01:12.593]  And so-called conservatives are running around celebrating as if they've had some type of Super Bowl victory, that George Bush is in office, and we're in worse shape with Bush in office than Kerry.
[01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:21.819]  Because we know Kerry's evil, we know he's for big government, we know he's a gun grabber, we know he's for amnesty, for the open borders, and he wouldn't get away with it.
[01:01:23.239 --> 01:01:29.683]  But Republicans in Congress are voting with the Democrats who vote more with Bush than they
[01:01:31.415 --> 01:01:32.736]  than Republicans even do.
[01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.336]  Did you know that?
[01:01:33.896 --> 01:01:35.357]  And they're getting the whole agenda.
[01:01:35.477 --> 01:01:44.221]  The whole forced drugging, forced psychological testing, national ID card checkpoints, surveillance, total information awareness network.
[01:01:45.322 --> 01:01:46.402]  It is all happening.
[01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:50.064]  Right now, let's go to Washington, D.C.
[01:01:50.744 --> 01:01:52.805]  and let's talk to Teach.
[01:01:53.485 --> 01:01:54.846]  Teach in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:55.426]  You're on the air.
[01:01:55.466 --> 01:01:55.866]  Go ahead.
[01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:57.427]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.508]  How are you doing this afternoon?
[01:01:58.588 --> 01:01:58.908]  Good.
[01:01:58.948 --> 01:01:59.368]  How is it?
[01:01:59.989 --> 01:02:01.750]  How is Caesar doing?
[01:02:03.071 --> 01:02:06.613]  Well, it's a living nightmare, is what it is.
[01:02:06.633 --> 01:02:12.476]  I just wanted to share with you, Alex, another weapon in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:16.898]  I don't know if you're familiar with Dr. Walter Weiss.
[01:02:17.739 --> 01:02:20.480]  There's a website, amazingdiscoveries.org.
[01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:25.103]  And also, there's a gentleman by the name of Bill Hughes.
[01:02:25.143 --> 01:02:25.963]  He has a couple of books.
[01:02:26.423 --> 01:02:28.785]  The Secret Terrorist and the Enemy Unmasked.
[01:02:29.915 --> 01:02:34.497]  Okay, I was wondering if you were interested in having these two gentlemen on your show?
[01:02:35.078 --> 01:02:35.998]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:36.599]  I might do that.
[01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:37.379]  Send me an email.
[01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:39.540]  But let me stop because I want to hold you over.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.423]  Tell us, not just what the media is saying, because they admit regular army is commanding the 50 agencies.
[01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:49.245]  They wouldn't let the protesters or even supporters get anywhere nearing.
[01:02:49.805 --> 01:02:50.546]  What is D.C.
[01:02:50.586 --> 01:02:51.206]  like right now?
[01:02:51.947 --> 01:02:56.669]  Well, it's a virtual police state, and many of the residents
[01:02:57.219 --> 01:02:58.560]  By the way, Governor Ridge last week
[01:03:23.283 --> 01:03:26.324]  Actually said, it was on the Army's website, still there, we have a link to it.
[01:03:26.664 --> 01:03:32.386]  He said, this is practice for the rest of the country, with the military over things, this is what it's going to be like everywhere.
[01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:34.667]  I mean, he actually said that.
[01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:37.408]  It's not like we're saying it now.
[01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.629]  This is what life... I want to hear what it's like.
[01:03:40.869 --> 01:03:43.130]  When we get back, Teach, for a few minutes, stay with us, okay?
[01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:44.931]  Will you stay on hold?
[01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:45.231]  Yeah.
[01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:51.333]  I want to hear what it's like, what the preparations were like, and it's a good way to start this hour as we analyze
[01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:53.172]  Uh, the dictatorship.
[01:03:53.432 --> 01:03:57.795]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.955 --> 01:04:02.398]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:06.902]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:08.303]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:14.305]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:21.307]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.427 --> 01:04:23.487]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.808 --> 01:04:34.131]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:35.311]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.735 --> 01:05:02.802]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:14.290]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:20.335]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:27.220]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:34.265]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.525 --> 01:05:36.287]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.567 --> 01:05:38.628]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:41.731]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.451]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[01:05:52.056 --> 01:05:56.278]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:05:57.038 --> 01:06:05.282]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:06:05.882 --> 01:06:07.623]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:14.186]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.

[01:06:19.769 --> 01:06:21.790]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:23.450]  And it's so easy.
[01:06:24.171 --> 01:06:26.212]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:06:27.032 --> 01:06:27.632]  When you want.
[01:06:28.172 --> 01:06:28.833]  Where you want.
[01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:34.615]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[01:06:35.484 --> 01:06:38.286]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[01:06:38.306 --> 01:06:39.087]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:06:39.107 --> 01:06:39.567]  That's 419-WORD.
[01:06:39.587 --> 01:06:39.747]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:06:39.767 --> 01:06:40.588]  Big Brother.
[01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:41.348]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:01.096 --> 01:07:05.398]  We're now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into the second segment of the second hour.
[01:07:05.778 --> 01:07:11.020]  We're about to go back to a gentleman in DC describing the conditions there.
[01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:36.108]  And I'm going to be playing some clips of George W. Bush and Cheney's swearing in.
[01:07:36.168 --> 01:07:40.436]  In fact, let's do that right now as they perjure themselves.
[01:07:40.496 --> 01:07:40.936]  Here it is.
[01:07:41.998 --> 01:08:04.720]  I, Richard Cheney, do solemnly swear, I, Richard Cheney, do solemnly swear, that I will defend and support the Constitution of the United States, that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies foreign and domestic, against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I will take this obligation freely,
[01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.101]  That I take this obligation freely.
[01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.922]  Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:13.343]  Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[01:08:13.603 --> 01:08:16.983]  And I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of my office.
[01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:20.684]  And I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office.
[01:08:21.224 --> 01:08:23.225]  On which I'm about to enter, so help me God.
[01:08:23.405 --> 01:08:25.565]  On which I'm about to enter, so help me God.
[01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:26.405]  Congratulations.
[01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:30.706]  And now Lord Bush.
[01:08:35.507 --> 01:08:36.608]  Vice President Cheney?
[01:08:36.628 --> 01:08:43.391]  Raise your right hand, Mr. President, and repeat after me.
[01:08:44.632 --> 01:08:55.897]  I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability
[01:09:01.793 --> 01:09:05.195]  Preserve, protect, and defend.
[01:09:05.376 --> 01:09:07.097]  The Constitution of the United States.
[01:09:07.117 --> 01:09:07.457]  So help me God.
[01:09:07.517 --> 01:09:08.197]  Congratulations.
[01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:43.753]  What this country is even built on, the history of it, they have no idea that it is being literally eviscerated, broken open, burned.
[01:09:43.953 --> 01:09:47.918]  They are chewing giant holes like rodents in it.
[01:09:48.759 --> 01:09:50.841]  They are dismantling the whole thing.
[01:09:51.519 --> 01:09:56.880]  Whether it's Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, they are following the orders of the New World Order.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.501]  They are getting rid of this country.
[01:09:58.521 --> 01:10:00.021]  They're not protecting or defending it.
[01:10:00.361 --> 01:10:01.361]  Our borders are wide open.
[01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:02.721]  They're getting rid of the First Amendment.
[01:10:03.001 --> 01:10:05.162]  They're attacking the Second Amendment viciously.
[01:10:05.782 --> 01:10:09.383]  They are getting rid of the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment.
[01:10:09.423 --> 01:10:14.464]  They are openly getting legislation passed for shadow government to take over Congress.
[01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:18.046]  It is all happening in front of our very eyes.
[01:10:18.827 --> 01:10:26.993]  Their noses, if there was any justice, should have been growing to 50 feet long apiece with the Pinocchio syndrome.
[01:10:28.554 --> 01:10:34.118]  Now, Bush didn't do the Diablo after he was sworn in like Bill Clinton did.
[01:10:34.238 --> 01:10:38.341]  After Bill Clinton was sworn in, and I have a video of this, he stepped back and did the sign of the devil.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:46.344]  But when he's not being sworn in, he is usually running around doing that along with his wife, and they say, oh, that means UT Hook'em Horns.
[01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:48.965]  I guess that's why George Bush Sr.
[01:10:48.985 --> 01:10:55.969]  does it, and his wife, and why Bill Clinton does it, and Prince Harry, and Prince William, and Prince Charles, and Ted Turner.
[01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:57.950]  I guess that's why they're always constantly doing this.
[01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:03.233]  It's just that they all like the UT Longhorns folks, because they're so Christian.
[01:11:03.613 --> 01:11:06.915]  That's why they're members of Bohemian Grove, and Skull and Bones.
[01:11:08.559 --> 01:11:14.061]  I'd like to hear from the callers, and then later we're going to play some clips of Bush's speech and I'll make some comments on it.
[01:11:14.321 --> 01:11:21.964]  I'd like to hear from the callers just about areas of the Bill of Rights and Constitution that you're aware of that are being dismantled.
[01:11:22.424 --> 01:11:26.766]  But going back to Teach in D.C., we were talking to you in the last segment.
[01:11:26.826 --> 01:11:34.169]  Teach, describe what it's been like in the last week and what it's like today in the District of Criminals.
[01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:37.610]  Well, fortunately, you know, I didn't go downtown today
[01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:40.612]  Uh, and, you know, because I stayed home to call you.
[01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:50.857]  But, you know, just in the setup, it was basically they moved in, they set up, you got out of the way, and not, and also you couldn't ask any questions.
[01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:53.959]  They basically muffled their way in and did what they wanted to do.
[01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:56.040]  And it's just, it's just sad.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:03.143]  You know, you have people sleeping on the, on the streets, the mayor's building, $250,000, heated booths for the parade.
[01:12:03.683 --> 01:12:04.884]  It's just a travesty.
[01:12:04.944 --> 01:12:06.805]  But like you always say, Alex, um,
[01:12:07.535 --> 01:12:11.760]  If knowing that God is on our side, the New World Order will be defeated.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.842]  I'm confident in that.
[01:12:14.103 --> 01:12:15.845]  Well, again, I want to repeat this.
[01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:22.974]  Last Friday, the Army website reported that regular Army
[01:12:23.843 --> 01:12:30.424]  You know, CNN said, oh, you know, for the last hundred years, the military has done some ceremonies.
[01:12:30.724 --> 01:12:31.404]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:31.424 --> 01:12:33.225]  That's one group of ten groups.
[01:12:33.845 --> 01:12:37.545]  Regular Army, a Brigadier General is over the whole thing.
[01:12:37.665 --> 01:12:38.906]  They command the police.
[01:12:39.266 --> 01:12:40.546]  Go to Infowars.com.
[01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:42.426]  Click on the archive, on the calendar.
[01:12:42.466 --> 01:12:45.567]  Last Friday, we've got about fifteen articles there.
[01:12:45.607 --> 01:12:51.868]  You can link right through to the Army's website with an image of this Brigadier General standing on a giant map
[01:12:52.929 --> 01:13:18.046]  in a huge room with all the police, all the different agencies and it says right there on the Army's website he was giving orders to the police, the firemen, the Secret Service, the Army is in control and they're giving orders and Governor Ridge then gets up and there's photos on the Army website and text and quotes of what he said and paraphrasing he said, look, and I read these quotes last Friday, he said, look
[01:13:18.897 --> 01:13:23.921]  This is a great example of integration of forces and force command for the rest of the country.
[01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:26.382]  This is the model for America.
[01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:41.193]  With the TSA screeners, 400 of them from the airports, these abusers, they're there under the military teaching the police how to operate, how to assess people, and telling the people, don't look at the president, don't look him in the eyes.
[01:13:41.573 --> 01:13:43.075]  We're going to follow you to the bathroom.
[01:13:43.095 --> 01:13:47.498]  When you go to the bathroom, they told all the workers and the entertainers and the band members
[01:13:48.138 --> 01:13:49.039]  And everybody else.
[01:13:49.539 --> 01:13:52.060]  And here's the military in control.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.561]  Total violation of Posse Comitatus.
[01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:56.542]  Of the 1878 law.
[01:13:56.862 --> 01:14:00.764]  Total violation of every basic canon of a free society.
[01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:05.006]  And then I was watching it as no protesters allowed on the parade route.
[01:14:05.146 --> 01:14:06.447]  They've always been there before.
[01:14:06.927 --> 01:14:09.949]  In 2000 I got the video of eggs hitting the armored vehicle.
[01:14:10.289 --> 01:14:14.731]  No one there but lines of military in uniform and their black berets.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.801]  Lines of Secret Service.
[01:14:17.262 --> 01:14:18.603]  Lines of riot police.
[01:14:19.043 --> 01:14:20.745]  Lining Caesar's way.
[01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:24.128]  I mean, even Caesar let the common people get on the sides of the streets.
[01:14:24.489 --> 01:14:25.990]  There, everybody's held back.
[01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:30.294]  And then even at the picket lines, where everybody's held back, then there's more security.
[01:14:31.395 --> 01:14:32.536]  Yeah, it's a real joke.
[01:14:32.556 --> 01:14:37.219]  Unfortunately here in Washington, we live every day with the face scanning cameras, the checkpoints,
[01:14:57.133 --> 01:15:01.897]  The, uh, just the total, I mean, the citizens of Washington, D.C.
[01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:07.401]  were out around on their license plates with the words, taxation without any representation.
[01:15:07.861 --> 01:15:25.395]  So, it's a total joke here, and, uh, I just encourage the folks to gather this information, you know, continue to listen to InfoWars, of course, and other, uh, alternative news, and just prepare, and fight this thing with all the power that God has given you.
[01:15:26.977 --> 01:15:29.720]  What's the mindset of people in D.C.?
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.083]  I mean, do they know that Kerry was just a puppet, too, and took a dive?
[01:15:34.484 --> 01:15:45.035]  No, some do, but a lot, you know, some of the people think that they're a part of this, like, you know, this is for them, and they're just, you know, going along with the group think.
[01:15:45.955 --> 01:15:46.716]  A lot of them are.
[01:15:46.756 --> 01:15:50.480]  Some of the ones that I, you know, that I talk to, their eyes are open.
[01:15:50.976 --> 01:15:58.283]  But we got to go beyond just knowing about these things and actually doing the necessary work to prepare.
[01:15:59.284 --> 01:16:04.490]  And that, you know, some of the things that you offer on your program are part of what we need to prepare.
[01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.231]  This thing is serious.
[01:16:07.052 --> 01:16:09.314]  And we see it coming, you know, more and more.
[01:16:09.354 --> 01:16:10.716]  It's more bold each and every day.
[01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:23.270]  Did you hear that interview in the last hour where they admit that they've got these cameras and these systems that are going to be in the cars that watch our every move and report back to the police on us?
[01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.052]  Yeah, you know, I've been asking people about that.
[01:16:26.092 --> 01:16:33.698]  They have the, you know, the cameras in the schools, the cameras all on the, you know, along the streets, the highways, all, you know, downtown.
[01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:36.860]  And, you know, they're going to put the cameras in the cars.
[01:16:37.441 --> 01:16:41.544]  And so when the cameras go in the homes, then we have to swipe the thieves and
[01:16:42.023 --> 01:16:50.910]  And all of this police state was being built and set up before 9-11, and then that was the trigger of the excuse to even clamp down tighter, and when the globalists carry out another terror attack, it's only going to get worse.
[01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:11.009]  Yes Alex, I wanted to ask a question about the disarming of the Scottish people going on right now over in Scotland.
[01:17:11.029 --> 01:17:13.429]  I haven't heard anything about it but from a fellow last night who
[01:17:31.828 --> 01:17:42.151]  Yeah, they banned hunting in the country, even for people who had gun clubs.
[01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:46.932]  You had to have your gun checked in at the club with all these special licenses.
[01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:49.453]  You had to have constables there on site for a hunt.
[01:17:50.217 --> 01:17:52.219]  And he had to be very wealthy to be able to do it.
[01:17:52.259 --> 01:17:53.339]  Now they've even banned that.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.402]  And yeah, now even in Scotland they're banning all guns.
[01:17:57.002 --> 01:17:58.583]  And it's all part of the enslavement.
[01:17:58.643 --> 01:17:59.884]  And yes sir, that's going on.
[01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:08.070]  But they're using the United Nations like they did in your film, was that Police State 2, The Takeover?
[01:18:08.838 --> 01:18:17.063]  I have BBC where they are having drills all over Scotland with Czech Republic troops and troops from the Ukraine.
[01:18:17.343 --> 01:18:23.727]  I'm talking about kicking down their doors and coming in just like the training film that you showed us.
[01:18:24.688 --> 01:18:25.769]  I didn't know about that.
[01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:27.590]  I did find BBC about a year ago.
[01:18:28.947 --> 01:18:33.508]  Well, I guess the Scots are putting up some kind of a fight, so I'm gathering.
[01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:56.954]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:57.294 --> 01:19:00.177]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.397 --> 01:19:06.603]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:19:57.437 --> 01:20:02.604]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:20:03.516 --> 01:20:10.400]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:20.044]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?

[01:21:53.089 --> 01:21:58.972]  Hey, I'll tell you, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[01:21:59.012 --> 01:22:00.732]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:00.973 --> 01:22:02.833]  Hey, last weekend I helped my neighbor move.
[01:22:03.074 --> 01:22:04.894]  That took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[01:22:05.215 --> 01:22:08.956]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[01:22:09.016 --> 01:22:12.278]  And then after that I went ahead and did like 20 minutes of cardio.
[01:22:12.438 --> 01:22:12.538]  Wow!
[01:22:13.297 --> 01:22:17.420]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.300]  Well, that's great.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:21.162]  And just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[01:22:21.222 --> 01:22:21.423]  Right.
[01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:23.264]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants.
[01:22:23.284 --> 01:22:26.366]  It's more that because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[01:22:26.546 --> 01:22:26.946]  Absolutely.
[01:22:26.986 --> 01:22:27.847]  I'm sleeping better.
[01:22:28.107 --> 01:22:29.308]  I feel better during the day.
[01:22:29.328 --> 01:22:31.009]  I don't get as tired in the afternoons.
[01:22:31.169 --> 01:22:32.430]  And I'm able to do a lot more.
[01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:33.611]  Collagenate is safe.
[01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:34.411]  It's natural.
[01:22:34.511 --> 01:22:35.012]  It's healthy.
[01:22:35.152 --> 01:22:36.933]  And it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.
[01:22:37.393 --> 01:22:39.375]  Call and order Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, 1-800-6222-THIN.
[01:22:39.396 --> 01:22:39.436]  800-622-8446.

[01:22:41.218 --> 01:22:42.879]  Order Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:03.590]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:07.471]  Then I want to get into Bush's speech and the new agenda.
[01:23:07.531 --> 01:23:19.995]  What he's really doing when he's not invoking God's name or talking about liberty and freedom constantly or fires and mines that warm those that submit and burn those that resist.
[01:23:21.776 --> 01:23:23.576]  Sounds like something Albert Pike would say.
[01:23:24.156 --> 01:23:25.737]  Let's talk to David and Mass.
[01:23:25.777 --> 01:23:26.097]  David,
[01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:29.593]  Why, we've got a nuke threat in your state.
[01:23:30.233 --> 01:23:31.014]  Did you hear of that?
[01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:32.514]  Some Chinese immigrants.
[01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.575]  Hey Alex, how are you today?
[01:23:34.895 --> 01:23:35.855]  Good, sir.
[01:23:35.936 --> 01:23:36.816]  Did you hear about that?
[01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:42.978]  The little diversion story about four Chinese nationals coming across the Mexican border.
[01:23:43.178 --> 01:23:45.439]  Yes, but we've got to leave our borders wide open.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:52.382]  Officials, ID, alleged terror threat, suspects, FBI, notified law enforcement agencies.
[01:23:53.254 --> 01:23:59.115]  Last night, to be on the lookout for four people described as possible terror suspects who may be headed to the city.
[01:23:59.695 --> 01:24:06.816]  The four suspects have been in China and have now snuck in, and they think they might have something nuclear.
[01:24:07.656 --> 01:24:07.876]  Right.
[01:24:08.657 --> 01:24:18.718]  Well, I mean, now that King George II has been fully re-ensconced, you know, the dismantling of our country can now continue unabated.
[01:24:20.799 --> 01:24:22.579]  Well, it is conservative, after all.
[01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:32.801]  Yeah, well that's the thing and actually my sister who lives in Tennessee emailed me today regarding that.
[01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:37.362]  I mean it's amazing how much disinformation already seems to be appearing on the internet.
[01:24:38.402 --> 01:24:43.864]  She read something where there's actually a dirty bomb that's been planted in the city.
[01:24:45.365 --> 01:24:53.267]  Well it's all part of the fear mongering and I have no doubt that in the future the government, that is criminal elements of it, are going to carry out terror attacks.
[01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:56.982]  Yeah, they're going to do this as a pretext to expand control.
[01:24:57.002 --> 01:24:57.662]  It's real simple.
[01:24:57.702 --> 01:24:58.602]  Look at who has the motive.
[01:24:58.942 --> 01:25:02.243]  And every time we track back a terror attack, it goes back to the intelligence agencies.
[01:25:02.783 --> 01:25:11.204]  Well, yeah, the reason why I also called it, did you hear that also the FDA is now licensing a vaccine for bacterial meningitis?
[01:25:12.605 --> 01:25:13.925]  Well, they're trying every year.
[01:25:13.965 --> 01:25:18.746]  They come out with squadrons of new vaccines, and they want to make them basically all mandatory.
[01:25:19.006 --> 01:25:23.907]  Well, this past weekend, a 24-year-old man died from supposedly
[01:25:25.277 --> 01:25:30.866]  Bacterial meningitis at Eastern Nazarene College, which is a Christian college in the Boston suburb here.
[01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:47.603]  This fall, apparently the legislature wants to vote in a law that will become the first, Massachusetts will become the first state in the country to require all new students, not just freshmen, to be vaccinated.
[01:25:47.623 --> 01:25:48.183]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:48.203 --> 01:25:54.106]  There's no law that you have to be vaccinated unless you're a medical worker, but now they're trying to pass laws, D.C.'
[01:25:54.086 --> 01:26:02.271]  's tried to pass one, where every vaccine the government says you must take, you will take, like we're all in the military or something, even experimental vaccines,
[01:26:03.098 --> 01:26:04.959]  And, uh, you can trust the government.
[01:26:04.999 --> 01:26:06.479]  Just go ahead and take whatever they give you.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:16.323]  Right, and all the public health officials are saying how beneficial it is, and, uh... There's discussions of making people take the new AIDS vaccine, which doesn't even work, and may give you AIDS.
[01:26:16.363 --> 01:26:16.963]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:17.604 --> 01:26:18.604]  Really, uh, good points.
[01:26:18.644 --> 01:26:24.826]  Look, you know, let them clamp down and have a police state arrest you for no reason, and let them forcibly put things in your body.
[01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:26.947]  I mean, that's... that's freedom, folks.
[01:26:27.607 --> 01:26:30.849]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Alabama.
[01:26:30.889 --> 01:26:31.489]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:33.169]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:36.230]  Long-time listener, frequent caller from time to time.
[01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.952]  I had a question concerning some of the military troops.
[01:26:40.092 --> 01:26:48.256]  I've noticed that the flag on their shoulder is coming from inside the shoulder to the outside.
[01:26:48.377 --> 01:27:00.403]  My father, who was a veteran in Vietnam, he's passed away now, but his flag on his uniform went from the blue field was on the outside and starts running to the inside.
[01:27:01.195 --> 01:27:03.376]  I didn't know if there was any significance to that.
[01:27:03.496 --> 01:27:10.979]  A lot of people pointed this out, that they've changed the position of the flag, and everything is done in the military for a symbolic reason.
[01:27:11.379 --> 01:27:12.640]  I don't know the reason for that.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:20.783]  Okay, well, you had spoke something earlier about, you know, where the Constitution being, our Bill of Rights being trashed and all.
[01:27:21.043 --> 01:27:29.727]  I worked for a company, and I have bought all your films and made copies and given them to other people to help wake up my community.
[01:27:29.747 --> 01:27:30.067]  Thank you.
[01:27:30.661 --> 01:27:35.745]  And my boss man found out about it.
[01:27:36.266 --> 01:27:40.749]  He viewed one and then about four or five days passed.
[01:27:40.789 --> 01:27:51.518]  I come back in and they had a mandatory drug screen and I was chosen to have one and I refused to take one because I've always been at work.
[01:27:52.018 --> 01:27:55.881]  I've done a very good job and I refused to take it and they fired me for it.
[01:27:57.122 --> 01:28:02.146]  Well, that was the intimidation, and that guy thinks, like a good Nazi, that that's what you do.
[01:28:02.206 --> 01:28:06.130]  You be a secret police thug, you harass people that are into liberty and freedom.
[01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:07.171]  I think you ought to sue him.
[01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:13.316]  Well, I did contact the lawyer, and they just laughed at me and said, well, you know, what have you got to hide?
[01:28:13.396 --> 01:28:15.198]  And I told them, I said, it's not about hiding.
[01:28:15.298 --> 01:28:16.339]  It's the Fourth Amendment.
[01:28:16.399 --> 01:28:17.319]  How did we get to this?
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.404]  They're about to put cameras in the cars and turn every road, every public road, into a toll road.
[01:28:22.684 --> 01:28:23.144]  Exactly.
[01:28:23.185 --> 01:28:24.406]  You know, what do you have to hide?
[01:28:25.327 --> 01:28:26.847]  Now let him put a camera in your car!
[01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:29.968]  But see, we just accept this drug testing.
[01:28:30.209 --> 01:28:31.809]  You can tell if somebody's on drugs.
[01:28:32.029 --> 01:28:34.190]  You can tell if they don't perform well, fire them for that!
[01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:35.770]  You don't need drug testing.
[01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:38.891]  I'm really sorry to hear that, sir, but you'll be blessed for what you've done.
[01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:40.252]  Anything else?
[01:28:40.692 --> 01:28:42.912]  Well, no, just keep up the good work.
[01:28:43.273 --> 01:28:43.813]  God bless you.
[01:28:44.113 --> 01:28:45.033]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.493 --> 01:28:47.114]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.014 --> 01:28:50.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.136 --> 01:29:00.378]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[01:29:00.778 --> 01:29:03.419]  I use it, in fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[01:29:03.519 --> 01:29:09.681]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie, and it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:11.842]  And what it is, is a wedge device.
[01:29:12.302 --> 01:29:13.043]  Just a small one.
[01:29:13.383 --> 01:29:15.344]  That you put underneath your sacrum.
[01:29:15.644 --> 01:29:16.865]  And then you get down on it.
[01:29:16.905 --> 01:29:18.266]  You put your weight down on it.
[01:29:18.346 --> 01:29:18.906]  On the floor.
[01:29:19.346 --> 01:29:21.147]  And you let gravity do the work.
[01:29:21.548 --> 01:29:23.889]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away.
[01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:25.570]  Chiropractors go away.
[01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:26.751]  You don't need them anymore.
[01:29:27.071 --> 01:29:28.171]  You gotta give it a try.
[01:29:28.532 --> 01:29:30.693]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[01:29:31.253 --> 01:29:33.115]  Sacrowegi.com.
[01:29:33.455 --> 01:29:36.358]  You can call toll-free 1-800-737-9295 and get all the information you need.

[01:30:25.774 --> 01:30:29.297]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:30:53.658 --> 01:30:55.139]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:55.359 --> 01:31:02.701]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.002 --> 01:31:07.423]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:07.683 --> 01:31:17.527]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:18.288 --> 01:31:21.952]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.272 --> 01:31:24.795]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.075 --> 01:31:31.002]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.242 --> 01:31:32.804]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.044 --> 01:31:33.944]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.044 --> 01:31:37.025]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.185 --> 01:31:40.346]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:40.606 --> 01:31:42.307]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:31:43.807 --> 01:31:47.869]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:31:48.009 --> 01:31:48.909]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:32:01.966 --> 01:32:04.567]  We've got more callers from DC.
[01:32:04.607 --> 01:32:08.308]  We've got a gentleman in the protest right now, a listener.
[01:32:10.289 --> 01:32:14.050]  And we'll be going to Adam here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:16.450]  But I didn't plug my films in the last hour.
[01:32:16.491 --> 01:32:17.751]  I get so caught up in the news.
[01:32:18.691 --> 01:32:20.232]  But this broadcast won't be here.
[01:32:20.272 --> 01:32:21.552]  The websites won't be here.
[01:32:22.492 --> 01:32:26.254]  What we do won't be here if I don't promote my films and if you don't buy them.
[01:32:27.694 --> 01:32:30.955]  And they're the best, a lot of people have said this, the best patriot
[01:32:31.899 --> 01:32:35.540]  Real conservative, freedom-loving films out there.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.541]  They wake up liberals.
[01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:38.861]  They wake up conservatives.
[01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:40.962]  They wake up people who are in the false paradigm.
[01:32:41.242 --> 01:32:46.823]  Because we show you in the Globalist Own Words, their own video clips, their own documents, their master plan.
[01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:49.164]  My films all give you big views.
[01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:53.145]  They give you the big view and they focus in on individual facets.
[01:32:53.205 --> 01:32:57.326]  So they give you the up-close and then the wide-angle.
[01:32:58.683 --> 01:32:59.423]  And they're powerful!
[01:32:59.684 --> 01:33:01.265]  Police state 3 total enslavement.
[01:33:01.525 --> 01:33:03.006]  Gets into government sponsored terror.
[01:33:03.046 --> 01:33:04.687]  The architecture of the new world order.
[01:33:04.987 --> 01:33:06.448]  Their different sinister activities.
[01:33:06.628 --> 01:33:08.229]  It's 2 hours 44 minutes.
[01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:10.090]  Really 3 or 4 films in one.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:20.672]  Matrix of Evil's got congressman Ron Paul talking about how people that are for the world government run Washington and we're going into a world government and how they're going to enslave us.
[01:33:20.752 --> 01:33:22.254]  I mean, this is serious stuff, folks.
[01:33:22.574 --> 01:33:24.396]  That's ten minutes of the two-hour film.
[01:33:24.657 --> 01:33:28.682]  I mean, they just are so much, I can't describe what's in them because they just, they cover so much.
[01:33:29.386 --> 01:33:31.348]  American Dictators, my newest film.
[01:33:31.688 --> 01:33:34.831]  It's into the staged election of 2004, Bush and Kerry being cousins.
[01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:37.613]  Skull and Bones, how their policies are almost identical.
[01:33:37.874 --> 01:33:40.496]  We go through them, the latest 9-11 information.
[01:33:40.516 --> 01:33:44.159]  We go back to Bohemian Grove and show the occult activities, interview the locals.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.541]  Great film!
[01:33:47.362 --> 01:33:50.525]  1995 for the roughly two-hour film, a little bit under two hours.
[01:33:50.665 --> 01:33:51.445]  Each additional copy, $5.95.
[01:33:53.107 --> 01:33:54.268]  Still offering the special.
[01:33:55.945 --> 01:33:58.086]  Buy one copy, the next is $5.95.
[01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:02.767]  One of the best 9-11 films out there, bar none, is my film, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:03.587 --> 01:34:23.011]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terror, Oklahoma City, Gulf of Tonkin never happened, Operation Northwoods, first World Trade Center attack where the FBI cooked the bomb and drove the driver, it's admitted, second World Trade Center attack, and then the last third of it's the police state they're setting up with FEMA teaching that all Christians are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists.
[01:34:23.271 --> 01:34:25.192]  We got video of it in their own seminars.
[01:34:27.256 --> 01:34:28.596]  That's a film you gotta have.
[01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:29.917]  Buy one copy for $24.95.
[01:34:30.037 --> 01:34:32.118]  It's almost three hours long.
[01:34:32.518 --> 01:34:36.059]  Each additional copy $5.95 when you get the DVDs.
[01:34:36.619 --> 01:34:39.580]  VHS is $9.95 each additional copy.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:46.062]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and never think resistance is futile.
[01:34:46.682 --> 01:34:47.382]  Get the films.
[01:34:47.483 --> 01:34:48.183]  Make copies.
[01:34:48.263 --> 01:34:49.043]  Give them to people.
[01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:50.223]  Wake folks up.
[01:34:50.543 --> 01:34:55.145]  If you think things are bad now, folks, if we don't wake people up now, it's gonna get a lot worse a lot quicker.
[01:34:55.823 --> 01:35:04.731]  Only by exposing who was behind the terrorism, the globalists, can we then expose them to where they can't carry out more terror attacks because it will backfire on them.
[01:35:05.071 --> 01:35:06.413]  This is life and death, folks.
[01:35:07.353 --> 01:35:10.816]  And stuff may get real bad and you're going to wish you took action.
[01:35:11.257 --> 01:35:14.340]  Because these videos deprogram those that see them.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.861]  90% of those that see them wake up.
[01:35:17.102 --> 01:35:18.303]  Toll-free number to order.
[01:35:18.323 --> 01:35:20.526]  You can call and ask about the different titles, different specials.
[01:35:21.046 --> 01:35:22.648]  No obligation to buy, but give them a call.
[01:35:22.668 --> 01:35:22.728]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:22.748 --> 01:35:23.368]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:23.388 --> 01:35:24.750]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.

[01:35:58.234 --> 01:36:03.215]  And then of course, for those of you that are online, we have just put up 9-11,
[01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:12.679]  Emergency release, the film I put out just a month after 9-11, an emergency two-hour video presentation, but I stopped offering when Road to Tyranny came out.
[01:36:13.139 --> 01:36:15.621]  People keep requesting it, thinking it's a great film.
[01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:16.441]  I think it's pretty good.
[01:36:16.861 --> 01:36:23.765]  Well, the point is, that thing's not available anywhere but at PrisonPlanet.tv in high bandwidth and low bandwidth for 15 cents a day.
[01:36:23.865 --> 01:36:27.627]  My book, Paul Watson's book, two e-books, a bunch of other e-books, but those two are the best.
[01:36:29.267 --> 01:36:33.710]  All 11 of my films, dozens of other films that are wonderful, we've been authorized to post.
[01:36:34.531 --> 01:36:41.316]  My weekly TV show that normally you can only get in Austin, that's won Best of Austin by the way, twice in the Reader's Poll.
[01:36:41.376 --> 01:36:46.500]  Best TV show in Austin, beating out Austin City Limits in the UT football game in Reader's Poll.
[01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.142]  So it's a pretty good TV show.
[01:36:48.922 --> 01:36:51.463]  Uh, you know, shoot from the hip, real info, no scripting.
[01:36:51.944 --> 01:36:52.784]  Get that every week.
[01:36:53.084 --> 01:36:55.825]  Two installments of that most weeks, but I always do one show a week.
[01:36:56.485 --> 01:37:01.568]  Uh, just prisonplanet.tv and that makes the bandwidth and my three webmasters.
[01:37:03.829 --> 01:37:05.969]  We do this to try to, so they can be paid something.
[01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:09.351]  Um, we used to give it all away for free and uh,
[01:37:10.672 --> 01:37:13.553]  Start getting a $5,000 bandwidth bill a month, you gotta do something.
[01:37:13.993 --> 01:37:16.134]  So, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:37:16.374 --> 01:37:22.416]  Alright, let's go to an individual, Adam, on the street in D.C.
[01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.857]  and I talked to him during the break.
[01:37:25.497 --> 01:37:27.717]  Hold him down for a second so I can say this.
[01:37:28.258 --> 01:37:35.400]  We talked to him during the break and we found out why we didn't see any protesters even outside the first security line.
[01:37:36.494 --> 01:37:40.897]  Because the security people, basically, he was at the front of the line.
[01:37:40.957 --> 01:37:42.337]  It took him an hour and a half to get through.
[01:37:42.377 --> 01:37:51.483]  It was meant to hold everybody back from the main city streets, so his lordship, as soon as his lordship had gone through and gone up and given his speech, then they let everybody through.
[01:37:51.503 --> 01:37:53.364]  That's why you didn't see any protesters.
[01:37:53.744 --> 01:37:58.026]  So, swearing to protect and defend the Constitution while they shred it.
[01:37:58.427 --> 01:38:00.388]  Okay, Adam, go ahead and tell us about it, sir.
[01:38:00.888 --> 01:38:05.610]  Okay, I'm having a hard time hearing you, Alex, because there's so many protesters down here.
[01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:11.072]  That's why it's hard to stop people from coming into town, because it's a security checkpoint.
[01:38:11.112 --> 01:38:16.334]  But I'm sure there's at least 10,000 people right around the area that I am all chanting.
[01:38:16.394 --> 01:38:24.997]  And I think the only thing I'm remembering is the number of protesters or the number of police out on the street right now.
[01:38:25.557 --> 01:38:28.919]  Everywhere you look, you cannot walk in the whole city of D.C.
[01:38:30.262 --> 01:38:35.549]  Without seeing a police officer in your field of vision, if not hundreds or thousands of them in your field of vision.
[01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:42.359]  They're lining the whole length of Pennsylvania Avenue, shoulder to shoulder, just about, in some places, four or five rows deep.
[01:38:43.932 --> 01:38:58.797]  Um, the security checkpoints, they, when I arrived at the security check, the first of two security checkpoints that I looked through, I was in the front of the line and had to wait for about an hour and a half to get through the first screening point.
[01:38:58.957 --> 01:39:07.139]  When I turned around, I looked back and saw about at least 6,000 people or more behind me, waiting in line to go through that same checkpoint.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.961]  Upon coming through the first security checkpoint I got in,
[01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:15.142]  Got my bags all put together.
[01:39:15.882 --> 01:39:18.002]  Walked into a Starbucks to grab a coffee.
[01:39:18.042 --> 01:39:22.904]  Walked back out and had to go through another security checkpoint that lasted about another 15-20 minutes.
[01:39:23.304 --> 01:39:26.365]  Where they searched all of my bags again, my clothing.
[01:39:26.445 --> 01:39:28.485]  I had to take everything out of my pockets.
[01:39:30.386 --> 01:39:35.087]  And, uh... It's pretty loud down here, but...
[01:39:36.557 --> 01:39:43.623]  Yeah, whoever that poor fool is is calling for democracy.
[01:39:43.663 --> 01:39:48.107]  But try to get away... Can you get away to an area where there aren't as many protesters?
[01:39:48.267 --> 01:39:50.709]  Yeah, that's where I'm heading right now, actually.
[01:39:53.643 --> 01:39:55.484]  Well, it's kind of hard though.
[01:39:55.504 --> 01:39:56.945]  There's a lot of them out here now.
[01:39:57.185 --> 01:40:07.971]  Well, just to give you the other view, not, you know, inside the gauntlet and the belly of the beast, but watching television, watching all the different channels flipping around, they didn't show any protesters.
[01:40:08.051 --> 01:40:15.316]  Well, there's plenty of people with video cameras and plenty of people down here from the media filming all of this, so...
[01:40:17.955 --> 01:40:20.156]  I'll send you the video that I'm taking today.
[01:40:20.176 --> 01:40:29.921]  I wonder why they ignored that on the mainstream media.
[01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:33.002]  I don't know.
[01:40:33.022 --> 01:40:35.103]  They have a bleacher set up here.
[01:40:35.163 --> 01:40:36.223]  The bleachers are full.
[01:40:37.084 --> 01:40:41.906]  It's probably the only place that you can actually sit down to watch the parade that you don't have to pay 125 bucks a seat for.
[01:40:44.347 --> 01:40:45.467]  Yeah, no, explain that.
[01:40:45.567 --> 01:40:51.489]  They gave only one little bleacher area to protesters, but gave all the other bleachers to Minions.
[01:40:53.089 --> 01:40:57.051]  And we've heard that anti-war signs aren't allowed and crosses aren't allowed.
[01:40:57.391 --> 01:41:02.512]  They banned something for the left, they banned something for the right.
[01:41:02.532 --> 01:41:06.553]  They're very arbitrary about what they'll let you bring in and what they won't.
[01:41:06.673 --> 01:41:13.375]  I've seen a handful of people with backpacks all over the place, but when I went to the checkpoint, they were taking away people's backpacks.
[01:41:14.183 --> 01:41:20.608]  Um, a lot of people have really big signs that are about 3 foot by 20 foot in dimension.
[01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:26.253]  And when I went through the first security checkpoint, they were confiscating people who had signs that large.
[01:41:26.353 --> 01:41:28.294]  But when you get down here, there's tons of them.
[01:41:28.895 --> 01:41:33.918]  So, I don't even think all the security checkpoints are actually following the same rules.
[01:41:33.998 --> 01:41:37.241]  I think it's really arbitrary on what they're letting people bring in and what they aren't.
[01:41:37.581 --> 01:41:39.022]  Yeah, and I mean, there's no threat.
[01:41:39.122 --> 01:41:40.403]  It's not about security.
[01:41:40.684 --> 01:41:42.425]  It's about turning us out of these slaves.
[01:41:42.645 --> 01:41:43.306]  Exactly.
[01:41:43.506 --> 01:41:44.627]  What about military?
[01:41:45.227 --> 01:41:52.873]  Governor Ridge has reported that a Brigadier General is actually in command of the 50 police agencies that are there.
[01:41:52.893 --> 01:42:01.120]  I saw military lining the avenue when Lord Bush, when Caesar came to be coronated by the high priest.
[01:42:01.995 --> 01:42:06.858]  There are a lot of military people down here, but none of them are carrying any weapons that were visible.
[01:42:16.926 --> 01:42:21.309]  I haven't seen any military people walking around with machine guns.
[01:42:21.349 --> 01:42:30.775]  The worst I've seen were a couple of police officers walking around with shotguns and when I took their picture they kind of came after me and got pissed and yelled at me about it.
[01:42:31.015 --> 01:42:33.137]  Oh yeah, don't take their picture in America.
[01:42:33.157 --> 01:42:38.300]  They're going to put cameras all over us and in the school bathrooms and in the cars, but don't take a picture of them!
[01:42:39.581 --> 01:42:39.841]  Right.
[01:42:41.062 --> 01:42:42.183]  But I mean, for the most part,
[01:42:43.203 --> 01:42:44.803]  The police are leaving people alone.
[01:42:44.823 --> 01:42:46.784]  I haven't seen anybody getting roughed up.
[01:42:46.884 --> 01:42:49.605]  I haven't seen any protesters doing anything dumb either.
[01:42:50.065 --> 01:42:50.825]  It's pretty mellow.
[01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:59.087]  And I don't see anybody being that stupid because literally you cannot go 10 feet without running into a cop.
[01:42:59.647 --> 01:43:02.208]  A lot of the DC police are wearing ski masks.
[01:43:02.308 --> 01:43:03.788]  It is cold outside, but...
[01:43:04.321 --> 01:43:07.922]  You know, they do, a lot of them do have their faces covered with the black ski masks.
[01:43:08.383 --> 01:43:13.925]  Well, yeah, they do that out in summer, but that's always a sign of freedom when you have secret police.
[01:43:13.965 --> 01:43:14.905]  It's a sign of freedom.
[01:43:15.605 --> 01:43:15.866]  Uh-huh.
[01:43:17.466 --> 01:43:19.767]  Anything else, Adam, that you want to add?
[01:43:19.787 --> 01:43:24.649]  Um, pretty much they have every brand of police that you can imagine down here.
[01:43:24.689 --> 01:43:28.971]  They have groups of Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts with yellow uniforms on.
[01:43:28.991 --> 01:43:32.292]  They're walking around, too, acting just like the police.
[01:43:33.061 --> 01:43:42.347]  Well, have you seen Police State 2000 where in Hebron, Maryland, the Marines have 10-year-olds and 12-year-olds going and telling them where the guns are hidden?
[01:43:42.707 --> 01:43:43.068]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:44.889 --> 01:43:47.250]  So, they've actually got Hitler Youth out there.
[01:43:48.331 --> 01:43:49.051]  Sort of, yeah.
[01:43:49.352 --> 01:43:55.636]  I mean, most of them are grown-up, but... Yeah, they're grown-up Hitler Youth.
[01:43:58.613 --> 01:43:59.734]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:59.914 --> 01:44:07.019]  Alright, well, I want to thank you for joining us, Adam, and if anything else develops, call back in, okay?
[01:44:07.499 --> 01:44:07.800]  Alright.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.681]  In fact, I want to put you on hold.
[01:44:10.241 --> 01:44:10.822]  Are you there, Adam?
[01:44:11.282 --> 01:44:11.582]  I'm here.
[01:44:12.023 --> 01:44:18.827]  I'm going to put you on hold and give you the back extension, the hotline number, and if anything happens, I want you to call in, okay?
[01:44:19.168 --> 01:44:20.709]  Let me grab my pen real quick here.
[01:44:21.009 --> 01:44:23.811]  Yeah, we're going to put you on hold and we're going to get that information, okay?
[01:44:24.688 --> 01:44:24.928]  Okay.
[01:44:25.188 --> 01:44:25.789]  Appreciate it.
[01:44:26.169 --> 01:44:27.590]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:44:28.111 --> 01:44:31.833]  Rich and Rodney and Russ and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:44:32.974 --> 01:44:35.116]  And I want to go over what they're actually doing.
[01:44:35.196 --> 01:44:36.657]  We're now getting the new agenda.
[01:44:36.677 --> 01:44:42.101]  They're now telling us it's going to be banning guns, getting rid of the borders, increasing U.N.
[01:44:42.161 --> 01:44:48.745]  funding, taking over the churches with federal funds, tips programs, tattletale squadrons.
[01:44:48.766 --> 01:44:50.687]  I mean, I have mainstream news all today.
[01:44:51.127 --> 01:44:53.409]  Hillary Clinton working with Bush on taking over the churches.
[01:44:54.815 --> 01:44:56.716]  Gonzalez doesn't just want to have an assault weapons ban.
[01:44:56.756 --> 01:44:57.857]  He wants more gun control.
[01:44:57.877 --> 01:45:01.239]  He says, my brother's a SWAT team commander in Houston and we need it.
[01:45:02.119 --> 01:45:03.300]  And the NRA is silent.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:07.022]  But right now, I want to go ahead and play a few minutes of Lord Bush's speech.
[01:45:07.743 --> 01:45:11.325]  And I want to make comments on it and do this throughout the rest of the next hour.
[01:45:11.385 --> 01:45:14.626]  But go ahead and start rolling the Bush speech for me.
[01:45:14.646 --> 01:45:15.147]  Can we do that?
[01:45:17.108 --> 01:45:19.429]  Here is the speech from earlier today.
[01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:23.892]  Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter,
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:38.881]  President Bush, President Clinton, members of the United States Congress, Reverend Clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens.
[01:45:53.494 --> 01:46:08.045]  On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.
[01:46:10.407 --> 01:46:21.876]  I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that
[01:46:23.716 --> 01:46:26.398]  That I have sworn and you have witnessed.
[01:46:27.118 --> 01:46:28.679]  Alright, we'll go ahead and hit pause there.
[01:46:29.019 --> 01:46:35.102]  We tried to record this right off the White House website to play it and I was told that it wasn't cutting out, but it is.
[01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:41.185]  So we're going to go over the clip and maybe try to download the speech again clean for the next hour.
[01:46:42.751 --> 01:46:45.752]  And again, that wasn't edited, it was just bufferings, what the internet does.
[01:46:46.193 --> 01:46:47.873]  But you'd hear it stop, then repeat what he said.
[01:46:48.254 --> 01:46:50.775]  But right out of the gates, man, our Constitution's enduring.
[01:46:51.175 --> 01:46:52.636]  And that's all he said over and over again.
[01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:54.256]  The Constitution is enduring.
[01:46:54.757 --> 01:46:56.197]  God is on our side.
[01:46:56.857 --> 01:47:04.541]  Oh, the freedom is burning in our minds, and it warms those that love our freedom and our crusade, and it burns those that don't.
[01:47:05.473 --> 01:47:05.834]  Freedom!
[01:47:05.934 --> 01:47:06.274]  Freedom!
[01:47:06.354 --> 01:47:06.675]  Freedom!
[01:47:06.695 --> 01:47:07.536]  The Constitution!
[01:47:07.556 --> 01:47:07.936]  Freedom!
[01:47:08.016 --> 01:47:08.297]  Freedom!
[01:47:08.357 --> 01:47:08.677]  Freedom!
[01:47:08.737 --> 01:47:09.037]  Freedom!
[01:47:09.078 --> 01:47:09.358]  Freedom!
[01:47:09.858 --> 01:47:18.269]  And the different singers, it was all about God blessing us, and we marched with God, and freedom, and liberty, and it's the complete opposite of that!
[01:47:19.710 --> 01:47:22.434]  They're dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[01:47:23.217 --> 01:47:42.877]  And the Feds are taking over, not just every state government and every apparatus of power, but even private institutions are being bought up and controlled and regulated and Christians are being arrested for standing in designated protest areas and praying and being given the charge of 47 years in prison if they're convicted.
[01:47:44.264 --> 01:47:52.313]  Anti-war protesters that stand there peacefully with signs and free speech zones are being arrested and being given years in prison.
[01:47:52.913 --> 01:47:54.295]  Everybody's losing their freedoms.
[01:47:55.416 --> 01:47:59.140]  And this has nothing to do
[01:48:01.064 --> 01:48:02.705]  With keeping this country safe, folks.
[01:48:03.446 --> 01:48:16.116]  In the national ID card legislation that passed a month and a half ago, it actually says that our government is ordering the state governments, which it shouldn't be able to do, and banks and everybody else is saying, we accept consular matricula cards.
[01:48:16.176 --> 01:48:18.658]  We accept IDs issued by foreign governments.
[01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:22.181]  Which, the Mexican cards, you can go buy.
[01:48:24.043 --> 01:48:26.865]  But then under Patriot Act compliance with the first Patriot Act, citizens
[01:48:29.210 --> 01:48:30.671]  I'll make it as quick as I can.
[01:48:30.771 --> 01:48:35.953]  First of all, the oath that he took is not the oath in my Constitution.
[01:48:51.096 --> 01:48:51.737]  No, I noticed that, yes.
[01:49:12.628 --> 01:49:14.069]  For the United States.
[01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:17.452]  You know, you're pretty good in English, so you understand where I'm coming from.
[01:49:17.532 --> 01:49:20.434]  No, there's an incorporated United States government.
[01:49:20.575 --> 01:49:20.835]  Correct.
[01:49:20.975 --> 01:49:22.336]  Of America, and this is admitted.
[01:49:22.376 --> 01:49:23.477]  That's the District of Columbia.
[01:49:23.497 --> 01:49:24.598]  It's a private corporation.
[01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:27.540]  And then there is the United States.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:28.941]  And that's the oath he's taken to.
[01:49:29.001 --> 01:49:36.207]  Now, the Constitution, the correct way is the Constitution for the United States.
[01:49:36.848 --> 01:49:38.569]  For the several states of the Union, yes.
[01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:39.450]  Right, not of.
[01:49:40.683 --> 01:49:51.368]  So, I don't think that if we were to try to put this guy into retreason, I think his defense would get him off because, clearly, he's not taking the oath to my Constitution.
[01:49:51.388 --> 01:49:51.889]  Stay there.
[01:49:52.029 --> 01:49:52.969]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:52.989 --> 01:50:00.613]  This is what these lawyers... Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.933 --> 01:50:02.294]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.494 --> 01:50:03.875]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.855 --> 01:50:06.936]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.196 --> 01:50:12.139]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.479 --> 01:50:16.522]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.762 --> 01:50:18.543]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.623 --> 01:50:29.269]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.429 --> 01:50:31.290]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:59.789]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.009 --> 01:52:02.272]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:52:09.202 --> 01:52:09.802]  I think so.
[01:52:31.753 --> 01:52:33.514]  You can hear the desperation in our voices.
[01:53:01.368 --> 01:53:02.448]  We love this country.
[01:53:05.309 --> 01:53:08.630]  And it's being decimated.
[01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:14.372]  It's being forged into a tool of tyranny, not just domestically, but worldwide.
[01:53:15.372 --> 01:53:28.256]  And in the end, in the next 20 years or less, the CIA's own report admits, we're going to be a third world or second world country who would have been sucked dry and used to create a world government.
[01:53:29.815 --> 01:53:33.436]  Go ahead, Russ, continue what you were saying from West Virginia.
[01:53:34.056 --> 01:53:42.618]  Well, I don't know whether he has to sign a document swearing to this oath, but I'd like to see a copy of the document he signs.
[01:53:42.678 --> 01:53:46.819]  I'm willing to bet the United States is all capital letters in everything he signs.
[01:53:47.499 --> 01:53:56.001]  And in Article 2, Section 1 in my Constitution, it reads, word for word, Article 2, Section 1 in the United States Constitution.
[01:53:58.286 --> 01:54:00.308]  I'll just leave that for you out here to figure.
[01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:04.271]  I'm so disgusted with the whole situation.
[01:54:04.611 --> 01:54:07.793]  But anyway, I just wanted to bring that up about how important English is.
[01:54:09.995 --> 01:54:14.338]  No, you're absolutely right, and it's scary what's happening, my friend.
[01:54:15.299 --> 01:54:16.159]  Alrighty, thank you.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.461]  I appreciate the call.
[01:54:19.282 --> 01:54:22.004]  Let's go ahead and take another call before we go to the third hour.
[01:54:22.664 --> 01:54:23.225]  Let's talk to
[01:54:24.523 --> 01:54:26.204]  Rick in Ohio, go ahead.
[01:54:26.344 --> 01:54:30.547]  Hey Alex, it's Rick with the book about Five Side Economics.
[01:54:31.387 --> 01:54:41.673]  And you know, what I was going to mention about today was this, well first of all, what you were saying about infiltrating our society with this, I call it the lizard brain.
[01:54:43.234 --> 01:54:53.521]  If you go into our leading business schools that basically filter into large corporations, banks, brokers, insurance companies, Wall Street, Fortune 500,
[01:54:54.725 --> 01:54:59.006]  That's your first weeding out point.
[01:54:59.026 --> 01:55:00.526]  You know what I mean?
[01:55:00.626 --> 01:55:04.507]  That's where you're going to get that ideology.
[01:55:04.747 --> 01:55:06.447]  Yeah, the corporate board.
[01:55:06.947 --> 01:55:07.867]  Yeah, the corporate board.
[01:55:07.927 --> 01:55:12.888]  And then, you know, I think, have you ever looked into Liberty University over there?
[01:55:13.248 --> 01:55:13.968]  What's his name?
[01:55:14.068 --> 01:55:14.708]  University?
[01:55:14.728 --> 01:55:16.549]  Gary Falwell.
[01:55:17.869 --> 01:55:23.410]  Now, it seems that he, with his connections with the state,
[01:55:26.534 --> 01:55:34.657]  He seems to be running a minor league system to lobby people.
[01:55:34.977 --> 01:55:38.038]  Like you say, they're in our defense department.
[01:55:38.078 --> 01:55:42.940]  They're everywhere.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.361]  They become lobbyists.
[01:55:46.381 --> 01:55:48.742]  They join that whole environment.
[01:55:48.782 --> 01:55:51.743]  Like you say, it's from the little local newspaper.
[01:55:52.978 --> 01:55:57.101]  You know, all the way to General Electric and ABC.
[01:55:57.922 --> 01:56:00.103]  It's a giant good ol' boys network.
[01:56:00.263 --> 01:56:01.644]  It's a web of corruption.
[01:56:01.684 --> 01:56:02.385]  Thank you for the call.
[01:56:03.385 --> 01:56:05.847]  Since you brought this up, let me just go ahead and cover this.
[01:56:06.287 --> 01:56:08.328]  Again, Gonzalo supports assault weapons ban.
[01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:11.050]  San Francisco considering handgun ban.
[01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:17.895]  Then another one, thanks to Governor Pataki's support, landmark precedent blames gun manufacturers for firearms deaths.
[01:56:18.655 --> 01:56:20.937]  Republicans are giving you what Bill Clinton couldn't do.
[01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:23.355]  But Barbara Boxer couldn't do.
[01:56:24.275 --> 01:56:27.156]  Liability for gun makers, it'll be hailed as conservative.
[01:56:28.176 --> 01:56:43.622]  But here it is, Senator Clinton urges use of faith-based initiatives, Boston Globe, and it says she supports George Bush's faith-based initiative to spend tens of billions a year getting churches involved in government operations.
[01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:49.820]  There is no contradiction between support of faith-based initiatives and upholding our constitutional principles.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:59.484]  Senator Clinton, a New York Democrat who often is mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, she says she supports, energetically, President Bush's initiative and wants it to pass.
[01:57:00.825 --> 01:57:05.747]  And so Hillary Clinton, Jerry Falwell, all of them are for it because they're going to get money!
[01:57:07.848 --> 01:57:13.471]  The government involved paying churches to carry out the different social services.
[01:57:16.594 --> 01:57:20.756]  I have a lot of Christian friends who I talk to who are just like, good, we need the money, yeah.
[01:57:21.016 --> 01:57:22.617]  It's better than the liberals getting it.
[01:57:23.057 --> 01:57:29.741]  And you're for the vouchers too, but see those vouchers for education bring federal control into the private schools.
[01:57:30.261 --> 01:57:32.102]  See everything being taken over.
[01:57:33.002 --> 01:57:34.483]  You'll see, I'm against Hillary Clinton.
[01:57:35.664 --> 01:57:37.424]  I know you as conservatives are for her.
[01:57:38.365 --> 01:57:40.646]  Alright, then enjoy the world you're building.
[01:57:50.177 --> 01:57:50.797]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.458 --> 01:57:52.538]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.238 --> 01:57:54.319]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.979 --> 01:57:55.820]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.580 --> 01:57:57.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.141 --> 01:58:01.983]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.323 --> 01:58:06.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.465 --> 01:58:17.290]  9-11, three and a half years ago, was a coup d'etat.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.882]  Against the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[01:58:22.803 --> 01:58:32.871]  And now a lake, an ocean of tyranny that was held up by the dam that was in the Congress is broken.
[01:58:34.852 --> 01:58:35.593]  We've got Bush
[01:58:37.722 --> 01:58:47.250]  And his minions running around talking about how God's on their side, and how it's all about the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and how they're giving us all this liberty, when the exact opposite is happening.
[01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:55.336]  We're going to take a ton of your calls this hour, play some more clips of Lord Bush's speech, and where he took the Oath of Office, which he totally violated.
[01:58:55.356 --> 01:59:03.262]  And I want to go over that Oath of Office, and then I want to go over the Bill of Rights itself, and ask yourself, is this being violated?
[01:59:03.282 --> 01:59:05.224]  And give examples of that.
[01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:08.663]  Right now, let's talk to Rodney in Tennessee.
[01:59:08.783 --> 01:59:09.704]  Rodney, go ahead.
[01:59:10.324 --> 01:59:11.925]  Well, this is Rodney in Texas.
[01:59:12.606 --> 01:59:14.647]  Alright, well, I was told Tennessee, but go ahead, sir.
[01:59:14.968 --> 01:59:21.412]  Well, regarding the protesters on C-SPAN 2, they're giving live footage.
[01:59:22.733 --> 01:59:31.420]  I just want to, if anybody wants to tune in to that, it is being tele... well, anyway, it's been televised on C-SPAN 2.
[01:59:32.681 --> 01:59:44.564]  Good, because I wondered why from like 8 in the morning until 10.30 when I left the office to come in, I wonder why I flipped around all the channels and nowhere did they show protesters.
[01:59:45.964 --> 01:59:54.666]  And now we found out from protesters in the protest, the people at the front of the line were held back for an hour and a half this morning, weren't even allowed in.
[01:59:55.768 --> 02:00:16.474]  Well, and by the way, on C-SPAN 1, they're taking phone callers in there, and the people that have flipped over to C-SPAN 2 are seeing all of those protesters, and we're talking thousands and thousands of protesters, getting a lot of irate people who are saying, you know, this is outrageous.
[02:00:16.974 --> 02:00:18.775]  This is absolutely outrageous.
[02:00:18.795 --> 02:00:19.635]  You know, they, on one
[02:00:20.183 --> 02:00:38.808]  On all of the mainstream channels, news channels, CNN and Fox and they're portraying it as everybody is in love with the King, Hitler and Bush and so on and so forth, but when you see all of these protesters over on C-SPAN 2 is telling a whole different story.
[02:00:38.828 --> 02:00:39.568]  Oh, that's incredible!
[02:00:39.628 --> 02:00:40.689]  Please tape that!
[02:00:41.309 --> 02:00:44.830]  I'm trying to tape it at my other office, but
[02:00:46.512 --> 02:00:51.654]  So people are calling in and noticing that the news isn't showing the protest, but C-SPAN is?
[02:00:51.834 --> 02:00:54.015]  Oh yeah, yeah, it's really funny.
[02:00:54.075 --> 02:01:01.879]  I mean, the callers calling in, you know, they have their little telephone calling thing there and getting the response.
[02:01:01.979 --> 02:01:04.279]  So other people are noticing what I'm noticing?
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:07.841]  Yeah, well... They're noticing that, because I was watching, I'm like, where are the protesters?
[02:01:08.081 --> 02:01:14.243]  Well, now see they have the line for Bush supporters and then they have the line for people who oppose Bush.
[02:01:14.283 --> 02:01:19.805]  And the people who are calling in on the Bush line are saying that those protesters are awful.
[02:01:19.865 --> 02:01:24.467]  They ought to be thankful for the freedoms that they enjoy.
[02:01:25.608 --> 02:01:36.517]  But the people who are opposing George Bush are saying, this is awful that the protesters aren't being shown on the mainstream channels.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.243]  What's really going on is only being aired, and it's being aired on C-SPAN too.
[02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:50.968]  So to answer your question, yeah, they're seeing what you're seeing, but C-SPAN is trying to be fair.
[02:01:53.413 --> 02:01:59.618]  Callers from both sides of the political fence air their views.
[02:02:00.178 --> 02:02:17.611]  Anyway, I wanted to ask you, Alex, I had a discussion with a neoconservative talk show host about a story that you shared yesterday regarding Tom Ridge and how he expects to employ this polling state that we're seeing in D.C.
[02:02:18.579 --> 02:02:30.806]  over the rest of the country and I unfortunately gave him the wrong news source, but I heard you earlier say that that's the statement Rich made regarding that we're on this army website.
[02:02:30.826 --> 02:02:33.427]  What is that website and where can I go on your website?
[02:02:33.467 --> 02:02:35.148]  Yeah, stay there and I'll talk about it after the break.
[02:02:36.609 --> 02:02:37.410]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:40.612]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com!
[02:02:48.234 --> 02:02:53.701]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:58.387]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:58.607 --> 02:03:05.616]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:06.016 --> 02:03:12.122]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.262 --> 02:03:13.503]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.823 --> 02:03:16.786]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.926 --> 02:03:18.968]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.268 --> 02:03:26.514]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.815 --> 02:03:30.198]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:30.598 --> 02:03:33.760]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[02:03:34.101 --> 02:03:35.041]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:35.061 --> 02:03:35.261]  Call today.
[02:03:45.962 --> 02:03:47.583]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.723 --> 02:03:51.807]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.967 --> 02:03:54.849]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.929 --> 02:04:01.654]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:04.837]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:05.037 --> 02:04:07.439]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.559 --> 02:04:15.465]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:15.745 --> 02:04:27.034]  Methazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:04:27.194 --> 02:04:34.941]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.961 --> 02:04:35.401]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.461 --> 02:04:37.162]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.251 --> 02:04:49.598]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.778 --> 02:04:54.205]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.345 --> 02:04:58.732]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.772 --> 02:05:00.134]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.875 --> 02:05:01.855]  Panama.
[02:05:01.896 --> 02:05:06.117]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.177 --> 02:05:13.120]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.301]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.601 --> 02:05:25.945]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.245 --> 02:05:27.005]  If you want to understand
[02:05:27.065 --> 02:05:32.667]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:32.767 --> 02:05:34.648]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.001]  And the caller earlier was right.
[02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:16.585]  I want to go over Bush's changed oath of office, which is different than what's in the Constitution.
[02:06:17.106 --> 02:06:17.966]  Ah, but so what?
[02:06:18.006 --> 02:06:21.969]  While you're swearing to the Constitution, go ahead and violate it even in your oath.
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:24.411]  The people won't know.
[02:06:24.431 --> 02:06:31.577]  I mean, you know, they don't even know how many continents there are, or how many states are in the Union, or who the Vice President is.
[02:06:31.637 --> 02:06:33.358]  Most high school seniors, the majority, don't know.
[02:06:34.986 --> 02:06:47.764]  They've been brainwashed quite nicely, so I want to go over that later and read over the evil Bill of Rights, because FEMA says those that make frequent references to the Constitution are bad.
[02:06:48.505 --> 02:06:50.107]  Boy, we really have a great government.
[02:06:51.058 --> 02:07:01.926]  But Rodney in Texas, you said you were talking to a Neocon talk show host and what, were they denying that Governor Ridge is openly saying he wants to go to Posse Comitatus?
[02:07:02.786 --> 02:07:07.409]  Hold on, were they denying that there are ten different military groups in D.C.
[02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:08.430]  running this?
[02:07:09.591 --> 02:07:11.432]  I mean, what was your discussion?
[02:07:12.072 --> 02:07:14.934]  Well, first, they were actually taken aback.
[02:07:15.195 --> 02:07:18.217]  In fact, the guy said,
[02:07:19.727 --> 02:07:31.734]  He says at the tail end of me telling him and I inadvertently gave him the wrong website I said that I had gotten my source from the Washington Post and I'm sorry I did that but
[02:07:32.863 --> 02:07:36.306]  Well, no, the Washington Post mentioned the military were involved in security.
[02:07:36.426 --> 02:07:39.749]  Right, but the statement that I made... Well, regardless.
[02:07:39.889 --> 02:07:41.110]  So you're sitting there talking to him.
[02:07:41.370 --> 02:07:50.498]  So he basically said, well, obviously this caller took these comments that Tom Ridge made out of context.
[02:07:51.098 --> 02:07:52.880]  Callers like that always do.
[02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:54.061]  This caller?
[02:07:54.321 --> 02:07:55.542]  Well, he was referring to me.
[02:07:56.266 --> 02:08:05.452]  He was saying that I had taken a statement that Tom Ridge made about employing the police state and the test, that this was a test.
[02:08:05.592 --> 02:08:07.553]  Okay, well do this, okay?
[02:08:08.692 --> 02:08:15.674]  Type in, Governor Ridge, or Homeland Security Director, Governor Ridge, calls for repeal of Posse Comuntatis.
[02:08:16.374 --> 02:08:21.356]  You'll get articles going back three years ago before he was even confirmed as Homeland Security Director.
[02:08:21.736 --> 02:08:21.936]  Right.
[02:08:22.136 --> 02:08:25.117]  But, uh, you will get, I mean, I've got Fox News clips, you name it.
[02:08:25.417 --> 02:08:25.717]  Okay?
[02:08:26.257 --> 02:08:36.120]  Now, if you go to InfoWars.com, and there's a calendar, and you click on last Friday,
[02:08:36.952 --> 02:08:43.275]  Or a lot of times it's the day after that, because the archive saved for the 14th is actually the archive for the 13th.
[02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:44.515]  It's like newspapers.
[02:08:45.115 --> 02:08:47.156]  So you'll probably want to click a few days later.
[02:08:47.797 --> 02:08:50.778]  Up at the top, it says Marshall Law in D.C.
[02:08:50.838 --> 02:08:51.638]  or something like that.
[02:08:52.338 --> 02:08:55.900]  And you click on it, and there'll be about eight different news articles right there.
[02:08:57.401 --> 02:09:03.083]  And one of those links to a subpage of the army.mil website.
[02:09:04.071 --> 02:09:07.897]  And it's huge photos, video clips of Ridge talking to the troops.
[02:09:08.478 --> 02:09:13.906]  It's the Brigadier General standing on a big map, giving orders to all the police.
[02:09:14.936 --> 02:09:20.581]  And it says that this is how they're going to integrate, and this is for the rest of the country.
[02:09:20.942 --> 02:09:23.644]  And it's right there, and you can send it to him.
[02:09:23.664 --> 02:09:28.468]  But, sir, you could have sent him that, and that talk show host would have denied that as well.
[02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:33.533]  I know, but it just made me mad because... What talk show was this?
[02:09:33.553 --> 02:09:38.577]  It's a radio station that comes on overnight on KMOX out of St.
[02:09:38.618 --> 02:09:38.878]  Louis.
[02:09:39.808 --> 02:10:07.831]  uh... eleven twenty a m it's a big uh... talk show but this guy does this to me all the time you know in the first thing he'll say is all it's got to be a urban legend a conspiracy theory or this guy took this out of context you know the urban legend website list uh... just all sorts of things that are publicly known as urban legends yeah well you know he but regardless you know that's like rumsfeld uh... when he got up on face the nation
[02:10:08.908 --> 02:10:09.669]  Well, and the thing is...
[02:10:23.379 --> 02:10:27.645]  They depend on their listeners, uh, not checking, you know, the facts.
[02:10:27.705 --> 02:10:37.638]  And that's the reason why I really, I'm like you, I take pride in making sure that I give the source and the facts because I know that these guys... But wait a minute, is this guy hiding under a rock?
[02:10:37.698 --> 02:10:39.120]  I mean, he has to know that they're running...
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:41.621]  A military checkpoints all over the country?
[02:10:41.641 --> 02:10:42.641]  That's been all over the news!
[02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:45.483]  Now, here's his response to that, Alex.
[02:10:45.523 --> 02:10:53.266]  He says, well, if it is true, and you don't like it, if you don't like it, then you need to go out and vote against it.
[02:10:54.107 --> 02:10:56.027]  Oh, with the new special electronic voting machines.
[02:10:56.047 --> 02:10:56.808]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:57.288 --> 02:10:58.028]  I appreciate the call.
[02:10:58.509 --> 02:11:04.371]  We're going to go to more calls here in a few minutes, but I want to play Dick Cheney, and then George W. Bush's swearing in.
[02:11:05.032 --> 02:11:08.193]  I want to play this one more time, then I want to go over the Bill of Rights just quickly.
[02:11:09.412 --> 02:11:11.094]  Here it is.
[02:11:11.114 --> 02:11:12.775]  I, Richard Cheney, do solemnly swear.
[02:11:13.296 --> 02:11:15.018]  I, Richard Cheney, do solemnly swear.
[02:11:15.158 --> 02:11:18.921]  That I will defend and support the Constitution of the United States.
[02:11:19.222 --> 02:11:22.024]  That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:11:22.044 --> 02:11:23.946]  Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:11:24.207 --> 02:11:26.088]  Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:11:26.309 --> 02:11:28.831]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[02:11:29.332 --> 02:11:31.854]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[02:11:31.974 --> 02:11:33.696]  That I will take this obligation freely.
[02:11:34.457 --> 02:11:36.118]  That I take this obligation freely.
[02:11:36.478 --> 02:11:38.899]  Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:42.321]  Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:45.943]  And I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of my office.
[02:11:46.343 --> 02:11:49.665]  And I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office.
[02:11:50.205 --> 02:11:52.206]  On which I'm about to enter, so help me God.
[02:11:52.386 --> 02:11:54.527]  On which I'm about to enter, so help me God.
[02:11:54.547 --> 02:11:55.328]  Congratulations.
[02:12:01.067 --> 02:12:04.290]  And then here is Lord Bush being sworn in.
[02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:08.914]  Will you raise your right hand, Mr. President, and repeat after me.
[02:12:10.175 --> 02:12:24.907]  I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability
[02:12:27.213 --> 02:12:28.935]  Preserve, protect, and defend.
[02:12:28.955 --> 02:12:30.737]  Preserve, protect, and defend.
[02:12:30.937 --> 02:12:32.919]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:12:32.939 --> 02:12:34.641]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:12:34.721 --> 02:12:35.602]  So help me God.
[02:12:35.662 --> 02:12:36.463]  So help me God.
[02:12:36.763 --> 02:12:42.829]  Congratulations.
[02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:46.393]  Alright, now let's go over the First Amendment.
[02:12:47.299 --> 02:13:00.249]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people, to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:07.374]  They're taking over the churches, they're regulating, like never before, seizing churches all over the country.
[02:13:08.314 --> 02:13:11.737]  They are restricting and arresting people for their free speech all over the country.
[02:13:12.337 --> 02:13:19.262]  They're paying off the press, and literally thousands of media people are paid off by the federal government and get paychecks.
[02:13:19.322 --> 02:13:21.644]  I've told you this for years, now you've seen it in the mainstream news.
[02:13:22.645 --> 02:13:26.968]  And they're violating our right to assemble on public sidewalks, you name it, all over the nation.
[02:13:28.732 --> 02:13:29.552]  Like never before.
[02:13:29.652 --> 02:13:31.253]  So that is in tatters.
[02:13:32.213 --> 02:13:33.074]  Ah, the Second Amendment.
[02:13:34.394 --> 02:13:41.217]  A well-regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
[02:13:42.838 --> 02:13:52.421]  In the Federalist Papers, the news articles, everything the Founding Fathers wrote, it's the individual to throw off tyranny and defend yourself against street thugs and Bush under zero tolerance.
[02:13:53.442 --> 02:13:56.503]  They're grabbing people left and right for petty things with guns.
[02:13:58.032 --> 02:14:05.477]  They're putting in judges who were anti-gun, Alberto Gonzales is vehemently anti-gun, and nobody's talking about it.
[02:14:05.497 --> 02:14:13.363]  Amendment 3, no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
[02:14:15.264 --> 02:14:17.006]  And that means militarized police.
[02:14:17.026 --> 02:14:18.567]  I mean, our police are already military.
[02:14:18.607 --> 02:14:19.628]  They call us civilians.
[02:14:20.028 --> 02:14:21.449]  So we're not supposed to have to pay for it.
[02:14:21.489 --> 02:14:24.371]  That was the form of taxation then, was having to give them a room.
[02:14:26.047 --> 02:14:26.748]  Fourth Amendment.
[02:14:26.788 --> 02:14:29.510]  Boy, this one's really gone, but they keep acting like it's there.
[02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:32.512]  Well, the Fourth Amendment says we can have cameras in the bathrooms.
[02:14:32.532 --> 02:14:35.013]  The Fourth Amendment says we can listen to you on your cell phone without a warrant.
[02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:41.178]  Federal judges rule they can put satellite trackers in your cars, already done it, without warrants.
[02:14:41.838 --> 02:15:02.090]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, that is, you got witnesses who are under oath in public saying this is in the house, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[02:15:03.411 --> 02:15:08.074]  That means once you get the eyewitness and the warrant, you don't go on a fishing expedition.
[02:15:10.279 --> 02:15:13.540]  Continuing, Fifth Amendment, and of course they're violating that just at every level.
[02:15:14.161 --> 02:15:21.304]  No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment of an indictment of a grand jury.
[02:15:22.104 --> 02:15:34.269]  They're grabbing citizens left and right, doctors, lawyers, people for the most petty of things they're alleging, holding them for seven years in solitary confinement, force-drugging them.
[02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:38.071]  Just type in Dr. Charles T. Sell if you want to find out about that.
[02:15:40.001 --> 02:15:41.282]  And it goes on and on.
[02:15:42.923 --> 02:15:47.445]  And it says, nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice in jeopardy of life or limb.
[02:15:47.465 --> 02:15:48.526]  That happens all the time now.
[02:15:48.946 --> 02:15:55.609]  Nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, and property without due process of law.
[02:15:56.170 --> 02:15:58.771]  Well, they come to your house for the census.
[02:15:59.972 --> 02:16:04.734]  They're supposed to just ask how many people live in the house, but now they've got 54 question questionnaires.
[02:16:04.774 --> 02:16:05.915]  Now they're going to go out yearly
[02:16:07.783 --> 02:16:09.264]  They arrest people all the time.
[02:16:09.304 --> 02:16:12.225]  They call it resisting without violence if you don't answer questions.
[02:16:12.265 --> 02:16:13.586]  Supreme Court just ruled that.
[02:16:16.107 --> 02:16:16.927]  Just all the time.
[02:16:16.967 --> 02:16:19.608]  Judges put people in jail for months for not answering questions.
[02:16:20.749 --> 02:16:22.189]  No more Fifth Amendment, boys and girls.
[02:16:23.690 --> 02:16:25.611]  Sixth Amendment in all criminal prosecutions.
[02:16:25.651 --> 02:16:28.432]  The accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.
[02:16:29.253 --> 02:16:29.773]  All the time.
[02:16:29.813 --> 02:16:31.914]  They just have judge-only trials in this country.
[02:16:31.934 --> 02:16:32.394]  Did you know that?
[02:16:34.176 --> 02:16:35.658]  Or the judges just ignore the jury.
[02:16:36.018 --> 02:16:38.040]  The jury found the Branch Davidians not guilty.
[02:16:38.821 --> 02:16:42.084]  In 1994, he found them guilty and some are still in prison.
[02:16:43.185 --> 02:16:51.773]  By an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall be previously
[02:16:52.947 --> 02:16:57.431]  Accredited by law and to be informed of the nature of the cause or the accusation.
[02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:00.333]  They don't even tell you what you're charged with now, these terror laws.
[02:17:00.753 --> 02:17:02.855]  To be confronted with the witnesses against him?
[02:17:03.275 --> 02:17:03.435]  Ha!
[02:17:04.016 --> 02:17:04.256]  Yeah.
[02:17:04.656 --> 02:17:07.038]  Carpet cleaner thinks they smell marijuana in your house.
[02:17:07.378 --> 02:17:08.379]  You get SWAT teamed.
[02:17:08.399 --> 02:17:10.561]  No, we're not going to tell you who it was.
[02:17:10.581 --> 02:17:17.166]  To have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.
[02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:24.455]  Now you say you want to be your own counsel, they say no, and they appoint somebody who's paid by the government against you.
[02:17:25.836 --> 02:17:30.039]  And it goes on and on, they're all being violated, they're all being destroyed, they're all being dismantled.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:33.561]  Once it's gone, it's hard to reaffirm.
[02:17:33.581 --> 02:17:42.428]  But they got the nerve, every other sentence about freedom, liberty, we're so free, we're so free, surrounded by men in black ski masks with machine guns.
[02:17:45.951 --> 02:17:50.174]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[02:17:50.935 --> 02:17:59.201]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.

[02:18:33.486 --> 02:18:33.626]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:18:47.432 --> 02:18:49.754]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[02:18:49.774 --> 02:18:51.095]  The Real Money Folks.
[02:18:54.397 --> 02:18:56.318]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:56.819 --> 02:18:57.679]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:57.719 --> 02:18:58.900]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:18:59.300]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.722]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:19:01.742 --> 02:19:04.003]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:15.638 --> 02:19:17.980]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.283]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:21.883 --> 02:19:24.926]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:46.368 --> 02:19:48.872]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.573 --> 02:19:59.130]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:09.744]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:20:10.765 --> 02:20:16.267]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:17.068 --> 02:20:24.771]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.472 --> 02:20:27.353]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800
[02:20:28.882 --> 02:20:28.922]  516-8736.
[02:20:29.022 --> 02:20:29.703]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.743 --> 02:20:29.944]  Call now.

[02:20:45.848 --> 02:20:56.597]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:20:56.757 --> 02:21:04.344]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:21:04.604 --> 02:21:07.747]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:21:08.007 --> 02:21:13.770]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:20.193]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:21:20.553 --> 02:21:24.455]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:21:24.495 --> 02:21:26.376]  The water level is always visible.
[02:21:26.556 --> 02:21:28.316]  So, go ahead and celebrate that George Bush is your president.
[02:21:28.377 --> 02:21:29.557]  It didn't matter who got in.
[02:21:53.129 --> 02:21:56.631]  The New World Order moves forward, butchering everything America really is.
[02:21:59.112 --> 02:22:00.352]  And the Bill of Rights continues.
[02:22:00.372 --> 02:22:01.673]  We'll go to your calls here soon.
[02:22:01.793 --> 02:22:05.034]  I want to go over this, though, and then compare it to the Communist Manifesto here briefly.
[02:22:05.054 --> 02:22:10.256]  It continues with the Eighth Amendment.
[02:22:10.776 --> 02:22:16.799]  Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
[02:22:17.891 --> 02:22:28.375]  And if you don't think all, you know, excessive stuff for non-violent offenders, excessive fines for petty things, they criminalize all the stuff that's no big deal or isn't really illegal, shouldn't be.
[02:22:29.016 --> 02:22:31.937]  And then for murderers, they get an average of four and a half years.
[02:22:31.997 --> 02:22:35.198]  And then we're terrified by the murderers and go, give us more police state.
[02:22:35.218 --> 02:22:36.559]  And they go, sure, it'll be for you.
[02:22:37.239 --> 02:22:45.062]  Ninth Amendment, the enumeration of the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[02:22:46.044 --> 02:22:48.645]  That's just saying, you've got God-given rights, you're not a slave.
[02:22:50.025 --> 02:22:50.405]  Amendment 10!
[02:22:51.846 --> 02:22:53.346]  Tell me the feds haven't violated this.
[02:22:53.366 --> 02:23:03.029]  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.
[02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:09.191]  Again, folks, the limited powers of the central government, that's all they've got.
[02:23:10.208 --> 02:23:17.889]  The powers designated to the United States by the Constitution, or prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people.
[02:23:18.210 --> 02:23:19.370]  We are the government.
[02:23:19.430 --> 02:23:20.430]  We are the power.
[02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:23.250]  We're not the civilians.
[02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:26.671]  Notice, we call the government people authorities.
[02:23:27.251 --> 02:23:28.071]  Officials.
[02:23:28.732 --> 02:23:30.832]  And they call us civilians.
[02:23:31.052 --> 02:23:32.292]  Get back, civilians!
[02:23:32.892 --> 02:23:35.133]  That's what they call them in Iraq, in a military dictatorship.
[02:23:35.313 --> 02:23:36.253]  Get back, civilians!
[02:23:37.822 --> 02:23:41.164]  How many times have I had cops at protests scream at me, GET BACK CIVILIAN!
[02:23:42.485 --> 02:23:43.986]  And brandish their armaments.
[02:23:45.247 --> 02:23:46.688]  See, they're the overclass.
[02:23:47.248 --> 02:23:48.989]  They are the officials.
[02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:50.871]  We are the civilians.
[02:23:51.311 --> 02:23:52.972]  You're all civilians too, government.
[02:23:53.392 --> 02:23:55.254]  In fact, you're the lowest level of civilian.
[02:23:55.814 --> 02:23:58.396]  Uh, you're the, uh, CIVILIANS!
[02:23:58.416 --> 02:23:59.917]  Of course, you don't want to hear that.
[02:24:01.037 --> 02:24:04.580]  Of course, in another system, you are the official.
[02:24:09.051 --> 02:24:10.912]  The abolition of private property.
[02:24:10.932 --> 02:24:11.913]  This is from my book.
[02:24:12.033 --> 02:24:16.656]  I wrote a page comment on this and I want to read the Communist Manifesto and we'll go to your calls.
[02:24:17.396 --> 02:24:19.397]  Know your enemy, the Communist Manifesto.
[02:24:19.838 --> 02:24:23.040]  Some people think that we're fighting an international communist conspiracy.
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.222]  In reality, communism is merely a bastard child of the new world order.
[02:24:27.702 --> 02:24:37.008]  Communism consolidates the people's wealth into the hands of the all-powerful central state and national sovereignty is then collapsed into the greater hegemony of world government.
[02:24:37.555 --> 02:24:45.039]  Nevertheless, it is a vitally important exercise to read the Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx and Engels in 1847.
[02:24:47.558 --> 02:24:57.326]  In this exercise, examine each of the ten planks, and then compare them to the corrupt political climate of the United States, our laws, government structures, and the outlook of the American people.
[02:24:57.746 --> 02:25:06.273]  It is clear to anyone who has a rudimentary understanding of political systems that the globalists have implemented at least eight of the planks in the United States.
[02:25:06.614 --> 02:25:16.802]  With the other two partially in place, we, as Americans, have to be concerned, and, turning the page here,
[02:25:17.768 --> 02:25:19.549]  Oh, turned the wrong page.
[02:25:19.629 --> 02:25:31.337]  We as Americans have to be concerned and angry about the occupational government and how we're being conditioned to become practicing communists.
[02:25:31.497 --> 02:25:42.545]  This is what the global banking cartels wanted all along, to sell the people on accepting feudalism by packaging it as a movement for and by the people.
[02:25:43.165 --> 02:25:45.867]  And then the ten planks of the communist manifesto.
[02:25:46.764 --> 02:25:51.246]  Number one, abolition of private property and the application of all rent for public purposes.
[02:25:51.687 --> 02:25:53.688]  The property tax, all the regulations.
[02:25:53.948 --> 02:25:59.110]  And again, it's the big corporations that are bigger than our government controlling it, taking our wealth and giving it to themselves.
[02:25:59.470 --> 02:26:03.072]  Number two, a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
[02:26:03.492 --> 02:26:05.834]  This is written a hundred years ago.
[02:26:06.454 --> 02:26:09.075]  Number three, abolition of all rights of inheritance.
[02:26:10.196 --> 02:26:10.616]  Look at that.
[02:26:10.896 --> 02:26:14.458]  Number four, confiscation of property of all immigrants and rebels.
[02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:19.611]  Now back then they meant that as criminals, you know, trying to run from them.
[02:26:19.651 --> 02:26:21.172]  The criminals, anybody that didn't submit.
[02:26:21.492 --> 02:26:22.972]  So four is a little different today.
[02:26:23.693 --> 02:26:31.255]  Number five, centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with the state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
[02:26:33.016 --> 02:26:37.517]  Centralization of the means of communication and transportation in the hands of the state.
[02:26:37.537 --> 02:26:40.318]  Look at all the executive orders, FEMA, the shadow government.
[02:26:40.619 --> 02:26:44.760]  Number seven, extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state
[02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:53.276]  The bringing into cultivation of wastelands and the improvement of social and soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
[02:26:54.097 --> 02:26:55.838]  All the federal control over farming.
[02:26:56.318 --> 02:27:02.943]  Number eight, equal liability of all to labor establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
[02:27:04.344 --> 02:27:06.526]  What do they do with the seven million people in prisons?
[02:27:07.763 --> 02:27:10.685]  9.
[02:27:07.843 --> 02:27:10.685]  Combination of agriculture, manufacturing, and industries.
[02:27:10.725 --> 02:27:17.551]  Gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country by a more equitable distribution of the population of the country.
[02:27:17.912 --> 02:27:17.551]  10.
[02:27:18.352 --> 02:27:20.774]  Free education for all children in government schools.
[02:27:21.254 --> 02:27:24.217]  Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form.
[02:27:24.818 --> 02:27:28.301]  Combination of education with industrial production, etc.
[02:27:28.861 --> 02:27:29.862]  Goals 2000.
[02:27:30.202 --> 02:27:31.504]  No child left behind.
[02:27:32.244 --> 02:27:33.325]  You know the rest of the story.
[02:27:33.365 --> 02:27:34.166]  Your call is coming up.
[02:27:36.212 --> 02:27:39.194]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.214 --> 02:27:42.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.461 --> 02:27:49.542]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:27:50.263 --> 02:27:53.766]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:27:54.366 --> 02:27:57.869]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:01.097]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:28:01.117 --> 02:28:03.978]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:28:04.498 --> 02:28:05.919]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:28:06.619 --> 02:28:08.339]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:09.840]  Check with your doctor.
[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:14.862]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[02:28:15.322 --> 02:28:20.043]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[02:28:20.704 --> 02:28:21.544]  Light up your life.
[02:28:21.644 --> 02:28:24.305]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a northern light.
[02:28:24.881 --> 02:28:35.147]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com.

[02:28:45.512 --> 02:28:51.756]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.896 --> 02:28:58.061]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[02:28:58.341 --> 02:29:06.767]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.027 --> 02:29:14.052]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.352 --> 02:29:19.174]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.394 --> 02:29:24.796]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.136 --> 02:29:28.217]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.537 --> 02:29:36.500]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.951 --> 02:29:47.892]  Next Wednesday night.
[02:29:50.036 --> 02:29:52.761]  What America needs is affordable health insurance.
[02:29:53.647 --> 02:29:56.490]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family.
[02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:58.491]  It's on everybody's mind right now.
[02:29:58.811 --> 02:30:01.494]  If you're self-employed, it's on your mind, too.
[02:30:01.634 --> 02:30:06.638]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[02:30:06.758 --> 02:30:09.841]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.

[02:30:36.063 --> 02:30:37.144]  Not available in all states.
[02:30:50.814 --> 02:30:52.716]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:30:53.196 --> 02:30:56.018]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.003 --> 02:31:02.903]  Alright, welcome back.
[02:31:02.923 --> 02:31:10.549]  We're gonna go straight to Eric and Ron and Wes and Henry and Ron and everybody here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:14.933]  Hadn't had her up though in about a week and I wanted to bring her up here on a big inauguration day.
[02:31:16.051 --> 02:31:24.238]  Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts, high quality, made in America, water purification systems with no moving parts.
[02:31:24.398 --> 02:31:26.920]  Takes about a minute and a half to put them together.
[02:31:27.901 --> 02:31:32.164]  And I think we should just trust the government and keep drinking the tap water, Debbie.
[02:31:32.184 --> 02:31:36.008]  And I think we should take all the new vaccines they want to force on us, too.
[02:31:36.408 --> 02:31:39.911]  And I believe everything the government tells me, so I'm not going to get a big, murky system.
[02:31:41.256 --> 02:31:45.960]  Well, you'll be surprised if you don't get a big berkey how bad your water is going to be.
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:48.742]  You know, I trust my government.
[02:31:48.782 --> 02:31:50.103]  I'm going to take it as an article of faith.
[02:31:50.143 --> 02:31:54.186]  It doesn't matter if Austin water now smells like sewer for the last four months.
[02:31:54.866 --> 02:31:56.968]  I'm just going to drink it and believe in Big Brother.
[02:31:58.849 --> 02:32:01.712]  Well... I'm not going to take control of my life, Debbie.
[02:32:02.152 --> 02:32:11.562]  I'm just going to drink the nickel and the cadmium and the lead and the arsenic and the herbicides and the pesticides and the Ritalin and the Prozac that they admit to all the major water supplies.
[02:32:11.902 --> 02:32:13.704]  I'm just going to drink all the dead bacteria.
[02:32:14.164 --> 02:32:21.752]  And you'll be just like most of the people out there who are not... Yeah, I mean, I hear you talk every week on the show and I'm not going to listen to you.
[02:32:21.772 --> 02:32:22.633]  I'm not going to take action.
[02:32:23.365 --> 02:32:27.788]  I'm gonna buy a bottle of water that they admit, in many cases, is even more full of stuff.
[02:32:27.848 --> 02:32:31.030]  I just, I just, on faith, I worship government.
[02:32:32.652 --> 02:32:34.153]  I'm so sorry for you.
[02:32:34.713 --> 02:32:39.196]  And you know, you're even worse.
[02:32:39.356 --> 02:32:40.277]  Debbie, you're even worse.
[02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:40.957]  Why is that?
[02:32:41.438 --> 02:32:43.239]  You've got a product made in America.
[02:32:43.259 --> 02:32:44.140]  Oh, I know.
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:46.041]  Actually made in America.
[02:32:47.042 --> 02:32:48.062]  What's wrong with you?
[02:32:48.082 --> 02:32:51.605]  I don't know, and good health is so hard to get.
[02:32:52.478 --> 02:32:54.160]  What's wrong with Jim Shepard, the owner?
[02:32:55.181 --> 02:32:57.222]  He must have his screw loose somewhere.
[02:32:57.663 --> 02:33:01.827]  You know, it's actually like a treasure find when I do find something made in America.
[02:33:03.288 --> 02:33:04.109]  It's very rare.
[02:33:04.149 --> 02:33:04.969]  Sometimes I'll go, look!
[02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:06.691]  This was made in America!
[02:33:07.592 --> 02:33:08.593]  Can you believe it?
[02:33:09.534 --> 02:33:10.555]  It's unbelievable!
[02:33:10.835 --> 02:33:11.836]  It may be priceless!
[02:33:12.951 --> 02:33:22.840]  Seriously, your systems are the same price, roughly, sometimes less, than Indian knockoffs that are pieces of junk that you buy at sporting goods stores.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:25.242]  Tell us about these gravity filters and how we get them.
[02:33:26.203 --> 02:33:33.028]  Well, our Berkey gravity filters, like you said, they are made in America, and they don't have a whole lot of parts to them.
[02:33:33.409 --> 02:33:37.032]  As you said, they're easy to put together, they're very low maintenance,
[02:33:38.090 --> 02:33:45.735]  And they do purify the water of bacteria, silt, sediment, things like that.
[02:33:45.755 --> 02:33:47.196]  I mean, they're really great.
[02:33:47.557 --> 02:33:59.785]  And you can get them by calling me toll free at 1-888-803-4438 or by going to our website, which is berkeywater.com.
[02:33:59.965 --> 02:34:02.507]  So, B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[02:34:05.103 --> 02:34:26.140]  But one thing I did want to mention, I had a customer recently in the last day or two ask me to talk about this on your show because there are some people who do not realize that if they do have one of those Indian knockoffs or another brand of gravity water filter, they can call me and in most cases
[02:34:26.894 --> 02:34:34.243]  The filters that we have, our Berkey Black Purification Elements, do fit in the system that they now have.
[02:34:34.263 --> 02:34:36.986]  But I think I'll just pay the same price and get a piece of junk.
[02:34:37.827 --> 02:34:40.811]  Well, okay, if you want, but you're better off calling me.
[02:34:40.831 --> 02:34:43.394]  I'm getting our good Berkey Black Purification Elements.
[02:34:43.414 --> 02:34:45.337]  But the way of the world is always right!
[02:34:47.828 --> 02:34:49.309]  Not necessarily.
[02:34:49.749 --> 02:34:56.775]  I love the fact that every cordless phone I've bought that's made in Mexico or China, because you can't find one made in America, breaks within three months.
[02:34:57.156 --> 02:34:59.017]  And you cannot hear on those phones.
[02:34:59.358 --> 02:35:00.319]  Yeah, I mean, nothing works.
[02:35:00.679 --> 02:35:05.763]  I mean, the engineered obsolescence, you know, where the light bulbs break are even quicker now.
[02:35:05.803 --> 02:35:06.464]  I think it's great.
[02:35:06.664 --> 02:35:07.745]  Yeah, me too.
[02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:09.787]  I love just piles of junk everywhere.
[02:35:10.908 --> 02:35:12.369]  You know, I don't think I'll call you, Debbie.
[02:35:12.549 --> 02:35:13.210]  I just, you know...
[02:35:14.518 --> 02:35:14.838]  Okay.
[02:35:15.218 --> 02:35:16.619]  I'll take a vacation, Alex.
[02:35:16.719 --> 02:35:22.381]  I think it's even worse that you guys sponsor, are the biggest sponsors of this radio show and support freedom.
[02:35:24.461 --> 02:35:25.002]  Well, I know.
[02:35:25.062 --> 02:35:26.482]  We better be careful of that.
[02:35:26.542 --> 02:35:29.863]  You know, about a half hour ago, all of my phone lines went dead.
[02:35:30.203 --> 02:35:30.644]  That's right.
[02:35:30.664 --> 02:35:31.324]  They're going to get you.
[02:35:31.664 --> 02:35:32.944]  I'm not sure!
[02:35:33.244 --> 02:35:35.585]  You've got to be serious, folks.
[02:35:36.365 --> 02:35:38.106]  That's another fun thing.
[02:35:38.646 --> 02:35:40.807]  But seriously, give Debbie a call.
[02:35:41.827 --> 02:35:45.049]  Order the Big Berkey, Black Berkey Elements, new and improved.
[02:35:45.189 --> 02:35:46.690]  Without the lights, $199.
[02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:47.530]  Get one free gift.
[02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:51.653]  They've got videos, awesome stuff, potassium iodate, sports bottle filters.
[02:35:52.613 --> 02:35:57.876]  Get it with the LED lights that burn for 14 years with a rechargeable battery system that goes up at the top of it.
[02:35:57.896 --> 02:36:01.898]  It's kind of a little life buoy system for $259.
[02:36:01.938 --> 02:36:02.839]  You get two free gifts.
[02:36:03.099 --> 02:36:05.420]  They've got a bunch of other items and products and specials.
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:06.441]  Just give Debbie a call.
[02:36:06.821 --> 02:36:09.763]  Tell her that Alex Jones sent you so you can take advantage of these specials.
[02:36:10.824 --> 02:36:11.525]  Call toll free!
[02:36:11.545 --> 02:36:11.646]  1-888-803-4438-883-4438
[02:36:19.602 --> 02:36:25.405]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and in the comment section tell them it's the Alex Jones special and what free gifts you want.
[02:36:25.705 --> 02:36:27.246]  You can look at the free gifts there on the site.
[02:36:27.546 --> 02:36:28.927]  These are good free gifts.
[02:36:28.947 --> 02:36:31.088]  You know, like $30 items.
[02:36:31.108 --> 02:36:36.651]  1-888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:36:36.971 --> 02:36:38.232]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:36:38.452 --> 02:36:44.695]  Thank you, and I'll try and use my Texas accent so they'll know that they're outsourced to other countries.
[02:36:45.976 --> 02:36:47.037]  The Great State of Texas.
[02:36:47.057 --> 02:36:49.077]  Yeah, they teach the people in Indy when you call to go, Hi!
[02:36:49.097 --> 02:36:50.558]  How about them Dodgers?
[02:36:50.818 --> 02:36:52.439]  And they only know like ten sentences.
[02:36:52.599 --> 02:36:53.319]  This has been on the news.
[02:36:53.339 --> 02:36:55.880]  And then finally, you go, let me talk to your manager.
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:57.721]  Or, well, I've got this problem.
[02:36:58.181 --> 02:37:05.144]  Suddenly... That's right, folks.
[02:37:05.164 --> 02:37:05.465]  888-803-4438.
[02:37:06.625 --> 02:37:09.927]  And when you call, leave your name and number and they're busy and they'll call you right back.
[02:37:10.267 --> 02:37:11.167]  Thanks for coming on, Debbie.
[02:37:11.327 --> 02:37:12.048]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:37:12.148 --> 02:37:12.548]  Bye-bye.
[02:37:12.648 --> 02:37:12.968]  You bet.
[02:37:14.604 --> 02:37:21.549]  Look, seriously, they're the best gravity filters out there, and they're made in America, and it supports this show, so do what you want.
[02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:25.592]  Folks, you're used to the bad taste of your water.
[02:37:26.953 --> 02:37:27.293]  Alright?
[02:37:27.873 --> 02:37:29.855]  I drink tap water now, I am amazed by it.
[02:37:30.735 --> 02:37:32.036]  It is disgusting!
[02:37:35.418 --> 02:37:35.919]  Oh, boy.
[02:37:36.799 --> 02:37:38.020]  Let's just take action.
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:40.702]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls quickly now, because I've got some news I want to hit.
[02:37:41.409 --> 02:37:43.670]  Let us now talk to Eric in Illinois.
[02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:44.430]  Welcome, sir.
[02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:45.591]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:37:45.671 --> 02:37:45.951]  Good.
[02:37:46.471 --> 02:37:48.111]  All right, I've got a couple things for you here.
[02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:49.432]  It's kind of sad.
[02:37:49.472 --> 02:37:50.712]  I'm a junior in high school.
[02:37:50.752 --> 02:37:56.634]  I mean, and like, all the teachers and stuff are like, like, just pretty much just saying what the government's been telling us, you know?
[02:37:57.075 --> 02:37:59.996]  You have to give up your rights for freedom and all that fun stuff.
[02:38:00.796 --> 02:38:01.676]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:38:01.716 --> 02:38:05.077]  I mean, because a lot of people don't realize it, but... Give up your rights for freedom!
[02:38:05.117 --> 02:38:06.378]  That's an oxymoron!
[02:38:06.914 --> 02:38:11.758]  Yeah, me and a bunch of my friends have been going around, you know, telling about your site and a bunch of other people.
[02:38:11.798 --> 02:38:12.498]  Nah, good!
[02:38:13.239 --> 02:38:17.762]  And I mean, a lot of people that we've talked to have woken up, you know, and realized what's going on.
[02:38:17.802 --> 02:38:21.225]  A lot of people actually do listen to what we're saying.
[02:38:21.245 --> 02:38:25.067]  Well, see, and you know, it's instinctive in young people to become rebellious.
[02:38:25.468 --> 02:38:32.293]  That's genetically engineered into us by God, so we leave the hut, leave the nest, go set up our own operation.
[02:38:32.733 --> 02:38:36.456]  But the government's very good at taking that natural independence
[02:38:36.816 --> 02:38:39.718]  And putting it into false, destructive rebellion.
[02:38:40.039 --> 02:38:47.224]  Oh, go do drugs, that's cool, and the government ships them in for you, and has the Hollywood crowd promote it like it's cool, and counter-culture, and rebellious.
[02:38:47.344 --> 02:38:49.146]  Or, you know, be a mindless idiot.
[02:38:49.206 --> 02:38:55.531]  No, to truly be revolutionary, and to be rebellious against evil, which is a good form of rebellion,
[02:38:58.271 --> 02:39:00.292]  Young people are waking up everywhere.
[02:39:00.372 --> 02:39:01.413]  It is so exciting.
[02:39:01.473 --> 02:39:03.014]  It spreads like wildfire.
[02:39:03.314 --> 02:39:04.655]  We're winning!
[02:39:05.215 --> 02:39:06.296]  And this is the M.O.
[02:39:06.376 --> 02:39:17.122]  I get from almost everybody I talk to, Eric, is the young people either are drooling, mindless idiots, playing video games and taking Ritalin all day, or they're awake and know about the New World Order.
[02:39:17.322 --> 02:39:18.522]  Tell me about the awakening.
[02:39:20.203 --> 02:39:23.125]  I've listened to your show for the past six months.
[02:39:23.225 --> 02:39:24.706]  One of my friends told me about it.
[02:39:25.698 --> 02:39:33.484]  And I mean, at first I was kind of like, yeah, I don't know about some of that stuff, but I mean, everything that you say on your show, on your internet site, I mean, it's mainstream news.
[02:39:33.524 --> 02:39:35.145]  You back everything you say up.
[02:39:35.205 --> 02:39:38.948]  It's just not some, like, left-wing, right-wing, wacko thing out there.
[02:39:38.988 --> 02:39:40.369]  I mean, it's all backed up.
[02:39:40.529 --> 02:39:42.451]  I mean, you can't argue with the facts.
[02:39:43.191 --> 02:39:44.632]  Yeah, we don't just post mainstream news.
[02:39:44.672 --> 02:39:46.654]  We post alternative news as well.
[02:39:46.954 --> 02:39:51.457]  Alternative analysis linked to government admissions, but we also post
[02:39:53.149 --> 02:39:54.971]  And this is what's important, different about us.
[02:39:55.191 --> 02:39:56.772]  Industry publications.
[02:39:56.832 --> 02:39:58.013]  That's where they tell the truth.
[02:39:58.394 --> 02:39:59.535]  Communicating with each other.
[02:39:59.975 --> 02:40:01.717]  Nobody reads industry publications.
[02:40:01.917 --> 02:40:02.437]  We do.
[02:40:03.118 --> 02:40:04.239]  And legislation.
[02:40:04.879 --> 02:40:07.081]  And then our own reports, our own investigations.
[02:40:07.101 --> 02:40:07.582]  But go ahead.
[02:40:07.902 --> 02:40:08.803]  And we need more people.
[02:40:08.823 --> 02:40:10.384]  I mean, people need to not give up.
[02:40:10.424 --> 02:40:12.846]  You know, spread the word about what's going on.
[02:40:12.866 --> 02:40:14.868]  I mean, that's the way we're going to get this job done.
[02:40:15.308 --> 02:40:16.950]  It'll be just like with Ceausescu.
[02:40:17.651 --> 02:40:17.851]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.891 --> 02:40:27.333]  You know, over in the Eastern Bloc, everybody thought that he was invincible and it was a total police state, and suddenly everybody just started talking, and then one day it's just, nobody likes this guy!
[02:40:28.274 --> 02:40:30.054]  I mean, people seem to not give up and keep talking.
[02:40:30.074 --> 02:40:32.034]  I mean, it's scary how close it really is.
[02:40:32.094 --> 02:40:42.357]  Yesterday, uh, last week I was listening to my scanner, and I heard military doing, like, aberration drills down south here, about around, I think around Ottawa.
[02:40:43.492 --> 02:40:44.813]  They're on handhelds or whatever.
[02:40:44.833 --> 02:40:48.536]  I mean, bags like storming buildings, coughing people, and putting them on the buses.
[02:40:49.417 --> 02:40:51.738]  I mean, it's scary how close this stuff really is.
[02:40:51.758 --> 02:40:55.041]  So you tuned in and heard them doing a mass roundup drill?
[02:40:55.321 --> 02:40:55.521]  Yeah.
[02:40:55.841 --> 02:40:56.662]  Because I've been to these.
[02:40:56.722 --> 02:40:59.544]  I've been to probably, I don't know, six or seven of these.
[02:41:00.447 --> 02:41:02.729]  And uh, it's been in the news, yeah.
[02:41:02.769 --> 02:41:06.852]  So you're actually listening on the scanner and hear them doing roundup drills.
[02:41:06.892 --> 02:41:07.752]  Describe it for us.
[02:41:08.293 --> 02:41:12.155]  I mean, they're just, sound like they're storming through rooms, clearing rooms, practicing.
[02:41:12.235 --> 02:41:17.199]  I mean, I think they actually had like, people there, they were coughing and putting on the bosses and stuff like that.
[02:41:17.779 --> 02:41:21.982]  So you can hear them like, bursting into a room yelling, cough em, cough em, take em out of here, take em out of here.
[02:41:22.699 --> 02:41:23.739]  I mean, it's just kind of scary.
[02:41:23.799 --> 02:41:25.280]  I mean, that really woke me up.
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:30.362]  I mean... And by the way, I got video from before 9-11 where the Marine officer says, this is for America.
[02:41:30.922 --> 02:41:31.703]  The role players.
[02:41:31.763 --> 02:41:34.504]  I'M AN AMERICAN AND WE HAVE RIGHTS TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY!
[02:41:34.904 --> 02:41:35.444]  SHUT UP!
[02:41:37.205 --> 02:41:39.066]  Resistance will not be tolerated!
[02:41:39.146 --> 02:41:41.087]  The women go in this area of the camp!
[02:41:41.347 --> 02:41:44.788]  The men go here and your children will be separated from you!
[02:41:45.188 --> 02:41:45.868]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:45.989 --> 02:41:46.189]  Yeah.
[02:41:46.989 --> 02:41:47.529]  It's freedom.
[02:41:47.949 --> 02:41:49.470]  But the border stays wide open.
[02:41:50.130 --> 02:41:51.095]  Ron in New York.
[02:41:51.195 --> 02:41:52.120]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:52.642]  Go ahead.
[02:41:53.172 --> 02:41:53.552]  Hi, Alex.
[02:41:53.892 --> 02:41:56.414]  I've watched this procession on television all morning.
[02:41:56.554 --> 02:41:59.795]  It is more of a coronation in that spirit than it is an inauguration.
[02:42:00.315 --> 02:42:07.479]  In all the years that I have seen these inaugurational celebrations, I have never seen such prompting grandeur.
[02:42:08.039 --> 02:42:12.641]  It doesn't look like anything that is consistent with what I've seen in this country in the past.
[02:42:12.701 --> 02:42:19.885]  Yeah, I heard Bertie in this morning going, they used to just have a little ceremony in the back parking lot, but things have changed now forever!
[02:42:20.405 --> 02:42:24.631]  And they were playing this royal music.
[02:42:24.651 --> 02:42:28.757]  They were playing like the Imperial, you know like in the old movies, you see where the jousting is going on?
[02:42:29.217 --> 02:42:32.502]  Alex, it looks more like something, it's a cocktail.
[02:42:33.172 --> 02:42:56.353]  of something you would have seen either in victorian england combined with czarist russia exactly but but but of the third reich on top that's what it looks like but listen listen watching the people walk out of the stands the pomp the arrogance the getting off on it just loving loving the signet of power just worshiping it Alex hold on it gets better
[02:42:56.893 --> 02:43:01.218]  I'm glad there's a few people who can afford the $125 ticket to walk out in the stands.
[02:43:01.278 --> 02:43:06.563]  Now, a Fox News reporter made a comment that, and he played obtuse, and he's faking his ignorance, of course.
[02:43:06.923 --> 02:43:08.985]  He doesn't understand why the stands aren't full.
[02:43:09.025 --> 02:43:09.386]  Simple.
[02:43:09.766 --> 02:43:15.031]  Because they've restrained the right of people to have access to these stands, unless you're one of the chosen few.
[02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:15.692]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[02:43:15.712 --> 02:43:18.775]  We've got stands along the entire route, and then...
[02:43:19.976 --> 02:43:25.480]  Again, this morning I'm watching, up until his speech, no one is protesting because they wouldn't let anyone through the security.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:34.627]  The front of the line, they made them stand there for an hour and a half, then they get through and they're all behind the bleachers for the paid people to stand on a public street.
[02:43:34.927 --> 02:43:35.388]  That's right.
[02:43:35.608 --> 02:43:42.373]  And this is supposed to be a public, a constitutionally recommended process, this inauguration, and it's anything but.
[02:43:42.413 --> 02:43:43.474]  It's to the highest bidder.
[02:43:43.914 --> 02:43:47.317]  And I have to say that I found out more recently, and I guess it fits,
[02:43:47.937 --> 02:43:56.860]  That most of the large contributors, private contributors to this coronation ceremony are basically financial and banking institutions.
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:43:58.200]  They're the biggest contributors.
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:00.121]  Or defense contractors.
[02:44:00.281 --> 02:44:01.741]  This is a real disgrace.
[02:44:01.761 --> 02:44:08.203]  You know, in the midst of Bush's speech, he spoke about slavery and he says that slaves held up the banner for their freedom.
[02:44:08.243 --> 02:44:10.324]  Right at that point, Fox made a little boo-boo.
[02:44:10.904 --> 02:44:14.185]  Some guy in the crowd holds up a banner and he's instantaneously arrested.
[02:44:14.838 --> 02:44:18.021]  We pay cheap, dirty lip service to freedom.
[02:44:18.441 --> 02:44:32.472]  But we have had so many veterans, right where you're at in New York, die with their guts in their hands, fighting the Redcoats and their Dragoons and their Hessians, murdering and killing our families, our ancestors, so we can hold up a sign.
[02:44:32.892 --> 02:44:33.913]  And did you notice?
[02:44:34.093 --> 02:44:37.035]  I have two TVs on in one room, another one on in another area.
[02:44:37.215 --> 02:44:38.276]  I've been walking around watching.
[02:44:38.316 --> 02:44:43.040]  Every time they'd say, God, they would cut to a picture or the face of Bush.
[02:44:43.570 --> 02:44:45.632]  Did you notice that... I did notice that.
[02:44:45.652 --> 02:44:47.053]  They're manipulating religion.
[02:44:47.473 --> 02:44:50.555]  Matter of fact... Every time they said God, they cut to him!
[02:44:50.575 --> 02:44:51.116]  I noticed it.
[02:44:52.231 --> 02:44:54.753]  Religion is being manipulated in this ceremony.
[02:44:54.773 --> 02:44:57.495]  Listen, every other word was God and liberty and freedom.
[02:44:57.835 --> 02:44:59.656]  And none of it squares up to their behavior.
[02:44:59.676 --> 02:45:01.618]  Now, you don't have to go back to the Revolutionary War.
[02:45:01.678 --> 02:45:07.142]  Do you know that the family members of people killed in Iraq were not even allowed to go along the parade route?
[02:45:07.382 --> 02:45:08.002]  No, I know that.
[02:45:08.282 --> 02:45:08.462]  Yeah.
[02:45:08.683 --> 02:45:09.683]  Isn't that something you think?
[02:45:09.723 --> 02:45:10.404]  Listen, listen, listen.
[02:45:10.424 --> 02:45:13.446]  Just four years ago, there were eggs coating the vehicle.
[02:45:15.005 --> 02:45:17.306]  But listen, I haven't been watching since I went on air at 11.
[02:45:17.586 --> 02:45:22.587]  Tell me, up until then they never showed protesters, and I hear now it's still only on C-SPAN.
[02:45:22.768 --> 02:45:23.268]  That's correct.
[02:45:23.428 --> 02:45:28.489]  But so the news now, they don't just not let protesters in, they then don't even show them.
[02:45:28.749 --> 02:45:30.370]  Well not only that, they go further.
[02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:34.871]  They say, or they indicate that, well there's no protest like everybody's in agreement.
[02:45:34.931 --> 02:45:36.392]  We're in harmony on this.
[02:45:36.432 --> 02:45:37.812]  He's such a regular guy.
[02:45:37.832 --> 02:45:38.853]  You know, he's a regular guy.
[02:45:38.873 --> 02:45:39.633]  That's why they love him.
[02:45:39.793 --> 02:45:40.073]  Listen,
[02:45:40.783 --> 02:45:42.185]  It's time it has to be said.
[02:45:42.725 --> 02:45:50.234]  If anybody says, well, I'm a good Republican and I'm behind this, I say that you're either demon-possessed or mentally insane.
[02:45:50.254 --> 02:45:52.116]  This is not Republicanism.
[02:45:52.697 --> 02:45:54.599]  We should stop calling them neocons, please.
[02:45:54.639 --> 02:45:56.261]  The term conservative kind of lends
[02:45:56.921 --> 02:45:57.742]  Some credibility.
[02:45:58.002 --> 02:45:59.163]  Call them what they really are.
[02:45:59.584 --> 02:46:00.504]  Neocomms.
[02:46:00.605 --> 02:46:03.928]  Change the N to an M. They're neocommunists.
[02:46:04.308 --> 02:46:06.890]  These people are not neoconservative, they're neocommunists.
[02:46:06.930 --> 02:46:16.178]  Actually, type the ghost of Trotsky, walks the White House halls, or type in Trotsky Neocomm, you'll get Washington Post, AP, Toronto Times.
[02:46:16.599 --> 02:46:17.400]  Let's call it accurate.
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:19.301]  They were the fourth international.
[02:46:20.262 --> 02:46:20.903]  That's who they were.
[02:46:21.531 --> 02:46:28.053]  And that's exactly what they are right now, and we're being deceived through cheap propaganda because people want to delude themselves.
[02:46:28.093 --> 02:46:29.093]  Hey, have you heard the latest?
[02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:34.415]  Alberto Gonzales announced a big, aggressive move to pass more gun legislation.
[02:46:34.435 --> 02:46:40.717]  That's another thing that... Arlen Specter has announced it, and then Hillary said, I'm for the faith-based initiative.
[02:46:40.737 --> 02:46:41.577]  Take over the churches.
[02:46:41.977 --> 02:46:47.441]  Right, well, that's exactly what they're going to do once they put the churches on the dole, they'll lose any independence they may still retain.
[02:46:47.802 --> 02:46:50.584]  But you're right about Alberto Gonzales, I wanted to bring that up.
[02:46:51.064 --> 02:46:56.568]  You're, you know, apple pie conservatives, and I speak to the audience that still has some faith in this nonsense.
[02:46:57.249 --> 02:46:59.891]  The man is in favor of the assault weapons ban and gun control.
[02:47:00.859 --> 02:47:04.001]  That's what your apple pie conservative attorney general says.
[02:47:04.061 --> 02:47:16.251]  He's now announcing, look, in New York with your governor's help, now they've gotten the liability, they never passed liability protection in the Congress, totally run by Republicans, and now they're going to start shutting down, oh my God, manufacturers!
[02:47:16.451 --> 02:47:17.351]  Thanks for the call!
[02:47:18.813 --> 02:47:19.633]  We're losing!
[02:47:19.653 --> 02:47:20.534]  We're losing!
[02:47:21.014 --> 02:47:24.457]  Because of you, you stupid neocon followers, you idiots!
[02:47:25.778 --> 02:47:25.998]  Alright.
[02:47:26.716 --> 02:47:27.456]  I just love this country.
[02:47:27.476 --> 02:47:29.157]  I'm sorry I love this country, you fools!
[02:47:29.757 --> 02:47:33.619]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to, uh, you just keep celebrating, you idiots!
[02:47:34.179 --> 02:47:35.720]  Western New Mexico, go ahead!
[02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:38.321]  I got a question, Alex, or more of a statement.
[02:47:38.641 --> 02:47:45.484]  Uh, now, uh, under Section 802 of the, uh, Patriot Act, I had identity theft happen to me.
[02:47:45.544 --> 02:47:52.787]  I was contacted this morning by a gentleman who told me that when he was moving his girlfriend, he found a bunch of my information along with several other people.
[02:47:53.516 --> 02:48:00.761]  So, uh, I, him and I, uh, are working together, calling the cops, trying to get the detective down here to take a report.
[02:48:01.561 --> 02:48:11.428]  And, uh, the lady at the fraud division told me that I couldn't make a report, uh, unless I was a victim of a crime, and how did I know that I was a victim?
[02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:19.113]  And I said, well, I checked my bank statements, and, uh, some money was taken out of there, um, within the last few days, purchases I didn't make.
[02:48:19.473 --> 02:48:22.635]  And I said, besides, under Section 802 of the First Patriot Act, any
[02:48:23.565 --> 02:48:27.987]  Uh, violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state is, uh, considered domestic terrorism.
[02:48:28.087 --> 02:48:31.529]  As soon as I said that, she fast-forwarded me right to the detective.
[02:48:31.789 --> 02:48:32.569]  Didn't want to talk to me.
[02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:34.290]  Now, here's the music.
[02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:34.810]  Want me to hold on?
[02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:36.751]  Well, it shows the double-edged sword of this stuff.
[02:48:37.431 --> 02:48:37.631]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.931 --> 02:48:40.292]  Maybe you can get this thief hanging from a yard arm.
[02:48:40.773 --> 02:48:41.373]  We're out of luck.
[02:48:45.954 --> 02:48:47.435]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.635 --> 02:48:50.716]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.856 --> 02:48:54.758]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.798 --> 02:48:59.039]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:03.161]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.241 --> 02:49:05.102]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:08.586]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.646 --> 02:49:13.351]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.511 --> 02:49:16.574]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.734 --> 02:49:19.598]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.098 --> 02:49:26.205]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.725 --> 02:49:30.528]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:48.453 --> 02:51:54.474]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:55.075 --> 02:51:58.076]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.496 --> 02:52:06.238]  We'll get more into the inauguration in the days to come.
[02:52:08.877 --> 02:52:12.920]  There's so much other stuff that's happening as we see the agenda of Bush and he goes out and gives speeches.
[02:52:13.001 --> 02:52:14.222]  I believe the Second Amendment!
[02:52:14.502 --> 02:52:17.404]  And he appoints all these judges and people who like want to ban it.
[02:52:18.625 --> 02:52:19.246]  Oh, man!
[02:52:19.786 --> 02:52:21.648]  Well, I guess I better turn my guns in!
[02:52:21.708 --> 02:52:24.530]  I'm a good Republican!
[02:52:24.570 --> 02:52:27.212]  You're a liberal because you're for guns!
[02:52:27.533 --> 02:52:28.614]  You people are sick!
[02:52:29.394 --> 02:52:31.636]  But Wes, just in 30 seconds, finish up your story.
[02:52:31.656 --> 02:52:36.100]  My question to you is why are they so quick to defend the criminal in these cases rather than the victim?
[02:52:37.589 --> 02:52:47.813]  It's just easier for them to pay it off, and they've made the system with all these ID cards, so there's identity theft, so that they can then push this national ID card.
[02:52:47.833 --> 02:52:51.895]  So what happened when you talked to the detective?
[02:52:53.055 --> 02:53:00.978]  Well, I finally got a nice old retired detective to actually take a report, and he's actually sending somebody out later today to collect the information this gentleman has.
[02:53:00.998 --> 02:53:05.460]  It took a retired cop, who actually doesn't really work for the police department, to call me back.
[02:53:07.012 --> 02:53:07.513]  Interesting.
[02:53:07.533 --> 02:53:08.253]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:08.874 --> 02:53:11.616]  See, they don't enforce the laws on the real criminals.
[02:53:11.696 --> 02:53:12.817]  It's all for us.
[02:53:14.078 --> 02:53:15.339]  It's all for us.
[02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:18.561]  Let's talk to Harvey in Florida.
[02:53:18.582 --> 02:53:19.402]  Harvey, go ahead.
[02:53:20.063 --> 02:53:22.365]  It's an honor to speak to you again, Alex.
[02:53:22.645 --> 02:53:23.606]  Honor to talk to you.
[02:53:24.366 --> 02:53:27.349]  You're really terrific today and quite a few days lately.
[02:53:27.369 --> 02:53:32.633]  This is probably the most sickening and saddest day in American history.
[02:53:33.362 --> 02:53:33.682]  That's it.
[02:53:33.802 --> 02:53:34.763]  That's really it.
[02:53:35.023 --> 02:53:36.844]  But Bush talked a lot about freedom.
[02:53:37.364 --> 02:53:45.849]  Well, you know, they're exhibiting the biggest case of political paranoia that has ever been seen on planet Earth.
[02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:47.690]  Well, it's not even political paranoia.
[02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:51.231]  They're just setting the precedent where you don't see the protesters and where they violate your rights.
[02:53:52.072 --> 02:53:56.114]  And where they... Display of weaponry and the display of the military.
[02:53:56.573 --> 02:53:59.235]  I would say they're guilty of political paranoia.
[02:53:59.255 --> 02:54:03.137]  But I mean, in Guatemala and El Salvador and Russia, they have troops on the streets.
[02:54:03.177 --> 02:54:03.737]  Why not here?
[02:54:03.777 --> 02:54:04.297]  It's freedom!
[02:54:05.158 --> 02:54:06.278]  It's like that in China!
[02:54:06.539 --> 02:54:11.041]  Didn't Bill Frist say that's going to be one of the latest crimes, political paranoia?
[02:54:11.181 --> 02:54:13.262]  They could all be put in a mental asylum.
[02:54:14.063 --> 02:54:15.063]  Well, I think that's good.
[02:54:16.024 --> 02:54:19.906]  I mean, this is the biggest display of cowardice that probably the Earth has ever seen.
[02:54:20.771 --> 02:54:23.273]  And the military that's there, and the policemen.
[02:54:23.293 --> 02:54:25.956]  Didn't you know Bush was a fighter ace in World War II?
[02:54:25.976 --> 02:54:28.057]  Now that was dad, Bush Jr.
[02:54:28.398 --> 02:54:29.959]  I've actually heard neocons all year.
[02:54:29.979 --> 02:54:32.541]  Did you ever hear the real story about that daddy Bush?
[02:54:32.742 --> 02:54:35.324]  Yeah, he bailed out and killed the crew, yeah.
[02:54:35.404 --> 02:54:38.246]  And I've even talked to some of the people that were on the ship when he landed.
[02:54:38.266 --> 02:54:44.552]  It was bad what he did, but... Look, the point here is I was being sarcastic about Bush Jr.
[02:54:44.912 --> 02:54:47.655]  I've heard it implied that he was a secret fighter ace.
[02:54:49.948 --> 02:54:50.469]  No, no, no.
[02:54:50.529 --> 02:54:51.849]  He was a combat vet.
[02:54:51.869 --> 02:54:52.350]  You didn't know that?
[02:54:52.390 --> 02:54:53.010]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:53.310 --> 02:54:54.331]  I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[02:54:54.691 --> 02:54:57.052]  I'm sorry to the other Ron in New York and all the other callers.
[02:54:57.092 --> 02:54:57.672]  I apologize.
[02:54:57.932 --> 02:55:00.174]  Call me back tomorrow, Harvey, or call me back on Monday.
[02:55:01.494 --> 02:55:04.916]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, just real briefly here at the end of the broadcast.
[02:55:05.356 --> 02:55:09.038]  I haven't been plugging my videos a lot lately, and they're great films, and it supports what we're doing here.
[02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:11.642]  And we've got some of my best films.

[02:55:17.788 --> 02:55:19.269]  Same thing with 9-11 Road to Tyranny.

[02:55:51.412 --> 02:55:52.572]  We're starting to win the fight.
[02:55:53.632 --> 02:55:59.974]  And the bullies may bluster and puff and puff and threaten to blow the house down, but this house is built of brick.
[02:56:01.041 --> 02:56:03.543]  And if we stand up to the Big Bad Wolf, they're going to lose.

[02:56:19.594 --> 02:56:25.819]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, ensconced with all the pomp and circumstance of Julius Caesar.
[02:56:26.699 --> 02:56:26.879]  Ha!
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:29.021]  People are seeing through it.
[02:56:29.802 --> 02:56:30.889]  We're going to win this war.
[02:56:31.513 --> 02:56:32.137]  God bless you.
