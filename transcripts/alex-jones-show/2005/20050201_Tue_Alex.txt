[00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:06.037]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:07.757]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:09.598]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:11.079]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.339]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:21.703]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.404]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.746]  Here we are, already Tuesday.
[00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.301]  The first day of February, 2005.
[00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:37.122]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.823]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Jude Winensky.
[00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:45.204]  He was a top economic advisor to Ronald Reagan, editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:56.367]  His bio goes on and on, and he's been speaking out against the neocons and the so-called election in Iraq.
[00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:59.808]  So that's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:09.066]  In the meantime, I've got a ton of vital news and information I want to cover, and I want to go to your calls early in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:15.153]  Mikhail Gorbachev has come out and said the election is fake.
[00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:16.915]  This is what they do.
[00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:22.021]  By having a communist like Mikhail Gorbachev come out
[00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:24.877]  And say the thing is a fraud.
[00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:25.817]  Oh, see?
[00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.699]  You're a communist if you think the election is a fraud.
[00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:40.164]  And that makes the UN look good to the liberals and makes the whole European view, kind of led by people like Gorbachev, look like a great thing.
[00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:42.745]  That's internationally.
[00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:45.647]  Domestically, though, it's like, look at those communists.
[00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.948]  They're just, you know, that evil Gorbachev.
[00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.370]  George Bush Sr.
[00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.972]  gave Gorbachev the Presidio military base.
[00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:55.173]  The Gorbachev Foundation.
[00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:56.654]  I've been there, folks.
[00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:57.915]  They run the base.
[00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.517]  Gave him that back in the early 1990s.
[00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:02.218]  He's still there.
[00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.120]  He's a part of this new world order system.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.441]  And they just staged these little fights.
[00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:09.803]  And the new President of Iraq
[00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:16.304]  A inside establishment minion is saying, of course we want the troops to stay!
[00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:18.926]  Of course we want the troops to stay!
[00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.327]  We want you to stay here!
[00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.068]  And then now Bush can say, see, they want us!
[00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.412]  What they've done is, they said the war was about weapons of mass destruction, so they didn't find those.
[00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:36.517]  Now the war, we're seeing history being changed, being rewritten in front of our eyes, the war was about democracy!
[00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.019]  And so, see, we've brought them democracy,
[00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:42.439]  You can trust the voting.
[00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.340]  I mean, they got their food rations when they came and voted.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.742]  You can trust the globalists to run this election.
[00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:50.542]  Everything's fine.
[00:02:50.582 --> 00:02:55.284]  It was secret until the day of the election who the candidates were and some of the polling places.
[00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:56.245]  But you can trust them.
[00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.426]  And now it's about why we've all got egg on our face.
[00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:01.207]  This is what they do before the election.
[00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:02.828]  You'll have egg on your face.
[00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:06.249]  The war will be legitimate if the election goes off without a hitch.
[00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.651]  See, they set the debate and then go, oopsie, we won.
[00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:11.023]  We're right.
[00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:12.704]  Boy, you've got egg on your face.
[00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:14.426]  Bizarre behavior.
[00:03:15.907 --> 00:03:16.968]  But this is what they've done.
[00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:22.012]  And now, oh, see, we're gonna spread democracy in Iran and Syria.
[00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:24.434]  Oh, we're gonna spread it everywhere else.
[00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:29.879]  I thought we were a republic in this country, but I guess the average American doesn't know the difference.
[00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.301]  A big summary came out yesterday.
[00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:34.663]  Teens lack constitutional knowledge.
[00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.522]  And a majority of them think that, hey, there's no need to have a First Amendment.
[00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:43.125]  The government should run the information and the news.
[00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:47.368]  Boy, they are learning well in those government training camps.
[00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.892]  In fact, they think freedom is not being able to have a First Amendment.
[00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:56.134]  It's like they think Iraq has just had a real election.
[00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.197]  This is wonderful.
[00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:01.398]  This is very, very nice.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.361]  We'll go over this USA Today article.
[00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:05.901]  U.S.
[00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.822]  students say press freedoms go too far!
[00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:15.844]  Plus, we'll talk about really important stuff like Michael Jackson and Hillary Clinton collapsing.
[00:04:15.924 --> 00:04:17.244]  I'm just joking, folks.
[00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:21.126]  Guantanamo tribunals, unconstitutional federal judges.
[00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:28.648]  But Alberto Gonzalez says we're just going to ignore what the federal court says because we are the law.
[00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:32.594]  Ridge backs national standards for I.D.
[00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:32.974]  cards.
[00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:36.495]  He's left office, but he's still out there pushing for it.
[00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:37.635]  We already have a national I.D.
[00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:38.015]  card now.
[00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:39.696]  Now they want an international card.
[00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:40.736]  Called for that two weeks ago.
[00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:43.797]  And yet more national I.D.
[00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:45.177]  card legislation has been introduced.
[00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:48.378]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to detail it today.
[00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:50.799]  There's just so much coming up.
[00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.240]  You don't want to miss the next two hours, 55 minutes.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.621]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:57.621]  Keep it locked in.
[00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:05.301]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.907]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:14.452]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.492 --> 00:05:15.834]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:21.844]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:28.828]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:31.009]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:41.714]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:42.474]  If you want to
[00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:43.235]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:44.937]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:10.342]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:21.826]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:27.869]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:34.775]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:41.801]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:43.843]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:46.165]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:48.087]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:48.928]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.948 --> 00:06:49.128]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.694 --> 00:07:02.277]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:06.379]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:07.499]  Read the labels.
[00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:12.041]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:16.463]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:21.706]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:25.649]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:31.213]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.215]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:35.416]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:46.444]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:07:46.804 --> 00:07:48.226]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:48.466]  That's 800-340-7091.
[00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:49.648]  Or visit Cal-BenPureSoap.com.
[00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:50.008]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.882]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:09.724]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:11.205]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:13.467]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:17.230]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:21.794]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.978 --> 00:08:29.860]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:31.081]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:32.303]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:32.343 --> 00:08:33.964]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:37.628]  And, of course, back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:47.058]  Jude Winensky, again, one of the top economic advisors in the Reagan administration, editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:48.909 --> 00:09:11.676]  expert on geopolitical economic systems will be joining us to talk about the neocons in the staged election over in Iraq and much much more and I guess because he's against total war and total propaganda you'd call him a liberal because he was one of the most conservative members of the Reagan administration.
[00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:12.296]  I understand.
[00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:16.077]  I'm pro-gun, pro-border, pro-sovereignty
[00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.553]  Pro-family, I'm a communist.
[00:09:18.673 --> 00:09:19.153]  I understand.
[00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:25.335]  You're anti-gun, anti-family, anti-border, pro-global war, you are a conservative.
[00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:27.876]  I just... I understand!
[00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:35.519]  You're for putting all these judges in that are anti-gun, and anti-constitution, and pro-abortion, and you're a conservative.
[00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.859]  I'm against it, I'm a liberal.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.861]  And I guess so is... so is Jude.
[00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:45.503]  So, that's coming up here in about 22 minutes.
[00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:48.636]  I know we got loaded phone lines already.
[00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:50.557]  A bunch of news coming up.
[00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:51.457]  Again, summary.
[00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:53.958]  Teens lack constitutional knowledge.
[00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:54.658]  New big study.
[00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:55.178]  U.S.
[00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:57.279]  students say press freedoms go too far.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.900]  Half the students say just get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.881]  It is evil.
[00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:02.041]  Very bad.
[00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:03.422]  Very, very bad.
[00:10:03.482 --> 00:10:07.303]  The public schools have done... Look, education is not failing.
[00:10:07.664 --> 00:10:11.785]  It's doing exactly what the New World Order's education documents say.
[00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:13.206]  Even going back to the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:29.255]  I mean, we've got the documents right up until modern times, current times, and it is a plan to teach them how to not think, how to be mindless jellyfish, and to dumb them down, and you wonder why they throw more money at education as the test scores drop?
[00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:33.638]  Because they're getting the money that they deserve for doing a fabulous job.
[00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:40.502]  Given the story, the drug war, you wonder why the drug war, the funding roughly doubles every seven years,
[00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:45.439]  In the last 10 years, we've gone from 1.3 million in prisons to over 7 million now.
[00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:49.641]  And there's triple the heroin, double the cocaine, and more giant prisons being built everywhere.
[00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:55.824]  The drug war is a total, I'm serious, massive success from the point of view of the globalists.
[00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:57.305]  They deal the drugs.
[00:10:57.405 --> 00:11:00.187]  When your kids are dumb enough to use them, they put them in their little FEMA centers.
[00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:02.568]  They build wedges for 20 cents an hour.
[00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:06.250]  The dumbed-down public goes good, make them criminals work.
[00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.052]  And then the public's competing against 20 cents an hour jobs, and we're losing everything.
[00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:17.209]  Not even the illegal aliens can compete against the four million slave laborers now in the prisons.
[00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:20.630]  Four of the seven million building widgets as we speak.
[00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.231]  So it's all part of freedom and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:26.031]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:30.533]  I want to get more into CIA refusal to release Nazi papers about our government protecting Nazis.
[00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:35.574]  But I barely got into these two articles yesterday and I want to cover these first, then go to your calls.
[00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:41.176]  This was out of KTVU-TV, out of Delta, Ohio.
[00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:44.450]  And again, I see one of these articles every two weeks or so.
[00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.591]  From Houston or California or New York, wherever.
[00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:52.032]  Different cities and states are doing it.
[00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:52.532]  It's all over.
[00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.114]  No homework, students end up in court.
[00:11:57.934 --> 00:12:06.737]  And it says some Northeast Ohio middle school students who don't do their homework could find themselves in front of a judge
[00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:17.912]  School officials in Pike Delta District have enacted a new homework policy that they say is aimed at a small group of students who routinely miss assignments.
[00:12:18.152 --> 00:12:19.652]  It's always a small group.
[00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:21.613]  We're going to jail just a small group.
[00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:22.453]  It's not for your kids.
[00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:23.554]  Don't worry, it's reasonable.
[00:12:24.314 --> 00:12:28.335]  A student who eventually fails to turn in homework can be suspended for three days.
[00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:36.195]  And then it says, once they have been suspended, that is considered truancy, even though they suspend you, and then you're criminally charged.
[00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:47.722]  Principal Dennis Ford said a second event could lead to the student being declared unruly for disobedience in juvenile court, which carries the possibility of probation and drug testing and everything else.
[00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:49.103]  Then you'll be thrown into the prison.
[00:12:49.656 --> 00:12:55.339]  And then you'll learn how to be gang raped and learn how to snort cocaine and take PCP.
[00:12:55.799 --> 00:13:01.983]  Ford said the school has tried a number of ways to convince students that homework is important, but none has worked.
[00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:04.244]  Oh, of course, none of it's worked.
[00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:05.705]  You try it so hard.
[00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:09.262]  No, the education system got control.
[00:13:09.783 --> 00:13:12.044]  Now our country's turning into a bunch of animals.
[00:13:12.565 --> 00:13:14.606]  Mindless, gibbering fools everywhere.
[00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:15.426]  Literally.
[00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:30.637]  Some of these children, some of these 15, 16, 17 year olds literally know absolutely nothing about the country, but they know how to gibber and gang speak and how to act cool and how to call their girlfriends bitches.
[00:13:31.537 --> 00:13:33.078]  But that's really about it.
[00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:37.021]  Foaming at the mouth and gibbering and playing violent video games.
[00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:44.142]  In saying, let's ban the First Amendment and basically, I'm not joking here, that's basically all they can do now.
[00:13:44.722 --> 00:13:45.843]  I'd say about half the students.
[00:13:47.603 --> 00:13:49.443]  Seriously, I mean, this is what it's turned into.
[00:13:50.183 --> 00:14:00.325]  I mean, it's terrifying to go into a restaurant or something at lunch, when school's out and kids are eating lunch, and I mean, it's like a menagerie or something.
[00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:04.626]  You see the twelve-year-old girls dressed like prostitutes and
[00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:14.255]  The young men, even from nice families, walking around with their pants hanging down, almost, you know, at their knees, throwing gang signs.
[00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:24.622]  And Globalist has done an absolutely fabulous job, but here in Austin, if you're late to class three times, that is considered a truancy.
[00:14:25.503 --> 00:14:33.008]  And then they criminally charge you, which is a crime, because in Texas, it's 14 unexcused absences, is a criminal truancy.
[00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.051]  But they don't even care.
[00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:38.513]  They call the child before a judge at the portable buildings.
[00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:39.333]  We have this from the news.
[00:14:39.353 --> 00:14:40.014]  They're very proud of it.
[00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:41.474]  They even show the proceedings on the news.
[00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:44.916]  And the judge screams at them and tells the parents, sign these documents.
[00:14:45.197 --> 00:14:46.697]  Parents don't know the proceedings of court.
[00:14:46.717 --> 00:14:48.679]  They're almost as dumb as their children.
[00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:54.142]  And they sign the form and the judge then gets arrogant and yells, now you're going to be drug tested.
[00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:55.323]  Have you one thing wrong?
[00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:56.283]  You're going to juvenile.
[00:14:57.744 --> 00:14:59.325]  You're going to the juvenile center.
[00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:06.882]  And, uh, so it's all about getting them into the criminal system, and we've got articles from all over the country where the parents are being criminally charged.
[00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:10.724]  And, uh, it's if you don't do your homework twice.
[00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.505]  Uh, you're criminally charged, the parents are.
[00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:15.826]  But again, these aren't even really laws.
[00:15:15.886 --> 00:15:20.488]  They just call parents in and say, sign here for referred to judification.
[00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:23.470]  It's all sleight of hand, color of law.
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:32.578]  Once they're under referred to judification, then if they do anything wrong, then they go on probation, and your child's in the system, and you think you're helping your child.
[00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:36.782]  So, this is the new wondrous system, criminalizing everything.
[00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:42.447]  And then, of course, a few weeks ago, they reported they're in Sacramento and other areas of California.
[00:15:42.828 --> 00:15:44.009]  They're calling in top
[00:15:45.388 --> 00:16:11.916]  career day experts uh... who teach the young girls you can make two hundred thousand dollars a year as a psychic or as a topless dancer the ones that make that are really prostitutes folks in most cases and uh... when it came out they didn't even deny it and said yeah we're going to go ahead and teach it you see just two years ago if they would have been caught doing something like this they would have gotten in trouble now they just say yes that's the way it is
[00:16:12.495 --> 00:16:13.756]  Well, here's the London Telegraph.
[00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:18.559]  If you don't take a job as a prostitute, we can stop your benefits.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:30.527]  A 25-year-old waitress who turned down a job providing sexual services at a brothel in Berlin faces possible cuts to her unemployment benefits under laws introduced this year.
[00:16:31.187 --> 00:16:41.254]  Prostitution was legalized in Germany just over two years ago, and brothel owners who must pay a tax and employ health insurance were granted access to official databases of job seekers.
[00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:49.334]  The waitress, an unemployed information technology professional, had said that she was willing to work in a bar at night or had worked in a cafe.
[00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:56.462]  She received a letter from the job center telling her that an employer was interested in her for a profile that she should ring them.
[00:16:56.962 --> 00:16:57.223]  Only
[00:16:58.112 --> 00:17:03.778]  On doing so, did the woman, who has not been identified for legal reasons, realize that she was calling a brothel.
[00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:14.328]  Under Germany's welfare reforms, any woman under age 55, who is out of work for more than a year, can be forced to take any available job, including in the sex industry, or lose her unemployment benefits.
[00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:19.913]  Last month, German unemployment rose to 11th, a consecutive month of 4.5 million.
[00:17:21.175 --> 00:17:23.317]  Folks, I could talk for hours about this.
[00:17:24.935 --> 00:17:28.138]  They are openly normalizing the sex industry.
[00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:35.043]  And the UN's been caught kidnapping hundreds of thousands of women and children with DynCorp and others.
[00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:35.984]  This is mainstream news.
[00:17:36.324 --> 00:17:37.104]  This is what they do.
[00:17:37.345 --> 00:17:42.549]  Now imagine, this is the new liberalism of the super-progressive Germany.
[00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.851]  Okay, where you criticize the government, you're arrested.
[00:17:46.252 --> 00:17:47.473]  You have national ID cards.
[00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:49.274]  Imagine
[00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:54.709]  You're a young woman, college graduate, can't get a technology job.
[00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:57.052]  You go get unemployment, you say, I'll take a job as a waitress.
[00:17:57.392 --> 00:18:02.678]  They go, sorry, you've got to take a job at a brothel or we're going to take your unemployment away.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.542]  You've got to go have sex with ten men a day.
[00:18:07.243 --> 00:18:11.728]  A job that would very easily give you all sorts of different diseases.
[00:18:12.734 --> 00:18:14.715]  Chlamydia goes right around the condom.
[00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.176]  So does hepatitis.
[00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:17.277]  All of it.
[00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:18.318]  But period!
[00:18:18.778 --> 00:18:22.220]  Imagine making a woman go be a whore.
[00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.001]  Well, it's legal.
[00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.222]  Well, it's the job.
[00:18:25.282 --> 00:18:26.023]  You can take it.
[00:18:28.204 --> 00:18:31.166]  And, uh, yeah, oh, make your young men become prostitutes.
[00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:32.487]  You know, whatever.
[00:18:33.347 --> 00:18:34.428]  This is the new freedom.
[00:18:35.327 --> 00:18:37.528]  This is what government does once it's got you in your clutches.
[00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:43.472]  And our entire economy is going to shift into entertainment, into prostitution, into all of this.
[00:18:44.112 --> 00:18:59.042]  I mean, already, in America, there are just hundreds of thousands of really good-looking, smart young women who get into topless dancing, most of them get into drugs, they turn out being prostitutes, basically, and it's a tragedy.
[00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:01.383]  But this is the new liberal society.
[00:19:01.403 --> 00:19:02.824]  This is what we have to offer our women.
[00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:05.692]  This is what we have to give them.
[00:19:06.473 --> 00:19:08.893]  And it's even worse for men.
[00:19:08.913 --> 00:19:11.194]  65% of college graduates now are women.
[00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:14.415]  Men have been totally left behind.
[00:19:15.035 --> 00:19:22.237]  And it's just up to men, whether you're Hispanic or black or white, to now go compete against all the illegal aliens or the prisoners in the prisons.
[00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:27.043]  I know people with two college degrees who want to work hard.
[00:19:27.063 --> 00:19:29.864]  They've got families who lost their computer jobs three, four years ago.
[00:19:30.224 --> 00:19:31.485]  And they've got two, three jobs.
[00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:34.206]  They're working sixteen hours a day.
[00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:39.067]  They're bagging groceries, mowing lawns, doing whatever, just to pay the bills.
[00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:41.388]  That's your new freedom, folks!
[00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:43.829]  This is a wonderful new economy!
[00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:50.912]  Over in Germany, and you watch to come here as well, you want to get your unemployment?
[00:19:51.764 --> 00:19:53.646]  Well, you're not going to get your unemployment.
[00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:54.886]  You need to go be a whore!
[00:19:55.747 --> 00:19:57.969]  Now get in that brothel and service those men!
[00:20:01.926 --> 00:20:08.208]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[00:20:08.428 --> 00:20:13.410]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:26.894]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[00:20:27.114 --> 00:20:30.375]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[00:20:30.635 --> 00:20:32.996]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[00:20:33.196 --> 00:20:37.019]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:40.300]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and Little League alike.
[00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:44.023]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[00:20:44.303 --> 00:20:48.405]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:50.906]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[00:20:51.107 --> 00:20:54.448]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:58.191]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[00:21:01.058 --> 00:21:02.039]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:06.901]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:14.866]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.126 --> 00:21:20.509]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.709 --> 00:21:27.693]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.993 --> 00:21:33.315]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:38.298]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.658 --> 00:21:46.281]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:52.064]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.144 --> 00:21:55.647]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.088 --> 00:21:57.590]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:03.477]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:09.365]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:22:10.254 --> 00:22:17.137]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:18.197 --> 00:22:26.780]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:27.901 --> 00:22:35.844]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:03.116]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:23:03.457 --> 00:23:06.339]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:12.784]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:23:53.965 --> 00:24:09.631]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:13.193]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:19.787]  You see, if there's no moral standard, the government can force you to do whatever it wants.
[00:24:20.407 --> 00:24:21.348]  All of us are criminals.
[00:24:21.368 --> 00:24:22.529]  We're the most petty of things.
[00:24:22.569 --> 00:24:23.610]  Don't finish your homework.
[00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.711]  Whatever.
[00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:25.831]  Late to class.
[00:24:25.871 --> 00:24:26.612]  You go to jail.
[00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:29.134]  Oh, you gotta be a prostitute if you want your welfare.
[00:24:29.654 --> 00:24:30.635]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:31.936]  Danny in New Mexico.
[00:24:31.976 --> 00:24:32.737]  Danny, go ahead.
[00:24:32.757 --> 00:24:34.438]  Yeah, I had a question.
[00:24:34.478 --> 00:24:36.920]  Did you see yesterday's article for the New York Post?
[00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:39.101]  What article was that?
[00:24:39.222 --> 00:24:40.522]  It was talking about
[00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:48.363]  I think with the governor of Baghdad, Ali, I forget his name, talking about erecting a statue of Bush because he symbolizes freedom.
[00:24:49.164 --> 00:24:50.545]  I did hear about that, yes.
[00:24:50.585 --> 00:24:55.749]  I think we should have statues all over Iraq of Bush, just like we had of Saddam.
[00:24:55.769 --> 00:24:56.650]  Big giant pictures.
[00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.892]  California's already doing that with Arnold.
[00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:01.914]  Huge posters with his head on them.
[00:25:01.954 --> 00:25:02.995]  I think that's totally normal.
[00:25:03.015 --> 00:25:08.239]  That's another sign of freedom when there's huge statues of people while they're in office everywhere.
[00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:20.908]  Well, like here in Austin, the judge, Judge Gene Muir, that grabs all the kids and puts them in jail for being late to class and does all this, they named the huge, new, giant Juvenile Justice Center after her while she's in office.
[00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:22.630]  It's totally normal.
[00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:23.951]  It's always a sign of freedom.
[00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:34.239]  It was in Nazi Germany, it was in Stalinist Russia, it was in Babylonia, Babylon, and now it is, of course, in Cuba as well.
[00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:37.181]  Yeah, it's replacing one dictator with another.
[00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:39.951]  Well, I think huge statues are part of freedom, sir.
[00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:43.801]  I think we should have huge statues everywhere and have to salute them to prove we're not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:45.947]  Then we should have huge statues of you!
[00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:50.458]  Well, I think we should not have a First Amendment either.
[00:25:50.658 --> 00:25:53.240]  I agree with the high school students that were surveyed.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.681]  Let's just get rid of freedom altogether, because freedom hurts freedom.
[00:25:55.961 --> 00:26:06.228]  I have a friend of mine who's a school teacher, and she gets the students, seventh and eighth graders, that the school board doesn't want, that are considered undesirables.
[00:26:06.328 --> 00:26:07.929]  Now, these are her words, undesirables.
[00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:11.851]  And she says a lot of these kids cannot write a coherent sentence,
[00:26:12.635 --> 00:26:13.135]  I don't
[00:26:31.736 --> 00:26:33.919]  A proficient and then get confused and don't know.
[00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:39.245]  This is by design to produce a massive, mindless, ignorant population.
[00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:40.146]  They've done a great job.
[00:26:40.486 --> 00:26:46.674]  He tells me that they just talk about how they're going to deal drugs when they're older or they'll ghost trip.
[00:26:46.714 --> 00:26:49.237]  Everything that you've been saying and how they flashed their gang signs.
[00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:50.812]  She's just up in arms.
[00:26:50.832 --> 00:26:53.593]  She vents on me pretty much every day.
[00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:54.734]  Well, it's by design.
[00:26:54.754 --> 00:26:55.994]  We have the official federal plan.
[00:26:56.034 --> 00:27:00.996]  We've had the former head of policy for the Department of Education on with the documents.
[00:27:01.477 --> 00:27:02.177]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:27:02.197 --> 00:27:02.777]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:03.377 --> 00:27:04.298]  I appreciate the call, Danny.
[00:27:04.338 --> 00:27:05.498]  Let's just give our rights up now.
[00:27:06.219 --> 00:27:07.699]  Let's talk to Thomas in Idaho.
[00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.599]  Thomas, go ahead.
[00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:09.780]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.080]  Oh, it's going wonderful.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.401]  We'll hear all part of the new Freedom.
[00:27:12.641 --> 00:27:13.101]  Alright.
[00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:21.725]  I missed your show yesterday, so I don't know if you got a catcher or not, but Sunday night on A&E, they had a movie, a new movie about Arnold, the Lord Arnold, that's soon to come up.
[00:27:22.145 --> 00:27:23.005]  And it was called Lord Arnold.
[00:27:23.065 --> 00:27:25.946]  Oh, the young man he is, and he's part of the American dream.
[00:27:26.026 --> 00:27:30.948]  It was so disgusting, though, because they had, like, maybe at least five mentions of him running for president.
[00:27:31.328 --> 00:27:38.011]  And at the very end of the film, he's there in bed with his wife, and she turns off the light and gives him a kiss goodnight, and they turn her over, and
[00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:40.997]  He turns on his light and pulls out a book and starts reading.
[00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:43.759]  And she wakes up and she's like, Arnold, what are you doing?
[00:27:43.819 --> 00:27:46.160]  And he's like, well, I'm reading the Constitution.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.902]  And she says, I know I can change an amendment in here somewhere.
[00:27:50.122 --> 00:27:52.904]  And they're setting us up so hard for this.
[00:27:52.924 --> 00:27:53.984]  You are so right on it.
[00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:54.865]  I know you are.
[00:27:55.745 --> 00:27:57.266]  You know, I tell everybody about you.
[00:27:57.286 --> 00:28:03.069]  What's wrong with having a guy that says he admires Hitler and wants to be a dictator over and over again?
[00:28:03.109 --> 00:28:03.850]  We're little people.
[00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.351]  He's so disgusting!
[00:28:06.632 --> 00:28:09.115]  This is a sign of freedom!
[00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:12.961]  To have a Germanic leader who doesn't even speak English hardly!
[00:28:13.322 --> 00:28:16.947]  Oh, and also the Pentagon, if you didn't hear, they're making things better with our troops.
[00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:19.611]  They're raising the death benefit, so everything's better now.
[00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:21.614]  So, we don't have to worry about them much more.
[00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:22.979]  Good.
[00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:24.119]  So the family is going to get $100,000.
[00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:24.419]  Yeah.
[00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:27.360]  Thank you so much for everything, Alex.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.500]  Let me ask you another question.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:28.961]  What else?
[00:28:28.981 --> 00:28:29.441]  Well, thank you.
[00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:30.781]  What was on this show, the rest of it?
[00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:35.242]  Oh, it was basically just Arnold, when he was running for Mr. Olympia, etc.
[00:28:35.322 --> 00:28:41.684]  It flashed back and forth between there and the 90 days of the running for governor plus that all happened with.
[00:28:41.784 --> 00:28:43.264]  And that's basically what it was all about.
[00:28:43.866 --> 00:28:46.947]  And his inside team and how sneaky they are.
[00:28:47.007 --> 00:28:48.247]  It was just incredible.
[00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:51.268]  They played it twice on Sunday, so I know that's when it came out.
[00:28:51.348 --> 00:28:52.509]  So they'll be playing it again.
[00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:54.769]  Well, I hope somebody tapes it and sends it to me.
[00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:56.190]  I will tape it the next time it comes on.
[00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.971]  In fact, I'll go find out when I get off the air with you when it comes on next.
[00:28:59.991 --> 00:29:03.612]  And I will definitely tape it for you and send it that way because it just...
[00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:08.154]  You will not believe all the different times they talk about him running for president.
[00:29:08.174 --> 00:29:14.883]  Well, I watched some of the promos of it online and it looks like they take all the bad stuff and make it like a joke and make it fun.
[00:29:14.903 --> 00:29:18.868]  Oh, and it shows him when he's a young boy racing against a brother or a cousin.
[00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:19.849]  I didn't catch the whole film.
[00:29:19.869 --> 00:29:21.271]  It was too disgusting, Alex.
[00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:27.497]  That they're running towards their uncle and their uncle, he looks just like Adolf Hitler, just a little bit longer of a mustache, that's it.
[00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:31.638]  Boy, Arnold's dad was a volunteer for the... It was his dad, I'm sorry.
[00:29:31.658 --> 00:29:38.640]  Yeah, Arnold's dad was a volunteer for the SS when it was illegal in Austria and he had the Hitler mustache.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.860]  He was a Hitler worshipper.
[00:29:41.961 --> 00:29:43.721]  And Arnold learned to worship him as well.
[00:29:44.421 --> 00:29:45.322]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:29:45.942 --> 00:29:47.522]  Sounds like it'd make a great president, huh?
[00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:49.683]  Vote for him or you're anti-Semitic.
[00:29:51.488 --> 00:29:54.510]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:58.212]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:30.866]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:30:31.446 --> 00:30:32.527]  And it's so easy.
[00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:35.328]  To learn, you simply listen.

[00:33:30.851 --> 00:33:39.457]  And he was associate editor at the Wall Street Journal and also an advisor to President Ronald Reagan.
[00:33:40.338 --> 00:33:41.499]  And the bio goes on and on.
[00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:42.840]  Let's come up in a few minutes.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.481]  I heard him this weekend.
[00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:53.678]  On the weekend interview show that another talk show host does with another network, Scott Horton and I was impressed.
[00:33:53.718 --> 00:34:01.303]  I had read about and heard about Mr. Winensky, but I was really impressed by the analysis that he gave on air.
[00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:02.664]  So he's coming up here in a minute or two.
[00:34:03.064 --> 00:34:12.529]  Before we go to Mr. Winensky, I want everybody out there to grab a pen and paper and to cease your procrastination.
[00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.831]  Please get my videos.
[00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:19.174]  I authorize you to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:20.415]  Get them out to people.

[00:35:55.723 --> 00:36:02.926]  And, uh, again, advisor Ronald Reagan, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, uh, political, uh, economist.
[00:36:04.186 --> 00:36:05.527]  And a lot of conservatives.
[00:36:05.547 --> 00:36:19.912]  You know, we've had generals, we've had admirals, we've had the former judge advocate general of the Navy on about how torture's wrong and the neocons are out of control and they're getting our troops killed and the army told them 400,000 troops or it's gonna be a Vietnam.
[00:36:20.393 --> 00:36:23.634]  And this staged election and these obvious puppet installments
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.122]  Aren't fooling anybody.
[00:36:26.162 --> 00:36:29.787]  Maybe they're fooling some people, but it's not fooling those who are really looking at it.
[00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:34.995]  And the media focuses in on people like Gorbachev.
[00:36:35.175 --> 00:36:36.397]  Oh, look at that communist liberal.
[00:36:36.797 --> 00:36:38.680]  He says it's fake, so it must not be fake.
[00:36:39.878 --> 00:36:45.499]  Again, but the media doesn't focus in on people like Jude Winensky and others that are criticizing a lot of this.
[00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:47.939]  Mr. Winensky, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:48.700]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.560]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.420]  You bet.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.101]  Anything for people that don't know who you are that I didn't cover?
[00:36:54.781 --> 00:37:00.082]  Well, you mentioned before we went on, I wrote a book called The Way the World Works.
[00:37:00.582 --> 00:37:04.282]  And it's really the foundation of the Reaganomics and supply-side economics.
[00:37:04.862 --> 00:37:08.023]  And I developed all that when I was at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:08.484 --> 00:37:17.706]  And I was very proud in the year 2000, the editors of the National Review named it one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century, the way the world works.
[00:37:17.726 --> 00:37:22.428]  Of course, I have to point out that I came in 94th, somewhat behind the joy of cooking.
[00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:27.969]  Well, now, and your website is Wymenski.com.
[00:37:27.989 --> 00:37:35.991]  Wymenski.com, and I have a daily commentary, and I've been writing about Iraq a lot lately, and you can register, and it's all for free.
[00:37:36.932 --> 00:37:42.533]  Okay, let's start here with... You talk about your friends, the neocons.
[00:37:42.553 --> 00:37:44.073]  I mean, you know these guys intimately.
[00:37:44.354 --> 00:37:45.174]  Who are they?
[00:37:45.614 --> 00:37:47.574]  Why are you opposing some of their policies?
[00:37:48.394 --> 00:37:53.315]  Well, Richard Perle is kind of the ringleader of the neocons.
[00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:58.536]  The neocons simply means that you used to be a liberal and now you're a conservative.
[00:37:58.596 --> 00:37:59.657]  You're a new conservative.
[00:38:00.117 --> 00:38:03.997]  And I was a liberal Democrat for most of my life.
[00:38:04.057 --> 00:38:04.618]  I'm 68 years old now.
[00:38:07.308 --> 00:38:35.440]  I met Pearl back in 1969 when he was 25 years old and working for Scoop Jackson, the senator from the state of Washington, and George Will, who we all know is now on ABC, and the late Bob Bartley, who was the editor of the Wall Street Journal, and we were all Cold Warriors, and we were united in a very hard line against communism,
[00:38:36.222 --> 00:38:48.672]  in Moscow and in Beijing and fought the Cold War together and we were proud at being successful in fighting that Cold War without having a nuclear exchange.
[00:38:49.413 --> 00:39:01.703]  But when the Cold War ended in roughly early 1990s when the Soviets decided that they had enough of communism, the Russians invited me to Moscow
[00:39:02.253 --> 00:39:08.037]  To try and help them turn their communist system into a market economy.
[00:39:08.758 --> 00:39:10.439]  And I was glad to do that for free.
[00:39:10.559 --> 00:39:12.741]  And I made several trips pro bono.
[00:39:13.662 --> 00:39:19.506]  Because I've never taken any money from a politician or a government in all my years at Polyconomics.
[00:39:19.947 --> 00:39:25.571]  But I broke, I had to break with my old friends because they said, we didn't beat these guys enough.
[00:39:26.191 --> 00:39:27.853]  We have to smash them into the ground.
[00:39:28.473 --> 00:39:30.835]  And we want to feed them bad economic advice.
[00:39:31.337 --> 00:39:34.103]  Shock therapy, so that they will fall apart.
[00:39:34.684 --> 00:39:39.615]  And I said, well, you know, as far as I'm concerned, when they come out with their hands up and they say, we give up.
[00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:45.878]  And we're prepared to be capitalists, and we're prepared to be baptized into the church.
[00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:48.720]  That's enough for me, but it wasn't enough for them.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:56.505]  But the truth is, they wanted those few oligarchs in so that big global corporations could work with them a little bit easier.
[00:39:56.525 --> 00:40:01.408]  Well, you see, warriors have to be able to fight wars, and otherwise they're useless.
[00:40:01.948 --> 00:40:06.131]  So this is really what's behind Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex.
[00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.271]  And that's what the neocons are.
[00:40:08.592 --> 00:40:12.635]  I mean, Dick Cheney, I've known Dick Cheney since he was in his early 30s.
[00:40:12.695 --> 00:40:16.818]  I've known Don Rumsfeld when he was a congressman from Illinois.
[00:40:17.158 --> 00:40:23.483]  These are all people I... Paul Wolfowitz, who's a deputy at the Pentagon.
[00:40:23.683 --> 00:40:25.744]  They're all people I've known all these years.
[00:40:26.044 --> 00:40:28.046]  Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard.
[00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:30.199]  I mean, we were buddies.
[00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:31.220]  We partied together.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:45.528]  Well, I want to go over this, though, because the Washington Post, CNN, big papers in Canada, one headline, what, in the National Mail, the ghost of Trotsky walks the halls of the White House.
[00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:54.974]  You say they're these anti-communists, but didn't the neocons become, you know, founded by Crystal's daddy, you know, out-quote of the failure of the Trotskyites?
[00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:55.674]  Well, yeah.
[00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:56.794]  This is Irving Kristol.
[00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:58.775]  He was my mentor.
[00:40:58.835 --> 00:40:59.695]  I mean, I called him.
[00:40:59.795 --> 00:41:02.056]  I coined the phrase Don Corleone.
[00:41:02.956 --> 00:41:05.116]  Irving Kristol, he's still kicking.
[00:41:05.156 --> 00:41:08.097]  He's now well into his 80s.
[00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:17.299]  And I think Irving himself, Bill Kristol's dad, he's not a neocon in the sense that he really supported all this war.
[00:41:17.419 --> 00:41:19.560]  He was probably
[00:41:20.214 --> 00:41:22.877]  Standing back and saying, look, I'm too old to be involved.
[00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:27.862]  So when did he supposedly switch out of the Fourth International to being this conservative?
[00:41:28.362 --> 00:41:43.477]  Well, this happened after, at the time, at the time of Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers, when you had all kinds of people in the late 1940s who had been thinking in terms of
[00:41:44.894 --> 00:41:47.475]  Some form of communism is being acceptable.
[00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:56.241]  Trotskyism being what they kicked around when they were at CCNY, the old city college in New York.
[00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:57.822]  This is how they came together.
[00:41:58.322 --> 00:42:12.411]  And it was in the late 40s that they began to worry that this is not the way they wanted things to develop in the USSR and gradually shifted out of
[00:42:13.636 --> 00:42:17.178]  Communism, Socialism, and then moved into Capitalism.
[00:42:17.258 --> 00:42:28.767]  I remember there was a time when Irving Kristol came as far as to say, write a book called Two Cheers for Capitalism, and then became a complete Capitalist.
[00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:31.249]  Yeah, Two Cheers.
[00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:33.831]  I went with him for a good part of that.
[00:42:33.972 --> 00:42:37.614]  Two Cheers for crony Capitalism, Command and Control.
[00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:39.416]  See, I go way past all these
[00:42:40.194 --> 00:42:42.716]  Well, there is certainly a lot of corporate capitalism out there.
[00:42:42.756 --> 00:42:44.217]  Have you read this new book about
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.342]  The Confessions of Economic Hitman?
[00:43:08.502 --> 00:43:09.343]  Yes, we've had him on.
[00:43:09.563 --> 00:43:10.663]  You've had him on.
[00:43:10.704 --> 00:43:12.265]  Yeah, well he's in the ballpark.
[00:43:12.305 --> 00:43:19.870]  There's a lot of stuff in the book that I don't quite agree with, but there is big money in the United States.
[00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:29.617]  There is an establishment on Wall Street and they find it in their interest to have crises around the world that they can
[00:43:30.512 --> 00:43:36.717]  That they can deal with through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and make money in the process.
[00:43:37.017 --> 00:43:39.840]  We're talking to Jude Winensky of Winensky.com.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.043]  W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I.com or just go to Infowars.com.
[00:43:44.063 --> 00:43:46.425]  You can link directly through to his website.
[00:43:46.465 --> 00:43:57.133]  He was associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, a political economist, advisor to Ronald Reagan, one of the architects of supply-side economics, a real icon in that movement.
[00:43:57.774 --> 00:43:59.035]  And look,
[00:43:59.927 --> 00:44:10.236]  Shifting gears here, we have the neocons who, with the PNAC documents, want to invade 63 countries.
[00:44:10.256 --> 00:44:11.337]  They've invaded two of them.
[00:44:11.638 --> 00:44:14.040]  They're already beginning to attack Syria with these
[00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.364]  I would agree with that.
[00:44:43.573 --> 00:44:46.034]  Okay, well then what are they up to and what are we facing?
[00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:51.176]  Well, I think they are... Pat Buchanan is a good friend of mine.
[00:44:51.196 --> 00:44:52.136]  I talk to him all the time.
[00:44:52.176 --> 00:44:53.857]  I've known him from the early Nixon years.
[00:44:54.857 --> 00:45:04.641]  You know, he said they've passed their peak, the neocons, and that they've gotten so bloodied in Iraq that they're losing power.
[00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:12.764]  And one of the signs, the sure sign, that they're losing influence is the departure of the number three man at the Pentagon, Douglas Fyfe.
[00:45:13.782 --> 00:45:15.163]  Uh, who's just resigned.
[00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:32.511]  And, uh, at the State Department, although I've written that I think Condoleezza Rice is really incompetent to be Secretary of State, she's competent to do a lot of things because she's very bright, but she has shown no skills in the diplomatic world.
[00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.331]  But she has brought in with her as her deputy, Robert Zoellick, who is the U.S.
[00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:46.814]  Trade Representative, and a man I much admire for his diplomatic skills, and that I think... Let me digress for just a second.
[00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:55.956]  The combination of these factors make me a little bit more hopeful that the Bush administration is going to be pointed in a less aggressive direction.
[00:45:56.016 --> 00:45:57.256]  Let me digress for a second.
[00:45:57.736 --> 00:45:59.697]  Why have we seen such an exodus?
[00:45:59.717 --> 00:46:00.337]  You know, I thought
[00:46:00.837 --> 00:46:06.801]  That it was just people going to cash in on the private sector while they've still got power for four years with their connections.
[00:46:07.221 --> 00:46:10.243]  But then Karl Rove told U.S.
[00:46:10.283 --> 00:46:17.208]  News & World Report that no, they weren't energetic enough, were kicking all these people out, plus they were lightning rods, were putting in a new batch.
[00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:18.769]  What do you think the truth is?
[00:46:19.989 --> 00:46:28.375]  Well, a lot of the people that are leaving are exhausted and they wound up having to
[00:46:29.365 --> 00:46:38.132]  Uh, go along with the party line in the first administration on a lot of things that they didn't approve of, and they're gone.
[00:46:38.272 --> 00:46:43.076]  So there's a shake-up, there's a new team there, and I wish there were
[00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.828]  Yeah, but you say they may be lessening.
[00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:59.512]  I mean, his speech at his coronation last week, or a week and a half ago, when he was on the 20th, I mean, Bush was up there literally talking about a crusade against evil.
[00:46:59.532 --> 00:47:10.256]  I know, but he's been backtracking ever since because of the way... You know, President Bush was chosen by the neocons when he was governor of Texas.
[00:47:10.276 --> 00:47:13.037]  In fact, they picked him
[00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:18.915]  To be the candidate, in fact, that the neocons picked, George W. Bush.
[00:47:19.075 --> 00:47:20.977]  Wasn't it George Shultz that vetted him?
[00:47:21.537 --> 00:47:37.252]  Well, George Shultz, he's part of the gang, and George Shultz is the one who introduced Condoleezza Rice into the National Security Council in the first Bush administration, to Brent Scowcroft, and then brought her back when President Bush
[00:47:37.936 --> 00:47:41.357]  When Governor Bush, they said, hey, look, we want you to run for president.
[00:47:41.557 --> 00:47:46.238]  And he essentially told them that he didn't know anything about foreign policy.
[00:47:46.278 --> 00:47:52.159]  He really knew how to manage the Texas Rangers, a baseball team, but that's as far as it went.
[00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:56.340]  And they said, well, we're going to fix you up with the smartest people around.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.521]  And what they did was they sent him Condoleezza Rice, and she came down to Crawford.
[00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:09.224]  And she was there for a week or so, and then she said, Mr. President, you should meet a man I think who's very bright.
[00:48:09.624 --> 00:48:13.707]  And she brought Paul Wolfowitz down to Crawford, and their pictures were in the paper.
[00:48:13.887 --> 00:48:17.349]  And then a week later, here's a picture of Richard Perle.
[00:48:17.509 --> 00:48:19.050]  And then George Shultz came.
[00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.431]  George Shultz was in there.
[00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:23.012]  He's a member of the Defense Policy Board.
[00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:28.576]  He's right next to Richard Perle in planning all these maneuvers.
[00:48:28.636 --> 00:48:30.397]  And, of course, Don Rumsfeld.
[00:48:31.997 --> 00:48:43.896]  Don Rumsfeld introduced Rumsfeld to the neocons back when he was in the Ford administration and he's never been his own man.
[00:48:43.917 --> 00:48:44.638]  In other words,
[00:48:45.217 --> 00:48:53.283]  It's been Pearl and Wolfowitz who have been doing the strategic thinking behind the Pentagon, and Rumsfeld has been one of their agents.
[00:48:53.383 --> 00:49:03.710]  Mr. Winensky, so is it a real split when Brent Scowcroft and George Herbert Walker kind of send out signals about not being too keen on the war before the war?
[00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:05.892]  Oh, absolutely it was.
[00:49:05.912 --> 00:49:13.898]  I was thinking in the last days before we went to war that because of the positions that were being taken
[00:49:14.339 --> 00:49:15.020]  We're good to go.
[00:49:22.603 --> 00:49:33.249]  Essentially saying to us, and to the Security Council, look, you can come anywhere you want, and as long as you want, and look under my bed, and you're not going to find any weapons of mass destruction.
[00:49:33.289 --> 00:49:35.270]  It was Bill Clinton who pulled the inspectors out.
[00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.091]  They never kicked him out.
[00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:39.373]  And then notice we heard it was all weapons of mass destruction.
[00:49:39.713 --> 00:49:41.374]  Now the war was never about that.
[00:49:41.954 --> 00:49:43.495]  Rumsfeld says that's an urban legend.
[00:49:43.535 --> 00:49:45.556]  He never said it on Face the Nation.
[00:49:45.636 --> 00:49:48.378]  No, it was about bringing democracy.
[00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:53.051]  Well, you know, they've run out of all the other excuses, so now they're down to democracy.
[00:49:53.271 --> 00:50:02.473]  And, of course, the elections that we had, everybody has tears in their eyes about how wonderful it is that all these people stood in line and braved the insurgents.
[00:50:02.913 --> 00:50:04.653]  But, you know, nothing really has changed.
[00:50:05.113 --> 00:50:10.494]  The insurgents don't really care about the turnout, whether it's a big one or a small one.
[00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:11.535]  They are there.
[00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:18.356]  The insurgency is directed at the United States, which has, as far as they're concerned, over the last
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:27.482]  Fifteen years, you know, killed a million and a half Iraqis with the sanctions and with the war, and they want us out of there.
[00:50:27.602 --> 00:50:34.464]  And they're not going to stand for any kind of government that has been shaped and managed by people like Hillary.
[00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:38.485]  By the way, that's roughly one out of twenty Iraqis is dead.
[00:50:40.926 --> 00:50:41.426]  Amazing.
[00:50:41.826 --> 00:50:43.427]  Jude Winensky, please stay with us, sir.
[00:50:43.447 --> 00:50:45.407]  I've got a bunch of other questions for you.
[00:50:45.427 --> 00:50:47.368]  I want to talk about what you think is going to happen in Iraq.
[00:50:48.228 --> 00:50:51.912]  Where do you think this is all going in the next year, the next two years, the next five years?
[00:50:52.473 --> 00:50:54.275]  What's your projection for the future?
[00:50:55.036 --> 00:50:57.739]  And we'll also take calls on Alex Jones.
[00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.300]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:50:59.681]  Check it out.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:08.186]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.487 --> 00:51:09.868]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.048 --> 00:51:12.270]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.492]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.772 --> 00:51:19.717]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.057 --> 00:51:24.101]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:26.103]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.163 --> 00:51:36.831]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.971 --> 00:51:38.873]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.073 --> 00:51:42.956]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[00:52:00.876 --> 00:52:02.497]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.637 --> 00:52:06.719]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.879 --> 00:52:09.760]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:16.544]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.724 --> 00:52:19.745]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.945 --> 00:52:22.346]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.466 --> 00:52:29.750]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements
[00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:30.531]  We're good to go!

[00:54:10.053 --> 00:54:35.634]  I always seem to have more interesting conversations with our guests during the breaks when I'm talking to them, but I was talking to Jude Winensky, who of course is a world-renowned political economist and former associate editor for the Wall Street Journal, also a top economic advisor and economic architect for Ronald Reagan during his first term of his presidency, and advising during the campaign as well.
[00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:41.916]  Mr. Winensky, continuing, during the break we were talking about what the neocons want, this world empire.
[00:54:42.437 --> 00:54:45.678]  But here, domestically, they're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:54:46.038 --> 00:54:49.259]  Alberto Gonzales is claiming that President Bush is above the law.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:56.142]  They are dismantling the Constitution, wholesale, so they promise to spread freedom worldwide.
[00:54:56.162 --> 00:54:58.143]  Well, how about spreading some here at home?
[00:54:59.284 --> 00:55:04.426]  Well, we have an objective as large as the one that they have, and they believe that
[00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:08.423]  That right is on their side, and this is the way to go.
[00:55:08.443 --> 00:55:16.447]  You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
[00:55:16.987 --> 00:55:19.369]  So, whatever you have to do, you do.
[00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:23.751]  And you make excuses for it, and if you have to trample on the Constitution or
[00:55:24.286 --> 00:55:29.711]  Turn it inside out in order to approve the use of torture, the breaking of international conventions.
[00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:31.512]  You find ways to do that, too.
[00:55:31.692 --> 00:55:35.335]  But doesn't it, Mr. Wineski, seem like they're getting delusional?
[00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:41.601]  I saw a quote in the New York Times by a top White House official saying, hey, you guys go ahead and write about our contradictions.
[00:55:42.001 --> 00:55:43.182]  We are the empire.
[00:55:43.302 --> 00:55:47.145]  We actually set reality, and we'll change reality day to day.
[00:55:47.165 --> 00:55:48.947]  I mean, it's getting Twilight Zone.
[00:55:49.207 --> 00:55:52.950]  Well, it is, and people say, are you saying there's a conspiracy?
[00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.812]  And I say, of course there's a conspiracy, and they advertise it.
[00:55:56.132 --> 00:55:57.333]  It's a public conspiracy.
[00:55:57.373 --> 00:56:00.916]  They're saying, here's what we're going to do, and we're going to do it for the good of the world.
[00:56:01.216 --> 00:56:16.248]  Now let me backtrack a little bit, and remember we were talking in the earlier segment about how I was one of these folks, and that when the Cold War ended, one of the arguments that I was making is that, yes, we are an empire.
[00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:18.850]  We are now at the top of the whole political
[00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:45.619]  of pyramid of the power pyramid of the planet earth there's nobody else that so we have a responsibility to manage the world managing not policing it and the management of it means that we have to consult with all the members of the family of nations with all of the people who at in the NATO and at the UN Security Council before we go to war with anyone and I was opposed
[00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:57.834]  With my argument that in terms of peacetime, when you're at peace, you put diplomacy first, because it's less expensive, and you don't really want to have wars all the time.
[00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.595]  And their argument was exactly the opposite.
[00:57:00.635 --> 00:57:03.816]  They say, we have to have an American empire, but we're going to kick ass.
[00:57:04.555 --> 00:57:06.916]  I want to be clear, though.
[00:57:07.276 --> 00:57:09.857]  We, the American people, aren't part of this empire.
[00:57:10.137 --> 00:57:15.479]  There's this supposed reflected glory of people going, yeah, we are an empire now, I'm powerful.
[00:57:15.539 --> 00:57:15.759]  No.
[00:57:16.019 --> 00:57:17.940]  In this empire, we're going to be slaves.
[00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:20.581]  Well, that's true.
[00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:26.604]  And the problem we had in the last election is that I broke with the Republican Party.
[00:57:26.624 --> 00:57:31.305]  I'd been a Republican voter going back to the Republican Party in 1968.
[00:57:33.334 --> 00:57:38.184]  And I voted for John Kerry, not holding my nose because he was a very good candidate, but I had to...
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:43.343]  But cast a vote against these warriors, because I don't like where they're taking us.
[00:57:43.844 --> 00:57:48.427]  And this is why Bush only won by a small amount of votes.
[00:57:48.687 --> 00:57:50.469]  But, I mean, you're a smart guy.
[00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:52.770]  You know, Kerry was like, we need to increase the troops.
[00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:53.971]  We need to... Iran!
[00:57:54.051 --> 00:57:54.952]  Iran's evil!
[00:57:54.992 --> 00:57:55.732]  Let's get them!
[00:57:56.173 --> 00:57:58.474]  And I thought I was listening to George Bush on steroids.
[00:57:59.195 --> 00:58:00.516]  He's terrible.
[00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:04.779]  But what are we going to do for the next four years?
[00:58:05.079 --> 00:58:07.221]  And all I can say is that from
[00:58:07.762 --> 00:58:20.509]  One day to the next, I'm doing everything I can to encourage those forces inside the Bush Administration and inside the Republican Party to move in more moderate directions.
[00:58:21.449 --> 00:58:28.193]  And I'm just believing that that will happen, that we're not going to have, they're not going to go into Iran.
[00:58:28.948 --> 00:58:30.409]  There's a lot of bluster about it.
[00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:38.974]  You know, Cy Hirsch did the whole world a favor by his article in the New Yorker where he pointed out all the plans that we have.
[00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.375]  Well, I'll tell you what, we got a break.
[00:58:40.395 --> 00:58:41.636]  We're going to start the second hour.
[00:58:41.696 --> 00:58:46.159]  I want to get your predictions on what's going to happen in Iraq and take some calls.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:47.780]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.322]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:51.362 --> 00:58:51.863]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:57.807 --> 00:58:58.387]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.091 --> 00:59:00.172]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.852 --> 00:59:01.953]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.613 --> 00:59:03.454]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.194 --> 00:59:06.116]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.136 --> 00:59:09.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.938 --> 00:59:14.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.223 --> 00:59:21.565]  Alright, we have one of the chief architects of supply-side economics on.
[00:59:21.585 --> 00:59:27.169]  Top political economic advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:38.219]  Also, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, and of course, friends with almost all the top neocons, if not all of them, Jude Winensky.
[00:59:38.239 --> 00:59:42.422]  Winensky.com is his economic forecast report and information.
[00:59:43.003 --> 00:59:44.604]  And we have a link to it at Infowars.com.
[00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:54.052]  I know we have Jeff and Chelsea and Roger and Laverne and many others that are patiently holding your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:55.035 --> 01:00:00.240]  I know some stations actually carry the news, so I want to, in the next segment, get into his forecast of what's going to happen in Iraq.
[01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:07.707]  But, Jude, I want to go to some calls here in just a second, sir, but what are some of the other things you want to talk about in the next 30 minutes?
[01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:09.149]  Just kind of a teaser.
[01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:10.430]  I'll leave it up to you.
[01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:11.331]  You're doing fine.
[01:00:11.771 --> 01:00:15.635]  I just want to ask you, please call me Jude instead of Mr. Wineski.
[01:00:17.057 --> 01:00:18.658]  I was named after St.
[01:00:18.678 --> 01:00:20.480]  Jude, the patron saint of hopeless cases.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:28.866]  So I'm a little bit more optimistic than most people on all crises that I see facing the country.
[01:00:29.406 --> 01:00:31.147]  Well, I think we're going to have more terror attacks.
[01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:32.548]  I think we're going to have a national draft.
[01:00:32.608 --> 01:00:34.169]  I think we're going to go to war with the other countries.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.751]  But you don't think that's going to happen?
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:36.191]  No, I don't.
[01:00:36.391 --> 01:00:37.412]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:00:37.432 --> 01:00:45.878]  I think there's a recalculation by the Republican Party and by the President and by Karl Rove
[01:00:47.586 --> 01:00:51.628]  And we can see this in some of the personnel changes that have been made.
[01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:54.770]  So you think they've taken off too big of a bite with Iraq already?
[01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:55.690]  That's right.
[01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:07.957]  And one of the big things that we've seen is that Mohammed al-Baradei is the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is an arm of the United Nations.
[01:01:08.557 --> 01:01:15.841]  And Baradei, the Bush neocons, has spent the last year planning to get rid of him.
[01:01:16.457 --> 01:01:20.761]  And doing everything they can to prevent him from getting a third term.
[01:01:20.921 --> 01:01:27.127]  They don't like him because he's the guy who said before we went to war that we're not going to find any nuclear weapons here.
[01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.108]  They have no weapons.
[01:01:28.148 --> 01:01:29.329]  They have no weapons program.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.011]  So they hate him for that.
[01:01:31.391 --> 01:01:34.194]  And they don't want him around because he's getting in their way.
[01:01:34.847 --> 01:01:43.931]  And we now see that we can't get any other of the 35 countries that vote on the matter to support us.
[01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:48.713]  All of the others are supporting Bradai, and we're going to have to go along with it.
[01:01:48.793 --> 01:01:55.176]  So a lot of what's... Well, even weapons inspectors that were neocons and said, we're going to fine them, said they were wrong.
[01:01:56.411 --> 01:02:03.474]  And we know that Iraq, basically as modern military goes, was in the Stone Age after the bombardments of 1991.
[01:02:03.614 --> 01:02:04.275]  Well, exactly.
[01:02:04.335 --> 01:02:04.775]  That's right.
[01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:07.536]  And we could tell.
[01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:16.720]  Scott Ritter was the chief UN weapons inspector for the UNSCOM inspectors.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.701]  And Ritter, although
[01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:30.349]  Uh, at the end of his term, said there were still some remaining problems, uh, essentially had written books saying they were, the, that Iraq was, uh, disarmed, effectively disarmed, and wasn't a threat to anyone.
[01:02:30.769 --> 01:02:41.259]  And we knew that they couldn't reconstitute any of the weapons programs they had in the 80s, or we would have been able to tell from satellites that they were, because you have to have...
[01:02:41.835 --> 01:02:53.438]  I mean, it's also hypocritical when you've got Pakistan running around handing nuclear weapons components out like lollipops, and we've got North Korea, we've got Rumsfeld on the board of ABB transferring reactors.
[01:02:53.998 --> 01:02:56.039]  I mean, it's totally hypocritical.
[01:02:56.059 --> 01:03:01.180]  We've got China threatening... I'm going to recommend that you get on your program Dr. Gordon Prather.
[01:03:02.094 --> 01:03:02.454]  I think?
[01:03:20.325 --> 01:03:23.567]  Because he worked at Los Alamos.
[01:03:23.847 --> 01:03:27.269]  He was a nuclear weapons designer, a nuclear physicist.
[01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:36.075]  And he assures me that there's no way in the world that Iran, right now, Iran could possibly have a nuclear weapon.
[01:03:36.255 --> 01:03:40.377]  Well, they're saying that even if they did a crash course for four years, it'd take four years.
[01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:46.521]  Yeah, he thinks it would take at least four years, but they would only be able to do that
[01:03:46.981 --> 01:03:50.245]  If they dropped out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty... Gotta break.
[01:03:50.466 --> 01:03:50.906]  Gotta break.
[01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:51.487]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:55.423]  Are you struggling with the hair loss problem?
[01:03:55.484 --> 01:03:56.764]  Then try NewHair.
[01:03:56.904 --> 01:03:57.164]  Why?

[01:04:02.865 --> 01:04:06.006]  Since taking NewHair, um, I noticed darker and less gray hair.

[01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:09.126]  It looks and feels healthier.
[01:04:09.486 --> 01:04:10.967]  I'd strongly recommend NewHair.

[01:05:49.754 --> 01:05:51.836]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:05:52.853 --> 01:05:54.474]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:54.614 --> 01:05:58.737]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:58.857 --> 01:06:01.738]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:06:01.818 --> 01:06:08.542]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:06:08.723 --> 01:06:11.724]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:06:11.925 --> 01:06:14.326]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:06:14.446 --> 01:06:22.331]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:06:22.671 --> 01:06:23.671]  We're good to go.
[01:06:53.015 --> 01:06:58.041]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.422 --> 01:07:00.745]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:09.816]  Alright, we're 8 minutes and 15 seconds into the second segment of this
[01:07:10.752 --> 01:07:11.452]  Second Hour.
[01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:12.432]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:12.472 --> 01:07:14.113]  It is the first day of February 2005.
[01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:31.437]  We're talking to a former associate editor at the Wall Street Journal, one of the architects, a world-renowned political economist, one of the architects of supply-side economics, and a former, of course, Reagan economic advisor, Jude Winensky.
[01:07:31.477 --> 01:07:37.238]  The website, winensky.com, W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I.com, or link through at infowars.com.
[01:07:38.624 --> 01:07:46.186]  And we're going to go to Jeff, Chelsea, Roger, Paul, and many others, and then get into his forecast of what is going to happen in Iraq.
[01:07:46.666 --> 01:07:55.988]  And again, he is friends with all the neocons, but opposed to them, and opposed to the war for global empire, and opposed to the police state being set up in America.
[01:07:56.288 --> 01:07:59.049]  We talked about that in the last hour, so I'm just recapping.
[01:08:00.862 --> 01:08:01.743]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:08:01.763 --> 01:08:03.004]  Where are you calling us from today?
[01:08:03.304 --> 01:08:05.405]  I'm calling from Louisiana, Alex.
[01:08:05.525 --> 01:08:05.825]  Welcome.
[01:08:05.845 --> 01:08:07.547]  You're on the air with Mr. Walensky.
[01:08:07.887 --> 01:08:08.127]  Right.
[01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:12.910]  I'm going to give you two brief comments and then criticize Mr. Walensky on something.
[01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:23.317]  First of all, last night, American Experience, in 1979, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, they told Castro, if you criticize the invasion, we will permit the U.S.
[01:08:23.357 --> 01:08:24.238]  to attack Cuba.
[01:08:24.738 --> 01:08:30.062]  Second, 10-20 on WWL, they talked about the thumb scanning in Portland, Oregon supermarkets.
[01:08:30.672 --> 01:08:32.033]  Now, to Mr. Walensky.
[01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:42.659]  Unfortunately, your position is unfortunately untenable because in the last election you had two other choices to vote for, mainly, either one of the two Michaels, but Narek or Peruzza.
[01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:49.982]  Why didn't you vote for candidates who favor smaller government and would be willing to dismantle this U.S.
[01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:53.204]  oligarchy which is turning us into a communist state?
[01:08:53.945 --> 01:08:58.267]  Well, I considered it, but I decided to go with Gary because it seems that he has
[01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:26.525]  a reasonable chance of uh... of winning and uh... that's about what i'd go to the state republican ticket otherwise but voted for gary at the top and uh... you know the way i mean i don't know that we have a very sad uh... uh... uh... thinking why did i vote for that guy because speaking he was pretty bad well no he was saying i want to widen the war and i don't like the war let's increase troops uh... i mean how is that a difference
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.762]  Well, I've handled the question.
[01:09:32.822 --> 01:09:34.724]  Is there another question, sir?
[01:09:34.744 --> 01:09:37.486]  Thanks for the call, Jeffrey.
[01:09:37.726 --> 01:09:54.440]  Look, I'm not here trying to tear into you about this, but obviously, if you want to talk liberal, conservative, and then really look at evidence, growth rate of government doubling, what it was under Clinton, under Bush, open borders, he's for gun control, signing on to UNESCO and the UN,
[01:09:56.101 --> 01:09:58.563]  Well, it has to do with economic policy making and
[01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:30.054]  I think Bush's economic policymaking in terms of his approach to the macro policies are much better than Terry's would have been, but that's another story.
[01:10:30.074 --> 01:10:41.239]  We'll have to have another program just talking about what's happening with the dollar and the current account deficits and tax rates and so forth and so on, because that's my specialty.
[01:10:41.259 --> 01:10:42.600]  That's what I do for my clients.
[01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:47.004]  Bush three years ago said how great a weak dollar would be.
[01:10:47.064 --> 01:10:49.267]  They could have propped it up, but they haven't propped it up.
[01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.648]  It's been disastrous.
[01:10:50.688 --> 01:10:55.794]  The only way, the problem with the dollar is that the value of the dollar is determined by the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:56.954 --> 01:11:04.500]  Because they have a monopoly control over the supply of dollars, but let's leave that for another time, Alex.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.201]  No, I agree with you.
[01:11:05.221 --> 01:11:05.961]  Let's take some calls.
[01:11:06.602 --> 01:11:08.523]  Chelsea in California.
[01:11:08.543 --> 01:11:09.344]  Chelsea, go ahead.
[01:11:09.684 --> 01:11:13.287]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the size of Iraq.
[01:11:13.887 --> 01:11:19.051]  And when you, you know, people are going, oh, we're invading, we're winning, we're taking over Iraq.
[01:11:19.912 --> 01:11:25.817]  I think in the back of their mind, they rationalize it by Iraq being the size of the United States
[01:11:26.656 --> 01:11:28.316]  The size of California, maybe?
[01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:37.379]  And then, I think it hits home better when you say 1 in 20 of the Iraqis have received death because of the invasion.
[01:11:37.399 --> 01:11:41.140]  And another point I wanted to make was about the borders.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.960]  And, like, I grew up in California.
[01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:46.541]  I was born in 1962.
[01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:53.983]  And it really seems like, uh, just, I don't know, since about the 90s, that it really seems almost like an invasion.
[01:11:55.218 --> 01:12:07.385]  Well, the corporate government wants a third world population, they want lower wages, they want globalism, they want the rapid plunge downward and that's what's happening.
[01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:08.526]  Do you have a question for our guest?
[01:12:08.806 --> 01:12:17.851]  Well, he's very interesting and I did serve under Reagan in Germany on a missile unit and I'd like to hear some comments about why the
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.981]  The uniting of the Americas and what that is all about.
[01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:31.343]  Yeah, the Union of American States through the free trade deals, just like the Euro.
[01:12:31.743 --> 01:12:38.405]  I mean, you watch a C-SPAN meeting of the American leaders and they'll admit it's global government, but on the news you never hear about it.
[01:12:38.725 --> 01:12:39.885]  Any comments, Jude?
[01:12:40.485 --> 01:12:48.788]  Well, again, this is... When I think of California, I think of the big border we have with Mexico and
[01:12:49.386 --> 01:12:55.313]  The influx from Mexico because of Mexico's poor economic policies.
[01:12:55.713 --> 01:12:57.495]  And I've been arguing for 25 years.
[01:12:58.755 --> 01:13:10.021]  That Mexico, if its own oligarchs change the tax and monetary regulatory structure of the economy, they could grow at 10 and 12 percent and they'd rather have it not grow.
[01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:11.281]  But they'd rather have it not grow.
[01:13:11.301 --> 01:13:12.702]  They'd be pulling people back.
[01:13:12.742 --> 01:13:16.063]  Mexican illegals would be coming back to Mexico from California.
[01:13:16.344 --> 01:13:23.427]  But they'd rather have total monopoly control than have their wealth even grow.
[01:13:23.587 --> 01:13:26.168]  That's the fat cats in every country want to do that.
[01:13:26.228 --> 01:13:27.149]  That's where you find
[01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:36.655]  You know, do you realize in Mexico that if you were big enough to get traded on the Mexico Stock Exchange, you don't have to pay a capital gains tax?
[01:13:37.115 --> 01:13:39.756]  But if you're little, you have to pay the capital gains tax!
[01:13:39.836 --> 01:13:40.397]  Hey Alex?
[01:13:41.257 --> 01:13:41.477]  Yes?
[01:13:41.497 --> 01:13:47.261]  I don't mean to interrupt you guys, but I just, um, I had a discussion on a blog with a fellow who was saying that
[01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:54.271]  All Mexicans were originally Californians, and that the Marines went down to Mexico City and invaded it.
[01:13:54.391 --> 01:14:02.038]  And I always had thought, because I'm an old-time Californian... Well, that's true, and it's the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but look, it didn't belong to anybody.
[01:14:02.058 --> 01:14:03.340]  Let me just say this, and I'm going to let you go.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.041]  It didn't belong to anybody but the Native Americans.
[01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:07.362]  It doesn't belong to Mexico.
[01:14:07.382 --> 01:14:08.603]  It doesn't belong to Spain.
[01:14:08.623 --> 01:14:09.603]  It doesn't belong to France.
[01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:14.006]  It belongs to who builds it and creates it, and that's the American people.
[01:14:14.306 --> 01:14:26.292]  And Mexico has no claim on the Southwest, but Vicente Fox and it says they do, and it's a major problem, and Wall Street is pushing this because they want to break this country up because it makes it easier to loot.
[01:14:26.573 --> 01:14:27.533]  Now, thanks for the call.
[01:14:27.553 --> 01:14:29.414]  Let me get a comment from Jude on that.
[01:14:29.474 --> 01:14:29.714]  Jude?
[01:14:31.455 --> 01:14:33.237]  Oh, you're in the ballpark with me.
[01:14:33.457 --> 01:14:34.057]  Oh, fine.
[01:14:34.558 --> 01:14:35.558]  Let's go to another caller.
[01:14:35.779 --> 01:14:36.619]  Yeah, let's take another.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.921]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:39.762]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:45.406]  Roger in Pennsylvania, go ahead now or forever hold your peace.
[01:14:46.907 --> 01:14:47.928]  Okay, let's move on.
[01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.991]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New York.
[01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:52.852]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:14:54.613 --> 01:14:55.514]  Hello.
[01:14:55.594 --> 01:14:56.555]  Yes, Paul, go ahead.
[01:14:57.423 --> 01:15:03.185]  Dude, you were an economist under the Reagan administration, I believe, and I served under the Reagan administration, too.
[01:15:03.205 --> 01:15:04.325]  15 years U.S.
[01:15:04.365 --> 01:15:07.386]  intelligence with the National Security Agency of Washington, D.C.
[01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:08.506]  Myself.
[01:15:08.606 --> 01:15:10.587]  I'm wondering if you're hearing the same thing I am.
[01:15:11.127 --> 01:15:19.709]  I had to get a piece of levity when Rush Limbaugh had on a BP petroleum expert saying the richest oil reserves in the world were the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:15:20.592 --> 01:15:32.921]  And yet, I see the VOA, Voice of America, exploding in the last few years of all kinds of articles on the Russian pipeline, which we well know is a Russian tentacle and not one single pipeline.
[01:15:35.843 --> 01:15:37.164]  Have you been hearing the same thing?
[01:15:38.185 --> 01:15:45.550]  That the largest oil reserve in the world... You're asking questions about world energy supplies and oil supplies?
[01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:47.511]  World energy supplies.
[01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:50.173]  The richest oil reserves are in the Krasnoyarsky Mountains.
[01:15:52.438 --> 01:15:57.522]  Well, I will say that the world has not been explored for oil.
[01:15:57.843 --> 01:15:59.104]  We haven't scratched the surface.
[01:15:59.544 --> 01:16:06.771]  There's probably a thousand times more oil that is waiting to be found in the world than we have found in the last 160 years.
[01:16:08.613 --> 01:16:10.894]  It was first discovered in Titusville, Pennsylvania.
[01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:18.497]  And there's massive reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, all over Russia, all over the Stans.
[01:16:18.917 --> 01:16:22.338]  What do you think of this peak oil line we're hearing that we're all out of oil?
[01:16:22.559 --> 01:16:24.799]  Well, that's the Hubbard Line, and that's all baloney.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:36.364]  One of the things I did, that you might be interested in, I tried to figure out, this goes back 15 years ago, if you put all the oil that we've ever
[01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:38.938]  Produced and consumed in one place.
[01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:44.002]  What kind of a pool would it look like?
[01:16:44.582 --> 01:16:48.705]  And I hit upon the idea of emptying out Lake Tahoe.
[01:16:49.246 --> 01:16:50.747]  Now you know Lake Tahoe, you've been there.
[01:16:51.968 --> 01:17:02.315]  You take all the water out of Lake Tahoe and you put all the oil that we've produced through the year 2004 and you still wouldn't have filled up Lake Tahoe.
[01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:10.860]  Now you look at a map of the world and they can't even make a blue dot small enough to show you where Lake Tahoe is.
[01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:12.201]  That's how tiny it is.
[01:17:12.682 --> 01:17:19.688]  We fool ourselves into thinking that the earth is a little place and we're big people and we're using all this stuff up.
[01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:20.368]  But we're not.
[01:17:21.489 --> 01:17:32.258]  The world has scarcely been explored for oil and roughly three quarters of all the oil wells
[01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:39.492]  Drilled for oil and natural gas in the history of the world have been drilled in the oil patch of the United States.
[01:17:40.132 --> 01:17:41.513]  And isn't that the problem?
[01:17:41.553 --> 01:17:50.000]  Is that the oil barons are losing control of their monopoly because all these supplies have been found and people say, well, the Iraq War wasn't about oil because they're not shipping oil out.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.903]  No, it's about getting control and not having that oil shipped to keep the prices actually up.
[01:17:54.963 --> 01:17:56.564]  It's about artificial scarcity.
[01:17:56.685 --> 01:18:07.633]  Listen, all you had to... See, the reason we found all the oil here is that we're the only... Do you realize we're the only country in the world, Alex, where the citizens who own the surface rights own the mineral rights?
[01:18:08.573 --> 01:18:08.653]  Yes.
[01:18:08.673 --> 01:18:09.274]  Do you realize that?
[01:18:10.973 --> 01:18:11.293]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:11.633 --> 01:18:16.696]  There's no other... Mexico used to have, their citizens used to have the mineral rights.
[01:18:17.056 --> 01:18:22.278]  But in the Mexican Revolution after 1917, the government took the mineral rights back.
[01:18:22.459 --> 01:18:22.979]  Pemex.
[01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:31.123]  Well, yeah, Pemex, but I... This is when Bush was first elected, and right after his inauguration, he went down to meet with Vicente Fox.
[01:18:31.743 --> 01:18:34.544]  And I talked to Karl Rove at the time.
[01:18:34.564 --> 01:18:35.585]  He was looking for ideas.
[01:18:36.061 --> 01:18:45.634]  And I said, why don't you have the President recommend to Vicente Fox that they go back and give the citizens of Mexico the mineral rights to all the stuff they have down there.
[01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:49.059]  And they'd be swarming with wildcatters.
[01:18:49.079 --> 01:18:49.640]  Stay there!
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:50.220]  Stay there!

[01:18:54.665 --> 01:19:01.974]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.

[01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:21.430]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:30.271]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:19:30.592 --> 01:19:36.893]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:20:10.659 --> 01:20:12.119]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[01:20:12.139 --> 01:20:13.699]  A 16% increase in real money.

[01:20:57.082 --> 01:21:06.728]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:21:07.728 --> 01:21:17.254]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:18.283 --> 01:21:23.787]  It's the coming 6666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation Chapter 13.

[01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:02.023]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.463 --> 01:23:05.626]  Alright, our final segment with an amazing individual.
[01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:07.928]  I'd like to have him back up, Jude Winensky.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.604]  June, I've just got a few quick questions for you that I want to hurriedly go to a few calls here.
[01:23:12.624 --> 01:23:15.207]  During the break we were talking about Serbia.
[01:23:15.247 --> 01:23:23.556]  Very stable, becoming free market, they create a bunch of propaganda, Bill Clinton goes in and blows it to pieces, and you were saying the neocons behind that again.
[01:23:24.116 --> 01:23:29.382]  Well, I was saying that when the Cold War ended, the neocons
[01:23:29.952 --> 01:23:34.935]  I'm talking about, you know, Pearl and Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld, this whole project for a new American century.
[01:23:35.035 --> 01:23:40.118]  These are people who want an American empire with imperial outposts all over the world.
[01:23:40.178 --> 01:23:44.861]  They want to control all the government so that no one else can ever challenge us again.
[01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:59.550]  And what they did with Yugoslavia is, with their controlled use of the International Monetary Fund, which we control, and the World Bank, which we control, we went in and told our old ally, Slobodan Milosevic,
[01:24:00.517 --> 01:24:18.910]  Whose country was getting along just fine with the Bosnians, and the Croatians, and the Slovenians, that what he had to do was devalue the Dinar, which at the time, one Dinar was worth $25, in order to get it into the free market.
[01:24:19.371 --> 01:24:25.735]  And they knew that this process called shock therapy would cause the destabilization of
[01:24:31.402 --> 01:24:32.603]  You've met with the neocons.
[01:24:32.643 --> 01:24:38.526]  This so-called shock therapy, and Joseph Stiglitz has quit about it and all this, the World Bank, is meant to destroy economies.
[01:24:38.586 --> 01:24:39.507]  It's not free market.
[01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.368]  It's meant to blow them to pieces so they can then loot them.
[01:24:43.008 --> 01:24:47.471]  Well, one of the things that's unusual here is that the Liberal Democrats
[01:24:48.055 --> 01:24:56.804]  This is Jeffrey Sachs, who now is at the United Nations, and Jeffrey Sachs really believed that shock therapy was the right way to go, so the New York Times got behind it.
[01:24:57.225 --> 01:25:07.616]  Now, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which I used to be associate editor of back in the old Cold War days, they knew that it was going to unravel, so they supported
[01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:10.631]  Uh, the shock therapy at the same time.
[01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:16.875]  So you have the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal both supporting the idea, and the Russians, Gorbachev, says, hey, this must work.
[01:25:17.215 --> 01:25:19.217]  So he tried it, and it blew up the country.
[01:25:19.497 --> 01:25:26.722]  Now, I would add to this, at the same time, our loving government even used some Al-Qaeda to get the war going in Kosovo.
[01:25:27.182 --> 01:25:30.945]  So it just shows what complete whores these people are when it comes to politics.
[01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:35.968]  Uh, you actually teach economics for free every weekend on your website.
[01:25:35.988 --> 01:25:36.649]  Tell folks about that.
[01:25:36.829 --> 01:25:40.533]  Well, it's Supply Side University, and I've been doing this for eight years.
[01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:43.216]  I have more than 3,000 students all around the world.
[01:25:43.236 --> 01:25:47.540]  You just come into Wineski.com and you register to get my daily memo.
[01:25:47.861 --> 01:25:51.264]  You can also register to free get my weekly lesson.
[01:25:51.304 --> 01:25:56.390]  We just started a new semester two weeks ago with an introduction to economics.
[01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:58.412]  You can catch up with the introduction.
[01:25:59.091 --> 01:26:06.293]  And it's the only place really in the country where you can learn classical economics.
[01:26:07.854 --> 01:26:10.014]  One last question and I want to jam a call or two in here.
[01:26:11.815 --> 01:26:14.256]  How long do you think we're going to be in Iraq and how's it going to end?
[01:26:15.116 --> 01:26:18.457]  Well I really think that the forces at work now
[01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:20.673]  Uh, are going to push us out.
[01:26:20.833 --> 01:26:24.156]  We'll have to get out the same way that we got out of Vietnam.
[01:26:24.377 --> 01:26:38.211]  Because, uh, the American people are, they can take so much of this fooling around, uh, just so long, and it will be clear by, uh, closer to the end of the year that this insurgency is not being stopped.
[01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:45.432]  That it's getting bigger, and it's getting worse, and that the probabilities are that things will get better once we get out.
[01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:47.373]  But the neocons knew.
[01:26:47.433 --> 01:26:49.014]  Their top brass told them all.
[01:26:49.434 --> 01:26:52.595]  The Rand Corporation assessments had all told them this would happen.
[01:26:52.815 --> 01:26:53.695]  They knew it would happen.
[01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:54.295]  Why did they do it?
[01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:59.217]  Well, because their plan, they had a different agenda.
[01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:06.038]  They have been wanting to get control of, but that brings Israel into the picture, and that's a whole new show!
[01:27:06.418 --> 01:27:18.627]  If we want to get Israel and the Palestinian issue, because at least the dominant, Richard Perle and Wolfowitz, you know, have long ties to the Likud Party in Tel Aviv.
[01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:28.435]  And there are interests that the Israelis have with Kirkuk Oil, and that's why they're aligned with the Kurds in Iraq,
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.982]  So it's, you know, as they say Alex, it's one big mosaic.
[01:27:33.022 --> 01:27:34.803]  And that would take another show.
[01:27:35.864 --> 01:27:36.924]  It's amazing.
[01:27:36.964 --> 01:27:40.006]  So Israel, basically manipulating internal politics, says, so what?
[01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:41.807]  What happens to our GIs?
[01:27:41.907 --> 01:27:44.128]  We want this and we'll use you as a tool to do it.
[01:27:44.568 --> 01:27:47.649]  But again, I would agree with you that you're saying that's only a piece of it.
[01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.190]  Right.
[01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.511]  Listen, no more time to take calls.
[01:27:50.551 --> 01:27:51.571]  I apologize to the callers.
[01:27:51.611 --> 01:27:53.052]  I'll go to you callers after the break.
[01:27:53.312 --> 01:27:54.393]  Get to a bunch of other news.
[01:27:55.093 --> 01:27:58.816]  But Jude Winensky, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, retired from there.
[01:27:59.157 --> 01:28:03.801]  Of course, a renowned political economist and former advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:09.165]  I want to get you back up in the near future, and I appreciate your honesty talking about this out-of-control empire.
[01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:16.031]  I see the biggest threat, though, is the empire destroying American freedom and the looting of the Pentagon funds.
[01:28:17.213 --> 01:28:20.014]  Okay, well, we'll be back and talk about that sometime.
[01:28:20.174 --> 01:28:21.014]  All right, good to talk to you.
[01:28:21.054 --> 01:28:21.654]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:22.214]  You bet.
[01:28:22.254 --> 01:28:23.515]  Wenensky.com, thank you.
[01:28:23.975 --> 01:28:25.635]  All right, we'll be back with your calls.
[01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:36.678]  Just a plethora, a cornucopia, just a huge plane of news and information to discuss as we engage in another sortie into information warfare.
[01:28:37.118 --> 01:28:40.659]  I'm Alex Jones, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:28:43.755 --> 01:28:46.816]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.836 --> 01:28:50.498]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.459 --> 01:28:57.681]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:28:58.421 --> 01:29:06.684]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:29:07.285 --> 01:29:09.005]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[01:29:09.726 --> 01:29:10.326]  While you listen,
[01:29:10.982 --> 01:29:15.684]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:29:16.305 --> 01:29:17.885]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:29:18.426 --> 01:29:20.587]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:29:21.167 --> 01:29:23.188]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:29:23.748 --> 01:29:24.869]  And it's so easy.
[01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:27.570]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:29.031]  When you want.
[01:29:29.571 --> 01:29:30.211]  Where you want.
[01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:35.994]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[01:29:36.866 --> 01:29:39.688]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.

[01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:58.810]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:07.055]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.316 --> 01:30:14.360]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.821]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:21.784]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.984 --> 01:30:27.067]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.187 --> 01:30:36.073]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:39.635]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:32:13.813 --> 01:32:17.455]  And a chief advisor to Ronald Reagan, Wall Street Journal, associate editor.
[01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.675]  Telling, you know, friends.
[01:32:19.715 --> 01:32:21.576]  He has Karl Rove calling him up for advice.
[01:32:22.636 --> 01:32:24.297]  Friends of all these people went to college with him.
[01:32:26.883 --> 01:32:36.725]  Telling us it's world government, they're getting rid of the Constitution, they're taking our freedoms, they knew we wouldn't win in Iraq, they knew our troops would die en masse, and they just don't care.
[01:32:38.106 --> 01:32:42.266]  Just openly admitting it, and saying it is a world conspiracy.
[01:32:43.387 --> 01:32:47.368]  Congressman Ron Paul comes on this show and tells you it's a world government conspiracy.
[01:32:47.648 --> 01:32:49.008]  I have it in my film Matrix of Evil.
[01:32:49.028 --> 01:32:51.669]  He says it is a world government takeover conspiracy.
[01:32:51.849 --> 01:32:53.009]  They openly say it!
[01:32:54.455 --> 01:33:02.378]  In published books they write, that they put out, and still Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist, Sean Hannity, Michael Weiner, all of them!
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:05.980]  It's amazing!
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:16.544]  We're going to post that interview at PrisonPlanet.tv in the next few days, but you ought to have your friends and family who call themselves conservatives, you know, go listen to that and go, this is not conservatism!
[01:33:16.904 --> 01:33:18.685]  I mean, it's not conservatism!
[01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:35.888]  We have a pack of abortionist-promoting, gun-grabbing, open-border-pushing, world-government-creating, cashless-society-control-grid-implementing, vicious demons taking control.
[01:33:37.888 --> 01:33:41.810]  And it's time for people to get out of denial and admit what we're watching.
[01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:44.311]  Admit what we're viewing here.
[01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:46.151]  And the Democrats aren't going to save you.
[01:33:46.171 --> 01:33:47.692]  They're all voting for the wars as well.
[01:33:48.746 --> 01:33:50.647]  It's the same system, and we're in deep trouble.
[01:33:51.387 --> 01:33:55.269]  Dean and Sherry and Ray and Deborah, your calls are all coming up in a bunch of news.
[01:33:55.289 --> 01:33:56.069]  There's so much here.
[01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:00.151]  But right now, I'm honored to have Debbie Morrow on with us from New Millennium Concepts.
[01:34:00.171 --> 01:34:01.452]  She usually joins us about once a week.
[01:34:02.172 --> 01:34:03.132]  A great sponsor.
[01:34:03.753 --> 01:34:10.035]  Made in America products, and they fund our global outreach on shortwave for all the people we reach in the seven continents.
[01:34:10.055 --> 01:34:13.437]  But before I go any further, I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:18.423]  I don't sell you magic creams or, you know, garbage.
[01:34:19.203 --> 01:34:24.886]  Real stuff, real products, made in America, and it's real simple.
[01:34:25.566 --> 01:34:27.988]  If you keep drinking the tap water, you're crazy.
[01:34:28.268 --> 01:34:30.589]  I mean, there's something wrong with you.
[01:34:31.089 --> 01:34:35.391]  Or if you go buy a piece of junk filter, it might cut out some of the bad taste.
[01:34:36.592 --> 01:34:40.914]  It's like, you know, wrapping a bullet you're going to shoot yourself in the head with with some silk.
[01:34:41.954 --> 01:34:43.375]  You know, it's a velvet fist.
[01:34:44.237 --> 01:34:45.358]  With steel inside.
[01:34:45.418 --> 01:34:46.399]  It doesn't help you.
[01:34:46.959 --> 01:34:49.220]  The bottled water, in many cases, no good.
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.801]  Just type in bottled water contaminated.
[01:34:50.961 --> 01:34:52.362]  You'll get hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[01:34:52.863 --> 01:34:55.164]  You need to take control of your life with water.
[01:34:55.184 --> 01:34:58.446]  70% of your body in men, 72% in women.
[01:34:58.786 --> 01:35:00.027]  That's what our bodies are made of.
[01:35:00.287 --> 01:35:02.889]  It's a big area of our lives we can take control of.
[01:35:04.588 --> 01:35:07.610]  And I believe in this, and I really think you should take advantage of it.
[01:35:07.891 --> 01:35:08.851]  Debbie, good to have you on.
[01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:10.853]  Tell folks about the Big Berkey, a few of the specials.
[01:35:11.353 --> 01:35:12.955]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:35:13.155 --> 01:35:13.615]  Thank you.
[01:35:13.895 --> 01:35:19.340]  The Berkey Gravity Water Filters are an in-home system that you can take anywhere.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:32.450]  It does not screw onto your plumbing, need to be plumbed in in any way, and it makes your drinking water and your cooking water free of the
[01:35:33.467 --> 01:35:41.114]  Contaminants that are added to the water by your local water municipalities and things like that.
[01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:44.718]  Also, you know, different chemicals that get into your well water.
[01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:51.784]  The Berkey actually takes it down to a non-detectable level in most cases.
[01:35:53.146 --> 01:35:55.508]  Just about anything that's added to the water.
[01:35:56.331 --> 01:35:57.414]  That's not good for you.
[01:35:57.434 --> 01:35:59.279]  The Berkey breaks down and takes out.
[01:35:59.479 --> 01:36:03.310]  And to explain this, even really expensive filters you buy or have installed...
[01:36:04.068 --> 01:36:06.769]  I mean, it's a new standard, non-detectable level.
[01:36:07.169 --> 01:36:13.231]  Non-detectable means they put the stuff in the filter, yard growth, that is green water, folks, you know, in a test.
[01:36:13.591 --> 01:36:18.433]  They take the water that's been purified, they put it in a petri dish for a week, and nothing grows.
[01:36:18.533 --> 01:36:18.773]  Right.
[01:36:19.113 --> 01:36:28.736]  And even people that have whole home systems, like most of the water softener systems, you know, a lot of your listeners might say, well, I don't need a Berkey because I have a water softener.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:59.001]  Well the water softener in most cases uses salt to soften the water and then you're drinking salt water which is not good for your body to have that much salt and unfortunately the Berkey doesn't I mean it's a good thing Berkeys don't take out the minerals so the salt actually does not come out with your Berkey filter so I tell customers that in most cases when they have a home system
[01:36:59.921 --> 01:37:26.865]  Or if they're thinking about having one put in for their laundry and things like that, there's usually a bypass valve that is installed at the time that they get their whole home system and they use that bypass valve to get their drinking and their cooking water because if you've got a whole home system and it's using salt and you're drinking that water and cooking with it and you wonder why you have high blood pressure,
[01:37:27.768 --> 01:37:29.570]  Just look at what you're putting in your body.
[01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:33.915]  So you want to use bypassed water and filter it.
[01:37:34.075 --> 01:37:35.096]  Debbie, I mean it's simple.
[01:37:36.197 --> 01:37:36.658]  It's simple.
[01:37:36.978 --> 01:37:38.560]  I've looked at the filtration systems.
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.341]  I've looked at it all.
[01:37:39.421 --> 01:37:40.422]  This is the best system.
[01:37:41.003 --> 01:37:43.365]  And it's a great price.
[01:37:43.385 --> 01:37:45.528]  $199 with the Berkey light, with the black Berkey elements.
[01:37:45.588 --> 01:37:46.549]  You get one free gift.
[01:37:46.989 --> 01:37:48.130]  A bunch of great free gifts.
[01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:52.932]  You've got portable sports bottles that make your water cleaner than bottled water.
[01:37:52.952 --> 01:37:55.874]  It doesn't cut everything out, but they're like $35 at the store.
[01:37:55.894 --> 01:37:57.715]  You can get five of them for $99.
[01:37:58.095 --> 01:37:59.135]  So that's a big discount.
[01:37:59.175 --> 01:38:01.396]  About $10 off per sports bottle.
[01:38:01.657 --> 01:38:04.838]  Great to take to the gym or to work or on a hike or whatever.
[01:38:05.258 --> 01:38:08.560]  You've got the Berkey light with the LED lights built into it for $2.59 with two free gifts.
[01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:13.002]  And they ship it out to you UPS ground.
[01:38:13.422 --> 01:38:15.904]  Call Debbie, ask about the specials if the phone's busy.
[01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.165]  Just leave your name and number, she'll call you right back.
[01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:18.945]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:19.105 --> 01:38:20.306]  Write this number down, 808-803-4438.
[01:38:20.326 --> 01:38:21.426]  Don't procrastinate, 808-803-4438.
[01:38:21.446 --> 01:38:24.868]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and look at the different systems, read about them.
[01:38:33.968 --> 01:38:42.214]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special when you order and write in the comment section which free gift you want at Berkeywater.com or 888-803-4438.
[01:38:42.294 --> 01:38:45.776]  Tell them Alex Jones sends you to take advantage of this.
[01:38:46.116 --> 01:38:48.818]  Debbie, you've also got filters for the showers.
[01:38:48.858 --> 01:38:51.000]  You've got just a lot of other stuff.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.960]  Potassium iodate.
[01:38:52.341 --> 01:38:53.121]  Give her a call.
[01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:54.262]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:54.482 --> 01:38:55.423]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:55.583 --> 01:38:57.944]  And for those who don't know how to spell Berkey, it's B-E-R.
[01:38:59.241 --> 01:39:02.382]  K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[01:39:02.462 --> 01:39:03.422]  Great having you on, Debbie.
[01:39:03.442 --> 01:39:03.783]  Take care.
[01:39:03.803 --> 01:39:04.323]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:04.423 --> 01:39:04.643]  Bye.
[01:39:04.683 --> 01:39:05.043]  You bet.
[01:39:05.503 --> 01:39:06.683]  And again, I'm not going to belabor it.
[01:39:06.944 --> 01:39:15.546]  You just want to keep procrastinating, keep drinking sodium fluoride, and keep drinking all the mercury and the bacteria, and just all of it, and just go ahead.
[01:39:15.746 --> 01:39:16.066]  Okay?
[01:39:17.247 --> 01:39:20.568]  I mean, I'm not... This is really simple stuff.
[01:39:21.548 --> 01:39:23.229]  And we know what we're talking about here.
[01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.489]  Alright?
[01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:27.030]  It's that simple.
[01:39:27.515 --> 01:39:30.056]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:39:30.176 --> 01:39:32.197]  Dean in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:39:32.257 --> 01:39:32.557]  Welcome.
[01:39:34.038 --> 01:39:35.218]  We're hung up right as I went to them.
[01:39:35.239 --> 01:39:35.839]  They always do that.
[01:39:36.199 --> 01:39:36.839]  All right.
[01:39:36.959 --> 01:39:38.120]  Sherry in Pennsylvania.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:38.580]  Go ahead.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:39.701]  Hello, Alex.
[01:39:39.781 --> 01:39:41.261]  Love your show.
[01:39:41.481 --> 01:39:42.302]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[01:39:42.422 --> 01:39:42.782]  Thank you.
[01:39:42.822 --> 01:39:43.122]  Welcome.
[01:39:43.562 --> 01:39:45.483]  I was catching part of the show.
[01:39:45.623 --> 01:39:46.944]  I'm in the process of moving.
[01:39:47.004 --> 01:39:49.725]  I'm going to have to get my Berkey water filter in my new house.
[01:39:49.925 --> 01:39:51.286]  But I wanted to talk.
[01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:56.208]  I heard you all hop from Kerry to oil to Iraq and all this.
[01:39:56.957 --> 01:40:10.567]  And I wanted to let you know that from listening and understanding some of your cues, by the way, I own several Annals of the Bohemian Club volumes from 1896 to 1987, I own.
[01:40:10.988 --> 01:40:16.231]  And if it weren't for you pointing me to it, I would have never been interested enough to know.
[01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:16.872]  I had to find out.
[01:40:16.892 --> 01:40:17.833]  Well, how did you get those?
[01:40:18.173 --> 01:40:19.974]  A-B-E, rarebooks.com.
[01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:21.495]  Well, it's A-B-E books dot com.
[01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:22.776]  How much were they a piece?
[01:40:23.036 --> 01:40:26.339]  Well, some of them were as much as $50, some of them because of the low quality.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.740]  I don't think so.
[01:40:47.223 --> 01:40:53.007]  Well, I've got the 86 to 96, and it's got Bush Jr.
[01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:54.948]  and his dad giving the speech below the owl.
[01:40:55.028 --> 01:40:56.329]  Yeah, I don't have Bush Jr.
[01:40:56.349 --> 01:40:56.749]  I don't think I do.
[01:40:56.769 --> 01:40:57.910]  You could do me a big favor.
[01:40:57.950 --> 01:41:03.354]  If you would go to a copying facility and make me color copies of some of the key pages.
[01:41:04.094 --> 01:41:06.336]  You know, I almost thought that your page was fake.
[01:41:06.776 --> 01:41:08.017]  And I had to find out for myself.
[01:41:08.137 --> 01:41:09.277]  Or you could scan it.
[01:41:09.317 --> 01:41:13.099]  Listen, you could scan those in high res and email them to me.
[01:41:13.379 --> 01:41:14.680]  I would be more than happy to do that.
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.080]  Right now I'm in the process of moving.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.341]  Well, I'll post them once you do that.
[01:41:17.361 --> 01:41:19.762]  It's tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:41:19.962 --> 01:41:21.143]  But go over this.
[01:41:21.443 --> 01:41:23.284]  You thought I was making up Bohemian Grove?
[01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:26.505]  Honestly, I couldn't believe that that was so blatant.
[01:41:26.585 --> 01:41:27.546]  I really couldn't believe it.
[01:41:27.646 --> 01:41:29.226]  And so I went and I looked online.
[01:41:29.727 --> 01:41:32.588]  And somebody close to me just happens to be a rare book dealer.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.183]  And he told me about first edition limited copy books and how much they go up in value.
[01:41:37.583 --> 01:41:43.367]  So I thought to myself, well, if nothing else, I'll have something that'll go up in value because it'll probably be worth something someday.
[01:41:43.528 --> 01:41:47.691]  So what did you think as you went and checked out Bohemian Grove and got their own publications?
[01:41:48.051 --> 01:41:48.892]  It was shocking.
[01:41:49.012 --> 01:42:00.380]  It was, you know, I mean, to think that it was real, really, I mean, to see it in my lap and to see the whole thing from where they talk about the serious, the serious sacrifices, they were real bodies back then.
[01:42:00.942 --> 01:42:04.064]  Now they say it's an effigy, but you know, I couldn't find anything to show for the effigy.
[01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:08.187]  Wait a minute, you've got their publication talking about real sacrifices?
[01:42:08.768 --> 01:42:10.069]  Yes, from the old books.
[01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:11.830]  The ancient books talk about the sacrifices.
[01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:14.372]  You have the pictures yourself on your site.
[01:42:14.492 --> 01:42:19.756]  Well no, I mean, I've got a picture they released of a little black boy tied down, but I mean, you're saying you've got...
[01:42:20.618 --> 01:42:22.298]  Wow, I really need you to send me that.
[01:42:22.519 --> 01:42:24.999]  Well, now a lot of it's written down.
[01:42:25.359 --> 01:42:26.800]  They didn't have as many pictures back then.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:29.540]  You've got to remember, this was right around the time pictures were just becoming popular.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:29.881]  No, I know.
[01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:30.741]  We've got copies from 1915.
[01:42:30.821 --> 01:42:33.201]  I've got one from 1980.
[01:42:33.722 --> 01:42:34.822]  No, I'm talking 1896.
[01:42:37.083 --> 01:42:42.104]  But what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, I see all of these things that you led me to.
[01:42:42.124 --> 01:42:43.744]  I mean, it was absolutely amazing.
[01:42:44.104 --> 01:42:45.185]  They all panned out.
[01:42:45.265 --> 01:42:46.045]  Every single one of them.
[01:42:46.165 --> 01:42:47.865]  I checked your references.
[01:42:48.386 --> 01:42:48.686]  I did.
[01:42:48.706 --> 01:42:49.746]  You tell people to go look.
[01:42:50.191 --> 01:42:54.693]  I didn't want to believe it, so I went and looked for myself, and lo and behold, you were right.
[01:42:55.173 --> 01:43:02.316]  And well, from now on, I'm starting to study a little more about the Skull and Bones and Yale College, and they brag to themselves.
[01:43:02.877 --> 01:43:07.979]  In the Yale Alumni Magazine, I have a link I'll send you, where they say that they stick up for each other.
[01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:09.631]  Even outside of school.
[01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.612]  And this is why all these people are world leaders.
[01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:14.254]  Because they know they're meant to be the world leaders and they're bragging on themselves.
[01:43:14.274 --> 01:43:15.335]  Well, it's skull and bones.
[01:43:15.375 --> 01:43:17.537]  You have to give them half your inheritance.
[01:43:18.378 --> 01:43:22.040]  Or when you die, you have to give them half of your money.
[01:43:22.881 --> 01:43:26.183]  And then they also pay you while you're there and help put you into business.
[01:43:26.264 --> 01:43:27.865]  It's a big corporation.
[01:43:28.005 --> 01:43:28.245]  Right.
[01:43:28.345 --> 01:43:34.450]  And what they're doing... You've talked very briefly on your show and on your site about the Hegelian principle.
[01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:37.292]  I think you need to look up the philosopher Hegel.
[01:43:37.745 --> 01:43:38.866]  Because that's who they're following.
[01:43:38.886 --> 01:43:40.228]  They're following the philosopher Hegel.
[01:43:40.608 --> 01:43:43.851]  And it's not just problem reaction solution.
[01:43:43.971 --> 01:43:44.672]  That's Hegelian.
[01:43:45.073 --> 01:43:46.534]  It's also about limiting choices.
[01:43:46.975 --> 01:43:48.756]  Making you think that there's only certain viable choices.
[01:43:48.776 --> 01:43:50.318]  Yeah, they give you false choices, yeah.
[01:43:50.498 --> 01:43:51.319]  Right, well, no.
[01:43:51.339 --> 01:43:53.421]  They give you choices that they have control of.
[01:43:53.842 --> 01:43:58.286]  Well, yeah, it's like you can bet on this horse or that horse or this horse, but they own all three horses.
[01:43:58.446 --> 01:44:00.909]  Right, and don't bet on those horses because they're just not good.
[01:44:01.317 --> 01:44:01.917]  Leave them alone.
[01:44:01.977 --> 01:44:03.918]  Don't even pay attention to what those owners say.
[01:44:03.958 --> 01:44:08.880]  Don't even, you know, so that what they do is they make... It's all basically sales tactics.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.081]  Well, yes it is.
[01:44:10.321 --> 01:44:15.323]  And until they have control of the choices that are alternative, then you're not going to hear about them.
[01:44:15.643 --> 01:44:17.444]  Like, for example, I'm in the process of moving.
[01:44:17.644 --> 01:44:23.726]  I am moving into a house that has something called ceramic off-peak heating.
[01:44:24.266 --> 01:44:29.989]  This costs a quarter less than what it would cost to heat your home with a central system, or with oil.
[01:44:31.078 --> 01:44:39.365]  It costs that much less, but you never hear about it because the oil companies want you to think that the only thing available is their product.
[01:44:39.766 --> 01:44:43.148]  They engineer the entire society where that's all you can basically buy.
[01:44:43.188 --> 01:44:43.769]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:45.410]  Very interesting points.
[01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.911]  Debra.
[01:44:46.511 --> 01:44:48.433]  Debra in Michigan, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:44:50.355 --> 01:44:53.037]  I got a little bit of a cold, so... That's okay, go ahead.
[01:44:53.737 --> 01:44:58.742]  Yes, all I wanted to say was that my grandfather was the owner of what was called, and people
[01:44:59.412 --> 01:45:02.273]  Older people from California will remember Douglas Oil.
[01:45:03.234 --> 01:45:04.034]  He owned all of it.
[01:45:04.354 --> 01:45:04.714]  Okay.
[01:45:05.014 --> 01:45:25.963]  Okay, and one time when my dad was out in California golfing with his father in Palm Springs, they, you know, a bunch of the old oil boys were all having lunch and golfing too, and they were talking about, now this was in, we're talking about I think 1970, they were talking about the coming oil shortage.
[01:45:27.919 --> 01:45:34.063]  And he was warning my father, he says, what they're trying to do is they're trying to bring it up to a world market price.
[01:45:34.884 --> 01:45:40.488]  And he said, why should they be paying $4 a gallon in Japan while we're paying 23 cents a gallon here?
[01:45:40.928 --> 01:45:47.473]  And what they're going to do is they're going to create a fake oil shortage to increase the price and get it up to a world market price.
[01:45:49.321 --> 01:46:05.890]  All the other guys in the particular club were laughing, going, oh yeah, big oil shortage, and they were just, you know, to them it was funny, because they knew they were going to be made... Yeah, they create artificial scarcity, and then they jack the price up, and it falls a little bit, but never to the level before.
[01:46:06.251 --> 01:46:07.331]  Yep, you got it.
[01:46:07.631 --> 01:46:09.372]  That's basically all I had to say.
[01:46:09.392 --> 01:46:10.873]  All right, good to hear from you.
[01:46:10.893 --> 01:46:14.095]  Oh, by the way, the girl that just called up, there are pictures on the internet.
[01:46:14.515 --> 01:46:15.336]  I did find them.
[01:46:15.616 --> 01:46:18.958]  My computer crashed about a week ago, so they're gone, so I can't send them to you.
[01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:25.419]  Of the actual live or dead bodies, real dead bodies at the Bohemian Grove Sacrifice.
[01:46:27.061 --> 01:46:28.862]  There are pictures on the internet.
[01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:30.023]  Someone has posted them.
[01:46:30.644 --> 01:46:33.046]  Well, again, I only... And they're from the 50's and the 60's.
[01:46:33.546 --> 01:46:34.627]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[01:46:34.707 --> 01:46:35.688]  I appreciate the call.
[01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:42.774]  What I have is the official publications of the Grove that, again, are published by them.
[01:46:42.834 --> 01:46:46.117]  You can call the phone number on them and it's the Bohemian Grove Club and they answer the phone.
[01:46:46.858 --> 01:46:55.320]  And it's bound bodies, and mock sacrifices, and little bound black boy, and uh... it was a National Geographic mock sacrifice.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.181]  I don't know about that claim.
[01:46:57.201 --> 01:47:02.702]  I mean, I'd have to actually sit, you know, have it, and call the Grove and say, did you publish this book?
[01:47:02.722 --> 01:47:04.363]  Which I've done with the others.
[01:47:04.443 --> 01:47:06.564]  But yeah, no, it's definitely devil worship.
[01:47:06.684 --> 01:47:08.864]  I mean, it's really going on, folks.
[01:47:08.884 --> 01:47:09.664]  This isn't a joke.
[01:47:10.545 --> 01:47:15.066]  And I'm sorry that your so-called Christian conservative leaders are involved in this, but
[01:47:16.454 --> 01:47:18.435]  This is the real deal.
[01:47:18.715 --> 01:47:21.136]  Alright, I want to get into some news now.
[01:47:21.596 --> 01:47:22.056]  Summary.
[01:47:22.476 --> 01:47:25.517]  Teams lack Constitution knowledge.
[01:47:25.577 --> 01:47:37.241]  Associated Press, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation sponsored a study of high school students' attitudes about the First Amendment and the Constitution that guarantees freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly.
[01:47:38.132 --> 01:47:46.217]  The findings, more than one in three students surveyed, said the guarantees went too far in sharp contrast to the teachers and principals who were questioned.
[01:47:46.497 --> 01:47:46.977]  The remedy?
[01:47:47.318 --> 01:47:55.503]  Better teaching of the Constitution and the rights that it protects, which the study suggests will be embraced by students once they know about them.
[01:47:56.063 --> 01:48:02.487]  Of course, I've got the more detailed article from USA Today, where half of them didn't like the First Amendment.
[01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:06.471]  And they had another study last year that was even worse.
[01:48:06.491 --> 01:48:10.992]  It was like sixty-what-seven percent, I remember, were actually against the First Amendment.
[01:48:12.432 --> 01:48:13.293]  One in three U.S.
[01:48:13.333 --> 01:48:21.155]  high school students say the press ought to be more restricted, and even more say the government should approve newspaper stories before readers see them.
[01:48:21.215 --> 01:48:24.556]  So, see, that's double-think.
[01:48:26.156 --> 01:48:32.178]  One-third, or more than a third, believe you should restrict it, but half or more believe you should restrict it.
[01:48:32.278 --> 01:48:32.838]  It's the same thing.
[01:48:33.513 --> 01:48:34.113]  One in three U.S.
[01:48:34.133 --> 01:48:42.619]  high school students say the press ought to be more restricted, and even more say the government should approve newspaper stories before readers see them, according to a survey being released today.
[01:48:43.679 --> 01:48:59.169]  The survey, one of the largest of its kind, of 112,003 students, finds that 36% believe newspapers should get government approval of stories before publishing, 51% say they should be able to publish freely, 13% have no opinion.
[01:49:00.086 --> 01:49:05.551]  Ask whether the press enjoys too much freedom, not enough, or about the right amount.
[01:49:05.571 --> 01:49:10.716]  32% say too much, 37% say the right amount, 10% say it has too little.
[01:49:11.297 --> 01:49:20.165]  The survey of the First Amendment rights was commissioned by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundations and conducted last spring by the University of Connecticut.
[01:49:20.486 --> 01:49:21.967]  It also questioned 327 principals and 7,889 teachers.
[01:49:26.943 --> 01:49:33.126]  The findings aren't surprising, said Jack DeVark, director of the High School Journalism Institute at Indiana University.
[01:49:34.066 --> 01:49:40.949]  In Bloomington, even professional journalists are often unaware of a lot of the freedoms that might be associated with the First Amendment, he says.
[01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:44.511]  We'll come back and talk about what the First Amendment really means.
[01:49:45.171 --> 01:49:47.512]  Take your calls, cover a ton of other news.
[01:49:48.073 --> 01:49:49.553]  You don't want to miss the rest of this broadcast.

[01:49:53.524 --> 01:49:57.851]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.032 --> 01:50:02.379]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:04.872 --> 01:50:07.014]  What is this disaster for the New World Order?
[01:50:07.034 --> 01:50:10.277]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:50:10.297 --> 01:50:14.401]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:53:06.856 --> 01:53:12.918]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:53:14.399 --> 01:53:21.602]  Or the press, and then it goes on to the right to assemble attention of the government for redress of grievances, speech, all of it!
[01:53:23.482 --> 01:53:26.483]  And most people, most adults I've talked to go, what's the first amendment?
[01:53:26.603 --> 01:53:27.924]  Oh, freedom of the press.
[01:53:29.184 --> 01:53:30.385]  Or freedom of religion.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:37.581]  Hardly anyone I've talked to, I mean people I've talked to who make $100,000 a year in middle class, they're pretty smart folks.
[01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:39.622]  They just don't know because they've never been focused on it.
[01:53:39.642 --> 01:53:41.202]  They don't ever think about it.
[01:53:41.802 --> 01:53:45.483]  And so if somebody just tells them, well you still got a First Amendment, they just change the definition.
[01:53:45.523 --> 01:53:48.203]  People go, okay, I've got a right to be told what to say and do.
[01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:53.504]  Or your child writes about a gun in an article in 8th grade.
[01:53:53.544 --> 01:53:56.265]  They say, write a fictional story.
[01:53:56.285 --> 01:53:57.565]  You write a story about a cowboy.
[01:53:58.439 --> 01:53:59.279]  And you get arrested.
[01:53:59.319 --> 01:54:02.941]  Or a story about your dad is a captain of the Marine Corps and you talk about his M-16.
[01:54:03.381 --> 01:54:06.462]  My dad's got an M-16 and you get arrested.
[01:54:06.482 --> 01:54:08.743]  They're getting rid of free speech, folks.
[01:54:08.783 --> 01:54:09.543]  It's thought crime.
[01:54:10.323 --> 01:54:11.744]  And they're changing the definitions.
[01:54:12.364 --> 01:54:15.165]  Well, you've got free speech as long as it doesn't hurt somebody's feelings.
[01:54:16.081 --> 01:54:22.506]  I got video of Catholic priests and Protestant preachers having their arms broken in an anti-abortion protest.
[01:54:22.966 --> 01:54:25.849]  Peaceful protesters having the police just break their arms on purpose.
[01:54:26.389 --> 01:54:28.431]  The liberals just loved it back in the 90's.
[01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:29.832]  Now it's happening to them.
[01:54:29.872 --> 01:54:30.492]  They don't like it.
[01:54:30.892 --> 01:54:32.374]  See, we're all losing our freedoms.
[01:54:32.534 --> 01:54:36.136]  I was thinking about torture last night.
[01:54:37.501 --> 01:54:43.708]  Promoting torture and saying, tying somebody down to a board and dunking them into water until they start suffocating.
[01:54:44.008 --> 01:54:45.089]  Well, that's not torture.
[01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:50.315]  And if we beat somebody up to the point they die, we didn't do it on purpose, didn't mean to kill them, that's not torture.
[01:54:52.678 --> 01:54:54.800]  Well, it's not torture if we change the definition.
[01:54:55.419 --> 01:55:04.783]  And then meanwhile, people are going to prison for following orders to torture people, but the neocons are on TV and in confirmation hearings in ridges over in England, saying torture's good.
[01:55:05.304 --> 01:55:06.804]  So see, they're just softening us up.
[01:55:06.824 --> 01:55:07.765]  They're just conditioning us.
[01:55:07.805 --> 01:55:11.947]  And Connalisa Rice and Gonzales and all of them are saying, well, it's not torture.
[01:55:12.367 --> 01:55:13.647]  We say if it's torture.
[01:55:14.048 --> 01:55:15.788]  See, I mean, this is the delusional nature.
[01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:21.211]  Or, well, it's not a First Amendment violation to have George Bush seize the Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[01:55:22.156 --> 01:55:23.697]  Why, they've got to be 501c3.
[01:55:23.737 --> 01:55:25.438]  They've got to be under government control.
[01:55:26.779 --> 01:55:27.199]  Well, no.
[01:55:27.299 --> 01:55:29.540]  Churches never had to do that before until 50 years ago.
[01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:31.722]  And they just, again, changed definitions.
[01:55:31.782 --> 01:55:32.862]  Oh, you've got a First Amendment.
[01:55:33.062 --> 01:55:34.363]  Just sign this little form.
[01:55:35.284 --> 01:55:36.244]  And it's a formality.
[01:55:36.264 --> 01:55:38.726]  And then over the years, they started adding to the form.
[01:55:38.766 --> 01:55:39.566]  It's not a law.
[01:55:39.846 --> 01:55:40.867]  It's a regulation.
[01:55:42.176 --> 01:55:53.140]  Now to the point, I have actual letters given to the entire congregation of a huge Baptist church in Austin, this is three years ago, telling them, do not talk about politics when you're out eating at church functions.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.260]  Don't talk about it in Sunday school.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.821]  Don't talk about it in the building!
[01:55:59.002 --> 01:56:03.903]  Now again, the preacher can talk about the politicians he doesn't like all day long.
[01:56:06.624 --> 01:56:08.725]  But they tell you they can't.
[01:56:08.805 --> 01:56:11.126]  But see, now it's spread to, you don't talk about it.
[01:56:11.989 --> 01:56:13.650]  In America, we don't talk about it.
[01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:17.571]  That's where we used to meet and discuss and, you know, have the town hall meetings, was church.
[01:56:18.532 --> 01:56:19.352]  Not anymore!
[01:56:19.392 --> 01:56:20.132]  You don't rock the boat.
[01:56:20.313 --> 01:56:21.433]  See, where's the First Amendment?
[01:56:21.473 --> 01:56:27.496]  Where is Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof?
[01:56:28.176 --> 01:56:33.178]  The separation of church and state that Jefferson talked about is the government isn't involved in religion.
[01:56:33.578 --> 01:56:36.179]  Religion can be involved in whatever it wants to be involved in.
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:37.920]  But instead,
[01:56:39.193 --> 01:56:40.175]  The inverse of that.
[01:56:40.195 --> 01:56:46.485]  Oh, we're going to have a faith-based initiative with nine billion dollars a year that Hillary suddenly supports Bush on.
[01:56:46.725 --> 01:56:47.406]  Of course they do.
[01:56:47.626 --> 01:56:48.908]  To federalize the churches.
[01:56:48.948 --> 01:56:51.112]  You think it's bad now?
[01:56:51.893 --> 01:56:52.334]  Just wait.
[01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:55.771]  We'll come back, start the third hour, take a ton of your calls.
[01:56:55.791 --> 01:56:57.232]  I've got a huge stack of vital news here.

[01:57:37.798 --> 01:57:41.482]  We'll be back with the third hour on the first day of February.
[01:57:41.502 --> 01:57:41.562]  Bye!
[01:57:49.924 --> 01:57:54.110]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.771 --> 01:57:55.592]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.333 --> 01:57:57.214]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.234 --> 01:58:01.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.101 --> 01:58:06.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.532 --> 01:58:15.136]  All right, my friends, now into our number three, the first day of February 05.
[01:58:15.736 --> 01:58:22.821]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, as we wage war on corruption, as we crash the lies and disinformation.
[01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:24.943]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[01:58:25.443 --> 01:58:34.390]  Websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, and don't forget the new updated site with a great webmaster, InfoWars.net.
[01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:36.672]  A lot of different news on all those sites.
[01:58:38.496 --> 01:58:38.736]  U.S.
[01:58:38.776 --> 01:58:40.617]  students say press freedoms go too far.
[01:58:40.637 --> 01:58:45.738]  They want to restrict the press and have the government control the media in a new major study, USA Today.
[01:58:45.758 --> 01:58:47.158]  So that's what the brainwashing's doing.
[01:58:47.518 --> 01:58:49.258]  You're welcome to talk about that if you'd like.
[01:58:49.639 --> 01:58:51.699]  Also, I didn't spend enough time on this yesterday.
[01:58:52.259 --> 01:59:04.942]  Over in the super-liberal progressive society of Germany, it doesn't matter if you're an out-of-work, 25-year-old female computer programmer, you can go be a prostitute and we're going to take your
[01:59:06.258 --> 01:59:07.099]  Unemployment away.
[01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:08.699]  You've got to take a job as a whore.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:10.120]  A dangerous job.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.181]  A immoral job.
[01:59:11.241 --> 01:59:11.561]  Whatever.
[01:59:12.381 --> 01:59:14.142]  The point is that the woman doesn't want to do it.
[01:59:14.442 --> 01:59:15.583]  They're trying to force her to do it.
[01:59:15.883 --> 01:59:20.686]  And now they're teaching our school children in America, mainstream news, to be prostitutes.
[01:59:20.726 --> 01:59:21.566]  That is a job.
[01:59:23.487 --> 01:59:24.588]  It's not a joke, folks.
[01:59:24.668 --> 01:59:26.369]  We need to talk about that also.
[01:59:26.509 --> 01:59:28.490]  Parents and children being arrested of their children.
[01:59:28.770 --> 01:59:29.831]  Don't finish their homework.
[01:59:29.871 --> 01:59:30.471]  Making everything a
[01:59:31.565 --> 01:59:34.926]  Crime, yet more national ID card legislation being passed.
[01:59:34.946 --> 01:59:35.587]  They already passed it.
[01:59:35.607 --> 01:59:36.827]  Why do they need more?
[01:59:37.207 --> 01:59:38.408]  This is even expanding it.
[01:59:39.128 --> 01:59:40.509]  It's all coming up.
[01:59:41.409 --> 01:59:42.870]  But right now, let's take calls.
[01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:44.390]  Dean in Canada.
[01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:45.151]  Dean, go ahead.
[01:59:45.191 --> 01:59:45.771]  You're on the air.
[01:59:46.151 --> 01:59:46.591]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:46.631 --> 01:59:48.092]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:59:48.132 --> 01:59:48.912]  Thanks for calling!
[01:59:49.072 --> 01:59:52.774]  Thank you for honoring my French heritage with the way you pronounced information.
[01:59:52.794 --> 01:59:55.935]  I've got a little tidbit of information for you folks.
[01:59:56.515 --> 01:59:57.476]  Today, they've introduced...
[01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:59.310]  I don't think so.
[02:00:17.535 --> 02:00:27.843]  And it is utterly unconstitutional because of the fact that, I thank the good Lord for all the information he's blessed me with, because I've researched and found that our laws are based exactly on the same kind of stuff yours are.
[02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:35.853]  Replacing our liberties are the same tyranny laws they're passing all over the western world.
[02:00:35.913 --> 02:00:42.218]  Yeah, but the thing is, the common law that we share is exactly the same, and it is rather well embodied in your Constitution.
[02:00:42.498 --> 02:00:45.240]  Yeah, but it comes out of the Magna Carta, and you're right.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.782]  But it also goes back to Christianity.
[02:00:47.802 --> 02:00:49.383]  Yeah, it goes back to Mount Sinai.
[02:00:50.084 --> 02:00:56.649]  Yes, and nevertheless, they didn't count on a resourceful fellow like me, thank you good Lord above,
[02:00:57.062 --> 02:01:03.289]  To be able to put it all together, any of the things that I've found, and send it to the powerhouse that we have here called the Senate.
[02:01:04.050 --> 02:01:08.094]  And as I understand, I will either be called today or tomorrow regarding it.
[02:01:08.655 --> 02:01:16.003]  And as I understand, one of the good Senators, the only good Senator that I know of in our officialdom here,
[02:01:16.693 --> 02:01:22.737]  I took home all my information to read it over the weekend, which is a good thing because it's not often they do something like that.
[02:01:23.377 --> 02:01:27.179]  So what, you're trying to educate them on how the common law is being violated?
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:27.940]  Exactly.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:34.504]  And not only that, I took liberty last week as well to send the same information with a few extras.
[02:01:34.966 --> 02:01:37.768]  To the official opposition stating exactly the same thing.
[02:01:37.888 --> 02:01:45.575]  And all of these, this new amendment to marriage, is based upon the Charter, what we call the Charter of Rights and Liberties from 1982.
[02:01:45.795 --> 02:01:47.156]  And I spelled out how that is basically one
[02:01:52.375 --> 02:01:55.477]  He's been an awful junk, which should have never even passed muster.
[02:01:57.158 --> 02:02:03.302]  Marriage is something between a man and a woman, just like a woman has babies.
[02:02:03.863 --> 02:02:06.124]  This is something other people just can't do.
[02:02:07.705 --> 02:02:12.649]  People live together, certainly it's a free country, but they can't have our marriage.
[02:02:13.029 --> 02:02:16.992]  And they shouldn't be allowed to be in the schools recruiting because they can't reproduce.
[02:02:17.352 --> 02:02:18.633]  That's the only way they can.
[02:02:18.833 --> 02:02:20.614]  They can't increase the numbers through drafting.
[02:02:21.724 --> 02:02:28.190]  We need to guard the innocence of our children.
[02:02:29.151 --> 02:02:30.553]  That is of paramount importance.
[02:02:30.733 --> 02:02:31.234]  Anything else?
[02:02:31.494 --> 02:02:35.238]  You want to hold over?
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:37.100]  Sure.
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:38.461]  Very briefly on the other side.
[02:02:38.501 --> 02:02:39.482]  We'll come back with your calls.
[02:02:40.183 --> 02:02:40.884]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:02:40.924 --> 02:02:41.444]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:46.906]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:50.208]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.348 --> 02:02:54.250]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:58.512]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.872 --> 02:03:02.654]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.774 --> 02:03:04.595]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.175 --> 02:03:08.097]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.137 --> 02:03:12.841]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.001 --> 02:03:16.043]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.223 --> 02:03:19.085]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.565 --> 02:03:25.710]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.210 --> 02:03:30.013]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.413 --> 02:03:31.774]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.174 --> 02:03:33.175]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.235 --> 02:03:35.476]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[02:03:44.562 --> 02:03:46.144]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:46.525 --> 02:03:52.273]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:52.534 --> 02:03:57.681]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:58.022 --> 02:04:00.125]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements
[02:04:00.265 --> 02:04:00.906]  We're good to go!
[02:04:22.248 --> 02:04:28.231]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:28.511 --> 02:04:37.536]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:40.817]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.837 --> 02:04:42.958]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.499 --> 02:04:48.701]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:04:49.461 --> 02:04:50.682]  In business and socially.
[02:04:51.323 --> 02:04:57.707]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:04:58.308 --> 02:05:00.029]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[02:05:00.749 --> 02:05:06.733]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:05:07.354 --> 02:05:08.915]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:05:09.455 --> 02:05:11.616]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:05:12.197 --> 02:05:14.218]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:05:14.798 --> 02:05:15.899]  And it's so easy.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:18.621]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:05:19.462 --> 02:05:20.002]  When you want,
[02:05:20.575 --> 02:05:22.436]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[02:05:22.456 --> 02:05:22.596]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:05:22.616 --> 02:05:22.896]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:05:22.916 --> 02:05:23.076]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:05:50.012 --> 02:05:53.453]  Think about how conditioned we've become.
[02:05:53.493 --> 02:06:00.957]  That in California schools, when they have career day, they pay to have experts come in and teach the young girls
[02:06:19.349 --> 02:06:24.273]  And boys, they could be psychics or topless bar dancers.
[02:06:27.675 --> 02:06:37.182]  And now in Germany, if you're a computer programmer and go on unemployment, you have to accept a job as a prostitute at a brothel or you lose your unemployment.
[02:06:37.202 --> 02:06:44.448]  I mean, see, we're so conditioned by the craziness now that I talked about that in the first hour and nobody even called in about that subject.
[02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:47.151]  Call in about other issues.
[02:06:47.632 --> 02:06:51.335]  But we're so conditioned here, they've already passed one national ID card piece of legislation.
[02:06:51.695 --> 02:06:55.799]  On the heels of that, they've got another one to expand it even more.
[02:06:55.819 --> 02:06:57.581]  And I'm not even that worried.
[02:06:57.621 --> 02:07:00.444]  I'm just like, oh, well, just more tyranny, more insanity.
[02:07:00.744 --> 02:07:03.447]  Oh, they found more cancer viruses in a new type of vaccine.
[02:07:03.647 --> 02:07:05.528]  Oh, well, let's just take our vaccines.
[02:07:05.789 --> 02:07:09.352]  Oh, well, you know, it's just so much fun.
[02:07:09.873 --> 02:07:10.153]  I want to
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:17.963]  Rifle through your calls as quickly as possible, and then I want to get to some of this news here early in this hour.
[02:07:18.404 --> 02:07:20.865]  But Dean in Canada, you had one more point you wanted to add.
[02:07:20.885 --> 02:07:21.245]  Go ahead.
[02:07:22.586 --> 02:07:33.873]  In addition to, within this 30 seconds if I can ask for that much, in our own laws, our Bill of Rights of the 1960s states, quote, the Canadian nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God.
[02:07:34.173 --> 02:07:36.555]  This is the Christian God, capital G on the God.
[02:07:37.075 --> 02:07:40.958]  And with all the rest of the stuff I've given to the Senate and to the official opposition,
[02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:54.935]  Once the undecideds in Parliament get a hold of it, all 50 of them, hopefully it'll swing the vote to deny the agenda their goal at assaulting the rights and liberties that we've long held, long since before Canada was a nation.
[02:07:55.496 --> 02:07:56.336]  That's pretty much everything.
[02:07:56.996 --> 02:07:57.836]  I hope I was on time.
[02:07:58.176 --> 02:07:59.357]  Oh yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:07:59.397 --> 02:08:00.077]  I appreciate it.
[02:08:00.097 --> 02:08:02.198]  And I would just add this to it.
[02:08:03.458 --> 02:08:11.321]  Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled, but to be technical, nine days ago, the Supreme Court ruled
[02:08:12.702 --> 02:08:13.963]  That there is no Fourth Amendment.
[02:08:14.023 --> 02:08:18.226]  That they don't even need probable cause to set up checkpoints and have drug dogs look for drugs.
[02:08:18.606 --> 02:08:20.387]  It's not even the claim of, oh, it's to stop terrorists.
[02:08:20.447 --> 02:08:21.348]  It's to look for drugs.
[02:08:23.049 --> 02:08:28.212]  Well, I mean, the Supreme Court can say, as I've said a hundred times, that black people aren't human beings, as they've said before.
[02:08:28.552 --> 02:08:30.313]  It doesn't make it binding.
[02:08:30.353 --> 02:08:31.534]  It doesn't make it legitimate.
[02:08:31.554 --> 02:08:32.775]  It doesn't mean we have to follow it.
[02:08:34.699 --> 02:08:43.605]  The problem is, is the government's hired its own enforcers that don't know the Bill of Rights or Constitution, that don't know they're violating the big official law through these little petty regulations.
[02:08:45.127 --> 02:08:52.212]  It's like if the Supreme Court says that, as they said in the past, that Indians aren't human beings, Native Americans, we can take their land and kill them.
[02:08:53.993 --> 02:08:59.957]  Does government really have a right to arbitrarily just kill people and enslave and torture and say it's not torture?
[02:09:00.297 --> 02:09:01.638]  Who is government god?
[02:09:02.619 --> 02:09:03.580]  If you were teleported
[02:09:04.621 --> 02:09:17.786]  Back to the Aztec Kingdom, Chichen Itza, 2,000 years ago, or 1,400 years ago, and they seized you up and took you to the altar to cut your heart out, would you have a right to run?
[02:09:17.846 --> 02:09:19.007]  Would you have a right to struggle?
[02:09:19.047 --> 02:09:22.248]  Or if they yelled out at you, you know, we are the government!
[02:09:22.308 --> 02:09:23.809]  We are God!
[02:09:24.269 --> 02:09:26.209]  You know, our priest and our king are God!
[02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:27.090]  You will do it!
[02:09:27.130 --> 02:09:29.931]  Would you suddenly stop and go, okay, you're the government!
[02:09:30.453 --> 02:09:33.036]  And because you're the government, I don't have any basic human rights.
[02:09:33.717 --> 02:09:35.599]  I don't have any basic God-given rights.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.221]  That's what they say.
[02:09:37.241 --> 02:09:39.023]  I mean, they can say there's no Fourth Amendment.
[02:09:39.243 --> 02:09:45.551]  Well, our Founding Fathers and the Declaration of Independence and common sense and the organic law shows that
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:49.182]  We do have a right against unreasonable search and seizure.
[02:09:49.342 --> 02:09:51.543]  That we do have a First Amendment to speak freely.
[02:09:51.703 --> 02:09:53.584]  That we do have a Second Amendment to defend ourselves.
[02:09:53.844 --> 02:09:57.747]  That our states are units and that they have supremacy over the federal government.
[02:09:58.127 --> 02:10:00.528]  But they'll say, well, that got decided in the Civil War, didn't it?
[02:10:00.769 --> 02:10:02.209]  Yeah, at the barrel of a gun.
[02:10:03.110 --> 02:10:04.251]  Well, that was about slavery.
[02:10:04.311 --> 02:10:04.691]  Oh, really?
[02:10:04.931 --> 02:10:07.493]  All the historians admit who've got it worth their soul it wasn't.
[02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:11.555]  I mean, uh... Lincoln said it wasn't about slavery.
[02:10:12.115 --> 02:10:14.977]  The point is, is that we're living in a corrupt empire.
[02:10:15.771 --> 02:10:18.073]  And they're dismantling what America is in front of us.
[02:10:18.354 --> 02:10:22.838]  America isn't America anymore if these freedoms aren't codified.
[02:10:24.299 --> 02:10:30.585]  So how do we deal with this tyranny when the cops pull you over and go, I don't need a warrant anymore, I'm gonna search all your cars.
[02:10:30.625 --> 02:10:31.907]  You go, but this is America!
[02:10:31.927 --> 02:10:33.929]  And they go, Supreme Court said so!
[02:10:36.151 --> 02:10:38.293]  Well, you sue them and you challenge them and
[02:10:40.023 --> 02:10:43.925]  You boycott and you demonstrate and you and officers need to go public.
[02:10:43.965 --> 02:10:45.325]  And so what if you lose your job?
[02:10:45.546 --> 02:10:48.467]  This is America and our country and your children's future.
[02:10:48.767 --> 02:10:51.528]  The problem with tyranny is, folks, it doesn't just stay at one point.
[02:10:51.808 --> 02:10:55.930]  If you let tyranny sit in place, it grows, it gets bigger.
[02:10:56.230 --> 02:10:58.691]  It has a gravitational political pull.
[02:10:58.972 --> 02:11:00.592]  A political gravitational force.
[02:11:01.813 --> 02:11:04.374]  And it's a slide downwards.
[02:11:05.554 --> 02:11:07.936]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Oklahoma.
[02:11:07.976 --> 02:11:08.736]  Jeremy, go ahead.
[02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:12.143]  Oh, Alex, it's getting worse.
[02:11:12.443 --> 02:11:13.043]  Worse, worse.
[02:11:13.143 --> 02:11:13.623]  What do we do?
[02:11:13.663 --> 02:11:14.183]  What do we do?
[02:11:14.563 --> 02:11:15.623]  Well, we keep moving forward.
[02:11:15.643 --> 02:11:16.724]  We keep waking people up.
[02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:17.784]  We keep getting involved.
[02:11:19.425 --> 02:11:22.525]  You know, I see things.
[02:11:22.725 --> 02:11:29.327]  People getting woken up and then they kind of reverse back to they want to go back to sleep and not face it.
[02:11:29.347 --> 02:11:30.487]  So they're kind of on the fence.
[02:11:30.688 --> 02:11:34.969]  Well, you know, I don't let how other people feel around me affect me or how they operate.
[02:11:36.009 --> 02:11:38.930]  I'm in control of myself, at least to a large extent.
[02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.510]  I try to be.
[02:11:40.487 --> 02:11:42.768]  And, you know, it's like in a football game.
[02:11:43.548 --> 02:11:45.749]  I mean, we're 50-50 right now.
[02:11:45.809 --> 02:11:47.090]  It's sudden death overtime.
[02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:51.732]  And I don't focus on drooling masses that are idiot slaves.
[02:11:52.272 --> 02:11:57.614]  I focus on the fact that if we weren't here doing what we're doing right now, things would already be a lot worse.
[02:11:58.574 --> 02:12:04.116]  What do you think about those political talk show hosts who claim that America is not divided?
[02:12:04.156 --> 02:12:05.077]  How can they say that?
[02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:07.798]  I mean, anybody with open eyes would see that it is.
[02:12:09.884 --> 02:12:27.599]  Well, I mean, again, these neocons are for big government, for destroying our freedoms, and they're just there to pacify conservatives long enough to get the New World Order in, and then conservatives are going to find out it was all meant for you, it was all meant for Christians, and they're buying off our religious leaders, they're paying off.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.020]  I mean, it's called tyranny!
[02:12:30.427 --> 02:12:31.048]  Gotta stop it.
[02:12:31.328 --> 02:12:34.430]  Anything else on your mind?
[02:12:35.231 --> 02:12:37.633]  I do as best as I can in my local neighborhood.
[02:12:37.793 --> 02:12:40.295]  Well, don't let them grind you down.
[02:12:40.355 --> 02:12:41.056]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:41.776 --> 02:12:42.837]  Look, I mean, we're here.
[02:12:42.897 --> 02:12:43.578]  We're alive.
[02:12:44.058 --> 02:12:46.060]  While we're on this planet.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:48.582]  In the scope of our lifetimes.
[02:12:48.642 --> 02:12:50.504]  In the span.
[02:12:53.386 --> 02:12:55.388]  It's only good to fight these people.
[02:12:55.528 --> 02:12:56.108]  Regardless.
[02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:57.069]  Duty is mine.
[02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:58.150]  Consequences belong to God.
[02:12:58.795 --> 02:13:01.337]  I mean, I'm not going to lick the boots of these scumbags.
[02:13:02.198 --> 02:13:02.758]  It's that simple.
[02:13:03.199 --> 02:13:05.160]  And look, they're failing in many things they do.
[02:13:06.021 --> 02:13:06.642]  They're failing.
[02:13:07.162 --> 02:13:08.203]  They're not winning, folks.
[02:13:08.223 --> 02:13:12.627]  They may be putting in the grid, but people are not complying and it's falling apart.
[02:13:14.488 --> 02:13:18.511]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to David in California.
[02:13:18.531 --> 02:13:19.132]  David, go ahead.
[02:13:19.833 --> 02:13:21.714]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:27.296]  I wanted to talk a little bit about the Constitution so that you've brought this up.
[02:13:27.396 --> 02:13:30.598]  I've actually brought this up on your show on a few occasions before.
[02:13:32.158 --> 02:13:40.182]  But I think it's very important for the American people to know that they aren't under constitutional law at present.
[02:13:41.112 --> 02:13:48.618]  We know that the Banking Act, the Trading with the Enemies Act, and Roosevelt's Declaration of March 9, 1933.
[02:13:49.078 --> 02:13:52.600]  And they're now citing that act with much of what they're doing.
[02:13:52.661 --> 02:13:53.841]  It's admiralty courts.
[02:13:54.162 --> 02:13:54.442]  Correct.
[02:13:54.482 --> 02:13:57.604]  And the general public knows these as administrative law courts.
[02:13:57.784 --> 02:13:58.125]  Correct.
[02:13:58.325 --> 02:14:00.186]  Commercial courts is what they really amount to.
[02:14:02.037 --> 02:14:04.258]  And this has to do with people's straw men.
[02:14:05.018 --> 02:14:08.120]  And they're all capitalized letter names.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:08.980]  But here's the problem.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.240]  There is the corporate fiction.
[02:14:10.561 --> 02:14:12.641]  There is the contract fraud being engaged in.
[02:14:12.681 --> 02:14:20.485]  The most simple example, when you go in to get a bank account, they go sign this form, and the form just waives your right so the IRS can grab your bank account without a trial.
[02:14:20.705 --> 02:14:21.665]  You wonder how they do that.
[02:14:21.705 --> 02:14:22.665]  You sign the contract.
[02:14:23.106 --> 02:14:24.026]  But here's the problem.
[02:14:24.346 --> 02:14:28.388]  Now these courts have gotten so established that they don't even care if you try to
[02:14:29.088 --> 02:14:30.309]  That's very correct.
[02:14:30.329 --> 02:14:34.974]  However, with any law, there has to be a recourse and a remedy, a way out of the law.
[02:14:35.574 --> 02:14:37.016]  And in the Uniform Commercial Code,
[02:14:47.532 --> 02:14:49.433]  We know the way out of the law.
[02:14:49.533 --> 02:15:03.482]  It is true that the corporations that run our government, that are not free market, that are criminal syndicates, have put back doors in for themselves, but they are only authorized to use those so they can operate outside the system while using all of its restraints on us.
[02:15:03.782 --> 02:15:15.809]  Well, that's true to a certain extent, but keep in mind, because you are a corporate fiction, you do have the right to use the commercial law that was established by the bankers and by
[02:15:16.894 --> 02:15:27.741]  For example, this is how many in the Patriot Movement are able to recuse themselves of paying any federal income tax, or state taxes, or property taxes.
[02:15:27.761 --> 02:15:34.846]  And for many it works, but still, when they wish, they will selectively enforce, regardless of what the code actually shows, and imprison you.
[02:15:35.306 --> 02:15:42.431]  Well, but then again, that may be true to a certain extent, but keep in mind, once you've taken yourself out of the system,
[02:15:43.092 --> 02:15:45.374]  You and avail yourself to the common law.
[02:15:45.494 --> 02:15:51.918]  Anybody that acts outside of the common law towards harming you can now be sued.
[02:15:52.038 --> 02:15:55.261]  Okay, and then you go to the court and they kangaroo it?
[02:15:55.661 --> 02:16:06.509]  Well, not specifically because a lot of times the way this works is that you don't... You know, I've heard everybody talk about this and I watch people do it a few times and most of them end up going to jail.
[02:16:07.029 --> 02:16:09.391]  Well, that may be... I know, they're not doing it right.
[02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:13.573]  They don't know the exact alchemy to make the tyrants listen.
[02:16:13.854 --> 02:16:14.174]  That's correct.
[02:16:14.234 --> 02:16:18.597]  And the exact skeleton key that just magically makes the doors all swing back open.
[02:16:18.877 --> 02:16:20.738]  Well, to a certain extent that's true.
[02:16:20.818 --> 02:16:24.261]  In other words, the way a lot of... Not really.
[02:16:24.301 --> 02:16:25.822]  How many court cases you won against them?
[02:16:26.282 --> 02:16:27.923]  I mean, stuff above traffic court.
[02:16:28.690 --> 02:16:29.731]  Uh, actually none.
[02:16:29.771 --> 02:16:30.792]  I've never been charged.
[02:16:31.032 --> 02:16:33.114]  Yeah, well, I've interviewed hundreds.
[02:16:33.134 --> 02:16:38.177]  I mean, years ago I focused on this almost exclusively for a year or so, really studying, and I did hundreds of guests.
[02:16:38.618 --> 02:16:41.019]  Believe me, sir, it's better to know the things you know.
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:48.125]  It's better to... Law is just a constantly growing fiction, and there's a hundred different facets and different avenues and ways to do it.
[02:16:48.872 --> 02:16:51.994]  I mean, really, the best way to do it is to hire the lawyer that plays golf with the judge.
[02:16:52.235 --> 02:16:53.976]  That's the most powerful trick there is.
[02:16:54.156 --> 02:16:56.598]  And you're right, the tricks you've got are good and all.
[02:16:56.878 --> 02:17:07.086]  I say we fall back on the Constitution, and the biggest thing is juries, getting back to real juries, and then having an informed public that judges the facts as well as the case.
[02:17:07.286 --> 02:17:13.331]  Well, keep in mind that juries nowadays are, if you will,
[02:17:14.235 --> 02:17:14.936]  Rubber stamps.
[02:17:15.076 --> 02:17:17.498]  Rubber stamps for the commercial court.
[02:17:17.718 --> 02:17:18.138]  I understand.
[02:17:18.178 --> 02:17:19.039]  Listen, interesting points.
[02:17:19.079 --> 02:17:19.880]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[02:17:21.321 --> 02:17:23.342]  Maybe I should do some broadcast on the subject again.
[02:17:23.382 --> 02:17:27.326]  I'm actually somewhat learned on the subject, if I can say so myself.
[02:17:28.246 --> 02:17:34.912]  But we'll go ahead and go to break, and we will come back and talk to Tim and Ryan, and then I'm plunging.
[02:17:35.152 --> 02:17:36.213]  Plunging, that is!
[02:17:37.824 --> 02:17:51.534]  Hey, I'll tell ya, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigar's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[02:17:51.594 --> 02:17:53.295]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigar.
[02:17:53.535 --> 02:17:55.417]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[02:17:55.437 --> 02:17:57.478]  That took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[02:17:57.778 --> 02:18:01.541]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[02:18:01.601 --> 02:18:04.744]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[02:18:05.854 --> 02:18:09.975]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[02:18:10.295 --> 02:18:13.716]  Well that's great, and just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[02:18:13.796 --> 02:18:13.996]  Right.
[02:18:14.016 --> 02:18:18.917]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants, it's more that because you've lost weight you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[02:18:19.117 --> 02:18:19.517]  Absolutely.
[02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:24.999]  I'm sleeping better, I feel better during the day, I don't get as tired in the afternoons, and I'm able to do a lot more.
[02:18:25.119 --> 02:18:29.800]  Collagenate is safe, it's natural, it's healthy, and it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.

[02:18:47.604 --> 02:18:52.189]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.529 --> 02:18:54.852]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:18:55.092 --> 02:18:56.613]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:18:56.994 --> 02:19:02.079]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:03.621]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:19:03.681 --> 02:19:06.384]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:19:14.109 --> 02:19:17.772]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[02:19:45.732 --> 02:19:48.214]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.234 --> 02:19:51.677]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:19:51.817 --> 02:19:57.502]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:58.463 --> 02:20:03.407]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:20:04.488 --> 02:20:06.290]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:06.690 --> 02:20:07.491]  There may be more.
[02:20:08.656 --> 02:20:15.462]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:20:16.142 --> 02:20:24.009]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.829 --> 02:20:26.390]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:38.869 --> 02:20:39.449]  Call now.

[02:20:45.071 --> 02:20:53.695]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:20:53.915 --> 02:21:05.159]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:21:05.399 --> 02:21:08.061]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:08.381 --> 02:21:14.845]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:21:15.006 --> 02:21:16.887]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:21:17.087 --> 02:21:23.111]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:21:23.351 --> 02:21:29.015]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:21:29.335 --> 02:21:33.256]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:33.296 --> 02:21:33.996]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:21:34.016 --> 02:21:34.717]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:21:58.749 --> 02:22:04.514]  Yes, called by some the Commodore of Conspiracy, my friends, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[02:22:05.855 --> 02:22:10.899]  I simply study the world around me and what the facts are, not what the rhetoric is.
[02:22:11.039 --> 02:22:21.347]  That's what I attempt to do and I've been educated by all the great folks out there listening over the years and my own studies and we know what we're facing, a criminal crime syndicate absolutely out of control.
[02:22:22.661 --> 02:22:24.783]  Let us now talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:22:24.883 --> 02:22:25.483]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:22:25.503 --> 02:22:26.084]  You're on the air.
[02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:26.904]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:28.466]  Welcome.
[02:22:28.746 --> 02:22:31.148]  The last call, you were talking about the banks and things like that.
[02:22:31.168 --> 02:22:33.529]  Here's something interesting that everyone could do.
[02:22:33.569 --> 02:22:39.233]  Did you ever take like an 8 to 10 power jeweler's loop and look at the signature line on your checkbook?
[02:22:41.315 --> 02:22:43.817]  Well, a lot of them are full of different data numbers.
[02:22:43.957 --> 02:22:45.438]  Yeah, there's numbers and there's words.
[02:22:45.498 --> 02:22:46.679]  It's not really a line at all.
[02:22:46.739 --> 02:22:50.762]  And most of them are giving the bank authorization to go into your account.
[02:22:52.013 --> 02:22:53.395]  But, you know, they don't tell you about it.
[02:22:53.415 --> 02:22:55.256]  It would be interesting for everyone to just call up.
[02:22:55.276 --> 02:22:57.078]  Well, go read the bank contract.
[02:22:57.098 --> 02:23:02.523]  You know, the four-page thing you sign when you're in a hurry while you're, you know, kids running around in the bank lobby.
[02:23:02.923 --> 02:23:03.704]  Right.
[02:23:03.744 --> 02:23:05.466]  You know, about to pull down the coffee maker.
[02:23:06.046 --> 02:23:15.054]  And we're all busy, and they just, look, it's a bunch of con artist charlatans that 200, 300 years ago were riding around on wagons scamming people from down to town.
[02:23:15.435 --> 02:23:16.435]  Now they run our government.
[02:23:16.776 --> 02:23:16.936]  Right.
[02:23:17.638 --> 02:23:22.079]  Friday night, George, you were talking about MEPA, the Model States Emergency Health Powers Act.
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:22.680]  Yes.
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:29.402]  And, you know, you talked about if you refuse the vaccination, you'll be arrested, or if you resist, you'll be shot.
[02:23:29.902 --> 02:23:36.644]  There's another thing in there that people should be very aware of that has to do with land patent versus warranty deeds and the ownership of your property.
[02:23:36.924 --> 02:23:41.625]  The governor can come and take your house and say he needs it for a hospital under that legislation.
[02:23:41.645 --> 02:23:44.266]  Well, under the executive orders, they can take everything.
[02:23:44.306 --> 02:23:46.307]  And, you know, the Supreme Court's always ruled that
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:58.064]  They can take your land if it can be shown, you know, if it's for right-of-way or something of great import, but they have to pay you just compensation at best use.
[02:23:58.784 --> 02:24:02.445]  That is for the full potential of what you could sell it for in the next decade.
[02:24:02.925 --> 02:24:04.606]  They don't even give people best use.
[02:24:04.626 --> 02:24:06.727]  They don't even give them fair market value.
[02:24:07.847 --> 02:24:11.928]  Now the Supreme Court has ruled, what, three years ago, no more just compensation.
[02:24:12.108 --> 02:24:13.089]  I mean, that's insane!
[02:24:14.109 --> 02:24:14.829]  Right.
[02:24:14.849 --> 02:24:16.290]  So, you know what, cops out there,
[02:24:16.954 --> 02:24:22.858]  You know, your grandma dies, you get a little 40-acre, 50-acre spread, and you're real proud of it.
[02:24:22.878 --> 02:24:24.899]  This happens, I mean, every day I learn of this.
[02:24:24.939 --> 02:24:25.840]  But just talk to the cops.
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:29.222]  You like running a checkpoint on us, violating the Fourth Amendment?
[02:24:29.582 --> 02:24:30.043]  Fine!
[02:24:30.483 --> 02:24:33.065]  The Supreme Court said you don't own that land, they don't have to pay you for it.
[02:24:33.345 --> 02:24:34.646]  How about when they take your land?
[02:24:34.886 --> 02:24:38.608]  Don't call me squealing like a pig, caught in a bear trap.
[02:24:40.583 --> 02:24:43.064]  And I'm not calling you a pig because, you know, cops pigs.
[02:24:43.124 --> 02:24:48.445]  No, I mean, you know, a pig-like creature that piggishly attacked the Bill of Rights and then it happened to you.
[02:24:48.485 --> 02:24:48.826]  Go ahead.
[02:24:49.026 --> 02:24:49.786]  And not a Camara.
[02:24:50.706 --> 02:24:53.947]  We know who controls the courts and most judges are Mason.
[02:24:56.208 --> 02:25:00.669]  The Tavistock Institute, how is that trickling down and affecting any of this?
[02:25:00.709 --> 02:25:03.990]  Because I know a lot of these people are connected with the Tavistock Institute.
[02:25:04.610 --> 02:25:09.552]  Well, there are a score of marquee, top-of-the-line, grade-A
[02:25:10.782 --> 02:25:10.865]  Um...
[02:25:12.657 --> 02:25:41.421]  psychological warfare centers that where they have behaviorists and psychiatrists and sociologists doing billion-dollar programs of testing human response and crafting already instinctive forms of propaganda used by propagandists and dictators throughout history and then they've just scientifically crafted it down to how the TV set flickers to you know what color lipstick the Infobabe wears down to just every crafted
[02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:45.983]  nuance of it, and that's what Tavistock and folks like that do.
[02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:49.265]  They're cruel, and they're unusual.
[02:25:51.086 --> 02:25:56.048]  But, being aware of it, being aware of the trap is half the battle.
[02:25:56.329 --> 02:26:08.615]  Being conscious of the propaganda basically doesn't make you immune to it, because you still become conditioned to accept it, even if you're conscious of it, but it frees you from much of it.
[02:26:09.451 --> 02:26:11.292]  Well, I'm proud to call myself an Info Warrior.
[02:26:11.353 --> 02:26:12.553]  I'm out there fighting the fight right with you.
[02:26:12.574 --> 02:26:13.354]  Good to have you on board.
[02:26:13.394 --> 02:26:14.875]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:14.975 --> 02:26:16.036]  Ryan in Ohio.
[02:26:16.116 --> 02:26:17.017]  Ryan, go ahead.
[02:26:17.037 --> 02:26:20.300]  Ryan, good to hear from you today.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:21.381]  Yeah, it's good to hear from you too.
[02:26:21.961 --> 02:26:24.063]  Hey, I was going to get your opinion.
[02:26:24.103 --> 02:26:26.605]  I got pulled over for a traffic citation.
[02:26:27.585 --> 02:26:33.570]  And I had my knife, it's a hunting knife, slash fishing knife, on the dashboards.
[02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:37.013]  They arrested me for having a knife more than two and a half inches in length.
[02:26:37.668 --> 02:26:38.769]  Is this constitutional?
[02:26:39.189 --> 02:26:41.350]  Well, I mean, in Texas it's four inches.
[02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.951]  And no, it's not.
[02:26:42.991 --> 02:26:59.159]  I mean, I know World War II vets, you know, good old boys, with a postcard from George Bush to them on the wall, who have been convicted of felonies and gone on six years of probation for driving back from the coast with a whole bucket of fish!
[02:27:00.324 --> 02:27:01.906]  Uh, you want to search the car, officer?
[02:27:02.026 --> 02:27:03.106]  Sure, go ahead!
[02:27:03.727 --> 02:27:04.808]  How you doing, officer?
[02:27:05.728 --> 02:27:07.109]  And then go ahead and find the knife.
[02:27:07.149 --> 02:27:08.611]  You're not going to take me in for that!
[02:27:08.631 --> 02:27:09.911]  That's my fishing tag!
[02:27:09.992 --> 02:27:10.912]  I've got fishing!
[02:27:11.673 --> 02:27:12.774]  Just get up against the car.
[02:27:12.994 --> 02:27:13.474]  Shut up!
[02:27:13.754 --> 02:27:14.655]  What would you do if you got arrested?
[02:27:14.675 --> 02:27:15.416]  This is America!
[02:27:15.636 --> 02:27:18.138]  What are you doing to me?
[02:27:18.858 --> 02:27:19.659]  Well, just stay there.
[02:27:19.859 --> 02:27:21.360]  I mean, this is America, buddy.
[02:27:22.261 --> 02:27:22.821]  I mean, look.
[02:27:23.241 --> 02:27:25.403]  Your child doesn't finish their homework, they get arrested.
[02:27:26.215 --> 02:27:28.256]  I mean, it's all about getting us into the system.
[02:27:28.776 --> 02:27:31.118]  Can't get you on welfare, they'll get you in the psychiatric system.
[02:27:31.678 --> 02:27:33.239]  Can't do that, they'll get you in the criminal system.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:36.881]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.361 --> 02:27:38.962]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.882 --> 02:27:42.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.593 --> 02:27:48.094]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.274 --> 02:27:55.619]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.939 --> 02:28:00.342]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.622 --> 02:28:10.448]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.208 --> 02:28:14.871]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.211 --> 02:28:17.693]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:17.713 --> 02:28:23.917]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.178 --> 02:28:25.799]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:25.999 --> 02:28:26.879]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:26.979 --> 02:28:28.961]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds
[02:28:29.201 --> 02:28:29.962]  Every year.
[02:28:30.103 --> 02:28:33.268]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:33.969 --> 02:28:35.952]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:28:36.733 --> 02:28:40.800]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:41.842]  It's powerful stuff.

[02:29:47.859 --> 02:29:53.341]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.761 --> 02:29:58.002]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.222 --> 02:30:05.264]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.644 --> 02:30:11.766]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.886 --> 02:30:13.106]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:44.554 --> 02:30:54.518]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.898 --> 02:30:58.059]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.572 --> 02:31:02.474]  You know, Ryan, I wanted you to hold over.
[02:31:02.494 --> 02:31:05.437]  If there's a line open, try to call back in 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:05.457 --> 02:31:11.983]  I mean, I wanted to find out the actual story of what happened to you.
[02:31:12.784 --> 02:31:16.287]  I know you were trying to tell it when I dove into people I know that have had similar problems.
[02:31:16.908 --> 02:31:18.529]  But, I mean, I know multiple people.
[02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:25.036]  I know one guy who's a Vietnam vet, you know, has a little lawn company, no criminal record,
[02:31:25.894 --> 02:31:36.558]  And, uh, you know, they've been out clearing land and doing stuff and part of your tools are lawn mowers and a machete and, uh, weed eaters and a hoe and rakes and all that.
[02:31:36.618 --> 02:31:48.223]  And, uh, he got pulled over with one of his work crews and, uh, the cops saw the machete just laying right in the back and said, I'm going to have to ticket you for this.
[02:31:48.263 --> 02:31:49.063]  And he argued with them.
[02:31:49.103 --> 02:31:51.064]  So they swam him down and took him to jail.
[02:31:51.104 --> 02:31:52.184]  He's like, what?
[02:31:53.244 --> 02:31:53.965]  What do you think I do?
[02:31:54.961 --> 02:32:01.747]  I mean, it'd be like going to a farmer's farm and arresting them for having sheep shears or something.
[02:32:02.388 --> 02:32:08.073]  But I know an old World War II vet who's a listener of the show and still like George Bush.
[02:32:08.553 --> 02:32:11.156]  I had arguments with him two or three years ago about it.
[02:32:12.842 --> 02:32:16.665]  Well, he was coming back from the coast and he had one of those little filet-o-knives.
[02:32:17.186 --> 02:32:24.612]  Did you know you can't walk into a fishing supply store and buy a filet-o-knife that's over four inches in Texas and actually go home with it legally?
[02:32:24.892 --> 02:32:26.353]  You can't even own that legally.
[02:32:27.294 --> 02:32:30.957]  You cannot leave your house with a knife over four inches.
[02:32:31.237 --> 02:32:31.698]  Period.
[02:32:32.278 --> 02:32:32.718]  Period.
[02:32:33.519 --> 02:32:36.962]  And police, this one case is Williamson County,
[02:32:37.702 --> 02:32:39.063]  They do not care, folks.
[02:32:39.103 --> 02:32:52.389]  They got them an old vet with us and with a ice box full of fish and a knife and they know how to go right into that tackle box and they don't care about ruining an old man's life.
[02:32:53.969 --> 02:32:58.211]  And then, you know, he believes in the system, didn't know how to fight it, goes up there and goes ahead.
[02:32:58.231 --> 02:33:00.813]  I don't want to go to jail for two years.
[02:33:01.613 --> 02:33:02.854]  I'll take probation.
[02:33:04.474 --> 02:33:05.855]  No, I guess
[02:33:06.949 --> 02:33:08.750]  I guess I was without credit.
[02:33:09.851 --> 02:33:13.653]  I guess I was paying your right, government!
[02:33:13.713 --> 02:33:15.674]  Take me to jail!
[02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:18.936]  I mean, it's just pathetic!
[02:33:20.136 --> 02:33:21.817]  You guys will put up with anything!
[02:33:23.238 --> 02:33:27.800]  They'll put up with anything, and, um, and I'm sorry to hear this happen to you, Ryan.
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:32.343]  You know, you're caught with a little knife over two inches in your estate, and it's over for you!
[02:33:34.344 --> 02:33:35.204]  It's over for you!
[02:33:35.264 --> 02:33:36.305]  No more Second Amendment?
[02:33:37.168 --> 02:33:38.849]  You know, you're going to be an evil felon now.
[02:33:38.869 --> 02:33:53.875]  You're not going to... And now, they're banning ammo in areas of California and New York and Schwarzenegger's banning rifles left and right and boy, the Republican Party, when you tune in to Lord Limbaugh, oh man, it's conservative.
[02:33:54.015 --> 02:33:56.916]  I just love Schwarzenegger.
[02:33:57.676 --> 02:33:59.337]  I just love him.
[02:34:00.297 --> 02:34:01.418]  No, you don't love your freedoms.
[02:34:03.328 --> 02:34:04.248]  What are you saying?
[02:34:04.328 --> 02:34:05.629]  I should vote for Hillary?
[02:34:05.869 --> 02:34:07.610]  They're all on the same ball team.
[02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:09.370]  They're all owned by the same people.
[02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:14.672]  They may be different horses, but they're owned by the same farm folks.
[02:34:15.892 --> 02:34:17.913]  And they all run for the same master.
[02:34:18.653 --> 02:34:22.995]  They give you the false choices, the illusion of choice, but there's no real choice there.
[02:34:23.275 --> 02:34:24.275]  And so what do we do about it?
[02:34:24.335 --> 02:34:25.076]  That's the question.
[02:34:28.577 --> 02:34:29.077]  It's sick!
[02:34:30.632 --> 02:34:34.174]  I mean, your child writes an essay, they say, write a history story.
[02:34:35.254 --> 02:34:37.375]  Write an article and it mentions knife or gun.
[02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:40.156]  That's what you see in the culture, the TV everywhere.
[02:34:40.716 --> 02:34:44.838]  Do a story about soldiers or about cowboys and Indians.
[02:34:46.159 --> 02:34:47.759]  They call the police on you folks.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:51.121]  Teacher reads the article, next day you show up to school.
[02:34:52.461 --> 02:34:55.803]  And an officer walks in, it's time to induct you into the system.
[02:34:56.263 --> 02:34:58.424]  We're shifting over into an economy of prisons.
[02:34:59.053 --> 02:35:01.074]  And we weave our webs all over the school.
[02:35:01.154 --> 02:35:02.855]  Your parents are dumb enough to put you in here.
[02:35:03.415 --> 02:35:07.136]  And now I'm going to take you in and baptize you into the new world order.
[02:35:07.576 --> 02:35:11.418]  By the time we're done with you, you little 12-year-old, you're going to be on Prozac.
[02:35:12.038 --> 02:35:17.700]  And five years from now, you're going to have tracks up your arms with HIV, living in the penitentiary.
[02:35:19.141 --> 02:35:21.462]  That's the promise the government's got for you.
[02:35:21.802 --> 02:35:23.883]  Training your children how to be institutionalized.
[02:35:24.223 --> 02:35:26.984]  And if your child's smart enough not to write the word gun,
[02:35:28.263 --> 02:35:38.150]  When they're writing an article, or they're smart enough not to... not to, when they're in high school, have a plastic knife in their car that they forgot when they were at... when they were at Dairy Queen.
[02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:41.272]  Or they're smart enough not to do that?
[02:35:41.312 --> 02:35:48.617]  Well, we're just gonna find out that they're a little depressed when they're 12 when they see the government psychiatrist and they're gonna be ordered to go on with drugs.
[02:35:49.377 --> 02:35:50.558]  See, we're gonna get ya!
[02:35:50.998 --> 02:35:51.919]  Cuz we love ya!
[02:35:53.294 --> 02:35:59.619]  So, you old vets, when we catch you with that fishing knife, even when you've got the bucket of fish, you're going down.
[02:36:00.219 --> 02:36:03.001]  Cause the government loves you!
[02:36:03.521 --> 02:36:04.562]  Oh yeah!
[02:36:04.962 --> 02:36:05.823]  Freedom!
[02:36:05.883 --> 02:36:07.664]  Let freedom ring!
[02:36:07.684 --> 02:36:08.825]  It's sick!
[02:36:10.606 --> 02:36:11.087]  It's sick!
[02:36:13.768 --> 02:36:15.109]  And that's how the system works.
[02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:20.073]  And when the cop's daughter goes off to college, then she gets in a bunch of trouble in another state,
[02:36:20.956 --> 02:36:25.639]  They're not going to listen when you call up and go, well, my daughter's... I'm an officer.
[02:36:25.659 --> 02:36:26.480]  They're not going to listen to you.
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:27.400]  They're not going to care.
[02:36:29.262 --> 02:36:31.423]  Well, she ought not have done what she did.
[02:36:31.443 --> 02:36:34.745]  And you're just going to wish and hope.
[02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:42.070]  Wish it all go away when they take your land, when they take your pension fund, when they take everything you've got.
[02:36:43.071 --> 02:36:45.853]  Just remember, you could have done something about it.
[02:36:46.713 --> 02:36:47.994]  Remember, you could have stood up to it.
[02:36:49.091 --> 02:36:51.873]  But, no, it was easier to feel like you were part of the system.
[02:36:51.913 --> 02:36:52.894]  Reflected glory.
[02:36:53.595 --> 02:36:56.357]  Strut around with your eyes bugged out.
[02:36:56.697 --> 02:36:57.718]  Feeling powerful.
[02:36:59.479 --> 02:37:03.262]  And all the yuppies and the people, the trendies, all of you.
[02:37:03.302 --> 02:37:05.283]  You think you've got it all figured out, don't you?
[02:37:05.544 --> 02:37:06.885]  Well, you don't have it figured out.
[02:37:08.045 --> 02:37:08.926]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:37:08.946 --> 02:37:13.049]  We're in a very serious, scary situation.
[02:37:15.271 --> 02:37:16.432]  And how adults
[02:37:17.478 --> 02:37:20.420]  That put their children in schools that are giant webs.
[02:37:21.261 --> 02:37:23.603]  How teachers can work in schools that are webs.
[02:37:23.983 --> 02:37:29.988]  None of this is by accident that IQs, no matter how high they are, the children can't read and write.
[02:37:30.568 --> 02:37:36.232]  That, what is it now, one out of eight children gets into the criminal justice system by the seventh grade.
[02:37:36.252 --> 02:37:40.916]  In some areas, half the children are in it by that age.
[02:37:40.936 --> 02:37:43.198]  I mean, it's all by design.
[02:37:43.618 --> 02:37:45.059]  The drug dealer
[02:37:46.728 --> 02:37:48.909]  Own the predominant private presence.
[02:37:50.390 --> 02:38:08.998]  Drug dealing, murdering criminals, the criminals of the criminals, the most ruthless, the most cunning, the most manipulative, the most sophisticated in these organized global crime families have fought for survival of the fittest like gladiators to be in command right now.
[02:38:09.859 --> 02:38:14.741]  They are the most ruthless, the most sociopathic, the most psychopathic,
[02:38:15.859 --> 02:38:16.879]  They enjoy it.
[02:38:16.939 --> 02:38:18.100]  They are sadistic.
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:24.703]  And you sit there, naive, denying all the evidence that is around you.
[02:38:25.663 --> 02:38:37.748]  All the indicators, all the signatures, all the wavelengths, all the patterns, all the classical forms of mega tyranny is now upon us.
[02:38:37.768 --> 02:38:40.029]  And you just keep hoping it's going to go away.
[02:38:40.269 --> 02:38:42.710]  You just keep hoping it's going to be okay.
[02:38:44.204 --> 02:38:47.606]  The people of Iraq are going to be blessed compared to what America is going to be like.
[02:38:47.846 --> 02:38:49.847]  The high-tech straitjacket.
[02:38:52.188 --> 02:38:53.669]  The total micromanagement.
[02:38:53.769 --> 02:38:55.650]  Cameras on you at all times.
[02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:58.211]  Swiping your ID to buy and sell and do anything.
[02:38:58.691 --> 02:39:00.472]  Everything micromanaged and regulated.
[02:39:00.852 --> 02:39:06.555]  All these controls are going in because the more control goes in, the more terrorism, the more fear, the more control.
[02:39:06.715 --> 02:39:07.656]  It's a straitjacket.
[02:39:07.796 --> 02:39:08.696]  They're tying you down.
[02:39:08.836 --> 02:39:11.157]  So as it gets worse and worse and worse, you can't resist.
[02:39:11.398 --> 02:39:12.198]  You can't struggle.
[02:39:13.897 --> 02:39:17.180]  They lure at you and try to give you the same worldview as they have.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:23.826]  They try to sell you on torture and government abduction of your family so you'll accept it when it's happening to your neighbors.
[02:39:25.508 --> 02:39:28.010]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:39:28.110 --> 02:39:29.712]  They revel in it.
[02:39:33.001 --> 02:39:39.267]  They revel in rending and tearing the social fabric of everything that's decent and honorable.
[02:39:39.287 --> 02:39:40.949]  They are threatened by happiness.
[02:39:41.169 --> 02:39:42.391]  They are threatened by health.
[02:39:42.631 --> 02:39:44.132]  They are threatened by mental health.
[02:39:44.353 --> 02:39:46.014]  They are threatened by strength.
[02:39:46.175 --> 02:39:49.298]  They are threatened by real men and real women.
[02:39:50.399 --> 02:39:52.000]  They're threatened by womanliness.
[02:39:52.181 --> 02:39:53.702]  They're threatened by manliness.
[02:39:53.942 --> 02:39:55.985]  They're threatened by honor.
[02:39:56.810 --> 02:39:58.252]  And wholesomeness.
[02:39:58.533 --> 02:39:59.935]  They're threatened by beauty.
[02:40:00.115 --> 02:40:01.838]  They're threatened by majesty.
[02:40:02.018 --> 02:40:04.041]  They're threatened by productivity.
[02:40:04.221 --> 02:40:11.171]  They're threatened by creativity and ideas and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[02:40:12.313 --> 02:40:13.074]  They hate it!
[02:40:13.829 --> 02:40:20.731]  In their unhappy world, they fly over your city in their helicopters and see you out at the barbecues and laughing and swimming in the swimming pools.
[02:40:20.971 --> 02:40:21.791]  They hate it!
[02:40:22.051 --> 02:40:24.091]  They hate your good-looking families.
[02:40:24.692 --> 02:40:28.432]  They hate you and your little ranch, your little farm, and your happiness.
[02:40:28.632 --> 02:40:30.493]  They want what you've got!
[02:40:30.793 --> 02:40:33.474]  And they're gonna get it, unless you wake up.
[02:40:33.634 --> 02:40:36.754]  I'd like to slap each and every one of you upside your head!
[02:40:37.635 --> 02:40:39.595]  Those of you out there denying what I've been saying.
[02:40:40.538 --> 02:40:47.200]  Those of you that stoop and bow to any form of authority, no matter how immoral or bankrupt!
[02:40:51.321 --> 02:40:55.802]  There's only one course against this tyranny and that's to fight it tooth and nail to the hilt!
[02:40:58.502 --> 02:41:00.803]  Forget the maneuvers, go straight at them!
[02:41:03.644 --> 02:41:04.464]  Engage them!
[02:41:05.064 --> 02:41:06.164]  Engage them everywhere!
[02:41:06.744 --> 02:41:09.265]  Engage them in every level of discourse!
[02:41:10.336 --> 02:41:11.016]  Never stop!
[02:41:11.236 --> 02:41:11.856]  Never surrender!
[02:41:11.896 --> 02:41:13.877]  We're never going to give up exposing 9-11!
[02:41:14.057 --> 02:41:14.797]  We're winning!
[02:41:15.677 --> 02:41:16.598]  We've just begun!
[02:41:17.598 --> 02:41:18.858]  We're never backing down!
[02:41:20.078 --> 02:41:20.919]  We're going 110%!
[02:41:24.199 --> 02:41:25.220]  We don't have a choice!
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:31.341]  I don't want to hear about, look at the size of that thing, oh we can't do anything to it, oh my gosh!
[02:41:32.041 --> 02:41:33.401]  We need to engage it!
[02:41:34.722 --> 02:41:35.522]  Engage it!
[02:41:36.403 --> 02:41:37.324]  Engage it!
[02:41:37.924 --> 02:41:38.705]  Engage it!
[02:41:38.765 --> 02:41:40.086]  We have the moral authority.
[02:41:40.626 --> 02:41:41.967]  We have history on our side.
[02:41:42.327 --> 02:41:43.588]  We have God's help.
[02:41:43.928 --> 02:41:45.149]  And we will win.
[02:41:45.509 --> 02:41:50.813]  If we just take that first step in faith against the New World Order, we will win.
[02:41:50.853 --> 02:41:53.435]  But it's getting dark, and it's getting dark fast.
[02:41:55.376 --> 02:41:56.997]  Number one, get past your fear.
[02:41:57.097 --> 02:42:04.943]  You better fear the New World Order succeeding, because it'll eat every single one of us, psychologically, mentally, physically.
[02:42:05.712 --> 02:42:06.373]  Economically.
[02:42:07.533 --> 02:42:08.334]  It doesn't care.
[02:42:08.354 --> 02:42:09.615]  It abuses its own.
[02:42:10.475 --> 02:42:13.077]  More readily than it abuses those of us that fight it.
[02:42:13.958 --> 02:42:19.021]  Because those that serve the new world order belong to them and they have rules.
[02:42:19.361 --> 02:42:20.522]  And they eat their own.
[02:42:20.842 --> 02:42:22.343]  They crush their own.
[02:42:22.563 --> 02:42:24.965]  They tear their own to shreds for enjoyment.
[02:42:26.078 --> 02:42:28.680]  Because it's a climate of fear and terrorism!
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:29.901]  They are the terrorists!
[02:42:30.161 --> 02:42:31.362]  They are the Nazi Terror!
[02:42:31.582 --> 02:42:32.743]  They are the Red Terror!
[02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.404]  They are the New World Order Terror!
[02:42:34.684 --> 02:42:36.585]  They are the International Banker Terror!
[02:42:36.966 --> 02:42:38.307]  And they must be defeated!
[02:42:38.327 --> 02:42:44.531]  I'm not going to talk about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton falling down.
[02:42:44.551 --> 02:42:45.672]  I mean, who cares?
[02:42:46.012 --> 02:42:48.654]  Who cares what some moron puppet did?
[02:42:50.023 --> 02:42:52.003]  Guantonimo tribunals unconstitutional.
[02:42:52.023 --> 02:42:52.323]  A U.S.
[02:42:52.343 --> 02:42:57.724]  judge ruled today that the Guantonimo military tribunals for terrorism suspects are unconstitutional.
[02:42:58.005 --> 02:42:59.425]  And a setback for the Bush administration.
[02:42:59.485 --> 02:42:59.685]  A U.S.
[02:42:59.725 --> 02:43:04.326]  district judge, Joyce Hens Green, also ruled the prisoners at the U.S.
[02:43:04.386 --> 02:43:08.266]  military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba have constitutional protections under the law.
[02:43:10.727 --> 02:43:14.168]  And then the White House says, well, we don't follow what your court says.
[02:43:14.228 --> 02:43:15.128]  We're above the courts.
[02:43:15.188 --> 02:43:16.068]  We are the law.
[02:43:18.618 --> 02:43:20.739]  Unless it's the courts that install you in office.
[02:43:21.299 --> 02:43:24.442]  Ridge backs national standards for ID cards, UPI.
[02:43:26.223 --> 02:43:30.706]  Outgoing head of Homeland Security Tom Ridge has come out in support of national standards for driver's licenses.
[02:43:30.966 --> 02:43:32.507]  You passed it a month and a half ago!
[02:43:33.928 --> 02:43:36.970]  As proposed in several bills pushed by Republicans in Congress.
[02:43:37.250 --> 02:43:38.871]  You got 11th and they already passed it.
[02:43:40.272 --> 02:43:42.934]  And then see, in case you find out about it, oh now they're telling us.
[02:43:43.734 --> 02:43:44.615]  And then it goes on
[02:43:47.088 --> 02:43:49.669]  Yet more national ID card legislation being passed.
[02:43:49.689 --> 02:43:52.110]  See, they're already going to expand it after they already passed it.
[02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:53.530]  Not content.
[02:43:54.250 --> 02:43:56.871]  Not content with the national ID scheme put into law.
[02:43:57.291 --> 02:43:59.472]  The so-called 9-11 intelligence reform bill.
[02:43:59.512 --> 02:44:06.094]  House Judiciary Chairman James Henson Brenner has introduced a bill that would implement his own private four-well.
[02:44:07.017 --> 02:44:14.881]  The current bill sets up a rule-making commission comprised of the Transportation Department, Homeland Security, State Governors, and State Departments of Motor Vehicles.
[02:44:15.181 --> 02:44:25.866]  The commission will draw up rules for turning driver's licenses into de facto national ID cards over the next nine, now eight months, and finalize them for the next year and a half.
[02:44:26.286 --> 02:44:30.508]  Simpson-Brenner would throw all out, but sets up some rules himself.
[02:44:31.235 --> 02:44:36.356]  And give the Homeland Security Secretary the ability to unilaterally upgrade the design requirements.
[02:44:36.716 --> 02:44:44.318]  So if the devilish Chertoff wakes up one morning and decides national security requires we all be fingerprinted and retina scanned, that will be in the new law.
[02:44:44.338 --> 02:44:45.139]  It already is!
[02:44:45.159 --> 02:44:48.700]  That's part of the biometric identifier that's in the other law.
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:52.360]  Now, though, there's not even consultation with the states, but it's all window dressing.
[02:44:52.901 --> 02:44:54.741]  48 states had this in place years ago.
[02:44:54.761 --> 02:44:56.362]  48 states.
[02:44:56.882 --> 02:44:58.022]  They already have it in place.
[02:44:59.153 --> 02:45:00.595]  The standardization's already done.
[02:45:00.655 --> 02:45:02.257]  It's already hooked into the NCIC.
[02:45:02.477 --> 02:45:03.398]  It's already there!
[02:45:06.082 --> 02:45:11.729]  What's in the new bill is control of having to have it for a job and all these private databases hooked into it.
[02:45:14.252 --> 02:45:18.077]  The other part of the bill requires states to join the American Association of Motor Vehicles.
[02:45:18.835 --> 02:45:28.299]  Administrators, Driver's License Agreement, which integrates state driver's license databases with those of Canada's and Mexico's, setting up the Tri-National ID Card!
[02:45:28.339 --> 02:45:31.661]  And we just signed deals with England, Germany, France, and a dozen other countries.
[02:45:32.101 --> 02:45:33.141]  It's like 18 different countries.
[02:45:33.501 --> 02:45:35.602]  And Reg called two weeks ago while in England.
[02:45:35.922 --> 02:45:40.284]  One day it was tortures good, and then on the next day is we need World ID Card.
[02:45:40.604 --> 02:45:41.645]  There it is!
[02:45:43.075 --> 02:45:44.516]  Just like the Euro.
[02:45:44.576 --> 02:45:47.418]  They weren't told we're getting rid of your sovereignty in Germany and France and England.
[02:45:47.718 --> 02:45:49.199]  They just said, oh, it's a trade deal.
[02:45:49.299 --> 02:45:52.160]  Oh, one day, hey, by the way, you don't have any voting rights anymore.
[02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:52.901]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:45:54.882 --> 02:45:59.425]  And these poor, stupid yuppies, they'll tell you, there's no Pan-American Union.
[02:46:00.185 --> 02:46:03.347]  Or paying Social Security to people in Mexico and 30 other countries.
[02:46:03.967 --> 02:46:04.868]  They're merging the laws.
[02:46:04.888 --> 02:46:07.709]  Here, I got a video of them on C-SPAN saying, ah, whatever, kook.
[02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:10.231]  Tell me about the black helicopters.
[02:46:11.692 --> 02:46:12.092]  Yeah.
[02:46:15.058 --> 02:46:16.859]  Yeah, I'm part of the system!
[02:46:17.899 --> 02:46:18.760]  Yeah, okay.
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:23.942]  I remember computer programmers five, six years ago when the blue-collared folks were all losing their jobs.
[02:46:24.242 --> 02:46:33.287]  There was a time in this country where if you were a hard-working carpenter, or a hard-working roofer, or a hard-working plumber, you could have a nice, you know, four-bedroom house.
[02:46:33.687 --> 02:46:39.290]  Your wife could stay home, go on a few vacations a year, supplement your children going to college, have a pool in the backyard.
[02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:40.050]  Man,
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:41.681]  That's all gone.
[02:46:41.721 --> 02:46:44.804]  These people are living in one-room apartments, you know, with their kids.
[02:46:45.824 --> 02:46:49.428]  No future, no nothing.
[02:46:50.569 --> 02:46:51.649]  All the illegal aliens.
[02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:53.211]  And then I watch the computer people.
[02:46:53.231 --> 02:46:55.493]  Ah, whatever, that's just part of globalism.
[02:46:55.753 --> 02:46:57.995]  Well, you've all lost your jobs now, too.
[02:46:58.435 --> 02:47:02.479]  And they say the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times greater in the next three years.
[02:47:03.152 --> 02:47:10.114]  And so just keep telling me how globalism is great, just keep telling me how you're part of the system, just keep telling me, and then go try to get a job roofing houses and see what happens.
[02:47:10.594 --> 02:47:13.315]  There's nothing to even fall back on in the service industry.
[02:47:15.496 --> 02:47:16.276]  It's imploding.
[02:47:17.396 --> 02:47:20.637]  And I'm sorry not to give you the bad news, but we can do something about it.
[02:47:21.017 --> 02:47:26.939]  Yes, we've got cancer, it's barely operable, but if we take action now, we can get rid of it.
[02:47:27.822 --> 02:47:29.343]  I don't have cancer!
[02:47:29.363 --> 02:47:32.565]  I don't... Well, you can't even get out of bed, America!
[02:47:33.326 --> 02:47:35.728]  We're so sick, we're basically in a coma right now!
[02:47:36.868 --> 02:47:37.409]  Wake up!
[02:47:37.809 --> 02:47:38.209]  Get up!
[02:47:38.269 --> 02:47:39.170]  Do something about it!
[02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:41.011]  Instead of going, yeah!
[02:47:41.412 --> 02:47:43.133]  I'm part of the system!
[02:47:43.753 --> 02:47:45.014]  And you know who you are out there!
[02:47:45.675 --> 02:47:48.977]  You just think if you grovel and lick boots long enough, you're gonna be okay.
[02:47:49.177 --> 02:47:50.978]  Well, you're not gonna be okay!
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:54.681]  Tell him I'm in a bad mood.
[02:47:56.715 --> 02:48:03.037]  It just made me mad hearing about that guy, you know, little bitty three or four inch knife gets pulled over and they take him to jail for it.
[02:48:03.097 --> 02:48:07.598]  I mean, just... Folks, they know to go right for the tackle box, okay?
[02:48:07.618 --> 02:48:08.959]  They see fishing poles in a tackle box.
[02:48:09.299 --> 02:48:12.840]  If it's a sicko cop, which more and more of them are, they tell them zero tolerance.
[02:48:13.573 --> 02:48:14.974]  Officers could be stabbed by these.
[02:48:15.434 --> 02:48:17.755]  And even if it's people that didn't mean bad, we gotta enforce it.
[02:48:18.055 --> 02:48:18.655]  It's the law!
[02:48:18.695 --> 02:48:19.716]  Do you understand, men?
[02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:20.896]  Get out there and enforce it!
[02:48:21.116 --> 02:48:21.677]  Yes, sir!
[02:48:21.757 --> 02:48:22.417]  Heil Hitler!
[02:48:22.777 --> 02:48:23.457]  Heil Hitler!
[02:48:23.738 --> 02:48:27.099]  Let's put the old men in jail for knives in their tackle boxes!
[02:48:27.439 --> 02:48:28.139]  Heil Hitler!
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.140]  Heil Hitler!
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:31.241]  Whatever you say, government, you're above the law!
[02:48:31.481 --> 02:48:32.281]  You are the law!
[02:48:32.581 --> 02:48:34.702]  I swear allegiance to Adolf Bush!
[02:48:35.042 --> 02:48:35.803]  Heil Bush!
[02:48:36.023 --> 02:48:36.763]  Heil Bush!
[02:48:36.923 --> 02:48:40.745]  And heil, heil his little kraut Nazi buddy, Schwarzenegger!
[02:48:40.925 --> 02:48:42.026]  He'll be our new president!
[02:48:42.046 --> 02:48:42.766]  We love him!
[02:48:45.856 --> 02:48:50.220]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:54.824]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.964 --> 02:48:59.367]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.387 --> 02:49:00.749]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.449 --> 02:49:02.470]  Panama.
[02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:06.752]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.792 --> 02:49:13.737]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.857 --> 02:49:15.918]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.238 --> 02:49:26.744]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.885 --> 02:49:28.846]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:49:29.346 --> 02:49:32.267]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:45.211 --> 02:49:48.232]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.552 --> 02:49:53.473]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.733 --> 02:49:58.074]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.374 --> 02:50:07.296]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.496 --> 02:50:11.117]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.417 --> 02:50:16.460]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:16.741 --> 02:50:23.485]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:23.945 --> 02:50:24.486]  What about you?
[02:50:25.257 --> 02:50:30.599]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:51:31.103 --> 02:51:34.185]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.345 --> 02:51:40.209]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:50.456 --> 02:51:52.337]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.817 --> 02:51:55.658]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.038 --> 02:52:00.759]  We've gotten hundreds of calls in the last few weeks from global shortwave listeners.
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:03.520]  And we've heard it ourselves.
[02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:05.181]  We're over it.
[02:52:05.221 --> 02:52:06.641]  Right when my show starts, this starts.
[02:52:09.202 --> 02:52:09.962]  So I'll do that with it.
[02:52:09.982 --> 02:52:10.682]  Here, let's do it together.
[02:52:11.262 --> 02:52:15.204]  In fact, join in.
[02:52:16.464 --> 02:52:17.324]  To the guy running the show.
[02:52:17.344 --> 02:52:18.445]  Go ahead and get in here with me on air.
[02:52:18.505 --> 02:52:19.245]  Let's both do it together.
[02:52:24.396 --> 02:52:25.997]  But that's not WWCR's fault.
[02:52:26.037 --> 02:52:28.699]  That's some nice globalists out there.
[02:52:29.119 --> 02:52:29.559]  I like it.
[02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:34.842]  I've actually heard it's boosted international audience quite a bit and we appreciate it.
[02:52:37.624 --> 02:52:41.346]  Alright, just having some fun there folks.
[02:52:42.186 --> 02:52:43.287]  Having a little bit of fun.
[02:52:45.481 --> 02:52:46.722]  And now the Alex Jones Show!
[02:52:47.802 --> 02:52:50.783]  Boy, what are you afraid of, Globalist?
[02:52:52.424 --> 02:52:53.504]  I'm just glad that U.S.
[02:52:53.564 --> 02:52:54.385]  students and U.S.
[02:52:54.405 --> 02:52:57.106]  citizens, the majority of them don't believe the First Amendment's good.
[02:52:57.146 --> 02:53:00.007]  I think that's a great sign.
[02:53:00.067 --> 02:53:05.329]  It shows, again, the freedom is going quite nicely.
[02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:09.711]  And I think we should just really expand all of the freedom, too.
[02:53:10.551 --> 02:53:11.311]  Britain, U.S.
[02:53:11.371 --> 02:53:15.033]  must avert climate catastrophe.
[02:53:16.221 --> 02:53:28.023]  Britain, arguing that climate change is now unstoppable, urged the United States on Tuesday to sign up to the life-saving cuts in greenhouse gas emissions as environmentalists warned of approaching Armageddon.
[02:53:29.404 --> 02:53:32.904]  Well, no doubt the Earth goes through climate changes.
[02:53:34.625 --> 02:53:43.727]  But there's no doubt that a volcano puts out more greenhouse-causing gases than all of our emissions combined for a whole year.
[02:53:43.887 --> 02:53:45.907]  One volcano is bigger than us for a whole year.
[02:53:46.929 --> 02:53:48.770]  And, uh, just more fear-mongering.
[02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:49.931]  You know, there's no oil.
[02:53:50.011 --> 02:53:50.952]  Gotta give up your rights.
[02:53:50.992 --> 02:53:51.512]  Get more oil.
[02:53:51.752 --> 02:53:52.913]  No fresh water left.
[02:53:52.993 --> 02:53:56.235]  All of Europe's about to die unless we have a bunch of different global taxes.
[02:53:57.196 --> 02:54:00.438]  Just all very, very, uh, interesting.
[02:54:01.699 --> 02:54:03.180]  And we have to ask ourselves, why is that?
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:07.963]  Uh, GM to install ESP and OnStar in all models by 2010.
[02:54:09.004 --> 02:54:10.845]  They already have the plug-ins in all of them.
[02:54:11.165 --> 02:54:12.366]  All cars are gonna have this.
[02:54:12.726 --> 02:54:14.707]  This is how they're gonna satellite, tax, and track you.
[02:54:14.747 --> 02:54:15.648]  It's official, by the way.
[02:54:17.059 --> 02:54:21.082]  GM announced the plan at this weekend's NADA convention and the U.S.
[02:54:21.443 --> 02:54:32.171]  believes it would be the first vehicle manufacturer to make both OnStar Telematics and Electronic Chassis Stability Control features standard across the entire fleet.
[02:54:33.432 --> 02:54:34.853]  It'll be included in all vehicles.
[02:54:35.013 --> 02:54:39.156]  OnStar will by 2007, while Stability Control will be standard by 2010.
[02:54:41.297 --> 02:54:42.917]  Well, I don't care about stability control.
[02:54:42.977 --> 02:54:46.278]  See how they mix in OnStar with something innocuous like stability control?
[02:54:46.858 --> 02:54:48.559]  That's auto industry press release.
[02:54:49.079 --> 02:54:51.080]  The numbers from the tsunami deaths are up by 5,000.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:52.780]  Sad about that.
[02:54:53.380 --> 02:54:55.821]  San Francisco weighs the merits of banning handguns.
[02:54:55.881 --> 02:54:56.661]  More gun grabbing.
[02:54:56.681 --> 02:54:58.641]  Of course, the governor could block that.
[02:54:58.681 --> 02:55:00.462]  It's federal and state laws.
[02:55:00.482 --> 02:55:03.083]  You can't do that, but they're still trying to go ahead with it.
[02:55:03.183 --> 02:55:04.963]  Arnold loves it, of course.
[02:55:05.583 --> 02:55:08.204]  I'm flat out of time here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:09.403 --> 02:55:18.707]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the Global Shortwave at 3210 or on your local AM or FM station or the Internet at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
