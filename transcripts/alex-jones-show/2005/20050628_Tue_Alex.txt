[00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:06.416]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:08.136]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:09.937]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:11.437]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:13.037]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:17.399]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:26.281]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:28.742]  It is Tuesday.
[00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.679]  The 28th day of June 2005.
[00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:39.283]  I want to thank everybody that came out to the sixth and final showing of Martial Law.
[00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:44.146]  Overflow crowd, like the other previous five showings.
[00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.686]  Again, it was great seeing you.
[00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:46.467]  Thanks for coming out.
[00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:55.361]  I had three guests on yesterday, so I didn't get to a lot of the other really important news, like all the Supreme Court rulings that came down yesterday.
[00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.142]  I didn't even really get into that yesterday.
[00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.525]  I mentioned it, but I didn't detail it, so I do want to spend some time on that.
[00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:12.272]  Also, new developments with the ruling of last Thursday, considering land grabbing and no more private property in this country, and people thought they weren't going to try it
[00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:40.795]  all over the nation with this new ruling emboldening them uh... you were gravely mistaken i've got instances all over the country of this going on one right here in texas and for those that don't think the border is literally a sodom and gomorrah terrorist criminal laden cesspit look at the news today with all these hostages
[00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:48.104]  And on the South Texas border, literally towns, large cities are shutting down.
[00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:49.345]  People are moving out.
[00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:50.505]  They're leaving.
[00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:53.967]  Even the illegal aliens, in many cases, are going back to Mexico.
[00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:57.609]  Citizens and illegals are running north.
[00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.170]  And the U.S.
[00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.471]  government trained these people.
[00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.873]  It's all a government operation to wrest control of rival cartels.
[00:02:06.053 --> 00:02:07.314]  Very serious headline.
[00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.853]  Mexican forces rescue dozens apparently held by kidnappers.
[00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:17.115]  Nice photos that tell a thousand words today.
[00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:18.516]  Bush Sr.
[00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:28.201]  out with his Bush 41 jacket on next to William Jefferson Clinton, Presidente number 42, out on their fishing boat.
[00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:29.202]  Oh, there's such
[00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.177]  Good friends.
[00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:41.707]  We have that photo on InfoWars.com, a little caption I wrote that says, it's just like a play or professional wrestling.
[00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.010]  Clinton and I were never enemies.
[00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:47.854]  We met secretly 11 times before the 92 election.
[00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.539]  Bill has been working for us since before our operation at MENA.
[00:02:55.918 --> 00:03:00.361]  Snow says oil prices hurting economy on CNBC.
[00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:03.403]  Wow, finally a Freudian slip and the truth.
[00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:05.564]  I want to commend World Daily.
[00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:16.771]  They are finally picking up on the story we put out last Friday about how the people in New London, Connecticut were being abused and harassed to give over their property.
[00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.687]  Not just having it stolen, but how they were harassed.
[00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:23.628]  Joseph Farah has now picked up on that.
[00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:28.049]  One of the few people in the so-called alternative media that picked up on our report.
[00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.031]  I mean, it's so important that people know the true magnitude of this story.
[00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:36.192]  But getting back to the border, two articles out of the Globe and Mail.
[00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.613]  Ottawa unveils new security plan.
[00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:41.377]  Closer partnership with U.S.
[00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:47.303]  and Mexico, a risk to sovereignty, NDP leader says.
[00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:47.803]  Really?
[00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:49.345]  A risk to sovereignty.
[00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:53.449]  In another article, North American security plan unveiled.
[00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.471]  Open end of the border.
[00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:57.113]  Just world government.
[00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.580]  In your face.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.123]  The New York Times now having to admit, okay, the vaccines are causing autism.
[00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.006]  They even say, we failed to convince you it wasn't true.
[00:04:07.486 --> 00:04:09.507]  So since it's now proven, we have to admit it.
[00:04:09.527 --> 00:04:11.569]  I mean, they basically say that in the article.
[00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.229]  It's incredible.
[00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.413]  And Diana, feared of being assassinated, says bodyguard.
[00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:20.616]  Now it's not just her own memoirs, her own diary.
[00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:26.240]  But she told her bodyguard they're going to kill me just weeks before they did kill her.
[00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:29.389]  And she predicted specifically how they would kill her.
[00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.472]  Charles says he'll kill me in a fake auto accident.
[00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:44.606]  That'd be like if I said, Billy Bob says he's gonna kill me next week, and I gave the specific way he'd do it, and then I died that way, and all the evidence shows I was killed, but the police said, no!
[00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:47.049]  No, it's not that.
[00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:48.190]  It's not.
[00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:51.913]  Folks, there is so much news coming up.
[00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:56.624]  Huge broadcast lined up for you today and wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:58.267]  We're taking a lot of calls.
[00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:02.631]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.935]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:09.980]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.245]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:18.369]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.332]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:23.774]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:28.558]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:31.760]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.822]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:41.427]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.947 --> 00:05:45.748]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:06:02.054 --> 00:06:03.096]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:06.200]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.626]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:11.887]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:16.774]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:19.374]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:34.558]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:41.659]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:02.567]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:06.672]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:07.793]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:12.357]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:16.762]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.142 --> 00:07:22.027]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:25.990]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.514]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:34.516]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[00:07:49.748 --> 00:07:50.969]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:52.269]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:30.149]  Welcome, again it is Tuesday the 28th day of June 2005.
[00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:39.353]  The next two hours and 51 minutes we're going to be taking your phone calls covering a mass of vital news and information.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.166]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:51.130]  Another one of those days just filled with important news and your calls.
[00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.054]  We'll be going to your calls here in just a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[00:08:55.074 --> 00:09:01.000]  The website's freshly updated for you multiple times daily, rinfowarriors.com.
[00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:07.539]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:14.064]  A lot of the same news on all four of those sites, but a lot of different news on each site as well.
[00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:28.795]  Video, audio clips, original articles and analysis that we've written and put together, alternative media, mainstream media, legislation, photos, documents, your emails.
[00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:31.117]  It's all up there on the sites daily.
[00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:34.491]  The biggest serving of truth you're going to find anywhere.
[00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:58.489]  Alright, I mentioned some of the news in the first segment, but we've been talking a lot about the Supreme Court ruling of last Thursday, where they said, look, even if it isn't for a bridge or a highway or a hospital, if some private corporation, some realtor, or some builder comes along and wants your neighborhood,
[00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:09.124]  middle-class neighborhood or wealthy neighborhood and wants to build something there, wants your business that you've owned, doesn't matter if you've owned it and it's been in the family for a hundred years, we will take it.
[00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:28.619]  And the news blackout is that they will condemn your property out of hand so they don't have to pay you, say, if the house is worth $215,000 on the tax rolls, you've been paying taxes for that, property taxes, your yearly rent, or you lose that land, they will then
[00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:38.054]  Condemn it so they don't have to pay you even that value, and they can pay you $60,000 for a $215,000 piece of property, or roughly one quarter.
[00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:46.941]  And we talked to the locals, we interviewed some on the air, and it has been a total blackout.
[00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:56.848]  Finally, World Net Daily, and we challenged World Net Daily, finally they've got a small blurb about it, about how Joseph Farah is going to talk about the harassment
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.301]  That they've been through on his radio show.
[00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:02.822]  Where's the big article?
[00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.444]  But at least they're doing, they're doing something.
[00:11:06.984 --> 00:11:12.867]  Imagine how mad people would be if they knew, hey, they're not just going to take your property, they're not going to pay you what it's worth.
[00:11:15.288 --> 00:11:20.331]  And then if you fight them, they're going to charge you back rent on land you own outright.
[00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:23.813]  Oh, well, you fought us for five years over this and now you've lost.
[00:11:24.373 --> 00:11:26.234]  And so we're going to charge you back rent.
[00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:50.589]  But this is out of the Houston Chronicle, and literally there's a whole bunch of articles on this from Ohio, and Florida, and Texas, and California, and New York, just literally we have posted dozens of articles where cities within a day said, okay, that's it, we're taking this property.
[00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.971]  And here's an example out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.161]  Threeport moves to seize three properties.
[00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.143]  And notice how it's a positive article.
[00:12:01.663 --> 00:12:03.945]  You read the article and it's like, oh, it's good.
[00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:05.166]  This is wonderful.
[00:12:06.286 --> 00:12:08.248]  See, people say, why do you use mainstream media?
[00:12:08.268 --> 00:12:10.709]  Well, in most of these articles, they tell you the truth.
[00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:15.893]  I mean, they're going to seize a bunch of businesses that are owned outright because some developer wants them.
[00:12:16.794 --> 00:12:19.135]  And then they put the spin on it of how great it is.
[00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.057]  Well, we take the article and we go, no, that isn't great.
[00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:22.798]  See?
[00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.206]  Freeport moves to seize three properties.
[00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:33.912]  And again, to show how out of step the establishment media is trying to sell us their fraud, it's not going to work, though.
[00:12:35.113 --> 00:12:42.099]  Lou Dobbs had a poll, and 99% of respondents are against what's happening.
[00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:47.744]  But you read the news articles, you watch TV, it's, oh, this is good, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:51.007]  See, this is an elite trying to manipulate us.
[00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:51.908]  It's not working.
[00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:55.179]  Freeport moves to seize three properties.
[00:12:55.259 --> 00:13:00.443]  Court's decision empowers the city to acquire the site for a new marina.
[00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:03.206]  And I was just in Freeport three weeks ago.
[00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:07.189]  My uncle, right down by Galveston, my uncle had rented a beach house.
[00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:08.210]  We were down there visiting him.
[00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:15.241]  With Thursday's Supreme Court decision, Freeport officials, they're officials, see?
[00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:16.442]  They're authorities.
[00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:18.765]  They're not servants, they're officials.
[00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.868]  Freeport, see how semantically all this means something?
[00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:25.072]  Freeport officials, i.e.
[00:13:25.132 --> 00:13:26.694]  bosses, king rats,
[00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:27.989]  Dictators!
[00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:46.055]  Freeport officials instructed attorneys to begin preparing legal documents to seize three pieces of waterfront property along the old Brazos River from two seafood companies for construction of an eight million dollar private boat marina.
[00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:48.215]  So they're going to take somebody's land.
[00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:49.756]  It's not even for public use.
[00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:54.197]  You can't go to that fancy marina, you know, with a thousand dollar a month slot.
[00:13:55.686 --> 00:14:07.552]  The court in a 5-4 decision ruled that cities may bulldoze people's homes or businesses to make way for shopping malls or other private development, like luxury homes or marinas.
[00:14:08.032 --> 00:14:10.433]  The decision gives local governments broad power.
[00:14:11.153 --> 00:14:13.635]  It does not give them broad power.
[00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:17.276]  It does not give them broad power.
[00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:22.539]  Again, the Supreme Court can say that black people aren't human beings again, and it doesn't mean it's true.
[00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:28.654]  The decision gives local governments broad power to seize private property to generate tax revenue.
[00:14:29.074 --> 00:14:32.656]  This is the last little piece of the puzzle to put the project together.
[00:14:32.716 --> 00:14:42.362]  Freeport Mayor Jim Phelps settled the project designed to inject new life into the Brazos County City's depressed downtown area.
[00:14:44.503 --> 00:14:50.346]  And it goes on then for three pages to talk about how wonderful it is and how this is going to help Freeport.
[00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:56.869]  So understand, this is the government in collusion with private corporations.
[00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.371]  It's about what the government wants, and what's good for the government.
[00:15:01.871 --> 00:15:19.717]  Oh, well, this developer has given us campaign contributions, and so we're going to take these big seafood docks, where they bring in the seafood that employs the shrimp boats, and employs the processors, and employs the packers, and employs the trucks that come in, and the seafood that supplies Texas.
[00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.111]  This is one of the major ports where the seafood comes in.
[00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:24.891]  I've been there.
[00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:31.312]  These gigantic docks where they bring the food in.
[00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:33.052]  Oh no!
[00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.813]  We're not going to build the marina down the coast a little.
[00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:46.235]  By the way, the reason the Texas coast is so good for industry is that 90 plus percent of the coastline has a big island out in front of it.
[00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:47.095]  That is a chain.
[00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:49.789]  With just little openings in it.
[00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:54.091]  So there's bays behind this long string of islands.
[00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:56.452]  So it's perfect for ports and marinas.
[00:15:56.732 --> 00:15:58.893]  There's places everywhere to build these.
[00:16:00.174 --> 00:16:01.114]  There's no reason.
[00:16:01.354 --> 00:16:03.756]  There's marinas all the way down the Texas coast.
[00:16:04.056 --> 00:16:07.017]  And there's literally thousands of places to build marinas.
[00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:08.618]  There's bays everywhere.
[00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.860]  It's not like it's some precious anchorage.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.862]  They just want it because it's right there at the mouth.
[00:16:17.646 --> 00:16:18.887]  And it's disgusting.
[00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:24.591]  And I guarantee you, folks, it's the same in every case.
[00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:35.998]  They're not going to pay the people fair market value, because the very city, Freeport, Texas, that is going to be stealing this land, they're the people that are going to decide how much to pay.
[00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:42.603]  In fact, in almost every case we see of this, it's been going on for a long time, now they've just got the Supreme Court emboldening them.
[00:16:46.832 --> 00:16:49.915]  And it just goes on to say how wonderful this all is.
[00:16:50.035 --> 00:16:53.838]  So, that's that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.783]  Mexican forces rescue dozens apparently held by kidnappers.
[00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:05.829]  Hundreds of federal agents sent to bring order to the crime-plagued Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo.
[00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.512]  It's very nice being on the Texas border.
[00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:16.833]  Rescued 43 people who appeared to have been kidnapped and held in two houses in a poor neighborhood of the city, the Mexican authorities said Monday.
[00:17:17.493 --> 00:17:31.058]  The rescuers of 37 men and six children were made Sunday night, they said, when at least 200 federal police officers and soldiers conducted raids on three houses in the notorious neighborhood of government-financed housing.
[00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:38.401]  They were met with a grenade and automatic fire, but at least three men identified as kidnappers who were taken into custody.
[00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:43.077]  And I've got local Fox News pieces from the Texas border.
[00:17:44.398 --> 00:17:45.859]  I've got them from Arizona.
[00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:48.540]  I mean, hundreds of deaths this year so far.
[00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:52.762]  Just, what is it, about ten police and federal agents killed.
[00:17:53.783 --> 00:17:54.743]  No tourism.
[00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:55.824]  I mean, it's dead.
[00:17:55.924 --> 00:17:56.944]  No one will go down there.
[00:17:57.284 --> 00:17:59.725]  Notice the government, though, has an issue to travel advisory.
[00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.587]  They just stay real quiet about it, but the word is in.
[00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:04.948]  The word is in.
[00:18:06.938 --> 00:18:27.062]  And this is more of the glories, the whooping cough, the 7,000 leprosy cases, the incredible drug dealing, and now it's taking over a bunch of South Texas towns, and the Mexican flag flies, the American flag is not allowed in America, in five major towns, English is not allowed to be spoken in court.
[00:18:27.943 --> 00:18:29.743]  Folks, this has been the San Antonio Express News.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:37.643]  And, uh, you don't hear the... Can you imagine if a bunch of Germans took over a town and said you can't speak English or Spanish in court?
[00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:48.407]  It'd be, how dare them, you know, heel-haul them, hang them high, tar and feather them, or, you know, some Czechs out of town where you couldn't speak English.
[00:18:49.188 --> 00:18:52.269]  But no, it's okay, because the government wants this.
[00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.550]  And I've got, uh,
[00:18:55.825 --> 00:19:00.626]  Major reports admitting the Canadians are freaking out over losing their sovereignty, being merged with the U.S.
[00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:01.286]  and Mexico.
[00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.286]  At least they know about it.
[00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.207]  The average American has no idea.
[00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:07.187]  But don't worry, the Democrats will save you.
[00:19:07.227 --> 00:19:09.848]  That's why Bill Clinton's vacationing with George Bush Sr.
[00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:10.268]  right now.
[00:19:11.868 --> 00:19:17.329]  And Snow, the Treasury Secretary, says oil prices hurting economy, CNBC.
[00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:21.930]  So I guess the blizzard broke with the Snow job he's been giving us.
[00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:29.733]  And folks, just so much more, but we'll take calls first when we get back in this break and then just get into all the other news.
[00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:40.421]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 And we'll get you up and on the air and don't forget prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com freshly updated for you multiple times daily just jam-packed with news and information

[00:20:01.377 --> 00:20:03.919]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:07.581]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:20:07.701 --> 00:20:08.081]  Shocking?
[00:20:08.162 --> 00:20:08.622]  Of course!
[00:20:08.902 --> 00:20:10.963]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:20:11.123 --> 00:20:14.005]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:20:14.205 --> 00:20:15.586]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[00:22:02.213 --> 00:22:04.434]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.854 --> 00:22:09.216]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:15.299]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:19.580]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:19.861 --> 00:22:25.063]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:26.784]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:30.345 --> 00:22:33.867]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:36.669]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:39.290]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:43.313]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:43.793 --> 00:22:49.997]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:50.417 --> 00:22:51.418]  You'll be glad you did.

[00:22:52.098 --> 00:22:52.278]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.991]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:15.945 --> 00:24:22.492]  I have all of today's news, and it is voluminous and all very important, and I have a lot of news I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:24:22.512 --> 00:24:32.544]  A bunch of different Supreme Court rulings on computer file sharing, on the Ten Commandments, and yes, we have Wright-Gorb
[00:24:33.502 --> 00:24:40.204]  Owner of Western Seafood, one of the two seafood companies and docks that are going to be stolen by the city of Freeport.
[00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:49.948]  He'll be joining us for about 15-20 minutes, coming up in the next hour to talk about this land grabbing that's going on around the country, thanks to the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:24:50.528 --> 00:24:51.968]  But right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:53.869]  Fred in Philadelphia.
[00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:54.569]  Go ahead, Fred.
[00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:55.450]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.230]  Hi.
[00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.670]  I want to bring up something.
[00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.811]  We'll get back to the
[00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:08.160]  The Justice Department and these indefinite detainment, but I want to bring up something quickly about Donaldson at the FTC.
[00:25:09.221 --> 00:25:21.490]  He was eased out, in my opinion, at the FTC for the main reason that he wanted to reveal the names of the advisors of the hedge funds.
[00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:27.895]  And the super-rich and probably intelligence community couldn't
[00:25:28.251 --> 00:25:29.912]  I couldn't stand that proposal.
[00:25:30.772 --> 00:25:34.914]  For those that don't know, about a week or two ago he resigned, I believe.
[00:25:35.794 --> 00:25:37.255]  So why don't you give people the details?
[00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.556]  Most people don't know who you're talking about.
[00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:54.462]  Alright, I don't really remember the gentleman's first name right now, but his name is Donaldson, head of the SEC, and he had a bunch of proposals to make transparency a part of hedge funds.
[00:25:55.482 --> 00:26:01.746]  And the big part of that was to reveal the name of a hedge fund's advisor.
[00:26:03.007 --> 00:26:09.131]  And the hedge funds have tremendous power in the market, just like the specialists do.
[00:26:10.272 --> 00:26:13.714]  And their advisor has tremendous power over the hedge fund.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.302]  Uh, and it may even, even have more powers.
[00:26:17.322 --> 00:26:19.523]  Well, I'm sure the government's run by a pack of criminals.
[00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:20.944]  Everything's totally corrupt.
[00:26:21.044 --> 00:26:22.525]  I mean, everybody knows that.
[00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:37.414]  And on the, uh, Justice Department, uh, issue about, uh, uh, at least 70, 70, um, Americans have been in prison indefinitely, uh, using, uh, this indefinite
[00:26:38.965 --> 00:26:51.532]  Without charges, without their names being released secretly, and this is totally opposed to our way of life, our country's foundation.
[00:26:51.592 --> 00:26:52.633]  It's like everything else.
[00:26:53.133 --> 00:27:01.198]  And it's not just people that have a tie to this or a tie to that, or of a certain ethnic group.
[00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:05.320]  You're talking about, and I know for example there's a guy in Atlanta named John,
[00:27:06.109 --> 00:27:08.931]  That was in prison for five and a half months.
[00:27:09.791 --> 00:27:16.756]  American citizen, white American, and he was in prison for five and a half months and would have been held indefinitely.
[00:27:17.576 --> 00:27:21.799]  And they told him they were going to make an example of him under the Homeland Security Law.
[00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:29.263]  So you have a material witness statute, but you also have this Homeland Security Law and you have the Patriot Act.
[00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:29.984]  No, I know.
[00:27:30.004 --> 00:27:31.104]  Thanks for the call, Fred.
[00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:35.107]  What they're doing is they're setting precedents everywhere.
[00:27:36.371 --> 00:27:42.355]  While they tell you nationally, hey, it's just for the Muslims, and again folks, it's wrong what's happening to the Muslims.
[00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:48.719]  But when Fred talks about, you know, white guys being grabbed, the point is, this is really for everybody.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.680]  Who's up next in order here?
[00:27:53.882 --> 00:27:54.762]  Maggie in Texas.
[00:27:54.802 --> 00:27:55.443]  Go ahead, Maggie.
[00:27:55.463 --> 00:27:56.463]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:57.244 --> 00:28:03.708]  You mentioned briefly last Saturday's New York Times front page article pertaining to Symarisal.
[00:28:05.344 --> 00:28:10.728]  Yes, they're like, we've tried to convince people it's good for you, but it just won't work, so yes, it's bad.
[00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:13.730]  That isn't what I got out of it.
[00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:26.117]  I mean, to me, the spin was that they tried very hard to demonize those who don't accept the official version of things.
[00:28:26.277 --> 00:28:33.802]  In any event, I happen to know that that article was written a long time ago and has apparently been on ice for eight months.
[00:28:34.332 --> 00:28:39.914]  Six or eight months awaiting proper placement if we are talking about the same article last Saturday.
[00:28:40.415 --> 00:28:41.275]  I believe we are.
[00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:42.696]  Yes, okay.
[00:28:42.896 --> 00:29:00.964]  Look, I mean just for those that don't know, they're still putting it in most vaccines and in the vaccines they kept the Marisol in, mercury-based preservative, they have actually increased the levels over 200 times, 250 times, that's Associated Press, in the flu shots, in some of the hepatitis shots, and others.
[00:29:02.245 --> 00:29:09.990]  We have the CDC's own documents from 2000 that were first reported on by Alternative News Media in 2000.
[00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.952]  Dan Burton ordered the documents released.
[00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:17.915]  ABC News did a report last year admitting it had their own minutes where they were going.
[00:29:17.995 --> 00:29:19.476]  I wouldn't give my grandchildren this.
[00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:20.957]  Billions have been damaged.
[00:29:21.237 --> 00:29:22.558]  We've got to cover this up.
[00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:29.543]  And so now Salon picked it up and so now the New York Times is doing damage control.
[00:29:29.563 --> 00:29:29.843]  Go ahead.
[00:29:30.433 --> 00:29:31.614]  Oh, okay.
[00:29:31.674 --> 00:29:34.015]  You're now touching on what I wanted to bring up, I believe.
[00:29:34.055 --> 00:29:34.655]  Well, stay there.
[00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:36.777]  I'll let you comment on the other side of the break, Maggie.
[00:29:37.517 --> 00:29:42.560]  And then the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.883]  We'll be right back with your calls and just a ton of other really important news.
[00:29:48.323 --> 00:29:50.564]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.805 --> 00:29:52.706]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:54.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:58.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.477 --> 00:30:03.177]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:05.378]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:30:05.578 --> 00:30:06.258]  Prepare yourself.
[00:30:06.438 --> 00:30:10.138]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:16.019]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book, The Bible Says, for free.
[00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.460]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.240]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.940]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:25.821]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:30:31.485 --> 00:30:31.765]  U.S.
[00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:32.846]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[00:30:32.946 --> 00:30:34.066]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:34.986]  Which are collectible?
[00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:35.767]  Which are bullion?
[00:30:35.827 --> 00:30:37.968]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:40.429]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:40.869]  Coins.

[00:31:01.298 --> 00:31:04.319]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:09.522]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.802 --> 00:31:14.165]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:23.371]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:27.214]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:32.537]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.817 --> 00:31:39.502]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:40.683]  What about you?
[00:31:41.324 --> 00:31:46.690]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:04.269]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.829]  Why?
[00:32:04.849 --> 00:32:07.792]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:12.836]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:32:12.956 --> 00:32:22.664]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:32:37.254 --> 00:32:42.617]  Cardivite drops and capsules may help improve your circulation and cardiovascular health, but that's up to you.

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.080]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.921]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:28.248]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:31.130]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:34.392]  I want to get into what's happening to the border.
[00:33:35.253 --> 00:33:35.993]  It is public.
[00:33:36.093 --> 00:33:37.995]  Our governments are signing the documents.
[00:33:39.115 --> 00:33:42.017]  It's been in the works for 20 years.
[00:33:42.718 --> 00:33:49.563]  Our governments, our social security, our law enforcement, our laws are being merged with Canada and Mexico.
[00:33:49.623 --> 00:33:51.484]  The Canadians are freaking out.
[00:33:52.256 --> 00:34:04.319]  The average American is celebrating the Spurs victory, you know, for a week, and literally drooling while their children are smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:20.864]  While prisons are being built everywhere, while private property is being taken, while the government is genetically engineering the food, while mercury is being put in the vaccines, while laws are being passed to forcibly, psychologically test and drug our children,
[00:34:22.327 --> 00:34:25.970]  They're radically expanding the size of the CPS to steal your children.
[00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.412]  They're putting microphones and cameras up everywhere.
[00:34:30.753 --> 00:34:33.415]  They are openly setting up world government.
[00:34:33.435 --> 00:34:35.636]  They're preparing to launch more terror attacks.
[00:34:36.037 --> 00:34:37.578]  They're really bringing in the police state.
[00:34:38.398 --> 00:34:45.243]  And you've got a mass of people that are waking up, and another mass of individuals who are just getting stupider and dumber by the minute.
[00:34:47.124 --> 00:34:50.166]  And then meanwhile, the patriot movement, the truth-seeking movement,
[00:34:51.434 --> 00:35:03.799]  All it's growing by leaps and bounds has been thoroughly infiltrated and full of troublemakers and full of provocateurs and pro-intel pro-operatives trying to sow the seeds of dissension and mistrust.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.722]  But the good news is the globalists are falling apart and having defeat after defeat.
[00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:20.967]  Now that their system is coming into view, now that their program is manifesting itself, the resistance is just exploding.
[00:35:22.029 --> 00:35:23.850]  And their system is imploding.
[00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.931]  So, the good, the bad, and the ugly, we cover it all here.
[00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:42.277]  We're eternal optimists, but at the same time, to assess a problem, you need as much data as possible from as many angles as possible, and you need to be able to face the probabilities of what we're going to be looking at here in the next few years.
[00:35:42.957 --> 00:35:43.937]  And it is not pretty.
[00:35:45.198 --> 00:35:50.340]  All the evidence points towards a controlled biological release
[00:35:51.118 --> 00:36:10.750]  by the military-industrial complex to create total panic and then the ensuing martial law sold as the solution and then we will never emerge from the heightened security and safety as they'll call it, i.e., military dictatorship.
[00:36:12.463 --> 00:36:28.512]  And I've got the executive orders, I've got the top generals, I've got the Rand Corporation talking about it, I've got the Army and Naval War College talking about it, I've got video of the troops training to do it all over the country, North, South, East, West, from California to Maryland, from Texas to Illinois.
[00:36:29.713 --> 00:36:32.674]  They've been gearing up for it for a long time.
[00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:38.978]  And Bush on April 1st signed the executive order for forced quarantines and mass arrests.
[00:36:40.481 --> 00:36:48.285]  And again, that'll just be the smokescreen for the putch or the purge by this junta.
[00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:51.186]  But let's hurry through your calls.
[00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:52.487]  I want to give everybody a chance to talk.
[00:36:52.807 --> 00:36:53.988]  I've got some news I want to cover.
[00:36:54.588 --> 00:37:03.313]  We've got one of the owners down in Freeport, Texas, one of these big seafood docks that the city wants to steal, as usual, and not pay them proper value.
[00:37:03.373 --> 00:37:04.813]  All part of your new freedom.
[00:37:05.674 --> 00:37:10.056]  But Maggie in Texas, you were bringing up autism.
[00:37:10.871 --> 00:37:12.492]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:12.732 --> 00:37:22.677]  I just, I wanted to add that in connection with the salon investigation that you mentioned, an excellent article by Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:37:22.938 --> 00:37:29.261]  appeared in the July 16th edition of Rolling Stone magazine.
[00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:30.902]  Do you have a link to that article?
[00:37:30.962 --> 00:37:32.583]  Because it is really very good.
[00:37:32.603 --> 00:37:34.944]  Yeah, Bob Lovely posted it last week.
[00:37:35.024 --> 00:37:35.444]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:35.484 --> 00:37:36.365]  I didn't even see that.
[00:37:36.405 --> 00:37:40.207]  Alright, then I have nothing further to add except that some
[00:37:40.882 --> 00:37:45.324]  Scheduled interviews on ABC News with Kennedy were cancelled.
[00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:46.565]  He never got to speak.
[00:37:47.366 --> 00:37:49.607]  Oh yeah, you can't let the people know what's happening.
[00:37:51.348 --> 00:37:53.009]  Good to hear from you, Maggie.
[00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.451]  And let me just briefly comment on this.
[00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:01.774]  Now, here are the numbers.
[00:38:02.054 --> 00:38:04.535]  And this really is a public service announcement.
[00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.176]  This is not my opinion.
[00:38:06.216 --> 00:38:08.757]  This is not what I think and what I believe.
[00:38:08.797 --> 00:38:09.498]  It's what I know.
[00:38:11.432 --> 00:38:20.860]  No heavy metal is more reactive in brain tissue of humans and in mammals than mercury.
[00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:28.087]  Not uranium, not plutonium, not lead, not arsenic.
[00:38:29.868 --> 00:38:35.053]  Nothing is more destructive in the brain than the heavy metal or
[00:38:36.002 --> 00:38:44.429]  The whole, what do you call it, Grignard reagent category, according to major universities, than mercury.
[00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:59.662]  In fact, mercury, they've known mercury's poison is so long that arguably there is more research and data on mercury than any other compound or element metal out there.
[00:39:02.765 --> 00:39:04.266]  Bar none, there's no debating it.
[00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:15.970]  You put mercury in minuscule levels into a petri dish with brain tissue, it literally causes them to short-circuit and explode.
[00:39:17.632 --> 00:39:19.154]  Because the brain is electrochemical.
[00:39:19.274 --> 00:39:20.776]  It is horrible!
[00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:30.204]  Now, there are studies on mercury in vaccines from the 1950s.
[00:39:30.584 --> 00:39:31.704]  They told them, don't do it.
[00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:35.806]  But what happened when the big vaccine makers heard it was really bad for brains?
[00:39:36.346 --> 00:39:37.766]  Especially developing brains.
[00:39:38.347 --> 00:39:40.107]  They put it in all the vaccines.
[00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:47.050]  Then, twenty-something years ago, they created the Vaccine Damage Fund.
[00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.291]  A multi-billion dollar fund, where the government, you don't go to a normal court.
[00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:54.072]  They set up their special courts, no juries.
[00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:59.408]  And you go to them, and the federal government decides what you get.
[00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:03.389]  And it's normally a very paltry amount of money.
[00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:10.092]  There are, I mean I've probably interviewed 40 people over the last 10 years on air.
[00:40:10.192 --> 00:40:12.113]  More than that, I mean it's just so many guests.
[00:40:12.173 --> 00:40:14.874]  I mean I did, for a couple years I was obsessed with this.
[00:40:15.414 --> 00:40:16.155]  Back in the late 1990's.
[00:40:16.215 --> 00:40:18.796]  A lot of you probably heard those shows.
[00:40:20.262 --> 00:40:27.186]  Or I'd have epidemiologists and scientists and brain experts and neuro-experts.
[00:40:28.747 --> 00:40:29.848]  All of these people want.
[00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:32.910]  And they know what vaccines do.
[00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.411]  They know the effect it has.
[00:40:34.511 --> 00:40:39.294]  I mean, the 18-month-old baby is happy, giggling, wonderful.
[00:40:41.555 --> 00:40:44.277]  Goes in to get their third round of shots at 18 months.
[00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:46.058]  And in the car has a seizure.
[00:40:46.538 --> 00:40:47.539]  Goes into a coma.
[00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:50.464]  They take the child back to the hospital.
[00:40:50.484 --> 00:40:54.126]  Sometimes they have a seizure in the waiting room and they try to... You shook the baby!
[00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:55.366]  Shaken baby!
[00:40:55.947 --> 00:40:56.967]  These people are so sick.
[00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:59.368]  The government writes the guidelines.
[00:40:59.729 --> 00:41:00.869]  They want to seize families.
[00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:02.130]  They want to break families up.
[00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.471]  They also have to cover up what they've done.
[00:41:04.831 --> 00:41:06.612]  So they came out with shaken baby.
[00:41:07.493 --> 00:41:07.853]  Why?
[00:41:08.373 --> 00:41:12.295]  And this sudden fetal death syndrome.
[00:41:15.259 --> 00:41:18.720]  Now, it's even worse for premature babies and babies whose immune systems have problems.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:25.541]  You know, you have a newborn baby who weighs 4 pounds, premature, and they come in and inject them.
[00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:27.742]  Oh, your baby's in more danger.
[00:41:27.762 --> 00:41:30.222]  You've got this little bitty 4 pound creature, you know.
[00:41:30.962 --> 00:41:36.324]  With an 8 pound baby, the first round of shots is already 200 plus times the safe level of mercury.
[00:41:36.804 --> 00:41:39.304]  You take a 4 pounder, we're looking at, what, 500 times?
[00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:39.464]  500 times!
[00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:48.773]  And by the way, if you ingest mercury bound with organic compounds, you only get some of the bad effects.
[00:41:49.934 --> 00:41:53.976]  We're designed to be able to eat mercury in the environment, bound to things.
[00:41:54.296 --> 00:42:02.000]  But when it's pure mercury, in a chemical, injected into the blood, it just devastates.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.481]  Because the body sees the blood as nutritious.
[00:42:06.222 --> 00:42:09.584]  And so it doesn't have a wall, it doesn't have a shield, the stomach does.
[00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:13.766]  And so it just absorbs it as nourishment.
[00:42:16.828 --> 00:42:21.950]  And folks, you know, when I say this, people have trouble believing it, but this is the plan.
[00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.591]  It's just like Aldous Huxley.
[00:42:24.631 --> 00:42:35.895]  He wrote Brave New World in 1933, and before he died in 1962 at Berkeley, he said, look, my family's been involved in the elite circles, you know, his brother was the head of UNESCO,
[00:42:36.949 --> 00:42:44.234]  First Director General of UNESCO, the UN group that manages and sets policy for our lives.
[00:42:45.635 --> 00:42:51.799]  And he said, look, I've been to the laboratories in 1960 where they have wires into people's brains, they're remote controlled.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.983]  The plan is to force drug everyone and to literally do what I talked about
[00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:00.923]  In Brave New World that I wrote in 1933.
[00:43:01.483 --> 00:43:08.970]  Because I was in high-level Fabian Socialist meetings, this is what he was saying, where this was the discussions, even with the primitive technologies.
[00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.911]  Well, couldn't we x-ray the eggs?
[00:43:10.951 --> 00:43:14.374]  Couldn't we make a literal kind of retarded servant class?
[00:43:14.795 --> 00:43:15.695]  And of course H.G.
[00:43:15.735 --> 00:43:21.861]  Wells, who was a globalist, who liked it, he wrote non-fiction books, one of them The New World Order.
[00:43:22.581 --> 00:43:25.844]  And then he had the analogy of it, or the parallel, you know, in his book,
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:33.382]  The time machine, you know, with the Morlocks who keep us as the slaves and feed on us, and they're a more advanced species of humanoid.
[00:43:34.743 --> 00:43:37.144]  It's social Darwinism, okay?
[00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:42.726]  And so you are meant to have an IQ reduction.
[00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:51.889]  They know that it attacks the cerebral cortex, creates micro-lesions, and literally reduces IQ.
[00:43:53.539 --> 00:43:56.780]  When you research the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, there's reports on this.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.560]  They're obsessed with organic food.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.100]  They're obsessed with no vaccines.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:05.962]  They're obsessed with filtered and reverse osmosis water.
[00:44:08.002 --> 00:44:09.282]  Because they know, folks.
[00:44:10.622 --> 00:44:11.123]  They know.
[00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:21.105]  It's well known that Senator Rockefeller eats only organic food and drinks all this purified water and won't take vaccines and won't let his family take them.
[00:44:22.025 --> 00:44:23.145]  The Senator from West Virginia.
[00:44:24.924 --> 00:44:25.544]  It's well-known.
[00:44:26.225 --> 00:44:27.365]  Well-known, the Queen of England.
[00:44:27.445 --> 00:44:35.129]  But you notice they're all on the boards of groups that have the vaccines for the third world, and then they're also on boards of groups that call for population control.
[00:44:35.409 --> 00:44:35.989]  Hmm, let me see.
[00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:40.051]  They're calling for population control and reducing population at the same time, though.
[00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:43.853]  Oh, they're giving money so that the third world doesn't die.
[00:44:45.753 --> 00:44:47.094]  So they get their medicine.
[00:44:47.134 --> 00:44:49.195]  Be sure and take your medicine, sweetie pie.
[00:44:49.215 --> 00:44:50.976]  Now, I said it would go to your cause, but this is important.
[00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:53.637]  And you brought it up, Maggie.
[00:44:54.932 --> 00:44:57.655]  We'll go to Michael and Dave and Pam and others in a second.
[00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:12.710]  But if you won't believe me, if you won't believe all the documents, if you won't believe the facts, the CDC's own documents, Dan Burton, his own grandson, was two years old, happy, bouncing on his knee.
[00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:18.876]  Next time he saw him, drooling in the corner, you know, looking at his hands, gyrating, nodding his head.
[00:45:20.094 --> 00:45:21.715]  Doing, you know, the classic thing.
[00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:23.036]  He's now, like, what, twelve years old?
[00:45:23.517 --> 00:45:31.763]  Burton's... Burton may be a globalist, Burton may be a... But still, when it's your grandson, and it comes home to roost with you, you know it's a fraud.
[00:45:33.644 --> 00:45:37.687]  Idiot savant's autism was unknown.
[00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:40.989]  It was the unknown country.
[00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.431]  It was incredibly rare.
[00:45:46.373 --> 00:45:48.255]  Twenty-four years ago,
[00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.933]  1 in 25,000 people had autism.
[00:45:55.815 --> 00:45:57.677]  A year ago the numbers were 1 in 1,000.
[00:45:58.618 --> 00:46:01.601]  And the numbers are trending for 2005 that it's going to be 1 in 476.
[00:46:08.163 --> 00:46:13.425]  And the media tries to say, oh, that's just over-diagnosis, or now we're diagnosing.
[00:46:13.765 --> 00:46:16.246]  Folks, go to the shopping mall, go to the grocery store.
[00:46:16.686 --> 00:46:18.947]  When I was a kid, you didn't see autistic children.
[00:46:19.187 --> 00:46:20.147]  Now they're everywhere.
[00:46:20.207 --> 00:46:21.928]  They warehouse them in the public schools.
[00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:25.009]  In most public schools, they have whole rooms just for them.
[00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:26.770]  It's much worse than that.
[00:46:30.051 --> 00:46:33.072]  Good parents, good genetic stock, no history of problems.
[00:46:33.532 --> 00:46:35.693]  Suddenly, their child is a drooling mess.
[00:46:39.153 --> 00:46:40.593]  And I know you love your autistic children.
[00:46:40.934 --> 00:46:41.894]  I'm not bashing them.
[00:46:42.514 --> 00:46:45.455]  The point is, is that we need people to save the children that haven't been damaged.
[00:46:46.135 --> 00:46:47.755]  We need to tell parents what they can do.
[00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:51.537]  Your baby starts, suddenly won't look at you, suddenly is just looking at its fingers.
[00:46:51.897 --> 00:46:53.097]  Detox immediately!
[00:46:53.137 --> 00:46:53.717]  Emergency!
[00:46:53.757 --> 00:46:54.297]  Emergency!
[00:46:54.457 --> 00:46:55.958]  That stuff's burning through their brain.
[00:46:56.138 --> 00:46:57.378]  You can get some of it out of them.
[00:46:57.598 --> 00:46:58.719]  You've only got a few months.
[00:47:01.899 --> 00:47:04.540]  Gosh, I have to watch them doing this to us.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.121]  They're so cold-blooded and you're so naive.
[00:47:08.996 --> 00:47:10.296]  But the proof is now out.
[00:47:10.336 --> 00:47:12.437]  The CDC's own documents got released.
[00:47:13.757 --> 00:47:25.919]  Centers for Disease Control, last year, from 2000, in a meeting, of their top directors and their top scientists, and they go, the evidence, I can read the quotes, I've been reading them for years, it's in all, it's in Salon, everywhere now.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.501]  If you want to read the report itself, forget just reading a few blurbs in the articles, I read like 50 pages of it.
[00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:34.581]  I've never read it all, it gets worse and worse.
[00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:40.667]  Where the head scientist goes, look, I'm telling my daughter, don't give this to my grandchildren.
[00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:42.047]  This stuff's deadly.
[00:47:42.267 --> 00:47:43.948]  We've got millions that have been damaged.
[00:47:44.588 --> 00:47:45.908]  Well, we've got to cover this up.
[00:47:48.369 --> 00:47:50.450]  And that's just scientists within the CDC.
[00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:55.831]  Despite the fact that they're Malthusian and they're social Darwinists, they still aren't that evil.
[00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:58.432]  But their bosses above them are telling them to cover it up.
[00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:00.013]  And so they're not going to stop.
[00:48:00.653 --> 00:48:02.633]  By the way, they haven't taken it out of most of the vaccines.
[00:48:02.653 --> 00:48:04.374]  They've actually increased it.
[00:48:06.107 --> 00:48:07.749]  Oh yes, but you'll hear them say they've taken it out.
[00:48:07.949 --> 00:48:08.690]  That's a lie!
[00:48:10.372 --> 00:48:11.333]  That's a lie!
[00:48:13.395 --> 00:48:14.596]  We have those articles posted.
[00:48:16.498 --> 00:48:20.182]  So, they knowingly know what they're doing.
[00:48:20.202 --> 00:48:23.726]  And they got the New York Times going, well the parents just won't listen.
[00:48:23.786 --> 00:48:25.508]  People just want to believe what they want to believe.
[00:48:27.651 --> 00:48:28.952]  Why do you see Kennedy Jr.
[00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:29.352]  doing this?
[00:48:29.412 --> 00:48:31.193]  Why do you see Dan Burton doing this?
[00:48:31.273 --> 00:48:35.175]  Why do you see all these prominent people going, yes, it is bad.
[00:48:35.255 --> 00:48:35.975]  Yes, it is.
[00:48:36.035 --> 00:48:37.116]  Yes, slavery's wrong.
[00:48:37.396 --> 00:48:38.657]  Yes, the world is round.
[00:48:39.797 --> 00:48:41.438]  Yes, women deserve the right to vote.
[00:48:41.478 --> 00:48:45.720]  You know, it's just finally no matter, you can say, yes, black people are human beings.
[00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:48.162]  You can say it isn't so, but it is so.
[00:48:50.863 --> 00:48:54.245]  It's because people's children are being damaged.
[00:48:55.988 --> 00:49:03.772]  It's a handful, a couple hundred globalists that have a couple thousand top minions who know the full plan.
[00:49:04.333 --> 00:49:09.335]  And then there's six and a half... That was the poll, the census in 2000.
[00:49:09.956 --> 00:49:13.038]  It's probably over seven billion people now, but let's just say six and a half billion.
[00:49:14.698 --> 00:49:19.141]  It was six billion, three hundred million five years ago, so... It's probably seven billion.
[00:49:21.442 --> 00:49:24.644]  I just go to the mean point and say six and a half billion, but again,
[00:49:26.417 --> 00:49:33.759]  You know, it's time that we are enslaved because we're naive and we will not see it!
[00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:37.000]  We will not face it!
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.641]  And it's time to grow up.
[00:49:39.781 --> 00:49:41.261]  Our children deserve it!
[00:49:44.422 --> 00:49:46.163]  It's time to face the facts.
[00:49:47.283 --> 00:49:54.465]  We're dealing with people that knowingly put sodium fluoride in the water that does the exact same type of stuff that
[00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:56.191]  These other chemicals do.
[00:49:56.692 --> 00:49:57.772]  These other compounds.
[00:49:59.733 --> 00:50:02.554]  I mean, I got the studies from the University of Texas in the 30's.
[00:50:03.474 --> 00:50:05.935]  About how it is a toxic sedative.
[00:50:06.775 --> 00:50:07.496]  Sodium Fluoride.
[00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:09.536]  There's no debating.
[00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:11.017]  It's been known.
[00:50:11.057 --> 00:50:12.378]  That's why they put it in the water.
[00:50:13.238 --> 00:50:15.139]  They know Sodium Fluoride's bad.
[00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:16.459]  They know Mercury's bad.
[00:50:16.499 --> 00:50:19.880]  But instead, I got newscast, which we've aired before.
[00:50:20.461 --> 00:50:21.401]  Went out nationally.
[00:50:22.489 --> 00:50:25.930]  All over the country where they say mercury is actually good for your child's brain.
[00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.951]  Folks, mercury isn't good for your child's brain.
[00:50:29.711 --> 00:50:33.812]  You know, we've had listeners that have been called hippies by their family because they only buy grass-fed beef.
[00:50:35.812 --> 00:50:38.073]  We're weird because we believe cows should eat grass.
[00:50:41.013 --> 00:50:42.294]  I mean really folks, we're radical.
[00:50:42.994 --> 00:50:43.974]  Cows should eat grass.
[00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:47.175]  Mercury's not good for you.
[00:50:48.355 --> 00:50:51.476]  Cameras and microphones going up everywhere isn't freedom either.
[00:50:53.081 --> 00:50:54.842]  All right, it's really that simple.
[00:50:55.542 --> 00:50:58.143]  It's time to grow up and face it!
[00:50:59.064 --> 00:51:00.585]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.766 --> 00:51:05.647]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.887 --> 00:51:07.468]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:51:22.075 --> 00:51:22.875]  The Constitution has been
[00:51:23.495 --> 00:51:24.916]  And America is now a police state.

[00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:52.854]  Call now!
[00:54:11.943 --> 00:54:14.985]  I know there's a lot of police out there listening.
[00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:16.906]  I don't want them to know I care about you.
[00:54:17.707 --> 00:54:21.110]  Even though you carry out unlawful orders and you work for a criminal system.
[00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:32.719]  But I want to ask cops out there, would you let somebody come over, some heavyweight boxer, and punch your three-year-old in the head three or four times and brain damage him?
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.881]  No, you'd pull a gun out and you'd kill him.
[00:54:36.798 --> 00:54:47.663]  But you'll sit there like a coward because you're so afraid of this system, because you're so bought into it, and just deny out of hand what I'm saying about vaccines and mercury, and you'll let them shoot your daughter or son up.
[00:54:48.024 --> 00:54:48.764]  Shame on you!
[00:54:50.205 --> 00:54:50.905]  Shame on you!
[00:54:51.946 --> 00:54:53.406]  You're not a man, you're a coward.
[00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:55.727]  You're not a mother, you're not a woman, you're a coward.
[00:54:55.927 --> 00:54:56.868]  You're a piece of filth.
[00:54:57.822 --> 00:55:06.529]  And that goes for the yuppies out there that think they're on top of the world and nothing threatens them and as long as they deny something and have a laissez-faire attitude, it gives them control over it.
[00:55:06.729 --> 00:55:09.792]  It doesn't give you control over a problem to deny it's there.
[00:55:11.193 --> 00:55:12.514]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:55:14.355 --> 00:55:15.496]  Mercury's nutritious.
[00:55:16.297 --> 00:55:17.898]  In fact, people don't believe me about that.
[00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:22.202]  Find that clip from local CBS, and by the way, this report was on all over the country.
[00:55:22.542 --> 00:55:27.206]  They send down these canned reports for the local news readers to read off of.
[00:55:29.164 --> 00:55:38.851]  When this report came out, I did a Google search, and it was literally just hundreds and hundreds of links of TV, CBS stations around the country ran this same filthy report.
[00:55:38.891 --> 00:55:39.331]  Can you find it?
[00:55:39.351 --> 00:55:42.293]  Can you find Mercury's New Treasures for me?
[00:55:43.714 --> 00:55:45.515]  I know I didn't give you a heads up during the break.
[00:55:45.555 --> 00:55:50.058]  There's like 300 files on the computer, but is something like Mercury's good for you?
[00:55:50.959 --> 00:55:53.060]  Well, we'll find that clip and play it later if we can't.
[00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:53.941]  Oh, you found it?
[00:55:53.981 --> 00:55:54.662]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:55:54.682 --> 00:55:55.042]  Here it is.
[00:55:57.006 --> 00:55:59.447]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:55:59.687 --> 00:56:03.028]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:56:03.329 --> 00:56:05.369]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:08.110]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:11.672]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Shima Mathers.
[00:56:14.196 --> 00:56:20.158]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:27.080]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:34.503]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:56:35.943 --> 00:56:39.224]  Well, now notice the semantical deception though.
[00:56:39.924 --> 00:56:41.825]  The government paid for those studies
[00:56:42.882 --> 00:56:45.764]  And they decided what good mental activity is.
[00:56:45.804 --> 00:56:52.368]  And so, for them, an IQ reduction on average of 20 points is wonderful.
[00:56:53.168 --> 00:57:01.153]  So, I mean, you know, the people that think this is great, I mean, I guess, you know, you should, you should just ask them to give your child a lobotomy then.
[00:57:01.213 --> 00:57:04.775]  I mean, you know, I'm looking for the report that lobotomies are good for children.
[00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:15.420]  Look, I know we have loaded phone lines here, and I should, I get a lot of calls, and I haven't done that, but, you know, I get off on this jag about, uh, vaccines.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:23.845]  I mean, it's just... Right now, all over the place, they're injecting children, and every year before school, they say, it's the law, you gotta vaccinate.
[00:57:24.685 --> 00:57:25.586]  There is no law!
[00:57:25.946 --> 00:57:27.027]  There has never been a law!
[00:57:27.067 --> 00:57:32.730]  They actually lie on the news to intimidate you to do it, and I'm just so sick of it!
[00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.831]  It's a bunch of propaganda!
[00:57:35.965 --> 00:57:42.408]  You should be angry when you see the news reporting in the next month, before your child goes to school, by law, they've got to have these shots.
[00:57:43.288 --> 00:57:46.290]  Steam should literally shoot out of your ears.
[00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:56.914]  We had to get a law passed in Texas two years ago in the last legislative session that there is no law that you have to be vaccinated and that it's illegal to tell people it's a law.
[00:57:56.954 --> 00:58:00.956]  Did you know we had to get a law passed saying it's illegal to say there's a law when there isn't a law?
[00:58:01.716 --> 00:58:03.237]  Rick Perry did sign that, by the way.
[00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:05.398]  I do commend him when he does something good.
[00:58:07.282 --> 00:58:08.482]  So, I mean, I don't know what to do.
[00:58:08.703 --> 00:58:13.844]  You've got newscasts all over the country that in unison lie to you and say you've got to take shots?
[00:58:15.185 --> 00:58:17.846]  See, I got so out of control I didn't even plug my videos this hour.
[00:58:18.466 --> 00:58:24.528]  Hope you'll go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and get the videos and expose these murdering pieces of trash.
[00:58:25.548 --> 00:58:31.190]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139 or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.011]  We'll jam a couple calls in in this next segment.
[00:58:34.291 --> 00:58:36.572]  Then we'll get our guest on who's going to lose his property.
[00:58:37.296 --> 00:58:38.136]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.257 --> 00:58:48.019]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.540]  Berkeywater.com today.
[00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:01.222]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:59:03.952 --> 00:59:06.353]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:22.645]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:23.285 --> 00:59:26.167]  We're gonna go straight back to your calls.
[00:59:26.267 --> 00:59:30.490]  We had, uh... We were talking to David in Arizona earlier.
[00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.091]  Is he still there?
[00:59:32.614 --> 00:59:35.535]  We were talking to David and he wanted to know, you know, when do we stop these people?
[00:59:35.575 --> 00:59:36.795]  When do we stand up against them?
[00:59:37.475 --> 00:59:39.116]  Look, we're a corrupt society.
[00:59:39.136 --> 00:59:40.396]  We're a decadent society.
[00:59:40.416 --> 00:59:47.778]  There are a lot of really predatory, evil people out there that think we're all here to be pushed around and controlled.
[00:59:48.638 --> 00:59:57.501]  And so we have to have a change in our society from laying down and being cowardly, and you know, the step and fetch it attitude, to standing up and getting some backbone.
[00:59:58.181 --> 01:00:01.962]  And then loving our families and being involved and building strong communities.
[01:00:03.374 --> 01:00:04.194]  It's a process.
[01:00:04.314 --> 01:00:06.935]  It's not like Ceausescu and you just go after one person.
[01:00:07.575 --> 01:00:11.437]  It is this corrupt global entity and all of its minions.
[01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:12.957]  The globalists own the printing presses.
[01:00:14.438 --> 01:00:15.258]  They print the money.
[01:00:15.298 --> 01:00:16.578]  They buy up the world with it.
[01:00:18.299 --> 01:00:24.321]  But if the people say no and don't go along and don't give it tacit approval, it will fail.
[01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:28.442]  But does that answer your question, David, in Arizona?
[01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:30.242]  Yes, Alex.
[01:00:30.262 --> 01:00:30.683]  Can you hear me?
[01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:31.743]  Yes, I can.
[01:00:32.834 --> 01:00:33.334]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:33.554 --> 01:00:34.434]  Yeah.
[01:00:34.734 --> 01:00:39.396]  I think we need to do the same thing that the Romanians did.
[01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:42.296]  We need to drag these people out, kick them and scream them.
[01:00:42.316 --> 01:00:45.117]  People like Bittany and George Bush.
[01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:47.677]  And we need to bring charges against them.
[01:00:47.697 --> 01:00:50.998]  But my question is... I have so many questions for you.
[01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:52.498]  I'd love to ask you a million different questions.
[01:00:52.518 --> 01:00:52.838]  Do me a favor.
[01:00:52.878 --> 01:00:53.919]  Talk right into your telephone.
[01:00:54.699 --> 01:00:54.939]  Yeah.
[01:00:54.979 --> 01:00:55.759]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:56.259]  Yeah.
[01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.860]  As long as you've got the telephone behind your head, you're just kind of talking.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:00:59.720]  Yeah.
[01:01:00.586 --> 01:01:08.171]  Yeah, I think that we need to find a way to hold these people accountable for their crimes.
[01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:11.293]  Treason is punishable by death.
[01:01:12.353 --> 01:01:13.774]  That law has not been changed.
[01:01:14.995 --> 01:01:18.998]  And these people are engaged in treasonous acts.
[01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:26.903]  And I think we need to find a way to bring charges against people like Dick Cheney and George Bush.
[01:01:26.943 --> 01:01:28.023]  Yeah, I heard you when you said that.
[01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:29.044]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:01:30.282 --> 01:01:34.525]  Dick Cheney and George Bush are despicable individuals just like Bill Clinton.
[01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:40.090]  But we talk about Bill Clinton and the Bushes being in business together going back to Mena, Arkansas.
[01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.050]  Let's admit it.
[01:01:42.251 --> 01:01:46.635]  And so we first have to get past the level of, oh, the Democrats are good, they're fighting Bush.
[01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:49.177]  Or, oh, Bush is good because he's better than Clinton.
[01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:50.678]  That's staged.
[01:01:51.399 --> 01:01:55.782]  Just as staged as thinking George Bush is really running something.
[01:01:56.684 --> 01:01:58.465]  Or that his daddy was really running something.
[01:01:58.926 --> 01:02:00.727]  Or that Dick Cheney's really running something.
[01:02:00.767 --> 01:02:09.954]  They're executives over a regional governorship, one of the wealthiest plantations or holdings of the global empire.
[01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:19.301]  And so, for the crimes of the IMF and World Bank and its private shareholders, the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, should they go to jail?
[01:02:19.341 --> 01:02:20.161]  Should they get in trouble?
[01:02:20.522 --> 01:02:21.983]  Should grand juries indict them?
[01:02:22.023 --> 01:02:23.564]  Should they be arrested?
[01:02:23.604 --> 01:02:29.407]  Should they be extradited for money laundering and fraud and bid rigging and every type of scam you can imagine?
[01:02:30.008 --> 01:02:30.668]  Absolutely!
[01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:36.592]  But to say, you know, let's grab George Bush and put him on trial or something else,
[01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:40.510]  Again, that shields the globalists.
[01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:44.893]  We're still looking at their puppets as if they're the kings when they're religious puppets.
[01:02:45.613 --> 01:02:46.314]  Marionettes.
[01:02:47.795 --> 01:02:48.695]  Men on a string.
[01:02:50.696 --> 01:02:54.599]  And so, you know, that's really what it boils down to.
[01:02:54.679 --> 01:02:58.201]  Very instinctively, people think, you know, let's get violent.
[01:02:58.701 --> 01:03:03.644]  Folks, the globalists have to carry out their own terror attacks to blame them on their political enemies.
[01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:05.045]  We don't need to do that.
[01:03:06.272 --> 01:03:07.093]  They need violence.
[01:03:07.153 --> 01:03:08.394]  They want to escalate things.
[01:03:09.254 --> 01:03:09.915]  They're the bullies.
[01:03:10.975 --> 01:03:17.760]  Now, we should defend ourselves, but at the same time, again, I keep repeating, hey, Dick Cheney and George Bush are puppets, but don't we need to do something about them?
[01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:19.221]  I'm telling you, they're puppets.
[01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.804]  They're all part of this false distraction.
[01:03:22.824 --> 01:03:24.946]  And we talk about George Bush, he's evil.
[01:03:25.106 --> 01:03:26.407]  Oh, Alberto Gonzalez is evil.
[01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:28.108]  They're implementing a program.
[01:03:28.965 --> 01:03:32.907]  You talk about the street-level thug of the mob boss, or do you talk about the mob boss?
[01:03:32.927 --> 01:03:36.389]  You talk about the mob boss's captain, or do you talk about the commission?
[01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.211]  You know, where the mob bosses meet, like the Bilderberg Group.
[01:03:42.092 --> 01:03:46.934]  Alright, I mean, is there evidence enough to, you know, bring out charges and have them arrested?
[01:03:47.154 --> 01:03:47.975]  Absolutely!
[01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:54.618]  Legions of reasons, but we have to first educate the public on those legions of reasons.
[01:03:55.774 --> 01:04:01.135]  And that's why the globalists are trying to escalate us into violence before we've won the information war.
[01:04:01.555 --> 01:04:02.996]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:04:03.896 --> 01:04:09.977]  And I hear these talk show hosts and callers shoot their mouths off, and I don't mean you, you were more level-headed, but about violence.
[01:04:09.997 --> 01:04:12.858]  But I've been hearing the same callers for years calling and saying, violence, violence.
[01:04:13.298 --> 01:04:14.879]  You don't see them out involved in violence.
[01:04:14.899 --> 01:04:16.599]  They want us to go out and do it for them.
[01:04:17.879 --> 01:04:20.380]  It's very easy to, you know, beat your chest and act tough.
[01:04:21.952 --> 01:04:23.834]  You know, I'm the first person to defend myself.
[01:04:24.015 --> 01:04:31.443]  I'm the first person that if they're driving around in trucks trying to arrest people, you know, for the emergency relocation, the first person that'll say, don't go along with that.
[01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:36.869]  But I'm not the first person to shoot my mouth off about, you know, let's just start taking people out.
[01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:40.654]  Most of these cops, most of these minions are just useful idiots.
[01:04:41.332 --> 01:04:51.937]  And then most of the mid-level minions are just kind of, you know, dopes who are yes-men, who've been put in positions of power because they'll go along with what's happening, and most of them rationalize what they're doing.
[01:04:51.977 --> 01:04:53.078]  They've seared their conscience.
[01:04:53.538 --> 01:04:56.099]  It's up to us to reach out to them and show them what they're doing is wrong.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.860]  Pam in Texas.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.621]  Pam, go ahead.
[01:04:59.641 --> 01:05:00.181]  You're on the air.
[01:05:00.821 --> 01:05:01.161]  Hey.
[01:05:01.702 --> 01:05:02.282]  Hi, Alex.
[01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:08.825]  Stephanie and I were watching the news, and they said yesterday they're going to start producing plutonium again somewhere in Utah.
[01:05:09.449 --> 01:05:10.970]  Yeah, for the new mini-bombs.
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.673]  They refused to say what it was for, like we don't know, and we were just curious.
[01:05:16.693 --> 01:05:33.501]  You know, GW's coming on tonight to say something, and our fear is that, you know, since they've been talking about all these nuclear ways, I mean, the ways that all the nuclear things were stolen from Russia and everything, that we're getting into a war with Iran, or he's going to announce the draft or something.
[01:05:33.601 --> 01:05:34.782]  What do you think he's going to do?
[01:05:36.351 --> 01:05:52.776]  He's probably just going to say we need to have a big, you know, the war is good and we're going to win and he's probably just going to try to boost his approval ratings and warn us about terrorism so when the globalists carry out terrorism he can go, see I told you so and you didn't support me and now it's your fault.
[01:05:53.677 --> 01:06:00.139]  Okay and one other thing, last year a man here was beaten by a policeman and the police said
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.362]  You know, the little tapes that are over the road and everything.
[01:06:03.382 --> 01:06:06.965]  They said, we don't have to release evidence that incriminates the policemen.
[01:06:07.885 --> 01:06:13.790]  And that's kind of frightening to me, because, like, tax dollars pay for all of those little secret cameras up there.
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:17.132]  Oh yeah, everything the police do, they won't release the cameras.
[01:06:17.493 --> 01:06:20.975]  They won't release the surveillance from the squad cars or the light pole cameras.
[01:06:21.415 --> 01:06:25.478]  Whenever it's something they did, they selectively decide when they want to use it.
[01:06:25.519 --> 01:06:27.340]  And now the Chicago Tribune's reporting
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.881]  Gunshot detectors, just like Austin put up in 98, never been used to detect gunshots.
[01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:38.682]  It's a microphone, and the companies that sell it brag that it's for listening to the public.
[01:06:38.742 --> 01:06:42.123]  I mean, Pam, we are entering the depths of the police state.
[01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:47.384]  What do you think of the Supreme Court ruling on letting corporations come in and rob or bear on property?
[01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:49.444]  Oh, I'm appalled.
[01:06:49.524 --> 01:06:50.604]  I can hardly believe it.
[01:06:50.664 --> 01:06:54.745]  But then again, you know, we knew it was the next step.
[01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:57.123]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:06:57.383 --> 01:06:58.803]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:06:58.823 --> 01:07:04.386]  And then the guy said today he was going to retire, and they're going to put somebody even worse on the Supreme Court?
[01:07:05.206 --> 01:07:06.666]  Geez, we're just rude.
[01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:08.487]  Anyway, thanks for the good work, Alex.
[01:07:08.927 --> 01:07:10.268]  Well, thank you for the call, Pam.
[01:07:10.288 --> 01:07:11.669]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:11.749 --> 01:07:13.189]  Kathy in Florida, thanks for holding.
[01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:13.589]  Go ahead.
[01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:18.331]  Hi, this is Kathy, and I am just really thankful for what you're doing.
[01:07:18.351 --> 01:07:21.993]  I just recently woke up from a 20-year slumber.
[01:07:22.273 --> 01:07:23.073]  I'm a Christian.
[01:07:23.093 --> 01:07:24.874]  I voted for all the Bushes.
[01:07:25.569 --> 01:07:27.111]  I just got back from Berlin, Germany.
[01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:30.815]  I'm a missionary and I'm in Pensacola and I'm just appalled.
[01:07:30.855 --> 01:07:32.537]  I'm upset and I'm glad.
[01:07:32.898 --> 01:07:37.724]  I appreciate your passion for just saying this is wrong and we need to wake up.
[01:07:37.764 --> 01:07:39.886]  We need to stand up just like you just said earlier.
[01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:46.528]  I've been called by some of my Christian friends as being anti-American because I'm saying, hey, look at this!
[01:07:46.908 --> 01:07:50.934]  Oh yeah, if you're for private property rights, you're anti-American.
[01:07:50.974 --> 01:07:59.626]  If you criticize Bush for trying to promote the Attorney General of Alabama that went after Judge Roy Moore, if he defends the Ten Commandments, you're an evil liberal.
[01:08:00.406 --> 01:08:03.267]  If you're against genetic engineering, you're an evil liberal.
[01:08:03.287 --> 01:08:06.728]  If you're against Alberto Gonzalez because he's pro-abortion, you're a liberal.
[01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:09.910]  If you're against a $2.6 trillion budget, you're a liberal.
[01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.812]  And I've had Christian friends say, you know, yeah, this is probably going on, but I don't want to think about it.
[01:08:15.832 --> 01:08:16.752]  It's too depressing.
[01:08:17.112 --> 01:08:17.712]  Well, okay.
[01:08:17.872 --> 01:08:21.073]  Oh yeah, it is depressing, but you know, am I going to say, I'm not going to look at it?
[01:08:21.113 --> 01:08:22.174]  I'm going to go into denial?
[01:08:22.674 --> 01:08:22.914]  No.
[01:08:23.374 --> 01:08:24.175]  I'm going to do something.
[01:08:24.195 --> 01:08:24.835]  I'm going to pray.
[01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.175]  I'm going to vote better.
[01:08:26.195 --> 01:08:28.296]  I don't know if that at this point can help, but
[01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.935]  But what I can do is proclaim the truth.
[01:08:32.596 --> 01:08:38.963]  And just like you said, not get violent, but let's just wake up and let's take action as best we can.
[01:08:39.063 --> 01:08:41.066]  But you know, this is all prophesied in the Bible.
[01:08:41.506 --> 01:08:42.788]  Well, it comes down to this.
[01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.953]  The people in government are public servants.
[01:08:47.973 --> 01:08:51.197]  Servants, they are not, they're guardians of the Constitution.
[01:08:51.637 --> 01:08:54.701]  They are not officials, authorities.
[01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:57.844]  And they tell us we're civilians.
[01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:01.568]  Why are mayors calling us civilians?
[01:09:01.628 --> 01:09:04.311]  We're civilians and they're military occupiers.
[01:09:05.484 --> 01:09:10.628]  Yes they are, after Reconstruction in 1913 and the 1933 War Powers.
[01:09:10.988 --> 01:09:11.709]  We really are.
[01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:14.911]  The state police are federally issued, federally chartered.
[01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:16.432]  It is centralized.
[01:09:16.472 --> 01:09:17.453]  It is nightmarish.
[01:09:17.914 --> 01:09:19.855]  And I appreciate your call and you just keep it up.
[01:09:20.936 --> 01:09:25.419]  That's because your Republican friends see George Bush as the alternative to Bill Clinton.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:26.920]  Well just go.
[01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:28.722]  Well wait, Hillary's meeting with Rupert Murdoch.
[01:09:29.289 --> 01:09:29.749]  Well, wait.
[01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.352]  George Bush is doing all of Bill Clinton's policies.
[01:09:33.072 --> 01:09:36.775]  Because it isn't Bill Clinton's policies, it's the New World Order's policies.
[01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:38.877]  They go down the line.
[01:09:38.937 --> 01:09:39.898]  Bush is for gun control.
[01:09:39.918 --> 01:09:40.959]  Bush is for open borders.
[01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:42.881]  Bush is for national ID cards.
[01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:44.742]  Bush is for all the surveillance.
[01:09:45.423 --> 01:09:48.185]  Bush signed on to UNESCO that Ronald Reagan got us out of.
[01:09:48.746 --> 01:09:50.948]  And they're like, well, what are you for, Bill Clinton, then?
[01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:51.728]  No!
[01:09:51.808 --> 01:09:55.892]  We've got to admit, they may have bought and paid for both parties!
[01:09:58.337 --> 01:09:59.237]  Oh, it's mindless.
[01:10:00.018 --> 01:10:02.098]  It's like they're fans of a football team.
[01:10:02.138 --> 01:10:03.739]  Well, I'm not for the Redskins.
[01:10:03.839 --> 01:10:05.019]  I'm for the Dallas Cowboys.
[01:10:06.459 --> 01:10:10.680]  You know, it's like somebody rooting for a boxing match that Don King is officiating.
[01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:12.721]  You know, it's a staged event, folks.
[01:10:13.321 --> 01:10:15.062]  Either way, he owns both the fighters.
[01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:16.982]  It's a staged event.
[01:10:18.402 --> 01:10:19.183]  Ron in New York.
[01:10:19.203 --> 01:10:19.783]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:10:20.703 --> 01:10:21.043]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:26.365]  What did you think of that owner of the Freeport Western Seafood?
[01:10:28.192 --> 01:10:31.755]  Um, I'll certainly answer that question, and I hope I can get to another point.
[01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:35.157]  I think that it was typical after the decision last week.
[01:10:35.838 --> 01:10:37.939]  I think that the theft would start occurring.
[01:10:38.499 --> 01:10:43.843]  I think that this is what happens when you have a government, and I don't even want to call it a government.
[01:10:43.863 --> 01:10:45.324]  Yeah, this is lawless.
[01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:47.086]  We can rape you, we can loot you.
[01:10:47.346 --> 01:10:55.772]  Government which is beholding to private power, which is no longer the leveler of the playing field between the common citizen
[01:10:56.557 --> 01:11:02.138]  And big corporate power, which in fact is now the stooge of this big corporate power.
[01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:02.959]  That's what it's become.
[01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:08.720]  So the average citizen or the average person has nobody on their side to assist them.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.641]  I think it's inevitable.
[01:11:10.681 --> 01:11:17.542]  I think the dynamic is just a matter of summation and pure deductive logic that it was going to play out this way.
[01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.243]  That's what I think.
[01:11:19.483 --> 01:11:23.784]  Well, I unfortunately agree with you and it's going to get a lot worse and people are going to get their wake-up call.
[01:11:23.824 --> 01:11:24.604]  What else is on your mind?
[01:11:25.086 --> 01:11:31.948]  Well, I was reading an article in today's New York Sun, and there's a very interesting there, and bear with me on this.
[01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:33.968]  I think you'll see my point.
[01:11:34.609 --> 01:11:41.450]  They're talking about they had just initiated a rule in which people cannot walk between cars in the New York City subway system.
[01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:47.132]  Now, you may know this, you've been in New York, but those cars are packed like sardines, alright?
[01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:57.898]  Now they initiated that rule and they also said the newest generation of subway cars, the doors in between the cars lock at certain points around curbs and so forth.
[01:11:58.619 --> 01:12:11.350]  I'm thinking to myself, and they use this trivial reason that they're worried because last year in this big city of eight million, they had a mishap where two people had I guess gotten hurt or something happened when they were standing in between subway cars.
[01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:29.092]  If you lock those doors, and those sardine cans, and if something happens, I would think the larger overriding consideration should be terrorism, being they say the city is the number one object of terrorism, and something happens down that subway, as they themselves have said, the power structure is always saying that,
[01:12:29.873 --> 01:12:32.434]  You have people literally locked in steel coffins.
[01:12:32.874 --> 01:12:35.815]  That becomes a force and a fatality multiplier.
[01:12:35.835 --> 01:12:37.516]  Yeah, what if a gas main blows up?
[01:12:37.536 --> 01:12:38.336]  It's happened before.
[01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:39.417]  This time you're trapped.
[01:12:39.697 --> 01:12:40.477]  Right, you're trapped.
[01:12:40.497 --> 01:12:45.059]  They're training us how to be prisoners and, oh, you'll be arrested if you drink coffee now down there.
[01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:48.815]  Well, not just how to be prisoners, how to be fatalities.
[01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:51.076]  If you're trapped in those cars, Alex, you're gonna die.
[01:12:51.096 --> 01:12:53.999]  Well, that way, when the globalists nerve gas down there, they'll get a higher number.
[01:12:54.279 --> 01:13:01.124]  Right, that's exactly what I'm... that's my point, that this is a fatality multiplier, and they said... Well, it's like the public schools.
[01:13:01.384 --> 01:13:07.309]  If somebody's in the school shooting, they lock it down with prison-style doors so the shooter can kill everybody.
[01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:11.244]  This is, this is suggestive to me of something is in the wind.
[01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:15.888]  They said they're going to study this or do this for approximately six months.
[01:13:15.969 --> 01:13:22.435]  Now that might suggest to me then, it might be wise to be very cautious if you go into that system over the next six months.
[01:13:23.175 --> 01:13:24.857]  Why in Lord's, God's name?
[01:13:25.532 --> 01:13:27.314]  Would you want that more than anything, Ron?
[01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:31.397]  It's about, again, setting precedents so they can just do wild, crazy stuff.
[01:13:31.677 --> 01:13:37.342]  Setting the table for their agenda at the expense of human life.
[01:13:37.582 --> 01:13:39.244]  That's what tyranny's about, Ron, as you know.
[01:13:39.304 --> 01:13:42.486]  It's about the exercise of just blatant, raw power.
[01:13:42.546 --> 01:13:43.207]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:43.927 --> 01:13:44.908]  Dave in Colorado.
[01:13:44.928 --> 01:13:45.469]  You're on the air.
[01:13:45.509 --> 01:13:46.169]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:48.271]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:49.132]  Yes, Dave.
[01:13:49.719 --> 01:13:50.760]  Hi, good to talk to you.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.183]  I wanted to relate a story my wife has experienced here.
[01:13:54.243 --> 01:14:00.128]  She's in the medical field at a hospital here in Denver and she's involved with birth certificates.
[01:14:00.849 --> 01:14:05.053]  So they had a little seminar at the Colorado Department of Vital Records.
[01:14:05.813 --> 01:14:16.042]  So their employees go down there and of course there's a Homeland Security official there who starts getting fingerprints from everyone and saying that they're going to use the biometric system
[01:14:17.372 --> 01:14:21.486]  You know, access records, because they claim the terrorists used birth certificates to...
[01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:24.243]  falsify this and that to get in the country.
[01:14:24.283 --> 01:14:26.025]  So now they've got to get digital fingerprints.
[01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:29.787]  Yeah, and it's proven at the hospital that they're running into problems with the biometrics.
[01:14:29.807 --> 01:14:40.374]  And that'll be, I'd already read about this a few months ago, I'm glad you mentioned it, I never even got to it on air, now this will be everybody enrolled biometrically for the cash flow society at birth.
[01:14:40.714 --> 01:14:47.499]  And this Homeland Security official stated to everyone at the meeting that by 2008 we will all have our national ID cards.
[01:14:47.979 --> 01:14:49.320]  Well that's, they passed the law.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.741]  In fact, I'm glad you mentioned this.
[01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:59.761]  Last night I was at the movie showing and a fellow named Rocky gave me this Palm Beach Tan finger scan recognition from Austin, Texas.
[01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:01.422]  They're doing this all over the country.
[01:15:01.782 --> 01:15:08.365]  When you sign up with Palm Beach Tan, it verifies your government issued photo ID and links it with your finger scan signature in our computer.
[01:15:08.785 --> 01:15:12.726]  Your finger scan becomes the password for your Palm Beach Tan account.
[01:15:13.427 --> 01:15:13.607]  Hmm.
[01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:14.587]  So there you are.
[01:15:19.237 --> 01:15:24.665]  My wife said that they, with the biometric scan that they have for prescription drugs, that they already have some biometrics.
[01:15:24.725 --> 01:15:26.427]  In fact, she has a locator at the hospital.
[01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:29.111]  They know where she's at, almost everywhere in that hospital.
[01:15:29.912 --> 01:15:30.853]  And what they do is,
[01:15:31.929 --> 01:15:37.974]  He said if you do gardening work, or you work on your mechanic, you get oil on your fingers, the system doesn't operate correctly.
[01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.456]  It doesn't, it messes up the thing.
[01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:40.136]  It's everywhere!
[01:15:40.176 --> 01:15:42.418]  I mean, it just suddenly, it's popping up everywhere.
[01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:42.759]  Yeah.
[01:15:42.879 --> 01:15:47.283]  Thumb scanners and finger scanners everywhere, and it's just going in.
[01:15:47.683 --> 01:15:50.225]  No one wants it, but they're just doing it as usual.
[01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:50.766]  Right.
[01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:57.792]  I mean, I just, I was in Georgia, and I just, and after listening to your show for a year and a half, and by the way, my wife was skeptical at first when I started.
[01:15:58.362 --> 01:16:01.223]  Telling her about the information I got through your show.
[01:16:01.243 --> 01:16:04.764]  That's our power, is that we're telling the truth so we can forecast.
[01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:05.784]  People don't listen.
[01:16:06.464 --> 01:16:07.205]  Well, they do listen.
[01:16:07.225 --> 01:16:07.945]  They don't believe it.
[01:16:08.025 --> 01:16:10.665]  Then when it happens to them, light bulbs go on.
[01:16:10.826 --> 01:16:13.146]  I've made a point of telling my family about everything.
[01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:15.927]  And the other day, a couple months back, when they started highlighting the
[01:16:16.437 --> 01:16:18.538]  New bill for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:16:18.558 --> 01:16:22.460]  20 years if you're in the country, they all looked at me with their mouths open, shocked.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.161]  And now my wife is convinced that things are happening.
[01:16:25.241 --> 01:16:28.203]  I mean, after seeing all this and hearing me talk about it.
[01:16:28.223 --> 01:16:29.383]  But I was just in Georgia.
[01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:34.906]  And I drove by the Colorado State Patrol and an Army National Guard, sharing the office together.
[01:16:36.486 --> 01:16:36.927]  Everywhere?
[01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:37.127]  Yeah.
[01:16:37.147 --> 01:16:39.128]  They're merging the military with the police?
[01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:39.588]  Sure.
[01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:41.469]  Good to talk to you.
[01:16:41.529 --> 01:16:43.850]  Always love your country, never trust your government, Alex.
[01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:45.170]  Oh, Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:45.411 --> 01:16:46.071]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:47.863]  Absolutely.
[01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.427]  I mean, it's coming down.
[01:16:49.447 --> 01:16:51.573]  I want to ask the cops something.
[01:16:51.593 --> 01:16:52.536]  Do you love your children?
[01:16:52.556 --> 01:16:54.060]  Because your bosses are enslaving them.

[01:17:29.531 --> 01:17:36.738]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:25:16.002 --> 01:25:25.088]  By Freeport, Texas, to give $6 million to a wealthy developer and take private property that's been there for 50 years.
[01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:27.430]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:28.791]  They built a marina.
[01:25:30.071 --> 01:25:34.174]  And all over the place the news is now admitting the Pan-American Union is being formed.
[01:25:34.194 --> 01:25:38.137]  I mean, this is all the bizarre stuff that's happening, all the weird stuff that's going on.
[01:25:39.758 --> 01:25:41.699]  And it's totally and completely out of control.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.281]  And it's gotta be stopped.
[01:25:44.401 --> 01:25:45.642]  We need to stop it now.
[01:25:47.359 --> 01:25:50.862]  I got just a bunch of news coming up, but right now, let's keep going back to your calls.
[01:25:50.882 --> 01:25:51.883]  They're always so interesting.
[01:25:52.463 --> 01:25:53.944]  Let's go to Kentucky first.

[01:25:57.827 --> 01:25:59.488]  Two calls in a row from Alaska.
[01:25:59.608 --> 01:26:00.569]  I've never seen that before.
[01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:03.511]  Let's talk to Jamie in Kentucky.
[01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:04.212]  Jamie, go ahead.
[01:26:04.452 --> 01:26:05.052]  Hello, Alex.
[01:26:05.413 --> 01:26:05.653]  Hi.
[01:26:06.273 --> 01:26:09.716]  This New World Order thing is
[01:26:13.792 --> 01:26:20.957]  It says about it in the Bible, and it's about the end times, and I do believe we're in the end times.
[01:26:22.398 --> 01:26:27.442]  This is just my point of view.
[01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:30.685]  I don't believe we can stop these people.
[01:26:33.427 --> 01:26:42.994]  Well, listen, regardless of whether we can stop it or not, do we have a job to save an old lady in a burning house?
[01:26:44.059 --> 01:26:44.199]  Yes.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.463]  Do we have a moral responsibility to speak out against abortion?
[01:26:48.483 --> 01:26:49.304]  Yes.
[01:26:50.445 --> 01:26:57.010]  We have a moral responsibility to expose the fact that depleted uranium is bad for the troops?
[01:26:57.431 --> 01:26:57.631]  Yes.
[01:26:58.752 --> 01:27:01.814]  Well, I mean, you know, duty is mine, consequences belong to God.
[01:27:02.775 --> 01:27:02.955]  Right.
[01:27:03.155 --> 01:27:04.617]  As the founders said many times.
[01:27:04.817 --> 01:27:09.781]  And, number one, sir, ten years ago, the majority of Americans were pro-abortion.
[01:27:09.801 --> 01:27:11.703]  Did you know it is the exact opposite today?
[01:27:13.439 --> 01:27:14.360]  So we're winning that fight.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.341]  Abortion is actually down now.
[01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:17.302]  One is too many.
[01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:25.968]  But with all the media saying it's great, and all the media saying do it, most of the mainstream media, it's still backfiring.
[01:27:26.028 --> 01:27:27.769]  So we're having a lot of victories.
[01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.010]  We're also having a lot of defeats.
[01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:32.352]  Now, they thought Hitler was the Antichrist.
[01:27:32.392 --> 01:27:34.974]  People said lay down to him.
[01:27:35.434 --> 01:27:38.817]  Africans in Africa have thought Idi Amin and people were the Antichrist.
[01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:39.277]  He wasn't.
[01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:50.716]  Certainly evil is growing and bad things are happening, but you know, it's like, uh, oh, where did, uh, where did Jonah get spit out?
[01:27:50.776 --> 01:27:52.517]  What was the country he got spit out on?
[01:27:52.557 --> 01:27:57.099]  And he, uh, and, and, and they repented of their evil ways and got a hundred year reprieve.
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:27:59.560]  So.
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.241]  Alex, before I go, I got another question.
[01:28:02.821 --> 01:28:03.502]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:28:04.022 --> 01:28:04.382]  Okay.
[01:28:04.502 --> 01:28:08.384]  Uh, sorry to interrupt you about it, but, uh,
[01:28:09.281 --> 01:28:19.008]  I believe that this world in the predicament at the end right now, there's going to be an uprising by the people that's waking up.
[01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:21.770]  And there's going to be something.
[01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:24.652]  Now this is a new revolution war if you ask me.
[01:28:24.712 --> 01:28:25.912]  Well things are being done.
[01:28:25.953 --> 01:28:27.674]  It's just the world's a big place.
[01:28:27.834 --> 01:28:29.435]  Millions of people are taking action.
[01:28:29.455 --> 01:28:33.057]  We're having millions of victories every day and millions of defeats every day.
[01:28:34.098 --> 01:28:36.600]  And it's lack of knowledge that's leading to our defeats.
[01:28:38.707 --> 01:28:49.571]  And I tell you what, I'm gonna watch Hitler on the TV tonight, and I'm gonna count how many lies I have my piece of paper beside me.
[01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:51.192]  You're talking about Lord Bush?
[01:28:51.852 --> 01:28:54.013]  Hitler, or what, Lord Bush?
[01:28:54.493 --> 01:28:56.734]  He's another Hitler rising, if you ask me.
[01:28:57.175 --> 01:29:01.296]  Well, he's just a moronic puppet, but yeah, he does represent a Hitlerian system.
[01:29:01.316 --> 01:29:01.936]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:02.056 --> 01:29:02.557]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:03.257]  Yeah, good.
[01:29:03.297 --> 01:29:07.999]  Interesting points, but I mean, you made a profound statement about, you know, we can't stop this.
[01:29:09.483 --> 01:29:14.507]  We have a place in history to shape events and to wake people up.
[01:29:15.008 --> 01:29:20.412]  You know, maybe we're all going to die and the Antichrist is going to eat us one by one, but at least we can save people's souls.
[01:29:21.353 --> 01:29:22.654]  At least we can reach out to them.
[01:29:23.294 --> 01:29:26.257]  I mean, if we don't tell them microchips under the skin are bad, they're going to take them.
[01:29:26.517 --> 01:29:30.140]  I got an article today where Fox News is, well, people just don't like it.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.141]  They're just backwards.
[01:29:31.341 --> 01:29:32.782]  Everybody needs a microchip.
[01:29:32.802 --> 01:29:34.604]  I mean, that's today.
[01:29:35.304 --> 01:29:36.305]  Oh, so conservative.
[01:29:37.051 --> 01:29:38.032]  What about Andy Rooney?
[01:29:38.092 --> 01:29:40.434]  Everybody needs a microchip under their skin.
[01:29:40.454 --> 01:29:40.795]  60 minutes.
[01:29:41.696 --> 01:29:41.936]  What?
[01:29:41.956 --> 01:29:43.938]  I mean, they're the kooks.
[01:29:48.712 --> 01:29:55.555]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:29:55.855 --> 01:29:57.235]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:29:57.435 --> 01:29:59.656]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:29:59.796 --> 01:30:01.877]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:30:02.157 --> 01:30:07.099]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:30:07.419 --> 01:30:11.461]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:30:11.721 --> 01:30:13.483]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:30:13.563 --> 01:30:24.215]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:30:24.376 --> 01:30:26.238]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:30:26.578 --> 01:30:30.301]  Order your copy on DHS or DB today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:30:30.421 --> 01:30:31.982]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:30:47.987 --> 01:30:51.249]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:30:51.289 --> 01:30:55.492]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:30:55.732 --> 01:30:58.514]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:30:58.714 --> 01:31:01.116]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:31:01.316 --> 01:31:04.258]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90
[01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.139]  We're good to go!
[01:31:24.386 --> 01:31:25.267]  That's right.
[01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:50.966]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:51.546]  Why?
[01:31:51.886 --> 01:31:54.508]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:32:48.425 --> 01:32:53.449]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:56.132]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:57.633 --> 01:33:02.657]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into this third hour on this live Tuesday, June 28th edition.
[01:33:03.398 --> 01:33:07.862]  I love taking your calls because you take us in so many different directions and bring up so many important news items.
[01:33:08.322 --> 01:33:12.986]  Let's rampage through five of your calls quickly and then plunge into the news and back into calls.
[01:33:14.116 --> 01:33:17.557]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill up north in Alaska.
[01:33:17.597 --> 01:33:18.277]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:33:19.597 --> 01:33:19.857]  Alex?
[01:33:20.337 --> 01:33:20.537]  Yes, sir?
[01:33:20.577 --> 01:33:22.197]  Homeland Security reporting in.
[01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:23.598]  Oh, good.
[01:33:23.618 --> 01:33:24.678]  The real Homeland Security.
[01:33:24.698 --> 01:33:25.158]  How you been?
[01:33:26.018 --> 01:33:30.119]  I wanted to tell you the silver lining on this cloud.
[01:33:30.779 --> 01:33:42.701]  The ink wasn't dry on that majority decision in the court before our legislature up here had attacked that and decided to legislate against that.
[01:33:43.904 --> 01:33:56.648]  Both in Anchorage, the municipality... And again, for stations that just joined us, you're talking about all the Supreme Court ruling that a private corporation or company wants to pay off the politicians to take property, it happens.
[01:33:57.108 --> 01:33:57.428]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:58.328 --> 01:34:06.571]  And the Anchorage Daily News is carrying the story under the heading of Lawmakers Target Imminent Domain, for anybody that wants to read the article.
[01:34:08.707 --> 01:34:10.328]  Uh, they responded immediately.
[01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:12.529]  Yeah, they're introducing a bill here in Texas, too.
[01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:15.571]  I'm swelling with pride that this is the top state of mind.
[01:34:16.552 --> 01:34:18.453]  But that's pretty much all I wanted to say.
[01:34:18.613 --> 01:34:21.254]  Anarchy has started at the top this time.
[01:34:21.314 --> 01:34:23.136]  I don't know another time in history.
[01:34:23.176 --> 01:34:23.736]  No, you're right.
[01:34:23.756 --> 01:34:31.240]  This is lawless raping, pillaging, looting, booty taking, prize money taking.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.361]  This is admiralty.
[01:34:32.401 --> 01:34:35.243]  This is just the big dog can seize anything they want.
[01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.664]  This is just classical despotism.
[01:34:38.348 --> 01:34:42.069]  Well, I needed to refer to that fellow that called just before me, too.
[01:34:42.129 --> 01:34:44.769]  He's got a puny God, if he thinks that that's the way it is.
[01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:48.990]  Well, respond specifically to what he said, so people can respond.
[01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.651]  Okay, yeah.
[01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:55.772]  He was worried about not being able to stop the power.
[01:34:57.212 --> 01:35:06.274]  One person with the right spirit in him holds more power than the standing armies of this world, if they're following after the God that I serve.
[01:35:07.745 --> 01:35:08.926]  And I'll let it go at that.
[01:35:10.226 --> 01:35:12.167]  Well, I appreciate your call, and God bless you.
[01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:15.048]  You know, I was on with Tex Mars a few weeks ago.
[01:35:15.929 --> 01:35:17.229]  He sent me a tape of the broadcast.
[01:35:17.289 --> 01:35:17.849]  Nice fella.
[01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:21.191]  My last broadcast with Tex Mars, and it's scary to me.
[01:35:22.712 --> 01:35:23.872]  I mean, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.614]  I have had personal experiences with Jesus Christ.
[01:35:28.314 --> 01:35:31.676]  You know, God hasn't appeared to me, but I mean, I felt the Spirit of the Lord.
[01:35:32.296 --> 01:35:34.797]  In my life, I've seen incredible things happen.
[01:35:36.377 --> 01:35:38.778]  I know I've been protected over and over again in my life.
[01:35:38.818 --> 01:35:42.439]  I mean, just the incredible things I've seen, the experiences I've had in my life.
[01:35:42.459 --> 01:35:45.999]  I mean, I've lived already at 31 years of age, a pretty full life.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:54.161]  And I've talked about it, you know, my whole life, quietly to friends and family.
[01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:56.402]  And I know it's not coincidence.
[01:35:57.022 --> 01:35:57.722]  And it's scary.
[01:35:57.742 --> 01:35:59.303]  Because I know I'm a sinner.
[01:35:59.363 --> 01:36:00.103]  Folks, I'm bad.
[01:36:00.983 --> 01:36:03.924]  I mean, I really, you know, I have a lot of evil in me.
[01:36:04.877 --> 01:36:08.059]  I belong to God, I got God's seal on me, but we're all sinners.
[01:36:08.079 --> 01:36:10.721]  You know, King David was a sinner.
[01:36:11.622 --> 01:36:19.167]  I mean, he had a man murdered because he lusted after the man's wife, but he repented and was a man after God's own heart.
[01:36:21.588 --> 01:36:24.330]  I know that I'm a sinner, and I fear God.
[01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:27.472]  They say the beginning of fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[01:36:27.492 --> 01:36:28.333]  Well, what's fear of the devil?
[01:36:28.353 --> 01:36:29.373]  The beginning of foolishness.
[01:36:30.274 --> 01:36:33.336]  I'm more afraid of God because there is a law of nature.
[01:36:34.443 --> 01:36:36.484]  I don't believe in reincarnation and karma.
[01:36:36.885 --> 01:36:39.206]  That's kind of a counterfeit, but you know, what is karma?
[01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:40.287]  You know, you reap what you sow.
[01:36:42.788 --> 01:36:46.911]  I do believe in you reap what you sow, but all cultures have this reap what you sow term.
[01:36:48.432 --> 01:36:54.876]  Every time I've done something wrong in my life, and my conscience has said don't do it, but I couldn't control myself and I did.
[01:36:55.857 --> 01:36:57.818]  It has come back to bite me in the hind end.
[01:36:59.497 --> 01:37:05.103]  And all I pray to God every day is that He leave God and direct me and use me as a vessel and help me be a good person.
[01:37:05.283 --> 01:37:05.843]  I need help.
[01:37:06.644 --> 01:37:07.845]  I'm not good.
[01:37:08.026 --> 01:37:09.847]  We are a fallen creation.
[01:37:10.708 --> 01:37:11.990]  But we are made in the image of God.
[01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.911]  We are creators.
[01:37:12.931 --> 01:37:16.554]  I mean, what we imagine 50 years later becomes reality.
[01:37:16.574 --> 01:37:17.275]  We're incredible.
[01:37:18.308 --> 01:37:21.570]  Life is so magical, so wonderful, so beautiful.
[01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:24.252]  There's just so much that is going on.
[01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:27.414]  The beauty of just a tree, the stars.
[01:37:27.454 --> 01:37:30.516]  I was looking at Jupiter and its moon Titan last night.
[01:37:30.536 --> 01:37:32.678]  I mean, it's just, things are so amazing.
[01:37:32.738 --> 01:37:33.839]  Life is so precious.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:36.881]  But I've got to tell people something.
[01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:38.182]  I've seen it.
[01:37:38.682 --> 01:37:44.846]  I don't want to go into it, but growing up, if somebody did something wrong to me, bad things would happen to them.
[01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:47.568]  I would even wish harm upon them, bad things would happen.
[01:37:48.485 --> 01:37:49.966]  So many people that have attacked me.
[01:37:49.986 --> 01:37:54.148]  I later found out that five people, excuse me, four people that attacked me.
[01:37:54.989 --> 01:37:55.849]  One other onlooker.
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:59.712]  You know, really bad things happened to all four of them.
[01:38:00.052 --> 01:38:00.852]  Very soon after.
[01:38:00.872 --> 01:38:03.014]  I mean weird stuff, folks.
[01:38:03.054 --> 01:38:04.455]  I mean automobile accidents.
[01:38:05.555 --> 01:38:10.138]  You know, electrocution, things falling on them.
[01:38:11.559 --> 01:38:16.882]  I could list a string of people that as soon as they come out and premeditatedly attack me with hatred,
[01:38:18.348 --> 01:38:19.809]  You wonder why the New World Order hadn't killed me?
[01:38:20.129 --> 01:38:22.730]  Because God has a plan, and you can get that same protection.
[01:38:23.051 --> 01:38:27.433]  I mean, it's scary, folks, and I'm not trying to get into, you know, magical stuff and all this here.
[01:38:27.513 --> 01:38:30.774]  I just have seen it, and I am scared to death of God.
[01:38:30.834 --> 01:38:31.755]  I also love God.
[01:38:32.695 --> 01:38:34.776]  But, I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, folks.
[01:38:35.056 --> 01:38:36.717]  I know I am protected.
[01:38:37.618 --> 01:38:40.619]  And I do believe the Bible, and I do believe God has angels around me.
[01:38:41.519 --> 01:38:42.200]  I mean, I know.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.241]  I've experienced it, folks.
[01:38:49.113 --> 01:38:52.115]  You know, that's just a word to the wise, the people out there that are attacking me.
[01:38:52.975 --> 01:39:00.199]  I mean, I feel like I should warn you, uh, that, uh, I mean, I haven't seen it yet where somebody doesn't get seriously hurt.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360]  Seriously hurt.
[01:39:04.001 --> 01:39:07.022]  Who really, viciously, premeditatedly attacks me.
[01:39:08.003 --> 01:39:10.804]  And, uh, look, I just...
[01:39:11.758 --> 01:39:14.399]  And chances are, if you're attacking me, you're attacking other people.
[01:39:14.819 --> 01:39:16.760]  That God doesn't want to be attacked.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.461]  It's a bad, bad thing over your head.
[01:39:19.481 --> 01:39:22.422]  You know, the sword of Damocles.
[01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:29.044]  We know what happened with the founding fathers and the incredible divine providence that surrounded them.
[01:39:33.345 --> 01:39:37.187]  To blow it down, folks, you really don't want to go up against God's people.
[01:39:37.247 --> 01:39:38.167]  You will be cursed.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.562]  And, uh, I'm not wishing you to be cursed.
[01:39:43.003 --> 01:39:59.056]  Uh, but... You know, where there's smoke, there's fire, and I, I just, if I rattled off the chain of, uh, horrible things that have happened to people that have attacked me, I mean, there, you know, there's a reason the New World Order leaves me alone.
[01:40:00.437 --> 01:40:02.099]  Uh, if you really want to get down to it.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:08.264]  And, uh, I have, it is, it is humbling, it is frightening,
[01:40:09.483 --> 01:40:11.825]  And I just am scared to death of God.
[01:40:12.645 --> 01:40:13.546]  And you should be, too.
[01:40:14.587 --> 01:40:16.929]  The New World Order should be.
[01:40:16.989 --> 01:40:19.411]  The New World Order, they have hellish lives.
[01:40:19.431 --> 01:40:20.592]  They're very unhappy people.
[01:40:20.772 --> 01:40:24.095]  Bad things happen to them because of the things they do.
[01:40:24.436 --> 01:40:25.737]  Everything comes with a price.
[01:40:26.898 --> 01:40:29.040]  For every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.001]  That's just the way the universe works.
[01:40:31.041 --> 01:40:32.162]  That's how God set it up.
[01:40:32.823 --> 01:40:34.785]  And I don't want to get off into preaching here, but
[01:40:37.458 --> 01:40:39.719]  I don't have fear of the New World Order.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:45.182]  Occasionally I have a pang of fear and then it dissipates.
[01:40:45.282 --> 01:40:50.825]  When I think about God Almighty on the throne, I literally quiver.
[01:40:51.465 --> 01:40:58.689]  The hair on the back of my neck standing up right now, I can feel the presence of God and God's agents.
[01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:00.710]  I can feel it all around me.
[01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:08.948]  It makes me feel like really a pathetic, uh, I mean, I don't even deserve to be so blessed.
[01:41:09.548 --> 01:41:09.948]  But you know what?
[01:41:10.008 --> 01:41:11.188]  I'm thankful every day.
[01:41:12.789 --> 01:41:19.890]  And you know, the day I die, the day I'm gunned down, the day I'm killed, if that happens, I'm not saying that's going to happen, it's the day God wants it to happen and it's in that plan.
[01:41:20.651 --> 01:41:24.572]  And people who've been in combat will tell you this, you know, the people that, you know, what they call it, charmed.
[01:41:25.572 --> 01:41:28.112]  They know there's a tripwire 50 yards up there.
[01:41:28.152 --> 01:41:30.113]  They don't know why, but it's been documented.
[01:41:31.158 --> 01:41:31.979]  There's something else.
[01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:32.819]  The sixth sense.
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:33.480]  God's given it.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:40.766]  You know, the aborigines in the opal and diamond mines of Australia.
[01:41:40.966 --> 01:41:46.811]  This has been documented by major professors and it's even been on major scientific reports.
[01:41:47.151 --> 01:41:48.172]  They'll come out of the mine.
[01:41:48.192 --> 01:41:50.113]  They'll say, get me out of the mine, my 12-hour shift.
[01:41:50.133 --> 01:41:51.935]  They'll come up and say, my mother just died.
[01:41:55.697 --> 01:41:56.918]  You know, my father just died.
[01:41:56.958 --> 01:41:57.659]  And they don't argue.
[01:41:57.679 --> 01:42:01.262]  They put him on a helicopter and fly him 400 miles back to their village.
[01:42:01.842 --> 01:42:02.643]  And Mama died.
[01:42:03.063 --> 01:42:03.824]  Or Mama's sick.
[01:42:05.025 --> 01:42:05.865]  And they're never wrong.
[01:42:05.905 --> 01:42:07.326]  I mean, what is that, folks?
[01:42:07.427 --> 01:42:09.008]  That's the connection we have.
[01:42:09.528 --> 01:42:11.210]  This is a spiritual universe.
[01:42:11.230 --> 01:42:11.490]  This is real.
[01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:18.485]  I knew when I was three years old that God had a mission for me.
[01:42:19.065 --> 01:42:24.870]  I had an experience in the backyard on a sunny day where I actually felt it was so extreme.
[01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:26.711]  I had all these adult thoughts.
[01:42:26.831 --> 01:42:28.312]  I saw history before me.
[01:42:28.332 --> 01:42:34.877]  I literally saw the future and it's not something I can control.
[01:42:34.897 --> 01:42:40.761]  It's something you suppress and then it happens later.
[01:42:42.387 --> 01:42:43.508]  It comes back to you later.
[01:42:43.728 --> 01:42:45.749]  I had these recurring dreams as a child.
[01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:49.471]  I knew that I had a mission.
[01:42:49.591 --> 01:42:52.652]  And I didn't know even specifically what the details of that mission were.
[01:42:54.133 --> 01:42:55.454]  And I've always had discernment.
[01:42:57.155 --> 01:43:01.717]  And I know we're headed into really hard times, but it is a separation process.
[01:43:01.777 --> 01:43:05.159]  It is separating the impure metals from the pure metal.
[01:43:05.639 --> 01:43:07.420]  It is separating the wheat from the chaff.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:08.981]  The goats from the sheep.
[01:43:09.875 --> 01:43:12.017]  And I just, folks, get on the right side.
[01:43:12.057 --> 01:43:13.178]  Get on the side with God.
[01:43:13.278 --> 01:43:14.699]  Do not be on the dark side.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.940]  You think it gives you power.
[01:43:17.601 --> 01:43:19.823]  You think you're afraid of the dark side.
[01:43:19.843 --> 01:43:20.463]  Many of you are.
[01:43:20.503 --> 01:43:22.705]  So you decide to serve it out of fear.
[01:43:22.725 --> 01:43:24.046]  You decide to serve the bullies.
[01:43:24.526 --> 01:43:25.427]  They are so evil.
[01:43:25.447 --> 01:43:26.127]  They are rotten.
[01:43:26.147 --> 01:43:27.048]  They are stinking.
[01:43:27.348 --> 01:43:28.549]  Heaps of rotten flesh.
[01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:32.873]  If you could only see what I see with my eyes.
[01:43:32.893 --> 01:43:34.494]  You would instantly fight the New World War.
[01:43:34.514 --> 01:43:35.855]  You would instantly get rid of your fear.
[01:43:37.632 --> 01:43:39.113]  Life is so short, folks.
[01:43:39.133 --> 01:43:40.394]  We're all going to wake up dead.
[01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:41.835]  We're all going to die so fast.
[01:43:41.975 --> 01:43:42.876]  Life is so short.
[01:43:42.896 --> 01:43:48.939]  You're going to wake up, you're going to be 85, 90 years old, and you want to look back on it and know you lived a good life.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.822]  You lived a good life of righteousness, not of self-engrisement.
[01:43:53.462 --> 01:43:54.143]  And we all do it.
[01:43:54.283 --> 01:43:54.883]  None of us are perfect.
[01:43:54.923 --> 01:43:56.344]  I'm not throwing stones.
[01:43:56.444 --> 01:43:57.625]  I'm not judging you.
[01:43:58.025 --> 01:43:59.066]  I'm just warning you.
[01:44:00.905 --> 01:44:02.086]  There is an afterlife.
[01:44:02.326 --> 01:44:03.287]  This is real.
[01:44:03.767 --> 01:44:04.408]  I've seen it.
[01:44:04.948 --> 01:44:06.389]  I'm not going to go any further.
[01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:08.711]  Believe me, folks, I've seen it.
[01:44:10.233 --> 01:44:10.613]  Okay?
[01:44:11.233 --> 01:44:12.454]  I've seen the other side.
[01:44:13.575 --> 01:44:13.895]  Okay?
[01:44:13.935 --> 01:44:15.357]  It's all around us.
[01:44:16.738 --> 01:44:17.478]  Believe me.
[01:44:17.558 --> 01:44:18.939]  You know in your guts it's true.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:27.186]  And to all the corrupt bureaucrats and all the servants of evil, to all of you, stop being involved in what you're involved in.
[01:44:27.266 --> 01:44:27.807]  Repent.
[01:44:28.587 --> 01:44:29.348]  Come out of her.
[01:44:30.623 --> 01:44:31.984]  Come out of your false churches.
[01:44:32.064 --> 01:44:34.045]  Come out of your mafia systems.
[01:44:34.526 --> 01:44:35.866]  Stop abusing the innocent.
[01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:38.488]  Stop being greedy bullies.
[01:44:40.349 --> 01:44:42.831]  Believe me, you're not going to have to wait until you die, folks.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:46.313]  You're going to be judged in this life, as well as the after.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.484]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:44:52.825 --> 01:45:01.656]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:45:01.977 --> 01:45:06.643]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:45:07.103 --> 01:45:13.826]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:45:14.226 --> 01:45:25.992]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:45:26.492 --> 01:45:30.937]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:46:22.839 --> 01:46:23.119]  I'm good.
[01:46:49.071 --> 01:46:50.332]  Currency devaluation.
[01:46:51.152 --> 01:46:51.692]  Inflation.
[01:46:52.373 --> 01:46:53.093]  One and the same.
[01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:58.777]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:46:58.837 --> 01:47:01.279]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:47:01.319 --> 01:47:02.139]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:47:02.199 --> 01:47:03.860]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:19.232]  Here is reality.
[01:47:19.572 --> 01:47:23.114]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:47:24.255 --> 01:47:27.937]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:47:28.678 --> 01:47:32.540]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:49:02.368 --> 01:49:05.051]  Magic devices, you've got to trust in God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:08.153]  And trust in goodness and decency and love.
[01:49:08.874 --> 01:49:09.875]  Overcome the darkness.
[01:49:09.915 --> 01:49:11.456]  And I'm not going to... I'm done with my preaching.
[01:49:11.916 --> 01:49:15.880]  I'm going to give each caller just a minute or so, because I've got to get to all these calls and get to the rest of the news.
[01:49:16.661 --> 01:49:19.823]  But right now, let's go to James, another caller from Alaska.
[01:49:19.883 --> 01:49:20.644]  James, go ahead.
[01:49:20.664 --> 01:49:22.025]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:49:22.345 --> 01:49:22.606]  Good.
[01:49:23.126 --> 01:49:23.426]  Oh, good.
[01:49:23.446 --> 01:49:28.691]  I'm glad to hear from Bill that our legislature can read the plain languages in the Constitution.
[01:49:30.313 --> 01:49:31.454]  Well, the common law, too.
[01:49:31.514 --> 01:49:33.616]  I mean, you know, private property is private property.
[01:49:33.636 --> 01:49:33.896]  Go ahead.
[01:49:34.217 --> 01:49:34.457]  Okay.
[01:49:34.797 --> 01:49:38.881]  And your previous little diatribe there, the force is with you.
[01:49:38.941 --> 01:49:40.683]  I really love your theme song.
[01:49:40.743 --> 01:49:44.366]  Hey, Alex... Oh, I wouldn't say that force, but yeah.
[01:49:44.787 --> 01:49:47.369]  Well, no, the white side of the force.
[01:49:47.429 --> 01:49:53.435]  Oh, anyways, do you guys have any plans on transferring your videos to DVDs, the earlier ones?
[01:49:53.954 --> 01:49:57.256]  Most of my, a lot of my videos are on DVD, but I don't burn DVDs.
[01:49:57.316 --> 01:50:05.042]  I have them stamped industrially, and I plan to add extras sometime to the films and release them, or I might just release DVDs without extras.
[01:50:05.602 --> 01:50:08.564]  It's just I've been so darn busy, but yes, probably.
[01:50:08.604 --> 01:50:10.846]  But hey, VHS is still pretty good, folks.
[01:50:11.046 --> 01:50:11.886]  Yeah, it's not too bad.
[01:50:11.966 --> 01:50:12.427]  Also, I was
[01:50:13.405 --> 01:50:19.826]  I just got a video from, I don't know, it was a Straw Cutters video, an interview with Kay Griggs.
[01:50:20.186 --> 01:50:23.867]  I looked on your site, I didn't see any references.
[01:50:23.887 --> 01:50:24.627]  Yeah, we've mentioned it.
[01:50:24.667 --> 01:50:27.728]  I mean, she says that there's basically a homosexual cult in the Pentagon.
[01:50:27.768 --> 01:50:28.628]  Everybody knows that.
[01:50:28.648 --> 01:50:31.048]  The White House is run by homosexuals.
[01:50:31.108 --> 01:50:33.429]  I don't really... So, yeah, I've seen the interview.
[01:50:33.449 --> 01:50:34.089]  You were part of it.
[01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.849]  Gosh, it's long.
[01:50:35.969 --> 01:50:40.690]  Did you hear Paul Harvey's advocation of nuclear option in the Middle East last Thursday?
[01:50:41.872 --> 01:50:45.936]  No, so now they're... Oh, so let's just start nuking countries because they're not submitting.
[01:50:45.956 --> 01:50:46.736]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:50:46.996 --> 01:50:47.897]  Yeah, that's what I said, too.
[01:50:47.937 --> 01:50:50.459]  Meanwhile, North Korea and China are threatening us on a daily basis.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.423]  Yeah, hey, I was wondering if you... what type of video production equipment?
[01:50:54.503 --> 01:50:56.344]  I could talk to the person that does that.
[01:50:56.364 --> 01:51:01.509]  I might be... I'd be interested in perhaps expanding your audience a little bit more if I could talk to...
[01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:03.740]  I don't quite get what you're saying.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:10.105]  Well, you know, you use video equipment to, or video production suite to create your videos.
[01:51:10.345 --> 01:51:11.826]  Yeah, we got Final Cut Pro.
[01:51:11.846 --> 01:51:13.127]  Yeah, cool.
[01:51:13.167 --> 01:51:16.229]  Well, man, that would mesh in just perfect.
[01:51:16.549 --> 01:51:17.510]  Who could I talk to?
[01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:20.472]  Sorry, I'm not sure what you want to talk to me about.
[01:51:21.452 --> 01:51:29.276]  I'd like to help you get an interview on a program that doesn't normally carry your type of information.
[01:51:29.356 --> 01:51:31.056]  Oh, get me on some computer show?
[01:51:31.516 --> 01:51:33.557]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:34.018 --> 01:51:35.058]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:35.078 --> 01:51:36.539]  Let me give you the phone number to my office.
[01:51:36.679 --> 01:51:40.040]  It's 512-291-5750.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.161]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[01:51:42.201 --> 01:51:42.961]  John, go ahead.
[01:51:42.981 --> 01:51:45.182]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:51:45.582 --> 01:51:46.143]  Hi, John.
[01:51:46.403 --> 01:51:46.903]  How are you?
[01:51:47.283 --> 01:51:48.004]  Alex, never mind me.
[01:51:48.064 --> 01:51:48.904]  I know you're doing good.
[01:51:50.018 --> 01:52:05.252]  I missed a little bit of your beginning of your show, so I hope I'm not being redundant here, but I think the problem is that these cities are going broke, you know, with their pension and medical benefits and all.
[01:52:05.916 --> 01:52:11.282]  They claim that always, but they have double sets of books with the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[01:52:11.322 --> 01:52:12.083]  That's not the case.
[01:52:12.383 --> 01:52:12.924]  Is that right?
[01:52:13.104 --> 01:52:15.466]  Are you aware of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports?
[01:52:16.107 --> 01:52:19.270]  I've heard you mention them before, but I've never seen them or anything.
[01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:22.994]  I made a film about it called Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed.
[01:52:23.335 --> 01:52:25.257]  It's got Joe Banister and it's also got
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:26.760]  I think.
[01:52:53.354 --> 01:52:56.015]  Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, I should say.
[01:52:56.055 --> 01:52:57.155]  So it's a double set of books.
[01:52:57.675 --> 01:52:58.335]  Right, okay.
[01:52:58.595 --> 01:53:04.756]  Well, you know, the cities, they give these large business tax breaks to get them in, in their area.
[01:53:04.796 --> 01:53:05.976]  You know, locate them in there.
[01:53:06.276 --> 01:53:08.377]  These Economic Development Councils and so forth.
[01:53:08.417 --> 01:53:09.757]  And they just pass that on to us.
[01:53:10.237 --> 01:53:11.057]  Correct, yeah.
[01:53:11.097 --> 01:53:13.798]  So it's like, you know, we pay it both ways.
[01:53:14.178 --> 01:53:20.039]  Yeah, we pay for the development, guarantee the investment, and a lot of times they don't even pay proper value for the private land that's taken.
[01:53:20.479 --> 01:53:21.520]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:31.126]  And this deal down in Freeport, they're going to give this guy, this new developer, some kind of incentive money back to do this, which we're paying for.
[01:53:31.206 --> 01:53:31.766]  Six million.
[01:53:32.026 --> 01:53:34.347]  Yeah, and then they're going to probably give him tax breaks.
[01:53:34.608 --> 01:53:37.449]  That's probably up front, and then they're going to give him tax breaks over the long run.
[01:53:37.469 --> 01:53:43.173]  So if you really looked at it, I don't know how much tax revenue is going to actually be added to the city.
[01:53:43.673 --> 01:53:45.875]  Other than they're going to get it all up front right away.
[01:53:46.255 --> 01:53:48.897]  It seems, I'm not real sure, but it seems that way to me.
[01:53:48.917 --> 01:53:51.178]  It's just a bunch of people groveling to a billionaire.
[01:53:51.618 --> 01:53:51.959]  Right.
[01:53:52.099 --> 01:53:59.364]  Well, what would be good is to see Crawford City take George's Ranch and tell him he's making a park out of it.
[01:53:59.384 --> 01:54:02.406]  They're going to charge a dollar for everybody to get in and look at what's going on there.
[01:54:02.426 --> 01:54:04.387]  But that would actually be eminent domain.
[01:54:04.467 --> 01:54:05.848]  We're not even talking about that now.
[01:54:05.888 --> 01:54:09.350]  You're not going to be able to use this, Marina, unless you're a member of it.
[01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:10.811]  You're not going to be able to use this.
[01:54:12.112 --> 01:54:12.732]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:14.013]  Good points, John.
[01:54:14.093 --> 01:54:20.476]  Sean and David, and I'll take a few other calls, but first I'm going to cover some news, then we'll take calls, go back into news.
[01:54:20.796 --> 01:54:22.677]  Bunch of news coming up after this quick break.
[01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:28.639]  And I hope you will visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:28.679 --> 01:54:30.700]  By the way, we've really reworked InfoWars.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.761]  We have about twice as much news every day on there.
[01:54:32.781 --> 01:54:37.903]  The site's even better, so if you haven't visited InfoWars lately, be sure and visit InfoWars.com.
[01:54:39.199 --> 01:54:42.208]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:54:43.110 --> 01:54:45.797]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:48.891 --> 01:54:56.338]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[01:54:56.478 --> 01:55:00.661]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[01:55:00.902 --> 01:55:12.532]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility, as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[01:55:12.732 --> 01:55:14.353]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[01:55:18.288 --> 01:55:19.989]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:22.191]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:55:22.391 --> 01:55:23.072]  Prepare yourself.
[01:55:23.252 --> 01:55:26.975]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[01:55:27.095 --> 01:55:32.839]  Call toll free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[01:55:32.899 --> 01:55:34.281]  There's absolutely no obligation.
[01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:37.063]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[01:55:37.183 --> 01:55:38.784]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[01:55:39.084 --> 01:55:41.846]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll free 888-211-1715.
[01:55:41.907 --> 01:55:42.647]  Again that's 888-211-1715.
[01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:54.751]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:55:54.872 --> 01:56:01.053]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:56:01.313 --> 01:56:09.695]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:56:09.995 --> 01:56:17.062]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:56:17.343 --> 01:56:22.168]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:56:22.388 --> 01:56:27.793]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:56:28.134 --> 01:56:31.177]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:39.442]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:56:39.522 --> 01:56:40.102]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:56:48.419 --> 01:56:50.781]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:56:51.022 --> 01:56:54.866]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:56:55.186 --> 01:56:56.007]  Read the labels.
[01:56:56.427 --> 01:57:00.571]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:57:00.791 --> 01:57:04.996]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:57:05.356 --> 01:57:10.221]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:57:10.601 --> 01:57:14.184]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:57:14.364 --> 01:57:19.708]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:57:19.988 --> 01:57:22.730]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:57:23.011 --> 01:57:23.911]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:57:24.212 --> 01:57:34.960]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:40.424]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:57:40.444 --> 01:57:45.268]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:57:51.673 --> 01:57:57.698]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:57:58.318 --> 01:58:01.281]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:04.685 --> 01:58:06.486]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:06.506 --> 01:58:07.807]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:08.367 --> 01:58:10.969]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:58:11.369 --> 01:58:12.530]  We're here live, folks.
[01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:19.854]  And I'll tell you what, I'm just going to take two more calls today and then spend the last 25 minutes.
[01:58:20.634 --> 01:58:25.017]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in California and then David in Delaware.
[01:58:25.077 --> 01:58:26.277]  Sean, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:58:26.638 --> 01:58:28.278]  Hi, you mentioned the dark side.
[01:58:28.519 --> 01:58:33.121]  Defense Intelligence Agency's terrorism headquarters in Boeing's Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:33.181 --> 01:58:34.242]  is called the Death Star.
[01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:35.811]  By the people who work there.
[01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:39.472]  So the evil is metastasized down to the tendrils of power.
[01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:41.133]  Down to the minions, even.
[01:58:42.114 --> 01:58:46.396]  But I wanted to talk about something that the President of Controlled Demolitions, Inc.
[01:58:46.436 --> 01:58:49.317]  said in a news article.
[01:58:49.937 --> 01:58:55.440]  He said, when he saw the 9-11 towers get hit, he said, it's coming down.
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.522]  The second tower will fall first because it was hit lower down.
[01:58:58.542 --> 01:59:02.083]  He also said, first of all, you've got the obvious damage to the exterior frame.
[01:59:02.223 --> 01:59:02.944]  He goes through all these
[01:59:04.147 --> 01:59:06.589]  We have the people that took the wreckage, hauled it off.
[01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:10.353]  The same people helped cover up the Oklahoma City wreckage and bury it under guard.
[01:59:10.894 --> 01:59:15.698]  And now, I haven't seen this article, but I got an email about it mentioning it to me without a link.
[01:59:15.718 --> 01:59:16.539]  It didn't make any sense.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:18.561]  Where is this article?
[01:59:18.961 --> 01:59:21.264]  It's on the New Yorker website.
[01:59:21.484 --> 01:59:25.368]  The article is titled, I believe, The Tower Builders.
[01:59:25.971 --> 01:59:30.193]  So now, without responding to us, they're all over the media explaining why they fell.
[01:59:30.454 --> 01:59:38.178]  There's only like, what, nine or ten different PBS and History Channel and Discovery Channel specials of why the towers fell.
[01:59:38.258 --> 01:59:38.658]  Exactly.
[01:59:38.678 --> 01:59:40.919]  But you remember that all the experts were shocked when it fell.
[01:59:40.939 --> 01:59:50.484]  But this guy, President Mark Luzzo of Controlled Demolition Incorporated, he says, he goes through all the lies about the structural flaws and whatever, and then he says,
[01:59:52.989 --> 01:59:55.110]  Day one, he knew there were structural flaws, and that's why.
[01:59:55.130 --> 01:59:55.551]  Right, right.
[01:59:55.571 --> 02:00:00.273]  Because now that's the latest... It was other... The steel melted, which everybody knows it doesn't.
[02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:04.355]  You know, that stuff burns at 1,200 degrees, and steel melts at around 3,000.
[02:00:04.635 --> 02:00:05.036]  Exactly.
[02:00:05.076 --> 02:00:06.456]  Now, he says, now, paper cooks.
[02:00:06.576 --> 02:00:08.557]  A paper fire is like a coal mine fire.
[02:00:08.918 --> 02:00:11.359]  It keeps burning as long as oxygen gets to it.
[02:00:11.739 --> 02:00:14.300]  And you're high in the building, up in the wind, plenty of oxygen.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.762]  So you've got a hot fire, and you've got these... Yeah, people are standing in the holes in the building.
[02:00:17.822 --> 02:00:18.223]  Exactly.
[02:00:18.303 --> 02:00:19.503]  It's total propaganda.
[02:00:19.803 --> 02:00:20.164]  Exactly.
[02:00:20.184 --> 02:00:20.424]  I mean...
[02:00:21.384 --> 02:00:23.225]  A paper fires like a coal mine fire?
[02:00:23.245 --> 02:00:26.827]  Well, I'll tell you what, why don't you grab their article, write comments on it, and send it to us.
[02:00:27.287 --> 02:00:27.808]  Okay.
[02:00:28.048 --> 02:00:30.489]  If folks do that, I mean, I'll post it if it's good analysis.
[02:00:30.849 --> 02:00:31.130]  Okay.
[02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:31.690]  Thank you.
[02:00:31.710 --> 02:00:32.951]  We can't cover all the lies.
[02:00:32.991 --> 02:00:34.452]  We can't track all the lies.
[02:00:34.492 --> 02:00:35.892]  We can't deal with all the lies, Sean.
[02:00:36.313 --> 02:00:36.973]  I understand.
[02:00:37.013 --> 02:00:39.414]  And Richard Perle is called the Dark Lord.
[02:00:39.434 --> 02:00:41.135]  I mean, it's pretty obvious.
[02:00:41.235 --> 02:00:44.477]  No, his nickname at the Pentagon was the Prince of Darkness.
[02:00:44.497 --> 02:00:44.957]  Oh, yeah, right.
[02:00:44.997 --> 02:00:45.798]  Well, sorry.
[02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:49.692]  No, Death Star, Star Wars, Prince of Darkness.
[02:00:50.793 --> 02:00:55.417]  They have these names, you know, Devil Leader, Long Devil, Baphomet.
[02:00:55.677 --> 02:00:57.058]  Friendly names for our leaders.
[02:00:57.438 --> 02:00:58.819]  I'll just give you a link.
[02:00:59.019 --> 02:01:00.300]  Hello, Dark Lord, how are you?
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:02.122]  I'm doing quite well, Prince of Darkness.
[02:01:02.582 --> 02:01:04.003]  When is Long Devil arriving?
[02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:08.626]  Yeah, when are we going to have Burn, or Epigee of Cremation?
[02:01:08.646 --> 02:01:11.168]  Ah, King Dragon is arriving as helicopters landing.
[02:01:11.188 --> 02:01:13.330]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:01:14.355 --> 02:01:14.815]  Thank you.
[02:01:15.315 --> 02:01:18.756]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's, it's... We shouldn't even joke about it.
[02:01:18.816 --> 02:01:20.236]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[02:01:20.276 --> 02:01:21.177]  This is not a joke.
[02:01:21.837 --> 02:01:24.157]  These people pride themselves on being ruthless.
[02:01:24.197 --> 02:01:25.297]  They enjoy evil.
[02:01:27.598 --> 02:01:27.718]  Ah!
[02:01:28.358 --> 02:01:29.658]  Good and evil's real, folks.
[02:01:30.179 --> 02:01:32.739]  Ah, David in Delaware, last caller.
[02:01:32.759 --> 02:01:33.319]  Go ahead, David.
[02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:34.600]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:35.440]  Good, sir.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.240]  All righty.
[02:01:36.676 --> 02:01:45.758]  Hey Alex, I went down to the Louis Delaware Public Library to put some more videos in, yours and Tex Marr's and the Power Hour.
[02:01:46.278 --> 02:01:47.638]  Yeah, you told us about that last week.
[02:01:47.678 --> 02:01:57.940]  Well, I had everything ready to go down there and I finally made it on Thursday, but the president and the library both refused any of the material.
[02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.781]  I thought they'd agreed in the past.
[02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:00.161]  No.
[02:02:01.115 --> 02:02:03.237]  I thought you placed it, you said, in four libraries.
[02:02:03.297 --> 02:02:11.003]  The other three libraries they are in, Milford, Harrington, and Greenwood, but the Lewis Delaware has not, and they refuse it.
[02:02:12.144 --> 02:02:13.925]  Well, you ought to get a statement from them.
[02:02:13.965 --> 02:02:15.106]  That sounds like a news article.
[02:02:15.126 --> 02:02:15.586]  What do they say?
[02:02:15.626 --> 02:02:16.087]  It's evil?
[02:02:16.127 --> 02:02:16.787]  Or what do they say?
[02:02:17.087 --> 02:02:25.554]  Well, to start with, I took it to the library, and I told the lady I wanted somebody to sign for the videos, at least let them know that, you know, I had placed them there.
[02:02:26.234 --> 02:02:27.756]  And she said, no, I'm not going to.
[02:02:27.816 --> 02:02:28.676]  I'm going to give you everything.
[02:02:28.756 --> 02:02:29.417]  I said, well, what
[02:02:29.847 --> 02:02:31.889]  What's Eric, uh, what's his position?
[02:02:31.969 --> 02:02:35.492]  And she said, well, he's president, uh, Eric Hale.
[02:02:35.672 --> 02:02:38.054]  And anyway, uh, I said, where's his office?
[02:02:38.094 --> 02:02:39.735]  She gave me the information.
[02:02:39.795 --> 02:02:40.676]  I went to his office.
[02:02:41.016 --> 02:02:44.459]  I talked to his wife and she said, she's not going to sign for nothing.
[02:02:45.059 --> 02:02:48.082]  And then my daughter went down there because they know each other.
[02:02:48.702 --> 02:02:51.004]  And he told her he's not signing for nothing.
[02:02:52.321 --> 02:02:54.342]  But they accept other people's books and videos.
[02:02:54.402 --> 02:02:54.822]  I know it.
[02:02:54.862 --> 02:02:56.083]  You're trying to make a donation.
[02:02:56.103 --> 02:02:57.204]  That's discrimination.
[02:02:57.544 --> 02:03:00.445]  I had two videos in the package to give to him.
[02:03:03.287 --> 02:03:09.310]  Tex Mars is one of them and 9-1-1 and Plain Sight and your information was on the letter also.
[02:03:11.491 --> 02:03:13.933]  Well, I mean, sounds like freedom.
[02:03:14.233 --> 02:03:17.855]  That's discrimination and freedom and they're giving us the shaft.
[02:03:18.735 --> 02:03:20.216]  I hear you, and I appreciate the call.
[02:03:20.256 --> 02:03:28.358]  And since you mentioned that, David, let me just, in one final story, and we'll spend the last 20 minutes on those, one final little tidbit on this.
[02:03:29.619 --> 02:03:31.079]  I read the articles yesterday.
[02:03:31.119 --> 02:03:39.722]  There's a Professor Finkelstein, who's in New York, but his books are published by one of the state universities in California.
[02:03:39.942 --> 02:03:41.723]  And he's a Jewish gentleman, very scholarly.
[02:03:42.897 --> 02:03:47.521]  And, you know, he talked about, he's written a book about how the Soviets exaggerated how many Jews were killed.
[02:03:48.142 --> 02:03:48.642]  Look, folks.
[02:03:50.183 --> 02:03:52.686]  Hitler did kill a bunch of Jews.
[02:03:53.847 --> 02:03:55.168]  And Hitler was a bad guy.
[02:03:56.188 --> 02:03:58.150]  But they said 6 million died at Auschwitz.
[02:03:58.210 --> 02:04:00.252]  Well, then they, that's where that whole 6 million number came.
[02:04:00.272 --> 02:04:03.655]  And then they, okay, that isn't true, but 6 million were killed total, they said.
[02:04:03.695 --> 02:04:05.637]  And then, well, 2 million were killed at Auschwitz.
[02:04:05.657 --> 02:04:06.517]  Well, now the number's down to 400,000.
[02:04:08.587 --> 02:04:14.710]  But whether Hitler killed 400,000 or a million Jews at one camp, he was killing Jews, folks.
[02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:22.033]  But look, Finkelstein has a right to write books about this.
[02:04:23.333 --> 02:04:25.194]  Professor Finkelstein has a right.
[02:04:25.234 --> 02:04:30.896]  Well, Alan Dershowitz has traveled the country, including Austin.
[02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:35.998]  He's written books about how wonderful torture is and how it's a great virtue and a freedom to torture people.
[02:04:36.098 --> 02:04:37.599]  And he's a supposed civil rights lawyer.
[02:04:39.358 --> 02:04:41.420]  And I have actually seen him on television promoted.
[02:04:42.861 --> 02:04:47.085]  Well, Finkelstein wrote a book called, it's coming out, called Beyond Chutzpah.
[02:04:49.067 --> 02:04:50.328]  About Alan Dershowitz.
[02:04:51.970 --> 02:04:54.132]  And, uh, you know, the type of creature he is.
[02:04:54.973 --> 02:04:56.294]  About, you know, promoting torture.
[02:04:57.857 --> 02:05:06.679]  And Dershowitz wrote a letter to the governor of California, who controls that university's funding, and said, please put pressure on them, pull their funding if need be.
[02:05:07.139 --> 02:05:12.081]  Schwarzenegger's office, a rare move that was wise, said, look, we're not in the business of banning books.
[02:05:12.481 --> 02:05:14.161]  No, we're not going to do this.
[02:05:14.501 --> 02:05:15.521]  The letter's now published.
[02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:16.322]  In public.
[02:05:17.462 --> 02:05:20.022]  Both his letter and the letter that Schwarzenegger's office released.
[02:05:21.363 --> 02:05:22.343]  Concerning Finkelstein.
[02:05:23.974 --> 02:05:26.756]  And how they're trying to stop the university publishing his book.
[02:05:26.796 --> 02:05:29.378]  He lives again in New York, but this is in California where they're publishing.
[02:05:30.519 --> 02:05:35.363]  And Gershowitz tried to deny he'd written the letter, and when he got caught doing it, he said, no, I wrote a note!
[02:05:36.103 --> 02:05:37.784]  So look at that semantical deception.
[02:05:39.266 --> 02:05:44.049]  Folks, when we got people trying to stop the publishing of books through the government, we got a big problem.
[02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:47.712]  And this is our renowned civil rights person.
[02:05:49.433 --> 02:05:53.136]  And if somebody wants to write a book saying ten million Jews were killed, which is not true,
[02:05:54.286 --> 02:05:55.347]  They should be able to write it.
[02:05:57.308 --> 02:06:04.292]  If somebody wants to write a book saying that a million Jews were killed, I'll defend their right to write it.
[02:06:05.813 --> 02:06:06.193]  Okay?
[02:06:06.973 --> 02:06:08.534]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:06:09.475 --> 02:06:13.717]  Regardless, you shouldn't look at somebody's views and then decide if you support the First Amendment.
[02:06:14.237 --> 02:06:20.281]  You should support their view to write the book, not their particular view of what's in the book.
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.081]  To boil that down, it's kind of like Rumsfeld's comment.
[02:06:26.121 --> 02:06:29.522]  You should support their right to put their views out, even if you don't agree with their views.
[02:06:31.023 --> 02:06:32.283]  And we have the ADL.
[02:06:32.823 --> 02:06:34.324]  I mean, I'm really mad at the ADL.
[02:06:34.444 --> 02:06:35.764]  I don't have time to sue people.
[02:06:35.904 --> 02:06:36.944]  I don't want to sue people.
[02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:43.466]  I've had to sue before over defamation and stuff and been successful.
[02:06:44.467 --> 02:06:48.908]  And I sent them a letter a few years ago and I said, look, you better stop it.
[02:06:49.605 --> 02:06:52.187]  Because they won't call me anti-semitic, because I'm not anti-semitic.
[02:06:52.227 --> 02:06:53.507]  I don't care what group you're with.
[02:06:53.807 --> 02:06:59.351]  Just don't try to dominate me and don't get together in some mafia and then try to claim racism when we oppose you.
[02:07:00.792 --> 02:07:05.394]  But the ADL currently has got some new report out I'm in about vigilantes on the border.
[02:07:05.454 --> 02:07:09.277]  By new, I haven't been on their website in years and I was on it a few hours doing research the other night.
[02:07:11.058 --> 02:07:12.839]  Border vigilantes in Arizona.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:18.182]  And they've got some quote by me interviewing Jack Foote at Ranch Rescue
[02:07:19.605 --> 02:07:23.949]  Saying, yes, the culture in Mexico is beyond evil.
[02:07:26.731 --> 02:07:36.619]  Now, I guarantee you folks, I said that drug culture or the narco-terror culture is, you know, beyond evil.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:42.203]  But no, they've got it that I say Mexicans are beyond evil, and it's not true.
[02:07:43.604 --> 02:07:45.566]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:07:46.545 --> 02:07:47.686]  And they've been losing lawsuits.
[02:07:47.746 --> 02:07:48.846]  They don't care, I guess.
[02:07:48.886 --> 02:07:53.289]  You know, they just got more money than, you know, than God, and it just doesn't matter to them.
[02:07:53.369 --> 02:07:55.710]  I mean, I... I don't know, though.
[02:07:55.730 --> 02:08:00.713]  I'm just... I got so many films I want to make, so many things I want to do, I don't have time to do this.
[02:08:01.174 --> 02:08:03.575]  And plus, they're being totally discredited, so it doesn't really matter.
[02:08:04.315 --> 02:08:07.477]  But, um... And they don't call me anti-Semitic.
[02:08:07.517 --> 02:08:10.199]  They just mix me in with a bunch of other stuff.
[02:08:11.061 --> 02:08:13.763]  You know, Alex Jones thinks the government was involved in 9-11.
[02:08:14.704 --> 02:08:16.605]  And I really ought to thank him at a certain level.
[02:08:18.227 --> 02:08:23.370]  Right after 9-11, about a week after, you know, they said, what extremists are saying?
[02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:25.532]  And Alex Jones says the government's behind 9-11.
[02:08:25.552 --> 02:08:28.614]  So see, they're on record showing that I was there saying it day one.
[02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:32.157]  I wasn't mad about that.
[02:08:32.778 --> 02:08:36.981]  What I'm mad about is where they
[02:08:38.746 --> 02:08:46.868]  Take what I said about the Columbia blowing up, and then try to spin it into... You know, they say, what anti-Semites and haters are saying, and they got me under it.
[02:08:47.488 --> 02:08:52.670]  We're talking about obvious corruption and foul play with the space shuttle.
[02:08:55.031 --> 02:08:58.231]  But this new thing, I guarantee, is not the quote of what I said.
[02:08:58.291 --> 02:09:00.512]  I mean, I don't remember that exact interview.
[02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.952]  I'm sure it's still posted somewhere.
[02:09:01.972 --> 02:09:03.873]  So I have time to go back and listen to it.
[02:09:03.893 --> 02:09:07.354]  But I know I didn't say that, because I know what I believe, and that's what I say what I believe.
[02:09:10.129 --> 02:09:17.855]  It's just very frustrating, and now the ADL is with Rick Baca, the sheriff of L.A.
[02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:29.585]  County, in the legislature, trying to arrest and detain anybody that's even, quote, anti-immigrant group, and register you basically as a sex offender in a new extremist database.
[02:09:29.665 --> 02:09:31.547]  I mean, folks, give me a break!
[02:09:32.207 --> 02:09:35.050]  They don't want books published by Jews, by the way.
[02:09:35.070 --> 02:09:38.412]  They don't want books, you know, Dershowitz doesn't.
[02:09:38.432 --> 02:09:38.913]  They don't want
[02:09:39.657 --> 02:09:42.098]  You know, I have jacked foot on about the open borders.
[02:09:42.138 --> 02:09:47.100]  I mean, beyond evil, we've got giant kidnappings, hundreds dead, machine gunning and killing people.
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:49.861]  They've got whole border towns shutting down.
[02:09:49.901 --> 02:09:51.922]  We've got just total corruption.
[02:09:51.962 --> 02:09:59.524]  I mean, it's... Look, if Mexico wasn't bordering us, I guarantee you there'd be a travel advisory not to go there.
[02:10:00.124 --> 02:10:01.045]  Don't go to Cyprus.
[02:10:01.065 --> 02:10:01.885]  Don't go to Israel.
[02:10:01.925 --> 02:10:02.745]  Don't go to Syria.
[02:10:03.166 --> 02:10:04.146]  Don't go to Baghdad.
[02:10:04.770 --> 02:10:08.414]  The murder rates at Baghdad levels, literally, on the Texas border.
[02:10:08.794 --> 02:10:11.877]  You can forget Arizona and New Mexico and Southern Cal.
[02:10:13.098 --> 02:10:15.320]  I got a huge stat today on this.
[02:10:16.001 --> 02:10:16.861]  I mentioned it earlier.
[02:10:16.922 --> 02:10:20.165]  I mean, how do you, what am I supposed to say, it's wonderful down there?
[02:10:23.488 --> 02:10:24.128]  The culture is.
[02:10:25.231 --> 02:10:26.312]  Incredibly despotic.
[02:10:26.352 --> 02:10:28.213]  The culture of the corrupt government.
[02:10:28.653 --> 02:10:31.195]  Everybody knows Mexico is one of the most corrupt governments.
[02:10:31.275 --> 02:10:33.517]  I'll say North Korea is beyond evil.
[02:10:33.617 --> 02:10:35.778]  It's just unbelievably corrupt.
[02:10:35.878 --> 02:10:40.421]  It's a... If they take the case, does that mean I'm against Koreans?
[02:10:42.543 --> 02:10:43.263]  No, it doesn't.
[02:10:44.044 --> 02:10:46.225]  I'll probably be in there attacking Koreans next.
[02:10:46.345 --> 02:10:48.867]  Alex Jones says Koreans are beyond evil.
[02:10:51.069 --> 02:10:54.251]  So, it's just... I mean, these guys, they arrested
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:11:02.106]  A whole bunch that charged seven, no, eight Christians with 47 years in prison.
[02:11:02.146 --> 02:11:04.328]  The Bush administration went and gave U.S.
[02:11:04.388 --> 02:11:07.330]  attorneys to the case in Philadelphia and tried to put them in prison.
[02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:10.333]  Thank God it was thrown out, because they had video of everything.
[02:11:10.713 --> 02:11:13.415]  Kneeling, praying on the street corners, people yelled and screamed at them.
[02:11:15.597 --> 02:11:16.098]  I mean, folks,
[02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:21.672]  Should I love the ADL because they're trying to get the Ten Commandments out of all the courthouses?
[02:11:22.092 --> 02:11:26.814]  Trying to take the bedrock... By the way, that's... Ten Commandments is Jewish.
[02:11:27.414 --> 02:11:28.515]  You gotta love it, folks.
[02:11:30.796 --> 02:11:32.057]  I mean, I get it from both sides.
[02:11:32.097 --> 02:11:40.680]  I got the Nazis saying I'm an evil Mossad agent and death-threatening me, and I got the ADL lying about me and twisting and manipulating and spinning.
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:41.501]  I'm tired of it!
[02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:43.382]  I'm tired of it!
[02:11:45.623 --> 02:11:46.243]  I'm sick of it!
[02:11:47.304 --> 02:11:48.265]  I don't appreciate it!
[02:11:49.806 --> 02:11:52.228]  And, um, alright, that's it on that.
[02:11:52.688 --> 02:11:58.293]  Ottawa unveils a new security plan, closer partnership with U.S.-Mexico, a risk to sovereignty.
[02:11:59.714 --> 02:12:08.541]  Public Security Minister Anne McClellan unveiled a sweeping plan yesterday to harmonize Canadian entry systems with those of the United States and Social Security and the borders.
[02:12:09.562 --> 02:12:15.107]  A move NDP leader Jack Layton immediately decried as a dangerous step
[02:12:16.471 --> 02:12:17.412]  Towards integration.
[02:12:18.773 --> 02:12:20.954]  What we're talking about is a partnership.
[02:12:22.876 --> 02:12:30.421]  It's how we work together, respecting our shared values, our cultural differences, our sovereignty, but how we work together to make things better.
[02:12:31.542 --> 02:12:35.604]  The plan, part of a broad set of economic and security measures and goals announced by Ms.
[02:12:35.664 --> 02:12:36.645]  McClellan a month ago.
[02:12:36.685 --> 02:12:37.706]  The CFR announced it.
[02:12:37.766 --> 02:12:38.687]  Notice how they're the boss.
[02:12:39.607 --> 02:12:40.548]  Industry minister,
[02:12:41.559 --> 02:12:42.740]  David Emerson said the U.S.
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:48.643]  and Mexican counterparts envisioned common benchmarks of visitor visa screening and processing within nine months.
[02:12:48.683 --> 02:12:59.088]  It also comments on three countries through real-time information sharing and high-tech individuals and cargo, and greatly expanding our use of biometrics to screen visitors for North America.
[02:12:59.629 --> 02:13:06.012]  This is part of a very deep integration concept that has been talked about, I think, and I think it threatens Canadian sovereignty.
[02:13:08.194 --> 02:13:12.416]  He denounced the government for agreeing to the deal relatively quietly.
[02:13:12.436 --> 02:13:19.678]  There should be a full discussion by Canadians and in Parliament before we start getting into the sharing of information about Canadians and the United States.
[02:13:21.018 --> 02:13:29.101]  And that's part of a Council on Foreign Relations program that was again brought out last month.
[02:13:30.221 --> 02:13:31.702]  And it just merges everything.
[02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:32.742]  Here's another one.
[02:13:32.762 --> 02:13:34.723]  North American security plan unveiled.
[02:13:35.615 --> 02:13:40.216]  Canadians will be participating in a new wide-ranging North American partnership.
[02:13:40.576 --> 02:13:49.738]  The compromise strategy was developed following the formation of the Secondary Security Prosperity Partnership of North America as a meeting of U.S.
[02:13:49.778 --> 02:13:54.639]  President Bush, Prime Minister Paul Martin, and Mexican President Vicente Fox in March at his ranch.
[02:13:54.679 --> 02:13:55.799]  We knew what was going on there.
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:59.180]  And again, it was brought forward by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:01.961]  And Lou Dobbs decried it a few weeks ago.
[02:14:02.041 --> 02:14:02.681]  Is he evil too?
[02:14:04.033 --> 02:14:10.460]  Here's that article, 44 Kidnapped Victims in Mexico Freed After Raid on the Nuevo Laredo on the U.S.
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:10.840]  Border.
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:13.182]  I mean, that's how bad it's gotten.
[02:14:13.463 --> 02:14:17.487]  Another one here, Mexican Forces Rescue Dozens Held Kidnapped.
[02:14:18.708 --> 02:14:22.412]  Treasury Secretary Snows His Oil Prices, Hurting Economy, CNBC.
[02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:24.749]  U.S.
[02:14:24.769 --> 02:14:31.293]  Treasury Secretary John Snow acknowledged on Tuesday that according to high oil prices are beginning to take their toll on the U.S.
[02:14:31.353 --> 02:14:34.294]  economy, but not enough to derail the economy's strong recovery.
[02:14:34.674 --> 02:14:43.899]  Boulder Dash, Poppycock, every energy prices are way too high, Snow told CNBC's Clearly, and it's hurting.
[02:14:44.574 --> 02:14:46.715]  After hitting a three-month low in May, U.S.
[02:14:46.755 --> 02:14:53.599]  trade oil futures have risen around 32% to a record high of $16.95 a barrel, almost $61 a barrel.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:15:00.103]  High energy prices often sap domestic spending, and consumers have to shell out more for gasoline and less for other goods.
[02:15:00.143 --> 02:15:01.084]  Wait till winter comes.
[02:15:01.644 --> 02:15:03.785]  Clearly, energy prices serve as a tax.
[02:15:03.825 --> 02:15:10.389]  They reduce the disposable income available to do other things, and they take some energy and oxygen out of the economy.
[02:15:12.296 --> 02:15:13.056]  Very serious.
[02:15:13.096 --> 02:15:15.777]  And then we got Bill Clinton and George Bush vacationing together.
[02:15:16.137 --> 02:15:17.397]  Got those photos posted.
[02:15:18.337 --> 02:15:20.938]  Diana feared being assassinated, says bodyguard.
[02:15:20.998 --> 02:15:27.080]  Now not just her videotape she made or her personal diary, but now on another eyewitness.
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:36.442]  Late British Royal Diana, Princess of Wales, told her bodyguard she feared being murdered by the British government just weeks before her death in a car accident in Paris in France in 1997.
[02:15:38.974 --> 02:15:42.321]  Alright, a lot of other key, vital, final news items.
[02:15:42.982 --> 02:15:45.146]  On the other side of this break, stay the course.
[02:15:45.767 --> 02:15:46.950]  Stay with us until the end.
[02:15:50.245 --> 02:15:53.106]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:15:53.366 --> 02:15:54.946]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:15:55.287 --> 02:15:59.948]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:16:00.288 --> 02:16:04.730]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:09.311]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:16:09.551 --> 02:16:12.392]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:16:12.472 --> 02:16:17.154]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:16:17.354 --> 02:16:21.755]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:16:21.995 --> 02:16:29.217]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:16:29.458 --> 02:16:31.898]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:16:32.058 --> 02:16:33.779]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:16:49.053 --> 02:16:56.580]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:07.770]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:17:09.251 --> 02:17:13.414]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:17:13.755 --> 02:17:24.203]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:17:24.503 --> 02:17:25.003]  That's right!
[02:17:25.183 --> 02:17:32.305]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:17:32.585 --> 02:17:36.727]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:17:36.887 --> 02:17:41.328]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:17:41.388 --> 02:17:41.848]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:17:50.123 --> 02:17:57.027]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:17:57.547 --> 02:18:02.971]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:18:03.371 --> 02:18:13.397]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:18:13.537 --> 02:18:15.878]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:18:16.258 --> 02:18:19.280]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.920]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:28.542]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:18:28.802 --> 02:18:30.542]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:18:30.882 --> 02:18:42.644]  You'll find Non-X gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:18:43.124 --> 02:18:47.485]  Non-X nail gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:18:53.701 --> 02:18:55.583]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:18:56.064 --> 02:18:58.826]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.290]  U.S.
[02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:24.292]  scientists have succeeded in reviving dogs that were three hours of clinical death, paving the way for trials on humans within years.
[02:19:24.633 --> 02:19:35.097]  Pittsburgh's Safar Center for Resurrection Research has developed a technique in which subjects' veins are drained of blood and filled with ice-cold salt solution so they kill the dogs and then reanimate them.
[02:19:35.377 --> 02:19:35.977]  This is horrible.
[02:19:36.537 --> 02:19:38.319]  The animals are considered scientifically dead.
[02:19:38.339 --> 02:19:41.761]  They stop breathing and have no heartbeat or brain activity for three hours.
[02:19:42.402 --> 02:19:44.503]  Three hours later, their blood is replaced with zombie.
[02:19:45.064 --> 02:19:47.405]  The dogs are brought back to life with an electric shock.
[02:19:47.866 --> 02:19:49.027]  It's like Frankenstein.
[02:19:49.227 --> 02:19:50.528]  We imagine that it happens.
[02:19:52.569 --> 02:19:55.632]  Fox News Champion's Verichip says it's for the greater good.
[02:19:55.652 --> 02:19:58.254]  They spent a couple pages on how great it is.
[02:19:58.274 --> 02:20:01.236]  Technology advances often must be nurtured.
[02:20:01.296 --> 02:20:03.818]  At the end of the article, they said the implantable microchips are wonderful.
[02:20:04.631 --> 02:20:05.452]  Why not have them?
[02:20:05.512 --> 02:20:07.034]  You know, we're just backwards idiots.
[02:20:07.814 --> 02:20:13.400]  Chicago, uh, pairing surveillance cameras with gunshot recognition systems.
[02:20:14.521 --> 02:20:21.629]  Police State 2000, we show how they put them in in Austin, and call them gunshot detectors, but then you go to the industry websites, they admit it's for listening to people.
[02:20:22.069 --> 02:20:23.631]  But see, they won't call it microphones.
[02:20:23.711 --> 02:20:23.911]  No.
[02:20:24.512 --> 02:20:24.612]  No.
[02:20:25.237 --> 02:20:33.623]  City officials are using new technology that recognizes the sound of a gunshot within two blocks radius, pinpoints the source, and turns the surveillance camera towards the shooter, and places a 9-11 call.
[02:20:34.143 --> 02:20:37.305]  Officials can track them, the shooter then dispatches other officers to the scene.
[02:20:37.685 --> 02:20:39.446]  Welcome to crime-fighting in the 21st century.
[02:20:39.486 --> 02:20:47.031]  Instead of just having eyes, you have the advantage of both eyes and ears, said Brian Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Safety Dynamics in Oak Brook, which makes the systems.
[02:20:47.491 --> 02:20:51.234]  After a successful pilot program, Chicago officials are planning to put them up around the city.
[02:20:52.509 --> 02:20:53.089]  There's another one.
[02:20:53.609 --> 02:20:57.531]  Italy eyes extradition of CIA-led kidnappers, source says.
[02:20:57.971 --> 02:20:58.891]  Rome, Reuters.
[02:20:59.412 --> 02:21:07.534]  Italy plans to seek the extradition of 13 CIA agents for the abduction of a radical Muslim cleric who was flown to Egypt and said he was tortured in prison there.
[02:21:07.935 --> 02:21:13.257]  A judicial source said on Monday they are now trying to extradite the CIA officers who kidnapped him and took him for torture.
[02:21:13.497 --> 02:21:17.218]  But see, that's still illegal over there to be kidnapping people without warrants and torturing them.
[02:21:17.782 --> 02:21:19.283]  We got two to fight Al Qaeda.
[02:21:19.323 --> 02:21:20.404]  No, they're just setting the precedent.
[02:21:20.765 --> 02:21:22.866]  Blair faces rebellion over an ID card disaster.
[02:21:22.886 --> 02:21:25.809]  The London Times have been trying to pass an ID card for the sixth time.
[02:21:26.470 --> 02:21:32.595]  Well, it says a senior labor insider warned the government today that ID cards had the disaster potential of Margaret Thatcher's poll tax.
[02:21:33.355 --> 02:21:34.296]  That was a property tax.
[02:21:34.336 --> 02:21:39.200]  And the Millennium Dome combined as Tony Blair faced the first test of a slimmed-down commons majority.
[02:21:39.641 --> 02:21:42.023]  They're angry in England over the national ID card.
[02:21:42.063 --> 02:21:43.244]  Here they just throw it in our face.
[02:21:43.904 --> 02:21:48.305]  Second, UK IndyMedia server seized by police before G8 because they don't want people protesting it.
[02:21:48.725 --> 02:21:59.267]  Also, the unofficial war US Britain led massive secret bombing campaign before Iraq war was declared totally illegal for months bombing the daylights out of Iraq during the peace discussions.
[02:21:59.427 --> 02:22:00.607]  Everybody saw it on the news.
[02:22:00.667 --> 02:22:01.768]  It wasn't secret.
[02:22:02.848 --> 02:22:04.588]  We're out of time ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:04.948 --> 02:22:07.869]  The news we didn't cover is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:22:09.545 --> 02:22:11.066]  Find out what all the hubbub's about.
