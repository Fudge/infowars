[00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:06.418]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:08.119]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:09.940]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.421]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.062]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:17.405]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:21.988]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:44.388]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 11th day, 7-11, of 2005.
[00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:46.429]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.171]  Weeks ago, I had David Icke coming on to talk about the aftermath of the G-80 schedule for today.
[00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.612]  That'll be extremely timely because, of course, he's in England, in London.
[00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:05.339]  And he, of course, has focused a lot in years past on government-sponsored terrorism and done a great job covering that.
[00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.741]  Though I don't agree with David on some issues, I agree with him on his analysis of this.
[00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:14.603]  So that should be extremely interesting coming up in the second hour into the third hour.
[00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.824]  And, of course, we'll have open phones.
[00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:22.166]  In this hour, there have been a lot of new developments over the weekend that I have to say.
[00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:26.245]  That we broke at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:35.951]  Paul Watson and myself, thanks to you, the listeners, and all the tips you sent us, and the different things that were hidden in plain view that you noticed.
[00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:41.054]  The downside of this is attempting to read 2,000 emails a day.
[00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:45.916]  We normally get 2,000 a day, but only about a third of those are good emails.
[00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:47.137]  Most of it's spam.
[00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:49.959]  I mean 2,000 emails without the spam.
[00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:55.118]  It has been daunting and we're working on four or five other big stories right now.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.522]  It's unbelievable.
[00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:02.929]  So, I'll try to go through the major developments that broke over the weekend.
[00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.713]  Huge developments concerning the London bombing.
[00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:08.745]  A ton of other just massive news.
[00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:11.407]  We'll get a little bit into the hurricane and what happened with that.
[00:02:12.328 --> 00:02:15.091]  Also, people are now learning what we knew about a year ago.
[00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:18.133]  People didn't want to believe it when we first reported on it before it was included in the papers.
[00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.996]  Illegal aliens are given mortgages.
[00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:25.039]  They're given funding for buying homes.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.845]  But what the papers are now not reporting is that we have learned they're given preference.
[00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:35.796]  Yeah, we've been reporting on that for actually over a year now.
[00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:37.177]  It's mainstream news.
[00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:43.601]  And folks, under the Patriot Act, if you assist anyone knowingly who's even committing misdemeanors, it's an act of terrorism.
[00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.422]  It's called Patriot Act Compliance.
[00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:46.803]  Just type that into a search engine.
[00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:48.744]  You'll get hundreds of thousands of hits on it.
[00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:52.107]  All the different government documents and all the companies trying to comply.
[00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.149]  But you can aid felons and it's okay.
[00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.572]  Because all of this is selectively enforced.
[00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:02.914]  This illustrates how the globalists are getting rid of their sovereignty.
[00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:06.276]  Getting rid of our sovereignty and setting up a world government.
[00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:07.517]  Okay.
[00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:16.024]  Folks, I'm going to have to try to calm down and stay focused to be able to cover all this because there's so much.
[00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.646]  Blair to reject bomb inquiry.
[00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:21.388]  He doesn't want an investigation.
[00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:28.093]  Oh, and they're saying they can't find out who did it and now it's admitted that it was a CIA-connected, Bush-connected website
[00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:33.534]  That posted the false claim by a new Al-Qaeda group saying they did it.
[00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.015]  That isn't stopping neocons from still saying it's a real report.
[00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:46.338]  The German Parliament is debating putting troops on the streets to patrol, just like the United States government announced two days before the bombing they were planning to do this.
[00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.939]  Get a little bit into Hurricane Dennis, blows through Alabama and Florida.
[00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.701]  And again, more on the phony Al-Qaeda responsibility claim proven to be a hoax.
[00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:05.396]  But the first two top stories that I'm going to get into are two articles, two reports that we broke.
[00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:10.281]  That is, both these reports were hidden in plain view, but nobody paid attention to it.
[00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:19.651]  We got more details, magnified it, and now these are some of the biggest stories on the internet right now, even being picked up by mainstream news publications.
[00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:20.992]  But not enough!
[00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:28.661]  London underground bombing exercise took place at same time as real attack.
[00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:35.124]  Culpability cover scenario echoes 9-11 war games by Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:40.807]  Second article by Paul Watson, bomb scare suggests Blair knew and did nothing.
[00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:48.011]  High-level alert Israeli intelligence warnings and how that ties into what happened at Sheffield 36 hours before the bombing.
[00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.704]  And another Guantanamo Bay commander has been dismissed.
[00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:56.067]  It is all coming up.
[00:04:56.227 --> 00:04:58.350]  Brace yourselves, it's ultra-massive.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:02.044]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:02.964]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:09.168]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:11.009]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.751]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:28.700]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.020]  government.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.041]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:37.302]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:41.963]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.602]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:14.123]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:15.524]  The New World Order.
[00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:17.265]  Panama.
[00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:21.528]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.588 --> 00:06:28.514]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:30.735]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:41.423]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:42.184]  If you want to

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.241]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:07.682]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:18.227]  Alright, we're 8 minutes, 14 seconds into worldwide transmission against the globalists.
[00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:37.149]  The first segment I got into some of the news we'll be covering all the latest developments concerning the London bombings where we've caught the globalists with their pants down and just so much more and yesterday when I was joining us in the second and third hour from London as well.
[00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.852]  All right let me just get into the latest news on this.
[00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:45.295]  This broke one of these stories broke Friday night the other Saturday morning
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.363]  We are working on a whole bunch of other big stories and again I commend the listeners for pointing out so many different things to us.
[00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:58.485]  For tracking so many different newscasts and deciphering the propaganda.
[00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:04.308]  We are literally the equivalent of an intelligence agency against the New World Order.
[00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:18.221]  All of us tracking and tracing their lies, their propaganda, watching everything they do, researching the connections of the different players involved in these bombings, that's how we're able to move so quickly against them and expose them.
[00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:29.465]  All over the web, even what you'd call mainstream news sites, are saying the evidence shows this is a Western intelligence agency and the government stands to gain.
[00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:31.586]  And let me tell you, it feels good
[00:09:32.478 --> 00:09:37.782]  It's very satisfying to see the learning curve accelerating.
[00:09:38.662 --> 00:09:48.389]  I don't like being lonely here, you know, day one on 9-11, exposing government involvement, something that is just today becoming widely accepted.
[00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.052]  In fact, most people will tell you privately that that's their view.
[00:09:53.112 --> 00:09:54.493]  It is now the majority view.
[00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:56.214]  Even major polls show that.
[00:09:58.604 --> 00:10:04.826]  But if you talk to people privately, the numbers are even higher than 50% in Zogby and 90% in CNN.
[00:10:05.507 --> 00:10:06.187]  It's amazing.
[00:10:07.487 --> 00:10:13.230]  London underground bombing exercise took place at same time as real attack.
[00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.951]  And we also have a report here, bomb scare suggests Blair knew and did nothing.
[00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:24.934]  I think the best thing to do is just calmly read these first two articles before I even comment on them.
[00:10:26.656 --> 00:10:31.598]  London underground bombing exercise took place at same time as real attack.
[00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:35.719]  Culpability cover scenario echoes 9-11 war games.
[00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:41.200]  Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones present Planet.com July 9th.
[00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:42.821]  This broke Saturday.
[00:10:44.168 --> 00:11:03.234]  A consultancy agency with government and police connections was running an exercise for an unmanned, excuse me, unnamed company that revolved around the London Underground being bombed at the exact same time and locations as happened in real life on the morning of July 7th.
[00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:28.085]  On a BBC Radio 5 interview that aired on the evening of the 7th, that is so important, on the night of the bombing, the host interviewed Peter Power, who has since been on ITN, we're going to play that in a minute, Managing Director of Visor Consultants, which bills itself as a crisis management advice company, better known to you and I as a PR firm.
[00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:35.500]  Peter Power was a former Scotland Yard official working at one time with the Anti-Terrorist Branch.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:56.945]  Power told the host that at the exact same time that the London bombings were taking place, his company was running a 1,000 person strong exercise which drilled the London Underground being bombed at the exact same locations at the exact same time as happened in real life.
[00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:05.079]  About eight hours after the bombing, he said we were doing a drill at the exact same places at the exact same time.
[00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:13.905]  The only difference was our scenario was simultaneous bombings on the exact same trains and exact same bus at the exact same area.
[00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:20.710]  And then it came out Saturday that the bombings were within sixty seconds of each other.
[00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.771]  They were simultaneous.
[00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:28.435]  Now the exercise is one hundred percent
[00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:29.920]  Exact.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.821]  Exactly as 9-11.
[00:12:33.522 --> 00:12:40.626]  Hijacked jets, drills of them flying into the exact same targets at the exact same time.
[00:12:40.806 --> 00:12:43.667]  Do you understand the magnitude of this?
[00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:54.874]  And these fools, these fools compartmentalized the minions that were running the drill who obviously weren't involved so they were blathering about it all over TV and radio.
[00:12:55.535 --> 00:12:58.916]  And no one noticed it until we were sent squadrons of emails.
[00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.838]  We would have had this out even earlier, but the emails were all jammed up and we had problems.
[00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:04.619]  And listeners pointed this out.
[00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:05.979]  We got the clips and broke it.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.080]  It's all because of you.
[00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:10.981]  All because of you.
[00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:13.823]  We could beat these people, folks.
[00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:14.643]  We're very close.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.821]  The transcript is as follows, and we're going to play it later.
[00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:20.102]  Power!
[00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:34.448]  At half past this morning, we were actually running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning.
[00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:38.850]  So I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright now.
[00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:39.631]  Host!
[00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:46.556]  To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you could cope with it, and it happened while you were running the exercise.
[00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:47.056]  Power!
[00:13:47.477 --> 00:13:49.198]  Former Scotland Yard anti-terror expert.
[00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:50.339]  Precisely!
[00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:53.021]  And it was about half past nine, right at the time of the bombings.
[00:13:53.841 --> 00:14:00.566]  We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons, I don't want to reveal their name, but they're listening, and they'll know it.
[00:14:00.867 --> 00:14:02.528]  That's London Underground, folks.
[00:14:03.602 --> 00:14:21.387]  And we have a room full of crisis managers for the first time they've met and so within five minutes we had a pretty rapid decision that this is real and so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on.
[00:14:22.173 --> 00:14:27.882]  Click here for the clip of the dialogue, click here for the longer clip where the comments can be heard in their full context.
[00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:35.093]  In fact, the exercise mirrored the exact locations and times of the bombings is light years beyond a coincidence.
[00:14:35.638 --> 00:14:39.182]  Power said the drill focused around simultaneous bombings.
[00:14:39.642 --> 00:14:43.726]  At first the bombings, for two and a half days, were thought to have been spread over an hour.
[00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:48.971]  But the BBC reports just today that the bombings were in fact simultaneous.
[00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:57.460]  Mr. Power, pictured above, and visor consultants need not have been in on the bombing or anything of that nature for it to be important.
[00:14:58.421 --> 00:14:59.342]  The British government
[00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:05.692]  Or one of their private company offshoots could have hired Visor to run the exercises for a number of purposes.
[00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:08.535]  The exercise fulfills several different goals.
[00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:17.381]  It acts as a cover for the small, compartmentalized government terrorists to carry out their operation without the larger security services becoming aware of what they were doing.
[00:15:17.702 --> 00:15:22.445]  Again, that covers the echelon, uh, keyword snooping, and they go, oh, that's just a drill.
[00:15:22.826 --> 00:15:25.808]  And more importantly, if they get caught during the attack or after
[00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:31.412]  With any incriminating evidence, they can just claim that they were just taking part in an exercise.
[00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:40.279]  And then they also have the consultancy firm then to spin into propaganda hour one, and then not even knowing they're part of the operation.
[00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:41.020]  This is incredible.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.142]  This is precisely what happened on the morning of 9-11-2001.
[00:15:44.162 --> 00:15:51.188]  The CIA was conducting drills of flying hijacked planes at the WTC and Pentagon at 8-30 in the morning.
[00:15:51.974 --> 00:15:57.999]  It is clear that at least 5 of not 6 training exercises were in operation in the days leading up to and on the morning of 9-11.
[00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:02.863]  This meant that NORAD radar screens showed as many as 22 hijacked airlines at the same time.
[00:16:02.943 --> 00:16:09.788]  NORAD had been briefed that this was part of an exercise drill and therefore normal reactive procedures were for stalled and delayed.
[00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:21.478]  The large numbers of blips on NORAD screens that displayed both real drill hijacked planes explains why confused press reports emerged hours after the attack stating that up to 8 planes had been hijacked.
[00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:35.275]  The Anglo-American establishment that controls the military-industrial complex of the West has been caught over a hundred times carrying out bombings and other terrorist attacks around the world to further their corporate aims and to blame their enemies.
[00:16:36.676 --> 00:16:37.136]  The U.S.
[00:16:37.176 --> 00:16:40.758]  government has been caught planning to carry out attacks and carrying out attacks.
[00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:43.520]  The British government has been caught red-handed as well.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.224]  Members of Vladimir Putin's FSB were caught planting bombs in the Russian apartment buildings in 1999 by Moscow police.
[00:16:50.584 --> 00:16:51.845]  This is not speculation.
[00:16:52.165 --> 00:17:00.890]  Hermit Roosevelt admitted on NPR radio that in 1953 the CIA and British intelligence carried out a wave of bombings and shootings in Iran.
[00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.253]  He then went on to brag about how they subsequently blamed the bombings on Iran's President Mosaddegh.
[00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.456]  Do you understand these people brag about what they do 40 years later?
[00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:15.639]  The London bombings have the same signature as the Madrid bombings of 3.11.
[00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:23.424]  Both on these bombings are almost indistinguishable from the Bologna bombing in 1980 that killed over 80 people.
[00:17:23.924 --> 00:17:30.829]  The bombing in Bologna was part of a CIA operation codenamed Gladio, part of the NATO option, where the U.S.
[00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:35.312]  government would pay right-wing terrorists to carry out bombings to be blamed on leftists in Europe.
[00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:49.501]  All of this was blown wide open when two of the Bologna bombers were convicted in Italian court, by the way, the former Italian Prime Minister has gone public, President, excuse me, forcing them to spill their guts admitting that they were neo-fascists contracted by the CIA.
[00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:54.384]  Operation Gladio documents, we have links to all those, have since been declassified.
[00:17:54.764 --> 00:17:58.686]  The London terror level was lowered before the bombings took place.
[00:17:58.706 --> 00:18:04.630]  This gave the perpetrators extra cover to plan and execute the attack without having to evade the most stringent security.
[00:18:05.413 --> 00:18:08.296]  In any crime, you look at history and motive.
[00:18:08.336 --> 00:18:14.263]  The British government has been caught in multiple examples of carrying out bombings in London, which were then blamed on the IRA.
[00:18:14.564 --> 00:18:19.089]  They even had one of their own MI5 agents with the Omaha Bomb Squad click here for the archive of the evidence.
[00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:26.356]  The wider agenda was becoming clearer when Blair firmly points the finger at selected patsies designated to take the fall.
[00:18:26.696 --> 00:18:32.640]  But for the moment he's happy to grandstand as the courageous leader who immediately returned to London to take control of the chaos.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:39.244]  BBC polls that were showing 80% plus opposed to ID cards will now likely flip back in the opposite direction.
[00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:43.247]  Support for the European Union and increased globalization through G8 will rise.
[00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:44.629]  They made that announcement.
[00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.532]  Which stands to gain from all of this?
[00:18:46.613 --> 00:18:47.474]  Who stands to gain?
[00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:48.636]  Who has the motive?
[00:18:48.856 --> 00:18:49.538]  Or Cui Bono?
[00:18:50.293 --> 00:19:02.560]  From Putin blowing up his own apartment buildings to Israel being behind Hamas, the evidence, we have links to mainstream news there, is consistently clear that large-scale terrorism is always state-sponsored.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.741]  The Madrid train bombing is another example.
[00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:09.143]  The bombers were found to be police informants with close links to the Spanish security services.
[00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:12.025]  They had access to the most secure areas of the Madrid train stations.
[00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:18.969]  The Spanish government initially tried to blame the Basque group ETA for the blast in the hope that the people would rally behind the government and get re-elected.
[00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:22.770]  After Exxon denied involvement, the people started saying the government was involved.
[00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:29.612]  The Spanish government had to blame Al-Qaeda and kill some patsies, which they did kill all of them, by claiming they blew themselves up during a raid.
[00:19:29.933 --> 00:19:36.175]  The London government exercises were used as a fallback cover to carry out the attack.
[00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:43.857]  This is the biggest smoking gun yet, pointing directly at the most secretive levels of the British establishment itself, being behind the attack.
[00:19:43.957 --> 00:19:45.918]  More on this story as and when it develops.
[00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:47.832]  That's story number one.
[00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:52.274]  We'll play the audio clips when we get back of the head advisor actually saying this.
[00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:55.196]  And then we'll get into some other news items.
[00:19:55.216 --> 00:19:58.137]  We've got Paul Watson coming on, some of your calls, and David Icke.
[00:19:58.398 --> 00:19:58.958]  Stay with us.

[00:21:07.427 --> 00:21:11.509]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:12.349]  We listened.
[00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:17.650]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:18.411]  We listened.
[00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:21.832]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.252 --> 00:21:22.792]  We listened.
[00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:26.413]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:27.213]  We're good to go.

[00:21:53.856 --> 00:21:57.158]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:57.798]  Supreme Court.
[00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.540]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.941]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:20.942 --> 00:22:26.245]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:22.385]  I want to commend Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson, the two webmasters we've got for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:24.366]  And Steve runs InfoWars.net.
[00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:28.148]  My wife and Ryan Slickhizen run InfoWars.com.
[00:24:28.168 --> 00:24:29.388]  They did a great job as well.
[00:24:29.408 --> 00:24:34.311]  My wife's been sick for like a week, but I couldn't keep her from working this weekend.
[00:24:34.331 --> 00:24:36.132]  She's still updated InfoWars.com.
[00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:40.994]  And I took off like an hour ago to swim some laps, so I don't look like Jabba the Hutt.
[00:24:41.975 --> 00:24:42.595]  I get to the pool,
[00:24:43.382 --> 00:24:47.865]  The lifeguard goes, hey Alex, first place I went was Infowars.com to get the truth.
[00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:53.849]  And then there's like six people at the local neighborhood pool, six, seven people, and another guy sitting there reading a book.
[00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.230]  He goes, older gentleman.
[00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.751]  He goes, yeah, I went to your site first.
[00:24:56.791 --> 00:24:57.572]  You're right on.
[00:24:57.592 --> 00:25:02.815]  I mean, my point is, is I even go to the swimming pool here locally and people are waking up and involved.
[00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:03.956]  I don't know that lifeguard.
[00:25:04.316 --> 00:25:07.038]  I don't know that guy sitting there reading a Louis L'Amour book.
[00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:09.920]  I mean, I don't know these people.
[00:25:11.783 --> 00:25:13.764]  So again, we're really having an effect.
[00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:15.925]  And I want to commend everybody.
[00:25:16.245 --> 00:25:25.169]  Now here is the former Scotland Yard terrorism expert with Visor Consultants, who are running these simultaneous drills at the exact same time.
[00:25:25.469 --> 00:25:32.111]  Here's the BBC4 piece, BBC Radio 5, excuse me, and then we'll play this ITN piece.
[00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:34.072]  Go ahead and roll this piece.
[00:25:35.147 --> 00:25:40.091]  The thing that concerns me is that what are we doing for the thousands of men and women actually who are in London working?
[00:25:40.111 --> 00:25:51.380]  And I say that because at half past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for over a company of a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations that happened this morning.
[00:25:51.781 --> 00:25:54.123]  So I still had the hairs on the back of my legs turning upright.
[00:25:54.223 --> 00:26:00.668]  If you get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were running the exercise?
[00:26:00.948 --> 00:26:01.448]  Precisely.
[00:26:01.648 --> 00:26:03.549]  And it was about half past nine this morning.
[00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:07.171]  We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons I don't want to reveal their name, but they're listening and they'll know it.
[00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:13.674]  We had a room full of crisis managers for the first time they met, and so within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision that this is the real one.
[00:26:14.714 --> 00:26:21.857]  And so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on.
[00:26:21.898 --> 00:26:22.358]  That's all.
[00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:24.899]  Okay, so within minutes of the bombings,
[00:26:26.013 --> 00:26:27.854]  They know that it's real.
[00:26:28.294 --> 00:26:36.916]  But for an hour and a half, Scotland Yard, which this guy used to head up, is saying, oh, it's an electrical search to keep the story under control so they can manage the story.
[00:26:37.616 --> 00:26:45.759]  And then again, this is used so the elements that actually carried out the attack would have a smoke screen to operate, just as they did with 9-11 and so many other operations.
[00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:49.160]  It's like when the Feds cooked the bomb and trained the drivers in the first World Trade Center attack.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.821]  It was supposedly a sting operation, but then they just let them bomb.
[00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:58.017]  It's the same thing with the Klan group in Dallas and Fort Worth in the late 1990s.
[00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:01.919]  Creating groups to try to get them to bomb things.
[00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:03.960]  But this time they're not even producing patches.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.462]  This time Blair's blocking an investigation right now.
[00:27:09.223 --> 00:27:11.784]  Folks, it's hard to pull these things off and not get caught.
[00:27:12.044 --> 00:27:13.405]  They just count on you being gullible.
[00:27:13.705 --> 00:27:15.105]  This ITN's a little bit longer.
[00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:17.006]  We'll play as much of it as we can going into the break.
[00:27:17.246 --> 00:27:21.449]  This is the same guy, Mr. Power, on ITN saying basically the same thing.
[00:27:21.589 --> 00:27:22.169]  ITN TV.
[00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:39.507]  Today we were running an exercise for a company, bearing in mind I'm now in the private sector, and we sat everybody down in the city, a thousand people involved in the whole organisation, but the crisis team, and the most peculiar thing was, we based our scenario on the simultaneous attacks on the London Ground and Main Line station.
[00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:43.788]  So we had to suddenly switch an exercise from fictional to real.
[00:27:44.388 --> 00:27:49.169]  And one of the first things is, get that bureau number, when you have a list of people missing, tell them.
[00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:58.005]  Just to get this right, you are actually working today on an exercise that envisioned virtually this scenario?
[00:27:58.506 --> 00:27:59.186]  Almost precisely.
[00:27:59.306 --> 00:28:06.593]  I was up until 2 o'clock this morning because it's our job, my own company, We specialize in helping people to get their crisis management response.
[00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:09.375]  How do you jump from slow time thinking to quick time doing?
[00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:11.938]  And we chose a scenario with their assistance.
[00:28:12.498 --> 00:28:17.741]  Which is based on a terrorist attack because they're very close to a property occupied by Jewish businessmen.
[00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:21.763]  They're in the city and there are more American banks in the city than there are in the whole of New York.
[00:28:22.203 --> 00:28:23.043]  A logical thing to do.
[00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:29.447]  And it... I've still got the... How extraordinary today must feel for you as it unfolds.
[00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:34.549]  You mentioned a few moments ago there our experience with Irish Republican terrorism.
[00:28:34.709 --> 00:28:37.150]  And of course it was very different, wasn't it?
[00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.871]  Because however
[00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:51.820]  So, there you have it, folks.
[00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:54.702]  Just unbelievable.
[00:28:54.762 --> 00:28:57.764]  The classic signature, the classic M.O.
[00:28:58.745 --> 00:29:04.669]  Now, we broke another major story this weekend that unfortunately has been dwarfed by this one, but it's just as important.
[00:29:05.069 --> 00:29:07.971]  Bombscares suggest Blair knew and did nothing.
[00:29:09.071 --> 00:29:10.492]  High-level alert.
[00:29:11.272 --> 00:29:12.333]  And this was in Sheffield.
[00:29:12.413 --> 00:29:13.954]  It's never been bombed in a terror attack.
[00:29:13.994 --> 00:29:15.315]  Hasn't been bombed since the Blitz.
[00:29:15.815 --> 00:29:17.096]  It's where Paul Watson lives.
[00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:18.757]  His brother Steve lives in London.
[00:29:19.978 --> 00:29:25.281]  And we'll get into this article with Paul Watson when he joins us coming up here after this quick break.
[00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:28.723]  And then I'm going to jam calls in before David Icke joins us.
[00:29:29.463 --> 00:29:31.945]  I know that you want to get involved on air.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.181]  We'll give each caller 60 seconds.
[00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:36.501]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:36.962]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:36.982 --> 00:29:43.765]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:48.747]  And we will continue to give you... There's a bunch of new developments with the bombing we haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:51.848]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.888 --> 00:29:52.828]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.909]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.929 --> 00:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.445 --> 00:30:07.946]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.187]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.167]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:13.127]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:30:13.307 --> 00:30:18.169]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:19.529]  Check out this new product.
[00:30:19.689 --> 00:30:22.590]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.650]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.331]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:30:29.551 --> 00:30:34.374]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:30:34.654 --> 00:30:37.776]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:30:37.896 --> 00:30:43.300]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.161]  Trinobio.
[00:30:44.281 --> 00:30:45.261]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:46.762]  No B.O.
[00:30:46.822 --> 00:30:49.343]  is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:30:49.524 --> 00:30:52.405]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B.O.

[00:31:03.742 --> 00:31:14.447]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.827 --> 00:31:19.349]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:30.735]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.335 --> 00:31:38.177]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.577 --> 00:31:40.717]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:41.197 --> 00:31:46.178]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[00:32:01.741 --> 00:32:04.322]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:07.943]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:32:08.063 --> 00:32:08.443]  Shocking?
[00:32:08.543 --> 00:32:08.983]  Of course!
[00:32:09.263 --> 00:32:11.343]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:32:11.483 --> 00:32:14.364]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:32:14.564 --> 00:32:15.944]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[00:33:15.137 --> 00:33:18.520]  Alright, Jimmy Paul Watson on the line.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.426]  I'm just dragging him on air because he deserves a lot of credit for breaking these massive news stories as well.
[00:33:26.466 --> 00:33:39.757]  Understand, the British government was contracting through the London Underground with a private consultancy firm of quote, how to handle terrorist events and how to have basically a PR event out of it.
[00:33:39.777 --> 00:33:43.701]  They're running a thousand person exercise with the government and others
[00:33:44.666 --> 00:34:00.158]  of bombs going off at the exact same places that were hit at the exact same times except Mr. Powers, the former Scotland Yard anti-terror expert said, in our exercise though, it was instant, it was simultaneous bombings.
[00:34:00.178 --> 00:34:04.301]  This is what he was saying on Thursday night and that's not what happened here.
[00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:06.262]  We know they were over, you know, 45 minutes.
[00:34:06.883 --> 00:34:09.545]  Oh, but now it turns out they were simultaneous.
[00:34:10.546 --> 00:34:13.608]  So now it's absolutely precisely the same.
[00:34:14.292 --> 00:34:19.477]  And we're going to go to Kevin and Curtis and Wyatt and many others here in a few minutes and get into a bunch of other developments.
[00:34:19.998 --> 00:34:20.838]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:33.691]  But Paul Watson, just massive developments and the Internet and even some mainstream news publications are coming right out and pointing their fingers squarely at those that have the motive.
[00:34:34.583 --> 00:35:03.509]  uh... the uh... western intelligence agencies uh... massage him that in my five in my six s a s c i a defense intelligence because all these groups are interlocked are indistinguishable now thanks for coming on with us paul good to be here alex uh... paul give us a your analysis of uh... the simultaneous drills at the exact same locations well it's we've got to make the point that we're not saying that this uh... peter powers or his
[00:35:04.275 --> 00:35:11.519]  consultancy agency, of which he's the managing director, were in any way behind the bombings.
[00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:21.324]  I mean, what the government would have done is hired them, and basically the unnamed company made reference to has got to be London Underground itself.
[00:35:21.784 --> 00:35:27.347]  It can't fathomably be anyone else, which London Underground is basically the government.
[00:35:27.427 --> 00:35:29.408]  It's semi-private, but
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:39.942]  It's important to make that point that we're not saying that they were involved, but it acts as what I call the culpability cover for the attack.
[00:35:40.222 --> 00:35:55.525]  If anyone connected to the government was caught in the act of planting bombs or anything related to the bombing, then they could have used that exercise as the excuse to say it was just part of the exercise.
[00:35:56.275 --> 00:36:02.018]  And then they'd be backed up, obviously, by the visor consultants who have no knowledge of the overall operation.
[00:36:02.198 --> 00:36:08.742]  Exactly, and that's a key point we make, because clearly, in these compartmentalized situations, they can't tell people all the details.
[00:36:09.142 --> 00:36:11.423]  Visor thinks that it's really part of this plan.
[00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:15.826]  It's carrying out the drill of the bombings at the exact same locations.
[00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:17.287]  A thousand people involved.
[00:36:17.627 --> 00:36:19.768]  The authorities involved in this.
[00:36:19.848 --> 00:36:24.711]  Obviously, they wouldn't be letting them run a drill with a thousand people down there drilling for all of this.
[00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:28.854]  And this guy's, you know, former top anti-terrorism expert at Scotland Yard.
[00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:32.316]  Clearly he wouldn't be out blowing the hair on the back of my neck standing up.
[00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.117]  This is incredible.
[00:36:33.437 --> 00:36:40.942]  Exact same locations, exact same time, uh, except ours were simultaneous and then it comes out it was simultaneous.
[00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:42.583]  He wouldn't have shot his mouth off.
[00:36:42.603 --> 00:36:44.105]  He's clearly not involved.
[00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:47.667]  No, he admitted it on the very day.
[00:36:47.687 --> 00:36:51.350]  I mean, that interview was recorded the very afternoon it happened.
[00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.551]  And you're right.
[00:36:53.459 --> 00:36:59.568]  The fact that the bombings were simultaneous only came out on Saturday afternoon.
[00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:07.118]  It was on BBC Saturday afternoon and the interview he gave was on Friday afternoon, sorry, Thursday afternoon.
[00:37:07.816 --> 00:37:13.723]  So he didn't... At that point, the government said the timeline was that the bombs occurred within 45 minutes of each other.
[00:37:14.203 --> 00:37:15.925]  That is, the underground bombs.
[00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:24.075]  The one on the bus obviously occurred later, because they're speculating that it was destined for another station, but it somehow malfunctioned.
[00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:34.043]  Now, we have the London Guardian or Observer, I've got the article here on the stack, reporting on drills months ago, but why aren't they focusing on this drill?
[00:37:34.063 --> 00:37:35.503]  I don't think this is very interesting.
[00:37:35.723 --> 00:37:37.603]  Why are they suddenly all quiet about this?
[00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:42.104]  Well, there were many drills over the course of the past four or five years.
[00:37:42.144 --> 00:37:53.026]  I think Simon Aronowitz mentioned that on the show on Thursday, but to have the specific drill at the same stations that were bombed at the same time, because the bombings are simultaneous,
[00:37:53.712 --> 00:37:55.334]  That is beyond coincidence.
[00:37:55.374 --> 00:37:56.254]  That's impossible!
[00:37:56.375 --> 00:38:03.101]  I mean, it's just like a drill of flying hijacked jets into the World Trade Center in Pentagon at the exact same time it's really happening!
[00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:04.342]  I mean, come on, folks!
[00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:09.793]  Well, look, I mean, take the Lone Gunman episode that Fox TV put out.
[00:38:10.174 --> 00:38:11.894]  It aired, what, four or five months before 9-11.
[00:38:12.634 --> 00:38:15.235]  And in it, they go, it's a counter-terrorism war game.
[00:38:15.535 --> 00:38:17.896]  And he goes, we're only meant to think it's a war game.
[00:38:18.156 --> 00:38:20.537]  That's the cover for flying the plane into the building.
[00:38:20.777 --> 00:38:22.978]  The government's going to do it to blame it on Muslims.
[00:38:23.398 --> 00:38:26.339]  I mean, the globalists just flaunt this in our face, folks.
[00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:32.261]  I mean, even in, you know, made-for-TV shows, they flaunt using drills as the cover.
[00:38:33.365 --> 00:38:33.745]  Well, yeah.
[00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:47.390]  If you get the box set of Lone Gunman as well, the producers talk about the episode and say, as they were filming the shots of the World Trade Center from the helicopter, the police and the Port Authority would freak out if they got anywhere near it.
[00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.592]  And they were astonished that 9-11 would have been allowed to happen.
[00:38:51.712 --> 00:39:00.815]  And then I had the Lone Gunman star, Dean Haglund, show up at my door with a camera, wanting to interview me, going, yeah, we think the CIA planted this on us.
[00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:05.305]  Yeah, they said they were getting scripts towards the end of the expiles.
[00:39:06.105 --> 00:39:10.847]  But the thing about this bombing that interests me now is the post-attack propaganda.
[00:39:11.407 --> 00:39:19.191]  Because I believe it's overwhelmingly designed to turn us into a similar situation to Israel, where you have bombers in major cities every day.
[00:39:19.847 --> 00:39:23.390]  uh... checkpoints and evacuations germany saying that the u.s.
[00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:33.818]  is saying that two days before the bombing they announced the end of posse commentatis oh troops to keep you safe in the washington post and new york times uh... absolutely they're saying oh see the national i.d.
[00:39:33.858 --> 00:39:35.799]  cards are needed now in england and the u.s.
[00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:46.668]  paul well we had two evacuations of two major areas of two major cities in the past three days birmingham city center on saturday night birmingham
[00:39:47.379 --> 00:39:51.242]  Of course, being the second biggest UK city.
[00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:55.425]  20,000 people evacuated from the city centre due to a bomb scare that turned out to be nothing.
[00:39:56.006 --> 00:40:00.669]  And the police said they got a specific warning of a time and a place that the bombing would happen.
[00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:07.234]  So the regular police are, you know, just doing their job, thinking this is a real threat in evacuating the people.
[00:40:07.254 --> 00:40:09.316]  But the question is, who put the phone call through?
[00:40:09.716 --> 00:40:10.937]  It wasn't the IRA.
[00:40:11.157 --> 00:40:15.961]  And since when did Al-Qaeda, if you believe Al-Qaeda exists, last phone in a warning?
[00:40:16.499 --> 00:40:17.600]  You know, who made the call?
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.582]  It's an outright fear-mongering campaign from a government who've been caught faking terror alerts before.
[00:40:23.362 --> 00:40:36.049]  And then we have another problem, which is people reporting everything and anything as a suspicious package, which led to 8,000 people being evacuated from an area of Sheffield, my hometown, earlier today.
[00:40:36.669 --> 00:40:38.170]  And again, it turned out to be nothing.
[00:40:38.775 --> 00:40:42.796]  So, in that sense, you know, the government doesn't even have to fake alerts.
[00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:45.677]  The people are so apprehensive that they're fueling the fear.
[00:40:45.717 --> 00:40:49.018]  Well, it's like if you get one sheep to run over the cliff, the rest are going to follow.
[00:40:49.938 --> 00:40:53.219]  Yeah, and we also hear this same line over and over again.
[00:40:53.279 --> 00:40:59.401]  Londoners are getting back to normal, normal life, you know, stiff upper lip while they're grieving for the victims.
[00:40:59.421 --> 00:41:02.902]  That's the veneer beneath the fear that the government is promulgating.
[00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:04.662]  And now the death toll is up to 80?
[00:41:06.143 --> 00:41:07.163]  Yeah, but I mean,
[00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:11.762]  What the government's putting out about how people are getting back to normal is a total lie.
[00:41:11.982 --> 00:41:15.084]  My brother travelled on the London Underground on Friday.
[00:41:15.484 --> 00:41:17.065]  It was completely empty.
[00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:21.148]  Most Londoners are just glad it wasn't them, and they're scared to death.
[00:41:21.168 --> 00:41:22.829]  I know, and my parents are so reckless.
[00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:25.551]  They're over there right now, riding around on the London Underground.
[00:41:27.595 --> 00:41:35.825]  Well, they've got the veneer of, you know, everyone's getting back to normal, whereas beneath it, everyone's scared, which is why these bomb alerts keep happening, because people are reporting anything.
[00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:44.356]  And the fact that the attack was so much more down-to-earth than 9-11 means that people are expecting bombs and alerts everywhere they go, and they're feeding into it.
[00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:50.881]  Which has led, as we've seen in the news today, to this call for body scanners, which they're going ahead with.
[00:41:51.362 --> 00:41:51.902]  That's right.
[00:41:52.063 --> 00:41:54.565]  These scanners we've been seeing for four years in some U.S.
[00:41:54.625 --> 00:42:02.692]  airports, for three years in four airports, where you're totally naked and they record a digital image of your biometric, you know, your body.
[00:42:03.933 --> 00:42:06.636]  It's a better view of your naked body than the eye gives you.
[00:42:06.656 --> 00:42:09.139]  It even shows the pores on your skin.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.542]  And now they're going to put those in the London Underground.
[00:42:11.782 --> 00:42:14.245]  Three points, Paul, and I'm going to let you go because I'm going to take some calls.
[00:42:14.285 --> 00:42:15.166]  I appreciate you coming on.
[00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:17.629]  I know you're working on several other big stories right now.
[00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:21.773]  And folks, you need to keep sending Paul all the tips over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:24.011 --> 00:42:25.232]  A couple different items here.
[00:42:25.592 --> 00:42:28.315]  Number one, it's come out that Netanyahu was warned.
[00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:34.400]  Several different private intelligence firms and the Israelis are now confirming that he indeed was warned beforehand.
[00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:36.582]  I want you to comment on that.
[00:42:36.942 --> 00:42:45.370]  And then also, we now have tracked the servers with the upload of this Al-Qaeda threat that wasn't even a real quote out of the Koran.
[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.932]  And it's just praising whoever did it.
[00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.954]  But we were all told that this was people taking credit.
[00:42:50.726 --> 00:42:59.028]  This shoddy job has now been linked directly to servers connected to the CIA in Maryland and Houston, Texas.
[00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:00.648]  So, Paul, cover those two items.
[00:43:01.968 --> 00:43:16.831]  Well, with the Netanyahu thing and the Israel connection, which is already being used by people to tarnish anyone who dissents as being anti-Semitic, surprise, surprise, when nobody has said that Israel carried out the bombing, just that they were warned by Scotland Yard.
[00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:21.884]  And we had one of the big terror experts on the weekend come out and confirm it.
[00:43:22.304 --> 00:43:34.128]  It's now common knowledge within intelligence circles that not only before the first blast was Netanyahu warned, but actually Israel was sending warnings two days before the bombing.
[00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:45.690]  Which is why, as with the other article we put out, there were bombing alerts in major cities like my own, exactly just under two days before the London bombing.
[00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.691]  Yeah, 36 hours before.
[00:43:48.652 --> 00:43:50.994]  Let's cover this now.
[00:43:51.034 --> 00:43:56.899]  Let's get into, Bomb Scare Suggests Blair Knew and Did Nothing by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:43:57.299 --> 00:43:58.920]  This also came out on Saturday morning.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.541]  Tell us about it, Paul.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.602]  Oh yeah, it was Tuesday evening, less than two days before the bombing.
[00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:12.465]  My two housemates came home, we both work in the centre of Sheffield, and said exactly the same thing.
[00:44:12.485 --> 00:44:23.909]  They spoke to policemen at different bus terminals, and half the city was talking about it basically, that there was a bomb alert, and they were searching buses for bombs.
[00:44:24.049 --> 00:44:26.310]  Buses were delayed by over an hour.
[00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:31.405]  Um, before the area affected was reopened again.
[00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:34.086]  And by the way, that's a big deal in England.
[00:44:34.106 --> 00:44:36.567]  You know, here in the U.S., most people don't use buses.
[00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:39.189]  What over there, what is car ownership?
[00:44:39.229 --> 00:44:40.409]  Like 30% of the public?
[00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:44.191]  So, like 70% of you use buses almost exclusively?
[00:44:44.771 --> 00:44:46.392]  Well, that's right, obviously, because the U.K.
[00:44:46.432 --> 00:44:47.853]  is far smaller than America.
[00:44:47.893 --> 00:44:50.594]  You can get from place to place on a bus pretty easily.
[00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:53.876]  Which most people do, with the car tax, is ridiculous.
[00:44:54.927 --> 00:45:19.839]  Um, and so, buses were affected during that period, and, um, the papers, the local papers and television didn't even cover it, unlike today where they're covering front page stories, this 8,000 evacuation, which is, um, on the same scale as the alert last Tuesday, but the alert last Tuesday was in none of the papers, not even on page, you know, 24.
[00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:24.802]  So there must have been an order from the South Yorkshire Police not to talk about it.
[00:45:25.162 --> 00:45:27.163]  A de-notice, as they call it in Britain.
[00:45:27.563 --> 00:45:37.910]  And you said this is just massive, I mean, you know, your two roommates, they're neighbours, they talked to the cops, people were searching buses, they called the buses back to the terminals, but nothing in the news about it, Paul!
[00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.953]  Because this totally blows away the idea that they, quote, didn't have any idea this was coming.
[00:45:43.101 --> 00:46:01.114]  That's right, and when you couple it with the intelligence warnings from the Israelis, which obviously focused on transport systems and major cities being attacked two days before, then that's a big smoking gun, and then the exercises on top of that already, what, four days after the bombing, along with the Netanyahu warning, we already have
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.102]  Three or four key smoking guns, which indicate it was an inside job.
[00:46:06.323 --> 00:46:12.666]  Well, Paul, the point you just made about how right at the same time the Israelis are warning the British, you're having the buses shut down and searched.
[00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:21.892]  I would add that to that article you wrote, and I would add the links to all these other stories at the bottom of the big story about the drills so people can see it all in context.
[00:46:22.172 --> 00:46:25.594]  I think it's important to link all this together, as we've just done right here on air.
[00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:26.634]  Now, we're about to go to calls.
[00:46:27.035 --> 00:46:27.655]  In closing,
[00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:46.893]  Yeah, that was in the London Guardian, Saturday morning, connected to Bush's sister in Houston, Texas, which most of these so-called Al-Qaeda websites are.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.203]  The main thing about... Yeah, a lot of the headings and other stuff were uploaded from there, but go ahead.
[00:46:51.663 --> 00:46:57.046]  Yeah, the main thing about the Al-Qaeda statement is, number one, it didn't take personal responsibility for the attack.
[00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:58.367]  It was in the third person.
[00:46:58.407 --> 00:46:59.828]  It nearly praised the attack.
[00:47:00.369 --> 00:47:13.978]  And number two, the MSNBC Arabic speaker analyst analyzed it, said it falsely referenced the Quran, and within hours of being posted was removed.
[00:47:14.747 --> 00:47:18.910]  But, neocons are still on the radio going, Al-Qaeda has taken responsibility.
[00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:31.419]  Well yeah, the London Times reported today, even though the British government still doesn't say who carried out the bombing, that the same people who carried out the Madrid bombing, carried out the London bombing.
[00:47:31.459 --> 00:47:35.782]  And now they're claiming it's connected to Syria, and they're saying, the new generation of Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:36.222 --> 00:47:42.647]  Paul Watson, I want to commend you for the great job you did this weekend, with myself and others putting together these articles.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:47.164]  And I appreciate it, and we've got several new articles coming out today, correct?
[00:47:48.424 --> 00:47:50.845]  Yeah, a warning to the world article.
[00:47:51.245 --> 00:47:58.666]  I'll also be putting up an article about what I talked about earlier, how they're trying to turn us into Israel with all these fake alerts and fear mongerings.
[00:47:58.686 --> 00:48:00.427]  There are at least two more going up today.
[00:48:00.587 --> 00:48:01.947]  How long till we see those articles?
[00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.068]  Within the next four or five hours they'll be up there.
[00:48:06.368 --> 00:48:07.448]  Alright, well done Watson.
[00:48:08.257 --> 00:48:08.917]  Appreciate it.
[00:48:09.257 --> 00:48:09.757]  Take care.
[00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:13.478]  All right, let's go to Kevin in Alabama, then Curtis, Wyatt, and others.
[00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:14.379]  Kevin, thanks for holding.
[00:48:14.399 --> 00:48:14.739]  Welcome.
[00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:16.299]  What's going on, Mr. Jones?
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.060]  Doing a radio broadcast.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.500]  What's on your mind, Kevin?
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:27.823]  Yesterday I went through a hurricane down here in Mobile, Alabama, and I've been through thunderstorms that have been worse than this hurricane.
[00:48:28.143 --> 00:48:32.824]  I just want to know what you know about weather morphing technology, and do you believe in it?
[00:48:34.159 --> 00:48:47.562]  Well, I know Secretary of Defense Cohen talked about it in a speech in 1998, we have that posted, saying that weather wars and tectonic earthquake weapons and volcanic weapons will be the weapons of the future and the main threat, greater than nuclear.
[00:48:47.962 --> 00:48:51.003]  That's what he said on a radio and TV and a press conference.
[00:48:51.803 --> 00:49:00.705]  And I know that I've got about two different bills admitting the existence of these, but I mean hurricanes have always been hitting Florida and I'm not saying that it's the government doing this.
[00:49:02.595 --> 00:49:04.116]  I have watched tropical storms.
[00:49:04.536 --> 00:49:07.897]  I have watched the weather around here in Mobile, Alabama.
[00:49:08.197 --> 00:49:10.338]  There are chemical trails everywhere.
[00:49:10.678 --> 00:49:13.119]  There have been chemical trails... I know they have weather modification.
[00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:23.062]  We had a big flood a few years ago in Texas that killed 35 people and they later admitted the Navy was doing weather modification when these super storms formed that were like dumping 8 inches of water an hour.
[00:49:23.082 --> 00:49:24.022]  Yes sir.
[00:49:24.142 --> 00:49:25.503]  I have a question for the globalists.
[00:49:25.883 --> 00:49:31.925]  What are the globalists going to do when the good people of the world like me and not hippies
[00:49:32.535 --> 00:49:34.056]  are out there protesting.
[00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:37.837]  Instead of having sticks and signs, we're going to have AK-47s.
[00:49:37.857 --> 00:49:39.898]  I want to know what they're going to do about that.
[00:49:40.178 --> 00:49:41.639]  Alright, thank you for the call, Kevin.
[00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.320]  Curtis in Toronto, Canada.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:44.780]  Go ahead.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.140]  Oh, hey Alex.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.022]  I'm a big fan of yours, so it's exciting to get through two quick points.
[00:49:50.422 --> 00:49:58.145]  The first thing with the bombings that happened, like a lot of people were saying, you know, they told people it was electrical surges for the first hour, like
[00:49:58.922 --> 00:50:05.724]  Well, like a lot of people think, like, oh, that's just... And meanwhile, the people running the drill with the government openly say that they knew minute one.
[00:50:06.465 --> 00:50:11.787]  Yeah, and not only that, but, like, even if you believe they said that, just so that they didn't, like, cause panic.
[00:50:11.847 --> 00:50:14.728]  I mean, they could have evacuated those areas had they told people.
[00:50:14.828 --> 00:50:15.728]  So, like, it's ridiculous.
[00:50:15.748 --> 00:50:18.529]  Yeah, all their bombs hadn't gone... Globalist bombs hadn't all gone off.
[00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.810]  During the bust, they had to wait, yeah.
[00:50:21.758 --> 00:50:35.091]  Yeah, also, like, there's this 9-11 movie coming out with Nick Cage in it, and I, you know, I just thought that was a lot after Nick Cage had done the National Treasure movie, you know, being a complete shill, covering everyone, like, uh, you know, because he's not a good guy.
[00:50:35.111 --> 00:50:36.873]  Is he a drug harmer making one?
[00:50:36.993 --> 00:50:41.477]  Well, I don't know, but, you know, like, why they're using him as their top shill, you know?
[00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:43.279]  What's the name of the movie?
[00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:49.413]  I don't know if there's a name yet, but he was just signed on to do it this week, and it's going to be about 9-11.
[00:50:49.433 --> 00:50:52.975]  So, you know, after he's already done National Treasurer, it's going to be a little different.
[00:50:52.995 --> 00:50:56.497]  Yeah, he'll have, you know, Bruckheimer makes, did the private lynch thing.
[00:50:56.517 --> 00:50:57.918]  He does false news reports.
[00:50:58.219 --> 00:50:58.879]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:05.652]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.912 --> 00:51:07.493]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:07.525]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.185 --> 00:54:10.527]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:16.590]  David Icke's coming up from London.
[00:54:18.732 --> 00:54:29.098]  By the way, was Jerry Bruckheimer, I mean he produces propaganda flicks like Black Hawk Down that covered up what really happened concerning Somalia and we've had the
[00:54:29.719 --> 00:54:37.561]  People who've written books on the subject, military people who were involved in the operations, who were there on this broadcast, by the way.
[00:54:39.642 --> 00:54:41.262]  And then he produced the private lynch thing.
[00:54:41.442 --> 00:54:46.564]  They knew for two days that they'd saved her and she was at the hospital and the Iraqi troops had pulled out.
[00:54:47.704 --> 00:54:55.126]  Bruckheimer, via satellite, told the troops how to bust in the door, what to say, what to do, how to script it, and that was in the BBC.
[00:54:56.534 --> 00:55:00.718]  And I did during the break confirm that he's coming out with some new 9-11 movie.
[00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:04.821]  I mean, it's just, folks, it never ends, okay?
[00:55:05.422 --> 00:55:06.383]  It never ends.
[00:55:06.723 --> 00:55:09.345]  Wyatt in Maryland, you're on the air, Wyatt, go ahead.
[00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:10.807]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:55:10.867 --> 00:55:15.150]  Great show, great listening to Paul, too, about what's going on in London.
[00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.353]  You know, you have to be a monkey on crack not to believe what's going on.
[00:55:21.821 --> 00:55:38.290]  I had, uh, you remember when the Bode Brothers, the French film crew, doing a documentary on the firefighters on 9-11, and they caught the first plane going into the first tower, and shortly, about 10 seconds after it hit, you clearly saw a jet fighter scoot by.
[00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:39.690]  No, that's on the video.
[00:55:40.071 --> 00:55:41.111]  Yeah, from left to right.
[00:55:41.151 --> 00:55:42.112]  Yeah, it is.
[00:55:42.152 --> 00:55:44.313]  They edited it out many times when they show it again.
[00:55:44.333 --> 00:55:46.094]  They show it, but it was on the original.
[00:55:46.796 --> 00:55:53.300]  And, uh, I threw in another documentary that I had from 2002 from PBS.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.441]  I just happened to find it.
[00:55:55.022 --> 00:56:03.207]  And I threw it on there, and lo and behold, after the second tower's hit, there's a close-up, a pretty good close-up, on both towers.
[00:56:03.787 --> 00:56:07.270]  And the jet goes past both of them, clear as day.
[00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:08.650]  Well, that's in Road to Journey, sir.
[00:56:09.031 --> 00:56:09.391]  Oh, it is?
[00:56:09.471 --> 00:56:10.932]  I haven't gotten that yet.
[00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:12.891]  I will get it, though.
[00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:13.871]  I just haven't got it.
[00:56:13.911 --> 00:56:14.672]  I didn't realize that.
[00:56:14.992 --> 00:56:16.933]  But I just thought, you know, this is amazing.
[00:56:17.754 --> 00:56:20.755]  That must have been the cover jet that they were going to use.
[00:56:20.795 --> 00:56:24.157]  But specifically, what do you think about the bombings in London?
[00:56:24.598 --> 00:56:39.606]  Well, as soon as I heard about it, my first early report at 5.30, quarter to six in the morning, was there were some explosions, maybe electrical, in the tunnels, in the train tunnels down there.
[00:56:41.352 --> 00:56:46.275]  So I didn't pay too much attention to it, then, as later on the day went on, found out what happened.
[00:56:46.795 --> 00:57:06.646]  I knew right away, as soon as Tony Blair came on, pulled himself away from the G8 meeting, oh my goodness, and made this pronouncement, that little speech he made, well I know sure and well, like everybody else knows, that the British people have been up in arms about this identification card that they want to jam down their throat.
[00:57:07.372 --> 00:57:09.653]  So this is a pretext to have that taken place.
[00:57:09.853 --> 00:57:10.854]  You know that and I know that.
[00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:11.874]  I hear you Wyatt.
[00:57:11.914 --> 00:57:12.815]  Thank you for the call.
[00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:14.155]  And let me just say this.
[00:57:15.056 --> 00:57:17.056]  Four and a half million cameras in London.
[00:57:18.157 --> 00:57:27.681]  They're now admitting that in the London Underground, just in the areas where the bombings took place, the three bombings and the trains, that there were 8,000 plus cameras.
[00:57:28.082 --> 00:57:29.322]  Many of them with audio.
[00:57:30.483 --> 00:57:31.183]  Where is it?
[00:57:32.987 --> 00:57:35.329]  Well, they'll have to doctor that video first for you.
[00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:42.034]  We can't see the nice white guys or the cops getting off the buses or the cops getting off the trains before they go boom boom.
[00:57:43.575 --> 00:57:47.078]  And it's now being reported that where the bus blew up there were over a hundred cameras.
[00:57:47.438 --> 00:57:49.219]  Folks, that's how many cameras they've got.
[00:57:49.539 --> 00:57:50.440]  Eight thousand!
[00:57:51.381 --> 00:57:56.805]  Eight thousand in the areas where the trains got bombed and over a hundred where the bus got bombed.
[00:57:56.825 --> 00:57:58.446]  I mean, do any of you buy this?
[00:57:58.546 --> 00:57:59.387]  Come on, folks.
[00:58:00.074 --> 00:58:02.656]  Get my film, Martial Law, and learn who was behind 9-11.
[00:58:02.917 --> 00:58:04.338]  Get 9-11 on the road to tyranny.
[00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:05.239]  Get the videos.
[00:58:05.299 --> 00:58:05.979]  Make copies.
[00:58:05.999 --> 00:58:06.940]  Get them out to people.
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:08.641]  Expose the globalists.
[00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:16.068]  The toll-free number to get the new film, Martial Law, and stop procrastinating is 1-888-253-3139 or go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order.

[00:58:28.355 --> 00:58:36.418]  Take a few more of your calls in this next segment and we've got David Icke joining us from London.
[00:58:36.438 --> 00:58:37.599]  It should be very interesting.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:45.902]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:58.901]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.561 --> 00:59:00.601]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.341 --> 00:59:02.422]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.082 --> 00:59:03.922]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.683 --> 00:59:05.543]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.563 --> 00:59:09.904]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.424 --> 00:59:14.546]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.726 --> 00:59:18.267]  All right, hour number two.
[00:59:18.307 --> 00:59:20.808]  David Icke joining us from London, coming up in about eight minutes.
[00:59:21.208 --> 00:59:22.428]  Your call is here momentarily.
[00:59:22.468 --> 00:59:23.909]  I'm going to jam a few of you in here.
[00:59:25.806 --> 00:59:30.409]  Massive new developments concerning the London Underground bombings and the bombing of the bus.
[00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:41.717]  The former top terrorism expert at Scotland Yard's company, Visor, was running drills at the exact same spots at the exact same time with the exact same thing happening.
[00:59:42.338 --> 00:59:44.779]  And he said this on the day of the event, hours after it.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:52.125]  He said, the only difference is really, we had simultaneous bombings and then now it comes out that they were simultaneous, not spread out over 45 minutes.
[00:59:53.526 --> 00:59:55.247]  Just a bunch of new big developments.
[00:59:55.407 --> 00:59:56.688]  So much here to talk about.
[00:59:58.228 --> 00:59:59.289]  David Ike coming up.
[00:59:59.769 --> 01:00:02.230]  Right now, let's go to Kevin in New Jersey.
[01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.011]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:00:04.632 --> 01:00:05.292]  Oh, Kevin hung up.
[01:00:05.312 --> 01:00:05.872]  Who's up next?
[01:00:07.413 --> 01:00:08.173]  David in Illinois.
[01:00:08.193 --> 01:00:08.734]  You're on the air.
[01:00:08.794 --> 01:00:09.414]  Go ahead, David.
[01:00:09.534 --> 01:00:10.134]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:11.955]  I'm not your regular David from Illinois.
[01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.436]  I'm a brand new caller.
[01:00:13.496 --> 01:00:14.957]  There's a lot of Davids from Illinois to call.
[01:00:14.977 --> 01:00:15.717]  What's on your mind, David?
[01:00:15.817 --> 01:00:16.597]  Yeah.
[01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:21.700]  Well, first of all, since I'm a new caller, I want to say I've been listening to you on and off for about four years.
[01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.953]  And I really just want to commend you, give you a pat on the back for all your hard work.
[01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:29.836]  I'm a lot like you, I'm 31, I think you're 31, 32?
[01:00:29.896 --> 01:00:29.836]  31!
[01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:37.001]  Yeah, and I'm a Christian, I'm a truth seeker, and I'm also a journalist.
[01:00:37.182 --> 01:00:39.603]  I'm not a big time guy, just not important at all.
[01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:50.452]  But I want to commend you for putting the truth out there and also for inspiring people like me and other, especially Christians, because we have to remember that
[01:00:51.056 --> 01:00:56.843]  Uh, we have not been given a spirit of fear, but a spirit of sound mind and love and of power.
[01:00:57.404 --> 01:01:01.990]  And I think if everyone out there who considers themselves a follower of Christ would remember that,
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:14.029]  Well, you know, a few years ago I said that God protects those of us that are fighting the New World Order, that God is with us if we're doing right, and I got made fun of for that.
[01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:16.270]  How cynical are these other patriots?
[01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:21.815]  That when we say we love God and God's protecting us, and people ask, why am I still alive?
[01:01:21.835 --> 01:01:23.136]  Because that's how God wants it to be.
[01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:24.978]  I mean, they shouldn't mock God, boy.
[01:01:25.038 --> 01:01:26.039]  That is really bad.
[01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:26.599]  Oh, no.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.002]  Yeah, and the thing is that Satan's kingdom
[01:01:30.575 --> 01:01:31.616]  It lives on fear.
[01:01:31.876 --> 01:01:36.478]  And if people would get this into their heads... Yeah, we shouldn't be afraid.
[01:01:36.558 --> 01:01:39.840]  We should be afraid not to take action and not to expose these people.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.460]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.722]  Call me back some other time, David, when we've got more time here.
[01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.063]  Robert in Denver.
[01:01:46.143 --> 01:01:46.883]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:01:48.484 --> 01:01:49.284]  You're on the air, Robert.
[01:01:49.304 --> 01:01:49.825]  Good morning.
[01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:51.025]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[01:01:51.045 --> 01:01:51.866]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:51.886 --> 01:01:56.168]  Yeah, I think I just want to... I didn't have really anything specific, but I just want to echo the last caller, David.
[01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:56.608]  He's right.
[01:01:56.648 --> 01:01:59.089]  At the end of the day, it's a simple...
[01:02:01.104 --> 01:02:02.225]  Thank you for the call, Robert.
[01:02:02.265 --> 01:02:02.805]  John in Boston.
[01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:03.966]  John, you're on the air.
[01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:04.286]  Go ahead.
[01:02:04.306 --> 01:02:05.447]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:02:24.266 --> 01:02:25.787]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment.
[01:02:26.387 --> 01:02:28.248]  I did call in about the cameras in London.
[01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:40.913]  I mean, I've been to London, I've seen the cameras, especially in the tube stations, and the fact that they didn't have anything on air within hours like they did on 9-11, I find that kind of disturbing.
[01:02:41.193 --> 01:02:49.136]  Four and a half million cameras, 8,000 just in the area of the city and the tube where the trains were bombed.
[01:02:49.856 --> 01:02:50.317]  Exactly.
[01:02:52.011 --> 01:02:55.673]  There's so much that they can hide and doctor while we can't see them.
[01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:58.274]  And that really concerns me.
[01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:03.077]  And here in Boston, again, another report today, putting up more cameras all over the city.
[01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:05.758]  So I think we know now it doesn't stop terrorism.
[01:03:05.818 --> 01:03:06.939]  It's all federally funded.
[01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:10.540]  And then when the cops beat you up on camera, it always malfunctions when you subpoena.
[01:03:11.441 --> 01:03:11.801]  Of course.
[01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.382]  And they left all the cameras here from the DNC.
[01:03:15.043 --> 01:03:16.844]  So I think that's another big problem.
[01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:18.424]  They never took those down.
[01:03:18.564 --> 01:03:19.405]  What was it?
[01:03:19.645 --> 01:03:20.886]  Like $500 million worth?
[01:03:20.906 --> 01:03:21.566]  They just leave it all?
[01:03:22.259 --> 01:03:23.379]  Of course they do.
[01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:24.239]  This never goes away.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.120]  No.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:26.940]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:27.940]  Thank you.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.181]  By the way, Tony Blair is now blocking an investigation.
[01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:34.962]  He's now blocking an investigation.
[01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:36.922]  Folks, you want him, you got him.
[01:03:37.682 --> 01:03:42.924]  Former BBC reporter, champion goalie, former head of the Green Party, best-selling author, lecturer.
[01:03:43.644 --> 01:03:45.984]  David Icke joins us from the United Kingdom.
[01:03:46.685 --> 01:03:48.685]  The Enchanted Isle, when we get back.
[01:03:53.388 --> 01:04:00.234]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.534 --> 01:04:01.916]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.116 --> 01:04:04.338]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.478 --> 01:04:06.560]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.764]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.104 --> 01:04:16.148]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.388 --> 01:04:18.150]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:28.882]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.042 --> 01:04:30.925]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.305 --> 01:04:34.946]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns on the Infowars.
[01:04:35.086 --> 01:04:36.646]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.066]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:37.086 --> 01:04:39.487]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:39.507 --> 01:04:40.547]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:52.748 --> 01:04:56.011]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.071 --> 01:05:00.254]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.494 --> 01:05:03.276]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.476 --> 01:05:05.878]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.078 --> 01:05:14.725]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:14.905 --> 01:05:16.266]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:05:16.466 --> 01:05:20.589]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:21.249]  We're good to go!
[01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.072]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.332 --> 01:05:59.174]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:59.475 --> 01:06:00.295]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.735 --> 01:06:04.838]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.078 --> 01:06:09.281]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:14.524]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.486]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:24.008]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.288 --> 01:06:27.009]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:28.209]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:42.076 --> 01:06:42.457]  Big Brother.
[01:06:42.497 --> 01:06:43.298]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:43.318 --> 01:06:44.339]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:03.672]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:05.272]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.993 --> 01:07:09.895]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.155 --> 01:07:14.277]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.438 --> 01:07:21.682]  Eight minutes, twenty-three seconds into the second hour of transmission against the New World Order system.
[01:07:23.042 --> 01:07:25.384]  We're joined by championship
[01:07:26.577 --> 01:07:37.987]  British goalie, BBC top broadcaster, former head of the Green Party in the UK, best-selling author, and of course, worldwide lecturer, David Icke.
[01:07:38.027 --> 01:07:44.312]  And I set David up about a week ago to come on the broadcast to talk about the G8 and his analysis of that.
[01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:47.795]  Because me and David agree on about 95-98% of things.
[01:07:48.516 --> 01:07:53.680]  His analysis of the New World Order, the banking system, the government, their propaganda is just excellent.
[01:07:54.389 --> 01:07:57.930]  And then of course, David gets off into a few other issues that I don't really cover.
[01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:00.831]  But here today, he's welcome to talk about anything he wants.
[01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:06.492]  We're going to be going to David and I here in just a minute or two, recapping for a lot of stations that just joined us.
[01:08:07.113 --> 01:08:13.854]  London underground bombing exercise took place at the same time as real attack.
[01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.015]  And we posted this story Saturday morning.
[01:08:17.075 --> 01:08:22.897]  It has been mentioned in major newspapers and publications in Canada, in Italy, in Japan.
[01:08:24.016 --> 01:08:25.997]  Total news blackout in the U.S.
[01:08:26.857 --> 01:08:31.079]  and in England, of course, in the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:39.783]  A consultancy agency with Government Police Connections, former head of terrorism for Scotland Yard, admitted on BBC Radio 5 and then on ITN.
[01:08:39.803 --> 01:08:42.544]  We have those audio and video clips on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:42.584 --> 01:08:44.405]  We'll be playing those short clips later in this hour.
[01:08:45.586 --> 01:08:48.287]  The head of it openly said, Mr. Peter Power,
[01:08:49.412 --> 01:08:52.495]  That the hair on the back of my neck is standing up.
[01:08:52.715 --> 01:08:58.961]  We were doing drills at the exact same train stations, the exact same areas, the exact same places, at the exact same time.
[01:08:59.942 --> 01:09:03.425]  He said the only thing that was different was we did simultaneous bomb drill.
[01:09:03.465 --> 01:09:08.870]  And then it came out two days later on Saturday, he said this on Thursday night, that it was simultaneous bombs.
[01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:15.210]  This is the same thing with 9-11 where they were running drills of flying hijacked jets for the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:18.252]  Open public CIA drill came out a year and a half after.
[01:09:18.272 --> 01:09:20.134]  This is admitted, Associated Press.
[01:09:20.695 --> 01:09:22.556]  So, folks, it's the same M.O.
[01:09:22.596 --> 01:09:26.640]  to cover for the real government agencies that are carrying out the attack.
[01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:30.904]  And in case any of them get caught, then they can say they were just part of the drill.
[01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:39.511]  And that way, Echelon, picking up the chatter before the bomb, they can just tell people inside the government who are compartmentalized that it's part of the drill.
[01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:42.353]  It's the same MO with the first World Trade Center bombing.
[01:09:42.393 --> 01:09:43.974]  It's the same MO with Oklahoma City.
[01:09:44.215 --> 01:09:46.216]  They were running a sting and a drill that morning.
[01:09:46.937 --> 01:09:47.577]  That's admitted.
[01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:50.560]  We're not saying that the advisor consultant is involved.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:50.760]  No!
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.103]  If they were involved, they wouldn't be on air saying, oh, the hair on the back of my neck standing up.
[01:09:55.143 --> 01:09:55.804]  We were hired.
[01:09:56.084 --> 01:10:03.752]  You know, by the London Underground, we've now been learning that from our sources, he said unnamed group that hired us, well it was in the London Underground, it's the British Government.
[01:10:05.814 --> 01:10:08.697]  So again folks, this is so, so important.
[01:10:08.717 --> 01:10:11.640]  They wouldn't be out publicly saying this if they were involved.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.947]  They were hired separately to create a fog of war, a darkness that the New World Order could see through.
[01:10:19.528 --> 01:10:22.430]  We now have confirmed that Netanyahu was specifically warned.
[01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:23.991]  This is all over the mainstream news.
[01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:39.780]  We have learned that Netanyahu was specifically warned, and two days before, the Israelis gave them specific threat analysis for Sheffield, London, and other areas, and they had a big evacuation in Sheffield today, where my webmaster Paul Watson is operating right now.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.221]  Well, 36 hours before the London blast,
[01:10:43.163 --> 01:10:45.104]  They've never had a drill like this in Sheffield.
[01:10:45.124 --> 01:10:46.844]  They have never been bombed by the IRA.
[01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:54.887]  They've never been bombed since the Blitz ended in the early 1940s, mid-early 1940s.
[01:10:56.087 --> 01:10:59.149]  But they drilled, they evacuated the buses, they searched for bombs.
[01:10:59.669 --> 01:11:02.090]  The police, we've talked to the police, we've talked to locals.
[01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:05.991]  Everybody in the city knows about it, but it was never in the newspaper.
[01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:09.652]  Wouldn't a giant bomb scare be newsworthy?
[01:11:09.692 --> 01:11:11.933]  Again, covering this up.
[01:11:13.276 --> 01:11:15.157]  Just so many facets to this.
[01:11:15.757 --> 01:11:17.519]  David Icke, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.122]  David, you've heard my analysis.
[01:11:22.162 --> 01:11:25.224]  I know on your website, DavidIcke.com, you've been posting a lot of the same stories.
[01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:29.587]  You're an expert on British-sponsored terrorism, problem-reaction solution.
[01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:32.109]  Why don't you give us your analysis of this?
[01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.649]  Well, it's pretty much the same, really.
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.991]  This modus operandi is nothing if not predictable.
[01:11:39.371 --> 01:11:47.233]  And, to be honest, I've had to order a new supply of sick bags to carry around with me because I might catch a newspaper headline or a Blair speech.
[01:11:47.253 --> 01:11:58.096]  First of all, as a lot of people who've contacted me have pointed out, one thing that really gives so much away is Blair himself.
[01:11:58.656 --> 01:12:01.037]  When you are in a state of
[01:12:01.812 --> 01:12:05.334]  True revulsion and true horror at what has happened.
[01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.496]  You don't have to act.
[01:12:09.797 --> 01:12:18.343]  There's a guy on British television, he's an impersonator, who actually takes off Blair brilliantly and after he's said a sentence in Blair's
[01:12:19.478 --> 01:12:27.284]  Delivery mode, he'll stop and he'll go, look to the right, hold two seconds, look back, move eyes, and then he'll say the next sentence.
[01:12:27.524 --> 01:12:36.471]  And he's got into a T. These people are acting, and they have to act, because they do not have the same level of emotional reaction that the rest of us have.
[01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:39.414]  Now, David, your voice is so powerful that you're overdriving.
[01:12:39.454 --> 01:12:40.455]  Can you back off the phone now?
[01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:41.015]  Yeah, okay.
[01:12:41.355 --> 01:12:42.236]  Go ahead.
[01:12:42.276 --> 01:12:44.318]  So, the first time that
[01:12:45.539 --> 01:12:49.301]  You hear Tony Blair's reaction to an event like this.
[01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:54.183]  The alarm bells go off because the guy has no genuine emotion at all.
[01:12:54.563 --> 01:12:55.924]  He's singing from a song sheet.
[01:12:56.464 --> 01:13:02.246]  And this whole scenario in London has been so desperately predictable.
[01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:04.668]  On one side you hear people say,
[01:13:06.318 --> 01:13:11.561]  This was predictable because Al Qaeda was going to bomb London at some point.
[01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:13.622]  Well, that's the song sheet.
[01:13:14.063 --> 01:13:20.446]  The reason it was predictable is because there's basically two columns running simultaneously.
[01:13:20.967 --> 01:13:31.713]  There's the column with the agenda being ticked off, which was, to a very large extent, detailed by the Project for the New American Century in that September 2000 document.
[01:13:32.273 --> 01:13:33.674]  And then on the right-hand column,
[01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:39.414]  You've got what is necessary to bring about the events in the first one.
[01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:48.504]  And we reached a point clearly when the, if you like, the 9-11 effect was starting to wane.
[01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:55.551]  And I don't think the 9-11 effect has gone on as long as they thought it would in terms of manipulating public opinion.
[01:13:56.072 --> 01:13:56.672]  We had in
[01:13:57.649 --> 01:14:03.075]  America, Bush's rating in terms of himself and support for the Iraq war going down.
[01:14:03.115 --> 01:14:11.063]  And over here, I mean, for a long time now, the word liar and Blair have been interchangeable in the public mind.
[01:14:11.464 --> 01:14:15.548]  I mean, this guy, because we have an appalling opposition on purpose
[01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:16.606]  I think?
[01:14:36.134 --> 01:14:44.100]  Who had lost credibility and were losing it rapidly in terms of having any effect on persuading the public to go to the next stage.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.601]  And let me list a few of those.
[01:14:45.661 --> 01:14:49.524]  The Patriot Act's re-up and expansion was in desperate trouble.
[01:14:49.984 --> 01:15:00.752]  The Downing Street Memo was the coup de grace or the cherry on top of all the fake Niger weapons documents and all the MI6 fake documents and all the
[01:15:01.813 --> 01:15:03.855]  Other fake documents that Bush had brought forward.
[01:15:04.095 --> 01:15:06.418]  The national ID card scheme was stalling.
[01:15:06.698 --> 01:15:11.703]  The Brits were threatening to revolt in the streets as they did over the poll tax in the early 1980s.
[01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:17.388]  The European Union was having setback after setback with its EU expansion.
[01:15:17.948 --> 01:15:21.949]  People were demanding Bush start a timetable to pull out of Iraq.
[01:15:21.969 --> 01:15:25.189]  Same thing with Blair being demanded by the people in Britain.
[01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:29.470]  And people were mad about the Supreme Court ruling saying there's no private property.
[01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:34.951]  People were mad about Bush's supposed picks for the Supreme Court being pro-torture Gonzalez.
[01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:39.432]  And so their entire agenda globally was getting stuck in the mud.
[01:15:40.072 --> 01:15:43.992]  And everywhere people were waking up to the problem, reaction, solution paradigm.
[01:15:44.233 --> 01:15:45.173]  So I agree with you.
[01:15:45.213 --> 01:15:46.793]  They had to re-energize.
[01:15:48.354 --> 01:15:54.978]  Because they seem to have so much power, Alex, but actually they're incredibly limited in their perception.
[01:15:55.479 --> 01:16:01.443]  They have power by living in a slightly bigger box than they keep the rest of the population in.
[01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:10.930]  And like a rat caught in the corner, it reacts in a predictable way and these people are incredibly predictable.
[01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:12.491]  And so what do they do?
[01:16:12.871 --> 01:16:14.372]  They go for the
[01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:23.950]  The thing that they've used all along, which is fear, get people in a state of fear is their operandi.
[01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:30.394]  And they will then look to authority to protect them from what they've been manipulated to fear.
[01:16:30.874 --> 01:16:35.517]  And so this is why the London bombing was so predictable.
[01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.098]  And of course, it's not the last.
[01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:54.064]  And one of the real positive things and encouraging things, which you must have found as well as me since this event happened, is the number of people, I don't know about you, but I've never had a reaction from people on the scale that I have in terms of pace.
[01:16:54.104 --> 01:16:54.784]  Most instantly.
[01:16:54.924 --> 01:16:55.565]  We've seen it.
[01:16:55.785 --> 01:16:56.306]  We've seen it.
[01:16:56.326 --> 01:17:00.149]  This is the official story, the Nonsense is Problem, Reaction is Solution.
[01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.892]  So we're making serious inroads.
[01:17:03.596 --> 01:17:13.263]  On their ability to manipulate people, and I say this to anyone listening, if you're aware of this, if you've come into this understanding, please don't keep it to yourself.
[01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:19.827]  Tell other people, and if they just, you know, don't accept it initially, well, it's a very simple thing that I've learned over the years.
[01:17:20.468 --> 01:17:22.649]  People cannot unhear something.
[01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:30.915]  And so often people have rejected what I've said in the past and what other people have said in the past, but as the passage of events unfolds since,
[01:17:31.557 --> 01:17:33.258]  Well, David, it's like planting a seed.
[01:17:33.338 --> 01:17:34.359]  It doesn't come up right away.
[01:17:34.379 --> 01:17:37.461]  You don't instantly, you know, defeat the New World Order.
[01:17:37.481 --> 01:17:38.261]  And I'll say this.
[01:17:38.381 --> 01:17:40.222]  I've done 2,600 radio interviews in the last four years.
[01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:58.122]  And right after 9-11, almost four years ago, I got resistance.
[01:17:58.663 --> 01:18:07.466]  Now, everybody I talk to is waking up, and instantly on 9-11, you know, I knew what had happened, a lot of people didn't, you knew what had happened, and we had all the evidence.
[01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:11.688]  But with this bombing, I wasn't saying day one it was the government.
[01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:13.608]  I said all the evidence points that direction.
[01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:14.829]  We've got to look at it.
[01:18:15.209 --> 01:18:21.777]  But major publications, pretty mainstream people came out more radical than Alex Jones and said they did it!
[01:18:22.177 --> 01:18:25.061]  So literally it's like the 100th monkey.
[01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:30.627]  People are just almost instinctively becoming immune to this propaganda, David.
[01:18:31.328 --> 01:18:35.753]  The tide is turning and we've got some years ahead of us.
[01:18:36.289 --> 01:18:42.895]  When what thinks it's the immovable force, the Illuminati agenda, is going to face the irresistible force.
[01:18:43.235 --> 01:18:45.217]  And that's the truth emerging at last.
[01:18:45.658 --> 01:18:46.038]  That's right.
[01:18:46.058 --> 01:18:47.319]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[01:18:47.339 --> 01:18:47.840]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.722 --> 01:18:57.625]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:57.845 --> 01:19:10.132]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:10.553 --> 01:19:10.953]  The U.S.
[01:19:10.993 --> 01:19:16.576]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:16.977 --> 01:19:19.178]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.039 --> 01:19:22.120]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:25.001]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:31.123]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:34.904]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:41.327]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:19:41.887 --> 01:19:45.890]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:48.592]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:48.972 --> 01:19:49.773]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:51.014 --> 01:19:56.978]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:57.338 --> 01:20:06.144]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:11.148]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.608 --> 01:20:18.336]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:18.736 --> 01:20:30.469]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:30.989 --> 01:20:35.453]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:20:53.526 --> 01:20:56.028]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.411]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:16.304]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[01:21:17.265 --> 01:21:22.470]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:21:23.257 --> 01:21:31.218]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:56.046]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:56.626]  Why?
[01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.587]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:04.609]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:38.967]  Or visit heartdrop.com for more information.
[01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.128]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:22:40.148 --> 01:22:41.709]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:23:00.617 --> 01:23:07.001]  By the way, this broadcast has dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM affiliates.
[01:23:08.202 --> 01:23:14.527]  We're getting new ones all the time, and we get a lot of the Arbitron rating from these stations, and our listenership is just exploding.
[01:23:15.598 --> 01:23:22.885]  Also, we use the internet, and one of our internet streams is routinely number one on ShotKast of 3,000 radio stations and networks.
[01:23:23.345 --> 01:23:29.171]  Well, right now, almost all of our streams are completely full, so we've got to turn those streams up even more.
[01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:31.333]  I mean, again, I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:36.257]  The point is, the people are hungry for the truth, and they're accepting of it now.
[01:23:36.618 --> 01:23:40.061]  They instinctively know what's going on, as a species.
[01:23:40.742 --> 01:23:42.264]  And I was talking to David Eichner in the break.
[01:23:42.304 --> 01:23:44.629]  He says everybody he's talking to is waking up like never before.
[01:23:45.069 --> 01:23:48.455]  And I mean, I've had David on for, you know, six, seven years, and he's been pretty pessimistic in the past.
[01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:50.519]  I mean, he's saying the same thing I'm saying.
[01:23:50.619 --> 01:23:51.441]  I've been pessimistic.
[01:23:52.245 --> 01:24:03.630]  This is explosive, but it doesn't mean the globalists aren't going to carry out even bigger attacks to try to put us back in the box, but I think they're blind to what David just called that irresistible force.
[01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:17.256]  David, I want to get into these millions of cameras, but they're not showing us any video of the bombings, but before we do that, let's talk about this awakening that's happening, because, I mean, I really think that the globalists are in trouble.
[01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:19.097]  Yeah.
[01:24:21.858 --> 01:24:26.239]  To sum up, I think one of your websites, it's an information war, if you like.
[01:24:26.279 --> 01:24:27.280]  It's an information battle.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:42.925]  I was saying to someone earlier today, these guys do not control the mainstream media, impose a single view of reality, and try desperately to suppress all alternatives to that because they think it's a bit of fun.
[01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:46.666]  They do it because that is fundamental
[01:24:47.239 --> 01:24:52.402]  To them achieving their aim, which is to bring about the global Orwellian state.
[01:24:52.982 --> 01:24:56.524]  So the antidote to that is information.
[01:24:56.744 --> 01:25:07.049]  This is why, you know, over the centuries, people who have given an alternative view to authority, whoever they may be, have always been targeted by authority throughout history.
[01:25:07.537 --> 01:25:12.362]  It's because an alternative view dilutes the power of the official view.
[01:25:12.822 --> 01:25:30.901]  And what's been happening, thanks to the internet and thanks to people who've dedicated their lives to informing people of what's really going on behind the smoke screens, is that we've reached the situation now where this information, this alternative understanding of what's going on, has reached such a scale
[01:25:31.656 --> 01:25:35.519]  But it's starting to kick in, what you mentioned earlier, the 100th monkey syndrome.
[01:25:35.559 --> 01:25:40.983]  This is very, very important, because I've been talking about this for years, and this is what we're now seeing happening.
[01:25:42.844 --> 01:25:49.569]  In a new book that I've brought out a few weeks ago, I talk about infinite love is the only truth, everything else is illusion.
[01:25:49.589 --> 01:25:55.793]  I talk about the DNA, and how the DNA is actually a receiver transmitter of information.
[01:25:56.634 --> 01:26:06.136]  And when the emphasis is a certain view, then we are like transmitting a radio station around each other.
[01:26:06.577 --> 01:26:09.637]  And whatever view is the dominant one is the one that people are picking up.
[01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:12.778]  It's a bit like being connected by a computer to the internet.
[01:26:12.978 --> 01:26:15.179]  Well, it's like a feedback loop.
[01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:17.499]  And you know, what you're getting into is pretty cutting edge.
[01:26:17.519 --> 01:26:21.080]  But actually, they thought 96% of the DNA wasn't used.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.881]  And now they're finding even top scientists we've had on
[01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:27.104]  That it is some type of electrochemical receiver.
[01:26:27.465 --> 01:26:27.965]  Exactly.
[01:26:28.045 --> 01:26:38.858]  So, what's happening is, as this alternative view of reality is getting more and more out, if you like, literally filling the human internet,
[01:26:39.599 --> 01:26:44.124]  More and more people are accessing that on a non-conscious level.
[01:26:58.802 --> 01:26:59.342]  I don't
[01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:24.091]  We are transmitting on that frequency represented by that code within the species.
[01:27:24.392 --> 01:27:27.873]  Now the human species has exactly the same situation.
[01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:31.194]  We are transmitting on the species frequency if you like.
[01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:40.358]  And what happens then is as the pioneers, the first hundred monkeys if you like, start to understand the new reality
[01:27:41.369 --> 01:27:56.882]  What happens is they start to transmit this information on this, if you like, human internet system through the DNA, and then people start to access it, just like logging into the internet, and they're receiving this information unknowingly, but it affects them and the way they see the world.
[01:27:57.403 --> 01:28:00.105]  And I've been talking about this for years, but the point will come
[01:28:00.996 --> 01:28:12.628]  Where there will be a transformation of human perception and it will happen without vast numbers of people either reading my books or listening to one of your shows or anything.
[01:28:12.668 --> 01:28:16.933]  They'll just instinctively know and that's what we're seeing unfold and that
[01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:26.235]  Means that the New World Order will remain a desperate hope for these people and never its fully blown, fully fledged reality.
[01:28:26.255 --> 01:28:30.458]  Alright, I want to get into the bombing itself when we get back and later get to some calls.
[01:28:30.578 --> 01:28:34.301]  Stay with us, we're talking to quite an interesting fella, David Icke.
[01:28:34.721 --> 01:28:37.524]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:28:37.564 --> 01:28:38.985]  His website is DavidIcke.com.
[01:28:43.837 --> 01:28:46.822]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.743 --> 01:28:50.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.255 --> 01:28:57.077]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:28:57.157 --> 01:29:02.240]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:08.623]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:29:08.904 --> 01:29:14.547]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:20.310]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:24.392]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:29:24.412 --> 01:29:30.695]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:29:30.715 --> 01:29:31.836]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:31.856 --> 01:29:36.278]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:29:36.298 --> 01:29:40.920]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:29:41.101 --> 01:29:43.982]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[01:29:44.203 --> 01:29:49.118]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com and order today.
[01:29:49.338 --> 01:29:51.665]  A Garicus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!

[01:29:55.179 --> 01:29:59.280]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.301]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.381 --> 01:30:09.102]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.282 --> 01:30:12.283]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.483 --> 01:30:14.883]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.003 --> 01:30:19.724]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:19.924 --> 01:30:34.494]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[01:31:57.038 --> 01:32:01.901]  We're about to go back to David.
[01:32:01.981 --> 01:32:05.283]  I go over the latest bombing, where he thinks the globalists are going in the future.
[01:32:05.524 --> 01:32:07.665]  He has predicted a lot of things very accurately.
[01:32:08.786 --> 01:32:09.946]  And take your calls.
[01:32:10.127 --> 01:32:12.108]  David will be with us for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:32:13.048 --> 01:32:14.109]  The next hour and 26 minutes.
[01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:18.712]  Before we go back to David, folks, my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[01:32:18.752 --> 01:32:19.633]  It's a mini-series.
[01:32:19.713 --> 01:32:21.594]  It covers the latest police state developments.
[01:32:22.341 --> 01:32:27.283]  Then it details how the globalists, how the New World Order cabal carried out 9-11.
[01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:29.663]  It's fact!
[01:32:29.763 --> 01:32:30.243]  We prove it!
[01:32:31.404 --> 01:32:44.908]  And then we get into the occult elite from Bohemian Grove to Skull and Bones to the Bushes and Hitler to Schwarzenegger and what their master plan is and how this cult of death is running the planet, or attempting to.
[01:32:46.298 --> 01:32:47.501]  It is my crowning achievement.
[01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:48.524]  It is my best work.

[01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:53.995]  And David Icke's new book is out.
[01:33:54.015 --> 01:33:54.976]  I've read several of his books.
[01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:55.516]  They're excellent.
[01:33:55.536 --> 01:33:56.316]  I haven't read the new one.
[01:33:56.954 --> 01:34:08.501]  I mean, he's written well over ten books, made a whole bunch of videos, they're very interesting, and definitely gets you thinking, and most of it I totally agree with, some of it I just can't document so I don't get into.
[01:34:08.841 --> 01:34:14.665]  But go to DavidIke.com to get those, and we'll tell you how to get them in more detail before David leaves us.
[01:34:14.705 --> 01:34:17.307]  We'll also do it at the very end of this hour, here in about 25 minutes.
[01:34:17.347 --> 01:34:26.032]  But David, I wanted to first off, since you brought up this instinctive thing, just briefly, because I want to get into the details of the bombing and get your take on it.
[01:34:27.933 --> 01:34:28.413]  A story.
[01:34:28.673 --> 01:34:33.115]  You know, my family owns a couple thousand acres we got from Spanish land grants in 1829.
[01:34:33.155 --> 01:34:35.536]  And so I go out and visit the family property in East Texas.
[01:34:36.636 --> 01:34:42.499]  And several times as a teenager, I'd grab a .22 rifle and go out, you know, target practicing, walking through the woods.
[01:34:43.419 --> 01:34:45.080]  You know, big ranches around us.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.220]  Nobody's ever out there.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:54.203]  And on two separate occasions, when you're out there walking for hours, really get tuned in to your sixth sense that everybody knows we have, to your discernment,
[01:34:55.134 --> 01:34:57.455]  I would feel something, and somebody's looking at me.
[01:34:57.835 --> 01:35:13.299]  And one time I walked about 400 yards into the woods, down a path, up to a hill where there was a tree, and some guy was illegally bowhunting out of season up there, and he said, yeah, I was watching you the whole time, and I said, well, you're poaching, get out of here, and it's off season, or I'm going to call the game warden.
[01:35:13.639 --> 01:35:15.040]  Then that happened another time.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:23.642]  I've had experiences where I have a really bad feeling when I was growing up in Dallas, and then somebody comes around a corner in a nice neighborhood and tries to mug me.
[01:35:24.182 --> 01:35:31.145]  You know, we've all, the diamond mines and opal mines in Australia, this has even been on PBS, they never question it.
[01:35:31.645 --> 01:35:40.608]  One of the aborigines will come out of the mine and say, I gotta go home, fly me on a helicopter, my mama just died, my daddy just died, and they're always right.
[01:35:40.988 --> 01:35:46.610]  So what you're saying is true, it is certainly there, I don't think we can control it, and I don't get all into it.
[01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:51.154]  Trying to get into it is dangerous, and the Bible says that.
[01:35:51.174 --> 01:35:53.997]  It leads into a whole dangerous labyrinth of things.
[01:35:54.037 --> 01:36:00.885]  But another area, and then I wanted to get your take on this, is, you know, like nine, ten people invented radio the same week.
[01:36:02.386 --> 01:36:03.528]  You know, turn of the last century.
[01:36:04.289 --> 01:36:09.234]  A whole bunch of civilizations within a couple year period invented the wheel.
[01:36:10.458 --> 01:36:21.122]  So I also think it's technological developments get to a certain point and then people also wake up where the information, just through normal dissemination, gets out there and then gets widely accepted.
[01:36:21.162 --> 01:36:21.702]  Your comments?
[01:36:22.663 --> 01:36:29.865]  Well, you know, all around the world, the native people, like in Africa, they have a thing they call the Bush Telegraph.
[01:36:30.346 --> 01:36:39.029]  I was talking to a Zulu shaman about this in South Africa a few weeks ago and he was pointing out that what the Bush Telegraph is, is this
[01:36:39.793 --> 01:37:08.463]  Connection that we have on the sixth sense level you talk about Alex and what has happened is that when you get into those other levels of ourselves and you know I think you've mentioned earlier depending on which scientist you talk to between 90 and 97 percent of DNA is known by science as junk DNA because they don't know what it does you know as I've said in my book you know we've got having a laugh I mean why is it there then?
[01:37:09.105 --> 01:37:13.869]  It's there because it's operating on levels that we're not consciously aware of.
[01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:28.742]  Now, once you get to those sixth sense levels, and you start operating on them, you are in this world, but you're not of it in terms of where you're observing it from, and you start to get... It can only be described as unknowing.
[01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:30.483]  You've just described it.
[01:37:31.444 --> 01:37:35.628]  I know you knew that someone was watching you, even though you had no evidence to suggest that it did.
[01:37:36.518 --> 01:37:54.123]  And what the Illuminati have done is structure society and these additives in food and electromagnetic pollution, all these things that affect the chemical balance of the brain and our ability to operate on multi-levels through these levels of DNA that they call junk.
[01:37:55.064 --> 01:37:59.925]  The whole society is structured to stop us going there so that our only
[01:38:00.919 --> 01:38:02.303]  We're good to go.
[01:38:09.389 --> 01:38:17.214]  What they've tried to do is isolate us in the five senses and cut us off from these other... David, back off the phone, sorry.
[01:38:17.534 --> 01:38:27.501]  ...these other senses and they've made sure that they dominate, coming back to what we were talking about earlier, they dominate the five sense level of information.
[01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:36.167]  So when you read a paper or you watch mainstream media with eyes or you listen to a radio with ears, you are getting their version of events.
[01:38:36.747 --> 01:38:44.552]  The antidote to that is to go beyond that, where no matter what people are saying, no matter how they're smiling, you know they're not telling the truth.
[01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.974]  You know the official story's not right.
[01:38:47.074 --> 01:38:50.156]  And those are the levels they're trying to keep us from accessing.
[01:38:50.236 --> 01:38:51.377]  Well, David, let me add this.
[01:38:51.917 --> 01:38:53.718]  I have stopped watching television.
[01:38:53.779 --> 01:38:57.401]  I mean, I will, if I have to, and during a big event, I'll watch a few hours of it.
[01:38:57.921 --> 01:38:58.822]  I have people that
[01:38:59.322 --> 01:39:02.183]  Catalog and watch TV and mark certain things.
[01:39:02.624 --> 01:39:04.865]  I will fast forward to that key part of the videotape.
[01:39:04.885 --> 01:39:10.107]  If I have to watch it, I consciously realize that it's projecting onto the retina of the mind.
[01:39:10.167 --> 01:39:11.248]  The scientists admit this.
[01:39:11.628 --> 01:39:13.388]  My brain is accepting this is real.
[01:39:13.689 --> 01:39:25.494]  I treat TV like it's deadly dangerous and I have found tuning completely out of television has increased my understanding and my sensitivity to the truth.
[01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:35.859]  Well, as again science has shown, when we're watching television we go into the same brain state as we are in a hypnotic trance.
[01:39:35.959 --> 01:39:37.741]  It's actually deeper than normal sleep.
[01:39:38.602 --> 01:39:43.667]  Yeah, so what they're doing all the time, I've described it in the new book, what's happening,
[01:39:44.748 --> 01:39:46.669]  We talk about humanity waking up, Alex.
[01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:48.809]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:48.829 --> 01:39:53.331]  So that's like in They Live where it's broadcasting, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[01:39:53.391 --> 01:39:56.892]  Now, David, I want to stop you right there because we've got to get into the bombing itself here.
[01:39:57.532 --> 01:40:04.274]  I'd like to get your take on the servers leading back to the Bushes and the CIA with the supposed Al-Qaeda taking credit.
[01:40:04.314 --> 01:40:05.494]  Now they admit that's all fake.
[01:40:05.914 --> 01:40:11.116]  I want to get into four and a half million cameras there in London, but they're not releasing any video of this.
[01:40:11.176 --> 01:40:11.896]  Why is that happening?
[01:40:12.316 --> 01:40:21.085]  Well, I don't know whether you've heard, but there are a number of, well, a large number now of cameras actually inside the buses.
[01:40:21.165 --> 01:40:21.405]  Yes.
[01:40:21.645 --> 01:40:25.749]  They're there to protect drivers from attack.
[01:40:25.829 --> 01:40:28.552]  We have 10 to 14 cameras per bus in Austin.
[01:40:29.705 --> 01:40:38.448]  And what has happened is, again, surprise, surprise, is the cameras on the bus that was bombed weren't working.
[01:40:38.829 --> 01:40:41.730]  According to the police, they haven't been working since June.
[01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.791]  But what about all the cameras that were around the bus?
[01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:46.411]  Well, exactly.
[01:40:46.471 --> 01:40:55.975]  I mean, you go to the Oklahoma bomb, you go to the fact that of all the international airports in all the world, in this time when there's fantastic numbers of cameras everywhere,
[01:40:56.725 --> 01:41:01.706]  The one international airport I've come across without cameras in the departure lounge is Boston Logan.
[01:41:02.606 --> 01:41:05.687]  So it's a very simple equation.
[01:41:05.747 --> 01:41:09.867]  And they seized the cameras at the Oklahoma City building, bombing and declared national security.
[01:41:10.928 --> 01:41:23.910]  Yeah, and of course they did the same with cameras around the Pentagon in terms of the bombing there or the plane that supposedly... And now Blair is saying he's going to block any official investigation.
[01:41:24.705 --> 01:41:29.287]  Yeah, the thing is that this simple red flag equation is this.
[01:41:29.907 --> 01:41:36.229]  When us seeing something or hearing something would support the official story, we see or hear it.
[01:41:36.810 --> 01:41:42.332]  When us seeing or hearing something would destroy the official story, we don't see or hear it.
[01:41:42.452 --> 01:41:43.332]  It's that simple.
[01:41:43.732 --> 01:41:51.555]  And that's why you get this apparent anomaly, which is not at all perfectly explainable, why you can cover a place in cameras
[01:41:52.336 --> 01:41:59.981]  And when you need them to, um, reveal what happened at one of these major events or assassinations, they're not working.
[01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:05.505]  17 traffic cameras between the Ritz Hotel and the Dalma Tunnel in Paris when Diana died.
[01:42:05.525 --> 01:42:07.186]  They turned off 30 minutes before.
[01:42:07.427 --> 01:42:07.727]  Yeah.
[01:42:08.207 --> 01:42:09.308]  All the police frequencies.
[01:42:09.927 --> 01:42:14.168]  According to a radio ham in the area, we're switched off for the half an hour it went on.
[01:42:14.368 --> 01:42:25.990]  And then Diana says, Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake accident very soon, she dies, we have a written record, video record, and the government says, as you say David, oh nothing to worry about.
[01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:33.431]  Yeah, so this is very simple, and like I said earlier, these guys are so predictable.
[01:42:33.672 --> 01:42:35.832]  Well that's what I was about to bring up David, let me ask you this question.
[01:42:36.428 --> 01:42:38.250]  Because we know we're starting to win.
[01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:40.352]  We know that they're incredibly arrogant.
[01:42:40.372 --> 01:42:44.216]  They're so predictable, they always have a drill to cover the real operation.
[01:42:44.517 --> 01:42:49.182]  They always grab the cameras and declare national security or say they all malfunctioned.
[01:42:49.202 --> 01:42:51.144]  By the way, over a hundred cameras on the bus.
[01:42:51.824 --> 01:42:54.325]  That is, around the bus, shooting the area where it was bombed.
[01:42:54.685 --> 01:42:55.626]  They're not talking about that.
[01:42:56.086 --> 01:43:00.228]  They do this stuff that's so blatantly... Here's an example.
[01:43:00.428 --> 01:43:04.029]  Rumsfeld said hundreds of times, Saddam has WMDs.
[01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:07.191]  Then he got on national TV and said, I never said it.
[01:43:07.631 --> 01:43:08.811]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:43:08.871 --> 01:43:09.732]  It's an urban legend.
[01:43:09.952 --> 01:43:10.732]  Doesn't he know?
[01:43:10.832 --> 01:43:12.233]  Everybody knows that's a lie?
[01:43:12.253 --> 01:43:16.715]  I mean, why did they just do such a flagrant... I mean, I'm not that smart, David.
[01:43:16.955 --> 01:43:18.616]  A five-year-old could figure this stuff out.
[01:43:18.656 --> 01:43:19.496]  They were seeing clearly.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:33.665]  Yeah, well, what's been happening, particularly since 9-11, is their panic to get this global structure in place, particularly microchip people, because this is really, really important, Alex.
[01:43:33.685 --> 01:43:40.848]  Katie Couric is now doing public service announcements saying we all need chips, and I have Andy Rooney on tape saying we all need chips to prove who the good people are.
[01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:47.511]  I talked to a CIA scientist back in 1998, who told me, in fact, no, 97, who told me
[01:43:51.367 --> 01:43:53.909]  A number of things which he wanted to get out, but he couldn't.
[01:43:54.069 --> 01:44:06.957]  And the reason he couldn't, and the microchip was the main thing he wanted to tell me, the reason he couldn't, as he showed me, as he opened his shirt, he had like a see-through plastic sachet on his chest with an orangey-golden liquid in it.
[01:44:07.557 --> 01:44:09.478]  And he said, this is why I can't speak out.
[01:44:09.739 --> 01:44:17.984]  And what had happened is that he had refused to use his scientific genius to advance this agenda, which he soon learned was going on when he joined the CIA.
[01:44:18.928 --> 01:44:19.708]  I don't know.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:45:06.165]  Make their body need this drug dependent on the drug in the patch to survive and if it's not replaced constantly then they start to die and apparently it's a very painful and long and horrible death and these patches, the drugs in the patches only last 72 hours and he said this is why I can't speak out and what he said to me was many things but particularly the microchip he said
[01:45:07.543 --> 01:45:12.105]  People think that microchipping is only about electronic tagging.
[01:45:12.145 --> 01:45:13.426]  He said yes, on one level it is.
[01:45:14.006 --> 01:45:22.249]  But even more important is not the message going from the chip to the computer, but the messages coming from the computer to the chip.
[01:45:22.389 --> 01:45:33.114]  Because according to him, first of all if he told me in 97, outside the public arena microchips are so small they can be inserted in a hypodermic needle in vaccination programs.
[01:45:33.832 --> 01:45:42.277]  And secondly, the real reason for microchips is to externally manipulate people mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[01:45:42.557 --> 01:45:48.000]  Well, they call it smart dust, and we know that whatever they're showing us today is 25 years old.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:52.282]  Exactly, and so... Well, let me stop you.
[01:45:52.362 --> 01:45:55.224]  I have a CBS News piece where they said that in 2000.
[01:45:55.804 --> 01:45:58.166]  A clip of it is in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:58.466 --> 01:46:02.448]  They have a head of a university or the Pentagon saying, in the future,
[01:46:03.369 --> 01:46:09.438]  Very soon we're going to put a chip in your brain if you've committed any crime and then we give you good thoughts and tell you what to do.
[01:46:09.518 --> 01:46:13.944]  Now the FDA has approved this Cyanotic Nerve Stimulator.
[01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:19.225]  And they force hundreds of thousands on drugs a year here in the U.S.
[01:46:19.285 --> 01:46:40.238]  Now they're talking about making you take a brain implant, and the January 2000 Army War College report that is public and in my book, Descent into Tyranny, says, we're going to use fads, we're going to use security, we're going to convince the public, by 2025, everyone will have a brain chip, and the military's... Have you seen this, David?
[01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:43.899]  I've heard lots of similar stories.
[01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:45.359]  This is on the Army's website!
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:53.781]  The agenda that they want is for every child to be microchipped at birth, and this is the reason.
[01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:54.882]  Well, they're already saying that.
[01:46:54.922 --> 01:46:57.422]  Sean Hannity gets up on TV and says every child needs a chip.
[01:46:58.302 --> 01:47:02.743]  David Couric is now doing public service announcements.
[01:47:02.763 --> 01:47:04.564]  Look, David, we're not weird for reporting.
[01:47:05.024 --> 01:47:06.764]  Oh, that weird Alex, he talks about chips.
[01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:08.705]  Folks, they're the ones pushing it!
[01:47:10.442 --> 01:47:14.485]  The reason they want this is for the very reasons that I've been talking about.
[01:47:15.025 --> 01:47:30.075]  They want to stop us being fully multi-dimensional, fully open DNA people, if you like, and they do this externally and they can hold it in the five senses in the little prison externally through the microchip.
[01:47:30.415 --> 01:47:31.896]  Now, as people are waking up,
[01:47:32.663 --> 01:47:35.024]  They want to desperately shut them down.
[01:47:35.064 --> 01:47:41.687]  I've been talking and writing about this for a decade, about the microchip is about holding us in the five cents prison.
[01:47:41.807 --> 01:47:52.032]  Well, we know, David, what the sodium fluoride admittedly does is affects the key glands that create the chemicals that have humans being truly awake and alive.
[01:47:52.693 --> 01:47:53.133]  Exactly.
[01:47:54.333 --> 01:48:01.757]  See, it's one of the things I've been talking about for a long time is that all this stuff we're talking about actually says something about the human being.
[01:48:02.457 --> 01:48:08.600]  It says that we are fantastic, fantastic expressions of life.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:22.787]  Because, as I've said before, I use this analogy, our natural state is to be fully multidimensional, opened beings, connected to the infinite consciousness that we all are.
[01:48:23.613 --> 01:48:29.656]  You know I'm a Christian, and right there in Genesis, God says we're made in His image.
[01:48:30.457 --> 01:48:36.200]  Yeah, well, if you take a ball and it's floating on a tank, that's its natural state, floating on a tank.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:40.742]  If you want to put it in an unnatural state and hold it at the bottom of the tank, then you have to do that.
[01:48:40.782 --> 01:48:41.783]  You have to hold it there.
[01:48:42.623 --> 01:48:46.185]  Because the moment you let go, zip, it's back into its natural state.
[01:48:46.645 --> 01:48:51.088]  And what they're doing is holding us, symbolically the ball, on the bottom of the tank,
[01:48:51.753 --> 01:48:56.596]  By bombarding us, as they have to, because of the nature of the genius we really are.
[01:48:57.176 --> 01:48:59.378]  Bombarding us on every level.
[01:48:59.498 --> 01:49:00.498]  The food additives.
[01:49:00.539 --> 01:49:01.599]  You look at the food additives.
[01:49:01.719 --> 01:49:03.320]  I talk about this in the new book.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.163]  They have one thing, well, many things, I'm sure, but one key thing in common.
[01:49:08.924 --> 01:49:12.546]  They are what scientists call excitotoxins.
[01:49:12.706 --> 01:49:14.347]  They affect brain cells.
[01:49:14.687 --> 01:49:17.189]  They all attack the electrochemical transmissions.
[01:49:17.729 --> 01:49:19.630]  Yeah, so does soda fluoride in the water.
[01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:20.731]  So do mobile phones.
[01:49:21.218 --> 01:49:25.799]  And all these things are, if you like, they're putting a virus in the computer.
[01:49:25.819 --> 01:49:28.380]  If you take the brain to be a fantastic computer, it is.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:30.780]  In fact, the DNA is a computer, too.
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.741]  Then they're putting a virus in the computer so it doesn't work properly.
[01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:38.182]  Well, look, they have manifest its true potential.
[01:49:38.382 --> 01:49:39.262]  They have to do that.
[01:49:39.402 --> 01:49:41.423]  David, you're absolutely right.
[01:49:41.443 --> 01:49:42.243]  I mean, but look,
[01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:49.058]  We're going to take some calls coming up and I do want to get more into the bombing because this has really got people waking up.
[01:49:49.078 --> 01:49:50.500]  There's been some big new developments.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.862]  We'll recap those when we get back.
[01:49:54.989 --> 01:49:57.830]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.110 --> 01:49:59.670]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.031 --> 01:50:04.692]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.032 --> 01:50:09.474]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.894 --> 01:50:14.055]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.295 --> 01:50:17.137]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.217 --> 01:50:21.880]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.504]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.744 --> 01:50:33.969]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.209 --> 01:50:36.631]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.128 --> 01:50:59.353]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.493 --> 01:51:07.600]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:14.906]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.026 --> 01:51:15.987]  We're good to go!

[01:52:27.918 --> 01:52:28.458]  I think so.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.361]  Elias and Kevin and Wesley and Donna and Mike, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:08.742 --> 01:53:28.446]  I tell you, David, I... Regardless of how they're doing it, of how they're manipulating us, we know they're doing it through TV and through the print media, you know, all the classical forms of propaganda, but they are obsessed, and they openly... Edward Bernays, the father, you know, of modern propaganda and advertising, Adolf Hitler, I've read his writings, you know, about switching off the thinking process.
[01:53:29.472 --> 01:53:33.034]  I mean, this is what the elite is obsessed with, and that's really what the Illuminati is.
[01:53:33.574 --> 01:53:39.657]  They are the Illumined ones, they know all the secrets, and they use those secrets against us, and they keep us in the dark.
[01:53:39.717 --> 01:53:41.578]  So, really, that's what it boils down to.
[01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:57.166]  But, Dave, before we go to these calls, getting back to the London bombings, I mean, we have a company connected to Scotland Yard, openly running drills at the exact places, exact times, being bombed at the very same time, obviously as a cover for the real operation to be carried out.
[01:53:58.104 --> 01:54:03.266]  And we have drills, you know, a day and a half before in Sheffield, getting people off the buses, but, oh, they didn't have any prior knowledge.
[01:54:03.306 --> 01:54:07.047]  And then this stuff comes out about how Netanyahu was warned, and now that's confirmed.
[01:54:07.567 --> 01:54:09.428]  I mean, people all over.
[01:54:09.488 --> 01:54:11.048]  I've never seen it this explosive.
[01:54:11.648 --> 01:54:15.669]  I mean, my mother doesn't buy into all this stuff, even though she's got a history degree and real smart.
[01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:20.251]  She can't believe it's this bad, but before she left to go to England, she goes, she goes, yeah, Alex, it's the government.
[01:54:20.311 --> 01:54:21.011]  I totally agree.
[01:54:21.251 --> 01:54:26.833]  They look, she said they looked so guilty when they did those press conferences, Bush and Blair.
[01:54:27.153 --> 01:54:34.198]  So again, it's just that instinctive thing now, not just the platter, the buffet, the feast of evidence.
[01:54:34.659 --> 01:54:34.959]  David?
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.061]  They're desperate.
[01:54:37.321 --> 01:54:44.246]  They're desperate because this wake-up is challenging and threatening everything they've worked towards.
[01:54:44.782 --> 01:54:57.992]  When people are desperate and panicky and panic stricken they make mistakes and we're going to see some massive mistakes in the future which are going to open people up even more to see the blatant nature of what's going on.
[01:54:58.032 --> 01:55:05.358]  But I think everybody I've talked to really sees it but they're afraid to speak out and get involved and I'm not saying we're out of the woods David because... No, no.
[01:55:06.218 --> 01:55:06.578]  No, no.
[01:55:06.938 --> 01:55:13.382]  We're going to have some very, very challenging and interesting years because... I mean, they're capable of releasing smallpox and nuking.
[01:55:13.642 --> 01:55:18.364]  That's why they're so obsessed with this forced inoculation that they've set up the camps for.
[01:55:18.404 --> 01:55:19.285]  That's publicly admitted.
[01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:21.726]  What is it they want to inject us so badly with?
[01:55:23.543 --> 01:55:31.052]  Well, what you get when people are in a corner is that they will do anything to survive.
[01:55:31.633 --> 01:55:38.521]  And so, while this great wake-up is happening on the other side, all bets are off.
[01:55:38.681 --> 01:55:42.866]  I mean, there are no limitations to what they could do now because
[01:55:43.246 --> 01:55:50.090]  They're just going to throw everything at the situation to try to get this agenda of theirs to survive when it's starting to unravel.
[01:55:50.570 --> 01:56:04.618]  So anything could happen, and they're going to more and more be making it up as they go along and reacting to events, and that will mean more mistakes and more revelations of what's really going on.
[01:56:04.858 --> 01:56:09.581]  But fair enough, when you mentioned Adolf Hitler there, I've got a quote on the desk here which really sums up
[01:56:10.447 --> 01:56:10.747]  I think?
[01:56:27.702 --> 01:56:28.262]  I think so.
[01:56:46.425 --> 01:56:46.965]  I don't think so.
[01:57:10.461 --> 01:57:12.663]  Stay there David, we've got to start in the third hour.
[01:57:12.683 --> 01:57:15.905]  Let you finish that point, go to calls and replay those clips of the drills.
[01:57:15.925 --> 01:57:17.347]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:38.315]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.355 --> 01:57:38.675]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.451 --> 01:57:52.512]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.212 --> 01:57:54.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.973 --> 01:57:55.793]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.554 --> 01:57:57.434]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.454 --> 01:58:01.816]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.297 --> 01:58:06.439]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:16.124]  Alright, we got there, good-bye.
[01:58:16.957 --> 01:58:26.734]  Former champion goalie, soccer player, football over there, BBC reporter and commentator, president of the Green Party, best-selling author and lecturer.
[01:58:27.692 --> 01:58:30.133]  And, uh, really on the cutting edge of things.
[01:58:30.473 --> 01:58:31.594]  I know we got a load of phone lines.
[01:58:31.614 --> 01:58:33.375]  We're going to your calls here momentarily.
[01:58:33.655 --> 01:58:38.037]  I'm also going to recap the London bombings, the latest developments, and some other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:39.878]  Get David Icke's take on that.
[01:58:40.538 --> 01:58:43.240]  Uh, but, uh, David, yeah, Bin Laden is CIA.
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:48.142]  Al-Qaeda is this, was just a file name for all these mujahideen the CIA had.
[01:58:48.182 --> 01:58:49.743]  We know they run all these attacks.
[01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:56.490]  But you were making a point with one of your government officials, no longer servants, basically admitting all of this.
[01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:57.310]  Go ahead.
[01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:59.433]  Robbie Cook, he was the former foreign secretary.
[01:58:59.453 --> 01:59:05.138]  He resigned from the government in disgust over the invasion of Iraq, which he said was totally unjustifiable.
[01:59:05.999 --> 01:59:06.820]  We're good to go.
[01:59:24.833 --> 01:59:38.972]  So here we have a former Cabinet Minister in Britain in a major position as Foreign Secretary, very much involved in foreign policy and all the things that we're looking at, actually saying that Al Qaeda was a computer pilot of the CIA.
[01:59:39.052 --> 01:59:40.494]  And all that's happened is that...
[01:59:43.320 --> 02:00:08.408]  They have taken and expanded this computer file into a massive, imposed, implanted reality in the collective human mind, and have invented a devil, if you like, an evil force, which they can focus everyone against, and they want to get the people behind the authorities who are protecting them from this manufactured, invented evil force.
[02:00:08.648 --> 02:00:11.629]  It's nothing less than, like, worldwide wrestling, where
[02:00:12.827 --> 02:00:16.249]  The audience are told which one to boo and which one to cheer for.
[02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:19.950]  We've reached that level now of the propaganda.
[02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:22.091]  Well, David, I agree with you.
[02:00:22.211 --> 02:00:24.612]  And of course, Al-Qaeda, I believe, means the foundation.
[02:00:24.632 --> 02:00:28.493]  What a perfect name for the CIA file, the foundation or the base.
[02:00:28.933 --> 02:00:29.394]  Yeah.
[02:00:29.434 --> 02:00:34.095]  Because off Al-Qaeda, they're building a greater police state than they did with the Soviets.
[02:00:34.355 --> 02:00:35.296]  And it's now admitted.
[02:00:35.596 --> 02:00:40.778]  I'll never forget seeing the former CIA section chief about five years ago on the History Channel admitting
[02:00:41.298 --> 02:00:44.441]  And this old 80-something year old man going, oh yeah, we actually put Mao in.
[02:00:44.461 --> 02:00:46.623]  Oh yeah, we actually funded Ho Chi Minh.
[02:00:46.984 --> 02:00:49.706]  Oh yeah, we wanted Mao over the Nationalists.
[02:00:49.766 --> 02:00:54.331]  Oh yeah, we actually, our own government funded the Soviets to create that false threat.
[02:00:55.527 --> 02:01:00.192]  Yeah, there's that great quote from Abraham Lincoln, public sentiment is everything.
[02:01:00.212 --> 02:01:01.914]  With public sentiment, nothing can fail.
[02:01:01.974 --> 02:01:03.775]  Without it, nothing can succeed.
[02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:06.398]  He who molds opinion is greater than he who enacts the laws.
[02:01:07.139 --> 02:01:10.903]  And this whole thing is a massive mind game.
[02:01:11.723 --> 02:01:13.645]  As we've seen, we don't have to
[02:01:14.657 --> 02:01:16.078]  I mean, I go into this in the new book.
[02:01:16.158 --> 02:01:17.539]  They have shown that what we believe
[02:01:40.886 --> 02:01:44.910]  No matter how fantastical it will later, it may take time, we will manifest it.
[02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:57.383]  Yeah, every second, according to conventional science, we are receiving, our brains are receiving 4 billion pieces of information, but our conscious mind is aware of only about 2000 of them.
[02:01:58.804 --> 02:02:08.649]  Our subconscious is being bombarded all the time, and this then filters through to the conscious mind, at which point we think it's our own belief, our own thought, our own emotion.
[02:02:08.949 --> 02:02:09.610]  Let me stop you.
[02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:10.370]  We've got a break.
[02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:12.131]  We've got a break, David.
[02:02:12.151 --> 02:02:16.173]  We're going to come back and go right to your calls, folks, and recap the top stories and add some more key details.
[02:02:16.513 --> 02:02:18.154]  But I went and saw H.G.
[02:02:18.194 --> 02:02:21.856]  Wells' War of the Worlds, and Wells was a globalist.
[02:02:21.876 --> 02:02:27.499]  He wrote a book called The New World Order Nonfiction, and he said they're going to kill us and enslave us and build a world government.
[02:02:28.098 --> 02:02:36.207]  But, I'm going to tell you folks, and get David's take on this, I don't know if he's seen it yet, what the overriding propaganda in this alien flick was.
[02:02:36.808 --> 02:02:39.851]  So we'll give you an example of mass mind control and propaganda.
[02:02:39.871 --> 02:02:43.756]  When we get back, go to your calls, get more into London bombing and the latest developments.
[02:02:46.359 --> 02:02:49.222]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.935 --> 02:02:51.217]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:03:07.296 --> 02:03:11.077]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.337 --> 02:03:15.978]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.078 --> 02:03:18.819]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:19.139 --> 02:03:22.319]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much much more.
[02:03:22.379 --> 02:03:24.200]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:42.413 --> 02:03:44.495]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.643 --> 02:03:48.525]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:48.866 --> 02:03:51.748]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.968 --> 02:03:58.193]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:45.792 --> 02:04:52.674]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:53.194 --> 02:04:58.615]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:59.015 --> 02:05:09.037]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:09.177 --> 02:05:11.458]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:11.898 --> 02:05:14.960]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.601]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:16.721 --> 02:05:19.602]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:05:19.883 --> 02:05:24.205]  It's podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:24.465 --> 02:05:26.186]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:26.526 --> 02:05:38.213]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at Drunkstore.com.
[02:05:38.793 --> 02:05:39.974]  Non-X Nail Gel!
[02:05:40.234 --> 02:05:43.156]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:50.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:53.282]  Because there's a war on for your mind!
[02:05:55.163 --> 02:05:58.765]  Alright, now, 8 minutes, 12 seconds into this third hour.
[02:05:58.865 --> 02:06:01.686]  It is Monday, the 11th day of July, 2005.
[02:06:05.755 --> 02:06:07.336]  And we have loaded phone lines.
[02:06:07.376 --> 02:06:09.578]  We're going to be going to your calls here in just a moment.
[02:06:09.858 --> 02:06:11.959]  When you hear somebody hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[02:06:11.999 --> 02:06:18.504]  In the interest of time, I'm giving each caller about 60 seconds, and then David can respond to it.
[02:06:18.524 --> 02:06:19.764]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:19.784 --> 02:06:24.348]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:24.748 --> 02:06:34.034]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com broke massive stories this weekend that are some of the biggest on the internet right now, even being quoted and commented on by mainstream publications.
[02:06:34.074 --> 02:06:35.515]  So be sure and go to the site.
[02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.836]  We'll be getting more into the big development.
[02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:42.158]  We caught him doing drills at the exact same thing happening at the exact same locations.
[02:06:42.218 --> 02:06:42.958]  It's impossible.
[02:06:43.358 --> 02:06:45.179]  It's the cover story.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.661]  But I said I would get into an example of mass mind control.
[02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:51.162]  I meant to write an article about this, but I've just been too busy lately.
[02:06:51.182 --> 02:06:51.222]  H.G.
[02:06:53.163 --> 02:06:53.543]  Wells.
[02:06:53.583 --> 02:06:54.203]  We have his book.
[02:06:54.263 --> 02:06:55.123]  You can read it for free.
[02:06:55.163 --> 02:06:58.325]  It's an e-book on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:05.564]  He wrote a 1937 book called, The New World Order, and he was a futurist for the crown.
[02:07:06.465 --> 02:07:07.766]  A known Thabian Socialist.
[02:07:08.767 --> 02:07:10.308]  And hooked in with Cecil Rhodes.
[02:07:11.068 --> 02:07:15.932]  And he openly, and I have quotes from his book and my book, Descent into Tyranny, and I know David's talked about him.
[02:07:16.252 --> 02:07:19.595]  He openly says, we are the world government, we're gonna take control of you.
[02:07:20.623 --> 02:07:25.609]  We didn't grow society, kind of like the Morlocks did to Eloy in his other book, The Time Machine.
[02:07:25.649 --> 02:07:27.751]  But this was non-fiction, called The New World Order.
[02:07:27.771 --> 02:07:31.095]  And he said, there's all these gallant people that love humanity and freedom.
[02:07:31.115 --> 02:07:32.717]  We're going to have to kill them.
[02:07:34.799 --> 02:07:36.281]  So he wrote War of the Worlds.
[02:07:37.808 --> 02:07:41.149]  Which then with Orson Welles, and I heard them admit it.
[02:07:41.609 --> 02:07:46.931]  I own an old classic radio interview set of just hundreds of interviews that I bought.
[02:07:47.491 --> 02:07:52.213]  And it's got a KTSA, the Big San Antonio Station interview from like 1939.
[02:07:52.393 --> 02:07:55.574]  I mean, it's just really old.
[02:07:56.054 --> 02:07:56.615]  With H.G.
[02:07:56.675 --> 02:07:57.815]  Welles and Orson Welles.
[02:07:57.875 --> 02:08:00.816]  And they basically are admitting how this was a test.
[02:08:01.576 --> 02:08:06.458]  And so Orson Welles comes out and does his War of the Worlds and it causes mass panic.
[02:08:07.057 --> 02:08:09.238]  That was a test of mind control.
[02:08:09.698 --> 02:08:13.300]  A test, even with some fake alien threat, people thought it was real.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:25.245]  And now they have fake newscasts all over TV, like Oil Storm, and these shows on Nightline where they say terrorist have attacked, and then at the very end say this was just an exercise, but they use real video of real riots.
[02:08:25.625 --> 02:08:26.445]  They're bathing us.
[02:08:26.485 --> 02:08:35.409]  But I went and saw War of the Worlds, the new one, that the Spielberg put together, and the whole thing's 9-11.
[02:08:36.596 --> 02:08:37.517]  It's in New York.
[02:08:38.698 --> 02:08:42.002]  There's dust all over his face after the aliens are killing people.
[02:08:42.242 --> 02:08:44.645]  There's pictures of all the lost people on the walls.
[02:08:44.665 --> 02:08:47.949]  There's images of jets crashing and their engines.
[02:08:48.249 --> 02:08:54.095]  There's all this 9-11 imagery and then the military saves everybody at the end.
[02:08:54.956 --> 02:08:58.038]  And young men are fighting, wanting to join the military.
[02:08:58.299 --> 02:09:00.260]  It's so good to want to join the military.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.882]  You're compelled to join the military.
[02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:06.184]  And it plays off this rebellion of the child against the father.
[02:09:06.904 --> 02:09:08.926]  It's a recruiting movie for the war.
[02:09:08.946 --> 02:09:14.309]  And it superimposes the Arabs are the aliens.
[02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:16.391]  The Arabs are going to kill you.
[02:09:16.911 --> 02:09:19.473]  And just like Jerry Bruckheimer is coming out with a new 9-11 film.
[02:09:21.034 --> 02:09:23.736]  He produced the Private Lynch fable.
[02:09:24.309 --> 02:09:26.750]  He literally told the Pentagon how to shoot it and what to do.
[02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:28.291]  Folks, it's down to that.
[02:09:28.351 --> 02:09:31.032]  David Icke, you worked for the BBC.
[02:09:31.072 --> 02:09:32.352]  You're aware of how TV works.
[02:09:32.392 --> 02:09:33.593]  Can you elaborate on this?
[02:09:34.353 --> 02:09:37.794]  Well, I saw War of the Worlds and I read it the same.
[02:09:38.434 --> 02:09:46.257]  The thing is, as we saw with the Pearl Harbor movie coming out at an appropriate time, Hollywood speaks to us.
[02:09:46.277 --> 02:09:46.778]  Right before 9-11.
[02:09:46.958 --> 02:09:50.079]  Yeah, Hollywood speaks to us because Hollywood is controlled
[02:09:50.518 --> 02:09:53.800]  Overwhelmingly by the same force that we're talking about.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:54.321]  Why?
[02:09:54.681 --> 02:10:04.287]  Because, you know, I've been to over 40 countries researching this and what have you over the years, and what do you see as a common theme in countries of endless different languages and cultures?
[02:10:04.668 --> 02:10:06.409]  You see the Hollywood movies!
[02:10:06.989 --> 02:10:14.214]  It's a wonderful way of globally imposing a belief and a culture and a sense of reality on people.
[02:10:14.899 --> 02:10:25.604]  The thing about, I mean I've said earlier that I've ordered a new supply of sick bags and watching the BBC I think I may have to reorder again because it is totally sickening.
[02:10:25.644 --> 02:10:39.911]  The other night on a program called Newsnight that I actually worked on years ago, George Galloway was on and he was the one voice who was putting in the mainstream media an alternative view, not as alternative as ours, no, but an alternative view
[02:10:40.567 --> 02:10:41.208]  All right.
[02:10:57.493 --> 02:10:58.774]  Uh, you know, dignity.
[02:10:58.935 --> 02:11:02.438]  David, did you know that George Galloway a month ago was on this show?
[02:11:02.458 --> 02:11:04.359]  Yeah, I read that, yeah.
[02:11:04.559 --> 02:11:09.384]  He said, barring the government staging an attack, they won't be able to go into Iran.
[02:11:09.424 --> 02:11:10.685]  We got Galloway saying that!
[02:11:11.045 --> 02:11:11.405]  Exactly.
[02:11:11.445 --> 02:11:20.153]  Well, George Galloway, he's not got the whole picture, but he's got, for a politician, a hell of a great big chunk of the picture, because most politicians
[02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:23.074]  Or in the same prison as journalists.
[02:11:23.214 --> 02:11:35.858]  I mean, I've been watching this afternoon, Alex, on the British television, in the Houses of Parliament, Blair making a statement to the politicians and the two opposition party leaders making their reaction.
[02:11:36.198 --> 02:11:37.299]  It's just pathetic.
[02:11:37.379 --> 02:11:46.202]  It's like WWF wrestling, as you mentioned, but the example here is, within an hour or two of the bombings, they had images of Al-Qaeda training tanks
[02:11:46.642 --> 02:11:47.563]  We're good to go.
[02:12:05.948 --> 02:12:14.993]  Just to time how long it was before Al Qaeda got a mention after the announcement these were not an electrical surge, these were bombs.
[02:12:15.133 --> 02:12:16.994]  Let me guess, 45 seconds?
[02:12:17.114 --> 02:12:19.895]  It was a tiny time, it was a matter of a few minutes.
[02:12:20.956 --> 02:12:22.937]  And you have a situation where
[02:12:24.266 --> 02:12:34.633]  The media is as mind-controlled as the population, because what the media does, and has always done... The government puts out a press release and everybody parrots it.
[02:12:34.954 --> 02:12:39.757]  Yeah, it takes as its point of reality, the point at which it reports the world,
[02:12:40.157 --> 02:12:50.325]  Whatever the norm is in society, so a few centuries ago, the media would have ridiculed anyone that the earth was round, because the norm was that it was flat.
[02:12:50.846 --> 02:12:59.172]  Now the norm is, because it's been created, that Al-Qaeda is the problem, and it's as simple as that, like we've been talking about earlier.
[02:12:59.532 --> 02:13:09.220]  So every time one of these events happens, the mainstream media, although at the top of the pyramid it is controlled and the output dictated,
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:12.261]  Lower down these pyramids in the media.
[02:13:12.281 --> 02:13:14.002]  They're self-enforcing in their own boxes.
[02:13:14.282 --> 02:13:18.523]  They're self-enforcing, and what my friend of mine calls repeaters.
[02:13:18.583 --> 02:13:21.284]  They just repeat, repeat, repeat, and they call it news.
[02:13:21.845 --> 02:13:22.705]  What's happened?
[02:13:22.725 --> 02:13:30.448]  This is a significant point because I'm very interested in the media and the way it works, having been in the media for a long time, years ago.
[02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:42.994]  And what we first of all had, stage one, was the movement from substantial interviews and substantial news reports to what became known as soundbites.
[02:13:43.054 --> 02:13:48.837]  So you're bringing the level of debate down from substance to superficiality.
[02:13:49.197 --> 02:13:56.600]  Now what we've got, and this is what you have in America and this is what we've now got in Britain, is what passes for news
[02:13:57.446 --> 02:14:07.369]  He's now overwhelmingly the news reader interviewing a reporter on the ground and asking him what he thinks has happened.
[02:14:07.529 --> 02:14:08.589]  Now let me stop you right there.
[02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:10.650]  We go off government documents.
[02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:11.930]  We go off legislation.
[02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:17.692]  We go off declassified documents where your government, my government, constantly talks about how they want to carry out terror attacks.
[02:14:17.812 --> 02:14:19.513]  All the documents where they've been caught red-handed.
[02:14:19.813 --> 02:14:24.934]  Where these guys and their old men later admit terror attacks and then carry it out to blame it on Mozadek or whoever.
[02:14:25.355 --> 02:14:26.535]  Same story over and over again.
[02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.186]  But we get ridiculed.
[02:14:28.266 --> 02:14:29.968]  I get ridiculed for not having sex.
[02:14:30.088 --> 02:14:35.493]  Then, they get up there and, yeah, talk about their opinion for, you know, 20 hours out of 24.
[02:14:35.593 --> 02:14:46.042]  I know, because what you've got, you know, I've worked with these guys who are television reporters, and I tell you now, you don't need an intelligence test to get the job.
[02:14:46.442 --> 02:14:49.565]  And so what you have is the blind interviewing the blind.
[02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:50.406]  But let me add this.
[02:14:51.778 --> 02:15:01.965]  If you or I said, we went to a message board, and it says, good job Al Qaeda, and that's our proof that Al Qaeda did it, we'd be laughed out of the place.
[02:15:02.085 --> 02:15:05.568]  But the government does it, and oh my gosh, this is very credible!
[02:15:05.888 --> 02:15:06.989]  I know, because the government does it.
[02:15:07.009 --> 02:15:13.193]  I mean, I sat in my front room watching a BBC bulletin after 9-11, and I watched the newsreader, without laughing,
[02:15:13.713 --> 02:15:19.017]  Tell me that they found a paper passport from one of the hijackers near Ground Zero.
[02:15:19.337 --> 02:15:23.119]  That's the level of ludicrous news reporting we have.
[02:15:23.379 --> 02:15:26.621]  And of course, it's the same with education, as it is with the media.
[02:15:27.002 --> 02:15:38.829]  You do not want a vibrant, educated population, because that's more difficult to control, so you suppress the level of education, and you certainly don't want an informed population.
[02:15:38.869 --> 02:15:39.130]  No, you don't.
[02:15:39.150 --> 02:15:39.850]  David, we've got to go to the polls.
[02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:41.611]  That's the level that the media operates at.
[02:15:41.871 --> 02:15:42.872]  It's real simple.
[02:15:43.152 --> 02:15:44.813]  I totally agree with you, DavidIke.com.
[02:15:44.973 --> 02:15:45.713]  Let's take a call.
[02:15:46.073 --> 02:15:47.854]  Elias in Michigan, holding for an hour.
[02:15:47.874 --> 02:15:48.575]  Go ahead, Elias.
[02:15:48.635 --> 02:15:49.955]  I've been sitting here a long time.
[02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:51.656]  How are you, Al?
[02:15:51.756 --> 02:15:52.256]  I'm fine, sir.
[02:15:52.276 --> 02:15:53.317]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:15:53.337 --> 02:15:58.179]  Yeah, well, I was listening to your thing about the implants in your body.
[02:15:59.019 --> 02:15:59.960]  You're both wrong.
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:02.941]  They're only there for one purpose and one purpose only.
[02:16:02.981 --> 02:16:05.042]  When the time comes, they'll kill you with it.
[02:16:06.193 --> 02:16:11.177]  They're not interested in reading your mind, or putting thoughts in your brain.
[02:16:11.357 --> 02:16:12.938]  They're interested in killing people.
[02:16:12.978 --> 02:16:14.899]  So the Pentagon's own document says that.
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:18.342]  Yeah, if I could just say something here.
[02:16:18.542 --> 02:16:25.306]  We've got to be very, very careful that we don't look at something and say, this is the reason for it.
[02:16:25.667 --> 02:16:28.348]  I've yet come across anything where there's one reason for it.
[02:16:28.368 --> 02:16:29.069]  It's always multifaceted.
[02:16:29.309 --> 02:16:32.490]  The only reason is to kill people with it!
[02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:33.630]  That's the only reason!
[02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:44.133]  Yes, the scientist I was talking about from the CIA in 1997 told me that they were there to take people out, but that's not the only reason.
[02:16:44.233 --> 02:16:46.134]  It's more subtle and complex than that.
[02:16:46.274 --> 02:16:48.235]  Yeah, you seem angry, Elias.
[02:16:48.315 --> 02:16:49.035]  Are you mad at us?
[02:16:49.395 --> 02:16:50.576]  Well, I'm not angry with you.
[02:16:50.596 --> 02:16:58.379]  I see the ultimate reason, and you're talking about changing their thoughts or whatever, what have you.
[02:16:58.639 --> 02:16:59.660]  Well, this is ridiculous.
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:00.240]  Why bother?
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:03.782]  There's only one reason, and don't forget, you won't blow up or anything.
[02:17:03.802 --> 02:17:08.024]  You'll just die of some unknown cause, and you'll dwindle away and die.
[02:17:08.404 --> 02:17:11.005]  Elias, just a quick question.
[02:17:11.824 --> 02:17:21.788]  If this tiny network, compared with the global population that is in awareness of this, if they simply microchip everybody and then kill them,
[02:17:22.330 --> 02:17:26.314]  Who's going to run the show like they want to be rid of?
[02:17:26.354 --> 02:17:27.716]  Listen, thank you for the call.
[02:17:27.996 --> 02:17:28.877]  Thank you for the call, Elias.
[02:17:29.037 --> 02:17:30.398]  I appreciate it.
[02:17:30.458 --> 02:17:32.981]  It's multi-faceted reasons for the chips.
[02:17:33.081 --> 02:17:36.364]  Buying and selling, tracking grids, everything.
[02:17:36.404 --> 02:17:40.669]  And yes, with more advanced medical chips, they're admitting that they could do things medically with them.
[02:17:40.689 --> 02:17:41.509]  That's all we're saying.
[02:17:41.529 --> 02:17:43.011]  We'll be right back with David Iken, your host.
[02:17:45.891 --> 02:17:49.512]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:17:49.813 --> 02:17:53.334]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:17:53.634 --> 02:18:02.477]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[02:18:02.817 --> 02:18:06.779]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.

[02:18:11.921 --> 02:18:12.921]  This detailed report
[02:18:12.981 --> 02:18:13.742]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.794 --> 02:18:49.277]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:49.537 --> 02:18:53.040]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:57.083]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:57.303 --> 02:19:03.468]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:11.794]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:19:12.194 --> 02:19:17.537]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:17.697 --> 02:19:21.459]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:21.819 --> 02:19:23.680]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:25.922]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:19:26.162 --> 02:19:31.084]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:19:31.144 --> 02:19:35.247]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-622-9000.
[02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.789]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:39.471]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:19:45.198 --> 02:19:47.619]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.359 --> 02:19:52.000]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:56.501]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[02:19:57.202 --> 02:20:05.784]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[02:20:06.761 --> 02:20:13.945]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[02:20:14.886 --> 02:20:22.951]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.111 --> 02:20:26.593]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:27.494 --> 02:20:27.874]  Call now.
[02:20:27.895 --> 02:20:31.478]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.902 --> 02:20:50.766]  You now know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, it's no longer a matter of if, but when.
[02:20:51.026 --> 02:20:54.529]  What you need to know next is when it happens, is your family safe right where you are?
[02:20:54.789 --> 02:20:59.413]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on, can give you that instant assurance.
[02:20:59.673 --> 02:21:04.557]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:21:04.857 --> 02:21:12.183]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.

[02:21:20.348 --> 02:21:28.292]  The patented NukeAlert has even passed the rigorous military EMP tests and been acquired by the U.S.
[02:21:28.312 --> 02:21:30.293]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:21:30.533 --> 02:21:34.556]  Discover your family's primary nuclear defense today at nukealert.com.
[02:21:34.716 --> 02:21:38.358]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com or call 830-672-8734.
[02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:58.575]  When the levee breaks, the globalists and their minions will have no place to stay.
[02:21:58.675 --> 02:21:59.796]  Bringing it down.
[02:21:59.816 --> 02:22:01.617]  It's going down now.
[02:22:02.758 --> 02:22:04.119]  The fraud's coming down.
[02:22:04.139 --> 02:22:05.060]  We're pulling it down.
[02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:11.785]  It's like there's millions of us with little needles, jabbing holes in this big black curtain that's keeping out the sunlight.
[02:22:12.226 --> 02:22:15.808]  More and more light's coming through and they're trying to patch it and trying to cover it up.
[02:22:16.529 --> 02:22:17.690]  It's not working anymore.
[02:22:18.684 --> 02:22:20.588]  And we're going deep down the rabbit hole today.
[02:22:20.668 --> 02:22:24.234]  Listen, I don't want to belabor Elias' call from Michigan.
[02:22:25.496 --> 02:22:26.418]  He sounded angry.
[02:22:27.384 --> 02:22:29.185]  Because we were saying there's all these uses.
[02:22:29.225 --> 02:22:30.326]  The globalists need us.
[02:22:30.366 --> 02:22:31.527]  They enjoy controlling us.
[02:22:31.547 --> 02:22:36.711]  They do want to get rid of four-fifths of us, according to many other public documents.
[02:22:36.751 --> 02:22:38.872]  Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau.
[02:22:39.153 --> 02:22:40.193]  Many others are on record.
[02:22:40.213 --> 02:22:42.675]  The UN Population Fund.
[02:22:43.236 --> 02:22:43.956]  That's admitted.
[02:22:43.996 --> 02:22:46.058]  But they do want a large group of us to be their minions.
[02:22:46.078 --> 02:22:49.060]  They do want the power over us to kill us if they want to.
[02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:58.229]  And that's why they've got plans publicly now declassified with helicopters ready with knockout gas and other gases in every major region of the country and the world.
[02:22:58.609 --> 02:23:02.113]  I mean, yes, they are ready, but they don't have enough evil people to carry all this out yet.
[02:23:02.413 --> 02:23:10.821]  That's why by 2010, four and a half years away, half the Air Force will be drone fighter, drone bomber, and half the ground forces by 2014 will be ground combat mechs.
[02:23:13.283 --> 02:23:14.444]  Folks, that's mainstream news.
[02:23:14.464 --> 02:23:15.666]  That's MIT Magazine.
[02:23:15.706 --> 02:23:17.027]  That's Pentagon announcements.
[02:23:17.047 --> 02:23:23.273]  So they're going over to this mechanized, centralized control grid because they know they're losing control of the mass of us.
[02:23:23.313 --> 02:23:27.577]  And if they have to, it will be the elites literally controlling their own mechanized systems.
[02:23:27.877 --> 02:23:29.038]  And this is their own announcements.
[02:23:29.058 --> 02:23:32.382]  I mean, this was in a MIT Magazine I was reading on air two weeks ago.
[02:23:33.022 --> 02:23:40.225]  So this is the shift, but folks, everything they do is a cost-benefit analysis, and they look at it, and they decide, does this help us or does it hurt us?
[02:23:40.525 --> 02:23:42.186]  What does it do to subsidiary plans?
[02:23:42.466 --> 02:23:43.586]  So it's never one thing.
[02:23:43.666 --> 02:23:48.688]  First and foremost, it's for tracking and tracing and taxation, in my opinion, of the microchips.
[02:23:48.968 --> 02:23:51.990]  And again, we were kooked to talk about microchips ten years ago, and now it's all over the news.
[02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:53.710]  Take your chip, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:54.871]  I mean, Andy Rooney said that.
[02:23:55.871 --> 02:23:58.112]  Let's go to Kevin in New Jersey.
[02:23:58.172 --> 02:24:00.173]  Kevin, you're on the air with David Icke.
[02:24:00.193 --> 02:24:00.733]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:24:01.365 --> 02:24:03.206]  Mr. David Icke and Alex Jones, how are you today?
[02:24:03.226 --> 02:24:03.606]  Good, good.
[02:24:03.646 --> 02:24:04.246]  How are you, Kevin?
[02:24:04.346 --> 02:24:05.786]  Good, thank you.
[02:24:05.806 --> 02:24:08.227]  Mr. Icke, thank you very much for both of your books.
[02:24:08.687 --> 02:24:15.509]  I know you've written several, but I've read Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Disaster, and also I Am Me, I Am Free, listening.
[02:24:15.529 --> 02:24:17.570]  If you have not read it, get the book.
[02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:20.271]  Very insightful with many, many resources.
[02:24:20.711 --> 02:24:24.072]  My question for the both of you, actually, is that I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:31.875]  The Illuminati want to create the ultimate fear in us in order to install the Barrett chip made by Applied Digital Solutions or another company.
[02:24:32.275 --> 02:24:34.476]  Fear which I believe is false evidence appearing real.
[02:24:34.938 --> 02:24:38.320]  I believe they're going to use a nuclear bomb on this and blame it on Iran.
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:45.984]  And if you want to put this together with their crazy numerology, I believe it will come up in less than 11 months from now.
[02:24:46.004 --> 02:24:46.984]  And I'm talking about June 6, 2006.
[02:24:47.164 --> 02:24:54.628]  Now everybody's saying 666, and for those who don't know, David talked about this earlier, the movies telling us what they're going to do.
[02:24:55.109 --> 02:24:59.131]  I have the star of The Lone Gunman, the X-Files sequel, on this show.
[02:24:59.751 --> 02:25:00.672]  He came to my house.
[02:25:00.712 --> 02:25:01.872]  He was so freaked out by this.
[02:25:02.292 --> 02:25:06.234]  The CIA approached them, planted this story into the script.
[02:25:06.294 --> 02:25:08.115]  They talk about it now in the new box set.
[02:25:08.696 --> 02:25:09.736]  They came to them.
[02:25:10.216 --> 02:25:11.137]  They said this.
[02:25:11.217 --> 02:25:23.163]  They did a script where a secret government group covers a terrorist attack with a war drill and the real action is flying a jumbo jet into the World Trade Center as a pretext to have World War III and invade the Middle East.
[02:25:24.193 --> 02:25:27.015]  Then the people who were in the movie tell me this.
[02:25:27.635 --> 02:25:29.436]  They say it on this radio show.
[02:25:29.616 --> 02:25:31.597]  I mean, David, this can't get any more obvious.
[02:25:32.337 --> 02:25:34.999]  Yeah, and you know, the numerology thing is interesting.
[02:25:35.219 --> 02:25:47.465]  I know you can get really extreme with it, but very clearly in my research over the years, these guys that are behind the scenes, indeed some of them in front of the camera, but the real power behind the scenes
[02:25:48.065 --> 02:25:55.449]  He understands a lot of deep, deep esoteric knowledge and how mathematics comes into all this and what have you.
[02:25:55.789 --> 02:25:59.591]  They have key numbers and among them are 9 and 11.
[02:25:59.932 --> 02:26:01.112]  We had 9-11.
[02:26:01.292 --> 02:26:02.913]  And double 7s.
[02:26:02.933 --> 02:26:06.075]  Yeah, treble 7 is what we had with the London bombings.
[02:26:06.635 --> 02:26:09.717]  Because 2005 numerologically comes down to a 7.
[02:26:09.777 --> 02:26:10.497]  So you had 7-7-7.
[02:26:12.998 --> 02:26:17.220]  There's something very, very important also about 2012.
[02:26:18.861 --> 02:26:27.104]  One of the things that has been lost in the sequence of events in London was the Olympic Games being given to London in 2012, the day before the bombings.
[02:26:29.029 --> 02:26:35.932]  London, of course, the great heart center at an operational level in so many ways of this global conspiracy.
[02:26:35.952 --> 02:26:38.633]  The global system has like three hearts, but London's the big one.
[02:26:38.853 --> 02:26:46.656]  Exactly, and when they first announced that London was going for the Olympics in 2012, I was saying to my friends, it's a certainty.
[02:26:47.057 --> 02:26:51.738]  You know, London, Olympics, 2012, absolutely certainty.
[02:26:51.979 --> 02:26:57.621]  And of course, they said, oh, it was a close vote with Paris, it was a certainty all along, and was part of this sequence
[02:26:58.041 --> 02:26:58.702]  We're good.
[02:27:17.464 --> 02:27:23.588]  The World War II and the whole of the newspapers today is ablaze with the Blitz spirit.
[02:27:23.688 --> 02:27:26.550]  We will not give up just like they didn't with the Blitz in London.
[02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:31.273]  But no one even knows who launched the attack, no one's taking credit, and all the cameras malfunctioned.
[02:27:31.533 --> 02:27:33.395]  We'll be right back with David Eigenmore, your co-host.
[02:27:36.036 --> 02:27:39.038]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[02:30:38.010 --> 02:30:38.750]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:30:46.131 --> 02:30:54.875]  More of your calls coming up.
[02:30:54.916 --> 02:30:58.297]  We'll tell you about some of David Icke's great publications and videos.
[02:30:58.317 --> 02:30:58.978]  DavidIcke.com.
[02:30:58.998 --> 02:31:03.080]  Before I go any further though, I want to play a few of these clips and get David's take on them.
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:05.261]  OnPrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:07.421 --> 02:31:11.265]  And InfoWars.com, you cannot overlook our top stories.
[02:31:11.365 --> 02:31:15.489]  Bomb scares suggest Blair knew and did nothing in Sheffield a day and a half before the bombings.
[02:31:15.529 --> 02:31:21.695]  Now we've confirmed that the Israeli Prime Minister did get a warning before, and that Israel had warned two days before.
[02:31:21.715 --> 02:31:30.084]  That is admitted mainstream news, but in the back of the paper, and the story we broke, London underground bombing exercises took place at the same time as the real attack.
[02:31:30.644 --> 02:31:31.424]  What did we break?
[02:31:31.664 --> 02:31:49.108]  That the head of this group, Visor Consultants, made up of all these intelligence people, with the British government, we're now confirming, we have confirmed, that that's who they were doing this with, and some other private companies, of running simultaneous drills of the exact same places being bombed, at the exact same time.
[02:31:49.148 --> 02:31:55.209]  Again, that uses a cover for the echelon system picking up the chatter for this, because the government isn't full of bad people, you've got to fool them too.
[02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:57.551]  Or the decoy op.
[02:31:58.052 --> 02:32:01.515]  And if any other people get caught, then they can say, oh no, I was just part of the drill.
[02:32:02.076 --> 02:32:03.637]  Drills were run on 9-11.
[02:32:03.677 --> 02:32:05.779]  Drills were run at the First World Trade Center attack.
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:07.721]  Drills were run in Oklahoma City.
[02:32:09.143 --> 02:32:12.306]  This, the mathematics in this is impossible.
[02:32:12.466 --> 02:32:17.431]  And it is so important you get this article off prisonplanet.com and get it out to everybody.
[02:32:18.388 --> 02:32:21.109]  Because this totally disproves their official story.
[02:32:21.449 --> 02:32:23.650]  And the article's also full of examples of the government doing it.
[02:32:23.930 --> 02:32:33.753]  Here's a little 60-second BBC clip where Peter Powers, former Scotland Yard official, head of visor consultants, is saying the hair on the back of his neck was standing up.
[02:32:34.034 --> 02:32:37.135]  We have the full clip there if you want to hear the five minutes of it on the website.
[02:32:37.735 --> 02:32:41.736]  Because they were having drills at the exact same place at the exact same time as it was happening.
[02:32:42.116 --> 02:32:46.558]  And then they shifted out of the drill beginning right when it happened to real life.
[02:32:48.177 --> 02:32:52.205]  Or is this a cover for the PR people out of the gates?
[02:32:52.265 --> 02:32:52.886]  Do they know?
[02:32:53.026 --> 02:32:53.748]  I don't think so.
[02:32:54.089 --> 02:32:55.531]  Or he wouldn't have been blabbering about it.
[02:32:55.812 --> 02:32:56.573]  Here it is, folks.
[02:32:58.258 --> 02:33:03.201]  The thing that concerns me is that what are we doing for the thousands of men and women actually who are in London working?
[02:33:03.221 --> 02:33:14.486]  And I say that because at half past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for over a company of a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations that happened this morning.
[02:33:14.886 --> 02:33:17.228]  So I still have the hairs on the back of my legs turning upright.
[02:33:17.428 --> 02:33:23.751]  To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were running the exercise?
[02:33:24.051 --> 02:33:24.551]  Precisely.
[02:33:24.752 --> 02:33:26.653]  And it was about half past nine this morning.
[02:33:26.693 --> 02:33:30.255]  We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons I don't want to reveal their name, but if they're listening they'll know it.
[02:33:30.756 --> 02:33:33.317]  And we had a room full of crisis managers for the first time in NET.
[02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:36.019]  And so within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision.
[02:33:36.039 --> 02:33:36.780]  This is the real one.
[02:33:37.821 --> 02:33:44.865]  And so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on.
[02:33:46.195 --> 02:33:47.736]  Alright, several points on this clip.
[02:33:47.756 --> 02:33:49.218]  Then we have the ITN video clip.
[02:33:49.238 --> 02:33:49.738]  It's longer.
[02:33:49.778 --> 02:33:51.200]  We may play that if we have time.
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:53.602]  But I want to get David Icke's take on this solicitor's response.
[02:33:54.242 --> 02:33:54.883]  Several things.
[02:33:54.943 --> 02:33:57.185]  Number one, they said simultaneous bombings.
[02:33:57.605 --> 02:34:05.132]  That wasn't released and made public until Saturday afternoon by the BBC and the London Telegraph.
[02:34:05.372 --> 02:34:09.256]  Now, at the same time that we have that going on,
[02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:18.755]  We have to understand that if they knew instantly, and he said a well-known company, if you're listening and know who I'm talking about, well, they're doing drills in London Underground.
[02:34:18.815 --> 02:34:19.756]  It's London Underground, folks.
[02:34:19.776 --> 02:34:20.616]  That's who would let them do this.
[02:34:20.896 --> 02:34:21.957]  That's basically the British government.
[02:34:23.978 --> 02:34:32.623]  Now understand, for an hour and a half, the government was saying that it was a little electrical surge, but here they are with their own consultancy firm, saying that they knew what it was within minutes.
[02:34:32.983 --> 02:34:33.944]  They would like your comments.
[02:34:35.077 --> 02:34:36.979]  Well, I mean, it's the coincidence level.
[02:34:37.179 --> 02:34:45.606]  I'd love to run that statistic through a big computer and find out the chances of that happening coincidentally.
[02:34:45.666 --> 02:34:46.987]  I mean, it's just ludicrous.
[02:34:47.287 --> 02:34:53.232]  Having a drill just of bombing at the very same time is bad enough, but the exact same places and it being instant bombings?
[02:34:53.692 --> 02:34:54.112]  Exactly.
[02:34:54.132 --> 02:34:56.174]  That's got to be like one out of a gazillion.
[02:34:56.454 --> 02:35:04.040]  And then you've got to put through the same computer the chances of that happening and something very similar happening in 9-11, in Oklahoma, etc., etc.
[02:35:05.041 --> 02:35:09.385]  I mean, it's becoming such a clear, open book.
[02:35:09.725 --> 02:35:12.287]  And the only thing... Why are they so obvious, David?
[02:35:13.228 --> 02:35:16.971]  Well, I think to a large extent, they're losing the plot.
[02:35:17.071 --> 02:35:17.692]  I really do.
[02:35:18.352 --> 02:35:20.714]  And when people lose the plot, they make mistakes.
[02:35:21.034 --> 02:35:22.936]  And things become more and more transparent.
[02:35:22.956 --> 02:35:23.376]  Let me ask you this.
[02:35:23.396 --> 02:35:26.279]  Do you think like a diver who gets down under 200 feet gets...
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:43.764]  The narcosis where they get, you literally get high and then want to stay down there because of the oxygen deprivation and literally they've got the same type of sickness up in their ivory towers that these evil devils just are on such power trips they don't know what they're doing?
[02:35:44.304 --> 02:35:56.307]  Well, the thing is that, you know, I've been talking about something for the best part of 15 years which I came across and, you know, many people are not, see the world the way I see it, will, you know, maybe not go there but
[02:35:56.867 --> 02:36:11.351]  I learned about 15 years ago that there is an awakening going on and it's to do on one level with an energy cycle which the Mayan calendar and other ancient peoples actually documented.
[02:36:11.631 --> 02:36:16.953]  And 2012 is a big date in that the end of one cycle and the start of another.
[02:36:17.313 --> 02:36:18.293]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:36:18.413 --> 02:36:32.318]  We know that, whether this is real or not, the globalists up in the Bohemian Grove, they are into Satanism, they do believe this, so regardless, they really believe this, and so they're rushing pell-mell, uh, Katie Barr the door, to shut up their police state before them.
[02:36:32.558 --> 02:36:33.338]  Precisely.
[02:36:33.558 --> 02:36:37.940]  They, whether people accept it or not, they accept it, and that's what matters.
[02:36:39.882 --> 02:36:41.243]  Well, here's something basic.
[02:36:41.283 --> 02:36:42.664]  The cover of Time Magazine, 1984.
[02:36:42.704 --> 02:36:50.412]  Every decision to the second that Ronald Reagan gave a speech to what he said was made by the White House astrologer.
[02:36:51.042 --> 02:37:09.404]  Yeah, what they are working on, and indeed we've been talking about this tonight Alex, is that this energy cycle is affecting people in the sense that they are waking up and starting to break out of the only level that they've been operating on, which is the five senses.
[02:37:10.004 --> 02:37:15.828]  What they're doing, and they know the timescale, is rushing to try to put the lid on the door.
[02:37:15.928 --> 02:37:19.890]  That's the real reason for the microchip, and all the stuff we've been talking about.
[02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:32.078]  Let's go back to the... But, as that date gets closer, and this time gets closer, and the 9-11 effect, I'm absolutely sure, has not been as, not just as massive, but as long-lasting as they thought.
[02:37:32.518 --> 02:37:38.445]  They're now in a mad panic of how they're going to get the lid on before it's impossible to put the lid on.
[02:37:38.465 --> 02:37:40.687]  It's also like a heroin addict.
[02:37:40.707 --> 02:37:41.628]  9-11 was huge.
[02:37:41.708 --> 02:37:43.150]  It takes more and more to scare us.
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:45.021]  I don't think this is going to do it for them.
[02:37:45.041 --> 02:37:47.263]  I think we're going to see bigger events very soon, unfortunately.
[02:37:48.143 --> 02:37:48.884]  I agree.
[02:37:48.964 --> 02:37:54.608]  I think 2006 is going to be a big year when they throw a lot of things at the human mind and human emotions, definitely.
[02:37:54.628 --> 02:37:57.030]  Well, we've got to gird ourselves for that and ask God for guidance.
[02:37:57.570 --> 02:37:58.891]  I've got to go quickly now through calls.
[02:37:58.931 --> 02:38:00.812]  Callers, it's real fast, your question, your comment.
[02:38:01.613 --> 02:38:04.955]  Let's talk to up next here, Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:38:04.995 --> 02:38:05.756]  Wesley, go ahead.
[02:38:06.877 --> 02:38:07.657]  Hi, gentlemen.
[02:38:07.898 --> 02:38:08.838]  Hi, Wesley.
[02:38:09.198 --> 02:38:10.359]  I've got a question for you.
[02:38:12.524 --> 02:38:27.544]  I'm not advocating the use of illegal drugs, but I had heard a college professor about 15, perhaps 20 years ago, when I was completing my graduate work, suggest that marijuana may infect
[02:38:28.522 --> 02:38:36.864]  Produce the desired result of... Well, it's actually in the same class as hallucinogens, and there has been some discussion of why the government wants to stop it.
[02:38:37.064 --> 02:38:37.844]  I don't like marijuana.
[02:38:37.884 --> 02:38:38.725]  I'm not saying use it.
[02:38:39.045 --> 02:38:39.805]  No, I'm not either.
[02:38:41.905 --> 02:38:51.248]  My second point would be, I certainly hope Americans don't develop the same amnesia that seemed to befall the Brits when
[02:38:54.380 --> 02:39:03.579]  They seem to forget that the Russians have been using tanks, helicopters, and all kinds of heavy weapons against the Chechens.
[02:39:05.996 --> 02:39:16.381]  The Chechens still haven't caved in under the pressure, and I wish the Brits hadn't surrendered their guns, and I certainly hope we don't make that same mistake here in this country.
[02:39:16.401 --> 02:39:17.381]  Leslie, thanks for the call.
[02:39:17.401 --> 02:39:17.681]  David?
[02:39:18.242 --> 02:39:29.146]  Well, in terms of hallucinogenic drugs and such like, what they do is they take you to other parts of the DNA, and that becomes your reality at the time.
[02:39:29.166 --> 02:39:32.368]  It actually moves the focus of your reality to these other levels of us.
[02:39:32.828 --> 02:39:38.679]  Now, I've taken them twice because I wanted to see what would happen.
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:44.931]  And I had a fantastic experience in which I learned an enormous amount about the nature of reality.
[02:39:45.988 --> 02:39:49.371]  People can have horrendous experiences on them as well.
[02:39:49.391 --> 02:39:50.833]  It's very, very dangerous.
[02:39:51.133 --> 02:39:52.654]  They need to be used with care.
[02:39:52.714 --> 02:40:00.241]  But with care, they can show you very clearly that this reality that we think is the only one is certainly not the only one.
[02:40:00.301 --> 02:40:03.604]  In fact, it's a tiny fraction of the realities that exist.
[02:40:03.664 --> 02:40:05.706]  Well, David, I'm going to advise people.
[02:40:05.746 --> 02:40:07.388]  These things are very dangerous.
[02:40:09.212 --> 02:40:12.480]  In the wrong hands, used in the wrong way, they can be.
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.212]  Well we know in Vietnam they would spray our troops with whole units and watch the units kill each other.
[02:40:17.754 --> 02:40:21.317]  We know they used it in one of the wars against the Egyptians.
[02:40:21.458 --> 02:40:30.706]  Yeah, all this is possible, but other people get tremendous rushes of love from it as well.
[02:40:31.327 --> 02:40:39.074]  Again, it's not black and white, it's shades of grey, but they'd be very, very used with enormous care, and I certainly won't use them again.
[02:40:39.335 --> 02:40:41.737]  I'd just dilute them a couple of times because I want to see what it would do.
[02:40:42.418 --> 02:40:47.104]  The idea is to go to these other levels of ourselves without drugs.
[02:40:47.144 --> 02:40:48.686]  That's the key.
[02:40:48.726 --> 02:40:50.128]  Yeah, I don't need drugs.
[02:40:50.628 --> 02:40:51.950]  You took peyote, didn't you?
[02:40:52.250 --> 02:40:58.318]  No, I took something called ayahuasca, which is a plant in the rainforest of South America.
[02:40:59.199 --> 02:41:00.040]  Yeah, I heard that.
[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:00.601]  We're good to go.
[02:41:00.621 --> 02:41:00.801]  Welcome.
[02:41:15.038 --> 02:41:22.484]  For those that don't know, Prozac's molecular structure is very similar to LSD-25, but it just puts you in the dream state.
[02:41:22.764 --> 02:41:30.990]  So we have 15 million adults on, it is in the, folks, in the medical books, it is in the hallucinogenic class, and so why...
[02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:36.675]  There's a major difference though between these synthetic drugs they're pushing and these other drugs they're demonizing.
[02:41:36.936 --> 02:41:38.137]  We've got to ask ourselves why.
[02:41:38.177 --> 02:41:43.362]  But then you've also got to understand, David, that the owners of Time Life Books were big into LSD in the 50s.
[02:41:43.663 --> 02:41:46.025]  It was the CIA that introduced it on the campuses.
[02:41:46.085 --> 02:41:46.706]  Why would they do that?
[02:41:47.086 --> 02:41:48.247]  Sure.
[02:41:48.267 --> 02:41:51.931]  Because something can be used for good or it can be used for ill.
[02:41:51.971 --> 02:41:54.274]  It's not what it is, it's how it's used.
[02:41:54.874 --> 02:41:56.776]  I'm going to tell people that right now.
[02:42:17.779 --> 02:42:17.979]  Yeah.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:39.582]  All right, it's very dangerous.
[02:42:39.602 --> 02:42:40.903]  I'm not going to disagree with you though, David.
[02:42:41.524 --> 02:42:45.027]  Let's go ahead and... Not that I have ever done anything.
[02:42:46.488 --> 02:42:49.790]  Well, apparently, Alex, George Bush has never taken drugs.
[02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:50.811]  That's funny, isn't it?
[02:42:50.931 --> 02:42:52.072]  Well, it's good that he does.
[02:42:52.092 --> 02:42:52.692]  I read it somewhere.
[02:42:55.044 --> 02:43:01.530]  You know, listen, I don't use anything now but an occasional cigar, or I can't control myself a cigarette and coffee, and I think coffee's pretty bad.
[02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.231]  Yeah, absolutely, it's terrible.
[02:43:03.251 --> 02:43:05.494]  Yeah, it's really bad, so actually I do use drugs.
[02:43:05.694 --> 02:43:10.218]  But I don't use any of those, and uh... Yeah, mine comes in a big shade of red.
[02:43:10.558 --> 02:43:12.720]  Maybe back in high school I saw some pink elephants.
[02:43:13.201 --> 02:43:14.582]  I've got to go real fast here.
[02:43:14.963 --> 02:43:16.024]  Donna in New York.
[02:43:16.084 --> 02:43:17.385]  Donna, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:43:17.805 --> 02:43:20.527]  Hi Alex, I had to laugh at those last statements.
[02:43:20.567 --> 02:43:21.608]  That's pretty funny.
[02:43:22.869 --> 02:43:26.172]  I hold on this long just to tell you thank you for all you have done.
[02:43:26.192 --> 02:43:28.694]  I eat you, drink you, and sleep you.
[02:43:28.774 --> 02:43:32.396]  And I put you on the web, on blogs all the time.
[02:43:32.957 --> 02:43:35.178]  And I appreciate what you're doing for us.
[02:43:35.999 --> 02:43:44.946]  And the second thing I want to say is that Mr. Ike that you had on the phone, he said Tony Blair was emotionless.
[02:43:45.362 --> 02:43:47.784]  If you look at his eyes, his eyes are smiling.
[02:43:49.625 --> 02:43:52.767]  That's actually a very good point, Donna, and it's one I've made before.
[02:43:53.587 --> 02:43:57.529]  These particular Illuminati... Well, right before Bush gave his speech, he was laughing!
[02:43:57.730 --> 02:43:59.150]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:59.431 --> 02:44:00.731]  And his eyebrows go up.
[02:44:01.492 --> 02:44:07.235]  When he has to fight, you know, that's why he does that little thing where he pinches his lips together is to stop that smirking.
[02:44:07.596 --> 02:44:09.797]  And you can tell, you can just tell when he's blind.
[02:44:10.566 --> 02:44:14.811]  Listen, when he used to come out and talk about executions that were going to happen in Texas, he would smile.
[02:44:14.851 --> 02:44:17.134]  And one time he went, she said, please don't kill me.
[02:44:18.115 --> 02:44:19.837]  Yeah, how about when he went under the chair?
[02:44:20.138 --> 02:44:22.040]  No weapons of mass destruction here.
[02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:23.202]  No weapons of mass destruction.
[02:44:23.222 --> 02:44:24.143]  Like it was a joke.
[02:44:26.068 --> 02:44:26.408]  I hear you.
[02:44:26.428 --> 02:44:26.988]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:27.008 --> 02:44:29.189]  David, you were going to say something?
[02:44:29.609 --> 02:44:29.929]  I was, yeah.
[02:44:29.969 --> 02:44:32.950]  Well, you know when Bush is lying, it's very clear his lips are moving.
[02:44:33.810 --> 02:44:34.471]  Same with Blair.
[02:44:35.171 --> 02:44:37.251]  But it's one of the points I've made years ago.
[02:44:37.271 --> 02:44:49.035]  These Illuminati bloodlines, you can tell them by the fact that what their mouth is doing and what their face is doing, say it's smiling and all the rest of it,
[02:44:50.076 --> 02:44:52.699]  What their eyes are doing is very different.
[02:44:52.739 --> 02:44:56.483]  Their eyes and their mouth and face speak a different language.
[02:44:56.543 --> 02:45:03.790]  Now, sometimes the mouth is being very sad because it's a terrible event, and we feel for the families, but their eyes are smiling.
[02:45:03.891 --> 02:45:05.312]  Donna's right with that.
[02:45:06.653 --> 02:45:08.876]  The globalists really are into these bloodlines, it is true.
[02:45:09.196 --> 02:45:15.759]  Yeah, and sometimes it's the other way around, where the mouth is smiling, but the eyes are steely, steely cold.
[02:45:15.839 --> 02:45:20.221]  And I have no better example, in my experience, of that than Hillary Clinton.
[02:45:20.861 --> 02:45:21.542]  She's pure evil.
[02:45:21.582 --> 02:45:22.982]  Let's take another call here.
[02:45:23.042 --> 02:45:23.843]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:45:23.863 --> 02:45:25.203]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:45:25.243 --> 02:45:33.667]  David, in your books, you talk about the Committee of 300, which is a term that, as far as I know, only John Coleman refers to.
[02:45:35.623 --> 02:45:38.784]  What's the common thread among these people?
[02:45:39.245 --> 02:45:46.027]  Well, I mean, Committee of 300, CFR, Trilateral Commission, the same directors of the directors of all the same groups.
[02:45:46.288 --> 02:45:47.668]  Same with Bilderberg Group, David.
[02:45:48.448 --> 02:45:50.950]  Yeah, you could symbolize it as a spider's web.
[02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:53.030]  You've got the spider in the center of the web.
[02:45:53.170 --> 02:45:56.452]  They're the people in the shadows that control the web.
[02:45:57.032 --> 02:46:05.940]  And then as the web goes out, the closer the strand is to the spider, the more powerful and elite the organization is within the web.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.223]  And that inner ring around the spider is the Bilderberg Group Committee of 300, and it's all the same people.
[02:46:10.243 --> 02:46:11.644]  They just go to different meetings.
[02:46:11.745 --> 02:46:13.126]  Each group has a different job.
[02:46:13.346 --> 02:46:21.433]  Yeah, and the further you come out from the spider, that's when you start to meet the organizations that interact with society.
[02:46:22.393 --> 02:46:24.095]  And out that far,
[02:46:25.017 --> 02:46:33.681]  You know, you'll have some people who may not even be in on the know if you get far enough out to advance the agenda unknowingly.
[02:46:33.721 --> 02:46:40.924]  But it's like a spider's web, and the closer to the spider you are, the more power and the more elite the organization is.
[02:46:41.084 --> 02:46:52.988]  Michael, let you finish in a second, but David, does it encourage you to see all these former high-level Bush administration chief economists, and you have Paul Crick, Roberts, Morgan Reynolds, to see all, Michael Meacher, Andres Fambulo,
[02:46:54.569 --> 02:46:59.050]  Bob Knowles, former Chief of Staff, Stanley Hilton, all going public about government involvement in 9-11.
[02:46:59.371 --> 02:47:02.672]  Yeah, it's all part of this unraveling of what they're doing.
[02:47:02.712 --> 02:47:07.993]  I'll give you a quick example of just how high you can go before you really know what's going on.
[02:47:08.373 --> 02:47:14.895]  I did a talk in London years ago, and in the audience was the head of BP in South America.
[02:47:15.616 --> 02:47:18.196]  He'd retired, but he was down there running it.
[02:47:18.877 --> 02:47:19.777]  And he said to me,
[02:47:20.772 --> 02:47:26.455]  What I just heard has just made so much sense of what I experienced doing that job.
[02:47:27.335 --> 02:47:30.156]  And I didn't understand it at the time, but now I understand.
[02:47:30.176 --> 02:47:33.638]  I've heard that from incredibly prominent people that it never made sense.
[02:47:34.058 --> 02:47:35.258]  I was just told to do this.
[02:47:35.318 --> 02:47:36.399]  Now it makes perfect sense.
[02:47:36.439 --> 02:47:37.359]  Nothing else ever did.
[02:47:37.659 --> 02:47:43.742]  The most important thing we have to do is not just get information out there, but connect the dots.
[02:47:44.272 --> 02:47:51.518]  When you connect the dots, something over here that didn't really connect with that and make sense of the picture... That's another thing.
[02:47:51.538 --> 02:47:54.320]  Globalists never want us to look at things in the big context.
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:57.583]  They always want to look at things very minimalistic in a small area.
[02:47:57.783 --> 02:47:58.463]  Mike, finish up.
[02:47:59.144 --> 02:48:12.875]  Yeah, David, as far as this bombing in London, this guy, Peter Power, if that indeed is his name, if he's former Scotland Yard, he has to know the impact of what he was saying
[02:48:13.764 --> 02:48:18.565]  Is he trying to tip us off here as to this was really a government operation?
[02:48:19.625 --> 02:48:20.405]  Well, possibly.
[02:48:20.425 --> 02:48:23.646]  You know, only he knows, really.
[02:48:23.766 --> 02:48:41.270]  But certainly, you know, the compartmentalized pyramids or the compartmentalized web is such that you can get to, as we've just spoken about, to a high level in authority without being aware of what the big picture is that you're part of.
[02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:42.010]  We've got a break.
[02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:42.750]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.954 --> 02:48:49.818]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.078 --> 02:48:51.640]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:49:09.158 --> 02:49:13.860]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:18.502]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.702 --> 02:49:25.924]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:52:14.251 --> 02:52:15.672]  And it's time to stop denying that.
[02:52:16.513 --> 02:52:19.674]  It's a good song to, uh, come into this final segment.
[02:52:19.694 --> 02:52:24.817]  I'll have to get David Icke back more often than, you know, once a year or something if he'll do it.
[02:52:24.837 --> 02:52:27.379]  I'm gonna try to jam in Lori and Wolfgang's calls.
[02:52:27.399 --> 02:52:28.439]  That's all we have time for.
[02:52:28.459 --> 02:52:29.780]  But before we go back to David Icke,
[02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:34.354]  Grab your pens and paper because he'll tell you how to get his new book or any of his excellent books.
[02:52:34.394 --> 02:52:35.355]  He'll definitely get you thinking.
[02:52:36.195 --> 02:52:40.320]  And he's spot on when it comes to the terrorism, to use a British term.
[02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:42.682]  But I hope you'll get my new film, Martial Law.
[02:52:44.144 --> 02:52:47.427]  All I'm going to say is it's my best work, three hours long, a mini-series.

[02:52:48.748 --> 02:52:52.252]  It covers who the terrorists are, what their mindset is, what their plans are.

[02:53:14.443 --> 02:53:24.628]  David Icke, I want to jam a few calls in here right at the end, but in a closing statement before we take these calls, and we'll keep you on for those too, tell us how folks get your new book, and then just a few other comments.
[02:53:25.208 --> 02:53:31.632]  Well, they can go to DavidIcke.com, Ike being I-C-K-E, and they'll get details of all of them there.
[02:53:32.422 --> 02:53:33.442]  Um, comments?
[02:53:33.843 --> 02:53:42.466]  Um, I think it's a great time, um, to be alive for those of us who are trying to, uh, get across to people how they've been scammed all these years.
[02:53:42.886 --> 02:53:53.889]  Because you know, like I know, uh, you know, it could be a lonely furrow, and it was for a very, very long time, with people laughing, dismissing, and all the rest of it, and no one seeming to want to listen.
[02:53:54.090 --> 02:53:56.911]  Didn't your first meeting have, like, five people at it or something?
[02:53:57.311 --> 02:54:00.132]  Oh, you're talking to the man who spoke in Chicago to eight people, and, uh,
[02:54:01.532 --> 02:54:09.774]  And I've spoken to less in the past, because I was betrayed in Britain when I started coming out with all this stuff and other stuff as being a complete nutter.
[02:54:10.414 --> 02:54:18.896]  And people that used to laugh at me in the street are now buying my books and looking at my stuff.
[02:54:19.156 --> 02:54:21.217]  And that's the point I would emphasize.
[02:54:22.297 --> 02:54:27.538]  Just because someone believes or thinks something about you now doesn't mean they're going to think the same tomorrow.
[02:54:27.558 --> 02:54:30.039]  So do what you believe to be right,
[02:54:30.399 --> 02:54:31.780]  And what will happen will happen.
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:38.603]  Don't let other people, or the fear of what other people think, tell you what you do with your life and the truth that you speak.
[02:54:38.863 --> 02:54:48.787]  Well, David, Mark Twain said it in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:54:49.127 --> 02:54:51.208]  Lori in San Francisco, real fast, go ahead.
[02:54:51.568 --> 02:55:00.120]  Hi, I want to thank you so much for having David Icke on, and I want to thank David Icke for putting out the information that so few people have the true courage to really face that you didn't even get to on this interview.
[02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:07.611]  But my own question, and I'll listen to the answer off the air, is David Icke, what do you think about Deep Impact and blowing up that comment over Fourth of July?
[02:55:08.111 --> 02:55:08.412]  Thank you.
[02:55:09.855 --> 02:55:24.481]  Well, I think we've reached a point, Laurie, where, and I'm not going to claim to say I know the significance of all this, but we've reached a point where the agenda is such that all these major events are significant in some way.
[02:55:25.141 --> 02:55:38.292]  It's like we're meeting the center of the storm where all the plans that they've had and put together secretly all the way through these years and decades are now coming to pass.
[02:55:38.533 --> 02:55:39.934]  No, we're at the flashpoint.
[02:55:40.473 --> 02:55:43.736]  There is virtually nothing that is not significant.
[02:55:44.036 --> 02:55:47.599]  There's definitely no major event that's not significant to this agenda now.
[02:55:47.839 --> 02:55:48.880]  The battle has been joined.
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:49.801]  I'm sorry to Wolfgang.
[02:55:50.081 --> 02:55:51.503]  Wolfgang, call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:52.604 --> 02:55:53.624]  And I'll have you on for longer.
[02:55:53.664 --> 02:55:54.745]  I don't want to give you 30 seconds.
[02:55:55.746 --> 02:56:00.250]  Folks, get our reports on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:02.352]  Nobody's covering this bombing like my team.
[02:56:02.692 --> 02:56:03.573]  I'm so proud of them.
[02:56:04.073 --> 02:56:06.576]  Latest developments, be sure to check out DavidIke.com.
[02:56:06.596 --> 02:56:07.877]  A lot of news on this there as well.
[02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:10.119]  I think it's blown up in their face, David.
[02:56:10.139 --> 02:56:10.619]  Do you agree?
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:19.106]  Yes, and they're going to throw everything they can now to try to recover the control, but it's game over.
[02:56:19.146 --> 02:56:20.487]  It's just a case of playing it out.
[02:56:20.547 --> 02:56:22.369]  Yeah, they don't know it's over yet, but we do.
[02:56:22.429 --> 02:56:23.790]  God bless you, all of you.
[02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:24.291]  Take care.
[02:56:24.371 --> 02:56:24.671]  Bye.
