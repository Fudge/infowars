[00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:04.954]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:06.676]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.376 --> 00:00:08.477]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:09.958]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:11.619]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.902]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:20.545]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:36.847]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:38.108]  Here we are.
[00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:43.492]  It's already Thursday, the 27th day of January 2005.
[00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:45.573]  Almost said four.
[00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:51.077]  For 27 days of the month, I'm still having to consciously remember that it's 2005.
[00:00:53.038 --> 00:01:01.264]  Coming up in about six, seven minutes, we have one of the former top men at the KGB joining us.
[00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.594]  He was a master spy handler, and I have a lot of interesting questions for this gentleman.
[00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:16.758]  He'll be joining us from Moscow, so we'll see how the phone connection works, and hopefully this will all go off without a hitch.
[00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:30.226]  Coming up in the next hour, we have Larry Pratt joining us to talk about, well, Alberto, I love torture, and I hate the Second Amendment, and I love open borders, Gonzalez.
[00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:35.332]  Because Gonzalez just doesn't want to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:37.553]  As Lord Bush does.
[00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:40.333]  He wants even more gun control.
[00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:45.094]  And the NRA is almost mute on the subject.
[00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:47.195]  Gun owners of America is not.
[00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:50.436]  So, that's coming up as well.
[00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:52.796]  I'm sure you've heard of this already.
[00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:55.297]  Officer threatens to arrest woman for anti-Bush sticker.
[00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:59.638]  W-A-P-T Channel 16 TV out of Denver, Colorado.
[00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:10.944]  And then on top of that I have an article here where ten-year-olds arrested as terrorists for drawing stick figures of themselves stabbing a classmate.
[00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.948]  Now it's funny, they can have all these video games where you rip people's guts out and rip and kill women.
[00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.930]  Literally, those are the best-selling games.
[00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.393]  You go around machine-gunning everyone, but you draw a picture of it, you get arrested.
[00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:27.635]  But back when we were in school,
[00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:32.324]  If we drew something like that, they just didn't even pay attention to it.
[00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:40.087]  I never drew pictures of stabbing classmates, but I drew pictures of army tanks and troops and troops fighting.
[00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:41.768]  I don't know who didn't.
[00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.568]  We all did.
[00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:46.890]  The girls did flowers and houses and dogs and cats.
[00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.311]  And, you know, that's what they drew.
[00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.752]  And we drew tanks and troops killing each other.
[00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:58.246]  And my mother, years ago, opened up an old trunk and pulled out all the pictures her brother had drawn.
[00:02:58.807 --> 00:02:59.307]  Many of them.
[00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:00.087]  He's a good artist.
[00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:01.367]  Still to this day.
[00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:01.827]  My uncle.
[00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.469]  My uncle Forrest.
[00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.210]  People don't even know his name is Forrest.
[00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.270]  His nickname stuck.
[00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.691]  Biff.
[00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:18.852]  And there were all of the pictures of army tanks and planes.
[00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:30.375]  Stuff like that, because, you know, he was a little kid right after World War II, but I guess nowadays I'd be arrested, he'd be arrested, we'd all be arrested for drawing what kids draw.
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.780]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:46.704]  Plus a lot of news on the Iraq War, a lot of news on the fake election coming up in Iraq, a bunch of different police state developments, a big broadcast lined up for you on this live Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:55.826]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com and VirginUtah.com.
[00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:58.327]  And ArnoldExposed.com!
[00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.282]  We have lots of sites.
[00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:02.203]  There's a lot of different information on each site.
[00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:14.590]  We've got three different webmasters working on them, and it's all about giving you a lot of backup, basically mirror sites to go to, but also a lot of different information on the different websites, so we'll be covering that.
[00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.334]  But I can't wait to get into Alberto Gonzalez, that all the neocons are celebrating.
[00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:23.168]  Well, the rest of the people, Bush, are putting in.
[00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:31.993]  A bunch of gun-grabbing, open-border promoting, freedom-hating, warmongering, slave-mastering pieces of trash.
[00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:37.936]  But, better not talk about Gonzales or you're anti-Hispanic.
[00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.356]  Well, no, I'm not anti-Hispanic.
[00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:40.617]  I was against Ashcroft.
[00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:41.377]  He's a white guy.
[00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:48.581]  But I'm even more against Gonzales because he was actually a brain behind this legislation and garbage.
[00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:49.902]  Whereas, uh,
[00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:55.458]  Whereas, uh, the old Attorney General Ashcroft was just a puppet.
[00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:55.918]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:01.203]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:04.506]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:08.529]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.813]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:16.936]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:18.878]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:22.341]  Police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:27.125]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.328]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:30.508 --> 00:05:33.350]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:39.976]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:44.300]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.081]  Order your video today.
[00:05:46.402 --> 00:05:47.463]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.483 --> 00:05:49.765]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.831]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:09.273]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:10.113]  We listened.
[00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:15.414]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.175]  We listened.
[00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:19.596]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:20.016 --> 00:06:20.536]  We listened.
[00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:25.077]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:25.937]  We listened.
[00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:31.519]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.299]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:41.041]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:44.882]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.581]  That's toll-free, 808-803-4438.
[00:06:50.622 --> 00:06:51.504]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:06.600]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.261]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:18.523]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:25.005]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:26.365]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.666]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:30.707]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:07:30.787 --> 00:07:31.827]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:32.147 --> 00:07:39.370]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.071]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:07:47.936 --> 00:07:48.136]  Call today.
[00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:48.556]  Big Brother.
[00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:49.437]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.380]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.881]  You want answers?
[00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.502]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:15.805]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:20.508]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:34.197]  Victor Cherkashian, former top AGB spy chief, known as a master spy handler,
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.502]  He's scheduled to be joining us.
[00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:39.084]  Coming up also, Larry Pratt to talk about Alberto.
[00:08:39.504 --> 00:08:41.386]  I'm gonna get your guns, Gonzalez.
[00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:54.459]  When he's not saying he's gonna get Texas and New Mexico and Arizona and half of Colorado and Nevada and half of California.
[00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.281]  He openly says that belongs to Mexico.
[00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:07.438]  And when he's not saying that he wants your guns, and when he's not saying he wants to torture people, and torture's good, if we torture them up until death, it's not our fault if they die if it wasn't intentional.
[00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:11.265]  I mean, this guy is an absolute pig monster.
[00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:16.697]  I mean, it'd be like if we had a Ku Klux Klan leader as our Attorney General.
[00:09:16.897 --> 00:09:20.459]  Well, I guess we pretty much do with Senator Robert Byrd.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.581]  You've got to love it sometimes.
[00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:28.183]  If they're an establishment person, they can be as dirty as they want to be, and it doesn't matter.
[00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:30.504]  As long as they lick the boots of the New World Order.
[00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:31.465]  It's like Schwarzenegger.
[00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.026]  I don't care if Kirk of all times a Nazi.
[00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:36.067]  I love him, and Maria loves him, too.
[00:09:36.687 --> 00:09:37.568]  So thank you, Kirk.
[00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:39.897]  You know, it's just sick!
[00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:42.279]  Here, let me give you some Adolf Hitler records.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.561]  I love listening to Hitler speeches, don't you?
[00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:48.885]  Oh yes, Arnold, let's give you some Simon Wiesenthal Center awards.
[00:09:51.247 --> 00:09:53.930]  So it's just the same ridiculous hypocrisy.
[00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:05.232]  I don't want to hear anybody criticize the Aryan Nations, or anybody criticize the Ku Klux Klan, by the way, which I think are unsavory government-controlled organizations.
[00:10:05.532 --> 00:10:09.092]  I don't want to hear you criticize them if you're out here lauding Alberto Gonzales.
[00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:13.813]  And let me ask the Mexican supremacist a question, too.
[00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:17.154]  Because I know you're out there, I get your hateful emails and stuff occasionally.
[00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:18.874]  I want to ask you a question.
[00:10:19.734 --> 00:10:23.835]  Why is George Bush, you can't get any more waspish than him,
[00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:32.644]  Why is George Bush with all his Nazi connections, and his daddy's Nazi connections, and his daddy's Nazi connections, and all of it?
[00:10:32.884 --> 00:10:35.126]  Why are they supporting Alberto Gonzales?
[00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:38.068]  Because Wall Street wants to break up America.
[00:10:38.328 --> 00:10:39.689]  Wall Street wants our guns.
[00:10:39.989 --> 00:10:42.851]  Wall Street wants to sell us that torture's okay.
[00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:47.934]  Wall Street owns the media, and almost every show out there is promoting it.
[00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:49.695]  What's that?
[00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:52.182]  All right, we've got our guest.
[00:10:52.202 --> 00:11:03.349]  So coming up, we're going to talk about Alberto, I Love Torture, Gonzalez, this horrible new Attorney General, and we've got Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America coming on to expose this creature.
[00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.693]  So you do not want to miss this interview that is coming up in the next hour.
[00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:13.756]  All right, we have our guest from Russia.
[00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:16.111]  First time we've had a guest on from Russia.
[00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:19.296]  We've had him on from Germany and England and Australia and Mexico.
[00:11:19.336 --> 00:11:21.600]  But first time we've had a guest on from Russia.
[00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:24.926]  And he's Victor Cherkashin.
[00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:27.510]  And he's got a bio about 100 feet long.
[00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:46.773]  And his book, Spy Handler, is the gripping insider eyewitness account of the veteran KGB officer who led the recruitment and running of the United States' most damaging and notorious Cold War spies, the CIA's Aldrich Ames and the FBI's Robert Hanson.
[00:11:47.993 --> 00:11:51.935]  And he was in the KGB for 40 years, got the Lennon Award,
[00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:53.426]  Uh, you name it.
[00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:57.008]  So we're talking to the master spy handler.
[00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:00.851]  And, uh, Victor Cherkashian, great to have you on with us.
[00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:01.992]  Thanks for spending time.
[00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:07.176]  Uh, good evening, or it's better to say good day.
[00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:08.977]  I'm really happy to be with you.
[00:12:09.698 --> 00:12:12.120]  Well, it's good to have you on with us.
[00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:15.763]  You can probably talk about yourself a little bit better than I can.
[00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:21.367]  In a nutshell, or in a snapshot, tell us a little bit about yourself and why you wrote this book.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.161]  The reason is very simple.
[00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:36.009]  I retired from the service nearly 15 years back, that is, 14 years, in 1991, from the Soviet intelligence.
[00:12:36.169 --> 00:12:43.575]  And I served in the counterintelligence department for really about 30 years at the time, by that time, and... or 40 years, I'm sorry.
[00:12:53.138 --> 00:13:04.385]  And there was the period of the Cold War and the period of confrontation of the intelligence services of the United States and the Soviet Union.
[00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:13.591]  Now you were a colonel, you were a colonel in the KGB and that's higher than other ranks, I mean that's the equivalent, that's next to the highest level, correct?
[00:13:14.212 --> 00:13:16.253]  No, no, the colonel is a colonel.
[00:13:17.073 --> 00:13:22.417]  It's not the general, it's not the lieutenant, it's just the colonel, it's the rank.
[00:13:22.992 --> 00:13:31.797]  Alright, well explain to me what your, because you describe yourself as a master spy handler.
[00:13:31.817 --> 00:13:33.018]  I mean, what was your main job?
[00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:51.609]  My job was to try to prevent the attempts on the part of the foreign intelligence agencies, including the intelligence of the United States, to penetrate the
[00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:57.286]  Who would you say was more successful overall in infiltrating the Soviet Union or the United States?
[00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:28.397]  There have been several publications lately, including in the United States, certainly, about the activities of the intelligence agencies during the Cold War.
[00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:35.120]  And in some of those publications, the credit was awarded to
[00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:46.363]  The intelligence of the United States as the winner in the Cold War.
[00:14:46.903 --> 00:14:53.427]  I wouldn't say that because no one won in the Cold War.
[00:14:53.987 --> 00:14:59.571]  We just, both countries won the most important thing.
[00:14:59.591 --> 00:15:01.452]  We prevented the Cold War
[00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:09.128]  Turning into a hot war.
[00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.129]  Talking about?
[00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:15.152]  That was, I think, the most important achievement on both sides.
[00:15:15.693 --> 00:15:32.044]  As for the intelligence, I'm still of the opinion that the Soviet intelligence was and had been the most effective and the Soviet intelligence was not defeated in the Cold War.
[00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:39.176]  So you think the biggest achievement was mutually assured destruction and not having a thermal nuclear exchange?
[00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:40.678]  It's just a grip.
[00:15:41.078 --> 00:15:42.720]  You would describe it as a stalemate?
[00:15:45.002 --> 00:15:47.104]  That's not the point.
[00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:48.586]  It's just statement.
[00:15:50.267 --> 00:16:12.434]  Sir, again, I want to talk about your book, but I want to get some of my little questions out of the way first, because as is described here in the news, you were one of the top people over recruiting spies in the United States, and I want to go over that, but I've got a few other questions for you, and obviously you're there in Russia under him today, but Vladimir Putin has been
[00:16:13.154 --> 00:16:14.394]  I think it's impossible.
[00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:18.436]  Though I'm a strong supporter of the Soviet Union, I still believe in
[00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:46.998]  In the potential of the Soviet Union, of the Soviet Union's structure and the economy of the Soviet Union.
[00:16:47.358 --> 00:16:56.443]  But I understand that there is no way back in the development of mankind and you won't be able to change anything.
[00:16:56.824 --> 00:16:58.164]  We have to move ahead.
[00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:04.448]  As for the changes that you are observing in Russia these days,
[00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:20.530]  I think it's only natural that the government and the president are trying to find the best solutions to the problems arising in the new Russia.
[00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:26.933]  And we're supporting, we're trying to support the president in that.
[00:17:28.254 --> 00:17:33.797]  Your current president, Vladimir Putin, obviously was KGB, then FSB, but he was a chief over
[00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:41.488]  Uh, Leningrad, it has a different name every few years, but uh, do you know Vladimir Putin?
[00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:43.790]  Do you know what?
[00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:46.112]  Do you know Vladimir Putin?
[00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.895]  Uh, I didn't get the left word.
[00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:55.419]  Uh, Vladimir Putin, can you tell us about his days at the KGB?
[00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:59.682]  Oh, no, I never had any information, I've never met him, and uh,
[00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:11.230]  The only thing I know is that he was a KGB man.
[00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.932]  That doesn't compromise anyone nowadays.
[00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:21.755]  I think it's only natural that the KGB people were the most dedicated, the most educated.
[00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:27.499]  They were professionals and they were patriots of their country.
[00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:29.660]  Why shouldn't they be deprived of their rights?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.002]  Well, look at George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:18:32.062 --> 00:18:33.583]  I mean, he was a CIA director.
[00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:34.744]  Ah, yes.
[00:18:35.424 --> 00:18:38.947]  And he wasn't the worst president of the United States, by the way.
[00:18:40.167 --> 00:18:42.529]  He was one of the good presidents, isn't he?
[00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:44.610]  You like George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:45.431]  Why not?
[00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:48.113]  What do you think of his New World Order?
[00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:54.357]  You know, it's a complicated question.
[00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:07.457]  I think the United States might get into additional trouble with that, but that's up to... You think the United States is going to have some problems with the New World Order?
[00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:09.659]  Might, quite easily.
[00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:12.260]  Yeah, I think they're already having some problems with it.
[00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:22.987]  Well, again, we're talking to the author of Spy Handler, Memoir of a KGB Officer, The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanson and Aldrich Ames.
[00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:27.870]  We're honored to have him on with us.
[00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:40.076]  We're about to break, sir, and I want to come back and get into your book itself and your view from the inside of how you recruited these individuals and basically your take on it, okay?
[00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:40.917]  Okay.
[00:19:41.357 --> 00:19:41.637]  Thank you.
[00:19:41.837 --> 00:19:42.898]  We'll be right back, alright?

[00:20:57.262 --> 00:20:57.523]  1-800-6222-FIN.
[00:21:08.163 --> 00:21:10.084]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:10.565 --> 00:21:11.445]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:12.086]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:12.506]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:12.546 --> 00:21:14.988]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.869]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:18.350]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.811]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:35.643 --> 00:21:38.686]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:52.129]  Well, quite an endorsement for George Herbert Walker Bush by Victor Cherkashian.
[00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:53.189]  Spy master, spy handler.
[00:23:53.389 --> 00:23:55.571]  Handled Robert Hanson, Aldrich Ames, you name it.
[00:24:17.558 --> 00:24:22.579]  And the book is Spy Handler, and you can check on that coming out in stores.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:39.764]  Now, continuing, Mr. Cherkashian, or Colonel Cherkashian, I should say, tell us about your memoir here, and then describe for us, please, about how you recruited Robert Hanson and Aldrich James and others.
[00:24:44.508 --> 00:24:47.209]  I wouldn't put that question that way.
[00:24:47.549 --> 00:25:01.834]  I've told them already that in the profession of intelligence, recruitment is one of the means of bringing the people to understanding.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.321]  You shouldn't overestimate the role of a person.
[00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:14.362]  It could be a master spy or a master recruiter.
[00:25:15.123 --> 00:25:16.783]  It doesn't mean at all anything.
[00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:34.108]  The most important part is if a person with the information decides himself, for himself in the first place, to do something he considers to be the right thing to do.
[00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:43.532]  Without that, you won't be able to get anything.
[00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:46.874]  There will be no recruitment at all.
[00:25:47.335 --> 00:25:48.455]  You salve the conscience.
[00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:49.976]  We're doing this to stop war.
[00:25:50.016 --> 00:25:54.959]  We're doing this to really come together and also lots of cash involved.
[00:25:54.999 --> 00:25:55.900]  That's never bad either.
[00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.844]  The cash is the most important part in the whole business.
[00:26:03.988 --> 00:26:05.369]  It's the state of mind.
[00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:09.933]  Okay, well how did you become friends with Robert Hanson and Aldrich Haynes?
[00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:13.136]  I've never met any Hanson.
[00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:18.621]  But I mean through your intermediaries, I'm reading from the publisher here, through your intermediaries you were the spy handler.
[00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:19.421]  I mean how did this happen?
[00:26:19.882 --> 00:26:27.468]  Yeah, that's another story because I've never seen Hanson.
[00:26:27.989 --> 00:26:30.050]  I've never approached him.
[00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.611]  I've never
[00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:31.529]  I think so.
[00:26:53.058 --> 00:26:57.241]  Well, it says here, Colonel, that you are the one controlling them, from your book.
[00:26:57.602 --> 00:27:00.704]  Just explain to me, I mean, I want to know how this relationship was formed.
[00:27:00.784 --> 00:27:03.526]  The relationship, usually, usually the relationship depends
[00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:42.147]  On your, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[00:27:48.594 --> 00:27:53.698]  I bet they didn't find the tip of the iceberg of your spies, did they?
[00:27:54.218 --> 00:27:58.521]  I bet they didn't find one-tenth of the real moles, though, did they?
[00:27:59.562 --> 00:28:01.163]  Oh, you can't talk about that?
[00:28:09.118 --> 00:28:10.518]  I didn't quite get the question.
[00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:18.463]  Well, what I'm saying is, is how many of the KGB spies did the CIA or NSA catch?
[00:28:23.366 --> 00:28:30.911]  I'm sorry, it might be something on the line, but I can't get the question.
[00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:34.633]  How many of your spies got caught by the United States government?
[00:28:35.654 --> 00:28:37.655]  Ah, you mean how many spies?
[00:28:39.142 --> 00:28:39.522]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:39.582 --> 00:28:41.523]  I'm sure they didn't catch all of your spies.
[00:28:43.343 --> 00:28:49.945]  I would like to believe in that myself, but I don't have that information whether they've got any spies or not.
[00:28:50.285 --> 00:28:54.446]  Of course, the FSB, I'm sure, and others still have them operating here today.
[00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:56.126]  They might be.
[00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:59.727]  What do you think about Israel spying?
[00:29:00.047 --> 00:29:01.988]  I've read that it's even bigger than your spying.
[00:29:04.282 --> 00:29:14.988]  I do agree with you that the Israelis have really efficient and effective intelligence.
[00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:27.156]  I do agree with you that the whole life of the country has been made to have better intelligence.
[00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:30.838]  Yeah, I've read that about half our Congress is blackmailed by Israel.
[00:29:34.334 --> 00:29:36.795]  I'm sorry for your congressman.
[00:29:38.756 --> 00:29:39.817]  All right, stay there, sir.

[00:32:02.347 --> 00:32:09.692]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:09.992 --> 00:32:14.415]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.

[00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.431]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:04.801 --> 00:33:06.725]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:10.070]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.613 --> 00:33:13.517]  We're talking to Victor Cherkashian.
[00:33:14.585 --> 00:33:17.447]  And this is from the publisher of the book, Spy Handler.
[00:33:17.868 --> 00:33:34.840]  In this riveting memoir, Cherkashin provides a remarkable insider's view of the KGB's prolonged conflict with the United States, spanning his recruitment through his rising career in the counterintelligence to his prime spot as the KGB's number two man at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
[00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:43.367]  Cherkashin's story sheds stark new light on the KGB's inner workings over four decades and reveals new details about its major cases.
[00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:51.082]  But it was in 1985, known as the Year of the Spy, that Cherkashin scored two of the biggest coups of the Cold War.
[00:33:51.583 --> 00:33:58.671]  In April of that year, Cherkashin recruited disgruntled CIA officer Aldrich Ames and became his principal handler.
[00:33:59.617 --> 00:34:06.741]  Refuting and clarifying other published versions, Sherkashian offers the most complete account of how and why Ames turned against his country.
[00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:14.866]  As with Ames, Sherkashian also reveals new details about Hansen's recruitment and later exposure, as only he can.
[00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:20.849]  He also addresses the evidence that suggests that there is an undiscovered KGB spy
[00:34:21.527 --> 00:34:23.408]  That's what I wanted to raise earlier with him.
[00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:25.930]  Another Hanson or Ames still at large.
[00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.450]  How about hundreds of them?
[00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:33.574]  Spy Handler is a major addition to the Cold War history, hold by one of its key participants.
[00:34:34.762 --> 00:34:42.605]  And Victor Treccascio, who is a retired KGB colonel, was awarded the prestigious Order of Lenin during his four decades working for the KGB.
[00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:48.167]  He was stationed at various times in the West during his four decades working for the KGB.
[00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:53.129]  He was stationed at various times, again, in Germany, India, Australia, Lebanon, Washington, D.C.
[00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:57.651]  Following his retirement, he began a private security company in Russia, which he still runs.
[00:34:57.671 --> 00:34:58.631]  He lives in Moscow.
[00:34:59.611 --> 00:35:02.073]  Gregory Pfeiffer holds a B.A.
[00:35:02.113 --> 00:35:02.514]  and M.A.
[00:35:02.574 --> 00:35:04.115]  in Russian Studies from Harvard.
[00:35:04.155 --> 00:35:04.835]  Helped write the book.
[00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:07.398]  A former Radio Free Europe Moscow correspondent.
[00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:11.021]  Pfeiffer lived in Russia from 1998 to 2003.
[00:35:11.101 --> 00:35:17.766]  He covered Russia's politics for the number of publications including the Moscow Times, World Policy Journal, and Agency French Press.
[00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:19.388]  He lives in New York City.
[00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:24.952]  And again, the book, ladies and gentlemen, is Spy Handler.
[00:35:25.853 --> 00:35:26.253]  Alright.
[00:35:27.378 --> 00:35:47.227]  Victor Cherkashian, Colonel Cherkashian, continuing, of the Israeli intelligence, British MI6, CIA, who would you say is the most ruthless from your 40 years in the KGB looking out from the inside?
[00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:49.288]  Who would you say was the most vicious?
[00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:53.930]  Who used the most vicious tactics, you know, overall?
[00:35:57.579 --> 00:35:59.660]  That's a very complicated question to answer.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:19.484]  You know, in the history of all the intelligence services, there have been periods when the intelligence services used ruthless and very severe and different methods.
[00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:26.285]  I'm not in a position to judge, to be a judge, who was the champion and that.
[00:36:28.142 --> 00:36:39.427]  In my opinion, every intelligence service has its share in that black, I would say, black business.
[00:36:40.967 --> 00:36:41.808]  Black ops?
[00:36:44.149 --> 00:36:44.629]  Wet work?
[00:36:46.658 --> 00:36:49.459]  But I mean, certain intelligence agencies are known for using sex.
[00:36:49.479 --> 00:36:51.560]  I mean, they all do it, but some more than others.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:03.683]  Some are known just for using flat-out torture, or killing, or, you know, and there's combinations of all of it, but what would you say the KGB's specialty was, and is today, under FSB terms?
[00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:10.706]  I would say that for the last 30 years, at least,
[00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:22.145]  of the existence of the Soviet, even not Soviet, but 40 years of the existence of the Soviet intelligence.
[00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:35.593]  The people in the intelligence tried to use the most human method, that is friendliness, help and understanding.
[00:37:35.633 --> 00:37:40.236]  That is, with the methods of the kind you're saying that
[00:37:40.695 --> 00:37:43.336]  Using women, blackmail, and all that.
[00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:47.858]  I think somewhere in the beginning, perhaps, that was a popular method.
[00:37:48.358 --> 00:37:49.419]  But not lately.
[00:37:49.499 --> 00:38:02.384]  Lately, it's more the basis for mutual struggle for peace, for security of the countries, for understanding.
[00:38:04.144 --> 00:38:07.926]  I think that was more important than the rest of the methods.
[00:38:10.174 --> 00:38:11.675]  Very interesting.
[00:38:12.576 --> 00:38:16.118]  But I've heard some pretty scary stories about the KGB's dungeons.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.702]  I guess you can't talk about that or don't know anything about that, huh?
[00:38:22.922 --> 00:38:28.485]  I've never been in a position to deal with all those tricks.
[00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:31.347]  You were in a different compartmentalized area?
[00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:34.776]  You were in a different area.
[00:38:34.816 --> 00:38:37.156]  You were in recruitment, so you weren't in interrogation.
[00:38:43.518 --> 00:38:51.700]  Was the KGB a purely pyramidal structure, like the CIA in a compartmentalized system, or was it circular in your opinion?
[00:38:53.639 --> 00:39:01.123]  I think every intelligence service, KGB was certainly compartmentalized.
[00:39:01.724 --> 00:39:13.190]  What would you say, though, out of, say, Mossad, MI6, CIA, KGB, GRU, whatever, which one is the most pyramidal in its structure?
[00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.811]  I think the British.
[00:39:16.972 --> 00:39:17.272]  British?
[00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.990]  Yes, I think so.
[00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:26.474]  Actually, I was going to say, aren't they some of the most sneaky and vicious?
[00:39:28.515 --> 00:39:43.181]  I think the British intelligence had the history behind them of different periods and using different methods and they're more experienced.
[00:39:44.302 --> 00:39:46.703]  So are you saying the British are the slickest?
[00:39:48.627 --> 00:39:49.428]  That's my opinion.
[00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:51.529]  Yeah, well that's my opinion too.
[00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:57.131]  But I would say most active though now would be the Mossad, really.
[00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:09.377]  The Mossad, I wouldn't say they had the coverage, that coverage as the... But they know where to cover, right here in the United States.
[00:40:09.637 --> 00:40:12.378]  Certainly the Mossad, Mossad, the Israelis,
[00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:16.407]  I wanted to bring up terrorism.
[00:40:37.938 --> 00:41:00.286]  A lot of your people in your government today have said that they think Western intelligence agencies could be involved in 9-11, but at the same time, members of the FSB and others have gone public, and I don't expect you to answer this, but the 1999 bombings where they caught FSB in a fourth apartment, and then the FSB said it was just a drill.
[00:41:00.966 --> 00:41:04.908]  You've got any comments about the use of terrorism by governments to blame it on their enemies?
[00:41:07.206 --> 00:41:12.748]  I think it's a very dangerous path to step upon.
[00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:21.631]  And if you do that, then there is a danger that you'll become a terrorist organization yourself.
[00:41:22.592 --> 00:41:24.192]  Oh yeah!
[00:41:24.252 --> 00:41:26.373]  Were you aware of Operation Northwoods?
[00:41:27.245 --> 00:41:34.176]  Uh, that, you know, Kennedy had been a hawk and was doubling military funding, was for the Vietnam War, but then L.L.
[00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:38.443]  Limitzer came in to him and said, and this is now admitted, we have the document, and said, we want to
[00:41:39.282 --> 00:41:39.623]  I think?
[00:42:00.928 --> 00:42:01.769]  I don't think so.
[00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:01.869]  No.
[00:42:28.696 --> 00:42:29.496]  Do you have what?
[00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:31.537]  Do you have a computer in front of you?
[00:42:31.957 --> 00:42:32.737]  No, no, I don't.
[00:42:34.097 --> 00:42:35.038]  Do you have a computer?
[00:42:35.518 --> 00:42:37.598]  Yeah, I do have, but not at the moment.
[00:42:38.298 --> 00:42:42.159]  Well, when you're done, will you type Operation Northwoods in?
[00:42:42.339 --> 00:42:43.680]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.580]  I know about that.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:53.482]  I know about those rumors, but I think it's the history where politics
[00:42:55.648 --> 00:43:01.392]  We're playing the main part, the main role in the whole story.
[00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:02.993]  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:08.657]  I think China, Russia, all these countries did horrible things and were run by despots.
[00:43:09.038 --> 00:43:13.561]  But I'll be honest, our government is run by an even more sophisticated criminal oligarchy.
[00:43:13.861 --> 00:43:19.506]  We're now shifting into a fascist system where they communalize our wealth and give it to select corporations.
[00:43:20.303 --> 00:43:32.150]  And our government is taking what the Stasi did, what the Russians did, the worst stuff the Russians did, and actually perfecting it, and is using government-sponsored terror for world empire, and I wanted to get your comment on that.
[00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:44.557]  I'm glad you understand all that, and I'm sure you'll try to do something about that, to change the situation, for the better of the world, certainly.
[00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:56.199]  Are you aware that our government is contracting with the former head of the KGB, that they've hired Primakov as a consultant?
[00:43:56.919 --> 00:43:59.941]  Are you aware that they've even hired as a consultant the Silver Fox?
[00:44:01.242 --> 00:44:08.126]  Were you aware that they had hired the former head of the Stasi to help them set up their internal passports?
[00:44:09.927 --> 00:44:15.070]  I know that the United States, after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
[00:44:15.775 --> 00:44:31.799]  And the intelligence service of the United States has made a lot to get the access to the information of the Stasi and the rest of the Socialist Republic's special services.
[00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:43.862]  I know that there have been attempts, and not only attempts, but real moves to establish relations with the Russian intelligence
[00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:51.734]  But believe me, this is the influence of the new situation.
[00:44:51.994 --> 00:45:01.460]  The new situation that dictates the situation when the United States is the prime country in the world.
[00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:08.805]  The country which is trying to dictate, to impose their
[00:45:11.432 --> 00:45:17.056]  Uh, way of life and their priorities in life to other people.
[00:45:17.176 --> 00:45:17.996]  But I want to make it clear.
[00:45:18.016 --> 00:45:20.418]  Certainly, certainly they have the influence.
[00:45:21.072 --> 00:45:22.733]  But, Colonel, let's make it clear.
[00:45:23.213 --> 00:45:28.476]  The corporations that own America are just like the six oligarchs that own Russia today.
[00:45:29.257 --> 00:45:36.881]  They don't represent the Russian people or the American people, and the intelligence agencies are just their hired corporate enforcers.
[00:45:37.502 --> 00:45:46.807]  And so when you say America's taking over, no, America's been taken over, and now we're being used as an engine, like Napoleon used France, to take over the planet.
[00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:50.589]  That's a very interesting assumption.
[00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.291]  I've never thought about that.
[00:45:54.311 --> 00:45:55.872]  Oh, I bet you have.
[00:45:56.473 --> 00:45:59.635]  Certainly you know that the Russian system turned into an engine of empire.
[00:45:59.655 --> 00:46:01.056]  Yes.
[00:46:02.037 --> 00:46:05.699]  I know that in Russia we have a different system now where we have
[00:46:11.827 --> 00:46:25.811]  The formation of new and completely different to what we had in the Soviet Union, economical structure, with the oligarchs, with the influence on the government, with the government actually.
[00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:27.512]  But that's not the free market!
[00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:34.854]  You see, that's what communists were able to point out, is look at these corporations, look at these capitalists, they're bad!
[00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:38.855]  But that's not the free market, these are just organized criminals,
[00:46:39.657 --> 00:46:40.677]  I think what we need now
[00:47:06.855 --> 00:47:12.278]  Unfortunately, I'm now a pensioner and I'm not very keen on politics anymore.
[00:47:38.004 --> 00:47:44.730]  I understand what you're talking about and I do agree in the most part of your discussion.
[00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:49.273]  But that's something that we have to cope with.
[00:47:50.154 --> 00:47:51.655]  That's the reality.
[00:47:51.695 --> 00:47:53.737]  Why do you think George Herbert Walker is good?
[00:47:53.757 --> 00:48:00.662]  I've read that early on he actually tried to keep Gorbachev in and didn't want Yeltsin in there.
[00:48:00.682 --> 00:48:02.484]  I wonder why Bush Sr.
[00:48:02.804 --> 00:48:03.845]  wouldn't want Yeltsin in?
[00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:09.501]  The reason is very simple.
[00:48:12.704 --> 00:48:22.594]  I think the United States at the moment is interested in being on good terms with Russia.
[00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:23.094]  That's all.
[00:48:26.618 --> 00:48:30.702]  And so George Bush Senior, why do you say Herbert Walker is good?
[00:48:35.774 --> 00:48:39.136]  Earlier you said George W. Bush's daddy was a good guy.
[00:48:39.196 --> 00:48:40.597]  Why are you saying Herbert Walker's good?
[00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:45.941]  I'm not telling... that was sort of a joke, you know.
[00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:51.604]  I'm not in a position to judge your people, your presidents.
[00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:56.888]  I can tell you something about their politics, which I don't agree with.
[00:48:58.109 --> 00:49:00.570]  Let me ask you this.
[00:49:00.931 --> 00:49:02.852]  You say you're aware of Operation Northwoods.
[00:49:03.972 --> 00:49:10.157]  What do you think of the fact that the military in this country wanted to go to war with you that bad?
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.581]  I didn't quite get the question.
[00:49:14.641 --> 00:49:17.263]  You say you were aware of Operation Northwoods.
[00:49:17.464 --> 00:49:17.764]  Yes.
[00:49:18.304 --> 00:49:19.385]  When were you aware of that?
[00:49:21.767 --> 00:49:24.169]  Quite a bit of time back.
[00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.631]  How many years?
[00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:27.172]  Decades?
[00:49:29.554 --> 00:49:29.894]  Might be.
[00:49:31.972 --> 00:49:34.393]  Did you even know the name of the program at that time?
[00:49:35.253 --> 00:49:36.734]  No.
[00:49:37.094 --> 00:49:48.879]  I can't tell you exactly because I'm judging by the memory which sometimes might let me down.
[00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:55.921]  But you were aware of plans by this government to carry out terror attacks in America as a pretext for war.
[00:50:00.483 --> 00:50:06.589]  I would like to develop all that subject because I'm not an expert on that.
[00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:11.033]  Alright, well, it's been interesting having you on.
[00:50:14.016 --> 00:50:21.623]  Your observations that I've been listening to are very, very interesting and very instructive.
[00:50:22.114 --> 00:50:29.880]  I will send them all, and I'm afraid I will agree to most of the parts you said, you mentioned right now.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:30.800]  Thanks a lot.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.382]  Well, look, we're creating common ground together.
[00:50:33.402 --> 00:50:38.325]  Alright, well, Victor Trakashin, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:50:38.365 --> 00:50:40.467]  The book is Spy Handler.
[00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:44.029]  Take care, and stay warm over in Moscow.
[00:50:45.851 --> 00:50:46.191]  Bye-bye.
[00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.990]  All right, we'll come back.
[00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:50.451]  I've got some comments about this interview, and we'll cover news.
[00:50:50.491 --> 00:50:55.933]  And we've got Larry Pratt coming on to defend the Second Amendment against Alberto I Hate America Gonzalez.
[00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.233]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.134 --> 00:51:04.455]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.655 --> 00:51:09.097]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.237 --> 00:51:10.437]  There is a chance.
[00:51:10.998 --> 00:51:13.621]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:15.062]  The New World Order.
[00:51:15.743 --> 00:51:16.544]  Panamera.
[00:51:16.784 --> 00:51:20.989]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:27.996]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.117 --> 00:51:30.119]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:40.946]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government-run White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.106 --> 00:51:46.530]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:51:59.787 --> 00:52:01.388]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:01.528 --> 00:52:05.632]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:05.772 --> 00:52:08.654]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:15.459]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:15.639 --> 00:52:18.641]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:18.842 --> 00:52:21.243]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:21.363 --> 00:52:26.067]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:26.247 --> 00:52:27.087]  We're good to go!

[00:54:02.464 --> 00:54:08.486]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.106 --> 00:54:12.087]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.128 --> 00:54:21.190]  Well, we were talking to Victor Cherkashian, and you know, he was trying to manipulate me there at the end.
[00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:22.011]  Oh, yes.
[00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:23.571]  You know, we're buddies.
[00:54:24.292 --> 00:54:25.392]  This is how they do that.
[00:54:26.403 --> 00:54:27.624]  That's what our media does.
[00:54:27.824 --> 00:54:28.884]  Oh, we're your buddies.
[00:54:28.944 --> 00:54:30.065]  Give us your guns.
[00:54:30.565 --> 00:54:32.286]  Oh, the government's your friend.
[00:54:32.586 --> 00:54:33.327]  We're all doing this.
[00:54:33.347 --> 00:54:35.068]  We're all collaborating together.
[00:54:36.528 --> 00:54:39.330]  But talking to that guy, he was real slippery as you could hear.
[00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:43.212]  He didn't answer a lot of my questions, but overall it was still interesting.
[00:54:46.654 --> 00:54:47.855]  So you're welcome to comment on that.
[00:54:47.875 --> 00:54:50.496]  You know, I haven't given the phone number out yet, but the phone lines are loaded.
[00:54:50.536 --> 00:54:52.317]  We got Larry Pratt coming up, but early
[00:54:53.490 --> 00:55:04.834]  In that interview, I'll go to your calls, I guess about whatever issue you want to talk about, because Larry Pratt is a fellow patriot, truth seeker, freedom lover, and he's an expert on many different subjects, and it all affects our Second Amendment.
[00:55:05.274 --> 00:55:10.015]  So all of you that are holding, who called in without me giving out the number, that's fine, we'll go to you.
[00:55:11.336 --> 00:55:13.377]  Alberto Gonzales wants your guns!
[00:55:13.617 --> 00:55:15.797]  He doesn't just want the assault of Japan, he wants more!
[00:55:17.198 --> 00:55:19.519]  And I know that's conservative, so I'm a liberal.
[00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:20.739]  I'm against gun control.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:28.882]  They're in the new fake paradigm, but uh... that's coming up plus ten-year-olds arrested for drawing stick figures with knives.
[00:55:29.502 --> 00:55:30.522]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:55:30.562 --> 00:55:32.723]  They're being charged as evil terrorists with felonies.
[00:55:33.643 --> 00:55:34.903]  We'll be covering that.
[00:55:34.923 --> 00:55:39.544]  There is just so much coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:39.584 --> 00:55:42.625]  You do not want to miss it on this live Thursday edition.
[00:55:43.345 --> 00:55:50.967]  Before I continue with the news, and Larry Pratt is coming up, I'm carrying George Humphrey's 9-11-11 film, which is an excellent
[00:55:51.976 --> 00:55:55.839]  It's 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:55:55.859 --> 00:55:59.841]  It's about two hours long, and it's $19.95.
[00:56:01.062 --> 00:56:13.829]  When you buy one copy, you get a color, 85-page booklet, 9-11, The Great Illusion booklet that goes along with it with the documents and everything.
[00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:14.610]  That's a great deal.
[00:56:15.299 --> 00:56:23.643]  I have Eric Huffman's video, 9-11 Painful Deceptions, my two 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, and of course, The Masters of Terror.
[00:56:23.944 --> 00:56:35.730]  You can buy all four of those and get the book, you can buy them individually too, all four of those videos and get Paul Watson's 300-plus page book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.732]  You watch all four of those and read that book, you'll be an expert on government sponsored terror for $59.95.
[00:56:41.053 --> 00:56:41.533]  That's a $53 discount.
[00:56:44.581 --> 00:56:45.622]  Or buy them individually.
[00:56:45.762 --> 00:56:50.443]  Or you can get my film, Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long for $24.95 on DVD.
[00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:52.104]  Each additional copy $5.95.
[00:56:52.224 --> 00:56:53.665]  I'm still offering this.
[00:56:54.465 --> 00:56:55.465]  And it will come down soon.
[00:56:55.485 --> 00:56:57.166]  I just decided to keep extending it.
[00:56:57.606 --> 00:56:59.027]  Because people are taking advantage of it.
[00:56:59.647 --> 00:57:04.169]  Or you're authorized to get one copy of any of my videos that I've made and just make copies of them and give them to people.

[00:58:25.429 --> 00:58:26.290]  It'll cost you less than that.
[00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:27.491]  $5.95 for a month.
[00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:31.313]  3 or 4 cups of coffee cost about $5.95 now, these days.
[00:58:32.414 --> 00:58:36.737]  A little cup of Joe, a little 12 ounce cup of Joe is like a dollar at Exxon.
[00:58:37.722 --> 00:58:39.602]  The point is, it just pays for the bandwidth.
[00:58:39.943 --> 00:58:41.723]  FrozenPlanet.tv, it's a great deal.
[00:58:42.323 --> 00:58:44.404]  Alright, we're out of time for this hour.
[00:58:44.484 --> 00:58:46.184]  Second hour, straight ahead.
[00:58:46.224 --> 00:58:50.665]  Keep it locked in.
[00:58:56.406 --> 00:58:57.066]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.727 --> 00:58:58.827]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.487 --> 00:59:00.587]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:02.068]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.828 --> 00:59:03.608]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.406 --> 00:59:08.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:12.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.732 --> 00:59:21.999]  You know, I tune in to Neocon talk show hosts every day when I'm out driving around in my car in the morning, the afternoon, the evening.
[00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:29.405]  And with almost no exception, they go, the evil liberals
[00:59:30.777 --> 00:59:32.458]  Why, they're gonna get your guns.
[00:59:32.498 --> 00:59:34.438]  The evil liberals, they're for open borders.
[00:59:34.498 --> 00:59:40.120]  The evil liberals, they're for signing on to UNESCO treaties in the UN.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:50.644]  The evil liberals, they're... And then I go look at Congress, and it's actually Democrats are voting more often than with Bush on most issues than Republicans are.
[00:59:52.244 --> 00:59:54.845]  Which is why you could still call me a conservative at some level.
[00:59:55.685 --> 00:59:57.166]  According to the, you know, popular term.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.160]  But I look at Bush's nominees.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:07.382]  I mean, I look at... I look at the man who went after Judge Roy Moore in Alabama, who was the Attorney General there.
[01:00:07.442 --> 01:00:09.022]  Bush promotes him to a federal judgeship.
[01:00:09.742 --> 01:00:14.103]  I look at Condoleezza Rice, a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, un-American person.
[01:00:14.783 --> 01:00:25.685]  I look at Alberto Gonzalez, a member of Mecha La Raza for open borders, for gun control, for torture, helped write the Patriot Acts that attacked the Second Amendment,
[01:00:27.094 --> 01:00:32.876]  And, uh, I hear the limbaws of the world going, hail, hail, uh, Alberto.
[01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:35.177]  Uh, boy, he's a good conservative.
[01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:36.918]  The evil liberals are trying to stop him.
[01:00:37.838 --> 01:00:38.799]  And that's just not true.
[01:00:40.379 --> 01:00:42.440]  And so, we're going to lose the Second Amendment, folks.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.021]  I mean, you, you think Ash, you know, Ashcroft's pro-Second Amendment.
[01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:47.662]  Yeah, he said, it's prescribed by law.
[01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:52.064]  He's saying the law, some little petty regulation, is above the Second Amendment.
[01:00:52.324 --> 01:00:54.004]  Nothing is, but God Almighty.
[01:00:55.145 --> 01:00:55.645]  Nothing is.
[01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:57.992]  It just points out our God-given rights.
[01:00:59.033 --> 01:00:59.914]  You can't change it.
[01:01:00.614 --> 01:01:02.235]  It's inalienable.
[01:01:02.355 --> 01:01:03.416]  It cannot be altered.
[01:01:04.257 --> 01:01:05.358]  It's set in stone.
[01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:13.484]  And Gonzales, oh, my brother's a SWAT team commander, and I'm for the assault weapons ban, and I'm for gun control generally.
[01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:16.566]  Well, joining us for the next 45 minutes is a great American,
[01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.100]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.041]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:20.061 --> 01:01:20.741]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:21.782]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:21.802 --> 01:01:23.103]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:23.123 --> 01:01:24.244]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:24.944]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:26.245]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:28.006]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:28.327 --> 01:01:29.447]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:29.467 --> 01:01:30.488]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:30.508 --> 01:01:32.129]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:33.310]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:34.491]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:35.511]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:35.531 --> 01:01:36.372]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.253]  Hey, it's good to be with you again.
[01:01:38.293 --> 01:01:39.374]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:39.514 --> 01:01:40.915]  Hey, it's good to be with you.
[01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:45.338]  Hey, it's good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good N, N, N, N, N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N And N And N
[01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:50.149]  So I guess we got the Assaults Ban down for now, but they're back with a vengeance and it's Republicans!
[01:01:51.090 --> 01:02:02.781]  Well, we have an Attorney General nominee, as you know, Mr. Gonzalez, who volunteered that he really supports gun control in his heart.
[01:02:03.601 --> 01:02:09.607]  He didn't just say he agrees with his boss that, yeah, if you put the renewal of the Clinton ban on his desk,
[01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:10.571]  I think?
[01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:36.397]  tend to get a crack at litigation that goes up to the Supreme Court on the gun issue, and Ashcroft, I think, was on the wrong side.
[01:02:36.957 --> 01:02:51.309]  There was that Dr. Timothy, oh golly, I just went brain dead, the Texas physician who got slammed for having a gun from a domestic misdemeanor, and that went through the Fifth Circuit, and they ruled fairly well
[01:02:52.230 --> 01:03:03.322]  And on appeal of the Supreme Court, they wouldn't listen to the requirement that the Fifth had put on it, that it had to go back and be reheard in court.
[01:03:03.882 --> 01:03:13.753]  And Ashcroft was there arguing that, no, this didn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to have an ex post facto law take away your Second Amendment rights.
[01:03:15.229 --> 01:03:26.474]  So, that was a pretty significant case, I thought, and it certainly vindicated our not having supported Ashcroft when he was up for nomination, and we're not supporting Gonzales either.
[01:03:26.494 --> 01:03:29.315]  Yeah, but Gonzales is even worse.
[01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:30.315]  It sounds like it.
[01:03:30.735 --> 01:03:31.355]  It sounds like it.
[01:03:31.756 --> 01:03:32.816]  Larry Pratt, stay there.
[01:03:32.856 --> 01:03:40.639]  We'll be right back to go over Gonzales' activities, what we're facing with the Bush administration,
[01:03:41.374 --> 01:03:46.905]  The fight has just begun and most conservatives are sucking their thumbs in the corner thinking they've died and gone to heaven.
[01:03:47.466 --> 01:03:48.909]  Well, no, you've died and gone to hell.
[01:03:48.949 --> 01:03:49.510]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:58.801]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:00.483]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:00.683 --> 01:04:02.886]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:05.128]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:10.333]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:14.718]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:16.719]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:16.739 --> 01:04:27.463]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:27.603 --> 01:04:29.504]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:29.704 --> 01:04:33.586]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:34.946]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:54.842]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:55.182 --> 01:05:04.012]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:04.332 --> 01:05:08.998]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:09.458 --> 01:05:16.186]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:16.587 --> 01:05:28.401]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:33.303]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:35.804]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:40.547 --> 01:05:41.607]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:50.695 --> 01:05:51.755]  Are you a diabetic?
[01:05:51.835 --> 01:05:54.436]  Do you have Medicare or private insurance?
[01:05:54.776 --> 01:05:58.697]  If you do, here's some great news that could save you time and money.
[01:05:58.897 --> 01:06:04.838]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, iCare may be able to provide your supplies at no cost to you.
[01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:05.759]  Here's why.
[01:06:06.159 --> 01:06:11.680]  We work with Medicare and most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.081]  So we can ship your supplies free right to your door.
[01:06:15.322 --> 01:06:17.883]  So I want you to call us right now.
[01:06:17.903 --> 01:06:18.563]  800-419-2335.
[01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:18.943]  800-419-2335.
[01:06:19.063 --> 01:06:28.808]  So if you have diabetes, we make it real easy for you here at iCare.
[01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:33.570]  We are an approved Medicare provider and we do all the paperwork.
[01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:35.331]  So all you have to do is call.
[01:06:35.731 --> 01:06:38.293]  Alright, most of my conservative friends have gone to sleep.
[01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:10.778]  They'll look me in the eyes and say, hey, how dare you talk bad about Alberto Gonzalez?
[01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:16.040]  And I tell them he's a member of Mecha, which is openly the equivalent of a Hispanic Klan group.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.201]  And their own website talks about killing whites and driving them out of the U.S.
[01:07:20.281 --> 01:07:22.842]  I mean, it's scary stuff out of the Southwest.
[01:07:23.722 --> 01:07:25.202]  He's for open borders.
[01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:26.743]  He's for gun bans.
[01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:32.945]  He is for not telling parents when their 12-year-old daughter goes and has an abortion.
[01:07:33.465 --> 01:07:34.345]  It's pro-abortion.
[01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.456]  I mean, this guy actually out-Clinton's Clinton.
[01:07:38.818 --> 01:07:39.979]  And he's your new Attorney General.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.343]  Gonna be your new Attorney General, approved already in one section of the Congress.
[01:07:44.783 --> 01:07:46.465]  So, this is what we're facing right now.
[01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:59.738]  And whereas Ashcroft, on the surface, said I'm for the Second Amendment if prescribed by law, and then, as Larry Proud was saying, of the Governors of America in the last little segment, he went to federal court time and time again and actually argued against it.
[01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:02.234]  And Bush got up and gave speeches.
[01:08:02.254 --> 01:08:03.655]  Hey, I'm for the Second Amendment.
[01:08:04.135 --> 01:08:07.277]  And people called in and said, Oh, she's for the Second Amendment, Alex.
[01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:13.061]  Well, I mean, you know, a serial killer tells a woman he just wants to give her a ride, too.
[01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:14.202]  Doesn't mean he's telling the truth.
[01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:16.903]  And this is what I'm sick of.
[01:08:17.103 --> 01:08:18.464]  I don't listen to what they say.
[01:08:18.564 --> 01:08:19.305]  Watch what they do.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.524]  That's what Larry Pratt does, is he watches what Lord Bush does.
[01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:27.148]  And I mean, everybody Bush is putting in are a bunch of anti-American gun grabbers.
[01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:31.692]  I mean, his second time in, when he's not facing re-election, he's showing us what he is, like his daddy.
[01:08:32.013 --> 01:08:33.054]  A New World Order right.
[01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:36.577]  And Larry Pratt looks like we got some tough going here.
[01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:40.682]  And I don't even know if most of the conservatives out there know there's a ball game going right now.
[01:08:41.397 --> 01:08:47.741]  So far, it's been a little lonely in leading the opposition to Mr. Gonzalez.
[01:08:49.862 --> 01:09:03.910]  In truth, I'm sure Bush is not likely to change his mind on this, but part of it is because he is getting support from the conservatives by and large, and I guess it's because, well, gee, it's a Republican Hispanic.
[01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:08.273]  Well, he may be a Republican, certainly an Hispanic, but as you've pointed out,
[01:09:08.948 --> 01:09:19.913]  He's got a background and it's not as if you have to put your hand over your eyes and say, let me see now, what will the spirit reveal to me?
[01:09:20.233 --> 01:09:21.934]  No, the guy's got a public record.
[01:09:22.654 --> 01:09:29.577]  He was a judge in Texas and he did take part in positions... Larry, hold on a second.
[01:09:29.597 --> 01:09:30.658]  Can we boost Larry's audio?
[01:09:31.699 --> 01:09:32.259]  Go ahead, Larry.
[01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:33.040]  Okay, fine.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.720]  Sorry about that.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.200]  No, no, no.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:34.500]  Go ahead.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.941]  I hope we're coming through all right.
[01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:36.361]  Yeah, you are.
[01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:37.942]  I can tweak it on this end, too.
[01:09:39.062 --> 01:09:53.288]  But he was part of decisions in the Texas court that were pro-abortion, and he has been associated with these radical Mexican groups that, as far as I can tell, they're not even pro-
[01:09:54.568 --> 01:09:55.248]  Spaniard.
[01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:58.090]  They're pro-Aztec.
[01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:07.614]  These are the guys that I guess would like to return to cutting your heart out while you're a live victim of their idol worship.
[01:10:08.714 --> 01:10:14.137]  That's the kind of revangeism that I see coming out of La Raza.
[01:10:14.157 --> 01:10:21.780]  Actually, we've been to their rallies and they have pictures of blonde-haired, blue-eyed people with their brains blown out or with Aztec warriors cutting their hearts out.
[01:10:22.572 --> 01:10:26.714]  And 95% of Hispanics I talk to don't like this organization.
[01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:28.815]  But it just so happens he's a member of that.
[01:10:28.835 --> 01:10:34.098]  I mean, we could have found lots of Hispanics who would have made great U.S.
[01:10:34.158 --> 01:10:34.838]  Attorney General.
[01:10:35.419 --> 01:10:37.460]  So we're not against having a Hispanic Attorney General.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.060]  I don't care.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.822]  In fact, I wouldn't care if the whole cabinet was Hispanic if they reinstate the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:10:42.962 --> 01:10:43.543]  Absolutely.
[01:10:43.723 --> 01:10:47.865]  It would sound very good in Spanish or in English as long as it's the Constitution.
[01:10:50.067 --> 01:10:51.448]  And it translates into Spanish.
[01:10:51.509 --> 01:10:52.229]  I speak Spanish.
[01:10:52.269 --> 01:10:54.472]  I can do that for you if we need to.
[01:10:54.892 --> 01:11:03.682]  But this is a very disturbing situation that we're playing ethnic politics above anything else.
[01:11:04.062 --> 01:11:09.108]  And that may be all part of a clever Karl Rove design.
[01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:17.137]  to take Hispanics away from the Democrat Party and there's some evidence that the plan may be working.
[01:11:17.157 --> 01:11:22.764]  Yeah, Bush got 35% of the Hispanic vote, which is unprecedented for Republicans, but again, what does he put in?
[01:11:22.784 --> 01:11:25.287]  A bunch of Hillaryites, basically.
[01:11:25.567 --> 01:11:29.409]  Well, it's not something that pleases me.
[01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:41.315]  And frankly, with the election of somebody like Mel Martinez, you've got evidence that you don't have to have some kind of left-winger that Hispanics will support.
[01:11:41.455 --> 01:11:53.281]  Martinez, I thought, was... Well, I was pleasantly surprised when during the campaign he referred to the kidnappers of Elian Gonzalez as jack-booted thugs.
[01:11:53.981 --> 01:12:00.705]  That's not a real friendly thing to say about Janet Reno, but then Janet Reno was not a real friendly sort of person.
[01:12:01.285 --> 01:12:05.347]  And he said, well, yeah, I respect the Second Amendment.
[01:12:05.367 --> 01:12:10.610]  That was what Castro went after in order to take the rest of our liberties away, and that's why I'm a refugee.
[01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.472]  Well, why can't we get somebody like that?
[01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:16.795]  You know, Bush put him in as Housing Secretary.
[01:12:16.855 --> 01:12:17.415]  Why can't we?
[01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:20.337]  Is he the only one that believes like that?
[01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:21.238]  No, I don't think so.
[01:12:21.278 --> 01:12:29.004]  I know a lot of Hispanics, and you don't have to go to the Mr. Gonzalez's of the world to find somebody for a position.
[01:12:29.064 --> 01:12:31.967]  Well, it's a total distraction from what's really happening.
[01:12:31.987 --> 01:12:32.907]  Again, we have the NRA.
[01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:35.309]  Go lobby last year.
[01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:36.950]  I read their case on air.
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.651]  They're filing.
[01:12:38.031 --> 01:12:42.174]  And it said, we are for all guns to be registered in the District of Columbia.
[01:12:42.214 --> 01:12:44.296]  We believe you shouldn't be able to leave your home with a gun.
[01:12:44.696 --> 01:12:48.039]  Their argument for the Second Amendment was that there was no Second Amendment.
[01:12:48.079 --> 01:12:49.300]  Of course, they even lost the case.
[01:12:52.071 --> 01:13:04.097]  Well, the silence is pretty deafening on most of the right, and I think part of it is they just figure, well, why bother?
[01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:05.638]  Well, I agree.
[01:13:06.198 --> 01:13:11.181]  I'm not too hopeful that we're likely to win this fight, but on the other hand, if we let Bush
[01:13:11.901 --> 01:13:12.062]  I think?
[01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:37.081]  We were convinced that, at a minimum, you communicate to the other side that if you're going to do something like this, it's going to hurt you.
[01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:43.962]  Even if you get what you want in the end, have you really considered how high the price is going to be?
[01:13:44.062 --> 01:13:48.563]  Well, when Bill Clinton got the assault weapons ban passed, people panicked.
[01:13:49.283 --> 01:13:51.263]  It's all the limbaus the world talked about.
[01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:54.984]  People were going into gun shows with giant pallets, grabbing everything they could.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:05.042]  People at gun shops were freaking out, talking about a revolution, and Bush says he's for it, wants to re-pass it, and then goes, well, I guess we better just turn our guns in!
[01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:06.843]  I'm pretty concerned.
[01:14:06.883 --> 01:14:08.403]  I mean, that is sick!
[01:14:08.763 --> 01:14:13.024]  Well, it cost the Democrats control of the Congress, so far.
[01:14:13.744 --> 01:14:16.045]  Well, we're going to find out what these so-called conservatives want.
[01:14:16.245 --> 01:14:19.405]  Do they want to just stick a W sticker on their car and feel conservative?
[01:14:19.645 --> 01:14:22.246]  Do they love Bush more than they love the Second Amendment?
[01:14:23.115 --> 01:14:32.157]  Well, this is going to be one of those moments of truth because there's a lot more than, as you've indicated already, there's a lot more than just the gun issue at stake.
[01:14:32.698 --> 01:14:40.480]  I would say, I don't know where he is on taxes, but I would imagine with the company he's kept, he's probably pretty bad on that too.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:46.921]  There you have described with abortion taxes and guns pretty much the core of the Republican base.
[01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:48.722]  And here's a guy being put
[01:14:49.422 --> 01:15:05.574]  In a very conspicuous position, in a time when we're involved in a war on terror and the Justice Department is grabbing more and more power in the name of fighting that fight, and the whole conservative movement, the Republican base, is just going to sit there and watch it?
[01:15:06.254 --> 01:15:09.096]  That's a little disappointing, shall we say.
[01:15:09.977 --> 01:15:11.157]  Well, that's because they don't know.
[01:15:11.918 --> 01:15:13.579]  Most cities don't get this radio show.
[01:15:13.599 --> 01:15:17.602]  They're listening to the Wieners and the Limbaughs and the rest of them who are not telling them.
[01:15:18.593 --> 01:15:22.334]  Well, they certainly, hopefully, some of them, are getting our email.
[01:15:22.635 --> 01:15:29.677]  And as you probably know, we've put out an email alert to our members saying, hey, you know, we've got to communicate to Bush.
[01:15:30.478 --> 01:15:33.879]  He can't get the idea that he can do whatever he wants.
[01:15:34.359 --> 01:15:38.423]  Yeah, and what he's saying is that he doesn't worry about the safety of those of us
[01:15:54.378 --> 01:16:01.806]  Who will never see his brother and probably never see a cop when a bad guy threatens us because... Well, Mr. Gonzales isn't stupid.
[01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:07.772]  He knows the most dangerous cities in the country, New York, D.C., Chicago, have gun bans.
[01:16:07.812 --> 01:16:09.334]  He knows that's where the cops get killed!
[01:16:09.824 --> 01:16:11.705]  He doesn't care about his brother!
[01:16:11.725 --> 01:16:13.465]  He cares about power and control!
[01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:16.986]  Because he likes torture and he can't wait to get our guns so he can have fun with us!
[01:16:17.386 --> 01:16:27.529]  Well, the fact that he is part of this movement that seems to want to have the restoration of Aztec heart cutters restored to the greater Southwest
[01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:33.812]  That's a power program if there ever was one.
[01:16:34.493 --> 01:16:40.397]  Those guys are Marxist to the core in La Raza and Mecha and those kind of groups.
[01:16:40.877 --> 01:16:41.817]  Those are bad actors.
[01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:44.379]  Well, what's wrong with having a group called The Race, Larry?
[01:16:44.419 --> 01:16:45.820]  Let's go start one ourselves!
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.983]  And when they say, you've got a thing called The White Race, we'll go, well...
[01:16:50.863 --> 01:16:52.664]  Well, La Raza means the race.
[01:16:53.144 --> 01:16:54.605]  Listen, you know what happens.
[01:16:55.065 --> 01:17:00.528]  There was a group out in, I think it was California, and they had the same impulse that you're talking about.
[01:17:01.188 --> 01:17:07.051]  A bunch of, I think they might have been college Republicans, and they had a bake sale for a white scholarship.
[01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:13.274]  It was during the time of the hoorah over affirmative action.
[01:17:13.655 --> 01:17:17.176]  And they said, well, okay, good, you do your thing and we're going to do our thing.
[01:17:17.296 --> 01:17:19.578]  And they liked it, got kicked off the campus.
[01:17:21.499 --> 01:17:22.360]  Yeah, obviously.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.521]  I mean, it's a double standard.
[01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:25.843]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[01:17:25.903 --> 01:17:27.565]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:35.832]  It's scary because, I mean, obviously you wrote Announcements of Patriot Act II, which now we learn Gonzalez wrote most of it.
[01:17:37.514 --> 01:17:39.175]  And that affects the Second Amendment.
[01:17:39.195 --> 01:17:40.056]  I mean, this is scary.
[01:17:40.914 --> 01:17:52.944]  Yeah, it's a fascination with government power, assuming that even if you give it an innocent construction, it's the assumption that somehow with more power, we're going to be more safe.
[01:17:53.624 --> 01:17:57.508]  And historically, that's just a stupid position to take.
[01:17:57.568 --> 01:18:00.290]  There is no way to defend that whatsoever.
[01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:03.452]  It doesn't work, and people have known that for a long time.
[01:18:04.373 --> 01:18:06.455]  I think it was Benjamin Franklin that warned
[01:18:07.196 --> 01:18:13.851]  That if we thought we were going to get security by trading in our freedom, we would deserve neither and probably get neither.
[01:18:14.645 --> 01:18:24.067]  So, this is not a newsflash that you and I are communicating, but apparently here in Washington, it's a totally unheard of idea.
[01:18:24.087 --> 01:18:25.228]  Well, they don't care.
[01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:27.608]  It's not meant to work and really stop terror.
[01:18:27.948 --> 01:18:29.188]  It's meant to give them more power.
[01:18:29.328 --> 01:18:29.929]  More power.
[01:18:29.949 --> 01:18:31.549]  And it'll certainly work in that respect.
[01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:33.990]  In that respect, it'll be very successful.
[01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:41.591]  When we come back, I want to take some calls, but I also want to get into this assault weapons ban, which they're trying to bring back to the floor, and the fight.
[01:18:41.631 --> 01:18:43.952]  And we're just going to wake up one day and hear it's passed again.
[01:18:44.838 --> 01:18:46.678]  I'll be called a liberal for being against it.
[01:18:46.758 --> 01:18:47.358]  I understand.
[01:18:47.378 --> 01:18:48.639]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.659 --> 01:18:49.099]  Stay with us.

[01:19:48.689 --> 01:19:52.611]  It still is!
[01:20:00.592 --> 01:20:04.095]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:06.217]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:08.840]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.422]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:20:11.803 --> 01:20:19.470]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.

[01:21:52.026 --> 01:21:58.288]  Hi, this is Tasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pep back in your step.
[01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:03.470]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:16.936]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:22:17.196 --> 01:22:20.437]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[01:22:20.697 --> 01:22:23.057]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[01:22:23.257 --> 01:22:27.098]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[01:22:27.298 --> 01:22:30.359]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[01:22:30.599 --> 01:22:34.099]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[01:22:34.359 --> 01:22:38.460]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.981]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[01:22:41.161 --> 01:22:44.501]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:48.262]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:09.508]  Alright, we're talking to Larry Threat, Chairman, Head, Big Dog at Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org is the website.
[01:23:09.528 --> 01:23:16.172]  You can go sign up for free email alerts that I recommend you get, because you're never going to hear about it from the National Talk Show host.
[01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:18.874]  You're never going to hear about it from the NRA.
[01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:20.195]  You're just not going to hear about it.
[01:23:21.016 --> 01:23:27.100]  And Larry, I've actually gotten emails from people going, you know, how dare you criticize Gonzalez.
[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:29.402]  I'm a Republican and he's great.
[01:23:30.348 --> 01:23:31.408]  And you're a liberal.
[01:23:32.348 --> 01:23:36.209]  And so, because I'm against losing the Second Amendment, I'm now a communist, basically.
[01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:45.051]  Well, it doesn't seem to me that the folks that are criticizing you are familiar with Gonzalez's record, the things that are on the record.
[01:23:45.231 --> 01:23:46.851]  These are not allegations.
[01:23:47.091 --> 01:23:48.911]  These are his own statements.
[01:23:48.951 --> 01:23:58.733]  You've correctly quoted him on the gun issue, and I'm aware that he's had rulings that were pro-abortion while he was on the Texas court.
[01:24:00.504 --> 01:24:04.185]  And he does have his fingerprints all over the Patriot Act.
[01:24:05.826 --> 01:24:08.066]  Why do some conservatives want to be in denial?
[01:24:08.406 --> 01:24:23.810]  You know, if it were before the election, and they were concerned, and I've talked to people like that who are concerned about, well, if we rock the boat, then Bush might lose and Kerry would win, and that would be just beyond what we can think about.
[01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:24.911]  That's one thing.
[01:24:24.951 --> 01:24:26.032]  But the election's passed.
[01:24:26.232 --> 01:24:27.173]  That's not going to happen.
[01:24:28.674 --> 01:24:31.737]  Making Mr. Bush accountable is what we ought to be all about right now.
[01:24:33.098 --> 01:24:34.480]  Well, I hardly agree with you.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:38.864]  And, again, do you love that W sticker on your car, feeling like you're conservative?
[01:24:39.364 --> 01:24:40.405]  Or do you love this country?
[01:24:41.046 --> 01:24:43.548]  I mean, Gonzales, I've got copies of his memo.
[01:24:43.688 --> 01:24:45.770]  They won't release the whole thing, but the memo that came into court.
[01:24:46.388 --> 01:24:53.958]  Where he says, we can torture people until organ failure, and if they die and we didn't intend them to die, it's still not torture.
[01:24:54.438 --> 01:24:59.405]  So he's saying we can torture people to death, and it's not torture, Larry.
[01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:07.574]  Well, that's a pretty interesting position, and I think that should be a matter of concern.
[01:25:07.614 --> 01:25:10.337]  It shouldn't be just liberals that are concerned about that.
[01:25:11.017 --> 01:25:16.623]  I don't know that we've really had any discussion of that during the hearings, at least I'm not aware of it.
[01:25:17.703 --> 01:25:29.951]  And perhaps more to the point for all of us, maybe not all of us are going to be tortured, but we're all going to have our privacy invaded in one way or another by the Patriot Act, and that ought to be a concern.
[01:25:29.971 --> 01:25:36.194]  Yeah, this just shows his mindset, and he's one of the, with Zia Dinn and others, one of the architects of it, along with Chertoff.
[01:25:36.254 --> 01:25:37.195]  It just gets worse and worse.
[01:25:38.035 --> 01:25:40.437]  Legislatively, they're trying to sneak it back through.
[01:25:40.457 --> 01:25:42.138]  What's going on with that, Larry?
[01:25:43.047 --> 01:25:50.012]  Well, they've got most of what they want and it seems as if they don't need to bother with legislation if they don't get it.
[01:25:50.452 --> 01:26:01.460]  Because the whole idea of the enemy combatant was never in law when it was snapped on guys and they were just held without charges because they were classified as an enemy combatant.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.902]  But talking about the assault weapons ban and other gun control.
[01:26:05.422 --> 01:26:11.766]  Well, happily, there, I think we've still got the horses to hold them off.
[01:26:12.266 --> 01:26:19.110]  We've got a House of Representatives that is very staunch, and I just don't think they're going to be able to buffalo it through there.
[01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:21.852]  The biggest problem still could be the Senate.
[01:26:22.272 --> 01:26:32.959]  The Senate is a somewhat better body, and I don't think, with the presence of Dr. Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, they're going to be able to pull off as many things
[01:26:33.759 --> 01:26:54.793]  I'm thinking particularly of that train wreck that was allowed to occur back in March last year when the bill that was on the floor that was designed to stop these lawsuits being brought against the gun industry because a criminal does something with a gun not because the gun malfunctions.
[01:26:54.853 --> 01:27:00.497]  Well that's another thing is that Gonzales is going to control all the federal prosecutors and they've got the
[01:27:01.218 --> 01:27:04.460]  Well, the BATF is certainly not under control and they're now
[01:27:25.071 --> 01:27:31.315]  Technically under Gonzalez, because they're in the Justice Department, which is what he will be heading.
[01:27:32.136 --> 01:27:39.901]  And we just saw yesterday, I got a news item that a fellow by the name of Peterson was finally acquitted with a federal jury.
[01:27:40.241 --> 01:27:47.906]  The BATF had very overtly tried to set him up and make him into a criminal by
[01:27:49.182 --> 01:27:54.426]  I hate to even use the word entrapment because the man really didn't think he was doing anything wrong.
[01:27:54.766 --> 01:27:55.727]  He was keeping the law.
[01:27:55.787 --> 01:28:01.411]  It was the government that ran in people to buy things that weren't legal buyers, but they lied.
[01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:03.133]  Well, I know retired cops in Florida.
[01:28:03.173 --> 01:28:03.973]  I've seen the articles.
[01:28:04.013 --> 01:28:05.174]  Two cops on a gun shop.
[01:28:05.494 --> 01:28:07.856]  They send in agents with fake IDs.
[01:28:07.896 --> 01:28:08.517]  They scan them.
[01:28:08.537 --> 01:28:10.118]  They go through and the cops go to jail.
[01:28:10.338 --> 01:28:10.818]  How is that?
[01:28:11.079 --> 01:28:12.540]  And I use the example of the cops.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.041]  Does it even happen to, you know?
[01:28:14.321 --> 01:28:16.703]  It happens to anybody that's not BATF.
[01:28:19.665 --> 01:28:20.586]  How do they do that, though?
[01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:25.929]  How do they go in and get a gun illegally, when the system fails, and then you go to jail?
[01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:32.113]  That is a really good question, and it shows the system is out of control.
[01:28:32.633 --> 01:28:35.154]  Well, it's just not going to encourage us not to have gun shops.
[01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:38.977]  And Gonzales is certainly not likely to help restore that.
[01:28:39.277 --> 01:28:41.178]  We'll come back and take calls from Larry Fred.
[01:28:42.439 --> 01:28:43.319]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.461]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.361 --> 01:28:49.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.262 --> 01:28:55.946]  You've heard about PODS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[01:28:56.246 --> 01:29:00.531]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[01:29:00.771 --> 01:29:07.698]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:29:08.078 --> 01:29:14.729]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color plans.
[01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:18.514]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:29:18.534 --> 01:29:19.316]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit biowox.com.
[01:29:23.622 --> 01:29:30.784]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:29:30.845 --> 01:29:37.547]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:42.428]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[01:29:42.608 --> 01:29:45.149]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:29:45.309 --> 01:29:49.951]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[01:29:52.156 --> 01:29:57.379]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:57.519 --> 01:30:05.604]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:05.865 --> 01:30:12.909]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:14.370]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:20.354]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:20.534 --> 01:30:25.638]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:25.758 --> 01:30:34.624]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:34.884 --> 01:30:39.767]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[01:30:42.329 --> 01:30:43.171]  We're good to go.
[01:30:53.883 --> 01:30:59.368]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:59.808 --> 01:31:04.353]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:04.473 --> 01:31:11.299]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:17.785]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:17.925 --> 01:31:19.146]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:19.486 --> 01:31:22.429]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:24.592]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:24.932 --> 01:31:32.160]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.844]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:36.264 --> 01:31:39.408]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:31:39.428 --> 01:31:39.528]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:39.548 --> 01:31:39.728]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:39.768 --> 01:31:40.710]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.730 --> 01:31:40.930]  Call today.
[01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:10.876]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in just a moment.
[01:32:11.957 --> 01:32:22.625]  You know, Larry, one time I went to a party, and there were a couple of BATF guys there, and when I first saw them, it was a big, you know, party, upscale party.
[01:32:23.225 --> 01:32:26.808]  It was three of them, and when I first saw them there, I'm like, are those guys like criminals?
[01:32:27.805 --> 01:32:30.687]  Two of them had shaved heads, you know, with the weird mustaches.
[01:32:30.707 --> 01:32:32.388]  They were acting weird, aggressively.
[01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:33.309]  They were just there.
[01:32:33.569 --> 01:32:34.190]  They were drunk.
[01:32:35.371 --> 01:32:40.854]  And, you know, normally you go someplace or some event and you see cops who are there off-duty.
[01:32:40.874 --> 01:32:43.676]  They seem like nice guys, usually kind of reserved and friendly.
[01:32:44.297 --> 01:32:45.418]  Or, you know, you see firemen.
[01:32:45.438 --> 01:32:45.918]  They're nice.
[01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.780]  I've been at parties before where FBI agents are.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.642]  I went to school with an FBI agent's son in high school.
[01:32:51.662 --> 01:32:52.983]  I went to their house for dinner many times.
[01:32:53.023 --> 01:32:53.784]  He seemed pretty nice.
[01:32:54.324 --> 01:32:56.786]  But a BATF, the one time I was around them,
[01:32:57.541 --> 01:33:05.016]  One of these guys, let's just say he's a high-level agent here locally, really just, you know, the type of person on an alley at night you'd move away from.
[01:33:05.436 --> 01:33:08.222]  I'm not trying to be mean here, this is just my observation of them.
[01:33:09.301 --> 01:33:23.355]  Well, the bad apples tend to rise to the top, and that's been a severe problem for years and years and years within the BATF, even well before it came to the Justice Department.
[01:33:23.416 --> 01:33:32.204]  So it brings a culture of corruption at the top, and it's hard for a guy down the line, regardless of whether he and I would agree,
[01:33:32.925 --> 01:33:37.109]  That it's constitutional to have his job at the federal level at all.
[01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:39.852]  But nevertheless, there are guys that go into it.
[01:33:40.192 --> 01:33:41.713]  They have a, you know, they want to be a cop.
[01:33:41.753 --> 01:33:42.814]  They want to do a good job.
[01:33:43.515 --> 01:33:49.721]  And what they find out, that unless they're willing to cut corners, they're not getting to the top in the BATF.
[01:33:50.181 --> 01:33:58.269]  And a lot of them, I've talked to them, when they are trapped like this, they think, well, maybe I'll transfer to some other agency.
[01:33:59.289 --> 01:34:00.951]  Well, they're not going to get a good recommendation.
[01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:10.578]  They are literally trapped, and some of the most unhappy people in the world are those that have had a decent instinct, who ended up working at the BATF.
[01:34:11.038 --> 01:34:12.919]  Not a good place for decent people.
[01:34:13.079 --> 01:34:21.826]  Well, just to finish up with this, talking about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, very astute comment you just made, because I happened to have researched them.
[01:34:22.226 --> 01:34:26.469]  They were the classic, what people in the South and other areas call the regulators.
[01:34:27.176 --> 01:34:28.517]  And that's why they're so corrupt.
[01:34:28.637 --> 01:34:37.163]  They go back to the age of the literal private hired thugs by the federal government to go break the stills, shake the people down.
[01:34:37.224 --> 01:34:43.608]  They became armed criminal gangs that would rob families, go into farmhouses, just take money, nothing illegal found.
[01:34:43.628 --> 01:34:53.656]  And then really, it's the first real criminal federal agency, and then down through its whole history, you know, it was the first of the whiskey regulators, the whiskey tax men.
[01:34:54.456 --> 01:35:03.383]  And so you've had kind of this criminal element, this mafia element from the start, recruiting, recruiting, recruiting, and the tone got set for that agency in the beginning.
[01:35:04.003 --> 01:35:19.174]  And it is one of many examples that when you have law enforcement at the federal level, where it does not belong under our Constitution, you have something that's almost impossible to control, and accountability becomes something that
[01:35:19.594 --> 01:35:29.786]  Maybe is a word that some of them can spell if they happen to be good students but they don't know what it means and they certainly don't think it applies to them only to other people.
[01:35:31.227 --> 01:35:33.910]  Law enforcement is a function that is
[01:35:34.651 --> 01:35:37.535]  Delegated from average citizens.
[01:35:38.336 --> 01:35:43.883]  It's a job that we have decided we didn't want to do because it might have required too much time ourselves.
[01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:48.048]  And we delegated those powers, but we didn't give them up when we delegated them.
[01:35:48.108 --> 01:35:51.733]  And when we've given them to a federal agency, we in effect
[01:35:52.533 --> 01:35:54.314]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:35:54.354 --> 01:35:57.615]  Thanks very much for taking my call.
[01:35:57.735 --> 01:35:58.496]  A couple of three points.
[01:35:58.516 --> 01:36:00.796]  One for Mr. Pratt and then you, Alexander.
[01:36:00.956 --> 01:36:02.257]  First of all, Mr. Pratt, years ago I used to
[01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:19.870]  I think that gun control is a good thing.
[01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:22.851]  If you controlled all of our guns, crime would go down.
[01:36:23.591 --> 01:36:30.812]  But then I became a fan of the Alex Jones Show, and through a little research I've done on my own, I realized that that's a stupid opinion.
[01:36:30.912 --> 01:36:34.093]  Clearly when you start taking citizens' guns, people start dying.
[01:36:34.153 --> 01:36:39.354]  That's been proven historically, and it'll happen here if it's allowed to get to that point.
[01:36:39.374 --> 01:36:47.215]  With that as a backdrop, you're probably aware that in San Francisco, the city leaders want to put on... Yeah, speak up, Robert!
[01:36:47.722 --> 01:36:48.043]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:48.603 --> 01:36:49.204]  Go ahead.
[01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:57.354]  The city leaders in San Francisco want to put on a ballot a plan that if passed would outlaw handguns in San Francisco.
[01:36:58.146 --> 01:36:59.106]  What do you know about that?
[01:36:59.146 --> 01:36:59.926]  What's the status of that?
[01:36:59.986 --> 01:37:01.247]  Well, let's just throw this out here.
[01:37:01.267 --> 01:37:07.548]  We've got the so-called Republicans in New York passing a law and in court cases so they can sue gun manufacturers.
[01:37:07.828 --> 01:37:10.088]  And just one or two of these winning will shut us down, folks.
[01:37:10.128 --> 01:37:10.488]  It's over.
[01:37:10.508 --> 01:37:13.909]  I mean, it's just like there's no diving boards and swimming pools anymore.
[01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:15.149]  We're not going to have guns.
[01:37:15.209 --> 01:37:15.809]  We're going to lose.
[01:37:15.849 --> 01:37:16.469]  It's going to be over.
[01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:17.550]  Thanks to these people.
[01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:20.850]  And then in San Francisco, Larry, they're coming after the guns as well.
[01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:23.471]  Arnold Schwarzeneggers banning rifles left and right.
[01:37:23.891 --> 01:37:24.431]  Tell us about it.
[01:37:25.054 --> 01:37:37.123]  Well, the good news, at least in San Francisco, and there's certainly not much in San Francisco, they can pass all the referenda they want, the initiatives they want, they can have their city council pass all the laws they want.
[01:37:37.624 --> 01:37:42.968]  On the Second Amendment issue, on the gun issue, they're going to have to change the state law first.
[01:37:43.388 --> 01:37:49.670]  That law's already been tried in court and it's been upheld even by the nut cases in the California State Court.
[01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:53.751]  What do you think of Arnold banning 50 Cals and wanting to ban more now?
[01:37:53.771 --> 01:37:57.133]  And I see all these conservative groups endorsing him for president now, Larry.
[01:37:57.553 --> 01:38:04.615]  Well, we put out a news release indicating that Mr. Schwarzenegger apparently is a girly boy when it comes to guns.
[01:38:05.962 --> 01:38:13.472]  Well, he likes to show these violent images of what a tough guy he is, when in reality he throws fits if he doesn't get his pedicure every day, and that's mainstream news.
[01:38:13.492 --> 01:38:16.736]  You talk about a girly boy, he gets bikini waxing.
[01:38:17.297 --> 01:38:19.400]  I mean, he's a piece of trash.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.182]  Some foreigner wants my guns?
[01:38:21.502 --> 01:38:24.146]  He says, this guy's been on record for gun bans, Larry!
[01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:31.945]  He's very much a gun banner, gun controller, and he's a smart enough guy.
[01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:37.930]  I think he's got to know that his own country was ruled by gun controllers.
[01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:41.052]  Austria, after all, fell under the Nazis.
[01:38:41.152 --> 01:38:43.414]  Yeah, his daddy helped confiscate guns.
[01:38:43.434 --> 01:38:44.375]  He's a trash.
[01:38:44.575 --> 01:38:51.681]  You'd think that there might have been a lesson there if the man was really interested in freedom, but I don't think he got the lesson.
[01:38:51.881 --> 01:38:53.042]  I don't think he got the point.
[01:38:53.682 --> 01:39:00.090]  And we would be doing our... You know, with 280 million Americans, we don't have enough to choose from to be president.
[01:39:00.130 --> 01:39:02.733]  We gotta make Arnold Schwarzenegger president?
[01:39:02.974 --> 01:39:04.075]  I don't think so.
[01:39:04.676 --> 01:39:05.937]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[01:39:06.398 --> 01:39:08.020]  They're pushing big time, Larry, as you know.
[01:39:09.293 --> 01:39:11.255]  There's a major push on this.
[01:39:11.335 --> 01:39:14.959]  We think it's one of the worst ideas that's come down the pike.
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:20.164]  And certainly on the gun issue, the guy is all bad news.
[01:39:20.945 --> 01:39:27.091]  And why pro-lifers would want him, why pro-family people would want him... He's for open borders?
[01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:28.352]  I mean... Open borders.
[01:39:28.392 --> 01:39:30.334]  The first thing he did to solve the government's
[01:39:30.934 --> 01:39:38.537]  The financial crisis in California was to further indebt the state by some 16 billion dollars.
[01:39:38.677 --> 01:39:39.918]  Oh, but he's wonderful.
[01:39:40.138 --> 01:39:41.499]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:39:41.599 --> 01:39:42.899]  Ron, you're on the air with Larry Pratt.
[01:39:42.919 --> 01:39:43.279]  Go ahead.
[01:39:43.459 --> 01:39:44.100]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:58.546]  The reason why you have so-called conservatives that'll call you a liberal being against gun control or Arnold Schwarzenegger or whatever the case is is because you have people who are politically unsophisticated, uninformed, and ignorant
[01:39:59.008 --> 01:39:59.468]  We're good to go.
[01:40:20.031 --> 01:40:22.314]  Which is detrimental to their own social interests.
[01:40:22.354 --> 01:40:24.496]  You know, actually, I think that's a very good point.
[01:40:24.556 --> 01:40:39.094]  There are people who would rather not know about these issues that we're talking about, where the Republicans have made their serious mistakes, because, at least in their own mind, they're part of the
[01:40:39.994 --> 01:40:42.336]  And that kind of conduct is usually exhibited by ignorant people.
[01:40:59.865 --> 01:41:06.671]  Listen, I tried to get involved with the Republican Party ten years ago, and you go to the meetings and I found the Democrats are just taking it over here in Austin.
[01:41:06.691 --> 01:41:17.041]  I mean, really, the chairman and people were just, actually, were real live Democrats, and if you brought up real issues, they'd turn their back, they'd laugh at you, they'd walk away, and then all the little camp followers would do the same thing.
[01:41:17.221 --> 01:41:22.986]  Alex, you once said in a broadcast, and this is a very, very good example, and I've never forgotten it, all these years later,
[01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:29.061]  It's like being in a car with Ted Bundy, you know, and you think, yeah, me and him are, you know, out to do something.
[01:41:29.101 --> 01:41:33.605]  In fact, you know, Ted is not out to do nothing with you, but take you down with the rest.
[01:41:34.086 --> 01:41:35.106]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:41:35.907 --> 01:41:38.930]  It's the sign of lesser people who are inferior.
[01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:40.711]  Maybe their lives are insignificant.
[01:41:41.091 --> 01:41:42.993]  They suffer in desperate silence.
[01:41:43.073 --> 01:41:43.573]  Who knows?
[01:41:43.633 --> 01:41:45.055]  Flipping burgers, whatever it is.
[01:41:45.755 --> 01:41:46.896]  It's just the truth of the matter.
[01:41:46.936 --> 01:41:48.597]  It's the psychology of the situation.
[01:41:49.078 --> 01:41:52.741]  As for the Attorney General Designate, who has now been nominated Attorney General,
[01:41:53.243 --> 01:42:04.207]  Listen guys, we like to be diplomatic as gentlemen, but there comes a point in which I guess one should not withhold or spare any verbal blows about what this man is.
[01:42:04.887 --> 01:42:09.868]  A man who openly pontificates about the things that he has pontificated on.
[01:42:10.309 --> 01:42:10.809]  Torture.
[01:42:11.429 --> 01:42:14.170]  Dismembering bodies and finding that acceptable.
[01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:17.351]  Seeing the presidency as an imperial presidency.
[01:42:18.231 --> 01:42:20.872]  Belonging to a race supremist group.
[01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:24.131]  This isn't just a guy who's a little off base.
[01:42:24.191 --> 01:42:28.453]  This is a guy who, at worst, is demonic, or who, at best, is demented.
[01:42:29.033 --> 01:42:32.155]  This guy is wholly unacceptable as a person, let alone as a general.
[01:42:32.175 --> 01:42:32.635]  No, I hear you, Ron.
[01:42:32.735 --> 01:42:38.097]  I've got to let you go, and let Larry Pratt have final comments here in the next 60 seconds.
[01:42:38.157 --> 01:42:38.437]  Larry?
[01:42:40.633 --> 01:42:43.255]  We do want to make some trouble for the president.
[01:42:43.315 --> 01:42:47.718]  I think he needs to hear from us that we're not all just peachy happy with everything that he's done.
[01:42:47.758 --> 01:42:54.882]  And if folks would like to go to GunOwners.org, that's the website for Gun Owners of America, go to GunOwners.org.
[01:42:54.902 --> 01:43:01.206]  You can find the email there to send off to the White House and register your protest.
[01:43:01.486 --> 01:43:03.567]  Don't let the silence be complete.
[01:43:03.808 --> 01:43:07.630]  And also call your congressmen and women and go, what is your malfunction?
[01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:12.831]  Gunowners.org and give folks that phone number.
[01:43:13.472 --> 01:43:16.393]  If they can't get us on the web, call toll-free.
[01:43:16.413 --> 01:43:22.436]  888-886-GUNS.
[01:43:22.937 --> 01:43:26.118]  Larry, thanks for working so hard for the Second Amendment as a fellow liberal.
[01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:30.724]  And, uh, you know, something's wrong with us.
[01:43:30.744 --> 01:43:31.905]  We're against torturing people.
[01:43:32.385 --> 01:43:33.967]  But, uh, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:43:33.987 --> 01:43:36.329]  I appreciate you coming on on such short notice, and God bless.
[01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:37.810]  Well, let's keep our guns.
[01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.512]  Thanks so much for what you're doing, Alex.
[01:43:39.712 --> 01:43:40.453]  Take care, my friend.
[01:43:41.033 --> 01:43:42.355]  There goes Larry Pratt, folks.
[01:43:42.775 --> 01:43:44.637]  Uh, I'm just disgusted by all of it.
[01:43:44.717 --> 01:43:49.201]  I mean, yeah, he's Alberto Gonzales, the president's above the law.
[01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:51.724]  We can torture people unto death, and it's not torture.
[01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:55.992]  You know, I'm a member of a group that says, kill all white people.
[01:43:56.012 --> 01:43:56.892]  I mean, literally.
[01:43:57.812 --> 01:43:59.733]  It's Twilight Zone.
[01:43:59.793 --> 01:44:00.793]  And Arnold, you heard him.
[01:44:01.213 --> 01:44:04.174]  Very proud about Arnold, and he's for banning guns.
[01:44:04.274 --> 01:44:04.674]  Period.
[01:44:06.495 --> 01:44:11.596]  And, you know, Newsmax is out endorsing him, and Limbaugh's out endorsing him, and Sean Hannity's out endorsing him.
[01:44:11.636 --> 01:44:13.796]  And why do we support any of these groups?
[01:44:14.217 --> 01:44:16.897]  The liberals are winning, folks, because they became conservatives.
[01:44:17.337 --> 01:44:18.038]  And fooled you!
[01:44:18.858 --> 01:44:19.438]  It's sick!
[01:44:20.606 --> 01:44:21.526]  It's so sick!
[01:44:21.566 --> 01:44:26.187]  We're going to lose this country because of you, the so-called conservatives that are listening, who don't get it.
[01:44:27.548 --> 01:44:29.268]  Let's talk to Ron in New Mexico.
[01:44:29.368 --> 01:44:30.148]  Ron, thanks for holding.
[01:44:30.188 --> 01:44:30.608]  Go ahead.
[01:44:31.008 --> 01:44:32.209]  Yeah, Alex, I was wondering.
[01:44:32.249 --> 01:44:35.450]  Your caller the other day mentioned the Atlantic Monthly.
[01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.210]  Did you happen to pick up a copy of that?
[01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.790]  Because I did, and it's amazing.
[01:44:39.931 --> 01:44:40.371]  No, I didn't.
[01:44:40.391 --> 01:44:45.992]  The caller talked about how we're going to have martial law and the terrorists will attack us and give up all our freedoms.
[01:44:46.292 --> 01:44:47.112]  That's what she said.
[01:44:47.832 --> 01:44:48.433]  I didn't read it.
[01:44:48.753 --> 01:44:49.213]  Yeah, it's...
[01:44:51.136 --> 01:44:53.497]  Well, I guessed what was in the article before she even read it.
[01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:54.237]  I mean, it's not hard.
[01:44:54.257 --> 01:44:56.697]  They're constantly putting out their fear-mongering reports.
[01:44:57.137 --> 01:45:04.719]  Yeah, I highly suggest you pick it up and maybe include it in a future broadcast or documentary.
[01:45:04.739 --> 01:45:05.739]  Well, mail me a copy.
[01:45:06.419 --> 01:45:07.039]  I have it right here.
[01:45:07.059 --> 01:45:08.819]  I bought two, so one's going out in the mail.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.060]  I'm waiting for the mail guy, actually.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:16.281]  Yeah, the only place in town that has all the publications is also a porno place.
[01:45:17.256 --> 01:45:21.699]  You know, one half of it's all the newspapers, the other half's porno, and I don't like going in there.
[01:45:21.739 --> 01:45:25.602]  Occasionally I have to to get a magazine or newspaper that's not, it's called, news.
[01:45:26.342 --> 01:45:28.124]  Then every time I go in there, someone's like, what are you doing?
[01:45:28.164 --> 01:45:30.525]  You know, oh, you're getting, you know, this magazine I'm in.
[01:45:31.366 --> 01:45:38.070]  But if you want me to get that, because I've called around, the only place they have it is there, then you're welcome to mail it to me.
[01:45:38.531 --> 01:45:39.011]  Okay, great.
[01:45:39.471 --> 01:45:39.752]  Alright.
[01:45:39.932 --> 01:45:40.272]  That's it.
[01:45:40.312 --> 01:45:40.792]  Thank you, sir.
[01:45:41.153 --> 01:45:42.934]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:45:44.036 --> 01:45:46.898]  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting little store.
[01:45:46.958 --> 01:45:51.421]  It's got almost every magazine and newspaper you can imagine in like two-thirds of the store.
[01:45:51.441 --> 01:45:53.922]  And then the other part is the porno stuff.
[01:45:54.843 --> 01:45:55.703]  I'm a public figure.
[01:45:55.743 --> 01:45:57.804]  I don't particularly like prancing around in there.
[01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:01.927]  And I have gone in there before to get magazines and newspapers you can't get anywhere else.
[01:46:04.813 --> 01:46:06.113]  You know, in the Washington Post.
[01:46:06.133 --> 01:46:08.174]  Well, they don't have the Washington Post anywhere in town.
[01:46:08.674 --> 01:46:16.176]  Sometimes it's at Barnes & Noble, or you're in this magazine, you're in this newspaper, or you're in the New American, or you're in the... it's the only place they got it in town.
[01:46:16.576 --> 01:46:17.156]  It's weird.
[01:46:18.196 --> 01:46:23.238]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here?
[01:46:25.098 --> 01:46:25.918]  Who's up next?
[01:46:26.599 --> 01:46:27.419]  Gail in Texas.
[01:46:27.439 --> 01:46:27.859]  Go ahead.
[01:46:27.899 --> 01:46:28.219]  Welcome.
[01:46:29.028 --> 01:46:30.429]  Hola Alex, how are you?
[01:46:30.509 --> 01:46:34.131]  I'm calling to congratulate you on speaking up against Gonzales.
[01:46:34.812 --> 01:46:36.773]  Well, I'm an evil liberal.
[01:46:37.954 --> 01:46:39.495]  Well, then so am I, I guess.
[01:46:40.475 --> 01:46:42.016]  An evil Hispanic liberal.
[01:46:42.377 --> 01:46:46.519]  And I wanted to tell you that there are lots of Hispanics that do not support Gonzales.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:53.244]  And one group is the League of United Latin American... Oh, I'm sorry, not them.
[01:46:53.584 --> 01:46:58.167]  The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, MALDEF.
[01:46:58.737 --> 01:46:59.497]  Have you heard of them?
[01:46:59.678 --> 01:47:01.619]  Yes, I know there's a lot of groups that are against him.
[01:47:01.759 --> 01:47:08.503]  Right, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote a letter yesterday to Bill Frist stating that it would not endorse Gonzalez.
[01:47:09.472 --> 01:47:11.833]  So you've got Hispanic groups not endorsing him?
[01:47:11.853 --> 01:47:12.793]  Oh, that's correct.
[01:47:12.933 --> 01:47:13.653]  Absolutely.
[01:47:13.713 --> 01:47:14.833]  I was aware that some weren't.
[01:47:14.873 --> 01:47:23.895]  I mean, but I've found Hispanics, frankly, of any group per capita, the biggest listeners of this show, are the most conservative people per capita that I've found.
[01:47:24.575 --> 01:47:26.296]  And, yeah, they don't like Gonzales.
[01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:26.836]  Oh, no.
[01:47:28.516 --> 01:47:30.337]  It isn't even about him being Hispanic.
[01:47:30.637 --> 01:47:30.857]  No, it's not.
[01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:32.437]  They try to make that the issue.
[01:47:32.537 --> 01:47:32.797]  Right.
[01:47:33.217 --> 01:47:35.938]  I mean, he's a demonic Cenobite.
[01:47:36.641 --> 01:47:36.901]  Right.
[01:47:37.042 --> 01:47:40.666]  And Orrin Hatch came out and warned all the Democrats.
[01:47:40.726 --> 01:47:45.692]  Every Hispanic family in America was watching how Gonzalez was going to be treated by the committee.
[01:47:46.053 --> 01:47:47.174]  And yeah, we are watching.
[01:47:47.575 --> 01:47:50.899]  We are watching how he's being used by the Republicans.
[01:47:50.979 --> 01:47:53.142]  We are watching how he's being pushed through.
[01:47:54.012 --> 01:48:00.276]  Um, just based on the fact that he is Hispanic and how he's this totally unwholesome.
[01:48:00.537 --> 01:48:02.238]  Well, I don't think it's just that he's Hispanic.
[01:48:02.278 --> 01:48:02.978]  He's evil.
[01:48:02.998 --> 01:48:03.599]  He is.
[01:48:03.659 --> 01:48:11.604]  Like Chertoff and Bush and Rice and Rumsfeld, this collection of psychopaths.
[01:48:12.324 --> 01:48:12.865]  He is.
[01:48:13.045 --> 01:48:17.468]  He's a horrible person and for somebody to actually contemplate
[01:48:18.408 --> 01:48:25.770]  Um, the torture of another human being is just the worst, most unfathomable type of- But then he says we define reality, right?
[01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:26.550]  I said this too.
[01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:32.191]  We can torture someone to organ failure and death, and if we didn't mean for them to die, it's not torture.
[01:48:32.751 --> 01:48:36.792]  Well, I'm sorry, but I disagree, and a lot of people out there disagree.
[01:48:36.812 --> 01:48:40.613]  Well, what's wrong with talking about cutting somebody's wife's fingers off in front of them?
[01:48:41.633 --> 01:48:41.873]  No.
[01:48:41.893 --> 01:48:44.554]  I mean, what's wrong with- the caller mentioned Ted Bundy earlier.
[01:48:44.574 --> 01:48:46.254]  Maybe Ted Bundy should be our Attorney General.
[01:48:47.393 --> 01:48:50.355]  And the amazing thing, Alex, is that... Oh, I'm against white people.
[01:48:50.415 --> 01:48:51.577]  I've talked bad about Ted Bundy.
[01:48:52.878 --> 01:48:53.058]  Oh, no.
[01:48:53.258 --> 01:48:54.660]  Finish up what you were saying.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:55.040]  Sorry.
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:03.608]  The amazing thing, Alex, is that half the country thinks that these people are religious and they're good people.
[01:49:03.828 --> 01:49:05.030]  And I just don't get that.
[01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:08.013]  That just totally goes above my head.
[01:49:08.053 --> 01:49:09.754]  I just can't get it.
[01:49:09.914 --> 01:49:10.415]  I don't get it.
[01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:24.498]  It's amazing, and the Democratic Party's faking over, the Republican Party's faking over, and if we as Americans don't get past what color we are and where we're from and start getting back to defending liberty, it's over.
[01:49:25.979 --> 01:49:29.162]  And you'll have a pack of criminals, regardless of what color they are, ruling us.
[01:49:29.982 --> 01:49:30.843]  Great points, Gail.
[01:49:32.084 --> 01:49:33.645]  I appreciate your call, my dear.
[01:49:34.272 --> 01:49:35.053]  Good to hear from you.
[01:49:35.533 --> 01:49:38.175]  Alright, we'll come back and talk to Tony and others.
[01:49:38.195 --> 01:49:38.895]  1-800-255-99231.
[01:49:38.915 --> 01:49:43.479]  A ton of news, wide open phones.
[01:49:43.919 --> 01:49:46.561]  For the rest of the broadcast, presentplanet.tv is the website.
[01:49:47.061 --> 01:49:50.124]  I'll talk about 10-year-olds being charged as terrorists.
[01:49:53.086 --> 01:49:55.968]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:56.676 --> 01:49:57.977]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:58.177 --> 01:50:03.920]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[01:52:56.147 --> 01:52:57.688]  This show is documented.
[01:52:58.189 --> 01:53:06.075]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.095 --> 01:53:06.375]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:06.395 --> 01:53:10.539]  This is a toll-free number to join us.
[01:53:10.559 --> 01:53:12.620]  Wide open phones in the next hour.
[01:53:13.541 --> 01:53:18.185]  As I said, I'm going to get into all these claims of global warming and what's really behind that.
[01:53:18.205 --> 01:53:20.907]  I want to get into Bush-ass patients from the U.S.
[01:53:20.967 --> 01:53:21.628]  on Iraq War.
[01:53:22.535 --> 01:53:27.059]  And I want to get into, well, 10-year-olds being arrested as terrorists for drawing stick figures with daggers.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:34.385]  So all part of the new freedom, being arrested for anti-Bush, or being threatened with arrest for anti-Bush stickers.
[01:53:35.145 --> 01:53:37.948]  China's economy grows at 9.5%, our economy grows at 3%.
[01:53:38.448 --> 01:53:41.791]  And you count inflation in, that's no growth at all.
[01:53:43.012 --> 01:53:44.833]  So, that's all coming up as well.
[01:53:44.873 --> 01:53:50.338]  Before we go back to your calls to Jack and Tommy and everybody else who's patiently holding,
[01:53:51.101 --> 01:53:52.081]  Listen, it's simple.
[01:53:52.141 --> 01:53:54.242]  You want to wake people up, videos do it.
[01:53:54.902 --> 01:53:57.463]  You can talk to people, give them news articles, give them documents.
[01:53:57.863 --> 01:54:00.644]  When they see Andy Rooney saying everybody needs a chip.
[01:54:01.724 --> 01:54:04.525]  When they see FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists.
[01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:15.488]  When they see the police finding a Patriot Games film with Harrison Ford, one of my videos, and a Constitution, and saying this may be illegal at a roadside checkpoint from their own squad car.
[01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:19.558]  Well, that's about eight, nine minutes of what's in the two-and-a-half-hour, three-hour film.
[01:54:19.879 --> 01:54:21.760]  Two-and-a-half-hour VHS, three-hour DVD.
[01:54:22.861 --> 01:54:24.163]  You know, that's just one of my films.
[01:54:24.183 --> 01:54:25.264]  It's a few minutes of that film.
[01:54:25.444 --> 01:54:26.665]  I cannot describe what's in them.
[01:54:26.965 --> 01:54:27.966]  I cannot cover it all.
[01:54:28.286 --> 01:54:30.789]  One must see The Matrix to understand it.
[01:54:30.869 --> 01:54:32.370]  One cannot be told about The Matrix.
[01:54:33.091 --> 01:54:36.554]  You need to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:36.934 --> 01:54:39.737]  We got insane deals as low as $5.95 per film right now.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:46.124]  You need to take advantage of this and make copies of them and get them out to people, and it makes this broadcast possible.
[01:54:46.564 --> 01:54:50.827]  Allows me to pay my small staff and maybe hire more people, do a better job.
[01:54:52.148 --> 01:54:55.011]  I'm still at the level of carrying out the trash myself and putting light bulbs in.
[01:54:55.891 --> 01:54:58.133]  You know, and I could do better, more important things.
[01:54:58.593 --> 01:54:59.394]  We need your support.
[01:54:59.834 --> 01:55:02.176]  Toll-free number to order the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:08.999 --> 01:55:11.621]  Triple 8, 253-3139.

[01:55:16.944 --> 01:55:17.905]  No obligation to buy.
[01:55:18.305 --> 01:55:20.286]  The operator group I've had for six, seven years.
[01:55:21.607 --> 01:55:22.568]  I wish they were pushy.
[01:55:22.608 --> 01:55:23.028]  They're not.
[01:55:23.248 --> 01:55:24.449]  In fact, you'll have to...
[01:55:25.535 --> 01:55:27.537]  Really beg them to take the order.
[01:55:27.557 --> 01:55:27.977]  I'm joking.
[01:55:28.317 --> 01:55:29.798]  The point is, they're great folks.
[01:55:29.818 --> 01:55:30.699]  They'll answer your questions.
[01:55:30.739 --> 01:55:33.421]  No pressure to buy anything.
[01:55:33.441 --> 01:55:38.825]  888-253-3139 or Infowars.com to order via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart.

[01:55:58.375 --> 01:55:59.315]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:00.295 --> 01:56:02.496]  Good old Jack Bloods, Connecticut talk show host.
[01:56:02.556 --> 01:56:05.897]  I want to hold you a little bit over into the next hour if we can, Jack, and take some calls.
[01:56:06.298 --> 01:56:07.958]  But you're calling in, and I'm glad you called.
[01:56:08.018 --> 01:56:13.400]  One of the things in my stack is the commemorative Glock New World Order pistols, handguns.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:18.822]  Hundreds of them handed out to our gracious leaders after the end of Desert Dust 1, Jack.
[01:56:19.628 --> 01:56:20.869]  Yeah, well, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:56:20.909 --> 01:56:21.949]  You're doing a great job.
[01:56:22.009 --> 01:56:25.411]  And since you were talking with Larry Pratt, I thought this might be apropos.
[01:56:25.591 --> 01:56:28.013]  But yeah, there were a thousand of these Glock 17s made.
[01:56:28.053 --> 01:56:29.513]  They had a special engraving on it.
[01:56:30.674 --> 01:56:41.320]  The, I guess, recipients are George W. Bush, Schwarzkopf, James Baker III, Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Brent Scowcroft, and a list of CENTCOM guys.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.703]  But on one side of the gun, this is a commemorative, says, New World Order commemorative.
[01:56:47.043 --> 01:56:52.267]  So this is a New World Order commemorative for the... Well, we've got a picture of the gun at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:56:52.607 --> 01:56:54.969]  Yeah, we've got it listed at JackBlood.com as well.
[01:56:55.289 --> 01:57:02.935]  But, I mean, here we're always hearing there's no New World Order, you know, we're just making this up, and here this is what they put on this gun.
[01:57:02.955 --> 01:57:05.817]  I mean, it's right in our face, and I thought it was rather offensive.
[01:57:07.038 --> 01:57:11.421]  Well, a New World Order means total loss of liberty, world government, world taxation.
[01:57:12.094 --> 01:57:13.235]  End of the Second Amendment.
[01:57:13.735 --> 01:57:26.042]  Yeah, I mean, you can just see George Bush and others handling this gun, just kind of drooling, and they just love this kind of stuff, but they've got to put their name on it, and the name is New World Order, so.
[01:57:26.102 --> 01:57:28.483]  I'll tell you what, Jack, stay there, we'll go into the next hour.
[01:57:28.843 --> 01:57:34.006]  You know, I would add to this, imagine Gonzalez wants to get to our guns, and then scrap us down, and, you know, torture us.
[01:57:34.746 --> 01:57:36.827]  That's why he wants your guns, and I'm serious when I say that.
[01:57:36.847 --> 01:57:38.788]  They want your guns so they can torture and kill you.
[01:57:39.089 --> 01:57:39.789]  It'll be right back.
[01:57:48.641 --> 01:57:49.302]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.942 --> 01:57:51.023]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.723 --> 01:57:52.864]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.465 --> 01:57:54.345]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.046 --> 01:57:55.926]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.627 --> 01:58:00.270]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.810 --> 01:58:04.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.802 --> 01:58:15.864]  We had the Spy Chief of the KGB on in the first hour, then we had Larry Pratt on about Alberto Gonzales wants your guns, and you're liberal if you're against gun control now.
[01:58:16.364 --> 01:58:18.344]  So I'm a communist, folks, if that's the case.
[01:58:18.865 --> 01:58:20.585]  If you're anti-communist, you're communist.
[01:58:20.805 --> 01:58:24.006]  If you're pro-gun, you're liberal.
[01:58:24.546 --> 01:58:26.866]  And then we got Jack Blood, talk show host, calling in.
[01:58:26.886 --> 01:58:27.527]  I don't like having him on.
[01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:33.648]  This is going to leave in a minute, but we're about to then go to... Who's up first from Arkansas?
[01:58:35.871 --> 01:58:36.671]  He just told me that.
[01:58:36.891 --> 01:58:39.152]  They're up in Minnesota, folks, and I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:58:39.392 --> 01:58:44.034]  They could type it over the computer to me, who the guests are, but they would always write it down and then can't read my own writing.
[01:58:44.474 --> 01:58:48.236]  So, Tony and John and Paul and Jim, we'll get to all your calls.
[01:58:48.616 --> 01:58:54.598]  But, Jack Blatt, you called in talking about this New World Order commemorative Glock that they gave to George Herbert Walker Bush and others.
[01:58:55.514 --> 01:58:56.395]  Yeah, it's a souvenir.
[01:58:56.515 --> 01:59:00.077]  Just a nice little souvenir after all the death and destruction they caused over there.
[01:59:00.137 --> 01:59:04.139]  I mean, it makes you think, you know, what they're getting, what kind of souvenirs they're getting out of this war.
[01:59:04.179 --> 01:59:13.865]  Of course, we know that they ransacked the museums in Babylon and Baghdad, so I'm sure they have, you know, vases and various and sundry items that are thousands of years old.
[01:59:13.925 --> 01:59:16.807]  Maybe they've inscribed New World Order commemorative on those, too.
[01:59:17.507 --> 01:59:21.348]  This also says Operation Desert Storm and it gives the date and everything.
[01:59:21.448 --> 01:59:28.511]  They made a thousand of these and gave them to all the people who had done such a good job in getting Saddam Hussein in 1991.
[01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:31.332]  Well isn't that just darling?
[01:59:31.452 --> 01:59:34.093]  A little PR move for them.
[01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:37.394]  But notice the establishment, it's good when they have guns.
[01:59:37.774 --> 01:59:40.215]  It's just bad when we the slaves have guns.
[01:59:40.925 --> 01:59:43.108]  What do you think about Alberto Gonzales saying...
[01:59:56.905 --> 02:00:01.288]  His origins, you know, I've verified his name does in fact mean devil or the damned.
[02:00:01.368 --> 02:00:03.770]  I mean, this is the guy you want running your homeland security.
[02:00:04.110 --> 02:00:11.255]  All of these guys like Marcus Wolf and Primakov and others that are assisting this guy to turn this into a total and complete police state.
[02:00:11.615 --> 02:00:13.576]  Of course, George W. Bush gives the speech.
[02:00:13.616 --> 02:00:14.177]  He's going to
[02:00:14.517 --> 02:00:16.179]  He's going to eliminate tyranny around the world.
[02:00:16.219 --> 02:00:21.945]  He's going to spread democracy around the world like some bad can of spam or something.
[02:00:22.525 --> 02:00:24.247]  Force it on the people by a gun.
[02:00:24.547 --> 02:00:30.253]  And all the top consultants, the ones that aren't locked into this New World Order have said, this is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:00:30.273 --> 02:00:31.434]  This is never going to work.
[02:00:31.815 --> 02:00:34.778]  And I had a four-star general on yesterday from CENTCOM.
[02:00:34.798 --> 02:00:37.621]  He was Tony Frank's right-hand man, General DeLong.
[02:00:38.241 --> 02:00:43.764]  And I asked him about, you know, the quotes from other generals I've interviewed that said, we're creating terrorists faster than we can kill them.
[02:00:44.005 --> 02:00:49.107]  And he starts talking to me about, well, those Muslims are having a lot of babies, and if that's what you mean.
[02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:57.092]  And he was getting a really weird tone in his voice, like he was fantasizing about killing all these Muslim children that could end up being terrorists.
[02:00:57.132 --> 02:00:58.633]  That's how they fight terrorism, Alex.
[02:00:59.219 --> 02:00:59.920]  Oh, I've heard that.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:00.740]  There's too many of them.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:01.641]  We've got to get rid of them.
[02:01:02.341 --> 02:01:06.504]  And did you mention, hey, Tommy Frank says Marshall Law's coming in the next attack.
[02:01:06.785 --> 02:01:07.565]  What did he say to that?
[02:01:07.665 --> 02:01:09.327]  Yeah, he denied that.
[02:01:09.827 --> 02:01:11.588]  He denied, but he gave the interview.
[02:01:11.608 --> 02:01:16.532]  And he also said it on Fox TV, but he first said it in Cigar Aficionado.
[02:01:16.672 --> 02:01:17.953]  He couldn't deny the interview.
[02:01:17.973 --> 02:01:18.813]  I mean, this is something.
[02:01:18.833 --> 02:01:23.157]  This was a big slip that Tommy Frank did in that Cigar Aficionado interview.
[02:01:23.897 --> 02:01:28.760]  Everybody I've interviewed and talked to about that, including Oliver North, denied it and tried to downplay it.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.701]  So, that was a real leak.
[02:01:30.721 --> 02:01:31.962]  They didn't like that coming out.
[02:01:31.982 --> 02:01:38.225]  And this General DeLong, of course, tried to cover up for it, saying that it would have to take extreme instances for this to happen.
[02:01:38.265 --> 02:01:44.188]  But look, I mean, you had state of emergency declared for one inch of ice in South Carolina two weeks ago.
[02:01:44.208 --> 02:01:48.831]  Look, look, we're already in an emergency when the Supreme Court says there's no more Fourth Amendment.
[02:01:49.719 --> 02:01:54.482]  I mean, when the police are running around in black ski masks calling us civilians, that's a martial law.
[02:01:54.502 --> 02:02:01.166]  You know, it's like we're in a pot on the stove with it set at, you know, number 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.
[02:02:01.886 --> 02:02:09.131]  And don't draw any violent cartoons or sketchings or doodles if you're a little kid, because you could be locked in jail.
[02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:13.033]  Let me ask you, when I was in school, that's all we, all the boys did.
[02:02:13.834 --> 02:02:14.494]  Did you do that?
[02:02:15.415 --> 02:02:18.897]  Of course I did, and there are plenty of, you know, Mad Magazine does it.
[02:02:18.997 --> 02:02:19.337]  Come on.
[02:02:20.126 --> 02:02:22.047]  But I mean, that's what boys drew.
[02:02:23.108 --> 02:02:26.069]  And I've seen my dad's artwork, I've seen my uncle's artwork, that's what they drew.
[02:02:26.129 --> 02:02:28.010]  I mean, that's a thought crime, pure and simple.
[02:02:28.831 --> 02:02:29.831]  I should go to prison, then.
[02:02:29.911 --> 02:02:34.914]  I mean, I... I drew pictures... Well, destroy all those pictures if you still have them.
[02:02:34.954 --> 02:02:35.994]  Those could be used against you.
[02:02:36.455 --> 02:02:36.535]  Ah.
[02:02:37.275 --> 02:02:39.316]  Alright, but I can play violent video games, though, if I want.
[02:02:39.916 --> 02:02:40.617]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.657 --> 02:02:41.097]  Thanks, Jack.

[02:06:16.782 --> 02:06:18.965]  Let's go ahead and go straight to your calls.
[02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:22.992]  Up first here.
[02:06:24.105 --> 02:06:25.366]  It's Tony in Arkansas.
[02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:26.186]  Tony, go ahead.
[02:06:26.206 --> 02:06:26.807]  You're on the air.
[02:06:27.147 --> 02:06:27.987]  Alex, hi.
[02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.288]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[02:06:29.308 --> 02:06:30.609]  An honor to talk to you, my friend.
[02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.969]  Go ahead.
[02:06:30.989 --> 02:06:31.349]  Thank you.
[02:06:31.369 --> 02:06:31.949]  God bless you.
[02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:36.672]  Listen, before I get to my main point, just a real quick sidebar on Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:06:37.392 --> 02:06:42.655]  Since Bush seems to be big on outsourcing jobs, I think we ought to start using the term he's outsourcing the presidency.
[02:06:42.835 --> 02:06:45.797]  We can't trust Americans to actually run our own country anymore.
[02:06:46.217 --> 02:06:46.817]  Well, that's it.
[02:06:46.877 --> 02:06:48.338]  That's a good point.
[02:06:48.478 --> 02:06:49.999]  Outsourcing the presidency.
[02:06:51.279 --> 02:07:00.064]  Actually, I lived for years and worked and was born, actually, in Las Vegas, Nevada, just about a year and a half ago, because I felt the Lord wanted me to move away from there.
[02:07:00.124 --> 02:07:11.751]  But I have friends that work both out of Area 51 and Nellis in the military, and they will tell you, I caught your rebroadcast last night, and it's kind of dealing with you talking with the Colonel yesterday.
[02:07:12.552 --> 02:07:18.716]  There are not only NORTHCOM things going on out there, but there are German troops by the
[02:07:19.565 --> 02:07:26.549]  My friend who is a guard there, they've since moved him to Texas and he's now at Vandenberg in California because they're so short of personnel.
[02:07:28.409 --> 02:07:32.632]  He was there for about five months as a guard and worked on the base.
[02:07:32.692 --> 02:07:36.053]  I got to go on board with him and he got some of these shots on his cell phone.
[02:07:36.073 --> 02:07:37.334]  You know how you can snap a picture.
[02:07:37.854 --> 02:07:40.596]  They had brought the F-117A back up to Vegas.
[02:07:40.876 --> 02:07:45.338]  It was supposed to be in New Mexico and this was right around the time of the Gulf War, a little after it.
[02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:49.574]  He came to me and he said, you know, it's funny, the Germans are jealous of the technology we have.
[02:07:49.594 --> 02:07:50.515]  And I said, Germans?
[02:07:50.575 --> 02:07:54.540]  You know, he wasn't up on, he goes to a Bible study group, but he wasn't up on any of the things you cover.
[02:07:54.981 --> 02:07:59.005]  And I only discovered you, thank God, through George Nury, and getting on the internet listening to you.
[02:07:59.286 --> 02:08:01.668]  But he came to me and said that, and I'm like, what are you talking about?
[02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:06.234]  And then he showed me his pictures on his cell phone, the Germans all over our equipment there on Nellis.
[02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:12.194]  And, uh, they were being trained how to fly the F-117A being shown, and he said, you know, they're jealous because they got nothing like that.
[02:08:12.214 --> 02:08:15.995]  And I'm like, dude, why do they have German troops on our stuff?
[02:08:16.315 --> 02:08:18.716]  And it turned out later, he said there were scores.
[02:08:18.736 --> 02:08:20.056]  He couldn't get a figure.
[02:08:20.496 --> 02:08:22.457]  And he talked to his CO and said, why are they here?
[02:08:22.517 --> 02:08:25.978]  American citizens can't get anywhere near those stealth aircraft.
[02:08:26.478 --> 02:08:35.141]  Well, number one, from Alamogordo in New Mexico, uh, to the bases you were just mentioning, Grim Lake and others, uh, in Nevada, it's Germans.
[02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:36.122]  Yeah, amazing.
[02:08:36.182 --> 02:08:40.645]  And then you get into Mississippi, Louisiana, it's Russians and Czech Republic and Ukrainians.
[02:08:41.506 --> 02:08:43.107]  You get up into the Michigan area.
[02:08:43.187 --> 02:08:44.768]  In Mexico, it's Chinese cribs.
[02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:46.169]  I mean, this is public.
[02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:52.575]  Well, and they wore these black uniforms with their German insignia, but below it was a different insignia that he did not recognize.
[02:08:52.635 --> 02:08:53.615]  And we talked to his CO.
[02:08:53.635 --> 02:08:56.077]  The CO told him, you know, well, he didn't know.
[02:08:56.177 --> 02:08:59.900]  So he went to, I guess, his company commander, and he told him they were there for an air show.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:01.862]  And a year later, they're still there, you know.
[02:09:02.447 --> 02:09:12.570]  And they kept to themselves, he said they spoke German, and he counted, I mean, his guess was at least 200, but his... Well, maybe they should be Arnold's cabinet!
[02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:16.031]  Well, but here's what they're getting ready to do, and you guys were talking about it yesterday.
[02:09:16.551 --> 02:09:20.773]  We also knew two people who worked for FEMA, and one came into contact indirectly.
[02:09:21.093 --> 02:09:24.134]  They've built a base outside, between St.
[02:09:24.174 --> 02:09:28.955]  George and Las Vegas, and you were talking about the linchpins that are going to bring martial law on.
[02:09:29.375 --> 02:09:31.176]  I really believe it's my gut feeling.
[02:09:31.356 --> 02:09:33.577]  They've already got the FEMA, the 10 cities put up.
[02:09:34.037 --> 02:09:36.458]  Newsmax had covered that a year and a half, two years ago.
[02:09:36.938 --> 02:09:41.300]  I was contracted with a company called EG&G to build them between Las Vegas and St.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:41.741]  George.
[02:09:42.161 --> 02:09:43.781]  And my dad lives in St.
[02:09:43.801 --> 02:09:44.082]  George.
[02:09:44.462 --> 02:09:49.504]  And so I would travel constantly there, and you'll see scores of black helicopters just after you get past.
[02:09:49.904 --> 02:09:50.905]  Well, let me just stop you.
[02:09:51.005 --> 02:09:53.566]  I have the video of up by Dallas.
[02:09:54.726 --> 02:09:58.768]  There are just thousands of old Vietnam-era Bell helicopters.
[02:09:59.948 --> 02:10:03.429]  And they're painting them black, and they're putting new high-powered engines in them.
[02:10:04.209 --> 02:10:07.590]  And they've got it... Before, they had to get, you know, like, one a week ready.
[02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:09.751]  Now it's, what'd he say, seven a week ready.
[02:10:10.391 --> 02:10:12.632]  And they're for domestic operations.
[02:10:12.752 --> 02:10:13.952]  Thousands of helicopters.
[02:10:14.313 --> 02:10:17.033]  What do they need thousands of... This is for the big push.
[02:10:17.233 --> 02:10:17.654]  Exactly.
[02:10:17.674 --> 02:10:18.754]  This is what made Nuka City.
[02:10:18.794 --> 02:10:19.774]  This is... You can go.
[02:10:20.214 --> 02:10:20.955]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:10:20.975 --> 02:10:21.515]  I didn't mean to catch up.
[02:10:21.535 --> 02:10:21.775]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:21.855 --> 02:10:25.496]  And then Jim Keith, before they killed him, really got a lot of the documents on this.
[02:10:26.317 --> 02:10:27.058]  That's their plan.
[02:10:27.098 --> 02:10:33.446]  They've got all these foreign soldiers, all these FEMA camps, huge foreign armies of highly trained specialists.
[02:10:33.586 --> 02:10:35.669]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:10:35.749 --> 02:10:39.093]  And now, let me add this, now... I was shocked when I saw the pictures of them, you know.
[02:10:39.113 --> 02:10:39.654]  Let me add this.
[02:10:40.114 --> 02:10:41.276]  Now, top
[02:10:42.112 --> 02:10:48.517]  Generals have gone on TV and said, oh yes, foreign assets will defend the homeland if we're on a war on terror overseas.
[02:10:49.038 --> 02:10:49.198]  Right.
[02:10:49.618 --> 02:10:53.181]  And literally it has been like taking the pill in the Matrix where you wake up.
[02:10:53.281 --> 02:10:57.144]  And it's been that for me because I campaigned for Bush in three states, believe it or not, Republican.
[02:10:57.754 --> 02:11:03.899]  And it has just been, since 9-11, a continual wake-up and to realize, and thank God you went into Bohemian Grove and did all that.
[02:11:04.199 --> 02:11:06.040]  And again, thank God for George and Ray, because I loved that.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.603]  I listened to Art Bell for years, but he would never put on you or Steve Quayle or anybody like that.
[02:11:11.004 --> 02:11:14.406]  And I truly think they did, because I'd have never found you except through that.
[02:11:15.027 --> 02:11:18.129]  And again, just what you guys do is amazing.
[02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:20.511]  There's been a continual revelation, and these people do.
[02:11:20.551 --> 02:11:23.713]  You said yesterday, you're like, how could they kill children in Oklahoma City?
[02:11:24.213 --> 02:11:25.314]  Bro, they're serving Satan.
[02:11:25.334 --> 02:11:27.156]  They literally worship the devil.
[02:11:27.757 --> 02:11:34.164]  And because God is in us, a lot of people, we sit back and wonder, how could you harm a child?
[02:11:34.204 --> 02:11:35.345]  You know, it astonishes us.
[02:11:35.886 --> 02:11:41.672]  And even people I know in the military, and they know they've got to get our boys out so they can guard us with these foreign troops.
[02:11:42.252 --> 02:11:44.214]  And Americans just be prepared.
[02:11:44.254 --> 02:11:47.056]  And the other thing I would say is optimistically pray.
[02:11:47.136 --> 02:11:53.081]  Because more than once, they've had these type of plans in place and they didn't go off or they went awry.
[02:11:53.741 --> 02:11:58.085]  And the most powerful thing in the world, I humbly believe that, and I thank you for letting me say it, is prayer.
[02:11:58.265 --> 02:11:59.006]  No, it is.
[02:11:59.106 --> 02:12:00.267]  Listen, thank you for the call.
[02:12:00.327 --> 02:12:01.908]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:02.628 --> 02:12:03.529]  Very interesting points.
[02:12:03.929 --> 02:12:07.512]  Speaking of George Norrie, who was a good friend of mine, great guy.
[02:12:07.532 --> 02:12:10.795]  I really appreciate him having me on his huge forum.
[02:12:11.235 --> 02:12:13.936]  Second biggest radio show in the country, bar none.
[02:12:14.476 --> 02:12:16.997]  The most responsive audience out there, period.
[02:12:17.638 --> 02:12:19.438]  I'm going to be on tomorrow night.
[02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:21.619]  I'm not sure yet.
[02:12:21.639 --> 02:12:23.560]  It's either three or all four hours.
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:24.881]  Certainly for three hours.
[02:12:26.141 --> 02:12:27.742]  In studio with George Norrie.
[02:12:27.782 --> 02:12:34.965]  He's going to be here in Austin, Texas for TalkFest that KLBJ is putting on Saturday at the convention center.
[02:12:35.942 --> 02:12:38.064]  And I'd like to go to that.
[02:12:38.084 --> 02:12:39.945]  I've been invited to that, but I don't know if I'll go.
[02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:41.066]  I'm trying to finish this film.
[02:12:41.646 --> 02:12:48.531]  But I am going to be on Coast to Coast AM at least for three hours tomorrow night.
[02:12:49.591 --> 02:12:52.433]  And so, in studio with George Norrie.
[02:12:53.074 --> 02:12:54.234]  Hardly anybody gets to do that.
[02:12:54.275 --> 02:12:55.255]  That's going to be fun.
[02:12:57.225 --> 02:12:59.847]  So I look forward to that and talking to tens of millions of people.
[02:13:00.368 --> 02:13:01.909]  All right, thanks for the call there.
[02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:04.051]  Let's talk to another caller here.
[02:13:04.191 --> 02:13:05.913]  I guess John Michigan is up next.
[02:13:05.933 --> 02:13:06.574]  Go ahead, John.
[02:13:08.035 --> 02:13:09.176]  I'm John from New York, possibly.
[02:13:09.417 --> 02:13:10.518]  Okay, John, go ahead.
[02:13:10.558 --> 02:13:11.859]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:12.920]  Very good.
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:15.242]  Just had an interesting thing locally here last night.
[02:13:15.262 --> 02:13:20.588]  We've been fighting for a long time, and to be honest with you, I thought I was the only one around until I got a shortwave radio about four months ago.
[02:13:21.389 --> 02:13:24.170]  Uh, there's a gentleman I work with that chainsawed his armpit in 98.
[02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:28.232]  He's got an SSI report that says he's eligible for disability if he's ever disabled.
[02:13:28.792 --> 02:13:35.255]  But a doctor says, even though his hand is dead and his arm's only got 15% mobility, doctor says he can dress a dolly, that he's not disabled.
[02:13:35.455 --> 02:13:41.437]  But yet the, uh, motor vehicle department has given him, uh, disability, uh, regulations to have a steering knob and all that.
[02:13:41.477 --> 02:13:44.398]  Well, he got arrested for having a taillight out and not having a steering knob.
[02:13:44.678 --> 02:13:48.580]  Well, he went to court last night and, uh, you know, he fought the cases.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.941]  Well, no one pays me to, to change my steering,
[02:13:52.354 --> 02:13:54.476]  Put my signal stat on the other side of the car.
[02:13:54.516 --> 02:13:55.857]  He says, I'm a family member.
[02:13:55.877 --> 02:13:57.718]  I'm the sole earner for the whole family.
[02:13:57.738 --> 02:13:58.439]  I've got one arm.
[02:13:58.899 --> 02:13:59.640]  He does mechanics.
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:01.441]  And they don't support me.
[02:14:01.902 --> 02:14:04.144]  And yet, you're giving me a ticket for it.
[02:14:04.164 --> 02:14:07.647]  And yet, there's not a doctor in your motor vehicle department that says I'm disabled.
[02:14:07.667 --> 02:14:10.169]  But they have another doctor that says I'm not disabled.
[02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:12.190]  Well, this is what the government did, sir.
[02:14:13.371 --> 02:14:16.274]  The government trained us.
[02:14:16.534 --> 02:14:19.677]  Let me explain how you domesticate animals.
[02:14:21.044 --> 02:14:25.247]  You know, five, six thousand years ago, how they began domesticating animals, even longer than that.
[02:14:27.048 --> 02:14:32.412]  What they do, is you start putting food out, and you get them used to coming up close to you.
[02:14:33.273 --> 02:14:41.779]  Then you build a little pen, and you put the food inside the pen, and the animals start going into the pen, then you have it where you close the gate once they go in the pen.
[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:44.921]  And that's how you catch wild hogs.
[02:14:45.122 --> 02:14:48.384]  Domestic pigs have gotten out, domesticated farm pigs,
[02:14:49.324 --> 02:14:55.951]  And after a few generations they grow, you know, two foot long hair, foot long hair, huge tusks.
[02:14:56.412 --> 02:14:57.633]  They're wild boars.
[02:14:59.054 --> 02:15:00.556]  And they destroy your crops.
[02:15:00.636 --> 02:15:04.580]  So what you do is you set up a little gate and a little fence, and you put a corn feeder out in front of it.
[02:15:05.341 --> 02:15:09.746]  You run that for a few weeks, get them used to eating at it, and you slowly move it into the fence.
[02:15:10.976 --> 02:15:15.941]  Then you leave it in the fence for a few weeks with the gate open because the stupid ones will go in at first.
[02:15:16.402 --> 02:15:26.232]  Then once the whole pack sees or the whole troop sees that it's safe, they all go in and you put an electronic timer on it that goes off ten minutes after the corn shoots out.
[02:15:26.292 --> 02:15:30.196]  They all go in, you close the gate, you load the hogs up and send them off to slaughter.
[02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:33.872]  This is what this social welfare net has done.
[02:15:34.373 --> 02:15:36.094]  Send both the husband and wife to work.
[02:15:36.434 --> 02:15:37.375]  Tax everybody.
[02:15:37.395 --> 02:15:39.076]  Oh, but we're going to have a social safety net.
[02:15:39.577 --> 02:15:42.439]  Now that we're domesticated, they're taking the social safety net away.
[02:15:42.839 --> 02:15:44.120]  They're taking the corn away.
[02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:51.686]  We've got troops with arms and legs blown off that don't get disability or get like 5% disability.
[02:15:53.548 --> 02:15:56.330]  I know people who've got children that are totally retarded.
[02:15:57.801 --> 02:16:15.929]  What got me was that it's a local farmer that's the GP, Justice of the Peace, and in the past I'm going to tell you that he's been responsive and fair, I'm going to say as fair as possible, and here he charged a guy $150 for not having a steering knob on his steering wheel.
[02:16:15.949 --> 02:16:16.730]  Well, that's what it's like.
[02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:19.111]  They take the services away that we pay for,
[02:16:20.178 --> 02:16:21.640]  They're now taking the grain away.
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:24.762]  Because we're already in the cage, why keep feeding us grain?
[02:16:25.223 --> 02:16:27.885]  And then they start the slaughter, the bleeding, the shearing.
[02:16:28.365 --> 02:16:33.910]  And then they start... Almost everybody I know that drives dump trucks and construction vehicles is out of business.
[02:16:34.311 --> 02:16:36.993]  If you're one of the big companies, they leave you alone in Central Texas.
[02:16:37.533 --> 02:16:39.335]  If you're the small company, they pull you over.
[02:16:39.715 --> 02:16:42.758]  One drop of dust on your bumper, $500 fine.
[02:16:43.018 --> 02:16:45.340]  People are losing their houses, losing everything they got.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:47.382]  They still lick the government's boots.
[02:16:48.406 --> 02:16:50.127]  And this is what it's designed to do.
[02:16:50.227 --> 02:16:51.607]  Everybody's going to go out of business.
[02:16:51.647 --> 02:16:52.847]  Everybody's going to be a slave.
[02:16:53.207 --> 02:16:55.728]  Everybody's going to work for a big corporation and do what they say.
[02:16:56.168 --> 02:16:56.948]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:16:56.988 --> 02:16:57.588]  I appreciate it.
[02:16:58.049 --> 02:17:05.211]  And I'm sorry for your friend, but, uh, I mean, you don't think you're going to pay your money into a government that's owned by private crime syndicates and they're going to pay you, do you?
[02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:07.551]  They got you in shackles now.
[02:17:07.591 --> 02:17:08.931]  They got you in the pig cage.
[02:17:09.672 --> 02:17:12.272]  And there's no reason once you got the pigs to feed them anymore.
[02:17:13.473 --> 02:17:14.433]  They got us in the cage.
[02:17:15.587 --> 02:17:21.712]  And, you know, a few of us went into the cage at first, and now those that won't go in the cage, they're just saying, okay, new freedom initiative.
[02:17:22.153 --> 02:17:25.876]  We're going to forcibly, psychologically test you and say you're mentally ill and put you on drugs.
[02:17:26.857 --> 02:17:31.100]  Or, okay, your child draws a stick figure with a knife.
[02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:33.463]  We're going to put them in prison at age ten.
[02:17:34.223 --> 02:17:35.444]  Everything's going to be a crime.
[02:17:35.704 --> 02:17:38.667]  You're going in the pig cage, and you're going to the slaughterhouse.
[02:17:38.907 --> 02:17:39.908]  Do you understand?
[02:17:40.288 --> 02:17:40.929]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.381 --> 02:17:48.582]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:17:49.342 --> 02:17:57.603]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:17:58.203 --> 02:17:59.944]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[02:18:00.644 --> 02:18:01.284]  Why you listen.
[02:18:01.924 --> 02:18:06.625]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:18:07.245 --> 02:18:08.805]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:18:09.345 --> 02:18:11.486]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:18:12.106 --> 02:18:14.066]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:18:14.674 --> 02:18:15.774]  And it's so easy.
[02:18:16.495 --> 02:18:18.575]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:18:19.335 --> 02:18:19.975]  When you want.
[02:18:20.496 --> 02:18:21.136]  Where you want.

[02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:50.955]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:51.295 --> 02:18:53.638]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:19:52.867 --> 02:19:57.552]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?

[02:20:44.051 --> 02:20:45.694]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:45.794 --> 02:20:49.940]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:52.925]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:20:53.005 --> 02:20:59.695]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:59.895 --> 02:21:02.897]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:21:03.097 --> 02:21:05.499]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:21:05.639 --> 02:21:15.787]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:16.727]  N-T-B-E.
[02:21:16.947 --> 02:21:17.388]  Radon 222.
[02:21:17.868 --> 02:21:19.849]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:21:19.989 --> 02:21:25.111]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:21:25.251 --> 02:21:34.035]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:34.075 --> 02:21:34.275]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:21:45.403 --> 02:21:50.546]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:51.227 --> 02:21:53.608]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:53.648 --> 02:22:00.272]  Alright, Daryl and Jim and Mark and Ron and Stanford, your calls are all coming up and a smattering of other news.
[02:22:01.533 --> 02:22:02.934]  Right now, let's keep going to your calls.
[02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:04.115]  Daryl in Tennessee.
[02:22:04.155 --> 02:22:04.795]  Go ahead, Daryl.
[02:22:04.815 --> 02:22:06.597]  Yeah, I had a question for you, Alex.
[02:22:06.797 --> 02:22:10.059]  A while back on your broadcast, you had mentioned William Cooper dying.
[02:22:10.679 --> 02:22:11.400]  Yeah.
[02:22:12.208 --> 02:22:13.269]  I only know a little bit.
[02:22:13.289 --> 02:22:15.410]  I only read his book, Behold the White Pale Horse.
[02:22:16.071 --> 02:22:18.092]  Could you tell me a little bit about him?
[02:22:18.152 --> 02:22:19.073]  I don't know much about him.
[02:22:19.133 --> 02:22:19.894]  I figured you might know.
[02:22:19.914 --> 02:22:21.535]  Do you have a computer?
[02:22:22.410 --> 02:22:25.112]  Not at this time, no.
[02:22:25.152 --> 02:22:28.713]  The best thing to do is, I can't do it justice, is just go to the library.
[02:22:28.753 --> 02:22:29.274]  It's free.
[02:22:29.734 --> 02:22:32.996]  And type William Cooper, the whole lapel horse, into a search engine.
[02:22:33.576 --> 02:22:35.357]  And you can spend hours reading about it.
[02:22:35.457 --> 02:22:39.839]  You can see the death certificate and the autopsy report and read the news articles about it.
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:41.240]  Okay.
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:42.801]  But Bill, I think, was a good guy.
[02:22:42.841 --> 02:22:44.082]  Certainly wasn't a government agent.
[02:22:44.142 --> 02:22:45.902]  Highly decorated veteran in Vietnam.
[02:22:45.922 --> 02:22:46.683]  Gunboat captain.
[02:22:47.686 --> 02:22:49.788]  And a lot of what he said panned out to be true.
[02:22:49.808 --> 02:22:53.832]  A lot of stuff he reported on he later said that was disinfo that he had planted on him.
[02:22:54.713 --> 02:22:58.097]  And then he got a little bit, I guess, depressed at the end.
[02:22:58.157 --> 02:23:00.539]  And really was highly combative.
[02:23:00.599 --> 02:23:02.901]  I mean, he put out an alert saying he needed help with the IRS.
[02:23:02.921 --> 02:23:04.483]  So I called him up to have him on as a guest.
[02:23:04.543 --> 02:23:06.265]  And he started cussing.
[02:23:07.306 --> 02:23:09.548]  You know, and that's what I heard he did to his neighbors and people.
[02:23:09.628 --> 02:23:11.250]  And he got into it with the local police.
[02:23:12.248 --> 02:23:18.856]  And then I don't know exactly what happened, but a police officer got shot in the face and almost died, and Bill Cooper and his dog got blown away.
[02:23:18.876 --> 02:23:22.621]  And, uh, you know, I don't know what else to say about it.
[02:23:23.242 --> 02:23:29.129]  Okay, well I didn't know if any of the stuff that he had written on was, was, uh, part tangible evidence or worthwhile.
[02:23:29.818 --> 02:23:35.805]  Because I found that book a little hard to believe, and he wouldn't really name the sources, so I just kind of wanted to know.
[02:23:35.826 --> 02:23:39.430]  Yeah, there's enough stuff that's so bizarre that's documented, it's hard to believe.
[02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:41.092]  You know, why talk about stuff you can't prove?
[02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:45.838]  Well, that's why I like your program, because you back it up with the legislation and things like this.
[02:23:47.043 --> 02:23:51.447]  Overall, I think Bill was a good guy, and I'm sad that his passing.
[02:23:51.487 --> 02:23:51.847]  Take care.
[02:23:52.167 --> 02:23:52.468]  Thank you.
[02:23:52.508 --> 02:23:53.188]  Appreciate it.
[02:23:53.489 --> 02:23:55.530]  Let's talk to Jim in Michigan.
[02:23:55.951 --> 02:23:56.671]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:23:57.532 --> 02:24:00.755]  Good morning, or good afternoon, Alex.
[02:24:00.935 --> 02:24:02.576]  I've got three items here.
[02:24:03.457 --> 02:24:06.800]  The Phyllis Shafley report I just got, she's 100% against Bush now.
[02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:10.562]  Remember she was kind of waffling when she was on your program?
[02:24:11.002 --> 02:24:11.302]  Yes.
[02:24:11.382 --> 02:24:14.425]  And she's against the FTAA and the CAFTA and all this.
[02:24:14.685 --> 02:24:20.470]  Well, yeah, now that they got Bush back in, now all these groups can come out and go, oh, we're conservative.
[02:24:22.149 --> 02:24:27.351]  She's against Bush's feminist mischief, the women in combat and all this crap.
[02:24:27.672 --> 02:24:28.332]  That's another thing.
[02:24:28.532 --> 02:24:30.553]  Everybody pulled their hair out about women in combat.
[02:24:30.613 --> 02:24:31.813]  Bush is actually doing it.
[02:24:32.554 --> 02:24:34.094]  He's out-Clinton-ing Clinton.
[02:24:34.455 --> 02:24:35.555]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:24:35.695 --> 02:24:37.556]  In the name of being a conservative.
[02:24:38.096 --> 02:24:40.857]  And another deal here, I've got a couple more items.
[02:24:41.498 --> 02:24:45.840]  Are you familiar with Carl Miller, aka Richard Champion?
[02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:46.560]  Yes.
[02:24:47.142 --> 02:24:52.847]  Okay, I went down to court yesterday and the judge, he was finally allowed to be, we got him out of the nuthouse.
[02:24:54.068 --> 02:24:59.493]  They forcibly tried to put stuff in him and I found out you have to resist or you lack resistance.
[02:24:59.533 --> 02:25:03.276]  By the way, we're talking to the founder of Domino's Pizza right now.
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:06.782]  And, uh, anyway... Why don't you tell them about that, Jim?
[02:25:07.062 --> 02:25:11.224]  No, I mean, you're talking about somebody who fought the courts, exposed their corruption, they grab them, say they're mentally ill.
[02:25:11.484 --> 02:25:12.505]  Yeah, nobody was around.
[02:25:12.525 --> 02:25:20.169]  A top army doctor says, they admit, was it Waco, and he sees them kill the people, and he reports on it, so they grab him.
[02:25:20.490 --> 02:25:25.492]  Seven years in solitary confinement, forced drugging, uh, no charges have even been brought against him.
[02:25:25.513 --> 02:25:26.473]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:25:27.173 --> 02:25:29.915]  Well, now they got him on five felony counts of firearms.
[02:25:29.935 --> 02:25:31.476]  Well, he knows the Second Amendment's valid.
[02:25:32.083 --> 02:25:39.148]  And the judge yesterday, Judge Bronson, said that since they finally got him out of the non-office, he can be his own lawyer.
[02:25:39.488 --> 02:25:41.230]  They tried to prevent him from doing that.
[02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:49.035]  He knows the law inside out, backwards, and the Michigan court rules the same way, which the judges don't even understand.
[02:25:52.596 --> 02:25:55.298]  They broke every law in the books when they incarcerated him.
[02:25:55.318 --> 02:25:57.319]  They didn't fill out the proper forms.
[02:25:57.339 --> 02:26:00.102]  Hey, the White House has said the government is the law.
[02:26:00.522 --> 02:26:01.943]  They don't even have to follow their own laws.
[02:26:01.983 --> 02:26:03.865]  They're God.
[02:26:04.625 --> 02:26:05.806]  There's a word for that.
[02:26:05.866 --> 02:26:06.727]  It's called tyranny.
[02:26:07.067 --> 02:26:07.748]  Yeah, really.
[02:26:08.449 --> 02:26:13.773]  And the judge says, well, I'd like to implement my actions.
[02:26:14.333 --> 02:26:17.476]  He says they're all without merit, so he's got to fight it from there on.
[02:26:17.516 --> 02:26:18.657]  He's fighting it from prison.
[02:26:19.167 --> 02:26:21.389]  Got a guy named Dean Hazel there.
[02:26:21.909 --> 02:26:23.530]  Send me some info on it.
[02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:24.551]  Good to hear from you, Jim.
[02:26:24.891 --> 02:26:26.372]  Mark in New York.
[02:26:26.412 --> 02:26:27.073]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:26:27.613 --> 02:26:27.853]  Alex?
[02:26:28.173 --> 02:26:28.494]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:28.954 --> 02:26:29.774]  You know, I had a thought.
[02:26:29.794 --> 02:26:37.820]  Supposedly, we're training a lot of troops, Iraqis, to become their own army at this time.
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:41.082]  What they've done is put 98% of the Ba'athas back in.
[02:26:41.743 --> 02:26:47.787]  Okay, well, they're going to be armed, obviously, and have weapons, guns, and everything.
[02:26:48.226 --> 02:26:59.715]  Now, if Bush plans on attacking Iran in the near future, what happens if those Iraqi troops turn against the American soldiers while they're attacking Iran?
[02:27:01.516 --> 02:27:02.617]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[02:27:02.657 --> 02:27:04.318]  Saddam never turned on his masters.
[02:27:04.358 --> 02:27:10.303]  Saddam was put in by our government, ordered to invade Iran, told to go ahead and invade Kuwait, and they set him up.
[02:27:10.723 --> 02:27:14.546]  So as long as our government doesn't set up the new public government, they're not going to do anything bad.
[02:27:14.867 --> 02:27:15.227]  I see.
[02:27:15.587 --> 02:27:15.907]  Okay.
[02:27:16.988 --> 02:27:17.809]  That's a good question.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:20.821]  Imagine the poor Iraqis, man.
[02:27:20.841 --> 02:27:22.602]  They're seeing all the Ba'athists put back in.
[02:27:23.023 --> 02:27:24.444]  That wouldn't make you very happy, would it?
[02:27:24.684 --> 02:27:25.504]  It'd make me sick.
[02:27:26.525 --> 02:27:27.106]  Anything else?
[02:27:27.586 --> 02:27:27.826]  No.
[02:27:27.946 --> 02:27:28.667]  Thanks for the show.

[02:29:44.796 --> 02:29:47.957]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:29:48.137 --> 02:29:50.859]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:29:51.039 --> 02:29:52.439]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:29:52.599 --> 02:30:02.524]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:30:02.724 --> 02:30:04.445]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:30:04.745 --> 02:30:08.607]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:08.847 --> 02:30:13.250]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.

[02:30:36.763 --> 02:30:38.204]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:38.224 --> 02:30:46.089]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:30:46.129 --> 02:30:48.670]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:50.992]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:31:04.901 --> 02:31:08.202]  And we're about to go to Ron and Stanford and Robert and a few other callers.
[02:31:08.222 --> 02:31:11.702]  And then I want to get into 10-year-olds being arrested for drawing stick figures with knives.
[02:31:13.223 --> 02:31:16.703]  And I want to get into just a whole other big stack of vital news.
[02:31:17.464 --> 02:31:33.307]  But before we go to these final calls here in the last 26 minutes that we've got left on this Thursday, the 27th of January, 2005 edition, I am honored, I am pleased to have, well, Debbie from New Millennium Concepts on.
[02:31:34.153 --> 02:31:45.557]  The makers of the premier gravity-fed water filter that's made right here in America, that is of the highest standards and quality, cost about the same as a cheap Indian or Chinese knockoff.
[02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:59.321]  So you can go buy these that are made in a foreign country and are cheaply made, or you can buy the accredited, high-quality, university-tested Berkey systems.
[02:32:00.675 --> 02:32:04.898]  And they've got a whole plethora of different items to offer, and Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:05.058 --> 02:32:07.479]  Hi Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:10.781]  It's always good to hear your voice, Debbie.
[02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:13.363]  You know, I really don't have words to describe.
[02:32:13.423 --> 02:32:20.787]  If people don't buy your filters, and don't stop drinking the poisonous water, this is something where they can take control from the New World Order.
[02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:24.142]  And 70% of your life is water.
[02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:25.642]  You gotta have it to live.
[02:32:25.763 --> 02:32:29.765]  And why people do this, why people don't do it, I know they're procrastinating.
[02:32:30.325 --> 02:32:31.026]  I have no idea.
[02:32:31.046 --> 02:32:36.108]  And some little cheap, you know, $50 gizmo at the store just takes bad flavor out.
[02:32:36.409 --> 02:32:40.291]  These charcoal filters do nothing, folks, but take some of the bad flavor out.
[02:32:40.371 --> 02:32:41.652]  Maybe big fat bacteria.
[02:32:42.412 --> 02:32:43.773]  You know, amoeba-sized stuff.
[02:32:44.373 --> 02:32:45.434]  Tell them what the Berkeys do.
[02:32:46.485 --> 02:32:55.611]  Um, actually the Berkey lights have the new Berkey water filters made in America have what's called our black Berkey purification elements in them Alex.
[02:32:56.431 --> 02:33:01.715]  And they take out pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to a non-detectable level.
[02:33:02.615 --> 02:33:07.038]  And I would tell you something, you do not realize where you're getting those from.
[02:33:07.058 --> 02:33:12.021]  I was reading an article in a magazine at the store the other day.
[02:33:12.041 --> 02:33:13.042]  I was out somewhere.
[02:33:14.153 --> 02:33:27.160]  And it's said that 80% of airplanes do not drink the coffee, the tea, the ice, the water because 80% of the airplanes tested the water they were using had bacteria in it.
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:33.103]  If you're in a mobile home, an RV, you know, those storage tanks are not clean.
[02:33:33.623 --> 02:33:39.186]  You're pumping water in from these hoses and they're in the storage tanks or however they're coming up.
[02:33:40.825 --> 02:34:06.958]  Yeah, you have to be aware that you're getting these bacterias from everywhere, you know, and by birthing your water first, by taking your tap water, whether you're on a well, whether you're using your rainwater, whether you're in the city, by birthing your water, you're at least taking some control of your life of what's going in your body.
[02:34:07.555 --> 02:34:10.757]  Well, I agree, but I've read about these tanks in RVs and in mobile homes.
[02:34:11.017 --> 02:34:26.484]  I just didn't believe it, you know, because I really was surprised that a regular magazine, worldly magazine, would have right there in bold print, you know, that 80% of the airplanes tested had bacteria in the water, do not drink the ice, don't eat the tea.
[02:34:26.804 --> 02:34:33.267]  And usually when I fly, which I like to fly a lot, you know, because everybody I think knows I'm from California and I visit home a lot,
[02:34:34.045 --> 02:34:38.731]  And I fly all the time and I'll drink coffee on the plane or I'll have, you know, ice water.
[02:34:38.751 --> 02:34:42.916]  Of course, they give you bottle water, but I always take my Berkey Sport bottle anyway.
[02:34:43.777 --> 02:34:47.642]  And somebody got blessed with one recently because I accidentally left one on a plane.
[02:34:48.604 --> 02:34:49.364]  Absolutely.
[02:34:49.605 --> 02:34:50.265]  Absolutely.
[02:34:50.325 --> 02:34:50.965]  I mean, even
[02:35:11.534 --> 02:35:24.743]  Even, like, how many times have you made iced tea and kind of left it out because it's a hot summer day or whatever and you leave it out on the counter and then you take a drink and it's kind of thick and it's horrible and you go, oh, yuck!
[02:35:25.224 --> 02:35:27.305]  You know, because something grew in that.
[02:35:27.405 --> 02:35:29.147]  Well, same thing, think of the heat.
[02:35:29.427 --> 02:35:31.408]  It's a dark, wet environment.
[02:35:32.289 --> 02:35:34.530]  And the Berkeys do fit in an RV.
[02:35:35.031 --> 02:35:40.795]  I have a very good friend who has one in his RV and he had to kind of make a spot for it.
[02:35:41.577 --> 02:35:46.419]  And, you know, he put it so that it doesn't topple over, except if he makes a really fast right-hand turn.
[02:35:46.459 --> 02:35:47.360]  No, I'm kidding.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:53.722]  But there are ways to even, you know, put one in your RV, put one on your boat, take them with you.
[02:35:53.762 --> 02:36:00.425]  There's a very prominent musician from Austin who listens to your program.
[02:36:01.065 --> 02:36:06.407]  And a couple years ago, for Christmas, he bought Berkey Lights for every single one of his travel buses.
[02:36:08.089 --> 02:36:13.975]  For all of his RVs, for all of his staff, his crew, you know.
[02:36:14.135 --> 02:36:15.396]  Who won't say any names?
[02:36:15.617 --> 02:36:16.177]  No, I won't.
[02:36:16.317 --> 02:36:18.479]  I know that too.
[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:19.480]  No, I know, I know.
[02:36:21.022 --> 02:36:21.863]  But no, that's true.
[02:36:21.923 --> 02:36:23.284]  He's a great guy.
[02:36:23.344 --> 02:36:29.691]  But for those that just joined us, they need to give you a call, ask about the different specials.
[02:36:30.251 --> 02:36:34.794]  You know, the sports bottles, the units for the kitchen, all of it.
[02:36:35.234 --> 02:36:40.417]  You need the shower filters, that's where you're inhaling a lot of this, and it's going through your skin as well, one of the biggest areas.
[02:36:40.897 --> 02:36:42.878]  Oh, and I thought of something the other day, too.
[02:36:42.918 --> 02:36:52.664]  Let me tell you this, Alex, because I've had people ask me if we have a filter for the bathtub, and I always say, no, we don't, you know?
[02:36:53.144 --> 02:36:58.367]  But if somebody were to put the shower filter in the shower part of their bathtub,
[02:36:58.863 --> 02:37:06.946]  And then go to like a store and buy a $10 hand-held shower head, you know the kind on the hose?
[02:37:06.967 --> 02:37:07.867]  Let me just stop you there.
[02:37:07.927 --> 02:37:13.269]  With my family, with my children, when they take baths, yes, I went to stores.
[02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:17.691]  They do not sell them that go over the faucet.
[02:37:17.711 --> 02:37:21.153]  What you do is you just take the long cord with the shower in.
[02:37:22.193 --> 02:37:23.573]  And you fill your bathtub up!
[02:37:23.693 --> 02:37:27.255]  And you fill your bathtub up, and they know exactly what I've done.
[02:37:27.335 --> 02:37:28.755]  I just figured that out!
[02:37:28.975 --> 02:37:33.097]  I mean, I can't believe the light bulb went off a couple days ago when I went, oh no!
[02:37:33.117 --> 02:37:35.137]  Great minds think alike, Debbie.
[02:37:35.417 --> 02:37:36.398]  We're improvising.
[02:37:36.418 --> 02:37:38.859]  I'm going to put my little ones in that toxic garbage.
[02:37:38.879 --> 02:37:41.279]  Yeah, so you can do that even if you have a bathtub.
[02:37:41.319 --> 02:37:43.380]  So for those people who do that... Okay, well let's give them the number, Debbie.
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:44.280]  Let's give them the number.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.301]  It's toll-free 1-888-803.
[02:37:51.244 --> 02:37:54.867]  4438.
[02:37:51.784 --> 02:37:54.867]  Alright, 888-803-4438.
[02:37:54.927 --> 02:37:56.328]  Debbie's a great lady.
[02:37:56.709 --> 02:37:57.469]  Give her a call.
[02:37:57.589 --> 02:37:58.991]  If the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[02:37:59.011 --> 02:38:02.994]  She'll call you right back.
[02:38:03.014 --> 02:38:03.354]  888-803-4438.
[02:38:03.715 --> 02:38:05.256]  Debbie, thanks a million for coming on with us.
[02:38:05.496 --> 02:38:06.217]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:06.357 --> 02:38:07.698]  Have a wonderful weekend.
[02:38:08.038 --> 02:38:08.459]  You too.
[02:38:08.499 --> 02:38:10.541]  Thanks for all you do and the great sponsorship.
[02:38:10.561 --> 02:38:10.881]  888-803-4438.
[02:38:10.901 --> 02:38:12.462]  They're the big national distributor
[02:38:16.181 --> 02:38:21.044]  To everybody of the British Berkey, and that's, you know, made in the Western world, and it's high quality.
[02:38:21.325 --> 02:38:26.748]  Well, they upgraded it to an even higher standard with the black Berkey elements in the cases, made in America.
[02:38:27.209 --> 02:38:32.212]  So they got both the units, whether you want Brit-made, which is good too, or the American-made, even better.
[02:38:33.113 --> 02:38:36.735]  I know it's evil, we have American-made products here on the show, I understand I'm liberal.
[02:38:36.755 --> 02:38:40.278]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to get my videos.
[02:38:45.622 --> 02:38:52.044]  Or the number to call to get the Berkey's is 888-803-4438 or berkeywater.com in the comment section.
[02:38:52.064 --> 02:38:53.065]  Tell them what free gift you want.
[02:38:53.405 --> 02:38:53.885]  Give her a call.
[02:38:54.125 --> 02:38:55.626]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[02:38:55.666 --> 02:38:56.766]  Thanks for sitting through that, folks.
[02:38:57.286 --> 02:38:59.507]  It's easy to listen to Debbie, but hard to listen to me, I know.
[02:39:00.307 --> 02:39:06.490]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, up next here would be Ron in New York.
[02:39:06.570 --> 02:39:07.250]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:09.751]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:39:09.791 --> 02:39:10.251]  Good, sir.
[02:39:10.351 --> 02:39:12.792]  Can I get Greg Ellis' phone number off the air?
[02:39:13.846 --> 02:39:15.707]  You had him on last week or two weeks ago?
[02:39:15.767 --> 02:39:17.768]  Yeah, I don't have Greg Powell's phone number in front of me.
[02:39:18.808 --> 02:39:21.409]  He lives in England and he also lives in New York.
[02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:23.090]  There's a couple points here.
[02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:31.273]  They're using Bush's strong points in his personality to invoke an emotional response in people.
[02:39:31.853 --> 02:39:36.855]  You know, how they've orchestrated his walk, his talk, his strut to
[02:39:38.001 --> 02:39:44.366]  You get people to respond emotionally, and with that image, that's how they're drawn to him.
[02:39:44.466 --> 02:39:49.811]  No, he constantly talks about God, he constantly talks about freedom and liberty, when he's the exact opposite.
[02:39:51.252 --> 02:40:03.022]  And there's a reporter on CNN last week that asked him, what is the best, what is the strongest way we can improve our security, national security?
[02:40:03.623 --> 02:40:05.264]  And here's his answer, quote,
[02:40:06.092 --> 02:40:09.875]  We need to get into the minds and the mail of the enemy.
[02:40:10.695 --> 02:40:11.556]  That was his answer.
[02:40:12.156 --> 02:40:13.397]  Now, that speaks volumes.
[02:40:14.458 --> 02:40:19.961]  What was really being said here is we need to get into the minds and the mail of the American people.
[02:40:20.201 --> 02:40:21.162]  Well, that's what they're doing!
[02:40:21.782 --> 02:40:22.303]  Exactly.
[02:40:22.443 --> 02:40:29.007]  I mean, when the Supreme Court on Monday said we're going to search all your vehicles with drug dogs, no Fourth Amendment needed, no probable cause.
[02:40:29.087 --> 02:40:31.008]  I mean, the Fourth Amendment's still there.
[02:40:31.048 --> 02:40:32.109]  They can say it's gone.
[02:40:32.509 --> 02:40:33.190]  It's still there.
[02:40:33.210 --> 02:40:34.010]  This is criminal.
[02:40:34.050 --> 02:40:34.891]  This is seditious.
[02:40:36.069 --> 02:40:37.431]  And the borders are wide open.
[02:40:37.451 --> 02:40:38.071]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:38.491 --> 02:40:39.572]  Ron, I really appreciate it.
[02:40:39.632 --> 02:40:41.213]  I'm sorry I don't have Greg's phone number in front of me.
[02:40:41.514 --> 02:40:43.155]  I don't think I can give you his own phone numbers.
[02:40:43.835 --> 02:40:49.760]  You can go to gregpowles.com and email him if you want to try to get in contact with him.
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.503]  I'm not in a position to give out our guests' phone numbers unless they want them given out.
[02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:57.993]  Let's talk to Stanford in New Jersey.
[02:40:58.033 --> 02:40:58.874]  Stanford, go ahead.
[02:40:59.114 --> 02:40:59.774]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:41:00.015 --> 02:41:00.355]  Good, sir.
[02:41:00.735 --> 02:41:00.955]  Good.
[02:41:01.075 --> 02:41:03.237]  Yeah, I was just, first of all, I wanted to ask you this question.
[02:41:03.317 --> 02:41:06.319]  Is Pat Robertson a Mason?
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:08.481]  Yes, he's a devil worshipper.
[02:41:08.881 --> 02:41:09.202]  Okay.
[02:41:10.202 --> 02:41:16.968]  Also, I wanted to say, I'm starting to now, I just basically started getting on your website
[02:41:17.972 --> 02:41:23.196]  And it's like, I'm starting to see this picture of what's been going on.
[02:41:49.073 --> 02:41:51.655]  That may hurt people's feelings when I say it.
[02:41:51.696 --> 02:41:57.000]  He is a high-level Mason, and the higher-level Masons know who they're worshipping.
[02:41:57.020 --> 02:41:57.601]  It's Lucifer.
[02:41:57.641 --> 02:42:00.744]  He's on the lion's paw on the cover of Time Magazine.
[02:42:00.764 --> 02:42:01.645]  That's on my website.
[02:42:01.665 --> 02:42:03.186]  That is a very satanic signal.
[02:42:03.987 --> 02:42:04.888]  That's no accident.
[02:42:05.748 --> 02:42:08.031]  He tells us George Bush is good.
[02:42:08.051 --> 02:42:10.573]  His dad was a World Bank chief.
[02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:15.941]  He pushes a faith-based initiative.
[02:42:15.961 --> 02:42:17.603]  The Fed's taking over the churches.
[02:42:17.863 --> 02:42:26.712]  And, let me add this, Pat Robertson said, and I quote, China's doing the right thing with its aggressive Planned Parenthood.
[02:42:26.732 --> 02:42:28.854]  You know, what are they going to do?
[02:42:28.914 --> 02:42:30.555]  They've got to do what they're doing.
[02:42:30.896 --> 02:42:33.098]  When he was asked, is forced abortion good?
[02:42:33.118 --> 02:42:34.459]  That was his answer.
[02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:38.233]  And I'm sorry folks, forced abortion is satanic.
[02:42:38.453 --> 02:42:39.333]  Don't be, don't be.
[02:42:39.434 --> 02:42:39.714]  Look, look.
[02:42:40.034 --> 02:42:46.059]  You, for me, you have uncovered, you've pointed to the wolf for me here, you know?
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:48.441]  I didn't realize all this stuff was going on.
[02:42:48.481 --> 02:42:51.103]  We're a bunch of lambs out here, you know what I mean?
[02:42:51.444 --> 02:42:53.105]  We're not watching or paying attention.
[02:42:53.145 --> 02:42:57.649]  I say that what you're doing, I want to commend you for opening my eyes.
[02:42:57.709 --> 02:42:58.850]  I've only been looking for a week.
[02:42:58.930 --> 02:42:59.951]  I can't get any sleep.
[02:43:00.031 --> 02:43:01.052]  I'm on that thing all night.
[02:43:01.576 --> 02:43:04.897]  I'm looking at all the stuff about what happened in New York.
[02:43:04.977 --> 02:43:06.778]  I'm looking real close at the images.
[02:43:06.858 --> 02:43:09.759]  I see what did Building 7 go down for?
[02:43:10.139 --> 02:43:12.900]  I'm looking at the two Twin Towers.
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:15.320]  I'm looking at the puffs of smoke on each side.
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:16.601]  Then I look at Building 7.
[02:43:16.961 --> 02:43:20.842]  I see the same puffs of smoke in the same location.
[02:43:20.982 --> 02:43:22.142]  What's this all about?
[02:43:22.363 --> 02:43:23.963]  One cannot be told about the Matrix.
[02:43:24.083 --> 02:43:24.783]  One must see it.
[02:43:25.604 --> 02:43:26.044]  You're right.
[02:43:26.324 --> 02:43:27.444]  You took the red pill.
[02:43:27.504 --> 02:43:28.464]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:43:28.745 --> 02:43:30.005]  They're all a bunch of bums.
[02:43:30.985 --> 02:43:32.045]  I'm just going to say this.
[02:43:32.065 --> 02:43:38.747]  I don't know who's listening out there, but Jesus Christ is Lord, and he's going to bust every last one of them.
[02:43:39.287 --> 02:43:40.708]  And I just thank the Lord for you.
[02:43:41.488 --> 02:43:43.788]  Well, I thank the Lord for you as well, and you're absolutely right.
[02:43:43.828 --> 02:43:45.389]  God is going to crush these people.
[02:43:45.729 --> 02:43:47.169]  Look, we ain't going to win.
[02:43:47.209 --> 02:43:47.569]  You're right.
[02:43:47.609 --> 02:43:48.430]  I want to encourage you.
[02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:50.290]  This nation is for the Lord.
[02:43:50.310 --> 02:43:52.051]  This belongs to God.
[02:43:53.551 --> 02:43:53.911]  Nothing.
[02:43:54.411 --> 02:43:57.012]  Well, it always gets darkest before the dawn.
[02:43:57.748 --> 02:44:01.452]  And God needs us to stand up and wake others up so they can find the truth.
[02:44:01.572 --> 02:44:08.498]  Our job is to put the information out so people like you, whose hearts and minds are in the right direction, can get the full picture.
[02:44:08.818 --> 02:44:15.224]  I'm telling you, if any Christians that I know knew this information, they'd be, I'm mad!
[02:44:15.244 --> 02:44:16.325]  You could hear it in me.
[02:44:16.878 --> 02:44:21.380]  But a lot of them, though, are delusional and they don't have the same spirit you've got.
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:22.980]  They'll just laugh at us.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.622]  A strong delusion has been sent to them and they can't see the truth.
[02:44:28.662 --> 02:44:30.203]  Hey, I appreciate your call, Stanford.
[02:44:30.223 --> 02:44:35.504]  Keep calling in and I'm glad that for a week you found out about this stuff and that you're awake and you're taking action.
[02:44:36.005 --> 02:44:37.485]  That's the kind of call I like.
[02:44:37.505 --> 02:44:42.167]  It's somebody who's angry, who's got that tremor in their voice, who sees this for what it is.
[02:44:42.827 --> 02:44:44.448]  That's the natural response.
[02:44:44.548 --> 02:44:45.528]  Don't let yourself get
[02:44:47.170 --> 02:44:49.811]  Get acclimated to where you finally start accepting this stuff.
[02:44:50.212 --> 02:44:52.193]  That's the danger of a broadcast like this.
[02:44:52.733 --> 02:44:55.414]  When you do this as long as I've done it, you know, you start getting used to it.
[02:44:55.975 --> 02:45:00.417]  You know, each new horrible revelation doesn't get you as angry as the last because you're so used to it.
[02:45:02.398 --> 02:45:04.159]  Keep that fresh indignance.
[02:45:04.219 --> 02:45:05.620]  Keep that fresh anger.
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:09.502]  You know, the same type of anger that Christ had when he whipped the money changers.
[02:45:09.922 --> 02:45:10.682]  That's what we need.
[02:45:11.083 --> 02:45:12.063]  Michael in Florida.
[02:45:12.123 --> 02:45:12.964]  Michael, you're on the air.
[02:45:13.004 --> 02:45:13.364]  Go ahead.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:16.941]  Okay, well, Michael's not there.
[02:45:16.961 --> 02:45:17.661]  We'll go to Russell.
[02:45:18.081 --> 02:45:18.781]  Go ahead, Russell.
[02:45:19.041 --> 02:45:19.562]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:19.622 --> 02:45:20.362]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:45:20.422 --> 02:45:21.002]  It's been a while.
[02:45:21.342 --> 02:45:22.043]  Good to talk to you.
[02:45:23.123 --> 02:45:24.223]  Got some good news.
[02:45:24.243 --> 02:45:25.284]  You talk about that anger.
[02:45:25.924 --> 02:45:34.507]  The anger that I have been able to build up against the New World Order has enabled me to wake a lot of people up using your information.
[02:45:35.208 --> 02:45:39.649]  And I also have a radio program that I'm going to be on here.
[02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:41.050]  Actually, not on.
[02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:42.390]  It's going to be my radio program.
[02:45:42.410 --> 02:45:43.631]  It's going to be two hours a week.
[02:45:44.369 --> 02:45:46.411]  And I'd love to have you on as a guest.
[02:45:46.431 --> 02:45:46.671]  Sure.
[02:45:46.791 --> 02:45:49.813]  Just email us or contact us.
[02:45:49.853 --> 02:45:50.474]  I'll be glad to.
[02:45:50.914 --> 02:45:51.514]  Absolutely.
[02:45:52.335 --> 02:45:56.078]  Regarding George Norrie, you're going to be in studio with him on Friday.
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:02.583]  I don't know how to say this, but you have to impress upon him that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:46:05.323 --> 02:46:06.223]  George is a good guy.
[02:46:06.424 --> 02:46:06.884]  You know him.
[02:46:07.625 --> 02:46:09.086]  He has me on to say it.
[02:46:09.366 --> 02:46:11.268]  I guess that's probably what it is.
[02:46:11.348 --> 02:46:14.651]  He has other people on to... George has got his own views.
[02:46:14.691 --> 02:46:18.794]  Look, that's a venue to reach the people and he does not censor.
[02:46:19.115 --> 02:46:20.616]  I can't complain.
[02:46:21.637 --> 02:46:22.518]  It is wonderful.
[02:46:22.558 --> 02:46:24.099]  I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:25.520]  No, I agree.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:26.081]  I agree.
[02:46:26.121 --> 02:46:27.982]  But somehow impress upon him
[02:46:29.398 --> 02:46:32.080]  People are waking up and we have a lot to be thankful for.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:35.662]  I wanted you to make a comment on these articles I read in the Sentinel.
[02:46:53.615 --> 02:46:57.258]  Did you read anything about the, it was an AP article, U.S.
[02:46:57.298 --> 02:46:58.999]  won't fumigate Afghan poppies?
[02:46:59.039 --> 02:47:00.700]  Did you see that article?
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:18.673]  Well, I mean, they went from a couple thousand tons to, you know, just ten times that amount in opium producing for heroin, and it's all being grown, and the only thing that gets sprayed is somebody who didn't pay their cut, and our government publicly ships the opium out.
[02:47:18.713 --> 02:47:19.834]  I mean, it's not even debatable.
[02:47:20.253 --> 02:47:22.295]  They're using Wall Street to funnel the government.
[02:47:22.315 --> 02:47:29.421]  And then it comes out in the newspapers that, hey, our government runs these fields, there's nothing we're going to do about it, ha ha ha, but we're going to SWAT team your house looking for it.
[02:47:29.881 --> 02:47:30.101]  Right.
[02:47:30.942 --> 02:47:37.648]  And then one other article is, there was a report that came out by RAND that says, guarding planes against missiles, too costly.
[02:47:37.668 --> 02:47:40.070]  Yeah, we've got to put missile defenses on.
[02:47:40.090 --> 02:47:40.871]  Yeah.
[02:47:40.891 --> 02:47:45.455]  You talk about the Fox Guard and the Hent House, the RAND Corporation, you talk about evil.
[02:47:46.355 --> 02:47:46.836]  Absolutely.
[02:47:47.324 --> 02:47:49.125]  Well, they're saying it's too costly.
[02:47:49.285 --> 02:47:51.507]  You know who the most evil corporation is though, right?
[02:47:52.908 --> 02:47:56.090]  It's not the private Federal Reserve, it's IBM.
[02:47:57.310 --> 02:47:58.091]  You want to talk about that?
[02:47:58.231 --> 02:48:02.814]  The top of the pyramid, it's international business machines, my friend.
[02:48:03.054 --> 02:48:06.116]  You think that's more evil than the private Federal Reserve, huh?
[02:48:06.576 --> 02:48:15.602]  I'm telling you, every time we look, as top strategists involved in everything, you want to talk about just one of the main heads, the biggest, fattest,
[02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.566]  Grizzliest looking head on the Hydra's IBM.
[02:48:18.586 --> 02:48:20.027]  Hey, God bless you Alex.
[02:48:20.067 --> 02:48:20.347]  Thank you.
[02:48:20.367 --> 02:48:21.027]  Alright, thank you.
[02:48:21.067 --> 02:48:21.907]  I appreciate the call.
[02:48:21.927 --> 02:48:26.248]  I mean, it's just... a bottomless pit of wickedness.
[02:48:27.788 --> 02:48:29.748]  But it's the main family of the Bohemian Rove.
[02:48:29.828 --> 02:48:32.109]  It's, uh... Mr. Watson.
[02:48:32.889 --> 02:48:34.409]  I like all the pictures of him with Hitler.
[02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:40.410]  They came up with a whole numbering system for the Jews, and they're behind the national ID card here.
[02:48:41.571 --> 02:48:43.331]  They've numbered your genes, the number of a man.
[02:48:44.457 --> 02:48:45.958]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:46.158 --> 02:48:49.240]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:53.282]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.322 --> 02:48:57.564]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:57.905 --> 02:49:01.687]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:01.767 --> 02:49:03.628]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:03.888 --> 02:49:07.112]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:07.172 --> 02:49:11.877]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.037 --> 02:49:15.080]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.260 --> 02:49:18.124]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:18.624 --> 02:49:24.731]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.251 --> 02:49:29.056]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:43.593 --> 02:49:46.615]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:46.915 --> 02:49:51.858]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:52.098 --> 02:49:56.460]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:56.761 --> 02:50:05.666]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:05.886 --> 02:50:09.488]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:09.788 --> 02:50:14.810]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:21.833]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:22.314 --> 02:50:22.854]  What about you?

[02:51:51.116 --> 02:51:52.216]  Alright, in the news.
[02:51:52.897 --> 02:51:56.778]  Developed world births falling to new record levels, BBC.
[02:51:59.079 --> 02:52:09.683]  Within 100 years, the white population will be 2% of the world population and perhaps not even exist.
[02:52:11.563 --> 02:52:11.923]  Okay.
[02:52:13.124 --> 02:52:16.165]  Sounds like genocide to me, but I guess it's good if you're not for it.
[02:52:17.731 --> 02:52:23.816]  Bush arrested, oh I'm having Freudian slips here, boys arrested for stick figure drawings.
[02:52:23.836 --> 02:52:25.978]  I actually just had a Freudian slip, I just said Bush arrested.
[02:52:26.458 --> 02:52:27.819]  I literally just spurted that out.
[02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:31.142]  It's boys arrested for stick figure drawings.
[02:52:31.903 --> 02:52:37.968]  AP, two boys were arrested for making pencil and crayon stick figure drawings depicting a ten year old classmate being stabbed and hung.
[02:52:38.448 --> 02:52:42.952]  Police said the children charged with felony were taken from school in handcuffs instead of just getting a paddling.
[02:52:44.167 --> 02:52:48.710]  The nine and ten year old boys were arrested Monday and charged with making a written threat to kill and harm another person.
[02:52:50.011 --> 02:52:53.854]  And, uh, another drawing showed a stick figure hanging, tears falling from their eyes.
[02:52:56.736 --> 02:53:01.539]  Folks, I never drew stuff like that, but I drew army tanks and soldiers fighting.
[02:53:01.559 --> 02:53:02.200]  I think we all did.
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.361]  And I hear cases of kids being arrested for that.
[02:53:04.381 --> 02:53:08.644]  Uh, you know, a kid jokes and says, I'm gonna hijack the school bus when they're ten.
[02:53:08.664 --> 02:53:10.045]  They arrest them, charge them as a terrorist.
[02:53:10.345 --> 02:53:11.066]  This is dumb!
[02:53:11.707 --> 02:53:21.274]  And then the kids go home and watch violent TV, play video games where they do all this, and that's all alright, but then when you show it in any art form, then you go to jail as a terrorist.
[02:53:22.655 --> 02:53:26.158]  A British citizen subject to curfews, tagging under new terror powers.
[02:53:26.718 --> 02:53:38.227]  Associated Press, the British government announced Wednesday, proposed sweeping new powers to control suspected terrorists, including electronic tagging, curfews, and house arrest of people who have not been convicted of crimes, all part of the new freedom.
[02:53:38.928 --> 02:53:39.348]  36 U.S.
[02:53:39.589 --> 02:53:42.751]  troops died just a few days ago in one day, 20-something yesterday.
[02:53:43.392 --> 02:53:45.394]  I mean, it's getting really, really bad.
[02:53:45.514 --> 02:53:47.515]  FBI says Boston threat of false alarm.
[02:53:47.535 --> 02:53:50.298]  That's after they fear-mongered and trained you how to be a slave.
[02:53:51.058 --> 02:53:54.101]  ID scheme to track students progresses, the advertiser.
[02:53:54.521 --> 02:53:57.364]  It says all their data, all their information will be on the ID cards.
[02:53:57.684 --> 02:54:01.447]  This trains the kids for your new national ID card to be your report card to the world.
[02:54:02.068 --> 02:54:04.470]  They'll have to swipe it to see what your threat assessment is.
[02:54:05.194 --> 02:54:07.676]  Quit smoking or lose your job, U.S.
[02:54:07.736 --> 02:54:08.337]  company says.
[02:54:08.357 --> 02:54:09.157]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:54:09.978 --> 02:54:18.505]  I've heard neocons on the air going, yeah, fire people if they smoke, or fire them if they don't take a drug test for smoking.
[02:54:20.447 --> 02:54:30.696]  Oh, it's so good, but the problem is, then it's going to be for eating too much beef, or eating too much cheese, or drug tests to see if you drank alcohol in the last month.
[02:54:31.477 --> 02:54:39.058]  I've seen articles where they fire cops who are caught smoking cigars at parties in Florida because it's illegal for a cop to smoke.
[02:54:39.098 --> 02:54:40.519]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[02:54:41.679 --> 02:54:46.260]  The push for mass double-think, Bush targets tyranny, the Boston Herald told it like it was.
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:49.000]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:49.861 --> 02:54:53.241]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:54:53.841 --> 02:54:56.162]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:54:56.202 --> 02:54:57.562]  And yes, on George Norrie tomorrow,
[02:54:58.072 --> 02:55:02.776]  We're at least three hours, maybe four, I haven't been told yet, from live in studio here in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:03.517 --> 02:55:19.831]  I would encourage all of you out there to stop procrastinating, to visit InfoWars.com if you're online, to look at the huge shopping cart, the SecureSafe shopping cart, to look at all the films I carry, all the films I've made, the books, the t-shirts, the books on tape, get my videos, make copies of them,
[02:55:20.501 --> 02:55:24.866]  You want to know the truth about 9-11 or about the occult rituals of the elite or about the police state?
[02:55:25.346 --> 02:55:28.730]  These are the videos you need and that your friends and family and neighbors need.
[02:55:29.171 --> 02:55:33.516]  Call a free number to order if you don't want to go to m4wars.com or don't have a computer.
[02:55:33.536 --> 02:55:33.616]  1-888-253-3139-888.
[02:55:41.254 --> 02:55:42.054]  253-3139.
[02:55:45.496 --> 02:55:47.476]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[02:55:47.496 --> 02:55:58.701]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:56:00.582 --> 02:56:02.883]  You can just decide to lay down to all this, or you can fight it.
[02:56:03.983 --> 02:56:08.685]  And the Globalists are arrogant, they're moving forward, but they've created a mass awakening.
[02:56:09.733 --> 02:56:10.493]  We have reaction.
[02:56:10.513 --> 02:56:11.994]  There's an equal or greater reaction.
[02:56:12.454 --> 02:56:13.935]  We're going to win this thing with God's help.
[02:56:13.975 --> 02:56:14.635]  So take action.
[02:56:14.655 --> 02:56:15.275]  Get the films.
