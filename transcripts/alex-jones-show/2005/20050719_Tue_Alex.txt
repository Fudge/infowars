[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.340]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.041]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:09.903]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:11.363]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:13.004]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:17.607]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:21.950]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:40.175]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:42.456]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:45.037]  It's already July 19th, 2005.
[00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.619]  Already seven plus months into this year.
[00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.922]  Before you know it, it'll be 2006, and I'm just now getting used to saying 2005.
[00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.516]  All right, my friends.
[00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:08.318]  There is just a ton of really important news today.
[00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.540]  And I'm going to jump right into the middle of it right now.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.401]  But we're also going to have open phones.
[00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:24.924]  And I'm going to limit each caller to about 60 seconds, maybe 90 seconds, so we have time to go to the next person.
[00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.365]  And I'm getting better and better about doing this.
[00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:44.186]  I get so many complaints that people can never get through, or they're on eternal hold, that we are just going to basically explode through your phone calls, but that means that even if you're making incredibly good points, I'm going to have to move on.
[00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:50.811]  Patriot Act reauthorization is set to pass the House.
[00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:54.353]  Congressman Ron Paul's office has notified InfoWars.com
[00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:02.751]  The Patriot Act reauthorization is set to pass the House on Thursday or Friday.
[00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:13.199]  As things stand now, there may be even less votes against the legislation this time than for the vote that was held back on October 27, 2001.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.684]  So we'll give you more information on this when we get back from break.
[00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:24.328]  Two-thirds believe London bombings are linked to Iraq war.
[00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:31.468]  And Tony Blair says, how dare people say this, that there's no connection to the Iraq War?
[00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:50.076]  Well, even if you buy the fraudulent pretext that terrorists are attacking because the Muslim countries, the Middle Eastern countries, are being attacked, even if you buy into that fraud, certainly it's connected to Iraq.
[00:02:50.825 --> 00:03:02.633]  But when you know the truth about the bombings, and it's conclusive, it's a government operation, when you know the truth about the bombings, then of course it's tied to Iraq.
[00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:08.737]  It's meant to bolster support and legitimize these invasions.
[00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:10.318]  And Bush's approval ratings are up.
[00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:11.980]  Though they're still pretty low.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.801]  Blair's approval ratings are up.
[00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:27.091]  All these headlines about how the police state agenda is sailing ahead now, hitting calm waters, whereas before, a typhoon hurricane of public outrage was blowing them into the rocks.
[00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.534]  There, there's the maritime analogy for the day.
[00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:39.220]  With a hurricane steaming towards Texas right now, about to slam into us.
[00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:40.960]  One of many.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.203]  They're saying it's going to be a horrible hurricane season this year.
[00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:46.684]  They just get worse and worse.
[00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.387]  For what, like the last nine years in a row?
[00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:58.249]  Gonna have, what, 139% of the average hurricane season?
[00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:58.989]  39% over average.
[00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.010]  That's pretty serious.
[00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.312]  So we'll talk a little bit about that as well.
[00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:09.977]  Speaking of the Weather Channel, they got paid off by the government to put out global warming propaganda.
[00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:13.480]  Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.303]  Al Nasher, I challenge you to find bomb links.
[00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:19.004]  That's in the London Mirror.
[00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.565]  He's saying he has no connection to it.
[00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:23.524]  Suicide theory thrown into doubt.
[00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:24.825]  This is out of the Herald Sun.
[00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:32.888]  We now have the Herald Sun, the Mirror, and the Independent saying something doesn't fit.
[00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:39.251]  And now Scotland Yard saying maybe Al-Qaeda tricked them into carrying those explosives on.
[00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.171]  Al-Qaeda did.
[00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.332]  Sure it did.
[00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:44.873]  Al-Qaeda did do this.
[00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:46.774]  Al-Qaeda is CIA.
[00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:49.238]  Al-Qaeda is globalist.
[00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:49.959]  I agree!
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.863]  Al-Qaeda did do this.
[00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:52.444]  Yes!
[00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:53.045]  Yes!
[00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:55.790]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.752]  There's so much news.
[00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.936]  Some news on thumb scanning, biometrics.
[00:04:58.956 --> 00:04:59.357]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:04.795]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:06.757]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:12.704]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:18.190]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem, reaction, solution.
[00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.673]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:26.616]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:31.500]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.362]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:37.864]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.726]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:00.005]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:09.625]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.303]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:14.265]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:24.669]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:27.170]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.571]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.231]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:39.834]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:41.834]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:53.938]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:54.438 --> 00:07:58.779]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:08:02.344 --> 00:08:08.388]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.030]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:24.858]  I want to go over the intensifying fear-mongering that's all over Fox and CNN and World Net Daily.
[00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:26.619]  It's just everywhere.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.861]  Nukes are going to go off any minute.
[00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.842]  Al-Qaeda is going to kill us.
[00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:35.839]  And only a total police state can save you.
[00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:46.826]  And quite frankly, if there are any nuclear attacks, any detonations in this country, we know exactly who to blame.
[00:08:47.707 --> 00:08:58.594]  And I did get a copy of the declassified portion of PDD-60, and I have several news articles that were written about PDD-60 back in the late 1990s that I want to go over.
[00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:04.701]  Because the government says, give up all your freedoms or they're going to nuke you.
[00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:12.587]  Meanwhile, they've ordered our Strategic Missile Command, NORAD, to stand down.
[00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:18.671]  To absorb a strike, just like I guess they did on 9-11 with the aircraft.
[00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:24.137]  So we'll go over that to also just massive developments.
[00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:45.665]  It is now confirmed this time from a top spy chief in Israel, not just by Israeli radio, Israeli newspapers, not just by intelligence agencies and private intelligence groups in this country, now by the Israeli government, it is confirmed Netanyahu was warned.
[00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:52.771]  We also have the British people in polls thinking that things are suspicious concerning the bombings.
[00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:57.854]  A bunch of news articles, mainstream, reporting that these guys don't fit the M.O.
[00:09:57.894 --> 00:10:03.056]  of suicide bombers and that they think somebody tricked them into carrying those bombs on board.
[00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:08.939]  It's all coming up today.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.342]  But I meant to get to this yesterday and I get so busy I didn't cover it.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.864]  And it's very, very important.
[00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:20.811]  This is out of Local 6, Orlando, Florida.
[00:10:21.232 --> 00:10:24.939]  Finger scanning at Disney Parks causes concern.
[00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:36.618]  The addition of finger scanning technology at the entrances of Walt Disney World theme parks for all visitors has caused concern among privacy advocates according to local 6 News report.
[00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:45.241]  Tourists visiting Disney theme parks in Central Florida must now provide their index and middle fingers to be scanned before entering the front gates.
[00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:51.202]  The scans were formerly for season passes holders, but now everyone must provide their fingers.
[00:10:51.362 --> 00:10:51.582]  See?
[00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:53.563]  You can't just go buy a ticket and get in.
[00:10:54.326 --> 00:11:02.507]  Local 6 News reports, they have reportedly been phased in for all ticket holders during the past six months according to the report.
[00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:11.009]  Now why this is important is, first they put in self-checkout, then they take out all of the service checkout.
[00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:17.170]  And then they put in thumb scanners and you've got a thumb scan at Home Depot or at HEB.
[00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.491]  Or at Kroger.
[00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:22.431]  At different test stores around the country.
[00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:30.650]  First they tell you you've got to get a license to own that gun, then they just don't issue the license.
[00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.111]  It's the same MO.
[00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:40.596]  First they put in hand scanners that scan the entire hand at SeaWorld, and I've gotten the report in now that they are next season.
[00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:43.838]  They're going to make you do it as well.
[00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:46.780]  Sorry, you don't do it, you don't get into the theme park.
[00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:55.247]  I have reports and I have even the policies from here in Austin of major tanning salons, major health club chains.
[00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:01.331]  In places like England, if you want to check out a book at the library, you've got to do it.
[00:12:01.672 --> 00:12:04.294]  Now they're starting it here, but oh, it's just voluntary.
[00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:06.315]  You can check out more books if you do this.
[00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:08.497]  Then they phase it in and make you do it.
[00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:25.264]  And here it is, from theory to practice, from us warning you about this a decade ago, reading the government documents and their plan for the Cashless Society Taxation Surveillance Grid, to actuality, to implementation, to everyday life.
[00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:29.166]  And this will be integrated with the National Sales Tax.
[00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:35.330]  You will have to swipe your card and provide a biometric face scan or thumbprint or index finger.
[00:12:38.965 --> 00:12:44.907]  The final, of course, plan of all of this is, if you're not a good globalist, it'll just be like the no-fly list.
[00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:49.049]  In fact, Patriot Act 1 says it.
[00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:59.652]  That if you cash a check for somebody on a criminal watch list, much less a terror watch list, you get many years in prison and a million dollar fine.
[00:13:01.793 --> 00:13:07.195]  And if you don't believe me on this, just type into Google, Patriot Act Compliance.
[00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.297]  And you will get hundreds of thousands of active links.
[00:13:11.497 --> 00:13:12.558]  Why will you get that many?
[00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:27.988]  Because everything from used car salesmen, to bed salesmen, to furniture salesmen, to the banks, to check cashing outfits, to credit card companies, everybody's having to comply.
[00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:29.049]  And how do they comply?
[00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:33.932]  They run your name through the NCIC database
[00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:53.910]  And if you're on a terror watch list, even if you haven't been convicted, or a criminal watch list that's already being expanded to over half a million itself, 300 plus thousand on the terror list, then if they do services with you, if they render services, they are now terrorists and go straight to jail.
[00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:54.990]  What is it?
[00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.552]  Five years and a million dollar fine?
[00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:00.915]  And it goes up to ten years and a million and a half dollar fine?
[00:14:01.767 --> 00:14:04.830]  And so all over the country, check cashing places closed their doors.
[00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:08.653]  And said, we can't do this anymore.
[00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:11.916]  I mean, we can't run these database checks.
[00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:14.758]  So, that's what this will be about.
[00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:23.045]  Understand, that if you don't boycott everybody who's putting this in, it will then be put in everywhere, and then you won't have a choice.
[00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:27.269]  And then the taxation, the regulation, the tracking will begin.
[00:14:28.843 --> 00:14:44.407]  How the grocery stores are already starting to do this, some test markets, up in upstate New York, California, it's happening all over, is if you thumbprint, you get a discount of 10-20% on your purchases.
[00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:58.070]  Well, just two weeks ago I read the article out of Missouri, where a bunch of their different mini-marts, it was a Phillips 66 marts, are now putting in
[00:14:59.873 --> 00:15:00.733]  Thumb scanners.
[00:15:01.553 --> 00:15:06.414]  And when you thumb scan, you've got to thumb scan to cash checks.
[00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:12.436]  And in these small towns, you know, these mini-marts are basically like the bank.
[00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:14.776]  Unless somebody wants to drive 50 miles.
[00:15:15.736 --> 00:15:19.777]  But now, just if you use the thumbprint, they're going to give you a discount.
[00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:21.077]  Period.
[00:15:21.757 --> 00:15:23.158]  So see, it's already begun.
[00:15:23.198 --> 00:15:24.678]  Well, it's like Chicago.
[00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:32.627]  They put in toll roads on most of the major roads, and then said, if you take a transponder, it's $2 to go through the major toll.
[00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:34.507]  If you don't have a transponder, it's $4.
[00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:52.772]  And on the first day of the new program, 2 million people attempted around the state, but it's mainly in Chicago, but it's a statewide program, to get into the DMVs, or into the private facilities, selling the transponders to get them.
[00:15:53.675 --> 00:16:07.257]  And then, of course, New York's talking about, and Texas is talking about, well, the bill was introduced this year, we barely beat it, but they're back in session right now, they may be trying to pass it again, to put a transponder on all inspection stickers, and you just won't have a choice, and then you won't get that discount.
[00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:16.279]  So they use different carrot and stick ways of doing this, and the control grid is almost in place right now.
[00:16:17.599 --> 00:16:21.460]  And if you are not a good globalist, you will not be allowed to buy food,
[00:16:22.717 --> 00:16:35.481]  And you will not be allowed to travel, your car will not even start, or even if you have an old car, if the transponder readers are not reading you as you drive, you will be immediately pulled over.
[00:16:36.422 --> 00:16:48.466]  And in the Texas law, it was going to be a felony if they could prove that you had purposefully disassembled, that is,
[00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:53.564]  Shut down or disabled your transponder.
[00:16:53.604 --> 00:16:58.466]  We have that posted on InfoWars.com if you are doubting us.
[00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:01.607]  Folks, it's here.
[00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:05.329]  The theme parks, the tanning salons, the grocery stores.
[00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:09.191]  I mean a tanning salon literally a mile from my house.
[00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.951]  I don't have a membership there, but one of my neighbors said, look at this, Alex.
[00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:18.712]  And he showed me that they said, yes, you must thumb scan to have a membership here.
[00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:33.016]  And another person, when I was showing Marshall Lobb a few weeks ago at the Alamo Draft House, he came up and gave me the paperwork for another big chain where, well, they just encourage you to enroll and then you get the discount.
[00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:36.397]  So it's happening right now.
[00:17:36.937 --> 00:17:38.698]  And I have warned you for so long.
[00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:39.558]  Here is the clip.
[00:17:40.562 --> 00:17:43.624]  Uh, from, uh, News 6 out of Orlando.
[00:17:44.445 --> 00:17:52.410]  This new finger scanning technique will not only move people through the gate faster, it will also crack down on people who try to share their tickets or use stolen tickets.
[00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:58.474]  Disney has started the scanning trend, Universal, Orlando, and SeaWorld say they plan to follow suit before the end of the year.
[00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:03.477]  Now, it works by scanning, really, the ridges and structure of your index finger and middle finger.
[00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:05.559]  They refer to it as, uh, finger geometry.
[00:18:05.939 --> 00:18:13.268]  It does not take your fingerprint, just in a sense your finger measurement, information that will not be used or collected in any numerical way.
[00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:18.434]  But privacy advocates like the Civil Liberties Union say this borders on a violation of privacy.
[00:18:18.494 --> 00:18:24.021]  They're worried about what it could mean to have this kind of information on the thousands of people who frequent Disney theme parks.
[00:18:24.401 --> 00:18:36.810]  The collecting of this finger tip information and how it's to be used and what the source of that information is as it relates to, you know, what will it show, I don't like it and we're going to look into it.
[00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.334]  Now Disney officials of course stressing the fact that these do not take fingerprints or collect any personal information on their customers.
[00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:47.677]  We'll hear more from Disney officials coming up at 6 o'clock, also more from piracy advocates.
[00:18:47.978 --> 00:18:51.380]  But for now we're reporting from the Magic Kingdom, Jessica Sanchez, Mobile 6.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.641]  Alright, thank you Jessica.
[00:18:53.314 --> 00:18:55.275]  Disney officials!
[00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:56.975]  Man, and we're the slaves.
[00:18:57.556 --> 00:19:00.357]  That is the biggest lie I've ever heard in my life.
[00:19:00.377 --> 00:19:03.077]  It is a script.
[00:19:03.778 --> 00:19:04.958]  That is word for word.
[00:19:05.038 --> 00:19:09.980]  I have a clip in Police State 3 Total Enslavement from a local K.I.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.821]  piece where they go, oh, H.E.B.
[00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:28.726]  Uh, in areas of College Station in Houston, is putting in thumb scanners, but don't worry, it doesn't take your fingerprint, it just takes a, well, the exact same thing that she just said, the stem plate, and so don't worry, it's not a fingerprint.
[00:19:30.027 --> 00:19:39.232]  That's like saying the digital photo you took of your daughter last week, that you uploaded onto your PC, that's like saying it's not a picture of your daughter.
[00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:40.833]  It's zeros and ones.
[00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:44.519]  It is your fingerprint.
[00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:46.501]  It reads your fingerprint.
[00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:51.964]  This is not a fingerprint.
[00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:54.466]  This is not an assault.
[00:19:54.546 --> 00:19:55.707]  This is not a New World Order.
[00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.708]  We're not taking your rights.
[00:19:58.509 --> 00:19:59.950]  We never said they were WMDs.
[00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:08.152]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.372 --> 00:20:13.434]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:20:13.694 --> 00:20:21.597]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.757 --> 00:20:28.799]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.220]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.782]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:33.822 --> 00:20:34.943]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:35.223 --> 00:20:36.524]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:20:36.724 --> 00:20:43.549]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:46.171]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:50.273]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625
[00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.357]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:08.599]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:11.621]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.222]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.402 --> 00:21:23.045]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:24.586]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:28.968]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.268 --> 00:21:29.588]  I think so.
[00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:06.952]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:15.177]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:23.361]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.681 --> 00:22:28.425]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:33.489]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.989 --> 00:22:37.852]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:39.354]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.434 --> 00:22:43.477]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.917 --> 00:22:48.301]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:51.383]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.824 --> 00:22:53.485]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:53.825]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:03.317]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:23:03.537 --> 00:23:05.339]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:09.202]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:23:09.482 --> 00:23:12.905]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, Reishi.
[00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:17.429]  A concentration of six species of red mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[00:23:17.569 --> 00:23:21.453]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:23:21.753 --> 00:23:25.434]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:30.436]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:35.597]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[00:23:35.757 --> 00:23:38.138]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[00:23:38.378 --> 00:23:41.279]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:44.763]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.
[00:23:44.943 --> 00:23:46.385]  Try Gano Cafe today.

[00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:10.002]  We're going to get into a lot of new developments.
[00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:12.382]  Big developments with the London bombings.
[00:24:12.622 --> 00:24:13.663]  What's happening in Iraq.
[00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:15.103]  What's happening with Karl Rove.
[00:24:15.763 --> 00:24:16.843]  That big distraction.
[00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:21.104]  The Communist Chinese threatening to nuke us.
[00:24:22.464 --> 00:24:26.125]  The mainstream media fear mongering though that Al Qaeda is going to nuke us.
[00:24:28.046 --> 00:24:29.746]  Your calls though are coming up here in a second.
[00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:31.426]  But we're at the crossroads.
[00:24:31.446 --> 00:24:33.727]  Do you understand that this is the choice?
[00:24:34.935 --> 00:24:57.874]  Whether it's Universal Studios, or whether it's Six Flags now at some of their parks, or whether it's Disney theme parks, or SeaWorld, when you go and you try to get in, a six month pass is less than a one day ticket if you biometrically scan.
[00:24:57.954 --> 00:25:02.198]  And I put it in that report I did two years ago on SeaWorld,
[00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:09.241]  In that video report that's on Infowars.com, in fact, we ought to find that and just play the audio from that on the show.
[00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:13.462]  I said, you watch, soon you won't have a choice.
[00:25:14.943 --> 00:25:17.124]  This is how you domesticate animals.
[00:25:18.544 --> 00:25:18.924]  Okay?
[00:25:18.964 --> 00:25:28.448]  You just, first you feed the horse, you get it to come up close to you, then you, once it's trained to come into the pen, you close the gate, then you domesticate it slowly.
[00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:32.550]  That's all they're doing is domesticating us, breaking us.
[00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:35.010]  And then now, Disney!
[00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.151]  You don't have a choice!
[00:25:39.173 --> 00:25:46.378]  Oh, I wish somebody'd go up there with a camera, dressed up like a tourist, and, uh, argue with them.
[00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:52.822]  By the way, what they do is they sell you the ticket, and then go, okay, go right over here to get your ID!
[00:25:52.842 --> 00:25:54.503]  They don't even tell you, by the way.
[00:25:54.964 --> 00:25:56.064]  They don't even give you the choice.
[00:25:56.084 --> 00:25:59.527]  When you go up there to the window, they go, you know, 50 bucks for one day!
[00:26:00.277 --> 00:26:02.722]  Or $45 for six months.
[00:26:03.143 --> 00:26:05.848]  Gee, you go, I'll take the six months then.
[00:26:06.449 --> 00:26:07.811]  It's so manipulative.
[00:26:07.831 --> 00:26:11.919]  And then they direct you over to the building and you go over there.
[00:26:12.751 --> 00:26:15.712]  And okay, I'm going to need you to scan your hand right here.
[00:26:15.912 --> 00:26:17.932]  Don't worry sir, it's not a fingerprint.
[00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:20.693]  All we do is get some numbers from your hand.
[00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:32.436]  Well yes, you take a scan of the hand, and then take the random measurements of the fingerprints, and then you feed that into a digital algorithm of zeros and ones.
[00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:34.196]  You're right, it's not my hand.
[00:26:34.516 --> 00:26:41.378]  It's zeros and ones, but you instantly regurgitate them back in to the picture of my hand and those measurements.
[00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:43.600]  Oh, but you heard the newscast.
[00:26:43.941 --> 00:26:48.204]  Don't worry, it's not a... Don't worry, you've heard the other newscast.
[00:26:48.224 --> 00:26:51.107]  Don't worry, Mercury's good for you!
[00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:55.791]  And don't worry, this isn't a hand scan.
[00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:57.573]  This isn't a fingerprint.
[00:26:59.395 --> 00:27:07.462]  It's like the National... Folks, the day that Steve Blaha, my good buddy, walked in and said, you gotta see this tape, local CBF tonight.
[00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:12.486]  He walked in, he said, 5 o'clock news, here it is, they say Mercury's good for you.
[00:27:13.187 --> 00:27:16.868]  He pops it in, this is like a year ago, and yes, Mercury is good for you.
[00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:27.772]  And when I got home that night, I typed in basically some of the words of the Medical Watch reporter, and I knew what I was about to see.
[00:27:28.192 --> 00:27:34.294]  I knew that I was about to see, word for word, the exact report all over the country.
[00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:43.554]  Tampa, New York, Dallas, Houston, Downton LA, just every city, every CBS, the same script.
[00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:49.777]  Emailed out to them, their local medical watch reporter repeats it, Mercury's good for you.
[00:27:50.737 --> 00:27:52.738]  And it's even got that local flavor for you.
[00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:56.779]  And folks, I'm telling you, I wish I had the staff for this.
[00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:59.620]  I actually do have the staff, I guess I could have them.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.762]  Go get that, maybe I should, go get the clip out of Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:28:04.696 --> 00:28:08.218]  Where they have the newscast about HEB and they say the exact same words.
[00:28:08.538 --> 00:28:10.139]  Don't worry, it's not your fingerprint.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:22.747]  And it's the exact same words that Disney gave to this local News 6 affiliate in Orlando, Florida.
[00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:27.670]  I mean, they are scientifically attacking us.
[00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.932]  They are scientifically building the cage around us.
[00:28:32.272 --> 00:28:33.033]  Heaven help us!
[00:28:34.924 --> 00:28:36.745]  And so these families are all excited.
[00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:37.746]  You get on planes.
[00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:39.267]  The travel agent doesn't tell you.
[00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:40.248]  The kids want to go.
[00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:42.910]  You fly out there.
[00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:49.915]  You pay thousands of dollars in room and board and, and, and, and, and your airline flight.
[00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:51.536]  You're searched at the airlines.
[00:28:52.416 --> 00:28:57.680]  And they can't even convince you yet to retina scan or thumb scan to get on the plane because everybody knows that's Big Brother.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.203]  So they have Disney, Cap City,
[00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:06.051]  And you're lined up with your kids.
[00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:08.713]  Your 8 and 5 year olds are wearing Mickey Mouse hats.
[00:29:09.113 --> 00:29:10.054]  They're all happy.
[00:29:10.114 --> 00:29:10.875]  They want to get in.
[00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:13.297]  You're in these big lines and you buy your tickets.
[00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:14.278]  They don't tell you!
[00:29:14.298 --> 00:29:20.584]  And then you walk through and they say, it's time to get scanned.
[00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:27.030]  Well, that happened with my wife and I and our son two years ago at SeaWorld.
[00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:29.653]  And I just said, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:29:29.673 --> 00:29:30.253]  I want my money back.
[00:29:30.293 --> 00:29:30.854]  She said, OK.
[00:29:31.034 --> 00:29:31.895]  Most people don't want to do it.
[00:29:32.095 --> 00:29:32.636]  Just go through.
[00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:33.236]  Just go through.
[00:29:34.317 --> 00:29:35.919]  But see, now there's no choice.
[00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:37.200]  You must.
[00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:40.043]  You must.
[00:29:40.303 --> 00:29:42.005]  You've got to say no now.
[00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:46.109]  If they get it in everywhere, folks, it's over.
[00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.253]  You cannot buy it or sell without it.
[00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:54.691]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:58.279]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.091]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:08.171]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:08.492 --> 00:30:09.312]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.732 --> 00:30:13.873]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:18.274]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.654 --> 00:30:23.515]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.895 --> 00:30:27.498]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.678 --> 00:30:33.022]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.302 --> 00:30:36.024]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:37.225]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:43.269]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:50.035]  Call Cal Bend Toll Free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:50.075 --> 00:30:51.096]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[00:31:01.132 --> 00:31:03.113]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.193 --> 00:31:13.899]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.802]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.882 --> 00:31:30.209]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:37.654]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.034 --> 00:31:40.175]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.676 --> 00:31:45.659]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:52.103]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.123 --> 00:31:53.224]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:31:53.284 --> 00:31:53.865]  That's toll free!
[00:31:53.885 --> 00:31:53.925]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.332 --> 00:32:10.198]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:12.820]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:15.023]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.383 --> 00:32:20.728]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:21.208]  Yes!
[00:32:21.248 --> 00:32:25.393]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:32:25.834 --> 00:32:33.743]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:32:33.923 --> 00:32:41.012]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:32:41.512 --> 00:32:44.653]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:44.893 --> 00:32:47.354]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:49.874]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:50.154 --> 00:32:53.935]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:56.516]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:56.616 --> 00:32:57.116]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:13.103 --> 00:33:19.868]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:19.888 --> 00:33:25.211]  We're about to go to Tony and Mark and Tom and Robert and Mike and many others.
[00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:30.214]  But I really want this to sink in to you.
[00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:33.076]  It's in public Pentagon documents.
[00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:36.538]  It's in corporate strategy white papers.
[00:33:36.618 --> 00:33:41.862]  They have biometric summits and RFID summits in
[00:33:42.637 --> 00:33:44.078]  In Houston and Chicago.
[00:33:45.338 --> 00:33:48.640]  We've sent representatives to them who've reported from the floor.
[00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:54.643]  They openly say things publicly like, the public doesn't like it but they will submit.
[00:33:55.483 --> 00:33:58.084]  You know, we're going to chip everything, we're going to tax them.
[00:33:59.205 --> 00:34:04.407]  They give these different programs weird names like Dark Angel and Babylon Leader.
[00:34:06.028 --> 00:34:07.689]  It's so sick!
[00:34:08.689 --> 00:34:10.090]  You've got a government
[00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:18.359]  That thinks of you as their slaves, who is always trying to scare you into submission, all over the place.
[00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:26.187]  I mean, right where I live, folks, they're putting thumb scanners in to do business, and they just go, sorry, you don't like it?
[00:34:26.487 --> 00:34:27.468]  Hit the road!
[00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.915]  Because they know soon everybody's going to have it in, and you're not going to have a choice.
[00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:36.363]  And there's so many facets to this.
[00:34:36.403 --> 00:34:42.353]  I mean, just what it does to the underground economy that's been the backbone of free societies for time immemorial.
[00:34:43.174 --> 00:34:45.017]  No, no more paying the long guy cash.
[00:34:45.457 --> 00:34:49.524]  Because even when you're paying cash, it's going to have RFID in it, and it's all going to be tracked and traced.
[00:34:50.546 --> 00:34:58.910]  When you get it out of a money machine or the bank, it's going to be stamped, time stamped, on that microchip, that filament, that it went to you.
[00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.912]  Then the relationship of what you buy and what you do and where that money goes will be known.
[00:35:05.753 --> 00:35:13.636]  There'll be federal control through the National Sales Tax of every shopping cart and every terminal and every cash register and every business.
[00:35:15.504 --> 00:35:23.227]  And if you don't have the proper identification in the file that your biometric number links to, it's over.
[00:35:23.628 --> 00:35:28.690]  By the way, they could put face scanning cameras in all of the stores and facilities.
[00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.851]  Because they are 100% when they're up close.
[00:35:33.432 --> 00:35:34.912]  It's at the distances they have problems.
[00:35:35.272 --> 00:35:36.313]  But they don't want that!
[00:35:36.983 --> 00:35:39.405]  They don't want to just face scan you and not let you have a choice.
[00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:43.489]  It's important to them that you have that choice and that you willingly do it.
[00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:45.931]  And so they are beguiling you.
[00:35:46.191 --> 00:35:47.633]  They are seducing you.
[00:35:48.453 --> 00:35:50.015]  Oh, want to go to the theme park.
[00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:52.237]  Want to go to the fanciest tanning salon.
[00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:54.439]  Want to go to the nicest country club.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.043]  Oh, want to be able to check out more books than other people.
[00:35:59.503 --> 00:36:01.085]  It's like Dateline NBC tonight.
[00:36:01.485 --> 00:36:03.287]  Dateline NBC, biometrics.
[00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:04.047]  They're great!
[00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:07.030]  They give you security, and you get to go to the head of the line!
[00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.891]  Dateline, NBC, oh!
[00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:19.638]  You know, I was re-watching, um, Masters of Terror, just a few nights ago, and, uh, I'd forgotten about Sean Hannity.
[00:36:19.658 --> 00:36:23.061]  We got a clip of him on there saying, everybody needs a microchip.
[00:36:23.121 --> 00:36:24.622]  Oh, every child needs one of these.
[00:36:25.102 --> 00:36:26.043]  Oh, I'm gonna make money.
[00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:27.263]  I'm gonna buy stock in it.
[00:36:27.984 --> 00:36:29.405]  It's just so evil!
[00:36:30.928 --> 00:36:32.289]  Alright, I could rant and rave forever.
[00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:33.150]  I want to go to your calls.
[00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.351]  There's so much other news.
[00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:38.955]  It's just... Finger scanning at Disney Parks causes concerns.
[00:36:40.356 --> 00:36:42.858]  And they say that there's now no longer a choice.
[00:36:43.338 --> 00:36:45.880]  Before it was just seasoned pass holders had to do it.
[00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.422]  Now everybody... You know what?
[00:36:47.902 --> 00:36:49.243]  The lies are so incredible.
[00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:50.544]  One more time.
[00:36:51.225 --> 00:36:53.627]  I want to play that little minute, fifteen second clip.
[00:36:53.687 --> 00:36:59.151]  Because... Because... Folks, you're going to see biometric reports in your city and your town.
[00:36:59.191 --> 00:36:59.732]  We've had them here.
[00:37:00.797 --> 00:37:08.362]  And notice, it's the exact same words, even different news affiliates, different so-called competition.
[00:37:09.243 --> 00:37:11.444]  I've heard this report 50 times plus.
[00:37:12.785 --> 00:37:14.086]  It's always the same.
[00:37:14.506 --> 00:37:16.447]  Don't worry, this isn't a fingerprint.
[00:37:16.928 --> 00:37:18.549]  Don't worry, it's just some numbers.
[00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:20.871]  Well of course it's numbers!
[00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:23.214]  And now they've got your number!
[00:37:23.514 --> 00:37:24.916]  It is a human number!
[00:37:25.336 --> 00:37:31.803]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast!
[00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:35.868]  For it is six hundred and sixty-six!
[00:37:36.148 --> 00:37:36.469]  Hit it!
[00:37:36.929 --> 00:37:44.876]  This new finger scanning technique will not only move people through the gate faster, it will also crack down on people who try to share their tickets or use stolen tickets.
[00:37:45.257 --> 00:37:51.002]  Disney has started the scanning trend, Universal, Orlando, and SeaWorld say they plan to follow suit before the end of the year.
[00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:55.946]  Now it works by scanning really the ridges and structure of your index finger and middle finger.
[00:37:55.986 --> 00:37:58.068]  They refer to it as a finger geometry.
[00:37:58.428 --> 00:38:10.737]  It does not take your fingerprint, just in a sense your finger measurement, information that will not be used or collected in any numerical way, but privacy advocates like the Civil Liberties Union say this borders on a violation of privacy.
[00:38:10.777 --> 00:38:17.943]  They're worried about what it could mean to have this kind of information on the thousands of people who frequent Disney theme parks.
[00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:21.866]  So, wait a minute.
[00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:25.969]  So it does not get your fingerprint, no, it gets the geometry of your finger.
[00:38:26.903 --> 00:38:35.849]  So what it does is it takes a scan, or a digital photo, that's actually three-dimensional.
[00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:46.516]  And then between the digital map, they then calculate, and every individual's fingerprints have a different mathematical calculation than anyone else in the world.
[00:38:47.957 --> 00:38:50.419]  And so, yeah, it's like saying, it's not a fingerprint,
[00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:56.943]  It's the equivalent of, you know, having you in the jail cell.
[00:38:57.503 --> 00:39:00.004]  I mean, it's more than your fingerprint.
[00:39:01.004 --> 00:39:02.625]  It's finger molds.
[00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:04.205]  Okay?
[00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:09.427]  It's just so deceptive, and we just live in these lies.
[00:39:12.082 --> 00:39:16.943]  Folks, it's the same script for five years of biometrics, and you'll always hear the same thing.
[00:39:17.323 --> 00:39:20.164]  Oh, it's not a digital photo of your face.
[00:39:20.564 --> 00:39:23.565]  It's just the contours of your face in a mathematical calculation.
[00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:25.225]  Oh, it's not your voice.
[00:39:25.545 --> 00:39:26.666]  We don't store your voice.
[00:39:26.706 --> 00:39:31.027]  We just store its mathematical calculation.
[00:39:31.367 --> 00:39:33.447]  Yes, yes, the essence of your voice.
[00:39:33.807 --> 00:39:35.268]  It's much worse than a photo.
[00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:40.209]  And again, it's the applications of this.
[00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:43.881]  It's so bad!
[00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.303]  Alright, let's talk to Tony.
[00:39:48.304 --> 00:39:49.604]  And Tony, where are you calling us from?
[00:39:49.685 --> 00:39:49.945]  Arkansas?
[00:39:50.005 --> 00:39:50.765]  Arkansas, yes.
[00:39:51.326 --> 00:39:51.566]  Hi.
[00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:52.326]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:52.366 --> 00:39:53.987]  God bless you for what you do, man.
[00:39:54.588 --> 00:39:59.691]  I don't know if you knew, but your buddy Peter Lance was on Coast to Coast last night and you came up as a topic.
[00:40:00.712 --> 00:40:02.653]  I didn't know if anyone had informed you of that.
[00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:06.176]  Okay, was he attacking me again?
[00:40:06.196 --> 00:40:09.678]  Well, what happened was George was trying to, as he always does,
[00:40:10.843 --> 00:40:18.373]  It was in the second hour of him being on the guest, so the third hour of the show, and I need to get stream links so I can hear it again, but I was falling asleep and I just had a hunch.
[00:40:18.813 --> 00:40:21.457]  I wanted to fill him out more and get more of what he's like.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:32.627]  George is trying to draw a reconciliation between the two of you, if you will, and just pointing out, we'll see, Peter, you're against the government, you're against the government, and George is the one who brought you up.
[00:40:32.927 --> 00:40:35.029]  He goes, Alex is the same way.
[00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:37.090]  Alex is someone who tries to bring that out.
[00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.032]  He goes, don't you guys have common ground there?
[00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:43.315]  Just out of nowhere, George brought that up, and he could not for the life of himself
[00:40:43.855 --> 00:40:44.596]  I agree with you.
[00:40:44.636 --> 00:40:46.717]  And he said, look, I don't know much about Alex Jones.
[00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:49.720]  He said, I'm doing this at the best of my recollection, bro, from last night.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:55.784]  But he said, he goes, I went to his website, and he goes, this guy causes a bad name for all the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:40:56.184 --> 00:40:59.927]  And he pointed out... No, he's been calling me a disinformation agent.
[00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:00.948]  Well, really?
[00:41:00.968 --> 00:41:04.811]  Because he said here, he goes, I went to his website, I found this article where he says,
[00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:09.540]  Number one, here's an example, and I don't want to get off into this, but I was on that debate
[00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:33.618]  And I would say, Lance, I've heard you on the radio before.
[00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:38.042]  I know you say that Iraqis bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:41:38.082 --> 00:41:40.904]  And I said this clearly, because I heard the rebroadcast on WOAI.
[00:41:40.924 --> 00:41:42.185]  They re-air it early.
[00:41:43.846 --> 00:41:49.891]  They play it live, but they also re-air two hours of it every night at 10 o'clock on 1200 WOAI out of San Antonio.
[00:41:51.061 --> 00:41:53.163]  So I was able the next night to hear two hours of it.
[00:41:54.785 --> 00:41:58.189]  So I was able to hear, because I thought Lance must not have heard me.
[00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:08.059]  But time and time again I would clearly say something, and then he would then claim, he's a lawyer by the way, he would then claim that I had just said something completely different.
[00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:13.745]  So I said to Lance, I said, well Lance, I know you say Iraqis were involved in Oklahoma City,
[00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:17.108]  But those Iraqis were brought in by the U.S.
[00:42:17.228 --> 00:42:20.752]  government, the LA Times reported, and they were actually government agents.
[00:42:21.252 --> 00:42:26.438]  And he comes back going, how dare you say I said Iraqis were involved in 9-11?
[00:42:26.578 --> 00:42:28.781]  Well, I had just said,
[00:42:29.622 --> 00:42:34.947]  I had just said Iraq, but then I wasn't able to respond to that.
[00:42:35.587 --> 00:42:39.951]  So time and time again, that's what he does.
[00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:45.656]  And so if flight schools... Number one, I wasn't talking about flight schools.
[00:42:46.277 --> 00:42:48.119]  I was talking about the U.S.
[00:42:48.339 --> 00:42:53.844]  military base at Pensacola, the Naval Air Station, where it is admitted
[00:42:54.444 --> 00:42:59.487]  But at least three of the hijackers did train in a secret government program.
[00:42:59.847 --> 00:43:01.988]  Now that's never been retracted.
[00:43:02.828 --> 00:43:04.949]  MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal.
[00:43:05.509 --> 00:43:07.370]  So see what he does as a lawyer?
[00:43:08.011 --> 00:43:12.033]  He jumps to something I didn't say to then say I'm wrong.
[00:43:12.373 --> 00:43:20.997]  And I get the feeling that, because I listened to you guys at night and it seemed like he had it out to get you from the get-go, but it's been my gut feeling if you check his pedigree, okay,
[00:43:21.457 --> 00:43:22.038]  Yeah, to me.
[00:43:22.078 --> 00:43:24.319]  Now, I know you don't want to say that, but to me, he's a plant.
[00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:30.284]  And everything, as best I could stomach, listening to him last night, he likes to portray that he is... No, I'm sure he's good.
[00:43:30.304 --> 00:43:33.226]  I mean, I'm sure the top producer for Nightline is someone we can trust.
[00:43:33.266 --> 00:43:33.946]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:34.587 --> 00:43:36.088]  But listen, we've got a bunch of news here.
[00:43:36.108 --> 00:43:38.029]  I don't want to spend all day on Alex Jones.
[00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:45.775]  But speaking of WOAI, I was editing until about 11.30 last night.
[00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:50.178]  I was driving home, and I was listening to WOAI again.
[00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:58.798]  And, uh, I heard George Norrie from last Friday, they were re-airing it last night, and I heard him say nice things about me.
[00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:07.125]  I heard him say that there's just something about this London bombing, you know, at first I didn't want to think it was the government, but there's just something about this London bombing.
[00:44:07.165 --> 00:44:17.212]  We'll take Alex Jones' information, which I've confirmed, he said, uh, that they were running drills at the exact same places at the exact same times, uh, on 7-7.
[00:44:18.373 --> 00:44:20.995]  And, uh, you know, that's why, you know, that's just impossible.
[00:44:21.815 --> 00:44:23.396]  So I hardly ever listen.
[00:44:23.416 --> 00:44:26.299]  I'm usually asleep or working so I don't get a chance to listen.
[00:44:26.799 --> 00:44:29.041]  I might listen to Coast to Coast AM maybe once a week.
[00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:33.024]  And that's only because I'm able to because it's re-aired on WOAI.
[00:44:33.384 --> 00:44:36.967]  So if I'm out driving around 10 to midnight, I'll be listening to Coast to Coast AM.
[00:44:38.088 --> 00:44:40.229]  But I'm not out a lot getting a chance to.
[00:44:40.249 --> 00:44:43.292]  But I tune in a lot and hear callers calling in defending me.
[00:44:43.312 --> 00:44:46.094]  I hear George Norrie defending me.
[00:44:46.674 --> 00:44:48.256]  And so I want to thank George Norrie.
[00:44:48.296 --> 00:44:49.877]  I mean, he really is a stand-up guy.
[00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:56.774]  I would like a chance to go on and talk about 9-11, talk about Madrid.
[00:45:00.557 --> 00:45:05.782]  But again, talking about Peter Lance is a complete waste of time.
[00:45:05.842 --> 00:45:13.868]  I've been sent some of the emails he's sent people about me, and it's horrible.
[00:45:15.049 --> 00:45:16.070]  And it's false.
[00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:18.412]  But that's okay, folks.
[00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:19.613]  I'm over the target.
[00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:22.083]  I'm going to be getting flak here.
[00:45:23.765 --> 00:45:31.731]  And, uh, you know, Peter Lance is enough of a high-profile individual that, you know, he rates my response back to him.
[00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:35.974]  I will not respond to people that are pure COINTELPRO, that I know of.
[00:45:36.835 --> 00:45:42.539]  I will not respond to stalkers, and I will not respond to people that are just publicity hunters.
[00:45:43.456 --> 00:45:45.157]  I mean, that's Radio 101.
[00:45:45.437 --> 00:45:58.084]  When somebody else has got a show and they're trying to attack you just to get you to respond to them very cynically, you know, like a monkey at the zoo throwing you-know-what at you to get your attention, I mean, I'm just not going to pay attention.
[00:45:59.185 --> 00:46:01.766]  But somebody like Peter Lance, I mean, he deserves a response.
[00:46:02.747 --> 00:46:06.749]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in New York.
[00:46:06.929 --> 00:46:07.569]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:10.051]  Alex?
[00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:10.551]  Yes.
[00:46:11.078 --> 00:46:11.738]  Hey, real quick.
[00:46:11.918 --> 00:46:13.659]  You know, I'm not one of those numbers experts.
[00:46:13.879 --> 00:46:16.500]  People are 9-1-1, 3-3-3, whatever.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:24.322]  But this morning, I was adding up the days until 6-6-06 from the London bombing.
[00:46:24.643 --> 00:46:25.883]  And it comes out to 334.
[00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:29.824]  It makes me wonder if something's going to happen the day before.
[00:46:30.985 --> 00:46:35.986]  And we wake up on 6-6-06 and something's really changed, you know, the whole world.
[00:46:36.386 --> 00:46:37.627]  Well, let me just explain this.
[00:46:38.817 --> 00:47:01.350]  You know, I've been criticized by atheists for believing in God, but regardless of whether atheists believe in God or not, we have to recognize that leaders throughout history do generally believe in God, and that our leaders are Luciferian, and that guides their policies.
[00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.372]  You know, it's like if we're... I mean, if I was writing an autobiography,
[00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:09.589]  About myself, I would say I was a Christian, because I am.
[00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:14.353]  If the Dalai Lama was writing an autobiography, he would say that he was a Buddhist.
[00:47:15.134 --> 00:47:15.294]  Right.
[00:47:15.994 --> 00:47:16.655]  Because he is.
[00:47:16.715 --> 00:47:21.558]  But, I mean, do atheists laugh at people when they write articles about the Dalai Lama being a Buddhist?
[00:47:21.578 --> 00:47:25.361]  You know, it's almost as if he's been mentioning religion, you're bad.
[00:47:26.102 --> 00:47:29.865]  Or you're some lower life form.
[00:47:29.925 --> 00:47:33.788]  But regardless, our leaders, they do believe in numerology.
[00:47:34.395 --> 00:47:37.377]  They do believe in astrology.
[00:47:37.437 --> 00:47:42.440]  I mean, they admit that everything Ronald Reagan did was done according to his wife's astrologer.
[00:47:43.141 --> 00:47:43.961]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:47:44.041 --> 00:47:46.283]  So, was Time Magazine bad?
[00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:49.205]  Or were they kooky to do a report on that?
[00:47:49.265 --> 00:47:50.365]  No, that's newsworthy.
[00:47:50.406 --> 00:47:55.089]  So, whereas I don't believe in numerology, the globalists are obsessed with it.
[00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:58.671]  Well, I just wanted to point that out, and you probably
[00:47:59.298 --> 00:48:09.825]  Maybe know some people that look into that numbers and maybe they can report on what's the events that are going to happen because these people are wacky.
[00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:13.288]  No, they are wacky and thanks for the call.
[00:48:14.509 --> 00:48:23.034]  But at the same time, Mark, then people who are into the Bible code or people that are into, you know, people then because the elite is into all of this, they then think it's real.
[00:48:23.675 --> 00:48:26.437]  Oh, then I better buy a magic pyramid that's going to save me.
[00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.291]  I better go to a Wicca ritual, because this stuff's real!
[00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:31.851]  I better get involved in this power!
[00:48:32.571 --> 00:48:37.452]  No, it's all very dangerous, and it's all, you know, basically mind-over-matter stuff.
[00:48:38.032 --> 00:48:45.233]  You know, whether it's real or not, you know, regardless, people think it is, so it's a way to hype themselves up.
[00:48:46.073 --> 00:48:48.094]  And just stay away from it, folks.
[00:48:49.254 --> 00:48:51.814]  Let's go ahead, I mean, don't touch it with a ten-foot pole.
[00:48:52.134 --> 00:48:55.155]  Those people bear bad fruits, they're not happy,
[00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.670]  And frankly, they don't have power either.
[00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:04.232]  I mean, the power that God gives you is just, it's the greatest power.
[00:49:05.572 --> 00:49:08.212]  So if you're looking for power, find it in servitude to Christ.
[00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:11.273]  Let's talk to Tom in Arizona.
[00:49:11.313 --> 00:49:12.033]  Tom, go ahead.
[00:49:14.254 --> 00:49:14.854]  Alex, you there?
[00:49:15.014 --> 00:49:16.074]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[00:49:16.394 --> 00:49:21.055]  Yeah, Alex, I don't know if anybody brought this up yet or not, but the
[00:49:22.116 --> 00:49:27.459]  The third train, the Piccadilly Line train, did anybody bring up the fact that that was number 3-1-1?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.782]  I did notice that and on 9-11 the flights are 9-1-1 and it's...
[00:49:33.861 --> 00:49:35.061]  I know, it's ridiculous.
[00:49:35.121 --> 00:49:39.584]  And on the side of the bus said, you know, terror, absolutely brilliant.
[00:49:39.804 --> 00:49:40.545]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:42.006]  Absolutely brilliant!
[00:49:43.327 --> 00:49:50.692]  Right in front of the Tavistock Institute, Tavistock Square, blood splattered all over the main mine control facility.
[00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:51.312]  Right.
[00:49:51.772 --> 00:49:52.753]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[00:49:52.793 --> 00:49:54.774]  They just divert the bus, none of the other buses.
[00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:59.177]  This one is diverted, things didn't go according to plan, and then boom!
[00:49:59.197 --> 00:50:00.218]  I know.
[00:50:01.267 --> 00:50:07.009]  Hey Alex, I'll let you go, and do us a favor, don't be driving around in the middle of the night by yourself in Austin, huh?
[00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:08.569]  Why?
[00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.331]  I don't know, you know, you never know who might be out there.
[00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:15.011]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[00:50:15.091 --> 00:50:17.712]  You know something, I take precautions, but I don't live in fear.
[00:50:17.732 --> 00:50:20.013]  I mean, I have absolutely no fear.
[00:50:20.813 --> 00:50:23.114]  You know, I mean, I got over that when I was about five years old.
[00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:29.196]  I walk into a dark room, I don't see boogie men there, and I don't, when I walk, you know, I just don't worry about it.
[00:50:31.767 --> 00:50:36.892]  I mean, if they strike me down, folks, that'll just wake more people up.
[00:50:38.253 --> 00:50:39.574]  There's so many of us, too, now.
[00:50:40.395 --> 00:50:43.497]  Thirty years ago, they'd kill you right out of hand for talking about this stuff.
[00:50:43.537 --> 00:50:43.738]  Now?
[00:50:44.538 --> 00:50:45.619]  We're the majority, folks.
[00:50:45.639 --> 00:50:46.340]  We're taking over.
[00:50:47.621 --> 00:50:51.304]  They have to deal with us by arguing with us and trying to discredit us.
[00:50:52.986 --> 00:50:54.307]  And that doesn't mean they won't kill me.
[00:50:54.347 --> 00:50:58.751]  I mean, but life's so short, I mean, huh, at least it'd be quick and painless.
[00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:05.530]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.351]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.691 --> 00:51:12.374]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.715 --> 00:51:19.439]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.779 --> 00:51:21.741]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.961 --> 00:51:24.803]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.883 --> 00:51:29.567]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.767 --> 00:51:34.150]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.411 --> 00:51:41.616]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:44.298]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:01.696 --> 00:52:05.599]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.819 --> 00:52:11.264]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.544 --> 00:52:21.912]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:26.416]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.596 --> 00:52:27.397]  We're good to go!
[00:52:41.527 --> 00:52:42.028]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:05.382]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:53:05.623 --> 00:53:08.404]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:53:08.764 --> 00:53:12.787]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:53:13.027 --> 00:53:22.312]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:53:22.612 --> 00:53:27.515]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[00:53:27.795 --> 00:53:31.757]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[00:53:31.898 --> 00:53:39.802]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.

[00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:52.730]  Call now, 800-625-2890.
[00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.271]  Alright, just to tip.
[00:53:54.432 --> 00:53:57.013]  I haven't had a massage in about 5-6 years.
[00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:18.315]  Years ago, when I worked out all the time, you know, I'd go get one every few months.
[00:54:19.896 --> 00:54:22.737]  But most people you get a massage from really wouldn't do it hard enough.
[00:54:22.757 --> 00:54:30.561]  Man, I went to this lady yesterday, uh, who basically did deep tissue or, like, rolfing.
[00:54:31.562 --> 00:54:33.843]  She said, you're gonna feel like you got hit by a train tomorrow.
[00:54:33.863 --> 00:54:38.745]  It was all the toxins coming out of my muscles, because, I mean, they were like huge knots in my back.
[00:54:39.806 --> 00:54:40.326]  And, uh,
[00:54:43.294 --> 00:54:44.175]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:53.060]  My chest is bigger, my shoulders are bigger, all these knots she broke up, and I do feel like I have a horrible hangover because of all the toxins, but I'm not sore.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.101]  I feel good.
[00:54:55.802 --> 00:55:10.551]  So I recommend that freedom lovers, patriots of the stressful world, you know, it's somewhat expensive to get somebody to give you a good massage, but I recommend, you know, a couple times a year at least to go get those muscles broken up a little bit.
[00:55:11.215 --> 00:55:15.678]  Because they just retain all those toxins and shorten themselves.
[00:55:16.859 --> 00:55:20.721]  Especially if you're working out and then not stretching properly like I've been doing lately.
[00:55:21.842 --> 00:55:24.123]  But she just did an amazing job.
[00:55:24.143 --> 00:55:25.424]  I mean, that lady is incredible.
[00:55:26.165 --> 00:55:28.766]  The reason I found out about her was that the tunes not told.
[00:55:29.507 --> 00:55:31.528]  They had a couple folks out there giving massages.
[00:55:32.108 --> 00:55:33.509]  You know, on those massage chairs.
[00:55:33.529 --> 00:55:40.474]  You know, kind of out in the big bar area there at the banquet hall.
[00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:46.675]  And then I sat down for five minutes and the lady goes, here let me give you a free massage Alex.
[00:55:47.495 --> 00:55:51.077]  And I sat down and she went to work with me for like five minutes and it was incredible.
[00:55:51.657 --> 00:55:53.398]  I was like, man you are strong.
[00:55:54.319 --> 00:56:02.743]  And boy she got me in there and I mean just... Plus I knew it was hurting so good.
[00:56:02.803 --> 00:56:05.704]  I knew it was getting rid of a lot of bad stuff in my back and legs and stuff.
[00:56:06.204 --> 00:56:09.746]  And man I just sat there basically biting the sheet.
[00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:22.104]  I'm telling you folks, you need to have it done.
[00:56:22.124 --> 00:56:24.105]  I think it's more powerful than chiropractors.
[00:56:24.805 --> 00:56:25.326]  A lot more.
[00:56:25.506 --> 00:56:27.747]  I've been to a few chiropractors before and my back's been hurt.
[00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.234]  And I think there's some real science there, and it does realign things.
[00:56:34.115 --> 00:56:36.736]  But just good old-fashioned massage, it was amazing.
[00:56:37.257 --> 00:56:42.820]  Alright, I know that we have Mike and Robert and Michael and Joe and James and many, many others.
[00:56:43.641 --> 00:56:49.265]  And I told you about a lot of these big, breaking developments concerning the London bombings.
[00:56:49.685 --> 00:56:52.967]  I'm going to get into those, plus the nuking threats by the Chinese.
[00:56:53.007 --> 00:56:54.728]  I wanted to go back over PDD-60.
[00:56:56.521 --> 00:56:58.722]  That Clinton signed that Bush has kept in place.
[00:57:00.262 --> 00:57:11.225]  And I wanted to also get into just a bunch of different economic pieces of information and police state news we've got.
[00:57:11.606 --> 00:57:20.348]  So what we'll do is we'll come back and we'll write your calls and hurry through those and then I'll get into the London situation.
[00:57:21.788 --> 00:57:23.349]  Before we end this hour though,
[00:57:24.887 --> 00:57:28.828]  Again, I'm not going to spend more than a minute on this, and you're really missing out if you don't get them.
[00:57:29.608 --> 00:57:40.630]  My best videos are Police State 2000, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:46.731]  I mean, if you really want to know what the New World Order is up to, and have a tool that's great for waking others up.
[00:57:46.771 --> 00:57:49.912]  I mean, I know a lot of you know more than I do, and I mean that when I say it.
[00:57:50.912 --> 00:57:52.272]  I'm humbled by your knowledge.
[00:57:52.984 --> 00:57:54.786]  Other than getting emails and phone calls.
[00:57:55.486 --> 00:57:58.069]  But really, these videos are good and they are very effective.
[00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:00.191]  And I think you should get them.
[00:58:00.451 --> 00:58:03.834]  And we've got big discounts when you get 3 or more of any of the 12 films.
[00:58:04.555 --> 00:58:09.400]  Upwards of 75% off one of my newest videos, American Dictators.

[00:58:17.526 --> 00:58:19.567]  Decide which videos or books you want to get.
[00:58:19.587 --> 00:58:21.728]  We have a whole bookstore and video store there.
[00:58:21.768 --> 00:58:23.088]  A lot of other great books and videos.
[00:58:23.368 --> 00:58:24.209]  We never talk about them.
[00:58:24.229 --> 00:58:24.849]  You should check out.
[00:58:25.329 --> 00:58:27.110]  Or call toll free to get the videos.
[00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.570]  They can answer your questions too.

[00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:45.831]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.635 --> 00:59:01.735]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.396 --> 00:59:03.256]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.976 --> 00:59:04.896]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.557 --> 00:59:09.178]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.718 --> 00:59:13.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:23.402]  Alright, my friends, we are now into our number two.
[00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:26.123]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:31.065 --> 00:59:38.010]  I am dedicated to exposing the global crime syndicate, the international crime families, known as the New World Order.
[00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:51.658]  I am dedicated to defending the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and getting the American people and the people of the world to get out of denial and face just how evil the globalists are.
[00:59:51.678 --> 00:59:57.522]  There have been some really new, very important news items that have come out concerning London.
[00:59:58.935 --> 01:00:00.876]  Also, a bunch of news concerning Iraq.
[01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:10.162]  We're going to get to all of that, as well as the media hysteria and scaremongering saying we're going to be nuked any minute.
[01:00:12.023 --> 01:00:13.243]  That is coming up as well.
[01:00:13.263 --> 01:00:15.385]  But right now, let's get some more of these great calls out of the way.
[01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.666]  Let's talk to Robert in Denver, then Mike and others.
[01:00:18.706 --> 01:00:19.567]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:22.295]  Hi, Alexander.
[01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:23.616]  Thanks so much for taking my call.
[01:00:23.656 --> 01:00:24.756]  I appreciate it.
[01:00:24.816 --> 01:00:26.756]  Great show, as always.
[01:00:27.077 --> 01:00:30.137]  I know I'm down to 60 seconds, so I'll try and be brief.
[01:00:31.398 --> 01:00:42.440]  Point number one, about a month or so ago, you reported and spoke about a kid that was shot in the back by Austin PD.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.201]  I was wondering what, if anything, was the latest on that situation?
[01:00:48.522 --> 01:00:48.802]  Well,
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.251]  Witnesses say that they saw the police shoot him in the back.
[01:00:54.871 --> 01:00:55.131]  Uh-huh.
[01:00:55.391 --> 01:01:01.693]  But now the media is saying it's okay that they did it because marijuana was found in his blood.
[01:01:01.713 --> 01:01:07.934]  Did they ever release the film, the video, of the slot car?
[01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:09.535]  Uh, no, not that I've seen.
[01:01:10.355 --> 01:01:10.595]  Wow.
[01:01:10.855 --> 01:01:12.916]  They may have, but I haven't been watching much TV.
[01:01:12.976 --> 01:01:13.756]  I've been reading the paper.
[01:01:14.454 --> 01:01:25.918]  Point number two, in Agustin, Texas, there is a lady who is going after blocks pretty heavy because her husband took blocks and wound up dying from it.
[01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:28.979]  She's pretty convinced, I agree with her, that the blocks killed him.
[01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:34.821]  And that's going to be the start of several class action lawsuits against Merck about this.
[01:01:34.861 --> 01:01:37.661]  How do you think the blocks are going to play out for lawsuits and everything?
[01:01:39.622 --> 01:01:42.223]  Well, I always wonder how you can have
[01:01:43.138 --> 01:02:08.458]  Somebody on a drug for joint pain that admittedly kills you, or makes you sick, and then the company gets in trouble, but then all the studies show that serotonin reuptake inhibitors are even worse for your brain, your heart, your nervous system, that cause depression, suicide, but still they are expanding it and pushing it on even more people.
[01:02:08.538 --> 01:02:10.600]  So, look, back
[01:02:12.446 --> 01:02:16.007]  What, 20 years ago they shut up the Vaccine Damage Fund?
[01:02:16.027 --> 01:02:22.950]  A multi-billion dollar federal fund where they don't let your suit involving vaccines go to regular courts.
[01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:27.492]  They created their own courts and there's no jury.
[01:02:27.892 --> 01:02:31.333]  The court decides how much money you get.
[01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:33.650]  And on average, it's something like $55,000.
[01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:42.135]  You know, if you can prove that the mercury or the vaccine brain-damaged your child, I mean, who cares about $50,000?
[01:02:42.515 --> 01:02:43.956]  $50 million isn't enough.
[01:02:43.976 --> 01:02:46.958]  A trillion isn't enough, you know, if you really love your children.
[01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:49.440]  And so, you know, it's the same thing.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:59.266]  Certain protected drug areas, certain types of drugs, certain classes that have a social engineering use are protected.
[01:02:59.286 --> 01:02:59.866]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:14.697]  Let's go to break now, and when we come back we will hurriedly go to Michael in New York, Joe in New York, James in Texas, and that'll be it for calls for now.
[01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:22.282]  Then I'm going to get into the London, the new developments there, and there's a host of other important news stories.
[01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:24.923]  But we'll continue with your calls throughout this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:42.119]  1-800-259-9231 and of course the websites are infowars.net and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:43.760]  Those are excellent sites.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:50.304]  Be sure and check them out daily as we track and chronicle the latest developments inside the New World Order.
[01:03:53.852 --> 01:04:01.239]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.519 --> 01:04:06.243]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.484 --> 01:04:12.129]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:16.912]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.112 --> 01:04:24.256]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.296 --> 01:04:28.779]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.979 --> 01:04:31.500]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:37.824]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional
[01:04:37.824 --> 01:04:38.224]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.513 --> 01:05:02.579]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:14.067]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.408 --> 01:05:19.231]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:20.131]  Are no problem.
[01:05:20.352 --> 01:05:27.016]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.216 --> 01:05:34.041]  Black Berkey elements glow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.082]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.342 --> 01:05:38.404]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[01:06:01.559 --> 01:06:09.484]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:06:09.644 --> 01:06:13.487]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:06:13.727 --> 01:06:14.508]  We're good to go.
[01:06:33.638 --> 01:06:36.819]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.

[01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:49.662]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:54.603]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:19.450]  Oh, by the way, we have Professor David Ray Griffin joining us to give us his insights on 9-11 and some of the new info that's coming out there, and to talk about his concern with the London bombings.
[01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:22.072]  So that's coming up tomorrow.
[01:07:22.093 --> 01:07:26.617]  A lot of big guests coming up on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[01:07:28.539 --> 01:07:33.160]  Wide open phones today, the toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:47.705]  I'm going to take three or four more calls right now, and then I'm going to get into the latest info on the London bombings.
[01:07:48.205 --> 01:07:51.186]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Michigan.
[01:07:51.246 --> 01:07:52.106]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:07:53.507 --> 01:07:56.267]  Finally I can listen to the show real clear when I'm on hold over here.
[01:07:56.287 --> 01:07:58.088]  Your blowtorch sometimes goes out on
[01:07:58.923 --> 01:07:59.363]  CR.
[01:07:59.744 --> 01:08:14.415]  Anyway, I have a buddy in SF, Special Forces, about four or five years ago, he was always really very on the point as far as Second Amendment rights and stuff, but he changed, like, so dramatically.
[01:08:14.915 --> 01:08:15.676]  He said, it's over.
[01:08:15.936 --> 01:08:19.799]  I said, well, hey, you know, what about family, wife, all this stuff?
[01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:20.660]  He says, it's over.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.761]  He said they're going to wind up grabbing guns.
[01:08:23.302 --> 01:08:27.585]  He's already been trained along with a lot of other SF, I'm sure you're familiar with this, at Fort Bragg.
[01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:31.335]  But there is a model city and they're moving everybody out on their trains.
[01:08:32.176 --> 01:08:45.821]  And he also said that, and I've actually seen in the Harbor News, which is right around Fort Hamilton, where SF was training on a high rise, clearing it out from roof to floor.
[01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:47.422]  And there are pictures in there.
[01:08:47.442 --> 01:08:48.282]  I still have the article.
[01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:52.734]  It shows people being... And so, what you're saying is true.
[01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.795]  I mean, I don't just have somebody telling me this.
[01:08:55.496 --> 01:09:02.241]  I have video of Special Forces and regular Army and Marines all over the country training to put American citizens in camps.
[01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:06.784]  But, I guess he's just such a coward that he just goes, it's over!
[01:09:06.804 --> 01:09:08.325]  I can't say no!
[01:09:08.666 --> 01:09:10.347]  I just gotta follow my orders!
[01:09:10.607 --> 01:09:12.408]  I guess it's over for this country!
[01:09:12.428 --> 01:09:13.929]  I mean, what's wrong with him?
[01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:14.610]  I don't know.
[01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:16.601]  I'm not there.
[01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:17.482]  So what was he saying?
[01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:19.843]  I mean, did you say, oh, so you're going to carry all this out?
[01:09:20.043 --> 01:09:20.223]  Yeah.
[01:09:20.683 --> 01:09:21.924]  He just said, oh, I am, yeah.
[01:09:22.504 --> 01:09:22.944]  No, he didn't.
[01:09:23.184 --> 01:09:23.704]  He didn't say that.
[01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:24.305]  I love the government.
[01:09:24.365 --> 01:09:24.965]  I love them.
[01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:27.686]  You know, I've read some of the SF Resistor.
[01:09:28.066 --> 01:09:31.668]  You know, that's the paper that they put together through mail drops and stuff.
[01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:32.168]  Yes.
[01:09:32.408 --> 01:09:36.070]  And so there are a lot of guys who really want to try and keep this thing together.
[01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:41.412]  But on the back end of stuff, all the new recruits, hey, you know, they don't really care.
[01:09:41.472 --> 01:09:42.653]  And, you know, we start getting people.
[01:09:42.873 --> 01:09:43.713]  I don't have to tell you.
[01:09:43.793 --> 01:09:45.594]  It's like, you know, preaching to the choir here.
[01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:56.020]  When you start getting new recruits who are also looking to have their tickets punched, you know, as far as green cards, stuff like that, and they're coming in on the back end, and they don't really give a fling, you know, what about us?
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.922]  And they'll just go to door to door, you know, what difference does it make?
[01:10:00.942 --> 01:10:03.104]  Well, you just made the King Daddy point.
[01:10:03.124 --> 01:10:09.327]  20 plus percent of the Army now are illegal aliens.
[01:10:09.547 --> 01:10:15.471]  Literally, they're illegal aliens, they get instant green card when they sign up, instant citizens, they're up for a three year term,
[01:10:16.355 --> 01:10:21.498]  And the trend is showing, see the globalists are happy actually that recruiting is down.
[01:10:22.499 --> 01:10:27.742]  Because where it's not down is in the Valley, in South Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California.
[01:10:28.303 --> 01:10:34.727]  We're looking within the next 10 years, now get ready for this, half the military is going to be Latin American.
[01:10:35.407 --> 01:10:39.610]  And so it's going to be just like the British and the German Hessian troops that they brought in here in 1776 and 1812.
[01:10:43.309 --> 01:10:51.273]  We literally are going to have our foreign army mercenaries, just like the Persians had the Greeks.
[01:10:51.973 --> 01:10:53.633]  I mean, it's the same M.O.
[01:10:54.994 --> 01:10:56.074]  Alex, listen man.
[01:10:58.115 --> 01:11:02.157]  We put up a good tsunami over here on your program and others and stuff.
[01:11:02.177 --> 01:11:05.358]  There was a point made on an earlier show on WWCR.
[01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:06.919]  So you have a momentum here.
[01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:08.159]  What can you practically do?
[01:11:08.219 --> 01:11:09.340]  Yes, spread the word and stuff.
[01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:26.881]  I call congressmen, senators, I get letters back from them saying thanks for your communication but I'm still going to be voting for this 396 or 397 bill holding the firearms manufacturers accountable for their misuse of their products and stuff.
[01:11:27.702 --> 01:11:28.842]  What the hell else can you do?
[01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:29.803]  You go to town meetings.
[01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:31.139]  All that kind of stuff.
[01:11:31.399 --> 01:11:32.359]  Let me tell you something, also.
[01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:41.662]  This guy who I was telling you about, my buddy, he said that people who are really serious about Second Amendment rights, he said they're all members of the Jews for the preservation of firearm ownership.
[01:11:41.702 --> 01:11:43.062]  He said these guys are bulldogs.
[01:11:43.102 --> 01:11:44.862]  He says they're just like, uh... Yeah, that's a good group.
[01:11:44.902 --> 01:11:46.283]  We've had them on probably 20 times.
[01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:47.723]  Listen, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:11:49.203 --> 01:11:49.983]  Uh, great call.
[01:11:50.744 --> 01:11:51.804]  You know, he's not kidding.
[01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:56.965]  If you had my video, Police Day 2000, or Police Day 2 of Takeover,
[01:11:57.771 --> 01:12:13.240]  You will see video from Hebron, Maryland to Oakland, California to South Texas of Army and Marines training to take over cities, training to take over your towns, openly interrogating the role players who say they're Americans.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.621]  And they ask, well, where'd you get the gun?
[01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:15.602]  Where are you from?
[01:12:15.682 --> 01:12:16.782]  I'm from San Francisco.
[01:12:18.663 --> 01:12:24.387]  I mean, I got Colonel Love on video admitting that it's for domestic operations as well as overseas.
[01:12:25.493 --> 01:12:42.501]  I mean, the troops have been training for decades, and decades ago it was very secret, small cadres, small elite squadrons were being trained to go out later and train a wider group.
[01:12:44.322 --> 01:12:49.044]  And the first thing they do is they take the troops and train them, that this is going to be for Macedonia, your Macedonia deployment.
[01:12:49.562 --> 01:12:51.083]  This is going to be for your Iraq deployment.
[01:12:51.123 --> 01:12:58.988]  And by their third or fourth training op, they go, and in case there's a terror attack in America, you know, we can't have citizens running around with guns.
[01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:01.530]  Boy, that would cause a breakdown of authority.
[01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:06.033]  But the first thing we've got to do ahead of a containment area is confiscate the firearms.
[01:13:07.334 --> 01:13:09.395]  And I've got it in police training manuals.
[01:13:09.415 --> 01:13:10.836]  You've heard police call in as well.
[01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:15.179]  They're telling the cops, you know, we can't have citizens with guns during a bio-outbreak.
[01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:18.261]  That's why we've got to have gun control before it happens.
[01:13:20.484 --> 01:13:21.305]  Which is ridiculous.
[01:13:21.325 --> 01:13:24.927]  I mean, you want an armed citizenry during... that will stop riots.
[01:13:25.507 --> 01:13:26.748]  That will stem riots.
[01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:30.211]  The last thing you want is just the criminals being armed.
[01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.612]  And look, the government knows that.
[01:13:33.533 --> 01:13:36.015]  And so, they've built the FEMA cities.
[01:13:36.055 --> 01:13:36.915]  That's mainstream.
[01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:42.719]  They have set all this up, and... But, you know, they had this set up back in the 80s.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.120]  With Rex 84.
[01:13:46.682 --> 01:13:49.564]  Now, they've just radically expanded it.
[01:13:50.589 --> 01:13:55.811]  And I'll tell you what, I'm just going to have the callers hold for a minute because... No, we'll finish up the call.
[01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:57.332]  I don't need to really spend time on this.
[01:13:58.032 --> 01:14:06.015]  Coming up, I will get to it this hour, these reports were going to get nuked any minute.
[01:14:06.055 --> 01:14:07.315]  What's really behind that?
[01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:08.976]  So we'll get into that.
[01:14:09.656 --> 01:14:11.737]  I've got to move quicker here, just these calls are so good.
[01:14:12.746 --> 01:14:15.687]  Let's talk to Michael in New Orleans.
[01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:16.467]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.428]  Hey Alex, a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:14:18.508 --> 01:14:20.149]  Real quick, you talk about the Disney World thing.
[01:14:20.169 --> 01:14:23.950]  I went with my family, wife and two girls to Disney World earlier this year.
[01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:29.412]  Same thing, got a four-day ticket, didn't realize until you get there and you're in line that they want to get your fingerprints.
[01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:37.835]  So, I, being relatively awake and understanding what the deal is, swapped and did the wrong two fingers for the first time.
[01:14:38.676 --> 01:14:41.279]  Uh, and, you know, got let in, no problem.
[01:14:41.479 --> 01:14:45.042]  And, of course, I had to deprogram my daughters right afterwards and explain what it was for.
[01:14:46.143 --> 01:14:50.947]  But then the next day, I swapped cards with my wife, and, of course, it rejected them.
[01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:53.429]  And the guy was like, you know, explaining to me why.
[01:14:53.469 --> 01:14:54.650]  And I said, well, why do we need to do this?
[01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.913]  He said, well, just to make sure that you are the right person who has the ticket.
[01:14:58.273 --> 01:15:00.475]  I said, well, who's to say I was the right person in the first place?
[01:15:01.178 --> 01:15:06.522]  And he, of course, had no answer and he just was, obviously, they trained him for the single question response.
[01:15:06.782 --> 01:15:08.463]  Did he tell you it's not your fingerprint?
[01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:17.569]  Um, he tried to go there, but I was like, yeah, whatever, and I walked on past and, you know, of course, they had to, again, deprogram my family and explain to them what this was.
[01:15:17.589 --> 01:15:18.310]  It's just conditioning.
[01:15:19.283 --> 01:15:32.392]  Now understand, understand, it cost as much to get a one day as to get a four day or a six month or whatever, and so they don't even tell you, and then you heard them through and everybody does it.
[01:15:32.732 --> 01:15:34.113]  Now there's no choice.
[01:15:34.213 --> 01:15:36.374]  That's the announcement we knew would go to them.
[01:15:36.674 --> 01:15:43.499]  Sure, sure, and then really it doesn't even affect you once you get in there, except if you want to use the speed pass, and you've got to stick your card in there, and it rejects it.
[01:15:43.799 --> 01:15:47.321]  Well they have people already standing next to the little speed pass lines, which are the ones where you don't
[01:15:47.694 --> 01:15:48.455]  You don't have to wait in line.
[01:15:48.475 --> 01:15:49.215]  You come back later.
[01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:54.719]  Well, they have people there, and when you have a problem, you just say, hey, look, I've got a problem with this, because, again, you got rejected in the front gate.
[01:15:54.879 --> 01:15:56.761]  So, it won't let you do any speed passes.
[01:15:56.781 --> 01:16:01.104]  Well, as long as you talk to the person and say, hey, I've got a problem with this thing, it won't work, they'd sign it or whatever, and you go through.
[01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.905]  That's what we did every other day.
[01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:05.087]  Michael, let me warn you about something.
[01:16:06.408 --> 01:16:08.970]  Have you ever seen my film, America Destroyed by Design?
[01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:11.011]  Uh, part of it, yeah.
[01:16:11.212 --> 01:16:12.272]  I've got most of your films.
[01:16:12.432 --> 01:16:14.354]  Have you seen, well, the part where I'm
[01:16:15.356 --> 01:16:16.957]  Arrested for refusing to thumb scan?
[01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:17.798]  Yes, I saw that.
[01:16:17.818 --> 01:16:19.379]  I've seen that a couple of times, yeah.
[01:16:19.399 --> 01:16:26.865]  Okay, well, the reason I mention that is because after I got arrested, I got all these emails and phone calls.
[01:16:26.985 --> 01:16:27.786]  Ha ha!
[01:16:28.206 --> 01:16:30.087]  You got fingerprinted anyways!
[01:16:31.288 --> 01:16:34.671]  People thought that I just cared about myself.
[01:16:35.912 --> 01:16:39.054]  That was the view that they were looking at the world from.
[01:16:39.074 --> 01:16:41.136]  You know, their own personal me, me, me, me, me.
[01:16:41.903 --> 01:16:44.525]  Well, when you really do care about yourself, you care about everybody else.
[01:16:45.465 --> 01:16:46.326]  We're all interconnected.
[01:16:47.147 --> 01:16:48.527]  That's what these fools don't understand.
[01:16:49.348 --> 01:16:52.130]  And so I use the analogy of Rosa Parks.
[01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:56.573]  Black woman refuses to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:57.653]  Her feet were tired.
[01:16:58.254 --> 01:17:01.236]  She wanted to sit down in the front of the bus where it was cooler.
[01:17:04.069 --> 01:17:06.151]  People didn't laugh at her when she got arrested.
[01:17:06.451 --> 01:17:09.474]  She wasn't there for Rosa Parks individually.
[01:17:09.514 --> 01:17:16.140]  She was there against this injustice of inequality and being in a different cast.
[01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:30.472]  Now, expanding on that, Rosa Parks could have painted her face up in white clown makeup and maybe posed as a white woman.
[01:17:31.602 --> 01:17:35.345]  But, again, it wasn't about her individually getting around the system.
[01:17:36.126 --> 01:17:41.250]  I mean, I could have gone in and put my thumb on its side, which I did go ahead and get a license, and I did do that, by the way.
[01:17:44.617 --> 01:17:46.318]  We're getting into a warfare situation here.
[01:17:46.338 --> 01:17:47.459]  I've got to still be able to fly.
[01:17:47.839 --> 01:17:48.720]  So I've warned people.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.560]  I've protested it.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.041]  I've fought it.
[01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:51.501]  I did that to get attention to it.
[01:17:51.521 --> 01:17:52.942]  Didn't have a license for five years.
[01:17:53.463 --> 01:17:56.685]  And finally went ahead and got one so I can get out of this country if I need to.
[01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.266]  You know, that's the main reason.
[01:17:58.926 --> 01:18:01.608]  But it's also a trap door where then they can track and trace me.
[01:18:01.948 --> 01:18:11.214]  Yeah, and I appreciate your analogy you've given in the past where, you know, your camouflage is, you know, I've got a t-shirt and khaki shorts or whatever for those who would, you know, lean to the militant side.
[01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:16.668]  You know, our, as true patriots, our camouflage is just that.
[01:18:17.988 --> 01:18:23.490]  Well, yeah, that's what I'm wearing right now is a blue shirt and blue jeans and a pair of dress shoes.
[01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:29.952]  I mean, because would I stand out if I was wearing camo in the middle of the city?
[01:18:30.392 --> 01:18:30.932]  Exactly.
[01:18:31.452 --> 01:18:33.093]  Well, thanks for your time, Alex.
[01:18:33.313 --> 01:18:35.314]  Hey, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:18:36.694 --> 01:18:39.115]  And when I go address the city council, I wear a suit and tie.

[01:20:52.732 --> 01:20:56.635]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:56.855 --> 01:21:09.145]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:09.966]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.006 --> 01:21:15.590]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:18.192]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.053 --> 01:21:21.115]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:23.998]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:30.145]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:22:38.302 --> 01:22:38.922]  We don't want to
[01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:10.672]  Get around the biometric scanners at Disney World and SeaWorld.
[01:23:11.072 --> 01:23:13.713]  Because nobody told me two years ago SeaWorld put these in.
[01:23:14.374 --> 01:23:21.596]  You just heard the newscast last hour where SeaWorld and others are going to follow suit now and make you biometrically scan.
[01:23:22.176 --> 01:23:25.358]  They already penalized you at SeaWorld hundreds of dollars, literally.
[01:23:26.538 --> 01:23:31.600]  In value, it's more money to buy a one day pass than to get a season pass.
[01:23:33.786 --> 01:23:36.366]  And if you get the season pass, you've got to get the biometrics.
[01:23:37.767 --> 01:23:42.688]  And so, you know, I just told the lady no, and she said, yeah, a lot of people are saying no.
[01:23:43.828 --> 01:23:45.108]  And so she let me on through.
[01:23:45.948 --> 01:23:47.829]  But see, now they're not letting you through.
[01:23:47.869 --> 01:23:50.029]  Now they're saying, hey, you've got to do it.
[01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:54.010]  And so, call Disney World.
[01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.010]  And tell them, I'm not going.
[01:23:58.851 --> 01:24:01.191]  And I'm going to start my own little personal website.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.261]  Against biometrics.
[01:24:03.321 --> 01:24:06.063]  And over the years, even if you don't promote it, you'll get thousands of visitors.
[01:24:06.704 --> 01:24:08.265]  And I'm going to expose what you're doing.
[01:24:08.325 --> 01:24:18.373]  And if everybody starts doing that, the Disney World... I mean, they think the protest against them putting, you know, profane stuff in their shows costs them money.
[01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:25.759]  Wait till this... I mean, look what happened to Kmart when they tried to have Rosie O'Donnell, Mrs. Gun Grabber, as their spokeswoman.
[01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.657]  So we've got to get serious.
[01:24:29.857 --> 01:24:32.358]  I mean, I am never taking my children to Disney World.
[01:24:33.678 --> 01:24:37.640]  I am never taking my children again to SeaWorld.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:38.800]  Shouldn't anyways.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:39.860]  They're mean to those animals.
[01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:44.642]  I'm not taking my children to any place that has biometrics.
[01:24:46.303 --> 01:24:50.024]  I mean, already folks, most of the tanning salons, not that you should be doing that.
[01:24:50.345 --> 01:24:52.505]  Notice these are all things that really aren't good for you to begin with.
[01:24:53.586 --> 01:24:56.467]  Almost all the tanning salons now make your thumb scans.
[01:24:57.505 --> 01:24:58.886]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[01:24:59.566 --> 01:25:01.007]  And I don't mean to be getting off into this.
[01:25:01.927 --> 01:25:06.829]  Years ago, I was Mr. Biometric, Mr. Anti-Police State, because I saw it coming.
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.771]  Now it's really passé.
[01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:23.557]  But we can't get desensitized to, you know, five TV reports every day, and twenty newspaper articles every day, and, you know, just constant, oh, it's so wonderful, Biometrics, oh, so good, go to the head of the line, save money, oh, it's wonderful.
[01:25:25.951 --> 01:25:31.296]  I'm sorry if you weren't with our customer, our trusted customer deal, our preferred customer deal.
[01:25:31.896 --> 01:25:34.859]  Those strawberries will be $5.99 instead of $3.95.
[01:25:35.319 --> 01:25:40.704]  It would be so easy if you just enrolled.
[01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:43.346]  Just put your fingers here, sir, and sign this form.
[01:25:43.386 --> 01:25:44.527]  It's so easy!
[01:25:45.648 --> 01:25:46.289]  Come on!
[01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:48.831]  Why won't you just give me a good deal on the strawberries?
[01:25:49.131 --> 01:25:50.773]  Why do you want me to scan so badly?
[01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:53.694]  There I go.
[01:25:53.814 --> 01:25:54.735]  I got Lemon Bombing.
[01:25:54.815 --> 01:25:56.116]  I got Nuke Bombing News.
[01:25:56.796 --> 01:26:00.898]  I gotta get to it, but I just... It's happening, folks!
[01:26:01.398 --> 01:26:01.919]  It's happening!
[01:26:02.119 --> 01:26:09.022]  Hey, you don't come in our business, our health club, our Mickey Mouse operation, and you don't have this.
[01:26:09.082 --> 01:26:09.663]  Pun intended.
[01:26:10.543 --> 01:26:14.225]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in New York.
[01:26:14.285 --> 01:26:15.005]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:16.226]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:16.286 --> 01:26:16.826]  How's it going?
[01:26:17.187 --> 01:26:21.629]  I have two things that I wanted you to comment on.
[01:26:22.199 --> 01:26:32.322]  One was, uh, on Thursday somebody spoke to you about, um, you know, um, government, how they're trying to, um, instill, uh, biochemicals in you and everything.
[01:26:32.722 --> 01:26:37.143]  Well, in New York City, they had, several years ago, about, uh, the West Nile virus.
[01:26:37.563 --> 01:26:41.264]  And it was a whole big hubbub to do about it, and they sprayed all of New York with it.
[01:26:42.185 --> 01:26:46.726]  And, uh, now all of a sudden, several years later, nobody cares about it.
[01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:50.382]  Yeah, now they still spray them, and it's no big deal.
[01:26:50.702 --> 01:26:51.262]  Oh, that's shit!
[01:26:51.282 --> 01:27:14.148]  Well, they released an unnamed bacteria up in Tulsa, a mock bubonic plague attack, and then two years ago, they sprayed every town, I mean, literally, it was like 35 towns, every major town and city in Oklahoma, with this, what was it, subtilis globigii, which then we went to the encyclopedia, and it said it's a dangerous bacteria.
[01:27:14.789 --> 01:27:15.989]  Subtilis globigii!
[01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:32.115]  And they sprayed, how do I remember the name, Subtilish Globogy all over the place, which causes, by the way, spontaneous abortions in mammals, and respiratory problems in the old, the young, and the infirm.
[01:27:32.676 --> 01:27:37.720]  So yeah, they did release gases in the New York subways.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.121]  Anything else?
[01:27:39.761 --> 01:27:42.363]  And then also on the whole finger scanning thing,
[01:27:42.827 --> 01:27:50.612]  I mean, I worked also for a big-time Fortune 500 company, and before I was employed with them, they did a background check.
[01:27:50.672 --> 01:27:52.494]  But this is before the background check.
[01:27:52.554 --> 01:27:54.976]  They took fingerprints of me.
[01:27:55.676 --> 01:28:00.099]  And before that, I was kind of like prodding myself on how I was never on record and blah, blah.
[01:28:00.459 --> 01:28:02.321]  But now, you know, listening to you and
[01:28:03.143 --> 01:28:05.504]  Realizing that now I am definitely on record.
[01:28:05.544 --> 01:28:06.765]  Yeah, that was the old days.
[01:28:06.805 --> 01:28:07.606]  You used to.
[01:28:07.946 --> 01:28:12.709]  You stole a car, robbed a bank, or, you know, knocked a policeman's teeth out.
[01:28:13.049 --> 01:28:14.070]  You got fingerprinted.
[01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:20.473]  Now you pay them thousands of dollars to go to their stupid Disney World.
[01:28:20.814 --> 01:28:22.635]  Thousands of dollars to go there and get there.
[01:28:22.655 --> 01:28:27.378]  And you buy all the... I mean, it's also even employment.
[01:28:27.438 --> 01:28:29.339]  I mean, you can't get away from this particular
[01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:31.230]  Finger-scanning thing, you know?
[01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.271]  Oh yeah, they're thumb-scanning everywhere to get jobs!
[01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:34.012]  Exactly, sir!
[01:28:34.072 --> 01:28:35.293]  It's the new freedom!
[01:28:35.953 --> 01:28:38.555]  It's so good to submit to it!
[01:28:39.055 --> 01:28:40.456]  Government loves you!
[01:28:43.658 --> 01:28:44.599]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.079 --> 01:28:46.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:50.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.587 --> 01:28:55.188]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:28:55.348 --> 01:28:59.429]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:28:59.589 --> 01:29:02.470]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:09.272]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:29:09.432 --> 01:29:12.453]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:15.054]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:29:15.154 --> 01:29:23.056]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:29:23.376 --> 01:29:34.665]  Maltazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[01:32:03.095 --> 01:32:09.197]  Look, I'm going to take one more call from Janice, and then I'm going to cover news, and then later we'll go back to your calls.
[01:32:09.578 --> 01:32:14.259]  The toll-free number to join us, of course, is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:20.242]  Let's go ahead and go to Janice in Texas.
[01:32:20.262 --> 01:32:21.042]  Janice, go ahead.
[01:32:21.902 --> 01:32:30.545]  Alex, I've had a report that I have come across, and it's just recently, it's from the CFR, and it's building a North American community.
[01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:31.466]  Yeah.
[01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:38.251]  And I haven't heard any, I've looked on your website and been waiting for you to make some comments on it.
[01:32:38.852 --> 01:32:54.563]  Well, about a month ago, or about five weeks ago, we had Mr. Priest on the show, the head of the, no it's Mr. Pastor, excuse me, Pastor Priest, I mispronounced that.
[01:32:54.583 --> 01:32:55.283]  I had Mr. Pastor
[01:32:59.637 --> 01:33:24.375]  Uh, on the broadcast, the head CFR member over that committee, and we have posted, uh, the Old Book Canadian paper saying it's the end of their sovereignty, and we posted the Lou Dobbs transcript from about a month ago, when, uh, he talked about it, and it is the Pan-American Union, and they're scheduled to try to pass that, if not this week or next week, as well as the Patriot Act and our new Supreme Court, uh, leader.
[01:33:25.276 --> 01:33:25.796]  Oh, okay.
[01:33:27.193 --> 01:33:29.134]  So I have just, this is old news to you then.
[01:33:29.454 --> 01:33:30.795]  No, it's not old news.
[01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:33.276]  It's going on right now and we should be talking more about it.
[01:33:33.296 --> 01:33:34.416]  Okay.
[01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:37.217]  It's just, I mean, there's so much coming at us from so many different angles.
[01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.998]  It's just like, I mean, tell us what you think about it.
[01:33:40.759 --> 01:33:43.140]  Well, to begin with, it's treasonous.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:51.303]  And outside of destroying our borders, our economy, and our judicial system, you know, there's not much else that you can say.
[01:33:51.343 --> 01:33:56.205]  I mean, there's just so much to say about it that it's just, you know, where he's
[01:33:56.664 --> 01:34:05.788]  He's supposed to be protecting our borders, he's given them away, and of course he's already started the destruction of our economy with NAFTA and CAPTA and everything else.
[01:34:06.008 --> 01:34:23.457]  Well what this does, first and foremost, it shows the power of the Council on Foreign Relations because three months ago, they released a report, and within a month of the report being released, the full House
[01:34:24.879 --> 01:34:33.808]  is moving in the Parliament in Canada to implement it, and the Congress is moving within two months to implement it, and Mexico is moving to implement it.
[01:34:34.108 --> 01:34:41.135]  The governments of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada have all taken the plan and are implementing it wholesale!
[01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:47.081]  And that's what the CFR does, is it's 2,000, now 500 members, they've expanded their number,
[01:34:47.972 --> 01:34:58.500]  They're like the real House of Commons, and then above that you have the real Imperial Senate with only about 140 members, the Bilderberg Group.
[01:34:59.244 --> 01:35:13.410]  And literally, the head of the CFR and others, they all go, sit at the table, and are literally told at Bilderberg, we've got hundreds of witnesses, people who've been inside, we've got their own documents, we predict what's going to happen in the next two years, or the next year, off of what we get from these spies.
[01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:14.550]  I mean, this is accurate stuff.
[01:35:14.831 --> 01:35:27.496]  And literally, you know, Queen Beatrice before she died, and the British Royalty, and the Rothschilds, and the Rockefellers, literally hash it all out, and then people are brought before them, and they give them orders.
[01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:30.291]  And you will get me the world tax!
[01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:33.372]  We will invade Iraq in March of 03, not 02!
[01:35:33.712 --> 01:35:34.672]  Is it understood?
[01:35:34.692 --> 01:35:38.114]  I mean, literally, down to even bowing to them.
[01:35:38.534 --> 01:35:39.054]  Ah, yes.
[01:35:39.574 --> 01:35:40.014]  Oh, yes.
[01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:42.215]  I mean, isn't that disgusting?
[01:35:42.575 --> 01:35:45.156]  So it shows the power of the CFR.
[01:35:46.917 --> 01:35:51.919]  With its 2,500 members over banking, industry, academia, media.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.981]  The scientific areas.
[01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:57.883]  All these key people that steer society.
[01:35:58.083 --> 01:36:01.965]  And they tell most of the 2,500 members, oh, you're part of something great.
[01:36:02.266 --> 01:36:04.247]  You're part of something guarding society.
[01:36:04.487 --> 01:36:07.549]  It's really about co-opting most of them, making them feel like they're part of them.
[01:36:07.849 --> 01:36:08.829]  It's the Delphi Method.
[01:36:08.849 --> 01:36:12.652]  They get them all in these big meeting halls and they sign non-disclosure agreements.
[01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:14.613]  We're going to have bio-release!
[01:36:14.653 --> 01:36:15.894]  The enemy's going to attack!
[01:36:16.255 --> 01:36:17.175]  What are we going to do?
[01:36:17.656 --> 01:36:20.778]  Well, Dr. Grebel over here has a plan to stop it.
[01:36:21.058 --> 01:36:24.962]  It's total martial law, but it's for the betterment of America!
[01:36:25.302 --> 01:36:30.106]  And our counterpart, the head of the Royal Institute of International Affairs from the Tavistock Institute is here!
[01:36:30.466 --> 01:36:31.787]  Dr. Schneebelbob!
[01:36:32.047 --> 01:36:33.368]  What do you say about the plan?
[01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:35.610]  Excellent plan, Lord Wilford!
[01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:38.793]  I mean, literally, this is the type of stuff that goes on
[01:36:40.126 --> 01:36:40.926]  I'm out of control.
[01:36:41.326 --> 01:36:42.007]  I'm sorry, Janice.
[01:36:42.027 --> 01:36:42.407]  No, you're not.
[01:36:42.847 --> 01:36:43.427]  Anything else?
[01:36:43.847 --> 01:36:45.407]  No, that was it.
[01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:49.008]  I guess I just missed you completely with it and I just knew you would have something to say.
[01:36:51.429 --> 01:36:53.630]  Keep staying in there for us.
[01:36:54.210 --> 01:37:00.031]  All I can say is that I think more and more people are waking up and that's something.
[01:37:00.191 --> 01:37:02.072]  Well, they really are, Janice, and thanks for the call.
[01:37:03.212 --> 01:37:04.572]  Here's your legislative update.
[01:37:04.692 --> 01:37:06.953]  Congressman Ron Paul's office contacted me this morning.
[01:37:07.647 --> 01:37:11.423]  I am just... what a great congressman to actually be contacting us to give us info.
[01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:21.089]  Congressman Ron Paul's office has notified InfoWars.com that Patriot Act reauthorization is set to pass the House on Thursday or Friday.
[01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:30.632]  As things stand now, there may be less votes against the legislation this time than for the vote on October 27, 2001 that first passed it.
[01:37:31.192 --> 01:37:39.394]  Paul's office said that they're throwing everything at them at once, taft of the Supreme Court nomination, and making the Patriot Act permanent.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:46.883]  Every American needs to contact Congress and tell them to control our borders and not butcher the Bill of Rights.
[01:37:47.263 --> 01:37:50.005]  Remember, Congress wasn't even allowed to read the first Patriot Act.
[01:37:50.305 --> 01:37:52.686]  This time, they know what they're doing.
[01:37:52.746 --> 01:37:53.947]  They just hope we don't.
[01:37:55.187 --> 01:37:57.908]  And they're going to rescind two tiny, petty provisions.
[01:37:58.309 --> 01:38:07.653]  Again, all this fat that was in the bill, that literally was put in there like a vestigial limb, that never did anything.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:13.001]  And those are the two sections they're repealing, and they're even adding some of their language and making it worse.
[01:38:13.061 --> 01:38:15.502]  So, at least they're not getting ALL of Patriot 2.5.
[01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:21.824]  Because, again, in 2003, they passed part of Patriot Act, what, on December 13th?
[01:38:22.364 --> 01:38:24.924]  Same day they announced the capture of Saddam.
[01:38:27.005 --> 01:38:30.786]  Okay, this is really Patriot Act 2.5.
[01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:35.127]  So this is just cementing their gains.
[01:38:36.267 --> 01:38:37.988]  Alright, but it is horrible.
[01:38:38.775 --> 01:38:43.377]  Man, now I've got to get into the London Bombing here, and this is, you talk about, you talk about voluminous.
[01:38:43.397 --> 01:38:59.544]  You know, I guess there's no real order to all of this, there's just so much evidence and so many developments, so let me just go through them, then I'll get into the, just, pell-mell, 24-7 news cycle, we're going to be nuked, we're going to be nuked, give all your rights up.
[01:39:01.004 --> 01:39:05.306]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, let's be clear, the media is, the establishment media,
[01:39:07.768 --> 01:39:08.688]  El Nasser!
[01:39:09.789 --> 01:39:12.669]  I challenge you to find bomb links.
[01:39:13.649 --> 01:39:22.251]  London Mirror, the biochemist arrested after the London Terror Blast yesterday, said he had known one of the bombers, but challenged police to link him to the crime.
[01:39:22.891 --> 01:39:33.053]  Egyptian Mahdi El Nasser, currently held in Cairo, denied involvement in the blast during an interview
[01:39:34.079 --> 01:39:35.560]  attended by British police.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:46.946]  A 33-year-old helped to arrange the lease of a flat in Leaves used by the bombers and was thought to have been friendly to Jeremy Lindsay.
[01:39:50.348 --> 01:39:51.649]  Jermaine Lindsay.
[01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:59.814]  But yesterday he insisted he only knew bus bomber Hasib Hussain and had no knowledge of his plans.
[01:40:01.368 --> 01:40:06.070]  The divorced dad of one said he asked me for help in finding shelter in Leeds.
[01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:09.991]  I set up a place for him in the house of an Iraqi doctor.
[01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:15.453]  I never visited the house and did not plan to finance, assist, manufacture explosives.
[01:40:16.073 --> 01:40:21.015]  You know, I don't know what the truth is here about this, but this guy fits the M.O.
[01:40:22.636 --> 01:40:23.876]  of an intelligence officer.
[01:40:25.197 --> 01:40:26.117]  He fits the M.O.
[01:40:26.137 --> 01:40:27.558]  just from what I've read and seen of him.
[01:40:28.838 --> 01:40:29.298]  Not very
[01:40:31.523 --> 01:40:33.845]  He could easily have been the handler.
[01:40:34.926 --> 01:40:47.136]  Now, I'm not saying that, but the way they nab him and use him for effect, and then it looks like they're going to release him and the Egyptians are saying, oh no, we trust him.
[01:40:47.436 --> 01:40:51.700]  I mean, the Egyptians have huge torture camps where they torture whoever our government wants.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.322]  They fly them there to torture them on the Red Sox jet.
[01:40:55.563 --> 01:40:56.064]  You don't believe me?
[01:40:56.104 --> 01:40:56.564]  Just type it in.
[01:40:57.136 --> 01:40:58.077]  That's just so bizarre.
[01:40:58.577 --> 01:41:00.119]  And it's stranger than fiction.
[01:41:00.639 --> 01:41:02.441]  And so they'd get whatever they wanted out of this guy.
[01:41:03.322 --> 01:41:10.989]  And in the past, the globalists used Egyptians, Salam to cook the bomb and train the driver in the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:41:11.789 --> 01:41:23.540]  But he thought it was for a drill or exercise in a sting, rolled into one, and so when they said go ahead with the event, he went and recorded them saying that to protect himself.
[01:41:24.318 --> 01:41:34.303]  So, I don't know that about this guy, but the mere fact that he did... We just go after 9-11 template and other past templates.
[01:41:35.784 --> 01:41:48.851]  Because you'll have a CIA or FBI informant, who's really an agent or asset, and they will provide the houses, you know, in San Diego, in San Francisco, in Florida, for the hijackers.
[01:41:50.227 --> 01:41:51.568]  They will get them credit.
[01:41:51.648 --> 01:41:54.288]  They will get them money wired to them.
[01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:56.049]  They'll get them credit cards.
[01:41:57.109 --> 01:42:02.591]  And then it comes out later, oh, the guy that was the landlord, he was the... So that's usually the M.O.
[01:42:02.671 --> 01:42:07.572]  The handler is the landlord, or assist with things like that.
[01:42:08.253 --> 01:42:12.774]  And then the Muslims just think they're part of a drill, part of an anti-terror operation.
[01:42:13.414 --> 01:42:17.275]  That's why they're living with topless dancers and using drugs and drinking Jack Daniels.
[01:42:17.976 --> 01:42:19.476]  These people aren't even Muslims.
[01:42:20.519 --> 01:42:25.361]  Uh, but, uh, in this case, uh, we just don't know.
[01:42:25.421 --> 01:42:27.442]  I mean, this guy could be as pure as the Durban Snow.
[01:42:29.923 --> 01:42:31.183]  But it doesn't look good.
[01:42:31.203 --> 01:42:35.785]  Let's just say that my stink detector is activated, and I am smelling something.
[01:42:35.825 --> 01:42:37.125]  Let's just say, well, I'm not gonna say it.
[01:42:38.306 --> 01:42:39.806]  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:42:40.567 --> 01:42:41.027]  Oh, boy.
[01:42:41.527 --> 01:42:45.708]  Ah, and, um, suicide theory thrown into doubt.
[01:42:45.728 --> 01:42:47.049]  This is out of the Herald Sun.
[01:42:48.459 --> 01:42:52.580]  It's also been in the Independent and several other major British newspapers.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.561]  War on Terror.
[01:42:54.621 --> 01:43:06.364]  British police are considering the possibility that the four key suspects in last week's London attacks may have been tricked into setting off their bombs, a British newspaper has reported.
[01:43:07.624 --> 01:43:15.926]  We do not have hard evidence that the men were suicide bombers, a Scotland Yard spokesman
[01:43:17.549 --> 01:43:19.590]  told the Sunday Telegraph.
[01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:23.951]  It is possible that they did not intend to die.
[01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:24.991]  No kidding.
[01:43:25.671 --> 01:43:31.253]  According to the paper, one police hypothesis is that the bombers were tricked by a master.
[01:43:32.093 --> 01:43:33.273]  Oh, we were first to say that.
[01:43:33.293 --> 01:43:36.034]  Because it's the classic MO, you guys.
[01:43:36.434 --> 01:43:43.296]  Who told them they would have time to escape, when in fact the devices were set to go off immediately.
[01:43:45.956 --> 01:43:48.278]  Well then how would they go off immediately?
[01:43:48.879 --> 01:43:52.382]  I guess they just believed the story and pulled the activating device?
[01:43:52.762 --> 01:43:53.342]  Or hit the button?
[01:43:53.943 --> 01:44:02.110]  The bombers, masters, might have thought that they couldn't risk the four men being caught and spilling everything to British interrogators.
[01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:05.733]  An unnamed security official told the newspaper.
[01:44:06.193 --> 01:44:11.578]  No, if this was a real Islamicist attack, the people would have planted the bombs and left.
[01:44:12.384 --> 01:44:16.966]  And even if they got caught, there was nobody that they could rat out because the person would have already run to the country.
[01:44:17.346 --> 01:44:18.726]  And they would have taken credit for it.
[01:44:19.927 --> 01:44:21.027]  Oh, this is so ridiculous.
[01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:33.852]  Lending weight to the theory is the fact that all four men paid their parking tickets before boarding a train at Lutton for King's Cross as they all had brought return tickets.
[01:44:34.682 --> 01:44:52.249]  Moreover, the paper said, the men carried the explosives in rucksacks, not strapped their bodies, as is common practice among suicide bombers, and they did not cry, Allah Akbar, or God is great, before setting off the charge, something most Middle Eastern suicide bombers do.
[01:44:54.029 --> 01:44:55.450]  Well, yeah, you've got to get fired up.
[01:44:55.470 --> 01:45:00.332]  You're not laughing and slapping each other on the back and happy, as that video shows and the stills show.
[01:45:01.405 --> 01:45:04.747]  I mean, those guys were at ease, at rest, they were like they were about to party.
[01:45:05.427 --> 01:45:11.270]  After we run this drill, boy, we're going to be getting 2,000 pounds apiece, and I'm going partying!
[01:45:12.111 --> 01:45:13.051]  Yeah, that's what you think.
[01:45:13.331 --> 01:45:15.232]  That's what you think.
[01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:21.876]  Folks, if you ever get approached by the government to take part in an exercise or a drill, do not do it.
[01:45:22.116 --> 01:45:22.756]  Please.
[01:45:23.157 --> 01:45:24.537]  There's a good chance they're going to kill you.
[01:45:25.458 --> 01:45:25.818]  Or they'll
[01:45:26.528 --> 01:45:30.730]  Grab you, say you did it, drug you up for two or three years, put you on trial, you'll be up there drooling.
[01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:32.931]  Mike McVeigh and Ellen, you know.
[01:45:33.471 --> 01:45:43.276]  The fact that one of the bombers was decapitated, a common outcome for suicide bombers, is also seen as supporting the theory, as well as the fact that the investigators discovered no timed devices.
[01:45:44.256 --> 01:45:50.539]  Police have based their theory that the attacks were suicide bombings, largely around the fact that all four suspects died in the attacks.
[01:45:51.559 --> 01:45:57.601]  Again, the fact that one of the bombers was decapitated, a common outcome for suicide bombers, is also seen as a supporting theory.
[01:45:59.062 --> 01:46:00.182]  That it was suicide bombers.
[01:46:00.662 --> 01:46:03.803]  First, it was over 45 minutes.
[01:46:04.964 --> 01:46:06.344]  Then it was over 20 minutes.
[01:46:06.384 --> 01:46:08.185]  Then it was instantaneous.
[01:46:08.685 --> 01:46:18.088]  Now, we know the bus was waved in after the trains got blown up, waved in by police out of hundreds of buses, waved in, that's admitted, waved into a special spot
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.441]  The police all start standing around, and they back off, and boom!
[01:46:23.361 --> 01:46:26.302]  And blood splatters on the Tavistock Institute's door.
[01:46:26.982 --> 01:46:28.122]  In Tavistock Square.
[01:46:32.543 --> 01:46:34.243]  I mean, this is really getting ridiculous.
[01:46:36.164 --> 01:46:37.744]  This is so out of control.
[01:46:39.424 --> 01:46:45.545]  So, that's just some of the news, and again, I've got several other articles saying the same thing.
[01:46:45.585 --> 01:46:47.126]  Like, these guys don't fit the M.O.
[01:46:47.146 --> 01:46:47.906]  suicide bombers.
[01:46:48.453 --> 01:46:54.637]  These guys, you know, the criminologists are coming out of the woodwork going, we studied this.
[01:46:54.717 --> 01:46:58.399]  Terror experts are coming out of the woodwork going, you weren't on the payroll.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.440]  We studied this.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.401]  This doesn't fit.
[01:47:02.562 --> 01:47:03.563]  None of this fits.
[01:47:04.944 --> 01:47:06.084]  But, and here's another one.
[01:47:06.905 --> 01:47:08.566]  Iraqi experts accuse U.S.
[01:47:08.606 --> 01:47:10.407]  forces of being behind car bombings.
[01:47:11.168 --> 01:47:13.109]  We'll get to that a little bit later also.
[01:47:13.649 --> 01:47:16.131]  Former Vietnam combat and commercial pilot
[01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:23.398]  Firm believer 9-11 was inside job, experienced Boeing 757-767 pilot.
[01:47:23.858 --> 01:47:28.799]  He says no way could a novice fly the big birds he knew so well.
[01:47:29.379 --> 01:47:35.621]  Russ Wittenberg says America has turned into a police state with martial law on the immediate horizon.
[01:47:36.721 --> 01:47:41.942]  He said America needs to wake up before it's too late and all constitutional rights are stripped away.
[01:47:41.962 --> 01:47:43.022]  We're going to be getting
[01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:47.064]  Russ Wittenberg on the transmission.
[01:47:47.644 --> 01:47:56.129]  I also want to get that Air Force Colonel who was the Dean of the Defense Language School in Monterey who went public about government involvement.
[01:47:57.369 --> 01:47:59.631]  And the media demonized him and you never heard of him again.
[01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:03.673]  And when I talked to him at the time, he couldn't do interviews under threat of arrest.
[01:48:04.153 --> 01:48:05.794]  A court-martial, though they dropped that.
[01:48:06.294 --> 01:48:11.917]  But I need to... Somebody needs to... If I don't get it done, somebody needs to get him on.
[01:48:12.237 --> 01:48:14.138]  That's another big whistleblower we forget about.
[01:48:14.918 --> 01:48:22.661]  The dean out there was forced to train some of the hijackers and he wasn't very happy about that.
[01:48:22.741 --> 01:48:24.041]  Train them in spy techniques.
[01:48:24.441 --> 01:48:27.002]  They were good officers for the New World Order.
[01:48:27.522 --> 01:48:29.103]  He was suspicious of them all along.
[01:48:29.963 --> 01:48:32.004]  Oh, we're not supposed to talk about that, are we?
[01:48:32.244 --> 01:48:32.564]  OK.
[01:48:34.845 --> 01:48:38.146]  And a new development too from KTOK Oklahoma TV.
[01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:45.133]  Newspaper claims former DOJ officials confirmed bombing cover-up in Oklahoma City.
[01:48:45.834 --> 01:48:48.436]  I mentioned that yesterday, but I do want to spend some time on it.
[01:48:48.776 --> 01:48:50.137]  Got news like this coming up too.
[01:48:50.197 --> 01:48:51.858]  Tattooed fruit is on its way.
[01:48:51.879 --> 01:48:53.360]  Mmm, yummy.
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:01.846]  And a nuclear knife aimed at America's heart, PDD-60, and how that ties into Top Chinese General, warns U.S.
[01:49:01.866 --> 01:49:03.847]  that they will destroy 200 U.S.
[01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:05.909]  cities.
[01:49:05.949 --> 01:49:07.010]  But when we get back from break,
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:31.397]  I want to get into another smoking gun that Benjamin Netanyahu was indeed warned, I mean now this has been admitted in triplicate, that he did get a warning not to go out into the street and take a cab to his speaking engagement and then about 30 minutes after he got that warning the bombs started going off.
[01:49:33.058 --> 01:49:34.539]  So that is confirmed!
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:36.521]  But it first came out
[01:49:37.139 --> 01:49:39.002]  And the Associated Press from Israeli Radio.
[01:49:39.423 --> 01:49:42.007]  Then the media said, well, it's unconfirmed, it's not true.
[01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:45.152]  And now that it's been proven true, they don't want to talk about it.
[01:49:45.653 --> 01:49:48.398]  We need to force the mainstream media to talk about it.
[01:49:49.419 --> 01:49:50.241]  More straight ahead.
[01:49:54.562 --> 01:49:57.425]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.665 --> 01:49:59.246]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.587 --> 01:50:04.271]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.611 --> 01:50:09.055]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.475 --> 01:50:13.659]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.879 --> 01:50:14.480]  The Constitution
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.060]  We're good to go.
[01:50:38.217 --> 01:50:44.264]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:50:44.344 --> 01:50:47.968]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:53.684 --> 01:50:58.909]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.049 --> 01:51:07.156]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:14.462]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.582 --> 01:51:15.543]  We're good to go!
[01:51:45.042 --> 01:52:02.028]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:52:02.288 --> 01:52:04.668]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:52:04.909 --> 01:52:06.849]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:52:07.209 --> 01:52:12.551]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:52:12.951 --> 01:52:17.233]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:52:17.673 --> 01:52:25.575]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with this 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:52:25.776 --> 01:52:32.838]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:52:33.338 --> 01:52:36.501]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[01:53:03.556 --> 01:53:09.881]  Mossad Chief confirms Netanyahu's warning of London bombings from anti-war.
[01:53:11.503 --> 01:53:28.957]  The controversy continues over an Associated Press story detailing remarks of a senior Israeli official who claimed that Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London for an economic conference was warned by Scotland Yard minutes in advance of the terrorist bombings.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:39.764]  According to the original story, Netanyahu's prior knowledge was the cause of his not showing up at the conference, which took place at a hotel near the Liverpool Underground Station.
[01:53:40.545 --> 01:53:48.828]  A subsequent AP report contained the Israeli government's denial of a prior warning, and claimed that Netanyahu received a warning after the blast.
[01:53:50.302 --> 01:53:59.966]  Although the AP's first story was never retracted, that didn't prevent Israel American Amen Corner from claiming that it had been withdrawn.
[01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:09.630]  Nor did it stop Stratfor from coming out with an analysis claiming that Israel knew days in advance and that it wasn't Scotland Yard that informed Netanyahu.
[01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:14.712]  Former intelligence analyst Tommy Preston of Preston Global concurred.
[01:54:15.538 --> 01:54:25.845]  My own column, drawing on these sources, grew fire, not only from the usual suspects, but also from Daily Kiosk, Democratic Party website, spawned by the Dean campaign.
[01:54:26.266 --> 01:54:29.748]  Anti-war is not a legitimate source, declared one poster.
[01:54:30.308 --> 01:54:32.270]  That's the establishment trying to keep you in line.
[01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:39.215]  This from a website that headlined, Did Bush Company Tip Off London Bombers?
[01:54:41.936 --> 01:54:44.018]  A author who goes by the name
[01:54:44.798 --> 01:54:51.664]  DMMI manufactured a quote, purportedly from me, that was nothing more than a crude fabrication.
[01:54:52.165 --> 01:55:01.473]  It had quote marks around it, and it hadn't been written in, which is, and it goes on, which in reality, I had written no such thing.
[01:55:01.994 --> 01:55:02.775]  And then it goes on.
[01:55:02.815 --> 01:55:03.335]  Their point?
[01:55:04.016 --> 01:55:07.479]  That to even suggest that Netanyahu had advanced
[01:55:08.098 --> 01:55:18.193]  Notice of the London bombings is so obviously anti-semitic conspiracy theory that no discussion is required regardless of what the Associated Press reports.
[01:55:19.873 --> 01:55:29.959]  The Cossacks, as they call themselves, are trying to clean their act up so that they can be more closely associated with the Democratic Party apparatus.
[01:55:30.019 --> 01:55:33.281]  However, why limit themselves to condemning my column?
[01:55:33.621 --> 01:55:40.946]  Why not condemn AP as well as an illegitimate source for publishing the news of Netanyahu's foreknowledge to begin with?
[01:55:41.446 --> 01:55:45.889]  And while they're at it, they need to add a few more media sources to the list
[01:55:46.631 --> 01:55:49.873]  Including some of the Israeli media.
[01:55:50.253 --> 01:55:58.316]  Israeli insider cited Mossad chief Meir Dagan in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
[01:55:58.817 --> 01:56:08.101]  The Mossad office in London received advance notice of the attacks, but only six minutes before the first blast, the paper reports, confirming an earlier AP report.
[01:56:08.501 --> 01:56:14.624]  As a result, it was possible to take any action to prevent... It was impossible to take any action to prevent the blast.
[01:56:15.064 --> 01:56:17.887]  Now that's what the Israeli intelligence chief told the newspaper.
[01:56:18.768 --> 01:56:22.771]  Here is the article in German and a Google translation.
[01:56:23.632 --> 01:56:26.434]  Is this just empty boasting on the part of the Mossad chief?
[01:56:26.975 --> 01:56:29.998]  Or is there some truth in the initial AP report?
[01:56:30.258 --> 01:56:34.462]  We have the Mossad chief later going, it's true, but only six minutes before.
[01:56:35.503 --> 01:56:36.604]  So it's confirmed!
[01:56:36.684 --> 01:56:39.206]  I mean, now the Mossad chief is anti-Semitic.
[01:56:41.832 --> 01:56:56.743]  We report you decide, he goes on to say, I might add that some of the Daily Kiosk folks are shocked, shocked that Antiwar.com opposed the Kosovo War, why in turn, they are shocked at the hypocrisy of those who support a war of aggression against the country of Slavia!
[01:56:58.723 --> 01:57:02.665]  They had never attacked us, and that was never sanctioned by the United Nations.
[01:57:03.046 --> 01:57:13.132]  So then anti-war goes on to say, if not sanctioned by our leaders, the United Nations, the Libertarians, they must be sanctioned by the United Nations.
[01:57:14.793 --> 01:57:16.254]  That's not why it was illegitimate.
[01:57:17.915 --> 01:57:27.741]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, enough babbling from I. We shall return with the third hour, masses of news on more government whistleblowers,
[01:57:28.744 --> 01:57:31.546]  And your phone calls PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:33.386 --> 01:57:37.288]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:38.409]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.429 --> 01:57:39.089]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.610]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.104 --> 01:57:52.165]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.886 --> 01:57:53.987]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.628 --> 01:57:55.509]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:57.130]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.791 --> 01:58:01.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.975 --> 01:58:06.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.187 --> 01:58:16.488]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:23.474]  We are now into the third and final hour of this live Tuesday edition.
[01:58:23.494 --> 01:58:26.216]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:27.818 --> 01:58:40.448]  I want to get into some more on biometrics coming up later, because now it isn't just you get half price if you thumb scan at Disney World and at SeaWorld and the rest of it.
[01:58:41.148 --> 01:58:44.271]  Now they're going to make you do it, period, to get in the park.
[01:58:45.507 --> 01:58:52.891]  And it's going in all over the place, and I have a CBS News piece that says, oh, you go to the front of the line if you biometrically scan to get on an airplane.
[01:58:53.331 --> 01:58:55.392]  But then within a few years, you'll all have to do it.
[01:58:55.912 --> 01:59:01.495]  And the feds have already passed a national ID card law that makes you biometrically get scanned in at the state level.
[01:59:01.935 --> 01:59:04.517]  So it's so many serious ramifications.
[01:59:04.857 --> 01:59:05.937]  We've got to fight this.
[01:59:05.957 --> 01:59:06.598]  That's coming up.
[01:59:08.059 --> 01:59:11.600]  Also, they're set to pass, reauthorize the Patriot Act coming up on Thursday.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.681]  We've got Ron Paul coming up.
[01:59:13.457 --> 01:59:19.439]  I believe tomorrow, his office contacted us and gave us the latest details.
[01:59:19.479 --> 01:59:21.179]  Those are on InfoWars.com.
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:29.122]  Also, some more experts and insiders going public about government involvement in 9-11.
[01:59:29.662 --> 01:59:30.442]  We'll be getting to that.
[01:59:30.542 --> 01:59:39.865]  And the first thing I'm going to get to, though, after some calls, the first thing I'm going to get to is this situation
[01:59:41.211 --> 01:59:50.078]  With the media saying Al-Qaeda works with the Mexican gangs and they're going to nuke us any minute.
[01:59:50.118 --> 01:59:53.720]  Now that is just not true on its face.
[01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:56.543]  Am I saying there isn't a threat?
[01:59:57.323 --> 02:00:01.986]  Oh, there's a very real threat of a device going off.
[02:00:02.107 --> 02:00:06.930]  But believe me, it isn't going to be Ahmed and Poncho that do it.
[02:00:07.711 --> 02:00:08.051]  Okay.
[02:00:09.546 --> 02:00:12.107]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:00:13.007 --> 02:00:14.347]  Let's go to Ron in New York.
[02:00:14.427 --> 02:00:15.087]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:00:15.907 --> 02:00:21.248]  Oh, Alex, can't you drown yourself in cognitive dissidence and enjoy the new Soviet-style America?
[02:00:21.268 --> 02:00:25.529]  Because that's what you'd have to do, and that's what we're coming to.
[02:00:25.549 --> 02:00:36.631]  There was a report, and this Thursday, along with the, of course, reauthorization of the Patriot Act, they are voting on the House of Representatives H.R.
[02:00:37.714 --> 02:00:45.241]  1195.
[02:00:37.994 --> 02:00:45.241]  Now what that bill is, and I believe they're going to take it up in committee, I believe the Homeland Security Committee, they're trying to vote it out of there.
[02:00:46.312 --> 02:00:55.500]  It's something we spoke about a year ago, something like that, in which they want people to be deprived of the right to own firearms if they're on a terrorist suspect list.
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:59.063]  To break it down real easy for the audience, it's as simple as this.
[02:00:59.103 --> 02:01:13.375]  Yeah, no, it's gun registration, and now even if you've never been convicted, it's actually a terror and crime watch list, and then you won't be able to buy- I've got the testimony of FBI Director Mueller in front of them admitting all of this, Ron.
[02:01:13.915 --> 02:01:14.115]  Right.
[02:01:14.155 --> 02:01:16.176]  No, he testified, I think, in March about that.
[02:01:16.216 --> 02:01:18.417]  But understand something... Well, he's a Republican.
[02:01:18.457 --> 02:01:19.337]  Everything's okay.
[02:01:19.578 --> 02:01:23.099]  Alex, all you need to wind up on that list is mere suspicion and innuendo.
[02:01:23.139 --> 02:01:27.961]  There's no due process required for you to... Well, due process is Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:28.662 --> 02:01:30.022]  I guess in their mind.
[02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.703]  I guess in Soviet America it is.
[02:01:32.023 --> 02:01:34.864]  And we could see this week or next week the passage of CAFTA.
[02:01:35.124 --> 02:01:36.165]  I mean, it's a nightmare.
[02:01:37.247 --> 02:01:40.771]  Well, they're throwing a number of things at the Congress all at once.
[02:01:41.112 --> 02:01:44.396]  That's what Ron Paul said this morning.
[02:01:44.676 --> 02:01:51.085]  With this thing, basically speaking, you would have people who are on a list similar to the no-fly list.
[02:01:51.125 --> 02:01:52.506]  They got there, they don't know how.
[02:01:53.147 --> 02:01:54.647]  They weren't put there by anything.
[02:01:54.687 --> 02:02:00.669]  But magically every time it's a train bomber or a plane bomber, magically they're on the list.
[02:02:01.309 --> 02:02:01.929]  In the country.
[02:02:02.109 --> 02:02:05.850]  But then they get ordered to be allowed in.
[02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:13.351]  Just like they claim that the mastermind of the London bombing was on the list, came to the United States, the authorities in the U.S.
[02:02:13.371 --> 02:02:16.472]  knew it, led him into the borders to go visit his mommy in Cleveland.
[02:02:16.932 --> 02:02:24.377]  But I guarantee you, John Q., public American citizen, decent human being, will have the weight of the entire system brought against him.
[02:02:24.397 --> 02:02:25.598]  Oh, have you heard the latest?
[02:02:26.299 --> 02:02:26.939]  No, no.
[02:02:26.979 --> 02:02:32.723]  I mean, I thought it was the latest, but... Oh, well, then there's just a bunch of moves to actually pay illegals to come here now.
[02:02:32.963 --> 02:02:43.110]  Well, Alex, if you could hold me over, I'd like to mention something that Maxine Waters, who's supposed to be a representative from the left, so a few people out there think the left is going to help you... Well, stay there.
[02:02:43.130 --> 02:02:44.351]  I'll let you finish briefly.
[02:02:45.228 --> 02:02:46.729]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.929 --> 02:02:50.012]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.152 --> 02:02:54.054]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.094 --> 02:02:58.317]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.678 --> 02:03:02.440]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:04.382]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.662 --> 02:03:07.885]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:07.925 --> 02:03:12.630]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:15.853]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.033 --> 02:03:18.896]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.376 --> 02:03:25.502]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.022 --> 02:03:29.827]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.228 --> 02:03:31.590]  Order your video today.
[02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:33.011]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:35.334]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[02:03:44.733 --> 02:03:46.353]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.493 --> 02:03:50.594]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.734 --> 02:03:53.595]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.695 --> 02:04:00.417]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.597 --> 02:04:03.597]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:03.798 --> 02:04:06.198]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.318 --> 02:04:14.200]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:25.804]  Platizine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:04:25.945 --> 02:04:33.728]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.748 --> 02:04:34.148]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.228 --> 02:04:35.928]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:44.981 --> 02:04:51.862]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:52.402 --> 02:04:57.803]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:58.223 --> 02:05:08.265]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:08.365 --> 02:05:10.685]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:10.705 --> 02:05:14.146]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:05:14.606 --> 02:05:15.807]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:15.907 --> 02:05:18.788]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:05:19.068 --> 02:05:23.390]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:25.411]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:25.731 --> 02:05:37.497]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:42.339]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:49.772 --> 02:05:50.412]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.072 --> 02:05:52.152]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.853 --> 02:05:53.933]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:55.454]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.174 --> 02:05:58.094]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.114 --> 02:06:01.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.916 --> 02:06:06.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.538 --> 02:06:11.279]  Ron in New York always calls him on something interesting.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:13.360]  And yes, he's right.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.401]  Not only is Capta set to pass the House here in the next week or two,
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:45.203]  Central American Free Trade Agreement, not only are we going to have the Patriot Act and expand it, not only are we looking at, well, just a whole bunch of other really bad things coming down the line, we also have a gun control bill that the Attorney General and FBI Director support, that if you're quote on a terror watch list or a criminal crime list,
[02:06:46.894 --> 02:06:48.235]  Basically Patriot Act stuff.
[02:06:50.377 --> 02:06:53.140]  But everybody has to be run through this other database.
[02:06:54.722 --> 02:06:56.523]  And if you're on that list, you can't get a gun.
[02:06:57.264 --> 02:06:58.765]  So now, no due process.
[02:06:59.206 --> 02:07:03.370]  And this is going to be just expanded and expanded and expanded.
[02:07:04.382 --> 02:07:06.224]  But Ron, finish up what you were going to say.
[02:07:06.805 --> 02:07:12.690]  And yes, what I was saying is that Maxine Waters, of course, who's a congressperson, who's a representative of the left, made a statement.
[02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:19.797]  And I want to say this just in case you have some listeners who think the left is going to save us from the tiger paw on the right.
[02:07:20.658 --> 02:07:26.503]  Um, she said, well, I don't see why there should be an objection to this, and of course referring to this here list that we're discussing.
[02:07:27.003 --> 02:07:35.990]  She says you've given up your right to medical confidentiality, and you've given up your right to confidentiality of what books you, you borrow from the library, so why not give this up too?
[02:07:36.791 --> 02:07:38.112]  That's your left in this country.
[02:07:38.212 --> 02:07:39.172]  She really said that?
[02:07:39.473 --> 02:07:39.653]  Yes.
[02:07:40.033 --> 02:07:41.794]  Well, you know, thanks for the call, Ron.
[02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:43.796]  You know, here's the parallel.
[02:07:45.337 --> 02:07:46.418]  Here's a parallel to that.
[02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:51.734]  It'd be like if you were on your roof fixing, uh, say, a satellite dish.
[02:07:52.894 --> 02:07:53.935]  And you fell off.
[02:07:55.436 --> 02:07:58.519]  And you broke both of your legs.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.582]  And when the ambulance got there, you said, help me, help me.
[02:08:03.383 --> 02:08:06.045]  And they said, well, no sir, we're... Why should we?
[02:08:06.325 --> 02:08:09.668]  I mean, why should we... Why should we fix your legs?
[02:08:09.728 --> 02:08:10.768]  I mean, they're both broken.
[02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:14.031]  Uh, in fact, let's just break your arms.
[02:08:14.832 --> 02:08:16.373]  Because these are broken anyways.
[02:08:17.293 --> 02:08:17.694]  No!
[02:08:17.934 --> 02:08:21.440]  We should be upset about breaking our legs and trying to fix them.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:23.423]  Not, oh my goodness, you know.
[02:08:23.904 --> 02:08:25.546]  You've been shot three times in the chest.
[02:08:25.566 --> 02:08:27.610]  Here, let's shoot you five more times in the head.
[02:08:28.743 --> 02:08:30.004]  And I hear this all the time.
[02:08:30.605 --> 02:08:35.730]  It's like the head of Oracle came out and said, I want to give people the system free for the national ID card.
[02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:37.552]  We all need tracker chips on us.
[02:08:37.972 --> 02:08:39.914]  I mean, you've already given up all your data.
[02:08:39.954 --> 02:08:41.716]  Private corporations are already doing it.
[02:08:42.036 --> 02:08:43.898]  Yeah, and causing all the identity theft.
[02:08:44.278 --> 02:08:45.940]  It's like 80 something percent.
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:47.441]  This is the FedZone numbers.
[02:08:48.983 --> 02:08:53.407]  80 plus percent of identity theft is corporations selling data to each other.
[02:08:54.156 --> 02:08:57.520]  Every time you hear about Bank of America loses millions, this bank loses millions.
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:00.083]  It's never somebody hacked in and got it.
[02:09:00.903 --> 02:09:04.988]  It's always they sold it to a company that then sold it to some other company.
[02:09:05.408 --> 02:09:07.070]  Or sold it to a dummy company.
[02:09:07.751 --> 02:09:10.434]  And again, you'll see that in the back of the paper, whenever it's the nightly news.
[02:09:11.688 --> 02:09:16.072]  3,000 names stolen from a university server, uh, by a hacker!
[02:09:16.092 --> 02:09:20.175]  And it's some zip-faced 18-year-old going, gee, I was just having fun!
[02:09:20.195 --> 02:09:24.678]  They didn't even sell the names, didn't even get the names, just came into contact with them.
[02:09:24.858 --> 02:09:29.722]  You know, if they come in contact with names, if they get into where names are, it's considered they've been stolen.
[02:09:30.042 --> 02:09:34.626]  So they'll hype up, uh, 3,000 names were stolen from the library computer!
[02:09:34.886 --> 02:09:36.587]  Oh, it's horrible hacking!
[02:09:36.607 --> 02:09:38.989]  Oh, identity theft is horrible!
[02:09:40.442 --> 02:09:56.576]  But when your bank account gets sucked dry by somebody, by some monkey, you know, in some foreign third world country, folks, 80 plus percent of the time they got that through another subsidiary company that bought that debt.
[02:09:57.697 --> 02:10:00.920]  Or their cousin who runs the gas station.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:02.161]  This is one of the big areas.
[02:10:03.002 --> 02:10:04.163]  When I say 80 percent, that's
[02:10:05.166 --> 02:10:05.907]  It's like 83%.
[02:10:05.947 --> 02:10:06.828]  That's all the numbers.
[02:10:06.908 --> 02:10:10.331]  People selling data, people stealing your credit card at the gas station.
[02:10:10.651 --> 02:10:11.231]  That makes up 80%.
[02:10:11.311 --> 02:10:12.352]  It's something like 17%.
[02:10:12.973 --> 02:10:15.595]  Again, I saw this a few months ago.
[02:10:15.655 --> 02:10:16.336]  I'm going from memory.
[02:10:16.836 --> 02:10:17.817]  I think it's like 17%.
[02:10:18.197 --> 02:10:23.021]  It was actually internet type scams and people hacking.
[02:10:23.762 --> 02:10:24.763]  Okay?
[02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:26.504]  80 plus percent is all the other stuff.
[02:10:26.544 --> 02:10:27.405]  And what is the other stuff?
[02:10:28.763 --> 02:10:32.825]  It's not just companies selling data, that's the lion's share of the 83%.
[02:10:33.866 --> 02:10:52.215]  A big part of it is, and it's mainly foreigners because they've got the country to operate out of, though other people have been caught doing it too, and when you go in and use that credit card, when you go in and they make an imprint of that card, especially, it's a real, real thing you should worry about.
[02:10:53.135 --> 02:10:56.117]  When you go in and use the ATM, they're running.
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:58.601]  Uh, and it's on another company.
[02:10:59.161 --> 02:11:01.502]  That data, they can take that and sell that.
[02:11:01.963 --> 02:11:11.107]  And then they, again, mail that or fax that or email that to their cousin, uh, in Bangladesh, and then boy, he goes to town on you.
[02:11:12.648 --> 02:11:15.729]  So, that's what's going on here.
[02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:19.491]  But no, they're not going to do anything about that or prosecute.
[02:11:20.532 --> 02:11:22.473]  Basically, there's no prosecution of this stuff.
[02:11:23.092 --> 02:11:37.842]  No, they're just going to, well, track and trace everybody else and restrict the internet and make you have an ID number when you get online and get rid of any privacy you have because it's all your fault there's identity theft.
[02:11:38.463 --> 02:11:42.565]  When the internet is the safest place to buy things.
[02:11:44.186 --> 02:11:47.829]  Other than paying cash at a brick and mortar store.
[02:11:47.909 --> 02:11:49.330]  That is the safest thing you can do.
[02:11:50.251 --> 02:11:52.112]  Is pay cash at a brick and mortar store
[02:11:54.358 --> 02:11:58.601]  The next safest thing you can do is buy things off of a secure shopping cart.
[02:11:58.701 --> 02:11:59.782]  I've studied all this.
[02:12:01.043 --> 02:12:06.046]  And how they're demonizing the Internet and calling for all this regulatory control is a fraud.
[02:12:06.666 --> 02:12:09.308]  Okay, let's go to Larry in Arizona.
[02:12:09.328 --> 02:12:09.949]  Larry, go ahead.
[02:12:09.969 --> 02:12:10.889]  Hi Alex.
[02:12:11.229 --> 02:12:11.369]  Hi.
[02:12:11.389 --> 02:12:22.057]  Speaking on what you just said, I used to work in customer service for a cell phone company and when people would call to pay their bills with me because they felt unsafe about the Internet, I paid through the Internet in the office.
[02:12:22.777 --> 02:12:24.058]  There's no getting around it.
[02:12:25.555 --> 02:12:26.075]  Exactly.
[02:12:26.916 --> 02:12:30.478]  Okay, the reason I'm calling today, Alex, is I got this really good book.
[02:12:30.538 --> 02:12:32.640]  It's called Final Warning, A History of the New World Order.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:42.286]  It's comprehensive, 500 pages, and I wanted to throw a couple things out at you, and we're going to go, you know, into history today, and I want to get your response to these things that I'm reading out of this book.
[02:12:44.167 --> 02:12:49.470]  You brought some of this up last week about the Civil War, that there were outside interests, outside countries involved.
[02:12:50.451 --> 02:12:52.192]  This book says that it was
[02:12:53.526 --> 02:13:05.328]  The bankers, the international bankers instigated the Civil War and that England was planning to take the northern states and make it part of Canada after the war.
[02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:14.810]  And also it says that Jefferson Davis offered the French, Louisiana and Texas if the French would come in on the southern side.
[02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.811]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:13:16.751 --> 02:13:18.071]  That's just historical fact.
[02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:25.212]  Well, if that's true then, was Abraham Lincoln justified in the emergency measures that he used to save the country?
[02:13:25.233 --> 02:13:26.994]  Well, the globalists went either way.
[02:13:27.074 --> 02:13:34.418]  Then they killed him, and the bankers put their dictatorship back in with Grant, and got it anyways.
[02:13:35.166 --> 02:13:38.907]  And then that's when the martial law really began, was at the end of the Civil War.
[02:13:38.927 --> 02:13:46.009]  Then we got Posse Comitatus in 1878 to supposedly counter that martial law, and now we see that being erased.
[02:13:46.029 --> 02:13:51.191]  But the key dates are in the late 1860s, and then through 1933 with the War Powers Act, 1947 National Security Act,
[02:13:58.283 --> 02:14:01.024]  And then right up to today with Patriot Act and Homeland Security.
[02:14:01.424 --> 02:14:03.144]  It's just expansions of all of this.
[02:14:03.624 --> 02:14:09.986]  So again, people always say either the North was good or the South was bad or the South was good and the North was bad.
[02:14:11.286 --> 02:14:11.946]  I'm a Southerner.
[02:14:12.606 --> 02:14:14.687]  You know, I mean, I got a lot of family from East Texas.
[02:14:15.227 --> 02:14:18.668]  And that was really, you know, the cutoff line there for really being in the war.
[02:14:19.694 --> 02:14:22.436]  And the North did horrible things.
[02:14:22.897 --> 02:14:24.338]  Horrible raping and pillaging.
[02:14:24.818 --> 02:14:27.580]  The South had a lot of real grievances.
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.303]  And the North really was trying to dominate Western expansion.
[02:14:32.223 --> 02:14:35.686]  But the British were manipulating the South.
[02:14:35.846 --> 02:14:37.567]  They were setting the South up.
[02:14:37.907 --> 02:14:39.588]  They did have the 20,000 troops up in Toronto.
[02:14:44.068 --> 02:15:12.285]  They were planning to invade, they were manipulating both sides, and so again, it isn't either one side's good, the other side's bad, it's that the globalists, they manipulated this entire thing, ordered it out of chaos, and it didn't go exactly as the British wanted, because the Tsars, who were fighting with the British arm of the globalists, were
[02:15:13.746 --> 02:15:21.632]  Okay, now also according to this book, the Rothschilds and their minions tried to set up a new world order after Napoleon
[02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:57.638]  And, um, that was broken up because, um, Czar Nicholas, uh, got wind of, uh, the Rothschilds being behind it, and he's the one that, uh, uh, he didn't, he didn't join it, and so that caused the, the collapse, and that's why... And so they took him out in 1970.
[02:15:57.698 --> 02:16:04.981]  Right, that's why, as revenge, that Russia was chosen as the country to have the, uh, Bolshevik Revolution later on.
[02:16:05.921 --> 02:16:09.803]  Plus, it was perfectly, uh, perfectly prepared for it.
[02:16:12.361 --> 02:16:22.369]  Okay, Alex, thanks for everything you do, and the news that you're putting out today about the thumb printing and Disney World, it's getting real close.
[02:16:22.409 --> 02:16:23.730]  We all gotta stay prayed up.
[02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:25.371]  Well, thank you.
[02:16:26.552 --> 02:16:29.614]  Oh, look, all over the country, they're going in every business you can imagine.
[02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:35.979]  Five years ago, it was for employees to clock in, and now it's just everything.
[02:16:35.999 --> 02:16:39.542]  Steve, Steve, where are you calling this from?
[02:16:39.562 --> 02:16:40.362]  From Kansas.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.701]  And it's Al Qaeda, Steve.
[02:16:43.521 --> 02:16:45.283]  We're not in Kansas anymore, Steve.
[02:16:45.703 --> 02:16:46.463]  No, we're not.
[02:16:46.644 --> 02:16:47.104]  Go ahead.
[02:16:47.124 --> 02:16:48.325]  I mean, it's America.
[02:16:48.665 --> 02:16:58.552]  No, I was calling about the CAFTA thing, and I called my senators here in Kansas, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts.
[02:16:59.012 --> 02:17:01.033]  Both of them voted for CAFTA.
[02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:10.880]  Sam Brownback's answer to, and I was talking, obviously, to their assistants, but it was to help the beef.
[02:17:11.954 --> 02:17:13.274]  Industry in Kansas.
[02:17:13.614 --> 02:17:18.395]  And that's actually going to really annihilate the beef industry all over the country.
[02:17:18.755 --> 02:17:23.837]  Well, I tried to explain that to him and, you know, I wasn't getting anywhere.
[02:17:23.997 --> 02:17:26.917]  Oh, funny that the different beef associations are against it.
[02:17:27.717 --> 02:17:30.838]  Yes, and then Pat Roberts... Oh, but he says they're for it!
[02:17:31.338 --> 02:17:33.919]  And we're not taking your thumbprint, we're just scanning you.
[02:17:34.659 --> 02:17:36.339]  And Mercury's good for you, stay there.
[02:17:37.119 --> 02:17:39.880]  I'm just taking three more calls, folks, I got a bunch of news to cover.

[02:21:45.380 --> 02:22:05.890]  Alright, Steve in Kansas, go ahead and finish up the points you were making.
[02:22:06.071 --> 02:22:14.735]  Pat Roberts, talking to his assistant, said that it was not even debatable now because it's passed.
[02:22:15.569 --> 02:22:19.350]  I called the House, Dennis Moore and Jim Ryan.
[02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:21.290]  Jim Ryan still has to give back to me.
[02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:31.792]  Dennis Moore, they took my concerns and he will send me a letter and he's leaning towards it because it may help America.
[02:22:31.812 --> 02:22:34.953]  Now, I'm asking the people of Kansas.
[02:22:36.673 --> 02:22:40.194]  You know, I mean, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, they have to go.
[02:22:40.994 --> 02:22:41.694]  They have to go.
[02:22:42.195 --> 02:22:44.095]  Because if you're going to destroy America,
[02:22:45.461 --> 02:22:46.402]  With your vote?
[02:22:46.902 --> 02:22:48.703]  I mean, you know, come on.
[02:22:48.883 --> 02:22:51.425]  We're all American citizens here.
[02:22:51.845 --> 02:23:02.752]  No, and for those who don't know, and I appreciate the call, Steve, I mean, CAFCA starts merging our police, our social security, our laws, our vitamin rules.
[02:23:02.852 --> 02:23:03.793]  I mean, it's horrible!
[02:23:04.213 --> 02:23:11.098]  And then economically, you know, the smaller beef organizations, you know, they're actually grass-rich, we're all against it.
[02:23:11.478 --> 02:23:13.079]  Now, the big massive meat packers,
[02:23:14.125 --> 02:23:17.206]  It's just, you know, most of the markets run by three or four big companies.
[02:23:17.586 --> 02:23:21.747]  They're for it, because they want that cheap meat out of Latin America.
[02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:26.148]  And under this, it won't be listed, it won't be marked, there won't be any tariffs.
[02:23:26.848 --> 02:23:28.849]  And our meat's not going to be going down there, folks.
[02:23:28.869 --> 02:23:33.290]  I mean, you really want some cow that a vampire bat's been sucking on?
[02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:36.151]  What do you think those vampire bats feed on down in Guatemala?
[02:23:37.251 --> 02:23:37.811]  I'm not kidding.
[02:23:37.831 --> 02:23:40.492]  Just type in vampire bats, Guatemala, cows.
[02:23:40.832 --> 02:23:41.692]  It's disgusting!
[02:23:42.708 --> 02:23:44.349]  Their beef has a lot of problems too.
[02:23:45.329 --> 02:23:46.369]  It's just disgusting.
[02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:51.131]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:23:51.191 --> 02:23:54.052]  Let's talk to Ken in Texas.
[02:23:54.092 --> 02:23:54.713]  Go ahead, Ken.
[02:23:55.033 --> 02:23:55.893]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:23:56.333 --> 02:23:56.593]  Good.
[02:23:56.894 --> 02:24:01.615]  Hey, right now I'm showing one of your shows on my account, Cable 28 in Fort Worth, The Access Channel.
[02:24:02.336 --> 02:24:04.657]  You know, you haven't called in about a year or two, Ken.
[02:24:04.677 --> 02:24:05.297]  It's been a while.
[02:24:05.317 --> 02:24:05.957]  It's been a while.
[02:24:05.977 --> 02:24:10.559]  Hey, I've been making cable access shows in Fort Worth and showing conspiracy books.
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:13.821]  I just stack them up on a table and show them to people.
[02:24:13.901 --> 02:24:14.502]  Let them go find them.
[02:24:16.563 --> 02:24:19.545]  So how long have you been doing your TV show in Fort Worth?
[02:24:20.225 --> 02:24:20.365]  Oh, 99.
[02:24:21.886 --> 02:24:24.167]  And I would imagine it's probably gotten pretty popular.
[02:24:24.628 --> 02:24:29.110]  I hope so, but anyway, right now one of your shows is showing on cable 28 in Fort Worth.
[02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:29.811]  Good.
[02:24:29.911 --> 02:24:30.691]  I show everybody.
[02:24:30.751 --> 02:24:34.534]  My stuff, your stuff, everybody's stuff I can get on it that people need to see.
[02:24:34.834 --> 02:24:38.156]  I still think that they're in a panic and no Constitutional Convention was held.
[02:24:39.591 --> 02:24:41.652]  That's just my opinion and all this stuff that's going on.
[02:24:41.912 --> 02:24:43.533]  Hey, you want that toll-free number to Congress?
[02:24:44.633 --> 02:24:47.234]  Sure!
[02:24:47.254 --> 02:24:49.755]  1-866-877-HILL.
[02:24:49.776 --> 02:24:52.257]  1-866-877-HILL.
[02:24:52.557 --> 02:24:58.039]  Hey, and get on your gas bills and your water bills and put down STOP-F-T-A-A and STOP-C-A-F-T.
[02:24:58.079 --> 02:24:59.480]  Put it on your checks and everything.
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.121]  It's gotta be STOP.
[02:25:02.361 --> 02:25:03.902]  Well, I'll tell you something, Ken.
[02:25:04.682 --> 02:25:08.984]  You know, 20 years ago, if 90% of us were against something, they didn't do it.
[02:25:09.895 --> 02:25:12.658]  Now, everybody's against all these policies.
[02:25:13.138 --> 02:25:14.620]  Everybody's against the Patriot Act.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:16.602]  Everybody's against open borders.
[02:25:16.622 --> 02:25:18.183]  Everybody's against CAFTA.
[02:25:18.724 --> 02:25:20.706]  But they're still just doing it!
[02:25:20.866 --> 02:25:22.948]  Yeah.
[02:25:22.988 --> 02:25:26.471]  I tell ya, it's just... I think they call that tyranny and despotism.
[02:25:26.491 --> 02:25:27.012]  I think so.
[02:25:27.232 --> 02:25:30.495]  Hey, I wrote Popper Mechanics and told them they were conspiracy bunkers.
[02:25:31.976 --> 02:25:32.477]  No answer!
[02:25:35.074 --> 02:25:38.275]  Well, did you, uh, I hope you dropped your subscription.
[02:25:38.555 --> 02:25:42.135]  No, I don't take it, but I did see it, but I just call them conspiracy debunkers.
[02:25:42.495 --> 02:25:48.776]  Hey, what's the deal with this, uh, S-1266 in the Senate with the FBI sticking their nose in gun sales and stuff?
[02:25:49.396 --> 02:25:50.377]  That's a bad bill, too.
[02:25:50.737 --> 02:25:52.417]  Yeah, and Lord Bush supports it.
[02:25:52.837 --> 02:25:52.997]  Yep.
[02:25:53.477 --> 02:25:57.358]  Tell your Senator to vote against S-1266.
[02:25:59.418 --> 02:26:00.418]  Anything else, Ken?
[02:26:00.458 --> 02:26:03.059]  Hey, it's good talking to you, and I'll be talking to you another time.
[02:26:03.179 --> 02:26:03.819]  You keep it up.
[02:26:04.945 --> 02:26:07.666]  Let's talk to last call, because I've got a bunch of news to cover.
[02:26:08.166 --> 02:26:08.986]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:26:09.006 --> 02:26:10.046]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:26:10.527 --> 02:26:11.247]  New Mexico.
[02:26:11.627 --> 02:26:12.007]  Welcome.
[02:26:13.027 --> 02:26:14.048]  Yeah, I have a question.
[02:26:14.148 --> 02:26:28.091]  If Rothschilds and Rockefellers are the snakehead puppeteers more than Bush and Cheney, how come I heard on the news that this legislator, Jay Rockefeller, said something against the U.S.
[02:26:28.131 --> 02:26:30.372]  staying in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[02:26:31.604 --> 02:26:35.610]  Well, that's all part of the... I mean, you've seen WWF wrestling.
[02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:36.372]  Yeah.
[02:26:36.592 --> 02:26:40.037]  And then, you know, the wrestler gets up there and goes, you're going down!
[02:26:40.057 --> 02:26:41.880]  You know, Hobgoblin?
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.226]  And then the guy says, no, Hobgoblin, you're going down.
[02:26:46.031 --> 02:26:48.972]  And, uh, I mean it's a staged fight.
[02:26:49.492 --> 02:26:54.634]  Or you're going down Pork Chop, no you're going down Hobgoblin, you know whatever stupid name they've got.
[02:26:55.174 --> 02:26:59.875]  Undertaker, The Rock, you know, Macho Man, whatever those idiots names are.
[02:26:59.895 --> 02:27:01.836]  I mean, it's staged.
[02:27:02.276 --> 02:27:04.517]  He's up against Jack McLam.
[02:27:05.697 --> 02:27:06.437]  Jack McLam?
[02:27:06.777 --> 02:27:07.577]  Yeah, what about Jack?
[02:27:08.258 --> 02:27:12.279]  He thinks more than you, he has an attitude that the Cheney Bush or the
[02:27:13.904 --> 02:27:18.808]  ...are the puppeteers because they and their cronies and their investments in Halliburton, etc.
[02:27:18.828 --> 02:27:19.829]  benefit by U.S.
[02:27:19.889 --> 02:27:22.951]  military spending towards... You know, I listened to Jack.
[02:27:22.991 --> 02:27:24.012]  I haven't heard him say that.
[02:27:24.373 --> 02:27:25.253]  You want to talk about it?
[02:27:25.914 --> 02:27:26.134]  Sure.
[02:27:26.394 --> 02:27:27.015]  Well, stay there.
[02:27:27.055 --> 02:27:28.536]  We'll come back, Jeff, in New Mexico.
[02:27:29.537 --> 02:27:31.118]  I bet it's pretty in New Mexico right now.
[02:27:32.239 --> 02:27:32.919]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.782 --> 02:27:36.702]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.163 --> 02:27:38.804]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.685 --> 02:27:42.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:52.041 --> 02:29:52.861]  Read the labels.
[02:29:53.281 --> 02:29:57.423]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.

[02:30:34.659 --> 02:30:35.339]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:36.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.637 --> 02:31:00.338]  So, we know what the globalist plans are.
[02:31:00.538 --> 02:31:04.079]  A cashless society, control grid, everything we do being tracked and traced.
[02:31:04.939 --> 02:31:06.540]  Forced drugging of the population.
[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:09.661]  Citizenry crammed into tight, compact cities.
[02:31:10.041 --> 02:31:11.001]  Heavily policed.
[02:31:11.942 --> 02:31:13.502]  A militarized world government.
[02:31:15.143 --> 02:31:16.543]  And I'm just trying to stop that.
[02:31:16.603 --> 02:31:17.704]  I'm trying to fight that.
[02:31:17.744 --> 02:31:19.804]  I'm trying to defend against that.
[02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:24.666]  And so, who sits on the black throne at Mount Doom
[02:31:25.603 --> 02:31:29.764]  Doesn't really matter as much as fighting the enemy that's in front of us.
[02:31:30.284 --> 02:31:48.627]  But we know what their programs are, we know what their strategies are, and let me just assure you, George W. Bush and his daddy, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his daddy, Senator Prescott Bush, they were just minions of Fritz Thiessen, the main guy that bankrolled Hitler for the globalists.
[02:31:49.287 --> 02:31:52.268]  They've always been high-level puppets, that's what they are,
[02:31:53.892 --> 02:32:01.315]  Certainly, for carrying out the operations of the New World Order, as high-level minions, they're going to be making, you know, billions of dollars.
[02:32:02.716 --> 02:32:03.096]  Okay?
[02:32:03.936 --> 02:32:16.461]  And that's all very corrupt and bad, and they have a motive there, with the Halliburton contracts and, you know, Barbara Bush on the board of Lockheed Martin and, you know, George Shultz and Bechtel and on and on and on.
[02:32:17.101 --> 02:32:23.364]  But, no, I assure you, the Rothschilds are above the Bushes, in a whole different strata
[02:32:24.491 --> 02:32:33.077]  You know, politicians, elite politicians present themselves like fruit in a produce market, you know, for the Bilderberg Group to pick over them.
[02:32:33.637 --> 02:32:35.999]  And, you know, to pick which piece of fruit they wish to support.
[02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:46.646]  So, I really don't even get the... I'm trying to understand what you're saying there, Jeff, but, you know, I listen to Jack, we've had Jack on many times.
[02:32:47.006 --> 02:32:52.690]  Jack knows that Bush is just a puppet, so I don't understand you saying that Jack doesn't agree, he thinks it's the Bushes.
[02:32:53.618 --> 02:33:01.461]  Well, I think this is a question, not just the 9-1-1 truth movement, it's kind of like, who did the terrorism movement?
[02:33:01.841 --> 02:33:09.864]  Because I think McGlam, he thinks more that the Middle Easterners don't worry about bringing the wrath of U.S.
[02:33:09.944 --> 02:33:13.145]  against them because they justifiably want to fight back.
[02:33:13.709 --> 02:33:14.770]  Against what the U.S.
[02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:16.511]  military is doing to them first.
[02:33:16.872 --> 02:33:17.832]  Well, wait a minute, Jack!
[02:33:17.872 --> 02:33:18.013]  Jack!
[02:33:18.033 --> 02:33:18.173]  Jack!
[02:33:18.193 --> 02:33:18.273]  Jack!
[02:33:18.313 --> 02:33:18.413]  Jack!
[02:33:18.433 --> 02:33:18.513]  Jack!
[02:33:18.533 --> 02:33:18.653]  Jack!
[02:33:18.673 --> 02:33:18.773]  Jack!
[02:33:18.793 --> 02:33:18.893]  Jack!
[02:33:18.913 --> 02:33:19.113]  Jack!
[02:33:19.133 --> 02:33:19.234]  Jack!
[02:33:19.254 --> 02:33:19.514]  Jack!
[02:33:19.534 --> 02:33:19.714]  Jack!
[02:33:20.094 --> 02:33:20.214]  Jack!
[02:33:20.234 --> 02:33:20.374]  Jack!
[02:33:20.395 --> 02:33:20.495]  Jack!
[02:33:20.515 --> 02:33:20.655]  Jack!
[02:33:20.675 --> 02:33:20.795]  Jack!
[02:33:20.855 --> 02:33:21.095]  Jack!
[02:33:21.135 --> 02:33:21.355]  Jack!
[02:33:21.716 --> 02:33:21.936]  Jack!
[02:33:21.996 --> 02:33:22.156]  Jack!
[02:33:37.586 --> 02:33:39.267]  I mean, I've had Jack on this show.
[02:33:39.327 --> 02:33:41.129]  I've been on his show many times.
[02:33:41.729 --> 02:33:46.973]  I just so happen to be in the car a lot in the late afternoon when he's on the radio.
[02:33:47.674 --> 02:33:50.616]  And so I probably hear about two of his shows a week on average.
[02:33:51.557 --> 02:33:53.378]  So that's just not the case.
[02:33:54.539 --> 02:34:00.924]  So I'm really confused by your phone call, but I'm not going to sit here when you continue to... What is that?
[02:34:00.964 --> 02:34:02.465]  Like three misrepresentations?
[02:34:03.406 --> 02:34:07.089]  And then a claim that Jack says that the Muslims really attacked us?
[02:34:08.812 --> 02:34:09.893]  Jack does not say that.
[02:34:10.813 --> 02:34:12.794]  Jack knows it was a government inside job.
[02:34:12.834 --> 02:34:13.814]  He talks about it all the time.
[02:34:14.475 --> 02:34:16.096]  That was an amazing phone call.
[02:34:16.516 --> 02:34:17.336]  Really amazing.
[02:34:18.477 --> 02:34:19.797]  That's kind of a new tactic.
[02:34:19.837 --> 02:34:20.758]  I haven't heard of that yet.
[02:34:21.298 --> 02:34:25.500]  Claim somebody said something they didn't and then try to use that as a set piece against you.
[02:34:26.481 --> 02:34:28.502]  You know, you always try to blame the government, Alex.
[02:34:29.062 --> 02:34:31.483]  And then it was going into, no, these people are just fighting back.
[02:34:31.523 --> 02:34:32.183]  They deserve to.
[02:34:32.464 --> 02:34:33.704]  Hey, look, I know you don't like me.
[02:34:33.844 --> 02:34:34.445]  I can tell that.
[02:34:34.905 --> 02:34:35.545]  Just don't like me.
[02:34:36.045 --> 02:34:37.286]  But you don't have to invent stuff.
[02:34:37.913 --> 02:34:48.685]  Okay, you know, invention, uh, you know, I know is, uh, is the child of, uh, need, or, well, I just butchered that quote.
[02:34:48.725 --> 02:34:49.426]  What is invention?
[02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:53.510]  It, it, it, invention is born out of necessity.
[02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:54.632]  I think there's a better way to say it.
[02:34:55.172 --> 02:34:59.357]  So you, you have the necessity to disprove something I've said, so you invent something.
[02:35:00.004 --> 02:35:11.877]  A former Vietnam combat and commercial pilot, firm believer, 9-1-1, was inside Job, an experienced Boeing 757, 767 pilot.
[02:35:11.897 --> 02:35:13.859]  He says, in no way could a novice fly the big birds.
[02:35:14.219 --> 02:35:14.760]  He knew so well.
[02:35:20.999 --> 02:35:26.784]  Russ Wittenberg says America has turned into a police state with martial law on the immediate horizon.
[02:35:27.164 --> 02:35:32.548]  He said, America's need to wake up before it's too late and all constitutional rights are stripped away.
[02:35:33.009 --> 02:35:34.390]  Greg Zeminsky wrote this article.
[02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:41.115]  There was no foodling former Air Force commercial pilot Russ Wittenberg the morning of 9-11.
[02:35:41.175 --> 02:35:50.383]  He knew it was an inside job from the get-go, knowing the big boys were up to the same dirty tricks they were playing in the Kennedy assassination and Pearl Harbor.
[02:35:51.457 --> 02:36:08.560]  The government may have fooled millions of Americans with its cockamamie official story, but the former fighter pilot who flew over 100 combat missions in Vietnam and who sat for 35 years in the cockpit for Pan Am and United wasn't one of them.
[02:36:10.316 --> 02:36:29.134]  Now, almost four years later, Wittenberg is still shaking his head in disbelief more than ever, saying the country he loved and fought so bravely 40 years ago has fallen in the dark, in the deep, into the deep, dark, sinister hands of fascist leaders who are quickly turning America into a military state.
[02:36:29.835 --> 02:36:33.799]  Although back in the beginning he seemed like a lone wolf in a hen house,
[02:36:34.582 --> 02:36:41.146]  He's noticed especially in the last six months more Americans waking up to the cold reality that the U.S.
[02:36:41.186 --> 02:36:51.031]  government staged 9-11, started an illegal war in Iraq, and basically is criminally responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of innocent lives here and abroad.
[02:36:51.792 --> 02:36:58.936]  Even though it's a hard pill for some to swallow, Wittenberg says Americans need to wake up and wake up fast.
[02:36:59.904 --> 02:37:07.069]  Holding those in government responsible, even though it may mean a total makeover of the American political system.
[02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:27.323]  And for those despicable actions now taking place in the name of freedom, the former F-100 Vietnam fighter pilot, who knows what it's like to be in harm's way, directed a little military jab towards the Commander-in-Chief saying, oh, why doesn't he wake up and just fall on the sword?
[02:37:30.198 --> 02:37:51.177]  And talking about his obvious disgust for the Bush administration, he bundles 9-11 into the neocon neat little contrived war package saying it was a lynchpin needed to usher in a state of constant fear, a climate of war, and a perfect setting for unconstitutional Patriot Act and eventual martial law.
[02:37:52.310 --> 02:37:53.951]  And it goes on for several other pages.
[02:37:53.971 --> 02:38:00.656]  We're going to be getting Mr. Gutenberg on the show, getting into how they're making preparations for martial law.
[02:38:01.096 --> 02:38:02.737]  A five-year-old could see that!
[02:38:05.399 --> 02:38:09.622]  A five-year-old could see that, but many adults don't want to see it.
[02:38:10.142 --> 02:38:20.690]  They're so afraid that if they admitted what they knew was true in their hearts, the globalists are evil, that they would then have to admit they were living in a country controlled by absolute demons.
[02:38:21.576 --> 02:38:25.020]  Creatures that make vampires look like angels.
[02:38:26.622 --> 02:38:34.490]  Newspaper claims former DOJ officials confirm bombing cover-up from KTOK-TV.
[02:38:34.930 --> 02:38:38.014]  And I'm gonna get Colonel Craig Roberts on to comment on this.
[02:38:38.832 --> 02:38:52.298]  In the next few days, the MacCurtain Daily Gazette today reports several former powerful and high-ranking Justice Department officials confirmed there was a cover-up of the investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:38:55.299 --> 02:39:01.782]  Ten years after the Oklahoma City bombing, a published report says several former high-ranking Department of Justice officials
[02:39:02.751 --> 02:39:08.534]  We want to remain anonymous, claim there was a cover-up of the attack that killed 168 persons.
[02:39:09.395 --> 02:39:15.278]  The story is carried by the McCurtain Daily Gazette in Oklahoma, whose reporter, J.D.
[02:39:15.378 --> 02:39:30.165]  Cash, has spent a decade investigating the bombing and its ties to Ellen Heem City, a religious and white supremacist compound in eastern Oklahoma.
[02:39:32.077 --> 02:39:37.241]  Uh, we... I could spend an hour on this, so I'll stop acting stupid.
[02:39:37.281 --> 02:39:40.064]  It's just... I'm gonna get Colonel Roberts on about it.
[02:39:40.544 --> 02:39:53.895]  We were put into contact with some very, very high-level former Department of Justice officials who have seen about as much of this cover-up of the Oklahoma City bombing as they can stomach, said Cash, in an interview with KTOK News.
[02:39:53.975 --> 02:39:54.155]  Okay.
[02:39:55.692 --> 02:40:01.555]  Basically, we're being told that white supremacists bombed Oklahoma City, and that they were working with these evil Iraqis.
[02:40:01.716 --> 02:40:01.976]  Okay.
[02:40:03.196 --> 02:40:07.879]  Again, in my film Road to Tyranny, we cover this, made three and a half years ago.
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:11.561]  I've covered this endlessly on the radio show.
[02:40:12.662 --> 02:40:19.626]  Regardless of what Cash's motives are, these rabbit trails of Elohim City are just that.
[02:40:21.407 --> 02:40:23.088]  We've had Colonel Roberts on, again,
[02:40:25.416 --> 02:40:32.039]  Army Colonel, Detective, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Investigator, Oklahoma City.
[02:40:32.939 --> 02:40:35.720]  These Iraqis had been trained by the U.S.
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.501]  government, were brought back in by the U.S.
[02:40:37.521 --> 02:40:38.942]  government in the early 90's.
[02:40:39.562 --> 02:40:45.185]  They were involved in the bombing, with McVeigh, no connection to Elohim City.
[02:40:47.285 --> 02:40:53.008]  Because of informants going public and saying that the government was going to let the bombings take place,
[02:40:54.091 --> 02:41:00.495]  They had to drop it like a hot potato and not link McVeigh in with Elohim City.
[02:41:01.856 --> 02:41:02.697]  That was the plan.
[02:41:03.297 --> 02:41:08.740]  The claim that, you know, McVeigh had visited every militia in the country.
[02:41:10.441 --> 02:41:12.263]  He'd been to hundreds of gun shows.
[02:41:12.343 --> 02:41:13.884]  He had created an M.O.
[02:41:14.384 --> 02:41:16.585]  and a ledger, a history with everybody.
[02:41:18.527 --> 02:41:18.947]  Alright?
[02:41:19.487 --> 02:41:20.728]  He was special forces.
[02:41:21.548 --> 02:41:22.349]  This is all admitted.
[02:41:23.576 --> 02:41:26.197]  And then he also was hanging around Elohim City.
[02:41:27.517 --> 02:41:34.299]  And Elohim City was run, and this was come out, by high-level CIA double agents.
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:38.100]  And so the bombing is carried out.
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:47.303]  Though, when the event took place in Elohim City, that is, there's no connection between Elohim City and the bombing itself.
[02:41:47.803 --> 02:41:50.023]  That was Iraqi U.S.
[02:41:50.103 --> 02:41:52.144]  intelligence agents who carried out the bombing.
[02:41:52.794 --> 02:41:58.437]  And again, we've got all the proof of this in the films, and we've got huge sections on the websites on it.
[02:41:58.677 --> 02:42:02.239]  Just exhaustive, exhaustive amounts of evidence.
[02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:21.729]  But, to make a long story short, the government declared national security on those surveillance cameras, the twelve different cameras, because it showed the Iraqis with McVeigh carrying out the diversionary blast with the Ryder truck.
[02:42:23.061 --> 02:42:31.804]  Now ask yourselves, if they've got McVeigh alone bombing this building, and they've admittedly got the surveillance camera of it happening, why don't they show those tapes?
[02:42:31.945 --> 02:42:34.606]  Because, folks, it shows a bunch of Iraqis.
[02:42:36.386 --> 02:42:44.429]  And when state police arrested those Iraqis, and when FBI arrested those Iraqis trying to leave the country, Bill Clinton ordered them released because they're agents.
[02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:47.451]  And it's that simple.
[02:42:49.351 --> 02:42:50.852]  This is on the record.
[02:42:52.702 --> 02:42:54.863]  And I hope people begin to understand this.
[02:42:57.564 --> 02:43:08.290]  And so now to try to go back to the original story and kind of retread it, which we've been hearing over and over again by the neocons on talk radio, Oh, Oklahoma City was Iraq!
[02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:12.872]  Oh, Oklahoma City was tied in and these white supremacists worked with the Iraqis!
[02:43:13.352 --> 02:43:15.153]  The white supremacists were feds!
[02:43:16.313 --> 02:43:19.615]  Literally more feds than toothless followers in Elohim City.
[02:43:21.252 --> 02:43:23.113]  They were feds and so were the Iraqis.
[02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:25.194]  Everybody's a fed in on this thing.
[02:43:28.015 --> 02:43:29.856]  It's like the joke of going to a militia meeting.
[02:43:29.896 --> 02:43:35.378]  I mean, how do you know a... know a FBI agent when you see one?
[02:43:35.418 --> 02:43:37.379]  Well, it'll be... There's five people.
[02:43:37.439 --> 02:43:38.579]  Three of them will be FBI.
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:40.860]  Oh, man.
[02:43:43.041 --> 02:43:44.482]  It makes my head spin sometimes.
[02:43:44.542 --> 02:43:45.182]  It really does.
[02:43:45.322 --> 02:43:47.903]  I mean, to know what they're going to do and to see them doing it and to...
[02:43:48.539 --> 02:43:49.920]  You know, I don't know if J.D.
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:57.123]  Cash is just ignorant or if he's wrong or if he's... I mean, certainly there's a connection to Elohim City.
[02:43:57.603 --> 02:44:06.246]  He's right about that, but people that I really trust, who've just done a great job in the past giving us information, don't like it one bit.
[02:44:06.707 --> 02:44:13.309]  So I'll get Colonel Roberts on in the next two days to give us his take on that.
[02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:16.791]  Okay, let's get into the nuclear threat and that situation.
[02:44:17.626 --> 02:44:19.988]  A nuclear knife aimed at America's heart.
[02:44:20.068 --> 02:44:26.694]  In November 1997, President Clinton signed a top-secret Presidential Decision Directive, PDD-60, directing U.S.
[02:44:26.714 --> 02:44:31.157]  military commanders to abandon the time-honored nuclear deterrence of launch on warning.
[02:44:32.519 --> 02:44:33.079]  Or MAD.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:36.522]  Ironically, this was done in the name of increased deterrence.
[02:44:37.082 --> 02:44:44.629]  Every sensible American needs to understand why this reasoning is fraudulent at best, and deadly at worst.
[02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:47.222]  First, some background.
[02:44:47.242 --> 02:44:53.804]  This is back when Newsmax was good in 1999, before they had to cover up for Bush, and they go into PDD-60.
[02:44:55.124 --> 02:45:07.907]  And I have the Library of Congress declassified synopsis of PDD-60, what is not classified, and it clearly says we will absorb nuclear strikes before deciding what to do.
[02:45:09.347 --> 02:45:12.428]  So if China launches 200 missiles at us, and they've already threatened to destroy 200 U.S.
[02:45:12.688 --> 02:45:12.988]  cities,
[02:45:13.795 --> 02:45:17.297]  And they're coming in that our government will do nothing.
[02:45:17.457 --> 02:45:23.680]  They won't counter the missiles, they will not launch other missiles, which means absolute annihilation.
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:24.561]  We will absorb that.
[02:45:24.961 --> 02:45:31.645]  So with that backdrop, Fox News, CNN, World Net Daily, they're all out fear-mongering.
[02:45:32.725 --> 02:45:35.747]  MS-13 Mexican gangs, they've brought nukes across the border.
[02:45:35.767 --> 02:45:38.508]  We're going to be nuking them in and I'll give up all your rights!
[02:45:38.969 --> 02:45:41.350]  You know, Dick Cheney, better do what we say or you'll get nuked.
[02:45:41.972 --> 02:45:42.072]  Nuke!
[02:45:42.092 --> 02:45:42.272]  Nuke!
[02:45:42.452 --> 02:45:42.732]  Nuke!

[02:45:47.574 --> 02:45:47.694]  Nuke!
[02:45:47.714 --> 02:45:47.794]  Nuke!
[02:45:47.814 --> 02:45:47.914]  Nuke!
[02:45:47.934 --> 02:45:48.034]  Nuke!

[02:45:48.234 --> 02:45:48.574]  Nuke!

[02:45:49.755 --> 02:45:49.955]  Nuke!
[02:45:49.975 --> 02:45:50.055]  Nuke!

[02:45:50.195 --> 02:45:50.295]  Nuke!
[02:45:50.315 --> 02:45:50.395]  Nuke!
[02:45:50.415 --> 02:45:50.535]  Nuke!
[02:45:50.555 --> 02:45:50.775]  Nuke!
[02:45:50.795 --> 02:45:50.895]  Nuke!
[02:45:50.915 --> 02:45:51.175]  Nuke!
[02:45:51.195 --> 02:45:51.396]  Nuke!
[02:45:51.816 --> 02:45:51.936]  Nuke!
[02:45:51.956 --> 02:45:52.076]  Nuke!
[02:45:52.136 --> 02:45:52.296]  Nuke!
[02:45:52.316 --> 02:45:52.436]  Nuke!
[02:45:52.476 --> 02:45:52.656]  Nuke!
[02:45:52.676 --> 02:45:52.916]  Nuke!
[02:45:53.416 --> 02:45:53.556]  Nuke!
[02:45:53.596 --> 02:45:53.836]  Nuke!
[02:45:53.856 --> 02:45:53.976]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.017 --> 02:45:54.137]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.157 --> 02:45:54.237]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.257 --> 02:45:54.337]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:54.577]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.617 --> 02:45:54.717]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.737 --> 02:45:54.857]  Nuke!
[02:45:54.877 --> 02:45:55.037]  Nuke!
[02:45:55.057 --> 02:45:55.197]  Nuke!
[02:45:55.217 --> 02:45:55.297]  Nuke!
[02:45:55.497 --> 02:45:55.737]  Nuke!
[02:45:55.837 --> 02:45:56.157]  Nuke!
[02:45:56.197 --> 02:45:56.377]  Nuke!
[02:45:56.457 --> 02:45:56.577]  Nuke!
[02:45:56.637 --> 02:45:56.838]  Nuke!
[02:45:57.258 --> 02:45:57.378]  Nuke!
[02:45:57.438 --> 02:45:57.618]  Nuke!
[02:45:57.638 --> 02:45:57.758]  Nuke!
[02:45:57.798 --> 02:45:57.998]  Nuke!
[02:45:58.038 --> 02:45:58.278]  Nuke!
[02:45:58.298 --> 02:45:58.398]  Nuke!
[02:45:58.418 --> 02:45:58.698]  Nuke!
[02:45:58.718 --> 02:45:58.798]  Nuke!
[02:46:00.319 --> 02:46:00.459]  Nuke!
[02:46:00.479 --> 02:46:00.679]  Nuke!
[02:46:00.699 --> 02:46:00.879]  Nuke!
[02:46:00.899 --> 02:46:01.059]  Nuke!
[02:46:01.079 --> 02:46:01.199]  Nuke!
[02:46:01.239 --> 02:46:01.479]  Nuke!
[02:46:01.499 --> 02:46:02.440]  Nuke!
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:02.680]  Nuke!
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:02.800]  Nuke!
[02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:02.980]  Nuke!
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:03.160]  Nuke
[02:46:09.775 --> 02:46:16.962]  You know, the Russians didn't just sell these like hotcakes after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:46:17.022 --> 02:46:22.067]  Our government spent $20 million buying those things up from them and having them destroyed.
[02:46:22.567 --> 02:46:25.030]  If anything does happen, it's going to be the globalists.
[02:46:26.371 --> 02:46:33.637]  What Dr. Tanya Kharazhnia, the Russian top economist, called the death cent group, or the skull and bones group, she said that two weeks before 9-11,
[02:46:35.097 --> 02:46:36.118]  They're going to be behind it.
[02:46:36.318 --> 02:46:48.388]  And when that A-bomb goes off, and kills 200,000 people in downtown Chicago, or downtown Dallas, Texas, or downtown New York, Midtown Manhattan, or in Austin, Texas.
[02:46:48.428 --> 02:46:49.589]  I think Austin could be a target.
[02:46:49.609 --> 02:46:51.210]  That's just my gut analysis of it.
[02:46:52.071 --> 02:46:53.732]  The globalists have said it's a major target.
[02:46:54.273 --> 02:46:57.135]  The point is, is that when it goes off in your town,
[02:46:58.371 --> 02:46:59.052]  And your city.
[02:46:59.492 --> 02:47:02.895]  They're going to radically re-engineer this society forever.
[02:47:03.356 --> 02:47:05.498]  You think the police state's been bad up until now?
[02:47:05.518 --> 02:47:22.154]  They're going to have a national draft, capture us as their military slaves, we're going to invade the planet, and the elite are going to just be worshipped, oh, everyone will grovel with their local tattletale, cops to be, you know, on the in crowd, everything will be terrorism, marijuana,
[02:47:22.534 --> 02:47:23.335]  We're speeding.
[02:47:23.735 --> 02:47:26.076]  Every crime will be treated as forced labor camp.
[02:47:26.437 --> 02:47:28.318]  The economy will break down and fall apart.
[02:47:28.698 --> 02:47:30.359]  This is exactly what the globalists want.
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:31.820]  They've been preparing for it.
[02:47:32.141 --> 02:47:36.644]  And if a nuke does go off, or if an A-bomb does go off, which I think it is a very real danger.
[02:47:37.404 --> 02:47:41.327]  I'm not saying it's going to happen like the government does, but it's a very real danger.
[02:47:41.827 --> 02:47:44.609]  And if that happens, folks, giving up your liberty isn't going to keep you safe.
[02:47:45.049 --> 02:47:46.650]  And remember who left the border wide open.
[02:47:48.632 --> 02:47:51.654]  The government's floating this story about nukes coming across the southern border.
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:57.723]  Meanwhile, you know, ordering the Border Patrol to stand down.
[02:47:57.803 --> 02:48:00.405]  You just remember that if this does happen.
[02:48:01.405 --> 02:48:06.229]  You just remember that giving up your freedoms and groveling to somebody in a black mask doesn't keep you safe.
[02:48:06.889 --> 02:48:12.253]  And police, you remember, this very same government puts aspartame in your food, puts sodium fluoride in your water.
[02:48:12.653 --> 02:48:16.916]  This very same government puts mercury vaccines in your children's vaccines.
[02:48:18.542 --> 02:48:21.524]  This very same government sends you to Iraq to breathe DU?
[02:48:22.024 --> 02:48:31.831]  You're serving a bunch of Nazis, a bunch of eugenicists, a bunch of control freaks, a bunch of social Darwinists that think it's their right to rule and dominate you.
[02:48:31.851 --> 02:48:36.054]  And I hope you understand that, and you know what I'm saying is true.
[02:48:36.574 --> 02:48:37.595]  You know it in your soul.
[02:48:37.615 --> 02:48:40.437]  Now get the facts and find out I'm telling you the truth.
[02:48:41.278 --> 02:48:41.678]  Know it!
[02:48:42.318 --> 02:48:43.079]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.661 --> 02:48:49.522]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.762 --> 02:48:51.343]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.683 --> 02:48:56.365]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.705 --> 02:49:01.167]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.547 --> 02:49:05.769]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:06.749]  The Constitution has been
[02:49:06.749 --> 02:49:07.209]  We're good to go.
[02:49:30.836 --> 02:49:32.017]  1-888-253-3139.

[02:50:38.092 --> 02:50:39.573]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:39.613 --> 02:50:40.834]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.129 --> 02:50:47.671]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[02:50:47.731 --> 02:50:51.314]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[02:50:51.434 --> 02:50:51.815]  Shocking?
[02:50:51.915 --> 02:50:52.375]  Of course!
[02:50:52.635 --> 02:50:54.717]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[02:50:54.857 --> 02:50:57.740]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[02:50:57.940 --> 02:50:59.321]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[02:50:59.481 --> 02:51:03.725]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott, Ph.D.
[02:51:03.925 --> 02:51:05.346]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[02:51:05.526 --> 02:51:10.711]  This 150 plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on this subject.
[02:51:11.271 --> 02:51:11.752]  We're good to go.
[02:51:28.035 --> 02:51:32.297]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:32.317 --> 02:51:34.178]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:00.786 --> 02:52:08.673]  So, we've got PDD-60 in force, where we'll absorb nuclear strikes, won't even defend ourselves from attacks.
[02:52:10.614 --> 02:52:13.356]  Our government's armed the Communist Chinese with the latest systems.
[02:52:14.437 --> 02:52:17.039]  Top Chinese generals are threatening to destroy 200 U.S.
[02:52:17.059 --> 02:52:17.420]  cities.
[02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:18.941]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[02:52:18.981 --> 02:52:20.882]  Northern Command is doing drills.
[02:52:21.523 --> 02:52:22.584]  This is off the NORTHCOM
[02:52:23.585 --> 02:52:34.229]  website, this is your military dictatorship, to deal with Al-Qaeda sending a suitcase nuke into North Carolina via a barge.
[02:52:37.010 --> 02:52:42.772]  So, and all they're doing is drilling to take over our cities, drilling to federalize your local police.
[02:52:43.272 --> 02:52:44.652]  That's all any of this is.
[02:52:45.693 --> 02:52:49.514]  Then the globalists will capture America as their engine of empire.
[02:52:49.534 --> 02:52:52.835]  We're the big prize, to then go around invading the planet.
[02:52:54.151 --> 02:52:57.513]  After the nuke of 07, things changed.
[02:53:00.574 --> 02:53:03.856]  And even if the globalists don't nuke a US city, they may not.
[02:53:03.876 --> 02:53:04.516]  I hope they don't.
[02:53:06.037 --> 02:53:08.398]  It's the fear of every night we're going to get nuked.
[02:53:08.438 --> 02:53:09.158]  There's nukes.
[02:53:09.259 --> 02:53:09.919]  There's nukes.
[02:53:12.822 --> 02:53:16.243]  Meanwhile, you have to thumb scan to get into Disney World.
[02:53:16.323 --> 02:53:20.884]  And notice, at first, it was voluntary if you wanted the discount.
[02:53:20.944 --> 02:53:22.445]  Now, it's mandatory.
[02:53:22.485 --> 02:53:23.545]  Same thing to get on planes.
[02:53:23.825 --> 02:53:26.126]  Here's a report from last year before Dan Rather left.
[02:53:26.446 --> 02:53:27.246]  Here's just part of it.
[02:53:27.286 --> 02:53:28.307]  Listen to this propaganda.
[02:53:28.867 --> 02:53:31.608]  Dan Rather reporting tonight from Los Angeles.
[02:53:32.448 --> 02:53:36.229]  Another high-tech innovation with a growing measure of controversy tonight.
[02:53:36.769 --> 02:53:40.951]  Identification systems that scan your hand, eye, or other body parts.
[02:53:41.311 --> 02:53:42.371]  They're great for security.
[02:53:43.044 --> 02:53:44.165]  But what about your privacy?
[02:53:44.726 --> 02:53:46.908]  CBS's Sandra Hughes has been looking into this.
[02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:58.959]  Your hand is your passport at Los Angeles International Airport, where you can bypass long lines at immigration after a machine reads the unique characteristics of your palm and fingers.
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:00.701]  To prove you, are you.
[02:54:00.721 --> 02:54:03.403]  For your protection, you are being photographed.
[02:54:03.424 --> 02:54:07.988]  At banks all over the country, the shape and dimensions of your face are enough ID to cash a check.
[02:54:09.835 --> 02:54:16.661]  And the way you hold an electronic pen equipped with angle and pressure sensors can do more to identify you than your actual signature.
[02:54:17.101 --> 02:54:21.065]  These are all forms of identification technology known as biometrics.
[02:54:21.745 --> 02:54:26.729]  It's a way to distinguish people not by a collection of numbers, but through a collection of body parts.
[02:54:27.210 --> 02:54:32.014]  The flecks and blood vessels in your eye, the structure and webbing of your hand... I'll just say this.
[02:54:32.294 --> 02:54:33.395]  Yeah, that's enough of that.
[02:54:34.736 --> 02:54:35.957]  Yeah, I forgot to mention.
[02:54:36.297 --> 02:54:38.059]  Banks right here in Austin, you go in,
[02:54:39.116 --> 02:54:43.239]  And they'll go, Mr. Jones, we don't need Mr. Johnson.
[02:54:43.779 --> 02:54:45.140]  We don't need to see the ID.
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:46.041]  Good to see you.
[02:54:46.161 --> 02:54:47.161]  Oh, how do you know me?
[02:54:47.201 --> 02:54:47.842]  I've never met you.
[02:54:48.522 --> 02:54:50.344]  I've talked to hundreds of people on the street.
[02:54:50.364 --> 02:54:50.844]  This has happened.
[02:54:50.884 --> 02:54:51.444]  It freaks them out.
[02:54:51.745 --> 02:54:53.045]  Well, the cameras, sir.
[02:54:53.185 --> 02:54:56.668]  Face identification for your security.
[02:54:57.348 --> 02:55:01.771]  But, again, it's the applications of all of this are just horrible.
[02:55:02.392 --> 02:55:05.093]  And guess who is exempt from it when they come across the border?
[02:55:05.894 --> 02:55:07.255]  You've got to do it when you leave the country.
[02:55:08.072 --> 02:55:09.133]  Illegal aliens.
[02:55:09.193 --> 02:55:14.858]  Three years ago, Bush signed an executive order where the illegal aliens, they don't have to do it.
[02:55:15.198 --> 02:55:16.739]  Ha ha!
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:20.222]  Again, it's always selectively enforced.
[02:55:21.143 --> 02:55:28.709]  And then they lie when they take these identifiers and go, oh, it's not, it's not your fingerprint on your face, it's just some numbers.
[02:55:29.390 --> 02:55:30.190]  That's all it is.
[02:55:30.270 --> 02:55:34.294]  Yeah, zeros and ones they put back together for the image of your face or hand.
[02:55:35.931 --> 02:55:39.152]  You know, I didn't plug my videos last hour and I'm not really going to plug them this hour.
[02:55:39.192 --> 02:55:39.913]  I'll just say this.
[02:55:40.713 --> 02:55:43.854]  There's some of the best documentaries out there exposing the New World Order.
[02:55:44.595 --> 02:55:47.576]  They make this broadcast possible and we need your support.
[02:55:48.136 --> 02:55:49.617]  Martial Law is my new film.
[02:55:49.657 --> 02:55:50.517]  It's my best work.
[02:55:50.997 --> 02:55:52.558]  Road to Tyranny is excellent as well.
[02:55:53.298 --> 02:55:56.660]  We've got deals of upwards of 75% off right now on the films.
