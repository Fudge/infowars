[00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:06.219]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.921]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.762]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.244]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:13.506]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.489]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.833]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.132]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:41.172]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:42.312]  It is Tuesday.
[00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.434]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.135]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:54.317]  It's already the first day of March.
[00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:58.779]  We're already into the third month of 2005.
[00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.200]  Life is short.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.042]  I love that corny bumper sticker, so play hard.
[00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:09.890]  We're going to have open phones because I love hearing from all the listeners.
[00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.377]  You bring up so many different issues, so many different topics, so many different news items that I would have never even thought to cover.
[00:01:19.597 --> 00:01:32.728]  And you also have probing questions that, well, tend to give us a finer picture of what the Global Crime Syndicate is up to, what they're doing.
[00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:34.129]  So again, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:42.270]  Coming up in the next segment, I'll start early again like I did yesterday, taking your calls interspersed with all the important news.
[00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.730]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.830]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.191]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:47.052]  FDA okays another brain stimulating implant for the masses.
[00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:06.512]  And it's only a matter of time until it's mandatory, according to the Pentagon.
[00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:09.313]  You think I'm joking?
[00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:10.353]  We'll cover this.
[00:02:11.773 --> 00:02:26.796]  You see, they already forced thousands of people on Ritalin and Prozac-type drugs, the amphetamines and the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and the government's already discussing why if it'll make you feel better, why not have a brain implant?
[00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:29.157]  You won't be complaining after we're done.
[00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:39.798]  And that's what the Army War College talked about in 2000 in a report picked up by the Federation of American Scientists.
[00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:45.259]  Once we all have our chip, we're going to love our global leader.
[00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.339]  And you know I only cover real stuff that's really happening.
[00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.940]  Okay, this is real, my friends.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.881]  Also, global campaign, we talked about some of this Friday,
[00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:02.120]  And now he's been out stumping for it even harder.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.266]  Desmond Tutu, a little communist brat, plans a global campaign to register all children.
[00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:16.710]  Archbishop Desmond Tutu!
[00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.451]  So I have some comments about this.
[00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:27.137]  As usual, the globalists kidnap the children, then they want to take our rights to protect the children, the government ships in the drugs,
[00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.342]  And then they want to bust down our doors looking for the drugs.
[00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:37.686]  The government carries out the terror attacks and then says we're going to take all your freedoms to stop the terrorists.
[00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:39.107]  It's the same thing.
[00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:43.270]  But to keep the children safe, we need a global registration of them.
[00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:48.054]  Ah yes, so the UN can exterminate them in a more orderly fashion.
[00:03:49.767 --> 00:04:13.561]  By the way, speaking of that, China is rewarding one-child families because they drowned babies and murdered people and executed women and tortured people and the life force is too strong, people are just refusing and still having two children in China and so they're just going to try economic incentives, which they've done here in America to destroy the family unit.
[00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:17.744]  In fact, I think I want to cover that first when we get back.
[00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:23.080]  And just talk about Gloria Steinem and the CIA and modern feminism.
[00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:27.283]  Designed to destroy and enslave women.
[00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:28.724]  Oh yes!
[00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:30.446]  Oh, and we have the documents.
[00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:32.627]  All part of enslaving you.
[00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:38.172]  And fits into all of this with Tutu and China and the rest of it.
[00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.135]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:48.803]  I hope that you will stay with us for the duration of this three hour transmission against tyranny.
[00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:54.305]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are two of the websites.
[00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:55.726]  Check them out today!
[00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:05.406]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.587 --> 00:05:10.011]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:14.535]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:15.937]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:17.598]  Animers!
[00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:21.921]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:28.926]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:31.068]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:41.835]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:47.419]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:03.949]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.711]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:11.752]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:18.135]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:26.438]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:32.202]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:36.146]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:38.367]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:40.609]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:45.753]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:06:45.813 --> 00:06:51.698]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.603]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:07:00.544 --> 00:07:01.685]  All water isn't the same.
[00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:06.949]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.811]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:18.517]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:27.363]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a higher vibration state.
[00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:30.966]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:38.652]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:40.933]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.354]  Don't be fooled by imitators.

[00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:50.979]  Big Brother.
[00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:51.719]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:09.708]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:11.189]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.451]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:21.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:32.967]  Welcome back.
[00:08:33.027 --> 00:08:36.330]  Eight minutes, 35 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.589]  You're joining us for the first time.
[00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:40.110]  I'm not left-wing or right-wing.
[00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.674]  I judge politicians and policies and legislation by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:52.617]  Does it give the American people more freedom, more liberty, which then delivers real security?
[00:08:53.438 --> 00:09:01.622]  Or does it give the establishment that is totally reprobate and criminal more power and control over our lives?
[00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:05.965]  And the answer is the Democratic and Republican parties all
[00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:14.097]  Have the same mistresses, play golf together, go on trips together, deal tons of cocaine and heroin together.
[00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:20.223]  Run big, bid-rigging scams and corporate looting together.
[00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:29.406]  They're a society of organized criminals, of carnival hucksters, scamming us, playing good cop, bad cop, and I am sick and tired of it.
[00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.046]  And I'm not going along with it.
[00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:35.868]  And I'm going to defend this republic until my last gasping breath.
[00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:39.489]  My last rasping breath.
[00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.390]  I am never going to stop.
[00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.791]  I am far beyond driven.
[00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:53.547]  I am possessed with the desire for liberty and truth and justice and things that are beautiful and decent and creative.
[00:09:54.368 --> 00:10:03.315]  I will stand against the forces of death and the new world order forever, if that is God's will, and that is certainly my wish that that be God's will, and I know that is God's will.
[00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:06.297]  Where there is liberty, there the Spirit of the Lord dwelleth.
[00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:09.940]  Where the Spirit of the Lord dwelleth, there is liberty.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.162]  There, I think that's the proper Bible verse, and I love it.
[00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:16.853]  There's like 50 verses in the Bible that say that.
[00:10:19.434 --> 00:10:20.115]  And it's true!
[00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:22.276]  It's just common sense, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:28.239]  Give up your liberty and we'll give you security, they say through their muffled ski mask.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.420]  Uh, no thank you.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.061]  No thank you.
[00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:37.305]  You leave our borders wide open while telling us to give up all our freedoms or the terrorists will guess, Al-Qaeda!
[00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:42.508]  Bin Laden is telling al-Zawahiri to attack us any minute!
[00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:46.918]  And the other poll says it's a real threat bio-attack any minute.
[00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:51.141]  If we don't give up all our rights, they're gonna get us any minute!
[00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:52.762]  But wait!
[00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:58.407]  Buzzy Krongaard with the insider CIA trading on United American, number three at the CIA!
[00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:01.529]  He told Associated Press, Times of London!
[00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:03.129]  A month ago?
[00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:04.670]  Don't worry about Bin Laden.
[00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.790]  We don't want to capture him.
[00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.551]  And it's come out and it's admitted there's a deal.
[00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:13.992]  They've even paid Pakistan off in the first months after the war to not arrest Bin Laden if you even think he was still alive.
[00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.013]  My intel is he died of kidney failure.
[00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:16.833]  They got him on ice.
[00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:21.495]  But we preemptively talked about it so much that they didn't roll him out before the election.
[00:11:21.795 --> 00:11:24.576]  But he did pop up before the election and say, I'm gonna get you.
[00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:25.736]  Vote for John Kerry.
[00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.732]  And then Karl Rove told the New York Daily News, thank you Bin Laden for the Christmas present.
[00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:33.634]  That was... It's just common sense.
[00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:34.654]  Who stands to gain?
[00:11:34.674 --> 00:11:40.437]  If Bin Laden really hated Bush, he's not stupid, he wouldn't say, vote for John Kerry.
[00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.659]  It's all staged.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.301]  But they're not worried about capturing Bush.
[00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:49.502]  You said he's not worried about him.
[00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.362]  He's not looking for him.
[00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:51.983]  He doesn't care anymore.
[00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:53.324]  You all saw that on television.
[00:11:53.884 --> 00:11:55.625]  Number three guy says they don't want to capture him.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.541]  But now he's going to hit us!
[00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:02.201]  He's going to hit us though!
[00:12:02.241 --> 00:12:04.563]  He's going to hit us and we've got to take your freedoms!
[00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:12.487]  I wanted to briefly talk about feminism before we go to Lee, Norm, Phil, Jason, Tony and others.
[00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:22.152]  Because in the first little launch segment, a lot of stations don't carry it, but I start off right at the start of the hour, a little five minute segment.
[00:12:23.593 --> 00:12:25.314]  I got into Desmond Tutu
[00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:54.006]  uh... the archbishop uh... known communist down there in uh... south africa which is hell hole the earth and uh... this guy when he's not out supporting the murdering death squads down there that stalk and loot the country he came out and said that we need to have a global registration of all the children well the united nations four years ago at a population summit in australia called for a world id card
[00:12:55.603 --> 00:13:08.850]  Two months ago, The Outgoing Ridge was in London, England, addressing their Parliament, and he sent me a global ID card, world standardized biometric ID card, and that's what this is about.
[00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:21.617]  I've got an article here out of the Chicago Tribune today going, going, oh, people see cameras on the street corners as big brother, but cameras are good and they keep us safe from the drug dealers.
[00:13:23.723 --> 00:13:30.228]  What they don't tell you is, the government ships the drugs in to begin with, and the bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have on our streets.
[00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:31.529]  That's an admitted fact!
[00:13:33.031 --> 00:13:35.573]  Triple the heroin, double the cocaine in the last ten years.
[00:13:36.694 --> 00:13:39.236]  One million in prison, up to seven plus million in prison.
[00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:40.637]  I mean, that's quite a growth level.
[00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:43.619]  And you're going, what does this have to do with feminism?
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.442]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:13:47.322 --> 00:13:48.343]  It's just at every level.
[00:13:48.363 --> 00:13:51.826]  Just like with the drugs, or education, or any of it.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:14:07.146]  The psychiatric system takes over, and we have more mentally ill people, more people on drugs, more funding, federalization of schooling, the test scores plummet, they put more money into it because they're actually getting what they paid for.
[00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.146]  Dumbing you down.
[00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:10.067]  We have the federal documents on that.
[00:14:11.368 --> 00:14:15.730]  And it's the same thing with the millions of trafficked children and women a year.
[00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.953]  We need global ID card and a way to mark these children so
[00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.011]  We always know who they are.
[00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:32.817]  And then you look at the country that does nothing about... They think in South Africa that if you rape a child, you get rid of AIDS.
[00:14:33.317 --> 00:14:34.959]  You get rid of your HIV.
[00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:41.423]  And so, child rape, I mean of babies, is in the tens of thousands per year.
[00:14:41.823 --> 00:14:44.305]  They have the highest murder rate in the world now.
[00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:46.386]  Nothing's done about that.
[00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:50.269]  South Africa traffics masses of children out of the country.
[00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:53.015]  In the Balkans, major U.S.
[00:14:53.055 --> 00:14:55.957]  companies have been caught, like Dyncor and others.
[00:14:55.977 --> 00:15:00.059]  200,000 women and children kidnapped in 2000 alone and shipped out around the world.
[00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:04.622]  A million-two women are kidnapped out of Central Europe a year.
[00:15:04.922 --> 00:15:06.443]  Folks, we're talking about millions!
[00:15:06.843 --> 00:15:08.264]  This is unbelievable!
[00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:13.567]  We're talking about numbers of slaves bigger than it ever was with black slaves out of Africa!
[00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:16.629]  But you're not going to hear Jesse Jackson talk about that!
[00:15:18.837 --> 00:15:29.340]  Louis Farrakhan isn't going to stand up for all these white women getting kidnapped, and being taken to Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia, and a dozen other countries.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.380]  By the way, you think I'm joking?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.921]  Just type in, uh, white slavery Israel, you'll get Harots, Jerusalem Post.
[00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:40.082]  And the reason I mention those is it's Israeli newspapers.
[00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:46.404]  That's one of the top traffickers, uh, right there with them is Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:49.537]  Where George Bush Sr.
[00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:51.458]  likes to vacation about a month out of the year.
[00:15:52.859 --> 00:16:03.688]  My point is, all this is going on, and the very establishment behind all this is telling us global ID for the children, a global registration of the children, so we'll get into that.
[00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:05.069]  And you go, what does that have to do with feminism?
[00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.711]  Well, that leads me into this article.
[00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:11.954]  China rewards one-child families.
[00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:13.515]  United Press International.
[00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:20.492]  China is experimenting with increased cash rewards for single-child families.
[00:16:20.872 --> 00:16:34.083]  The official China Daily reported yesterday, the paper reported the results of a pilot program launched last April in 15 Chinese cities that gave cash rewards to rural couples who were willing to have only one boy or two daughters.
[00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:45.137]  According to the new policy, each of the couples could get at least 600 yen or $72 every year when they are over 60 years old.
[00:16:45.157 --> 00:16:50.599]  The policy provides reassurance to couples in rural areas who worry about their old age.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:17:00.703]  The paper said in 2004, 4,781 farmers in Chindal benefited from the program receiving rewards of 2.87 million yen or $350,000, it said.
[00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:11.262]  And they say with the new success of the program, they're going to expand it into other cities and towns.
[00:17:11.382 --> 00:17:11.622]  Okay.
[00:17:13.443 --> 00:17:15.123]  China is the model.
[00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:22.727]  Not only does China reward its families for doing this, for engaging in basically cultural suicide,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.780]  But the U.N.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.182]  and America and the social architects and engineers reward them.
[00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:30.443]  They get all the rewards.
[00:17:30.503 --> 00:17:31.863]  They get all the U.N.
[00:17:32.544 --> 00:17:40.107]  medals and funding for grabbing babies and grounding them and murdering people and torturing women who have more than one child.
[00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:47.150]  And now you've got like, what, 35 million more men in China than you have women?
[00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.451]  When in the natural order you have 49%
[00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.012]  Men and 51% women.
[00:17:57.093 --> 00:17:58.093]  That's not the exact numbers.
[00:17:58.133 --> 00:18:05.058]  It's like 49.8% men and 50% something women.
[00:18:05.078 --> 00:18:05.318]  Yes.
[00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:13.204]  Mammals, it's across the mammalian spectrum, there are always more females than men.
[00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:14.325]  That's just a fact, by the way.
[00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:17.363]  God engineered it that way.
[00:18:18.103 --> 00:18:23.564]  The creatures that create more of the creatures, or vigor of the species, you're going to have more of those.
[00:18:24.925 --> 00:18:25.505]  Ah, women.
[00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:27.766]  What incredible, magical creatures.
[00:18:28.606 --> 00:18:31.707]  But the globalists hate life.
[00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:32.647]  They want to destroy it.
[00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:38.119]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:39.940]  Women actually really run things.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.821]  Women are the center of the home.
[00:18:42.282 --> 00:18:46.064]  Women are the fulcrum around which all life rotates and orbits.
[00:18:47.145 --> 00:18:52.428]  And so fascistas and commies and all of them, on plantations.
[00:18:52.568 --> 00:18:55.450]  The men were kept in one area, weren't allowed to read and write.
[00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:59.493]  The women were brought in and made the overseers of the slaves.
[00:19:01.371 --> 00:19:02.952]  And it's the same thing today with feminism.
[00:19:02.992 --> 00:19:10.698]  Gloria Steinem, and I own the book, and one of her books, I don't remember the name of that, it's been years since I read it on air, but actually, a listener sent me the book.
[00:19:11.898 --> 00:19:14.940]  One thing I heard Limbaugh actually tell the truth about about ten years ago was this.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.922]  He mentioned this, and it's true.
[00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:17.862]  I mean, I own the book.
[00:19:19.123 --> 00:19:21.805]  It was incredible.
[00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:27.209]  She says, yes, I was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to start Miss Magazine.
[00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.668]  And they started it and challenged women.
[00:19:30.008 --> 00:19:32.969]  Don't you be enslaved by that man.
[00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:34.050]  You get out there and work.
[00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:43.854]  And of course, all the time, the government, the documents now show, wanted to break up the families so the state could raise the children and make both parents work and get more taxes.
[00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:46.415]  And so they did this.
[00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:51.417]  And I'll finish up with this story, then we'll go to Lee, Norm, Phil, Jason, Tony, and others.
[00:19:52.697 --> 00:19:55.158]  And just like Hitler targeted the women, so did the globalists.
[00:19:55.238 --> 00:19:56.299]  And they've done a great job.
[00:19:57.228 --> 00:19:58.569]  We are in total shambles.
[00:19:58.609 --> 00:19:59.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.812]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:07.914]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:20:08.214 --> 00:20:09.034]  Read the labels.
[00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:13.617]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:20:13.817 --> 00:20:18.019]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:23.262]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:27.224]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:20:27.404 --> 00:20:32.747]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:20:33.027 --> 00:20:35.768]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:36.949]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:37.249 --> 00:20:42.992]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:21:00.757 --> 00:21:01.177]  Gold.
[00:21:01.537 --> 00:21:02.838]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:09.159]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:13.180]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.421]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:17.761]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:23.643]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:21:23.743 --> 00:21:24.143]  We're good to go.
[00:21:42.788 --> 00:21:43.148]  We're good.
[00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.930]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.171]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:09.192]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:09.272 --> 00:22:15.994]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:16.174 --> 00:22:19.194]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:19.374 --> 00:22:21.775]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:21.895 --> 00:22:29.797]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:32.099]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:32.999]  MTBE.
[00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:33.540]  Radon 222.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.122]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:22:36.282 --> 00:22:41.386]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:22:41.546 --> 00:22:49.292]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.312 --> 00:22:49.772]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.812 --> 00:22:51.474]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:07.656]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:23:08.037 --> 00:23:09.278]  It suppresses your immune system!
[00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:10.179]  Now, check this out.
[00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:13.963]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:23:14.283 --> 00:23:14.843]  That's about 120 pounds!
[00:23:15.464 --> 00:23:15.945]  We're good to go.
[00:23:34.628 --> 00:23:38.751]  For a limited time only, get a Garricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.

[00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:06.959]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.183]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls here in a second, but this is important.
[00:24:12.804 --> 00:24:15.146]  Don't be emotional out there, women that are listening.
[00:24:16.568 --> 00:24:16.908]  Okay?
[00:24:16.928 --> 00:24:20.010]  You know, the government pushes this woman named Gloria Steinem.
[00:24:20.311 --> 00:24:22.012]  She's all over all the TV shows.
[00:24:22.092 --> 00:24:24.995]  She tells you, your men have enslaved you.
[00:24:25.595 --> 00:24:27.317]  They're keeping you as their slaves.
[00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:29.385]  Get out there.
[00:24:29.525 --> 00:24:30.466]  Don't have children.
[00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:31.426]  Don't have a family.
[00:24:32.828 --> 00:24:33.888]  You don't need a man.
[00:24:33.908 --> 00:24:36.070]  Of course, she's gone off and gotten a family and a man.
[00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:39.113]  You go out and be your own person.
[00:24:39.913 --> 00:24:41.154]  Men are against you.
[00:24:41.715 --> 00:24:42.916]  They're controlling you.
[00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.298]  And now, look at our society.
[00:24:46.835 --> 00:25:00.206]  You go to the hospital, you talk to these fertility doctors, they have just got masses of women, all these 40-year-old, 45-year-old women, who are just crying, I've gotta have a child, I want it!
[00:25:00.807 --> 00:25:02.428]  Well yeah, you're designed to do that.
[00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:04.890]  You're totally engineered.
[00:25:05.311 --> 00:25:06.231]  We're all engineered.
[00:25:06.652 --> 00:25:08.994]  And we're part of the same species.
[00:25:09.294 --> 00:25:10.054]  We're a union.
[00:25:10.094 --> 00:25:12.917]  Men and women, we're the same creatures, folks.
[00:25:13.644 --> 00:25:16.626]  In fact, the human species is male and female.
[00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:17.767]  We are a union.
[00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:19.368]  We are one creature.
[00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:21.189]  Do you understand that?
[00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:22.750]  You understand that?
[00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.872]  There is no separation, and they've tried to separate that.
[00:25:26.912 --> 00:25:28.333]  We both have our roles.
[00:25:29.714 --> 00:25:43.302]  But the government, and again, I mean, I have this Department of Education documents, Department of Health and Human Service documents, I've got Ram Corporation documents, we've got Carnegie documents, I mean, this stuff, some of this stuff is 80 years old.
[00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:45.933]  It's the exact same stuff Hitler did.
[00:25:46.594 --> 00:25:51.497]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:53.618]  80% of advertising targets women.
[00:25:54.899 --> 00:26:00.062]  Because they know women make most of the decisions on purchases, do most of the buying.
[00:26:00.102 --> 00:26:01.063]  I know my wife does.
[00:26:02.484 --> 00:26:04.805]  And you're targeted.
[00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:12.650]  And they target you and go, oh you're so smart, oh you're so good, oh your family's keeping you down, or don't have a family.
[00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:22.233]  And then instead you're in corporate America and you get to go play golf now if you want to or whatever and you're totally unhappy.
[00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:26.955]  And I'm not against a woman working or being an executive or whatever she wants to be.
[00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:29.396]  The point is, do what you want to do.
[00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:39.880]  And realize now that it's almost too late to get out of this system because they destroyed the economy so bad that both
[00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:43.912]  Mother and father have to work, sometimes both of them, two jobs.
[00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:46.654]  And that was the real goal all along.
[00:26:48.054 --> 00:26:52.657]  Was to... And now they're talking about extending school up to 7, 8 o'clock at night.
[00:26:52.957 --> 00:26:54.617]  Because we know how busy you are, parents.
[00:26:54.697 --> 00:27:00.620]  And now Dr. Phil says that being a parent's a privilege and a state is really the parent over the children.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.041]  I mean, they're actually saying this!
[00:27:03.341 --> 00:27:04.322]  That was the goal.
[00:27:05.794 --> 00:27:12.900]  Get you away from your children, if you do have children, or encourage you not to have children, so the state can raise them.
[00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:21.866]  And now you look at these yuppies, and you look at these hippies grown up, they don't take care of their parents on average, they just warehouse them in these nursing homes.
[00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:23.388]  They're all for euthanasia.
[00:27:23.848 --> 00:27:25.309]  It's totally self-centered.
[00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.792]  And they've destroyed the fabric of society.
[00:27:29.172 --> 00:27:31.094]  We've gone from what, about 15% illegitimacy 50 years ago?
[00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:56.984]  to in some communities eighty percent uh... but illegitimacy total in the country's what like forty five percent now uh... seventy to eighty percent depending on what state you're in uh... of of of marriages in in in divorce this is all designed the engineered rebellion into the family dynamic i mean the past folks
[00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:03.441]  Families, most families, healthy families on a farm, or a ranch, or in a city, they were tribal.
[00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:21.395]  It was all about the family, and the husband and the wife stuck up for each other, and they were on a team, and their neighborhood was on a team, and you had this sense of tribe, and everybody was together, and it was strong, and people didn't trust the government, and people stuck up for each other.
[00:28:23.196 --> 00:28:25.398]  Now you look at these families, they don't stick up for each other.
[00:28:27.248 --> 00:28:29.669]  When you see a family that does, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:32.689]  I mean, there's nothing thicker than blood, folks.
[00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:34.890]  There's nothing more important than blood.
[00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.470]  Blood is everything.
[00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:54.934]  And if you don't understand that blood is where it's at, that blood is a beautiful thing, that your family, your flesh, flesh of your flesh, is the center of everything, in God's plan, then you're blind.
[00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.393]  The fancy Lexus cars and the big houses, these people are totally unhappy.
[00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:05.356]  I'm not saying those things are bad, but they're way down the hierarchy of needs.
[00:29:05.776 --> 00:29:10.599]  First comes family and friendship, and a mission in life.
[00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:14.741]  And these people are totally unhappy, so they want more, more, more, more, more.
[00:29:15.122 --> 00:29:15.622]  These women!
[00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:27.034]  In Italy, and France, and Japan, they're not having babies, they're not getting married, and they're totally happy and full of themselves, until they hit about 35, and then they disintegrate.
[00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:29.756]  They disintegrate.
[00:29:30.656 --> 00:29:32.398]  They disintegrate.
[00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.000]  And this has been the plan!
[00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:38.263]  This has been the plan all along.
[00:29:38.303 --> 00:29:40.665]  My God, women, don't be fooled by this.
[00:29:41.205 --> 00:29:42.326]  And there's another side to that.
[00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:44.712]  The government's destroyed the men as well.
[00:29:44.772 --> 00:29:45.713]  The men are even worse!
[00:29:46.274 --> 00:29:48.397]  Well, come back, take your calls, and I'll talk about men.

[00:32:49.798 --> 00:32:49.998]  Call today.
[00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:29.461]  Alright, just in closing, what the government scientifically, I mean they have handbooks on this, has done to the men, is in the past a man worked hard, treated his wife and children good, had a coat of honor, passed on the morals and the skills that he was taught by his fathers,
[00:33:31.227 --> 00:33:39.669]  And today, a man struts around and talks about football and acts tough and watches NASCAR.
[00:33:40.609 --> 00:33:55.232]  And sits in front of the television and teaches his son how to watch football games and maybe, if they're really manly, puts a George Bush bumper sticker on their car and goes deer hunting once a year.
[00:33:57.012 --> 00:33:58.433]  That's what real men do today.
[00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:27.471]  I'm telling you, looking at the younger people, a lot of them are really hard working and smart and great, but the majority, pale, sickly, video game playing, dope smoking, little weaklings, who go around acting like they're in 8th grade, giggling and gibbering.
[00:34:30.729 --> 00:34:31.750]  Acting like monkeys.
[00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:37.653]  And the sitcoms and the dramas, watch them.
[00:34:37.753 --> 00:34:44.477]  I mean, back when I used to watch a lot of TV and I still read the synopsis of it and occasionally tune in anytime I see it, it's what I witness.
[00:34:44.877 --> 00:34:47.779]  The male is always ridiculed by his children and his wife.
[00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.520]  He's an idiot.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.820]  He's a screw-up.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.921]  He's dishonest.
[00:34:52.262 --> 00:34:54.243]  It's kind of like the old painted-faced
[00:34:55.364 --> 00:35:00.348]  You know, 1930s movies where it always shows the black male as stupid and an idiot.
[00:35:00.388 --> 00:35:01.629]  The woman keeps him in line.
[00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.232]  That was the same policies they had on the plantations.
[00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:19.504]  There were Roman handbooks written 2,000 years ago when they would grab a bunch of German slaves or goth slaves, Gaul slaves, and there were handbooks on it, you know, when they'd bring the slaves in.
[00:35:20.433 --> 00:35:28.196]  If they didn't just kill all the males outright down to age 12, they would have had certain ways of breaking them.
[00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.397]  I really ought to talk about this and explain this to people.
[00:35:30.657 --> 00:35:48.403]  It's the same systems that empires and elites learned thousands of years ago is more sophisticated, but what they do is you watch a sitcom or you watch any of these shows, whether it's the Simpsons or
[00:35:49.797 --> 00:36:02.501]  Malcolm in the Middle, or any of this, or, you know, moving on up, any of these shows, the male is bad, the woman is good, the male is somebody who screws around and is an idiot.
[00:36:07.883 --> 00:36:08.663]  It's just incredible.
[00:36:09.304 --> 00:36:13.065]  And you watch this, and this is the role model.
[00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:22.838]  You know, all these beach party movies and stuff that we see on a cyclical basis where the guy that gets all the girls is the person who can hardly talk.
[00:36:23.484 --> 00:36:26.665]  Who acts like a fool, who gets in trouble with the police.
[00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:33.748]  And that may work with 16, 17 year old girls who watch that and think that's what a man's supposed to act like.
[00:36:34.248 --> 00:36:37.610]  But by the time women get to be about 20, that's not what they're really looking for.
[00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:49.034]  But then all the young men, those are social creatures, have watched what so-called leader males do on the movies and on television and they think that's how you get the girls is acting like a fool.
[00:36:49.534 --> 00:36:51.135]  And so the women see that and
[00:36:53.334 --> 00:36:54.255]  They're not interested in it.
[00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:59.461]  And so, it's just scientific to watch.
[00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:00.842]  It is scientific.
[00:37:02.945 --> 00:37:12.155]  In the 1700s, a sugar cane plantation owner took some of the Roman text
[00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:24.448]  And put them back into a newer booklet or manuscript and it was widely sold in several languages, French, Spanish, Portuguese, English.
[00:37:24.468 --> 00:37:31.413]  It was very popular in the South and it would explain how, and in the North at the time, bringing in the slaves,
[00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:45.633]  Into the 1800s, how to bring in the slaves, the coffin ships, the black slaves, and you also had white slaves being brought in, but they were only slaves for seven years, but then they never really got off the farm.
[00:37:45.653 --> 00:37:48.834]  It was called sharecropping later, but that's a whole other subject.
[00:37:48.854 --> 00:37:57.576]  This is so important, though, from the sociological view to understand where we are today and the sciences of control.
[00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:02.582]  And on average, about half the blacks would die coming in on the coffin ships.
[00:38:04.043 --> 00:38:26.270]  And they would land at these slave ports, and they'd bring them in to an area, normally outdoors, they would chain them down, and then they would pick the biggest, strongest, most intelligent, obvious leader of the blacks out, the person, you know, who had the most cunning intelligence in his eyes, and beat the living daylights out of him, sometimes kill him,
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.542]  Right in front of all the black women.
[00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:39.247]  And they would, you know, have an interpreter there who would explain the infractions that this person engaged in.
[00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:46.392]  Then they would start grabbing some of the black male children who were supposedly being bad and beat them with an inch of their life.
[00:38:46.412 --> 00:38:49.474]  And then they tell the women, you've got to keep the men in line.
[00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:57.878]  Or, we're going to have to beat or kill or hang more of your men.
[00:38:58.038 --> 00:39:02.021]  And so the women, they would then take them at that point and make them the wardens.
[00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:07.524]  And the women, believing they were protecting their males, would, quote, try to dominate them.
[00:39:08.765 --> 00:39:16.030]  And then you end up with the image of the house slave, you know, the woman, you know, dressed nicely, running around, doing the bidding,
[00:39:19.249 --> 00:39:31.617]  We've all seen those 1930s films, and people went to the 50s, going, you know, in that accent, chastising the black male who stoops down, you know, doesn't even walk erect.
[00:39:31.657 --> 00:39:35.780]  He's been taught to bend over and beg to her, and she's got the rolling pin.
[00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:41.524]  And let me tell you something, New World Order, that's wrong what you did to the black men of this country.
[00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.243]  And it's wrong what you've done to all of our men, period, now today.
[00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:53.246]  And the Gloria Steinem's and the rest of them with their CIA rolling pins can go right back to the hell holes where they came from.
[00:39:54.267 --> 00:40:04.152]  Gloria Steinem admits she was a CIA officer carrying out a Carnegie Foundation operation to break down the family.
[00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:05.672]  Now in her book she doesn't say that.
[00:40:05.712 --> 00:40:08.634]  She says, oh yes, the CIA was for the goals of feminism.
[00:40:09.628 --> 00:40:12.429]  So they funded Miss Magazine and I was an officer.
[00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.010]  And look what you've done.
[00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:22.012]  Look what you've turned us all, basically our young people, about 60-70% of them, into slaves.
[00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:23.673]  And the men are these
[00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:36.495]  Are these dumbed down, uh, gibbering fools, and the women are these, uh, are these unhappy, uh, little queens trying to keep us all in line.
[00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:41.077]  The women are so upset, they're not fulfilled, they're not happy, so it makes them hate men even more!
[00:40:41.697 --> 00:40:44.158]  Look, women, you're not going to be happy until you've got a real man!
[00:40:44.398 --> 00:40:45.758]  You want a real man!
[00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:47.158]  That's what you need!
[00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:49.919]  And you want somebody who's strong!
[00:40:50.339 --> 00:40:52.320]  And you want somebody to be the captain of the ship!
[00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:53.401]  Okay?
[00:40:53.541 --> 00:40:59.805]  And if you've got a good relationship, that man will serve you at the very time that he's strong and you serve him.
[00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:13.132]  So if you want to be happy, just puke up the poison you've been fed, sober up, dry out, stop trying to dominate men, and men, you need to start being men.
[00:41:13.152 --> 00:41:14.813]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:41:14.853 --> 00:41:15.894]  I promise I'll go to your calls.
[00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:16.874]  I'm out of control today.
[00:41:17.935 --> 00:41:19.055]  Lee in Mississippi.
[00:41:19.095 --> 00:41:19.976]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:41:20.692 --> 00:41:22.093]  Man, you're batting a thousand today.
[00:41:22.493 --> 00:41:22.873]  Well, thank you.
[00:41:22.893 --> 00:41:23.433]  How are you doing?
[00:41:23.933 --> 00:41:24.354]  Pretty good.
[00:41:24.374 --> 00:41:25.554]  I have a quick question.
[00:41:25.834 --> 00:41:32.377]  I want you to clarify media law when it comes to articles or documents.
[00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:37.019]  I understand that government documents, I mean, you can't get any more clear than that.
[00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:42.681]  But media law is kind of vague when it comes to journalistic integrity.
[00:41:43.181 --> 00:41:47.223]  And at what point do you draw the line, you know, as far as true, false,
[00:41:47.791 --> 00:41:48.191]  Agenda?
[00:41:48.612 --> 00:41:49.072]  Hidden agenda?
[00:41:49.092 --> 00:41:49.913]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:41:49.933 --> 00:42:00.219]  That is a very important and wide-reaching, overarching question, but... Let me boil it down like this.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.002]  Alex, you say the mainstream media lies, but you use their news.
[00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:06.444]  So, I mean, is that what you're saying?
[00:42:07.184 --> 00:42:08.665]  Well, yes and no.
[00:42:08.745 --> 00:42:11.627]  I mean, I believe it because I understand the big picture.
[00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:14.949]  I see how it all plugs in and how it's all pieces of the puzzle.
[00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:17.451]  However, when you're talking to someone who's
[00:42:18.126 --> 00:42:20.108]  I guess, who's plugged in, if you will.
[00:42:20.988 --> 00:42:23.830]  They just have a hard time grasping this whole thing.
[00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.371]  Show them articles.
[00:42:25.632 --> 00:42:29.755]  They selectively don't believe media if they don't like what it's saying.
[00:42:30.195 --> 00:42:30.575]  Exactly.
[00:42:31.976 --> 00:42:32.757]  Let me explain this.
[00:42:34.839 --> 00:42:38.922]  You've got thousands of government agents in TV, radio, and mainly print.
[00:42:39.822 --> 00:42:41.483]  Because print feeds TV and radio.
[00:42:42.844 --> 00:42:47.268]  And what they do is they mix disinfo with real news
[00:42:48.695 --> 00:42:55.660]  And so you've got to learn to recognize those classes of news in the big context by reading hundreds of different newspapers around the world.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:03.566]  And then having the base context of the actual Pentagon reports and actual Department of Education reports and actual legislation.
[00:43:03.846 --> 00:43:05.207]  By knowing the legislation,
[00:43:05.808 --> 00:43:10.571]  By reading the Think Tank documents, you then know the big picture.
[00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:12.552]  You then know what the actual program is.
[00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:24.578]  Then you're able to look at news, look at individuals, see what quarter it comes from, see what basic spin and talking point arrangement it has, and then I put it into about four different groups.
[00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:29.041]  You have pure propaganda, Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence.
[00:43:30.054 --> 00:43:31.054]  You have articles like that.
[00:43:31.394 --> 00:43:36.376]  Articles, you know, that you see come out from the Neocon publications saying Saddam does have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:43:36.996 --> 00:43:38.096]  Okay, we know that's a lie.
[00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:42.357]  Then you have other news like, we're putting up face scanning cameras in your town.
[00:43:42.457 --> 00:43:43.257]  It's good for you.
[00:43:43.357 --> 00:43:44.497]  Well, that's a real article.
[00:43:44.778 --> 00:43:46.418]  You know, the cameras are going in.
[00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:47.438]  They are face scanning.
[00:43:47.678 --> 00:43:48.778]  They're saying it's good.
[00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:50.139]  That's the spin.
[00:43:50.439 --> 00:43:55.800]  We come in with a counter-spin and say, no, these are the reasons that these cameras aren't good.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.961]  Okay, so you have outright lying.
[00:43:59.702 --> 00:44:02.803]  You then have SPIN and all its manifestations.
[00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:06.564]  You then have good reporting that just reports the facts.
[00:44:07.104 --> 00:44:15.367]  And those are the thousands of AP and Reuters articles and AFP articles that go on the news wires every day that never make it past the CIA editors.
[00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:18.088]  Most of your major editors are CIA officers, that's admitted.
[00:44:19.288 --> 00:44:20.108]  Major town papers.
[00:44:20.169 --> 00:44:21.529]  Never make it past them.
[00:44:22.546 --> 00:44:22.786]  Uh-huh.
[00:44:22.806 --> 00:44:22.926]  Okay.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.504]  Alright, well I'll ask this and then I'll be done.
[00:44:56.845 --> 00:45:05.355]  How does that play in when, say, someone talks about Bush's family connections with Nazi funding?
[00:45:06.196 --> 00:45:10.120]  Well, I have copies of the Library of Congress documents.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:10.881]  It's admitted.
[00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:18.219]  And, uh, then you see Karl Rover, uh, the grandfather of Karl Rove, Nazi, uh, regional governor.
[00:45:18.779 --> 00:45:20.260]  You see him supporting Arnold.
[00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:23.723]  You see him calling at the homeland, putting the police in black uniforms.
[00:45:24.564 --> 00:45:25.905]  Uh, you see the same M.O.
[00:45:25.945 --> 00:45:27.186]  I mean, it's real, it's true.
[00:45:27.206 --> 00:45:28.107]  Oh, totally.
[00:45:28.127 --> 00:45:28.868]  I mean, I believe it.
[00:45:29.148 --> 00:45:38.356]  But my point is, like, how do, say someone on the other side wants to sue them and say their sources, not maybe on that subject, for instance, but maybe a different subject.
[00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:43.612]  That their sources are, I don't know, deep inside and they don't want to reveal their sources.
[00:45:43.632 --> 00:45:46.133]  How does that come into lawsuits?
[00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:47.494]  Can't reveal sources?
[00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:52.617]  Well, again, it's not sources that can't be revealed on the Nazi stuff.
[00:45:55.339 --> 00:45:59.081]  So, that doesn't fit into the equation.
[00:45:59.645 --> 00:46:01.366]  I was just using that as an example, I'm sorry.
[00:46:01.606 --> 00:46:04.908]  Yeah, no, but look, I mean, life is life.
[00:46:04.948 --> 00:46:05.529]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:11.332]  I mean, when you get in your car, that's the number one cause of death until you get 55 years of age, and it's cancer and heart attacks.
[00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:15.094]  You know, I get in my car every day.
[00:46:15.174 --> 00:46:16.615]  I mean, life is not perfect.
[00:46:16.655 --> 00:46:17.596]  Life is not safe.
[00:46:18.216 --> 00:46:22.479]  If you try to play life where it's going to be safe, that's the most dangerous course.
[00:46:22.639 --> 00:46:23.399]  I mean, seriously.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.561]  Sitting there stagnant,
[00:46:27.664 --> 00:46:29.045]  is not where I want to be.
[00:46:29.445 --> 00:46:31.145]  Norm in Denver, Colorado.
[00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:32.026]  Norm, thanks for holding.
[00:46:32.066 --> 00:46:32.426]  Go ahead.
[00:46:32.446 --> 00:46:34.206]  Norm hung up.
[00:46:34.306 --> 00:46:35.067]  Okay, who's up next?
[00:46:36.267 --> 00:46:37.347]  Phil in Colorado.
[00:46:37.387 --> 00:46:37.788]  Go ahead.
[00:46:38.048 --> 00:46:38.668]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:38.968 --> 00:46:39.368]  That's all right.
[00:46:39.388 --> 00:46:39.888]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:40.248 --> 00:46:42.989]  I'm in Colorado Springs, so that's why I thought you'd be talking to me.
[00:46:43.009 --> 00:46:43.550]  That's okay.
[00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:44.470]  You're on the air now, sir.
[00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.070]  How you doing?
[00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.670]  Good.
[00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.871]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:52.913]  As a matter of fact, I talked to you before the war started.
[00:46:52.953 --> 00:46:53.153]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:57.324 --> 00:47:05.306]  A lot of the stuff that you say has, I mean, you're real careful at what you say, and I appreciate that.
[00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:07.246]  I mean, I'm pretty sure most of your listeners do.
[00:47:07.446 --> 00:47:10.287]  You don't really make stupid predictions like some people do.
[00:47:11.027 --> 00:47:16.728]  But, um, I, um, you kind of jumped, kind of went on it a different way today.
[00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:18.268]  Well, that's all right, son.
[00:47:18.288 --> 00:47:19.909]  Whatever subject you want to raise, go ahead.
[00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.529]  Oh, okay.
[00:47:21.189 --> 00:47:26.010]  Um, well, I'm, it's kind of tied into what you're talking about.
[00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:32.822]  Especially in the last couple of days about the police state and the national ID cards.
[00:47:33.302 --> 00:47:33.542]  Yes.
[00:47:34.022 --> 00:47:38.584]  All those laws, the Patriot Act and stuff.
[00:47:39.485 --> 00:47:44.447]  What do you think is the main trigger point for all that stuff?
[00:47:44.607 --> 00:47:53.051]  When they nuke a major city or release a weaponized smallpox, it will begin.
[00:47:53.863 --> 00:47:59.667]  And if we submit to it, it will end within 10 years with an 80% world population reduction.
[00:48:00.387 --> 00:48:03.889]  The more liberty we give up, the more severe the terror attacks will get.
[00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:06.030]  I mean, I'm not trying to say something scary.
[00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:18.378]  From all the evidence, these people killed conservatively 100 million plus people last century, and they're warming up to make that look like tiddlywinks in this century.
[00:48:18.809 --> 00:48:24.051]  So a lot of people that I'm around, they really don't suspect anything's going on.
[00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:27.832]  They just think 9-1-1 was one thing, and they wait for the next thing to happen.
[00:48:28.792 --> 00:48:31.853]  When they finally wake up, don't you think civil war is probable?
[00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:36.115]  Absolutely, and that's why you see the police state being geared up everywhere.
[00:48:36.895 --> 00:48:42.417]  The helicopters with the knockout gas waiting in hangars in every region of the country.
[00:48:43.576 --> 00:48:45.597]  Declassified government documents two years ago.
[00:48:46.057 --> 00:48:48.039]  Microwave guns on top of Humvees.
[00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:49.079]  Soundwave cannons.
[00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:51.240]  Police in black armored outfits.
[00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:54.162]  Uh, y'all know they got horrible stuff planned for us.
[00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:57.144]  So that's why they don't like the militia?
[00:48:58.364 --> 00:48:58.885]  Exactly.
[00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:02.767]  That's why they lie about them and demonize them.
[00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:03.727]  Exactly.
[00:49:04.168 --> 00:49:09.311]  So there's no... I mean, I guess information for the information is
[00:49:10.717 --> 00:49:14.418]  The most important thing, because by then we probably won't have no weapons either.
[00:49:14.938 --> 00:49:18.418]  And the globalists would have already carried out more terror attacks if we hadn't been fighting them.
[00:49:18.779 --> 00:49:19.739]  We're having a lot of victories.
[00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:23.219]  Look, they would already be in Iran and Syria if we hadn't been.
[00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:29.441]  But look, the draft, the police state, all of it comes after the next massive terror attack.
[00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:34.021]  They're going to get up on TV and say, see, we told you to give your rights up.
[00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:35.122]  We could have protected you.
[00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:36.902]  Now we're taking all of your freedoms.
[00:49:38.365 --> 00:49:43.608]  Yeah, and they probably get a lot of their information straight before they set off or whatever they're going to do.
[00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:53.253]  Because the World Trade Centers, their information is still all messed up and they still got through to make everybody believe that those towers collapsed.
[00:49:53.453 --> 00:49:54.253]  I don't think they did.
[00:49:54.293 --> 00:49:57.875]  I think they were demoed, like Tower 7.
[00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:03.278]  But to me, it was an outstanding job by the government.
[00:50:03.698 --> 00:50:07.960]  When the curtain came through and the actors came into play,
[00:50:08.669 --> 00:50:10.070]  They have most of America's food.
[00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:16.793]  And I'm sorry to say, when the news goes off in a major city, I have everybody's food.
[00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:17.534]  What are you saying?
[00:50:17.554 --> 00:50:19.215]  Were you part of an anti-terrorism drill?
[00:50:20.015 --> 00:50:20.475]  Who, me?
[00:50:21.216 --> 00:50:21.916]  In the military.
[00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:25.098]  Yeah, well you were talking about actors.
[00:50:25.818 --> 00:50:27.279]  Well, that's what it was.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.880]  That's exactly what it was.
[00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.502]  People from the ground controlled the plane.
[00:50:33.302 --> 00:50:36.444]  People from the... They set up the demo.
[00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:39.834]  You know, I mean, those are government people.
[00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:41.915]  I'm pretty sure it was military installations.
[00:50:41.995 --> 00:50:45.057]  People that were part of military teams did that.
[00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:46.518]  That's my belief.
[00:50:46.578 --> 00:50:48.159]  I'm not saying that's what it is.
[00:50:48.299 --> 00:50:49.880]  Well, Phil, excellent points.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.500]  Anything else?
[00:50:50.821 --> 00:50:51.241]  No, that's good.
[00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:52.522]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:53.262]  Call back again.
[00:50:53.282 --> 00:50:56.044]  Tony, Tim, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:50:56.064 --> 00:50:57.425]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:02.793]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:02.973 --> 00:51:06.055]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.195 --> 00:51:10.077]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.137 --> 00:51:14.399]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.502]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.582 --> 00:51:20.363]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:23.286 --> 00:51:28.671]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:31.894]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.074 --> 00:51:34.957]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:41.543]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.063 --> 00:51:45.865]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.265 --> 00:51:47.646]  Order your video today.
[00:51:47.966 --> 00:51:49.027]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.047 --> 00:51:51.368]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.388 --> 00:51:52.629]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.

[00:52:06.167 --> 00:52:11.612]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:52:11.652 --> 00:52:15.956]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:52:16.277 --> 00:52:19.319]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.063]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:52:23.363 --> 00:52:32.730]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.

[00:55:46.866 --> 00:55:47.928]  You're on the air.
[00:55:47.968 --> 00:55:48.188]  Welcome.
[00:55:58.191 --> 00:55:58.491]  Hello.
[00:55:58.831 --> 00:55:59.471]  Yes, welcome.
[00:55:59.671 --> 00:56:01.672]  Okay, hi Alex, an honor to talk to you.
[00:56:02.272 --> 00:56:05.172]  I just wanted to, if I could, toss in a quick Bible verse.
[00:56:05.272 --> 00:56:10.333]  It's Ezekiel 3, 17, and it says, I have appointed you a watchman over my people.
[00:56:10.413 --> 00:56:15.554]  God was saying to Israel, and I kind of see you and Steve Coyle and many others as that, and I thank you for what you do.
[00:56:15.594 --> 00:56:18.255]  We lift you up in prayer and do our best to support you.
[00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.455]  Well, thank you for the prayer.
[00:56:19.855 --> 00:56:20.255]  Definitely.
[00:56:20.875 --> 00:56:24.776]  I just wanted to come alongside, in fact, Phil in Colorado just kind of really nailed it.
[00:56:25.774 --> 00:56:27.535]  The announcement about the Bin Laden thing.
[00:56:27.775 --> 00:56:34.479]  Steve Quayle last night was on coast to coast and he didn't go for the bait that this is some announcement of some kind.
[00:56:34.719 --> 00:56:36.940]  He quoted Steve Aguinaldo as saying this is a psy-op.
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.221]  They're getting ready for the big one.
[00:56:39.801 --> 00:56:43.603]  I have friends both in the military and I called you once before about Las Vegas.
[00:56:43.844 --> 00:56:45.504]  I fear it is a target.
[00:56:46.685 --> 00:56:49.106]  These people are psychopaths but they're occultists.
[00:56:49.126 --> 00:56:51.327]  You've pointed this out and I think you have.
[00:56:51.348 --> 00:56:54.009]  There's a lot of reasons for optimism and a couple points I want to add.
[00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:57.130]  You have pointed out there, we have forced all things.
[00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:00.111]  I really believe they had planned to be well ahead of schedule.
[00:57:00.571 --> 00:57:05.693]  And things with the election, us getting ahead of the loop on Bin Laden already being iced and other things.
[00:57:06.093 --> 00:57:07.073]  It definitely works.
[00:57:07.153 --> 00:57:09.994]  What people are doing is changing the outcome of events.
[00:57:10.494 --> 00:57:14.915]  But as you were the one to blow up Bohemian Grove, these people are occultists.
[00:57:14.975 --> 00:57:16.496]  And if I could just give one real quick
[00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:17.887]  The Fast History Lesson.
[00:57:18.167 --> 00:57:23.272]  Go back to 2003, and you go February 1st, we had the tragedy with the Spatial Columbia.
[00:57:23.692 --> 00:57:25.273]  That is an occult holiday.
[00:57:25.914 --> 00:57:30.097]  And it is known as Olmec or Candlemas, February 1st and the 2nd.
[00:57:30.378 --> 00:57:34.121]  You follow it on, because the occult, it goes way, way back, thousands of years.
[00:57:34.141 --> 00:57:36.583]  9-11, 3-11, they're all dates.
[00:57:37.023 --> 00:57:40.867]  Absolutely, but they follow the occult holidays.
[00:57:40.927 --> 00:57:44.470]  I mean, people in the Wiccan and other things, they honor the solstices.
[00:57:45.144 --> 00:57:49.708]  And you come back and the next date that was critical to the culture was March 20th into 21st.
[00:57:49.768 --> 00:57:51.529]  That's the day they launched the war in Iraq.
[00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:58.435]  The next critical date in 2003 on the yearly calendar... And Mars was the closest to the Earth it had been in hundreds of years.
[00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:59.595]  Thank you for pointing that out.
[00:57:59.796 --> 00:58:00.756]  Absolutely right.
[00:58:00.836 --> 00:58:07.582]  It is so important we pay attention to this in the weeks ahead because they're probably going to pull it and we need to pay attention to these dates.
[00:58:07.662 --> 00:58:08.803]  And the next one was May 1st.
[00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.451]  And May 1st ties into communism, but it goes way back to the occult first.
[00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:19.654]  And that's the end of the April Solstice, and they call it Grand Climax.
[00:58:19.894 --> 00:58:27.336]  And that's when Bush landed on the Abraham Lincoln as the sun was setting in the West, and declared, you know, Babylon is basically ours.
[00:58:28.337 --> 00:58:29.917]  I'm sorry, are you coming to a break?
[00:58:29.977 --> 00:58:32.738]  And for those that don't know, I mean, it's admitted mainstream news.
[00:58:32.778 --> 00:58:37.300]  They really believe in this, this is really, I mean, skull and bones, bohemian robe, this is real!
[00:58:38.272 --> 00:58:39.352]  Great points.
[00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:39.932]  Anything else?
[00:58:40.453 --> 00:58:41.833]  Yeah, I had one more statement to make.
[00:58:41.913 --> 00:58:42.573]  Alright, stay there.
[00:58:42.613 --> 00:58:44.633]  We're going to start the second hour.
[00:58:44.673 --> 00:58:48.154]  We'll let you finish up and then go to Tim and Rita and Don and others.
[00:58:57.476 --> 00:58:58.156]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.796 --> 00:58:59.917]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.557 --> 00:59:01.617]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.316 --> 00:59:03.156]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.897 --> 00:59:04.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.237 --> 00:59:09.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.638 --> 00:59:13.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.641 --> 00:59:19.162]  Alright folks, into hour number two.
[00:59:19.202 --> 00:59:20.462]  Got a big guest coming up.
[00:59:20.522 --> 00:59:26.704]  Talk about the occult symbols all over our modern architecture.
[00:59:27.264 --> 00:59:29.305]  And it's made big news in Canada.
[00:59:29.927 --> 00:59:30.907]  It's very important.
[00:59:30.947 --> 00:59:33.668]  With all this world news going on, why am I going to spend time on this?
[00:59:33.688 --> 00:59:34.549]  You'll find out why.
[00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:36.610]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.191]  Let's talk to Kyle in Ohio.
[00:59:39.211 --> 00:59:39.971]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[00:59:39.991 --> 00:59:40.831]  How you doing, sir?
[00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:41.311]  Good.
[00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:48.634]  I was just wondering, did you see the articles about the military's new uniform makeover with the new camouflage to blend in with buildings in an urban environment?
[00:59:48.674 --> 00:59:53.036]  Yeah, in my film, Police State 2000, made in 99, we show the new black and white
[00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:58.899]  Uh, pixelated computer style uniforms that literally blend in like nothing I've ever seen.
[00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:01.841]  Yeah, I just seen the article on the AP recently, they were going to do it.
[01:00:02.401 --> 01:00:08.705]  And I was walking through the toy store looking for toys for my kids and they had what's called, new GI Joe, they're called World Peace Keepers.
[01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:17.449]  Actually, I'm not tootin' my horn, but we have one of these dollar stores by my house, and about four years ago, they had these big G.I.
[01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:24.339]  Joe world peacekeepers, they had these mean looks on their faces, and in one box I saw says, you go out and defeat the evil militia.
[01:00:24.979 --> 01:00:25.600]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.962]  And also they have the guns they use for door-to-door.
[01:00:28.262 --> 01:00:30.364]  You know, MP5s and close counter guns.
[01:00:30.384 --> 01:00:34.187]  Sir, about half the military video games that are out there now, you're a U.N.
[01:00:34.267 --> 01:00:35.068]  battle lord.
[01:00:35.128 --> 01:00:37.210]  You crush the evil right-wing militias.
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:41.053]  You defeat the terrorists, the right-wing terrorists that work with Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:41.454 --> 01:00:44.196]  And our kids are all playing these games getting brainwashed.
[01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:48.840]  Well, the one I've seen, it had the pixelated uniform, the gray and the white, and a little bit of black.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.742]  So that was kind of scary.
[01:00:51.676 --> 01:00:55.199]  Yeah, no, it's like a computer design, a fractal design, totally random.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.541]  Very effective.
[01:00:57.782 --> 01:01:10.993]  In my film, Police State 2000, I have the Dutch and German troops in those uniforms training to confiscate our guns, and they admit this is training for America, and it shows mock interrogations of Americans asking them, where'd you get the guns?
[01:01:11.414 --> 01:01:12.595]  Why are you resisting us?
[01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.797]  I don't see why that doesn't wake people up.
[01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.900]  I mean, that AP article is right there on the Yahoo page, and it says,
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.121]  Camouflaging for urban environments.
[01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:21.461]  That's not normal warfare.
[01:01:21.901 --> 01:01:23.322]  That's for door-to-door gun competition.
[01:01:23.342 --> 01:01:24.823]  Well, it's all mount training.
[01:01:24.883 --> 01:01:27.343]  It's pacification of general public.
[01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:27.964]  Right.
[01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.684]  That's basically all I wanted to say.
[01:01:29.944 --> 01:01:30.705]  Good to hear from you.
[01:01:30.745 --> 01:01:31.765]  I appreciate the call.
[01:01:32.305 --> 01:01:33.666]  Let's talk to Tom in Texas.
[01:01:33.706 --> 01:01:34.486]  Tom, go ahead.
[01:01:37.207 --> 01:01:41.649]  Before Tom gets to the phone, I'm just going to say that, yeah, that's a major shift I've seen in the last four or five years.
[01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:44.830]  You can't find toys when I'm in Target or something.
[01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.831]  You know, I look at the toys when I'm walking through those areas.
[01:01:47.731 --> 01:01:49.372]  You know, getting the kids play-doh or whatever.
[01:01:49.933 --> 01:01:52.134]  And you don't see American stars or U.S.
[01:01:52.174 --> 01:01:52.835]  Marines anymore.
[01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:55.937]  It's all UN, World Peacekeeper, UN, EU.
[01:01:55.957 --> 01:01:57.358]  Okay, Tom, are you there?
[01:01:57.378 --> 01:01:58.178]  Yeah, sure am.
[01:01:58.318 --> 01:01:58.699]  Go ahead.
[01:01:58.879 --> 01:02:00.060]  Okay, great show.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.020]  I love all your stuff.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.721]  I'm going to try to order some of your videos.
[01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:06.344]  I just want to hear what your thoughts were on the parallels.
[01:02:06.364 --> 01:02:15.110]  Some people are now pointing out between this Jeff Gannon situation and I guess it was some stories that came out in the Washington Times and
[01:02:15.726 --> 01:02:18.088]  I guess one of the New York Times in the late 80s about this.
[01:02:18.848 --> 01:02:25.053]  I know some kind of a gay call person ring operating in Washington with lobbyists and politicians.
[01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:27.415]  Yeah, it's underage.
[01:02:28.616 --> 01:02:30.337]  Actually, Caller called about this last week.
[01:02:30.377 --> 01:02:32.999]  I covered it many years ago with Senator DeCamp and others.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:43.828]  But I have the actual Washington Times article from, what, 89 with an underage gay call ring, midnight tour of the White House.
[01:02:46.112 --> 01:02:51.517]  You know, this particular nexus with these fake reporters the White House has got in there, I don't know anything about that.
[01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:59.044]  But I do know that, I mean, the New York Post reported last year they ship in top gay porn stars to quote, service the Bohemian Grove members.
[01:02:59.724 --> 01:03:01.105]  I mean, that's New York Post!
[01:03:01.926 --> 01:03:09.012]  I mean, I've got spy magazine articles from the 80s about it, I've got parade magazine articles from the 80s, I've got
[01:03:10.223 --> 01:03:23.205]  All I've got, I've got, we can't play it on the air because he's cussing, but I have President Nixon audio, it was in the text of the Harper's article decades ago, but telling Harper's about the horrible homosexual orgies.
[01:03:23.225 --> 01:03:38.108]  Yeah, well I don't know if you saw the Bill Maher show the other night, but they were, I mean, Charlie Suggesting and he had Leslie Stahl on, talking about that, I mean, somebody in the White House, I don't know, somehow tied to this guy, I mean, they're letting him in, having him ask
[01:03:39.034 --> 01:03:39.755]  Stay there.
[01:03:39.795 --> 01:03:41.959]  I got a guest coming up and I'm going to let you finish after the break.
[01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:42.579]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.012 --> 01:03:54.534]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.714 --> 01:03:57.798]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:57.938 --> 01:04:01.843]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:06.128]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:10.252]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.373 --> 01:04:12.195]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.755 --> 01:04:15.676]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:15.716 --> 01:04:20.437]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.597 --> 01:04:23.638]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.679]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:33.281]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.801 --> 01:04:37.604]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.901]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:55.242 --> 01:04:58.045]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.306 --> 01:05:02.451]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:02.891 --> 01:05:03.712]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:08.618]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.099 --> 01:05:11.182]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:05:51.897 --> 01:05:55.259]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:55.839]  Why?
[01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:58.800]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[01:06:57.516 --> 01:06:58.136]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.837 --> 01:06:59.918]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.598 --> 01:07:01.699]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:03.240]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:05.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.862 --> 01:07:09.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.685 --> 01:07:13.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.971 --> 01:07:25.176]  Well, the validated, vindicated UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, says he's got inside sources that
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.401]  We're going to war with Iran in June.
[01:07:29.502 --> 01:07:30.642]  I hope that's not the case.
[01:07:30.702 --> 01:07:32.123]  More on that coming up later.
[01:07:32.143 --> 01:07:38.106]  I also want to get into some of the new horrible police state developments here in the United States.
[01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:44.049]  Bush again pushing for total blanket amnesty for any illegal alien that's in the country or anybody that wants to come in.
[01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:47.671]  But telling us as citizens we've got to give up all of our liberties and freedoms.
[01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:53.514]  Here in about a minute or two we'll be covering, well this Globe and Mail article out of Canada, a building of secrets
[01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:59.319]  Of secrets encoded, clues, Manitoba legislature built as a talisman.
[01:08:00.199 --> 01:08:05.000]  Now again, I've got like five major Canadian papers, CBC, all these articles.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:17.023]  This stuff is real, folks, and we've got a research fellow at the University of Winnipeg in Canada with a research post there joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:17.043 --> 01:08:20.924]  But I said that I was going to let this next caller,
[01:08:24.358 --> 01:08:27.959]  Tom in Texas finished up what he was saying.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.942]  He was talking about this reporter, who wasn't a reporter, who had a fake name, who was in these White House press briefings.
[01:08:34.962 --> 01:08:38.984]  And of course it's come out about Armstrong Williams, and Armstrong said, I'm the tip of the iceberg.
[01:08:39.364 --> 01:08:47.667]  Folks, there are thousands of reporters, paid, in some cases millions, most cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, that go out and pitch different programs and the like.
[01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.811]  And it's totally illegal.
[01:08:50.851 --> 01:08:53.432]  Bill Clinton did it to some extent.
[01:08:53.573 --> 01:09:01.919]  One program was $76 million for fake newscasts pushing the Medicare-Medicaid prescription drug benefit changes of last year.
[01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:04.120]  But again, that's back of the paper.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.923]  They give all this attention to Armstrong-Williams and the rest of it.
[01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:26.617]  But the caller was bringing up all these news reports now, talking about this guy's connection to gay call rings, and it goes back to the 80s, and the Washington Times reporting on this, and again, I'm not really getting into it or going there, but it's just massive
[01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:31.311]  But the media is kind of getting us to disassociate mentally from this.
[01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:33.192]  I'm like, well, why did he have a fake name?
[01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:33.972]  And should he get in trouble?
[01:09:34.012 --> 01:09:37.093]  It's not, why did he work for a group paid for by the White House?
[01:09:37.554 --> 01:09:42.915]  Well, if you've got fake reporters, you've got to give them fake names so you don't track them back to the White House.
[01:09:43.656 --> 01:09:46.297]  So, just all of their reporting is now suspect.
[01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.818]  Real fast, finish what you were saying, Tom.
[01:09:50.918 --> 01:09:52.479]  I will stop there, but I just want to say this.
[01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:53.179]  You're talking about
[01:09:53.735 --> 01:09:56.237]  Proving things that you and others have said for a long time.
[01:09:56.297 --> 01:09:57.117]  I think this does it.
[01:09:57.137 --> 01:09:58.758]  I mean, this is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:09:58.818 --> 01:10:02.160]  In fact, we had a fake reporter who had access to the White House.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.402]  People are being investigated for going to peace rallies.
[01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:11.706]  So it's just really disgusting and demoralizing, but I hope you'll keep reporting on this.
[01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:12.735]  Thanks a lot.
[01:10:13.095 --> 01:10:13.696]  Well, I will.
[01:10:13.796 --> 01:10:16.877]  I mean, look, I coined the term propaganda placement.
[01:10:16.917 --> 01:10:30.244]  You know when you go see a movie at the cinema and they go, mmm, Doritos, or mmm, this Budweiser's delicious, or you see Coca-Cola cans, or for some reason in the movie all you see is hundreds of Ford Tauruses on the highway?
[01:10:31.765 --> 01:10:31.985]  Yeah.
[01:10:32.305 --> 01:10:33.686]  Uh, I appreciate the call.
[01:10:33.726 --> 01:10:34.406]  Take care, Tom.
[01:10:34.466 --> 01:10:34.646]  Yeah.
[01:10:35.046 --> 01:10:36.347]  Uh, they had the, uh,
[01:10:37.105 --> 01:10:38.286]  That show, The Apprentice.
[01:10:38.926 --> 01:10:39.587]  And what was it?
[01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:43.129]  Virgin Airlines for one season paid, what was it?
[01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:49.333]  Thirty-six million dollars just to have Virgin Airlines mentioned by the contestants?
[01:10:49.873 --> 01:10:51.294]  That's product placement.
[01:10:51.394 --> 01:10:51.814]  Fine.
[01:10:52.195 --> 01:10:54.396]  It ruins television, ruins movies, but do it.
[01:10:54.996 --> 01:10:56.477]  That's not criminal.
[01:10:56.717 --> 01:10:59.519]  And it's manipulative, but that's what advertising is.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.323]  Now, propaganda placement, and we're going to our guest, who's holding patiently while I rant and rave,
[01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:10.921]  Propaganda placement, which I hope you'll use the term and get it into popular use, because I think it's an important term.
[01:11:11.861 --> 01:11:28.247]  I coined the term four years ago, wrote a big treatise on it, on propaganda placement, is this very process of, well, when you see Hollywood movies now, they admit the Defense Department is paying to have being drafted, going into the military, being promoted.
[01:11:28.894 --> 01:11:36.419]  They've been for a long time letting Hollywood people use free jets and tanks and aircraft carriers, tens of millions of dollars in value.
[01:11:36.819 --> 01:11:37.600]  That's bad enough.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.563]  Now it's, we're going to pay Hollywood to put propaganda in its shows.
[01:11:43.624 --> 01:11:51.990]  We've caught the gun control groups that spend tens of millions a year and get federal grants to put anti-Second Amendment messages in the TV shows and movies.
[01:11:52.853 --> 01:11:57.095]  That's why you'll be watching an episode of Friends and they'll go, hey, the new old order's taken over.
[01:11:57.275 --> 01:11:58.115]  World government's here.
[01:11:58.255 --> 01:11:59.136]  That's just the way it is.
[01:11:59.636 --> 01:12:01.276]  Just out of the blue they say that?
[01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:02.837]  Turned out that was paid for.
[01:12:03.477 --> 01:12:04.678]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now.
[01:12:04.698 --> 01:12:08.999]  I apologize to our guest who's been holding patiently.
[01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:14.021]  Again, he's a research fellow at the University of Winnipeg in Canada, Frank Albo.
[01:12:14.642 --> 01:12:17.683]  And he has made a real splash in Canada.
[01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:20.104]  And Frank, good to have you on with us.
[01:12:21.076 --> 01:12:21.897]  Nice to be on, Alex.
[01:12:21.977 --> 01:12:22.337]  Thank you.
[01:12:22.798 --> 01:12:23.679]  You bet.
[01:12:24.659 --> 01:12:29.323]  Really, I've never seen... It's on Discovery Channel and History Channel.
[01:12:29.343 --> 01:12:31.886]  They admit that Washington is set up as a giant pentagram.
[01:12:32.486 --> 01:12:38.331]  I've seen it in a few places, but really, you're getting massive attention in Canada.
[01:12:38.411 --> 01:12:39.172]  Tell us all about it.
[01:12:39.705 --> 01:12:46.830]  Well, the attention, I think, is probably geared towards the fact that I'm approaching this as an academic.
[01:12:47.571 --> 01:13:08.205]  I'm reviewing the building, its proportions, its correspondence to ancient temples, its incorporation of Masonic motifs, Hermeticism, ideas that were quite flourishing in the Renaissance and onwards in what today are called, you know, occult societies or, you know, esoteric philosophy and the like.
[01:13:09.095 --> 01:13:30.895]  And my examination of this building has strictly focused on this building, and it's extraordinary the level of depth, sophistication, that ideas of temple ideology and masonry are incorporated in the building, from the mosaics on the floor to the dimensions of the columns,
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:54.141]  All the way down to the figure which crowns the building, which most think is merely an icon of Manitoba's youth and enterprise, but really is designed and modeled after Hermes, who most people who have some education in this area would know is the great father of esoteric philosophy, alchemy, magic, and the like.
[01:13:54.677 --> 01:14:04.925]  And it's his position up there which makes it noted, at least from my perspective, why there would be such a level of sophistication throughout the building.
[01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:07.987]  All the way down to numerology.
[01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:13.632]  One room in particular that's built to the cubic dimensions of the Holy of Holies of Solomon's Temple.
[01:14:13.752 --> 01:14:21.438]  I mean, following the dimensions of Solomon's Temple in a building in the middle of North America, that is amazing.
[01:14:22.566 --> 01:14:30.166]  Well it is, but when they just coronated or christened a month ago, three weeks ago, the new Austin City Council...
[01:14:31.269 --> 01:14:35.152]  It is building a dorm with all these different occult symbols.
[01:14:35.232 --> 01:14:38.514]  It's built out of bronze and brass.
[01:14:39.234 --> 01:14:41.736]  A deck with all of these designs.
[01:14:41.836 --> 01:14:43.777]  It's three six-story buildings.
[01:14:44.357 --> 01:14:50.921]  And I pointed this out, and then they had a witch come, a Wiccan come, and coronate it in an official city ceremony.
[01:14:50.941 --> 01:14:52.122]  That was the front page of the paper.
[01:14:52.162 --> 01:14:56.745]  So, I mean, this stuff's really kind of coming out of the closet these days.
[01:14:57.779 --> 01:15:05.763]  But I noticed in one particular article, it describes how you first woke up to this or got your interest peaked.
[01:15:06.063 --> 01:15:07.844]  You were driving past the building.
[01:15:08.124 --> 01:15:09.125]  Tell us what you noticed.
[01:15:09.945 --> 01:15:14.968]  Well, I noticed for the first time, even though, and I should preface this by noting that
[01:15:15.382 --> 01:15:21.727]  Sometimes things are so blatantly in your face that you fail to recognize some of the details.
[01:15:21.747 --> 01:15:22.808]  Well, that's part of their religion.
[01:15:22.848 --> 01:15:29.473]  In fact, I have the data page on InfoWars.com called Illuminati Secret Language Hidden in Plain View.
[01:15:29.714 --> 01:15:31.855]  That's part of their religion, but go ahead.
[01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:32.196]  Right.
[01:15:32.256 --> 01:15:43.765]  Now, Hidden in Plain View is quite the mandate to concern ourselves with here, because I noticed that there were two Egyptian sphinxes flanking the north pediment of the building.
[01:15:44.136 --> 01:16:06.154]  Now, of course, sphinxes have nothing to do with the prospects of Manitoba at the time the building was christened, but what is interesting is, and I did my background, my graduate work is in ancient Near Eastern religions, is that sphinx symbolize something else.
[01:16:06.536 --> 01:16:24.388]  But what really drew my attention to those sphinxes is that I found that they bore an inscription, a bonafide hieroglyphic inscription that you can't see from ground level, but from the roof, and I had it translated by a noted Egyptologist in Canada,
[01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:30.032]  And it translated basically as an invocation to the sun god, Ray.
[01:16:31.113 --> 01:16:44.819]  Now, that already in and of itself is quite remarkable, but in the middle of the inscription was a cartouche of a very known pharaoh, at least in ancient Egypt, named Thutmose III.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:52.383]  And what was remarkable, at least in my discoveries, is I could not situate this pharaoh with Manitoba history in the smallest measure.
[01:16:53.087 --> 01:17:04.970]  But what was led to is that Thutmose III actually has a bona fide place of high esteem among secret societies, namely Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry.
[01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:12.891]  Because, at least from his annals, about 3,500 years ago, he established what was... He set up the universities of Western religions.
[01:17:13.412 --> 01:17:15.272]  Right, apparently so.
[01:17:15.372 --> 01:17:19.553]  Now, this is hard to corroborate as an ancient historian,
[01:17:20.097 --> 01:17:26.385]  But in the minds of those who... Well, no, I mean, he is accredited with setting up the first universities on planet Earth.
[01:17:26.465 --> 01:17:27.306]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:17:27.867 --> 01:17:29.469]  I've even seen that on the History Channel.
[01:17:29.489 --> 01:17:30.370]  But let me just say this.
[01:17:30.871 --> 01:17:38.040]  Now, again, for those who don't get this, their religion is embodied in architecture because the secret construction guilds
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:45.206]  Started in Egypt, the mathematics of how to build buildings was very well guarded because it brought great power and esteem.
[01:17:45.526 --> 01:17:54.573]  The second highest level in Egyptian hierarchy of government was the head construction masters, so they handed this down secretly through secret societies.
[01:17:54.873 --> 01:17:59.337]  Then it goes into Solomon and the temple, then into the masons of today.
[01:17:59.377 --> 01:17:59.717]  Go ahead.
[01:18:00.237 --> 01:18:00.498]  Right.
[01:18:00.978 --> 01:18:01.158]  That's...
[01:18:04.168 --> 01:18:04.928]  Quite the history.
[01:18:04.988 --> 01:18:23.373]  I know this isn't the official version, and most of my academic peers would undoubtedly sneer at such a chronology, but the idea is that within certain secret institutions, that is what they deem to be the, you know, bona fide chronology.
[01:18:23.393 --> 01:18:25.374]  Well, I've had family that were 33rd degree nations.
[01:18:26.156 --> 01:18:26.737]  Right, right.
[01:18:26.797 --> 01:18:30.520]  Now, you know, this was pretty much my introduction.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:46.392]  I almost fell off my chair when I found that out, but this pretty much springboarded a whole Indiana Jones type adventure that even led me to what is an artistic representation of the Ark of the Covenant.
[01:18:46.572 --> 01:18:47.993]  This is incredibly powerful.
[01:18:48.013 --> 01:18:49.214]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:18:53.223 --> 01:18:59.427]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:07.653]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:15.858]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.158 --> 01:19:20.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:25.961]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:26.481 --> 01:19:30.323]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:30.823 --> 01:19:31.843]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:31.903 --> 01:19:36.004]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:19:41.326 --> 01:19:43.827]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:19:50.693 --> 01:19:55.396]  I'm David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:56.177 --> 01:20:01.802]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:02.602]  Supreme Court.
[01:20:03.363 --> 01:20:07.667]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:20:07.707 --> 01:20:11.250]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:17.561]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:59.828]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:05.232]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:21:05.572 --> 01:21:08.054]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove
[01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:14.876]  Pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:21:15.196 --> 01:21:20.157]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:21:20.478 --> 01:21:24.499]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:29.480]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:35.742]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:21:52.364 --> 01:21:54.725]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:54.985 --> 01:21:58.826]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:21:59.146 --> 01:21:59.946]  Read the labels.
[01:22:00.387 --> 01:22:04.508]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:04.728 --> 01:22:08.929]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:09.289 --> 01:22:14.151]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:18.132]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:22:57.871 --> 01:23:03.255]  Folks, I have great uncles, great grandparents, and I've got them at my grandparents' house in East Texas.
[01:23:03.295 --> 01:23:05.116]  I've got the old Masonic books in there.
[01:23:05.794 --> 01:23:12.466]  The Lone Star State of Texas was founded by Masons, and they're not all evil, because it's compartmentalized.
[01:23:13.347 --> 01:23:19.578]  The lower level members don't know what they're part of at the higher level, and the higher level Masons don't think they're worshipping Lucifer.
[01:23:21.251 --> 01:23:30.773]  The classic devil, they think Lucifer is Ra, or the Sun God, or the Illuminated One, and they think Christians have just warped all of this.
[01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.834]  So, it's amazing stuff.
[01:23:33.094 --> 01:23:34.074]  And in D.C.
[01:23:34.154 --> 01:23:35.115]  it's all laid out like this.
[01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:45.697]  But we're talking to a research fellow with the Research Post, the University of Winnipeg, who has... I was just talking to him during the break.
[01:23:45.877 --> 01:23:49.098]  Masons are now admitting this to him and trying to actually even help him out.
[01:23:49.873 --> 01:23:51.954]  I guess because now they think it's, quote, the new age.
[01:23:52.014 --> 01:23:54.655]  The new age is gone and they're supposed to reveal all this.
[01:23:54.695 --> 01:23:56.556]  We're seeing all this revealing.
[01:23:57.317 --> 01:24:11.203]  But please continue with the, when you figured out the Masonic cubit was the cubit they were using, this measurement, then you entered that in and it opened up a whole world to you just with this particular government building, the legislature in Manitoba.
[01:24:12.068 --> 01:24:12.328]  Right.
[01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:25.193]  You know, as I indicated earlier, my academic background is in ancient Near Eastern religion, and part of that is that you learn the conventions of ancient temple practices, how they were designed and whatnot.
[01:24:25.653 --> 01:24:32.916]  And my early argument with the building was that it followed the plan of an ancient temple, and it does, right down to the smallest detail.
[01:24:33.397 --> 01:24:39.399]  And as every temple contains, is the inner sanctum, or
[01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:44.049]  At least in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant rests.
[01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:48.392]  And I was able to find that particular room in the building.
[01:24:49.812 --> 01:25:05.681]  However, where I reached a small impasse temporarily, is that the measurements of the room, the actual measurements of the room, which were 24 feet, did not fit into any cubit arrangement that I knew that was employed in the ancient world.
[01:25:05.961 --> 01:25:09.203]  Meaning, it wasn't the Greek cubit, it wasn't the Roman cubit, it wasn't
[01:25:10.053 --> 01:25:36.450]  Any other standard form, or the Egyptian cubit, and this was an impasse in my dissertation, but it occurred to me later that Masons also incorporated a particular type of cubit, which was different than any other ancient form of cubit, and that cubit measurement, when I employed that number into this room, which I knew by the convention of the building, was laid out to be the Holy of Holies,
[01:25:36.855 --> 01:25:44.303]  It turned out to be exactly the size that is indicated in the Book of Kings as the size of the Holy of Holies.
[01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:52.271]  Now, just to add measure to this hypothesis, is that directly above that room, hidden,
[01:25:53.808 --> 01:26:06.476]  Well, it's actually overt once you look at it, but directly above that room is a square war chest flanked by two winged warriors, which is the typical description of what the Ark of the Covenant looked like.
[01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:10.639]  Now, at this point I felt
[01:26:11.501 --> 01:26:13.003]  This was clearly established.
[01:26:14.103 --> 01:26:16.325]  The room followed the dimensions of the Holy of Holies.
[01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:18.287]  Meanwhile, outside, you've got sphinxes.
[01:26:18.727 --> 01:26:25.352]  You've got the sphinxes with this carving that can only be seen from above where the sun god is at high noon.
[01:26:25.873 --> 01:26:26.233]  Correct.
[01:26:26.613 --> 01:26:32.238]  In fact, they face east and west, these sphinxes, so it was quite typical in the ancient world.
[01:26:32.658 --> 01:26:39.641]  That inscriptions, hieroglyphs, were thought to contain divine power just by the very nature of their shape.
[01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:42.142]  And so the profane shouldn't be able to look upon them.
[01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:48.485]  The key, and literally key, inscriptions should only be visible by the deity.
[01:26:49.365 --> 01:26:49.785]  Perhaps.
[01:26:50.185 --> 01:26:51.846]  That's why it's on top, but go ahead.
[01:26:52.166 --> 01:27:01.390]  Right, and so in the course of a day, the sun, symbolically speaking, of course, because we're speaking about the symbolism of a temple,
[01:27:02.152 --> 01:27:05.215]  He gave power to powerful.
[01:27:28.626 --> 01:27:39.713]  Powerful, powerful, power to obelisks, power to representations of the deity, and what I found was quite remarkable... He basically possessed through these.
[01:27:40.834 --> 01:27:47.338]  Well, you know, that could be... Things were christened or born again.
[01:27:48.399 --> 01:27:53.882]  Okay, the idea in the mind of the ancient Egyptian is that
[01:27:54.744 --> 01:27:57.526]  The heavenly orb, the sun, gave power.
[01:27:57.766 --> 01:28:00.028]  It actually imbued things with power.
[01:28:00.468 --> 01:28:07.473]  And in temple construction, the things that were endowed with power were the icons that warded off evil.
[01:28:07.573 --> 01:28:08.593]  Protective icons.
[01:28:08.713 --> 01:28:11.055]  Now we've got a break, but when we come back I want to get more into this.
[01:28:11.115 --> 01:28:11.255]  Right.
[01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:12.436]  But I want you to think about this.
[01:28:12.896 --> 01:28:18.159]  Are you aware that Francois Mitterrand's glass pyramid that he... At the Louvre?
[01:28:18.179 --> 01:28:20.261]  Yes, outside the Louvre, is 666 pieces of gold glass.
[01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:28.624]  Oh, I can one-up you with the 666, which happens to occur in this building.
[01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:37.532]  Of course it does, but, it does here in Austin as well, but, and then within it, we have the 666 dimensions of a black pyramid beneath it.
[01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:41.495]  Stay there, we'll hear about 666, the number of the beast.
[01:28:43.657 --> 01:28:46.680]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.263]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.555 --> 01:29:01.060]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:05.705]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:05.945 --> 01:29:12.992]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.352 --> 01:29:19.458]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.618 --> 01:29:20.819]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.139 --> 01:29:24.103]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.263 --> 01:29:26.245]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:26.586 --> 01:29:33.834]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:29:56.269 --> 01:30:01.192]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.452 --> 01:30:05.814]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.196]  You'll find this number everywhere.
[01:32:32.517 --> 01:32:35.897]  Our new buildings here in Austin, three six-story buildings, but that's not enough.
[01:32:36.497 --> 01:32:39.658]  Occult icons all over the building and they had a witch coronated.
[01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:41.513]  Chris in it.
[01:32:42.013 --> 01:32:44.434]  This is serious business, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:44.454 --> 01:33:01.041]  We're talking to research fellow at the University of Winnipeg in Canada, who's in the Globe and Mail, CTV, just a whole bunch of other major publications, because he's documented it.
[01:33:01.081 --> 01:33:03.422]  I mean, it's right down to the finest detail.
[01:33:04.062 --> 01:33:07.083]  But tell us about the 666 that you found in the building.
[01:33:07.703 --> 01:33:07.944]  Right.
[01:33:10.174 --> 01:33:23.940]  I know this number certainly wreaks havoc in the imagination of the West because of its reference to the Book of Revelations, as you've noted, although... I know, it's not that bad, but what is their reason for it?
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.781]  It's a friendly thing.
[01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:37.405]  Well, I can't quite comment on that, but I do know that before the reference in Revelation, 666 was the number of the sun,
[01:33:39.474 --> 01:33:53.421]  Because if you add up numbers 1 to 36, those numbers together add to 666, and the sun god is the ruler of the 36 constellations, and these were worn as talismans by ancient priests and whatnot.
[01:33:53.901 --> 01:34:01.925]  But, so, my reference to the 666 in the building corresponds to the incorporation of the sun once again.
[01:34:02.005 --> 01:34:07.968]  So, in the first room, major room, the grand staircase hall in this building,
[01:34:09.563 --> 01:34:11.485]  Arguably the most impressive in Canada.
[01:34:11.825 --> 01:34:12.866]  It's floor plan.
[01:34:13.146 --> 01:34:19.192]  It's actual floor plan is 66.6 feet square.
[01:34:20.513 --> 01:34:25.518]  Now I found that remarkable not only because the sphinx inscription is directly above that room.
[01:34:25.558 --> 01:34:29.382]  By the way, so is the Austin City Council building.
[01:34:29.402 --> 01:34:30.683]  Would you like to come down here and see it?
[01:34:31.063 --> 01:34:33.546]  Well, I would require that invitation.
[01:34:34.508 --> 01:34:36.758]  We might have to have you come down, but please continue.
[01:34:41.005 --> 01:34:47.290]  This particular room, which in ancient temple lore, typically warded off evil.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:53.415]  The idea of the temple was that you used, so to speak, evil to ward off evil.
[01:34:53.775 --> 01:34:58.359]  And that's why there's busts of Medusa, cattle skulls, and two large bodies.
[01:34:58.599 --> 01:35:01.281]  And Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan called that black magic.
[01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:02.282]  That's black magic.
[01:35:02.882 --> 01:35:03.863]  Using evil.
[01:35:04.463 --> 01:35:05.604]  Using evil spirits.
[01:35:05.744 --> 01:35:09.968]  Using evil force to do good or to empower yourself.
[01:35:10.488 --> 01:35:21.913]  Well, a hermeticist, I'm afraid, would part waters with you and talk about the tradition of temple construction from the earliest point of time.
[01:35:22.013 --> 01:35:23.214]  I understand, but you studied this.
[01:35:23.234 --> 01:35:24.434]  Let me just be point blank with you.
[01:35:24.494 --> 01:35:25.955]  Are you a believer in this yourself?
[01:35:26.975 --> 01:35:27.195]  No.
[01:35:27.796 --> 01:35:33.378]  What I understand is, and just simply as an academic measure, is that people did.
[01:35:34.248 --> 01:35:37.190]  So, are you an atheist, a Christian, an agnostic?
[01:35:37.570 --> 01:35:38.211]  No, no, no.
[01:35:38.871 --> 01:35:41.353]  I'm certainly a devout religious person.
[01:35:41.373 --> 01:35:57.684]  I'm Christian, in fact, but my discussions of this building were noting how the level of detail, not only for an ancient architect, that this particular architect would have known
[01:35:58.626 --> 01:36:09.478]  The conventions of an ancient architect, but there were things that I couldn't explain, such as the Sphinx inscription, the Holy of Holies room, the Ark, and this 666 incorporation.
[01:36:09.638 --> 01:36:21.430]  I cannot explain that as an ancient historian, but where I can explain it is in the ideology of masons and those who deem architecture to actually have
[01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:25.282]  A profound power, a talismanic power.
[01:36:25.702 --> 01:36:26.923]  Oh no, that's what they believe.
[01:36:26.983 --> 01:36:32.025]  Listen, we have the Frost Bank building here in Austin that they just completed.
[01:36:32.746 --> 01:36:34.727]  And we've even talked to the architect.
[01:36:34.767 --> 01:36:38.008]  They admit it looks like a giant owl.
[01:36:38.488 --> 01:36:41.350]  It has giant eyes looking east and west.
[01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:49.194]  And I'm sure you know about owls and their talisman type power in their lore.
[01:36:50.257 --> 01:36:50.537]  Right.
[01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:59.787]  Well, my understanding of the symbol of the owl only connects it to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, because the owl is all-seeing and whatnot.
[01:36:59.907 --> 01:37:01.149]  Well, the Egyptians had the god.
[01:37:01.169 --> 01:37:07.215]  It was seen as a harbinger of destruction and power and, as you said earlier, empowerment.
[01:37:08.021 --> 01:37:08.321]  Right.
[01:37:08.801 --> 01:37:18.563]  So, in the case of this one room, the 666 is at least as I understand it.
[01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:19.563]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:37:19.603 --> 01:37:21.404]  Have you seen the movie, The Chronicles of Riddick?
[01:37:22.004 --> 01:37:22.224]  No.
[01:37:22.844 --> 01:37:26.045]  I'm afraid I spent too much time in the library, Alex.
[01:37:26.225 --> 01:37:27.345]  Well, no, I was going to say this.
[01:37:27.405 --> 01:37:28.445]  I don't see a lot of movies either.
[01:37:28.485 --> 01:37:33.466]  But the point is, in this movie, the evil group that takes over your planet
[01:37:34.276 --> 01:37:36.345]  I'm using this as an analogy, folks.
[01:37:36.827 --> 01:37:39.057]  Drops their big icons in the city.
[01:37:40.211 --> 01:37:41.572]  You know, these big towers.
[01:37:42.352 --> 01:37:48.736]  And so I use that as an example for those that watch popular culture for what this owl is in downtown Austin.
[01:37:48.756 --> 01:37:49.136]  Go ahead.
[01:37:49.356 --> 01:37:49.576]  Right.
[01:37:49.956 --> 01:37:57.521]  Well, you know, I think people are divided on the idea of secret society.
[01:37:57.581 --> 01:38:05.545]  Some seeing them as a, you know, a cabal controlling all forms of government and in lieu of a one world order.
[01:38:06.033 --> 01:38:22.659]  And then there is the idea, at least as a historian, as I pursued it, is that notions of philosophical occultism, from Gnosticism right to Hermeticism in the Renaissance, went underground and emerged in secret societies in the 16th century.
[01:38:22.999 --> 01:38:24.219]  Well, let me try to boil this down.
[01:38:24.679 --> 01:38:27.360]  When they're not in power, they're revolutionaries.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.021]  When they're in power, they're absolute despots.
[01:38:31.482 --> 01:38:32.342]  And really it's just
[01:38:32.902 --> 01:38:40.324]  Today, we see modern intelligence agencies, secret operations, pyramidal power structure, through compartmentalization.
[01:38:40.724 --> 01:38:46.886]  Today, what we call intelligence agencies are set up along the old secret society models.
[01:38:46.946 --> 01:38:51.187]  They've just removed the religion from it, at least on the surface.
[01:38:51.547 --> 01:38:54.588]  Then you go to these buildings, there's occult stuff all over the place there as well.
[01:38:55.288 --> 01:38:55.548]  Right.
[01:38:56.828 --> 01:38:59.449]  So far, my experience, at least from the
[01:39:00.553 --> 01:39:18.868]  The government, the premier, the ministers of Manitoba have been quite favourable, not simply on the press, but I think that I've well established myself, even in the face of academic critics,
[01:39:19.361 --> 01:39:24.445]  That there is something going on here which cannot be explained simply as a classical structure.
[01:39:24.485 --> 01:39:30.851]  We've never talked before, you came on the air, but you came right out and said basically hidden in plain view and that's what I've written about and talked about.
[01:39:31.111 --> 01:39:43.722]  That's also part of their religion, not just these buildings as talismans or as power bases like the pyramids or these obelisks like we have in DC, the Washington Monument, the Texas Monument, but also
[01:39:44.898 --> 01:39:46.360]  It is a religious right!
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.801]  I mean, they worship these things!
[01:39:48.242 --> 01:39:55.669]  Well, you know, it's funny that you should mention obelisks, because in the original plans of this building, were flanked by two obelisks.
[01:39:55.869 --> 01:40:04.078]  And you needn't go no further than Heliopolis in ancient Egypt to find that temples were typically flanked by two obelisks.
[01:40:04.138 --> 01:40:07.261]  So these things, for me, were just kind of measures of
[01:40:07.702 --> 01:40:09.584]  The Buildings Incorporation of Ideas.
[01:40:09.664 --> 01:40:14.988]  Now, currently there's no obelisk there, but there is one very hidden, and I've been able to point that out.
[01:40:15.808 --> 01:40:17.470]  Okay, tell us about the hidden obelisk.
[01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:34.003]  Well, it's crowned by a bust of Karche, kind of a political hero of Canada, but its base was designed by the architect, and it follows the kind of elongated pyramidal form of an obelisk.
[01:40:34.023 --> 01:40:36.384]  Oh yeah, they stick a head up on top of an obelisk.
[01:40:36.485 --> 01:40:37.005]  Right, right.
[01:40:37.525 --> 01:40:42.288]  And, you know, the other thing is, is that in... Well, you've been to graveyards and seen all the obelisks.
[01:40:42.308 --> 01:40:42.948]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:43.128 --> 01:40:43.948]  Of the masons, yeah.
[01:40:44.449 --> 01:41:01.717]  Now, in the center of this building is, and typically for a temple is where, you know, the sacrifice altar would be, and I've made measurements that corresponded this particular, the obelisk right there, to altars of ancient temples.
[01:41:02.136 --> 01:41:26.333]  But what you find here, which is really unique, another hidden thing in Plainview, which is entirely Christian, is the Great War mural in the building, which, you know, at first glance it just appears to be military figures dressed in their regalia, but what you can see is an image of the Virgin holding the beloved child, and also
[01:41:27.173 --> 01:41:29.195]  Uh, a figure, uh, like Jesus.
[01:41:29.435 --> 01:41:29.855]  Clearly!
[01:41:30.035 --> 01:41:38.621]  I mean, this is, uh, once I point this out, it's kind of like putting on those 3D goggles where the image is suddenly, you know, brought into view once you, you put on the goggles.
[01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:42.323]  The, the goggles that I've asked historians to look at, art historians, are
[01:41:42.873 --> 01:41:45.154]  The figure in the center is Jesus.
[01:41:45.174 --> 01:41:48.435]  He's being helped along by figures bearing the cross.
[01:41:49.015 --> 01:42:00.258]  And you know, just these planted seeds suddenly awaken this mural to the idea that it's a representation of Jesus.
[01:42:00.318 --> 01:42:03.179]  And Jesus would be perfect for this building because Jesus represents
[01:42:03.579 --> 01:42:06.341]  The ultimate sacrifice in the Western tradition.
[01:42:06.601 --> 01:42:10.283]  And there are other ideas to Jesus being referenced in this room.
[01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:17.788]  So in the middle of this occult compound, we've got a hidden image of Christ being sacrificed?
[01:42:18.128 --> 01:42:24.812]  No, well, Christ bearing the cross and being helped, as it's noted in the Gospels.
[01:42:25.353 --> 01:42:27.374]  And that gets into Hiram Abiff.
[01:42:29.494 --> 01:42:31.235]  Well, perhaps you can enlighten me on that.
[01:42:31.255 --> 01:42:33.256]  That's the ritual killing that the Masons do over and over again.
[01:42:33.276 --> 01:42:36.258]  Did you hear about Long Island last year where the Masons blew the guy's head off?
[01:42:48.163 --> 01:42:52.409]  Yeah, during a ritual they accidentally loaded real bullets in it.
[01:42:52.449 --> 01:42:57.515]  They normally just shoot the guns off by their heads and threaten to kill them if they ever let any secrets out.
[01:42:57.555 --> 01:43:03.844]  And it was actually loaded and they blew the guy's head off and oh, the guy got probation and blew his buddy's head off because the top cops are all masons.
[01:43:04.884 --> 01:43:18.627]  Now, if you type in, though, into Google, you will find other cases where Masons accidentally blow heads off, and you'll find the Klan, during rituals that are identical, because it's Masonic, blowing people's heads off.
[01:43:19.367 --> 01:43:19.967]  Were you aware of that?
[01:43:20.367 --> 01:43:20.807]  No, no, no.
[01:43:20.847 --> 01:43:27.269]  I can't comment on that, but I can comment on a metaphor... But nobody ever gets in trouble.
[01:43:27.329 --> 01:43:28.189]  It's always accidental.
[01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.509]  Go ahead.
[01:43:28.689 --> 01:43:29.209]  Right, right.
[01:43:29.249 --> 01:43:33.350]  What I can comment on in the building...
[01:43:34.009 --> 01:43:44.259]  Uh, at least in this particular room that I just noted, uh, the rotunda, the center of the building, uh, that there is a metaphor to, uh, the entered apprentice rite.
[01:43:44.479 --> 01:43:51.767]  And during this rite, what happens is the initiate is asked by the master, what are the three ornaments of the temple?
[01:43:52.367 --> 01:43:55.090]  And the response is a blazing star in the center.
[01:43:55.828 --> 01:43:56.429]  I don't know.
[01:44:06.566 --> 01:44:13.790]  The idea is that a mosaic pavement is just black and white squares, and the tassel is just an ornamented border.
[01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:20.694]  Now, this room has a blazing star in the center, a black eight-pointed star, surrounded by each of these things.
[01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:25.736]  Is this a reference to this particular rite, which talks about the center of the temple?
[01:44:26.257 --> 01:44:26.737]  Perhaps.
[01:44:26.917 --> 01:44:34.601]  And what, at least for me, makes that measure even more compelling is that we do have one eight-pointed star that I know of
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:40.504]  Uh, in a legislature, a capital building, as you would call it, in the U.S.
[01:44:40.744 --> 01:44:46.169]  This is like walking into a Chuck E. Cheese pizza place and saying, is this a pizza place?
[01:44:46.929 --> 01:44:50.432]  I mean, it's like walking into the Capitol and saying, is this a Capitol?
[01:44:51.353 --> 01:44:54.015]  I mean, you're like going, is this, is this, is this?
[01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:58.959]  I mean, you knew about Francois Mitterrand, obsessed with Egyptology, obsessed with the occult.
[01:44:59.299 --> 01:45:13.131]  His life work was where these 666 pieces of gold glass, then beneath it, you have an inverted black pyramid that hangs down out of the ceiling, into the Louvre, and then its exact measurements come out to 666.
[01:45:13.291 --> 01:45:15.053]  I mean, come on!
[01:45:15.413 --> 01:45:27.277]  Well, I appreciate your fervor and enthusiasm to a high measure, but you must understand I'm having to convince people that strain on a gnat.
[01:45:27.557 --> 01:45:36.600]  Each element I have to delicately tease out in order to establish... Well, when I leave the studio today and I get in my car, I'm going to go, this is a car.
[01:45:37.375 --> 01:45:38.575]  No, I know it's a car.
[01:45:38.935 --> 01:45:41.376]  Got lights, got a steering wheel, got an engine, it's a car.
[01:45:41.856 --> 01:45:42.076]  Right.
[01:45:43.056 --> 01:45:45.657]  But again, you talk about this hidden in plain view, it's all over the place.
[01:45:45.697 --> 01:45:48.738]  You want to hear the speeches that Bush and others give.
[01:45:49.758 --> 01:46:00.781]  All the time, during his State of the Union, during his swearing in, all of this stuff, he's dropping Masonic phrases.
[01:46:02.344 --> 01:46:07.711]  Well, you know, my interpretation of this building is that it's beautiful.
[01:46:07.991 --> 01:46:09.593]  It's stunningly beautiful.
[01:46:09.733 --> 01:46:11.556]  It follows ancient plans.
[01:46:11.936 --> 01:46:21.248]  It has this incorporation of high-level motifs that are hidden, and then once exposed, a certain other dimension of its sophistication comes out.
[01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:33.950]  But I just wanted to finish with the eight-pointed star, and this is something that hasn't been published or looked at, and trust me, it's given some level of, you know, I even hate to say trust me, because then people say, oh, then I shouldn't trust you.
[01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:36.291]  What are you talking about?
[01:46:36.631 --> 01:46:50.753]  Well, you can go to your own state capitol in Minnesota, which has an eight-pointed star in the center, and what they won't explain to you at the Minnesota Historical Society, or the woman who did a dissertation on the building,
[01:46:51.209 --> 01:47:08.313]  Is that a strange right happens there, the so-called laying in state right, where former governors, vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey, John Johnson, Frank Kellogg, senators who have had this opportunity to lie in state on this eight-pointed star for a public ceremony.
[01:47:08.695 --> 01:47:11.959]  Now, what no one's been able to explain is that they're all Masons.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.762]  You didn't know Ronald Reagan did that?
[01:47:14.202 --> 01:47:19.329]  Yeah, but Ronald Reagan did that in Washington, not in the Minnesota State Capitol, which hasn't even started.
[01:47:19.349 --> 01:47:20.811]  Finish what you just said about the Masons.
[01:47:20.891 --> 01:47:21.592]  I talked over you.
[01:47:21.932 --> 01:47:27.079]  Sorry, in this particular building, which has the closest association with
[01:47:27.538 --> 01:47:46.859]  The building in Canada, the one in Minnesota, built in the same style, Beaux-Arts, Neoclassical, with an eight-pointed star in its rotunda, has this particular right that no one knows why these people are selected, and it was later confirmed to me when I had an opportunity to give a tour to all the highest-level masons in the country,
[01:47:47.279 --> 01:47:50.741]  In Canada, of the building, I gave a tour to them last year.
[01:47:51.061 --> 01:48:03.367]  I said, you know, I found it interesting that there were all these figures that had this opportunity to engage in this right in the Minnesota State Capitol, but no one's been able to explain to me why it occurs and why these people get selected.
[01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:14.569]  I received an email about two weeks later from one of the attendees, I believe it was a Grand Master from one of the provinces, who confirmed that each of those members, each of those names, were Masons.
[01:48:14.649 --> 01:48:16.150]  Now to me this raises eyebrows.
[01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:18.572]  I don't know if there's any right... Let me stop you.
[01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:21.253]  ...and I'm almost sure that they're not happening in Manitoba.
[01:48:22.754 --> 01:48:24.275]  Frank, it's almost as if you read my mind.
[01:48:24.335 --> 01:48:31.279]  I was going to say, in these buildings where they have these temple chambers, the whole building's a temple obviously, but the inner chambers,
[01:48:31.989 --> 01:48:38.491]  I was going to say, on certain Masonic dates and at funerals and other things, go to those places and you will see rituals going on.
[01:48:39.611 --> 01:48:39.851]  Right.
[01:48:40.872 --> 01:48:41.912]  Right out in plain view!
[01:48:41.932 --> 01:48:44.693]  No volunteers being led by.
[01:48:45.293 --> 01:48:51.154]  I can't comment on that, Alex, and perhaps you could send me some literature that could, you know, help explain this.
[01:48:51.194 --> 01:48:55.095]  I'll tell you what, give out your email and you'll get a lot of garbage, you'll get a lot of real stuff too.
[01:48:55.155 --> 01:48:56.196]  Our listeners are experts.
[01:48:56.576 --> 01:48:57.616]  Why don't you give your email out?
[01:48:58.616 --> 01:48:59.637]  It's Frank Albo.
[01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:05.273]  F-R-A-N-K-A-L-B-O-At-Rogers.com.
[01:49:05.313 --> 01:49:09.777]  That's R-O-G-E-R-S.com.
[01:49:10.137 --> 01:49:12.219]  It's FrankAlboAtRogers.com?
[01:49:12.499 --> 01:49:12.819]  Correct.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.001]  FrankAlboAtRogers.com.
[01:49:15.021 --> 01:49:18.784]  You got any websites or anything at the university where you've posted any of your findings?
[01:49:18.924 --> 01:49:26.510]  Well, what I'm in the process of negotiating with the minister in Canada is
[01:49:27.009 --> 01:49:32.672]  To build a website that would highlight these features and so that it's open for speculation.
[01:49:34.052 --> 01:49:36.073]  All right, and the Masons are helping you.
[01:49:36.113 --> 01:49:40.375]  They're happy because they believe the new age is here and it's time to reveal themselves.
[01:49:41.336 --> 01:49:43.336]  We're going to come back and start taking your calls.
[01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:45.758]  Our guests will be with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:49:45.778 --> 01:49:48.899]  Then I got a bunch of other world news we'll be covering.
[01:49:53.382 --> 01:49:57.727]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.927 --> 01:50:02.333]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.493 --> 01:50:06.858]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.898 --> 01:50:08.260]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.051 --> 01:50:09.952]  Panama.
[01:50:10.032 --> 01:50:14.256]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.316 --> 01:50:21.263]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.383 --> 01:50:23.465]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.745 --> 01:50:34.095]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:39.760]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:42.883]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:42.903 --> 01:50:43.463]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:44.024]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.044 --> 01:50:45.325]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:50:53.507 --> 01:50:56.531]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:56.852 --> 01:51:05.684]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.004 --> 01:51:10.691]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:17.853]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.253 --> 01:51:30.056]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.516 --> 01:51:34.979]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.139 --> 01:51:37.601]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:42.223 --> 01:51:43.284]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:53.848 --> 01:51:54.348]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.273 --> 01:52:09.874]  I think so.
[01:52:31.827 --> 01:52:33.908]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[01:52:34.088 --> 01:52:38.531]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[01:52:38.751 --> 01:52:41.833]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:41.993 --> 01:52:47.936]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.823]  The groups we're talking about are the people bringing you world government.
[01:53:00.959 --> 01:53:07.623]  And the lower steps of the pyramid, their members believe they're helping society out and trying to uplift mankind.
[01:53:07.663 --> 01:53:08.384]  But I've studied them.
[01:53:08.444 --> 01:53:09.644]  I've snuck into their rituals.
[01:53:11.005 --> 01:53:13.487]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove in July of 2000.
[01:53:13.607 --> 01:53:14.948]  It's been in major publications.
[01:53:14.968 --> 01:53:15.988]  They admit I snuck in.
[01:53:16.028 --> 01:53:22.472]  Got the first and only video of the ritual as they worship Moloch, the Canaanite deity that children were sacrificed to.
[01:53:22.512 --> 01:53:28.216]  They bring in a mock effigy of a baby, a child, and burn it in front of Moloch.
[01:53:28.416 --> 01:53:28.916]  It's sick.
[01:53:29.545 --> 01:53:37.550]  And you can see the video of that ritual and our infiltration and the British media covering our infiltration in my film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:53:37.590 --> 01:53:38.490]  It's two hours long.
[01:53:39.811 --> 01:53:48.156]  In the five hour special that was on the TRIO Network using my footage, they only used about ten minutes of the ritual and then just basically made excuses for the rest of it.
[01:53:49.056 --> 01:53:54.820]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and order Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:53:55.544 --> 01:54:02.126]  Or call toll free to get a copy of the film, or any of the films I've produced, at 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:54:03.586 --> 01:54:10.528]  Now understand, they don't think they're worshipping the devil!
[01:54:12.028 --> 01:54:18.210]  They think that the devil is God, and that Christians are just mistaken about all this, that the devil is
[01:54:19.048 --> 01:54:29.735]  God, and the devil is just how we see the manifestation of the destructive side of the architect, the grand architect, as they call them.
[01:54:31.396 --> 01:54:33.317]  Folks, their fruits are evil.
[01:54:34.137 --> 01:54:35.378]  The Bible is correct.
[01:54:35.438 --> 01:54:36.859]  It lays out who we're dealing with.
[01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:47.010]  And it's serious, so I hope you'll get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove to find out just how out of control these people are.
[01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.510]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:48.591 --> 01:54:59.439]  I know Ron and Steven and Tom and Bart and a bunch of other people have been holding for eons, and you've probably been holding since before the guests got on, so there's a bunch of different issues you probably want to talk about.
[01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:02.141]  I want to get more into the occult
[01:55:03.261 --> 01:55:12.224]  Language hidden in plain view in the next hour with you, again, Frank Albo, who's a research fellow at the University of Winnipeg in Canada.
[01:55:12.604 --> 01:55:16.085]  But right now, let's go to the calls for our guest.
[01:55:16.525 --> 01:55:19.686]  Let's talk to Ron in Indiana.
[01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:20.406]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:55:20.426 --> 01:55:21.086]  You're on the air.
[01:55:21.767 --> 01:55:22.167]  Thank you.
[01:55:22.227 --> 01:55:23.227]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:55:23.607 --> 01:55:23.967]  You bet.
[01:55:24.147 --> 01:55:29.809]  I have a question about, it's not quite what you're talking about, but building number seven.
[01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:30.832]  They
[01:55:44.591 --> 01:55:45.211]  Demolished.
[01:55:45.431 --> 01:55:47.773]  You know, they have to have paperwork.
[01:55:47.913 --> 01:55:50.154]  The cameras are there to take pictures and all that.
[01:55:50.474 --> 01:55:51.054]  What happened?
[01:55:51.174 --> 01:55:54.516]  And why didn't they tell from what I heard of the people inside?
[01:55:55.096 --> 01:55:59.598]  They didn't know it was going to be demolished.
[01:55:59.739 --> 01:56:01.259]  This is hidden in plain view again.
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:05.321]  Larry Silverstein goes on PBS and says we blew up Building 7.
[01:56:06.122 --> 01:56:08.523]  The official government report is they don't know why it fell.
[01:56:09.461 --> 01:56:11.723]  And, uh, there was only one person that died in Building 7.
[01:56:11.984 --> 01:56:15.066]  They were warned, they did evacuate, and then they blew the building up.
[01:56:15.467 --> 01:56:19.430]  But they weren't warned, I mean... They were warned, yes they were.
[01:56:21.352 --> 01:56:22.753]  Like two days before?
[01:56:23.114 --> 01:56:25.916]  Oh no, obviously the explosives were put in weeks before.
[01:56:26.257 --> 01:56:30.841]  Right, but I mean, if they were actually going to pull the building, this would have had
[01:56:33.606 --> 01:56:36.867]  They claim fire brought down Building 7.
[01:56:37.007 --> 01:56:38.767]  And they go, well, we're not quite sure.
[01:56:39.127 --> 01:56:43.289]  Well, why didn't the building in Madrid that burned ten times as hot and for two days fall?
[01:56:43.649 --> 01:56:45.169]  No steel building had ever collapsed.
[01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:46.670]  But look, all that's academic.
[01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:48.130]  They admit they blew it up.
[01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:50.711]  The firefighters told AP reporters to get back.
[01:56:50.731 --> 01:56:51.631]  We're going to bring it down.
[01:56:52.412 --> 01:56:53.092]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:53.152 --> 01:56:53.912]  Really good points.
[01:56:54.272 --> 01:56:55.553]  Any comments to what he was saying?
[01:56:56.113 --> 01:56:56.553]  Frank?
[01:56:56.733 --> 01:56:59.854]  No, I'm afraid I have nothing to add.
[01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.911]  All right.
[01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:02.031]  Yeah, I apologize.
[01:57:02.051 --> 01:57:04.313]  We had callers holding from beforehand and I'm going to go to them.
[01:57:04.633 --> 01:57:06.355]  Hopefully they'll bring a point up to you.
[01:57:06.375 --> 01:57:10.038]  We've got to clear these lines out so we can get the folks that actually want to talk to you.
[01:57:10.778 --> 01:57:18.504]  Here in about 70 seconds, we'll be back with the third hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[01:57:19.765 --> 01:57:24.629]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're honored to be joined by this great academic researcher,
[01:57:25.419 --> 01:57:30.382]  A research fellow there at the University of Winnipeg in Canada, Frank Albo.
[01:57:31.042 --> 01:57:32.103]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:57:32.123 --> 01:57:36.885]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:37.445 --> 01:57:38.726]  Hour 3, straight ahead.
[01:57:40.187 --> 01:57:40.967]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.974 --> 01:57:52.014]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.734 --> 01:57:53.815]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.495 --> 01:57:55.355]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.075 --> 01:57:56.995]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.015 --> 01:58:01.536]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.816 --> 01:58:05.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.677 --> 01:58:16.819]  All right, my friends, listening across the country, worldwide, and all the ships at sea, we're now into hour number three of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:18.064 --> 01:58:21.545]  Hopefully enlightening you, getting you to wake up to the real world all around you.
[01:58:23.066 --> 01:58:26.487]  A false paradigm has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[01:58:27.107 --> 01:58:31.408]  We're talking to Frank Albo, and he is a research fellow at the University of Winnipeg.
[01:58:31.989 --> 01:58:36.010]  He's made major headlines, I mean, in just a whole bunch of major newspapers.
[01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:39.191]  He sees hidden signs, occult clues at legislature.
[01:58:39.671 --> 01:58:40.832]  This is out of the Winnipeg Sun.
[01:58:40.872 --> 01:58:42.212]  Here's another one out of Globe and Mail.
[01:58:42.832 --> 01:58:45.033]  A building of secret encoded clues.
[01:58:45.991 --> 01:58:48.512]  And the masons and everybody basically admit this.
[01:58:48.612 --> 01:58:53.015]  And it's got the 666 and it's dimensions, it's got all of it there.
[01:58:53.615 --> 01:58:55.876]  Just like our Austin's new city council buildings.
[01:58:56.896 --> 01:59:00.438]  The three six story buildings and inside all the occult garbage.
[01:59:01.919 --> 01:59:05.921]  The reason this is important is that it shows you the driving ideology.
[01:59:07.203 --> 01:59:09.004]  And philosophy of the elite.
[01:59:09.524 --> 01:59:21.009]  I want to go over a bunch of other examples of things hidden in plain view and how they imprint and communicate with themselves and our subconscious with numerology and key dates and things.
[01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:24.191]  Again, we are talking to the research fellow.
[01:59:24.711 --> 01:59:26.251]  Let's go right back to the calls.
[01:59:26.311 --> 01:59:30.733]  Let's talk to... Who's up first from Buffalo?
[01:59:32.554 --> 01:59:34.555]  Lucia in Buffalo, you're on the air.
[01:59:34.595 --> 01:59:35.055]  Go ahead.
[01:59:35.075 --> 01:59:35.636]  Hi.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.221]  Hi, Mr. Elbow.
[01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:40.043]  I must congratulate you on your work.
[01:59:40.083 --> 01:59:40.843]  It's marvelous.
[01:59:41.664 --> 01:59:48.490]  I did, I have been doing for 26 years, research in what lies beneath these buildings.
[01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:51.513]  You've got half of the story.
[01:59:52.013 --> 01:59:55.776]  The other half is what lies in the ground, under the ground.
[01:59:55.916 --> 01:59:56.837]  Yeah, the tunnels.
[01:59:57.598 --> 01:59:58.919]  No, no, no.
[01:59:59.539 --> 02:00:03.283]  I have, I'm a geomancer, a master geomancer.
[02:00:05.768 --> 02:00:10.298]  Investigating one of the Masonic Very High Seekers called the Geodetic Code.
[02:00:12.062 --> 02:00:14.729]  It consists of water and aquastat.
[02:00:15.566 --> 02:00:19.388]  Well, they do believe that there are certain areas that have a magical frequency.
[02:00:19.508 --> 02:00:21.448]  No, there's no certain areas.
[02:00:21.468 --> 02:00:22.069]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:00:22.269 --> 02:00:23.189]  I don't believe in that stuff.
[02:00:23.689 --> 02:00:25.550]  I'm not talking about what you believe.
[02:00:25.610 --> 02:00:27.391]  I'm talking about what is there.
[02:00:27.691 --> 02:00:31.332]  Okay, well, let me get my guest to comment on it.
[02:00:31.792 --> 02:00:33.373]  Well, I haven't said anything yet.
[02:00:33.413 --> 02:00:33.873]  Well, hold on.
[02:00:33.913 --> 02:00:35.354]  I'm going to let him comment on what you just said.
[02:00:37.015 --> 02:00:43.482]  Well, with regards to, are you speaking of perhaps latent earth energies?
[02:00:43.622 --> 02:00:49.208]  Yes, I'm talking about the teluric feminine earth current, which is, I have doubts.
[02:00:50.049 --> 02:00:55.475]  Basilicas, cathedrals, lady chapels, any kind of church you want to talk about, I have doubts
[02:00:56.033 --> 02:00:57.294]  Our City Hall here in Buffalo.
[02:00:57.415 --> 02:01:08.666]  Incidentally, Buffalo is considered and is known to be a sister city to Washington because our City Hall is placed in exactly the same kind of geodetic setup.
[02:01:09.136 --> 02:01:10.177]  That Washington has.
[02:01:10.397 --> 02:01:11.798]  Well, they also build temples.
[02:01:11.878 --> 02:01:12.758]  Let me just add something.
[02:01:12.778 --> 02:01:16.000]  They also build temples on key meridian lines and things.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.342]  All I'm saying is, I think dowsing is magic.
[02:01:19.962 --> 02:01:21.243]  I think it's magical thinking.
[02:01:21.283 --> 02:01:22.824]  And I can disagree with you if I want to.
[02:01:22.864 --> 02:01:23.565]  Aren't I allowed to?
[02:01:23.885 --> 02:01:27.047]  And you're very welcome to, but... I'm not saying that they don't believe this.
[02:01:27.127 --> 02:01:27.867]  I know they believe it.
[02:01:28.367 --> 02:01:29.028]  Well, it's true.
[02:01:29.748 --> 02:01:33.190]  I have never found a shared data code to be violated.
[02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:35.912]  There are some 30 appointments that must exist.
[02:01:36.477 --> 02:01:49.661]  Under any religious building, or palace, or city hall, that must be complied with in the architectural appointment of this city hall or this capitol building.
[02:01:49.901 --> 02:01:54.662]  I'll hold you up if need be, but Frank, have you run into this yourself?
[02:01:55.523 --> 02:01:59.244]  No, of course this is another topic that
[02:01:59.987 --> 02:02:06.275]  Uh, makes people in my field somewhat cringe, the idea of ley lines and meridian points and whatnot.
[02:02:06.355 --> 02:02:16.509]  But what I do think is undoubtedly something to look at in this particular building is that if you look on the map,
[02:02:17.145 --> 02:02:18.986]  And this is just outrageous.
[02:02:19.046 --> 02:02:26.188]  If you look at them on the map, Winnipeg is the near latitudinal, longitudinal center of the continent.
[02:02:26.308 --> 02:02:27.809]  Like, it's clear as day.
[02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:42.314]  And so if you were, you know, following this idea, this ideology, whether it's present or not, then it seems that this would be an ideal location for a centrifugal type of talismanic energy.
[02:02:42.454 --> 02:02:42.954]  We'll be back!
[02:02:45.146 --> 02:02:52.011]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.311 --> 02:02:53.672]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:53.873 --> 02:02:56.094]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.234 --> 02:02:58.316]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.596 --> 02:03:03.520]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:07.903]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.143 --> 02:03:09.924]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.004 --> 02:03:20.648]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.788 --> 02:03:22.689]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:22.889 --> 02:03:26.770]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[02:03:26.850 --> 02:03:28.131]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:03:31.872 --> 02:03:34.174]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:03:39.218 --> 02:03:39.919]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:03:44.446 --> 02:03:45.226]  Terrorism!
[02:03:45.366 --> 02:03:46.127]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.227 --> 02:03:52.289]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:54.130]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:56.871]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:57.251 --> 02:04:11.817]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:11.857 --> 02:04:12.157]  government.
[02:04:12.337 --> 02:04:14.158]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:14.518 --> 02:04:20.441]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:20.581 --> 02:04:25.084]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:32.107 --> 02:04:32.447]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.687 --> 02:04:34.388]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:43.723 --> 02:04:48.366]  Well, using CollagenAid, my cholesterol went from 206 to 133 in two months.
[02:04:49.406 --> 02:04:58.332]  Lowering his cholesterol numbers is just one benefit Bill experienced when he lost weight the safe and healthy way with CollagenAid by Vim and Vigor.
[02:04:58.512 --> 02:04:59.812]  And also, I've got bad knees.
[02:04:59.912 --> 02:05:04.095]  Doctors told me that I should really have surgery and I do a lot of hiking.
[02:05:04.495 --> 02:05:07.819]  And since I've been taking CollagenAid, the knees really improved.
[02:05:07.919 --> 02:05:08.801]  They don't hurt at all.
[02:05:08.841 --> 02:05:10.843]  I don't have to worry about them aching after a hike.
[02:05:10.983 --> 02:05:12.745]  I don't think I'm going to have to have surgery here.
[02:05:13.006 --> 02:05:14.047]  I'm happy about that.
[02:05:14.307 --> 02:05:19.894]  With CollagenAid from Vim and Vigor, I've lost 20 pounds and my cholesterol went from 206 to 131.
[02:05:20.134 --> 02:05:20.875]  My body fat's down by 10%.
[02:05:24.159 --> 02:05:25.980]  And that's been in two months, and I feel great.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:30.102]  Lose weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:30.582]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:05:30.602 --> 02:05:30.762]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:05:30.822 --> 02:05:31.843]  Get $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:05:31.863 --> 02:05:32.283]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:05:32.303 --> 02:05:32.563]  1-800-622-8446.
[02:05:32.583 --> 02:05:33.664]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:33.684 --> 02:05:35.685]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.757 --> 02:05:59.161]  We're talking about secret societies and their icons all around us.
[02:06:02.343 --> 02:06:07.167]  Capitals, legislative centers, are really temples.
[02:06:07.187 --> 02:06:13.491]  666 shows up from the Austin City Council buildings to the Winnipeg Legislature.
[02:06:14.752 --> 02:06:16.513]  The occult is everywhere.
[02:06:16.814 --> 02:06:20.576]  Again, we talked about the Louvre, that big gold pyramid they built.
[02:06:20.596 --> 02:06:21.157]  666 pieces of glass with
[02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:26.912]  Another black pyramid within it, with its dimensions being 666.
[02:06:28.674 --> 02:06:30.515]  See, I don't believe in all this stuff.
[02:06:30.635 --> 02:06:31.956]  I don't believe in magic.
[02:06:32.137 --> 02:06:36.921]  I don't believe in getting power from it.
[02:06:37.101 --> 02:06:37.681]  I'm a Christian.
[02:06:37.701 --> 02:06:39.683]  I think it's very, very dangerous.
[02:06:39.723 --> 02:06:44.987]  And the people involved in it, the whole culture of it, it's of the New World Order.
[02:06:45.027 --> 02:06:46.088]  It's what they promote and push.
[02:06:46.148 --> 02:06:51.913]  But again, then people come out of the woodwork who believe in all these different types of magic.
[02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:58.271]  And then the academic debate shifts away from it because it has that cloak around it.
[02:06:58.851 --> 02:07:02.052]  What we're saying, what I'm saying, is the elite believe in this.
[02:07:02.832 --> 02:07:04.213]  It's set up all around us.
[02:07:04.293 --> 02:07:05.113]  We need to talk about it.
[02:07:05.413 --> 02:07:12.316]  But we're talking to Lucia in Buffalo, New York, and she was getting into how these buildings are built on these
[02:07:14.497 --> 02:07:15.317]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:07:15.357 --> 02:07:17.758]  The slogan that the High Masons use for this geogenic code is
[02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:47.666]  Darkness brought to light, or darkness made visible.
[02:07:47.746 --> 02:07:49.488]  This is high masonry.
[02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:50.649]  I am a Christian.
[02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.512]  So I, and Mr. Elbow said he is too.
[02:07:54.433 --> 02:07:58.017]  Investigating these things does not make us a purveyor of evil.
[02:07:58.858 --> 02:08:01.381]  We're just trying to bring to light things we need to know.
[02:08:01.401 --> 02:08:03.543]  Well, I'm not saying you're evil.
[02:08:03.683 --> 02:08:04.965]  I'm saying that I don't
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.162]  I mean, they may think certain points are magic and they get power off of them.
[02:08:10.262 --> 02:08:14.364]  Well, what I'm talking about is not magic per se.
[02:08:15.205 --> 02:08:32.353]  Pope Gregory told his missionaries when they went to their far-flung countries to establish a church, he said, first find the pagan sites of worship, the holy places, knock down the building, get rid of it, and then build your church on the same spot.
[02:08:33.333 --> 02:08:34.854]  That's because under the earth,
[02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:36.539]  There is the spiral.
[02:08:37.419 --> 02:08:39.560]  The spiral is on the geometry of the number 7.
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:47.064]  There's always 7 coils, 14 coils, 21 coils, right on up to 49 coils, okay?
[02:08:47.264 --> 02:08:48.205]  There's water lines.
[02:08:48.385 --> 02:08:55.608]  Every altar in every church is nested, must be nested, in a circle or a loop, a spiral of water.
[02:08:56.029 --> 02:09:00.311]  I have done, I have worked for 26 years, I have never seen
[02:09:01.071 --> 02:09:03.753]  Okay, well ma'am, just send me some information on that.
[02:09:03.793 --> 02:09:04.654]  I appreciate the call.
[02:09:04.694 --> 02:09:05.454]  It's very interesting.
[02:09:05.795 --> 02:09:19.525]  We're just talking about how openly they have sphinxes, they have inscriptions and hieroglyphics to the Sun God, it's built to the specifications of Solomon's Temple, and then no one ever talks about it.
[02:09:19.545 --> 02:09:20.425]  We just ignore it.
[02:09:21.646 --> 02:09:22.827]  Frank, any comments?
[02:09:24.148 --> 02:09:26.430]  No, and just to follow up with the caller,
[02:09:27.643 --> 02:09:38.607]  As an intellectual pursuit for myself, I knew nothing about concepts in masonry and secret societies and whatnot.
[02:09:38.967 --> 02:09:44.889]  I mean, I'm left translating biblical Hebrew and cuneiform wedge-shaped texts.
[02:09:45.590 --> 02:10:13.625]  But what I did know is that those ideologies that the ancient architects employed were also employed in this building and that the only other way of explaining all these other motifs that you had correctly noted was only through societies such as Freemasonry or those that endow or believe in buildings having some natural power to exude things.
[02:10:14.828 --> 02:10:17.029]  And that's a whole other level of investigation.
[02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:27.893]  That's why I'm open to discussions and whatnot, because this is still an unfinished work, although I spent four years detailing the smallest measures of the building.
[02:10:28.493 --> 02:10:36.055]  And again, folks, we are talking to a research fellow at the University of Winnipeg in Canada.
[02:10:36.075 --> 02:10:37.696]  We're talking to Frank Albo.
[02:10:38.256 --> 02:10:42.198]  And I'm not trying to be mean or poo-poo what that lady was saying.
[02:10:42.258 --> 02:10:43.298]  What I'm saying is,
[02:10:44.142 --> 02:10:45.423]  I keep it separated.
[02:10:46.163 --> 02:10:51.245]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove where our world leaders, our presidents, worship Moloch.
[02:10:51.905 --> 02:10:56.046]  Now, then people go, but I don't believe in the devil and I don't believe in Moloch, so you're a kook.
[02:10:56.066 --> 02:10:56.846]  And I'm going, wait a minute.
[02:10:57.207 --> 02:10:58.767]  The point is, they do.
[02:10:59.227 --> 02:11:01.008]  They're worshiping it.
[02:11:01.428 --> 02:11:05.269]  This is a big deal, but people almost have blinders because it is the occult.
[02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:06.930]  Then they go, well, that can't be proven.
[02:11:06.970 --> 02:11:09.291]  Well, what can be proven is they believe in it.
[02:11:09.511 --> 02:11:12.512]  What can be proven about skull and bones is it's a temple.
[02:11:13.112 --> 02:11:14.593]  They worship these deities.
[02:11:14.973 --> 02:11:16.034]  They are a death cult.
[02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:17.174]  They get in coffins.
[02:11:17.214 --> 02:11:18.395]  They believe they're born again.
[02:11:18.735 --> 02:11:19.495]  That's admitted.
[02:11:19.815 --> 02:11:21.596]  We're not weird because we talk about it.
[02:11:21.957 --> 02:11:32.502]  I'm not weird because the Austin New City Council is a bronze building with three six-story buildings and they had a Wiccan high priestess consecrated.
[02:11:32.522 --> 02:11:37.584]  You know, I'd be weird if I wasn't pointing this out.
[02:11:39.125 --> 02:11:40.426]  Can I answer that, Alex?
[02:11:40.765 --> 02:11:40.985]  Sure.
[02:11:42.726 --> 02:11:46.048]  In my work so far, I have not been able to identify the they.
[02:11:46.748 --> 02:11:55.493]  The they that may consist of the government have pretty much opened and been very supportive with what I'm doing because it's unmistakable.
[02:11:55.993 --> 02:12:03.037]  And B, the Mason has even allowed me access to archives and correspondences abroad.
[02:12:03.077 --> 02:12:07.079]  I've been able to contact Masonic historians in London and in Paris and whatnot.
[02:12:07.446 --> 02:12:10.971]  Who have been able to furnish information to me that I wouldn't have normally gotten.
[02:12:11.312 --> 02:12:15.177]  And so I can't identify this so-called hidden they yet.
[02:12:15.838 --> 02:12:17.361]  Who do you think built this?
[02:12:20.459 --> 02:12:23.521]  Multi-million dollar, million, million, million dollar structure?
[02:12:23.941 --> 02:12:30.045]  Well, it's currently, the replacement value is at about one billion, and it's certainly irreplaceable.
[02:12:30.065 --> 02:12:39.871]  And the Masonic link, at least as a historian, was that the architect was hired by a subcommittee
[02:12:40.696 --> 02:12:42.957]  Government subcommittee comprised entirely of masons.
[02:12:43.097 --> 02:12:44.377]  Now that is fine.
[02:12:44.737 --> 02:12:48.978]  That is in... Well, again, if we go back to... Explain to them this room with 666.
[02:12:50.119 --> 02:12:53.780]  Well, the room is the Grand Staircase Hall.
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.620]  It's the first major room in the building.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.162]  It's floor plan and right on its architectural drawing, surprisingly, it's written 666.
[02:13:00.342 --> 02:13:04.903]  I mean, I almost dropped off my chair when I saw this because
[02:13:05.339 --> 02:13:11.643]  I did biblical studies and I know what this means at least from a Christian perspective.
[02:13:11.843 --> 02:13:12.423]  Let me stop you.
[02:13:12.463 --> 02:13:21.549]  What do you think of our city council that has 666 in dimensions of some of its big rooms and the three buildings are each six stories tall?
[02:13:22.089 --> 02:13:31.595]  I can't comment on those because the only way I could explain 666 in this building is the housing of symbolically quote-unquote
[02:13:32.052 --> 02:13:32.293]  Of course!
[02:13:47.623 --> 02:13:51.928]  Uh, which I've coined the Holy of Holies, which has an Ark of the Covenant directly above it.
[02:13:52.768 --> 02:13:56.132]  The Holy of Holies was only one of the three coordinates.
[02:13:56.372 --> 02:14:02.318]  I think if you start calculating the building, uh, you're going to find that the numbers continue.
[02:14:02.798 --> 02:14:04.080]  Well, uh, perhaps.
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:08.244]  And, uh, as I said, this is work in progress, and I wasn't expecting that
[02:14:08.944 --> 02:14:11.286]  Uh, the press to make such a media fervor over this.
[02:14:11.306 --> 02:14:23.577]  I was simply giving an academic lecture, and it got picked up by everyone, and I'm still open to those scholars and interpreters who can add to this, because quite frankly, I'm still astonished.
[02:14:23.797 --> 02:14:24.818]  Let me throw something at you.
[02:14:25.238 --> 02:14:33.966]  Al-Qaeda is not into numerology, but did you know, of course you know all of the magical talisman power, I'm sure you've been researching this, of 9-1-1, of 9s and 11s,
[02:14:36.873 --> 02:14:41.599]  Did you know that, of course, in the Masonic rituals they have the two towers on each side of the altar?
[02:14:41.619 --> 02:14:42.941]  You have the two buildings?
[02:14:43.302 --> 02:14:46.446]  The Madrid-Spain bombing was 911 days after 9-11 on 3-11?
[02:14:46.466 --> 02:14:47.187]  Do you mean the two pillars?
[02:14:51.184 --> 02:14:51.524]  Yes.
[02:14:51.664 --> 02:14:52.545]  Yaqen and Boaz?
[02:14:52.845 --> 02:14:53.085]  Yes.
[02:14:53.705 --> 02:14:53.965]  Okay.
[02:14:54.225 --> 02:14:55.246]  And then it continues.
[02:14:55.786 --> 02:15:00.488]  Did you know that on the one year anniversary of 9-11, the New York Lottery came up 9-11?
[02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:05.070]  Did you know that on the one year anniversary of 9-11, the Chicago Mercantile came up 9-11.0000?
[02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.371]  Like one out of 14 billion.
[02:15:09.306 --> 02:15:10.988]  The Chicago Mercantile, oh yes.
[02:15:11.328 --> 02:15:13.570]  And it goes, sir, there are hundreds of these.
[02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:16.412]  They have a rule, they have to hide it and blame you.
[02:15:16.753 --> 02:15:30.105]  Did you know that on the Lone Gunman episode, that was a spinoff of the X-Files, aired months before 9-11, a secret government group hijacks a jumbo jet to fly to the World Trade Center to blame it on foreign enemies and get martial law?
[02:15:30.545 --> 02:15:35.670]  And then I had the star of the X-Files show show up at my door a few months ago with a crew
[02:15:36.534 --> 02:15:37.034]  I have no comment.
[02:15:37.054 --> 02:15:37.854]  I don't know what to add to that.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.125]  Well, numerology is how they communicate.
[02:15:57.906 --> 02:16:02.391]  What most people don't understand is that numerology is about 2,500 years old.
[02:16:02.451 --> 02:16:11.501]  It's the father of a science that began with Pythagoras, that moved out throughout the Platonic tradition, that became a very high art.
[02:16:11.886 --> 02:16:17.149]  Around the 12th century, and then in the Renaissance, it was pretty much the canon of proportion and beauty.
[02:16:18.850 --> 02:16:22.172]  Symmetry and proportion and numbers, that numbers actually had quality.
[02:16:22.192 --> 02:16:22.952]  3-2-2!
[02:16:22.992 --> 02:16:31.537]  That's what people thought at that time, and there were people like Newton, and Spinoza, and some of the great... You know why 3-2-2 is so important?
[02:16:31.617 --> 02:16:32.738]  I can't comment, no.
[02:16:38.058 --> 02:16:41.339]  Well, it's got about a dozen meanings, but you ought to research that.
[02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:46.860]  You know, 3-2-2 is under a skull and crossbones on the door of Skull and Bones at Yale.
[02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:48.221]  Right.
[02:16:48.581 --> 02:16:52.222]  And of course, you know the Nazis wore the skull and crossbones on their hats?
[02:16:53.622 --> 02:16:58.104]  And did you know that a German secret society founded Skull and Bones in 1832?
[02:16:58.424 --> 02:17:06.486]  Did you know that Hitler was part of the Thule Society, and it openly said he was part of the Illuminati?
[02:17:07.162 --> 02:17:24.778]  Well, there's a part of me that's reticent to, you know, furnish you with other details in the building because I could see it might move into this netherworld, but I do know of another secret society at Yale called the... Do you want to finish this, Alex?
[02:17:25.118 --> 02:17:26.139]  The School and Tea?
[02:17:26.849 --> 02:17:27.590]  You're scrolling key.
[02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:29.651]  Were you about to tell me... You have a break now?
[02:17:29.751 --> 02:17:33.474]  Were you about to tell me there were skulls in there?
[02:17:33.874 --> 02:17:34.634]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:34.654 --> 02:17:35.255]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:45.325 --> 02:17:45.745]  Gold.
[02:17:46.106 --> 02:17:47.407]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:47.647 --> 02:17:53.732]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:57.736]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:58.096 --> 02:17:59.997]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:00.037 --> 02:18:02.339]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:02.479 --> 02:18:07.824]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper.
[02:18:07.824 --> 02:18:08.344]  We're good to go.
[02:18:28.254 --> 02:18:29.295]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:18:29.375 --> 02:18:31.356]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:18:51.787 --> 02:19:07.920]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:19:08.897 --> 02:19:14.139]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:19:14.939 --> 02:19:22.881]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:45.552 --> 02:19:50.054]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:50.394 --> 02:19:54.495]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:54.776 --> 02:19:55.336]  We listened.
[02:19:55.636 --> 02:20:00.618]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:00.898 --> 02:20:01.378]  We listened.
[02:20:01.758 --> 02:20:04.799]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:05.239 --> 02:20:05.760]  We listened.
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:09.241]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:20:09.241 --> 02:20:09.621]  I think so.
[02:20:35.497 --> 02:20:37.121]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:20:37.141 --> 02:20:38.765]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.722 --> 02:20:51.207]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, and I'm here to introduce to you a product that will put the pet back in your step.
[02:20:51.387 --> 02:20:56.030]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:20:56.230 --> 02:21:08.359]  Lack of energy, lack of strength, lack of stamina, lack of sleep, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the husband, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:21:08.619 --> 02:21:12.482]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all of these things and more.
[02:21:12.742 --> 02:21:15.023]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave Patch.
[02:21:15.243 --> 02:21:19.264]  It is safe, non-invasive, and is currently being used by world-renowned athletes.

[02:21:25.787 --> 02:21:28.247]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition?
[02:21:28.507 --> 02:21:29.728]  Or just trying to beat the clock?
[02:21:29.968 --> 02:21:31.989]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.

[02:21:37.771 --> 02:21:41.532]  Again, your free sample at LifeWavePromotion.com.
[02:21:54.974 --> 02:21:58.055]  Al, Jason, Tim, Allen, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[02:21:58.075 --> 02:21:59.975]  We're just going to have to keep our guests for a little bit longer.
[02:22:00.015 --> 02:22:00.775]  This is amazing.
[02:22:01.655 --> 02:22:02.495]  Real quick, sir.
[02:22:03.496 --> 02:22:06.716]  Continuing, we're talking about Scroll and Key, Secret Societies.
[02:22:06.736 --> 02:22:11.357]  You were going to tell us some more of the symbolism in this grand area where you come in with the 666.
[02:22:12.137 --> 02:22:13.157]  Tell us more.
[02:22:13.577 --> 02:22:13.757]  Right.
[02:22:13.777 --> 02:22:19.818]  I just wanted to preface this briefly by saying that symbols are multivalent, so they can take a wide range of interpretations.
[02:22:20.278 --> 02:22:23.299]  Now, my particular interpretation of things might differ than yours.
[02:22:23.775 --> 02:22:29.195]  But there is, in this room as well, the maidens on the third floor, the karyatids as they're called.
[02:22:29.651 --> 02:22:54.880]  carry a scrolling key in their hands and some people have pointed out to me well perhaps this is a reference to the scrolling key society at Yale the secret society scrolling key at Yale or down every single hall and all of the stairs and and and and most of the arrangements the number thirteen repeats throughout thirteen is ubiquitous throughout this building so someone could say oh thirteen is also an unlucky number uh... or that uh... the figure crowning the dome
[02:22:55.860 --> 02:23:00.682]  Is modeled after Hermes, who we all know from history as the father of occult arts.
[02:23:01.182 --> 02:23:10.265]  And directly beneath him, there's a black eight-pointed star, which in ancient history, the earliest archaic goddess that we know of, Ishtar, was represented as a black eight-pointed star.
[02:23:10.285 --> 02:23:15.867]  And again, people say, well that isn't, they'll say that isn't the Golden Boy, but you have the writings of the architect saying it was.
[02:23:16.227 --> 02:23:18.848]  Oh yeah, the writings of the architect clearly stated it.
[02:23:19.668 --> 02:23:21.609]  You get all this together in one place.
[02:23:21.769 --> 02:23:25.512]  The 666, the fences, the carvings, you know, all this.
[02:23:25.532 --> 02:23:28.994]  The 13 repeating throat, the scroll and key in the grand staircase hall.
[02:23:29.294 --> 02:23:36.998]  Even the two large bison, which are in the grand staircase hall, which people say, oh, it's just a totem image of Manitoba because those are the animals that existed on the plain.
[02:23:37.519 --> 02:23:46.564]  I would tell them, no, an ancient temple were always flanked by two very large menacing bulls that protected the inner sanctum.
[02:23:47.009 --> 02:23:48.710]  And so that's why their presence is there.
[02:23:50.251 --> 02:23:52.512]  And so this is my interpretation, of course.
[02:23:52.672 --> 02:23:54.172]  And my interpretation... But wait a minute!
[02:23:54.193 --> 02:24:00.576]  You've got the Supreme Grand Masons and the top Masons writing in, coming to tours and saying you're right!
[02:24:00.876 --> 02:24:09.180]  Well, actually, they've been astounded because I've been pointing out elements of their own tradition that, quite frankly, I don't think some of them knew.
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:13.862]  And what I expected is with the highest level Masons in the country, at least in Canada,
[02:24:15.090 --> 02:24:20.737]  That's because, sir, it's wheels within wheels.
[02:24:20.797 --> 02:24:24.040]  These so-called top masons are really porch masons.
[02:24:25.903 --> 02:24:26.323]  Say again?
[02:24:26.764 --> 02:24:29.867]  These top so-called masons are really porch masons.
[02:24:31.369 --> 02:24:32.610]  You have to give me a translation.
[02:24:32.951 --> 02:24:34.493]  A porch mason is the outer
[02:24:35.353 --> 02:24:41.099]  Sanctum Mason's or the, you know, you go to church, the preacher's up on the dais and you're in the crowd.
[02:24:41.779 --> 02:24:42.580]  They're in the crowd.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.102]  They're not even allowed up on stage.
[02:24:46.264 --> 02:24:47.605]  Oh, I gotta hand it to you, Alex.
[02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:47.985]  This is...
[02:24:50.109 --> 02:24:52.953]  Quite the experience appearing on your show.
[02:24:53.013 --> 02:24:53.233]  Wow.
[02:24:53.273 --> 02:24:55.517]  You said that during the break you looked up Moloch.
[02:24:55.537 --> 02:24:56.999]  Why don't you tell us about that individual?
[02:24:57.119 --> 02:25:03.067]  Well, only because, you know, studying ancient history and specializing in ancient Semitic languages.
[02:25:03.087 --> 02:25:06.031]  He was also worshipped in Greece and Babylon.
[02:25:06.071 --> 02:25:06.371]  That's right.
[02:25:07.192 --> 02:25:11.977]  And they always change their form, they become different deities.
[02:25:12.257 --> 02:25:14.199]  He was a goat, he was a bull, yeah.
[02:25:14.239 --> 02:25:21.205]  But it's true, the ancient texts show that Moloch required sacrifices of small children, and so did Tenet.
[02:25:21.686 --> 02:25:31.635]  So I went to him, I snuck into a meeting where Bush admittedly goes, you can pull up San Francisco Chronicle articles admitting I snuck in and got this, and they bring up the bound image of a baby and burn it before Moloch.
[02:25:31.675 --> 02:25:32.556]  That sounds very Christian.
[02:25:33.524 --> 02:25:34.244]  Let's go to a call.
[02:25:34.885 --> 02:25:35.585]  Let's go to a call.
[02:25:35.825 --> 02:25:38.286]  Al in Chicago, then Jason and others.
[02:25:38.306 --> 02:25:38.926]  Go ahead, Al.
[02:25:39.666 --> 02:25:40.367]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:40.407 --> 02:25:41.147]  Good to talk to you.
[02:25:41.407 --> 02:25:42.047]  Good to talk to you.
[02:25:42.087 --> 02:25:42.268]  Go ahead.
[02:25:42.288 --> 02:25:51.131]  Yeah, I have some interesting information here concerning Monsieur Antoine, who was the project manager of the original survey of the District of Columbia.
[02:25:51.811 --> 02:25:52.091]  Yes.
[02:25:52.692 --> 02:25:55.653]  Yeah, he was a member of the Cincinnati Society.
[02:25:55.913 --> 02:26:00.835]  He was liked by Washington, disliked by Jefferson because of his CS connection.
[02:26:01.977 --> 02:26:07.238]  He was dismissed from the project and was offered generous payment for the work performed.
[02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:08.718]  He was dismissed in March of 1792.
[02:26:11.539 --> 02:26:17.520]  He refused this offer and became obsessed with getting his contractual payment.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:23.241]  He lobbied Congress for 18 years to receive the contractual repayment.
[02:26:23.261 --> 02:26:25.781]  But tell people what he specifically did so they understand you.
[02:26:26.661 --> 02:26:27.602]  He was a surveyor.
[02:26:27.762 --> 02:26:28.962]  He laid out the original
[02:26:29.974 --> 02:26:35.058]  He did the original survey for the District of Columbia in 1792.
[02:26:35.599 --> 02:26:36.019]  Okay.
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:48.089]  Okay, the funny thing is, he became obsessed with getting his contractual payment, and by an act of Congress passed May 1st, 1810, he received it.
[02:26:48.669 --> 02:26:49.190]  The sum was $666.02.
[02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:49.850]  It's unpayable.
[02:26:49.991 --> 02:26:51.672]  It's an endless decimal of 666.
[02:26:58.137 --> 02:26:58.697]  That's right.
[02:26:58.838 --> 02:26:59.898]  Isn't that nice?
[02:26:59.978 --> 02:27:01.119]  And, oh, they love it.
[02:27:01.279 --> 02:27:06.003]  Look, just type, type, type, bill number or HR666 into a search engine.
[02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:10.346]  State bills, local laws, federal laws.
[02:27:10.746 --> 02:27:14.909]  It always has to do with secret arrests, torture, checkpoints, police state.
[02:27:15.210 --> 02:27:19.993]  Just type HR or S666 in and prepare yourselves.
[02:27:20.013 --> 02:27:21.334]  You'll be at the Library of Congress.
[02:27:21.654 --> 02:27:24.917]  Hundreds of bills, always evil, always horrible.
[02:27:25.653 --> 02:27:27.836]  But it's just a friendly number.
[02:27:28.777 --> 02:27:29.959]  Here to help you.
[02:27:30.099 --> 02:27:31.420]  Give us your firearms.
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:32.562]  We'll be nice to you.
[02:27:32.582 --> 02:27:33.463]  We'll be back.
[02:27:35.626 --> 02:27:36.527]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.007 --> 02:27:38.609]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.530 --> 02:27:42.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.242 --> 02:27:46.943]  Soon the mark of the beast will be in force.

[02:31:04.390 --> 02:31:05.751]  Just have your comment or question ready.
[02:31:05.911 --> 02:31:09.875]  Real fast, Al in Chicago, interesting point you brought up.
[02:31:10.395 --> 02:31:12.117]  I haven't confirmed that, but it sounds interesting.
[02:31:12.157 --> 02:31:13.498]  I'd like to see the evidence of that.
[02:31:14.639 --> 02:31:17.362]  Anything else you want to add to our guest, Frank Alba?
[02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:20.512]  I have this from a book called The National Capital.
[02:31:20.592 --> 02:31:22.734]  It's History and Architecture.
[02:31:22.774 --> 02:31:24.055]  It was written in 1893.
[02:31:25.857 --> 02:31:33.924]  Basically, I would like you to comment on the Cincinnati Society and why Washington would like this man and Jefferson would so dislike him.
[02:31:35.365 --> 02:31:40.790]  I'm familiar with the Cincinnati Society, but I'm not versed enough to get into any real detail on it.
[02:31:40.810 --> 02:31:41.690]  Do you have any comments?
[02:31:42.411 --> 02:31:42.851]  No, I don't.
[02:31:43.272 --> 02:31:44.653]  I just thought it was interesting that
[02:31:45.171 --> 02:31:47.932]  The payment that he was obsessed with was $666.23.
[02:31:48.012 --> 02:31:53.375]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:31:55.716 --> 02:31:57.137]  Do you have anything to say on that, Frank?
[02:31:57.697 --> 02:31:57.877]  No.
[02:31:58.718 --> 02:32:01.339]  Alright, let's go to Jason in Maryland.
[02:32:01.379 --> 02:32:02.319]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:32:02.679 --> 02:32:03.260]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:06.962]  I have a question, or a statement, pertinent to today's discussion.
[02:32:07.022 --> 02:32:09.743]  But first, every day that I listen to you, I'm very curious.
[02:32:10.565 --> 02:32:12.406]  Why do you think you're still alive?
[02:32:12.486 --> 02:32:19.289]  How come with your spreading the word like this and putting out all this wonderful information, how come they haven't attacked you?
[02:32:20.390 --> 02:32:22.331]  Well, that's one of the most common questions I get.
[02:32:22.411 --> 02:32:23.652]  It's a very complex one.
[02:32:23.672 --> 02:32:25.092]  They've killed a lot of patriots.
[02:32:25.673 --> 02:32:31.475]  They've falsely charged and imprisoned a lot of truth seekers and people who love God and love freedom.
[02:32:32.616 --> 02:32:38.759]  But number one, because I believe God protects me, and when my work's done, that's the minute that the globalists would destroy me.
[02:32:39.634 --> 02:32:46.317]  But more than... at a whole other level, the globalists kind of delude themselves and they believe this is the new age.
[02:32:46.477 --> 02:32:46.937]  They've said this.
[02:32:47.318 --> 02:32:48.858]  They believe it's time to reveal.
[02:32:49.719 --> 02:32:53.120]  And they believe their power is great enough now that it can be exposed.
[02:32:53.981 --> 02:32:59.343]  And plus there's so many of us now exposing things that they can't get us all.
[02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:00.844]  I mean, we're like mushrooms.
[02:33:00.884 --> 02:33:03.645]  You stomp on us, you just spread the spores.
[02:33:04.634 --> 02:33:07.375]  And in a certain level, I think they think that I do.
[02:33:07.415 --> 02:33:08.836]  They're intimidating for them.
[02:33:09.176 --> 02:33:11.597]  Because I put it out in a very scary fashion, because it is.
[02:33:12.017 --> 02:33:14.018]  I have more faith in humanity to rise up against it.
[02:33:14.178 --> 02:33:15.138]  But I gotta go quick.
[02:33:15.178 --> 02:33:16.919]  Any questions or comments for our guest?
[02:33:17.059 --> 02:33:17.919]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:18.239 --> 02:33:28.623]  First, he said that numerology is 2,500 years old, and I'm wondering if he separates that from Hebrew gematria, which predates that by thousands of years.
[02:33:28.703 --> 02:33:31.404]  Also, he says Hermes... I know that's impossible, sir.
[02:33:31.846 --> 02:33:32.246]  How so?
[02:33:32.827 --> 02:33:37.971]  Because Hebrew-Gumatria wasn't introduced historically until much later.
[02:33:38.832 --> 02:33:40.633]  Much later, not a thousand years before that.
[02:33:40.653 --> 02:33:46.938]  In fact, Hebrew was a proto-language about 800 BC.
[02:33:47.679 --> 02:33:51.422]  And that's the official scholarly opinion, and I studied Biblical Hebrew.
[02:33:51.542 --> 02:33:52.643]  So I have to part ways with you there.
[02:33:53.084 --> 02:34:00.810]  How about Hermes being preceded as the father of esoteric wisdom by Nimrod or Ninus and Semiramis?
[02:34:01.323 --> 02:34:06.005]  Well, Hermes as an esoteric tradition was something well noted.
[02:34:06.286 --> 02:34:10.768]  We have a corpus of literature dedicated to Hermes that was extremely popular in the Renaissance.
[02:34:11.149 --> 02:34:18.635]  And captured most of the greatest minds of the Enlightenment as being the earliest form of kind of religious salvation.
[02:34:18.695 --> 02:34:28.242]  It was very Gnostic, it had lots of tendencies that were somewhat Christian, and then others that move into magical land.
[02:34:28.322 --> 02:34:34.907]  But that's a whole other... Really, is this another manifestation of the battle on minister religions to ensnare Christians?
[02:34:35.647 --> 02:34:53.076]  And in parting, I would ask you to please comment, you spoke earlier of the Brazen Chapters of Hiram of Tyre, and I was wondering if you might, Joaquin and Boaz, I was wondering if you might comment on that in as much as you see it.
[02:34:53.316 --> 02:34:55.837]  Again, that's where good ol' Moloch was worshipped.
[02:34:55.978 --> 02:34:56.898]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:34:57.158 --> 02:34:58.439]  Good points and questions there.
[02:34:58.499 --> 02:34:58.719]  Frank?
[02:35:00.282 --> 02:35:01.063]  Was that question to me?
[02:35:01.083 --> 02:35:02.346]  Yes, it was.
[02:35:02.426 --> 02:35:03.749]  It was offered to you.
[02:35:05.171 --> 02:35:06.073]  About the two pillars?
[02:35:06.093 --> 02:35:06.915]  Yes.
[02:35:07.335 --> 02:35:08.979]  I believe you were commenting on that, Alex.
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:10.602]  I had nothing to add.
[02:35:11.229 --> 02:35:14.810]  Well, I just know that that is part of their basic rights.
[02:35:15.310 --> 02:35:18.551]  I was comparing it to the two towers being knocked down and then being rebuilt.
[02:35:18.872 --> 02:35:19.552]  Part of the ritual.
[02:35:20.052 --> 02:35:23.233]  Let's go ahead now and go to another caller here.
[02:35:23.253 --> 02:35:25.714]  Let's talk to Adam in Pittsburgh.
[02:35:25.874 --> 02:35:26.814]  Adam, you're on the air.
[02:35:26.894 --> 02:35:27.855]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:35:27.975 --> 02:35:28.215]  Good.
[02:35:28.455 --> 02:35:38.058]  Hey, speaking of fun, I think the reason why he was so eager to get his 666 paycheck was because of the fact that he designed most of the streets in D.C.
[02:35:38.498 --> 02:35:40.679]  around Masonic and Satanic symbols.
[02:35:41.283 --> 02:35:51.465]  Well, I knew his name from that, yes, and then you have the French architect with a lot of the more modern designs that are there, and it's a giant obelisk, and the buildings are all like temples.
[02:35:52.146 --> 02:36:00.988]  Right above the White House, if you look on a map, the streets pretty much form an upside-down five-pointed star, with the White House being the bottom point.
[02:36:01.008 --> 02:36:04.349]  And you've got an owl perching on it with the Capitol in its belly.
[02:36:04.889 --> 02:36:06.529]  That's on the east side of the Capitol.
[02:36:06.589 --> 02:36:10.070]  The lawn, the walkway, when you look at it from the air, forms an owl.
[02:36:10.959 --> 02:36:17.030]  And I'm not sure, Frank being from Canada, are you aware that there is also an owl on the $1 bill here in America?
[02:36:18.285 --> 02:36:18.525]  No.
[02:36:19.265 --> 02:36:24.486]  Your own Masonic tradition, although quite elaborate, I haven't investigated.
[02:36:27.027 --> 02:36:27.947]  Take the Supreme Court.
[02:36:28.007 --> 02:36:33.028]  It's got all these gods, Zeus and the owls, but that's okay.
[02:36:33.428 --> 02:36:35.768]  We've just got to pull down all the Christian symbols.
[02:36:36.928 --> 02:36:38.389]  It's just like in Alabama.
[02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:41.649]  They've got a bust of Zeus there, but you can have that.
[02:36:41.689 --> 02:36:43.290]  You just can't have the Ten Commandments.
[02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:45.430]  We also see selective enforcement.
[02:36:45.470 --> 02:36:45.770]  Go ahead.
[02:36:47.192 --> 02:36:51.574]  The Republican National Committee logo and the DNC logo.
[02:36:52.494 --> 02:36:53.995]  I'm sure you're familiar with this, Alex.
[02:36:54.955 --> 02:36:56.476]  Upside down stars, yeah.
[02:36:56.656 --> 02:36:58.417]  The stars were actually flipped upside down.
[02:36:58.437 --> 02:37:00.218]  Why is everything upside down now?
[02:37:01.498 --> 02:37:02.339]  I don't know why, but...
[02:37:03.923 --> 02:37:07.785]  You can look at... And look, look, look, look, nothing against Mormons, okay?
[02:37:08.186 --> 02:37:11.308]  But at the big temple in Salt Lake, they've got pentagrams.
[02:37:11.988 --> 02:37:15.570]  And on top of it, you go to the Vatican.
[02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:18.372]  I mean, it's just full of this stuff.
[02:37:19.312 --> 02:37:20.473]  Any comments to that, Frank?
[02:37:21.293 --> 02:37:21.494]  No.
[02:37:22.334 --> 02:37:30.639]  My experience has been four years of exhaustive work on one building, and I hope that it sponsors interpretation of whatever degree.
[02:37:31.195 --> 02:37:39.701]  I'm just putting information that I can validate as fact, and wherever you want to take it is, of course, up to people's interpretation.
[02:37:40.382 --> 02:37:41.783]  Well, this stuff is everywhere.
[02:37:41.803 --> 02:37:44.044]  It's just amazing.
[02:37:44.865 --> 02:37:49.748]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[02:37:50.549 --> 02:37:52.891]  Paul in New York, and I'll be the last caller we have time for.
[02:37:52.911 --> 02:37:53.571]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:37:54.072 --> 02:37:57.394]  Alex, one simple question for you and your guest, one each.
[02:37:57.885 --> 02:37:59.967]  Uh, Klaus Stiels, Washington Monument.
[02:38:00.147 --> 02:38:03.610]  Was he a Mason, and what level Mason was he?
[02:38:04.511 --> 02:38:11.356]  And, uh, to your guest, who is the one originating person who designed this building in Manitoba?
[02:38:11.696 --> 02:38:14.178]  Was he a Mason, and what level was he?
[02:38:14.199 --> 02:38:16.921]  Uh, can I answer that question first?
[02:38:16.981 --> 02:38:17.221]  Sure.
[02:38:17.481 --> 02:38:18.782]  That is an excellent question.
[02:38:18.802 --> 02:38:21.945]  I haven't been able to establish whether he was a Mason, although
[02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:29.066]  I found there was another mysterious architect who takes all the credit, who was in London at the time.
[02:38:29.426 --> 02:38:30.607]  It's a great mystery.
[02:38:31.067 --> 02:38:38.934]  Here on the ground, Frank W. Simon built the legislative building, although all the other architectural encyclopedias credit another figure, Septimus Warwick.
[02:38:39.234 --> 02:38:40.255]  I haven't figured that out.
[02:38:40.575 --> 02:38:46.140]  That might lead me down the rabbit hole that you guys are talking about, but so far, it's a mystery.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.843]  But the committee that paid for it were all Masons.
[02:38:48.963 --> 02:38:49.243]  Correct.
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:57.164]  Okay, to answer your question, basically every major building built, every monument in D.C.
[02:38:57.284 --> 02:39:02.507]  was built by, designed by a Rosicrucian, a Templar, a Mason, it's all the same thing.
[02:39:02.527 --> 02:39:04.008]  People get confused by all these different names.
[02:39:04.088 --> 02:39:10.131]  It's like, you know, you've got different places where you can go get your car worked on by a mechanic.
[02:39:10.151 --> 02:39:11.772]  You know, they're mechanics.
[02:39:12.412 --> 02:39:13.173]  This is what they do.
[02:39:13.213 --> 02:39:14.014]  This is what they're about.
[02:39:14.054 --> 02:39:14.655]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:15.596 --> 02:39:16.257]  Very interesting.
[02:39:16.357 --> 02:39:18.761]  And the point is, as you talk about this, you're a kook.
[02:39:18.941 --> 02:39:19.201]  No, no.
[02:39:19.261 --> 02:39:20.363]  This is the real thing.
[02:39:20.643 --> 02:39:21.584]  This is what's happening.
[02:39:21.624 --> 02:39:23.627]  This is what the architects are into.
[02:39:23.667 --> 02:39:24.729]  This is their religion.
[02:39:25.129 --> 02:39:26.391]  A lot of your top architects.
[02:39:27.772 --> 02:39:35.519]  You look at this, you need to understand this is the driving ideology, the religion, the force, the philosophy of the elite today.
[02:39:35.939 --> 02:39:47.849]  Most of them are part of this, and this is how they bind themselves, and they're bringing in a world government, and they're bringing in the implantable microchip, which they're promoting, and they're bringing in the police state, and it's really happening.
[02:39:48.850 --> 02:39:55.435]  Architecture seems to be the keystone in all of that, because architecture has this apparent effect of
[02:39:55.896 --> 02:39:56.777]  Affecting people.
[02:39:57.517 --> 02:39:59.519]  It projects their power.
[02:39:59.559 --> 02:40:00.680]  It makes us feel small.
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:01.901]  It dwarfs us.
[02:40:03.843 --> 02:40:04.843]  Right.
[02:40:05.004 --> 02:40:12.069]  Architecture was the most elaborate science known in masonry and throughout thousands of years.
[02:40:12.089 --> 02:40:20.056]  And it was a powerful secret, the mathematics, to build buildings which would make you number two to the pharaoh or the king or the Caesar.
[02:40:20.196 --> 02:40:23.759]  And so, throughout, this is the icon of their religion.
[02:40:25.468 --> 02:40:26.548]  I can't part with you there.
[02:40:27.729 --> 02:40:30.551]  Alright, well I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:40:30.611 --> 02:40:47.242]  It was amazing and people can read the Globe and Mail articles, the CTV articles, all the big magazine and newspaper articles that we found, four or five newspaper articles, a couple TV reports, are at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and we're fighting these architects.
[02:40:47.762 --> 02:40:50.884]  And their grand architect who are building the New World Order.
[02:40:50.904 --> 02:40:58.029]  They believe they've seized human architecture and are actually changing our evolution and really they're destroying us.
[02:40:58.329 --> 02:40:59.250]  They're enslaving us.
[02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:10.017]  The feudal lords who love to breed dogs and who love to breed horses and pigs also think that they're actually controlling us and warping us to be better little slaves.
[02:41:10.277 --> 02:41:13.519]  That's why we fight the prison planet and their great architect.
[02:41:13.759 --> 02:41:14.780]  Thanks for coming on, Frank.
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:16.301]  Well, thanks for inviting me, Alex.
[02:41:16.701 --> 02:41:17.782]  Good to hear from you.
[02:41:18.042 --> 02:41:19.183]  God bless and take care.
[02:41:19.323 --> 02:41:21.944]  Alright, well, that's it.
[02:41:22.265 --> 02:41:27.368]  And so now, they're just flaunting it in your face in the big newspapers up in Canada admitting this.
[02:41:27.448 --> 02:41:33.091]  And the Austin City Council buildings, the three, six story buildings, are just totally satanic.
[02:41:33.432 --> 02:41:35.533]  If you live in Austin, you ought to go get a tour of it.
[02:41:35.693 --> 02:41:37.954]  I mean, it's just, it is disgusting.
[02:41:38.735 --> 02:41:44.979]  And it's satanic, and then they'll tell you, oh, we predate your Judeo-Christian term of Satan.
[02:41:45.905 --> 02:41:50.787]  No, we worship the God of Light, the Light Bearer, the Illuminator.
[02:41:51.987 --> 02:41:58.830]  And yes, we do like to sacrifice children, but that's our sacrament, and what's wrong with that?
[02:41:59.410 --> 02:42:09.194]  You know, these people, these sickos, who email me sometimes, when I badmouth the Aztecs, who would sacrifice tens of thousands of people on certain holidays,
[02:42:09.821 --> 02:42:15.226]  The people were so brainwashed, they would willingly give their children up to the priest to have their hearts cut out.
[02:42:15.486 --> 02:42:19.430]  They would then kick the bodies down the stairs, and the people would cut it up for lunch meat.
[02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:22.953]  That was their main meat product, was the sacrificed people.
[02:42:23.193 --> 02:42:25.275]  And I'll get an email going, that was their culture!
[02:42:25.335 --> 02:42:27.137]  How dare you badmouth their culture!
[02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:28.878]  You can't judge a culture!
[02:42:29.139 --> 02:42:30.500]  Okay, then the Nazis were good!
[02:42:31.181 --> 02:42:32.642]  They wore skulls on their hats.
[02:42:32.842 --> 02:42:34.102]  They wore black uniforms.
[02:42:35.603 --> 02:42:37.043]  20 million Germans died in the war.
[02:42:37.323 --> 02:42:39.304]  Tens of millions of other people they killed.
[02:42:39.624 --> 02:42:41.525]  They rampaged all over the place.
[02:42:42.885 --> 02:42:44.006]  And that was their culture.
[02:42:44.346 --> 02:42:45.326]  The culture of death.
[02:42:45.366 --> 02:42:46.206]  The order of death.
[02:42:46.246 --> 02:42:47.347]  The order of the death's end.
[02:42:47.387 --> 02:42:48.647]  The order of skull and bones.
[02:42:50.788 --> 02:42:51.168]  Okay?
[02:42:51.388 --> 02:42:53.349]  And I think that culture was sick.
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:02.607]  And America's culture of abortions and just mindlessness and war and fraud is sick too.
[02:43:04.248 --> 02:43:04.869]  It's sick.
[02:43:07.131 --> 02:43:18.000]  And when we're a culture that doesn't have a rudder, that doesn't have a vision, we're going to have that vision and rudder set for us, that course set for us, and it's straight to hell.
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:20.762]  A bunch of decadent inbred trash.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:24.542]  That thinks because they're ruthless, that gives them right to be in total control?
[02:43:24.702 --> 02:43:26.364]  Well, we're in control because we're the best!
[02:43:26.644 --> 02:43:32.988]  No, you're in control because you're like a cancer that's spread throughout the body and threatens to destroy humanity and our future!
[02:43:33.288 --> 02:43:35.170]  Which could be unbelievably great!
[02:43:36.951 --> 02:43:43.596]  So just because you're spreading, and just because you're so ruthless, and just because you're so sick, doesn't give you right to rule anything!
[02:43:43.756 --> 02:43:45.157]  You destructive trash!
[02:43:47.218 --> 02:43:48.319]  You wreak of death!
[02:43:49.409 --> 02:43:51.170]  Your stench is disgusting!
[02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:53.211]  It makes me want to puke!
[02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:59.754]  And all your pops and all your low-level minions that think they're at the top of the pyramids, you're all playing into this.
[02:44:00.054 --> 02:44:01.594]  You are bringing forth hell!
[02:44:01.854 --> 02:44:03.755]  You are conjuring the Antichrist!
[02:44:04.015 --> 02:44:07.857]  You are bringing forward the end of humanity!
[02:44:12.599 --> 02:44:14.840]  But God's promise is a remnant will be saved.
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:18.342]  And the problem is the Christian churches are almost all run by masons with
[02:44:19.574 --> 02:44:34.156]  When he's not saying that forced abortion and infanticide is a good thing in China, the head of the 700 Club is flashing the lion's paw on the cover of Time Magazine and, you know, flashing all these other symbols all over the place.
[02:44:36.117 --> 02:44:37.817]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:44:37.837 --> 02:44:41.758]  I'm glad I thought of that.
[02:44:41.778 --> 02:44:43.238]  I want to put that in the film before it's done.
[02:44:44.718 --> 02:44:48.739]  Just, I have to watch them on TV, flashing their signs at us, laughing at us,
[02:44:50.069 --> 02:44:53.992]  And just knowing what they've done, and you know, maybe a chip's good.
[02:44:54.052 --> 02:44:55.673]  I mean, it's just, it's out of control.
[02:44:57.674 --> 02:44:59.836]  And now Christians, I hear them on the radio, so-called Christians.
[02:45:00.456 --> 02:45:00.596]  Oh!
[02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:02.178]  Torture's good!
[02:45:02.218 --> 02:45:03.198]  It's of the Lord.
[02:45:03.218 --> 02:45:07.301]  I mean, that's mind control.
[02:45:07.341 --> 02:45:11.584]  When you've got devil-worshiping scum, and they think they're Christians.
[02:45:14.126 --> 02:45:15.287]  They think they're Christians.
[02:45:15.327 --> 02:45:16.908]  I'm going to come back and hit a few news items.
[02:45:17.498 --> 02:45:19.299]  We're in the final segment here in a few minutes.
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:32.569]  Just at the end of this segment, I just want to tell you, you know, if you want to know about secret societies, if you want to know about the New World Order, if you want to understand really how far the rabbit hole goes and what we're facing, you need to get my film, Dark Secrets, inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:45:32.589 --> 02:45:34.690]  I mean, how any of you wouldn't order this?
[02:45:34.730 --> 02:45:35.251]  I have no idea.
[02:45:35.271 --> 02:45:40.594]  I mean, I stuck in and got the footage of them engaging in a satanic ritual.
[02:45:40.835 --> 02:45:46.999]  George Bush and his daddy and his daddy and going back to, you know, William Howard Taft, they all go there.
[02:45:48.183 --> 02:45:49.744]  They engage in these rituals.
[02:45:49.784 --> 02:45:50.384]  They do it.
[02:45:50.444 --> 02:45:52.805]  I caught it on video and it's admitted they go there.
[02:45:53.586 --> 02:45:55.447]  We've got them engaged in Moloch worship.
[02:45:55.927 --> 02:45:57.288]  You need to have this film.
[02:45:57.328 --> 02:45:58.769]  Two hours, five minutes, $25.95.

[02:46:09.754 --> 02:46:11.235]  And, you know, I don't promote this stuff enough.
[02:46:11.355 --> 02:46:12.616]  It is the pleasure of my life.
[02:46:12.636 --> 02:46:15.337]  It is the thrill of my life to warn people.
[02:46:15.377 --> 02:46:16.498]  To unlock minds.
[02:46:18.450 --> 02:46:22.771]  I mean, I have a responsibility to try to stop the globalists, and so do you, and these videos will do it!
[02:46:24.352 --> 02:46:26.353]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove!
[02:46:26.373 --> 02:46:28.333]  We've at least got a war on as many people as we can!

[02:46:34.095 --> 02:46:34.935]  The Matrix of Evil!
[02:46:34.955 --> 02:46:35.896]  American Dictators!
[02:46:36.456 --> 02:46:37.736]  America Destroyed by Design!
[02:46:37.796 --> 02:46:38.537]  Police State 1!
[02:46:38.577 --> 02:46:39.017]  Police State 2!
[02:46:39.377 --> 02:46:42.078]  They're all incredible films you need to have!

[02:46:56.521 --> 02:46:57.122]  Give them to people.
[02:46:57.162 --> 02:46:58.323]  Make copies of the one copy.
[02:46:58.443 --> 02:46:59.044]  I don't care.
[02:46:59.325 --> 02:47:00.446]  Just get it out to people.
[02:47:01.267 --> 02:47:02.890]  Toll-free number to get the films.

[02:47:22.777 --> 02:47:25.239]  Or again, the secure shopping carts at InfoWars.com.

[02:47:40.292 --> 02:47:40.472]  Look.
[02:47:41.641 --> 02:47:47.909]  The globalists look at you like a lab technician looks at a monkey who they've got electrodes in its brain.
[02:47:47.989 --> 02:47:49.310]  They see you as animals.
[02:47:49.731 --> 02:47:52.814]  They call us animals, bugs, cattle, whatever.
[02:47:52.835 --> 02:47:54.957]  They see us as garbage.
[02:47:56.158 --> 02:47:59.723]  And all it is is the pharaohs thinking that the people were slaves.
[02:48:00.382 --> 02:48:20.017]  And it got picked up by certain sects that Moses tried to stop when he threw the tablets at them, and it got picked up by the Germans, and it got spread to everybody, and it's just here in America, and you've got this counterfeit of what God gave us, running alongside, continually trying to dominate and take over.
[02:48:21.178 --> 02:48:27.383]  And it's the New World Order, the globalists think they're God, and they've got to be stopped.
[02:48:29.432 --> 02:48:30.012]  They love it.
[02:48:30.053 --> 02:48:30.873]  They love evil.
[02:48:30.893 --> 02:48:31.734]  They're just sick.
[02:48:32.794 --> 02:48:33.935]  They don't have conscience.
[02:48:36.317 --> 02:48:40.860]  If life is to flourish, we must resist the forces of the Order of Death.
[02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:42.781]  The Order of Death is your enemy.
[02:48:46.374 --> 02:48:49.317]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.958 --> 02:48:51.259]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:57.206]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.486 --> 02:49:02.692]  In 2 hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.012 --> 02:49:07.193]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[02:49:07.333 --> 02:49:11.114]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:16.015]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.095 --> 02:49:18.856]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:49:19.176 --> 02:49:22.357]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.397 --> 02:49:24.237]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:58.454 --> 02:50:01.936]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:02.216 --> 02:50:06.421]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:06.721 --> 02:50:10.646]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:10.886 --> 02:50:17.393]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:17.634 --> 02:50:23.100]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[02:50:37.703 --> 02:50:38.504]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.015 --> 02:50:46.556]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.394 --> 02:51:02.055]  We're good to go!
[02:51:30.934 --> 02:51:34.016]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.176 --> 02:51:40.039]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.285 --> 02:51:55.852]  Alright, some good news that happened last week.
[02:51:56.252 --> 02:51:58.314]  I never mention this, we should talk about the good news.
[02:51:58.374 --> 02:52:02.496]  Philadelphia judge clears Christian demonstrators of hate crimes charges.
[02:52:04.017 --> 02:52:07.980]  They were facing 47 years in prison for praying on a street corner.
[02:52:09.853 --> 02:52:11.394]  So there's some good news.
[02:52:11.434 --> 02:52:14.455]  But the feds and federal prosecutors advised all this.
[02:52:14.515 --> 02:52:17.556]  Bush's people wanted to set the precedent to put him in prison.
[02:52:18.296 --> 02:52:21.357]  And of course, they'll be hailed as Christians, not the Moloch worshippers they are.
[02:52:22.077 --> 02:52:32.041]  Scott Ritter, who's been vindicated and validated over and over again, says his inside sources are saying the invasion of Iran is coming up in June.
[02:52:32.381 --> 02:52:34.682]  Iran will be attacked, I should say, properly.
[02:52:36.202 --> 02:52:37.263]  Who knows if that's going to happen.
[02:52:37.283 --> 02:52:37.923]  I hope it doesn't.
[02:52:38.815 --> 02:53:07.007]  uh... writing a wrong New York Post uh... some uh... students middle school students wrote letters they were told to the troops and said we don't agree with the war so they had to apologize and it's a big deal how bad they are hey don't tell them to write letters and tell them what to write okay again training on how to be little prisoners huge article I could have spent an hour on CPS judge and jury just a disgusting article on the front page of the statesman yesterday
[02:53:07.975 --> 02:53:08.515]  Here in Austin.
[02:53:08.876 --> 02:53:12.518]  Shows of backyards strewn with toys and a couple Coke cans.
[02:53:13.299 --> 02:53:16.741]  And the poor family with the kids clutching on their parents not wanting to be taken.
[02:53:17.522 --> 02:53:20.324]  It's just how wonderful our CPS workers are and how good they are.
[02:53:20.584 --> 02:53:21.064]  Hey folks!
[02:53:21.104 --> 02:53:29.430]  The facts are, even Time Magazine admitted a few years ago, the shame of foster care, you're five times more likely to be abused in government custody than anywhere else!
[02:53:30.571 --> 02:53:31.031]  Oh yes!
[02:53:31.992 --> 02:53:33.333]  Five times more likely!
[02:53:35.159 --> 02:53:38.081]  Over two-thirds of the kids are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:53:38.241 --> 02:53:39.522]  Are there bad families out there?
[02:53:39.562 --> 02:53:39.863]  Yes.
[02:53:40.283 --> 02:53:42.605]  And if they commit crimes, it's a criminal matter.
[02:53:44.346 --> 02:53:46.148]  And there should be no state funding of this.
[02:53:46.188 --> 02:53:49.891]  The children should go to an orphanage, but first try to go to family.
[02:53:50.775 --> 02:53:55.937]  Not to this huge industry of the foster parents and these government institutions and the rest of it.
[02:53:56.138 --> 02:53:56.818]  And the feds!
[02:53:56.858 --> 02:54:03.761]  Bill Clinton passed a law where they have to double the amount of children taken every year if they're going to get their next slate of funding.
[02:54:04.141 --> 02:54:07.903]  And so Texas is radically expanding the funding and acting like more is needed!
[02:54:08.573 --> 02:54:17.702]  And in the article it starts out going, well she goes around to houses and has the child seats and decides whether to take the kids when she shows up, as if she's Judge Jury Executioner!
[02:54:18.143 --> 02:54:31.537]  A federal court just ruled, finally, thank God, I couldn't believe it, two weeks ago, that the IRS can't take your property without taking you to court and charging you and, you know, it's due process, people!
[02:54:32.461 --> 02:54:35.503]  But see, the government in the last 50 years has created all these new agencies.
[02:54:35.984 --> 02:54:41.048]  I mean, if a CPS worker showed up and saw something that she could call the police on, then she could do something.
[02:54:41.068 --> 02:54:42.109]  But that's not how it's done.
[02:54:42.149 --> 02:54:45.631]  It's just, well, there's too many plates in this sink.
[02:54:45.691 --> 02:54:53.177]  So I'm going to take your kids and throw them in a warehouse, and when they cry for you, even if they're two years old, we're going to put them on Prozac.
[02:54:53.517 --> 02:54:56.660]  And when they have seizures from it, we're going to put them on more drugs.
[02:54:58.321 --> 02:54:59.262]  It's insane.
[02:55:00.629 --> 02:55:01.750]  And their own handbooks.
[02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:05.193]  I've read the handbooks these social services people use at UT.
[02:55:05.513 --> 02:55:08.015]  It says the family is the enemy, must be defeated.
[02:55:08.035 --> 02:55:11.138]  I mean, it actually says we must break up and end the family structure.
[02:55:11.358 --> 02:55:12.679]  The state must become the parents.
[02:55:12.699 --> 02:55:13.900]  I actually have this stuff!
[02:55:14.381 --> 02:55:14.701]  I have!
[02:55:14.721 --> 02:55:15.622]  They don't even hide this!
[02:55:15.922 --> 02:55:24.024]  Dr. Phil says the state is the parents, that it's a privilege to be a parent, now it's a privilege to vote, now it's a privilege to own a gun, it's a privilege to drive your car.
[02:55:24.405 --> 02:55:29.206]  I've actually heard Neocon talk show hosts in the last two days, and I've probably listened to 30 minutes while I'm driving.
[02:55:29.686 --> 02:55:36.908]  One says we should get rid of all juries, then another one was on there talking about how it's a privilege to be a parent.
[02:55:37.829 --> 02:55:40.669]  I mean it's just, it's crazy!
[02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:42.570]  This is
[02:55:43.829 --> 02:55:45.990]  This is the conservative leaders on talk radio.
[02:55:46.650 --> 02:55:47.631]  Get rid of juries.
[02:55:48.631 --> 02:55:50.372]  Voting is a privilege.
[02:55:51.113 --> 02:55:56.315]  And we should get rid of it for most people.
[02:55:56.355 --> 02:55:58.396]  And this is the kind of stuff, I mean, it's Twilight Zone!
[02:55:58.957 --> 02:56:00.237]  And it's just like the Aztecs.
[02:56:00.277 --> 02:56:01.718]  They said sacrifice was normal.
[02:56:02.018 --> 02:56:04.279]  And the people said, oh, well, the government says it, it must be good.
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:04.940]  No!
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:06.961]  We have to say no to these crazies!
[02:56:07.958 --> 02:56:17.501]  But if we're just these little mindless idiots that imprint on whatever we're told, we'll accept things like Hitler did, and the Aztecs did, and slavery in this country, what we did before.
[02:56:18.041 --> 02:56:21.022]  We've got to recognize evil and stop being moral relativists.
[02:56:21.622 --> 02:56:27.984]  Back tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, back tomorrow 11 to 2, presentplanet.tv is the website.
[02:56:28.224 --> 02:56:29.244]  God bless you all!
[02:56:29.405 --> 02:56:32.205]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order!
