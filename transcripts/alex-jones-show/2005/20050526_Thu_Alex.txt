[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.341]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.062]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:09.863]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:11.364]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:13.625]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:21.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.650]  Well, well, well.
[00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.451]  I tell you, time just is speeding up more and more.
[00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:48.514]  Seems like Monday was yesterday, but now it's Thursday, the 26th day of May 2005.
[00:00:48.594 --> 00:01:00.718]  We're going to be live for the next three hours and we're going to have wide open telephones and go to your calls early in the next segment, yet again, like we did yesterday.
[00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:12.420]  Any news item, any issue of significance you wish to discuss, any piece of propaganda you wish to dissect, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:26.689]  If you're joining us for the first time, this broadcast is dedicated to exposing the global government that is controlled by a worldwide crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.943]  And we shatter the false left-right paradigm.
[00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:37.105]  We get down to the actual nuts and bolts of how society is really operating and who controls it.
[00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.386]  I make my decisions according to what gives us more liberty and freedom.
[00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:44.347]  I don't look at politicians' labels.
[00:01:44.448 --> 00:01:45.628]  I look at their actions.
[00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.211]  Pull free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:58.894]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:11.398]  You know, former Mexican Special Forces troops are running around, and they're not former folks, are running around killing people in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California,
[00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.376]  Many other areas of the country, and I've got a new article here out of Arizona concerning it, but it's never made national news, and it should.
[00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:22.137]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:30.304]  French in disarray as they admit EU treaty vote is lost to expand and get rid of even more sovereignty of France.
[00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.145]  They have refused.
[00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:38.671]  The people have roundly rejected it, and the Netherlands looks set to throw it out.
[00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:46.952]  They didn't allow votes of the citizens on entry to the EU, but now as they try to expand it, the people have demanded it, and they're failing.
[00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:55.874]  The leader of France's ruling party has proudly admitted that Sunday's referendum on the European Constitution will result in a no vote, throwing Europe into turmoil.
[00:02:56.255 --> 00:03:01.616]  The thing is lost, Nicholas Sarkozy told French ministers during an ill-tempered meeting.
[00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:06.298]  It will be little no or big no, he has quoted as telling
[00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:13.351]  Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the Prime Minister, whom he accused of leading a feeble campaign.
[00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:22.879]  In and out of the United Nations, Bill Clinton in, the rumblings have been going on for four years, and now they've hit fever pitch.
[00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.423]  We'll also get into Feds shut down websites in piracy crackdown.
[00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:33.207]  And guess who they dispatched as their storm troopers to do it?
[00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:40.756]  Homeland Security dealing with Internet Piracy.
[00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:44.877]  Just like they visit Rubik's Cube sellers and hot dealers.
[00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:47.998]  Now downloading movies.
[00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:50.439]  Downloading Star Wars.
[00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:54.020]  Classic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.761]  Absolutely classic.
[00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:56.581]  An article here out of
[00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.708]  WLTV, KWWL-TV News 7.
[00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.111]  New leads implicate CIA government officials in child prostitution ring.
[00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:11.633]  When do the probes not lead to that?
[00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:13.214]  And then probably end.
[00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:19.157]  Librarian refuses to turn over a list of users who checked out Bin Laden book.
[00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:21.618]  I mean, who wouldn't check out books about Bin Laden?
[00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:23.561]  People are doing reports on it.
[00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:25.642]  Oh no, you may be with Al Qaeda.
[00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:30.443]  Monsanto law will take away right to ban GMOs and make you eat them!
[00:04:31.663 --> 00:04:32.123]  Yes!
[00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:34.963]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:37.104]  Big broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:38.504]  1-800-259-9231 I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:39.844]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:40.744]  Again, that number, 1-800-259-9231
[00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.492]  Websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:57.373]  Now, Marshalllaw911.info.
[00:04:57.753 --> 00:04:58.953]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:05.475]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:10.097]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:14.638]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:15.999]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:17.760]  Hammered!
[00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:22.025]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:29.013]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:31.136]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:41.940]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.522]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.022 --> 00:05:51.224]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:51.764 --> 00:05:53.064]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.148]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:08.251]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:13.634]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:16.476]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove
[00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:17.117]  We're good to go!
[00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:44.202]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.483 --> 00:06:53.509]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:54.710]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.791]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.044]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:13.733]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[00:07:13.953 --> 00:07:15.975]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.
[00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:21.481]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:27.988]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:32.513]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.355]  Here's Cheryl G. in California.
[00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:41.043]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do without an exercise in two to three years.
[00:07:41.363 --> 00:07:47.905]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid Quell is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at QuellDirect.com.
[00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:51.666]  Quell your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:54.987]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:07:55.087 --> 00:07:58.308]  Quell is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.
[00:07:58.509 --> 00:07:59.689]  Individual results may vary.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.523]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:17.008]  It is Thursday, 26th of May, 05, my friends.
[00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:19.350]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:29.055]  But before we get into the EU expansion going down in flames, good news there, but the government says it's just going to reintroduce it yet again.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.201]  And all the latest police state news and information.
[00:08:33.421 --> 00:08:34.582]  Let's get into this first.
[00:08:35.402 --> 00:08:36.463]  You've been drafted!
[00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:38.563]  Uncle Sam wants you for the War on Drugs.
[00:08:39.124 --> 00:08:43.305]  Congress is debating legislation right now that would draft you into the War on Drugs.
[00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:50.268]  The legislation would require you to spy on all your family members and neighbors, including going undercover and wearing a wire if needed.
[00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:51.529]  Without pay, of course.
[00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:58.928]  Refusing to become a spy for the government would be punishable by mandatory prison sentence of at least two years.
[00:08:59.388 --> 00:09:01.529]  And again, folks, that's in the New Patriot Act.
[00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:10.934]  Here's how to spy, and this is in a separate bill, so that, see, it's like a sub firing ten torpedoes, knowing one or two will hit.
[00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:14.255]  They duplicate stuff even in
[00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:20.651]  Bills by themselves it'll repeat things three or four times, then they'll have other bills doing the same thing.
[00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:25.116]  Here's how the spy section of HR 1528 works.
[00:09:25.256 --> 00:09:30.862]  If you witness certain drug offenses taking place, or learn that they took place, you would have to...
[00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:40.993]  Report the offenses to law enforcement within 24 hours and provide full assistance in the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of the people involved.
[00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:47.659]  Failure to do so would be a crime punishable by a misdemeanor two-year prison sentence.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.543]  And I have the bill here brought forward by Lord Sensenbrenner.
[00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:55.805]  Section 2 of H.R.
[00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:56.626]  1528, any person who violates
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:15.791]  Subsection A of this section, knowing that the manufacture, distribution, storage, or use of any controlled substance involves or is intended to involve a person under the age of eighteen or in the competent person shall be fined not more than two million dollars.
[00:10:16.872 --> 00:10:25.258]  If the offender is an individual and not more than eight million dollars, if the offender is an organization, an imprisonment,
[00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:29.190]  than not less than five years or more than life.
[00:10:29.771 --> 00:10:43.479]  And if the defendant is the parent or guardian or otherwise responsible for the care or supervision of such a person shall be fined as provided in the paragraph and imprisoned not less than ten years or more than life.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.242]  And this isn't enough for you to take action.
[00:10:48.383 --> 00:10:50.884]  I'm afraid that it's over for freedom.
[00:10:51.264 --> 00:10:53.506]  Face it, we're now a communist country
[00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:01.576]  If, on the other hand, you have value your freedom and that of your children, then spread this around to everyone you know as soon as you're able.
[00:11:02.117 --> 00:11:04.779]  Hold your representative and inspire others to call the representative.
[00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:11.605]  If we do not stop these freedom-robbing scum, like Simpson Brenner, then they'll continue to rob us of our freedom.
[00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:18.971]  Get off of your hind ends and do something or wet your tongue to lick the hands that bind you with chains!
[00:11:21.253 --> 00:11:22.234]  And, uh, folks,
[00:11:23.258 --> 00:11:34.044]  I clicked through and did read the legislation at GovernmentTrack.us and it indeed says this, and there's similar stuff across the board, not just quote for people under 18.
[00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:39.167]  I mean, it never ends.
[00:11:39.547 --> 00:11:41.228]  Look, they're building more and more prisons.
[00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:43.850]  We have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[00:11:44.895 --> 00:12:03.042]  And they're now mostly privately owned, where people build everything you can imagine, manufacturing, telemarketing, customer service, furniture, license plates, computer parts, and all these fools out there, I hear them on talk radio, say, make them evil criminals work!
[00:12:05.804 --> 00:12:11.606]  But what they don't think about is, hmm, I'm competing against millions and millions and millions,
[00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:19.405]  At least 3 million people in prison industries who are working for an average of 20 cents an hour.
[00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:24.230]  Boy, that'll even take my jobs worse than all the illegal aliens.
[00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.532]  And China and India.
[00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:28.474]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:30.977]  And you look at who owns most of these big prisons.
[00:12:32.478 --> 00:13:00.428]  They're the families and the companies linked to shipping in the heroin, the cocaine, then they own the majority stock at the same time, and the drug companies, now trying to pass laws at the state level, already have federally, to forcibly psychologically test and forcibly drug your children with drugs whose molecular makeup, whose molecules are even more toxic and deadly than heroin and cocaine!
[00:13:02.139 --> 00:13:29.555]  So they're pushing their prescription drugs with one hand and with the other, selling their illegal drugs, and then they call in their mindless idiot storm troopers who get booty, who get a percentage of whatever they grab, out there grabbing our mindless children, and the Hollywood culture tells them drugs is cool and rebellious, the fools use it, they scoop them up, but that's not feeding all the new prisons fast enough.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.901]  That are popping up everywhere.
[00:13:32.462 --> 00:13:34.883]  And so now you didn't report your neighbor!
[00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:37.065]  You didn't report your parents!
[00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:40.668]  You didn't report why drugs fund terrorism!
[00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:49.495]  And so now you'll serve ten to less than life, whatever that means.
[00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:50.196]  That's 45 years.
[00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:54.359]  I mean, does this make you mad?
[00:13:55.603 --> 00:14:10.353]  Are you noticing just the wild, can only be described as bedlam-esque orgy of savage, bloodthirsty supping that's going on on the bones of this country?
[00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:22.922]  The only analogy is the Congress and the executive in the courts are a pack of vampiric, jabberwocky, uh, banshees
[00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:26.249]  Just sucking us dry!
[00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:34.418]  There's blood all over their faces, they're leering at us with their fangs, their glowing yellow eyes going, We love you, we're the government!
[00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:37.361]  Just submit to us!
[00:14:38.142 --> 00:14:39.544]  I mean, that's what's happening here!
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:58.648]  They are garbing their forces in black uniforms and masks, and Nazi karst helmets, their armored vehicles drive back and forth on the roads, huge checkpoints are being set up, toll roads everywhere, genetically engineered food, DU being used everywhere, splattering the planet with uranium as they dance around insanely.
[00:14:59.128 --> 00:15:01.109]  I mean, it's like a Stephen King novel!
[00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.853]  It's as if Satan has been unleashed, and all the candy coated
[00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:15.798]  There's simpering pumps out there telling you how great all this is.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.481]  It makes me want to scream.
[00:15:21.722 --> 00:15:23.143]  I love America.
[00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:24.964]  I love this country.
[00:15:25.465 --> 00:15:26.185]  We live here.
[00:15:26.305 --> 00:15:27.326]  Our children live here.
[00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:32.492]  Imagine what our forebears, looking down from heaven, think of all of this.
[00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:34.754]  I mean, this is a travesty.
[00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:54.251]  A pack of organized criminals is just running around wildly, looting the economy, looting the pension funds, running up giant deficits, foaming at the mouth, paying themselves with giant government contracts in the trillions of dollars in the last five years in the aggregate.
[00:15:54.984 --> 00:16:05.006]  It is just a rending, raping process, and I have to watch them up there smiling at us in their $2,000 suits, telling us how they've got more freedom for us!
[00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:12.748]  And they're reorganizing this country into this empire, but we're nothing more than a unit of the EU.
[00:16:13.228 --> 00:16:15.628]  While we take all the blame, they get all the control.
[00:16:15.648 --> 00:16:20.149]  A lot of good things are happening, though.
[00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.089]  I mean, they've got to go into their final phases.
[00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:24.670]  They've got to get the public to acquiesce and to buy into it.
[00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:26.713]  And I don't see that happening.
[00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.774]  People are not buying into it.
[00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:32.554]  People still buy part of the illusion, part of the equation, part of the fraud.
[00:16:33.454 --> 00:16:38.055]  The people that have woken up don't know they're the majority and feel like they're alone and feel like they're powerless.
[00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:39.875]  And believe me, you're not powerless.
[00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:52.938]  But I think we're approaching the date when the globalists will detonate a nuke, when they will release smallpox, when they will kick it up a notch, a lot more than a notch, up to the 10th power.
[00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:59.974]  I think they'll fail in doing that, but at the same time, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
[00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:02.216]  And it's just sad.
[00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:18.405]  It's very sad that a sector of the population, generally those in elite positions, even petty elite positions that think they're part of the system, will defend this parasitic, cancerous monstrosity.
[00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:20.926]  Let's go to calls, then we'll get back into the news.
[00:17:21.286 --> 00:17:22.607]  Martin, Texas, go ahead.
[00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:33.137]  Hey Alex, I was just calling to try and find out, well I had a question too, but I wanted to find out if on your movie tour that you're going to be doing, if you knew yet when you were going to be in Houston.
[00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:48.224]  Well I think I mentioned I might show it at other theaters around Texas, but I am just, that's so many irons in the fire I don't know if I'm going to do that, but I might show it in Houston, might show it in San Antonio and Dallas.
[00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:50.297]  Well, we'd love to see you here.
[00:17:50.377 --> 00:17:54.780]  It was a really great time when you came down and showed us the martial law of 9-1-1.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.402]  Or no, I'm sorry, 9-1-1, the road to tyranny.
[00:17:58.763 --> 00:18:00.924]  Yeah, so many tyrannies, so many martial laws.
[00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:07.228]  But yeah, there's a good chance I've just got to set that up and do all the legwork.
[00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:08.629]  But I'd like to do that.
[00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.530]  Alright, well, on to my question.
[00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:17.155]  You know, I've been listening to you for a long time and I've done a lot of personal research on occultism and the Illuminati.
[00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:24.425]  And I really wanted your personal opinion on how organized is it at the top.
[00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:33.534]  You know, I know you can't quantifiably prove how organized it is, but I mean, does it really go as far as... No, we can quantify it.
[00:18:34.735 --> 00:18:40.200]  Well, I mean, how organized... I mean, do you really... do you think that it really is the satanic, luciferian religion?
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.280]  Yes.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:40.480]  Yes.
[00:18:42.709 --> 00:18:51.456]  They cultivate multiple personalities to basically have front personalities to deal with society, and then behind closed doors it's just absolutely evil?
[00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:53.517]  Yes.
[00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:55.679]  Okay.
[00:18:56.179 --> 00:19:02.323]  Well, if you'd like to elaborate on what you do willing to talk about that, I'll go ahead and listen.
[00:19:02.343 --> 00:19:03.644]  Well, he's not willing to talk about it.
[00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:10.589]  It's a big, complex issue, and then to explain to people why this is the case, but you've got about 15 families,
[00:19:12.222 --> 00:19:36.894]  Who compete with each other at certain levels, but they also meet in councils, just like, you know, classic Lacosa Nostra does, and decide on how to feed on us, and so they have rules they follow, and they believe they're gods, they believe that it's social Darwinism, that it's the right of kings, the absolute power, unlimited power, to feed on us.
[00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:41.877]  And absolute power means the authority to kill indiscriminately, which is their enjoyment.
[00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:45.322]  How much competition do you think they enact against each other?
[00:19:47.043 --> 00:19:49.824]  Oh, they kill each other and they do things like that.
[00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:51.645]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:52.546]  Keep up the good work.
[00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:53.586]  Alright, thank you.
[00:19:53.986 --> 00:19:57.728]  One of the few things holding them back is their internal wars.
[00:19:58.008 --> 00:20:00.769]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.251]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:06.572]  The real money folks.
[00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.797]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.297 --> 00:20:13.158]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.198 --> 00:20:13.798]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:14.218]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:14.258 --> 00:20:16.720]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.602]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:18.622 --> 00:20:20.083]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:20:20.103 --> 00:20:21.664]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.412]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:10.098]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:21:10.318 --> 00:21:21.587]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:24.469]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.893]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:21:29.093 --> 00:21:31.234]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:31.394 --> 00:21:33.274]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:33.474 --> 00:21:39.496]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:45.418]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.421]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:13.328 --> 00:22:23.001]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:30.511]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[00:23:01.374 --> 00:23:04.736]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:23:04.997 --> 00:23:05.337]  Why?
[00:23:05.657 --> 00:23:08.279]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:13.302]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:23:13.442 --> 00:23:23.149]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:31.214]  We're good to go!
[00:24:01.634 --> 00:24:19.520]  Look, these ancient secret societies go back into the midst of time.
[00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:27.143]  And they believe in the occult, then they believe in it now, and it's also a social tool of control.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.002]  So perhaps later I'll have time to get into that, but let's go back to your calls.
[00:24:31.502 --> 00:24:32.323]  Ken in Texas.
[00:24:32.343 --> 00:24:32.963]  Ken, go ahead.
[00:24:33.363 --> 00:24:33.964]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:24:33.984 --> 00:24:35.224]  This is Ken in Paris, Texas.
[00:24:35.244 --> 00:24:35.685]  Welcome.
[00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:36.205]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:36.585]  Thank you.
[00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:41.008]  I was just calling this morning because kind of leading into what you had to say before you opened up the lines for callers.
[00:24:42.618 --> 00:24:46.740]  I guess I'm seeing to a degree somewhat a few people starting to wake up and ask questions also.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:58.545]  I was in a local retail establishment not long ago and met one of our instructors at Paris Junior College who has his master's degree from Texas A&M University and he was talking about how he was disgusted with the war in Iraq and that he wasn't going to send his son off to war.
[00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:02.787]  And I realized that a lot of critical thinkers are starting to wake up and realize things are not going well.
[00:25:02.807 --> 00:25:06.569]  Now boy, that's a Texas A&M... Texas A&M University, yes, your graduate.
[00:25:06.709 --> 00:25:09.510]  And I mean that's almost like a neocon cult.
[00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:14.191]  I'm not bashing A&M, but they're very conservative and I know a lot of them are waking up.
[00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:14.972]  Right.
[00:25:15.332 --> 00:25:18.376]  And I didn't bring up the topic about geopolitics at all.
[00:25:18.437 --> 00:25:22.002]  He simply brought it up himself and said it sounds like it's going to go up to fighting wars and a foreign war.
[00:25:23.348 --> 00:25:23.608]  I don't know.
[00:25:41.188 --> 00:25:43.870]  Uh, deception, so to speak, about our economy being fine.
[00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:53.975]  But I guess what I'm asking is, and this is kind of leading into what you had to say, with people starting to wake up more so and more so, I get the impression, I think you've all almost alluded to it at times in the past also when I listened to you in the past,
[00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:04.792]  There's going to come a critical point here, a pivotal point here pretty soon, probably when the globalists understand to, like you said, to forward their agenda, to get to where they want to go, and basically bring in the overwhelming force to make it happen.
[00:26:04.852 --> 00:26:09.713]  I hate to say these words, but I've thought about it many times over and heard many broadcasters on the shortwave say the same thing.
[00:26:09.733 --> 00:26:14.414]  They're going to have to basically carry out the next phase, which would probably be multiple attacks or an attack here in the U.S.
[00:26:14.454 --> 00:26:16.894]  of A. to bring us into an absolutely pleasing slave state here in the U.S.
[00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:20.115]  of A. So I guess what I'm trying to say or ask is, basically, is this.
[00:26:20.655 --> 00:26:24.958]  Pulling up on your expertise, what kind of time frame do you look at before things like that are going to happen again?
[00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:27.199]  I don't know.
[00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:40.528]  I mean, I know that if we wouldn't have been out here exposing the problem-reaction-solution psychology, so people then would have a mass awakening and understanding to it, that they would have already carried out more attacks.
[00:26:41.128 --> 00:26:44.751]  If they could have forced the medical workers and police and firefighters to take
[00:26:45.347 --> 00:26:56.292]  The smallpox shot, I believe that they would have then had the enforcers to force us to take it, and under that smokescreen, they put in the forced inoculation centers in every major city, they're still going ahead with it.
[00:26:57.133 --> 00:27:09.038]  They would have then already launched an attack, and under the smokescreen of that panic, put in even greater draconian controls, and basically said, we can't allow criticism anymore, it aids Al Qaeda.
[00:27:09.398 --> 00:27:13.080]  Which Ashcroft and others had tried to say, even in Senate testimony.
[00:27:14.308 --> 00:27:16.629]  But I do think that it's a catch-22 for them.
[00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:22.172]  If they carry out an attack, I think it's going to backfire on them, no matter how devastating it is.
[00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:26.994]  And if they don't carry out an attack, they're losing all credibility.
[00:27:27.134 --> 00:27:28.595]  Everybody is starting to wake up.
[00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:39.459]  So, it's a very sophisticated question, but I lean towards the globalists going ahead with an attack, and I tend to think it's going to be massive.
[00:27:39.479 --> 00:27:40.300]  It will dwarf
[00:27:41.174 --> 00:27:41.736]  9-11.
[00:27:42.217 --> 00:27:44.986]  They could lead up to it with some smaller attacks.
[00:27:45.982 --> 00:27:51.284]  That's why it's so important person-to-person, man-to-woman, woman-to-man, neighbor-to-neighbor.
[00:27:52.084 --> 00:27:55.085]  Everybody's got to go, hey listen, here's the facts, they're behind it.
[00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:56.405]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:27:56.906 --> 00:28:09.430]  Even if that neighbor laughs at you at the time, later you've planted that seed of rebellion against this empire so that if they do carry out the next attack, it's going to backfire on them.
[00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.611]  But they've got social architects and a lot of experts with very high IQs
[00:28:14.231 --> 00:28:16.893]  Who are studying all this right now, and I think they know that.
[00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:19.514]  And they're delicately balancing what they're going to do.
[00:28:19.554 --> 00:28:29.699]  They may just keep trying to trek along with Patriot 2.5 and with all this, if you don't tattle on your neighbor, you know, ten years in prison, eight million dollar fine.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.721]  They may just keep, you know, trying to ratchet all of that up.
[00:28:34.182 --> 00:28:35.963]  But 9-11 is the precursor.
[00:28:36.103 --> 00:28:36.583]  It is the
[00:28:37.648 --> 00:28:44.412]  Hammer hitting the cap, firing the bullet out the barrel, and the next big attack will be the bullet hitting America in the head.
[00:28:45.032 --> 00:28:54.877]  And so if we don't have this huge awakening now, because under this total tyranny, then they can take all the pension funds, then they can, you know, really have the draft, then we can really be their slaves.
[00:28:55.578 --> 00:29:01.461]  We can have peace, as they call it, and security, and so that's really
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.371]  I don't think they know what they're going to do at this time.
[00:29:05.391 --> 00:29:12.176]  They've got several different programs running simultaneously and things are not going as they planned at many different levels.
[00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.758]  Well, I was just wondering how you felt about that.
[00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:26.505]  I know because, I don't know, I kind of get the same impression from other people I listen to that I can trust on shortwave like Steve Quayle seems to believe that basically the next time they pull something it's going to be a multiple attack type situation using overwhelming force of sorts.
[00:29:27.446 --> 00:29:28.927]  I appreciate your response, Alex.
[00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:30.280]  Well, thank you.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.664]  I mean, imagine how they'll re-engineer society if a city gets new, smallpox gets released.
[00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:40.948]  And they'll tell the yuppies, you'll keep your money if you just go along with us.
[00:29:41.028 --> 00:29:43.350]  And they'll go, yes, yes, arrest my neighbor!
[00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:44.351]  He's with them!
[00:29:44.551 --> 00:29:45.312]  He's with them!
[00:29:45.372 --> 00:29:45.912]  Get them!

[00:29:47.254 --> 00:29:50.436]  We need to point out, though, hey, you ordered the Border Patrol to stand down government.
[00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:52.638]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:54.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.621 --> 00:29:58.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.939 --> 00:30:04.539]  You've heard it over and over again.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.240]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.221]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:16.382]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[00:30:16.722 --> 00:30:17.423]  Don't wait for when.
[00:30:17.663 --> 00:30:18.783]  It's important to act now.

[00:31:14.058 --> 00:31:18.581]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a white Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.661 --> 00:31:29.987]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:37.437]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:39.961]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.462 --> 00:31:45.429]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:33:02.293 --> 00:33:08.936]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:23.583]  The globalists are really getting down to the final pieces of their puzzle, but
[00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:47.752]  It took them so long to put it together that they lost a couple of the pieces and the other ones are frayed and marred and there's little holes that have been eaten through it and a lot of their own people are starting to get cold feet and a lot of the fools that went along with it for personal power are beginning to really see the end of the road and beginning to see how many of their own minions have been betrayed.
[00:33:49.964 --> 00:34:01.633]  And so, as they get America hung up there like a hog by its hind legs, about to be gutted and have its throat slit, a lot of minions of the system are getting cold feet-y.
[00:34:03.774 --> 00:34:04.575]  And that's good.
[00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:09.218]  But the globalists continue to just accelerate their programming.
[00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:13.822]  It's kind of like, you know, an Indianapolis 500, and they're on the last ten laps.
[00:34:15.003 --> 00:34:18.085]  And the New World Order is in the lead.
[00:34:19.045 --> 00:34:21.867]  And they've had the pole position since the start of the race.
[00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:34.618]  But their vehicle is vibrating, parts are falling off of it, the engine is starting to whine and thump, and they're about to throw a rod any minute.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:45.227]  And every bit of pressure we put on every person we wake up, every time we're bold, no matter how outlandish the truth sounds, every time we just throw down the gauntlet,
[00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:48.866]  And go, you murdering organized criminals, we know what you are!
[00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:51.027]  You're a pack of lying scum!
[00:34:52.928 --> 00:34:59.750]  They'll try to growl at us and intimidate us and go around doing their secret arrest and their intimidation to try to scare the rest of us.
[00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.191]  It doesn't work, folks.
[00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:04.832]  The safest course is going head-on against these people.
[00:35:05.872 --> 00:35:15.156]  The safest course is just going 110 percent, being attacked by a degenerate bully, a sadist, and just stand up!
[00:35:15.908 --> 00:35:19.130]  Go out in the light, don't cower in the shadows, hoping they won't get you.
[00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.892]  You got fight and flight, my friends.
[00:35:21.952 --> 00:35:22.793]  It's time to fight.
[00:35:25.174 --> 00:35:29.477]  And a lot of people I hear them calling to shows, we need to quit talking and have some action!
[00:35:29.497 --> 00:35:34.280]  You know, it's time to stop just shooting our mouths up.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.661]  I've heard those same callers for years.
[00:35:36.922 --> 00:35:38.242]  It's like they're paid or something.
[00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:41.805]  Calling into shows, you know, talking like this.
[00:35:43.422 --> 00:35:45.703]  But I don't ever see them involved in, quote, action.
[00:35:45.763 --> 00:35:47.764]  Well, I mean, what do you think talking is?
[00:35:48.504 --> 00:35:49.384]  That is action.
[00:35:49.444 --> 00:35:54.266]  The pen is mightier than the sword, the old saying goes, and it's true.
[00:35:55.066 --> 00:35:58.628]  Why do you think the Pentagon spends tens of billions a year on propaganda?
[00:35:59.388 --> 00:36:04.450]  They say that 90% of a war is in the battlefield of the mind.
[00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:18.601]  So understand, folks, that I'm hearing a lot of ringers, a lot of provocateurs right now, and then other canaries that pick up the call, other mockingbirds.
[00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:26.888]  And, you know, when you hear this talk, people shooting their mouths off about lining up federal judges and getting the president and all this.
[00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:29.611]  No, we do not want to be violent.
[00:36:29.651 --> 00:36:31.212]  The president is a complete puppet.
[00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:33.855]  I wish him long days and pleasant nights.
[00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:38.393]  Until he meets his maker, and then, believe me, vengeance is God's.
[00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:39.954]  Bush is a puppet.
[00:36:39.974 --> 00:36:41.034]  Bill Clinton's a puppet.
[00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:44.497]  These federal judges are unhappy little grasping puppets.
[00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:47.078]  And I do want them to go to jail.
[00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.299]  I do want them to be tried.
[00:36:48.319 --> 00:36:53.842]  I do want them to be exposed, but people running around shooting their mouths off.
[00:36:53.902 --> 00:36:58.245]  I know people who are public who shoot their mouths off like this, and nothing happens to them.
[00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:03.848]  Believe me, folks, if you're not a fed and you do that, you will be instantly arrested.
[00:37:04.845 --> 00:37:05.726]  Instantly.
[00:37:07.447 --> 00:37:19.915]  So, I do want to put out a little advisement, a little travel advisement on the happy road into the bowels of the New World Order, that they are pulling out the stops right now.
[00:37:20.576 --> 00:37:24.358]  They want to provocateur something so bad they can taste it.
[00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.520]  Violence isn't the answer.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.621]  The globalists have to blow up their own buildings.
[00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:30.883]  They have to carry out their own terror attacks.
[00:37:30.903 --> 00:37:32.304]  Their own documents explain why.
[00:37:32.624 --> 00:37:34.225]  But then blame it on their political enemies.
[00:37:35.129 --> 00:37:37.570]  Now, I said offensive violence.
[00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:49.674]  Whatever type of criminal is out there, whatever shade or whatever fancy hat they wear, if you have to defend your life or your children's lives, do whatever you have to.
[00:37:52.115 --> 00:37:55.076]  But that is totally different from offensive.
[00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:11.253]  But when it comes to defense, believe me folks, for those of you out there, if we don't expose the globalists and don't do our jobs properly, and maybe even if we do that, there's going to come a time when all the talkers are going to have their chance.
[00:38:12.154 --> 00:38:15.737]  When you're not going to need to get orders from headquarters, you're going to know.
[00:38:15.757 --> 00:38:20.060]  And we are racing towards that point.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.843]  And the plan is for this government to lose that fight.
[00:38:23.963 --> 00:38:24.584]  I hope you know that.
[00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:29.230]  Yes, the plan is for the government to lose that fight.
[00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:36.857]  The plan is for the police dead bodies to pile up like so many pieces of cordwood in the streets.
[00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:47.647]  And then they're going to bust this country wide open, and they're going to bring in foreign troops, and it's going to get even worse.
[00:38:48.983 --> 00:38:59.688]  And in our supposed victory will be our defeat because they just want this country to be a balkanized, separatist, broken up cesspit like Iraq has been turned into.
[00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:02.629]  So I'm trying to avert that as well.
[00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:12.493]  They already in their own official army documents say that this country is going to break down, they're going to have separatists in the southwest,
[00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:18.182]  They're going to have the people breaking off in Canada, the French, and I'm not even bashing the French.
[00:39:18.642 --> 00:39:29.624]  The point is, is that this is the plan, and we'll be out of the equation, my friends, and the EU will then be the answer who sat out on the bench while controlling us as their bad cop.
[00:39:31.464 --> 00:39:33.004]  You want to know what I see in the future?
[00:39:33.044 --> 00:39:36.445]  That's what I see, and it's a sad, sad testament.
[00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:38.685]  Don't worry.
[00:39:38.765 --> 00:39:42.186]  Look, look, look, they could have made their tyranny much more palatable, much slicker.
[00:39:43.007 --> 00:39:45.569]  But on purpose, they've made it overtly evil.
[00:39:46.029 --> 00:39:54.275]  They've overtly lied and said they killed Al Sakari three times and captured him three times and injured him three times.
[00:39:54.535 --> 00:39:56.917]  They openly let the Pat Tillman stuff come out.
[00:39:57.217 --> 00:40:00.419]  They openly let the Private Lynch stuff come out.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.582]  They openly have let all the 9-11 information come out.
[00:40:03.862 --> 00:40:08.685]  They openly are lying on purpose and putting it in PMAC documents and then getting caught.
[00:40:10.226 --> 00:40:12.348]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:15.933]  To destroy America.
[00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:23.056]  They openly let me operate and do what I'm doing.
[00:40:24.637 --> 00:40:27.839]  Oh, the globalists in this country, the mid-level minions, hate me.
[00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:35.783]  But their masters think they can play this very sophisticated triple game with you, wheels within wheels.
[00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:38.304]  And I hope you're sophisticated enough to see it.
[00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:47.869]  I hope you understand that they realize they can't contain the truth, so they might as well try to guide it and manipulate it and desensitize you.
[00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:55.475]  But by being aware of that, and by being aware of their arrogance and false aplomb, they may fail.
[00:40:56.355 --> 00:40:57.916]  If we ask God for guidance.
[00:40:59.277 --> 00:41:02.280]  Because things never in history go the way they want them to.
[00:41:03.121 --> 00:41:16.753]  They believe with their computers and their complex algorithms to track societies and psychological, sociological developments that they can guide and manipulate this, but there's always unseen aberrations in any situation.
[00:41:17.774 --> 00:41:27.502]  And I believe the human spirit inspired by God will shine through, and I believe they're going to fail in getting their full plans implemented.
[00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:32.261]  But they already have society captured.
[00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:44.911]  The question is will we be able to struggle out of their grasp before the dehumanization intensifies and scars the human psyche and soul even further than it's already been irreparably damaged.
[00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:48.353]  Irreparably!
[00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:55.079]  Alright, I'm getting a little bit too much into the future and into
[00:41:56.658 --> 00:42:23.432]  more of the esoteric nature of what we face but these are the truths that I know that I'm trying to share but it is a great encouragement to see them pulling out all the stops, flaunting it in our face unleashing their disinfo agents by the horde by the legion they are behind four or five years and now they're trying to accelerate
[00:42:24.684 --> 00:42:30.265]  In fact, they're about to lose their pole position to take the pole to win.
[00:42:30.845 --> 00:42:40.927]  From their citadels, from their conning towers, as they scan, they know that their system is breaking down and they know that we're about to pass them.
[00:42:42.348 --> 00:42:45.528]  And so they've begun getting more and more reckless.
[00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:53.130]  But when their engine blows, will they spin out
[00:42:53.877 --> 00:42:57.600]  And will we all collide into them into a fiery inferno?
[00:42:58.621 --> 00:42:59.662]  Yes, I think so.
[00:43:00.783 --> 00:43:14.014]  And will they be able to grasp victory from the jaws of defeat by using that crisis to create a false solution and a new reign of terror like the French Revolution?
[00:43:15.115 --> 00:43:16.436]  I believe that's their plan.
[00:43:16.477 --> 00:43:21.401]  So we've got to guard against those individuals.
[00:43:23.297 --> 00:43:29.119]  It is a almost religious sacrament now to bash Jews.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.961]  It is extravagantly popular.
[00:43:36.082 --> 00:43:40.464]  It is done from almost every root top.
[00:43:40.724 --> 00:43:41.544]  People love it.
[00:43:41.844 --> 00:43:44.125]  It's the most popular thing to talk about.
[00:43:45.566 --> 00:43:51.968]  I hear the individuals out there, the grand poobahs of it, relishing it as if they are giving you some great truth.
[00:43:52.794 --> 00:43:54.995]  That can overturn the New World Order.
[00:43:56.036 --> 00:44:04.261]  And so now let me in a few minutes try to navigate you through this, and if you don't agree with me that's fine, and then we'll go to your calls.
[00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:07.202]  Let me explain.
[00:44:09.724 --> 00:44:17.948]  The Zionists are a small client cult of the inner ring of the New World Order.
[00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:18.989]  They are servants
[00:44:20.618 --> 00:44:27.982]  And this goes back to a thousand years ago in Europe, where you could only be Christian or you would be killed.
[00:44:29.103 --> 00:44:38.248]  But the Jews were able to say, no, we're the same God, we follow the same God, but we can keep our beliefs.
[00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:41.590]  And so the nobles of the day said, very well.
[00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.593]  And then allowed them to engage in banking when no one else was allowed to engage in banking.
[00:44:49.091 --> 00:45:13.111]  And then they would become very corrupt, again, not the majority of Jews, but the elite Jews, who themselves were not even really Jews, they were not from the Middle East, they were a European sect, that during the Crusades was told, when the Muslims came in, you can worship Islam, or we're going to kill you, and they said, no, how about we adopt Judaism while you accept that, and they did.
[00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:25.933]  And so that group always fostered and loved scapegoating the real Jews and worked with some of the corrupt nobles to then burn those groups and defeat upon them.
[00:45:26.733 --> 00:45:35.981]  And I have Zionist documents from 200 years ago, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, 100 years ago, where they worked with the Nazis, this is public, and said it's a great thing.
[00:45:36.661 --> 00:45:39.043]  Persecution makes us stronger.
[00:45:39.584 --> 00:45:43.147]  It makes the Jews under us follow their orders.
[00:45:45.803 --> 00:45:48.024]  It compacts them under our control.
[00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:50.525]  So we can manipulate them.
[00:45:51.005 --> 00:45:55.507]  Just like the created terror threat of today gets us under the control of the federal government.
[00:45:55.887 --> 00:45:56.927]  It's the same system.
[00:46:00.028 --> 00:46:01.849]  And so they helped Hitler.
[00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:02.909]  They loved Hitler.
[00:46:03.089 --> 00:46:05.190]  They supported Hitler.
[00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:18.606]  And they love it today when people get up there and call Jews names and say Jews are the center of evil, because then that actually compacts Jews even more under this small group's control.
[00:46:20.566 --> 00:46:28.309]  And so then when Jews hear you talk about a New World Order and attach that it's a Jewish conspiracy to it, they then go out and fight for the New World Order.
[00:46:28.949 --> 00:46:32.891]  And become minions of it, thinking that it must be good.
[00:46:36.075 --> 00:46:39.377]  But all they are is one client group of the New World Order.
[00:46:39.737 --> 00:46:43.279]  The New World Order is satanic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.381]  Take Christianity.
[00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:48.562]  Christianity gets stronger when it's persecuted.
[00:46:48.582 --> 00:46:49.082]  You know that.
[00:46:49.142 --> 00:47:03.910]  Well, it's the same thing with the Zionists, who feed upon real Judaism, and feed upon the Orthodox Jews, and take their children, the CPS in Israel, and abuse them, and go after them.
[00:47:07.176 --> 00:47:10.197]  So it's just the same thing over and over again.
[00:47:10.237 --> 00:47:19.078]  So people ask me, you know, I'll expose Israel when they're doing corrupt things, when they're carrying out terror attacks, and Israel will blame it on their enemies, and that's even in mainstream Jewish newspapers.
[00:47:19.098 --> 00:47:19.858]  They've been caught doing it.
[00:47:20.519 --> 00:47:23.439]  But to sit there and say, Jews run it all.
[00:47:24.719 --> 00:47:26.160]  Jews are the heart of it.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.160]  Jews, Jews, Jews.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.660]  Folks, when you hear that, most people doing it are useful idiots.
[00:47:30.961 --> 00:47:33.361]  They're actually carrying out the New World Order's program.
[00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:37.499]  They don't want people coming together against dehumanization.
[00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:41.680]  They want us all balkanized, fractured, fighting with each other.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.861]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[00:47:44.881 --> 00:47:49.062]  So that's one more example of wheels within wheels.
[00:47:49.082 --> 00:47:58.845]  I mean, every time you get to the highest levels of the New World Order, you find devil worshippers, you find Nazis, and you find Zionists.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:09.187]  And they're in control of the Protestants, they're in control of the Catholics, they're in control of many of the other religious groups out there.
[00:48:09.687 --> 00:48:13.791]  They are in control, and it's horrible.
[00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:21.057]  But just because Bugsy Siegel was a Jewish mobster, that doesn't mean all Jews are bad.
[00:48:21.638 --> 00:48:23.119]  They're organized criminals.
[00:48:25.441 --> 00:48:27.363]  And this needs to be exposed.
[00:48:29.088 --> 00:48:30.749]  Because what they do is indefensible.
[00:48:31.089 --> 00:48:34.671]  But at the same time, the Arabs are involved.
[00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:36.912]  The Saudis are involved at the highest levels of this.
[00:48:36.972 --> 00:48:38.613]  They go to the Bilderberg Group meetings.
[00:48:39.154 --> 00:48:40.814]  It's all a big joke to them.
[00:48:41.275 --> 00:48:42.495]  They manipulate you.
[00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:45.537]  And the Arabs are a big part of it.
[00:48:47.338 --> 00:48:52.361]  Radical Islam didn't even exist to any real degree
[00:48:53.793 --> 00:48:59.838]  50, 60 years ago but our CIA funded it and energized it in the name of a counterbalance to communism.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:12.068]  They create the movements and then they create the other movements to counter those movements and they play those forces off against each other.
[00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:21.216]  If we can just agree to love liberty and freedom and to love God and to stand up for what's right
[00:49:22.017 --> 00:49:34.664]  And be constitutionalist, and get past the Republican, the Democrat labels, the Black, the La Raza, La Reconquista, the White Supremacist, all of you are funded by the same people!
[00:49:35.604 --> 00:49:39.626]  You flow from the bowels of Hades itself!
[00:49:42.828 --> 00:49:45.509]  Alright, let's go back to the calls.
[00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:48.751]  Who's up next, Dan in Texas?
[00:49:50.643 --> 00:49:51.904]  Oh, Jim in Pennsylvania.
[00:49:51.924 --> 00:49:52.464]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:49:52.944 --> 00:49:53.624]  Hey, Dillon, Alex.
[00:49:53.864 --> 00:49:59.867]  I had a question about... I've seen all your films, from America Destroyed by Design, all the way to Marshall Law.
[00:49:59.887 --> 00:50:00.427]  Well, thank you!
[00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:03.229]  Yeah, very good films, very educational.
[00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:08.711]  And clearly, Rise of the Police Station... Are you there, sir?
[00:50:09.952 --> 00:50:11.212]  Ah, his cordless went down.
[00:50:14.114 --> 00:50:14.994]  We just lost everything?
[00:50:15.034 --> 00:50:15.694]  Am I still on the air?
[00:50:16.815 --> 00:50:17.215]  Oh, good!
[00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:20.970]  I guess that T1 line went down?
[00:50:23.131 --> 00:50:24.512]  But no alarms going off.
[00:50:24.532 --> 00:50:25.193]  Well, that's good.
[00:50:26.614 --> 00:50:28.636]  Well, all the callers can call back in.
[00:50:28.656 --> 00:50:30.397]  This happens a couple times a year.
[00:50:30.417 --> 00:50:32.218]  It's always enjoyable.
[00:50:35.701 --> 00:50:38.904]  So, did that end up in a few minutes?
[00:50:39.893 --> 00:50:43.794]  We'll give them that backup number they can call, but I think callers can only call two at a time then.
[00:50:46.035 --> 00:50:48.136]  Ah, when it rains it pours.
[00:50:48.396 --> 00:50:53.977]  Well, maybe God just wants me to get on my soapbox for a couple hours.
[00:50:54.798 --> 00:50:56.718]  Maybe that's what I'm supposed to do today.
[00:50:56.738 --> 00:50:58.879]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.993]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:06.276]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:10.320]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:14.604]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.944 --> 00:51:18.708]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.808 --> 00:51:20.650]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.153]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.193 --> 00:51:28.917]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.057 --> 00:51:32.120]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.142]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.643 --> 00:51:41.768]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.288 --> 00:51:46.069]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:54:06.104 --> 00:54:11.346]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:18.968 --> 00:54:27.330]  Alright, the phone system's coming up and down, so I'm sure they'll get it in operational order soon, hopefully, I pray.
[00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.831]  Then we can go back to your calls, load the phone lines back up and take calls.
[00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:35.713]  But I got a ton of news here that's really important, so we'll start into that.
[00:54:36.775 --> 00:54:37.736]  Here momentarily.
[00:54:38.676 --> 00:54:46.621]  I'm going to be showing my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, at three separate showings on two different dates.
[00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:49.703]  Two showings on Friday, June 3rd.
[00:54:50.483 --> 00:54:51.384]  Eight days away.
[00:54:52.184 --> 00:55:00.750]  Friday, June 3rd of next week, Alamo Draft House, downtown Austin, at 7 and 10 p.m.
[00:55:03.932 --> 00:55:07.415]  Two and a half, two hours, thirty-five minutes is the main film.
[00:55:08.056 --> 00:55:14.861]  And I'll have a little short speech at the first and fifteen, twenty minutes of questions after the showing at seven, then we'll show it again.
[00:55:15.962 --> 00:55:18.884]  And people ask me which showing to go to, they're all going to be great.
[00:55:20.285 --> 00:55:23.388]  It's looking like that first showing might even sell out on the internet.
[00:55:24.249 --> 00:55:30.233]  The second one isn't anywhere close to doing that on the internet, but it's substantive, the number of tickets we've already sold.
[00:55:30.634 --> 00:55:33.156]  So go ahead and get your tickets to the first or second showing now.
[00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:40.607]  You could take the missus out to dinner and then go to the 10 o'clock or you could go to the 7 o'clock and eat dinner there.
[00:55:40.627 --> 00:55:41.587]  They've got really good food.
[00:55:43.268 --> 00:55:54.570]  Meet dinner at your table there or the next week where we'll have longer to speak and take questions after the show because it's going to be the only showing that night and the last showing 8 p.m.
[00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.771]  on June 8th, Wednesday June 8th, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:56:02.023 --> 00:56:08.666]  Now, you can get tickets by going to InfoWars.com and linking through to the secure online shopping cart or you can buy tickets at the door to any of the showings.
[00:56:08.726 --> 00:56:15.689]  If any of it sells out the day before the day of the event, I'll post it on the site so you know not to go to a showing that sold out on that Friday.
[00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.310]  So, don't wait folks.
[00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:20.191]  Go ahead and get your tickets at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:20.832 --> 00:56:22.112]  And I hope to see everybody out there.
[00:56:22.132 --> 00:56:22.952]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:56:22.972 --> 00:56:25.394]  And then briefly, you've heard the rave reviews from listeners.
[00:56:26.974 --> 00:56:30.556]  One of the listeners was just trying to plug Marshall Law when the phone system went down.
[00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:33.787]  I always appreciate those plugs, but it really is my best film.
[00:56:34.247 --> 00:56:38.069]  Again, Jeff Rentsch, who's a TV producer and news anchor, said it's the best film he's ever seen.
[00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.330]  Wow, I didn't solicit that comment.
[00:56:41.251 --> 00:56:42.351]  Many others are saying that.
[00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:48.434]  They said that about Road to Tyranny, but now this, quite frankly, makes... I don't want to say Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:48.454 --> 00:56:54.917]  It's not a shadow of it, but it's... Martial law is substantively more powerful.
[00:56:55.766 --> 00:56:56.566]  So please get it.
[00:56:57.006 --> 00:57:08.049]  And the total free number to order it or any of my other great films is 1-888-253-3139-888-253-3139.

[00:57:23.494 --> 00:57:24.374]  It's a pretty good TV show.
[00:57:25.006 --> 00:57:26.126]  Now you can get it nationwide.
[00:57:26.366 --> 00:57:30.107]  A bunch of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, other e-books.

[00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:46.111]  It's very powerful, very effective.
[00:57:47.592 --> 00:57:50.853]  French in disarray as they admit EU treaty vote is lost.
[00:57:50.893 --> 00:57:51.834]  We'll get into that.
[00:57:52.074 --> 00:57:53.575]  EU biometric visa trial.
[00:57:54.275 --> 00:57:56.896]  In and out, Bill Clinton in as UN Secretary General.
[00:57:57.256 --> 00:57:58.076]  More news on that.
[00:57:58.557 --> 00:58:03.199]  Sending Homeland Security after people downloading Hollywood movies online.
[00:58:03.219 --> 00:58:05.139]  Yes, it's terrorism, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:06.280]  Everything's terrorism.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.621]  Why, we only arrest you if you're a terrorist, but every misdemeanor is terrorism.
[00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:11.202]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:58:12.057 --> 00:58:16.259]  New leads implicate CIA government officials and child prostitution ring.
[00:58:16.739 --> 00:58:18.020]  When does it not lead to that?
[00:58:19.281 --> 00:58:23.883]  Librarian refuses to turn over list of users who checked out book on Bin Laden.
[00:58:24.744 --> 00:58:28.005]  Monsanto laws would take away rights to ban GNOs.
[00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:38.110]  And so much more, like Mexican special forces aren't just killing people in Texas, they're engaging in cold-blooded slaughter in Arizona!
[00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:40.772]  But it never makes the national news.
[00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.971]  Though it should.
[00:58:44.353 --> 00:58:47.516]  Masses of news straight ahead in the second hour.
[00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.498]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:58:51.681 --> 00:58:52.262]  Terrorism.
[00:58:53.163 --> 00:58:54.264]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.216 --> 00:59:00.256]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.976 --> 00:59:02.097]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.737 --> 00:59:03.577]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.317 --> 00:59:05.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.878 --> 00:59:09.539]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.059 --> 00:59:14.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.622 --> 00:59:23.822]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:23.902 --> 00:59:26.503]  Now 30 seconds into hour number two.
[00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:31.052]  And our phone system went down the last hour.
[00:59:31.092 --> 00:59:35.994]  We will now go back to your calls and get all the great callers you've been holding on air.
[00:59:36.014 --> 00:59:39.595]  And then I'll get into the EU's expansion not going too well.
[00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:44.197]  Mexican special forces troops in multiple states killing Americans.
[00:59:44.924 --> 00:59:48.165]  And then there's a national news blackout on that and much more.
[00:59:48.725 --> 00:59:50.506]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:50.606 --> 00:59:53.347]  Jim in Pennsylvania was trying to make a point when the phone system went down.
[00:59:53.767 --> 00:59:55.108]  He was one of the first to get back in.
[00:59:55.128 --> 00:59:55.808]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:59:56.048 --> 00:59:56.728]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:59:57.328 --> 00:59:58.009]  Um, okay.
[00:59:58.149 --> 00:59:59.089]  I lost my train of thought.
[00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:03.631]  But anyway, I've seen all your movies, like I said, from America's Show by Design to Martial Law, Rides of the Police State.
[01:00:04.091 --> 01:00:10.153]  And clearly, Martial Law is your best film as far as production and the information you give to prove that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:12.934]  But I'm actually a little confused about one particular part.
[01:00:13.553 --> 01:00:16.596]  It's in the second part, where you get into how 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:00:16.996 --> 01:00:21.941]  At one point you say, along the lines of, we have a clear picture as to what happened on 9-11.
[01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:32.751]  You go into it and you say that when the passengers got on the plane, that a gas went off inside the plane that knocked out all the passengers and the plane was taken over by remote control and flown into the World Trade Center and into the Pentagon.
[01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:36.294]  Now, I've seen a couple other films, for example, Painful Deceptions.
[01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:39.357]  I believe you had that guy, Eric, I can't pronounce his last name, on your show.
[01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:45.295]  And they make a pretty good case that no commercial airline hit the Pentagon, and I'm a little bit confused as to what you think.
[01:00:45.615 --> 01:00:47.436]  Do you believe that a plane hit the Pentagon?
[01:00:47.736 --> 01:00:50.858]  Well, there are people that believe holograms did it, too, and I don't believe that.
[01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:52.218]  No, I'm serious.
[01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:54.400]  But he makes a pretty good case of an attack.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.481]  No, I think Eric Huffman and a lot of people have done a great job.
[01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:08.107]  I have decided to not delve into that, because there are 600 other points I can totally prove, and
[01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.718]  Obviously, something's wrong at the Pentagon.
[01:01:10.858 --> 01:01:12.099]  Obviously, something's going on there.
[01:01:12.199 --> 01:01:13.680]  Obviously, they grabbed the surveillance tapes.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:14.900]  Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:18.122]  But we know that they did take control of those aircraft.
[01:01:18.162 --> 01:01:21.244]  We do know they took control and shot down 93.
[01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:24.426]  We do know that the planes hit Tower 1 and 2.
[01:01:25.226 --> 01:01:29.229]  And so, I just make the point that they took control of the aircraft from my internal sources.
[01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:30.569]  It was a drill.
[01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:33.491]  And I have a report that this report was even in the mainstream news.
[01:01:34.131 --> 01:01:36.973]  And that they killed the people on board and then flew them into the buildings.
[01:01:37.719 --> 01:01:41.924]  And that the so-called hijackers were government agents taking part in the drill, and we have all the evidence of that.
[01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:45.127]  But then you can debate the Pentagon.
[01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:51.614]  But regardless, that other flight that took off was, you know, commandeered and did go somewhere.
[01:01:52.155 --> 01:01:54.097]  But again, that's the problems.
[01:01:54.884 --> 01:02:00.227]  From my point of view, and I'm allowed to have my views, and I'm allowed to not decide what I'm gonna do.
[01:02:00.267 --> 01:02:23.440]  Hold on, you're here talking about it, which is fine, but I'm allowed to say that, looking at this, that I'm, let's say I'm putting on a murder case against somebody who, you know, we caught with the dead body, with 100 videos of them killing, torturing people, 20 dead bodies in the backyard, all their admissions and all this other stuff, and there's some other murder we think they might have committed, we got a lot of evidence they did it,
[01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:32.445]  Uh, and they're not passing a lie detector test, but I can only decide, I can only put on a murder case for, you know, one murder.
[01:02:32.765 --> 01:02:34.126]  Because, you know, that's the first trial.
[01:02:34.787 --> 01:02:38.270]  And so, I'm focusing in on the one where I've really got them.
[01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:54.439]  Okay, and I think the debate predominantly should be about the public officials warned not to fly, Al Qaeda being CIA, the public officials cashing in with insider trading, the NORAD grills, Cheney ordering it to stand down.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:01.144]  This is all the stuff that cannot be debated, and unfortunately, hardly anyone's talking about it but me!
[01:03:02.104 --> 01:03:03.965]  Okay, everybody else is off
[01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:14.782]  Not something I want to call wild goose chases, but things that... We know that the magician did something with the rabbit.
[01:03:14.822 --> 01:03:15.982]  We know it's a fraud.
[01:03:16.703 --> 01:03:17.783]  We know it's a scam.
[01:03:18.744 --> 01:03:23.326]  But I'm not focusing on the magician's trick, the most sneaky part of his trick.
[01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.487]  I'm focusing on all the things that we can totally prove.
[01:03:28.214 --> 01:03:29.034]  Okay, okay.
[01:03:29.135 --> 01:03:30.395]  I understand where you're coming from, then.
[01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:31.916]  You kind of cleared it up a little bit for me.
[01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:32.836]  Just keep up the good work.
[01:03:32.856 --> 01:03:33.897]  You're doing a great job, man.
[01:03:34.117 --> 01:03:35.358]  I totally admire what you're doing.
[01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.358]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:03:36.418 --> 01:03:45.003]  And I've really been criticized by a lot of the 9-11 people, and I'm not punching back because it doesn't do anything, but it's a waste of time.
[01:03:45.063 --> 01:03:48.264]  I mean, I'm going to attack because I won't take their orthodoxy, their view.
[01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:49.465]  I won't run with it.
[01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.046]  Well, I'm a free person.
[01:03:51.086 --> 01:03:51.766]  I'll do what I want.
[01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:57.733]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.893 --> 01:04:02.335]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.475 --> 01:04:06.856]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.896 --> 01:04:08.257]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:09.918]  Animersion.
[01:04:10.039 --> 01:04:14.264]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.324 --> 01:04:21.272]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.392 --> 01:04:23.395]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:34.224]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.384 --> 01:04:39.748]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:43.471]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:44.012]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.032 --> 01:04:45.313]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:57.647]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us
[01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:03.092]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.372 --> 01:05:03.913]  We listened.
[01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:09.217]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.497 --> 01:05:09.978]  We listened.
[01:05:10.358 --> 01:05:13.400]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:14.361]  We listened.
[01:05:14.822 --> 01:05:18.905]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.285 --> 01:05:19.746]  We listened.
[01:05:20.106 --> 01:05:25.350]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.031]  Again,
[01:05:26.571 --> 01:05:27.091]  We listened.
[01:05:27.452 --> 01:05:34.856]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.236 --> 01:05:39.719]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.739 --> 01:05:41.380]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.801]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.194 --> 01:05:56.596]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[01:05:56.736 --> 01:06:00.398]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[01:06:00.578 --> 01:06:06.642]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[01:06:06.882 --> 01:06:13.946]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[01:06:14.106 --> 01:06:17.948]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[01:06:18.328 --> 01:06:21.291]  That God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one.
[01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:24.334]  And that we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor.
[01:06:24.515 --> 01:06:29.039]  Christ promises to grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in His mercy.
[01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:34.325]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[01:06:34.565 --> 01:06:38.549]  I'm offering you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about divine mercy.
[01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:39.209]  We're good to go.
[01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:09.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.052 --> 01:07:14.173]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:26.116]  I want to spend a few minutes on the 9-11 Truth Movement since a caller just brought it up, Jim in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:32.357]  Then we'll go to Jeff and Chris and Rick and Joe and many others that are patiently holding to get into all this news.
[01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:36.042]  I was the first person to talk about 9-11.
[01:07:36.383 --> 01:07:38.044]  I talked about it two months before it happened.
[01:07:38.084 --> 01:07:41.666]  I said they'll probably use Bin Laden as the fall guy to attack the World Trade Center.
[01:07:42.627 --> 01:07:44.968]  They may even use the Northwoods plan with aircraft.
[01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:49.411]  I mean, I did probably 20 radio shows on it in the two months leading up to 9-11.
[01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:51.392]  I did whole three hour radio shows.
[01:07:51.913 --> 01:07:58.077]  I did two and a half hour show on TV where I gave out the White House phone number and said call them, tell them don't carry out the attack.
[01:07:58.737 --> 01:07:59.298]  Because of
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.543]  The propaganda I saw them using, they were preparing us for the terror attack.
[01:08:03.863 --> 01:08:07.086]  The attack's coming, give your rights up, here's Bin Laden, he's about to get you!
[01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:11.910]  And then my government sources, and their past activities.
[01:08:13.372 --> 01:08:14.152]  I saw it coming.
[01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:25.122]  And then I got on the radio, on the morning of 9-11, on the two shows that are on before this one, and then on my own broadcast, and I got a lot of heat for it.
[01:08:27.071 --> 01:08:35.378]  And I laid out the facts, and then I made the first 9-11 film, 9-11, the Road to Tyranny emergency release, that was out two weeks after 9-11.
[01:08:35.438 --> 01:08:43.304]  I mean, I went into the studio, shot it for two hours talking, with the articles, put video over it, and put it out.
[01:08:43.364 --> 01:08:46.867]  And I said, I'm just going to offer it for a couple of months until the real Road to Tyranny is done.
[01:08:46.927 --> 01:08:49.209]  And three months later, Road to Tyranny was done, I released it.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.741]  And man, I was attacked.
[01:08:52.001 --> 01:08:55.603]  The only reason I'm talking about this is because it's important to understand the big picture.
[01:08:56.124 --> 01:09:00.927]  I was attacked from all these corridors, all these people today that claim to be the 9-11 Truth Movement leaders.
[01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:03.408]  Oh, Alex Jones, he's ridiculous.
[01:09:03.448 --> 01:09:04.789]  Of course the government wasn't involved.
[01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:06.190]  Of course they didn't have prior knowledge.
[01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:07.911]  Man, he's gone too far.
[01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:12.975]  And then a few months later, well maybe the government had prior knowledge, but he's gone too far saying they were involved.
[01:09:14.415 --> 01:09:14.856]  And then,
[01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:31.652]  There's a time when all these individuals popped up who would then say, I am the father of the 9-11 movement, I am the godfather, I tell you what to think, I tell you what to cover, and I tell you Alex Jones is bad!
[01:09:33.334 --> 01:09:34.976]  And so I sat there watching that and I go,
[01:09:35.757 --> 01:09:46.582]  I mean, I'd break a story three years ago, and two and a half years later, they'd go, I broke the news of the war games, I broke it, and Alex stole it from me.
[01:09:46.662 --> 01:09:48.183]  I mean, it just, and I'm like, really?
[01:09:48.263 --> 01:09:52.585]  I had a film out two years ago saying this, and I mean, the AP said it a year ago.
[01:09:52.605 --> 01:09:54.486]  It's just you couldn't get through to them.
[01:09:55.667 --> 01:09:58.048]  So I guess every few months, I've got to tell you the facts here.
[01:09:59.036 --> 01:10:00.197]  I mean, it's quite a mantle.
[01:10:00.277 --> 01:10:01.297]  It's not one I want.
[01:10:01.377 --> 01:10:02.478]  It's a dangerous mantle.
[01:10:02.518 --> 01:10:04.379]  But, I mean, you want to know who started it.
[01:10:04.819 --> 01:10:06.240]  You want to know who saw it first.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.601]  You want to know who saw it coming.
[01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:09.722]  You want to know who knows how this stuff works.
[01:10:09.782 --> 01:10:12.304]  Unfortunately, it's very painful to know all this stuff.
[01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:13.324]  It's me.
[01:10:13.925 --> 01:10:18.847]  It is I. Child Roland of the Dark Tower cometh.
[01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:21.489]  I mean, I know what the New Order is up to.
[01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.390]  I understood it long before.
[01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:24.911]  I saw what they were doing.
[01:10:26.652 --> 01:10:32.275]  I took the heat, I lost the radio stations when I did that, while everybody else sat out sucking their thumbs.
[01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:38.997]  I ran up and took the machine gun nest, I hit the barbed wire, and I never talked about that.
[01:10:39.758 --> 01:10:40.998]  I didn't make a big deal out of it.
[01:10:41.038 --> 01:10:50.082]  I said, everybody's a leader, everyone's important, and then these people started telling me what I should think and what I should do and what I should say, and I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:10:50.102 --> 01:10:52.943]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:10:54.207 --> 01:11:01.274]  It's ridiculous, because they're trying to control a movement that doesn't need to be controlled.
[01:11:01.474 --> 01:11:12.985]  All of you are leaders, all of you are important, all of you... It doesn't matter in the scheme of things who first talked about it, other than the fact that people claim that mantle who didn't, and then claim authority out of it.
[01:11:15.046 --> 01:11:19.711]  Now, as for people getting into the Pentagon not being hit by a plane, and people getting into
[01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.112]  You know, different planes hitting the World Trade Centers.
[01:11:25.353 --> 01:11:37.683]  Look, there is a compelling argument, compelling evidence, the predominance, the preponderance of the evidence says that's true.
[01:11:38.784 --> 01:11:44.589]  But then, that huge spectrum of debate
[01:11:46.457 --> 01:11:54.760]  About exactly how it was done, and who did it, and what plane they used, what missile they used, what they did with the planes.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:04.344]  That whole spectrum of debate is an endless rabbit trail into the briar patch that no one is going to get out of.
[01:12:05.544 --> 01:12:11.166]  And that's why, that's when the media attacks the 9-11 truth movement, that's when I said they do this.
[01:12:11.186 --> 01:12:12.527]  I mean, I just understand them, folks.
[01:12:14.136 --> 01:12:16.197]  That's why they always attack those arguments.
[01:12:16.237 --> 01:12:17.798]  That's why they always go after that.
[01:12:18.759 --> 01:12:19.099]  Okay?
[01:12:19.139 --> 01:12:25.243]  People gotta learn how to crawl before they can walk, before they can run, before they can vault.
[01:12:26.403 --> 01:12:34.648]  And there is a disease in the truth movement of not covering the basics.
[01:12:34.869 --> 01:12:36.169]  And I haven't been doing this enough.
[01:12:36.289 --> 01:12:43.514]  I need to go back, like I did three and a half, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, and do whole weeks
[01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:46.550]  Where I don't take calls.
[01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:54.792]  Where I just read documents and show how they did it and go over all the facts and just... I didn't do whole weeks.
[01:12:54.852 --> 01:12:57.032]  I'd do like three days in a row, three hours every day.
[01:12:57.352 --> 01:13:00.813]  And even at the nighttime show, live at the time, I would do some days six hours.
[01:13:03.194 --> 01:13:07.094]  I've got files that just are entire boxes after box.
[01:13:08.755 --> 01:13:10.335]  And none of that stuff ever gets covered.
[01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:15.891]  I mean the insane, just look, look, again here's the analogy.
[01:13:17.812 --> 01:13:23.013]  The cops get a call, they hear some hikers were in a woodland area and heard a woman screaming at a cabin.
[01:13:24.614 --> 01:13:28.395]  They finally show up and in the back they find 30 dead bodies buried.
[01:13:28.995 --> 01:13:32.216]  They find videotapes of the killers done as he tortures and kills them.
[01:13:33.156 --> 01:13:35.857]  They find the dead woman he just killed hanging from a meat hook.
[01:13:35.877 --> 01:13:36.737]  These are real cases.
[01:13:38.504 --> 01:13:39.905]  There have been real cases of this.
[01:13:39.965 --> 01:13:41.927]  They wait for scumbag to come home and grab him.
[01:13:42.727 --> 01:13:43.768]  Scumbag won't talk.
[01:13:43.828 --> 01:13:45.049]  Scumbag won't ever talk.
[01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:47.151]  Alright?
[01:13:49.253 --> 01:13:50.914]  And there's all this evidence that he did it.
[01:13:53.976 --> 01:14:05.906]  And so, if I was putting on a prosecution, would I focus in the prosecution, now did you slit her throat before you raped her?
[01:14:06.852 --> 01:14:08.933]  Now, who'd you bury first out there?
[01:14:09.693 --> 01:14:15.516]  Now, uh, you know, where exactly did you grab this, this, the first person you killed?
[01:14:16.797 --> 01:14:18.938]  Or, what did you say while you did it?
[01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:30.263]  I would just focus on the videos of them doing it, on all the really hardcore evidence, and then I certainly wouldn't then, and they've lost cases like this before, start trying to tag all the other cases
[01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:40.905]  That we think this, you know, other people this serial killer murdered, I wouldn't start trying to go after those cases where we didn't even have a body or videotapes or admissions.
[01:14:42.665 --> 01:14:55.070]  And maybe a better murder investigation analogy is, they pull the guy over, and he's got blood all over him, skin under his fingernails, a bloody butcher knife in the back of the car,
[01:14:56.213 --> 01:15:02.598]  And, uh, a truck driver saw the car pull out from this dirt road, and they go back and they find the dead body.
[01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:04.600]  And you know the guy did it.
[01:15:05.941 --> 01:15:06.381]  Okay?
[01:15:08.063 --> 01:15:16.889]  And then you go in before the jury, and his lawyer's gonna say, well, he doesn't admit to it.
[01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:18.591]  Well, what's your proof?
[01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:22.474]  Well, under the fingernails, the blood, the knife, the knife fits the wounds.
[01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:25.966]  Well, yes, but you know what?
[01:15:28.868 --> 01:15:42.075]  You see, what happens is people don't go after, in my humble opinion, the most effective wide spectrum of data that we can prove their official stories of fraud.
[01:15:42.415 --> 01:15:46.277]  That number one, they're lying, their official story has been disproven from end to end.
[01:15:46.897 --> 01:15:47.798]  That's the first thing you do.
[01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:56.483]  Then you show the motive, the government documents calling for carrying out attacks, and then cases of the government carrying out terror attacks to blame it on enemies or a pretext for war.
[01:15:56.883 --> 01:16:04.707]  From the Maine, to the Gulf of Tonkin, to the USS Liberty, to Project... uh... Gladio, to Northwoods, all of it!
[01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:07.806]  And then you get into, well, where was Bush Senior?
[01:16:07.866 --> 01:16:09.847]  Well, the Karloff Group at the Bin Laden's that morning.
[01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:13.730]  Oh, where was the head of Pakistani intelligence who wired money to Muhammad Atta?
[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.230]  Where was he?
[01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:15.051]  Well, he was here.
[01:16:15.231 --> 01:16:16.412]  Well, what's the motive to this?
[01:16:16.432 --> 01:16:18.213]  Well, Dick Cheney says they need terror attacks.
[01:16:18.233 --> 01:16:21.195]  Well, and then, oh, the CIA did insider trading.
[01:16:21.235 --> 01:16:21.955]  Buzzy Crongaard.
[01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:24.137]  Now Buzzy Crongaard says we don't need to catch Bin Laden.
[01:16:24.697 --> 01:16:25.337]  Times of London.
[01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:27.818]  And oh, one of these public officials is not to fly.
[01:16:28.298 --> 01:16:29.698]  Oh, why did NORAD stand down?
[01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:30.818]  Let's subpoena these people.
[01:16:30.838 --> 01:16:31.398]  Let's sue them.
[01:16:31.918 --> 01:16:35.479]  Oh, look, NORAD thought it was a drill of the exact same thing happening.
[01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:39.420]  Hijack jets flying over the World Trade Center and Pentagon as the operational cover.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.960]  Oh, let's look at Building 7 and the crimp and how it imploded.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.761]  And now they even admit that the fire couldn't have done that.
[01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:47.901]  Well, then what did do that?
[01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:50.161]  Well, Larry Silverstein, you said you blew it up.
[01:16:51.262 --> 01:16:52.542]  Why aren't we talking more about that?
[01:16:54.262 --> 01:16:58.605]  Literally, one time we counted them up a couple years ago, it was like 600 pieces of evidence.
[01:16:59.346 --> 01:17:03.228]  Then you get into, why was the FAA ordered to shred all the tapes?
[01:17:03.308 --> 01:17:03.869]  That's admitted.
[01:17:04.469 --> 01:17:05.430]  Well, who gave that order?
[01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:06.490]  Well, who gave them that order?
[01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:15.076]  Well, why was Dick Cheney in the bunker under the White House running it, and then running the situational control of it after that afternoon from Site R on the Maryland-Virginia border?
[01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:24.377]  Well, Dick Cheney's declared national security on what he said during that period of time, but witnesses have leaked that it was a stand-down.
[01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:28.959]  Well, we even have some of that coming out in Senate testimony leaking out, but it's ignored.
[01:17:30.399 --> 01:17:35.482]  Well, three months before, Dick Cheney took control from the generals to shoot down planes and gave it only to himself and the President.
[01:17:36.142 --> 01:17:38.223]  I removed that power from the brass.
[01:17:38.263 --> 01:17:38.983]  Why'd you do that?
[01:17:41.905 --> 01:17:43.906]  Well, why was the U.S.
[01:17:43.946 --> 01:17:44.226]  government
[01:17:44.938 --> 01:17:47.639]  Paying for the houses, cars, credit cards, and some of the hijackers.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.880]  Why were they living in U.S.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.600]  military bases?
[01:17:49.661 --> 01:17:50.501]  Why were they living with U.S.
[01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:51.081]  informants?
[01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:53.823]  On and on and on.
[01:17:53.883 --> 01:18:04.068]  Why did you tell actor James Woods a week before, when NADA and others were part of a government drill and he thought it was a simulated hijacking, which it was, why'd you tell James Woods to shut up under national security a week before?
[01:18:04.428 --> 01:18:08.650]  Bush, why'd you sign W199I telling the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda?
[01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:11.532]  Why'd you threaten FBI agents with arrest if they tell us what they know?
[01:18:12.808 --> 01:18:15.030]  All we can tell you is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.392]  Why did Marvin Bush run security for the Towers?
[01:18:17.632 --> 01:18:20.275]  Why did his two-year contract end on September 11th?
[01:18:21.255 --> 01:18:22.557]  Scripted out two years before.
[01:18:23.457 --> 01:18:24.498]  So they wouldn't have liability.
[01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:28.802]  Why did Larry Silverstein take out double insurance policies two months before 9-11?
[01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.826]  And you just go walk people, there's like 600 pieces.
[01:18:34.747 --> 01:18:35.708]  You walk them through that.
[01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:44.861]  I mean, there's points about 9-11 that people never know, that never talk about, never discuss, and we cover most of them, there's too many to cover, in martial law.
[01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:47.524]  Alright, we'll take your calls, we'll get back and get into other news.
[01:18:48.064 --> 01:18:48.845]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:18:55.152 --> 01:18:57.494]  Hi, folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[01:19:02.094 --> 01:19:03.995]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.015 --> 01:19:04.856]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:04.896 --> 01:19:05.916]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:19:06.016 --> 01:19:06.456]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:06.497 --> 01:19:08.918]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:19:08.938 --> 01:19:10.819]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:10.839 --> 01:19:12.300]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.781]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.585 --> 01:19:32.626]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:20.075]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:20:20.475 --> 01:20:23.497]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:20:23.977 --> 01:20:25.138]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:28.181]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.

[01:21:41.886 --> 01:21:46.549]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America by the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:49.610]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:22:05.899 --> 01:22:12.940]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:22.582]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:22:35.194 --> 01:22:37.895]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:41.155 --> 01:22:42.136]  Just call today.

[01:22:51.258 --> 01:23:00.740]  Alright, Jeff, Chris, Rick, any others?
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.160]  We're going to get to you in a minute here.
[01:23:03.306 --> 01:23:07.987]  I didn't really finish my analogy of the police in the crime scene with the serial killer.
[01:23:08.988 --> 01:23:14.709]  The defense lawyers are going to go, Officers, did you see him plunge the knife into them?
[01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.310]  What's your proof?
[01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:18.851]  Well, tell us exactly how he did it.
[01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:21.912]  You know, they've dug the dead bodies up, you know, they've got all the proof.
[01:23:22.852 --> 01:23:32.735]  But, if we then try to get into just the absolute, total minutiae, you know, which button on the intercom did Dick Cheney hit to order the stand down, you know?
[01:23:33.862 --> 01:23:35.183]  We just know he ordered the stand down.
[01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:41.124]  If we get into the total minutiae, then we're not going to win this case.
[01:23:41.244 --> 01:23:49.027]  But overwhelmingly with all the evidence, you can convince any jury that this is the guilty party.
[01:23:49.847 --> 01:23:50.727]  This is the killer.
[01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:56.609]  And the big problem is that people love to make names for themselves.
[01:23:57.329 --> 01:23:58.990]  So coming up with a pet theory
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:06.445]  That, you know, is bizarre, or odd, or interesting, or in one of these nebulous areas, gets a lot of attention.
[01:24:08.767 --> 01:24:12.670]  I mean, coming up with the idea that holograms were doing it, I mean, people have done that and they just love it.
[01:24:13.911 --> 01:24:15.573]  And the government just loves that, it's ridiculous.
[01:24:16.514 --> 01:24:22.959]  And then, you know, I'll be on a talk show talking about serious issues and the host goes, Are you one of those that thinks a hologram did it?
[01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.161]  You know, it just never ends.
[01:24:25.948 --> 01:24:30.210]  And I go, no, I'm the one that read the PENAC documents where they said they wanted terror attacks.
[01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:33.231]  You know, I'm the one that read what Brzezinski said about it.
[01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:35.712]  You know, I'm the one that has the Northwoods document.
[01:24:36.413 --> 01:24:40.535]  I'm the one that has 600 plus points that cannot be refuted.
[01:24:41.275 --> 01:24:43.656]  And that is the effective way to wake people up.
[01:24:43.716 --> 01:24:44.656]  We know they did it.
[01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:46.577]  We caught them red-handed.
[01:24:47.158 --> 01:24:54.741]  And if we let them get us into an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pen, and let them shut the debate, we got a major problem.
[01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.110]  Jeff in mask.
[01:24:57.150 --> 01:24:57.751]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:24:58.411 --> 01:24:59.011]  Yes, Alex.
[01:24:59.092 --> 01:25:04.375]  Now, as far as the Mexican Special Forces coming into our border, can you elaborate on that?
[01:25:04.455 --> 01:25:08.798]  Because I never heard that, but it seems like it's the truth.
[01:25:09.459 --> 01:25:25.050]  Brownsville newspaper, Dallas Morning News, this one is out of NBC News 5, out of Phoenix, and Mexican Drug Commandos is the headline.
[01:25:25.649 --> 01:25:29.253]  They were the elite special forces of Mexican military, trained in the U.S.
[01:25:29.273 --> 01:25:36.000]  at the School of Americas, at Fort Benning, Georgia, and sent to wipe out one of the most powerful Mexican drug cartels.
[01:25:36.561 --> 01:25:38.403]  But these soldiers deserted.
[01:25:38.743 --> 01:25:41.205]  Not true, they're doing their job.
[01:25:41.246 --> 01:25:41.606]  Wow.
[01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:47.112]  And became the muscle for the very cartel they were supposed to destroy.
[01:25:47.885 --> 01:25:58.551]  According to this Department of Justice Intelligence bulletin obtained by Five Eye Team, these rogue commandos, now known as Los Zetas, may be heading our way.
[01:26:01.712 --> 01:26:04.754]  Sir, in Dallas they've been machine gunning, car bombing...
[01:26:05.481 --> 01:26:08.362]  Can you imagine if Arabs blew up a suburban?
[01:26:08.442 --> 01:26:08.842]  You're right!
[01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:11.003]  And killed four people and caught a building on fire?
[01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:11.763]  You're right!
[01:26:11.783 --> 01:26:16.884]  Can you imagine in Austin they've committed murders, in San Antonio they're machine gunning people almost on a monthly basis?
[01:26:17.044 --> 01:26:18.145]  They've even killed cops!
[01:26:18.505 --> 01:26:20.925]  But it's kept very quiet!
[01:26:21.305 --> 01:26:23.586]  Because these are some special young men!
[01:26:23.606 --> 01:26:26.107]  Alex, you are so right.
[01:26:26.207 --> 01:26:31.108]  And point two, which you're right about this too, is that violence is not good.
[01:26:31.268 --> 01:26:33.989]  Because it only destroys what you're trying to accomplish anyways.
[01:26:35.111 --> 01:26:38.974]  Well, offensive violence will feed into the hands of the globalists.
[01:26:40.014 --> 01:26:47.079]  I'm not saying that morally we don't have a right to... I mean, this is a criminal government, but we have to play chess instead of checkers.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.580]  That's what they want us to do.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.703]  Alex, you're right, because I play chess, and you're absolutely right.
[01:26:52.743 --> 01:26:56.326]  These guys are playing us like chess pieces.
[01:26:56.746 --> 01:26:58.948]  Yeah, they're playing ten moves ahead.
[01:26:59.808 --> 01:27:03.651]  And the American people don't even know how to play chess at a five-year-old level.
[01:27:04.249 --> 01:27:19.033]  You are so right, because I played chess too, and you're so right about offensive violence being wrong, because they'll just use it to propagandize us, just like the brown shirts back in Nazi Germany in the Night of the Long Knives.
[01:27:19.853 --> 01:27:24.174]  In fact, the poison and the antidote is made in the same laboratory.
[01:27:25.205 --> 01:27:26.645]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:27:27.986 --> 01:27:31.706]  I'll get into the Mexican Troop thing later in the next segment.
[01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.447]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[01:27:33.487 --> 01:27:34.147]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:27:34.407 --> 01:27:35.427]  It's good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:27:36.047 --> 01:27:39.168]  I just wanted to make a comment on your film, Martial Law.
[01:27:39.728 --> 01:27:40.028]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:43.909]  I saw it for the first time yesterday, and I watched it with two other people.
[01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:50.050]  And I just want you to know the effect of the truth literally made them physically ill.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.220]  If you can believe that.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:55.182]  No, we've gotten that report a lot from Road to Tyranny and Martial Law.
[01:27:55.602 --> 01:27:57.343]  Yeah, they were so blown away.
[01:27:57.363 --> 01:28:00.885]  Well, I mean, if you're not normal, you won't get sick.
[01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:02.066]  But if you are normal, you will.
[01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:06.328]  I mean, finding out we've got a bunch of murdering criminals running things is nauseating.
[01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:07.468]  It's scary.
[01:28:07.508 --> 01:28:08.149]  It's serious.
[01:28:08.589 --> 01:28:09.229]  It definitely is.
[01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:12.351]  And I just wanted to say, it is truly your best film ever.
[01:28:13.918 --> 01:28:14.939]  Well, I appreciate that plug.
[01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:15.979]  Anything else in your mind, Chris?
[01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:16.859]  No, I'm good.
[01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:17.300]  Thanks.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.080]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.181]  Rick in Baltimore and many others.
[01:28:20.221 --> 01:28:24.943]  Your calls are coming up next.
[01:28:24.963 --> 01:28:25.263]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:26.223 --> 01:28:28.224]  I ran out of the office with this article today.
[01:28:28.244 --> 01:28:29.885]  I didn't tell my webmaster to post it.
[01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:38.669]  I need to get all the other Mexican military gang articles from Texas papers posted with this one.
[01:28:39.969 --> 01:28:41.290]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:43.832 --> 01:28:46.835]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:50.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:26.309 --> 01:29:27.069]  Which are collectible?

[01:29:53.792 --> 01:29:55.393]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.533 --> 01:29:59.636]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.776 --> 01:30:02.658]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.738 --> 01:30:09.463]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.643 --> 01:30:12.645]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.845 --> 01:30:15.247]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.387 --> 01:30:20.090]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:34.864]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.004 --> 01:30:41.711]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:30:53.217 --> 01:31:01.179]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:02.880]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.720]  Now check this out.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.521]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:31:07.821 --> 01:31:08.882]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:31:10.482 --> 01:31:13.146]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:31:13.406 --> 01:31:14.187]  Your health suffers.
[01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:15.028]  It's that simple.
[01:31:15.408 --> 01:31:17.191]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.353]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:27.744]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you could fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:31:54.518 --> 01:31:59.660]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.721]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:06.483 --> 01:32:13.725]  You've heard all of the people out there that have seen Martial Law, who are saying it's my best work ever.
[01:32:14.166 --> 01:32:20.608]  And Jeff Rents, TV producer, former anchorman, award-winning, said it's the best documentary film he's ever seen.
[01:32:21.593 --> 01:32:24.194]  I mean, that's the type of reviews that are just pouring in.
[01:32:24.214 --> 01:32:31.075]  I had a major Hollywood director just the other day who I sent a couple copies of the film.
[01:32:31.115 --> 01:32:31.715]  He's a friend of mine.
[01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:33.095]  He just said, man, this is your best work.
[01:32:33.115 --> 01:32:33.796]  This is incredible.
[01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:39.257]  And so I solicited from him a review.
[01:32:39.357 --> 01:32:46.378]  I don't know if I'm going to get one, but the point is, I'm not going to take his words and use it as a review without his permission.
[01:32:47.338 --> 01:32:49.919]  He had even more glowing comments than what I just said.
[01:32:51.269 --> 01:32:59.134]  It's a really good video, and I'm just going to give this number out twice.
[01:32:59.154 --> 01:33:01.636]  1-888-253-3139 to order it.
[01:33:02.236 --> 01:33:03.797]  They can answer all your questions when you call.
[01:33:03.817 --> 01:33:04.798]  888-253-3139.
[01:33:05.338 --> 01:33:12.123]  Or go to InfoWars.com to order hard copies via the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[01:33:12.543 --> 01:33:19.068]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and you can watch all my films there and so much more for 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:33:20.068 --> 01:33:20.429]  Alright,
[01:33:22.171 --> 01:33:23.431]  Rick and Gary and others.
[01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:24.251]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:33:24.271 --> 01:33:25.132]  We'll take a few more calls.
[01:33:25.152 --> 01:33:28.612]  Then I've got to get into the Mexican troop hitman situation.
[01:33:29.592 --> 01:33:36.374]  And then the good news with the EU expansion running into real resistance in the Netherlands and in France as well.
[01:33:37.794 --> 01:33:40.034]  And just a bunch of other news and we'll go back into your calls.
[01:33:40.094 --> 01:33:42.235]  But right now, we haven't had her on in a week or two.
[01:33:42.275 --> 01:33:43.155]  I'm honored to have her.
[01:33:43.815 --> 01:33:48.696]  Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts, the Made in America Black Berkey System.
[01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:52.433]  They also have the Brent models if you want them, which are excellent as well.
[01:33:53.434 --> 01:33:56.617]  But quite a rarity, something actually made in America of high quality.
[01:33:57.257 --> 01:34:00.040]  And Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.602]  Hi Alex, I'm really glad to be here.
[01:34:02.622 --> 01:34:04.003]  Thanks for having me.
[01:34:04.363 --> 01:34:11.329]  Are you still offering that great special you offered a week and a half ago of the big mega filter that does three gallons at a time for
[01:34:13.735 --> 01:34:14.155]  We do.
[01:34:14.175 --> 01:34:23.772]  It's the 3 gallon stainless steel with the ceramic filters in it that are the imperial size.
[01:34:24.273 --> 01:34:24.774]  And it's $2.25 only.
[01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:30.029]  And it's really a great opportunity for people.
[01:34:30.049 --> 01:34:30.029]  $225?
[01:34:30.249 --> 01:34:30.730]  Yeah, $225.
[01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:32.871]  Aren't those normally, I mean, in a store, those are like $400.
[01:34:33.211 --> 01:34:34.072]  Right.
[01:34:34.452 --> 01:34:35.553]  Yeah.
[01:34:35.613 --> 01:34:36.893]  We really want to get these.
[01:34:36.954 --> 01:34:38.434]  What do you normally sell those for?
[01:34:38.454 --> 01:34:39.715]  And again, you're the national distributor.
[01:34:40.176 --> 01:34:41.777]  I mean, isn't it like $350 or something?
[01:34:41.857 --> 01:34:42.177]  Right.
[01:34:42.517 --> 01:34:43.057]  It sure is.
[01:34:43.518 --> 01:34:44.738]  Well, about $339.
[01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.700]  And so I just said $240.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.001]  I was... $225?
[01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:49.561]  Correct.
[01:34:50.742 --> 01:34:51.102]  Correct.
[01:34:51.303 --> 01:34:52.743]  I haven't heard a deal like that in years.
[01:34:53.044 --> 01:34:54.224]  No, and we really...
[01:34:55.643 --> 01:35:01.388]  I feel it's imperative for those people who have been waiting to get a system.
[01:35:01.448 --> 01:35:08.174]  They want a stainless steel, but they want it bigger than the two and a quarter gallon one, and they want it affordable.
[01:35:08.234 --> 01:35:09.696]  This is the time to buy it.
[01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:14.380]  You know, I don't know how long we'll have this available, but it's a great deal.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.985]  This is great for people that have restaurants or cook for a lot of people, so you cook with good water too.
[01:35:20.786 --> 01:35:23.528]  And it does, you know, you can dump three gallons in the top of it.
[01:35:23.548 --> 01:35:25.130]  How long does it take those three gallons to go through?
[01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:33.556]  It really does it in like about an hour and a half, hour and a half, two hours with just two of the big ceramic filters in it.
[01:35:34.137 --> 01:35:35.198]  It does it pretty quick.
[01:35:36.317 --> 01:35:42.920]  Because it has more head pressure, because there's more water going through the filters, more weight pushing it through.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:48.123]  And again, the Chinese and Indian knockoffs will do 3 gallons in 5 minutes, but it doesn't clean the water.
[01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:49.584]  Right, right.
[01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:53.766]  It's a joke folks.
[01:35:54.126 --> 01:35:54.566]  So $2.25.
[01:35:55.127 --> 01:35:55.747]  Plus shipping.
[01:35:56.767 --> 01:35:57.068]  Wow.
[01:35:57.388 --> 01:36:01.150]  Yeah, it's a really good deal and we really want to hear from your listeners.
[01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:03.811]  It's the end of the month and we'd like to get those
[01:36:04.235 --> 01:36:07.518]  Call them, you know, get the orders issued before the holidays.
[01:36:07.598 --> 01:36:09.119]  Hey, I keep forgetting to call you.
[01:36:09.179 --> 01:36:12.581]  Will you send me a five sports bottle package?
[01:36:13.382 --> 01:36:14.082]  I will!
[01:36:14.863 --> 01:36:17.205]  And you also want two shower filters, right?
[01:36:18.018 --> 01:36:19.539]  Remember I asked you, I need to call you.
[01:36:19.619 --> 01:36:21.480]  I forgot about it until right now.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.101]  I know, I'm not going through normal channels.
[01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:23.902]  I always ask you.
[01:36:24.222 --> 01:36:25.263]  Yeah, send me two of those.
[01:36:25.623 --> 01:36:27.704]  You have five sport bottles?
[01:36:27.765 --> 01:36:31.407]  I've got the last ones I bought for like a year and you're supposed to replace them after a year, right?
[01:36:31.467 --> 01:36:31.827]  Okay.
[01:36:32.107 --> 01:36:33.729]  What, the sport bottles or the shower filter?
[01:36:33.749 --> 01:36:34.429]  The shower filter.
[01:36:34.689 --> 01:36:36.791]  Yeah, once a year or every 10,000 gallons.
[01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:39.292]  It's actually been like a year and a half so I've got to do that.
[01:36:39.312 --> 01:36:40.893]  So here's the order, Debbie.
[01:36:40.933 --> 01:36:42.094]  I'm so busy I never have time to call you.
[01:36:42.414 --> 01:36:47.518]  I want two of those and a five sports bottle Berkey special and you can just charge my credit card.
[01:36:48.438 --> 01:36:49.599]  I'll do it.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:50.720]  I'll do it.
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.281]  The others are for gifts.
[01:36:52.861 --> 01:36:57.685]  My sister leaves next week for, what is it, New Guinea or something?
[01:36:57.705 --> 01:36:59.486]  And they say she needs a sports bottle.
[01:37:00.046 --> 01:37:02.468]  Oh, well we'll get them shipped out to you today.
[01:37:02.909 --> 01:37:04.269]  But yeah, I keep forgetting.
[01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:05.370]  My parents are like, get that for us.
[01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.971]  Get that for us.
[01:37:06.491 --> 01:37:07.852]  Yeah, guess where I'm going this weekend?
[01:37:07.872 --> 01:37:08.953]  Where are you going?
[01:37:09.173 --> 01:37:10.054]  Mount Rushmore.
[01:37:10.334 --> 01:37:12.675]  And I'm taking my Berkey Sport Bottles with me.
[01:37:12.916 --> 01:37:13.576]  Well that's good.
[01:37:13.616 --> 01:37:14.697]  You might be with Al-Qaeda then.
[01:37:16.214 --> 01:37:18.716]  It's evil to not trust the government and not drink their water.
[01:37:18.736 --> 01:37:23.319]  So what if it smells like rat excreta?
[01:37:23.339 --> 01:37:25.641]  Just go ahead and drink that water.
[01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:27.142]  Debbie, how dare you filter it?
[01:37:27.522 --> 01:37:27.842]  I know.
[01:37:28.283 --> 01:37:40.671]  I was at my neighbors last night and they were talking about MTBE and the gas, you know, and how they actually drive out of town to get gasoline that doesn't have MTBE in it because they're real car enthusiasts.
[01:37:41.151 --> 01:37:44.034]  And I said, well, you know, what about drinking MTBE?
[01:37:44.455 --> 01:37:45.896]  And they said, well, what are you talking about?
[01:37:45.916 --> 01:37:49.780]  And I said, well, do you know that there's MTBE in most of the water sources?
[01:37:50.321 --> 01:37:51.121]  And they said, no.
[01:37:51.221 --> 01:37:54.645]  And I said, well, you know, our Berkey water filters take out the MTBE.
[01:37:54.925 --> 01:37:57.448]  United States, a wonderful carcinogen.
[01:37:58.266 --> 01:37:59.246]  That they put in there.
[01:37:59.927 --> 01:38:00.367]  It's simple.
[01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:06.329]  The chemical companies have got a poisonous by-product that they have to store for millions of dollars every year per facility.
[01:38:06.569 --> 01:38:09.370]  They just get Congress to pass a law to put it in the fuel.
[01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:10.830]  Right, just like the fluoride.
[01:38:11.571 --> 01:38:13.511]  And just like depleted uranium, huh?
[01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:15.012]  You got a bunch of stuff from reactors?
[01:38:15.392 --> 01:38:16.492]  Well, we'll just put it in weapons.
[01:38:17.052 --> 01:38:17.833]  Yep.
[01:38:17.853 --> 01:38:21.154]  Debbie, give folks the toll-free number to get that special or other specials.
[01:38:21.254 --> 01:38:21.694]  Sure.
[01:38:22.074 --> 01:38:23.074]  It's toll-free 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:28.317 --> 01:38:39.481]  Or you can go to our website at Berkeywater.com and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[01:38:39.501 --> 01:38:39.801]  888-803-4438.
[01:38:39.821 --> 01:38:46.023]  It's been years since I've heard you sell the Imperials for anywhere near that price.
[01:38:46.943 --> 01:38:48.623]  I've never heard it for that price, have I?
[01:38:49.004 --> 01:38:49.264]  No.
[01:38:49.644 --> 01:38:50.984]  No, and this isn't the Imperial.
[01:38:51.004 --> 01:38:52.725]  The Imperial holds 5 gallons.
[01:38:52.805 --> 01:38:55.145]  This is in between the Imperial and the big Berkey.
[01:38:55.366 --> 01:38:56.726]  And what is a 3 gallon called?
[01:38:57.086 --> 01:38:58.107]  We don't have a name yet.
[01:38:59.288 --> 01:39:02.271]  We're just calling it the Stainless Steel 3-Gallon right now.
[01:39:02.291 --> 01:39:02.812]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.132 --> 01:39:05.394]  And it is really, it's beautiful.
[01:39:05.414 --> 01:39:07.396]  Well, I know there's a bunch of names for them.
[01:39:07.436 --> 01:39:09.638]  Because I've sold them in the past for you.
[01:39:10.139 --> 01:39:12.901]  Yeah, this is our first time having the 3-Gallon.
[01:39:13.021 --> 01:39:14.843]  But we're real excited about it.
[01:39:15.324 --> 01:39:19.868]  We're looking forward to getting it out there to the public and, you know, live people.
[01:39:19.908 --> 01:39:20.869]  Alright, well here's the number.
[01:39:21.425 --> 01:39:24.586]  Here's the number, 888-803-4438.
[01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.307]  Folks, I say you should just trust the government.
[01:39:27.767 --> 01:39:30.768]  They never lie to you and just keep drinking that stinky tap water.
[01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:34.350]  Don't be like I am, you know, because now I can't drink tap water.
[01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:36.310]  It smells, it stinks, I haven't even been drinking good water.
[01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:37.111]  It's even worse.
[01:39:37.151 --> 01:39:38.791]  But again, don't listen to us.
[01:39:38.951 --> 01:39:39.811]  Love your government.
[01:39:39.892 --> 01:39:40.572]  Trust them.
[01:39:42.392 --> 01:39:43.453]  You know, my dad's a dentist.
[01:39:43.513 --> 01:39:44.953]  One of his friends is a Dr. King.
[01:39:45.794 --> 01:39:46.674]  He's got a big pool.
[01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:48.661]  And he drained it and refilled it.
[01:39:48.701 --> 01:39:50.202]  He made the joke that he tested it.
[01:39:50.742 --> 01:40:00.024]  And the test strip said, perfect chlorination, perfect chemicalization, without even adding chemicals, Debbie!
[01:40:00.064 --> 01:40:01.865]  Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[01:40:02.005 --> 01:40:02.805]  Delicious!
[01:40:02.885 --> 01:40:04.385]  And yeah, I've talked to a lot of people.
[01:40:04.425 --> 01:40:06.206]  I have a neighbor who sells hot tubs.
[01:40:06.226 --> 01:40:10.387]  And he said, Alex, I used to live in Dallas, I lived in Florida, you know, for this company.
[01:40:10.407 --> 01:40:11.347]  He works for a big company.
[01:40:12.027 --> 01:40:14.147]  Okay, he works for Hot Springs Tubs.
[01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:14.828]  Great folks.
[01:40:17.122 --> 01:40:33.431]  He said all over the country, particularly in Austin, he goes, the stuff is, the alkalinity is so high, it is so full of chemicals, it is so horrible, and I don't know how anybody can drink this stuff!
[01:40:34.812 --> 01:40:37.314]  You know, a fish won't live in your tap water, folks!
[01:40:42.156 --> 01:40:47.504]  A lot of people who have pools and everything have to do things to their water to get the levels down.
[01:40:49.116 --> 01:40:58.484]  Rather than, even the health boss, the one that I go to, they have to put stuff, they have to do things to make it so it has less... No, no, that's what the hot tub guy told me.
[01:40:58.824 --> 01:41:00.085]  That's what the hot tub guy told me.
[01:41:00.105 --> 01:41:02.367]  He said the chemicals are higher than what it's supposed to be.
[01:41:02.407 --> 01:41:03.568]  Right, exactly.
[01:41:03.588 --> 01:41:07.991]  It's crazy, and yet you drink that water and it's so bad for you.
[01:41:08.012 --> 01:41:08.952]  You know what, I want people to do this.
[01:41:09.072 --> 01:41:11.054]  I want them to call a pool place and ask them.
[01:41:11.094 --> 01:41:12.035]  I don't want them to believe us.
[01:41:12.952 --> 01:41:19.777]  They ought to just call randomly a pool place up and go, is the water coming out of the tap have more chlorine than it needs even for your pool?
[01:41:20.398 --> 01:41:22.299]  Debbie, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:41:22.459 --> 01:41:23.680]  Thank you for having me.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:25.762]  I really appreciate you spending that time with us.
[01:41:25.802 --> 01:41:26.382]  What a darling.
[01:41:26.642 --> 01:41:28.303]  Have a nice Memorial Weekend.
[01:41:28.404 --> 01:41:28.884]  You too.
[01:41:29.724 --> 01:41:31.045]  Give her a call, folks.
[01:41:31.065 --> 01:41:31.266]  888-803-4438.
[01:41:32.667 --> 01:41:32.987]  Don't wait.
[01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:34.968]  No, no, seriously on this subject.
[01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:42.434]  How on earth do we get to this point?
[01:41:43.658 --> 01:41:47.139]  Where we just trust them and drink water that stinks.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.901]  And then they have all these sitcoms and dramas and movies where they make fun of people that don't trust the tap water.
[01:41:54.921 --> 01:41:58.602]  You know, they'll just stop in the middle of Frasier and... Oh, he's a kook!
[01:41:58.622 --> 01:42:00.023]  He probably thinks the tap water isn't safe!
[01:42:00.283 --> 01:42:00.943]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:42:01.203 --> 01:42:02.263]  Probably doesn't like the new old water!
[01:42:02.383 --> 01:42:03.704]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:04.864]  That was actually in an episode.
[01:42:05.784 --> 01:42:07.004]  Or, you know, Dr. Strangelove.
[01:42:07.044 --> 01:42:12.286]  You know, you're an insane murdering killer that's gonna nuke the Earth if you believe sodium fluoride's bad for you.
[01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:14.931]  So just don't believe us folks.
[01:42:14.971 --> 01:42:20.653]  Just believe the government and drink water that a fish won't live in.
[01:42:21.293 --> 01:42:21.573]  Do it!
[01:42:21.613 --> 01:42:22.273]  Go to the store.
[01:42:23.374 --> 01:42:29.796]  Get a goldfish and put the goldfish in the tap water and it will die!
[01:42:29.816 --> 01:42:32.277]  It will die!
[01:42:32.297 --> 01:42:34.658]  I'll say it again.
[01:42:35.198 --> 01:42:37.099]  It will die!
[01:42:37.119 --> 01:42:42.621]  The pigs won't eat the genetically modified corn.
[01:42:46.212 --> 01:42:47.012]  Why is that?
[01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:50.193]  Why is that the case?
[01:42:51.053 --> 01:42:53.353]  Well, because the pigs are with Al-Qaeda!
[01:42:54.854 --> 01:42:56.674]  They're trying to overthrow the government!
[01:42:57.954 --> 01:43:00.795]  Anyone who doesn't worship the government is with Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:02.375 --> 01:43:04.035]  We've got to learn this mindset!
[01:43:05.216 --> 01:43:06.096]  Just trust them!
[01:43:06.896 --> 01:43:11.437]  You know, police and military, if the government loves you so much, why do they tell you to drink the tap water too?
[01:43:11.537 --> 01:43:12.817]  If they love you so much, why do they
[01:43:14.306 --> 01:43:15.567]  Have you breathed depleted uranium?
[01:43:15.587 --> 01:43:16.448]  Do they love you so much?
[01:43:17.949 --> 01:43:19.110]  No, you're eating this stuff too.
[01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:19.911]  Your children are eating it.
[01:43:19.931 --> 01:43:20.912]  Do you love your children?
[01:43:21.592 --> 01:43:21.992]  No, no, no.
[01:43:22.012 --> 01:43:22.953]  You love the government.
[01:43:23.954 --> 01:43:27.857]  You're sacrificing this culture on the altar of the New World Order.
[01:43:29.298 --> 01:43:31.480]  Uh, let's, uh... Who's up next here?
[01:43:34.283 --> 01:43:35.103]  Rick in Baltimore.
[01:43:35.143 --> 01:43:35.744]  Go ahead, Rick.
[01:43:36.344 --> 01:43:36.685]  Hey!
[01:43:37.825 --> 01:43:38.926]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:43:39.127 --> 01:43:39.527]  Good, sir.
[01:43:40.228 --> 01:43:41.849]  I haven't talked to you in a few years.
[01:43:41.929 --> 01:43:43.190]  I've known you from day one.
[01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:45.291]  Well, I'm evil because I don't like to have water.
[01:43:45.411 --> 01:43:45.752]  Go ahead.
[01:43:46.112 --> 01:43:48.894]  Well, you remember Sheldon Wyatt?
[01:43:49.314 --> 01:43:51.475]  We sent you some videos.
[01:43:51.555 --> 01:43:53.116]  I recognize your voice!
[01:43:53.637 --> 01:43:57.499]  You're the guys that shot the video of the Marines practicing taking over the city.
[01:43:58.079 --> 01:44:01.782]  And then was that you the troops walk over to and say, turn your camera off?
[01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:03.083]  That was Sheldon.
[01:44:03.463 --> 01:44:05.144]  And the sheriff come and locked him up.
[01:44:05.664 --> 01:44:06.984]  Yeah, if we're taping all this.
[01:44:07.485 --> 01:44:09.125]  No, because it's such freedom!
[01:44:09.165 --> 01:44:18.168]  He's out on the side of the street videotaping the military practicing taking over the city, and they have the 10-year-old kids as tattletale squads telling them where the gun owners are?
[01:44:18.428 --> 01:44:19.268]  That's in Police State 2000!
[01:44:19.468 --> 01:44:21.369]  That's our new freedom!
[01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:23.630]  Because you may have been with Al-Qaeda!
[01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:26.731]  Because you wanted to videotape a god!
[01:44:27.051 --> 01:44:30.752]  And then who's been appointing the generals for the last 20 years?
[01:44:31.292 --> 01:44:36.036]  A guy from Michigan, Leavitt, and John Warner on the Armed Services Committee.
[01:44:36.396 --> 01:44:37.196]  All controlled.
[01:44:37.557 --> 01:44:41.179]  But Alex, I want to tell the people how right you were about the Oklahoma bombing.
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.280]  Okay?
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:52.047]  Go to WorldNetDaily, they've got a story on there, where this judge has asked for documents to be released from the FBI, undedacted.
[01:44:52.587 --> 01:45:00.693]  And it's come out today that the Southern Law Property Center had an informer in there as a sting operation, okay?
[01:45:01.769 --> 01:45:03.471]  You gotta get this story out there.
[01:45:04.192 --> 01:45:05.033]  And you were right!
[01:45:05.374 --> 01:45:05.994]  You were right!
[01:45:06.355 --> 01:45:11.141]  So I'm telling you, Alex Jones is telling you the truth of everything.
[01:45:12.383 --> 01:45:13.284]  Well, we try our best.
[01:45:13.304 --> 01:45:13.905]  We're about 95% right.
[01:45:14.025 --> 01:45:15.587]  I mean, I make mistakes.
[01:45:15.727 --> 01:45:16.428]  I gotta give you 99.
[01:45:18.791 --> 01:45:21.093]  Well, actually, I mean, everybody knew this years ago.
[01:45:21.153 --> 01:45:27.278]  We've had Colonel Roberts on and countless others who worked the case, and that's part of a wheel within a wheel.
[01:45:27.718 --> 01:45:42.070]  You've got Elohim sitting with Andrei Strassmayer, the son of the top Nazi, who openly works for the, what is it, GSGQ, I forget the exact name of the German secret sub-intelligence anti-terror directorate.
[01:45:43.062 --> 01:45:45.564]  But it's like GSGQX or something.
[01:45:46.345 --> 01:45:47.506]  It's in some of my films.
[01:45:47.986 --> 01:45:50.167]  They got him in there with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:45:50.187 --> 01:45:51.068]  They actually run it.
[01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:53.410]  Southern Poverty Law Center didn't just have informants.
[01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:54.270]  They were running it.
[01:45:54.991 --> 01:46:04.958]  And they were trying to get poor idiot right-wingers and white supremacists tied in with them to try to blame it on white supremacists and Arabs and go after both groups.
[01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:07.280]  But it didn't work as well because Carol Howell
[01:46:08.098 --> 01:46:28.014]  The informant had already blown the whistle that they were going to do this, so they had to compartmentalize and only do part of the operation, and leave the Arabs out, and also leave the white supremacists out, just use their patsy, who they of course tortured into submission, McVeigh, and gave him a public mind control doctor, John Wayne West, who was in the MKL4 hearings in the 70s, was his doctor until the day they killed him, and he since died.
[01:46:29.355 --> 01:46:32.377]  But let me just finish this, and I haven't read the article, but I know that
[01:46:32.975 --> 01:46:40.117]  That it has come out, the document has been released, I guess now they want it formally, that the Southern Poverty Law Center knew.
[01:46:41.197 --> 01:46:45.599]  And of course, it's like the FBI cooking the bomb and training the driver in the First World Trade Center bombing.
[01:46:45.919 --> 01:46:54.161]  They cook it, they build it, they do it, and then, you know, their wind-up toys do it, and then they dance around going, give us your rights, give us your rights!
[01:46:54.501 --> 01:46:55.261]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:55.702 --> 01:47:00.243]  And then they try to get the bills passed with pressure to take away your guns!
[01:47:01.204 --> 01:47:03.506]  Well, I mean, folks, ask yourself a two-year-old question.
[01:47:04.386 --> 01:47:08.169]  Does a, does a blowing up a federal building help conservatives and militias?
[01:47:08.609 --> 01:47:09.049]  No!
[01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:13.072]  Does it help the Arabs to fly planes into the Empire's buildings?
[01:47:13.452 --> 01:47:13.893]  No!
[01:47:14.233 --> 01:47:16.915]  Does it help the Chechens to bomb Russian apartment buildings?
[01:47:17.295 --> 01:47:17.875]  No!
[01:47:18.176 --> 01:47:21.778]  And then you look at the evidence, it's the people that stand to gain!
[01:47:22.078 --> 01:47:22.779]  It's the government!
[01:47:22.799 --> 01:47:26.201]  And remember, they're sending tanks after children in their wake up!
[01:47:26.261 --> 01:47:26.621]  Tanks!
[01:47:27.982 --> 01:47:28.982]  Oh, I love you.
[01:47:29.002 --> 01:47:31.603]  Hey, Rick, you haven't called in about four years.
[01:47:31.663 --> 01:47:32.843]  I just love your voice.
[01:47:33.243 --> 01:47:34.004]  I know.
[01:47:34.424 --> 01:47:37.304]  Alex, you're marvelous.
[01:47:37.444 --> 01:47:38.105]  Hang in there.
[01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:38.945]  God bless you.
[01:47:39.345 --> 01:47:40.565]  And wake up, America.
[01:47:40.705 --> 01:47:42.666]  Hey, brother, where you been all these years, Rick?
[01:47:44.486 --> 01:47:45.326]  He's already gone.
[01:47:46.286 --> 01:47:47.707]  That's a ghost from the past.
[01:47:48.547 --> 01:47:49.747]  A blast from the past.
[01:47:50.407 --> 01:47:52.148]  Man, if I'd have known that, it would have been that, Rick.
[01:47:52.168 --> 01:47:53.628]  Yeah, you ought to search in Police State 2000.
[01:47:54.088 --> 01:47:54.548]  Imagine.
[01:47:54.989 --> 01:47:56.609]  They live right down the street.
[01:47:57.708 --> 01:48:02.814]  In the town next to Hebron, Maryland, they drive, you know, 20 miles.
[01:48:03.274 --> 01:48:05.416]  They show up and there's troops stomping around.
[01:48:05.436 --> 01:48:11.002]  And they walk over and it shows the Marines taking over the city hall and there's kids running around.
[01:48:11.583 --> 01:48:14.306]  And they got neighbors who allow them to do mock gun confiscations.
[01:48:14.366 --> 01:48:15.547]  They admit it's for America.
[01:48:16.828 --> 01:48:17.189]  That was in 1998.
[01:48:17.309 --> 01:48:18.790]  It was in Police Day 2000.
[01:48:20.792 --> 01:48:26.096]  And, uh, they're just out there videotaping and cops walk over with troops with machine guns behind them and arrest them.
[01:48:26.516 --> 01:48:27.657]  What are you doing with that camera?
[01:48:28.538 --> 01:48:29.358]  Hey, what are you doing?
[01:48:30.639 --> 01:48:31.119]  Well, nothing.
[01:48:31.179 --> 01:48:32.160]  I'm filming.
[01:48:32.921 --> 01:48:33.701]  Alright, come with me.
[01:48:33.781 --> 01:48:34.822]  And the camera turns off.
[01:48:36.563 --> 01:48:38.445]  That's your freedom!
[01:48:39.165 --> 01:48:42.888]  Look at the, uh, Christian Science Monitor three days ago.
[01:48:44.449 --> 01:48:47.551]  There's no law you can't film, but they're arresting people all over.
[01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:52.442]  I mean, accredited news cameras.
[01:48:53.563 --> 01:48:55.144]  They're setting the precedent.
[01:48:56.865 --> 01:48:58.206]  They're setting the precedent.
[01:48:59.167 --> 01:48:59.888]  They're doing it.
[01:49:00.928 --> 01:49:02.129]  Folks, you wonder why I've been freaking out.
[01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:03.130]  People go, Alex Jones?
[01:49:03.771 --> 01:49:04.431]  Fear mongers!
[01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:12.718]  Well, I mean, I got video of 1999 and I went to the Urban Warrior Drill and they had the role players playing the parts of Americans having their guns taken!
[01:49:12.898 --> 01:49:15.400]  I mean, I'm watching foreign groups trying to take my guns!
[01:49:18.917 --> 01:49:23.438]  I'm being called a black helicopter nut fork because I went and videotaped the black helicopters?
[01:49:25.379 --> 01:49:26.979]  And the police chief's throwing them out of the city.
[01:49:26.999 --> 01:49:28.580]  We're trying to bribe them in San Antonio?
[01:49:31.781 --> 01:49:34.002]  I mean, that's all we ever did was cover the facts.
[01:49:37.163 --> 01:49:38.983]  Ah, you know, I forget all the stuff that's in my videos.
[01:49:39.043 --> 01:49:44.225]  I mean, it's just, they got little kids, 10-year-olds, 11-year-olds, riding around on their bikes and the Marines talk to them.
[01:49:44.645 --> 01:49:44.865]  No!
[01:49:45.623 --> 01:49:47.347]  You'll tell me where the guns are?
[01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:48.651]  Yes, sir!
[01:49:48.671 --> 01:49:51.317]  Mwahahahaha!
[01:49:53.709 --> 01:50:00.553]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.853 --> 01:50:02.234]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.434 --> 01:50:04.655]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.795 --> 01:50:06.876]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.156 --> 01:50:12.079]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.419 --> 01:50:16.441]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.701 --> 01:50:18.482]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.562 --> 01:50:29.204]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.344 --> 01:50:31.245]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.445 --> 01:50:34.986]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the info
[01:50:35.106 --> 01:50:35.486]  We're good.
[01:50:53.237 --> 01:50:58.463]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.603 --> 01:51:06.713]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.953 --> 01:51:14.001]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.181 --> 01:51:15.462]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:15.542 --> 01:51:21.426]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.626 --> 01:51:26.710]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:35.716]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.976 --> 01:51:39.279]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:53:02.914 --> 01:53:07.236]  I haven't been to an Urban Warrior operation in about three years.
[01:53:07.676 --> 01:53:13.298]  And I'm told, even from press reports, they're now admitting it, it's about five times worse.
[01:53:13.959 --> 01:53:15.299]  Big one going on in Maryland right now.
[01:53:15.319 --> 01:53:17.840]  They're going all over the place on a weekly basis.
[01:53:19.381 --> 01:53:20.841]  And it's just horrible.
[01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:22.102]  I wish I had time to go to these.
[01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.022]  Maybe you can go to these.
[01:53:23.749 --> 01:53:30.910]  We had a listener, we put it in Police Day 2, the takeover, who went to one in Swansboro, North Carolina.
[01:53:33.871 --> 01:53:35.191]  Swansboro, Alabama.
[01:53:35.231 --> 01:53:37.212]  Man, I tell ya, I gotta go re-watch those films.
[01:53:37.792 --> 01:53:43.313]  And he's there, and the troops walk over, and they're actually running checkpoints, pulling people out of cars.
[01:53:43.593 --> 01:53:44.773]  It wasn't role-players.
[01:53:45.954 --> 01:53:49.714]  Oh, we're here aiding the Sheriff today, part of the drill, but it's real.
[01:53:51.255 --> 01:53:52.695]  I mean, that's how crazy
[01:53:54.125 --> 01:53:55.066]  All of this is getting.
[01:53:56.346 --> 01:53:58.267]  So I suggest you go out to these events.
[01:54:00.848 --> 01:54:04.030]  I don't know if I'm arresting cameramen except at one of those events.
[01:54:04.050 --> 01:54:06.131]  But that was back in 98 when they were trying to keep it secret.
[01:54:06.471 --> 01:54:10.913]  Now they'll just, I got like Colonel Love on tape in Police State 2000 in 99.
[01:54:11.314 --> 01:54:14.135]  A year later going, yeah this is for domestic, yeah sure.
[01:54:15.276 --> 01:54:17.096]  So before it was real secretive.
[01:54:17.137 --> 01:54:20.318]  Now it's just, yeah it is, you like it?
[01:54:20.898 --> 01:54:21.899]  I mean it's out of control.
[01:54:23.564 --> 01:54:29.010]  I promise when we start the next hour I'll go right to Gary and David and Larry and everybody, but I need to get to this because I mentioned it earlier.
[01:54:30.852 --> 01:54:34.635]  Just some background, the Dallas Morning News about two months ago in the Brownsville paper.
[01:54:34.655 --> 01:54:39.320]  It was also mentioned on some San Antonio news stations.
[01:54:40.762 --> 01:54:43.364]  Mexican Special Forces troops trained by the U.S.
[01:54:43.384 --> 01:54:45.707]  government and they still work for them, they're enforcers.
[01:54:46.553 --> 01:54:52.255]  They go out and kill the cartels and kill people that don't play ball, that don't pay their cut, because they're doing all this.
[01:54:52.555 --> 01:54:56.576]  They've got a claim, oh they're acting on their own!
[01:54:57.817 --> 01:55:02.698]  And they've blown up a couple cars in Dallas, they machine gun, they kill people in their houses, burn their houses down.
[01:55:03.939 --> 01:55:10.261]  They've been connected to murders in Austin, murders in San Antonio, and they're enforcers!
[01:55:11.581 --> 01:55:13.082]  Just like 25% of the military in Iraq,
[01:55:15.146 --> 01:55:22.790]  I worry legal aliens and now they're legal and it's like the Germans were used by the British to come into America in 1776, the Hessian troops.
[01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:24.130]  It's the same thing.
[01:55:24.891 --> 01:55:30.073]  And the reason you know it's a globalist op is not just all the background, but also this only makes it in local papers.
[01:55:30.113 --> 01:55:35.556]  You never hear it nationally unless we break that monopoly here on this broadcast.
[01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:41.919]  But the newest one came out a couple days ago and
[01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:47.471]  It's from KPHO.
[01:55:48.912 --> 01:55:50.693]  Mexican Drug Commandos.
[01:55:50.733 --> 01:55:52.234]  Let me get this posted on InfoWars.
[01:55:52.274 --> 01:55:53.295]  I forgot to tell my webmaster.
[01:55:53.755 --> 01:55:57.037]  They were the elite special forces of the Mexican military, trained in the U.S.
[01:55:57.077 --> 01:55:58.158]  in the School of Americas.
[01:55:58.698 --> 01:56:00.459]  That's the torture school at Fort Benning.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:03.281]  Just like the Iraqi Republican Guard were!
[01:56:04.119 --> 01:56:06.501]  That were involved in bombing.
[01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.622]  They were trained at a nearby base that trains Arabs.
[01:56:09.102 --> 01:56:09.983]  Were involved in bombing.
[01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:10.803]  Okay, see?
[01:56:10.903 --> 01:56:12.224]  Job well done!
[01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:16.046]  They were the elite special forces of Mexican military, trained in the U.S.
[01:56:16.066 --> 01:56:22.591]  at the School of Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia, and set to wipe out one of the most powerful Mexican drug cartels.
[01:56:22.991 --> 01:56:27.734]  But these soldiers deserted and became the muscle of the very cartel they were supposed to destroy.
[01:56:28.374 --> 01:56:38.281]  According to this Department of Justice Intelligence Bulletin obtained by Five Eye Team, these rogue commandos, now known as Los Zetas, may be heading our way.
[01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:39.062]  This is Arizona.
[01:56:40.263 --> 01:56:46.267]  The normally busy streets and busy stores in Nogales, Sonora, have been a little less bustling lately.
[01:56:47.528 --> 01:56:49.029]  Cesar Ferrero says,
[01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:52.392]  It's been slow this year, Cesar Feroz says.
[01:56:52.412 --> 01:56:55.154]  This empty store is the result of rumors about a drug war.
[01:56:55.494 --> 01:56:56.395]  Terrorists are scared.
[01:56:56.735 --> 01:56:58.957]  Yeah, no one goes down there now, because it is a hellhole.
[01:56:58.977 --> 01:56:59.637]  It isn't rumors.
[01:57:01.219 --> 01:57:06.703]  The Intelligence Bulletin was obtained, it says, Zetas and responsible for hundreds of violent drug-related murders.
[01:57:07.163 --> 01:57:07.644]  Hundreds?
[01:57:07.864 --> 01:57:08.284]  Hmm.
[01:57:08.945 --> 01:57:10.326]  It says, but it's kept secret.
[01:57:10.346 --> 01:57:11.607]  See, it's a secret bulletin.
[01:57:12.348 --> 01:57:13.489]  Cop killers, you name it.
[01:57:13.549 --> 01:57:15.230]  Cop cuts down on the CIA drugs.
[01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:16.511]  Mexican hit team.
[01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:18.052]  Hardcore assassins.
[01:57:18.112 --> 01:57:18.833]  They come your way.
[01:57:19.857 --> 01:57:22.179]  Mexican Mafia is in the CIA's shit pocket.
[01:57:22.739 --> 01:57:27.883]  And Bush says, Amnesty, open borders, Border Patrol, stand down!
[01:57:28.583 --> 01:57:32.826]  It says they've executed journalists, murdered people in Dallas, McAllen, and Laredo, Texas.
[01:57:33.066 --> 01:57:35.788]  They're even, this is the article, I'm going to continue with it.
[01:57:36.188 --> 01:57:39.471]  They've even murdered federal agents, Border Patrol.
[01:57:39.551 --> 01:57:40.571]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.022 --> 01:57:50.683]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.323 --> 01:57:52.404]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.104 --> 01:57:54.185]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.846 --> 01:57:55.706]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.447 --> 01:57:58.368]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.388 --> 01:58:01.831]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.171 --> 01:58:06.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.975 --> 01:58:13.780]  Alright, I was ranting and raving, ranting and raving in the last segment, as I read a
[01:58:15.439 --> 01:58:29.105]  Justice Department internal intelligence bulletin, not to be shared, that Mexican troops in full body armor and communications are running around killing federal agents, shooting people, murdering, they're responsible for hundreds of deaths.
[01:58:29.185 --> 01:58:30.566]  Again, here's the intelligence bulletin.
[01:58:32.006 --> 01:58:40.350]  In Dallas, McAllen, Laredo, it goes on and on and on, and that now tourists won't even go into the southern areas of
[01:58:42.066 --> 01:58:47.568]  of Arizona, where this is also going on, and I have the Dallas Morning News, the only big paper to mention it.
[01:58:49.768 --> 01:58:55.370]  The Laredo paper covered it, and folks, they're not former Mexican Special Forces.
[01:58:55.410 --> 01:58:56.631]  They admit trained by the U.S.
[01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:57.011]  government.
[01:58:57.051 --> 01:58:57.891]  They are hit men.
[01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.252]  They're there to kill Border Patrol.
[01:59:00.652 --> 01:59:01.912]  They're there to kill citizens.
[01:59:02.392 --> 01:59:03.653]  They're there to kill Minutemen.
[01:59:04.253 --> 01:59:07.374]  They're there to go kill rival drug gangs.
[01:59:08.795 --> 01:59:09.916]  I mean, it's just like these other U.S.
[01:59:09.936 --> 01:59:10.636]  military bases.
[01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:12.118]  I've got the articles from the mid-90s.
[01:59:12.438 --> 01:59:16.201]  You know, thousands of Arabs come through a year in the small Alabama military base.
[01:59:16.441 --> 01:59:17.481]  They hear explosions.
[01:59:17.822 --> 01:59:19.183]  They practice terror attacks.
[01:59:19.703 --> 01:59:22.045]  And then they go ship them back and you know them as Al-Qaeda.
[01:59:24.166 --> 01:59:28.149]  And they'll occasionally arrest some innocent person and say they're a top Al-Qaeda leader.
[01:59:28.610 --> 01:59:30.471]  And people just can't figure this out.
[01:59:30.511 --> 01:59:32.072]  You just can't get it through your heads.
[01:59:34.234 --> 01:59:37.056]  That pretty scary article I was just reading, I'll read some more of it.
[01:59:37.805 --> 01:59:38.565]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:59:38.586 --> 01:59:39.446]  Alex Jones for President, baby!
[01:59:59.618 --> 02:00:00.479]  Are you running?
[02:00:00.499 --> 02:00:01.139]  Huh?
[02:00:01.579 --> 02:00:02.240]  What did you say?
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.480]  Are you going to run for president?
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:04.281]  No, I'm not.
[02:00:05.061 --> 02:00:06.102]  You don't have voting anymore.
[02:00:06.922 --> 02:00:07.302]  That's right.
[02:00:07.322 --> 02:00:09.503]  With the new computer systems, we're not going to have that anymore.
[02:00:09.523 --> 02:00:11.985]  They're in at 35% now and shouldn't have total control.
[02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:12.745]  Yeah, I know.
[02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:15.266]  It's funny when that whole scandal came out in Ohio.
[02:00:15.286 --> 02:00:17.768]  It carried back right out when that started coming out.
[02:00:18.408 --> 02:00:20.469]  But anyways, I have a question for you, Alex.
[02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:22.950]  Someone as yourself that's very informed.
[02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:23.651]  Are you still there?
[02:00:24.071 --> 02:00:24.251]  Yes.
[02:00:24.915 --> 02:00:27.096]  Someone that's used in forms such as David Ike.
[02:00:27.136 --> 02:00:34.540]  Why, I mean, if the government can kill 3,000 people in the blink of an eye, why haven't they taken someone like yourself that's making waves?
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:38.182]  Why haven't they terminated you or anyone else that speaks out?
[02:00:39.743 --> 02:00:40.944]  How often do you listen?
[02:00:41.984 --> 02:00:42.725]  Uh, pretty often.
[02:00:43.185 --> 02:00:46.027]  Well, I mean, I've answered this question about 150 times.
[02:00:46.487 --> 02:00:49.609]  Honestly, sir, I actually just watched about two weeks ago.
[02:00:49.629 --> 02:00:53.551]  I woke up, I watched In Plain Sight and The Road to Tyranny.
[02:00:54.486 --> 02:00:56.027]  I wasn't able to eat for about a week.
[02:00:58.147 --> 02:01:00.448]  So, me and my buddy have been watching the films a lot lately.
[02:01:00.528 --> 02:01:02.109]  Well, it's an important question.
[02:01:02.169 --> 02:01:05.090]  Let me cover it when we get back from break, because it'll take a few minutes.
[02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:14.193]  I guess to answer the question now, they kill people who have specific documents that they'll have to cover up.
[02:01:15.638 --> 02:01:18.039]  Once you bring the document out, they don't generally kill you.
[02:01:18.219 --> 02:01:22.101]  It's like Jennifer Flowers got up on hardball and said Bill Clinton's killed.
[02:01:22.121 --> 02:01:22.981]  This was like five years ago.
[02:01:23.341 --> 02:01:24.902]  Bill Clinton's had over 100 people killed.
[02:01:24.922 --> 02:01:26.542]  And Chris Matthews said, well, why are you still alive?
[02:01:26.562 --> 02:01:28.343]  She said, because I'm going public.
[02:01:28.483 --> 02:01:29.243]  I've written the book.
[02:01:29.924 --> 02:01:30.664]  I've gone public.
[02:01:30.704 --> 02:01:33.145]  If he kills me, it'll just make people pay more attention to it.
[02:01:33.992 --> 02:01:37.033]  That's why they obviously killed Gary Webb because he was on the new stuff.
[02:01:37.253 --> 02:01:39.253]  Yeah, so you think you're pretty much protected because of that?
[02:01:39.273 --> 02:01:40.373]  No, I don't think I'm protected.
[02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:42.674]  They do still kill people like me routinely.
[02:01:43.254 --> 02:01:44.174]  And I've been death-threatened.
[02:01:44.214 --> 02:01:45.414]  I've been physically attacked, sir.
[02:01:45.574 --> 02:01:45.814]  Really?
[02:01:45.834 --> 02:01:47.494]  Do you have bodyguards or anything like that?
[02:01:47.534 --> 02:01:47.835]  No!
[02:01:48.135 --> 02:01:49.075]  We're all going to die!
[02:01:49.855 --> 02:01:51.375]  Sir, let me tell you something.
[02:01:52.635 --> 02:01:53.596]  Do you have an automobile?
[02:01:53.996 --> 02:01:54.196]  Yes.
[02:01:54.856 --> 02:01:56.276]  Do you drive in that car?
[02:01:56.576 --> 02:01:59.056]  Yeah, I'm forced to drive 45 minutes each way for work.
[02:01:59.477 --> 02:02:01.657]  And you drive 70 miles an hour on the highway?
[02:02:03.012 --> 02:02:07.635]  In a little tin foil aluminum shell next to huge 18 wheelers.
[02:02:08.336 --> 02:02:12.139]  And I bet you drive by fatal fatalities five or six times a year.
[02:02:12.399 --> 02:02:15.381]  Yeah, honestly, I see... So you drive by dead bodies.
[02:02:15.801 --> 02:02:19.504]  Imagine if you were driving by dead bodies of people killed by the government every month.
[02:02:20.518 --> 02:02:21.798]  Yeah, how would I be able to tell though?
[02:02:22.099 --> 02:02:27.020]  Well, no, see, but the point I'm making is the number one cause of death is transportation.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:27.540]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.801 --> 02:02:30.461]  But you still take that risk every day to drive.
[02:02:30.762 --> 02:02:33.362]  Well, I'll take a risk to die for my country!
[02:02:33.743 --> 02:02:34.943]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[02:02:34.963 --> 02:02:42.566]  You know, I mean, it's an important thing to really, but see, you're, you're, people are deep down afraid of the predatory nature of that death at government's hands.
[02:02:42.766 --> 02:02:43.146]  Stay there.
[02:02:43.266 --> 02:02:43.706]  Talk about it.
[02:02:45.606 --> 02:02:49.972]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.133 --> 02:02:54.539]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.719 --> 02:02:59.106]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.146 --> 02:03:00.467]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.224 --> 02:03:02.165]  Panama!
[02:03:02.245 --> 02:03:06.487]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.547 --> 02:03:13.470]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:15.691]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.951 --> 02:03:26.276]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.596 --> 02:03:31.979]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:03:58.222 --> 02:04:02.906]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.366 --> 02:04:10.090]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:22.278]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:22.738 --> 02:04:27.200]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:04:44.907 --> 02:04:47.269]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:47.529 --> 02:04:51.373]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:51.673 --> 02:04:52.494]  Read the labels.
[02:04:52.934 --> 02:04:57.038]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.278 --> 02:05:01.461]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:01.842 --> 02:05:06.706]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:07.086 --> 02:05:10.668]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:52.971]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:03.148 --> 02:06:04.890]  We're talking to David in mass.
[02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:07.973]  And I get this question every day.
[02:06:08.493 --> 02:06:10.535]  Email, faxes, calls on air.
[02:06:12.357 --> 02:06:15.960]  Alex Jones, how are you still alive if what you're saying is true?
[02:06:16.701 --> 02:06:17.762]  Why haven't you been killed?
[02:06:17.862 --> 02:06:19.624]  Well, I have been death-threatened.
[02:06:20.865 --> 02:06:26.490]  The worst ever, when they even put stalkers on me, I mean real ones that even admitted they were with the government,
[02:06:29.153 --> 02:06:32.175]  Was when I was exposing Judge Walter E. Smith in Waco.
[02:06:32.435 --> 02:06:35.476]  Clinton was really scared of Waco because that could have brought him down.
[02:06:36.857 --> 02:06:40.939]  And the judge wouldn't allow a jury in the civil trial in a lawsuit.
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:49.643]  And they've been found not guilty by a jury, but the same judge was over the criminal trial in 94.
[02:06:51.184 --> 02:06:55.026]  And so they found him not guilty, the Davidians, but then he said, no, I find you guilty.
[02:06:55.046 --> 02:06:56.387]  So he's a guy who just
[02:06:56.992 --> 02:06:58.412]  Literally rules from the bench.
[02:06:58.452 --> 02:07:15.557]  The Supreme Court said in 99 you gotta release the civilians that are in jail, the five of them, from their 47 year sentences because they were found not guilty of committing a crime, attempted murder, so then how can they be found guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a crime if they were found not guilty of a crime?
[02:07:17.058 --> 02:07:19.298]  Okay, and he used federal sentencing on them.
[02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:23.699]  But still, they've never been released.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.380]  I mean, and we're talking six years later.
[02:07:26.411 --> 02:07:29.473]  So I was bullhorning the federal courthouse in Waco.
[02:07:29.533 --> 02:07:30.433]  I was demonstrating.
[02:07:30.493 --> 02:07:36.676]  I was building a memorial church for those that died.
[02:07:37.497 --> 02:07:42.019]  And with your help, the listeners, and I mean, it was unbelievable, the stuff that went on.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.661]  The death threats, you know, all the stuff that went on.
[02:07:46.762 --> 02:07:52.985]  I had people break in on the ISDN line, which you're not supposed to be able to do, and death threat me while I was, you know, on air.
[02:07:53.857 --> 02:07:57.418]  I had, you know, unlisted phone numbers, people calling, people at my front door.
[02:07:59.899 --> 02:08:14.325]  Even before that, when I started fighting the New World Order, in about 1997, I'd been on the radio for a year or two, and these guys were doing all this stuff, and harassing me, and doing all these horrible things, and it finally came down to this, you know, we're with the government, you better stop what you're doing.
[02:08:14.345 --> 02:08:17.286]  And I said, you know, you're a bunch of cowards, you do whatever you have to.
[02:08:17.306 --> 02:08:21.988]  So I walk outside the TV station, and these four guys get around me.
[02:08:24.119 --> 02:08:25.760]  And they tell me I better stop what I'm doing.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.160]  And one of them pulls out a knife to distract me.
[02:08:28.621 --> 02:08:30.181]  And the biggest one hauls off.
[02:08:30.221 --> 02:08:31.321]  They're wearing hoods over their heads.
[02:08:31.581 --> 02:08:33.042]  There are surveillance cameras out front.
[02:08:33.682 --> 02:08:35.703]  Hauls off and punches me right in the nose.
[02:08:35.763 --> 02:08:36.483]  Breaks my nose.
[02:08:37.684 --> 02:08:38.704]  Well, that just made me mad.
[02:08:39.744 --> 02:08:41.465]  I was mainly worried about the knife.
[02:08:42.125 --> 02:08:43.565]  So I rotated around.
[02:08:44.566 --> 02:08:46.406]  And, you know, I'm not trying to toot my horn.
[02:08:46.426 --> 02:08:49.007]  I'm not into physical prowess and being a tough guy.
[02:08:49.027 --> 02:08:51.088]  But you can tell I'm pretty much a nut, folks.
[02:08:51.929 --> 02:08:53.350]  And so I started hurting them real bad.
[02:08:53.370 --> 02:08:56.531]  I mean, knocking teeth out, crushing noses off, pile-driving heads.
[02:08:56.551 --> 02:09:01.493]  I mean, when four people go at you, I mean, if you turn it on, folks, you got, it's dangerous.
[02:09:01.513 --> 02:09:12.918]  I mean, that's, the funny thing about, I used to be quite a fighter growing up in Dallas, and the few times I wasn't in the right, and maybe at a bonfire or something, had a few too many Budweisers, I was pretty bad.
[02:09:13.899 --> 02:09:14.939]  But I wasn't what you'd call a bully.
[02:09:16.852 --> 02:09:23.478]  It'd be easy to put some 245 pound, you know, muscle-bound guy who just got out of prison who attacked me, because stuff was rough growing up.
[02:09:24.018 --> 02:09:25.580]  It'd be easy to put that guy in a coma.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.244]  I mean, you just start pounding him in the face and pick him up and slam their head in the ground.
[02:09:31.365 --> 02:09:32.045]  It's over for him.
[02:09:32.626 --> 02:09:35.929]  So I really got away from, you know, fighting and stuff because it was so dangerous.
[02:09:36.469 --> 02:09:38.231]  And I started figuring out, I'm going to kill somebody.
[02:09:38.731 --> 02:09:41.594]  But the few times that I was in the wrong,
[02:09:42.688 --> 02:09:47.011]  I'd end up getting my tail kicked when I was fighting some 180-pound guy the same size as I was at the time.
[02:09:47.972 --> 02:09:49.112]  Because there wasn't a threat.
[02:09:50.073 --> 02:09:54.996]  There wasn't any... I mean, I've got to have really mean people coming at me.
[02:09:55.016 --> 02:10:08.285]  I've got people coming up with knives, guns... I don't want to get into how I was when I was a teenager, but... And then it gets into a scenario of, you know, you're a fighter, so people want to fight you.
[02:10:08.425 --> 02:10:08.985]  It was different.
[02:10:09.225 --> 02:10:10.386]  Austin's really docile.
[02:10:10.726 --> 02:10:11.447]  I love this town.
[02:10:12.425 --> 02:10:14.786]  I wouldn't want to get in a fight today.
[02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:17.127]  I mean, all my knuckles are broken.
[02:10:17.207 --> 02:10:21.229]  They're polarized jelly with just tendons in them in my right hand.
[02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:26.551]  I had my leg broken in a fight, you know, with the bones sticking out.
[02:10:27.632 --> 02:10:29.252]  Shawn, that's the type of fights I got into.
[02:10:30.033 --> 02:10:35.095]  But the few times that I wasn't in the right are the times that I just couldn't fight.
[02:10:37.096 --> 02:10:38.276]  It's kind of like a cornered animal.
[02:10:38.496 --> 02:10:39.877]  But these four guys get around me.
[02:10:40.606 --> 02:10:43.748]  And man, the guy hauls off and just smashes my nose.
[02:10:44.108 --> 02:10:47.951]  I think it freaked him out, too, that blood was squirting out all over him and it didn't seem to bother me.
[02:10:47.971 --> 02:10:49.492]  I mean, I bled like a stuck pig.
[02:10:49.512 --> 02:10:51.794]  You should have seen the inside of that building once I went in.
[02:10:51.814 --> 02:10:54.916]  I mean, it was like spraying like a water hose out of my nose.
[02:10:56.196 --> 02:11:01.000]  My head had already been broken so many times that it was like a rubber eraser or something.
[02:11:02.241 --> 02:11:05.202]  And so I start just pounding the living daylights out of these guys.
[02:11:06.543 --> 02:11:10.186]  And that was the last fight I ever got in
[02:11:10.925 --> 02:11:11.465]  Thank God.
[02:11:11.485 --> 02:11:12.886]  And they all dragged him.
[02:11:12.946 --> 02:11:14.887]  I mean, one of them's nose was literally hanging off.
[02:11:15.287 --> 02:11:16.948]  You know, bones hanging out, cartilage.
[02:11:17.929 --> 02:11:20.230]  Uh, just, I mean, he basically had no nose.
[02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:21.411]  It, like, ripped his nose off.
[02:11:22.451 --> 02:11:24.212]  And, uh, so they're helping each other with their vehicles.
[02:11:24.773 --> 02:11:27.254]  And I'm, like, screaming at them with blood running down my face.
[02:11:28.074 --> 02:11:30.756]  And, uh, the police show up.
[02:11:31.756 --> 02:11:32.837]  I mean, like, two minutes later.
[02:11:32.857 --> 02:11:34.038]  And it was a blue Astro van.
[02:11:34.058 --> 02:11:35.499]  They go and look at the surveillance camera tape.
[02:11:35.739 --> 02:11:36.679]  They get the license number.
[02:11:36.699 --> 02:11:38.020]  They say the license doesn't exist.
[02:11:39.392 --> 02:11:50.020]  And there's this little short butch cop, female, and then she's with an old black cop, male, he was nice, and she's wanting to arrest me.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:51.060]  I'm bleeding all over the place.
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:51.921]  I know you've been in a fight.
[02:11:52.241 --> 02:11:53.142]  She goes and watches the tape.
[02:11:53.162 --> 02:11:57.785]  She goes, well, I'm not going to arrest you because they obviously hit you first, but, you know, what are you, in a gang or something?
[02:11:57.805 --> 02:11:59.507]  I'm like, oh yeah, I'm in a gang, lady.
[02:12:00.067 --> 02:12:02.148]  And I was like 23 years old at the time, 24 years old at the time.
[02:12:02.168 --> 02:12:02.849]  I forget, it was like 1997.
[02:12:02.889 --> 02:12:03.109]  I'm only 31.
[02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.269]  And, uh,
[02:12:09.727 --> 02:12:11.568]  It's an interesting story, I've never really told the whole story.
[02:12:11.588 --> 02:12:13.490]  And so I go, fine, arrest me!
[02:12:14.090 --> 02:12:16.652]  I go, this is unbelievable, because I was really, you know, fired up at the time.
[02:12:18.573 --> 02:12:30.201]  And after that happened, I had one night I challenged the FBI, I said, you're a bunch of terrorists, you bombed the World Trade Center, you bombed Oklahoma City, you killed the people at Waco, you're criminals if you don't come down here.
[02:12:31.082 --> 02:12:32.603]  Come on, you come down here and prove you're not.
[02:12:32.883 --> 02:12:33.584]  You're all criminals.
[02:12:33.604 --> 02:12:35.685]  Well, this big, handsome, 6'4 guy shows up,
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:39.883]  Just give me this dirty look when I walk out in the hallway.
[02:12:39.903 --> 02:12:43.747]  And he goes, you know, the whole FBI isn't bad.
[02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:46.490]  And, you know, I was kind of taking it back.
[02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:50.615]  I should have confronted him, but I was like, after the show, I'm like, okay.
[02:12:51.035 --> 02:12:53.738]  He follows me out in the parking lot and then he just goes, well, bye-bye.
[02:12:53.758 --> 02:12:55.420]  And he drives off.
[02:12:56.942 --> 02:12:57.843]  Then another time,
[02:12:59.221 --> 02:13:09.091]  I'm on there talking about the Special Forces and trying to keep the Delta Force from coming to Austin to do drills and I'm real angry about it and I tell people that they're involved in all this covert stuff and bribing the police chief.
[02:13:09.171 --> 02:13:10.032]  This is in 99.
[02:13:11.853 --> 02:13:21.363]  And I walk outside and there's this handsome, you know, high and tight guy with a high and tight haircut, you know, real smart, sitting there and, you know, all the Special Forces aren't that bad, Alex.
[02:13:22.003 --> 02:13:22.843]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:13:22.923 --> 02:13:25.804]  And he's got this big government LTD over there.
[02:13:25.824 --> 02:13:27.685]  He couldn't be any more than my age.
[02:13:27.705 --> 02:13:29.045]  He's probably about 26 or 27.
[02:13:30.946 --> 02:13:34.087]  And he starts going into this whole thing about how things could go bad for me.
[02:13:34.127 --> 02:13:38.048]  And then about a week later, two other guys show up and do that.
[02:13:38.068 --> 02:13:38.448]  And I just go,
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:41.421]  The government doesn't care about you.
[02:13:41.441 --> 02:13:42.782]  They're using DU on you.
[02:13:43.802 --> 02:13:49.766]  You're working for criminals, and you know you are, and I know they tell you you do all this to be tougher than the criminals and to defeat the criminals.
[02:13:49.806 --> 02:13:50.747]  You've got to be criminal.
[02:13:51.007 --> 02:13:53.769]  You know, the whole moral of the story they give you with shows like 24.
[02:13:54.309 --> 02:13:57.191]  And I said, if you want to be deceived, fine, go ahead.
[02:13:57.231 --> 02:13:57.631]  I go, I can't
[02:13:57.671 --> 02:14:06.354]  I can't tell you how many old men I know and how many middle-aged businessmen I know that did the same stuff you did and cry about it every day and go to church asking God to forgive them.
[02:14:06.594 --> 02:14:08.894]  I go, you're going to wake up someday and I can see it in their eyes.
[02:14:08.914 --> 02:14:10.235]  I go, now get out of here!
[02:14:14.596 --> 02:14:16.417]  And, you know, I've had other stuff go on.
[02:14:17.617 --> 02:14:27.340]  But the more I've shown that I'm committed to the end... I remember that one guy, he was like a boxer or something, the main guy they brought to pound on me.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.761]  I was lucky with those four guys that really only on one of them was a fighter.
[02:14:30.781 --> 02:14:32.622]  You could tell he was a big boxer.
[02:14:32.962 --> 02:14:33.863]  That was pretty funny.
[02:14:35.563 --> 02:14:36.604]  It was actually kind of mean.
[02:14:36.684 --> 02:14:38.285]  I really turned loose on him, folks.
[02:14:38.585 --> 02:14:39.565]  Really turned loose on him.
[02:14:40.486 --> 02:14:42.166]  And it's a problem, because I black out.
[02:14:42.346 --> 02:14:43.807]  I mean, I just tear these people up.
[02:14:44.127 --> 02:14:46.568]  And there's those other types out there that do that, too.
[02:14:46.608 --> 02:14:50.230]  And when two people like that get together, you know, people die.
[02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:53.171]  So that's why I'm not into violence, folks.
[02:14:53.211 --> 02:14:53.932]  It's not the way.
[02:14:54.672 --> 02:14:56.913]  But you haul off and punch me, I'm going to punch you back.
[02:14:58.038 --> 02:15:04.522]  And I'm not going to stop until I've torn your nose off and knocked your teeth out and gouged your eyes out and slammed your head open like a melon!
[02:15:08.063 --> 02:15:10.805]  Okay, just thinking about it gets me fired up.
[02:15:12.286 --> 02:15:15.968]  But there's a time to turn the cheek and then there's another time to whip the money changers.
[02:15:16.388 --> 02:15:19.330]  There's a time to live, a time to die, a time to sow, a time to reap.
[02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:21.451]  I ought to read that Bible passage.
[02:15:21.471 --> 02:15:22.651]  I forget where that is in the Bible.
[02:15:22.671 --> 02:15:27.474]  You know, it's to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[02:15:29.289 --> 02:15:30.690]  And you know, that's not true.
[02:15:30.710 --> 02:15:32.210]  That's not the last time I had problems.
[02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:33.651]  Man, I've had a bunch of other problems.
[02:15:33.811 --> 02:15:37.152]  I just really don't... I always just forget about it right after it happens.
[02:15:37.172 --> 02:15:40.193]  I've even got video of it happening one time.
[02:15:40.213 --> 02:15:43.294]  We've aired it on TV and I've got a... I came across that video a few months ago.
[02:15:43.314 --> 02:15:44.475]  I meant to put that back on the web.
[02:15:44.535 --> 02:15:45.195]  I'm just so busy.
[02:15:47.016 --> 02:15:49.737]  Uh, was it 2000 or was it... No, it was 1999.
[02:15:49.777 --> 02:15:51.457]  Fortune 500 comes to Austin.
[02:15:52.058 --> 02:15:53.038]  There's going to be a march.
[02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.399]  And I'm out there and there's these giant cops.
[02:15:56.519 --> 02:15:57.720]  Huge arms.
[02:15:59.657 --> 02:16:04.759]  And they're wearing black masks, dressed up like anarchists, and it's so obvious they're trying to start fights and stuff.
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:08.501]  And I run over and I go, we got cops here trying to cause problems!
[02:16:08.541 --> 02:16:09.522]  News cameras, news cameras!
[02:16:09.542 --> 02:16:10.122]  They all run over.
[02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:12.703]  And all of a sudden, 40 cops run across the street.
[02:16:13.023 --> 02:16:13.803]  We were at the Capitol.
[02:16:13.863 --> 02:16:15.824]  APD runs over to the Capitol side.
[02:16:16.325 --> 02:16:18.526]  Got there on 11th and goes, Jones, back off!
[02:16:19.026 --> 02:16:23.708]  And they pull them out, and five minutes later, two more guys get inserted, this time smaller cops.
[02:16:25.532 --> 02:16:29.716]  And I go, okay, the cops are coming, and all of a sudden they nod to one of the leaders of the Anarchists.
[02:16:29.756 --> 02:16:34.039]  This little redhead, bearded guy walks over and he goes, I'm gonna tear you!
[02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:37.502]  And I go, oh, you work for the guys up on top of the building.
[02:16:37.682 --> 02:16:41.325]  There was FBI up there, you know, with their cameras and stuff.
[02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:44.508]  I go, oh, you're Black Block Anarchists, you work for them.
[02:16:44.548 --> 02:16:48.992]  He goes, that's right, we do, and we're gonna be taken over soon and you're gonna be dead!
[02:16:50.666 --> 02:16:53.547]  And I see the cop standing over beside him, smiling.
[02:16:53.807 --> 02:16:56.068]  My God, how do they get these people so twisted?
[02:16:56.728 --> 02:16:58.129]  So openly evil!
[02:16:58.749 --> 02:17:13.054]  So I'm stuck between the FBI up on the thing, the little anarchist trying to radicalize everything, who's a fed, obviously, and APD prancing around in anarchist outfits trying to rile people up, so they can come over there and break the heads of a thousand peaceful people.
[02:17:15.434 --> 02:17:17.255]  And I got some of that exchange on video.
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:23.541]  And then there was the election fraud rally.
[02:17:23.701 --> 02:17:24.721]  Oh man, that was bad.
[02:17:24.901 --> 02:17:26.201]  Right after the election last year.
[02:17:27.322 --> 02:17:28.662]  I'll tell you about that when we get back.
[02:17:29.742 --> 02:17:32.243]  And man, these guys were really scary.
[02:17:32.523 --> 02:17:36.504]  I mean, this black guy that came up to me, man, he was a killer.
[02:17:37.324 --> 02:17:38.024]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.247 --> 02:17:48.689]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:55.095]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:17:55.115 --> 02:17:55.896]  Supreme Court.
[02:17:56.656 --> 02:18:00.980]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.643]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:18:05.604 --> 02:18:10.829]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[02:18:55.563 --> 02:19:06.786]  Black quirky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:07.126 --> 02:19:12.847]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:19:13.107 --> 02:19:19.750]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:19.970 --> 02:19:26.793]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:19:53.194 --> 02:19:56.498]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:59.111 --> 02:20:00.172]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:20:00.252 --> 02:20:00.552]  A 5% increase.
[02:20:00.572 --> 02:20:02.994]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:20:03.014 --> 02:20:05.176]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:20:14.426 --> 02:20:16.767]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:20:16.787 --> 02:20:20.049]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:23.691]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:20:50.122 --> 02:20:58.430]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:00.272]  More than likely, this includes you.

[02:21:53.770 --> 02:21:56.691]  In fact, I have a witness to what I'm about to tell you.
[02:21:57.612 --> 02:21:59.332]  Kevin Booth, who does great camera work.
[02:21:59.372 --> 02:22:01.393]  I used him for Marshall Law.
[02:22:02.214 --> 02:22:04.275]  Old friend of mine that does a lot of comedy stuff.
[02:22:05.055 --> 02:22:11.218]  I wanted a cameraman for this rally about election fraud and the voting machines.
[02:22:12.579 --> 02:22:15.480]  So he just came down, he just taped my speech and a few others, and we're leaving.
[02:22:15.701 --> 02:22:16.481]  I've given him a ride.
[02:22:17.372 --> 02:22:22.515]  And this big ol' white guy comes walking up, and they were all wearing, you know, blue sweatshirts.
[02:22:22.535 --> 02:22:23.475]  That was like their identifier.
[02:22:23.495 --> 02:22:24.576]  There were a bunch of them in the crowd.
[02:22:25.396 --> 02:22:27.137]  He goes, you know, Alex, we need to do something violent.
[02:22:27.157 --> 02:22:29.799]  It's time to start, you know, shooting people.
[02:22:29.819 --> 02:22:30.899]  And I said, oh, man.
[02:22:30.959 --> 02:22:32.020]  And Kevin's like, let's get out of here.
[02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:33.721]  That guy's a cop.
[02:22:33.741 --> 02:22:34.421]  And I go, yeah.
[02:22:34.441 --> 02:22:35.242]  And the guy would look me in the eye.
[02:22:35.262 --> 02:22:36.563]  I was like, man, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:22:36.983 --> 02:22:37.603]  I'm peaceful.
[02:22:38.263 --> 02:22:39.044]  So I'm trying to get away.
[02:22:39.064 --> 02:22:40.725]  And then a black guy walks over wearing blue.
[02:22:41.625 --> 02:22:44.607]  And man, he just looked really evil, folks.
[02:22:45.313 --> 02:22:48.614]  You know, he had kind of like the green skin, like he was real unhealthy.
[02:22:48.634 --> 02:22:50.454]  He was tall though, muscular.
[02:22:50.474 --> 02:22:52.235]  He was just looking at it with pure hatred.
[02:22:52.255 --> 02:22:54.595]  And he's like, yeah, Alex, I really like what you do.
[02:22:54.635 --> 02:22:55.515]  I really appreciate it.
[02:22:55.535 --> 02:22:56.256]  We need to do something.
[02:22:56.796 --> 02:22:57.736]  We need to do something violent.
[02:22:57.756 --> 02:22:59.116]  And I said, this is like the same script.
[02:22:59.136 --> 02:23:00.977]  And I said, man, I'm against violence.
[02:23:00.997 --> 02:23:02.117]  You know, what are you, a cop or something?
[02:23:02.137 --> 02:23:02.877]  I go, I'm out of here.
[02:23:03.177 --> 02:23:05.418]  And I turn around and Kevin heard this.
[02:23:05.778 --> 02:23:06.538]  Me and Kevin are walking.
[02:23:06.558 --> 02:23:09.178]  He goes, when we get, he cussed, I can't say it.
[02:23:09.198 --> 02:23:11.299]  He goes, when we get you in prison, we're going to rape you in the,
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.562]  And I just turned around and I went, what did you say?
[02:23:14.582 --> 02:23:18.025]  And he goes, nothing, and turned and walked away laughing.
[02:23:18.586 --> 02:23:20.568]  And you know, I've had a few of them call in on shows.
[02:23:20.608 --> 02:23:21.368]  I was on in England.
[02:23:21.388 --> 02:23:22.309]  It's the same mentality.
[02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:28.015]  And this guy called in on TalkSport, one of their biggest stations, and he just said, yeah, we're going to get you in jail and rape you.
[02:23:28.675 --> 02:23:30.117]  That's the mentality of these people.
[02:23:30.837 --> 02:23:31.938]  And he ended up just telling me that.
[02:23:31.978 --> 02:23:34.681]  I just turned back and I'm like, man, what is wrong with you?
[02:23:37.751 --> 02:23:39.732]  So that's who they got working for them, folks.
[02:23:40.392 --> 02:23:50.696]  They get these cops, they pick the ones that'll deal drugs, you know, they start them slow on corruption, well, we gotta deal these drugs to get in with the drug dealers, and you don't mind making ten grand extra a month, do you?
[02:23:51.097 --> 02:23:54.138]  Hey, I just shut down this drug dealer for this gold watch, you want it?
[02:23:55.238 --> 02:23:59.360]  I've had detectives on from New York, I'll tell you how they get you into it.
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:03.502]  Famous detectives who've blown the whistle from LA, New York, you name it, it's the same system.
[02:24:04.062 --> 02:24:06.663]  And they get them into corruption, they get them in, and then pretty soon,
[02:24:07.887 --> 02:24:14.469]  They get stuff on them, they get on drugs, they get on steroids, and they just get evil.
[02:24:14.729 --> 02:24:16.390]  Or they're flat out evil when they join.
[02:24:17.671 --> 02:24:18.991]  But I mean, that didn't scare me.
[02:24:19.051 --> 02:24:20.472]  I thought, man, I'm going to really work harder.
[02:24:21.312 --> 02:24:24.453]  So, when and if they do kill me, when God's done with me,
[02:24:26.027 --> 02:24:27.348]  Which, I could care less.
[02:24:27.368 --> 02:24:32.809]  I mean, I want to live a long time, but if the globals kill me tomorrow or in 20 years or never, it's God's will.
[02:24:32.849 --> 02:24:33.990]  I mean, I'm in God's hands.
[02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:36.931]  I commit myself into God's hands and will.
[02:24:37.391 --> 02:24:40.652]  I mean, I'm already in God's hands and will, but I surrender to it.
[02:24:41.552 --> 02:24:42.472]  I've already won.
[02:24:42.493 --> 02:24:47.114]  And I mean, you know, it manifests.
[02:24:47.134 --> 02:24:48.334]  They manifest who they are.
[02:24:48.354 --> 02:24:50.215]  I mean, they want to rape me in prison?
[02:24:50.275 --> 02:24:52.476]  I mean, there it is.
[02:24:52.536 --> 02:24:53.296]  I have to fight them.
[02:24:54.335 --> 02:24:58.957]  You think I want my children growing up, or your children, or anybody's children, in a country with people like this running it?
[02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:01.698]  We're gonna rape you in prison?
[02:25:02.038 --> 02:25:04.279]  We can't wait to get you in prison and we're gonna rape you?
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:07.701]  You know, there is a hell!
[02:25:09.222 --> 02:25:13.423]  And, uh, believe me, uh, you... You don't have to wait till you die, though.
[02:25:13.463 --> 02:25:14.684]  You're creating hell here.
[02:25:15.364 --> 02:25:17.805]  I wouldn't want that coming back on me, man.
[02:25:17.985 --> 02:25:19.486]  You reap what you sow!
[02:25:19.786 --> 02:25:22.387]  You guys out there that are evil wonder why you're so unhappy?
[02:25:22.687 --> 02:25:23.548]  Why life is a hell?
[02:25:24.739 --> 02:25:27.541]  And you think burrowing deeper into darkness is going to make you happy?
[02:25:27.601 --> 02:25:28.062]  It's not!
[02:25:28.902 --> 02:25:31.865]  And it's still time to turn back unless you've totally given yourself over.
[02:25:33.426 --> 02:25:36.989]  Unless the Holy Spirit has come to you and you've refused it time and time again.
[02:25:37.009 --> 02:25:45.716]  And I'll tell you, our power is greater than the devil's, the king of this world, the god of this world.
[02:25:46.076 --> 02:25:47.978]  God is so much more powerful.
[02:25:48.538 --> 02:25:50.320]  And if we're willing to lay our lives down
[02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:55.783]  For what's good and decent, God will empower us and God will protect us.
[02:25:56.743 --> 02:26:04.426]  In almost every case, unless it is His will that we be sacrificed as a way to encourage others.
[02:26:06.667 --> 02:26:12.169]  And so, I used the analogy with the caller 15-20 minutes ago when he said, why aren't you dead yet?
[02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:14.110]  So I told you a few stories.
[02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:16.151]  Stories I've never told before, some of them.
[02:26:17.863 --> 02:26:19.084]  In more detail than I ever have.
[02:26:19.104 --> 02:26:20.044]  You know, I told you.
[02:26:20.484 --> 02:26:21.725]  You didn't get the analogy.
[02:26:22.765 --> 02:26:24.246]  I said, you know, wherever you live.
[02:26:24.266 --> 02:26:25.346]  Where did that caller live?
[02:26:25.366 --> 02:26:26.026]  In Massachusetts.
[02:26:27.027 --> 02:26:31.068]  You drive down the road and you see fatality accidents, don't you?
[02:26:31.108 --> 02:26:32.109]  You drive 70 miles an hour.
[02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:33.429]  You see them all the time, don't you?
[02:26:33.449 --> 02:26:34.570]  I probably see them every few months.
[02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:39.212]  I've seen blood all over the road and a bloody blanket over somebody's face.
[02:26:40.052 --> 02:26:41.172]  I just saw that a few months ago.
[02:26:41.553 --> 02:26:44.774]  But I still get in my car, get on the road, go out there and drive.
[02:26:46.005 --> 02:26:50.586]  I still put my children in the car and I still take them out there knowing the danger because I want to drive.
[02:26:53.507 --> 02:26:55.948]  Sometimes I think I shouldn't, even though I try to drive as best I can.
[02:26:58.369 --> 02:27:00.530]  But see, it isn't scary, it isn't predatory.
[02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:08.332]  The thought of an animal or a human coming to get you meanly and having you in its thrall is so scary!
[02:27:08.912 --> 02:27:10.373]  Well, it's not scary to me!
[02:27:10.633 --> 02:27:12.173]  I've been there plenty of times!

[02:27:17.097 --> 02:27:18.218]  It doesn't scare me.

[02:29:46.144 --> 02:29:51.647]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:51.807 --> 02:29:52.867]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:52.987 --> 02:29:53.868]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:53.968 --> 02:29:56.809]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:57.009 --> 02:30:01.891]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:30:02.131 --> 02:30:03.232]  Check out this new product.
[02:30:03.372 --> 02:30:04.492]  It's called No B.O.
[02:30:04.572 --> 02:30:06.253]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:30:06.633 --> 02:30:08.714]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.

[02:30:21.601 --> 02:30:26.983]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.

[02:30:51.214 --> 02:30:58.617]  Alright, in closing on this subject, I'll go to your calls and cover some final important news during the last 26 minutes we've got left.
[02:31:01.969 --> 02:31:06.472]  I mean, to really boil it down, Jennifer Flowers said it best on Hardball.
[02:31:07.293 --> 02:31:11.616]  She said Bill Clinton's had over a hundred people killed, and Chris Matthews said, well, are you still alive?
[02:31:11.776 --> 02:31:14.338]  And she said, because I've written this book, I'm gone public.
[02:31:16.479 --> 02:31:28.008]  I mean, the reports, the interviews with people who'd be across the hall, and they decide to videotape the governor going in, you know, to see his gilly, and then the police come over, the state police, and break his arms and legs.
[02:31:28.048 --> 02:31:29.128]  I mean, it's all admitted.
[02:31:29.168 --> 02:31:31.390]  I mean, the people they killed, all of it,
[02:31:33.860 --> 02:31:37.162]  And, uh, state police even went public about all that.
[02:31:37.723 --> 02:31:38.603]  Still, he didn't get in trouble.
[02:31:39.404 --> 02:31:43.326]  But that's why she's safe, because if they kill her, then it'll just spread the word.
[02:31:44.747 --> 02:31:50.891]  And so I've made my films, I've written my books, I've done my work, and there's so many other people doing it.
[02:31:50.931 --> 02:31:52.112]  I mean, people are waking up everywhere.
[02:31:52.472 --> 02:31:56.355]  Now they come out and go, the Bilderberg Group is real, and it wants world government, but it's for your best interest.
[02:31:56.855 --> 02:31:59.217]  The new tactic is just to flaunt it in your face.
[02:32:00.936 --> 02:32:02.898]  Now, will they just get sick of me and kill me?
[02:32:03.119 --> 02:32:04.000]  I mean, that could happen.
[02:32:05.882 --> 02:32:11.067]  But, they like to do a night of the long night.
[02:32:11.988 --> 02:32:12.749]  A crystal night.
[02:32:12.789 --> 02:32:14.851]  They like to have a sweep.
[02:32:16.693 --> 02:32:17.815]  That's what governments tend to do.
[02:32:17.855 --> 02:32:20.798]  And how this would work, if they're able to do it, is they'll nuke a city.
[02:32:22.219 --> 02:32:33.442]  Then they'll have months of bedlam and freaking out, and then they'll set up a police state, and then just people will be arrested and not be let out, and people will complain, and then they'll be arrested, and then... But they won't get away with that.
[02:32:33.482 --> 02:32:50.986]  I mean, at that point, there'll be such massive demonstrations of people resisting, and then the whole thing is meant to break down, and then Europe will come in as the savior, and... So quite frankly, uh... Quite frankly, uh... It's all just a giant quagmire.
[02:32:52.293 --> 02:32:57.296]  But they also will look for people, they want you to have that fatalistic mentality, then get all paranoid.
[02:32:57.356 --> 02:32:58.756]  No, I'm not paranoid!
[02:32:59.477 --> 02:33:01.698]  I mean, I realize what's dangerous in my life.
[02:33:02.478 --> 02:33:10.523]  And what is dangerous in my life is swimming around underneath a boat if I'm out on the lake, and, uh, you know, hitting my head or something.
[02:33:11.083 --> 02:33:12.064]  Or being hit by a boat.
[02:33:12.544 --> 02:33:18.327]  What's dangerous is, uh, when I'm climbing around up on some cliffs when I'm out for a hike.
[02:33:18.945 --> 02:33:24.006]  What's dangerous is getting in a car, or getting in a helicopter, or getting on an airplane.
[02:33:25.067 --> 02:33:29.808]  Those are the most dangerous things you can do in your life that is not death by natural causes.
[02:33:31.228 --> 02:33:39.571]  But, again, your instincts are afraid of the big teeth, the big yellow eyes, the big cave cat, or bear coming and grabbing you.
[02:33:42.251 --> 02:33:43.732]  Well, that's why you're afraid of the dark.
[02:33:44.412 --> 02:33:48.133]  And so the elite garbs themselves in black, acts predatory,
[02:33:49.033 --> 02:33:54.036]  They try to project that intimidation on you, so you're so afraid!
[02:33:54.897 --> 02:33:55.777]  You're gonna die!
[02:33:55.797 --> 02:33:56.538]  Do you understand that?
[02:33:56.578 --> 02:33:58.799]  You're going... your heart's gonna stop beating.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:01.641]  You'll be lucky, blessed if you die in your sleep.
[02:34:02.202 --> 02:34:04.043]  A lot of you are gonna die excruciating deaths.
[02:34:04.563 --> 02:34:05.864]  None of us get out of this alive.
[02:34:05.924 --> 02:34:06.885]  This is a test.
[02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:10.967]  And you might as well just stop fearing death, because when you stop fearing it, you're alive.
[02:34:16.791 --> 02:34:18.472]  You've got to accept it.
[02:34:19.625 --> 02:34:21.168]  You've got to deal with it.
[02:34:22.471 --> 02:34:28.483]  When you do that to drive your car every day, you get in that car, though it is the thing that will probably kill you.
[02:34:30.211 --> 02:34:34.995]  These cops sit there and they're so afraid when they're walking up to a car that you've got a gun and you're going to get them.
[02:34:35.055 --> 02:34:36.196]  They've been taught to be afraid.
[02:34:36.556 --> 02:34:44.943]  But they'll be hanging their rear ends out on I-35 or Mopac writing a ticket for a stupid government that prints the money to begin with and doesn't even need those taxes.
[02:34:44.963 --> 02:34:46.324]  They don't even need that system.
[02:34:46.724 --> 02:34:50.788]  Hanging their rear end out on the road with big old cars and vans.
[02:34:51.188 --> 02:34:52.729]  I always get over the other lane and try to go around them.
[02:34:52.969 --> 02:34:58.654]  Just hanging their rear end out or jumping out in front of you when they're going up to somebody and they're going to give a ticket and almost getting hit.
[02:35:00.106 --> 02:35:01.947]  They'll just, again, they're not conscious.
[02:35:02.727 --> 02:35:05.548]  Number one cause of death of cops, automobile accidents, being hit.
[02:35:05.568 --> 02:35:08.149]  They're not afraid of that.
[02:35:08.709 --> 02:35:11.090]  They're afraid of you, the evil citizen.
[02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:14.791]  And are they afraid of the Mexican troops that are killing cops all over the place?
[02:35:14.931 --> 02:35:16.231]  No, they don't tell them about it.
[02:35:16.512 --> 02:35:19.353]  So when a cop gets killed, it's kept kind of quiet, doesn't make big news?
[02:35:20.953 --> 02:35:21.393]  See?
[02:35:21.413 --> 02:35:23.114]  So there's not that perception.
[02:35:23.854 --> 02:35:25.094]  That perception.
[02:35:25.775 --> 02:35:27.195]  It's all perception.
[02:35:28.656 --> 02:35:29.476]  It's an illusion.
[02:35:31.846 --> 02:35:36.548]  The troops in Iraq aren't afraid of the plutonium, which is the silent killer they're all inhaling.
[02:35:37.808 --> 02:35:42.250]  The thing that's going to eat through their DNA and give them horribly deformed children.
[02:35:43.230 --> 02:35:45.771]  And lives of pain they're giving their offspring.
[02:35:46.132 --> 02:35:47.512]  They're destroying their future.
[02:35:48.593 --> 02:35:50.713]  The most beautiful thing God's ever given us!
[02:35:50.733 --> 02:35:54.715]  So they're afraid of Iraqi insurgents!
[02:35:59.207 --> 02:36:07.890]  When there's still about, what, 40% of the deaths in Iraq are being run over by our own troops, or helicopters crashing, or flesh-eating bacteria is killing a bunch of the troops?
[02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:13.972]  Because the Pentagon doesn't tell them to worry about DEU or experimental vaccines.
[02:36:14.032 --> 02:36:14.632]  No, no, no.
[02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:17.033]  It's all perception.
[02:36:18.914 --> 02:36:22.175]  They say perception is reality, and it only is in a delusion.
[02:36:22.702 --> 02:36:23.802]  In a delusional reality.
[02:36:24.102 --> 02:36:26.583]  Perception is not reality in the real world, folks.
[02:36:26.923 --> 02:36:32.745]  That saying of Edward Bernays is a fraud, the father of modern advertising and propaganda.
[02:36:36.086 --> 02:36:36.806]  It's a lie!
[02:36:38.367 --> 02:36:46.009]  And the truth is, when you give in to bullies and you live a life on your knees and a life of denial and a life of weakness, you are in grave danger!
[02:36:46.775 --> 02:36:59.558]  When you live a life of diving into life, gobbling up life, loving life, honoring life, enjoying life, not being a coward, being a man, being a woman, you are so alive, it is incredible!
[02:37:01.638 --> 02:37:05.539]  People talk about that hole in their soul, you know, that God-shaped void, and it's there.
[02:37:06.679 --> 02:37:09.760]  And then people say, well, I've got God, but I still feel empty.
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:11.060]  No, you don't really have God.
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.281]  If you had God in your heart, and you were doing what God had planned for you, you wouldn't be
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:18.061]  Feeling the way you feel.
[02:37:18.221 --> 02:37:19.421]  I have too much energy.
[02:37:19.882 --> 02:37:21.122]  I have too much I want to do.
[02:37:22.183 --> 02:37:23.444]  I am totally controlled.
[02:37:24.865 --> 02:37:26.045]  And I'm not the best vessel.
[02:37:26.786 --> 02:37:27.846]  I have lots of problems.
[02:37:28.827 --> 02:37:30.388]  But God works through all of us.
[02:37:31.048 --> 02:37:33.710]  And you just have to surrender yourselves to God.
[02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:36.271]  And you will be empowered.
[02:37:36.291 --> 02:37:37.812]  You will be a new creature.
[02:37:38.252 --> 02:37:42.715]  He will take all of your faults and He will make them pluses.
[02:37:45.083 --> 02:37:46.404]  I mean, why should I be afraid?
[02:37:46.584 --> 02:37:51.647]  People will be so afraid of some black cop saying, we can't wait to get you in prison and rape you.
[02:37:52.968 --> 02:37:53.929]  That didn't scare me.
[02:37:53.949 --> 02:37:55.830]  It really made me sad for him.
[02:37:55.850 --> 02:37:57.291]  I looked at him for what he was.
[02:37:57.311 --> 02:37:58.231]  He was like a little demon.
[02:38:01.013 --> 02:38:04.595]  But I did feel like I needed to redouble my efforts.
[02:38:04.615 --> 02:38:08.058]  He didn't know that he had actually empowered me.
[02:38:09.739 --> 02:38:11.780]  He didn't know that he had recommitted me.
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:17.364]  Anytime you wonder if this new world order is real or is it really that bad, believe me folks, it's worse.
[02:38:17.984 --> 02:38:19.685]  It's worse than you can imagine.
[02:38:20.966 --> 02:38:26.790]  It is a bottomless void of pain and suffering and cancer upon the life force.
[02:38:27.551 --> 02:38:29.392]  It is an abomination.
[02:38:31.814 --> 02:38:35.617]  It is here to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:38:36.017 --> 02:38:38.299]  And it destroys its minions with relish.
[02:38:40.257 --> 02:38:44.838]  More relish than it destroys God's people.
[02:38:48.359 --> 02:38:49.659]  Many people are afraid.
[02:38:49.879 --> 02:38:52.560]  Fear is what leads people, number one, into the New World Order.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:55.441]  They're afraid of it, so they decide to embrace it.
[02:38:56.241 --> 02:39:06.143]  I see so many young people wearing satanic pentagrams and shirts, and baphomet outfits, and it's the big bad, and you look at them and they're so pathetically weak.
[02:39:06.443 --> 02:39:08.344]  They're so afraid of evil.
[02:39:09.204 --> 02:39:12.586]  So they think by embracing it, that it gives them power over it.
[02:39:12.646 --> 02:39:14.467]  And believe me, it doesn't.
[02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:21.110]  You've got to tell evil to get behind you.
[02:39:21.730 --> 02:39:23.051]  To get out of your road.
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:27.062]  They're the ones that are afraid.
[02:39:27.142 --> 02:39:28.844]  They're the ones that put up all the cameras.
[02:39:29.164 --> 02:39:30.946]  They're the ones that have to wear the body armor.
[02:39:31.246 --> 02:39:33.368]  They're the ones that creep around in darkness.
[02:39:33.649 --> 02:39:35.250]  They're the ones that cover their faces.
[02:39:35.571 --> 02:39:38.153]  They're the ones that hide behind national security.
[02:39:38.374 --> 02:39:39.935]  They're the ones that weave their webs.
[02:39:40.196 --> 02:39:41.617]  We are in the light!
[02:39:41.977 --> 02:39:42.858]  Out in the open!
[02:39:43.119 --> 02:39:44.160]  Standing forth!
[02:39:47.975 --> 02:39:59.181]  And when they strike us down, when they tear us down, when they grab on us like the, like the, like the diseased hyenas they are, that is their defeat.
[02:40:00.762 --> 02:40:05.464]  The globalists know they pull down more patriot leaders, it only spreads the rebellion.
[02:40:06.485 --> 02:40:08.266]  They already know you're getting past your fear.
[02:40:09.146 --> 02:40:14.909]  They already know that God's Spirit is moving across this land, always in the darkest times it does.
[02:40:15.589 --> 02:40:16.330]  They already know.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:17.900]  The third time is short.
[02:40:19.101 --> 02:40:20.121]  They're afraid!
[02:40:20.781 --> 02:40:22.422]  All of this is about keeping control.
[02:40:22.762 --> 02:40:23.582]  Keeping control!
[02:40:23.642 --> 02:40:24.542]  Keeping their power!
[02:40:24.783 --> 02:40:25.863]  Expanding their power!
[02:40:26.063 --> 02:40:28.124]  And that's why they're going to lose their power!
[02:40:31.925 --> 02:40:34.986]  So to everybody out there listening, I don't hate you if you're evil.
[02:40:35.806 --> 02:40:38.667]  I hate the things you do, and I hate the one that controls you.
[02:40:39.567 --> 02:40:41.428]  But I do what I do because I love.
[02:40:41.448 --> 02:40:44.789]  I love the beautiful
[02:40:45.615 --> 02:40:48.577]  Sunset yesterday, because of that volcano that blew up in Mexico.
[02:40:48.597 --> 02:40:49.938]  It was a beautiful sunset.
[02:40:50.298 --> 02:40:51.118]  Spectacular.
[02:40:51.759 --> 02:40:54.100]  I love seeing the moon come up last night.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.281]  I love my family.
[02:40:56.401 --> 02:40:58.423]  I love my children more than anything in the world.
[02:40:58.743 --> 02:41:05.787]  And I love them so much that I will never compromise, and I will never give in to the New World Order, and I will never sell them out.
[02:41:07.074 --> 02:41:10.598]  And I'll never sell out their children, and their children, and their children.
[02:41:10.778 --> 02:41:15.483]  I love... If you could see your great-great-great-great-grandson or daughter, wouldn't you love them as much as your own children?
[02:41:16.143 --> 02:41:19.106]  I see grandparents even love their grandchildren more than they love their own children.
[02:41:19.407 --> 02:41:20.708]  There's something about seeing that.
[02:41:20.768 --> 02:41:23.411]  That's another form of immortality God gives us.
[02:41:26.594 --> 02:41:29.237]  And when you think about the world our children are going to live in,
[02:41:30.794 --> 02:41:38.079]  Devoid of creativity, devoid of individuality, devoid of beauty and love, because the elites threatened by that and threatened by the family.
[02:41:38.459 --> 02:41:43.082]  How could you not instantly lay your life down for humanity?
[02:41:43.142 --> 02:41:51.347]  You know, everything we've got, everything good and wholesome, is because other people were willing to die, other people were willing to sacrifice, because they knew that's what it was all about.
[02:41:52.085 --> 02:41:59.210]  Because life was so short back then, living an average of 40-something years, and people saw so much death, that they understood it was all transitory.
[02:41:59.390 --> 02:42:01.232]  They weren't mind-controlled by the New World Order.
[02:42:01.392 --> 02:42:02.793]  They understood they were part of something bigger.
[02:42:02.913 --> 02:42:05.635]  They were part of the species, the race consciousness.
[02:42:06.596 --> 02:42:16.143]  By the race consciousness, I mean the race consciousness of the species to go on, and to do greater things, and to build things, and to be better, and stronger.
[02:42:19.025 --> 02:42:20.266]  I stand on the shoulders
[02:42:21.485 --> 02:42:26.447]  I stand on the ashes, I stand on the blood, the sweat, the tears, all those that came before me!
[02:42:29.808 --> 02:42:31.348]  On top of everything that's good!
[02:42:31.368 --> 02:42:37.971]  For our father's sake, for their father's sake, and their father's.
[02:42:41.072 --> 02:42:44.213]  For the face of our fathers, that's what your family name means.
[02:42:45.253 --> 02:42:47.574]  For everything that's good, your life is so short!
[02:42:47.834 --> 02:42:48.474]  It's true!
[02:42:49.115 --> 02:42:50.315]  You've got to stand up!
[02:42:51.010 --> 02:42:53.071]  You've got to lay it all on the line!
[02:42:53.792 --> 02:42:55.293]  That's what life's all about!
[02:42:56.274 --> 02:43:00.196]  It's not about... They control so many of our young people through these fads.
[02:43:00.236 --> 02:43:01.857]  They've got to have the $200 tennis shoes.
[02:43:01.897 --> 02:43:03.258]  They've got to dress like whores.
[02:43:03.298 --> 02:43:05.180]  They've got to do all this cool stuff.
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:09.703]  They've got to have their pants hanging down around their ankles because it's what the government told them was cool.
[02:43:11.384 --> 02:43:12.805]  And they feel so inadequate.
[02:43:12.825 --> 02:43:14.426]  Our young women feel so inadequate.
[02:43:15.126 --> 02:43:17.328]  They've had stolen from them their purity.
[02:43:18.502 --> 02:43:22.567]  They've had stolen from them their grace and their value and their importance.
[02:43:23.508 --> 02:43:25.950]  Our young men have been turned into gibbering animals.
[02:43:27.512 --> 02:43:38.905]  And out of that vat of weakness, the enemy is forging its tools of siege against the rest of us, against the remnant, against the growing remnant.
[02:43:43.308 --> 02:43:44.369]  But they will fail!
[02:43:44.849 --> 02:43:46.931]  They will not twist all of our souls and our minds.
[02:43:47.211 --> 02:43:49.413]  All their TV shows were torture and evil is good.
[02:43:49.593 --> 02:43:51.855]  Where you gotta be more evil than the evil to defeat evil.
[02:43:52.155 --> 02:43:58.100]  That's the argument that was used to twist our men and the CIA and the FBI.
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:01.883]  And then once they'd committed the acts over and over again, they were totally given over to evil.
[02:44:03.545 --> 02:44:07.508]  They had gotten the taste of blood in their mouths like a bull mastiff.
[02:44:08.729 --> 02:44:09.670]  And they enjoyed it.
[02:44:14.693 --> 02:44:20.795]  So I ask all of our police and military and everyone else listening out there to check out what I've claimed, the things I've said.
[02:44:21.256 --> 02:44:22.116]  Find out it's true!
[02:44:22.216 --> 02:44:22.696]  Find out!
[02:44:22.716 --> 02:44:26.097]  I mean, I have the article right here where clearly the U.S.
[02:44:26.137 --> 02:44:30.699]  government trained these Mexican troops to go around killing people that didn't pay their cut into the U.S.
[02:44:30.739 --> 02:44:31.099]  government.
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:38.762]  And the intelligence bulletin obtained says the Zetas are responsible for hundreds of violent drug-related murders.
[02:44:38.782 --> 02:44:42.984]  It says they executed journalists, murdered people in Dallas, McAllen, and Laredo, Texas.
[02:44:44.165 --> 02:44:50.908]  Uh, they have, uh, they've detained two DEA agents and recently they've shot at Border Patrol agents.
[02:44:50.928 --> 02:44:53.029]  They talk about how it killed a bunch of them.
[02:44:53.289 --> 02:44:57.251]  This is a whitewash out of KI5 News.
[02:44:57.892 --> 02:44:59.272]  I got the Dallas Morning News about it.
[02:44:59.332 --> 02:45:04.255]  I mean, just, why didn't your bosses tell you there's Mexican Special Forces troops running around?
[02:45:04.295 --> 02:45:04.615]  It says
[02:45:07.329 --> 02:45:16.423]  Customs agents were involved in a shootout south of Phoenix with an enemy they had not seen before, equipped with automatic weapons, body armor, and state-of-the-art communications and a word, it looked military.
[02:45:17.825 --> 02:45:18.827]  Kyle Barnett says...
[02:45:20.743 --> 02:45:22.683]  I'd be lying if it didn't concern us.
[02:45:22.783 --> 02:45:39.167]  Now, as the drug war between the Gulf Cartel and the East and the Tijuana Cartel in the West starts to heat up, the Justice Department bulletin warns the violence will spill over to the Mexican border in the United States and law enforcement agencies in Texas, Arizona, and Southern California are expected to encounter Las Zetas in the coming months.
[02:45:39.727 --> 02:45:41.747]  Folks, I've talked to the Border Patrol.
[02:45:41.867 --> 02:45:42.507]  I've talked to them.
[02:45:42.607 --> 02:45:44.048]  It isn't Zetas.
[02:45:44.128 --> 02:45:45.628]  It's Mexican troops doing it.
[02:45:46.491 --> 02:45:51.374]  And it says at the start of the article, they were elite special forces of the Mexican military trained at U.S.
[02:45:51.774 --> 02:45:53.775]  and the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[02:45:54.235 --> 02:45:57.497]  And set out to wipe out one of the most powerful Mexican drug cartels.
[02:45:57.937 --> 02:45:58.658]  But they didn't.
[02:45:58.718 --> 02:46:00.699]  They deserted and joined the cartel.
[02:46:01.119 --> 02:46:02.020]  Boulderdash!
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:04.841]  It's just like Al-Qaeda and everything else.
[02:46:05.742 --> 02:46:07.823]  The Iraqis that bombed us at Oklahoma City.
[02:46:08.403 --> 02:46:09.304]  We know their name.
[02:46:09.324 --> 02:46:12.025]  They're a Republican Guard trained in the U.S., brought back.
[02:46:12.305 --> 02:46:13.506]  They still are on the payroll.
[02:46:14.952 --> 02:46:17.013]  Plausible deniability if they get caught!
[02:46:19.134 --> 02:46:20.034]  Heaven help us!
[02:46:21.875 --> 02:46:25.537]  I've been to the drills where the foreign troops are trying to take our guns, folks.
[02:46:26.417 --> 02:46:31.579]  And now they got foreign troop hit men, and 25% of the Iraq force is illegal aliens.
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:35.041]  You starting to figure this out?
[02:46:36.682 --> 02:46:37.682]  You starting to figure it out?
[02:46:37.722 --> 02:46:40.343]  Well, they may be fighting for the drugs and the money they make.
[02:46:40.383 --> 02:46:41.564]  We're fighting for our families.
[02:46:42.304 --> 02:46:44.405]  And when push comes to shove, I know who's gonna win.
[02:46:46.181 --> 02:46:48.642]  And people won't have to know when it's time to defend themselves.
[02:46:48.682 --> 02:46:49.142]  You'll know.
[02:46:49.162 --> 02:46:52.823]  And I pray it doesn't come to that point.
[02:46:53.603 --> 02:46:55.104]  But I'll never give in to this scum.
[02:46:56.424 --> 02:47:03.346]  I'll never give in to these people that love to abuse innocence and love to abuse people that are defenseless and who get off on it.
[02:47:04.866 --> 02:47:06.587]  Hell can't come soon enough for you.
[02:47:09.508 --> 02:47:10.588]  You're a bunch of cowards.
[02:47:11.658 --> 02:47:18.281]  Yourself cowardly, you go and join the biggest, most evil thing you can think of and you'll find solace and harbor and safety there.
[02:47:18.501 --> 02:47:22.523]  And all you're going to find is the black jaws of the devil chewing your guts out!
[02:47:24.744 --> 02:47:26.965]  Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here.
[02:47:29.266 --> 02:47:30.707]  Larry in Louisiana, thanks for holding.
[02:47:30.727 --> 02:47:31.107]  Go ahead.
[02:47:31.547 --> 02:47:40.651]  Hey Alex, which is more dangerous, sticking your head into the sand pretending all is grand and hoping everything will turn out okay or getting cheekbone deflate with your ballistic shields wide open?
[02:47:42.286 --> 02:47:47.176]  I want to talk to you about having to wear the wire thing in the Homeland Security deal there.
[02:47:47.216 --> 02:47:48.279]  I missed the whole thing you said.
[02:47:48.891 --> 02:47:52.234]  Yeah, they're trying to pass a law where you let the tattle on anybody you think is stealing drugs.
[02:47:52.294 --> 02:47:56.016]  You get dozens of years in prison and two and eight million dollar fines.
[02:47:56.097 --> 02:48:01.341]  And that sets up their tattletale squad groups, where then by law you've got a report on everybody.
[02:48:01.761 --> 02:48:09.647]  Right, well isn't that just really getting you to agree to be a party to the surveillance?
[02:48:09.967 --> 02:48:15.291]  I'm talking on my TiVo-style wireless digital tape recorder right now.
[02:48:16.212 --> 02:48:17.553]  Well, it's indentured servitude.
[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:19.400]  Well, you know what I'm saying.
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:22.261]  All the cell phone conversations are uploaded anyway.
[02:48:22.501 --> 02:48:24.141]  So, just dial star five seven.
[02:48:25.322 --> 02:48:25.582]  Good.
[02:48:25.622 --> 02:48:26.982]  They know how powerful we are.
[02:48:27.382 --> 02:48:28.782]  Well, I think so.
[02:48:28.802 --> 02:48:29.582]  I think it's great.
[02:48:29.602 --> 02:48:30.403]  You got my point, right?
[02:48:31.263 --> 02:48:31.863]  Yes, I do.
[02:48:33.183 --> 02:48:33.823]  Anything else?
[02:48:34.303 --> 02:48:34.684]  That's it.
[02:48:34.884 --> 02:48:35.684]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[02:48:35.704 --> 02:48:40.305]  We'll take a final call from Dave in Illinois and maybe a few others on the other side.
[02:48:40.345 --> 02:48:41.165]  A few other news items.
[02:48:45.774 --> 02:48:47.295]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.475 --> 02:48:50.578]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.698 --> 02:48:54.601]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.661 --> 02:48:58.905]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.245 --> 02:49:03.008]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.088 --> 02:49:05.030]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:08.473]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.513 --> 02:49:09.634]  The medical bills!
[02:49:11.175 --> 02:49:13.216]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.356 --> 02:49:16.398]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.578 --> 02:49:19.440]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.921 --> 02:49:26.045]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.585 --> 02:49:30.370]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:50.047 --> 02:51:52.088]  Final serving of this transmission.
[02:51:52.108 --> 02:51:53.809]  I only fear not doing the best job I can.
[02:51:53.829 --> 02:51:54.870]  I only fear not defending the innocents.
[02:51:54.890 --> 02:51:56.991]  That's what a man's supposed to do.
[02:51:57.051 --> 02:51:58.012]  If I didn't, you're over driving
[02:52:11.218 --> 02:52:20.362]  instinct to provide for your family and provide for your culture and to work hard and to be strong, then you're not a man and they've robbed you of the most precious thing you could ever imagine.
[02:52:20.862 --> 02:52:22.543]  That's why I don't want people complimenting me.
[02:52:23.343 --> 02:52:24.363]  I'm just a caveman.
[02:52:25.304 --> 02:52:26.864]  I'm just an old-fashioned person.
[02:52:27.224 --> 02:52:28.365]  That's all I am.
[02:52:30.146 --> 02:52:33.387]  Bottom line, and you've got it in you too, and you've got it a lot more than I've got it.
[02:52:33.427 --> 02:52:34.507]  You need to turn it on!
[02:52:34.848 --> 02:52:36.568]  Ask God to turn you on!
[02:52:37.369 --> 02:52:38.349]  To plug you in!
[02:52:40.327 --> 02:52:41.808]  For the soul of this universe!
[02:52:42.308 --> 02:52:43.289]  You're missing out!
[02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:46.030]  You're missing out!
[02:52:46.611 --> 02:52:48.332]  Your hair is gonna be on fire!
[02:52:48.352 --> 02:52:56.016]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Tennessee and then Dave in Illinois and that'll be it.
[02:52:56.056 --> 02:52:56.656]  Gary, go ahead.
[02:52:57.177 --> 02:52:59.898]  Yeah, Alex, if I say something, you're gonna get mad with me.
[02:53:00.979 --> 02:53:01.639]  Say whatever you want.
[02:53:01.899 --> 02:53:06.142]  Okay, well, earlier, sometimes, you know, at the first stop there,
[02:53:07.077 --> 02:53:14.921]  I was cut off because sometimes the other radio stations, they run their commercials a little longer, and so that's why I was cut off.
[02:53:15.061 --> 02:53:18.202]  Okay, but that isn't very important to Fighting the New World Order, but I appreciate that.
[02:53:18.222 --> 02:53:23.525]  Well, what I was wanting to say was, I just wanted to defend you on what happened about
[02:53:24.429 --> 02:53:31.213]  I was listening to Jack Wood last week, and I know you listen in a lot when he comes on after you.
[02:53:31.733 --> 02:53:39.478]  Sir, the people that attack me, their plan is for you to defend me, so you go get their disinfo instead of talking about the New World Order.
[02:53:39.678 --> 02:53:46.142]  What I wanted to say was... What you want to do is what you want to do, I understand.
[02:53:46.242 --> 02:53:50.645]  I'd rather listen to you than any of them, not being biased.
[02:53:50.745 --> 02:53:52.246]  I'd rather listen to you than any of them.
[02:53:53.445 --> 02:53:55.926]  And I look forward to every day to try and listen to you.
[02:53:56.106 --> 02:53:57.006]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:58.606]  You sound like a good soul, my friend.
[02:53:58.626 --> 02:54:03.667]  When that lady said that, I didn't know what it was.
[02:54:03.687 --> 02:54:03.947]  I didn't hear.
[02:54:03.967 --> 02:54:05.448]  I don't know what it was, but I don't care.
[02:54:05.468 --> 02:54:09.428]  I got cops saying they want to put me in prison and rape me.
[02:54:09.468 --> 02:54:12.189]  I mean, you know, you think I'm worried about these little feds?
[02:54:12.789 --> 02:54:13.169]  Yeah.
[02:54:14.109 --> 02:54:15.950]  Yeah, well, I just want to say that
[02:54:17.363 --> 02:54:18.924]  Somebody may have put her up to that.
[02:54:19.645 --> 02:54:20.245]  Of course.
[02:54:20.886 --> 02:54:24.288]  So they have a giant COINTELPRO budget against me.
[02:54:24.308 --> 02:54:24.788]  What do you think?
[02:54:25.829 --> 02:54:27.070]  David, Illinois, last caller.
[02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.690]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:54:28.891 --> 02:54:33.114]  Well, Alex, I was just thinking, you know, it's like that Ice Spartacus thing.
[02:54:34.735 --> 02:54:40.719]  You know, they did go after Gary Webb, but it took them years to get around to doing it.
[02:54:41.379 --> 02:54:43.941]  That's right, they've got a lot of people to kill.
[02:54:44.608 --> 02:54:48.189]  They're usually killing their own people and keeping stuff quiet, so they got limited hitmen.
[02:54:48.569 --> 02:54:57.370]  Shows like Threat Matrix and 24 are meant to, for young people to see it, and the video games and simulated assassin stuff, to grow a crop of assassins.
[02:54:58.330 --> 02:55:00.271]  The television was scarring last night.
[02:55:00.391 --> 02:55:01.631]  I think I'm going to want to talk about it.
[02:55:01.651 --> 02:55:02.131]  It was horrible.
[02:55:02.911 --> 02:55:03.791]  Was it all torture?
[02:55:03.871 --> 02:55:04.671]  All world government?
[02:55:05.612 --> 02:55:10.332]  They had one, this is all before 9 o'clock, they had one, it was like a snuff film.
[02:55:11.133 --> 02:55:13.733]  They were playing it for their little law and order jury or whatever.
[02:55:14.372 --> 02:55:28.126]  And there was another one where these guys, I guess they're lost on an island or something, and they get off the island, and they run into pirates, and they take the dude's son, and I'm just like, why are they showing this before 9 o'clock?
[02:55:28.246 --> 02:55:29.567]  It was just horrible, you know?
[02:55:29.687 --> 02:55:33.551]  It was just like, these pirates just come up, and they're like, we're gonna take the boy.
[02:55:33.651 --> 02:55:35.833]  And it was just like, what is going on?
[02:55:36.874 --> 02:55:38.155]  You know, it's things like that.
[02:55:38.195 --> 02:55:43.179]  We've got to all, you know, they're not going to line us up, and we can all say, you know, I'm Spartacus.
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:45.321]  They're going to turn us all into a bunch of demons.
[02:55:46.422 --> 02:55:52.407]  Yeah, we've got to all, you know, come up to do what you're doing or else you're going to be the only one.
[02:55:52.427 --> 02:55:58.793]  And to be an agent target, we've got to, you know, saturate the whole thing with everybody.
[02:55:59.473 --> 02:56:01.195]  Well, I'm not the target.
[02:56:01.415 --> 02:56:04.658]  Freedom and dignity and humanity and our souls are the target.
[02:56:05.538 --> 02:56:08.739]  Oh yeah, but it's like that guy said, you know, you're the head of the spear.
[02:56:08.759 --> 02:56:10.780]  Well, I wouldn't say that.
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:12.260]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:13.301 --> 02:56:13.641]  Alright?
[02:56:14.381 --> 02:56:17.562]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, back tomorrow 11 to 2.
[02:56:18.342 --> 02:56:20.583]  As we accelerate towards this weekend.
[02:56:20.603 --> 02:56:25.645]  And I hope that all of you out there will stand for what's good and decent.
[02:56:25.665 --> 02:56:26.825]  Because you only live once.
[02:56:26.845 --> 02:56:29.586]  And this life is nothing more than a test.
[02:56:30.386 --> 02:56:32.807]  You gotta ask the question, will you fail that test?
[02:56:32.847 --> 02:56:33.227]  God bless.
[02:56:36.179 --> 02:56:36.515]  Our chair...
