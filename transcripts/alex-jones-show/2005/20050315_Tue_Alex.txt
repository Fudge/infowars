[00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:06.087]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:07.789]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.630]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.112]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:12.753]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:17.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.681]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:35.732]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:37.093]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:42.054]  It is Tuesday, the 15th day of March 2005.
[00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:44.534]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:49.055]  We've got Ron Paul's office coming on, the Congressman's office, coming on.
[00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:51.016]  They contacted us this morning.
[00:00:51.036 --> 00:01:00.138]  But let us know that the expansion, the beefing up of the National ID Card Bill into a Pan-American Union gun registration
[00:01:01.207 --> 00:01:08.411]  illegal alien uh... amnesty piece of legislation that's what's in it they passed the national I.D.
[00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:28.682]  card in December of last year now about a month ago they beefed it up in the house expanded it radically and it's been sneaking around in the senate and it's now been tagged on to the budget supplemental bill or one of the largest pieces of uh... pork legislation that goes through each session of congress
[00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:39.701]  And so, we will be discussing this piece of legislation that is scheduled to pass tonight or tomorrow, and we're desperately trying to defeat it.
[00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:52.190]  Of course, we'll talk about it a little bit more before the guest gets on in the third hour, but we will detail it with Jeff Deist, Press Secretary for Congressman Ron Paul, in the third hour.
[00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.032]  We want to thank them for contacting us.
[00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:55.899]  Calling us?
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.683]  They work so hard to try to defeat this legislation.
[00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:02.124]  They care so much.
[00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:08.930]  It's a 180 degrees difference than most of the other members of Congress and people in government, period.
[00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:11.572]  They think they're public servants, which they are.
[00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:17.277]  Not rulers or authorities or officials, but public servants.
[00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:22.362]  In the middle of the second hour, we've got a guest coming on.
[00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:29.741]  Who didn't have a sign up in his business against Bush, but got a call from the government saying, hey, you're not allowed to have signs.
[00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.481]  We're just calling everybody.
[00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.361]  And he said, wait a minute.
[00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:33.902]  I'm a veteran.
[00:02:34.282 --> 00:02:35.362]  This is America.
[00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:38.543]  If I want to stick a sign up in my business, I will.
[00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:40.923]  And they said, oh no, you don't.
[00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:43.324]  Oh no, you don't.
[00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:45.885]  You thought this was America.
[00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.805]  You thought you were free.
[00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.766]  You do what we say when we say, boy,
[00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.424]  When we say jump, you say yes sir, and you ask how high.
[00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:00.687]  Or we'll slap you upside the head and put you in a prison.
[00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.848]  How does that sound to you?
[00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.609]  This is freedom!
[00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.231]  I'm not joking around.
[00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:10.833]  This is out of the Memphis Flyer, Mainstream News.
[00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:16.017]  Federal agent banned anti-bush signs in downtown storefronts.
[00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:20.500]  They said, you're not allowed to have a sign in your storefront.
[00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:24.077]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:28.339]  Big Brother Airport Tech X-Ray Screeners and Sweat Sensors.
[00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.321]  We talked about this last week, but new details in the U.S.
[00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:31.821]  and England.
[00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.283]  If you're sweating, folks, you may be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:40.485]  Just like last year, having a road almanac, a road atlas, or world atlas is even worse.
[00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:41.646]  Risk watch.
[00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:44.558]  These are terrorist signs.
[00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:45.959]  We're all basically terrorists.
[00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.699]  Aren't we lucky?
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.842]  We've got a nice government wearing black ski masks to keep us safe.
[00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:55.005]  We don't need more Border Patrol though, but we just as citizens need to give all our freedoms up.
[00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:58.048]  Halliburton Unit faces Pentagon inquiry.
[00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:02.031]  So that's like a capo is going to investigate his own Don.
[00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.993]  And of course find Don
[00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:13.386]  Don Chaney, completely innocent as usual, so everything... But don't worry, there'll be an investigation.
[00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:20.570]  We'll put someone who's done absolutely nothing, like Martha Stewart, in prison, and the general public will feel like we've done something.
[00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.112]  Another story here, Pakistan lost Bin Laden trail.
[00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:30.876]  Last year, Mr. Musarraf, the dictator our government put in, back in 2000,
[00:04:33.743 --> 00:04:36.624]  The guy who has nuclear weapons, the guy who said he'll shoot U.S.
[00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:37.784]  troops, we go, yes sir!
[00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:40.464]  Oh, he can't catch Bin Laden.
[00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:42.605]  Well, get your story straight.
[00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:46.706]  Buzzy Krongard, number three at the CIA, has said, we don't want to capture him.
[00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:47.686]  Leave him alone.
[00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.706]  He's a wonderful person.
[00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:52.927]  That Buzzy Krongard.
[00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:57.548]  PrisonPlanet.TV, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net.
[00:04:57.628 --> 00:04:58.428]  Your call's coming up.
[00:04:58.448 --> 00:04:58.868]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:02.449]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.730]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.771]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:14.033]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:18.154]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:20.075]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:23.596]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:28.378]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:31.559]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:34.600]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.202]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:45.543]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:45.943 --> 00:05:47.324]  Order your video today.
[00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:48.704]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:51.045]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:05.960]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.403]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.244]  We listened.
[00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:16.527]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:17.288]  We listened.
[00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.730]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.671]  We listened.
[00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:25.213]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:25.894]  We're good.
[00:06:59.823 --> 00:07:06.449]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:16.899]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:19.061]  With a 100% kill.
[00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:24.185]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural herb and spice products from North American Herb and Spice.
[00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:28.649]  Call 877-817-9829 to order or ask for a free catalog.
[00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:37.678]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Herb and Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Herb and Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[00:07:38.118 --> 00:07:43.303]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.
[00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:45.523]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:50.805]  That's 877-817-9829 and start down the road to herbal health.
[00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.785]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.
[00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.665]  The choice is yours.
[00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:58.806]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American Herb and Spice products today.
[00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:03.427]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:06.788]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:15.497]  Alright, we're now 8 minutes, 11 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:15.938 --> 00:08:19.221]  Your calls are coming up the next hour and 20 minutes.
[00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:21.623]  And we've got a guest coming on third hour.
[00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:24.036]  Talk to folks from Ron Paul's office.
[00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:28.139]  We're on the verge of the Super National ID card passing.
[00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:41.667]  And again, if you get confused, they passed the basic National ID card with a bunch of draconian, nightmare, un-American, Soviet, Stasi-style provisions December of last year.
[00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:49.933]  Now, the supermassive, just, it can't get any worse, frankly, sucker is about to pass.
[00:08:50.973 --> 00:08:58.716]  Of course, I shouldn't say that because it can actually get worse, and they're already talking about doing the things that make it even worse.
[00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:03.477]  Grocery stores and the malls and the companies are all racing to implement it.
[00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:05.198]  We'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:10.780]  First off, we're hearing that anthrax may have been detected.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.942]  Anthrax may have been detected at a mail room in D.C.
[00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.340]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.642]  Sensors at two military mail facilities in the Washington, D.C.
[00:09:25.802 --> 00:09:31.345]  area detected signs of anthrax on two pieces of mail Monday.
[00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:37.068]  But Pentagon officials said the mail had already been irradiated, rendering any anthrax inert.
[00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.350]  Officials weren't sure if it was an attack.
[00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.110]  Additional test.
[00:09:41.262 --> 00:09:52.087]  And other sensors at two facilities, one of them at the Pentagon and the other nearby, found no presence of the bacteria, which can be used as a biological weapon.
[00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:55.329]  There were no initial reports of illnesses.
[00:09:55.949 --> 00:10:02.692]  The Pentagon's mail delivery site, which is separate from the main Pentagon building, was evacuated and shut down.
[00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:09.156]  Yesterday, after sensors triggered an alarm sounding at 10.30 a.m.
[00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:18.469]  Eastern Standard Time, Spokesman Glenn Flood said it was expected to remain closed until later today while the investigation continued.
[00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:22.290]  Hours later, sensors at a second Defense Department mailroom were triggered.
[00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:31.832]  Firefighters in the nearby Bailey's Crossroads section of Fairfax County, Virginia reported that a military mailroom had been shut down after a hazardous material alert.
[00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:38.994]  No one was allowed to leave the high-rise complex that houses the facility until mid-evening last night.
[00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:43.875]  Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Jane Campbell said the mail
[00:10:44.947 --> 00:10:48.649]  At both facilities were irradiated before arriving in either one.
[00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.772]  Radiation treatment would kill any anthrax bacteria, but sensors would still be able to detect it.
[00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:56.754]  She had no information about the origin of the two pieces of mail.
[00:10:57.234 --> 00:11:00.016]  About 175 people at the Pentagon's mail facility.
[00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:04.880]  Another 100 may have been in contact with deliveries from the Pentagon, officials said.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:18.771]  Medical personnel took cultures from anyone who may have had contact with those deliveries, and those people were also offered a three-day course of antibiotics and told to watch for the signs of anthrax exposure, fever, sweats, and chills.
[00:11:19.372 --> 00:11:22.754]  Why not go ahead and put them all on Cipro immediately?
[00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:23.695]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:25.497]  Let me just stop right there.
[00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:29.280]  This is a good time to bring back maybe a 120 second recap of what went on with anthrax.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.323]  Shortly after 9-11, about a month after we learned that right on the day or the day before 9-11,
[00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:54.605]  Postmarked letters were sent to American media in Florida.
[00:11:55.565 --> 00:12:03.687]  The right to the individual who'd done the front page story with the photos of the Trump-Bush daughters grabbing on people, falling down on each other.
[00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:09.049]  And then of course, Tom Daschle and other Senators that the Globalists didn't like.
[00:12:09.989 --> 00:12:17.772]  This all happened and then suddenly we heard that it was this Hatfield character, they claimed he'd brooded up
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.961]  In a bucket somewhere.
[00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:25.046]  Of course, then they claimed it was just old-fashioned, no big deal anthrax.
[00:12:26.067 --> 00:12:32.914]  Until the Pentagon's own reports came out and got released, and they admit it's the most weaponized anthrax known to man.
[00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:54.806]  A multi-million dollar process of miniaturizing the spores, and then a process that takes a hundred million dollars of equipment and a large factory area, a patented US Pentagon process, only developed in the last 15 years, of coating each spore with tiny little sails, or bentonite.
[00:12:55.484 --> 00:13:04.187]  That way the tiny spores are easily aerosolized and picked up by air, even in an environment with almost no air, just breathing on it will stir it up.
[00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:10.749]  And it's meant so that when you use it in warfare, it doesn't just fall to the ground and bind with the soil.
[00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:18.532]  And then we found the 1999 publicly funded congressional study for Fort Detrick, Maryland,
[00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:25.514]  $1.2 million to test mailing anthrax through the mail.
[00:13:25.614 --> 00:13:29.716]  And then, lo and behold, where have the anthrax we later found out come from?
[00:13:30.116 --> 00:13:31.838]  Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:32.718]  That's admitted.
[00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:36.520]  And they tried to burn somebody who hadn't even been there.
[00:13:37.081 --> 00:13:44.425]  And then, of course, we even know the name of the individual who was actually working on the program and who clearly was involved, but he was left alone.
[00:13:45.197 --> 00:14:03.870]  And I said on the day of 9-11, I said, I said on air, it's still posted that first day, I have the headline, no matter who was behind it, they're certainly using it for their own gain, and then I put under it that I believe it was the Globalist, and put Northwoods and other documents, and I said, 50% chance we're going to see a biological attack in the next month.
[00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.990]  How did I know that?
[00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.833]  Because I've been reading the different war games and fear-mongering the Pentagon,
[00:14:10.038 --> 00:14:19.884]  That is, select criminal groups and others have been doing in the year before 9-11, and these guys love to brag and giggle about what they've done, and I picked up on some of their fear-mongering on TV.
[00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:38.454]  And of course, the biggest piece of evidence of where the anthrax came from is the fact that the Associated Press reported, along with about 50 other major publications, that the White House cabinet, over two-thirds of the staff, the entire cabinet, had gone on SIPRO on September 10th.
[00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:43.497]  On September 10th, because of the globalists, we're going to be mailing it out.
[00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:45.619]  It's going to be going through the mail room in D.C.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:58.013]  Some of that mail will be making its way into the White House, and we can't have that, because the mail would mix in with other mail, and spores would leak through the seals on the envelopes, and they knew.
[00:14:58.033 --> 00:14:58.954]  No one else knew.
[00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:08.700]  And, uh, later when Ari Fleischer got asked about it at the press conference a few months later, and we have the transcript of that, uh, we hear the President and other members of Cabinet were on SEPRA.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.501]  And he said, uh, yes, they were.
[00:15:10.861 --> 00:15:11.242]  That's true.
[00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:12.282]  They went on it September 10th.
[00:15:12.823 --> 00:15:13.923]  Again, that's the thing they do.
[00:15:13.983 --> 00:15:15.104]  They hide it in plain view.
[00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:16.745]  He didn't go, uh, no, that's not true.
[00:15:17.005 --> 00:15:18.106]  He just went, yeah, mm-hmm, sure.
[00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.707]  Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah, mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:20.828]  That's right.
[00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:21.328]  Sure was.
[00:15:21.668 --> 00:15:25.531]  And then some people make excuses and go, well, they got a security alert.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.642]  And so they just take care of themselves.
[00:15:29.102 --> 00:15:29.463]  Oh yeah?
[00:15:29.923 --> 00:15:35.147]  For weeks after it even showed up in Boca Raton, Florida, and for days after it showed up in D.C.
[00:15:35.187 --> 00:15:39.090]  mail rooms, they didn't go put the workers on Cipro.
[00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.972]  They didn't put them on other antibiotics that would have done an even better job.
[00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:43.494]  No, they didn't do anything for them!
[00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:45.155]  And a couple of them died!
[00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:47.677]  That's where some of the deaths resulted!
[00:15:48.718 --> 00:15:49.979]  They just do not care!
[00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:53.818]  And some people got sick in the Capitol.
[00:15:53.918 --> 00:15:59.081]  And then, of the six office buildings around the Capitol, what was it?
[00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:00.442]  Five of them were shut down.
[00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.423]  A bunch of the offices in the Capitol were shut down.
[00:16:02.804 --> 00:16:09.348]  Federal protective details, literally men in black uniforms and helmets and ski masks, showed up in the Capitol.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:18.003]  When Daschle released the fact that it was weaponized anthrax, sort of hinting at where it may have come from, they showed up and threatened him with arrest.
[00:16:18.023 --> 00:16:18.523]  Remember that?
[00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:21.344]  Oh, you're leaking stuff you got in the Intelligence Committee!
[00:16:21.584 --> 00:16:22.705]  Shut your mouth!
[00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:24.665]  Shut your mouth!
[00:16:24.705 --> 00:16:27.846]  And then later they had to admit, okay, it was super weaponized, U.S.
[00:16:27.966 --> 00:16:29.567]  brand, you know.
[00:16:30.968 --> 00:16:33.849]  And they've still got their disinfo people saying it was Saddam.
[00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:36.089]  Saddam didn't have factories that would do that.
[00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:37.590]  No one does but the U.S.
[00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.612]  The Russians didn't coat theirs in bentonite.
[00:16:41.092 --> 00:16:45.156]  They would just launch about 75 to 150 different types of spores.
[00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:47.478]  That was what they did, not the U.S.
[00:16:47.818 --> 00:16:53.463]  They would launch about 10 different types of spores miniaturized and coated in bentonite.
[00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:57.626]  I mean, they take each spore and basically put little wings on it.
[00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:04.172]  Alright, so that's the facts on the... I said 120 seconds, that's more like
[00:17:04.784 --> 00:17:06.085]  Five, five, six, seven minutes.
[00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.487]  I just have to talk about this.
[00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:09.989]  This is so important.
[00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.391]  And this may be a false alarm, I don't know.
[00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:19.317]  Before 9-11, but I mean, it's the people and thing to go on antibiotics, period.
[00:17:20.278 --> 00:17:22.941]  But, I mean, two different facilities, alarms going off.
[00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.342]  Maybe they did this to fearmonger.
[00:17:24.742 --> 00:17:26.124]  We know the Pentagon likes to do that.
[00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:29.667]  I don't know what's going on, but it should be taken seriously.
[00:17:30.586 --> 00:17:32.508]  But for years before 9-11, remember?
[00:17:33.128 --> 00:17:42.757]  Every week or so, you'd hear in Nebraska, or Ohio, or California, or Texas, a courthouse, federal courthouse, or federal mail rooms would be shut down.
[00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:46.180]  Oh, we think an anthrax, you know, a letter would come saying anthrax.
[00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:51.614]  And then it came out in the news a few times that, oh, it was a drill we were testing to see.
[00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:55.138]  But it would come out like a month later, just a quiet footnote, and most people never heard it.
[00:17:55.518 --> 00:17:57.620]  Oh, it was a test to see how we'd respond.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:04.347]  It was part of a dark winter drill, or part of a pop-off one or two, or pop-off E-70Q.
[00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.730]  You know, just all these different operations.
[00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.871]  Fake nuclear spills in Austin.
[00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:09.832]  Shut the city down.
[00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:12.274]  Quietly announced later it was a drill.
[00:18:12.534 --> 00:18:14.476]  People still to this day I talk to think it was real.
[00:18:14.496 --> 00:18:16.557]  Remember the nuclear spill?
[00:18:16.577 --> 00:18:17.978]  I had to call the troops out?
[00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:18.579]  No, no.
[00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:19.480]  It was a drill.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.420]  No!
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.061]  No!
[00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.142]  No, it's real!
[00:18:22.262 --> 00:18:22.762]  No, no.
[00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:24.523]  They admitted it was a drill, but very quietly.
[00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.426]  We've had fake bio-attacks in Austin.
[00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:28.546]  Downtown shut down.
[00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:29.567]  Turns out it's a drill.
[00:18:30.308 --> 00:18:32.049]  Drill, drill, drill, drill, drill.
[00:18:32.129 --> 00:18:33.810]  But oh, it wasn't a drill on 9-11.
[00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:36.973]  When they sent out that anthrax from Fort Dedrick,
[00:18:38.593 --> 00:18:39.513]  Oh no, it wasn't drill.
[00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:40.373]  Most people died.
[00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:43.474]  Everybody who was enemies with a particular sect of globalists.
[00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:48.715]  Alright, now we got Jack and Carlos and Jason and many others already holding.
[00:18:48.755 --> 00:18:49.776]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:49.836]  800-259-9231.
[00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:50.496]  I want to get to this.
[00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:52.856]  Federal agents ban anti-Bush signs in downtown storefronts.
[00:18:52.876 --> 00:18:54.377]  This is out of the Memphis Flyer.
[00:19:05.057 --> 00:19:13.959]  They don't just go to people that are selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes, or pot dealers, or topless bars, or zoning disputes now, or people that complain too much, and arrest you.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:20.861]  No, they just, when Bush is going to be driving through a town, they call and say, no signs allowed in your windows.
[00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:21.962]  Do you understand?
[00:19:23.382 --> 00:19:24.582]  Do you understand us?
[00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:30.824]  And I remember when Bush went to a couple of different African cities, they actually bulldozed shantytowns on the way from the airport
[00:19:31.508 --> 00:19:35.009]  And arrested tens of thousands and put them in a sports stadium in one particular case?
[00:19:35.429 --> 00:19:41.311]  Just so there wouldn't be any protesting or any... Just so... Remember the Queen of England and BBC?
[00:19:42.632 --> 00:19:47.714]  She didn't want to actually, uh... In Nigeria, want to be seen with the children.
[00:19:47.994 --> 00:19:50.174]  So they had her on the set of a soap opera.
[00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:53.676]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:56.336]  I mean, it's just... I'm not kidding.
[00:19:58.117 --> 00:19:58.757]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:05.056]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[00:20:12.142 --> 00:20:13.122]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.202 --> 00:20:14.583]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:20:14.624 --> 00:20:15.044]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:15.644 --> 00:20:18.727]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[00:20:19.247 --> 00:20:21.729]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.320]  Gold is gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.602]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:40.244]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:13.424]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:21:14.405 --> 00:21:19.329]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:22.211]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:23.392]  There may be more.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:31.381]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[00:23:03.975 --> 00:23:05.136]  Is your hair looking thinner?

[00:24:15.846 --> 00:24:17.646]  Oh, the President's going to be driving through your town.
[00:24:17.686 --> 00:24:20.267]  You're allowed to have pro-bush signs in your windows, but no anti-bush.
[00:24:20.287 --> 00:24:20.847]  You understand?
[00:24:20.867 --> 00:24:20.927]  Huh.
[00:24:22.347 --> 00:24:23.747]  That's the new freedom, folks.
[00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:27.808]  Well, I wasn't thinking about doing it, but now I'm going to do it, buddy.
[00:24:29.088 --> 00:24:30.028]  This is America.
[00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:31.149]  Oh, no, it's not.
[00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:32.689]  Just wait and see.
[00:24:33.069 --> 00:24:34.509]  Jack in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:35.149]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:35.509]  Welcome.
[00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.410]  Yeah, how are you?
[00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.070]  Good, sir.
[00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:43.531]  Hey, uh, there's one, uh, aspect of this, uh, proper mechanics that you hadn't talked about too much.
[00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:44.311]  Okay.
[00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:49.970]  You're talking about the Popular Mechanics hit piece written by the family member of the Homeland Security Director.
[00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:50.531]  Right.
[00:24:51.593 --> 00:24:53.196]  These same people are the same people.
[00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.608]  It's been doing this for years in the public mechanics.
[00:24:56.988 --> 00:24:59.670]  You know, I read it some when I was a child.
[00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.091]  I think my dad subscribed to it.
[00:25:01.632 --> 00:25:04.033]  But I hadn't read it in many, many years.
[00:25:04.434 --> 00:25:07.236]  And I was looking at back issues, sort of paying attention, and yeah.
[00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:07.616]  Yeah.
[00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:09.677]  DU is nutritious for the troops.
[00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:10.478]  Yeah.
[00:25:10.518 --> 00:25:11.759]  World government's good.
[00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:12.620]  Yeah, all this stuff.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:20.105]  Well, they did, when World Towers was being built, they did a complete lead-out sheet on that.
[00:25:20.165 --> 00:25:21.066]  I got the magazine.
[00:25:22.231 --> 00:25:28.234]  When it was being built, how good it was, and what kind of technology went into the building, and all the brick that went in there.
[00:25:28.554 --> 00:25:36.097]  I know, I've gotten emails about how there was a popular mechanics when they built it, talking about how it could withstand big jet aircraft and all this.
[00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:37.798]  I've got the magazine if you'd like it.
[00:25:38.518 --> 00:25:41.200]  Absolutely, that would be wonderful.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:41.860]  Mail it to me.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.661]  I don't want to take your old issue, but that would be nice.
[00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:45.962]  Yeah, I've got the whole thing.
[00:25:46.002 --> 00:25:50.844]  But if you go back to something in the fifties and read some of the old magazines, you can pick out what you're saying.
[00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:52.622]  Nowadays.
[00:25:53.463 --> 00:25:58.484]  What you're talking about nowadays, you can pick that stuff out in the old magazines back in the fifties.
[00:25:58.584 --> 00:26:01.745]  I've got a 1937 actual New York Times.
[00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:03.846]  I mean, I've got THE New York Times.
[00:26:04.766 --> 00:26:07.067]  And it shows the ten regions.
[00:26:07.087 --> 00:26:08.168]  They didn't call it FEMA.
[00:26:08.568 --> 00:26:10.028]  And it said, oh, we'll have ten regions.
[00:26:10.048 --> 00:26:11.709]  We're going to be part of a global government.
[00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:14.250]  We're going to have these big highways up from Mexico.
[00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.790]  It's going to be the American Union.
[00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:17.551]  Everything that's now happening.
[00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:22.267]  Yeah, they was using that magazine back then to propaganda stuff.
[00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.470]  That's all I wanted to say.
[00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.911]  Well, Jack, good to hear from you, and I would love that magazine.
[00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.392]  That would be a nice gift for the broadcast.
[00:26:28.432 --> 00:26:28.792]  Thank you.
[00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:31.213]  Listeners send me just incredible stuff.
[00:26:31.253 --> 00:26:37.735]  I was just sent another almanac from Bohemian Grove, another one of these rare books, internal books, and I called and checked it out.
[00:26:37.755 --> 00:26:40.316]  It's one of their real publications, and boy, it's a doozy!
[00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:45.618]  I've got to get that on the web, some of the screenshots, some of the scans of the pages.
[00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:48.739]  Carlos in California, welcome.
[00:26:49.713 --> 00:26:51.194]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[00:26:51.474 --> 00:26:53.955]  Just hearing what you were saying on Anthrax.
[00:26:54.875 --> 00:26:59.236]  You know, the government's got us going up and down with these spear-mongering.
[00:26:59.897 --> 00:27:00.757]  They're laughing at us.
[00:27:00.797 --> 00:27:02.638]  You know, we're nothing but sheep to these people.
[00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:06.079]  They're so callous, indifferent, diabolical.
[00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:09.460]  And like I said, we're nothing but sheep.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.242]  That's why they killed millions of people in Africa, in Rwanda, and all these other places.
[00:27:14.282 --> 00:27:17.963]  Right now, they killed three, four hundred thousand, and they're so indifferent about it.
[00:27:18.615 --> 00:27:37.041]  But getting back to anthrax, I heard a speech by Dr. Leonard Horowitz, who wrote Death in the Air, and he mentioned that there were only a couple of places that could produce the specific configuration of anthrax that was used.
[00:27:37.642 --> 00:27:39.922]  And those were both U.S.
[00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:41.143]  plants and U.S.
[00:27:41.183 --> 00:27:41.663]  designs?
[00:27:42.654 --> 00:27:46.877]  Exactly, and he tried to tell the FBI and they wouldn't even pay attention to him.
[00:27:47.197 --> 00:27:51.880]  Oh no, worse than that, they came to his house and said, what are you up to?
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.521]  Oh, okay.
[00:27:53.801 --> 00:27:54.221]  Oh yeah.
[00:27:54.761 --> 00:28:05.508]  Okay, he didn't mention that part, but this is a very well-known doctor, very reputable, and he knows his material, they wouldn't pay attention to him.
[00:28:06.028 --> 00:28:10.711]  Well, Dr. Horowitz pioneered exposing it, but it later all came out.
[00:28:12.012 --> 00:28:12.252]  Okay.
[00:28:12.782 --> 00:28:29.616]  But another thing that I read is that BioPort, which apparently produces it, was owned, and now I don't know this for a fact, but it was mentioned on a couple of websites, that the Bush family and Ben Lovin, the Ben Lovin family... No, no, no, that's true.
[00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:30.957]  That's... Is that true?
[00:28:31.117 --> 00:28:34.080]  That's Reuters, that's, yeah, and Admiral Crowe ran it.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.085]  It was part of a consortium owned in part through the Carlyle Group and by the company that also sold Cipro.
[00:28:40.105 --> 00:28:40.245]  Right.
[00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:47.312]  And so, you know, back in the 80's we shipped a great amount of this to Iraq, Anthrax.
[00:28:48.773 --> 00:28:58.198]  Yeah, even up until 1993, they did ship Anthrax, but it was not this particular weaponized strain.
[00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:07.844]  Well, they were still trying to blame Iraq for it, and people usually don't know that we even shipped them some of this material.
[00:29:08.889 --> 00:29:12.292]  We're trying to find a good excuse for going to war with Iraq at the time.
[00:29:12.492 --> 00:29:13.292]  No, that's true.
[00:29:13.813 --> 00:29:16.635]  But anthrax only lasts about six to eight months.
[00:29:17.215 --> 00:29:19.777]  And when you coat it in bentonite, it lasts even less.
[00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:27.583]  So there's no way stuff that, even though it wasn't the same strain that Saddam got in the early 90s and late 80s, was Saddam.
[00:29:28.824 --> 00:29:29.084]  Right.
[00:29:29.744 --> 00:29:33.007]  Well, you know, we hear a lot about all these different viruses out there.
[00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:37.090]  West Nile virus and... Uh, that was shipped... that was shipped to Sudan.
[00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.532]  Part of the same CDC shipment, 93.
[00:29:40.893 --> 00:29:45.757]  Well, you know, in the Sudan, they have a lab that is owned by... I think, living by a medic.
[00:29:46.978 --> 00:29:49.680]  That is owned by the Rockefellers... Stay there.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.060]  Stay there.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.801]  We'll let you talk more.
[00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:52.502]  We're on the march.

[00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:20.182]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway, so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:33:20.462 --> 00:33:22.423]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[00:33:22.463 --> 00:33:29.787]  The Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation, Ted Turner's U.N.
[00:33:29.847 --> 00:33:36.230]  Foundation, he's given over a billion dollars to all of these groups.
[00:33:37.216 --> 00:34:06.120]  All of these elitists, the World Wildlife Foundation set up by Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's hubby, father of Prince Charles, his little brood, they all write books and have statements about how we've got a controlled population and they fund these population control systems and studies through the UN, but then out of the other side of their mouth they talk about how much they love the children.
[00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:10.735]  of Latin America and Africa's, particularly in Asia.
[00:34:11.756 --> 00:34:22.024]  And they have these vaccine programs and then the UN gets caught adding hormones to tetanus shots that sterilize the women permanently.
[00:34:22.044 --> 00:34:27.669]  This is mainstream news in Europe, mainstream news in Africa, mainstream news in India.
[00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:31.652]  Big Indian laboratories do tests on the vaccines that are given by the UN.
[00:34:31.672 --> 00:34:32.292]  They go, what?
[00:34:32.393 --> 00:34:33.654]  This will sterilize everybody.
[00:34:34.014 --> 00:34:35.195]  Of course, 20 years ago
[00:34:36.158 --> 00:34:40.821]  They'd pay them millions of dollars and they'd just go around picking up all the poor women and cutting their tubes.
[00:34:42.222 --> 00:34:42.862]  By the millions.
[00:34:43.863 --> 00:34:45.283]  By the millions in Latin America.
[00:34:45.323 --> 00:34:52.948]  In Peru, the forced sterilization still goes on, or they do it like, well, you know, we forced the Indians, the natives, all off their land.
[00:34:53.468 --> 00:34:57.891]  We forced them off, what they say, and, you know, it's for your own good, we're going to force you into the city.
[00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:01.933]  And now, we're going to offer you money to survive.
[00:35:01.953 --> 00:35:04.775]  A very small amount of money, but you've got to be sterilized.
[00:35:05.925 --> 00:35:08.326]  That's one of the nicer, more humane ways they do it.
[00:35:08.766 --> 00:35:11.247]  Twenty years ago, all over the planet, it was just grab them and do it.
[00:35:11.267 --> 00:35:14.309]  People started resisting and having gun battles with the police.
[00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:17.070]  It goes on and on.
[00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.191]  And so, yes, there is systematic biological warfare.
[00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:22.732]  We now have a Nobel laureate.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:28.955]  Well, there's actually two, but a new one, somebody that won in 2004, a female scientist.
[00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.937]  She did studies and tests and said, yeah, they're putting HIV
[00:35:36.204 --> 00:35:38.205]  ...into the vaccines.
[00:35:39.926 --> 00:35:51.812]  They had a big article on the BBC about a study where they found that young people, you know, children who never had sex, whose parents didn't have HIV, they did medical exams, had HIV and they didn't know how.
[00:35:52.332 --> 00:35:53.933]  All they'd had was the shot.
[00:35:54.818 --> 00:35:58.000]  And so then some doctors got some of the injectors that the U.N.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.644]  had left, you know, thrown in the trash, took them, and found that they had live HIV in them, and then the U.N.
[00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:08.046]  and BBC said, well, that's because they were using the same needles on a bunch of people.
[00:36:08.947 --> 00:36:09.527]  That's what.
[00:36:10.148 --> 00:36:14.470]  Well, regardless, if that's it, then that's just as bad, but that's not it, folks.
[00:36:16.131 --> 00:36:18.813]  Then people will argue, well, HIV doesn't cause AIDS.
[00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:31.326]  And it's true that most of the white people that are able to get it have been snorting masses of methamphetamine cooked up in a bathtub full of heavy metals and Grignard reagents.
[00:36:32.346 --> 00:36:39.491]  And those heavy metals do, after long-term exposure, by long-term, a year of heavy use, kill your T lymphocytes.
[00:36:39.591 --> 00:36:40.452]  Major studies on this.
[00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:49.198]  Those are the programming white blood cells that go around and tell the other white blood cells in the area what to do.
[00:36:49.218 --> 00:36:50.099]  They're like generals.
[00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:58.762]  So basically, HIV kills the leadership, kills the programming cells, the T-lymphocytes.
[00:36:59.783 --> 00:37:04.808]  So really, from the studies I've seen and the doctors we've talked to, the scientists, it really does cause AIDS.
[00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:06.730]  But I said, white people!
[00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:11.035]  It is a race-specific bio-weapon.
[00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:18.228]  And we have the Navy documents, we have the documents, what it was engineered and paid for in the late 1970s.
[00:37:18.329 --> 00:37:20.690]  I mean, that's public!
[00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:25.153]  They don't call it HIV, they call it human autoimmune virus.
[00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:27.174]  That's how it's described.
[00:37:27.194 --> 00:37:28.855]  And a study is a bioweapon.
[00:37:29.656 --> 00:37:39.262]  And that's why in studies of blacks, Hispanics, particularly blacks, Asians, who come in contact with it, they're hundreds of times more likely.
[00:37:39.682 --> 00:37:41.183]  So you take a black population,
[00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:48.972]  That isn't even... that is as, or in some cases, not as sexually active, say, as a white college campus.
[00:37:50.332 --> 00:37:54.794]  A predominantly white college campus that's even more sexually promiscuous.
[00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:57.115]  And the blacks are going to be much higher.
[00:37:57.715 --> 00:37:59.375]  You cannot ignore these statistics.
[00:38:00.276 --> 00:38:01.816]  And it's just rampant.
[00:38:01.876 --> 00:38:08.639]  Some countries in Africa, 45% of the population has the HIV virus.
[00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:10.931]  Now, something's happened.
[00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:16.553]  If the folks in Africa are getting a lot of good nutrition, a lot of good food, they don't die from it.
[00:38:17.693 --> 00:38:28.655]  Well, now they've got the UN program to bring in the drugs, which they admit are basically pesticides, that's what the drugs are, that suppress the immune system.
[00:38:28.735 --> 00:38:34.977]  Why would you want to suppress the immune system when the HIV virus destroys the ability of the immune system to operate?
[00:38:36.172 --> 00:38:38.293]  It doesn't get rid of the white blood cells, the general ones.
[00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:40.753]  I mean, just the standard ones.
[00:38:40.813 --> 00:38:42.774]  It gets rid of the commander cells.
[00:38:44.574 --> 00:38:46.094]  And it's bad for Asians.
[00:38:46.174 --> 00:38:52.176]  It's bad for people of Aboriginal, Asian descent.
[00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:56.797]  You know, most Latin Americans I talk to don't know they're Asian.
[00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:57.477]  Did you know that?
[00:38:58.037 --> 00:39:05.019]  They don't know that if you take a pure Indian from a pure Eskimo,
[00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.171]  Oh, that's the improper term.
[00:39:07.291 --> 00:39:07.752]  Inuit.
[00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:15.420]  Or you take somebody who has pure native derivations, say, from the Brazilian rainforest.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.141]  It's almost identical.
[00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.103]  It's like the same family group.
[00:39:19.364 --> 00:39:19.844]  Same people.
[00:39:20.705 --> 00:39:26.951]  Came across the Bering Strait when it was a merger there with Russia by Alaska.
[00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:31.382]  This is what's really going on.
[00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:34.463]  And I don't want to get into too long of a scientific discussion about this.
[00:39:34.983 --> 00:39:38.325]  I want to go back to your calls, but Carlos brought this up.
[00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:43.907]  And if you're doubting the government will do this, two years ago, Jane's Weapons Encyclopedia.
[00:39:43.987 --> 00:39:44.847]  I mean, they are premier.
[00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:52.210]  You know, they tell you about the B-2 bomber five years before they rolled it out on the tarmac in 1987 at the Lockheed Skunk Works.
[00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:58.353]  You know, they tell you about X-ray lasers before it's on the History Channel, you know, a decade before.
[00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:03.637]  Well, they put out a worldwide alert, and James doesn't do that very often.
[00:40:04.678 --> 00:40:11.062]  They put out an alert on Pakistan having nukes before it went public, or on South Africa having them before Apartheid fell.
[00:40:12.322 --> 00:40:16.905]  They put out an alert saying, race-specific bioweapons have been developed.
[00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.827]  We don't have all the specifics, but we know they're out there, and we know that the U.S.
[00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:21.948]  and England have developed them.
[00:40:22.408 --> 00:40:24.789]  And the Chinese and the Ruskies are working on it, too.
[00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:26.711]  As were the South Africans.
[00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:32.733]  So, and this is important, now listen to me carefully.
[00:40:33.353 --> 00:40:49.880]  In the September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses document, 25 page document, it's in my new film, partial, I'll show you the document, and the blow-ups of the particular passages, Dick Cheney wrote this with Jeb Bush.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:56.343]  There's 25 members of PNAC, very elite group, inner group, but Jeb and Cheney wrote this.
[00:40:57.623 --> 00:40:58.884]  Richard Cheney and Jeb
[00:40:59.753 --> 00:41:00.434]  Jeb Bush.
[00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:09.271]  And it says we need to legitimize, this is a quote, we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons
[00:41:10.521 --> 00:41:12.002]  And need to further their development.
[00:41:12.122 --> 00:41:13.963]  So, legitimizing the media of their use.
[00:41:14.623 --> 00:41:15.303]  Oh, yeah!
[00:41:15.423 --> 00:41:18.144]  Using something that'll kill a certain race of people is good!
[00:41:18.625 --> 00:41:21.046]  They're openly talking about it in that same document.
[00:41:21.386 --> 00:41:24.988]  It's a bone-chilling, bone-shattering piece of material.
[00:41:25.948 --> 00:41:30.010]  They talk about, you know, we need Pearl Harbor events to get the people behind a war for global domination.
[00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:35.592]  Saddam isn't a threat, but he's got an oil supply, but we'll use Iraq as a launch base to invade Syria and Iran.
[00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:36.973]  We don't have to.
[00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:42.157]  Go to Richard Clarke coming out and saying, oh yeah, they plan to invade day one.
[00:41:42.658 --> 00:41:46.660]  We don't have to go to O'Neal, who they then claim, you know, has got sour grapes.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.241]  I mean, it's Dick Cheney!
[00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:52.223]  But, I digress.
[00:41:52.403 --> 00:41:54.004]  I want to hurry to these calls and cover the news.
[00:41:54.604 --> 00:41:55.585]  We've got a bunch of people here.
[00:41:55.825 --> 00:41:57.286]  Carlos, finish up what you were going to say.
[00:41:58.166 --> 00:42:00.688]  Well, I was just to amplify what you were saying.
[00:42:01.943 --> 00:42:06.645]  I believe there's a little biomedics at a plant, I think, in Sudan or Uganda.
[00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:08.105]  I forget which exactly.
[00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:11.986]  But they were testing and producing a West Nile virus.
[00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:19.008]  And you know, incidentally, the virus broke out amongst the population.
[00:42:19.048 --> 00:42:20.669]  I mean, how convenient.
[00:42:20.689 --> 00:42:23.550]  They're testing it there, then it breaks out among the population.
[00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:30.292]  And then here at Columbia, I think the Rockefeller University also was testing the West Nile virus.
[00:42:30.666 --> 00:42:32.226]  And it breaks out in the United States!
[00:42:32.306 --> 00:42:37.848]  I mean... And now... You can put these things together, you know what I'm saying?
[00:42:38.468 --> 00:42:39.868]  Hell, I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:40.509]  Good points.
[00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:46.590]  Well, I mean, these people openly talk about how they want to get rid of us and then they own the companies that make the stuff that does it.
[00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.831]  I mean, it's not... Two plus two, folks, what does it equal?
[00:42:50.311 --> 00:42:54.492]  Two... I'm talking to those that are listening for the first time that are in total denial.
[00:42:54.853 --> 00:42:56.413]  What does two and two equal?
[00:42:58.346 --> 00:43:01.208]  Freedom is the freedom to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:43:01.369 --> 00:43:02.109]  I agree with that.
[00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.631]  I agree with what Eric Meyers said.
[00:43:05.392 --> 00:43:07.173]  With what, uh, you know, with George Orwell.
[00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:07.574]  It's true.
[00:43:08.114 --> 00:43:20.764]  Freedom is the ability, not just the freedom, not just the capability, but the ability for you, I'm not being condescending, to go 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:28.202]  Because a lot of people can't do that today.
[00:43:28.962 --> 00:43:30.423]  And by the way, I'm not saying you're stupid.
[00:43:30.623 --> 00:43:34.084]  Double-think and double-speak is something that the outer party does.
[00:43:34.104 --> 00:43:38.966]  You know, the minions of the elite, the people that control the mechanisms of power.
[00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:47.650]  You don't want to face the horror of what's going on, so you make little excuses and you deny what's happening around you.
[00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:51.932]  I know people who listen to this broadcast who are friends of mine.
[00:43:52.272 --> 00:43:56.174]  They still drink Diet Coke, which has wood alcohol in it.
[00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:00.404]  I mean, aspartame, I don't want to get off into it, but it's really bad.
[00:44:01.564 --> 00:44:02.445]  Sodium fluoride.
[00:44:02.585 --> 00:44:04.987]  Thousands of university studies of how deadly it is.
[00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:06.808]  How that Nobel laureate's on.
[00:44:06.888 --> 00:44:09.029]  People that promoted fluoridation have now turned against it.
[00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.610]  It's deadly.
[00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:12.592]  You go away with it.
[00:44:12.612 --> 00:44:13.753]  Fluoride's naturally occurring.
[00:44:14.253 --> 00:44:15.394]  Calcium fluoride.
[00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:17.575]  Not the different other types of fluoride.
[00:44:18.616 --> 00:44:22.799]  It's just... What am I supposed to do here?
[00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:25.961]  I mean, how am I supposed to explain this any more simply?
[00:44:26.949 --> 00:44:32.613]  I mean, they knew Prozac tripled your chance to commit suicide back in 83 when they authorized it.
[00:44:33.454 --> 00:44:43.581]  They know that Ritalin causes brain shrinkage and heart palpitations and retards growth and quadruples your chances of using amphetamines later in life.
[00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:45.262]  I mean, speed kills.
[00:44:45.322 --> 00:44:46.163]  It's the same thing.
[00:44:46.623 --> 00:44:49.985]  I don't know how we're supposed to explain this to people.
[00:44:52.407 --> 00:44:52.687]  You know what?
[00:44:52.707 --> 00:44:56.430]  I'm going to go to Jason and Casey and Tyler
[00:44:57.552 --> 00:45:02.736]  and others here in just a few minutes, but before this hour ends, I gotta get to this.
[00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:04.718]  I want to talk about this with you.
[00:45:05.879 --> 00:45:08.821]  This is out of the mainstream newspaper, the Memphis Flyer.
[00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:20.951]  Memphis, brainstorming exclusive, did a federal agent ban anti-bush signs in downtown storefronts.
[00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:23.613]  A little editorial written by
[00:45:24.324 --> 00:45:28.210]  Chris Davis, and we've got the storefront owner coming on.
[00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:38.605]  The man who called was very polite and nice, says John Gesquette, owner of Empire Coffee at 2 North Main in downtown Memphis.
[00:45:39.167 --> 00:45:41.289]  He said he was a special agent, something or other.
[00:45:41.629 --> 00:45:57.262]  He said that due to the fact that in some states the President had been to, there were issues of security regarding area businesses, he was calling businesses to tell them not to put up any negative signs in their windows that were negative towards President Bush.
[00:45:57.742 --> 00:46:03.527]  He said that there were designated areas of protest and this would cut down on the possibility of problems.
[00:46:03.567 --> 00:46:06.770]  And before you make mental excuses for this, they'll allow
[00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.842]  You know, in Virginia, or Texas, or wherever, there have been all these cases.
[00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:12.822]  We've had every single one of them all, and this happens.
[00:46:13.342 --> 00:46:17.903]  They'll have two hundred, a thousand, five hundred, depending on what case.
[00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:28.725]  Crowbush people in spontaneous demonstrations, you know, at the local talk station, there as he drives into whatever amphitheater he's going to be speaking at, or whatever factory.
[00:46:30.065 --> 00:46:32.085]  And they're all A-OK, standing on the sidewalk.
[00:46:33.345 --> 00:46:37.266]  One person, or in some cases, five people, will have anti-Bush signs.
[00:46:37.907 --> 00:46:41.150]  Secret Service walks over and says, you've got to leave the area.
[00:46:41.691 --> 00:46:43.072]  No protesting allowed.
[00:46:43.112 --> 00:46:45.234]  There's a baseball field a mile away you can go to.
[00:46:46.235 --> 00:46:47.156]  Go with these officers.
[00:46:47.576 --> 00:46:51.740]  And if they say, no, I have a right, they are instantly arrested.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.364]  And some of them are serving two years, a year in prison, six months in prison.
[00:46:55.384 --> 00:46:57.646]  I mean, they're, and then the judges are giving them prison time.
[00:46:59.368 --> 00:46:59.768]  All right?
[00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:01.490]  Now,
[00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:04.980]  I experienced this in New York.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.400]  It didn't matter where I was.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.201]  I could be in lower Manhattan.
[00:47:08.361 --> 00:47:12.503]  I mean, on the ocean, on the river.
[00:47:13.784 --> 00:47:17.065]  I could be in a park interviewing somebody with a statue behind me.
[00:47:17.185 --> 00:47:20.447]  I could be, it didn't matter, Wall Street.
[00:47:20.627 --> 00:47:22.528]  I could be outside the convention.
[00:47:22.608 --> 00:47:25.769]  I could be in the convention with the press passes.
[00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:30.111]  You'll see the interviews very commonly talking to people in the film.
[00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:32.172]  And the cops just come over
[00:47:32.924 --> 00:47:34.185]  And go, let me see those passes.
[00:47:34.225 --> 00:47:40.250]  Now, these were congressional passes that could get me to the podium where George Bush was speaking.
[00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:46.774]  If I wanted to, I could have gone right down to the floor and walked right down, you know, to the podium.
[00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:48.476]  You know, to right below it.
[00:47:48.716 --> 00:47:49.817]  Within 10 feet, 20 feet.
[00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:51.998]  But it didn't matter.
[00:47:52.679 --> 00:47:54.400]  I saw them arresting reporters.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.022]  I mean, AP reporters, America's Spectator reporters.
[00:47:57.242 --> 00:47:59.524]  They did people in suits, tourists.
[00:47:59.584 --> 00:48:00.745]  They would just randomly
[00:48:01.727 --> 00:48:03.087]  He'd have an authorized protest.
[00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:05.268]  They would just randomly arrest people.
[00:48:06.868 --> 00:48:11.009]  And I would, um, you know, just talk to them and be nice sometimes.
[00:48:11.049 --> 00:48:13.490]  Other times I had to get in their face and go, man, this is America, First Amendment.
[00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.931]  I'm going to sue you personally, when they took a handcuff shot.
[00:48:16.171 --> 00:48:17.511]  And I looked at them, I said, guaranteed.
[00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:20.052]  You can beat the rep, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:48:20.852 --> 00:48:22.372]  And by that, you want to be in court with me?
[00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:24.093]  You want, okay, come on, come on, take me to jail.
[00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:24.493]  Let's do it.
[00:48:24.853 --> 00:48:25.733]  I'm going to sue you.
[00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:31.702]  So, I mean, I made it out of there.
[00:48:32.202 --> 00:48:36.124]  Because of, uh... I don't know, what do they call it, bravado?
[00:48:37.424 --> 00:48:41.446]  Or what's a better word, uh... Bootspa?
[00:48:42.346 --> 00:48:43.167]  No, that's not the right word.
[00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:44.087]  What's the one I'm looking for?
[00:48:44.147 --> 00:48:45.148]  Macho, I guess.
[00:48:45.168 --> 00:48:45.488]  I don't know.
[00:48:46.288 --> 00:48:48.869]  But the point is, is they were going crazy!
[00:48:48.889 --> 00:48:49.549]  They were hateful!
[00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.390]  They were in our face!
[00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:53.271]  Screaming at us!
[00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:54.892]  And I just finally got sick of it.
[00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:57.573]  You'll watch the film on nice the first few times, and finally I'm just like, hey!
[00:48:58.365 --> 00:48:58.906]  Leave me alone!
[00:48:58.946 --> 00:48:59.866]  Hey, buddy!
[00:49:01.928 --> 00:49:04.170]  But, uh, this article continues.
[00:49:05.631 --> 00:49:08.994]  Imagine calling them and going, you can have your pro-Bush sign, there's no anti-Bush signs.
[00:49:09.234 --> 00:49:09.875]  They were specific.
[00:49:10.355 --> 00:49:24.387]  Gasquet didn't have any negative signs in his window, and he hadn't been planning on posting any signs at all as a businessman about to pass his business off to new owners that didn't seem logical to post material that might antagonize half his clientele.
[00:49:25.328 --> 00:49:26.729]  I thought, sure, okay, fine.
[00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:29.041]  But then it started to irritate me.
[00:49:29.181 --> 00:49:29.862]  I'm a veteran.
[00:49:29.942 --> 00:49:31.982]  I've served my country, he told the newspaper.
[00:49:32.802 --> 00:49:44.385]  I was happy to do it, and I would do it again, and it bugged me that someone from the federal government would try to tell me not to do this.
[00:49:46.546 --> 00:49:47.626]  And Gaskin understood it.
[00:49:47.666 --> 00:49:52.067]  His job as a soldier had been to defend the Constitution, not a pet
[00:49:52.774 --> 00:49:55.096]  policy of this or any other administration.
[00:49:55.516 --> 00:49:57.998]  But his estimation, the First Amendment was under attack.
[00:49:58.038 --> 00:50:04.924]  He warned and wanted to make and post a sign that showed respect for the office of President, but still got the message across.
[00:50:05.384 --> 00:50:15.092]  The sign, Gasquet, posted notified customers that the Empire had been contacted by a federal agent and told not to display an anti-Bush signage.
[00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:20.058]  In smaller letters it said, we would like to remind the agent of our First Amendment rights.
[00:50:20.198 --> 00:50:21.219]  God bless you!
[00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:26.125]  That's the kind of signs we need, not mindless left-right signs that do nothing but balkanize.
[00:50:26.626 --> 00:50:31.772]  No action was taken against Empire Coffee for displaying the sign, and the authenticity of the caller is still in question.
[00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:32.493]  It goes on and on.
[00:50:33.419 --> 00:50:40.124]  Customers who saw Gas Switch Science started telling him that other businesses in the area had been contacted and given similar instructions.
[00:50:40.324 --> 00:50:42.365]  Well, I've got mainstream news articles.
[00:50:42.766 --> 00:50:45.988]  This reporter could have typed it in and found it in a dozen other cities.
[00:50:46.468 --> 00:50:47.009]  Submit it!
[00:50:47.709 --> 00:50:49.410]  These reporters do not know how to use Google.
[00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:50.971]  I'm going to have to get this guy on at schooling.
[00:50:51.432 --> 00:50:52.893]  But the other businesses said they were called, too.
[00:50:53.813 --> 00:50:58.597]  Alright, we'll be right back with this, but this is your new freedom, folks.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.662]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:10.264]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.424 --> 00:51:14.806]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.826 --> 00:51:16.207]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.987 --> 00:51:17.828]  Panama!
[00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:22.211]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:29.215]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.316 --> 00:51:31.397]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.557 --> 00:51:42.264]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.344 --> 00:51:44.886]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my

[00:54:06.997 --> 00:54:17.182]  So, Secret Service agents and others can arrest protesters for peacefully standing there, so they can call you up and say take that sign down.
[00:54:17.863 --> 00:54:26.907]  Bush in Indiana, they ordered everybody to take, this is a real story, happened what, two years ago now, take all their ties off.
[00:54:27.067 --> 00:54:32.290]  Some people refused and so they threatened to arrest them because they wanted the image of common folks.
[00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:34.611]  Remember the, right around the same time in St.
[00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:36.432]  Louis, they had all the signs
[00:54:37.751 --> 00:54:45.115]  That, uh, that just said, Made in America on the boxes, and it turned out that had been spray painted on and stenciled, and the Made in China had all been covered up.
[00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:50.479]  Which, by the way, is a federal crime to do that in a warehouse, but... It's just, it's staged, is the point.
[00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:53.401]  Oh, I told you I'd tell a show about the Queen of England 30 minutes ago.
[00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:53.921]  I never did.
[00:54:54.761 --> 00:54:56.342]  Yeah, uh, she went to Nigeria.
[00:54:57.263 --> 00:54:59.124]  This was about three years ago, BBC.
[00:54:59.484 --> 00:55:00.625]  We spent a lot of time on this.
[00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:05.108]  She went to Nigeria, and was, quote, out helping the young children in a village.
[00:55:05.808 --> 00:55:07.249]  But they did it on a set.
[00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:14.756]  An outdoor set for a local soap opera that's real popular in Nigeria.
[00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.417]  Nigeria has 290 million people.
[00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:17.298]  It's as big as America.
[00:55:17.958 --> 00:55:19.760]  I mean, as many people, not geographically as big.
[00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:23.984]  But, again, that's how staged it is, people.
[00:55:24.564 --> 00:55:25.545]  They think nothing of you.
[00:55:26.386 --> 00:55:27.326]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:55:29.348 --> 00:55:35.193]  I just want to remind folks that my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:37.792]  It is my best work, bar none.

[00:55:39.112 --> 00:55:40.152]  Covers the police state.
[00:55:40.732 --> 00:55:43.153]  Covers 9-11 like no other film out there.
[00:55:43.493 --> 00:55:48.875]  And gets into the elite and Skull and Bones and Arnold and the Bush-Nazi connection and the Arnold-Nazi connection.
[00:55:48.935 --> 00:55:50.095]  It just covers it all.
[00:55:50.895 --> 00:55:52.436]  You need to get this 2-hour, 35-minute film.

[00:56:29.063 --> 00:56:30.644]  At 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.892]  All right, Jason and Casey, Tyler and others.
[00:56:53.192 --> 00:56:53.952]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:56:54.493 --> 00:56:57.614]  Yeah, I had a quick comment.
[00:56:58.195 --> 00:57:06.180]  Actually, I want to make two quick points, but I wanted to ask you, and this would go along the lines of things hidden in plain view, as you would say.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.162]  Have you seen this month's issue of Reader's Digest?
[00:57:09.942 --> 00:57:10.923]  No, I haven't.
[00:57:12.023 --> 00:57:17.827]  It's a story about the JFK technology, about a new technology to come out to listen to the old Dig the Belt.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.843]  Uh, recordings from the motorcade.
[00:57:22.644 --> 00:57:23.745]  Microphone that was left open.
[00:57:24.365 --> 00:57:31.852]  But an interesting picture on, uh, on the page that begins is a picture of, uh, the assassination.
[00:57:32.673 --> 00:57:35.856]  And Kennedy slumped over, uh, Jacqueline Kennedy there.
[00:57:36.397 --> 00:57:44.084]  But the photograph was taken, uh, opposite side of the Grassy Knoll with both their backs to the camera.
[00:57:45.183 --> 00:57:52.910]  And to my understanding that nobody had got the assassination on film, whether it be still camera or movie film, other than Zapruder.
[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:53.791]  Am I right about that?
[00:57:54.631 --> 00:57:54.892]  No.
[00:57:55.452 --> 00:57:57.133]  Well, not the actual assassination.
[00:57:57.153 --> 00:57:57.514]  You're right.
[00:57:57.534 --> 00:58:02.538]  There were a bunch of other cameras that got it right before, according to my knowledge.
[00:58:02.658 --> 00:58:03.279]  I may be wrong.
[00:58:03.499 --> 00:58:08.423]  But this, according to this picture in Reader's Digest, it was taken during the assassination.
[00:58:09.224 --> 00:58:11.686]  So I called Reader's Digest to find out, and
[00:58:13.371 --> 00:58:20.556]  I got the runaround, but I was able to speak to one person who, his words were, oh boy, I think somebody screwed up.
[00:58:22.537 --> 00:58:24.578]  Oh boy, I think, yeah, I bet they did.
[00:58:24.958 --> 00:58:27.520]  Yeah, so I want to make another quick point if I wanted to.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:28.141]  Sure.
[00:58:28.161 --> 00:58:29.181]  Okay, I'll hold over.
[00:58:29.221 --> 00:58:31.363]  Well, go ahead and start making it.
[00:58:35.911 --> 00:58:38.713]  Eyewitness testimonies about 9-11, about the first plane hitting.
[00:58:39.473 --> 00:58:40.274]  Yeah.
[00:58:40.314 --> 00:58:43.616]  Found a little Fox broadcast from that day.
[00:58:44.096 --> 00:58:45.797]  Watch eyewitnesses corroborating that.
[00:58:46.017 --> 00:58:47.518]  Tell us about it when we get back.
[00:58:47.578 --> 00:58:49.520]  Second hour, 70 seconds away.
[00:58:51.321 --> 00:58:58.145]  Introducing... Big Brother.
[00:58:58.872 --> 00:58:59.932]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.632 --> 00:59:01.733]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.393 --> 00:59:03.233]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:04.854]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:09.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.715 --> 00:59:13.836]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.856 --> 00:59:25.759]  First they tell you you have no right to not have your car searched.
[00:59:26.921 --> 00:59:30.484]  Then they tell you you have no right to not have your home searched without a warrant.
[00:59:31.285 --> 00:59:36.550]  First they tell you you can't protest on a sidewalk, but you can worship government if you want.
[00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:38.612]  Then it's you can't have it in your business.
[00:59:39.252 --> 00:59:40.433]  Can't have a sign in your business.
[00:59:40.453 --> 00:59:41.955]  That's what we were talking about in the last hour.
[00:59:42.415 --> 00:59:44.577]  Also, has there been a new anthrax attack?
[00:59:44.997 --> 00:59:46.218]  This is from the Associated Press.
[00:59:46.238 --> 00:59:46.899]  That's coming up.
[00:59:48.271 --> 00:59:48.931]  A lot more.
[00:59:48.971 --> 00:59:59.556]  We've got a guest coming on who got the call to take the, never put a sign up, but just letting all the different businesses know, hey, you're not allowed to have signs against the president up in your business when he drives through your town.
[00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:01.737]  Because, you know, they don't want the photo ops to look bad.
[01:00:01.777 --> 01:00:02.657]  It's got to have that image.
[01:00:03.738 --> 01:00:07.459]  I was talking to my mom last night, and she was watching my new film, Martial Law.
[01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:11.301]  I was over at her house for about 30 minutes, and she said, son, I never saw this on the news.
[01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.362]  She watches a lot of news.
[01:00:12.402 --> 01:00:15.323]  She's a news junkie when she's cooking dinner and stuff like that.
[01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.347]  You see, I never saw all these protests.
[01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:20.027]  I never saw those hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:00:20.327 --> 01:00:21.468]  Gee, that's the control.
[01:00:21.828 --> 01:00:23.868]  But, Steve, it's going to show the President driving up somewhere.
[01:00:23.908 --> 01:00:26.729]  They have to show it, so they don't want protesters around.
[01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:28.530]  I mean, this was totally un-American.
[01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:31.611]  But we were talking to Jason, and we'll go to KC and others.
[01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:38.313]  Jason, you were talking about a tape you got from the morning of 9-11 from Fox News about witnesses.
[01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:39.013]  Tell us all about it.
[01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:45.316]  Yeah, I cued up the 10-second clip, if you want to hear it, for your listeners.
[01:00:45.596 --> 01:00:46.316]  Well, what did they say?
[01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:47.985]  I can play it.
[01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:48.666]  Is that alright?
[01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:49.506]  Yeah, but tell us first.
[01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:50.407]  What'd they say?
[01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:57.490]  She just said that a small jet had hit the First World Trade Center and the pieces fell.
[01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.272]  She said it was a small jet.
[01:01:00.392 --> 01:01:03.874]  It wasn't the big airliner as so reported.
[01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:08.536]  But you know, the French brothers and others got the video of the plane hitting.
[01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:09.337]  Right, right.
[01:01:09.397 --> 01:01:09.777]  Exactly.
[01:01:11.113 --> 01:01:16.458]  I mean, I don't get into, you know, that a passenger liner didn't hit the first tower.
[01:01:16.538 --> 01:01:21.462]  I mean, the big gaping hole in it, you can see that it was a large aircraft.
[01:01:21.502 --> 01:01:24.644]  I mean, a lot of witnesses, a lot of times, get stuff wrong.
[01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:36.214]  Right, and the bright flash before the plane hit, I had somebody who was a tenured veteran of the military look at that tape yesterday, and she said it looked like a white phosphorus detonator used
[01:01:37.332 --> 01:01:41.015]  There's definitely a white flash, but I'm not disputing that.
[01:01:41.135 --> 01:01:41.635]  Right, right.
[01:01:41.655 --> 01:01:43.556]  But go ahead and play the clip if you want.
[01:01:43.776 --> 01:01:44.437]  Okay, thank you.
[01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:45.658]  Sure.
[01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:46.878]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[01:01:46.918 --> 01:01:50.381]  You've got that video clip on the website.
[01:01:50.461 --> 01:01:55.024]  I wasn't sure, but I just find it interesting because I found a bunch of stuff.
[01:02:05.592 --> 01:02:09.654]  That I taped from that day, and it's just going over.
[01:02:09.835 --> 01:02:10.655]  But thanks for your time.
[01:02:10.735 --> 01:02:11.195]  You bet.
[01:02:11.415 --> 01:02:11.716]  You bet.
[01:02:11.856 --> 01:02:15.478]  Yeah, because the towers are so big, I can see how the jet looks small.
[01:02:16.298 --> 01:02:18.520]  It wasn't a jumbo jet.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.700]  It wasn't even a full-size.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.862]  It was what they call a medium carrier.
[01:02:21.962 --> 01:02:22.742]  Both the points were.
[01:02:23.943 --> 01:02:28.606]  But let's go ahead and talk to KC in Missouri.
[01:02:28.646 --> 01:02:29.406]  KC, go ahead.
[01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.247]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:30.607 --> 01:02:30.907]  Hello.
[01:02:31.627 --> 01:02:32.308]  I was calling.
[01:02:33.126 --> 01:02:38.851]  My little girl brought home a piece of paper from her school, from the American Red Cross.
[01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:52.362]  And it says, I give to the American Red Cross, its nominees, agents, and assigns unlimited permission to use, publish, and republish for purposes of advertising, trade, or any other lawful use.
[01:02:53.183 --> 01:02:55.685]  Information about me and reproduction of my likeness,
[01:02:56.263 --> 01:03:02.186]  Photograph or otherwise, my voice, whether or not related to any... Yeah, she must have been in a school photo-op.
[01:03:02.226 --> 01:03:05.448]  That's a standard, uh, permission slip for this.
[01:03:05.769 --> 01:03:06.009]  Yeah.
[01:03:06.609 --> 01:03:09.491]  So even with, I mean, the American Red Cross... Well, what was she in?
[01:03:10.271 --> 01:03:12.532]  She was, she's just, she was in nothing.
[01:03:12.592 --> 01:03:15.394]  This was just for the Red Cross to come to her school.
[01:03:17.055 --> 01:03:18.896]  Well, that means they're going to bring the media with them.
[01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:21.758]  They're planning to do some type of photo-op, and I'd say no.
[01:03:22.218 --> 01:03:22.518]  Yeah, I did.
[01:03:22.558 --> 01:03:24.459]  The Red Cross is an evil organization.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:25.360]  I did.
[01:03:25.879 --> 01:03:29.500]  But it says, uh, her photograph or otherwise and her voice.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.861]  Whether or not related to any affiliation with the American Red Cross.
[01:03:32.901 --> 01:03:33.161]  No, stay there.
[01:03:33.281 --> 01:03:34.321]  I don't want to shortchange you.
[01:03:34.681 --> 01:03:38.462]  And I don't want to make that claim that the Red Cross is bad without backing it up.
[01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.883]  It's always good to expose these criminals.
[01:03:40.903 --> 01:03:42.643]  We'll do that when we get back on the other side.
[01:03:43.343 --> 01:03:44.163]  Oh yeah, they're criminals.
[01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:45.264]  They've been convicted.
[01:03:45.744 --> 01:03:46.404]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:59.873]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.173 --> 01:04:01.553]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:03.974]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:06.195]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:11.397]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.737 --> 01:04:15.759]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.800]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:28.525]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.566]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.907]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:04:33.087 --> 01:04:34.648]  And man the guns in the Info War.
[01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:36.008]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:42.053]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:46.838]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:47.098 --> 01:04:47.799]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.047 --> 01:04:56.071]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:56.411 --> 01:05:05.241]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:05.561 --> 01:05:10.227]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:10.687 --> 01:05:17.409]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:29.593]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:34.536]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:34.696 --> 01:05:37.158]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:37.178 --> 01:05:39.019]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:40.220]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.760]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.781]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:55.519]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.121]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:05.464]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:06:05.664 --> 01:06:11.047]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:06:11.287 --> 01:06:15.949]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:18.730]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.071]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:06:20.271 --> 01:06:29.854]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.

[01:06:42.379 --> 01:06:42.799]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.895 --> 01:06:59.976]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.676 --> 01:07:01.776]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.437 --> 01:07:03.257]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.018 --> 01:07:04.878]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.898 --> 01:07:09.440]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.424 --> 01:07:23.087]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now one hour, eight minutes, thirty seconds into this broadcast.
[01:07:23.107 --> 01:07:26.828]  It's eight minutes after the hour, into the second segment.
[01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:27.849]  Thank you so much
[01:07:28.496 --> 01:07:29.177]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:30.978 --> 01:07:36.963]  We'll have continual open phones for the next 20 minutes and then after that, but we've got a guest coming on.
[01:07:37.043 --> 01:07:50.534]  The owner of the business Little Coffee Shop wasn't planning to put up an anti-Bush sign, but he got a call by somebody saying, I'm a federal agent, no signs up when the President drives through Main Street down to his speech in Memphis.
[01:07:52.606 --> 01:07:56.927]  And then he found out that other stores got the same call.
[01:07:57.148 --> 01:07:59.608]  And the agent, of course, wouldn't say who he was.
[01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:00.469]  That's what they do.
[01:08:01.129 --> 01:08:05.570]  They called up the owner of Puffer Belly Toys last year.
[01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:13.473]  This was in the Oregonian and several other major papers, including the Associated Press, the Newswire, and Reuters.
[01:08:13.513 --> 01:08:14.373]  We had her on the show.
[01:08:15.154 --> 01:08:19.297]  A little less than 2,000 square foot business in St.
[01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:20.838]  Helens, right by Mount St.
[01:08:20.858 --> 01:08:21.258]  Helens.
[01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:24.120]  She got a call from Seattle.
[01:08:25.321 --> 01:08:27.122]  Got a call from Homeland Security.
[01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:30.965]  And they said, we are Homeland Security.
[01:08:32.006 --> 01:08:35.188]  You will stop selling the Magic Cube.
[01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.830]  She said, what is your name?
[01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:39.811]  They said, we will not tell you.
[01:08:40.925 --> 01:08:41.686]  You gotta love that.
[01:08:41.766 --> 01:08:46.108]  No judge's order, no arrest, no nothing.
[01:08:46.208 --> 01:08:48.130]  Just you do it.
[01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.290]  Well, who are you?
[01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:51.632]  This is a terrorism matter.
[01:08:51.972 --> 01:08:52.753]  This was in the news.
[01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:55.054]  This is a terrorism matter.
[01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:57.996]  And so, that's the end of it.
[01:08:58.476 --> 01:08:59.517]  We'll be seeing you soon.
[01:09:00.898 --> 01:09:02.999]  A month and a half later, she made calls.
[01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:09.023]  A month and a half later, unannounced, on a Monday morning, two Homeland Security officers
[01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.507]  had driven over a hundred miles.
[01:09:11.627 --> 01:09:14.088]  They come walking in to St.
[01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:16.469]  Helena, the town of St.
[01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:21.892]  Helena, and they tell her, do you, where is the Magic Cubes?
[01:09:22.072 --> 01:09:23.893]  She had about seven of them on the shelf.
[01:09:24.013 --> 01:09:26.234]  Going from memory, it was like seven or eight.
[01:09:26.374 --> 01:09:27.995]  She said, is this illegal?
[01:09:28.035 --> 01:09:34.158]  And they said, well, there's a question of whether or not the patent is really up on the Rubik's Cube.
[01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.480]  She said, look, sir, these are sold all over the country.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.081]  By the way, I've since been in a toy store
[01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:41.485]  It's on the Toys R Us shelves.
[01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:44.807]  And then later, the AP did an investigation.
[01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:51.551]  They called the patent office, also the trademark office, and they said, of course, it's been up for two years.
[01:09:53.032 --> 01:09:53.933]  It's sold everywhere.
[01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.415]  These are like tests.
[01:09:56.475 --> 01:09:57.715]  They're setting precedents.
[01:09:57.755 --> 01:09:59.156]  They go pick someone who's weak.
[01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:02.558]  They don't go to Toys R Us or any of these huge toy stores.
[01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:04.940]  They don't go to Target, who, by the way, has it.
[01:10:05.962 --> 01:10:06.682]  They don't do that.
[01:10:06.822 --> 01:10:16.405]  They go to Puffer Belly Toys, a tiny, tiny store in a town of, I don't know, 20,000 people.
[01:10:16.685 --> 01:10:18.865]  They go in and she started crying.
[01:10:20.606 --> 01:10:23.487]  And they said, and she said, how is this terrorism?
[01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:27.008]  And they said, all infrastructure protection is terrorism.
[01:10:27.028 --> 01:10:28.008]  She said, well there's no order.
[01:10:28.468 --> 01:10:31.509]  And they said, take them down or we're going to arrest you.
[01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:32.129]  And they left.
[01:10:33.593 --> 01:10:33.973]  You know what?
[01:10:34.213 --> 01:10:34.934]  She called the media.
[01:10:34.974 --> 01:10:35.614]  They checked it out.
[01:10:35.835 --> 01:10:36.615]  She called the companies.
[01:10:36.675 --> 01:10:40.918]  No, there's no... This is insane, but it's not.
[01:10:41.098 --> 01:10:45.301]  On the surface, it's insane, but it's about setting precedence.
[01:10:46.562 --> 01:10:48.283]  It's about control.
[01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:52.646]  You know, why do they send Homeland Security after Topple's parts?
[01:10:53.546 --> 01:11:01.371]  Not over the Topple's dancers, but over... Did they pay off a county commissioner in Las Vegas to zone them for 10 more parking spaces?
[01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:02.352]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:11:03.283 --> 01:11:10.345]  Did the Topless Bar give $4,000 to the campaign of the County Commissioner to zone for them?
[01:11:10.685 --> 01:11:11.586]  And that's corrupt.
[01:11:11.686 --> 01:11:13.766]  That's good ol' boy, old-fashioned stuff.
[01:11:14.967 --> 01:11:16.007]  I mean, that is nothing.
[01:11:16.507 --> 01:11:18.888]  This is the very government stealing trillions from the Pentagon.
[01:11:19.288 --> 01:11:21.229]  And they said, well, it's infrastructure protection.
[01:11:23.289 --> 01:11:27.070]  Case after case after case after case after case.
[01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:28.811]  There are hundreds of these.
[01:11:28.911 --> 01:11:30.932]  We've had dozens of these individuals on.
[01:11:30.952 --> 01:11:31.772]  This has happened to them.
[01:11:33.929 --> 01:11:35.270]  Everything is terrorism.
[01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:39.233]  Write a story about zombies busting out of the ground attacking a fictitious school.
[01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:40.994]  You go to jail, charged as a terrorist.
[01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.738]  Kelly Rushing, no criminal record, upstanding in the community.
[01:11:46.818 --> 01:11:48.439]  Frankly, I didn't believe the story when I heard it.
[01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:49.519]  We'll go to your calls in a minute.
[01:11:51.461 --> 01:11:56.544]  Last year, early last year, my fax machine, in comes a news article.
[01:11:56.864 --> 01:12:00.066]  I even had the local major Lyon County newspaper.
[01:12:00.527 --> 01:12:00.867]  Says,
[01:12:01.607 --> 01:12:04.408]  Kelly Rushing arrested for giving police officer a video tape.
[01:12:04.728 --> 01:12:06.368]  Police officer calls it terrorism.
[01:12:07.928 --> 01:12:10.549]  And I talked to Kelly Rushing and I thought, man, there's got to be more.
[01:12:10.569 --> 01:12:13.770]  The guy sounds like a really nice person, but this is just too much.
[01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.770]  So I called the judge at home.
[01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:17.831]  It was a Saturday.
[01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.171]  And he seemed like a nice fella.
[01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:23.572]  And I said, is this guy really in your court?
[01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:25.592]  Are you really going to have a trial with this?
[01:12:25.652 --> 01:12:26.252]  Yes, I am.
[01:12:27.493 --> 01:12:28.913]  The state police have complained.
[01:12:30.356 --> 01:12:32.758]  And I get Kelly on and Kelly tells the story.
[01:12:32.798 --> 01:12:34.839]  Later I got the court transcripts Kelly sent to me.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.220]  Everything he said was true.
[01:12:38.201 --> 01:12:51.349]  He had met the state police officer before, was driving to work, stopped, left the tape there on his doorstep, and
[01:12:53.024 --> 01:13:08.074]  Then, a couple days later, by the way, it was a double tape, you know, in the slow play speed, it was Ron Paul giving his Neocon speech for 45 minutes, laying out how the Neocons are really Trotskyites from their own documents, and how Bush is selling the country out.
[01:13:09.415 --> 01:13:10.196]  And it was my video!
[01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:16.280]  And they charged him with terrorism, this was in the newspaper, for both the videos.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.422]  Now, a congressman, a Vietnam veteran,
[01:13:20.515 --> 01:13:24.437]  The most conservative voting record in modern history in the House of Representatives.
[01:13:25.257 --> 01:13:34.162]  That video upset him too, and when he got him in the back of the car, put him in the cuffs real tight, he called his wife on the cell phone, the cop did, and said, I've got the video tape bandit.
[01:13:35.122 --> 01:13:41.045]  Now imagine to that officer how little Kelly's life meant to that officer.
[01:13:41.065 --> 01:13:42.146]  It was going to ruin his life.
[01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:46.888]  He was facing three years in prison because of the two counts of terroristic threats.
[01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:49.169]  Each video would be a year and a half in jail.
[01:13:50.481 --> 01:13:51.701]  Three years in prison.
[01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:54.562]  Two year and a half sentences consecutively.
[01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:55.763]  And a record.
[01:13:57.463 --> 01:13:59.744]  And the officer got up on stand and admitted.
[01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.525]  He didn't say anything to him.
[01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.646]  He said in the car, don't you care?
[01:14:04.746 --> 01:14:06.547]  Don't you care about the freedom in this country?
[01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:07.847]  Don't you care about your children's future?
[01:14:08.207 --> 01:14:09.788]  Then they tried to add that as another charge.
[01:14:09.968 --> 01:14:10.548]  And they admitted.
[01:14:10.628 --> 01:14:11.808]  It was a squad car video.
[01:14:12.349 --> 01:14:14.810]  Which they didn't want Kelly to be able to introduce, but Kelly fought it.
[01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:18.771]  The jury got a chance to see it, so he was found not guilty.
[01:14:22.044 --> 01:14:25.606]  So they got him in the car and arrested him for the videos, and then they wanted to trump something up.
[01:14:25.946 --> 01:14:27.607]  So he said, well, don't you care about the country?
[01:14:27.627 --> 01:14:29.068]  Don't you care about your children's future?
[01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:30.829]  Oh, that's another threat!
[01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:31.730]  That's another threat!
[01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:32.830]  You threatened me again!
[01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:43.516]  I mean, imagine how crazy that cop was, that he wanted to ruin a local business owner's life, families big in the county, good, upstanding, church-going people.
[01:14:43.776 --> 01:14:48.199]  And I randomly called people in Lyon, Kentucky.
[01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.991]  Uh, do you know Kelly Rushing?
[01:14:52.131 --> 01:14:53.472]  Oh yeah, I know Kelly!
[01:14:53.852 --> 01:14:55.013]  He's a good old boy.
[01:14:55.133 --> 01:14:56.233]  I go to church with him.
[01:14:56.253 --> 01:14:58.295]  Man, he's a really nice fella.
[01:14:58.335 --> 01:15:04.058]  He's really known for giving you a great job and if you hire him for construction work.
[01:15:05.019 --> 01:15:06.600]  He is just, Kelly, such good.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.680]  Why, who is this?
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:08.421]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:15:08.441 --> 01:15:09.501]  Did you hear about him getting arrested?
[01:15:10.442 --> 01:15:11.142]  No, I didn't.
[01:15:11.303 --> 01:15:11.983]  Call another person.
[01:15:12.783 --> 01:15:13.844]  Oh, he's just wonderful.
[01:15:13.864 --> 01:15:14.905]  That's my cousin.
[01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:16.166]  Oh, really?
[01:15:16.206 --> 01:15:17.286]  Did you hear about him getting arrested?
[01:15:17.386 --> 01:15:18.027]  I did!
[01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:21.886]  Man, I just don't know what's going on!
[01:15:23.287 --> 01:15:34.851]  Well, then Kelly had the just pathetic niceness to go up to the state police officer after the trial, and he's found not guilty, and say, I'm really sorry about all this trouble.
[01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.332]  I just wanted to give you information.
[01:15:36.712 --> 01:15:38.173]  And the cop kind of got up in his face.
[01:15:38.573 --> 01:15:42.414]  And then they started pulling Kelly over and being mean to him and arresting his friend.
[01:15:43.975 --> 01:15:45.616]  What is wrong with you people?
[01:15:45.756 --> 01:15:46.836]  What planet?
[01:15:47.216 --> 01:15:48.637]  I mean, Russia was this bad.
[01:15:50.071 --> 01:15:51.651]  But they think it's normal!
[01:15:53.372 --> 01:15:58.432]  And then the cop gets up on the stand and says, well that's just an anti-government, anti-police video!
[01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:02.413]  On the stand saying he doesn't like it because it's anti-government.
[01:16:03.253 --> 01:16:05.494]  I mean, look, they'd arrest Ron Paul if they could, folks.
[01:16:05.554 --> 01:16:07.774]  Don't think this, you know, they're afraid of us.
[01:16:07.794 --> 01:16:09.935]  See, they go after the Puffer Belly Toys.
[01:16:10.555 --> 01:16:14.895]  They go after the, the, the Little Kelly Russian.
[01:16:15.455 --> 01:16:17.496]  Never hurt anybody in his life.
[01:16:17.516 --> 01:16:18.136]  50-year-old man.
[01:16:20.848 --> 01:16:35.313]  Remember the guy in Tennessee, Adam Onn, this was in the mainstream news, put the sign up saying our judicial system is a joke because he didn't like what happened in his divorce case.
[01:16:35.913 --> 01:16:40.155]  Upstanding member, you know, that kind of a blue chip level in a small town.
[01:16:41.075 --> 01:16:42.095]  Owned a lumber business.
[01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:44.956]  No criminal record.
[01:16:45.016 --> 01:16:49.738]  He was mad because he said that his wife was on drugs and she shouldn't have gotten the custody of the children.
[01:16:52.682 --> 01:16:59.084]  Put up a sign, didn't even name the judge, just said our judicial system is a joke, and the judge got up in the newspaper and said, I'm ordering that man arrested!
[01:16:59.744 --> 01:17:01.945]  He shouldn't be able to say that, that's disrespectful!
[01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:07.026]  They came to his house, pulled his sign up, took him to jail!
[01:17:09.967 --> 01:17:12.128]  A year after the case, didn't even mention the judge's name.
[01:17:12.788 --> 01:17:16.409]  These people are power drunk, power mad!
[01:17:17.789 --> 01:17:19.310]  Now digressing, we were talking to
[01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:31.950]  Let me just comment on this for the next minute.
[01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:33.832]  We'll come back and let you finish the next segment.
[01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:41.199]  He brought up in that first little five minute segment of the hour that a lot of stations don't carry, they carry news, he brought up his daughter.
[01:17:42.108 --> 01:17:45.251]  Up in Missouri, and she brought home the basic form.
[01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:51.476]  You know, when I get interviewed by 20-20 or something, they have me sign a form saying they can use my likeness and use the piece.
[01:17:53.438 --> 01:17:56.560]  And his daughter came home with this because the Red Cross is coming to the school.
[01:17:58.362 --> 01:17:59.543]  And he said, no, you can't do that.
[01:17:59.563 --> 01:18:00.063]  And that's good.
[01:18:00.644 --> 01:18:03.046]  Why did I call the Red Cross a criminal organization?
[01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:15.593]  Well, after the Oklahoma City bombing, the week after, people were getting $10,000 checks, and what they'd be seeing on the news, victims and their families, from citizens that saw them and saw their names.
[01:18:16.414 --> 01:18:18.916]  The Red Cross said, oh, let us take control of all that mail.
[01:18:18.956 --> 01:18:20.257]  We'll help you get to the right people.
[01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:25.420]  They forged the checks, forged the signatures, and got millions of dollars.
[01:18:25.841 --> 01:18:26.741]  None of it got to the people.
[01:18:27.982 --> 01:18:28.603]  They stole it.
[01:18:29.463 --> 01:18:31.885]  They lost a multi-million dollar lawsuit, several of them over.
[01:18:31.905 --> 01:18:32.946]  It was three different lawsuits.
[01:18:34.898 --> 01:18:36.779]  But the Red Cross is a lot worse than that.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.661]  They're involved in a lot more dirt than that.
[01:18:39.321 --> 01:18:42.864]  I told you on 9-11, don't give them money, they're going to steal it, and they got caught doing it, remember?
[01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.226]  This is what they do.
[01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:47.327]  They're an intelligence agency.
[01:18:48.368 --> 01:18:50.430]  That doesn't mean because you volunteered, you're bad.
[01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.851]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.297 --> 01:18:59.500]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:07.743]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.084 --> 01:19:15.927]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.247 --> 01:19:21.008]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.328 --> 01:19:26.030]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:30.411]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:31.932]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:31.992 --> 01:19:36.073]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:19:49.899 --> 01:19:55.382]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:56.003 --> 01:20:05.269]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:12.934]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.316]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:20:15.536 --> 01:20:18.618]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:20:19.579 --> 01:20:28.105]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:02.462 --> 01:21:13.706]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:14.046 --> 01:21:19.768]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:21.169]  Foul tastes like chlorine
[01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:21.629]  I think so.
[01:21:51.571 --> 01:21:52.631]  Are you losing your hair?
[01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:54.392]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[01:21:54.732 --> 01:21:55.872]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.073]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:02.934]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.

[01:22:08.795 --> 01:22:09.515]  It works.
[01:22:09.895 --> 01:22:12.436]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[01:22:13.932 --> 01:22:18.736]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?

[01:22:44.357 --> 01:22:48.799]  Between them, the Red Cross and United Way got over 3 billion dollars from 9-11.
[01:22:48.959 --> 01:22:56.863]  A very small portion of that went to the families of the victims.
[01:22:56.883 --> 01:23:00.225]  They finally got on TV and said, we're keeping it!
[01:23:13.157 --> 01:23:21.405]  Well, they advertised and promised that it was going to be going to the victims and to their families.
[01:23:22.866 --> 01:23:23.907]  This is how they operate.
[01:23:24.648 --> 01:23:27.591]  And every time something happens, they're on TV in your town getting money.
[01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:28.732]  It doesn't go to anybody.
[01:23:28.772 --> 01:23:31.054]  They might give you some clothes and put you in a hotel.
[01:23:31.114 --> 01:23:31.815]  It's a big business.
[01:23:32.376 --> 01:23:33.657]  The Red Cross started
[01:23:35.319 --> 01:23:36.660]  As an intelligence agency.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:41.823]  I'm sure you've heard that a lot of Red Cross agents are really CIA when they're overseas.
[01:23:42.043 --> 01:23:43.464]  A lot of reporters are.
[01:23:44.104 --> 01:23:45.224]  A lot of priests are.
[01:23:45.485 --> 01:23:59.152]  It's a perfect cover, but it was a Red Cross shipment that brought 25 million dollars to Lenin when he was about to lose to the White Russians, those that were loyal to the Tsar.
[01:23:59.172 --> 01:24:02.354]  And I've caught them giving money to gun control groups.
[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:09.975]  I mean, I already knew they did, but United Way and Red Cross put on that, you know, that telethon on cable, and a lot of the money went to gun control groups.
[01:24:10.236 --> 01:24:11.156]  Tens of millions?
[01:24:11.877 --> 01:24:13.078]  I mean, come on, folks!
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.042]  It didn't go for breathing apparatus for the firefighters and rescue workers.
[01:24:19.102 --> 01:24:19.943]  No, no, not that.
[01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:30.411]  Bush blocked the $96 million that would have gone to the firefighters and police and other rescue workers for even what the new scientist has reported on.
[01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:32.112]  They've done the scans of their lungs.
[01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:32.673]  They're full of it.
[01:24:34.796 --> 01:24:36.017]  Oh boy, alright, I'll shut up.
[01:24:36.637 --> 01:24:41.841]  Let's go back to... I was talking to KC in Missouri.
[01:24:42.121 --> 01:24:47.724]  So they want you to sign over rights to your daughter's likeness just because they're coming to your school?
[01:24:48.325 --> 01:24:49.946]  Yeah, her likeness and her voice.
[01:24:51.367 --> 01:24:56.430]  And anything else to... anyone affiliated or not affiliated with the Red Cross.
[01:24:57.423 --> 01:24:58.884]  Well, that might not just be for media.
[01:24:58.924 --> 01:25:03.346]  They might be doing what the Masons and others do, getting a face scan, getting a thumbprint, you name it.
[01:25:03.586 --> 01:25:06.808]  That's what I was wondering if it was, you know, just kind of another ID collection.
[01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:14.312]  Well, the Red Cross has also been used to go into the families who are talking about 9-11 and offer them a bunch of cash on behalf of the government to shut up.
[01:25:15.932 --> 01:25:17.513]  Yeah, it's a really bad organization.
[01:25:18.354 --> 01:25:19.454]  I'm glad I didn't sign it, though.
[01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.816]  If you want to give money to somebody, the Salvation Army's light years better.
[01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:23.576]  They're not perfect.
[01:25:24.217 --> 01:25:26.038]  Of course, you notice it's under attack because of that.
[01:25:28.177 --> 01:25:29.737]  Well, it's crazy.
[01:25:29.857 --> 01:25:31.298]  And United Way is even worse.
[01:25:33.839 --> 01:25:34.459]  Even worse.
[01:25:36.739 --> 01:25:38.540]  So what did the school say when you told them no?
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:40.880]  They haven't said anything yet.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:43.081]  They just, you know, just kind of look at you.
[01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:45.902]  Like you're crazy, standing up for your family.
[01:25:46.122 --> 01:25:47.042]  Yeah.
[01:25:47.062 --> 01:25:47.682]  Well, they're ours.
[01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:48.763]  Pardon me?
[01:25:49.163 --> 01:25:49.903]  No, they're our kids.
[01:25:49.923 --> 01:25:50.423]  They're not yours.
[01:25:51.463 --> 01:25:52.924]  Well, that's what Dr. Phil says.
[01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:53.564]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:54.084 --> 01:25:55.704]  And that's why he's on national TV, folks.
[01:25:55.765 --> 01:25:57.485]  He says the kids don't belong to the government.
[01:25:58.462 --> 01:26:01.503]  All righty then, and you can't have a sign in the front of your business either.
[01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:02.303]  It's freedom.
[01:26:03.123 --> 01:26:04.163]  Randy in Florida.
[01:26:04.203 --> 01:26:05.244]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:26:05.284 --> 01:26:05.704]  Go ahead.
[01:26:07.064 --> 01:26:09.785]  Yeah, I'm calling about Terri Schiavo.
[01:26:10.205 --> 01:26:10.545]  Yes.
[01:26:11.725 --> 01:26:16.466]  Well, yeah, I tried calling you back in the last hour yesterday, but it didn't work.
[01:26:16.586 --> 01:26:17.386]  Well, tell us about it.
[01:26:17.427 --> 01:26:18.467]  Tell us what's happening with her.
[01:26:18.827 --> 01:26:27.909]  Well, I was at the rally Sunday down here, and as I said yesterday, Mel Gibson sent some remarks, which were read.
[01:26:28.479 --> 01:26:28.839]  That's good.
[01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:30.760]  Dr. Dobson can focus on the family.
[01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:34.822]  Um, Michael Chabot is going to be on Nightline tonight.
[01:26:36.043 --> 01:26:40.865]  For those that may be so inclined to tune in to hear his side of the story as they promoted it.
[01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:46.408]  But what's happening with her right now?
[01:26:46.748 --> 01:26:49.370]  Well, we're just, you know, she's under death watch.
[01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:54.072]  We're, you know, they're going to pull the tube, you know, uh, Friday at one o'clock.
[01:26:55.092 --> 01:26:58.894]  As per the judge's order, any time after one o'clock Friday, they can yank it.
[01:27:01.334 --> 01:27:07.517]  You know, and we're waiting for the legislator to get off their rear end and do something other than flap their gums.
[01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:13.719]  Well, I mean, what about the, uh, you know, protection of families and children?
[01:27:13.739 --> 01:27:17.181]  I mean, I guess because this is somebody that actually needs help, they're not going to help her.
[01:27:17.881 --> 01:27:23.503]  Well, in DCF, the lawyers, you know, are, uh, wringing their hands and, you know,
[01:27:24.335 --> 01:27:32.099]  But they need to just stop talking and go in there and take protective custody of that woman, pronto.
[01:27:32.639 --> 01:27:33.700]  Well, let me ask the question.
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:41.404]  I mean, this has been said a hundred times before, but you're not allowed to starve a horse to death or a cow or a pig or a dog.
[01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:50.429]  Imagine if we were going to just scrap a dog down just because its neck was broken and then we're just going to take the food away.
[01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:52.070]  Take the water away.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.621]  Yeah, well... You think people put up with that?
[01:27:54.681 --> 01:27:55.882]  No, they come arrest you.
[01:27:56.842 --> 01:27:57.823]  Understand that, yep.
[01:27:57.943 --> 01:28:00.885]  Listen, people in the country have hundreds of stray dogs.
[01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:03.186]  They start attacking your dogs, attacking your livestock.
[01:28:03.446 --> 01:28:05.387]  People shoot those dogs, they get arrested.
[01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.269]  Alright?
[01:28:07.289 --> 01:28:09.590]  And if you don't live in the country, you don't know about this problem of feral dogs.
[01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:13.352]  But... But then, in this case, we're allowed to kill a woman.
[01:28:13.893 --> 01:28:16.714]  Well, I just finished reading... I just... You want to put me on hold?
[01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:18.035]  Well, sure.
[01:28:18.075 --> 01:28:19.316]  I had you on.
[01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:20.336]  I wanted to hear what you had to say.
[01:28:20.717 --> 01:28:22.858]  Yeah, well... You can hold me over to the break.
[01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:25.000]  Yeah, what is it you'd like to talk about when we get back?
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.621]  Well, I got some more to tell you.
[01:28:27.582 --> 01:28:28.002]  About what?
[01:28:28.502 --> 01:28:28.962]  About this.
[01:28:29.563 --> 01:28:30.103]  I mean, tell me.
[01:28:31.124 --> 01:28:32.084]  Well, you got a break coming up.
[01:28:32.124 --> 01:28:34.826]  I know, but I mean, give me, you know, just keep talking up to the break.
[01:28:35.486 --> 01:28:40.949]  Okay, well, um, I was just gonna say, make some remarks about the people that are there.
[01:28:40.969 --> 01:28:42.450]  Alright, well, we'll be right back.
[01:28:43.631 --> 01:28:44.672]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.032 --> 01:28:46.633]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.553 --> 01:28:50.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.148 --> 01:28:57.289]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[01:28:57.489 --> 01:29:00.190]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:01.770]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:11.853]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:29:12.073 --> 01:29:13.814]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:29:14.094 --> 01:29:17.975]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[01:29:18.195 --> 01:29:22.616]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:26.677]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[01:29:26.897 --> 01:29:33.099]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:29:33.279 --> 01:29:36.079]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:29:36.259 --> 01:29:39.640]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:43.481]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:47.602]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:29:47.762 --> 01:29:52.024]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[01:29:54.864 --> 01:30:06.128]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:30:06.348 --> 01:30:09.829]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:14.310]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:14.591 --> 01:30:18.532]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:30:18.752 --> 01:30:25.274]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:30:25.494 --> 01:30:30.996]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:31.236 --> 01:30:35.818]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:30:36.058 --> 01:30:38.161]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:30:38.361 --> 01:30:44.310]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:50.358 --> 01:30:51.640]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:54.873 --> 01:31:00.358]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.778 --> 01:31:05.022]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:05.263 --> 01:31:12.289]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:18.775]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.795 --> 01:31:20.136]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.476 --> 01:31:23.420]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.581 --> 01:31:24.462]  Eliminate the cost.
[01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:25.583]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:25.904 --> 01:31:33.134]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:36.839]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:41.904]  Call today.
[01:32:06.667 --> 01:32:10.429]  John Gaspé is going to be our guest here in just about two or three minutes.
[01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:16.072]  Did a federal agent ban anti-Bush signs in downtown storefronts?
[01:32:16.093 --> 01:32:17.273]  This is out of the Memphis Flyer.
[01:32:18.394 --> 01:32:20.575]  Yeah, the Memphis Flyer needs us to do a Google search.
[01:32:20.595 --> 01:32:24.397]  There have been lots of reports of this mainstream all over the country.
[01:32:24.557 --> 01:32:29.980]  And when this happened to John, he talked to other store owners and found out it was happening all over the place.
[01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:32.442]  These agents don't like to tell you their names.
[01:32:33.357 --> 01:32:35.439]  As I said earlier, with Puffer Belly Toys in St.
[01:32:35.459 --> 01:32:40.162]  Helena, they just said, stop selling that knock-off Rubik's Cube, or you're a terrorist.
[01:32:40.182 --> 01:32:41.443]  And she said, tell me your name.
[01:32:41.543 --> 01:32:41.863]  No!
[01:32:42.464 --> 01:32:43.324]  She thought it was fake.
[01:32:43.344 --> 01:32:44.785]  A month and a half later, they show up.
[01:32:46.467 --> 01:32:48.068]  Homeland Security, baby!
[01:32:48.128 --> 01:32:53.732]  Those nice, foggy creatures that won't even tell you where their building's located.
[01:32:54.813 --> 01:32:55.793]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:32:57.114 --> 01:32:57.655]  But, um,
[01:32:58.402 --> 01:33:03.827]  Terry Schiavo Schindler, I mean if you don't know the details of the case, very suspicious what happened to her.
[01:33:04.808 --> 01:33:06.669]  She's not, they used to call her brain dead.
[01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:11.974]  No, she laughs, cries, looks back and forth, loves music, smiles at her parents, frowns at Schiavo.
[01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:16.598]  She's got all this money for her malpractice.
[01:33:17.038 --> 01:33:18.599]  Won't let them give her treatment for 10 years.
[01:33:18.619 --> 01:33:19.941]  She's been tortured for 10 years.
[01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:22.463]  They won't brush her teeth, treat her bad sores.
[01:33:22.843 --> 01:33:23.864]  She still fights on.
[01:33:28.385 --> 01:33:32.106]  She's a poster child for the pro-death people because they really want to kill her.
[01:33:34.547 --> 01:33:39.649]  And on Friday, after this three year, since I've been involved, three year fight, they're going to pull her feeding tube.
[01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:46.211]  Last time it happened, last year, she survived for like eight, nine days before they passed a law to put the feeding tube back in her.
[01:33:46.651 --> 01:33:50.332]  And these judges, who think they're above the state legislatures, which they're not,
[01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.200]  I mean, the judge has said she will die.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:53.880]  Ha ha ha.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.500]  This is sick.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.021]  Real quick, I want to go to my guest, Randy.
[01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.882]  Finish up what you had to say about this down in Florida.
[01:34:01.422 --> 01:34:11.906]  Well, what I was going to do, if our state government will not step in and do their duty to protect her, then the citizens of Pinellas County and the churches down there need the right to the occasion.
[01:34:11.966 --> 01:34:15.127]  If ever there was a situation for civil disobedience, this is it.
[01:34:16.247 --> 01:34:19.268]  And the sheriff's phone number down there,
[01:34:20.785 --> 01:34:29.875]  Who should also stand up and protect and serve Terry is 727-582-6201.
[01:34:32.037 --> 01:34:35.641]  And people need to be calling him and telling him to stand up and protect her.
[01:34:36.301 --> 01:34:39.785]  We also need to protect all the other people this is happening to.
[01:34:39.805 --> 01:34:40.426]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:41.581 --> 01:34:44.583]  Look, I'm going to get Wesley Smith from the Wall Street Journal back on.
[01:34:45.104 --> 01:34:47.525]  Hundreds of cases he knows of where people are talking.
[01:34:47.766 --> 01:34:49.767]  Hey, please have food and water and they're killing them.
[01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:51.608]  Euthanasia is already here, folks.
[01:34:52.069 --> 01:34:52.429]  Alright.
[01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:54.150]  I want to go to our guest now.
[01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:55.171]  I appreciate him holding.
[01:34:56.351 --> 01:34:58.013]  We talked about this earlier in the hour.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.161]  John, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:35:02.341 --> 01:35:03.822]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:35:04.402 --> 01:35:05.202]  It's good to be here.
[01:35:05.702 --> 01:35:06.023]  Thank you.
[01:35:06.383 --> 01:35:11.645]  So, tell us about your town and tell us about why the President was coming to town and this phone call you got.
[01:35:12.346 --> 01:35:14.306]  Well, Memphis is Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:35:14.327 --> 01:35:17.348]  We've got a city of a little over a million people.
[01:35:18.268 --> 01:35:18.809]  Great city.
[01:35:19.289 --> 01:35:20.309]  Mid-south.
[01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:22.350]  Wonderful place to be.
[01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:24.731]  Wonderful place to live right now, but we've got a lot happening here.
[01:35:25.892 --> 01:35:29.934]  The President was coming to Memphis, as he's going to, I think, 60 cities around the country.
[01:35:30.768 --> 01:35:39.513]  Trying to promote his social security reform package, the privatization package, personalization, whatever they're calling it this week.
[01:35:40.914 --> 01:35:44.316]  And he was here to speak to people about it.
[01:35:46.017 --> 01:35:50.500]  On Wednesday, we received a phone call.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.643]  Now, I need to let you know that my store happens to be about three blocks from a federal courthouse.
[01:35:56.203 --> 01:35:59.305]  So, when someone calls up and says, agents such and such,
[01:36:00.808 --> 01:36:01.628]  I'm used to hearing that.
[01:36:01.668 --> 01:36:05.270]  I think that they're just calling because they're running late and they want to pick up a cup of coffee on their way to work.
[01:36:06.231 --> 01:36:07.431]  That's no big surprise to me.
[01:36:08.212 --> 01:36:18.817]  What did surprise me is, although the gentleman that I spoke with was extremely polite, extremely pleasant, um, they were asking that people not put up any, uh, any disparaging signs.
[01:36:18.837 --> 01:36:20.938]  Well, I mean, let's, I mean, let's go through the phone call.
[01:36:21.078 --> 01:36:27.422]  I mean, go back, you know, to memory when, uh, hello, you know, this is, uh, John at the coffee shop.
[01:36:27.442 --> 01:36:29.343]  I mean, did he identify himself?
[01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:29.843]  What did he say?
[01:36:30.796 --> 01:36:37.902]  Uh, he did, but again, as I said from the beginning, it's, um... Yeah, you're not jotting down a name because you're right by a courthouse.
[01:36:37.942 --> 01:36:39.504]  Hey, this is Agent Aaron Gahan.
[01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:41.646]  By the time you focus, he'd already said the name.
[01:36:41.706 --> 01:36:41.946]  Okay.
[01:36:42.386 --> 01:36:42.566]  Right.
[01:36:43.027 --> 01:36:43.227]  Right.
[01:36:43.247 --> 01:36:46.550]  So, again, it's not unusual for me to receive a phone call from somebody.
[01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:50.733]  I have two or three people with badges coming on in my shop every day.
[01:36:51.033 --> 01:36:51.534]  No big deal.
[01:36:53.015 --> 01:36:57.139]  Um, anyway, we... He just said that they were calling about security in the area.
[01:36:57.179 --> 01:36:58.580]  Again, I didn't think anything about that.
[01:36:59.666 --> 01:37:01.747]  Uh, I've seen people, I've talked to different people.
[01:37:02.228 --> 01:37:03.208]  We knew what was going on.
[01:37:03.228 --> 01:37:05.029]  Yeah, there's always an advanced team.
[01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:06.971]  Exactly, they've been here for a month.
[01:37:07.691 --> 01:37:08.451]  We're used to seeing them.
[01:37:09.412 --> 01:37:14.555]  Or, you know, or at least knowing that they're, not necessarily seeing them, but knowing that they're in the area.
[01:37:14.915 --> 01:37:16.136]  Sure, so what happened next?
[01:37:16.776 --> 01:37:28.023]  So, uh, the guy just said that, uh, they were asking that businesses, uh, that were going to be near where the President was staying, um, did not have up any signs
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.742]  Uh, he did say pro or against President Bush.
[01:37:31.922 --> 01:37:33.683]  Okay, the newspaper wasn't clear on that.
[01:37:34.284 --> 01:37:47.732]  Well, um, but the, the essence of it was, that it was like, don't have any of, any pro or anti-Bush, and then spoke about anti-Bush signs several times, first mentioning a pro-Bush sign, pro-President Bush sign, one time.
[01:37:47.932 --> 01:37:53.756]  Well, when he was governor, let me just stop you, this was in the Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle and Statesman, it was in all the big Texas papers.
[01:37:54.289 --> 01:37:58.612]  The radio station I work for, KJFK, I didn't pull this stunt.
[01:37:58.692 --> 01:38:00.213]  A guy named Shannon Burke did.
[01:38:01.554 --> 01:38:08.259]  And literally, you'd have disability groups, pro-life groups, environmental groups, it didn't matter, out there protesting the governor.
[01:38:08.379 --> 01:38:14.203]  And in downtown Austin, it's 11th Street right there by the Capitol, big, giant, uh, sidewalks.
[01:38:14.223 --> 01:38:16.265]  There's always, you know, and I've lived in this town for
[01:38:17.159 --> 01:38:23.905]  Fifteen years, there's always people down there protesting, whatever governor it is, and they would just come in with paddy wagons and arrest whoever did it.
[01:38:23.945 --> 01:38:27.288]  Well, there were a bunch of lawsuits, and the governor lost those lawsuits.
[01:38:27.308 --> 01:38:32.152]  The state lost a bunch of, uh, just several of the rulings were like $100,000 a piece, so...
[01:38:34.545 --> 01:38:35.586]  They stopped doing it!
[01:38:35.626 --> 01:38:45.270]  But the point is, this, but, but, the stunt we pulled, the radio station, we sent down a couple of interns with signs saying, we love Bush.
[01:38:45.570 --> 01:39:01.117]  While another protest was there, this is in the middle of the whole thing, in fact I think this stunt pushed it over the edge to them winning a lawsuit, they were arresting disabled people in wheelchairs, weren't blocking anything, but didn't arrest the two girls we sent with we love Bush.
[01:39:03.483 --> 01:39:06.826]  Somehow that doesn't surprise me with the current times.
[01:39:07.046 --> 01:39:08.567]  No, you can read that.
[01:39:09.528 --> 01:39:19.695]  Any reporter listening right now, when you talk to reporters... Okay, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[01:39:21.136 --> 01:39:22.017]  I lost you for a moment.
[01:39:24.479 --> 01:39:24.819]  Okay.
[01:39:27.581 --> 01:39:28.722]  What was I saying?
[01:39:28.782 --> 01:39:30.924]  I was talking about how this had happened and the people were
[01:39:31.536 --> 01:39:46.699]  Coming in and the different things that were said and in essence, I put up a sign that simply said, we have been informed by a federal agent that we are not to put up any anti-President Bush signs in our storefront windows.
[01:39:47.619 --> 01:39:50.540]  We would instead like to remind the agent that we still have First Amendment rights.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:59.642]  That seems to be the most direct way of confronting the issue and not having
[01:40:01.055 --> 01:40:05.519]  I'm not having the problem of people saying anything against the President.
[01:40:06.179 --> 01:40:09.582]  I live in a city that is very conservative.
[01:40:10.563 --> 01:40:20.511]  Although we did vote for President Bush on a whole as a state, the county that I live in did vote for John Kerry during the last election.
[01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:27.957]  The essence of it, though, is that when 52% of your population votes for somebody and 48% against,
[01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:29.649]  You don't want to put up a sign.
[01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:32.250]  You don't want to put up anything that's going to cost you half your customers.
[01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:34.970]  Whether it's for or against, you're going to hurt your business.
[01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:37.651]  Ultimately, I'm a capitalist.
[01:40:38.611 --> 01:40:40.511]  That's the, uh, that's the essence of things.
[01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:41.771]  It's the best thing that I could think.
[01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:44.012]  Dude, that's the best thing that I could come up with.
[01:40:45.012 --> 01:40:46.752]  And I'm, I'm also a veteran.
[01:40:48.273 --> 01:40:55.014]  I've been, I've been in situations and I feel I've earned the right to say that we have First Amendment.
[01:40:55.976 --> 01:41:00.383]  We have our Bill of Rights, we have our First Amendment, and that's what we need to be in life.
[01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:05.884]  Well, John, this only happens a couple times a year, but somebody doesn't like what we're saying.
[01:41:05.944 --> 01:41:22.669]  My dedicated link to the network, I'm down in Texas, they're up in Minnesota, has been terminated somehow, so I'm trying to get reconnected via the digital stereo feed for you, but I'll keep rocking and rolling with you right here over the telephone here from the office.
[01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:24.990]  But, I mean, we see this wanton push.
[01:41:27.789 --> 01:41:38.174]  out there to suppress free speech everywhere systematically just so people don't see images of protesters or people that don't go along with these policies.
[01:41:38.214 --> 01:41:52.441]  I'm sure you've heard of the cases where people, there have been 500 Bush supporters and one person with a sign saying no blood for oil and the Secret Service arrests them and says you're only allowed to go to a free speech zone, but the people that are pro-Bush, they're allowed to stay.
[01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:54.322]  They're right in there, exactly.
[01:41:55.561 --> 01:41:58.262]  So that was the case here in Memphis.
[01:41:59.343 --> 01:42:05.305]  The protest zone was four blocks past the route that the President was going to be going.
[01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:14.689]  It was far and away removed from anything having to do with the event.
[01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:19.091]  Well, there are a lot of other big examples of this.
[01:42:20.959 --> 01:42:32.124]  In modern history, with civil rights activists and others, but now they're bringing it back in force and really trying to almost segregate people who are against the President's policies.
[01:42:32.144 --> 01:42:37.827]  You know, Bill Clinton tried a little bit of this, but it was nothing compared to what Bush is getting away with.
[01:42:37.887 --> 01:42:48.112]  You know, my mother saw the new film I produced, Martial Law, when I was in New York for the RNC, where they threatened to arrest us, and we showed 400,000 plus protesters, and she watches the news.
[01:42:48.992 --> 01:42:50.754]  She said, son, none of this was on the news.
[01:42:50.794 --> 01:42:52.276]  These protesters were not on the news.
[01:42:52.296 --> 01:42:54.178]  They didn't show these numbers of people.
[01:42:54.518 --> 01:43:03.467]  So everywhere they're basically covering up the numbers of people that are protesting and where they can't cover it up is where Bush's route is going to be.
[01:43:04.168 --> 01:43:05.869]  To be honest with you, I don't even know.
[01:43:05.889 --> 01:43:09.510]  In addition to my coffee shop, I have an office that is a little bit removed from downtown.
[01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:11.250]  I didn't think that big of a deal about the time.
[01:43:33.938 --> 01:43:39.080]  I've sort of fallen into this situation by accident.
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:41.261]  They didn't drive past my place that much, I know.
[01:43:42.801 --> 01:43:52.364]  Instead of going down Main, which has trolleys on it and a few other things, they took Front Street and went directly to underground parking.
[01:43:52.984 --> 01:43:58.306]  He did not go into the formal entrance of the building where he was speaking.
[01:43:58.346 --> 01:43:59.266]  He went into the underground.
[01:44:02.688 --> 01:44:03.168]  I don't know.
[01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:07.631]  They had us blocked off for three blocks in any given direction.
[01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:10.932]  And, I mean, this is Memphis, Tennessee, after all.
[01:44:10.952 --> 01:44:26.580]  This is a place that knows one or two things about civil rights and the cost and the problems that... not the civil rights cause, of course, but that... the problems that can happen and the horrible events that can arise when people's civil rights are suppressed.
[01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:31.723]  I mean, I'm literally standing less than a mile from where Martin Luther King was assassinated.
[01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.568]  And there's a constant reminder of that in this city.
[01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:47.901]  Well, I mean, as you say, you're a veteran, and you have served this country as a public servant, and you know a little bit about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:44:47.941 --> 01:44:52.746]  You know how egregious this is, how ridiculous this is, how un-American this is.
[01:44:52.766 --> 01:44:56.710]  This is something right out of China, where they don't let people protest at Tiananmen Square.
[01:44:57.526 --> 01:45:03.308]  I mean, now they have a Red Sox game, and some people are out on the streets having a party.
[01:45:03.348 --> 01:45:09.130]  They walk up with rubber bullets and blow a young woman's eye back into her brain.
[01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:16.332]  It's also violence against people that are protesting, and it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:45:16.632 --> 01:45:19.453]  I mean, how does this have anything to do with fighting terrorism?
[01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:19.973]  It doesn't.
[01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:22.134]  But using this backdrop of fear
[01:45:23.443 --> 01:45:24.283]  They're just doing it.
[01:45:24.744 --> 01:45:26.164]  And that's what tyranny is all about.
[01:45:26.224 --> 01:45:27.044]  It's just doing it.
[01:45:27.464 --> 01:45:30.165]  Government just starts doing whatever it wants.
[01:45:30.745 --> 01:45:35.567]  And I'd like to ask the listeners out there if they're aware of how bad this has gotten.
[01:45:35.867 --> 01:45:45.330]  And I know it's going to be worse in the next generation because they're teaching the children in the public schools almost nothing about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and people's freedoms.
[01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:50.732]  In fact, in many cases they've got all these anti-Second Amendment messages in the textbooks that I've seen covered on air.
[01:45:51.652 --> 01:45:54.533]  Just across the board, we're being taught that we don't have freedoms.
[01:45:54.793 --> 01:46:04.674]  I'm sure you've heard about the young man who wrote a fiction story about zombies busting up out of the ground and attacking an imaginary school.
[01:46:05.034 --> 01:46:07.375]  Didn't mention any real people, didn't mention a real school.
[01:46:07.955 --> 01:46:16.136]  But they said, well, yes, your article's about zombies, but we're going to go ahead and arrest you and charge you as a terrorist in Kentucky because you talked about zombies.
[01:46:16.496 --> 01:46:19.857]  I mean, so we see the First Amendment and free speech everywhere.
[01:46:20.899 --> 01:46:22.060]  That is so ridiculous.
[01:46:23.341 --> 01:46:25.283]  It doesn't surprise me in this day and age.
[01:46:25.643 --> 01:46:26.884]  Well, you know about the lead singer?
[01:46:27.084 --> 01:46:28.786]  The lead singer of Stereophonics?
[01:46:29.106 --> 01:46:31.828]  He had a shirt with a gun on it.
[01:46:32.269 --> 01:46:36.793]  One of the band's symbols, and they wouldn't let him fly because of the picture of a gun on his shirt.
[01:46:42.157 --> 01:46:43.038]  What are those war comments?
[01:46:43.398 --> 01:46:43.659]  I mean...
[01:46:45.512 --> 01:46:50.555]  Well, I just want to ask folks out there how much worse they think it's going to get in the future.
[01:46:51.716 --> 01:46:53.196]  Just a few other questions for you.
[01:46:54.557 --> 01:46:56.238]  Now, again, this guy calls.
[01:46:56.298 --> 01:47:03.782]  He told you his name, but at the time you weren't paying complete attention until he started getting into, don't have signs in your window, for or against Bush, particular or against.
[01:47:04.343 --> 01:47:10.746]  What about when you started talking to some of your other businesses, some of the other neighbors, or what happened when locals came in and saw your sign?
[01:47:10.946 --> 01:47:13.828]  First, tell us about the sign, and then tell us what other businesses told you.
[01:47:14.679 --> 01:47:23.462]  Well, the sign says, uh, we have been told by a federal agent that we are not to put up any anti-President Bush signs in our store windows.
[01:47:24.002 --> 01:47:27.064]  We would instead like to remind the agent that we still have First Amendment rights.
[01:47:27.564 --> 01:47:28.404]  Thank you and fire call.
[01:47:30.185 --> 01:47:33.686]  So, in no way, shape, or form does it say anything negative about the President.
[01:47:34.506 --> 01:47:35.507]  Uh, I'm a business owner.
[01:47:35.887 --> 01:47:36.527]  I gotta make money.
[01:47:36.547 --> 01:47:41.629]  I'm not gonna take off half my, uh, half my, uh, possible customers.
[01:47:42.148 --> 01:47:42.308]  Exactly.
[01:47:42.328 --> 01:47:44.449]  You didn't even have a sign, did you, when they called you?
[01:47:44.809 --> 01:47:45.470]  Absolutely not.
[01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:49.992]  Okay, but then you talked to others, according to the newspaper, of the Memphis Flyer.
[01:47:50.032 --> 01:47:53.414]  Then you talked to other locals, and what did they tell you?
[01:47:53.434 --> 01:48:03.379]  Some of the other businesses, I talked to various servers and bartenders in some of the local restaurants, and they'd heard of people being called.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:08.182]  A few restaurants knew that people were being called.
[01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:09.763]  And then on Saturday,
[01:48:11.274 --> 01:48:16.017]  Saturday afternoon after someone took a picture of the other side and put it on a blog.
[01:48:16.638 --> 01:48:17.959]  That's how this whole thing got picked up.
[01:48:18.679 --> 01:48:23.783]  On Saturday, we got two phone calls from Alabama, where the President had been apparently on Thursday.
[01:48:24.963 --> 01:48:27.625]  And oddly enough, same thing had happened there.
[01:48:28.446 --> 01:48:29.586]  They'd been told the same thing.
[01:48:29.987 --> 01:48:30.507]  Exactly.
[01:48:31.608 --> 01:48:39.673]  And the demeanor of the person, making sure that they understood that it was for or against
[01:48:40.342 --> 01:48:43.383]  But really stressing the against part was in tact as well.
[01:48:48.786 --> 01:49:00.331]  It's amazing because the more the story grows, the more I hear it's happened in various other places that things similar to this have been happening.
[01:49:00.411 --> 01:49:04.513]  Now, there are a couple of points that I've got to stress on this.
[01:49:05.293 --> 01:49:06.694]  One, I can't prove
[01:49:07.802 --> 01:49:10.444]  That it was, in fact, a federal agent.
[01:49:10.904 --> 01:49:12.285]  That's how they identified themselves.
[01:49:12.305 --> 01:49:13.866]  Could have been just goons from the party.
[01:49:14.467 --> 01:49:15.448]  Exactly.
[01:49:15.668 --> 01:49:16.408]  I want to stay there.
[01:49:16.468 --> 01:49:18.149]  I'm back on my line here.
[01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:21.512]  And we're going to come back and I want to take some calls for you, John, okay?
[01:49:21.532 --> 01:49:22.292]  Sure thing.
[01:49:22.873 --> 01:49:24.294]  We're talking to John Gaskade.
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:29.462]  And, uh, I wish these mainstream media reporters would do some Google searching.
[01:49:29.802 --> 01:49:31.623]  They've got LexisNexis even better.
[01:49:32.103 --> 01:49:39.626]  I could probably think of 20 mainstream articles of stuff like this happening, front pages of papers, in the last three years.
[01:49:39.846 --> 01:49:44.548]  So I'll have to... Maybe the listeners, maybe folks, you can dig those articles out.
[01:49:44.608 --> 01:49:48.870]  They're on Infowars.com and send them to the mainstream media so we can confirm all this.
[01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.231]  Just one more case of the same stuff happening.
[01:49:53.442 --> 01:49:57.764]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.944 --> 01:50:02.386]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.526 --> 01:50:06.928]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.948 --> 01:50:08.289]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.209 --> 01:50:09.950]  Animersive!
[01:50:38.729 --> 01:50:43.853]  The Illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:44.074 --> 01:50:48.698]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:05.452 --> 01:51:05.672]  Yes!
[01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:14.138]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.398 --> 01:51:21.443]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:21.723 --> 01:51:26.566]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:26.766 --> 01:51:32.170]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:35.432]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:35.913 --> 01:51:43.903]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.923 --> 01:51:44.484]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:58.711]  I got Ron Paul's office coming on.
[01:52:58.731 --> 01:53:04.235]  They've signed it on to the supplemental budget package.
[01:53:04.255 --> 01:53:08.498]  The expansion of the National ID Card set to pass the Senate today.
[01:53:08.538 --> 01:53:10.579]  That's coming up about ten after in the next hour.
[01:53:11.099 --> 01:53:12.840]  I want to get to all your calls as well.
[01:53:13.981 --> 01:53:15.522]  Before we go back to John,
[01:53:16.522 --> 01:53:18.484]  And let him finish up and take a few of your calls.
[01:53:18.564 --> 01:53:23.508]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, rise of the police state, is out.
[01:53:23.668 --> 01:53:27.652]  The first 35 minutes of the two-plus hour film is reporters being arrested.
[01:53:27.692 --> 01:53:31.896]  We're threatened with arrest with congressional press passes anywhere in New York.
[01:53:32.776 --> 01:53:34.738]  Protestors being arrested for no reason.
[01:53:35.599 --> 01:53:40.383]  The White House's public order for the Secret Service and others are to arrest protestors.
[01:53:41.444 --> 01:53:43.486]  Don't allow them on our parade routes.
[01:53:44.793 --> 01:53:46.955]  So, this is all just part of the course.
[01:53:49.036 --> 01:53:53.419]  I hope you'll get Martial Law, because then we get into 9-11 for a full hour of the film.
[01:53:54.059 --> 01:53:58.222]  And really, it's just power-packed full of information and what really happened.
[01:53:58.242 --> 01:54:04.866]  Then we get into Skull and Bones, and the Elite, and the Bush-Nazi connection back to World War II, and how that connects into Schwarzenegger.
[01:54:05.427 --> 01:54:06.487]  It's my best film.

[01:54:52.134 --> 01:54:52.514]  John Gascogne,
[01:55:08.135 --> 01:55:11.598]  Now, you're saying you got calls from Alabama and other places saying this has happened to them.
[01:55:11.978 --> 01:55:14.780]  What about from the newspaper article in the Memphis Flyer?
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.825]  They're saying that people that came into your business were saying, oh yeah, other businesses got that call.
[01:55:21.346 --> 01:55:23.168]  Did you hear from other businesses locally?
[01:55:23.668 --> 01:55:24.028]  I did.
[01:55:24.329 --> 01:55:24.649]  I did.
[01:55:24.689 --> 01:55:28.492]  And a few did admit that they got similar phone calls.
[01:55:29.193 --> 01:55:33.036]  Some people were approached about different things, but anytime that
[01:55:34.488 --> 01:55:36.969]  Things about the putting out signs was mentioned.
[01:55:37.009 --> 01:55:39.031]  It was always in reference to a phone call.
[01:55:41.172 --> 01:55:51.737]  But yes, there are at least 300 businesses in the area that I can confirm were... When you were in the military or when you were growing up and you heard this stuff about the Soviet Union, did you ever think it would happen here?
[01:55:52.858 --> 01:55:53.078]  No.
[01:55:53.879 --> 01:55:58.041]  No, absolutely not.
[01:55:58.221 --> 01:56:01.743]  It's maddening that things are happening like this.
[01:56:02.116 --> 01:56:06.519]  Well, you know, they keep just doing it and doing it and doing it until we finally just get used to it.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:09.021]  We need to continue being outraged.
[01:56:09.561 --> 01:56:10.822]  Well, what's the old saying?
[01:56:11.423 --> 01:56:12.944]  Evil prevails when good men do nothing?
[01:56:15.826 --> 01:56:16.786]  It's absolutely true.
[01:56:16.806 --> 01:56:17.687]  Let's take a call.
[01:56:17.707 --> 01:56:20.289]  Dave in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:56:21.084 --> 01:56:31.490]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say that you know the reason we have this problem with the media is because about 12 years ago we used to have 50 major media corporations, now we only have 6 and they're all owned by the elitist.
[01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:32.631]  Yeah, it's 4 now.
[01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:33.291]  Is it 4 now?
[01:56:33.311 --> 01:56:33.711]  It used to be 6.
[01:56:33.891 --> 01:56:36.693]  I'm behind a little bit on the time, sorry about that.
[01:56:37.173 --> 01:56:39.835]  Yeah, 90% of the media is owned by 4 corporations.
[01:56:40.315 --> 01:56:40.855]  That's terrible.
[01:56:41.896 --> 01:56:47.539]  The other day you talked about Maureen Gosch and the Jeff Gannon connection and that's another thing the media hasn't really touched on.
[01:56:48.354 --> 01:56:50.195]  No, it's just, oh, we've got fake reporters.
[01:56:50.235 --> 01:56:54.718]  Yeah, that work for the White House and are a service to them in more ways than one.
[01:56:55.899 --> 01:57:01.143]  The thing I wanted to talk to you about was, believe it or not, I was able to get a hold of Noreen Gosch via the internet.
[01:57:01.523 --> 01:57:03.984]  And I actually got her number and talked to her.
[01:57:04.645 --> 01:57:08.427]  And I asked her if she had considered a DNA test.
[01:57:08.527 --> 01:57:13.831]  And she said that she had, but that she had to get with Mr. Gannon's publicist to get that confirmed.
[01:57:13.871 --> 01:57:16.873]  And I said, well, you know, there's other ways to get a DNA sample if you need one.
[01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:19.750]  I thought that was quite interesting.
[01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:20.411]  That's interesting.
[01:57:20.451 --> 01:57:20.991]  Stay there.
[01:57:22.791 --> 01:57:27.832]  John, stay with us about five more minutes and at the next little segment I want to finish up with you and take a call or two.
[01:57:28.532 --> 01:57:29.473]  And then we'll be right back.
[01:57:29.493 --> 01:57:33.414]  Then we've got Ron Paul's press secretary coming on, Jeff Deist.
[01:57:34.474 --> 01:57:38.255]  They're about to beef up the National ID card and boy is it scary.
[01:57:49.779 --> 01:57:50.419]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.161]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.861 --> 01:57:53.962]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.602 --> 01:57:55.463]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.183 --> 01:57:57.064]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.084 --> 01:58:01.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.927 --> 01:58:06.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.371 --> 01:58:16.778]  We've been talking to John Gaskade, and later we're going to go back to Dave in Texas to let him finish up his points about the Jeff Gannon case.
[01:58:16.978 --> 01:58:18.219]  Is he Johnny Gosch?
[01:58:19.822 --> 01:58:24.645]  And we know he's a male prostitute, and we know that that's what they're into up there at the White House.
[01:58:25.285 --> 01:58:26.926]  All part of the Christian conservatism.
[01:58:28.007 --> 01:58:34.531]  But going back to our guest, headline, did a federal agent ban anti-Bush signs in downtown storefronts?
[01:58:34.551 --> 01:58:37.193]  This is out of the Memphis Flyer, and of course the answer is yes.
[01:58:37.753 --> 01:58:40.575]  These people are all over the place doing this in plain view.
[01:58:40.595 --> 01:58:47.719]  I mean, people are arrested and then fired for wearing an anti-Bush t-shirt at a public meeting Bush comes to.
[01:58:47.779 --> 01:58:49.180]  I mean, it's that bad.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.621]  Let's take another call.
[01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:54.383]  Let's talk to John in Alaska.
[01:58:54.723 --> 01:58:56.264]  You're on the air with our guest, John.
[01:58:56.284 --> 01:58:57.525]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:57.725 --> 01:59:00.427]  Hello, sir.
[01:59:01.688 --> 01:59:08.653]  I really enjoyed the different excerpts and pieces in your DVDs about the Illuminati and the Freemasonry.
[01:59:09.853 --> 01:59:17.939]  There was a case, a place I lived in Kentucky at one time, where a Baptist minister, who owned several acres of farmland,
[01:59:20.812 --> 01:59:25.353]  His property literally bordered a guy who was a Freemason.
[01:59:26.233 --> 01:59:36.255]  And this guy went, and this was a verifiable case, this guy went to court and had the property lines where he lost another few acres of his land.
[01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:37.816]  The Baptist minister did.
[01:59:38.316 --> 01:59:42.057]  And come to find out, the judge was a Freemason judge.
[01:59:42.897 --> 01:59:47.838]  So the Freemason farmer had the Freemason judge on his side.
[01:59:48.362 --> 01:59:55.833]  And so when the Baptist minister went to court to try to protest and pull up the original document, they didn't even recognize him.
[01:59:55.873 --> 01:59:57.135]  They threw the judge out of court.
[01:59:58.382 --> 02:00:00.403]  I mean, not to judge, he threw the farmer.
[02:00:01.684 --> 02:00:04.305]  That's this good ol' boy system gone to seed.
[02:00:04.325 --> 02:00:11.189]  I mean, look at Halliburton and Cheney running the contracts out of the Vice President's office.
[02:00:11.249 --> 02:00:14.631]  I mean, it's just pell-mell, wild corruption.
[02:00:14.951 --> 02:00:15.851]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:16.472 --> 02:00:18.252]  Any comments on that, John?
[02:00:19.913 --> 02:00:21.754]  That one's news to me, actually.
[02:00:21.914 --> 02:00:26.657]  It doesn't surprise me, but I haven't heard anything on that before.
[02:00:27.833 --> 02:00:30.434]  Well, it's rampant, but that's what we're fighting.
[02:00:30.474 --> 02:00:33.295]  It's just a giant good ol' boy system that's gotten greedy.
[02:00:34.896 --> 02:00:44.180]  I do remember hearing a report recently that one of the reasons that the White House has stopped going after Tokyo Don with the oil for food program is... Because it came out that Halliburton was doing it.
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:45.601]  Taking bribes, exactly.
[02:00:46.921 --> 02:00:53.804]  And then people go, well they're doing it, well we're doing it, well they're... That's the point, is that it's so corrupt across the board.
[02:00:54.465 --> 02:00:55.005]  Exactly.
[02:00:56.044 --> 02:00:57.284]  Well, where does it go from here?
[02:00:57.364 --> 02:01:09.168]  I mean, I think everybody should do what you've done, and you weren't planning to put a sign up, but since they said it, you just said, hey, I've been told by some government agent, and they're telling me, uh, you know, they don't have any signs against Bush.
[02:01:09.208 --> 02:01:10.989]  Well, I've got a First Amendment.
[02:01:11.749 --> 02:01:12.269]  Exactly.
[02:01:12.909 --> 02:01:13.290]  Exactly.
[02:01:13.710 --> 02:01:17.311]  And that's what everybody should do.
[02:01:18.451 --> 02:01:23.613]  Whenever things are happening like this, whenever you're seeing your rights eroded, whenever
[02:01:24.921 --> 02:01:26.862]  You hear about these things happening to other people.
[02:01:27.682 --> 02:01:28.523]  You need to stand up.
[02:01:28.563 --> 02:01:29.503]  You need to point it out.
[02:01:29.523 --> 02:01:30.404]  You need to take a voice.
[02:01:30.424 --> 02:01:31.945]  You need to become active in this thing.
[02:01:32.505 --> 02:01:33.185]  It amazes me.
[02:01:33.205 --> 02:01:41.189]  I don't think that the President is aware at all that there's any sort of homeless population in any city that he visits.
[02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:42.830]  Because they don't allow milk near it.
[02:01:43.411 --> 02:01:43.811]  Bingo.
[02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:46.372]  I didn't even know Memphis had paddy wagons.
[02:01:46.612 --> 02:01:47.233]  Apparently we do.
[02:01:49.114 --> 02:01:52.295]  Well, he just saw them for this in case the slaves don't like their emperor.
[02:01:53.296 --> 02:01:53.796]  Exactly.
[02:01:54.432 --> 02:01:58.296]  All right, well, John Gaskay, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:01:58.796 --> 02:01:59.998]  We've got a couple of affiliates.
[02:02:00.118 --> 02:02:04.662]  One is WBCR that are in Tennessee, but that's out by Knoxville.
[02:02:04.722 --> 02:02:06.124]  But we've got listeners on the internet.
[02:02:06.524 --> 02:02:08.926]  Shortwave, how do folks come down and drink some of your Joe?
[02:02:09.547 --> 02:02:10.448]  I appreciate that.
[02:02:10.468 --> 02:02:11.369]  Please do.
[02:02:11.829 --> 02:02:15.533]  We are right in the heart of downtown Memphis on the corner of Main and Madison.
[02:02:15.813 --> 02:02:17.415]  You're at the second north of Main.
[02:02:17.915 --> 02:02:18.556]  No, no, no.
[02:02:20.236 --> 02:02:21.356]  Maine and Madison.
[02:02:21.797 --> 02:02:22.737]  Maine and Madison.
[02:02:23.237 --> 02:02:23.837]  Exactly.
[02:02:24.057 --> 02:02:25.618]  We've got two trolley lines in the city.
[02:02:25.778 --> 02:02:26.898]  Together in front of my door.
[02:02:27.438 --> 02:02:27.899]  Alright.
[02:02:28.399 --> 02:02:30.039]  John, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:31.040]  Thank you.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.180]  I look forward to hearing from you again.
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:32.560]  Take care.
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:32.920]  Take care.
[02:02:33.761 --> 02:02:34.201]  Alright.
[02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:35.421]  Yeah, he stood up to them.
[02:02:35.961 --> 02:02:37.222]  He wasn't planning to put a sign up.
[02:02:37.262 --> 02:02:38.082]  He said, I'm a veteran.
[02:02:38.102 --> 02:02:39.323]  I'll do whatever I want.
[02:02:39.723 --> 02:02:40.523]  This isn't Russia.
[02:02:41.223 --> 02:02:41.763]  We'll be back.
[02:02:42.684 --> 02:02:43.404]  Ron Paul's office.
[02:02:45.248 --> 02:02:46.809]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.949 --> 02:02:50.031]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.171 --> 02:02:54.074]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.114 --> 02:02:58.337]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.697 --> 02:03:02.480]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.421]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.001 --> 02:03:07.924]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:07.964 --> 02:03:12.668]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.828 --> 02:03:15.891]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.051 --> 02:03:18.933]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.394 --> 02:03:25.519]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.039 --> 02:03:29.842]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.243 --> 02:03:31.604]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:34.967]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.547 --> 02:03:40.131]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:40.151 --> 02:03:44.195]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:44.415 --> 02:03:47.838]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:03:48.138 --> 02:03:51.619]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:51.739 --> 02:03:55.680]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:02.061]  Black murky replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, the non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.461 --> 02:04:10.383]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:10.783 --> 02:04:11.744]  We're good to go.
[02:04:25.674 --> 02:04:26.134]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.154 --> 02:04:26.574]  We're good to go.
[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:45.911]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:50.013]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:50.333 --> 02:04:51.154]  Read the labels.
[02:04:51.594 --> 02:04:55.716]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:55.936 --> 02:05:00.118]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:00.498 --> 02:05:05.360]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.302]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Calbem Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:09.522 --> 02:05:14.864]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:15.144 --> 02:05:17.865]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:18.165 --> 02:05:19.065]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:19.366 --> 02:05:30.090]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Calbem Pure Soaps.
[02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:35.354]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:35.514 --> 02:05:40.398]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[02:05:46.083 --> 02:05:51.708]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.569 --> 02:05:59.274]  Well, we attempt, and many times are successful, defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:00.564 --> 02:06:10.126]  But we've just seen a wild acceleration of government corruption, of corporate looting through the Congress, through the executive branch.
[02:06:10.946 --> 02:06:16.768]  Our freedoms are being scientifically dismembered in front of our very eyes.
[02:06:17.148 --> 02:06:23.009]  And one of the few champions we have in the United States Congress is Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:25.690]  Doctor, family man, veteran.
[02:06:26.539 --> 02:06:34.204]  He's introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve, bills to get rid of the Patriot Act, which is totally unpatriotic, has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.
[02:06:34.985 --> 02:06:36.446]  He has done so much!
[02:06:37.686 --> 02:06:53.497]  And we, of course, have the Congressman on routinely, but I'm always honored to have Jeff Dyson, who works so hard with the Congressman and who contacted us this morning, along with many other media outlets, to tell us that, hey, you know, that super Patriot Act-type national ID card?
[02:06:55.859 --> 02:07:01.124]  They passed standardization of driver's license back in December, which starts the National ID Card.
[02:07:01.404 --> 02:07:10.392]  But this new one, according to Ron Paul's writings and analysis of the bill, which I checked out for myself, creates a Pan-American Union ID Card with Mexico and Canada.
[02:07:11.233 --> 02:07:14.576]  Starts putting gun owners into these databases, as Larry Pratt has told you.
[02:07:15.717 --> 02:07:17.278]  It just does so much.
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:26.285]  Puts a microchip in the license so they can scan it and read it, so I guess thieves can scan you and steal your identity easier.
[02:07:27.666 --> 02:07:30.308]  It's horrible, but it has nothing to do with stopping illegal aliens.
[02:07:30.328 --> 02:07:32.489]  They put some treys in there like that.
[02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:36.492]  Meanwhile Bush, after they fund thousands more Border Patrol, Bush blocks it.
[02:07:37.872 --> 02:07:39.273]  But joining us is Jeff Dice.
[02:07:39.974 --> 02:07:41.695]  This bill is on the verge of passing.
[02:07:41.895 --> 02:07:42.876]  Jeff, thanks for coming on.
[02:07:43.136 --> 02:07:43.316]  Sure.
[02:07:45.517 --> 02:07:47.017]  You're the Press Secretary for Ron Paul.
[02:07:47.057 --> 02:07:50.399]  I know you've been busy out there today fighting all of this.
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.441]  Tell us what we're on the verge of.
[02:07:53.761 --> 02:07:57.924]  Well, in February, the House passed the National ID Card Bill.
[02:07:58.884 --> 02:08:00.025]  It wasn't presented that way.
[02:08:00.045 --> 02:08:07.549]  It was presented as immigration reform or amnesty reform or border reform, but it dealt with none of those things.
[02:08:07.949 --> 02:08:09.770]  It had nothing to do with immigration policy.
[02:08:09.810 --> 02:08:12.372]  It was just setting up driver's license standards.
[02:08:13.001 --> 02:08:16.484]  So the question then became, will the Senate pass the bill as well?
[02:08:17.545 --> 02:08:27.172]  And what's happening today is Congress is busy passing a so-called supplemental spending bill, as though the 13 normal appropriations bills weren't enough.
[02:08:27.953 --> 02:08:40.563]  And what they've done is they've inserted this HR 418, the National ID Card bill that already passed, they've inserted that in a very crafty fashion into this spending bill, and it's
[02:08:42.091 --> 02:08:42.832]  So, classic pork burl?
[02:09:01.734 --> 02:09:14.697]  What it means is that it makes it a lot harder for any senators who might have not liked the idea of a national ID card to vote against it because it's now a tiny part of a much bigger spending bill.
[02:09:14.857 --> 02:09:17.117]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things.
[02:09:17.157 --> 02:09:22.318]  They're busy trying to get the new bridge in or trying to not get the military base shut down.
[02:09:22.358 --> 02:09:25.419]  Meanwhile, now for those that just joined us,
[02:09:26.582 --> 02:09:31.727]  Congressman Ron Paul wrote a detailed analysis of the bill, and I went and got his analysis and wrote my own.
[02:09:32.728 --> 02:09:33.929]  And I've had Larry Pratt on.
[02:09:33.949 --> 02:09:35.611]  I mean, it's got anti-gun stuff in it.
[02:09:36.051 --> 02:09:37.453]  It is gigantic!
[02:09:37.493 --> 02:09:41.797]  I mean, this thing has got regional government, the end of sovereignty.
[02:09:41.877 --> 02:09:45.641]  It's got just all sorts of horrible stuff in it.
[02:09:46.198 --> 02:09:52.841]  But then I tune into the Neocon Talk Show host, Jeff, and they're telling me how this is going to stop all the illegal aliens, and I've read the bill!
[02:09:53.141 --> 02:09:55.002]  There's nothing in there about illegal aliens!
[02:09:55.342 --> 02:09:58.664]  No, they, you know, they don't have passports now.
[02:09:58.804 --> 02:10:02.326]  You know, by definition, an illegal alien is the lawbreaker.
[02:10:02.866 --> 02:10:08.609]  So why, if they're not concerned with our immigration laws, I'm not sure I understand why they should be concerned with our ID laws.
[02:10:12.236 --> 02:10:18.041]  For those that don't know the details of the bill, can you go over a little bit of what's in this expansion of the National ID Card?
[02:10:18.061 --> 02:10:26.769]  Well, the ID Card Bill, first and foremost, it forces all the states to have certain characteristics on their driver's license.
[02:10:26.929 --> 02:10:28.991]  And it forces them all into this federal regime.
[02:10:29.031 --> 02:10:37.539]  It also allows the Homeland Security Department head to, in the future, determine, you know, without going to Congress,
[02:10:38.126 --> 02:10:40.591]  Determine what standards need to be on there.
[02:10:40.611 --> 02:10:41.693]  That could be biometrics.
[02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:42.755]  It could be a fingerprint.
[02:10:42.775 --> 02:10:43.938]  It could be all kinds of things.
[02:10:44.359 --> 02:10:44.519]  RFID.
[02:10:45.564 --> 02:10:52.409]  You name it, it's very open-ended, and it allows future Homeland Security chiefs to do that without a congressional vote.
[02:10:52.449 --> 02:11:09.743]  But it also forces all the states to link to what's called the Driver's License Agreement, which is something that the motor vehicle folks have wanted for a long time, and it's in that Driver's License Agreement, the DLA, where Canada and Mexico could be linked
[02:11:10.263 --> 02:11:16.266]  to our driver's license database so it becomes sort of a tri-national database.
[02:11:17.747 --> 02:11:20.368]  So that's essentially what the National ID Card does.
[02:11:20.428 --> 02:11:25.311]  It takes the first steps towards a domestic passport of sorts.
[02:11:25.691 --> 02:11:28.452]  For the time being, it's still going to be a driver's license.
[02:11:28.532 --> 02:11:30.213]  It's still going to have the name of your state on it.
[02:11:30.854 --> 02:11:33.456]  But in essence, it's going to be a federal idea.
[02:11:33.717 --> 02:11:35.618]  And really, we think it's just softening people up.
[02:11:35.899 --> 02:11:43.526]  Well, it's just like they have 50 different quarters they issue, and each quarter has a symbol of the state on the back now, but it's all federal.
[02:11:43.566 --> 02:11:44.867]  It all came from the same mint.
[02:11:45.047 --> 02:11:46.729]  Sure, sure.
[02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:50.332]  They know that maybe people aren't emotionally ready.
[02:11:50.972 --> 02:11:55.213]  To just be handed federal papers, so they're going to ease us into it.
[02:11:55.253 --> 02:11:58.373]  And of course, incrementalism is the way Washington operates.
[02:11:58.534 --> 02:12:03.715]  But it's even worse than just federal papers, because no longer will it be state and federal separate papers.
[02:12:03.775 --> 02:12:08.295]  It will all be integrated under one system, even getting a lot of control over the state systems.
[02:12:08.375 --> 02:12:08.615]  Right.
[02:12:09.016 --> 02:12:09.496]  Absolutely.
[02:12:09.536 --> 02:12:10.256]  Even worse.
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:15.877]  Both parties have totally sold out on the concept of federalism, you know, shared power between federal and state government.
[02:12:17.317 --> 02:12:19.098]  Both parties sold out on that a long time ago.
[02:12:19.118 --> 02:12:30.964]  So now, if you're in bad with the state, you're in bad with the feds, and if you're in bad with the feds, you're in bad with the state, and now the states are all doing agreements with other states to follow all their laws and take your license for this or that.
[02:12:31.484 --> 02:12:33.285]  I mean, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[02:12:33.325 --> 02:12:35.406]  The vision of the Founding Fathers torched.
[02:12:35.466 --> 02:12:38.568]  Now, WorldNetDaily picked it up, and then the AP did as well.
[02:12:39.955 --> 02:12:55.437]  And I read the passage, I should have brought that for this interview, but when they saw this new bill that's about to pass today, unless we somehow stop it and put a lot of pressure on Congress, we'll get that number out here in a few minutes, but Jeff, it was this passage about the security fence on the Mexico border with
[02:12:56.137 --> 02:12:56.657]  California.
[02:12:56.977 --> 02:13:08.060]  But then it leaves it open-ended, where it says the feds can basically, in any of these areas, just not follow existing laws and make laws they wish.
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:12.281]  Well, this Homeland Security Office wants more illegal aliens.
[02:13:12.321 --> 02:13:13.901]  They've said, no, we're not going to spend money.
[02:13:14.222 --> 02:13:16.002]  Congress gives us for more border patrols.
[02:13:16.062 --> 02:13:19.023]  So, a very dangerous precedent.
[02:13:19.063 --> 02:13:19.763]  Any comments on that?
[02:13:20.344 --> 02:13:26.424]  Yeah, it had a provision, an express provision that allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to suspend domestic laws.
[02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:32.931]  In this case, in order to finish this border fence that they're talking about.
[02:13:32.951 --> 02:13:33.871]  But it's open-ended though.
[02:13:34.131 --> 02:13:35.072]  Yeah, it's open-ended.
[02:13:35.092 --> 02:13:38.873]  You know, the suspension of law, God knows what that could be in five or ten years.
[02:13:39.473 --> 02:13:45.296]  They could decide to suspend all kinds of laws, like habeas corpus or something, if we had another terrorist event or something like that.
[02:13:45.616 --> 02:13:50.318]  But look, there's no will to build a border fence or it would have been done a long time ago.
[02:13:50.338 --> 02:13:51.859]  That's a red herring.
[02:13:51.899 --> 02:13:56.301]  Well, yeah, they put that name on there and the lawyers all look at it and go, wait, this is for everything.
[02:13:56.841 --> 02:13:57.662]  Right, exactly.
[02:13:57.762 --> 02:14:01.386]  Exactly, they like tag it with the name border, has nothing to do with it.
[02:14:01.586 --> 02:14:03.228]  Right, it was pretty eye-opening.
[02:14:03.308 --> 02:14:08.493]  I mean, there were even some Democrats who objected to it, who said, wow, this is pretty open-ended.
[02:14:08.593 --> 02:14:10.375]  We're letting the... Well, what securities are...
[02:14:11.194 --> 02:14:11.835]  I think so.
[02:14:29.682 --> 02:14:39.447]  And he said, you're going to have to have one of these cards to have a job, we're going to list citizens, you know, green, yellow, orange, red, bad credit.
[02:14:40.468 --> 02:14:45.590]  He was admitting it all, and it was food service, transportation, everything!
[02:14:46.151 --> 02:14:56.276]  Every job we're going to have, and the feds with all these databases that are full of false reports, and you know, five members of congress can't fly, and I mean, all this is happening.
[02:14:57.736 --> 02:14:58.617]  This is insane!
[02:14:59.949 --> 02:15:02.611]  Well, it's more of the same.
[02:15:02.911 --> 02:15:05.834]  It's where we've been headed for a long time.
[02:15:06.895 --> 02:15:09.136]  Virtually everything you do now has a federal component.
[02:15:09.176 --> 02:15:13.440]  If you want to fly on an airplane, that's FAA.
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:20.345]  If you want to get a job, you have to show your status as a legal citizen or a resident.
[02:15:20.826 --> 02:15:27.491]  If you want to enter a federal building, it's no longer a case where a person can live their life
[02:15:28.428 --> 02:15:31.212]  Uh, you know, without having to deal with the federal government.
[02:15:31.592 --> 02:15:34.756]  Which is why no state is going to refuse this agreement.
[02:15:35.056 --> 02:15:41.344]  Because, as our colleague pointed out, they're going to make non-citizens, essentially, out of their citizens if they don't accept the ID.
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:51.102]  Gotta have it to live, to have a job, and have you seen this where you go into a gas station and the old lady has to show her ID and they scan it to buy beer?
[02:15:51.762 --> 02:15:53.202]  Or somebody buying cigarettes?
[02:15:53.322 --> 02:16:01.964]  And all these corporations are suddenly... I talked to a guy who runs a diamond shamrock, he said, yeah, they told us that soon we're going to swipe the card for everything.
[02:16:02.784 --> 02:16:04.725]  And of course that has to do with the national sales tax.
[02:16:05.285 --> 02:16:05.525]  Right.
[02:16:05.925 --> 02:16:07.265]  I mean, this is a nightmare!
[02:16:08.385 --> 02:16:10.926]  And again, Rush Limbaugh, Jeff, will not talk about this.
[02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:17.253]  Right, well, you know, Republicans love the state as much as Democrats do, that's for sure.
[02:16:20.516 --> 02:16:23.278]  Wow, but what happened in Congress?
[02:16:23.338 --> 02:16:24.919]  I mean, they know this is all unpopular.
[02:16:25.179 --> 02:16:28.981]  They know people are against this 70-80% in major polls, all this stuff.
[02:16:29.822 --> 02:16:32.584]  ID cards is even higher, but they just keep doing it.
[02:16:32.624 --> 02:16:35.706]  Well, in the past, the Congress wasn't this out of control.
[02:16:35.846 --> 02:16:36.967]  Why are they doing this now?
[02:16:37.487 --> 02:16:52.391]  Well, I think what happened in Congress is most people don't carefully read bills, and the sponsor of the bill and the House leadership presented it as an immigration reform bill, and it's a party thing, so all the Republicans in the Republican House quickly fall into line.
[02:16:53.096 --> 02:16:58.524]  Uh, the Democrats are, as you know, Hillary and others, trying to look a little bit more tough on immigration.
[02:16:58.584 --> 02:16:59.025]  I love it!
[02:16:59.365 --> 02:17:08.418]  So most of them fell in line, and the few that did object didn't object on the grounds that a national idea is Orwellian or a national idea is not proper in a supposedly free society.
[02:17:09.233 --> 02:17:18.080]  No, their objections were that their constituencies are illegal immigrants and they didn't want... Which then plays into conservatives thinking it's real.
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.261]  Really, that's like WWF wrestling.
[02:17:20.321 --> 02:17:21.182]  It's a staged event.
[02:17:21.462 --> 02:17:21.682]  Right.
[02:17:21.902 --> 02:17:27.907]  Because the last national ID card bill that passed, it was in there, where it actually tells the states to issue IDs to illegals.
[02:17:28.307 --> 02:17:28.507]  Right.
[02:17:28.747 --> 02:17:29.568]  Form of amnesty.
[02:17:29.588 --> 02:17:33.611]  I'll do one more segment with this, Jeff, because I want to ask you a few other important questions.
[02:17:33.631 --> 02:17:35.072]  We'll be back in about three and a half minutes.
[02:17:35.472 --> 02:17:36.273]  Four minutes, folks.
[02:17:37.052 --> 02:17:44.855]  I'm Alex Jones and we're talking to Jeff Deist with Ron Paul's office.
[02:17:45.436 --> 02:17:49.417]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[02:17:49.437 --> 02:17:50.738]  The real money folks.
[02:17:54.033 --> 02:17:55.974]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:17:56.454 --> 02:17:57.334]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:17:57.374 --> 02:17:57.974]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:17:58.014 --> 02:17:58.395]  A 5% increase.
[02:17:58.435 --> 02:18:00.856]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:18:00.876 --> 02:18:02.756]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:18:02.776 --> 02:18:04.237]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[02:18:04.257 --> 02:18:05.717]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:21.534 --> 02:18:24.576]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:18:25.116 --> 02:18:30.279]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[02:18:39.564 --> 02:18:40.844]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:48.461]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.141 --> 02:18:55.802]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:18:56.962 --> 02:18:59.263]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:00.063 --> 02:19:06.284]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:19:07.184 --> 02:19:15.266]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:24.174]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:25.035 --> 02:19:26.556]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:26.576 --> 02:19:26.976]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:26.996 --> 02:19:27.456]  Call now.
[02:19:27.476 --> 02:19:31.459]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:19:45.518 --> 02:19:47.139]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.259 --> 02:19:51.361]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.501 --> 02:19:54.403]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.463 --> 02:20:01.186]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.366 --> 02:20:04.368]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.568 --> 02:20:06.969]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.089 --> 02:20:11.832]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:20:11.992 --> 02:20:26.582]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:20:26.722 --> 02:20:33.366]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[02:20:36.288 --> 02:20:36.528]  8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:36.548 --> 02:20:37.108]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:37.168 --> 02:20:37.668]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:37.688 --> 02:20:38.148]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:38.208 --> 02:20:38.608]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:38.628 --> 02:20:39.349]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:39.369 --> 02:20:39.969]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:40.029 --> 02:20:40.529]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:40.569 --> 02:20:41.029]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:41.189 --> 02:20:41.669]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:41.689 --> 02:20:42.189]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:42.249 --> 02:20:42.549]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:42.569 --> 02:20:43.029]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:43.069 --> 02:20:45.090]  That's 8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.330]  That's
[02:21:04.515 --> 02:21:07.997]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[02:21:08.437 --> 02:21:14.780]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world.
[02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:19.162]  Specially designed to improve your health, come on and care about yourself just a little more.
[02:21:19.602 --> 02:21:20.022]  Turtle Bites!
[02:21:51.318 --> 02:21:52.279]  Look at your children.
[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:56.202]  You're committing them to a nightmare system.
[02:21:56.302 --> 02:21:58.043]  I mean, the police state is all around us.
[02:21:58.583 --> 02:22:00.104]  We're talking to Jeff Dice.
[02:22:00.164 --> 02:22:02.106]  He's the head honcho over there for Ron Paul.
[02:22:02.666 --> 02:22:04.127]  Has a fabulous job.
[02:22:04.908 --> 02:22:15.975]  And, uh, well, warning you that, uh, this massive expansion of the already passed National ID Card of last year is on the verge of passing the Senate today or tomorrow.
[02:22:16.015 --> 02:22:16.856]  It's the supplemental
[02:22:17.911 --> 02:22:21.075]  Bill, as it's known, Supplemental Budget, or Pork Barrel.
[02:22:21.656 --> 02:22:24.279]  Give them a call at Congress, ask for your Senator.
[02:22:24.359 --> 02:22:26.021]  Forget House members, it's in the Senate.
[02:22:26.782 --> 02:22:28.605]  Or, should we call both, Jeff?
[02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:34.355]  Both, absolutely, because the House is still voting today on the supplemental and the Senate will in the very near future.
[02:22:34.535 --> 02:22:35.775]  Pull the foot out of my mouth then.
[02:22:36.356 --> 02:22:37.576]  Call both House and Senate.
[02:22:37.596 --> 02:22:37.876]  202-224-3121.
[02:22:37.896 --> 02:22:38.116]  202-224-3121.
[02:22:38.276 --> 02:22:39.757]  And we do stop stuff sometimes.
[02:22:39.777 --> 02:22:40.797]  Sometimes we don't, but tell them.
[02:22:49.136 --> 02:22:50.897]  Now, is there a way to pull this out?
[02:22:50.937 --> 02:22:52.657]  I guess I'd have to take it back to conference committee?
[02:22:53.277 --> 02:23:10.722]  Well, the way is to, I mean, if we assume that the House passes it intact today with the National ID Card language included, then, you know, whatever pressure can be brought on the Senate to be aware of that and try to remove it before it's sent to the White House.
[02:23:11.829 --> 02:23:23.555]  Now, whereas the last national ID card bill that passed to create the foundation actually helped illegal aliens and the state in a way, this is, would you say, neutral on illegal aliens or helping them?
[02:23:23.735 --> 02:23:25.176]  It really doesn't affect them.
[02:23:25.276 --> 02:23:27.937]  It's an inward facing bill, just like a lot of the
[02:23:28.467 --> 02:23:30.648]  Post 9-11 stuff, including the Terrorist Act.
[02:23:30.688 --> 02:23:32.109]  This applies to U.S.
[02:23:32.149 --> 02:23:32.549]  citizens.
[02:23:32.589 --> 02:23:34.350]  About keeping the slaves in line, yeah.
[02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:34.690]  Sure.
[02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:37.231]  I mean, only law-abiding folks are going to do this.
[02:23:37.311 --> 02:23:38.172]  It's like gun control.
[02:23:38.192 --> 02:23:42.994]  It doesn't apply... By definition, it doesn't apply to criminals.
[02:23:43.014 --> 02:23:44.295]  202-224-3121.
[02:23:45.255 --> 02:23:47.376]  Jeff, I've got a whole other issue I want to bring up to you.
[02:23:47.716 --> 02:23:47.937]  Sure.
[02:23:48.277 --> 02:23:54.720]  And then I'll let you get out of here, and we're going to come back, folks, and talk to Bart, and Bill, and Ron, and Dave, and Gail, and everybody else, and cover some other news.
[02:23:56.096 --> 02:24:00.338]  Every day I see protesters being arrested right next to Bush supporters.
[02:24:00.858 --> 02:24:02.519]  They just say, no protesters allowed.
[02:24:03.179 --> 02:24:12.624]  This latest thing with this John Gascade, when Bush came into Memphis, he and other businesses got this call, hey we're federal agents, no anti-Bush signs in your window.
[02:24:13.004 --> 02:24:14.845]  He hadn't had an anti-Bush sign up.
[02:24:15.605 --> 02:24:18.508]  Until they did that, and he put one up saying, I have a First Amendment.
[02:24:19.008 --> 02:24:21.431]  I mean, this is really getting scary.
[02:24:22.391 --> 02:24:26.695]  And we know Clinton tried stuff like this, but he never did it to the extent Bush is.
[02:24:27.296 --> 02:24:29.518]  And are they just trying to condition us to accept this?
[02:24:29.558 --> 02:24:30.338]  How do we fight this?
[02:24:31.259 --> 02:24:32.861]  Well, it's this subservient mindset.
[02:24:33.121 --> 02:24:41.168]  I don't know if you heard when he was in Europe last month, and visiting some town in Germany, the police there
[02:24:41.636 --> 02:24:49.935]  You know, it's closed down the whole city and closed down the street and they told everybody to not come out of their balconies and not look at them, you know, avert their eyes from the...
[02:24:50.788 --> 02:24:52.249]  From the maximum leader, so to speak.
[02:24:52.289 --> 02:24:57.871]  So it's definitely something that's accelerated in the last few years with this administration.
[02:24:57.911 --> 02:24:59.872]  The maximum leader, the great, dear leader.
[02:25:00.452 --> 02:25:02.213]  Now, Jeff, I know you're a stickler.
[02:25:03.034 --> 02:25:05.675]  I've got to find out where you heard that or where you saw that.
[02:25:06.015 --> 02:25:19.141]  Because when he went to Africa a few years ago, one particular country, the BBC, they shut down all the streets, put like 20,000 people in a sports stadium, bulldozed the shantytowns, just so he wouldn't have to look at it.
[02:25:20.481 --> 02:25:23.885]  Yeah, it's really unbelievable and it's not the way it ought to be.
[02:25:24.145 --> 02:25:29.111]  I mean, I commend anyone in Memphis who stood up to that nonsense.
[02:25:29.531 --> 02:25:31.734]  The Germans are very subservient to their government.
[02:25:32.495 --> 02:25:36.799]  I'm sorry for interrupting, but I mean, where did you hear that?
[02:25:37.479 --> 02:25:38.860]  It was widely reported.
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:41.142]  I can certainly dig it up and try to get it to you.
[02:25:41.162 --> 02:25:43.544]  It was probably an AP story or something like that.
[02:25:43.584 --> 02:25:45.506]  That was about a month ago when he was in Germany.
[02:25:45.526 --> 02:25:46.367]  Well, I'll find that.
[02:25:46.627 --> 02:25:47.848]  See, this is the stuff I miss.
[02:25:48.128 --> 02:25:50.290]  I mean, imagine saying, don't come out on the street.
[02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:52.552]  Do not come out on your balcony.
[02:25:52.792 --> 02:25:54.353]  And I'm sure the Germans did it, didn't they?
[02:25:54.613 --> 02:25:55.414]  I'm sure they did.
[02:25:55.434 --> 02:25:56.535]  That's why they got Hitler.
[02:25:57.162 --> 02:25:57.422]  Right.
[02:25:58.022 --> 02:25:59.543]  I'm sorry, Jeff, you wanted to commend the guy?
[02:25:59.983 --> 02:26:11.908]  Well, yeah, I mean, if the guy in Memphis, A, it's his property, he can put whatever sign up he wants, and B, he's got an absolute First Amendment right, so congratulations to him for putting that up.
[02:26:12.344 --> 02:26:14.367]  But Jeff, doesn't it make you want to pull your hair out?
[02:26:14.387 --> 02:26:16.169]  I mean, I know it makes the congressman want to.
[02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:18.292]  And again, we're not for the Democrats here.
[02:26:18.732 --> 02:26:20.354]  I mean, you guys are Republicans.
[02:26:20.675 --> 02:26:24.219]  But I mean, this is getting Hitler-like.
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:27.063]  I mean, Hitler never said, don't come out on your balconies.
[02:26:28.604 --> 02:26:34.685]  Well, the unfortunate problem is that there's still a lot of people who are caught up in party politics.
[02:26:35.145 --> 02:26:35.905]  Actually, I apologize.
[02:26:35.925 --> 02:26:36.826]  I'm going to interrupt you again.
[02:26:36.846 --> 02:26:37.566]  I'm bad about that.
[02:26:38.006 --> 02:26:43.887]  Actually, when Hitler toured Paris, they told the people, do not come out on the streets, do not come out on your balconies.
[02:26:44.127 --> 02:26:44.747]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:45.187 --> 02:26:49.188]  Well, hopefully we've learned something in the 70 years since Hitler, right?
[02:26:50.048 --> 02:26:51.569]  Maybe not as much as we should have learned.
[02:26:54.232 --> 02:27:02.715]  You know, people need to reject party politics, and they need to have the integrity to say that, hey, what's wrong when the other side does it is wrong when our guy does it, too.
[02:27:02.775 --> 02:27:09.857]  And to the extent Republicans, you know, accept these things because it's Bush doing them, then they have no integrity.
[02:27:10.297 --> 02:27:14.979]  Shouldn't we just say, Hail Caesar, and start putting statues up in our homes and pray to?
[02:27:15.919 --> 02:27:16.619]  No, we shouldn't.
[02:27:16.679 --> 02:27:18.340]  We should resist this crap, Alex.
[02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:22.121]  But isn't that a sign of Al-Qaeda if you don't worship the maximum leader?
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.425]  Well, it certainly doesn't bode well, but, you know, we're still fighting.
[02:27:28.765 --> 02:27:30.167]  God bless you, Jeff Dyson.
[02:27:30.247 --> 02:27:31.148]  God bless Ron Paul.
[02:27:31.188 --> 02:27:31.648]  Take care.
[02:27:31.708 --> 02:27:34.812]  Thanks for listening.
[02:27:35.553 --> 02:27:35.713]  Bye.
[02:27:35.733 --> 02:27:35.853]  Bye.
[02:27:35.893 --> 02:27:36.814]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.295 --> 02:27:38.897]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.818 --> 02:27:42.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.667 --> 02:27:47.809]  All water isn't the same.
[02:27:48.089 --> 02:27:53.075]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:27:53.336 --> 02:27:55.939]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:27:56.159 --> 02:28:04.690]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:28:05.050 --> 02:28:13.496]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[02:28:13.636 --> 02:28:17.078]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.

[02:28:45.072 --> 02:28:48.753]  You've heard about PODS from Bio Ox International and its bubble up technology.
[02:28:49.034 --> 02:28:53.335]  But have you heard about Bio Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble up technology?
[02:28:53.555 --> 02:29:00.497]  Bio Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:29:00.897 --> 02:29:07.543]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:29:07.843 --> 02:29:11.307]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:29:11.327 --> 02:29:12.107]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.

[02:29:23.653 --> 02:29:30.335]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:29:30.555 --> 02:29:35.236]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[02:29:35.416 --> 02:29:37.937]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:29:38.097 --> 02:29:42.758]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[02:29:44.685 --> 02:29:52.193]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:29:52.473 --> 02:30:03.384]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:30:04.885 --> 02:30:09.048]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:30:09.389 --> 02:30:19.837]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:30:20.137 --> 02:30:20.637]  That's right!
[02:30:20.818 --> 02:30:27.943]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:30:28.223 --> 02:30:32.346]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:30:32.506 --> 02:30:36.969]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:37.029 --> 02:30:37.490]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:31:09.539 --> 02:31:13.681]  Alright, we're back live my friends, and we're going to go straight to all of your loaded phones.
[02:31:14.701 --> 02:31:21.624]  I'll just take five or six more calls, that's all I have time for, so I can have a few final news stories, but... We're not kidding!
[02:31:21.665 --> 02:31:27.928]  I mean, you just heard the Press Secretary, his Chief of Staff, Ron Paul... You've heard Ron Paul on here many times.
[02:31:29.188 --> 02:31:32.870]  Jeff is so good, and his office is so good, they call up and go, want the Congressman on?
[02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:34.711]  Want, uh... Jeff on?
[02:31:34.751 --> 02:31:37.412]  I mean, that's how hard they're fighting the New World Order.
[02:31:37.432 --> 02:31:40.614]  I mean, that's how hard they're fighting this legislation.
[02:31:40.674 --> 02:31:42.255]  They really do care.
[02:31:44.105 --> 02:31:45.846]  The Congressman does such a wonderful job.
[02:31:47.447 --> 02:31:54.170]  But we've at least got to call Congress and tell them no.
[02:31:54.190 --> 02:31:59.872]  202-224-3121 and just ask for your House member or your dirty Senator.
[02:31:59.892 --> 02:32:00.053]  202-224-3121.
[02:32:00.073 --> 02:32:01.293]  And they're so cynical!
[02:32:02.074 --> 02:32:05.735]  They'll name these bills, you know, immigration bills, and then it says amnesty.
[02:32:06.816 --> 02:32:08.737]  The one they passed last year.
[02:32:09.157 --> 02:32:10.057]  And I'll leave here.
[02:32:10.117 --> 02:32:11.338]  I'll go out and get my car.
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:22.647]  And I will tune in to Neocon Radio and it'll be, we gotta get this bill passed and fight the illegals.
[02:32:22.707 --> 02:32:24.509]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:28.211]  Meanwhile, Bush is going, I'm for open borders, I'm for amnesty.
[02:32:28.832 --> 02:32:35.116]  And then he's supporting this bill and they're going, look at the great job Bush is doing, fighting them illegals.
[02:32:36.177 --> 02:32:37.678]  Wait a minute, he said he was for it.
[02:32:38.039 --> 02:32:39.720]  Well, just shut up, liberal.
[02:32:42.059 --> 02:32:43.641]  I mean, it's just mindlessness!
[02:32:44.521 --> 02:32:44.761]  It is!
[02:32:44.822 --> 02:32:45.662]  It's mindless!
[02:32:47.444 --> 02:32:48.965]  There's so much bad stuff in there.
[02:32:49.625 --> 02:33:06.799]  I guess about a month ago we had Larry Pratt on GOA, Gun Owners of America, and he was saying that this is going to put gun owners in a registration database, even if you've been arrested, not convicted ever, if you have bad credit.
[02:33:06.879 --> 02:33:07.820]  No gun, folks!
[02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:13.152]  And now, I was sent the video, thank you, and callers called about it last week.
[02:33:14.452 --> 02:33:25.357]  I was on C-SPAN, and they're up there going, oh yeah, Al-Qaeda might get guns, we've got to register all of them, and if you're under even suspicion of crime or terror, you can't have a gun.
[02:33:26.697 --> 02:33:29.838]  It's going to be retroactive where they just show up and confiscate your guns.
[02:33:29.858 --> 02:33:31.639]  Well, you're on the watch list, and you know what?
[02:33:31.979 --> 02:33:36.381]  The neocons won't even talk about it when it's happening, or they'll get on air and say, good!
[02:33:37.196 --> 02:33:38.257]  Good, this is good.
[02:33:38.538 --> 02:33:47.247]  Or they'll pick some, you know, communist or liberal who's having their guns taken and conservatives will go, well I guess gun confiscation is pretty darn good then.
[02:33:47.267 --> 02:33:49.530]  Alright.
[02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:51.652]  I'll stop doing my redneck voice.
[02:33:51.692 --> 02:33:54.736]  How about I do my, uh, that's not like a redneck without doing it, don't it?
[02:33:55.116 --> 02:33:56.758]  How about I do my Yankee voice?
[02:33:57.839 --> 02:33:58.560]  Have some fun.
[02:34:00.396 --> 02:34:02.897]  We've got to do something about the guns!
[02:34:02.937 --> 02:34:03.818]  We've got to go!
[02:34:03.878 --> 02:34:05.018]  It's horrible!
[02:34:06.059 --> 02:34:07.960]  The guns are dangerous!
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.301]  We've got to get them out of the people's hands!
[02:34:13.402 --> 02:34:15.723]  That was hurting my voice to do that voice.
[02:34:16.704 --> 02:34:17.784]  Trying to have some fun here.
[02:34:20.306 --> 02:34:24.768]  But, uh... We'll go to your calls here in uno momento.
[02:34:25.728 --> 02:34:28.309]  I really... Listen, I'm not going to hype it.
[02:34:28.369 --> 02:34:29.650]  I'm not going to belabor it.
[02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:33.172]  My videos, you know, are pretty good.
[02:34:34.334 --> 02:34:39.842]  They're professionally produced, they're jam-packed, they're shocking, they're very effective at waking people up.
[02:34:41.265 --> 02:34:47.374]  Well, my newest video is heads, shoulders above my other documentaries.
[02:34:48.803 --> 02:34:53.684]  I mean, it is hard-hitting, and frankly, you're getting a library in this one video.
[02:34:53.744 --> 02:35:01.905]  It is so jam-packed, so fast-moving, covers so many different topics and issues, two hours thirty-five minutes long.
[02:35:03.906 --> 02:35:05.686]  And I suggest you watch it in three parts.
[02:35:05.746 --> 02:35:07.706]  I mean, it really is three films.
[02:35:08.426 --> 02:35:17.348]  We cover the police state in New York, the hover blimps, the sound cannons, the police threatening to arrest us, arresting others, the provocateurs, the communists getting in our face,
[02:35:19.494 --> 02:35:24.556]  The phony right-wingers, it's all in there, the fake left-right paradigms the first 35 minutes.
[02:35:25.076 --> 02:35:34.600]  Then we confront Michael Moore and show how he actually helped Bush with Fahrenheit 9-11 by changing the argument over from the globalist did it to Bush is just an idiot.
[02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:42.524]  Then we spend an hour on 9-11, and people are already saying it's the best 9-11 film out there bar none, just that hour.
[02:35:43.244 --> 02:35:47.906]  Then the last hour, 15 minutes of it, is spent on Schwarzenegger
[02:35:48.872 --> 02:35:54.094]  And the Nazis and the Bushes and the Nazis and the Bohemian Grove with David Gergen.
[02:35:54.474 --> 02:35:57.175]  Connection of the Fool and Thule Society and the Nazis.
[02:35:57.455 --> 02:35:59.096]  We totally document the death cult.
[02:35:59.356 --> 02:36:00.217]  The great secret.
[02:36:00.257 --> 02:36:01.237]  What runs the world.
[02:36:01.517 --> 02:36:03.078]  Why they're so into death and destruction.
[02:36:03.358 --> 02:36:04.318]  Why they love evil.
[02:36:04.638 --> 02:36:05.579]  It's all explained.
[02:36:05.619 --> 02:36:06.399]  It's their religion.
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:11.301]  And the last ten minutes is Bushes
[02:36:13.909 --> 02:36:16.993]  Oath of Office, back in January 21st.
[02:36:17.213 --> 02:36:23.780]  And then we just show for ten minutes, he gives the oath, and for ten minutes we show how they're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:25.983]  Nice little mini-documentary for people.
[02:36:26.463 --> 02:36:32.690]  So it's really three big films in one, and a little mini-doc at the end.
[02:36:33.517 --> 02:36:36.059]  You gotta get this video.
[02:36:36.079 --> 02:36:37.120]  $25.95, well worth the price.
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:40.222]  Authorized to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:36:40.582 --> 02:36:41.322]  I want you to get it.
[02:36:41.362 --> 02:36:42.503]  I want you to make 10 copies.
[02:36:42.843 --> 02:36:43.684]  Give it to 10 people.
[02:36:43.744 --> 02:36:44.945]  Tell them to make 10 copies.
[02:36:47.407 --> 02:36:56.813]  The toll-free number to get this new film, Martial Law, or any of the other films I've made, any other big discounts we've got going right now, the books, the books on tape, the t-shirts,
[02:36:58.436 --> 02:36:59.417]  The toll-free number is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:36:59.437 --> 02:36:59.838]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:36:59.858 --> 02:37:01.800]  Or you can simply write to me.
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:03.141]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001.
[02:37:03.602 --> 02:37:03.902]  That's 3001.
[02:37:04.222 --> 02:37:06.925]  People always say I say that too fast.
[02:37:06.945 --> 02:37:06.985]  So, 3001.
[02:37:21.989 --> 02:37:27.873]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:37:28.254 --> 02:37:27.873]  78704.
[02:37:31.616 --> 02:37:36.580]  Or, go to Infowars.com and order any of the videos, watch free clips, read about them.
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.861]  We've got like a hundred reviews now.
[02:37:39.622 --> 02:37:40.443]  It's over a hundred.
[02:37:40.923 --> 02:37:44.846]  At PrisonPlanet.tv for the film, for people that have seen it online.
[02:37:45.746 --> 02:37:48.989]  Now I can get you reviews for those that get the hard copies we've been shipping out for a few days.
[02:37:49.722 --> 02:37:54.126]  So go to prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:37:54.547 --> 02:37:58.731]  That film, all my other films, 15 cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:37:59.031 --> 02:38:00.853]  You're crazy if you don't sign up with us.
[02:38:01.814 --> 02:38:04.757]  And I don't care if you share your passcode with one or two people.
[02:38:05.878 --> 02:38:07.459]  My goal is to get the word out.
[02:38:07.499 --> 02:38:07.860]  It's just...
[02:38:09.033 --> 02:38:12.175]  Then I've got to add more servers, and I have bandwidth problems.
[02:38:12.695 --> 02:38:14.096]  So don't share it with too many people.
[02:38:14.876 --> 02:38:17.257]  Just get the hard copies and make as many copies as you want.
[02:38:17.277 --> 02:38:19.599]  Because then I'm not paying for the bandwidth, please.
[02:38:21.299 --> 02:38:24.341]  A lot of folks have grabbed it off my website and put it on other sites.
[02:38:24.501 --> 02:38:24.901]  Whatever.
[02:38:25.422 --> 02:38:27.182]  I just want to get the information out.
[02:38:27.563 --> 02:38:32.005]  But at the same time, a few shekels in my pocket helps me fund the next film.
[02:38:33.034 --> 02:38:33.174]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:38:33.194 --> 02:38:40.738]  It's going to be a while until I make my money back on this sucker.
[02:38:41.239 --> 02:38:42.319]  It was very expensive.
[02:38:42.339 --> 02:38:47.002]  I could have made four or five of my other films with the money it took to make this.
[02:38:47.022 --> 02:38:47.622]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:38:48.102 --> 02:38:49.643]  Alright, that's it.
[02:38:50.083 --> 02:38:51.644]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[02:38:51.724 --> 02:38:53.845]  Martin Texas, thanks for holding for eons.
[02:38:54.205 --> 02:38:54.846]  You're on the air.
[02:38:55.366 --> 02:38:58.768]  Hey Alex, I was calling because another example of some
[02:38:59.557 --> 02:39:05.843]  Homeland security brutality actually occurred to a friend of mine that owns a small restaurant here in Houston.
[02:39:06.543 --> 02:39:24.340]  And he related a story to me the other week where he's had an immigrant who's been working to get legal citizenship for about 15 years, has probably spent about $30,000 in attorney's fees trying to work her way through the system,
[02:39:25.305 --> 02:39:30.627]  Well, the other day they were opening up the restaurant and Homeland Security came in and took her out.
[02:39:31.367 --> 02:39:35.989]  They came in, they didn't, at first they wouldn't even tell them what they were doing.
[02:39:36.029 --> 02:39:37.290]  They just came in and grabbed her.
[02:39:38.090 --> 02:39:44.432]  And this is an older guy, you know, he went and he stood in front of the door and he said, you know, you can't take this girl out of here without telling me what's going on.
[02:39:45.413 --> 02:39:49.474]  And they essentially said, you know, we're Homeland Security, you're being deported.
[02:39:50.275 --> 02:39:53.276]  She's a, I think she was either Romanian or Czechoslovakian.
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:57.404]  Well, it's almost impossible for Europeans to get into the U.S.
[02:39:57.424 --> 02:39:58.345]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:39:58.866 --> 02:40:02.650]  It's actually a racist policy by the globalists.
[02:40:02.730 --> 02:40:03.972]  Why, I have no idea.
[02:40:03.992 --> 02:40:07.396]  And, oh yeah, you didn't know Europeans can't get in here?
[02:40:08.477 --> 02:40:09.538]  It's almost impossible.
[02:40:10.019 --> 02:40:13.623]  He said they put her in a lake chain and cut.
[02:40:14.542 --> 02:40:19.827]  And the next thing he knew, the last time he heard anything about it was when he got the card from one of the homeless kids.
[02:40:19.847 --> 02:40:28.375]  Meanwhile, they give further visas to supposedly already dead hijackers and ordered the FBI to let them back into the country and ordered FBI agents to shut up.
[02:40:28.856 --> 02:40:30.598]  If you're a real terrorist, you're A-OK.
[02:40:30.738 --> 02:40:36.103]  Or if you're a crew of 100 illegal aliens building a house, man, you're not going to get touched.
[02:40:36.723 --> 02:40:37.945]  The cops just let you go.
[02:40:38.533 --> 02:40:42.136]  I think that's a perfect example of exactly what you're talking about.
[02:40:42.216 --> 02:40:50.304]  For a lot of me, I don't know why it is, but it's hard for Europeans to get in here.
[02:40:50.864 --> 02:40:54.468]  You can get in here if you have a job, but you get sent back right when the job's over with.
[02:40:54.948 --> 02:40:57.651]  But, I mean, literally, I've had congressmen on.
[02:40:57.731 --> 02:41:02.135]  It is admitted, it's like an unwritten rule, that they hit Europeans hard.
[02:41:03.345 --> 02:41:09.588]  Well, and to switch gears also, I wanted to ask you about the contest for ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:41:09.628 --> 02:41:11.729]  Yes, that's going to be being announced very soon.
[02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:16.131]  Well, I was going to ask you if you could give us a ballpark of how many entries you've had.
[02:41:16.151 --> 02:41:17.852]  I think like ten.
[02:41:18.912 --> 02:41:20.173]  I haven't had a very big response.
[02:41:21.213 --> 02:41:27.496]  Okay, well... And you know, that's why I extended it a few months, because I'm offering people
[02:41:28.257 --> 02:41:32.839]  I forget, what is it, $2,000 for the best video?
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:36.421]  $2,000 for the best video and $1,000 for the best radio spot.
[02:41:37.382 --> 02:41:38.842]  Have you turned one in?
[02:41:38.882 --> 02:41:40.463]  Yeah, I turned one in.
[02:41:40.523 --> 02:41:47.987]  I sent it in actually like a day after the original due date and I called in worried and Ryan told me that y'all had actually extended it.
[02:41:49.248 --> 02:41:52.009]  So now I've been doing some re-edits trying to clean it up.
[02:41:52.189 --> 02:41:53.970]  You better send it over quick.
[02:41:54.588 --> 02:41:59.289]  Well, I sent the original, but the original, it looks different on television compared to on the computer model.
[02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:00.350]  Yeah, we'll just send the new one.
[02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.430]  Okay.
[02:42:01.450 --> 02:42:02.370]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[02:42:02.410 --> 02:42:03.450]  I've got to go to other people now.
[02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.831]  Thank you.
[02:42:04.291 --> 02:42:06.591]  Uh, Bill, Bill in New York.
[02:42:06.631 --> 02:42:07.191]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:42:07.572 --> 02:42:11.133]  Okay, yeah, this is Bill from Oyster Bay, the home of Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:42:11.553 --> 02:42:20.355]  The reason why I'm calling you, I'm the one who called before about Easy Pass, where it's the Port Authority, which is New York and New Jersey.
[02:42:20.375 --> 02:42:22.896]  Yeah, 750, one bridge we drove across.
[02:42:23.536 --> 02:42:23.736]  Right.
[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:31.114]  And what I'm talking about is not just simply the price, but... Everywhere you go, they've got radio readers that can read it.
[02:42:31.634 --> 02:42:32.194]  Exactly.
[02:42:32.595 --> 02:42:40.879]  What bothers me also is, notice how three out of nine booths allow you to use cash because they want to make it so inconvenient.
[02:42:41.359 --> 02:42:43.000]  Well... Well, I mean, let me stop you.
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.743]  In Illinois, they said if you still pay cash, we're doubling the price.
[02:42:48.809 --> 02:42:53.010]  And they're saying they're going to phase it out entirely within two years.
[02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:56.191]  You will have to have the transponder chip.
[02:42:58.112 --> 02:43:07.894]  Yeah, and see the thing is, this is very terrifying because it means that your movements will be tracked and you'll have no privacy.
[02:43:07.974 --> 02:43:08.915]  Sir, do you have a cell phone?
[02:43:09.775 --> 02:43:10.155]  No, I don't.
[02:43:10.955 --> 02:43:17.957]  Every cell phone since 2001, my dad's got like a Motorola and it shows a crosshair on it when you're being tracked.
[02:43:18.642 --> 02:43:20.683]  And it triangulates with the cell towers.
[02:43:21.123 --> 02:43:22.164]  They can listen to you.
[02:43:22.604 --> 02:43:26.525]  The governor of Wisconsin wants to make it where the cops are listening all the time.
[02:43:26.965 --> 02:43:27.886]  That was in the newspaper.
[02:43:27.906 --> 02:43:29.747]  That's in, uh, Matrix of Evil.
[02:43:30.327 --> 02:43:32.108]  Actually, this is the end of it.
[02:43:32.188 --> 02:43:40.531]  This is literally, sir, literally GM, Saab, Toyota, they're all saying we're gonna have cameras watching us in the cars within five years.
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:43.020]  I'm not joking!
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:44.441]  Yeah, yeah, I'm with you.
[02:43:44.681 --> 02:43:46.041]  Look, I do have a cell phone.
[02:43:46.081 --> 02:43:48.242]  I thought you meant, well, am I on a cell phone?
[02:43:48.302 --> 02:43:48.442]  No.
[02:43:48.702 --> 02:43:57.045]  I have a Nokia, and it is from actually 1999, and I'm not going to trade it in for another one because I don't want to be tracked.
[02:43:58.485 --> 02:44:04.447]  But my point that I called on is that... Well, my point is that this stuff's going in everywhere.
[02:44:05.067 --> 02:44:05.767]  Right, right.
[02:44:06.207 --> 02:44:08.748]  See, on Long Island, there was a checkpoint.
[02:44:09.198 --> 02:44:33.595]  Where as I was getting off the Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway, in Woodbury, um, there was, the cops, they were stopping each car, and looking, and so what I did is I drove on past there, into a movie theater parking lot, I parked my car, and, there, where the guy is standing there, stopping, you can't tell that there is hidden a squad car right nearby.
[02:44:34.535 --> 02:44:36.817]  Um, I guess they figured that somebody may, you know, just,
[02:44:38.515 --> 02:45:01.661]  Well, the point you raise is actually in the National Seat Belt Initiative, 2.4 billion a year, that Clinton got funded in 98, it's actually in Police State 2000, and it says they're going to use the toll road money to build toll roads, but everybody will have a transponder chip, but there are going to be police in the toll roads and they will randomly shut it down and search all the cars.
[02:45:01.701 --> 02:45:07.223]  And it says, in the law, it will be a good excuse to search people.
[02:45:08.428 --> 02:45:10.750]  So, it'll be like German checkpoints everywhere.
[02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:11.931]  You think the airport's bad?
[02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:14.914]  You think you're not gonna fly to escape them groping your wife?
[02:45:15.434 --> 02:45:16.195]  Uh-uh-uh!
[02:45:16.235 --> 02:45:17.996]  The TSA's gonna train the police!
[02:45:19.157 --> 02:45:19.418]  Right.
[02:45:19.938 --> 02:45:34.891]  And, and the thing is, what I was thinking of doing is, for the sake of one of your documentaries, is for me to go up there with the camera team, and then, while they're doing the checkpoint, I go on over and say, hello, um, yes, you're doing a checkpoint.
[02:45:35.547 --> 02:45:47.857]  And we're doing a piece for a documentary, and I'd like to just show it, and then go on over to the precinct house, which is a walking distance of that, and then ask what's going on here.
[02:45:48.177 --> 02:45:53.121]  I was told they're checking for seatbelts, but the thing is... It's the National Seatbelt Initiative.
[02:45:53.441 --> 02:45:54.061]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:54.502 --> 02:45:59.385]  And then you'll hear in Texas, oh, the legislature wants to pass a law so they can have checkpoints.
[02:45:59.406 --> 02:45:59.906]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:46:00.306 --> 02:46:03.088]  Why do you have to pass a law if you've been doing it for decades?
[02:46:03.529 --> 02:46:04.990]  Because it's illegal!
[02:46:05.999 --> 02:46:07.580]  And it won't matter what law you pass.
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:09.522]  You can still pass a law saying you can do it.
[02:46:09.802 --> 02:46:11.843]  The Bill of Rights is above your law.
[02:46:12.283 --> 02:46:16.626]  Just like they passed laws saying black people weren't human beings.
[02:46:17.047 --> 02:46:18.728]  The Bill of Rights was still above that.
[02:46:19.208 --> 02:46:21.110]  Bush can declare himself God tomorrow.
[02:46:21.370 --> 02:46:22.330]  Hillary Clinton could.
[02:46:22.470 --> 02:46:23.051]  Arnold could.
[02:46:23.291 --> 02:46:24.632]  It doesn't make them God.
[02:46:24.872 --> 02:46:27.274]  They can claim you gotta wear green hats on Monday.
[02:46:27.514 --> 02:46:29.155]  Doesn't mean you gotta wear a green hat.
[02:46:29.755 --> 02:46:31.597]  But most people will follow their orders.
[02:46:33.727 --> 02:46:39.571]  And so, under quote, National Seat Belt Initiative, they funded the states to get them used to this.
[02:46:40.991 --> 02:46:42.813]  And it's funding to help put in checkpoints.
[02:46:44.834 --> 02:46:50.177]  But now it's, oh, we want to fund DUI checkpoints, because they want to codify it into law.
[02:46:50.577 --> 02:46:51.778]  They're criminals!
[02:46:53.019 --> 02:46:55.260]  Anyone that does that is a criminal!
[02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:57.261]  Now that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:46:58.222 --> 02:47:00.643]  That's what the Supreme Court until about 30 years ago said.
[02:47:01.123 --> 02:47:02.104]  It is criminal!
[02:47:02.873 --> 02:47:03.513]  What you're doing.
[02:47:04.113 --> 02:47:04.593]  And you know what?
[02:47:04.613 --> 02:47:07.154]  You're going to be an old man and old woman when it's happening to you.
[02:47:07.354 --> 02:47:08.694]  And it's happening to your grandchildren.
[02:47:08.914 --> 02:47:11.334]  And you're going to wish to God you've never been part of this.
[02:47:12.515 --> 02:47:14.315]  A warning to the wise is sufficient.
[02:47:15.675 --> 02:47:16.815]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:47:16.895 --> 02:47:17.716]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:47:17.776 --> 02:47:18.116]  Thank you.
[02:47:19.796 --> 02:47:20.196]  For calling.
[02:47:20.536 --> 02:47:20.756]  Alex.
[02:47:21.036 --> 02:47:21.256]  Yes.
[02:47:21.656 --> 02:47:23.837]  I'd like to hit several things real quick here.
[02:47:25.437 --> 02:47:28.898]  One, does Chris really know just how unpopular he is?
[02:47:29.058 --> 02:47:31.558]  Is the purpose of all this to keep him in the dark?
[02:47:32.492 --> 02:47:33.192]  Just a puppet.
[02:47:33.833 --> 02:47:37.775]  Also, I understand they brought back... Does who know how... Hold on, does who know how unpopular they are?
[02:47:38.075 --> 02:47:38.355]  Bush.
[02:47:39.416 --> 02:47:40.356]  Bush, does he really know?
[02:47:40.396 --> 02:47:42.577]  Bush says he doesn't read the newspaper and doesn't care!
[02:47:43.518 --> 02:47:45.639]  Okay, well, apparently they don't want him to know either.
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:53.563]  But, since he's simply a puppet, if he really knew what was going on, had some idea of the here and now, the real world.
[02:47:54.584 --> 02:47:59.146]  But, uh... They would allow, yeah, protesting where the Emperor can see it.
[02:47:59.487 --> 02:48:00.067]  Right, right.
[02:48:00.623 --> 02:48:05.166]  Also, I understand that they brought back a former spin doctor as the new propaganda minister.
[02:48:05.627 --> 02:48:07.928]  Yeah, she left Austin and is back up there.
[02:48:08.369 --> 02:48:10.230]  NBC News talked about that last night.
[02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:22.739]  They also talked about the fact that the Bush administration has spent $250 million so far on informational videos which are shown on local television as actual news pieces.
[02:48:22.779 --> 02:48:24.140]  These are produced by the government.
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.843]  Yeah, a year ago it was $76 million and the Congress said, stop, it's illegal.
[02:48:28.863 --> 02:48:30.164]  And you know what Bush said?
[02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:32.054]  Illegal?
[02:48:32.414 --> 02:48:33.354]  I am the law!
[02:48:34.175 --> 02:48:41.396]  You heard Ron Paul's office when he went to Germany, they were told, do not come out of your houses, do not go out on your balconies, do not look at him!
[02:48:41.716 --> 02:48:43.497]  He is the Messiah!
[02:48:45.717 --> 02:48:50.078]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.238 --> 02:48:54.680]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:59.181]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.221 --> 02:49:00.561]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.361 --> 02:49:02.102]  Hammered!
[02:49:02.363 --> 02:49:06.587]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.647 --> 02:49:13.595]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.695 --> 02:49:15.718]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.058 --> 02:49:26.605]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.705 --> 02:49:32.109]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:49:45.078 --> 02:49:47.059]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:49:47.139 --> 02:49:57.861]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.221 --> 02:50:02.762]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:02.822 --> 02:50:14.145]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:14.745 --> 02:50:21.609]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:21.989 --> 02:50:24.130]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:29.573]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:50:29.893 --> 02:50:36.203]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:36.283 --> 02:50:40.450]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:40.690 --> 02:50:41.451]  That's toll free.
[02:50:41.471 --> 02:50:41.511]  888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.906 --> 02:50:47.227]  I think so.
[02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:02.786]  I think so.

[02:51:45.493 --> 02:51:50.555]  Look, Bush isn't as dumb as they let on.
[02:51:54.236 --> 02:52:03.079]  They know that crowds of people always protesting him wherever he goes will make the general public that's very sheep-like go, oh, other people don't like him.
[02:52:03.419 --> 02:52:12.462]  But just the photo-op image always of him being supported, which no other politician has ever been allowed to have because we have freedom here, sends a different message.
[02:52:14.099 --> 02:52:15.220]  And that's what's happening here.
[02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:16.361]  But it isn't about Bush.
[02:52:16.381 --> 02:52:17.061]  He's just a puppet.
[02:52:17.101 --> 02:52:17.782]  He is a puppet.
[02:52:18.282 --> 02:52:19.823]  I don't think he's overtly stupid.
[02:52:20.444 --> 02:52:23.426]  He's a very cunning, rat-like creature.
[02:52:24.607 --> 02:52:25.588]  Him and all his boyfriends.
[02:52:26.348 --> 02:52:28.890]  But anything else real quick, Ron?
[02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:29.691]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:52:29.811 --> 02:52:36.616]  Also, Oklahoma Highway Patrol, DPS, and Homeland Security are trying to circle the Oklahoma Public Records Act.
[02:52:37.737 --> 02:52:40.659]  OHP wants to keep its dash cam
[02:52:41.465 --> 02:52:47.187]  Video record secret, and Homeland Security wants to keep their record secret.
[02:52:47.927 --> 02:52:57.830]  Also, the right-wing columnist, Cal Thomas, constantly carries on an emote about Threat Matrix and 24 in his column.
[02:52:57.870 --> 02:53:05.312]  Apparently the guy watches too much television and thinks the government should follow
[02:53:05.822 --> 02:53:13.129]  The patterns that we're seeing in these local... Well, no, those shows, sir, those shows mirror life because they admit that it's paid for by the government.
[02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:18.234]  You didn't, oh yeah, just like you mentioned 200 plus million for fake newscasts, it's now admitted.
[02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:20.356]  They're actually paying for those shows.
[02:53:20.416 --> 02:53:20.636]  Right.
[02:53:20.696 --> 02:53:22.858]  This guy is calthomas.com.
[02:53:22.898 --> 02:53:25.500]  He needs to hear the gospel according to Alex.
[02:53:25.601 --> 02:53:27.062]  Oh, look, Cal Thomas isn't stupid.
[02:53:27.679 --> 02:53:28.940]  Cal Thomas is a neocon.
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:29.940]  He's a fake conservative.
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.902]  They're to con real conservatives.
[02:53:31.922 --> 02:53:33.583]  This is, quote, how the liberals win.
[02:53:33.903 --> 02:53:36.384]  They pose as conservatives and sell us rat poison.
[02:53:37.205 --> 02:53:39.266]  And, uh, as a society.
[02:53:39.806 --> 02:53:42.908]  And so you're saying Cal Thomas just talks about how great torture is, huh?
[02:53:43.449 --> 02:53:49.572]  Well, not necessarily torture, but the programs, Threat Matrix and 24, how relevant they are to the real world here and now.
[02:53:49.892 --> 02:53:53.555]  Well, yeah, so he's advertising for the shows that promote torture every night.
[02:53:53.575 --> 02:53:54.115]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:54.699 --> 02:53:55.439]  That's what it's all about.
[02:53:55.539 --> 02:53:57.180]  Training you how to be evil like they are.
[02:53:57.980 --> 02:54:00.521]  Let's talk to... I ought to get Cal Thomas on.
[02:54:01.162 --> 02:54:02.722]  All these neocons make me sick.
[02:54:02.802 --> 02:54:03.763]  Ann Coulter, all of them.
[02:54:04.763 --> 02:54:07.104]  Let's talk to Dave in Delaware, then Gail in Texas.
[02:54:07.124 --> 02:54:07.684]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:54:09.905 --> 02:54:10.245]  Hello.
[02:54:10.525 --> 02:54:10.745]  Yes.
[02:54:11.265 --> 02:54:12.546]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:54:13.306 --> 02:54:17.188]  I'm calling in reference to the letters that I have sent to you.
[02:54:17.288 --> 02:54:22.770]  One of them just recently, and the other one was in reference to the petition to the churches to regress
[02:54:23.664 --> 02:54:25.625]  Grievances to the Delaware State News.
[02:54:26.886 --> 02:54:34.011]  I approached them again today, the second time, and I think I got to maybe the right party to have that letter printed.
[02:54:34.831 --> 02:54:47.499]  But also, I sent you a letter yesterday, the 14th, in reference to the Milford Public Library, placing your 9-1-1 road to tyranny video into the library.
[02:54:48.095 --> 02:54:49.236]  Oh, you got him to do that?
[02:54:49.396 --> 02:55:06.111]  Well, I took it to the president of the board, which is a general contractor here in Delaware, and I took it to him, met him at his office, gave it to him, and so you will receive a letter in a few days of that.
[02:55:08.384 --> 02:55:11.547]  Well, you've gone through a lot of trouble to do that, and I really appreciate it.
[02:55:11.607 --> 02:55:21.116]  Well, I even mentioned in there that I want to place as many as eleven videos into the library, and I have at least three or four others of yours that I want to place in there soon after.
[02:55:21.136 --> 02:55:22.157]  Well, they have to let you.
[02:55:22.197 --> 02:55:24.159]  Most libraries will go, oh yes, please.
[02:55:24.239 --> 02:55:25.380]  Some will act weird.
[02:55:26.041 --> 02:55:26.961]  Didn't you call before?
[02:55:26.981 --> 02:55:27.882]  Didn't you have some trouble?
[02:55:28.002 --> 02:55:28.503]  Yes, I did.
[02:55:30.073 --> 02:55:36.197]  The lady of the library said it would have to go through the board and they would select an isolated.
[02:55:36.237 --> 02:55:37.537]  I said that's discrimination.
[02:55:38.118 --> 02:55:41.300]  Alex is just as important to be in there.
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:42.300]  Yeah, people donate.
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:44.842]  Listen, I've got to hit this final call, but good job calling me back later.
[02:55:45.422 --> 02:55:46.443]  Gail, you've been holding forever.
[02:55:46.483 --> 02:55:47.384]  You've got 60 seconds.
[02:55:47.424 --> 02:55:48.584]  Gail in Texas, go ahead.
[02:55:49.145 --> 02:55:57.030]  Alex, International News First Today on DirecTV had the story about the meeting in Canada for open borders from Canada to Panama.
[02:55:57.645 --> 02:56:00.892]  With common ID, common police force in case of emergency.
[02:56:01.453 --> 02:56:05.522]  And they're getting complaints from residents, from Canadians and Mexicans.
[02:56:06.388 --> 02:56:10.210]  And that's International News First, and it was the Canadian Broadcasting Company.
[02:56:10.350 --> 02:56:11.611]  Wow, can you send that to me?
[02:56:12.031 --> 02:56:13.632]  I've tried to find it on the internet.
[02:56:13.712 --> 02:56:14.272]  I will look it up.
[02:56:14.292 --> 02:56:17.173]  Well, a few weeks ago it was in one of their big newspapers.
[02:56:17.253 --> 02:56:18.234]  They were real mad about it.
[02:56:18.514 --> 02:56:19.355]  Isn't that funny, though?
[02:56:19.375 --> 02:56:22.756]  The Mexicans and the Canadians are smarter than Americans.
[02:56:22.836 --> 02:56:23.577]  Yes, it is.
[02:56:23.657 --> 02:56:27.619]  And I find it funny, too, that they want to use TV tags at the Mexican border.
[02:56:28.479 --> 02:56:30.360]  Well, that's because they're going to be totally legal, my dear.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:30.760]  Right.
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:31.621]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:31.641 --> 02:56:32.861]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:32.901 --> 02:56:33.562]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
