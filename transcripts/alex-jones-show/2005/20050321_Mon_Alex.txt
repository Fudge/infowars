[00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.857]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:13.598]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.902]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:39.518]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.200]  It's already Monday, the 21st day of March 2005.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.821]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.581]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.642 --> 00:01:01.327]  We got Greg Siminski, writer for American Free Press and documentary filmmaker coming on with us in the second hour via cell phone from a courtroom or outside a courtroom.
[00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:09.476]  He has been researching 9-11 for quite a while and has come out with a very interesting report that we've now investigated.
[00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:22.686]  And we're going to be having the individual who worked for the Pentagon, and still works for the Pentagon, on very soon as well, the perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers created in 1976.
[00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:23.767]  And it was an Army plan
[00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:37.000]  A drill of hijackers taking over a plane with box cutters and flying them into the World Trade Centers.
[00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:44.963]  And the Pentagon specifically told the Army, do this drill in 76 specifically with the World Trade Centers.
[00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:52.705]  Now, you ask yourselves, why would they tell their own military planners to come up with this?
[00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.706]  Because most of the planning that's engaged in is compartmentalized.
[00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.112]  And it can later be covered as, oh, it was just a drill.
[00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:19.363]  What the globalists do is they give hundreds of top think tank experts these quote scenarios that came out right before 9-11 that $40 million a year was spent in Hollywood paying Hollywood top script writers to just write scripts of different terror attacks.
[00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:24.126]  Quote, to see what the minds of terrorists might be like.
[00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:32.221]  But of course, many of those scripts we then find are actual terrorist attacks down to the specifics of what happens.
[00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:43.326]  And this works perfectly because it can be a terrorist manual for the black op squads inside the New World Order, and then if they ever get caught, oh that was just a movie script!
[00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:47.027]  Very, very serious.
[00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:51.589]  And Paul Watson's comment on this that he wrote over the American Free Press article says,
[00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:58.207]  If completely confirmed 100% then this is the smoking gun over and above Northwoods.
[00:02:58.368 --> 00:02:59.469]  That was the official U.S.
[00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.771]  government plan to carry out 9-11 attacks.
[00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:04.753]  The NORAD stand down the explosives in the buildings.
[00:03:05.214 --> 00:03:06.795]  Any other piece of 9-11 evidence.
[00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:11.079]  It's going to be interesting to see how they pass this one off as a coincidence.
[00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.141]  We need to get this on the news wires immediately.
[00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.104]  This is the straw that could break the camel's back.
[00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:26.589]  And, uh, these harsh, uh, analysis comes from Timothy McNiven, an outspoken critic of the President's handling of 9-11, and a 29-year U.S.
[00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.210]  Defense Department operative still under contract with the government.
[00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:42.895]  And, uh, he's got his website up, he's got all the documents, he's suing the government over this, he's taken lie detector tests, and, uh, look, I mean, we already knew they'd... I have the 1999 FEMA report on terrorism.
[00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:49.943]  That's in the extra section of Road to Tyranny.
[00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.263]  And I show it!
[00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:55.684]  And it shows crosshairs right on the towers, right where they got hit.
[00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:58.324]  I mean, that's the cover of it.
[00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.845]  Tom Clancy's best-selling book about it.
[00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:09.487]  Lone Gunman episodes with the government hijacks jets to fly them into the World Trade Center for martial law and to invade Afghanistan.
[00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:12.422]  They love flaunting it.
[00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.343]  And then Bush says, we never heard of such a plan.
[00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:24.445]  No, you just ran drills that day, two weeks before, six months before, and on November 3rd of 2000, years before.
[00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:35.688]  The exact type planes hitting the exact same targets, and then magically at the exact same time that it's really happening, you're running a drill!
[00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:38.509]  Yes, and I'm an Easter Bunny from Planet 12!
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.341]  It's impossible!
[00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:43.303]  They did it!
[00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:44.704]  Period!
[00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:52.732]  And they had it from a commissioned study they had done by some of their war gamers in 1976.
[00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:57.436]  PrisonPlanet.tv is one of the websites.
[00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:57.997]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:08.139]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.801]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.203]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:14.445]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:19.650]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.015]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:26.037]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:36.766]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:38.807]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.028 --> 00:05:42.891]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:44.252]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:48.376]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:04.159]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:13.330]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.316]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:25.521]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:37.670]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.634]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:45.116]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:48.318]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:49.839]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:50.940]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:03.943]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:08.525]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:15.687]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:22.735]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:26.539]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:27.480]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.
[00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:38.787]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:45.550]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.431]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:53.152]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:57.954]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the Bio-Ox family of products.
[00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:06.283]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:08.004]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:09.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.305]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:17.367]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:21.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:27.633]  Eight minutes, thirty seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:30.436]  It is Monday, 21st day of March 2005.
[00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:32.557]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:45.607]  The websites are infowars.com, because there's a war on for your mind, and prisonplanet.com, because if we don't expose the New World Order, we're all going to live in a giant prison planet control group.
[00:08:45.627 --> 00:08:49.410]  This broadcast is not left-wing or right-wing.
[00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.351]  We love freedom.
[00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:51.512]  We love human dignity.
[00:08:52.176 --> 00:09:01.302]  We love decency and honor and we know that the Global Crime Syndicate is totally evil and is openly building a worldwide slave grid.
[00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:06.405]  Bush signs a bill that may let Shivo live!
[00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:08.667]  Which is good!
[00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:10.968]  And now people are saying, praise Bush!
[00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:17.313]  Maybe he's against guns and maybe he's for open borders and increasing UN funding and ballooning the budget.
[00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:19.234]  But, under pressure,
[00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:27.330]  Why he's signed a bill that may allow her to live and kicks it to a federal court, now up to a judge to decide.
[00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:35.958]  But, you know, I've had Terry Shivo Schindler's family on many times.
[00:09:36.078 --> 00:09:38.881]  I've been talking about this for, I don't know, almost four years now.
[00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:43.205]  And she's had her feeding tube taken out since Friday.
[00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:43.966]  It's horrible.
[00:09:45.703 --> 00:09:50.006]  First they said she was brain-dead, a vegetable for years, then we proved she wasn't.
[00:09:50.767 --> 00:09:52.628]  Now they just call her brain-damaged.
[00:09:53.669 --> 00:10:07.720]  And we got Wesley Smith from the Wall Street Journal coming on tomorrow because I want to talk about the hundreds of people who were openly talking, saying, may I please have food, may I please have water, who they're killing all over this country, who we should also be concerned about.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.805]  But this is good that everybody's come basically out of every corner of the country and the world
[00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:18.205]  To say this is wrong, so we'll talk about that.
[00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:19.905]  Terry's there right now.
[00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.046]  You imagine not having a drink of water for three days.
[00:10:24.506 --> 00:10:28.527]  She's now, this afternoon, she'll be three days into this.
[00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:34.449]  And last time, what, she was off food and water for almost nine days.
[00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:42.891]  And back then, that was a couple years ago, it was only in a few newspapers, and Larry King finally talked about it, but it didn't get one
[00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:48.492]  Tenth the amount of coverage, not even one, really one hundredth.
[00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:51.014]  I mean, this is like one of the top stories right now.
[00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:53.355]  And it is important.
[00:10:55.557 --> 00:10:58.699]  Our hearts go out to the family of Terry Schindler.
[00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:01.140]  You really shouldn't call her Shivo.
[00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:04.082]  Shivo's been with another woman for ten years.
[00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:07.344]  He's got two children with this other woman.
[00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:10.306]  That right there is abandonment.
[00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:13.008]  I mean, if a man leaves his family for two weeks,
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.041]  Doesn't give him support.
[00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:17.522]  He's automatically, you know, the woman can divorce him.
[00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:25.527]  If this was anybody else, they would have taken custody away from Mr. Cockroach.
[00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:26.848]  Mr. Shibo.
[00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:27.928]  I'm sorry if your name's Shibo.
[00:11:27.968 --> 00:11:29.149]  I shouldn't call that name Cockroach.
[00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.790]  It's a good Italian name, I guess.
[00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.633]  But her real name is Schindler.
[00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:43.057]  And look, I mean, imagine if parents didn't feed their child for a week, the government would take the children and they should.
[00:11:44.143 --> 00:11:46.844]  Imagine if you tried to not feed an animal for a week.
[00:11:47.664 --> 00:11:50.625]  Or not give your horse water or your dog water for a week.
[00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.306]  You would get in trouble.
[00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:52.806]  You should.
[00:11:53.926 --> 00:11:54.526]  It's cruelty.
[00:11:55.427 --> 00:12:10.451]  But under the bioethics laws written up by people like Peter Singer, who speaks to the Governor's conferences and is at Princeton, old people are worthless, retarded children are subhuman, and babies up until two years of age are considered macro.
[00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:12.272]  Macro.
[00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:14.134]  Those are his terms.
[00:12:14.194 --> 00:12:16.895]  Subhuman, worthless, and mackerel.
[00:12:17.735 --> 00:12:27.077]  And he is the man who's written the predominant bioethics handbooks used by most of your hospitals and care facilities.
[00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:34.099]  They're not care facilities anymore because they don't even call them that in many cases and they don't even give a Hippocratic Oath.
[00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:40.380]  They don't even give an oath that they will do no harm
[00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.189]  They decide if you have a life worth living.
[00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.430]  So why didn't they just kill Christopher Reeves?
[00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:55.452]  Why didn't they take the food and water away from Helen Keller?
[00:12:56.893 --> 00:13:01.034]  Why don't they go kill physicist Stephen Hawking?
[00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:03.675]  Who can't talk and can't move.
[00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.096]  Can't even click his mouse anymore.
[00:13:09.157 --> 00:13:10.437]  Why don't they just kill him?
[00:13:11.405 --> 00:13:17.627]  Take him and strap him down and not give him any water for 14 days is what it normally takes.
[00:13:18.107 --> 00:13:21.929]  It is, by the way, you can, this is in the medical handbooks we've got medical doctors on.
[00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:24.570]  There is no debating it.
[00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:31.472]  The most painful way to kill someone, one of the most gruesome forms of torture used over the last 3,000 years is denying water.
[00:13:36.218 --> 00:13:40.460]  Your tongue, after about six, seven days, begins to blacken, begins to crack and bleed.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.401]  The water leaves your skin, goes to the core organs.
[00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:45.362]  You begin bleeding profusely.
[00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:49.144]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:52.765]  This is our compassion.
[00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:53.906]  This is our right to die.
[00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:59.648]  And Shivo now went on Larry King Live again Friday and said, oh no, it's my wish that this happened.
[00:13:59.928 --> 00:14:01.289]  We never knew what her wishes were.
[00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:02.810]  He really slipped up.
[00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.290]  These people
[00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:06.223]  Uh, always slip up on their own.
[00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:08.504]  They finally speak the truth.
[00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:10.885]  The King just glazed over it.
[00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:15.667]  Of course, she had gotten this position under very questionable circumstances.
[00:14:15.727 --> 00:14:20.369]  And Mr. Schiavo, as soon as, um... Well, he tricked the family.
[00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:21.590]  Oh, I want to take care of her.
[00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.672]  Oh, I just sued him over not giving her proper care when she got to the hospital.
[00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.313]  She wasn't given proper care for, like, three days.
[00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:32.755]  It turned out he'd been involved in making sure that happened.
[00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:37.367]  He then won over a million dollars with 1.3 mil.
[00:14:40.068 --> 00:14:42.470]  And about $400,000 of that has been spent on her.
[00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.252]  He won't allow her to have any baths, brush her teeth.
[00:14:47.772 --> 00:14:49.533]  She was eating food ten years ago.
[00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:51.294]  He won't allow her to eat food.
[00:14:51.554 --> 00:14:52.595]  She can eat food, folks!
[00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:53.995]  You put jello in her mouth, she'll eat it!
[00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:56.737]  Boy, that's a vegetable for ya!
[00:14:57.317 --> 00:15:01.339]  Smiles at her mommy, follows a balloon left and right, smiles, cries, likes music.
[00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:04.296]  Rose Fitz when her mother and father leave.
[00:15:05.336 --> 00:15:06.356]  Hates Shivo.
[00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:08.057]  Looks at him with hatred.
[00:15:08.937 --> 00:15:09.437]  I would too.
[00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:12.939]  I didn't want to allow him to do any brain scans on her.
[00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:19.641]  They did some of the EKGs decades ago, over a decade ago, and she had a lot of brain activity.
[00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:24.223]  But this is how they operate.
[00:15:24.343 --> 00:15:29.624]  Once he's got them, tricked them to sign over everything to him, literally he went,
[00:15:32.338 --> 00:15:32.999]  So that's it.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.780]  No more care.
[00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:37.863]  So she's been through a decade of living hell.
[00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:43.309]  And, you know, Stalin said an evil genius that he was.
[00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:45.671]  When one person dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:49.294]  The actual quote is, when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:51.477]  When 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:52.538]  And so,
[00:15:53.547 --> 00:15:54.968]  Again, I do care about Terry.
[00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.249]  I've been on this for four years.
[00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.552]  People have been emailing me all last week going, why aren't you talking more about this?
[00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:00.492]  Well, I mean, I have been.
[00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:02.334]  I've been covering what's going on with it.
[00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:07.037]  And we're going to have Wesley Smith on tomorrow to talk about people that are actually asking for food.
[00:16:07.398 --> 00:16:08.238]  May I please have food?
[00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:10.060]  Like this, may I please have some water, honey?
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.364]  And the nurses that get caught giving them water are fired and they go ahead and kill the people.
[00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:19.367]  So, if you want to be upset about something, you can be upset about that too.
[00:16:20.962 --> 00:16:24.504]  You know, the media is giving us so much attention, and I knew why they were going to do it.
[00:16:24.544 --> 00:16:25.764]  I said it about two weeks ago.
[00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:31.607]  So Bush could flutter into the rescue, just like Jeb Bush did, and make it look like he's a good guy.
[00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:33.368]  This is what evil people do.
[00:16:33.408 --> 00:16:38.750]  They do some good, and do these photo ops, to then bind you to them.
[00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:48.915]  You know, Bush cuts $87 million in abortion funding, and then increases total abortion funding by $3 billion in the last four years.
[00:16:51.753 --> 00:16:53.934]  So, uh, you should be aware of that.
[00:16:56.096 --> 00:17:02.600]  It's good that you deserve the credit for pressuring Bush and pressuring all these people to do this.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.501]  And what are the details?
[00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.622]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:17:07.122 --> 00:17:09.624]  Bush signs a bill that may let Schiavo live.
[00:17:09.644 --> 00:17:21.111]  Harry Schiavo, again Schindler, parents won the chance to plea for their daughter's life in a federal court when an extraordinary law passed in an emergency session of Congress
[00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:25.342]  That saw lawmakers choosing sides in an emotional family battle.
[00:17:26.563 --> 00:17:29.446]  Well, this, uh, Mr. Schiavo isn't family.
[00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:30.867]  He abandoned her.
[00:17:31.448 --> 00:17:44.541]  President Bush signed the law almost immediately after its passage early Monday, vowing in a statement to stand on the side of those defending life for all Americans, including those with disabilities.
[00:17:46.187 --> 00:17:55.529]  In cases like this one, where there are serious questions and substantial doubts, our society, our laws, and our courts should have a presumption in favor of life.
[00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.410]  The Emperor said.
[00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:04.351]  The law gave Schiavo's parents the right to file suit in federal court over the withdrawal of nourishment and medical treatment.
[00:18:04.611 --> 00:18:11.013]  And there should be an injunction right now, needed to sustain the daughter who suffered severe brain damage.
[00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:13.974]  She no longer is a vegetable, now it's severe brain damage.
[00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:14.854]  Which it's not.
[00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:16.633]  She's paralyzed, folks.
[00:18:17.374 --> 00:18:21.579]  A lawyer... I mean, I know people who've been in comas for five years that come out of it.
[00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:25.643]  Some woman who was in one, like, twenty-something years woke up and was having a great life walking around.
[00:18:25.964 --> 00:18:27.626]  My uncle was in a coma for six weeks.
[00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:29.067]  They wanted to kill him.
[00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:36.035]  Now he's got two great children, happily married, and, you know, goes out and rides the fence line every morning.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:47.063]  A lawyer for the parents arrived at Federal District Court in Tampa, Florida, not long after Lord Butch signed the bill and filed a request for an emergency injunction to keep Shibo fed.
[00:18:48.023 --> 00:18:53.825]  Her husband, who is not her husband, says Shibo told him that she wouldn't want to be kept alive in a vegetable state.
[00:18:55.826 --> 00:18:57.306]  She's not in a vegetative state.
[00:18:57.907 --> 00:18:58.227]  Okay?
[00:18:58.687 --> 00:19:05.449]  Her parents and many of the lawmakers back the effort to restore the feeding tube, say she needs treatment and another opportunity for life.
[00:19:06.471 --> 00:19:11.972]  Tonight we have given Terri Schiavo all we could, a chance to live, said House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Republican, Texas.
[00:19:12.492 --> 00:19:16.833]  After four days of words, the best of them uttered in prayer.
[00:19:17.934 --> 00:19:21.114]  Congress has acted, and a life may be saved.
[00:19:21.214 --> 00:19:28.856]  The bill passed the House early Monday, that's today, after an often wrenching debate that stretched past midnight.
[00:19:30.234 --> 00:19:37.059]  It won the backing of virtually all the Republicans and almost half the Democrats who sprinted back to the Capitol for the debate.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.043]  While 174 of the House's 435 elected members did not vote.
[00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:47.907]  Meanwhile, 70% of Americans say Congress' action was inappropriate.
[00:19:47.927 --> 00:19:49.749]  That's because you're so dumbed down.
[00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.810]  Congress is above the courts.
[00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:54.953]  Congress is more powerful than the executive and
[00:19:56.858 --> 00:19:57.479]  It's a judicial.
[00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.299]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:03.743]  All water isn't the same.
[00:20:04.023 --> 00:20:09.046]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:20:09.286 --> 00:20:11.888]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:20.614]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:20:20.994 --> 00:20:29.439]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a higher vibration state.

[00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:04.190]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:08.973]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:15.037]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:21:15.277 --> 00:21:19.340]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:25.263]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:21:25.383 --> 00:21:28.005]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:33.989]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:36.431]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:39.052]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:21:39.433 --> 00:21:43.055]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:49.740]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.181]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:51.941]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.981 --> 00:21:52.221]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.343 --> 00:22:10.409]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:21.896]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:27.940]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:34.846]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:35.046 --> 00:22:41.872]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:43.914]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[00:22:44.174 --> 00:22:46.236]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:52.801]  803-4438.
[00:22:52.821 --> 00:22:56.122]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:56.322 --> 00:22:58.502]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:22:59.783 --> 00:23:00.823]  Are you losing your hair?
[00:23:01.163 --> 00:23:02.603]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[00:23:02.943 --> 00:23:04.083]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[00:23:04.604 --> 00:23:06.264]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[00:23:06.484 --> 00:23:11.065]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[00:23:11.445 --> 00:23:14.446]  I've been using Avocor now for four months and it's a great product.
[00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:16.646]  They back everything with a money-back guarantee.
[00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:17.726]  It works!
[00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:20.627]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[00:23:22.123 --> 00:23:26.946]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:30.849]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.

[00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:42.256]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.342]  Call now for your free month's supply.
[00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:51.762]  Call 1-800-548-5910.
[00:23:51.802 --> 00:23:52.123]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:17.460]  The perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers created by the Pentagon in 1976.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.561]  The tales are coming up.
[00:24:20.062 --> 00:24:22.663]  Russian intelligence chief says Al Qaeda a myth.
[00:24:23.784 --> 00:24:28.147]  Bush administration blacks out Clinton documents protecting Bill Clinton as usual.
[00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:30.088]  That of the AP.
[00:24:30.128 --> 00:24:34.631]  Guantanamo abuse tape as explosive as Abu Ghraib.
[00:24:34.651 --> 00:24:38.113]  We already knew that, but they're not going to release the video.
[00:24:39.602 --> 00:24:48.409]  Also, scans that read your mind fuel ethical worries, as more and more government systems prepare to put brain scanners.
[00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:50.430]  Already four airports have this.
[00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:54.614]  And in calls for bold changes to UN, i.e.
[00:24:55.474 --> 00:24:56.235]  expansions.
[00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:02.039]  An interesting article, Don't Let Your Constitution Go to the Dogs, about checkpoints.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.684]  More on Mr. Wolfowitz, to be your new World Bank head.
[00:25:09.511 --> 00:25:10.892]  And of course, your calls.
[00:25:11.232 --> 00:25:35.667]  Just on the Terry Schindler case, you know, or Schiavo, here's a comment by one of the Republican congressmen, and I think he said it best, now he has her on a feeding tube, talking about Schiavo, removed and sentenced her to a most excruciating death, citing Terry's own wishes as the rationales of Representative Jim
[00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:38.994]  I guess that's R-Y-U-N.
[00:25:39.014 --> 00:25:40.595]  Is that run?
[00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:42.276]  Republican Kansas.
[00:25:42.476 --> 00:25:53.484]  Michael did not remember this supposed request until years after Terry's initial injuries, when a cash settlement was awarded to her, a settlement he would stand to inherit.
[00:25:55.845 --> 00:26:02.330]  And a few Democrats lobbed accusations at Republicans that political motives drove their passion for Schiavo and her patients.
[00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.271]  And her parents.
[00:26:05.874 --> 00:26:07.695]  Well, I mean, in a way that's true.
[00:26:07.735 --> 00:26:09.495]  I mean, Bush is getting involved in this.
[00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:10.716]  His brother got involved.
[00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:15.498]  They support the bioethics groups that are out pushing this stuff.
[00:26:15.538 --> 00:26:19.039]  They support the abortion in their actions, not in their rhetoric.
[00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.320]  They support the culture of death.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.503]  But because of the pressure that you and others, the listeners out there, have put on them, they're doing the right thing.
[00:26:31.954 --> 00:26:34.856]  So we'll continue to talk about this a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:26:34.936 --> 00:26:38.459]  Of course, you're welcome to discuss it and talk about it if you'd like.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.802]  Now let's plunge into the latest 9-11 developments.
[00:26:43.603 --> 00:26:45.064]  This is out of American Free Press.
[00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:49.907]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[00:26:50.107 --> 00:26:50.688]  Please get it.
[00:26:51.228 --> 00:26:53.810]  Spread it to people on the internet.
[00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.051]  It's very important.
[00:26:56.661 --> 00:27:01.024]  The perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers created in 1976.
[00:27:02.365 --> 00:27:02.986]  Our own U.S.
[00:27:03.126 --> 00:27:12.033]  Army devised a plan commissioned by Congress to bring down the WTC using commercial airliners and box cutters as weapons.
[00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:18.258]  Just like Congress commissioned a million dollar study of how to mail weaponized anthrax through the mail in 1999.
[00:27:18.498 --> 00:27:22.741]  They always openly fund it.
[00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:40.456]  The laundry list of terrorist warnings handed to the Bush administration prior to 9-11 makes the President and others look like bumbling idiots or a bunch of conniving criminals responsible for the mass murders of the Twin Towers and in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:27:41.417 --> 00:27:48.821]  These are the harsh words of Timothy McNiven, an outspoken critic of the President's handling of 9-11 and a 29-year U.S.
[00:27:48.861 --> 00:27:52.844]  Department, Defense Department operative still under contract with the government.
[00:27:54.139 --> 00:28:17.608]  He says, not only did Bush administration purposely and purposely ignore Al Qaeda in the months preceding the WTC attacks, but the situation is even more disturbing, considering his military unit way back in 1976 devised a mock terror attack on the Twin Towers exactly like what occurred on 9-11.
[00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:25.556]  It's like the super secret weapons dossier proving Saddam and weapons of mass destruction that uh...
[00:28:26.676 --> 00:28:32.340]  Colin Powell, held up in front of the UN, turned out to be 12 years old, written by a graduate student.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.702]  The globalists are so lazy, they just pick and choose stuff.
[00:28:36.143 --> 00:28:55.076]  McNiven, who first went public in an affidavit included in a 9-11 related federal conspiracy RICO lawsuit filed against President Bush and others in 2004, claims his unit was ordered to create the perfect terrorist plan, close quote, using commercial airliners as weapons and the Twin Towers as the target.
[00:28:56.235 --> 00:29:07.718]  The publicized version of the study, commissioned by Congress, was to identify security lapses and submit corrective measures to the lawmakers.
[00:29:07.758 --> 00:29:17.141]  However, McNiven claims the real purpose of the study was to brainstorm on how to pull off a perfect terrorist attack using the exact same 9-11 scenario.
[00:29:18.702 --> 00:29:21.322]  The study commissioned by C-Battery,
[00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:26.927]  Battalion 81st Field Artillery U.S.
[00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:40.998]  Army stationed in Strasbourg, Germany in 1976 specifically devised a scenario of the Twin Towers being leveled by Middle Eastern terrorists using commercial airliners and even plastic box cutters to bypass security.
[00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.881]  We'll finish up with this article.
[00:29:43.941 --> 00:29:44.721]  I'll comment on it.

[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.805]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.186 --> 00:32:27.291]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:28.652]  There are no side effects.

[00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:39.578]  The publicized version of the study talking about another government drill, another government study of attacking the World Trade Center with hijacked jets, hijacked by men with box cutters, specifically box cutters, 1976.
[00:33:41.829 --> 00:33:42.810]  See, these are scripts.
[00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.211]  These are just the public stories.
[00:33:45.032 --> 00:33:52.659]  The publicized version of the study, commissioned by Congress, was to identify security lapses and submit corrective measures to lawmakers.
[00:33:52.679 --> 00:34:00.726]  However, McNibin claims the real purpose of the study was to brainstorm on how to pull off the perfect terrorist attack using the exact same 9-11 scenario.
[00:34:01.287 --> 00:34:03.429]  The study commissioned by C. Battery 281
[00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.058]  Field Artillery, U.S.
[00:34:07.639 --> 00:34:09.722]  Army, is stationed in Strasbourg, Germany, in 76.
[00:34:09.782 --> 00:34:20.838]  Specifically, it devises a scenario of the Twin Towers being leveled by Middle Eastern terrorists using commercial airliners and even plastic box cutters to bypass security.
[00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:33.553]  To silence critics, McNiven has successfully passed a credible lie detector test regarding his participation in the study, as well as other specific orders given to him by his superiors in case of a real attack on the Twin Towers.
[00:34:34.234 --> 00:34:35.515]  And he's released the documents.
[00:34:36.175 --> 00:34:50.045]  The head of the 1976 mock terrorist plan was Lieutenant Michael Teague of Long Island, who McNiven says was given specific orders by higher-ups of the military to use the Twin Towers as the terrorist target.
[00:34:50.894 --> 00:35:00.662]  McNiven said he was, uh, been unable to contact Lieutenant Teague, but was interested in his opinion now that the 9-11 attacks happened the way we planned them in 76.
[00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:16.174]  I remember Lieutenant Teague changed the scenario of the supposed study from 100-story building to the Twin Towers, recalled McNiven, emphasizing what Lieutenant Teague was acting on specific orders from unknown superiors.
[00:35:17.088 --> 00:35:23.450]  He then said he thought it was very strange to be asked to devise a plan to blow up your own hometown.
[00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:31.153]  But as I watched the Twin Towers really collapse on the morning of September 11th, I realized I was watching the very same thing we devised in 1976.
[00:35:31.593 --> 00:35:40.216]  Since that ominous realization, McNiven has devoted his entire life to alerting the American public about the similarities between 9-11 and the 1976 study without much success.
[00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:45.020]  Hey buddy, we just learned of it.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.682]  Don't worry, people are going to hear about it now.
[00:35:47.222 --> 00:35:50.685]  His story basically being ignored by politicians and the mainstream media.
[00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:52.326]  Why am I doing this?
[00:35:52.426 --> 00:35:56.229]  Why have I spent every waking hour trying to bring this story to the American people?
[00:35:56.649 --> 00:35:57.370]  Ask MacNiven.
[00:35:58.811 --> 00:36:04.455]  Claiming he still is following a strange direct military order given to him more than 25 years ago.
[00:36:06.044 --> 00:36:10.549]  During the course of the terrorist plan we were devising, I made the statement to Lt.
[00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:16.074]  Teague that if the WTC was ever attacked like we planned, I'd go public.
[00:36:16.555 --> 00:36:22.581]  I was then physically assaulted and told never to reveal anything we were doing regarding the Twin Towers.
[00:36:23.644 --> 00:36:26.426]  However, about a week later, a strange turn of events occurred.
[00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:30.528]  For no apparent reason, McNiven claims his superiors completely changed their minds.
[00:36:31.048 --> 00:36:40.674]  I was given the direct order that if the Twin Towers were ever attacked, the way we discussed in the 76th study, I was to do everything in my power to bring the similarities to the attention of the American people.
[00:36:41.254 --> 00:36:46.837]  Well, that's because higher-ups were upset about the plan and did want you to go public.
[00:36:48.857 --> 00:36:55.964]  I have no idea why they changed their minds, but I was then emphatically told that this order was never to be rescinded.
[00:36:56.224 --> 00:36:56.545]  Never!
[00:36:56.985 --> 00:37:01.669]  Because those who would rescind it would be the very same people who turned against the American people.
[00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.153]  Besides taking a lot of technical to verify his story, McNiven,
[00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:21.318]  has made public a detailed list of about 40 names of individuals who took part in the mock terrorist plan including Colonel Robert Morrison, Major Joe DiPrio, Sergeant Middleton, Sergeant Arroyo, and many others.
[00:37:22.014 --> 00:37:26.059]  There were also people from the Defense Department and the CIA who were monitoring the study.
[00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:28.442]  But I wasn't able to get their names, he added.
[00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:34.388]  Some of McNiven's most recent assignments with the Defense Department included work on the Northwest Drug Task Force.
[00:37:34.889 --> 00:37:37.993]  That's right, the militaries involved in America, folks.
[00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:41.537]  And various other drug smuggling and weapons trafficking cases.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:54.688]  Very credible, and I was talking to the reporter, Greg Simenski, who's going to be joining us, and then later in the week we're going to be getting Mr. McNiven on.
[00:37:56.209 --> 00:38:01.694]  Greg Simenski's gotten some of the documents, and we're going to get all those up on the web.
[00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:08.079]  Now, I'm about 90% sure this case is real.
[00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:09.760]  It frankly doesn't really matter.
[00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:13.617]  We have the admitted official U.S.
[00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:16.500]  government plan, Operation Northwoods.
[00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:25.666]  And Operation Northwoods is confirmed, is public, ABC News, Baltimore Sun, Associated Press, Reuters, London Guardian.
[00:38:26.507 --> 00:38:31.351]  We have copies of it in all three of my 9-11 films, including the new one.
[00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:37.215]  And it says, we'll hijack jets by remote control, crash them, we'll bomb D.C., commit sniper attacks,
[00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.853]  We'll attack Marine Corps bases with our own troops, blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:38:42.593 --> 00:38:46.196]  We'll kill astronauts or let them die and then blame it on foreigners.
[00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:57.986]  And then we have the LBJ tapes released about a year and a half ago from right here in Austin at the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum.
[00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:05.852]  I found articles back in 64 in the San Diego Papers and others where it came out that our ships
[00:39:06.471 --> 00:39:08.471]  We're never attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:39:10.572 --> 00:39:16.193]  And so we knew this, and we knew that this had been in the news, but now we have the two different tapes.
[00:39:16.593 --> 00:39:17.373]  I've aired them here.
[00:39:17.393 --> 00:39:18.914]  They're on the website.
[00:39:19.614 --> 00:39:22.734]  Directly from the LBJ Library website.
[00:39:24.115 --> 00:39:25.355]  Presidential Library Museum.
[00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:34.717]  And it actually says, on the tape, he's arguing with McNamara, griping at him, and he goes, you told me, he's at the ranch,
[00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:41.385]  In Johnson City, outside Austin, out by Fredericksburg.
[00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.288]  Why am I giving you so much detail?
[00:39:44.308 --> 00:39:44.929]  That doesn't matter.
[00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:52.778]  LBJ is on the phone talking to McNamara, the Defense Secretary, and he says, I thought we were attacked!
[00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:57.293]  Well, Mr. President, I kind of, you know, well... No, we weren't.
[00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.814]  We were up there actually attacking them, and they didn't even shoot back.
[00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:05.156]  Well, we've told the press this, and now they're on to the fact that it wasn't attacked.
[00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:06.897]  Those are the news articles that have come out.
[00:40:07.337 --> 00:40:12.520]  And so, you're going to be at press conferences, and you better go ahead, Mr. President, and tell them we were attacked.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.880]  That's just the way it is.
[00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:16.142]  The President goes, alright, then.
[00:40:16.242 --> 00:40:16.882]  That's what I'll do.
[00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:22.284]  And McNamara is kind of subservient, but they're at the end kind of, hey, this is the way it is.
[00:40:22.585 --> 00:40:23.745]  Okay, I'll do what you say.
[00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:25.525]  All righty then.
[00:40:26.526 --> 00:40:27.186]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:27.246 --> 00:40:27.546]  Bye-bye.
[00:40:27.586 --> 00:40:27.826]  Click.
[00:40:29.046 --> 00:40:29.807]  You hear the next call.
[00:40:30.047 --> 00:40:33.108]  All right, uh, Johnny, he's talking to some admiral.
[00:40:33.688 --> 00:40:34.548]  Next call, Pentagon.
[00:40:34.588 --> 00:40:35.949]  You got this story straight?
[00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:37.169]  Gonna know how you're gonna deal with it?
[00:40:37.978 --> 00:40:43.920]  Of course, every time the tape rolls around, it goes... I mean, you can listen to it off their website.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.660]  It's pretty crisp.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:50.842]  By the time we play it over the air and those other satellites, it's pretty bad audio, but... It's all admitted.
[00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:52.763]  I mean, they release thousands of hours of this stuff.
[00:40:53.743 --> 00:41:01.946]  And, uh... Then the President goes ahead and gets on the phone, calls everybody up, makes sure they know what the story is.
[00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:05.287]  That's why that guy had so many heart attacks and ulcers.
[00:41:05.327 --> 00:41:06.347]  I mean, he worked all the time.
[00:41:07.279 --> 00:41:07.840]  You need to listen.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.443]  I mean, one night I listened to about six hours of it.
[00:41:11.463 --> 00:41:12.764]  I started listening at about ten.
[00:41:13.744 --> 00:41:14.825]  Went to bed about four.
[00:41:17.207 --> 00:41:18.669]  And I was just listening.
[00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:20.990]  Oh, C-SPAN played it too.
[00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.051]  That's where I first learned of it.
[00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:24.453]  I knew about the tapes.
[00:41:24.473 --> 00:41:25.294]  I knew they'd released them.
[00:41:25.314 --> 00:41:26.775]  But how do you listen to 3,000 hours?
[00:41:27.156 --> 00:41:28.697]  C-SPAN grabbed those very clips.
[00:41:29.558 --> 00:41:32.280]  So I was actually listening off C-SPAN's site, like six hours of it.
[00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:37.420]  It was just hours of him calling up different generals and admirals, getting the story straight.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.441]  But see how I digress?
[00:41:45.542 --> 00:41:52.044]  Got a little bit of a sore throat today, so bear with me folks.
[00:41:52.104 --> 00:41:53.125]  This is what they're doing.
[00:41:54.625 --> 00:41:56.326]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:02.268]  But why do they have people have these drills?
[00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.121]  Why do they do this?
[00:42:07.662 --> 00:42:09.563]  Well, there's a bunch of different reasons.
[00:42:10.503 --> 00:42:12.444]  But I talked about it earlier in the broadcast.
[00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:27.690]  Right before 9-11, I saw an Associated Press article where they said that over $40 million was spent per year with a secret office in Hollywood, California, out in L.A.
[00:42:29.562 --> 00:42:47.512]  And the top screenwriters, top script writers were paid millions to write scripts every year for the last decade, now that'd be 14 years, to write scenarios of terrorists attacking America.
[00:42:51.255 --> 00:42:58.619]  So, on the surface, so the Pentagon would be able to think creatively and see how terrorists might attack us.
[00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:25.219]  And then we have this report, with the documents and the lie detector test and all of it, by an individual who admittedly is still working for the Pentagon, this academic, academic now, of how the terrorists, the aero-terrorists, would use box cutters to take control of aircraft and fly them into the World Trade Center towers.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.841]  Now why did they do this?
[00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:29.883]  Because they war game, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:43:30.672 --> 00:43:38.397]  And they need scripts to enter into the war games and into their statistical analysis that's gotten a lot more sophisticated since 1976.
[00:43:38.918 --> 00:43:49.605]  It was very similar to insurance company actuaries and prime, they call it projecting, and different analysis they were doing back then.
[00:43:49.946 --> 00:43:57.451]  Now it's much more sophisticated with these Cray arrays and raids of supercomputers.
[00:44:00.026 --> 00:44:03.788]  Arrays of raids, as they call them.
[00:44:05.129 --> 00:44:10.512]  These giant, just whole buildings full of these computers.
[00:44:11.553 --> 00:44:16.616]  And so they take all this and they punch it in and do different analysis of how you'll respond.
[00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:23.259]  And they had different Pentagon groups and different military groups all over the country doing drills.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.482]  They still have them all doing drills and writing up scenarios.
[00:44:28.194 --> 00:44:45.846]  Then the brains, because the brains, the 170 IQ eggheads that actually come up with all these plans and decide what plans to go with, they know, though, that thousands of individuals working on different scenarios are going to come up with ideas they would have never thought of.
[00:44:45.866 --> 00:44:48.908]  And then they kind of cherry-pick the different ideas.
[00:44:50.429 --> 00:44:56.734]  Also, it creates plausible deniability, because when the military-industrial complex, who has the motives for these attacks,
[00:44:57.392 --> 00:45:07.679]  Then you look at the evidence, they're clearly behind these attacks, carries out an attack, and if it ever comes out, they'll just say, oh no, we were just running a drill of that.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:14.264]  If they get caught actually carrying the attack out, they just say it's a coincidence, it was just a drill.
[00:45:15.965 --> 00:45:18.767]  Just like on 9-11, they got caught running the drills,
[00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:26.896]  of flying hijacked jets from the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the very same time in the morning with the same flight paths.
[00:45:26.976 --> 00:45:28.197]  I mean, it's totally impossible.
[00:45:28.818 --> 00:45:30.499]  But they just say, yeah, yeah, it was a drill.
[00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:31.200]  Coincidence.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.100]  Just a drill.
[00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:35.123]  That's all it is.
[00:45:36.444 --> 00:45:37.104]  Just a drill.
[00:45:37.945 --> 00:45:39.146]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[00:45:40.267 --> 00:45:41.408]  Oh, sure, I believe you.
[00:45:41.888 --> 00:45:43.029]  We all just go back to sleep.
[00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.632]  But, uh, it contradicts them, though.
[00:45:46.672 --> 00:45:49.314]  They said they never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings.
[00:45:50.362 --> 00:45:59.267]  Now there are literally hundreds of cases and hundreds of government documents and hundreds of these different drills that they had of exactly this happening.
[00:45:59.307 --> 00:46:10.773]  So, folks, they had a fixation on flying jets into the towers because you fly one plane into one tower, everybody aims their news cameras, billions of people globally tune in.
[00:46:11.594 --> 00:46:19.558]  Then, now that billions are tuned in, another plane right on time hits, people see it in real time, then we cut to Bush,
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:28.528]  And the school still... Now remember, he was in the green room and saw the first tower smoking.
[00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:33.974]  First he denied that, but the Times of London released the photos of him looking at the first tower smoking.
[00:46:34.574 --> 00:46:37.818]  Normally a president would cancel any speech over something like that.
[00:46:40.405 --> 00:46:46.250]  But instead he goes out for the photo op with all the news cameras with the image of children around him.
[00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.293]  That sells the psychology that we're all children.
[00:46:49.613 --> 00:46:50.674]  He's the father figure.
[00:46:51.034 --> 00:46:52.375]  We've already learned of it.
[00:46:52.695 --> 00:46:54.317]  20 minutes goes by for the second plane.
[00:46:54.817 --> 00:46:58.420]  We're all totally in shock watching him.
[00:46:58.961 --> 00:47:01.002]  They're cutting back and forth between him and the towers.
[00:47:01.343 --> 00:47:03.465]  What is our daddy going to do?
[00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:04.986]  And it cuts.
[00:47:05.807 --> 00:47:07.428]  He learns and looks very upset.
[00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:10.479]  But still, he doesn't get up.
[00:47:10.959 --> 00:47:11.760]  Because he can't.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.400]  Because then they'll say, Mr. President, shoot the plane down.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.441]  The one going to the Capitol.
[00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.421]  And then he was hoping that plane would have gotten to the Capitol.
[00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:22.422]  But the Pentagon wouldn't have disregarded orders and gone ahead and shot the plane down.
[00:47:22.462 --> 00:47:25.863]  They were under orders three months before that they could no longer shoot planes down.
[00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.123]  They always had that authority.
[00:47:27.163 --> 00:47:30.844]  That was taken from them by Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld three months before, June 1st.
[00:47:32.265 --> 00:47:33.785]  We have that memorandum in the new film.
[00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:38.499]  And so then the other events could take place.
[00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:40.000]  The Pentagon, Pennsylvania.
[00:47:43.162 --> 00:47:44.984]  All while we're watching our great leader.
[00:47:45.044 --> 00:47:46.485]  It was all scripted.
[00:47:48.427 --> 00:47:52.750]  And you better be concerned about this because they've scripted smallpox releases in Oklahoma.
[00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:57.074]  Martial law in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas.
[00:47:58.935 --> 00:48:00.917]  They've scripted attacks in California.
[00:48:02.238 --> 00:48:04.339]  Where of course the governor saves everyone.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:04.860]  Oh boy.
[00:48:06.095 --> 00:48:16.101]  We've got all these scripted attacks, and when they happen exactly as I scripted them, of course there'll be a drill of the exact same thing happening at the exact same time, in case any good cops were to catch them.
[00:48:17.942 --> 00:48:22.484]  And we'll just have to sit here and watch them kill a bunch of us as usual, and pose as our saviors on the nightly news.
[00:48:22.844 --> 00:48:27.987]  Alright, I'm sorry I've been running on here, but it's important stuff.
[00:48:28.827 --> 00:48:31.429]  Kim, where are you calling us from?
[00:48:31.669 --> 00:48:32.770]  I'm calling from Texas.
[00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:33.410]  Welcome.
[00:48:34.264 --> 00:48:38.647]  I was at a rap concert yesterday during the day, Alex, here in Dallas.
[00:48:38.907 --> 00:48:39.207]  Yes.
[00:48:39.928 --> 00:48:41.469]  And it was a great concert.
[00:48:41.529 --> 00:48:44.851]  You know, everybody had kids there because it was a car show also.
[00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:52.656]  And we walk out of the building after like, I guess, three or four hours of the concert and there are policemen in riot gear.
[00:48:54.357 --> 00:48:55.298]  I could not believe it.
[00:48:55.618 --> 00:48:59.420]  And you had to go, you couldn't just walk out and just walk in any direction.
[00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:01.822]  You had to walk a certain way.
[00:49:02.458 --> 00:49:05.281]  Down through the grass, everybody was trying to stay on the sidewalk.
[00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:10.465]  And now this one young white cop was like, hey, hey, hey, you guys on the grass, get on the grass.
[00:49:10.926 --> 00:49:18.853]  You know, he was just being ill-mannered and I said, and he happened to look at my daughter and said, and I said, wait a minute, that's my child.
[00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:20.194]  You don't have to talk to her that way.
[00:49:20.614 --> 00:49:24.178]  You can say, excuse me, everybody, we need you to go this direction, right?
[00:49:24.898 --> 00:49:26.580]  Oh, he got irate with me because I,
[00:49:27.463 --> 00:49:28.284]  I questioned him.
[00:49:28.664 --> 00:49:30.446]  Did you question a God?
[00:49:31.767 --> 00:49:33.949]  Listen, haven't you ever read the Greek tragedies?
[00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.972]  Mortals are not allowed to address gods.
[00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:39.895]  Alex, it got even worse.
[00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:42.617]  I said, what is this, Nazi Germany?
[00:49:42.637 --> 00:49:44.719]  I said, what are we in, Nazi Germany?
[00:49:44.759 --> 00:49:45.880]  Are you an SS trooper?
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:46.961]  What's going on?
[00:49:47.481 --> 00:49:49.764]  You know, and he's like, ma'am, do you just need to keep walking?
[00:49:49.824 --> 00:49:51.125]  I said, no, I can talk to you.
[00:49:52.202 --> 00:49:55.805]  I said, I don't know if you're a young rookie cop or what, but I can talk to you.
[00:49:55.845 --> 00:49:56.906]  No, man, you need to keep going.
[00:49:56.926 --> 00:49:57.407]  Keep going.
[00:49:57.807 --> 00:50:01.250]  I said, no, I have my constitutional rights and I can talk to you.
[00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:03.372]  And then he takes out his mace.
[00:50:03.392 --> 00:50:06.295]  I said, are you going to mace me because I'm talking to you?
[00:50:06.635 --> 00:50:08.277]  I'm not in his face now, Alex.
[00:50:09.137 --> 00:50:12.200]  But I'm talking to him and I'm like, you're going to mace me?
[00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:13.762]  For what reason?
[00:50:14.382 --> 00:50:15.403]  And he just looked at me.
[00:50:15.443 --> 00:50:18.606]  He was paralyzed, I guess because I continued to question him.
[00:50:19.215 --> 00:50:22.577]  And this older, well I don't know, he was an older officer, white guy, 85.
[00:50:22.837 --> 00:50:24.718]  But he had Sergeant Strike.
[00:50:25.379 --> 00:50:27.680]  And I said, you should go and talk to this guy.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.541]  Because he's out of control.
[00:50:29.962 --> 00:50:31.042]  Well let me tell you something.
[00:50:31.983 --> 00:50:34.444]  So you go to the car show, it's also got some live music.
[00:50:34.584 --> 00:50:35.705]  It's like a rodeo here.
[00:50:35.745 --> 00:50:36.946]  It's got rap music.
[00:50:36.986 --> 00:50:38.166]  I guess we should send the police.
[00:50:38.707 --> 00:50:40.808]  But look, stay there.
[00:50:40.848 --> 00:50:42.009]  We'll talk about this, Kim.
[00:50:42.029 --> 00:50:42.809]  This is important.
[00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:44.770]  This happens everywhere now.
[00:50:45.671 --> 00:50:47.092]  I mean, when we have a parade,
[00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.719]  They call out the armored police.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.903]  And, uh, it's... It's about letting us know who our masters are.
[00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.685]  And it's only getting worse and worse.
[00:51:02.367 --> 00:51:05.229]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:07.257]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:52:53.638 --> 00:52:54.098]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.998 --> 00:53:03.318]  I think so.
[00:53:18.223 --> 00:53:18.884]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.745 --> 00:53:50.852]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.012 --> 00:53:56.884]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.423 --> 00:54:06.945]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:10.747]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.387 --> 00:54:25.055]  Alright, coming into the next hour, I'm going to go right to your calls, then we got a guest coming up to talk about, well, 1976, Pentagon plans, the perfect terrorist attack, even with box cutters, same targets.
[00:54:26.316 --> 00:54:32.920]  More and more evidence of how long-term they plan all of this, when they just take old plans and mix them up with new plans.
[00:54:34.034 --> 00:54:37.178]  But real quick, finishing up, Kim, I wanted to add this point.
[00:54:37.638 --> 00:54:39.800]  A few weeks ago I aired this on my TV show.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.805]  So it's on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:54:44.485 --> 00:54:47.148]  And it was troops in Galveston for the Mardi Gras.
[00:54:47.609 --> 00:54:49.991]  And it shows just peaceful, happy, drunk crowds.
[00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:52.494]  Never had any problems early down there for Mardi Gras.
[00:54:53.604 --> 00:54:57.345]  And it just says, oh, we no longer have the police here, we have the military.
[00:54:57.805 --> 00:55:07.147]  And it shows the military yelling at people, shoving crowds, getting in everybody's face, marching around, you know, just... It's all about letting you know who the new rulers are.
[00:55:07.207 --> 00:55:08.247]  It's like the Red Sox.
[00:55:08.907 --> 00:55:11.568]  A few crowds of people refused to disperse.
[00:55:11.668 --> 00:55:12.288]  No riots.
[00:55:13.348 --> 00:55:16.109]  That first night, until they started shooting people with rubber bullets.
[00:55:16.749 --> 00:55:19.469]  Shot that Snellgrove girl in the face at ten feet away.
[00:55:19.569 --> 00:55:20.009]  Killed her.
[00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.050]  She's done nothing wrong.
[00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:22.750]  She's dead now.
[00:55:23.616 --> 00:55:28.639]  So, uh, no, it's, they've told him, let them know, control them, get in their face.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.360]  It's for their own good.
[00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:33.362]  And so it's just more of the same, Kim.
[00:55:33.402 --> 00:55:33.923]  Anything else?
[00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:36.404]  Yeah, they had a police cop, helicopter just circling.
[00:55:36.905 --> 00:55:39.606]  And I'm like, look at all this tax dollars, money just going away.
[00:55:39.686 --> 00:55:40.867]  This man is just circling.
[00:55:41.347 --> 00:55:48.672]  Well, that's because they're worried there'd be a riot or they're worried that there'd be gang activity and somebody do something, which, which, which could happen.
[00:55:49.032 --> 00:55:49.893]  But, but having, you know,
[00:55:50.852 --> 00:55:54.275]  Hundreds of police and riot gear isn't going to do anything to stop that if it does.
[00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:55.876]  Five o'clock in the afternoon?
[00:55:57.057 --> 00:55:57.978]  Well, no, I understand.
[00:55:57.998 --> 00:55:59.038]  Look, look, look, look.
[00:55:59.379 --> 00:56:04.162]  We have little Second Amendment rallies and cops show up and they're getting in people's faces.
[00:56:04.483 --> 00:56:07.125]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:56:07.205 --> 00:56:08.206]  Well, we're the enemy.
[00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:09.386]  We're the enemy, Kim.
[00:56:09.406 --> 00:56:10.507]  We've got to be kept in line.
[00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:13.349]  My daughter equated, she said, am I in South Africa?
[00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.450]  Is this apartheid?
[00:56:15.311 --> 00:56:16.572]  You know, she said that's how she felt.
[00:56:16.632 --> 00:56:17.853]  I said, well, I'm older.
[00:56:18.273 --> 00:56:20.435]  I felt like I was leaving a Black Panther rally.
[00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:23.302]  And something was supposed to happen that didn't happen?
[00:56:23.582 --> 00:56:26.203]  Well, you gotta know that, I mean, they do this to everybody now.
[00:56:26.903 --> 00:56:32.666]  See, I haven't been out in a while, and it's just incredible that you would want children to see that.
[00:56:32.946 --> 00:56:37.768]  You know, and the guy said, you know, I kept saying, what about our Constitution?
[00:56:38.652 --> 00:56:39.852]  What about our competition?
[00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:42.093]  I say, yeah, we don't have one anymore, and I'm using my competition.
[00:56:42.113 --> 00:56:43.114]  Yeah, they always say that.
[00:56:43.154 --> 00:56:43.554]  It's weird.
[00:56:43.574 --> 00:56:44.474]  It's like, what about us?
[00:56:44.554 --> 00:56:44.754]  Yeah.
[00:56:44.974 --> 00:56:45.555]  Yeah, I know.
[00:56:45.595 --> 00:56:46.215]  It's real weird.
[00:56:46.255 --> 00:56:46.855]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:47.435 --> 00:56:51.017]  And then if you told him, hey, I pay your salary, he'd say, no, I pay taxes.
[00:56:51.237 --> 00:56:51.957]  I pay my salary.
[00:56:53.338 --> 00:56:56.119]  No, it's all about protecting themselves from us.
[00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:57.279]  We're so dangerous.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.280]  Meanwhile, more federal officers being killed on the border.
[00:57:00.601 --> 00:57:06.603]  But that doesn't stop Vicente Fox and Bush from wanting to go after the Minutemen that are down there protecting their own property.
[00:57:07.526 --> 00:57:13.249]  We'll go to Amanda and Ross and Rita and others when we start the next hour.
[00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:24.655]  Before I end this hour, every single one of you need to take action and get my new film, my best video yet, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[00:57:25.296 --> 00:57:36.802]  Covers 9-11, covers the occult activities of the global elite, gets into the Nazi-Schwarzenegger-Bush connection, shows how the Order of the Deathshead really runs the planet as the most powerful secret society.
[00:57:38.451 --> 00:57:40.853]  It gets into the latest police state developments.
[00:57:40.913 --> 00:57:42.113]  It's an amazing film.
[00:57:42.133 --> 00:57:42.113]  $25.95.

[00:58:57.873 --> 00:58:58.534]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.194 --> 00:59:00.175]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.942 --> 00:59:02.023]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.683 --> 00:59:03.523]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.284 --> 00:59:05.184]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.204 --> 00:59:09.526]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.026 --> 00:59:14.128]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.009 --> 00:59:22.572]  Alright, my friends, we're now into the second hour of this March 21st, 2005 edition.
[00:59:25.743 --> 00:59:29.425]  Coming up, writer for American Free Press, Greg Siminski, will be joining us.
[00:59:29.685 --> 00:59:34.968]  The perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers created by the government, the Pentagon, in 1976.
[00:59:36.368 --> 00:59:39.250]  Including the same targets, men with box cutters, you name it.
[00:59:40.771 --> 00:59:45.553]  This is a big story because it shows the premeditated planning of the globalists.
[00:59:46.293 --> 00:59:47.494]  It's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:59:47.554 --> 00:59:49.495]  A bunch of other news about Terry Schiavo.
[00:59:49.995 --> 00:59:52.436]  Russian intelligence chief says Al Qaeda a myth.
[00:59:53.117 --> 00:59:55.318]  New Guantanamo Bay torture information.
[00:59:56.279 --> 01:00:03.685]  George Bush protecting Bill Clinton, blocking out documents, and Clinton says, thanks a lot Bush, I remember us back at META, I really appreciate it.
[01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:09.509]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:12.851]  Amanda, in Colorado, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:00:12.872 --> 01:00:15.213]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:00:15.373 --> 01:00:16.114]  Pretty good, thank you.
[01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:25.956]  I am originally from Mississippi and I have been looking at your pictures on the website of the Mississippi Camp and the DeSoto National Forest.
[01:00:26.837 --> 01:00:44.510]  Well, I told a friend of mine about it that still lives there because I've only been gone for a couple of years and she wrote the DeSoto National Forest and she received a letter back and they claim that it is to train Iraqis, well, not to train Iraqis, to train American forces to deal with Iraqis in Iraq.
[01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:49.291]  Well, there was a number on there, and I called him this morning, and I can give you the number if you would like it.
[01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:50.533]  His name is Larry Walters.
[01:00:50.573 --> 01:00:53.078]  He's the military liaison.
[01:00:53.118 --> 01:00:53.799]  Listen, listen.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.525]  That stuff's been on the site for about 40 years, 5 years.
[01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.396]  And they can tell you whatever they want.
[01:01:00.436 --> 01:01:06.498]  We have video of Fort Polk, Louisiana with the foreign troops training to put Americans in camps.
[01:01:07.118 --> 01:01:09.879]  I have video that I shot myself in California.
[01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:11.779]  We have video in Heberton, Maryland.
[01:01:11.799 --> 01:01:15.040]  Video in Alabama, North Carolina.
[01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:20.042]  And notice they have the signs in Slavic.
[01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:23.746]  And of course it doubles as a training camp as well.
[01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:24.846]  Of course they do.
[01:01:24.906 --> 01:01:25.846]  And I told him that.
[01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:50.011]  He told me that on the sign that the sign was Iraqi writing and I told him no it wasn't because I was looking at the picture on my computer right now and he asked me how I got a picture of it and I just I didn't want to tell him you know where I got it from but he swore up and down that it was Iraqi writing and I told him no it's not it's Russian and I told him I wanted to know while Russian writing was on there and I also told him that I have video of in Austin or outside of Austin
[01:01:50.424 --> 01:01:53.186]  Where they are training, and also they hired actors.
[01:01:53.206 --> 01:01:55.368]  He wrote her in the letter because she was going to mail me the letter.
[01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:57.210]  And he told her they hired actors.
[01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.592]  Look, I've been to ten of these myself.
[01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:00.913]  More than that.
[01:02:02.154 --> 01:02:02.655]  It's true.
[01:02:02.735 --> 01:02:05.057]  They use the camp for drills to put us in it.
[01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:13.284]  And maybe this guy is a useful idiot and doesn't know what they're doing there, but... Yeah, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:13.564 --> 01:02:16.547]  Off air, give me his name and number, and maybe I'll get him on as a guest.
[01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:17.687]  Okay.
[01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:19.049]  His name is Larry Walters.
[01:02:19.229 --> 01:02:19.789]  Yeah, I know.
[01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:21.291]  We're going to get that off air right now, okay?
[01:02:21.851 --> 01:02:22.712]  Put you on hold, Amanda.
[01:02:22.732 --> 01:02:23.032]  Thank you.
[01:02:23.693 --> 01:02:25.134]  Let's talk to Ross in Ohio.
[01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.876]  Get her info for me.
[01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:28.657]  Ross in Ohio.
[01:02:28.697 --> 01:02:29.138]  Go ahead.
[01:02:30.239 --> 01:02:31.700]  Yes.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.762]  You mentioned the United Nations earlier?
[01:02:34.343 --> 01:02:35.043]  Yes.
[01:02:36.124 --> 01:02:38.907]  I've been doing extensive research and into the
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.601]  Globalistic forces of the UN?
[01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:42.082]  Yes.
[01:02:42.182 --> 01:02:50.548]  And there is... I would like anyone who is listening to be fully aware of a bill in Congress that uh... I'm sure you're aware of H.R.
[01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:55.052]  1146 or uh... either 46 or 43.
[01:02:55.112 --> 01:02:59.895]  That Ron Paul has been... Yeah, that's to get rid of the United Nations.
[01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.357]  Yeah, to retract U.S.
[01:03:02.397 --> 01:03:07.501]  membership of the United Nations and sever all financial military contributions to the UN.
[01:03:08.662 --> 01:03:09.022]  Everyone
[01:03:10.413 --> 01:03:14.477]  Go on to the Library of Congress website, loc.gov, and look this up.
[01:03:14.937 --> 01:03:20.523]  Call up your congressmen and tell them to support this bill to the fullest extent.
[01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.465]  I mean, this U.N.
[01:03:22.525 --> 01:03:23.406]  crap has got to go.
[01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:33.776]  They are completely anti-gun, globalistic education, taxation schemes, the whole line of stuff pro-abortion elitist.
[01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:37.311]  Well, all Bush has done is said we've got to legitimize the U.N.
[01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:44.076]  and he's increased their funding, so you've got to talk to all the mindless so-called conservatives out there that think Bush is conservative.
[01:03:44.576 --> 01:03:45.377]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:45.397 --> 01:03:46.197]  Good call.
[01:03:46.218 --> 01:03:48.719]  Thanks for the call, Ross, Rita, and others.
[01:03:48.739 --> 01:03:50.060]  We'll get to you, Ray, as well.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:50.961]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:57.713]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.893 --> 01:04:02.315]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.455 --> 01:04:06.836]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:08.217]  A New World Order.
[01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:09.778]  Animer.
[01:04:10.019 --> 01:04:14.244]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.304 --> 01:04:21.252]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.372 --> 01:04:23.375]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:34.183]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.363 --> 01:04:39.747]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:52.797 --> 01:04:56.278]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.538 --> 01:05:00.018]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.118 --> 01:05:04.059]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:10.460]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:18.762]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:19.563]  I think so.
[01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:34.677]  We're good to go.
[01:05:34.717 --> 01:05:35.397]  We're good to go.
[01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.244]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:58.328]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:58.649 --> 01:05:59.469]  Read the labels.
[01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:04.034]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:08.439]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:13.685]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.065 --> 01:06:17.648]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:17.828 --> 01:06:23.172]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:23.452 --> 01:06:26.174]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:26.475 --> 01:06:27.375]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:54.594 --> 01:07:00.638]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.238 --> 01:07:04.220]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:08.919]  Alright, a new 9-11 development that's big.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.923]  The perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers, created in 1976.
[01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:20.829]  And if you go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, you can link through to American Free Press.
[01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.050]  Our own U.S.
[01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:30.496]  Army devised a plan commissioned by Congress to bring down the WTC using commercial airliners and box cutters as weapons.
[01:07:31.817 --> 01:07:33.539]  The laundry list of terrorist warnings
[01:07:34.298 --> 01:07:50.306]  handed to the Bush Administration prior to 9-11 makes the President and others look like bumbling idiots or a bunch of conniving criminals responsible for the mass murders at the Twin Towers and in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:57.690]  These are the harsh words of Timothy McNiven, an outspoken critic of the President's handling of 9-11 and a 29-year U.S.
[01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.892]  Defense Department operative still under contract with the government.
[01:08:02.088 --> 01:08:28.150]  He says, not only did the Bush administration purposely ignore Al Qaeda in the months preceding the WTC attacks, but the situation is even more disturbing considering the military unit, way back in 76, devised a mock terrorist attack of the Twin Towers exactly like what happened on 9-11, including using commercial airliners to be flown into the towers and plastic box cutters.
[01:08:30.143 --> 01:08:37.446]  And we're going to also later in the week get Timothy McNiven on the broadcast right now.
[01:08:37.927 --> 01:08:39.307]  Greg Siminski joins us.
[01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:41.728]  And Greg, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:42.209 --> 01:08:43.289]  Nice to be with you, Alex.
[01:08:43.469 --> 01:08:44.190]  Thanks for having me.
[01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:48.612]  I know you're out there at court today and so you're via the telephone.
[01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:49.112]  Yes.
[01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:50.953]  Via the cell phone with us.
[01:08:52.398 --> 01:08:54.099]  You write for American Free Press.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.961]  You're involved in a lot of other truth-seeking out there.
[01:08:57.502 --> 01:09:02.245]  Bring us up to speed in a thumbnail sketch and go over more details for us.
[01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:08.190]  Well, regarding Timothy, Timothy had contacted me through email first.
[01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:28.935]  I imagine he had read some of my articles and basically laid out what you just mentioned on the radio, but he mentioned it in this way and he said basically that he's tried to get his story out now for over a year and a half, unsuccessful with much of the media, all the media for that fact.
[01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:32.816]  And, uh, basically asked me if I would just listen to him.
[01:09:32.896 --> 01:09:37.077]  So, uh, I read, uh, a lot of, I read his whole story.
[01:09:37.717 --> 01:09:55.422]  Uh, Timothy's name sounded familiar, and I remember about a year and a half ago, two years ago, I was working on a story, uh, with the lawsuit in, uh, Philadelphia filed by Attorney Philip Berg against Bush and his cronies, a RICO lawsuit, and Timothy's name is in there, and he filed it affidavit telling the story
[01:09:56.042 --> 01:09:57.203]  We're good to go.
[01:10:15.039 --> 01:10:19.203]  No, I understand.
[01:10:19.284 --> 01:10:20.665]  I saw this story yesterday.
[01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:21.746]  I called you this morning.
[01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:23.087]  You're at court.
[01:10:23.588 --> 01:10:30.695]  But we're going to have you back on, and I'd like to have you back on with Timothy McNiven as well as soon as possible.
[01:10:31.215 --> 01:10:34.679]  And of course, we'll also put links to and post all these documents as well.
[01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:42.564]  I've interviewed Mr. Berg, I've interviewed Ellen Mariani, the first person on the suit, so I was familiar with some of this.
[01:10:42.644 --> 01:10:43.845]  Now we've got the details.
[01:10:44.145 --> 01:10:45.947]  This is stuff that Berg wasn't talking about.
[01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:47.308]  But I mean, let's go over this.
[01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:50.430]  Yeah, well, let me explain what Timothy first told me.
[01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:57.675]  He said that, basically, he was in a military unit in Strasbourg, Germany, back in 1976.
[01:10:59.477 --> 01:11:16.216]  And in this unit, and I list the name of the specific unit in the article, in this unit, basically there were some 30 to 40 to 50 people, and one day his lieutenant came in and said that they had been commissioned by Congress to discuss domestic airline security.
[01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:23.620]  And to put together their recommendations on how to improve airline security back in 1976.
[01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:37.368]  Well, he said that, you know, a week or two went by, then all of a sudden his lieutenant, who I mentioned, and now I can't remember his name right now, comes in and tells him that he has been ordered to use the Twin Towers as examples.
[01:11:38.112 --> 01:11:46.722]  And now what they were going to do is to use the Middle East as another example, as terrorists, and to put together a plan to bring down the Twin Towers.
[01:11:47.222 --> 01:11:55.751]  Now, McVeigh said that the Lieutenant said it was awfully strange, he thought, that he was asked to blow up buildings in his own hometown.
[01:11:55.771 --> 01:11:56.913]  He was from Long Island, New York.
[01:11:58.028 --> 01:11:59.209]  So that was the beginning of it.
[01:11:59.269 --> 01:12:00.230]  You mean McNiven?
[01:12:01.211 --> 01:12:11.540]  Well, the lieutenant told McNiven that he felt it was strange and kind of probably kidding and joking that he's now asked to blow up his own hometown because he was from New York.
[01:12:12.701 --> 01:12:13.582]  That was the lieutenant.
[01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:18.593]  Well, anyway, they then sit down and put together this plan.
[01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:22.094]  Timothy came up exactly, he says, came up with the box cutter idea.
[01:12:22.554 --> 01:12:34.700]  And they put together a day-by-day brainstorming, a plan on how to bring down the towers using airliners, terrorists from the Middle East, of course, they were just using mock terrorists, things like that.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:42.163]  And one day Timothy went up to, when they were talking and brainstorming, he went to his lieutenant and said to him,
[01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.334]  Well, what if this really happens?
[01:12:44.374 --> 01:12:46.895]  I think I might go and tell somebody what we're doing.
[01:12:47.115 --> 01:12:48.596]  You know, what if this really does happen?
[01:12:48.636 --> 01:12:54.519]  Because you can imagine, if you're in a situation like that, if you ever brainstorm an idea, it becomes real to you.
[01:12:55.179 --> 01:12:59.101]  And so, it isn't far-fetched for him to say something like that to his lieutenant.
[01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:02.783]  His lieutenant then accosted him, along with the sergeant, and told him, bluntly,
[01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:05.545]  Never to say anything about this report.
[01:13:05.685 --> 01:13:07.646]  Now, your article says physically a soldier.
[01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:08.567]  Exactly.
[01:13:09.148 --> 01:13:09.988]  What did they do to him?
[01:13:10.048 --> 01:13:15.072]  Well, basically they slapped him around a little bit, took him by the arm.
[01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:18.595]  You might ask Timothy specifically on what happened.
[01:13:18.615 --> 01:13:23.438]  Well, it's funny because when we have the USS Liberty survivors on, the most decorated ship in U.S.
[01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:27.141]  history, when they were finally called on board the ship after the U.S.
[01:13:27.181 --> 01:13:31.825]  and Israel had basically engineered an attack to sink it and blame it on Egypt, but they couldn't sink it,
[01:13:32.385 --> 01:13:39.789]  They called him on board, and they said, we're going to put you in prison for the rest of your life if you tell anybody what you know, or worse.
[01:13:40.409 --> 01:13:40.990]  Exactly.
[01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.491]  So they do do this, but go ahead.
[01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:59.700]  Well anyway, a strange turn of events then, about two weeks later, Timothy said that he was approached by the lieutenant, and the name again is in the article, and the lieutenant took him aside and did an about face, and basically said to Timothy, listen,
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.201]  I'm going to put you under strict orders right now.
[01:14:02.882 --> 01:14:09.386]  If anything is to ever happen like this in the future, you are to go and tell about this report.
[01:14:09.566 --> 01:14:11.227]  And this is Lieutenant Michael Teague?
[01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.128]  Exactly.
[01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:15.350]  Teague probably, what Timothy said, has had a change of heart.
[01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:25.196]  He said to keep it quiet, I'm going to put you under direct order for the rest of your life, that if anything ever happens with the Twin Towers, you are to let
[01:14:25.891 --> 01:14:28.994]  The world know about this report.
[01:14:29.054 --> 01:14:36.562]  Now, not only has he said this in federal court, not only is he under a lot of ticker tests, you checked him out, he's still doing work for the Pentagon.
[01:14:37.123 --> 01:14:41.687]  Well, you know, he was still doing work about a couple years ago.
[01:14:41.707 --> 01:14:42.748]  Yeah, until 9-11.
[01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:47.954]  Yeah, he was doing some work in some drug undercover units, things like that.
[01:14:48.594 --> 01:14:50.676]  So, he basically was under contract.
[01:14:50.716 --> 01:14:53.798]  Presently, I'm not sure exactly to this date if he's doing anything.
[01:14:53.838 --> 01:15:02.164]  Well, I mean, the MO, the MO on counter-drug activities as part of these task forces, that's basically military intelligence.
[01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:02.645]  Right.
[01:15:03.585 --> 01:15:14.834]  So, basically what he said is that he still feels obligated to tell his story based on the fact when he saw the Twin Towers come down, he said, oh my God, this is exactly what we did.
[01:15:16.148 --> 01:15:16.448]  In 1976.
[01:15:17.849 --> 01:15:26.553]  And it was funny, he feels that McTeague probably had a change of heart, and wondered, and whatever McTeague was told by his superiors, no one knows.
[01:15:27.253 --> 01:15:30.935]  And in fact, I'm trying to locate McTeague at this point.
[01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:33.616]  You mean Lieutenant Teague?
[01:15:33.676 --> 01:15:34.537]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:35.057 --> 01:15:36.097]  Teague, I can't remember.
[01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:38.418]  No, I know, you're at court on a cell phone.
[01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:42.519]  I've got the authorized documents in front of me.
[01:15:42.799 --> 01:15:45.359]  But anyway, I am going to try to locate him.
[01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:51.681]  And he also lists about 40 or 50 other people by name specifically that were in his unit that will verify this.
[01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:55.342]  So hopefully... And he's done this in sworn testimony in court.
[01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:56.002]  Exactly.
[01:15:56.062 --> 01:15:58.122]  So he's going to jail if this wasn't true.
[01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:01.563]  Yes, I mean he has sworn an affidavit in federal court.
[01:16:02.173 --> 01:16:08.738]  Which was the same veracity as if he was sitting in a courtroom before a federal judge.
[01:16:08.758 --> 01:16:09.999]  Well, let me just stop you right there.
[01:16:10.859 --> 01:16:12.020]  This is the same MO.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.542]  We know they were running drills on the morning of 9-11.
[01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:17.984]  We know they were the exact same thing happening that happened.
[01:16:18.224 --> 01:16:22.547]  We know they were running drills two weeks before, six months before, a year and a half before.
[01:16:22.948 --> 01:16:23.988]  We know this.
[01:16:24.008 --> 01:16:31.194]  And they love these drills because then if their people get caught trying to carry them out, they say, oh, it's just a drill.
[01:16:32.094 --> 01:16:44.062]  The Moscow bombings in 99, three apartment buildings get blown up, FSB get caught planting hexogen in the fourth building by Moscow police, and so then they declare, oh, it was just part of a drill.
[01:16:44.522 --> 01:16:44.762]  Right.
[01:16:45.343 --> 01:16:45.563]  Right.
[01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:54.589]  Now, uh, if you talk to, when you talk to Timothy, you'll find that, you know, he's tried his best to tell the truth.
[01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.030]  He went to a lie detector test.
[01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:59.712]  Of course, he's had no luck with the mainstream media to get his story out.
[01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:08.057]  And in fact, I believe at this particular juncture, my next step is going to be to try to find a few of these other people.
[01:17:08.778 --> 01:17:20.842]  And see if anybody else will talk, but... Well, I mean, it was American Free Press that first reported on how rescue workers at the towers said they found three of the four data recorders.
[01:17:21.122 --> 01:17:22.682]  Yeah, that's three I worked on.
[01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:28.124]  Yeah, and then it was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[01:17:28.204 --> 01:17:29.064]  They confirmed it.
[01:17:29.304 --> 01:17:29.544]  Right.
[01:17:29.624 --> 01:17:35.366]  So the mainstream media continues to try to ignore the stuff that you and I and many others have been digging up.
[01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:37.007]  Yeah, and you know what?
[01:17:37.107 --> 01:17:47.717]  I mean, a story like the black box story, which I talked to both the gentlemen, well, one of the gentlemen, one's not really talking, but his name is Mike Bologna, who was actually there.
[01:17:48.178 --> 01:17:51.901]  He told me basically this, that he saw the boxes.
[01:17:52.282 --> 01:17:56.646]  He was then told by FBI agents who came up to him later to keep his mouth shut.
[01:17:57.485 --> 01:17:58.526]  And I reported that.
[01:17:59.586 --> 01:18:06.630]  I then called the 9-11 Commission, who says they've never talked to, well, they said, well, I don't know if we talked to this guy.
[01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.572]  Well, Bologna said that the 9-11 Commission never talked to him.
[01:18:09.592 --> 01:18:12.053]  But then the Philadelphia Daily News went and did talk to him.
[01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.215]  Yeah, and I talked with him too, you know.
[01:18:14.575 --> 01:18:17.038]  And I talked to the guy too, and he told me this exact story.
[01:18:17.298 --> 01:18:32.394]  Well, about a week later, I get a couple of phone calls from people saying that I'm way out, you know, I hadn't written a story yet, and they were, I think they were planted calls, but they were, someone called me and said, you know, he never said that to those agents, and you better not print anything like that.
[01:18:32.434 --> 01:18:33.395]  And I said, you know something?
[01:18:34.082 --> 01:18:37.767]  I am printing it because he told it to me, you know.
[01:18:38.087 --> 01:18:39.188]  Stay there, Greg Simensky.
[01:18:39.228 --> 01:18:40.270]  We're honored to have you.
[01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:41.731]  This is a big story.
[01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:44.034]  We'll be right back on the other side of this.
[01:18:44.134 --> 01:18:46.217]  Quick break and your calls are coming up as well.
[01:18:46.798 --> 01:18:49.020]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of the websites.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:49.561]  Check it out.
[01:18:53.453 --> 01:18:58.996]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[01:18:59.176 --> 01:19:06.761]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[01:19:06.861 --> 01:19:13.464]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[01:19:13.664 --> 01:19:15.025]  Now it's available to you.
[01:19:15.205 --> 01:19:21.749]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[01:19:22.009 --> 01:19:26.295]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:32.844]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[01:19:32.984 --> 01:19:37.030]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:55.070]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:59.291]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:02.352]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.412 --> 01:20:09.134]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.314 --> 01:20:12.314]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:12.534 --> 01:20:14.935]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.035 --> 01:20:22.937]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:20:23.637 --> 01:20:34.519]  Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:34.659 --> 01:20:42.440]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:56.778 --> 01:20:58.179]  The Real Money Folks.
[01:21:01.461 --> 01:21:03.382]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:21:03.882 --> 01:21:04.863]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:06.144]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:21:06.284 --> 01:21:06.804]  A 5% increase.
[01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.826]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:21:09.846 --> 01:21:13.028]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:21:22.719 --> 01:21:25.060]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.342]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:21:28.963 --> 01:21:32.004]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:59.404]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:21:59.584 --> 01:22:00.645]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:22:00.765 --> 01:22:01.626]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:22:01.746 --> 01:22:04.588]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:22:04.769 --> 01:22:09.652]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:11.013]  Check out this new product.
[01:22:11.153 --> 01:22:12.274]  It's called No B.O.
[01:22:12.354 --> 01:22:14.056]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:16.478]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No B.O.
[01:22:16.518 --> 01:22:18.079]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:20.921]  Look, the creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.

[01:22:26.124 --> 01:22:29.246]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:22:29.366 --> 01:22:34.750]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:35.630]  Try No-BO.
[01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:36.551]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.

[01:22:54.598 --> 01:22:59.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:03.362]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.802 --> 01:23:05.743]  Alright, we're talking to Greg Skamensky and
[01:23:07.299 --> 01:23:10.843]  He joins us here via cell phone.
[01:23:12.204 --> 01:23:14.086]  We appreciate him spending the time with us.
[01:23:14.146 --> 01:23:18.770]  He's broken a lot of big stories for American Free Press and they've all panned out.
[01:23:19.731 --> 01:23:22.354]  This latest one is right from federal court documents.
[01:23:23.175 --> 01:23:23.775]  The U.S.
[01:23:23.855 --> 01:23:30.622]  government going out and getting these different scenarios, these specific scenarios,
[01:23:32.515 --> 01:23:35.016]  Greg, we see this over and over and over again.
[01:23:35.036 --> 01:23:38.357]  They war game all these different ideas and then they're carried out.
[01:23:38.457 --> 01:23:41.718]  How do you see this coupling with the Northwoods document?
[01:23:42.358 --> 01:23:55.763]  Well, it's basically just more evidence showing that there was knowledge, prior knowledge, and will lend evidence to more specific, more
[01:23:57.418 --> 01:24:01.503]  Evidence that comes up that's more pertinent, more timely in the future.
[01:24:01.523 --> 01:24:08.170]  This is credibility evidence that's going to lay credibility to what specific evidence will be found.
[01:24:09.119 --> 01:24:20.204]  Somewhere, somehow, to prove that some of these people knew about it, or actually were complicit in being involved in it, or did nothing to stop it, is what I'm trying to get at.
[01:24:20.324 --> 01:24:27.547]  And the reason that the B. Philbert lawsuit's a brilliant idea is that for those of you in the audience who don't understand the legal...
[01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:28.667]  We're good to go.
[01:24:43.399 --> 01:24:47.461]  to implicate mafia members in order to easily prosecute them.
[01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:56.205]  Well now, Berg's turned around and used this against the government, and basically they're acting basically exactly like a mafia attorney would act.
[01:24:56.285 --> 01:25:00.947]  Block everything, but they're using what's called national security to block the discovery.
[01:25:01.007 --> 01:25:11.031]  But the nice thing about it is that Berg's lawsuit can take information from back in 1976 and tie it together to show there is a conspiracy.
[01:25:12.865 --> 01:25:27.968]  One thing, you can go civilly and criminally, and in my experience, over the few years I've done the 9-11 stories and everything, if I was an attorney presented with this information, there's plenty of information to at least go to court with these people.
[01:25:28.088 --> 01:25:39.390]  Well, there is a just huge fixation with hijacking jets and applying them into buildings, not just by this administration, but administration after administration.
[01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:41.130]  We know the FBI cooked the bomb,
[01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.670]  Sure.
[01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:44.572]  I think it's a symbol of our freedom and it's a symbol of our financial rise to power.
[01:25:44.632 --> 01:25:46.232]  If you knock down the trade centers
[01:26:06.525 --> 01:26:09.306]  It's like cutting off your legs, cutting off America's legs.
[01:26:09.366 --> 01:26:12.347]  It was a good example of frightening the hell out of people.
[01:26:12.707 --> 01:26:13.948]  That's why they hit the Pentagon.
[01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:15.008]  That's a good example.
[01:26:15.048 --> 01:26:17.289]  If they can get to our military, they can get to you.
[01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:20.430]  If they can get to our financial institutions, they can get to you.
[01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:32.634]  Now, the real mistake I think people are making is to think that it's just that these people just all of a sudden came into being in the year 2000 when Bush was appointed, I shouldn't mention, president.
[01:26:32.674 --> 01:26:34.675]  And it's my estimate, it's my feeling that he is not
[01:26:35.245 --> 01:26:36.906]  the real president of this country.
[01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:42.350]  I don't think in this election or the last election he was put in office fairly.
[01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:51.937]  Now, that's aside, but listen, these people have been around a long, long time and they've been fighting since the early seventies to get this movement in.
[01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:59.803]  Bush is just a... Well, I've got congressional hearings from the mid-eighties where they're talking about concentration camps in Congress for the American people.
[01:26:59.903 --> 01:27:00.383]  Yeah, of course.
[01:27:00.663 --> 01:27:12.437]  And if you, and there's one little story that a lot of people, I wrote this story and I have not had any feedback on it, but people have to listen to this one fact about Bush 1, the first Bush president.
[01:27:12.998 --> 01:27:18.604]  He, it goes on record in 1988 as stating that his first, his first,
[01:27:20.314 --> 01:27:24.197]  Uh, affiliation with the CIA when he was appointed director, I believe, in 74, 76.
[01:27:25.238 --> 01:27:29.320]  Well, there came out a document, one document that was declassified, whether it was a mistake or not.
[01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:40.008]  It was a letter from J. Edgar Hoover, written in Hoover's hand, to a George H. Bush in 1963, asking him about the Bay of Pigs and how things were going.
[01:27:40.949 --> 01:27:48.792]  Well, it's admitted they have the offshore drilling rigs, it's admitted he was involved with the CIA, and I mean, that's a public secret.
[01:27:48.992 --> 01:27:49.212]  Right.
[01:27:49.292 --> 01:27:50.573]  Now, here's the deal, though.
[01:27:50.593 --> 01:27:57.735]  The interesting thing is, Bush in 88 went on record, on record, he was asked this question, were you ever in the CIA back in 1963?
[01:27:58.156 --> 01:28:02.957]  His answer was this, it must have been another George H. Bush that he was writing to, it wasn't me.
[01:28:03.538 --> 01:28:09.460]  So basically, he had one of the ships that was used in the Bay of Pigs was named the
[01:28:10.728 --> 01:28:11.908]  Uh, one of the covert ships.
[01:28:12.449 --> 01:28:17.230]  And he had a history of naming his airplanes Barbara 1 and Barbara 2, of course, after the First Lady.
[01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.011]  Uh, so, you know something?
[01:28:19.051 --> 01:28:25.073]  This, uh, what I'm getting at is that there's so much, uh, so much that needs to be investigated.
[01:28:25.494 --> 01:28:33.276]  And I think there needs to be a comment made about the way people look at the mainstream media and the way people look at the alternative media now.
[01:28:33.857 --> 01:28:36.838]  Now, I come from the background of the mainstream media.
[01:28:36.858 --> 01:28:37.338]  Stay there.
[01:28:37.618 --> 01:28:38.198]  Stay there, Greg.
[01:28:38.218 --> 01:28:38.838]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.879 --> 01:28:39.539]  Gotta break it again.
[01:28:39.559 --> 01:28:40.099]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.988 --> 01:28:44.929]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.949 --> 01:28:47.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.556 --> 01:29:01.522]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:29:01.902 --> 01:29:03.203]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:29:03.363 --> 01:29:04.084]  Now check this out.
[01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:07.807]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:29:08.147 --> 01:29:10.289]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:13.472]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:29:13.712 --> 01:29:14.513]  Your health suffers.
[01:29:14.753 --> 01:29:15.393]  It's that simple.

[01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:22.447]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.027 --> 01:30:29.871]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:32.412]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.892 --> 01:30:37.855]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:56.424]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[01:30:56.764 --> 01:30:57.925]  Is your hair looking thinner?

[01:31:08.392 --> 01:31:10.454]  They back everything with a money back guarantee.
[01:31:10.794 --> 01:31:11.535]  It works.
[01:31:11.895 --> 01:31:14.438]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[01:31:15.948 --> 01:31:20.771]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:24.673]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.
[01:31:24.993 --> 01:31:29.175]  Avacor is proven to successfully stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[01:31:29.755 --> 01:31:35.198]  Even if hair loss runs in the family, Avacor can help you regrow your own natural hair.
[01:31:35.218 --> 01:31:35.718]  Call 1-800-548-5910.
[01:31:35.738 --> 01:31:36.078]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[01:31:41.741 --> 01:31:42.782]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:31:42.802 --> 01:31:44.583]  We're about to go back to Greg Szymanski.
[01:32:11.724 --> 01:32:14.126]  Writer for American Free Press does an incredible job.
[01:32:15.607 --> 01:32:24.875]  And of course, for all of you that are holding, Rita and Ray and Rasheesh, I believe, and Delilah and everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:34.903]  Before we go back to our guest, my new film, my best work, two hours, thirty-five minutes long, is now out and is now shipping.
[01:32:36.326 --> 01:32:37.487]  It is martial law.
[01:32:37.507 --> 01:32:41.189]  9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is really three films in one.
[01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:50.215]  We cover the latest police state developments, the police in their black uniforms and ski masks, the hover blimps, the sound cannons in New York, reporters being arrested.
[01:32:51.286 --> 01:32:55.168]  The, uh, how the left is totally controlled, as well as the so-called conservatives.
[01:32:55.649 --> 01:32:58.290]  That's the first 35 minutes of the film, was at the RNC.
[01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:04.774]  Then we spent an hour on 9-11 at Ground Zero, showing all the documents A to Z. I come right out and say it.
[01:33:05.174 --> 01:33:06.996]  I detail how the globalists carried 9-11 out.
[01:33:07.976 --> 01:33:10.438]  You'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to say they didn't.
[01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:12.700]  Their official story is impossible.
[01:33:12.941 --> 01:33:22.529]  The whole thing, in from end, top from bottom, all points of the compass, has been proven to be total lies, total fraud, and with all the confirmed information we have, we know how they did it.
[01:33:22.769 --> 01:33:25.632]  There isn't a jury in the world that wouldn't convict these people.
[01:33:26.453 --> 01:33:27.974]  Not a fair jury in the world.
[01:33:28.334 --> 01:33:30.876]  When shown this, it would take six months to put my case on.
[01:33:31.097 --> 01:33:32.077]  There's so much evidence.
[01:33:32.258 --> 01:33:33.279]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:33.899 --> 01:33:34.900]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:36.741 --> 01:33:37.842]  That's an hour of the film.
[01:33:38.582 --> 01:33:42.325]  Then the third hour gets into the mindset, the history, the ideology.
[01:33:42.385 --> 01:33:45.107]  We show that the Nazis didn't come out of nowhere.
[01:33:45.689 --> 01:33:57.995]  The Order of Death, the real German branch of it, we have mainstream news articles, encyclopedia documents, video clips, was founded over 200 years ago in Germany.
[01:33:58.215 --> 01:34:05.178]  And how it founded Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, how it's behind Schwarzenegger, how it's behind the Bushes, the Bushes and the Nazis.
[01:34:05.799 --> 01:34:07.179]  Folks, it's incredible.
[01:34:07.279 --> 01:34:08.560]  You need this film.
[01:34:09.289 --> 01:34:16.064]  And the last ten minutes shows Bush giving his oath of office and then we show for ten minutes in rapid fire what they've done to the Bill of Rights.
[01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:18.871]  You need martial law.
[01:34:18.911 --> 01:34:29.234]  You need to get it and make copies for non-profit, not-for-sale educational purposes, air it on AXS TV, show it to your church, show it to your VFW hall, get it out to people.
[01:34:29.274 --> 01:34:33.055]  My other films have caused a big effect because of you taking action.
[01:34:33.095 --> 01:34:34.075]  Believe me, this is the best.
[01:34:34.395 --> 01:34:36.836]  It won't be seen unless you get it and show it to folks.
[01:34:37.256 --> 01:34:38.836]  Please call to get your copy.
[01:34:39.116 --> 01:34:41.917]  A bunch of other big discounts on my other films right now as well.
[01:34:43.257 --> 01:34:44.618]  Just ask about all the specials.
[01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:45.238]  I mean, we've got
[01:34:45.942 --> 01:34:47.163]  Just so many different deals.
[01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:48.384]  Just ask about them when you call.

[01:35:31.874 --> 01:35:34.816]  About 20 other documentaries we've been authorized to post.
[01:35:35.397 --> 01:35:37.138]  My weekly TV reports I do.
[01:35:37.338 --> 01:35:38.639]  The Best of Austin TV Show.
[01:35:38.879 --> 01:35:39.780]  It's one Best of Austin.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.421]  It's a good one hour show.
[01:35:41.841 --> 01:35:42.761]  That's up there every week.
[01:35:42.801 --> 01:35:44.142]  My best audio interviews.
[01:35:44.443 --> 01:35:45.323]  This one will be up there.
[01:35:45.743 --> 01:35:47.525]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:47.605 --> 01:35:48.025]  My book.
[01:35:48.105 --> 01:35:48.925]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:35:48.945 --> 01:35:50.547]  15 cents a day.
[01:35:51.227 --> 01:35:52.708]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:54.029]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:57.018 --> 01:36:03.062]  Going back to Greg, Greg, tell folks about your website, not just American Free Press, but your website.
[01:36:03.622 --> 01:36:20.393]  Well, my website, I put it together basically, I put out about four months worth of articles at a time, and these will go back to November, and basically it's called www.arcticbeacon.citymaker.com
[01:36:22.492 --> 01:36:35.817]  And I list my stories and also a new publication, it lists the outline of a new publication I'm putting together, which will have offices in Alaska and California, called The Arctic Beacon, The Last Frontier Truth.
[01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:38.338]  Why do you call it The Arctic Beacon?
[01:36:38.999 --> 01:36:44.621]  Well, basically, I call it The Arctic Beacon because I'm very concerned about what's happening up there.
[01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:49.543]  I have friends in Alaska, I'm very close to the environment as far as
[01:36:50.787 --> 01:36:54.068]  I've done a lot of stories on it, and I feel very close to the Lord.
[01:36:54.088 --> 01:36:56.309]  Gotcha, but you also cover 9-11.
[01:36:56.609 --> 01:37:05.171]  Yes, I do 9-11, and also, basically, I like to say any story that merits coverage should be done.
[01:37:05.191 --> 01:37:07.631]  Now, you've produced a documentary, have you not?
[01:37:08.052 --> 01:37:15.173]  Well, I've produced a 9-11 Citizens Commission Report, which is a print version.
[01:37:15.353 --> 01:37:16.254]  It's a 24-page
[01:37:19.268 --> 01:37:22.752]  I guess where I got confused is there's a video by almost the same name.
[01:37:23.132 --> 01:37:24.373]  Yeah, no, that's not me.
[01:37:24.513 --> 01:37:26.135]  I have not done one.
[01:37:27.436 --> 01:37:34.563]  However, I am in the process of beginning this publication, which is probably too long to go into specifics.
[01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:37.146]  We'll need to get you on when that comes up.
[01:37:37.166 --> 01:37:42.511]  But you heard me a few minutes ago say, I'll come right out and I'll say how 9-11 took place.
[01:37:42.871 --> 01:37:45.173]  Now I'm going to say this, and this is from years of study.
[01:37:45.533 --> 01:37:47.755]  I talked about 9-11 two months before it happened.
[01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:52.819]  I said they're going to blame it on Bin Laden, they're going to attack the World Trade Center, call the White House, tell Bush don't do it.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.023]  I've never said call the White House since, or before or after that.
[01:37:58.043 --> 01:37:59.324]  I don't just put these alerts out.
[01:37:59.725 --> 01:38:02.327]  Let me break down what happened on 9-11 and you can disagree if you want.
[01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:04.729]  You've got these Arabs.
[01:38:05.382 --> 01:38:07.944]  Who are government agents who are part of drills.
[01:38:07.984 --> 01:38:08.784]  They're trained at U.S.
[01:38:08.805 --> 01:38:09.605]  military bases.
[01:38:09.905 --> 01:38:13.308]  Their houses, their cars, their credit cards are paid for by the U.S.
[01:38:13.328 --> 01:38:13.668]  government.
[01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:18.672]  They've got some useful idiot real terrorists under them because, again, they're informants.
[01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:19.072]  Now...
[01:38:20.288 --> 01:38:30.777]  From there, they are taking part in the weeks before 9-11, and this has been confirmed, quote, in test flights, in other drills, in real-world drills where they're on board aircraft.
[01:38:31.157 --> 01:38:34.920]  The Pentagon is told it's a drill, this is all admitted, so is NORAD.
[01:38:35.361 --> 01:38:42.847]  They get on board the aircraft, a few of these fake phone calls are staged, and they can show Steve McQueen pitching Mustangs 25 years in the grave.
[01:38:45.126 --> 01:38:46.226]  Send out those phone calls.
[01:38:46.286 --> 01:38:47.487]  They're knocked out on board.
[01:38:47.827 --> 01:38:49.767]  The planes are then flown by remote control.
[01:38:50.048 --> 01:38:52.108]  Now, that's what all the evidence shows.
[01:38:52.388 --> 01:38:55.069]  You'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to not say that's what happened.
[01:38:55.769 --> 01:38:57.350]  Well, put it this way, Alex.
[01:38:58.210 --> 01:39:02.171]  Your story is much better than the government's story.
[01:39:02.831 --> 01:39:08.293]  And I, you know, to at this point pinpoint one way
[01:39:08.903 --> 01:39:22.907]  I think, you know, I can't say that, but I would say that most of the things you have said, I would have to have verified in doing this 9-11 Commission report that we've done recently that's out for nationwide publication.
[01:39:23.287 --> 01:39:29.129]  So basically, one, I would compliment you on not mincing words and telling it the way it is.
[01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:34.350]  Now, if things are a little different, I mean, that's only what the truth is.
[01:39:34.570 --> 01:39:37.391]  It's an evolving process, and that's the reason why
[01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:42.665]  I hope, hopefully, one of these court cases will take hold so that the truth can come out.
[01:39:43.065 --> 01:39:47.088]  But let me tell you this, and to verify what you just said.
[01:39:47.428 --> 01:39:51.531]  NORAD and all that stuff that went on that day, it's just abominable.
[01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:58.577]  And the real interesting fact about 9-11 is the cover-up afterwards, which makes me believe that what you say is more true.
[01:39:59.316 --> 01:40:24.524]  than what the government's putting out, because they have tried to block every effort, block every effort from FEMA taking away all of the hard evidence from a criminal murder scene, possibly, and destroying it, so now that you can't bring the evidence and the proof about all the factors that are caused, could a plane bring down the World Trade Center to begin with, and then every other fact, the black boxes, you go on to every possible cover-up, it's happening.
[01:40:25.245 --> 01:40:25.765]  That's why I
[01:40:27.132 --> 01:40:28.775]  I think it's very suspicious.
[01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:46.046]  Presidential Commissions, and they're all a bunch of, I would say, B.S.
[01:40:46.066 --> 01:40:48.668]  from Pearl Harbor all the way through Kennedy to this one.
[01:40:48.888 --> 01:40:51.110]  Listen, they first tried to have Henry Kissinger run it.
[01:40:51.531 --> 01:40:52.011]  Exactly!
[01:40:52.251 --> 01:40:59.498]  I mean, most of the people on the Commission were in business with the Carlisle Group, or in the case of Chairman Keene, with the Bin Laden family members.
[01:41:00.018 --> 01:41:03.962]  But let's just go through this calmly here, because this is important.
[01:41:04.617 --> 01:41:07.619]  Let me break down why I come to my conclusion.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.921]  There's too many points to go over them all, but here's a few.
[01:41:10.221 --> 01:41:11.802]  We have an official U.S.
[01:41:11.842 --> 01:41:16.686]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks in Northwoods.
[01:41:16.726 --> 01:41:19.188]  We know the USS Liberty was engineered.
[01:41:19.248 --> 01:41:20.829]  We know the Gulf of Tonkin was faked.
[01:41:21.269 --> 01:41:21.770]  We know
[01:41:22.981 --> 01:41:28.163]  Continuing that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, and bombed the World Trade Center the first time.
[01:41:28.503 --> 01:41:30.484]  We know they were running drills that morning.
[01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:33.265]  We know they were targeting the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[01:41:33.305 --> 01:41:34.726]  We know Cheney was in control.
[01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:40.308]  We know Dick Cheney took control three months before from the shoot-down orders from the Pentagon.
[01:41:40.948 --> 01:41:46.110]  And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds... We know the hijackers were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:48.731]  We know their houses, cars, credit cards were paid for.
[01:41:49.011 --> 01:41:58.098]  We know they'd leave the country, be on terrorist watch lists, and the State Department would order the embassies to let them back in, and even told the head of one embassy, yeah, this is for terror training.
[01:41:58.358 --> 01:42:03.822]  We know Hollywood people like James Woods were on board aircraft the week before with Muhammad Atta.
[01:42:03.842 --> 01:42:06.504]  He tells the FBI they're training to hijack planes.
[01:42:07.444 --> 01:42:09.886]  And then they say, shut your mouth, national security.
[01:42:09.906 --> 01:42:11.787]  I mean, we know what happened.
[01:42:13.529 --> 01:42:15.190]  Yeah, I, Alex, you present
[01:42:15.906 --> 01:42:18.487]  Those things you say, I have to agree with you.
[01:42:18.507 --> 01:42:20.267]  I want to see this thing pushed.
[01:42:20.287 --> 01:42:31.210]  I want somehow, for the American people, in our heartland, in the place where we need to get groundswell support, to really put these guys' foots to the fire and have them questioned.
[01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:31.910]  That's the point.
[01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:33.250]  We must do it.
[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:34.911]  And I appreciate your work.
[01:42:35.111 --> 01:42:36.251]  And it can't be forgotten.
[01:42:36.271 --> 01:42:38.311]  Do you think they'll ever be brought to justice?
[01:42:38.851 --> 01:42:39.572]  Do I think so?
[01:42:39.992 --> 01:42:40.232]  Yes.
[01:42:40.392 --> 01:42:41.932]  You know, I'm an internal optimist.
[01:42:42.692 --> 01:42:45.113]  And to say no would be defeating every purpose
[01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:48.247]  For every reason that I continue writing this story.
[01:42:48.648 --> 01:43:00.493]  Because I believe that people together, although we are all imperfect in a sense, if we work hard, if we strive to find what happened, we will.
[01:43:00.893 --> 01:43:03.194]  But if we forget about it and give up, we won't.
[01:43:03.274 --> 01:43:11.118]  So it's now in the court of basically a small amount of people, and it's up to us to bring this forward.
[01:43:11.158 --> 01:43:14.760]  Because once you listen to the facts, once you read and take time,
[01:43:15.635 --> 01:43:19.757]  One, you become utterly, utterly ashamed to be an American.
[01:43:20.197 --> 01:43:27.680]  Two, unbelievably sorrowful that you didn't take action prior to this, or more action, individually.
[01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:40.666]  And three, you realize that you can't let it happen again, and you must now take action, or your country, basically in my step, you've got one foot right now into fascism, and we need to act quickly.
[01:43:41.947 --> 01:43:44.228]  Let me just bolster what you just said.
[01:43:46.059 --> 01:44:01.910]  Even if they don't ever go to prison for the mass murder they committed, by exposing and getting the idea in people's minds that who stands to gain from terror, then that could back the global assault where they won't have the nerve to carry out another attack.
[01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:08.875]  Well I always said sometimes the court of public opinion is much more effective than a court of law.
[01:44:09.175 --> 01:44:12.838]  And hopefully the court of public opinion will rise to a point
[01:44:13.283 --> 01:44:14.564]  Well, there's two ways to look at this.
[01:44:14.584 --> 01:44:20.267]  We know 110% the government had total prior knowledge, opened all the doors, protected the so-called hijackers.
[01:44:33.611 --> 01:44:45.677]  Now, you can look at that view that they knew it and let it happen, or you can look at the other view that they engineered it and the official stories of fraud, and it has to be the second, because how does Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[01:44:46.037 --> 01:44:47.798]  How does Al-Qaeda run drills that morning?
[01:44:48.038 --> 01:44:49.899]  How does Al-Qaeda have all the evidence shredded?
[01:44:50.239 --> 01:44:52.920]  How does Al-Qaeda do all of this?
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.422]  Or, Alex, it could be a combination of the two amongst a number of people.
[01:44:57.502 --> 01:45:01.545]  I'm not saying the whole government, a very tiny criminal group did this.
[01:45:01.906 --> 01:45:02.166]  Right.
[01:45:02.907 --> 01:45:09.672]  And I believe that you're probably right on, because Norad's stand down there is unbelievable.
[01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:15.156]  And for one, nobody to be even reprimanded for this is unbelievable.
[01:45:15.997 --> 01:45:23.543]  And that's one reason I have to fall into that third category that wasn't just with complicity.
[01:45:24.263 --> 01:45:26.265]  It was naturally helping this thing along.
[01:45:26.835 --> 01:45:29.017]  And providing the exact time and date.
[01:45:30.818 --> 01:45:32.179]  And just look at one thing.
[01:45:33.961 --> 01:45:37.564]  The most heavily traveled airspace in the world, and this has been said a million times.
[01:45:38.284 --> 01:45:41.947]  How can a plane fly an hour around Washington and blow up the Pentagon?
[01:45:43.028 --> 01:45:45.330]  And then they say they have no pictures of it.
[01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:49.954]  And if you represent a defendant in a criminal case and stole the razor blade,
[01:45:50.478 --> 01:45:58.322]  You've got ten photos of every angle of him taking the razor blade out of a Target grocery store or Target supermarket.
[01:45:58.863 --> 01:45:59.863]  You understand my point?
[01:46:00.604 --> 01:46:07.307]  Well, the most surveilled area in the world, admittedly, is the Pentagon in Lanley, Virginia, with the CIA, but they don't have any evidence.
[01:46:07.608 --> 01:46:15.052]  Right, and I did a story about the only piece of airplane on the front lawn of the Pentagon that was photographed by
[01:46:15.885 --> 01:46:17.967]  Army or Navy photographer.
[01:46:17.987 --> 01:46:22.190]  He's unavailable for comment about that photograph.
[01:46:22.330 --> 01:46:26.574]  One of the reporters that said he saw the plane hit, turns out was one of the guys on the government payroll.
[01:46:26.894 --> 01:46:27.434]  Yeah, of course.
[01:46:27.875 --> 01:46:37.582]  I want to see, just like you don't see pictures of ATA in Boston, I want to see pictures of that plane hitting the Pentagon since you have
[01:46:39.045 --> 01:46:41.887]  You have surveillance.
[01:46:41.947 --> 01:46:46.331]  Why did the FBI confiscate it from the gas stations and the hotels?
[01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:47.932]  This is not national security.
[01:46:50.134 --> 01:46:55.098]  What's the national security about showing you the plane that you say you, the government, say hit the Pentagon?
[01:46:55.839 --> 01:46:56.159]  Show me.
[01:46:56.756 --> 01:46:57.817]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:46:58.217 --> 01:46:59.659]  Greg, wherever you're at is good.
[01:46:59.699 --> 01:47:01.320]  Your phone was cutting out a few minutes ago.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.461]  Wherever you're at is very good.
[01:47:02.762 --> 01:47:03.062]  Oh good.
[01:47:03.302 --> 01:47:04.403]  Oh, I just started up again.
[01:47:04.724 --> 01:47:05.144]  Okay.
[01:47:05.204 --> 01:47:05.744]  That's alright.
[01:47:06.305 --> 01:47:12.951]  Again, Greg was at court today working on some legal procedures down there and is joining us via cell phone.
[01:47:13.492 --> 01:47:15.373]  Let's go ahead and take a few calls here.
[01:47:15.393 --> 01:47:16.054]  Okay.
[01:47:16.134 --> 01:47:18.516]  I'm sure these will be all over the map, but that's okay.
[01:47:19.677 --> 01:47:20.438]  Let's go ahead.
[01:47:20.478 --> 01:47:21.279]  Who's up first here?
[01:47:22.948 --> 01:47:24.329]  Rita in Chicago.
[01:47:24.389 --> 01:47:25.269]  Rita, you're on the air.
[01:47:25.309 --> 01:47:25.770]  Go ahead.
[01:47:26.170 --> 01:47:27.210]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:28.951]  I called before your guest was on.
[01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:42.818]  I think he's great and everything, but, you know, the thing is, I think the priority now is 9-11, after I heard your interview with Mr. DeCamp, because whether you're a liberal or conservative, you can be anti-pedophile.
[01:47:43.558 --> 01:47:50.662]  And I think you get them all, all the way back to Reagan and Bush, and everybody in between, and international leaders.
[01:47:51.314 --> 01:47:56.315]  You know, once you start looking... Well, we don't have Reagan involved in all this, but we do have... No, well, it's 89, right?
[01:47:56.475 --> 01:47:57.476]  Yeah, that's Bush Senior.
[01:47:57.796 --> 01:48:03.197]  We do have mainstream news, coal boys, underage... Cannon, yeah!
[01:48:03.297 --> 01:48:03.998]  In the White House.
[01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:05.398]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.458 --> 01:48:06.358]  And then, what do you do?
[01:48:06.398 --> 01:48:09.659]  You take the testimony of the prostitute and you ask them what's really going on?
[01:48:10.299 --> 01:48:11.260]  Does that work in court?
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.720]  Let me bring that up to Greg.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:19.082]  Greg, I mean, I'm sure... We don't just have fake reporters, we have fake reporters who are male prostitutes in the White House.
[01:48:20.258 --> 01:48:32.401]  Well, you know something, that began in story, I haven't even bothered to... I know the story, and it's something that needs to be followed up in depth, because this is a travesty.
[01:48:32.421 --> 01:48:35.482]  But put it this way, Alex, none of this stuff surprises me.
[01:48:35.502 --> 01:48:39.383]  And let me tell you something, don't be surprised, none of this stuff does.
[01:48:39.783 --> 01:48:43.864]  Because the people that are crying out, the media hasn't done a job.
[01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:45.584]  The media has never really done a good job.
[01:48:45.865 --> 01:48:47.565]  They've done a little better jobs at times.
[01:48:47.885 --> 01:48:50.986]  But now it's coming to the forefront only because it's consolidated.
[01:48:51.006 --> 01:49:00.149]  There's only a few owners involved, and now you're seeing there's little, little voice, even in small-town America, or in places where normally you would get a second voice.
[01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:07.371]  But the media acting this way doesn't surprise me, because the media at the levels of the Washington Post, the New York Times, the St.
[01:49:07.451 --> 01:49:11.432]  Louis... I work for the ABC, Cap Cities, a number of different newspapers.
[01:49:11.492 --> 01:49:12.872]  I know the way the game is played.
[01:49:13.673 --> 01:49:14.993]  And let me tell you this.
[01:49:15.623 --> 01:49:16.604]  It's only gotten worse.
[01:49:16.945 --> 01:49:19.248]  You're not going to get the freedom of the press and the media.
[01:49:19.268 --> 01:49:23.694]  They're basically... Yeah, but maybe there's pictures of them with the little boy, and that's why they're doing what they're doing.
[01:49:23.714 --> 01:49:24.394]  Right, right.
[01:49:24.755 --> 01:49:29.161]  So if we start looking at them all as pedophiles, you know, I don't think they can stand up to that heat.
[01:49:29.201 --> 01:49:30.542]  They're dug in on 9-11.
[01:49:30.562 --> 01:49:32.104]  They're not going to give an inch on anything.
[01:49:32.925 --> 01:49:47.083]  And Gannon is just really another tool of the Bush propaganda machine that is well-oiled and ready to basically write the story about the videotapes they're now putting out to all these TV stations.
[01:49:47.123 --> 01:49:51.749]  Yeah, we've got to break the fake news reports and just saying, yeah, we're going to do it.
[01:49:53.829 --> 01:49:55.390]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.530 --> 01:49:58.631]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:02.653]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.693 --> 01:50:06.934]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.275 --> 01:50:11.056]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.196 --> 01:50:12.997]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.237 --> 01:50:16.499]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.539 --> 01:50:21.222]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.402 --> 01:50:24.443]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.623 --> 01:50:27.485]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:34.089]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:38.432]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:50:53.351 --> 01:50:57.252]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.472 --> 01:51:02.913]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.193 --> 01:51:13.556]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.716 --> 01:51:18.037]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.117 --> 01:51:19.058]  We're good to go.
[01:51:33.166 --> 01:51:33.627]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.041]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.878 --> 01:52:10.538]  We're good to go!
[01:52:32.506 --> 01:52:34.568]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:39.193]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[01:52:39.413 --> 01:52:42.497]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.657 --> 01:52:48.543]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:08.172 --> 01:53:29.649]  I was going to add for our guest, Greg Siminski, that Greg, as the media consolidates, as they get caught with fake reporters and hundreds of millions of fake newscasts and paying these shows to promote torture, they're just losing their credibility with more and more people and the alternative media is the fastest growing thing out there.
[01:53:30.425 --> 01:53:39.762]  And now about half of the public gets most of their news from alternative media and those numbers are accelerating so we see the mainstream media starting to panic, Greg.
[01:53:41.556 --> 01:53:52.742]  You put it this way, they don't have a choice right now, because one, they're controlled by the advertising dollars, and any time that you have the freedom of speech controlled by money, you're going to not have freedom of speech.
[01:53:53.022 --> 01:54:00.406]  Basically, I don't, trying to figure out terms here, as far as the mainstream and the alternative, I don't consider the alternative the alternative anymore.
[01:54:01.366 --> 01:54:03.748]  Basically, two forms of media in this country right now.
[01:54:03.768 --> 01:54:07.490]  You've got the independent grassroots, real media, and you've got the corporate propaganda.
[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:17.838]  If you want to go and express your opinions and get stories that talk about what's really going on in your country and people that are investigating the issues, you go to the alternative press.
[01:54:18.058 --> 01:54:19.439]  And maybe there should be another name.
[01:54:19.479 --> 01:54:28.185]  When you want to read about players, and you want to read about Michael Jackson, and you want to read about fluff and entertainment, which has a place in society, I'm not saying it doesn't,
[01:54:28.775 --> 01:54:29.455]  That's what they do.
[01:54:29.916 --> 01:54:36.639]  And I don't really think they should enter into territory they can't back up.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.461]  They say we're not the real media when they're not the real media.
[01:54:40.662 --> 01:54:41.122]  Exactly.
[01:54:41.482 --> 01:54:43.583]  They have their place and I always said that.
[01:54:43.623 --> 01:54:48.466]  And that goes from 15, 20 years experience working with them and still having friends in the media.
[01:54:49.119 --> 01:54:55.561]  And in fact, one of my good friends I worked with years ago is a Time correspondent for the Pentagon for the last 15 years, Mark Thompson.
[01:54:55.661 --> 01:54:58.921]  We worked together in Oakland County in the courthouse together in 1978.
[01:55:00.102 --> 01:55:02.542]  And Mark works for Time Magazine.
[01:55:02.822 --> 01:55:08.524]  But anyway, and also a good friend of mine I work with is now the new managing editor of USA Today, Carol Stevens.
[01:55:08.904 --> 01:55:10.404]  I worked with her back in the 70s.
[01:55:10.604 --> 01:55:12.084]  Let's take a call, Greg.
[01:55:12.284 --> 01:55:16.926]  Let's talk to Rarsh in Connecticut.
[01:55:17.026 --> 01:55:18.066]  Rarsh, you're on the air.
[01:55:18.126 --> 01:55:18.566]  Go ahead.
[01:55:19.505 --> 01:55:24.887]  Yeah, I was going to actually make a comment on Terri Schiavo's book.
[01:55:24.927 --> 01:55:25.768]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:55:25.788 --> 01:55:26.728]  Go ahead and make your comment.
[01:55:28.169 --> 01:55:37.933]  Would it be possible for you to maybe repeatedly call for your listeners to send Terri Schiavo the book?
[01:55:38.253 --> 01:55:43.375]  If she can be shown that she can read, it's going to blow the whole idea that she's
[01:55:44.609 --> 01:55:48.151]  Uh, uh, very incapacitated.
[01:55:48.432 --> 01:55:49.732]  The family's done all that.
[01:55:49.752 --> 01:55:51.113]  The family's shown all that.
[01:55:51.954 --> 01:55:53.455]  And, uh, we've shown all that.
[01:55:53.875 --> 01:55:58.658]  And Shivo doesn't even let them in there very much and doesn't let them bring cameras in now.
[01:55:58.678 --> 01:56:01.540]  They had to basically snake a camera in years ago.
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.764]  Wait, he stopped allowing them to bring cameras in?
[01:56:07.784 --> 01:56:08.965]  Last time I talked to him, yeah.
[01:56:09.985 --> 01:56:12.767]  I mean, doesn't anyone kind of find that a little strange?
[01:56:13.143 --> 01:56:28.347]  Also, it looks to me, I mean, if you think about it, if she were in a rehab center, no judge in his right mind would be able to remove any sort of services from her.
[01:56:28.367 --> 01:56:31.147]  Yeah, well, Bush now has sent it to the federal court.
[01:56:32.168 --> 01:56:34.388]  And so that's where it stands right now.
[01:56:34.668 --> 01:56:38.789]  Is there any possibility for her to be moved out of that hospice?
[01:56:38.889 --> 01:56:39.469]  I mean, come on.
[01:56:39.489 --> 01:56:40.450]  Yeah, it's all been tried.
[01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:41.470]  I mean, that's why they're going to court.
[01:56:42.299 --> 01:56:44.420]  They tried to get Shibo where he doesn't have control.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.241]  They tried to get her into other facilities.
[01:56:46.742 --> 01:56:47.902]  Every angle's been hit.
[01:56:48.863 --> 01:56:49.423]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:49.463 --> 01:56:50.043]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:50.604 --> 01:56:55.266]  I want to keep our guest a little bit longer with us because I know we've had callers that we're holding even before our guest got on with us.
[01:56:55.686 --> 01:57:00.669]  Now we'll get to the callers who've been holding, like Delilah and Randy and others, that want to talk to our guest.
[01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:04.131]  We're going to start the third hour here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:08.831 --> 01:57:09.111]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:09.151 --> 01:57:16.035]  And to our guest, Greg, fire out your website one more time.
[01:57:16.776 --> 01:57:22.579]  It's www.arcticbeacon.citymaker.com.
[01:57:23.399 --> 01:57:30.744]  And also on that website you can go to links and find the 9-11 Commission Report that we did for Nationwide Publication.
[01:57:31.364 --> 01:57:33.225]  And that's a www.911citizenscommission.org.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.062]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:40.082 --> 01:57:40.562]  Stay with us.
[01:57:40.882 --> 01:57:41.663]  Big Brother.
[01:57:41.703 --> 01:57:42.344]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.218 --> 01:57:54.318]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.958 --> 01:57:55.839]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.539 --> 01:57:57.459]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.479 --> 01:58:01.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:06.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.201 --> 01:58:18.223]  I've got an important programming note coming up in the next segment, so be sure and stay with us for that.
[01:58:18.423 --> 01:58:19.663]  We're talking to Greg Simensky,
[01:58:21.095 --> 01:58:30.441]  He's a writer for American Free Press, written for a lot of other big publications, and he is joining us to talk about a big report that he broke, a big story he broke.
[01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:33.342]  It's been out there for a while, but he pushed it over the edge.
[01:58:33.703 --> 01:58:44.249]  The perfect terrorist plan to level the Twin Towers, created in 1976 by the Pentagon, even down to Arab terrorists with box cutters.
[01:58:44.309 --> 01:58:49.012]  And then, of course, the popular story they all give us is some drill they did
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:51.561]  A quarter century ago.
[01:58:53.622 --> 01:58:55.882]  Same thing with Northwoods, a few years before that.
[01:58:56.343 --> 01:59:00.965]  Where they said, they didn't just drill, they said, we want to kill Americans, the U.S.
[01:59:01.005 --> 01:59:03.426]  government did, and blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:59:05.046 --> 01:59:08.708]  Going back to Greg, Greg let's go back to the calls.
[01:59:09.728 --> 01:59:11.889]  Let's talk to Delilah in Ohio.
[01:59:11.909 --> 01:59:12.950]  Delilah, thanks for holding.
[01:59:13.670 --> 01:59:15.211]  Hi Alex, hi Greg.
[01:59:15.651 --> 01:59:17.572]  Just wanted to say thanks for
[01:59:18.908 --> 01:59:21.108]  You guys having the courage to bring this out.
[01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:29.510]  Unfortunately, I lost a relative out there at the World Trade Center when it occurred, so I'm always sorry.
[01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:30.190]  That's okay.
[01:59:31.251 --> 01:59:37.652]  I really appreciate the truth being exposed, especially on who did what and why.
[01:59:37.912 --> 01:59:44.914]  What is it like when you watch the news and see the people behind 9-11 up there posing as the saviors?
[01:59:45.694 --> 01:59:46.654]  I get ticked off.
[01:59:47.569 --> 01:59:56.592]  And I just kind of just, I don't really even really watch that much TV or the news, just mostly the weather because I'm so sick and tired of the lies that's out there.
[01:59:56.632 --> 01:59:59.333]  By the way, let me bring this up to our guest.
[01:59:59.813 --> 02:00:07.175]  Greg, did you know major studies have been coming out that large portions of people, upwards of 50%, are just not watching TV anymore?
[02:00:07.195 --> 02:00:09.556]  No, no, I didn't hear about that.
[02:00:10.896 --> 02:00:13.037]  Yeah, it's almost spontaneous.
[02:00:14.117 --> 02:00:14.277]  Wow.
[02:00:15.225 --> 02:00:16.865]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Delilah.
[02:00:17.146 --> 02:00:17.646]  Oh, okay.
[02:00:17.706 --> 02:00:18.726]  Well, yeah.
[02:00:19.066 --> 02:00:22.407]  No, actually, to hear that, I'm not really too surprised.
[02:00:22.867 --> 02:00:32.930]  And I think part of the reason is because people are slowly starting to wake up and starting to see that there's something wrong with the whole picture, that they're just not being told the truth.
[02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:37.492]  And I think as the word spreads very slowly, people are waking up.
[02:00:37.552 --> 02:00:41.573]  And think about it, most of the stuff on TV is just junk anyway.
[02:00:41.693 --> 02:00:44.914]  So I don't waste my time with, I have more productive things.
[02:00:45.034 --> 02:00:49.356]  Exactly, and your loss is something that can't really be put in words.
[02:00:49.876 --> 02:00:56.839]  But what can be done is that it really boils down to what happened on that day to many Americans that were killed.
[02:00:57.419 --> 02:01:00.380]  And we need to have answers in their memory.
[02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:01.921]  That are truthful.
[02:01:02.461 --> 02:01:17.046]  And my belief is that the first person that should be stepping forward for these truthful answers is the leader of our country, who basically is taking the cowardly approach of not even pushing for the truth, but yet hiding it.
[02:01:17.506 --> 02:01:20.267]  And so I think it's abominable, and that alone he should be impeached.
[02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:23.228]  I agree with you 100% on that.
[02:01:23.568 --> 02:01:30.070]  Anyway, my next question is as far as what happens from here, and also I really wanted to know
[02:01:30.946 --> 02:01:35.089]  Uh, what was the update as far as what's going on with the draft?
[02:01:35.269 --> 02:01:36.149]  That's all I wanted to ask.
[02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:37.350]  I'll just listen to the answer.
[02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.710]  Thank you.
[02:01:37.730 --> 02:01:51.518]  Well, I did a story on that, and the last, uh, it was about a month ago, right when Congress convened, and I had talked to, uh, the office, uh, geez, who's the, uh, who's the New York, uh, senator, uh, representative right now.
[02:01:52.119 --> 02:01:53.279]  Escapes my name right now.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:57.362]  Uh, but anyway, uh, basically he was reintroducing
[02:01:58.090 --> 02:01:59.470]  Uh, the draft.
[02:01:59.711 --> 02:02:00.251]  Rangel?
[02:02:00.611 --> 02:02:02.371]  Charlie Rangel, yeah, excuse me, I couldn't remember.
[02:02:02.631 --> 02:02:22.317]  Charlie Rangel was reintroducing a bill that he had wanted to reintroduce in the last session and didn't, and now told me that he was in the next few weeks or so reintroducing the bill to, uh, for conscription, and basically his idea is that he feels that the poor, the rich, should also share, uh... Yeah, that's a shill.
[02:02:22.537 --> 02:02:24.238]  That's a shill to get the left behind it.
[02:02:24.798 --> 02:02:25.319]  Exactly.
[02:02:25.339 --> 02:02:26.800]  The globalists need a war.
[02:02:27.181 --> 02:02:28.803]  They need an expanded war.
[02:02:28.903 --> 02:02:30.885]  And for that they need conscripts.
[02:02:31.465 --> 02:02:34.148]  We'll talk about that when we get back and take more of your calls.
[02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:35.450]  Or our guests at 800-259-9231.
[02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:36.131]  Wide open telephones.
[02:02:36.151 --> 02:02:37.652]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:45.623 --> 02:02:49.950]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:54.577]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.717 --> 02:02:59.124]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.164 --> 02:03:00.506]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.268 --> 02:03:06.493]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.553 --> 02:03:13.501]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.621 --> 02:03:15.644]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.984 --> 02:03:26.446]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.606 --> 02:03:32.007]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:46.733 --> 02:03:47.774]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.095 --> 02:03:50.878]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.138 --> 02:03:55.303]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.743 --> 02:03:56.564]  So what do you do?
[02:03:56.885 --> 02:04:01.450]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:01.930 --> 02:04:04.051]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.552 --> 02:04:05.452]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:04:05.832 --> 02:04:09.554]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[02:04:45.407 --> 02:04:48.549]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:04:48.749 --> 02:04:51.450]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.031]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:04:53.211 --> 02:05:03.096]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:05:03.336 --> 02:05:05.077]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[02:05:05.357 --> 02:05:09.220]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:05:09.461 --> 02:05:13.884]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:05:14.084 --> 02:05:17.927]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:05:18.168 --> 02:05:24.373]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:05:24.533 --> 02:05:27.275]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:05:27.515 --> 02:05:30.838]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[02:05:30.938 --> 02:05:34.821]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[02:05:34.941 --> 02:05:38.784]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:05:39.045 --> 02:05:43.328]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[02:05:45.850 --> 02:05:48.072]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.632 --> 02:05:51.415]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.236 --> 02:06:05.120]  Alright, here's a little program announcement 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:06.501 --> 02:06:12.766]  You know, this broadcast goes out on a growing list of just wonderful, brave AM and FM affiliates.
[02:06:12.846 --> 02:06:13.347]  People that
[02:06:15.157 --> 02:06:17.599]  Know that this broadcast is backed up by fact.
[02:06:17.819 --> 02:06:24.905]  Know that we post, neurotically, almost everything we talk about here from mainstream, alternative, or government documents.
[02:06:26.886 --> 02:06:29.548]  And folks that also know this broadcast gets ratings.
[02:06:29.708 --> 02:06:31.610]  People are hungry for the truth.
[02:06:34.112 --> 02:06:35.813]  So you can listen on the AM and FM dial.
[02:06:35.853 --> 02:06:36.794]  Got a lot of new affiliates.
[02:06:36.894 --> 02:06:38.095]  Also Global Shortwave.
[02:06:39.296 --> 02:06:40.336]  Our World Service.
[02:06:40.937 --> 02:06:43.459]  I get letters from Africa and Asia.
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.880]  From Latin America.
[02:06:47.841 --> 02:06:51.822]  You can listen during the day at 9.985 or is it 9.987?
[02:06:52.562 --> 02:06:53.042]  I forget.
[02:06:53.502 --> 02:06:56.623]  And at night from 9 to midnight central at 3210.
[02:06:58.763 --> 02:07:01.084]  So, six hours a day on shortwave.
[02:07:01.944 --> 02:07:05.165]  And also the internet, one of our fastest growing areas.
[02:07:05.445 --> 02:07:08.745]  And this network has four different internet streams.
[02:07:09.806 --> 02:07:11.766]  During the day I'm on all four of them.
[02:07:13.664 --> 02:07:15.406]  Network 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[02:07:16.226 --> 02:07:22.071]  And we are routinely, in fact the show is almost always, just one of our streams, number one on Shoutcast.
[02:07:22.091 --> 02:07:24.733]  It tracks how many people are listening to what.
[02:07:24.813 --> 02:07:26.235]  It just gives the basic numbers.
[02:07:26.975 --> 02:07:27.956]  You can go to it online.
[02:07:28.757 --> 02:07:33.381]  One of my streams normally is beating out AP Radio and big syndicated shows.
[02:07:35.222 --> 02:07:38.505]  And then you add up all my other streams and I'm always number one.
[02:07:39.366 --> 02:07:40.967]  And a lot of other folks on the network get
[02:07:42.557 --> 02:07:45.899]  About a third or half way, you know, as many listeners.
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:56.545]  Which is great, I mean, the point is, is that Ted Anderson, that owns this network, has been giving it away for free.
[02:07:57.145 --> 02:08:06.190]  Whereas you look at some of the biggest shows in the country, you look at Rush Limbaugh, other shows, they have to charge.
[02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:08.051]  And I don't blame them for charging.
[02:08:08.692 --> 02:08:21.425]  Because, believe me, you start getting tens of thousands of people an hour, hundreds of thousands during a show, millions during a week, listening to your radio show, I mean, you start getting 10, 15, $20,000 bills.
[02:08:22.526 --> 02:08:24.148]  I'm sure it's a lot higher with Rush Limbaugh.
[02:08:25.129 --> 02:08:31.295]  So, Ted Anderson bumped the quality of the audio on the free streams from 16 bits to 8 bits a few years ago.
[02:08:31.375 --> 02:08:32.056]  Well, it didn't matter.
[02:08:32.921 --> 02:08:36.944]  Sounds like you're listening to two, you know, with a string in between two Campbell Soup cans.
[02:08:37.505 --> 02:08:38.206]  It's not that bad.
[02:08:38.246 --> 02:08:39.106]  It's pretty good, actually.
[02:08:39.387 --> 02:08:41.669]  But the point is, you can mess with your equalizer and make it better.
[02:08:42.129 --> 02:08:43.770]  The point is, is that we had to do that.
[02:08:45.252 --> 02:08:48.394]  And he also gave out some free 16-bit streams, but they were limited.
[02:08:48.434 --> 02:08:53.739]  You know, let's say only 1,000 people or 500 could listen on those higher bandwidth streams.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:09:06.044]  And then offered subscriptions to 32-bit, which sounds really good, you know, music quality for people that, I don't know, pay $9.95 a month or something, just trying to pay for the bandwidth.
[02:09:06.724 --> 02:09:09.785]  But most people go and then they just listen to the free one.
[02:09:10.285 --> 02:09:18.808]  So Ted last week goes, well, I'm going to start knocking people off the 16-bit stream every 25 minutes, and then go listen to the 8-bit.
[02:09:19.708 --> 02:09:22.209]  And I said, well, that's fine, Ted, but people aren't going to know.
[02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:24.971]  How to go find the other free streams.
[02:09:24.991 --> 02:09:25.852]  They just don't know.
[02:09:27.492 --> 02:09:33.856]  And we have a smart audience, but I mean, the average American, literally a lot of them don't really know how meat gets in the packages at the store.
[02:09:34.256 --> 02:09:38.578]  I've had people ask me, how can you be on the radio in Austin, be on the radio in Kansas City?
[02:09:38.638 --> 02:09:40.079]  I go, well, satellite.
[02:09:40.119 --> 02:09:41.380]  You've seen Peter Jennings, right?
[02:09:42.681 --> 02:09:48.264]  I'm just saying, people find a link on a website, they use that link for years, it changes, it knocks them off.
[02:09:48.744 --> 02:09:50.505]  And I'm getting just deluge with emails.
[02:09:51.372 --> 02:09:57.457]  And if you're having problems listening on the internet, you need to call the network and tell them about it.
[02:09:58.077 --> 02:09:59.719]  And that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[02:09:59.759 --> 02:10:02.941]  You need to call 877-996-4327, extension 101, and let them answer your questions.
[02:10:12.603 --> 02:10:17.406]  That's the number for you to call, boys and girls, because I can't handle 20, 30, 40 emails a day.
[02:10:17.766 --> 02:10:21.909]  Faxes, phone calls, people calling up, asking the folks running my show what they can do.
[02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:24.170]  Now, here's some answers.
[02:10:25.291 --> 02:10:28.453]  During the day, I'm on stream one through four.
[02:10:29.934 --> 02:10:30.334]  Okay?
[02:10:30.894 --> 02:10:37.238]  And if you go max out one of the other streams, you know, the thousands of listeners per stream, you've got to move over to another stream.
[02:10:38.661 --> 02:10:46.386]  What's happening is, people are going to streams 3 and 4, which kick you off in 25 minutes.
[02:10:48.067 --> 02:10:48.487]  Okay.
[02:10:49.167 --> 02:10:51.869]  And then they don't know you can go to other streams that are always there.
[02:10:52.770 --> 02:10:54.351]  And those streams are 1 and 2, right?
[02:10:56.232 --> 02:10:57.633]  Those are streams 1 and 2, correct?
[02:10:58.373 --> 02:10:59.694]  Got them popping in my ear, folks.
[02:11:00.174 --> 02:11:01.735]  I'm like George Bush, I've got an earpiece.
[02:11:01.835 --> 02:11:02.435]  I'm joking.
[02:11:03.036 --> 02:11:04.217]  It's like a remote every day.
[02:11:04.237 --> 02:11:05.317]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:11:05.677 --> 02:11:06.178]  They're up in
[02:11:07.737 --> 02:11:08.297]  Minnesota.
[02:11:08.697 --> 02:11:09.798]  So, 1 and 2.
[02:11:09.878 --> 02:11:13.299]  You go to GCNlive.com, go to the schedule, go to ListenLive.
[02:11:13.339 --> 02:11:15.319]  It's right there at the top of the page.
[02:11:15.339 --> 02:11:15.679]  1 and 2.
[02:11:15.919 --> 02:11:17.000]  Okay?
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:18.660]  During the day, you can always get me there.
[02:11:20.781 --> 02:11:23.842]  At night, you can always get me on 2 and 4.
[02:11:24.302 --> 02:11:28.923]  And 2 isn't unlimited, but it's a big stream, and 4 is limited.
[02:11:29.563 --> 02:11:30.924]  So, c'est la vie.
[02:11:31.604 --> 02:11:32.604]  Complain to Ted Anderson.
[02:11:34.225 --> 02:11:34.805]  Extension 101, folks.
[02:11:36.818 --> 02:11:38.660]  All right, let's go back to my guest.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.366]  I appreciate you holding the last three or four minutes while I babbled about that, Greg.
[02:11:43.727 --> 02:11:48.493]  But I'll tell you, it's a good problem to have, Greg, that we're having trouble supplying everybody.
[02:11:48.993 --> 02:11:50.315]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:11:50.355 --> 02:11:51.917]  The more the merrier.
[02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.219]  You've got to get the word out.
[02:11:54.474 --> 02:11:59.036]  Now, that question the last caller brought up was about the draft.
[02:11:59.056 --> 02:12:00.157]  You've written stories on this.
[02:12:00.197 --> 02:12:02.578]  They've got bills in the House, bills in the Senate.
[02:12:02.598 --> 02:12:04.639]  They've reinstituted the draft boards.
[02:12:04.679 --> 02:12:06.500]  They've doubled the funding for Selective Service.
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:08.501]  The Pentagon has said we need a draft.
[02:12:08.541 --> 02:12:13.904]  Bill Clinton's last study he did before he left office was for a national draft, which I found to be pretty comical.
[02:12:15.185 --> 02:12:18.628]  So now Rangel goes, oh, it's just liberal.
[02:12:18.928 --> 02:12:21.150]  My bill is to make these rich white people go to war.
[02:12:21.190 --> 02:12:27.135]  Well, we all know they're not going to, but that's to con the left into getting behind this war when I said I was right.
[02:12:27.495 --> 02:12:28.016]  Exactly.
[02:12:28.076 --> 02:12:31.759]  And basically, I talked to his office about a month ago, and they're supposed to introduce it this term.
[02:12:31.839 --> 02:12:32.399]  So we'll see.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:34.161]  That was their word.
[02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:35.222]  That's as far as I've gotten.
[02:12:35.262 --> 02:12:36.603]  I haven't seen it being introduced yet.
[02:12:37.561 --> 02:12:40.023]  Well, but it was introduced in the last couple sessions.
[02:12:40.424 --> 02:12:49.052]  Yeah, they just, it was introduced at the last session, but that was before the elections and no one wanted to touch it, so they kind of said they'd wait.
[02:12:49.773 --> 02:12:53.616]  But we have another convenient terror attack.
[02:12:53.656 --> 02:12:59.681]  Basically, Kerry was in a... Rangel found himself in a funny position because of Kerry's position.
[02:13:00.402 --> 02:13:04.505]  And that was before the elections, and there was no way anything was going to happen then.
[02:13:04.546 --> 02:13:16.836]  But now, after the election, after no one's got anything to lose, I expect, you know, with the problems that I hear from talking to the military... In fact, I was at the anti-war rally yesterday in Los Angeles, or Saturday in Los Angeles,
[02:13:17.336 --> 02:13:29.402]  Talked to a number of Veterans for Peace, a number of Iraqi veterans who were there against the war, against Bush, and basically telling me that the military is having a hard time getting people now.
[02:13:30.662 --> 02:13:40.707]  And reports in LA are this, they're basically at Compton, at the lower, in the black neighborhoods, in the poor neighborhoods, every day.
[02:13:41.651 --> 02:13:43.293]  And, uh, trying to get recruits.
[02:13:43.953 --> 02:13:48.817]  And, well, uh, you can't find a soul in Brentwood or, uh, Beverly Hills.
[02:13:49.438 --> 02:13:51.420]  So, basically, that's what's going on.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:58.426]  I picture what'll happen is when they don't have enough, uh, boots, they're gonna have to find a way, and this is what'll happen.
[02:13:58.526 --> 02:14:01.388]  So, uh... Well, there'll be a convenient terrorist attack.
[02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:03.811]  And then, oh, see, we were hit again.
[02:14:03.851 --> 02:14:05.752]  We never thought it would happen, but it has to happen.
[02:14:05.792 --> 02:14:06.533]  Look, here's the numbers.
[02:14:07.274 --> 02:14:13.018]  We've got 150,000 troops in Iraq, 45,000 are actual combat troops, the rest are support.
[02:14:13.358 --> 02:14:15.480]  The Pentagon says 450,000.
[02:14:17.061 --> 02:14:20.964]  Every branch of the military except the Air Force, even the Marines aren't getting their number now.
[02:14:22.065 --> 02:14:24.046]  But what the Pentagon does is after they don't get
[02:14:24.628 --> 02:14:26.269]  You know something, Alex?
[02:14:26.289 --> 02:14:28.031]  Nothing amazes me about what they do.
[02:14:53.999 --> 02:14:55.980]  Basically, I look at it this way.
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:07.084]  People have to wake up because if you look at the definition of fascism, it's a system of government marked by a centralization authority under a dictator or one rule, one power, one person.
[02:15:07.104 --> 02:15:07.765]  That's Bush.
[02:15:08.365 --> 02:15:10.526]  Stringent socioeconomic controls.
[02:15:10.846 --> 02:15:15.428]  What's happening with our economy and what's happening with the Patriot Act and our society.
[02:15:15.868 --> 02:15:18.549]  Suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship.
[02:15:19.269 --> 02:15:23.031]  We talked about that, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism.
[02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:25.932]  That doesn't sound like what we're under right now.
[02:15:26.253 --> 02:15:29.154]  Alberto Gonzales in the memo said Bush is the law.
[02:15:29.434 --> 02:15:30.435]  He is above the law.
[02:15:30.455 --> 02:15:42.641]  Yeah, and that's another disturbing factor in our government is how we've mixed church and state together now, which basically our founding fathers would roll over in their graves over.
[02:15:43.642 --> 02:15:53.089]  Well, I mean, this whole faith-based initiative is going to pay the churches off, but I'm sure you heard that Gonzales, in the torture memo, said Bush is above the law.
[02:15:53.449 --> 02:16:12.042]  Yeah, exactly, and that goes... I did a story about another judge that was just appointed here in the Ninth Circuit, and he worked with Gonzales to put together the legal opinion that justified torture and justified skirting the international laws of human rights.
[02:16:14.036 --> 02:16:25.784]  Now, this judge, I call him the torture judge here, he's been appointed for a lifetime position on the bench here on the Ninth Circuit, and he's basically, professes the same thing that Gonzalez does.
[02:16:25.885 --> 02:16:28.727]  But Alberto said Bush is also above federal law.
[02:16:29.007 --> 02:16:29.487]  Exactly.
[02:16:29.607 --> 02:16:32.870]  Everybody knows the executive executes law, it doesn't make law.
[02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:33.570]  Exactly.
[02:16:34.271 --> 02:16:34.991]  It's ridiculous.
[02:16:35.071 --> 02:16:42.477]  It's people that have gone too far with their political ideas and not put the country or its people
[02:16:43.067 --> 02:16:44.148]  At all in their thoughts.
[02:16:44.208 --> 02:16:46.590]  And it's a very, very sad situation.
[02:16:47.872 --> 02:16:49.293]  And one that we must address.
[02:16:49.333 --> 02:16:53.036]  And I think one senator that is addressing it is Robert Byrd.
[02:16:53.176 --> 02:16:54.618]  And he recently came out.
[02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:55.679]  So the words, when you say,
[02:16:56.432 --> 02:17:02.513]  Bush is like Hitler, and I've heard you say it many times, it is not an exaggeration or it's not a radical idea anymore.
[02:17:02.913 --> 02:17:21.977]  Senator Byrd just recently, when Bush is now trying to push in his 12, I call them the 12 angry judges, that were stopped into the federal judgeship positions last term because of the Senate filibuster, Democratic filibuster, Bush is now trying to change the Senate rules to get these guys in.
[02:17:22.537 --> 02:17:25.918]  And Byrd came out literally recently and said that Bush
[02:17:26.525 --> 02:17:28.106]  We're going to take calls on the other side.
[02:17:45.905 --> 02:17:46.946]  Are you losing your hair?
[02:17:47.286 --> 02:17:48.727]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[02:17:49.067 --> 02:17:50.208]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[02:17:50.748 --> 02:17:52.409]  Why aren't you using Avocor?

[02:21:59.818 --> 02:22:01.078]  Alright, let's go quickly.
[02:22:01.098 --> 02:22:02.699]  Dave in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:22:02.779 --> 02:22:03.139]  Welcome.
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:13.383]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say I have a sister that worked for Tanner Fitzgerald in Dallas and on 9-11 they were able to hear the screams of all the people in the building.
[02:22:14.503 --> 02:22:15.003]  It was terrible.
[02:22:16.424 --> 02:22:17.984]  How were they able to hear the screams?
[02:22:18.004 --> 02:22:22.166]  They had a telephone link that was set up with their office in the Dallas office.
[02:22:24.571 --> 02:22:25.151]  From New York.
[02:22:25.611 --> 02:22:33.455]  Hey, you think it's another coincidence that they had another drill with men with box cutters and the exact targets in 1976 funded by the Pentagon?
[02:22:33.875 --> 02:22:34.915]  Alex, it was all set up.
[02:22:34.955 --> 02:22:37.837]  You know that, and I know that, but not too many people do.
[02:22:38.717 --> 02:22:43.499]  The one thing that got me researching 9-11 was the fall of Building No.
[02:22:43.879 --> 02:22:43.499]  7.
[02:22:43.939 --> 02:22:47.641]  When I saw that happen live on television, I said, this isn't right.
[02:22:47.681 --> 02:22:49.222]  This looks like a controlled demolition.
[02:22:49.282 --> 02:22:52.303]  Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, all say the same thing.
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:23:00.486]  And they did a lot of independent research and found out a lot of things, and I was just thoroughly convinced that they let it happen.
[02:23:00.706 --> 02:23:05.611]  And then after more research, I'm of the conclusion that they not only let it happen, they made it happen.
[02:23:05.951 --> 02:23:09.614]  Well, they count on us being naive suckers, and they laugh at us, Greg.
[02:23:09.634 --> 02:23:16.520]  Yes, and I would just say to the caller to basically tell as many people as you can
[02:23:17.282 --> 02:23:24.506]  To research it and do the same thing you did, the same process, because this is the only way that we're ever going to get any accountability.
[02:23:25.107 --> 02:23:29.029]  And I applaud you for your efforts.
[02:23:29.749 --> 02:23:33.532]  Alex, actually, I stayed away from your website because I thought you were a New World Order nut.
[02:23:35.112 --> 02:23:39.675]  And the more research I did, the more I said, maybe there's something to this Alex Jones guy.
[02:23:40.576 --> 02:23:42.157]  And I've come to respect a lot of your work.
[02:23:42.337 --> 02:23:43.177]  Well, thank you, Dave.
[02:23:43.197 --> 02:23:44.538]  Look, Dave, I wish I was wrong.
[02:23:45.243 --> 02:23:46.083]  Every day I wish it.
[02:23:46.223 --> 02:23:54.387]  I mean, this whole weekend I just thought about how sad it is that there's so many good, decent people and such beautiful communities and so much good in the world.
[02:23:54.867 --> 02:23:58.948]  I don't like focusing on the negative, but the evil is in control at the top.
[02:23:59.429 --> 02:24:00.989]  It controls all the political parties.
[02:24:01.049 --> 02:24:01.810]  It's in command.
[02:24:02.430 --> 02:24:05.531]  And none of us are safe until we face what it's really doing.
[02:24:05.551 --> 02:24:06.051]  Thanks, Dave.
[02:24:06.752 --> 02:24:07.632]  Any comments on that?
[02:24:09.188 --> 02:24:12.189]  Yeah, Alex, I couldn't have said it any better.
[02:24:12.209 --> 02:24:17.931]  I believe that we have to really, really now fight back.
[02:24:19.591 --> 02:24:31.315]  Because our country is basically in jeopardy because of a small group of people who want to push along their agenda, which I believe is not the agenda that most Americans would agree with.
[02:24:31.375 --> 02:24:33.815]  And that's basically what a democracy is all about.
[02:24:33.835 --> 02:24:36.256]  I do not consider America a democracy anymore.
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:39.881]  Well, we're a republic, and we've certainly gotten away from that.
[02:24:39.961 --> 02:24:42.982]  And I would just tell people, look, we're in danger, folks.
[02:24:43.002 --> 02:24:47.984]  We've got people running things that'll kill 3,000 of us just like that.
[02:24:48.564 --> 02:24:50.165]  I mean, they're ruthless.
[02:24:50.205 --> 02:24:52.025]  Let's talk to Steve in Kansas City.
[02:24:52.405 --> 02:24:53.026]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:24:53.046 --> 02:24:53.586]  You're on the air.
[02:24:54.066 --> 02:24:54.846]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:24:54.906 --> 02:24:55.747]  Mr. Scaminici.
[02:24:56.047 --> 02:24:56.167]  Hi.
[02:24:56.267 --> 02:24:58.768]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:24:59.748 --> 02:25:05.070]  There may not be that small of a people that are running this country that is what you said.
[02:25:06.324 --> 02:25:23.097]  My comment is, or question is, what do you know about the papacy, the Pope running all the political aspects and controlling these things in the Jesuit society?
[02:25:23.337 --> 02:25:26.780]  You know, I hear that all the time, and I just don't see the evidence.
[02:25:27.301 --> 02:25:29.983]  Well, I mean, there's a couple of books out there.
[02:25:30.063 --> 02:25:31.424]  No, I know, I know there are.
[02:25:32.003 --> 02:25:35.845]  I mean, yeah, that could open up a can of worms, you know, put a target on your back.
[02:25:36.626 --> 02:25:38.047]  Well, no, it's not that.
[02:25:38.087 --> 02:25:40.088]  I mean, I'll say it if I believe it's true.
[02:25:40.148 --> 02:25:42.049]  I mean, is the Catholic Church controlled?
[02:25:42.089 --> 02:25:42.409]  Yes.
[02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:44.190]  Is the Protestant Church controlled?
[02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.511]  Yes.
[02:25:45.251 --> 02:25:46.332]  Are the Democrats controlled?
[02:25:46.372 --> 02:25:46.712]  Yes.
[02:25:46.912 --> 02:25:48.753]  Are the big Jewish groups controlled?
[02:25:48.793 --> 02:25:49.093]  Yes.
[02:25:49.734 --> 02:25:56.458]  I mean, the globalists have got the money, they've got the printing presses, they've been able to buy and take control of everything.
[02:25:56.478 --> 02:26:01.381]  Well, that's in 19, you know, all the way back, you know, when they tried to start the Central Bank.
[02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:31.808]  uh... what became the federal reserve that was all and i'm just saying whenever you put one label on one group what it does is it balkanizes people i mean look if we're against evil and we're against corruption what does it matter if it's jews or germans or whatever evil people can't we all agree we're gonna fight evil well no there's good there's good news there's good germans there's good you know communists there's there's good people out there but i was just wondering what you or mister
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:35.843]  I don't think you can focus on just one society or one organization.
[02:26:35.863 --> 02:26:40.228]  I think what you have to look at when you talk about who controls the moves of our government
[02:26:52.339 --> 02:27:18.418]  I think basically you look towards a more or less a global group of very wealthy people whether you want to call them the Bilderberg Society which is an interesting place to start researching who basically does make the decisions and I think you have such a such a corporate and governmental mesh now that one is the same as the other so when you say yes our country is run by someone else
[02:27:18.982 --> 02:27:24.146]  Yes, who it is, I think, is something that you look to, you follow the money.
[02:27:24.866 --> 02:27:27.088]  Greg, I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:27:27.108 --> 02:27:28.269]  Steve, stay there, we'll talk more.
[02:27:28.289 --> 02:27:29.710]  We'll have you back on soon, sir.
[02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:31.011]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:27:31.311 --> 02:27:31.932]  Thank you, bye-bye.
[02:27:32.412 --> 02:27:33.413]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:27:36.115 --> 02:27:37.056]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.516 --> 02:27:39.117]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.018 --> 02:27:42.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:52.293]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:27:52.453 --> 02:27:53.514]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:27:53.614 --> 02:27:54.514]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:27:54.614 --> 02:27:57.456]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:27:57.656 --> 02:28:02.558]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:28:02.779 --> 02:28:03.879]  Check out this new product.
[02:28:04.019 --> 02:28:06.901]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:28:07.281 --> 02:28:10.943]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:28:11.203 --> 02:28:13.725]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:28:13.745 --> 02:28:18.728]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:28:19.008 --> 02:28:22.130]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:27.654]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:28:27.734 --> 02:28:28.494]  Try No-B-O.
[02:28:28.635 --> 02:28:29.595]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:28:30.776 --> 02:28:31.116]  No B.O.
[02:28:31.156 --> 02:28:33.678]  is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:28:33.858 --> 02:28:36.721]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B.O.
[02:28:36.921 --> 02:28:39.383]  Check out their website at no-b.o.com.
[02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:42.825]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No B.O.
[02:28:43.086 --> 02:28:43.806]  at no-b.o.com.
[02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:47.890]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:52.111]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.251 --> 02:28:55.152]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.212 --> 02:29:01.934]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.114 --> 02:29:05.115]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.335 --> 02:29:07.736]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.836 --> 02:29:15.738]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:16.438 --> 02:29:18.019]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:18.980]  MTBE.
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:19.480]  Radon 222.
[02:29:20.081 --> 02:29:22.082]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:29:22.222 --> 02:29:27.326]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:29:27.466 --> 02:29:35.112]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.152 --> 02:29:36.873]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:48.044 --> 02:29:53.529]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.969 --> 02:29:58.193]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.433 --> 02:30:05.480]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:11.966]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.106 --> 02:30:13.307]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.647 --> 02:30:16.591]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.752 --> 02:30:17.653]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:30:17.713 --> 02:30:18.754]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:19.095 --> 02:30:26.345]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:26.625 --> 02:30:30.010]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:30.430 --> 02:30:33.511]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:33.531 --> 02:30:33.571]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.591 --> 02:30:33.671]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.711 --> 02:30:34.772]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.832 --> 02:30:35.112]  Call today.
[02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:36.632]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:36.652 --> 02:30:38.373]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:31:05.731 --> 02:31:08.813]  Alright, Steve, Tim, Chris, many others, your calls are coming up.
[02:31:08.853 --> 02:31:11.214]  I do have some other important news I want to hit on here.
[02:31:16.177 --> 02:31:20.960]  Before I go back to Steve, let me just first get this out, then I'll have him comment on what I say.
[02:31:23.121 --> 02:31:33.367]  You know, I got into fighting the New World Order just because I'd read a lot of history books, a lot of alternative history, I'd studied human systems, just a little bit.
[02:31:34.218 --> 02:31:45.143]  But again, most people don't even know who their congressman is, or... Basic, basic human history, so I guess I'm a little unusual, and then I know something about it.
[02:31:46.684 --> 02:31:48.865]  Which is almost Greek to everybody else.
[02:31:50.546 --> 02:32:01.071]  And when you look at, you know, the Catholics, and the Jews, and the Protestants, and the Chinese, and the Japanese, and the South Africans, and
[02:32:02.328 --> 02:32:27.703]  Arab traitors, and when you begin looking at the Inquisition, or you look at the Crusades, or you look at mercantilism, looking at all these different periods and different individuals, different things that happened, basically, you do have these global elites, these different power groups, fighting with each other.
[02:32:28.703 --> 02:32:30.104]  And it's all cloak and dagger.
[02:32:30.204 --> 02:32:31.865]  It's covert.
[02:32:32.708 --> 02:32:39.311]  Secret societies were simply the old term for what is an intelligence agency today.
[02:32:41.572 --> 02:32:51.337]  The Mafia, the Italian Mafia, grew out of the different Sicilian families in Sicily and then in Italy proper.
[02:32:52.918 --> 02:33:00.702]  And they'll admit that above them is an even more secret Masonic group that is one of the most powerful in the world.
[02:33:02.645 --> 02:33:12.614]  And then you hear that supposedly Catholics and Masons are at odds with each other, but then you find out at higher levels that basically Masons have gotten control of the Catholic Church.
[02:33:14.015 --> 02:33:18.640]  And then you argue with the local Masons who are low-level, who think, hey, my group's good.
[02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:21.803]  We're here to help humanity, because they're not higher level.
[02:33:22.263 --> 02:33:27.428]  They're compartmentalized, like the cops, like the bureaucrats, like the school teachers,
[02:33:28.786 --> 02:33:32.389]  It's about compartmentalization, and I have studied it.
[02:33:33.090 --> 02:33:33.991]  I have looked at it.
[02:33:34.932 --> 02:33:39.916]  My new film, Martial Law, really answers the question.
[02:33:40.777 --> 02:33:49.065]  The whole last hour, it's a two and a half hour plus film, deals with the death societies.
[02:33:50.346 --> 02:33:51.507]  The orders of death.
[02:33:53.988 --> 02:34:01.992]  Because when you get right down to it, folks, you've got groups that will tell you how they're Jewish and they're going to take care of the Jews, if the Jews just follow them.
[02:34:02.012 --> 02:34:07.534]  And you've got the Catholic groups, oh, just be good little Catholics and follow your leaders and you'll be fine.
[02:34:08.935 --> 02:34:19.840]  You've got the Protestant leaders doing the same thing, and folks, they all go, they all meet, just like a mafia commission, just like you'd think of, you know, the classical mafia.
[02:34:20.962 --> 02:34:33.009]  They all go, that's what a Bilderberg group meeting is, you got the top Arabs there from the House of Saud, you got the top Jews there, you got the top Nazis there, you got them all there.
[02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:36.871]  And they all like the same stuff.
[02:34:37.352 --> 02:34:47.658]  Death, machine guns, black masks, terror attacks, secret arrests, tiny elites consolidating wealth through government control.
[02:34:49.551 --> 02:34:55.594]  And so if I go out and I say the Catholics are bad, well that turns off a lot of Catholics.
[02:34:55.674 --> 02:35:01.298]  Now, if Catholics themselves were bad, I would get on the air and say Catholics are bad.
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:11.123]  But if the average Catholic per person you talk to is a good, nice, hard-working person,
[02:35:12.185 --> 02:35:17.987]  You know, the way to wake them up to something isn't to go, you are the spawn of Satan, you are possessed by the devil!
[02:35:18.527 --> 02:35:29.071]  Or to, you know, go and say, because there's... Now, see, if I go and I approach it like this, and by the way, that means approaching it through fact, the truth is always the way to approach it.
[02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:29.992]  It's strange.
[02:35:31.152 --> 02:35:41.876]  If I went on the air and I said, the Jews are the seed of the devil, the Jews are scheming ways to enslave you,
[02:35:44.801 --> 02:35:46.882]  Well, I'd turn off all the Jews, number one.
[02:35:46.942 --> 02:35:48.562]  Number two, I'd turn off a lot of other people.
[02:35:50.342 --> 02:35:59.045]  But see, by not mincing words and telling the truth, I get all the Jews who are good people to be fans of the broadcast.
[02:35:59.165 --> 02:36:03.646]  Just like I can get all the Catholics who are good people to listen to the show.
[02:36:04.346 --> 02:36:05.806]  The bad Catholics aren't going to listen.
[02:36:05.826 --> 02:36:09.707]  People that know, who are on the inside of it, who like defrauding people.
[02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:10.948]  It's the same thing.
[02:36:10.968 --> 02:36:11.868]  I'm a Protestant.
[02:36:12.699 --> 02:36:16.621]  But I don't defend Pat Robertson when he says forced abortion is good.
[02:36:16.641 --> 02:36:18.322]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:19.043 --> 02:36:22.625]  I don't defend Pat Robertson when he says, oh, the implantable chip isn't the mark of the beast.
[02:36:23.045 --> 02:36:23.846]  Go ahead and take it.
[02:36:24.686 --> 02:36:26.047]  A lot of people get mad at me.
[02:36:26.387 --> 02:36:29.909]  But, I mean, he did say those things, so I've got to talk about it.
[02:36:31.831 --> 02:36:33.512]  Jay Succulos did a lot of good work.
[02:36:34.372 --> 02:36:36.393]  Now, suddenly, he's out promoting the Patriot Act.
[02:36:36.473 --> 02:36:37.654]  I've got to say that's wrong.
[02:36:41.823 --> 02:36:42.984]  This is so important.
[02:36:45.666 --> 02:36:47.847]  I'm against organized crime.
[02:36:49.649 --> 02:37:04.840]  And folks, there was organized crime in China 2,000 years ago, before a single Jew ever took a step there, before a single Vatican assassin ever showed up there.
[02:37:06.184 --> 02:37:13.510]  There was evil, there was all the same secret societies, subterfuge, backstabbing, assassinations, all of it.
[02:37:15.071 --> 02:37:20.194]  Long before a Westerner touched in Japan, same stuff was going on.
[02:37:22.396 --> 02:37:30.142]  Before a white man ever took a step into Africa, all the slave trading, the murdering, the killing, it was all going on.
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:36.402]  I'm against Jewish organized crime.
[02:37:37.322 --> 02:37:42.506]  And Jewish organized crime, that's what the ADL was set up for, by the way.
[02:37:43.507 --> 02:37:47.250]  This is admitted in different court cases of prominent gangsters.
[02:37:51.593 --> 02:37:56.397]  They would just go and really go after people and call them names and smear them if they stood up to them.
[02:37:56.837 --> 02:38:01.541]  Well, I mean, if you want to go after Jewish mafia, don't go after them because they're Jewish, go after them because they're mafia.
[02:38:02.276 --> 02:38:05.797]  It's like if you go after the Italian Mafia, you don't go after Italians.
[02:38:06.817 --> 02:38:10.878]  What, you got about 10 million Italians in this country and maybe 3,000 of them are in the Mafia?
[02:38:13.039 --> 02:38:18.920]  So, I mean, it's like a lot of black folks think all white people don't like them or are racist.
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:20.761]  Again, they're stereotyping.
[02:38:22.721 --> 02:38:30.443]  But again, the Italian Mafia, the WASP Mafia, which by the way is the biggest, runs things down here in Texas, I'm here to tell you.
[02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:58.426]  uh... the wasp mafia they're so establishment that they own all the big banks and they're in all the big power positions teamed up with the jewish mafia you don't even know there was ever a wasp mafia or it's little subgroups the irish german mafia because they own the newspapers they're not going to tattle on themselves and so you've got all these mafias and they meet in commission meetings that's what Bilderberg group is
[02:39:00.313 --> 02:39:13.739]  And the helicopters and the troops guard it, and the armored limousines drive in, and you got the head Saudis who are into the same degenerate stuff the Jewish Mafia's in, that the Protestant Mafia's in, that the... They're all just mafias.
[02:39:14.319 --> 02:39:15.460]  They operate the same way.
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:16.820]  These are models of control.
[02:39:17.421 --> 02:39:23.123]  And they all sit around their big commission meetings, and they say, well, we all agree to keep the slaves in the dark.
[02:39:23.944 --> 02:39:26.845]  We all agree to continue our programs of putting biometrics in.
[02:39:28.251 --> 02:39:33.873]  They agree on the baseball diamond or on the gridiron, on the board, how the board is set up.
[02:39:33.913 --> 02:39:35.173]  They maintain the board.
[02:39:35.233 --> 02:39:36.773]  They cut the grass.
[02:39:37.314 --> 02:39:38.234]  That's the New World Order.
[02:39:38.274 --> 02:39:39.414]  That's the controlled media.
[02:39:39.454 --> 02:39:43.215]  That's the, you know, they paint the turnstiles.
[02:39:45.276 --> 02:39:48.837]  Looking at this suede grid as some type of sports stadium is the analogy.
[02:39:50.157 --> 02:39:53.338]  They all agree on maintaining that and expanding it and doing that.
[02:39:55.559 --> 02:39:56.699]  On conning the suckers,
[02:39:58.143 --> 02:39:59.805]  But they do fight with each other.
[02:40:01.346 --> 02:40:02.827]  They do assassinate each other.
[02:40:02.867 --> 02:40:04.308]  They do squabble.
[02:40:04.409 --> 02:40:07.691]  And it's all who can calculate the best.
[02:40:07.751 --> 02:40:09.773]  It's all who can manipulate the best.
[02:40:09.793 --> 02:40:12.996]  It's all who can hold the most dart over other people's heads.
[02:40:15.558 --> 02:40:16.639]  And that's what they do.
[02:40:18.081 --> 02:40:19.482]  And they don't make cars.
[02:40:19.502 --> 02:40:20.823]  I mean, they own companies that do.
[02:40:21.183 --> 02:40:22.284]  They don't make computers.
[02:40:22.344 --> 02:40:22.645]  They don't...
[02:40:24.733 --> 02:40:26.074]  They own other people.
[02:40:26.514 --> 02:40:28.136]  What they do make is tyranny.
[02:40:28.176 --> 02:40:33.279]  What they are experts in, generationally, is control and manipulation and spin.
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:37.702]  They are the great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of snake oil salesmen.
[02:40:39.664 --> 02:40:42.986]  They are the great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of warrior kings.
[02:40:43.006 --> 02:40:46.589]  They are the great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of mafia dons.
[02:40:48.012 --> 02:40:53.095]  And they know what they're doing and they just call you a bunch of idiots and laugh at you and they're predators.
[02:40:53.195 --> 02:40:55.656]  A normal person couldn't do what they do if they had a conscience.
[02:40:56.036 --> 02:40:57.997]  They see conscience as a weakness.
[02:40:58.077 --> 02:41:00.258]  They see conscience as something bad.
[02:41:01.979 --> 02:41:04.721]  They see you and I as weak because we have soft hearts.
[02:41:06.421 --> 02:41:12.925]  They think it's their right to rule over us in a social Darwin type view because
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:17.862]  Well, that's survival of the fittest, and because we are these cattle, we deserve to be fed on.
[02:41:19.183 --> 02:41:21.705]  And that's the view that the elite Japanese had.
[02:41:22.565 --> 02:41:26.628]  That's the view that the elite Germans had when they were living in huts.
[02:41:27.268 --> 02:41:28.809]  That's the view that the Jews had.
[02:41:29.229 --> 02:41:33.692]  That's the view that the Comanche had against the other Native Americans.
[02:41:34.132 --> 02:41:40.696]  The dominant group over their region always says they're the best, and always says they have the right to enslave everybody.
[02:41:44.153 --> 02:41:45.894]  And I say these groups are cancers!
[02:41:47.175 --> 02:41:49.897]  These ruling elites were always cancers over their own group.
[02:41:51.098 --> 02:41:54.620]  That's the group that's always the most abused, and then they're cancers to everybody else.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:42:02.765]  And now, they've all linked up and teamed up to bring in this new world order, and they're going like gangbusters, folks!
[02:42:03.185 --> 02:42:13.572]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon, poisons in the water by design, we get the government documents where they're going to do it to us on purpose, you show people they're so dumb now that they don't even know how to read it,
[02:42:16.983 --> 02:42:17.923]  And so, listen.
[02:42:18.784 --> 02:42:19.324]  I've studied it.
[02:42:20.484 --> 02:42:22.705]  I cover what I can document, and I'm here to tell you.
[02:42:23.745 --> 02:42:28.726]  The elite aren't Jews, they aren't Catholics, they aren't Protestants, they aren't black, they aren't Chinese.
[02:42:29.627 --> 02:42:32.747]  They are Luciferians.
[02:42:34.048 --> 02:42:34.728]  It's true.
[02:42:35.188 --> 02:42:36.408]  The Bible's true.
[02:42:37.289 --> 02:42:42.410]  Every time I research it, I run smack dab at the end of the day into Satanism.
[02:42:44.811 --> 02:42:45.691]  That's what they are.
[02:42:46.610 --> 02:42:49.093]  That's what binds them in their commission meetings.
[02:42:49.674 --> 02:42:50.635]  That's what they're into.
[02:42:50.735 --> 02:42:57.283]  And look, even if you're an atheist, which I think is foolish, but let's look at things in a scientific way the way you would look at it.
[02:42:58.024 --> 02:43:06.234]  If you're a predator class that's into dehumanization and control and enjoys what they're doing, wouldn't you have a religion of do as thou wilt?
[02:43:06.883 --> 02:43:07.943]  That is the whole of the law?
[02:43:08.263 --> 02:43:12.404]  Wouldn't your religion be that of darkness and destruction?
[02:43:12.964 --> 02:43:14.304]  Look at the Aztecs' gods.
[02:43:14.544 --> 02:43:15.064]  Satanic.
[02:43:15.505 --> 02:43:16.845]  Look at the Babylonians' gods.
[02:43:16.985 --> 02:43:17.545]  Satanic.
[02:43:18.045 --> 02:43:19.285]  Look at the Egyptians' gods.
[02:43:19.465 --> 02:43:20.545]  Only way you can describe it.
[02:43:20.605 --> 02:43:21.166]  Satanic.
[02:43:21.546 --> 02:43:22.866]  Based on enslavement.
[02:43:23.266 --> 02:43:24.306]  The Nazis' gods.
[02:43:24.746 --> 02:43:25.786]  Skull and crossbones.
[02:43:25.926 --> 02:43:26.247]  Death.
[02:43:26.647 --> 02:43:27.307]  Blackness.
[02:43:27.367 --> 02:43:27.907]  Darkness.
[02:43:33.188 --> 02:43:34.368]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[02:43:35.988 --> 02:43:37.288]  And people fixate on this.
[02:43:37.348 --> 02:43:45.170]  They think when they call in, and I don't discourage it, do it if you want, and talk about the Jews, that that somehow wounds the evil Jews.
[02:43:45.270 --> 02:43:47.851]  And I put that in quotes, New York Times.
[02:43:47.871 --> 02:43:50.231]  You know, they're saying the Jews are evil.
[02:43:50.591 --> 02:43:52.712]  Or when they say the Catholics, that it wounds them.
[02:43:53.112 --> 02:43:53.812]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:43:54.752 --> 02:43:58.393]  We have Zionist documents where they wanted Jews to be persecuted.
[02:43:59.413 --> 02:44:02.354]  Because then that makes them run more into the Zionist camp.
[02:44:03.294 --> 02:44:04.434]  You're helping them, good job.
[02:44:05.595 --> 02:44:06.136]  Same thing.
[02:44:06.356 --> 02:44:14.202]  Black leaders want blacks to be dumbed down on these reservations, these plantations of inner cities, where they're more easily controlled.
[02:44:16.543 --> 02:44:17.324]  It's the same story.
[02:44:18.385 --> 02:44:19.125]  It's the same thing.
[02:44:20.146 --> 02:44:21.007]  Over and over again.
[02:44:21.567 --> 02:44:22.048]  Cops!
[02:44:22.808 --> 02:44:26.191]  They train the cops how to act like thugs, how to be mean to us, how to abuse us.
[02:44:26.491 --> 02:44:28.012]  Suddenly we stop liking the cops.
[02:44:28.312 --> 02:44:31.595]  I mean, used to cops couldn't fight off the coffee and an apple pie.
[02:44:32.222 --> 02:44:33.042]  Cops were nice.
[02:44:33.182 --> 02:44:34.003]  Cops were honored.
[02:44:34.263 --> 02:44:35.624]  Cops were respected.
[02:44:36.064 --> 02:44:37.705]  But they were trained how we're the enemy.
[02:44:37.785 --> 02:44:38.705]  Thin blue line.
[02:44:38.745 --> 02:44:39.586]  Be against the people.
[02:44:39.846 --> 02:44:41.506]  And now the people don't like the cops!
[02:44:43.728 --> 02:44:46.529]  And so, then the feds come and say, gee, they don't like you.
[02:44:46.729 --> 02:44:48.450]  You've got to even be more with us.
[02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:50.311]  And so they go to the feds.
[02:44:50.611 --> 02:44:52.712]  Okay, we'll get even more radical.
[02:44:52.772 --> 02:44:54.212]  Which then makes it even worse.
[02:44:56.834 --> 02:44:58.735]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:44:59.955 --> 02:45:01.376]  It's evil people.
[02:45:03.203 --> 02:45:13.506]  And so when you attack evil groups and then give them one of the labels they want you to give them, that helps them because then it gets the general public to support them.
[02:45:14.352 --> 02:45:29.983]  Because the general public goes, well, I'm Hispanic and I'm not bad, or I'm black and I'm not bad, or I'm Jewish and I'm not bad, or I'm a white Christian Protestant and I'm not bad, and I'm tired of the liberal media attacking me, and they go, oh, here's Rush Limbaugh, he's fighting for me.
[02:45:30.283 --> 02:45:33.485]  They even give you the phony alternative and you go run into that.
[02:45:34.686 --> 02:45:35.927]  And then it's the same thing.
[02:45:38.449 --> 02:45:39.930]  We've just got to get past all this.
[02:45:41.727 --> 02:45:43.390]  And, uh, people fixate on it.
[02:45:43.410 --> 02:45:44.973]  It feels very good to be tribal.
[02:45:45.914 --> 02:45:55.431]  Matt John LaRosa, you know, especially Matt just says, kill all the white people, run them out, and they're getting a lot of members, and you notice that the white bankers are funding them.
[02:45:56.796 --> 02:45:59.539]  And I can deprogram a MECHA member unless they're an evil controller.
[02:45:59.619 --> 02:46:01.560]  I just go, well, okay, here's your own funding.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:03.702]  Why are all these guys you say are bad funding you?
[02:46:04.082 --> 02:46:06.444]  No, you're working for them to break this country down, don't you?
[02:46:06.464 --> 02:46:07.845]  And they go, oh, oh, I see.
[02:46:07.865 --> 02:46:11.148]  I'm like, yes, because see, I go around the paradigm.
[02:46:11.488 --> 02:46:12.829]  I'm outside the box.
[02:46:17.813 --> 02:46:20.656]  So it feels really good to be in your own little good ol' boy clubs.
[02:46:21.542 --> 02:46:33.891]  Whether you're a Jewish group that doesn't like anybody but Jews, or whether you're a black group that doesn't like anybody but blacks, or you're an Anglo-Saxon WASP group that doesn't like anybody but whites, you're all controlled.
[02:46:33.951 --> 02:46:42.677]  You're bosses, bosses, bosses, all meet in a room that looks like the color of the rainbow, and they're not thinking about color, folks.
[02:46:42.697 --> 02:46:43.838]  They're thinking about blood.
[02:46:43.858 --> 02:46:45.219]  They're thinking about power.
[02:46:45.239 --> 02:46:46.660]  They're thinking about destruction.
[02:46:48.917 --> 02:46:49.597]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:46:50.137 --> 02:46:52.138]  Steve in Kansas City, what else do you have to say?
[02:46:54.359 --> 02:46:55.019]  Oh, Steve's gone.
[02:46:55.039 --> 02:46:55.619]  I told him to hold on.
[02:46:55.639 --> 02:46:56.419]  I wasn't letting him comment.
[02:46:56.919 --> 02:46:57.800]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:46:57.860 --> 02:46:58.580]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:46:59.740]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:00.280]  Hello.
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.482]  This is reminding me of what you said in the past where rat poison is what?
[02:47:05.642 --> 02:47:06.302]  98% grain.
[02:47:08.063 --> 02:47:08.223]  Right?
[02:47:08.263 --> 02:47:12.724]  And it's the 2% that's within the rat poison which is what kills off the good.
[02:47:13.404 --> 02:47:13.804]  That's it.
[02:47:14.885 --> 02:47:15.885]  And one thing that
[02:47:16.874 --> 02:47:25.717]  You have to look at it, as far as the big picture, America was the country that was attacked in 9-1-1, yet these controlled grid systems are going in worldwide.
[02:47:25.737 --> 02:47:30.758]  And it's the exact same companies and the exact same digital identifiers?
[02:47:30.818 --> 02:47:32.378]  It's world-wide, and it's admitted!
[02:47:32.718 --> 02:47:32.859]  Right.
[02:47:33.019 --> 02:47:41.361]  Another thing that's interesting, I know you were talking before about the Vatican, wasn't it the Pope who in the past would coronate the kings and the queens, to actually put the
[02:47:42.119 --> 02:47:47.180]  Yeah, until Martin Luther and they broke off with Henry VIII.
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:54.002]  Two more quick things, if you could shoot me your zip code and your suite address real quick, I missed that for the tapes.
[02:47:54.022 --> 02:47:58.103]  It's 3001... Got that, I just need a zip code and a suite number.
[02:47:58.123 --> 02:47:59.563]  Okay, 3001 South Lamar, suite 100.
[02:48:03.403 --> 02:48:04.684]  Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:48:06.365 --> 02:48:07.686]  78704, thank you.
[02:48:08.087 --> 02:48:16.673]  And one more thing, if you could talk quickly on a remedy and recourse as far as the UCC 1-207 and 1-203, and can that really help people?
[02:48:17.094 --> 02:48:18.755]  You know, all that stuff's real.
[02:48:18.795 --> 02:48:25.680]  The globalists put back doors in all their admiralty courts, but they don't accept it when you or I do it.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:26.641]  It's totally criminal.
[02:48:27.702 --> 02:48:29.643]  And we got a government that says they're above the law.
[02:48:29.663 --> 02:48:31.965]  I mean, it's just reached pure tyranny.
[02:48:34.486 --> 02:48:38.993]  So, really, it's all an information war now.
[02:48:40.496 --> 02:48:42.880]  It's about waking up as many people as quickly as possible.
[02:48:45.962 --> 02:48:52.825]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.125 --> 02:48:54.506]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.686 --> 02:48:56.907]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.047 --> 02:48:59.148]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.408 --> 02:49:04.350]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.690 --> 02:49:08.712]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:09.192 --> 02:49:10.734]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.814 --> 02:49:21.464]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.624 --> 02:49:23.526]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.726 --> 02:49:25.708]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[02:49:25.708 --> 02:49:26.088]  We're good.
[02:49:45.382 --> 02:49:50.604]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.744 --> 02:49:58.846]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.086 --> 02:50:06.148]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.328 --> 02:50:07.609]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:07.689 --> 02:50:13.594]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.774 --> 02:50:18.878]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.978 --> 02:50:27.866]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.126 --> 02:50:31.649]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:46.284 --> 02:51:49.006]  Alright, I gotta move quick here.
[02:51:49.026 --> 02:51:52.188]  Stephen, Kansas City is there.
[02:51:52.808 --> 02:51:54.870]  Stephen, did that answer your question earlier?
[02:51:54.890 --> 02:51:58.533]  I mean, yeah, you are exactly right, Mr. Jones.
[02:51:58.553 --> 02:52:00.054]  I mean, I care about everybody.
[02:52:00.074 --> 02:52:06.839]  I mean, I don't want to paint anybody as bad just because, you know, a few bad apples, I mean, that are out there.
[02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:11.943]  I just wanted to bring, you know, what I know.
[02:52:12.343 --> 02:52:14.245]  Because I have, you know, six-year tapes.
[02:52:14.966 --> 02:52:17.767]  Seven of your tapes, and I'll have the rest of them by the end of the year.
[02:52:18.087 --> 02:52:19.487]  Oh, I wasn't criticizing you!
[02:52:19.547 --> 02:52:21.948]  I said, call in, bring this up, we need to talk about it.
[02:52:22.348 --> 02:52:37.613]  Well, I mean, it's just, I mean, you know, people, I mean, as you say, when you start looking, when you start listening to your show, or, you know, the alternative media like this, you're going to find out things that, I mean, I just didn't buy your tapes, you know, with blind faith.
[02:52:38.013 --> 02:52:44.695]  I looked you up, I found out, and, I mean, you know, what you were saying was, you know, documented and true.
[02:52:45.450 --> 02:52:48.012]  So I bought your tapes, and I watched them.
[02:52:48.272 --> 02:52:50.113]  I documented that, and it's true.
[02:52:50.654 --> 02:52:56.258]  And then, you know, once you start building this big wheel, I mean, it starts rolling.
[02:52:56.658 --> 02:52:58.219]  I mean, I can't stop.
[02:52:58.779 --> 02:53:02.842]  I mean, I'm always looking for more.
[02:53:03.182 --> 02:53:05.984]  And I give it to people, and believe me, I've lost friends.
[02:53:07.125 --> 02:53:09.267]  And, I mean, people, they don't care.
[02:53:09.627 --> 02:53:10.808]  They want to live their lives.
[02:53:11.488 --> 02:53:12.309]  That's fine.
[02:53:12.909 --> 02:53:13.950]  But, I mean, I don't want to
[02:53:14.508 --> 02:53:17.889]  You know, disparage any race or group.
[02:53:19.570 --> 02:53:21.231]  My whole point wasn't even about you.
[02:53:21.371 --> 02:53:23.151]  I was saying... Well, no, I know it was.
[02:53:23.291 --> 02:53:32.875]  I was saying that everybody sees evil in everything because every major organization has been taken over by this global crime syndicate.
[02:53:32.895 --> 02:53:33.535]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:33.555 --> 02:53:36.176]  And I appreciate your support, Steve.
[02:53:36.216 --> 02:53:38.977]  Real fast, Chris in Kentucky and then Ed in Louisiana.
[02:53:39.777 --> 02:53:40.858]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:53:44.341 --> 02:53:48.143]  Alright, well I'll tell you what, since I got the call scrambled here at the end, I'm not going to take any more.
[02:53:48.803 --> 02:53:49.383]  I'm sorry.
[02:53:51.144 --> 02:53:52.365]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:52.385 --> 02:53:56.106]  They're up in Minnesota and sometimes it gets confused in between.
[02:53:56.447 --> 02:53:56.787]  You know what?
[02:53:57.147 --> 02:54:02.189]  I'm just not going to take any more calls because I want to hit on a couple of final little news articles right here at the end.
[02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:09.092]  Bush has signed a bill, talked about this in the first hour, that may let Schiavo live.
[02:54:09.993 --> 02:54:10.733]  That's good news.
[02:54:11.153 --> 02:54:12.494]  It goes to a federal judge now.
[02:54:14.694 --> 02:54:17.216]  And she's now been three days off of food and water.
[02:54:19.318 --> 02:54:29.205]  But it's just like, uh, when John Gotti, the mob boss, would buy pizza for everybody, you know, once a year on the block, and they'd say, oh, Mr. Gotti's so nice, he's so good for our neighborhood.
[02:54:30.266 --> 02:54:31.066]  It's the same thing.
[02:54:31.807 --> 02:54:36.670]  You know, Bush is forced by us to do this, and then we talk about how good he is.
[02:54:37.451 --> 02:54:41.274]  We need to be aware of what the caller mentioned, the rat poison situation.
[02:54:43.357 --> 02:54:48.462]  Russian intelligence chief says Al-Qaeda a myth on the pretext of fighting international terrorism.
[02:54:48.482 --> 02:54:52.085]  The United States is trying to establish control over the world's richest oil reserves.
[02:54:52.825 --> 02:55:08.099]  Leonid Shcherabashin, ex-chief of foreign intelligence services, who heads the Russian Naval Economic Security Service consulting company, said in an interview for a major newspaper in Moscow, using the anti-terrorist cause as a cover
[02:55:08.809 --> 02:55:18.358]  For the United States to occupy Afghanistan, Iraq, and will soon move to impose their democratic order on the greater Middle East.
[02:55:19.139 --> 02:55:21.221]  But Russia is all part of this too, again.
[02:55:22.402 --> 02:55:23.023]  Staged event.
[02:55:23.627 --> 02:55:27.688]  Bush administration protecting Bill Clinton, as usual, this side of the Associated Press.
[02:55:28.148 --> 02:55:42.451]  The Bush administration blacked out almost all the information and hundreds of documents before releasing them to conservative organization looking into President Clinton's controversial pardons four years ago on his last day in office of convicted cocaine dealers.
[02:55:43.331 --> 02:55:46.491]  And George Bush has done nothing but protect Bill Clinton since.
[02:55:47.091 --> 02:55:49.712]  Oh yeah, they're cocaine dealers together, he better protect them.
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:54.001]  Guantanamo abuse tapes as explosive as Abu Ghraib.
[02:55:54.021 --> 02:55:56.362]  This out of the London Guardian.
[02:55:56.382 --> 02:55:59.504]  And it shows torture and other things we can't mention.
[02:56:00.944 --> 02:56:05.746]  I would say far worse than what happened at Abu Ghraib.
[02:56:05.766 --> 02:56:08.308]  At least what we were shown from Abu Ghraib.
[02:56:09.508 --> 02:56:11.669]  Alright, back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:56:12.849 --> 02:56:15.110]  Back tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:56:17.933 --> 02:56:21.578]  And the new film, Marshall Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[02:56:22.339 --> 02:56:27.165]  Go to my website and order a hard copy or go to prisonplanet.tv and watch one online.
[02:56:28.127 --> 02:56:30.550]  Or you can give me a call.
[02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:31.211]  God bless.
[02:56:31.551 --> 02:56:31.892]  Take care.
