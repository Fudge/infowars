[00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:06.676]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:08.416]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:10.237]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.257 --> 00:00:11.677]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:13.318]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:17.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:26.522]  My friends, it is Monday, the 29th day of August, 2005.
[00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.638]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:39.019]  He hasn't joined us in a couple weeks.
[00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:44.623]  He'll be coming up at the halfway point in about an hour and a half.
[00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:50.186]  Paul Joseph Watson with his report from the Prison Planet.
[00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:53.668]  Why do we call the website PrisonPlanet.com?
[00:00:53.708 --> 00:01:02.534]  Because the globalists, the architects, the control freaks, the overlords, the parasite masters are creating a prison planet.
[00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.003]  Well, playing us off against each other.
[00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:07.583]  Republican versus Democrat.
[00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.525]  Muslim versus Christian.
[00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.305]  North against South.
[00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.887]  It's just the same old story of divide and conquer.
[00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.487]  We're here exposing that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:23.268]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:26.189]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.810]  We'll also have wide open phones today.
[00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:32.733]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:32.853]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:34.814]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.496]  The websites aren't just PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:40.318]  There's also PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net, and Infowars.com.
[00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:40.378]  U.S.
[00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:41.198]  oil surges
[00:01:54.146 --> 00:02:07.034]  $4 to record price above $70 a barrel because of the hurricane that has missed New Orleans predominantly.
[00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:12.878]  There is some flooding going on, but no deaths, thank God, being reported.
[00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.121]  There would have been a direct hit on the city.
[00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.644]  We're looking at total flooding and millions of dollars of damage, but
[00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:41.037]  Just like the bullet they dodged last year, this Category 5 hurricane slowed down to Category 4 as it went on land, and the main force of the storm, the 145 mph wind, missed most of the city of New Orleans down there in Tin City Central.
[00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:45.640]  And I do have some comments about the hurricane.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.941]  Lord Bush
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.982]  Cut the funding, the federal funding, which there shouldn't even be federal funding to begin with.
[00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:56.003]  The government's going to be doling money out.
[00:02:56.884 --> 00:03:10.229]  They cut the federal funding at record levels for trying to repair and strengthen the levees around the city, which is several feet below sea level and sinking about three or four inches a year.
[00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.650]  The city is sinking.
[00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:26.279]  And the Houston Chronicle reported last year, and we've pulled this article out, that thousands could die if there's ever a direct hit on New Orleans by a hurricane.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:37.626]  So more people could die by a direct hit by a hurricane than on 9-11, but is the government spending just a few paltry $100 million to protect that city, which they could do 100%?
[00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:40.463]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:42.704]  But the government says give up all your freedoms.
[00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:44.825]  A terrorist might blow up a bus.
[00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:54.389]  We've got to destroy 230 years of American freedom and be the greatest police state the world's ever seen because the evil Al-Qaedas might get us.
[00:03:54.869 --> 00:04:00.552]  Of course, those Al-Qaedas, the Al-Qaedis, or Al-Ci-8-Is or Al-Mi-6-Is.
[00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:04.053]  As we have exhaustively dominated.
[00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:04.894]  The U.S.
[00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:06.794]  should have more quarantine stations.
[00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:07.735]  They're tripling the number.
[00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:19.088]  Uh, this is due to the fact of the, of the, of the bird flu, and the swine flu, and Britain's elite get pills to survive the bird flu!
[00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:21.528]  This out of the Times of London today!
[00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:32.251]  Don't worry, I'm sure that some of the, uh, patriots for profit out there will, will have a magical cream for you that will, that will heal you of this, or perhaps a magic pyramid, but
[00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:34.812]  Believe me, it's a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:39.273]  You need to get good nutrition and pray to God to protect you from such things.
[00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.854]  But frankly, I don't think that the bird flu is that big of a threat.
[00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:47.355]  I think it's a hype threat being pushed by the CFR.
[00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:48.215]  We'll talk about that.
[00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:54.516]  Also, the head of the Federal Reserve is out fear-mongering as well.
[00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:57.997]  And I am concerned about what Alan Greenspan is saying.
[00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:00.018]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.633]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.893 --> 00:05:07.475]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:12.478]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.544]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:21.886]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:24.929]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.673]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:34.297]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:41.744]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:44.426]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:04.515]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:07.639]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:12.044]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.326]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:18.213]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:20.794]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:35.984]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:43.088]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:36.412]  I think so.
[00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:06.846]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:08.588]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:10.410]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:11.892]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.612 --> 00:08:13.493]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:18.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:22.443]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:27.170]  We're now into the second segment.
[00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.054]  8 minutes, 30 seconds into this hour.
[00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:36.723]  Paul Watson with his weekly report will be joining us in the middle of the next hour at the waypoint in this broadcast.
[00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:40.868]  It is the 29th day of August 2005.
[00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.652]  Coming up, we'll give you the latest on the Hurricane.
[00:08:45.732 --> 00:08:47.273]  Now down to a category 4.
[00:08:47.873 --> 00:08:52.717]  And not as deadly as some in the mainstream media were predicting, thank God.
[00:08:52.737 --> 00:08:59.462]  It turned away a little bit from a dead-on attack on New Orleans.
[00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:04.566]  But still is causing quite a few problems.
[00:09:04.606 --> 00:09:06.888]  But they have, it seems, dodged that bullet.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:15.963]  We also have oil prices exploding to over, old time record, breaking the previous records the last month of over $70 a barrel.
[00:09:17.864 --> 00:09:31.148]  And we have new revelations coming out just across the board on government corruption, bid rigging, what's happening in Iraq, endless police state measures across the United States, a lot of really important news coming up today.
[00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:33.369]  But for those that are joining us for the first time,
[00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:38.777]  This broadcast is not about being left-wing or right-wing.
[00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:47.501]  Those are false political terms that didn't exist in our political lexicon until about 110 years ago.
[00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:54.004]  The big robber barons bought off with endowments the major universities and the political professors.
[00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:58.046]  And they introduced new terms that mean absolutely nothing.
[00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:03.509]  Left-wing before that was associated with the feminine.
[00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:09.325]  Or with the fallen nature of man through Eve, or the sinister.
[00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:14.570]  Sinister, I guess in Latin just means left, or left-handed.
[00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:21.996]  And thus became one and the same with evil motives or activities.
[00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:27.921]  So before 110 years ago, left-wing and right-wing didn't exist.
[00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.985]  Now, you have to ask yourself, what did exist before that?
[00:10:33.752 --> 00:10:38.357]  This is how they steal your past from you so you don't know your present or your future.
[00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:42.441]  They take the charts away from you as if you were a mariner.
[00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:44.983]  They take the maps away from you.
[00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:48.887]  And they give you bad charts so you run aground.
[00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:52.110]  And they rename running aground.
[00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.092]  Running aground is good.
[00:10:54.844 --> 00:10:57.245]  So when you run aground, you think that that's good.
[00:10:57.285 --> 00:11:06.527]  As your society dies and falls apart, the new false chart, the new false rules of the game tell you that it's wonderful!
[00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:18.791]  That enslavement and sickness and death and idiocy and gibbering, frozen continual adolescence is good, when it's not.
[00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.011]  Man, I tell you, I took off the last week.
[00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:31.155]  Did some work for part of the week and went and visited family and then went to the beach for a couple days and spent a little bit of time.
[00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:33.016]  I mean, I haven't had a vacation in years.
[00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:40.120]  I've taken off a day or two, maybe once a year, but I just haven't spent any time with my family in a long time, so I took off the last week.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.702]  I want to thank Jack Blood and Erskine for filming in one of the days and we ran rebroadcast of the others.
[00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:48.024]  But, you know, in the summer, people are starting school.
[00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:51.606]  It is the ultimate doldrums of talk radio, last week is.
[00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:53.768]  And so we took off.
[00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:58.210]  But a lot has happened and there's a lot I want to talk about.
[00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:07.596]  And it feels really weird to have not been on the air for a week and not done the average 20 or so interviews I would have done last week on top of it.
[00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:10.777]  So I'm kind of getting back into my stride right now.
[00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:18.682]  And I guess it kind of is like jumping back on a bike, but I'm a little bit more scatterbrained than normal because
[00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.106]  than I normally am because I've just got so much I want to talk about.
[00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:28.168]  But bottom line, folks, you've been given false terms, okay?
[00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:33.549]  Before there was this left and right false system, it was issue-driven.
[00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.790]  More liberty or less liberty?
[00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.411]  Is this guy a tyrant or is he for freedom?
[00:12:40.412 --> 00:12:42.292]  And that's what the campaigns were all about.
[00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.933]  They were about individual rights, local autonomy,
[00:12:46.062 --> 00:13:02.257]  The issues were about the government's servants serving the people and groveling properly to us, stepping and fetching it basically, and now it's about licking the boots of government and being little fat domesticated idiots.
[00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:18.736]  And look, I know that the average person wants to think everything's fine with the world and wants to trust their government and think that it's like their mommy or their daddy and they're there to take care of them and so everything's fine and none of us have any responsibilities.
[00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:23.440]  But that's just not the reality.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:29.465]  Just because you're in denial about that doesn't mean the threat isn't there and isn't growing.
[00:13:31.688 --> 00:13:35.470]  And, you know, I never really have time anymore to read for enjoyment.
[00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:38.992]  Literally, I just don't.
[00:13:39.012 --> 00:13:45.215]  I mean, I enjoy working, I enjoy fighting the New World Order, so that, I guess, is my rest and relaxation.
[00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:47.197]  It's just more work.
[00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:59.463]  But taking off the last seven days, fully, you know, seven days, taking off those days, I had time to read David McCullough's 1776,
[00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:13.466]  I had time to listen to a book on tape of an older British history of the Revolutionary War.
[00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:28.457]  I didn't plan my vacation that way, to spend time reading the Federalist Papers and reading some of the letters of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, but that's what I basically did.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.961]  Staying up late at night several times just, you know, reading.
[00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:38.903]  And I have to admit, I mean, my eyes many times got filled with tears.
[00:14:39.983 --> 00:14:53.127]  I mean, when you think about people who literally, and this is even the British histories, didn't have shoes because they weren't supplied and the old shoes would break pretty quickly, would fall apart very quickly.
[00:14:53.147 --> 00:14:58.069]  And when you read about people, just a thousand or so people,
[00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:18.602]  Rebels, as they were called, in the Continental Army, at that time, in early 1776, they weren't even called the Continental Army, the Provincial Army, climbing the cliffs of Ticonderoga.
[00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:21.543]  You know, why do we have warships named Ticonderoga?
[00:15:21.883 --> 00:15:27.924]  I bet you a million bucks that most of the people on board the Ticonderoga, or at Fort Ticonderoga, don't even know why it's named that.
[00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:30.855]  That's how dumbed down we've gotten.
[00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.618]  We don't know why things are named things, or why D.C.
[00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:35.540]  is named Washington, D.C.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:54.757]  But anyways, they go up there and they get these giant cannons, some of them 24-pounders, that weigh tons and tons, and they dragged them without shoes, and British spies who saw them saw people walking with a trail of blood with their feet, with just blood dripping out of their feet, dragging the giant cannons.
[00:15:57.427 --> 00:16:11.376]  And, you know, 3,000 of Washington's forces fighting 20,000, you know, 10,000 Hessians and 10,000 British with the latest weapons, and losing over and over again, just slaughtering our troops over and over again.
[00:16:11.896 --> 00:16:16.979]  But always, we killed more of them than they killed of us, or in almost every case.
[00:16:17.854 --> 00:16:20.197]  And just letting them overcome us.
[00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:28.905]  Just basically bashing ourselves, the Americans, up against them over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:16:31.108 --> 00:16:37.334]  I mean, battles where our troops would only have one shot to fire because that's all the powder they had.
[00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:39.943]  Just unbelievable.
[00:16:40.183 --> 00:17:06.549]  And the spies and the backstabbing secret Tories running around spreading lies about General Washington and General Green and General Israel Putman and just all of them, the same scum today, running around spreading their lies and attacking patriots and doing what they do.
[00:17:08.874 --> 00:17:11.675]  But I just thought about how weak we are today.
[00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:34.681]  I mean, just words cannot describe how a lot of the Revolutionary Army, against the British fist, that had never been defeated by the way, I mean just 400 ships landing, disgorging 40,000 troops,
[00:17:36.912 --> 00:18:04.593]  and uh... you know four thousand troops facing them uh... on uh... in brooklyn i mean it's just it's just incredible bunker hill just all of it and I wrote a bunch of notes stuff I wanted to talk about and of course I didn't bring them into the studio and and you know my humble brain just cannot describe the eloquence and the intelligence and the
[00:18:04.957 --> 00:18:10.702]  The courage and the honor and just, I mean, folks, I read a history that was anti-American.
[00:18:11.663 --> 00:18:21.071]  I like to read both sides and it was talking about the incredible fortitude of the American forces.
[00:18:22.373 --> 00:18:30.260]  And then to just look at us today, slovenly, stupid people who don't even know where their state capitals are.
[00:18:30.794 --> 00:18:36.459]  Who don't have any idea about where, you know, major land masses or continents are?
[00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:41.804]  Who don't know about the three branches of government that don't know what the Fourth Amendment is?
[00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:42.905]  Or the Tenth?
[00:18:43.025 --> 00:18:43.726]  Or the Ninth?
[00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:44.527]  Or the Seventh?
[00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.489]  Who don't have any inkling of anything?
[00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.472]  Just mindless idiots!
[00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:52.114]  And I'm talking about the Democrats.
[00:18:52.154 --> 00:18:53.475]  I'm talking about the Republicans.
[00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:56.657]  We have just been domesticated!
[00:18:56.717 --> 00:19:01.732]  We are the children of the children of the children of the children of spoiled brats!
[00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:20.614]  We talk about the World War II generation being the greatest generation, and yeah, they were more moral and more informed and more intelligent and more brave, in many cases, than we are today, but compared to people in 1776, I'm telling you folks, the greatest generation, I'm sorry if you don't want to hear it, is not the World War II generation.
[00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:21.895]  It's the generation of 1776.
[00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:22.455]  And that 12-year war, or 1798,
[00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:35.212]  Longer than that.
[00:19:35.232 --> 00:19:35.212]  88.
[00:19:38.914 --> 00:19:40.995]  It just makes my head spin.
[00:19:44.097 --> 00:19:45.458]  It just makes my head spin.
[00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:53.523]  Oh, and to read what globalists in Europe were saying about how they would lose their empire of control over their slaves.
[00:19:54.364 --> 00:19:56.545]  And we have this bad example in America.
[00:19:57.006 --> 00:19:58.867]  We're fighting the same people today.
[00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:05.486]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:06.066]  Why?
[00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:09.026]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:21:04.275 --> 00:21:08.756]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:09.116 --> 00:21:13.198]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:13.498 --> 00:21:14.038]  We listened.
[00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:19.339]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:20.100]  We listened.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.521]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:24.481]  We listened.
[00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:28.302]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:21:28.342 --> 00:21:28.902]  We're good to go.
[00:21:54.844 --> 00:21:55.828]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:55.848 --> 00:21:57.474]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:02.845 --> 00:22:09.068]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:09.508 --> 00:22:17.291]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:25.515]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:25.795 --> 00:22:30.557]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:30.877 --> 00:22:35.600]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:39.963]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:41.484]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:04.840]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.462]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:23:08.582 --> 00:23:08.982]  Shocking?
[00:23:09.062 --> 00:23:09.502]  Of course!
[00:23:09.802 --> 00:23:11.863]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:14.904]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:23:15.104 --> 00:23:16.465]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:17.545]  All right, I'm going to get into Greenspan saying the economy may explode and I need to cover what's happening with oil prices and all of it.
[00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:24.579]  I just want to do justice to our founding fathers and the women and the families that supported them.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.602]  And I'm not saying all Americans are evil or stupid or bad.
[00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:49.035]  It's just that when you've had plenty this long, when you've had the types of blessings that liberty gives you, to then have no inkling of where it all came from, and no idea, the shoulders, the type of shoulders that we stand upon, it makes me sick.
[00:24:49.935 --> 00:25:15.615]  I mean, when I read about, say, a colonel in the glorious Revolutionary Army in this nation's history, you know, where the colonel's two-year-old son dies, and he gets the letter on the eve of a battle, and then how he has to suck it up and go and fight the enemy, you know, his little baby dying of a fever, and he wasn't there to take care of them,
[00:25:17.303 --> 00:25:28.090]  You know, just the stories of families losing all three of their sons, and how the British would torture American citizens, and how they would rape whole cities' women.
[00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:30.172]  I mean, this is in the British history.
[00:25:30.392 --> 00:25:36.115]  And the British generals writing letters about, ah, our boys are hungry for their blood.
[00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:39.377]  They raped their women and killed their children.
[00:25:39.478 --> 00:25:40.578]  Ha ha ha!
[00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:42.640]  It's so good!
[00:25:44.761 --> 00:25:46.242]  And the Hessians really love it.
[00:25:47.387 --> 00:26:02.318]  We caught a twelve-year-old revolutionary in the front lines and we shot and he was begging for his mommy as the Hessians bayoneted him slowly in the guts until he died and we stuck the little bugger's head up on a pole!
[00:26:02.338 --> 00:26:02.378]  Ha!
[00:26:02.718 --> 00:26:02.898]  Ha!
[00:26:03.058 --> 00:26:03.939]  Ha!
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:06.781]  And you know what?
[00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:14.106]  It was about three to four percent started the war because of other British abuses, arrogant abuses.
[00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:24.789]  And it was about 5% by the end of 1776 that were fighting, that were standing up, that were off the fence, who weren't either Tory or neutral.
[00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:42.479]  And the more raping and killing and abuse and the more raiding of houses and the more SWAT team behavior that the Redcoats and the Germans engaged in, the more resistance they got.
[00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:46.427]  And then the war went on for what, over ten years?
[00:26:48.728 --> 00:26:49.729]  Well over ten years.
[00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:51.129]  I mean, you think about that.
[00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.172]  On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[00:26:56.633 --> 00:27:01.356]  And in almost every case, our army was outmatched five to one.
[00:27:01.696 --> 00:27:03.297]  In some cases, ten to one.
[00:27:03.537 --> 00:27:08.920]  The British landed 30,000 troops at New York and already had over 10,000 there.
[00:27:11.222 --> 00:27:12.923]  And yes, they did dislodge
[00:27:13.624 --> 00:27:21.569]  The rebels from the island, from the peninsula, and from the islands in the area.
[00:27:24.171 --> 00:27:26.173]  But again, it isn't even winning every battle.
[00:27:26.373 --> 00:27:39.882]  It is just constantly showing up and fighting and standing up in the face of overwhelming odds, knowing you're right, knowing God's on your side, and taking action and having courage.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.083]  And we can do the same thing in the information war today.
[00:27:45.384 --> 00:27:49.808]  So many people on their side are waking up and joining our ranks.
[00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:56.994]  We have the most fertile ground we've ever had to educate people about the types of tyranny we're living under.
[00:28:00.377 --> 00:28:06.362]  Look, I love this country, and I'm just so sick at the deception I see the American people laboring under.
[00:28:07.754 --> 00:28:10.875]  Those years that I exposed the New World Order and Bill Clinton.
[00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:17.498]  The years that I exposed how the Democratic Party was controlled and totally rotten.
[00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:30.564]  And the poor Democrats associated their personal identities with the Democratic Party and Bill Clinton and thought that it was like a football game or some type of gladiatorial mock combat.
[00:28:31.244 --> 00:28:34.606]  And they didn't care what the facts showed.
[00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:37.107]  They would just jeer you mindlessly.
[00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:58.574]  Well, then I look at Republicans today, they're even more mindless and Kool-Aid drinker cult-like in their following of George Bush, who himself is just a front man and a puppet, expanding every Bill Clinton program massively while putting out some conservative rhetoric.
[00:28:59.535 --> 00:29:07.181]  I mean, it's like robbers who come to your house and knock on the door and say that it's a, you know, FedEx delivery.
[00:29:08.934 --> 00:29:21.001]  And then you say, well they said it was a FedEx delivery, so I didn't look out the keyhole, or the eyepiece, the peephole, even though FedEx doesn't deliver at 8 o'clock at night.
[00:29:22.401 --> 00:29:25.703]  So I just went ahead and opened the door, and why they rushed in on me.
[00:29:27.124 --> 00:29:28.044]  There's the analogy.
[00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:30.366]  I mean, the government tells you it loves you.
[00:29:30.826 --> 00:29:32.647]  The government tells you it's conservative.
[00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:35.364]  It's a lie!
[00:29:35.404 --> 00:29:36.365]  It's a ruse!
[00:29:36.465 --> 00:29:37.266]  It's a scam!
[00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:46.694]  You got big, powerful financial interests that want to control our lives to an even greater extent who've bought and paid for both parties!
[00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:50.418]  Just wait till we get back and I get into Alan Greenspan.
[00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:51.219]  I'll get right into it.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.361]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.821 --> 00:29:55.442]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.343 --> 00:29:59.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:11.121]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.742]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:30:14.002 --> 00:30:15.943]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:30:16.304 --> 00:30:21.646]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:30:22.046 --> 00:30:26.331]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:29.294]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:34.680]  With its 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:42.008]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.

[00:31:02.515 --> 00:31:06.079]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:06.640]  are located?
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.224]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.444 --> 00:31:15.149]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:20.435]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.735 --> 00:31:21.036]  I think so.
[00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:39.838]  I think so.
[00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:08.899]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:14.141]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:22.362]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.522 --> 00:32:29.564]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.784 --> 00:32:31.005]  There are no side effects.

[00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:17.740]  Alright, let's just plunge into the news.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.222]  I've mentioned some of it, but I'm busy pontificating.
[00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:27.486]  I'm busy pontificating about, well, our founding fathers.
[00:33:28.927 --> 00:33:31.548]  Because I don't believe in the Republican or Democratic parties.
[00:33:31.628 --> 00:33:32.909]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.711]  I believe in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:43.281]  For being secure in your person's papers and facts against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:55.930]  I believe in the First Amendment for the freedom of religion and to practice it and to have no government laws whatsoever concerning religion or your free speech or your right to peaceably assemble for redress of grievances.
[00:33:57.311 --> 00:34:02.075]  And I'm sorry folks, I don't care what party it is, that's all being erased and
[00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:18.143]  I do want to just say this, I am humbled, I am amazed, I am thankful, I am blessed that we're gaining so many new radio stations, so many new affiliates right now.
[00:34:18.163 --> 00:34:31.746]  I mean every week, big stations, mom and pop stations, they're all big stations, but really big stations in huge cities, small towns, you name it, are coming online picking up this broadcast.
[00:34:32.794 --> 00:34:49.509]  Because so many of these stations have had me on as a guest, or they've heard me on other stations, or they've heard me on as a guest on other radio stations, and they couldn't believe what I was talking about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, and now everything I've talked about is mainstream news!
[00:34:50.369 --> 00:34:57.215]  We give you the evidence day one that the Beslan Massacre was a Russian operation, comes out mainstream news in Europe, that it is!
[00:34:57.876 --> 00:35:00.218]  We tell you that MI6 is behind the London bombings,
[00:35:01.138 --> 00:35:08.722]  A month later it comes out in the BBC and everything that, oh yeah, the head bomber is MI6 and they're protecting him.
[00:35:09.702 --> 00:35:14.385]  I mean, we come out and we talk about Al-Qaeda being CIA and now that's public knowledge.
[00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:17.666]  I mean, I wish the things I talked about weren't true.
[00:35:19.167 --> 00:35:20.988]  I wish that it wasn't the case.
[00:35:21.768 --> 00:35:23.990]  I wish that we weren't losing our freedoms.
[00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.831]  I wish that a police state wasn't being set up.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:35.318]  Believe me, I wish that it was just rogue Muslims out planning to bomb and release chemical and biologicals.
[00:35:35.358 --> 00:35:40.601]  That would be a much lesser threat than our trillion, multi-trillion dollar government.
[00:35:41.622 --> 00:35:44.004]  Which, most of the government is good people.
[00:35:44.965 --> 00:35:46.346]  Just regular 9-to-5 Joes.
[00:35:46.386 --> 00:35:50.449]  You know, Sally Sockerman and Joe Sixpack.
[00:35:52.293 --> 00:35:58.778]  But, at the same time, there are criminal elements in control of the main levers of power.
[00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:15.131]  And many of these well-meaning people actually believe they're taking part in good tasks that help the nation, whereas in reality, you put the big system together, all the different pieces together of the puzzle, and it's a nightmare situation!
[00:36:15.872 --> 00:36:17.993]  I'll tell this story, and then I will get to the news.
[00:36:19.434 --> 00:36:20.435]  Why am I so angry?
[00:36:20.515 --> 00:36:21.356]  Why am I so mad?
[00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:23.664]  Why do I get frustrated?
[00:36:23.724 --> 00:36:25.185]  Because there's no way to cover it all.
[00:36:26.866 --> 00:36:30.128]  I'm driving back yesterday from the Texas coast.
[00:36:32.169 --> 00:36:41.335]  Every time, once a year I go down there for a few days and there's always a hurricane forms and comes, but luckily it was coming our direction after our little vacation was over.
[00:36:41.995 --> 00:36:49.980]  Again, I haven't had a big vacation in five years, so I apologize for taking five days off, but it's been five years since I did that and I did it.
[00:36:50.845 --> 00:36:52.706]  In fact, I just said five years.
[00:36:52.866 --> 00:36:55.207]  I've never taken a week off.
[00:36:56.107 --> 00:36:58.148]  I have never taken a week off, but I did do it.
[00:36:58.588 --> 00:36:59.189]  Side issue!
[00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:04.351]  They re-air Rush Limbaugh here locally in Austin.
[00:37:06.512 --> 00:37:10.654]  Now remember folks, back in college I was listening to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:37:10.814 --> 00:37:13.075]  I mean, I used to love Rush Limbaugh.
[00:37:14.055 --> 00:37:15.796]  I mean, I bought his books.
[00:37:16.376 --> 00:37:18.477]  I even wore a Rush Limbaugh t-shirt.
[00:37:19.162 --> 00:37:21.484]  I bought my father the Limbaugh letter.
[00:37:22.664 --> 00:37:24.245]  We're talking, you know, 12 years ago.
[00:37:24.906 --> 00:37:25.366]  Or longer.
[00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:30.510]  But then my uncle said, you know, he's not a real conservative son.
[00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.893]  And this is like... My uncle told me that about 15 years ago.
[00:37:36.414 --> 00:37:44.699]  And I rolled my eyes at him and argued with him and then he started explaining to me how the Republicans were controlled.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.641]  And this is back when George Bush was president.
[00:37:47.981 --> 00:37:48.882]  The first George Bush.
[00:37:49.557 --> 00:37:50.358]  Bush 41.
[00:37:52.219 --> 00:38:06.128]  And I still disagreed with him, but those seeds, five years later, when I myself had gotten into talk radio, began to grow, and I began to see.
[00:38:06.948 --> 00:38:14.073]  And let me tell you, if the Rush Limbaugh 15 years ago was bad, and a wolf in sheep's clothing, he's really bad today.
[00:38:15.054 --> 00:38:18.156]  So I'm driving back from Galveston, Texas,
[00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:22.589]  Listening to three hours of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:28.835]  I mean, I listened to him from the time I left Galveston until the time I got back to Austin, Texas.
[00:38:31.318 --> 00:38:34.662]  And it was lie after lie after lie.
[00:38:34.762 --> 00:38:38.626]  I mean, folks, it wasn't just twisting or spinning.
[00:38:39.978 --> 00:38:45.400]  He's never been this bad, and he sounded inebriated.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.360]  I will tell you that.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.261]  He sounded real weird.
[00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:52.742]  He sounded real arrogant, real assured, euphoric.
[00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:56.403]  He was gibbering at times.
[00:38:59.767 --> 00:39:09.511]  You can say what you want about the statement I just made, but he sounded like the Limbaugh two years ago who was hopped up on enough Oxycontin to kill five horses.
[00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:11.552]  By the way, that's been in the news.
[00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:20.756]  Major medical doctors have said 100 Oxycontin of the strength he was taking would kill five regular-sized, average-sized horses.
[00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:25.978]  But Limbaugh says put anybody in prison, I've heard him folks, who smokes marijuana,
[00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:33.380]  And have automatic federal sentences for, you know, 25 years for an 18-year-old the first time they're caught with cocaine.
[00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:38.562]  But, see, that makes me really sick.
[00:39:39.663 --> 00:39:42.864]  I'm not going to sit here and cover old ground about Limbaugh.
[00:39:44.525 --> 00:39:55.010]  But I heard him say that, well, it just came out that three weeks ago in Seattle, peace activists, who want to know about this anti-war movement, how peaceful they are,
[00:39:55.876 --> 00:40:00.120]  Two peace activists, with a crowd, beat two troops!
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:00.860]  Beat them!
[00:40:01.621 --> 00:40:03.042]  Beat them at a restaurant!
[00:40:03.483 --> 00:40:08.607]  Beat them almost, and I bet a lot of you heard this Friday, they were here on Friday Show Sunday, on KLBJ 590.
[00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:14.973]  So I'm listening to this, and they beat them!
[00:40:15.053 --> 00:40:15.773]  They beat them!
[00:40:17.955 --> 00:40:20.798]  And they broke their jaws, and this is what peace activists do.
[00:40:21.764 --> 00:40:23.505]  And I didn't hear him give a news report.
[00:40:23.525 --> 00:40:24.746]  I didn't hear him give a source.
[00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:26.608]  He wasn't giving any sources.
[00:40:26.868 --> 00:40:31.292]  He'd cover like ten articles in an hour and maybe give one source.
[00:40:32.373 --> 00:40:33.493]  He wasn't giving a source.
[00:40:33.513 --> 00:40:37.256]  And I thought, this is really weird, as he normally does, and then just twist it.
[00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:42.521]  And so I'm listening to this, and again folks, this isn't about bashing Rush Limbaugh.
[00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:43.541]  Okay?
[00:40:44.342 --> 00:40:47.485]  It's just, this is an example of total deception.
[00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:49.066]  Total lies.
[00:40:50.603 --> 00:40:59.345]  And I went, wait a minute, I remember a month ago, three or four weeks ago, hearing about that, and it was just a brawl at a club.
[00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:03.366]  And soldiers get in fights all the time.
[00:41:04.827 --> 00:41:07.688]  And I thought, this is really, really weird.
[00:41:07.788 --> 00:41:12.809]  You know, I'm in a reserve judgment, but peace activists normally are what
[00:41:13.576 --> 00:41:16.119]  Neil Borch calls them, they are the bed-wetting type.
[00:41:16.179 --> 00:41:23.346]  I mean, you know, the classic liberal is a groveling, simpering, pencil-necked, limp-wristed, bug-eyed weakling.
[00:41:25.308 --> 00:41:27.590]  Okay, I'm sorry, I just had to say it.
[00:41:28.551 --> 00:41:31.194]  And it just didn't fit the M.O.
[00:41:32.435 --> 00:41:33.336]  The modus operandi.
[00:41:34.429 --> 00:41:37.190]  And he sounded like he was just out of his gourd.
[00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.231]  I mean, really, you could tell.
[00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:43.732]  It's like when somebody calls you up on the phone and you're like, have you been drinking or are you on something?
[00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:45.693]  Limbaugh sounded just nuts.
[00:41:47.313 --> 00:41:57.877]  And so I get home last night and I sit down and I go watch the video and I go read the articles and these
[00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:13.802]  We're believed to be two gang member types with some other gang members at a predominantly black gangbanger bar and a black soldier and a white soldier go in there and some people hit on their girlfriends and pat on them and stuff.
[00:42:13.822 --> 00:42:15.704]  Folks, that's what goes on at these hip hop bars.
[00:42:16.004 --> 00:42:17.205]  Black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:42:17.225 --> 00:42:24.192]  It's a bunch of gyrating, bumping, basically we're being reduced to the level of animals here in America.
[00:42:24.855 --> 00:42:27.817]  I see fourteen-year-old girls on the street corner dancing like this.
[00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:33.842]  When I was down at the beach, I saw kids acting like, you know, middle-class children acting like demons.
[00:42:34.743 --> 00:42:37.905]  It was like Sodom and Gomorrah or something.
[00:42:38.866 --> 00:42:43.530]  So that's what's going on in these clubs and these bars and stuff.
[00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.031]  And so there's a fight!
[00:42:47.853 --> 00:42:52.397]  And a group of individuals, black and white, attack
[00:42:53.283 --> 00:42:56.425]  These two soldiers, and beat them up really bad.
[00:42:58.225 --> 00:43:17.695]  By the time it gets on the EIB network, by the time it's on there, it is... evil liberals are assaulting... I mean, he actually said, this peace activist, word for word, peace activist attacked and broke the jaws of two troops.
[00:43:18.357 --> 00:43:24.080]  And I thought, yeah, yeah, toe-to-toe, you know, two soldiers got beat up by two peace activists.
[00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:28.743]  And sure enough, it was a total lie!
[00:43:29.163 --> 00:43:43.591]  No one has said that, no one has pushed that, no one had ever said, it's totally false, and the police didn't release the Seattle footage because it hurt terrorism
[00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:52.265]  What, five, six years ago, when a big group of blacks attacked a group of whites, and were beating them up and robbing them, it was a racial attack.
[00:43:53.286 --> 00:44:03.430]  And because one of these people is white, and there were some blacks there, that's what we're now getting out of the Seattle Police Department, is this is a political correct thing.
[00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:10.773]  No, no, Limbaugh said because they're liberal, and because it was troops being beat up, they didn't release the footage.
[00:44:15.948 --> 00:44:19.355]  So, there really is no end to it.
[00:44:20.577 --> 00:44:22.180]  There really is no end to it.
[00:44:23.983 --> 00:44:27.530]  And we have the audio from it, so let's just go ahead and play it.
[00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:27.930]  Here it is.
[00:44:28.687 --> 00:44:29.948]  It is a brutal attack.
[00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:36.535]  Three men, at least two of them Iraq War veterans, viciously beaten while dozens of others stood by and watched.
[00:44:37.075 --> 00:44:40.759]  This attack happened about 2.30 in the morning on Sunday, July 31st.
[00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:46.224]  Police tell us the soldiers were waiting in line here outside Larry's Nightclub on First Avenue South.
[00:44:46.864 --> 00:44:49.906]  One of the alleged assailants groped one soldier's wife.
[00:44:50.427 --> 00:44:53.288]  Words were exchanged and the soldiers turned to leave.
[00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:58.452]  One of the individuals involved in the disagreement possibly threw a hot dog at one of the suspects.
[00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:01.714]  Apparently it hit the suspect in the face with a hot dog.
[00:45:03.161 --> 00:45:04.942]  This apparently enraged the suspects.
[00:45:05.082 --> 00:45:09.184]  The suspects allegedly followed the soldiers to First and Yesler and beat the men.
[00:45:09.604 --> 00:45:11.605]  Police are looking for three black men.
[00:45:11.946 --> 00:45:15.768]  Suspect 1 is described 5 foot 11, 185 pounds.
[00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:19.129]  He was wearing a white cap, white shirt, and blue jeans.
[00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:25.893]  Suspect 2 is 5 foot 7, weighs 170 pounds, has gold teeth, his hair is in cornrows.
[00:45:26.273 --> 00:45:30.095]  He was wearing black pants and a black shirt that says Scarface.
[00:45:30.635 --> 00:45:35.579]  Suspect 3 is 6 feet tall, wore a red baseball cap and a white t-shirt.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:50.891]  Okay, so we got people with gold teeth and cornrows and gang member outfits who beat up whoever they want, do whatever they want, I mean that's the regular activity of gang member types.
[00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:56.276]  And some of these troops don't like it that their girlfriends were getting
[00:45:57.577 --> 00:46:00.379]  I mean, if you don't want that to happen, don't go to one of those bars.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:01.740]  Okay?
[00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:04.541]  I have been in them.
[00:46:05.862 --> 00:46:07.603]  And now I'll have to explain myself.
[00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:11.586]  My cousin, who now lives up in Chicago, is a DJ.
[00:46:11.646 --> 00:46:20.751]  And several times he was making me music tracks for videos, which you'll see listed in the credits, and I would have the enjoyment
[00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:30.545]  Of going into one of these establishments, and I assure you after that I would have him bring me the CD outside during a song, just because I don't wish to be around it.
[00:46:31.485 --> 00:46:38.566]  But I have been in these establishments, and let me just tell you, it is amazing.
[00:46:39.306 --> 00:46:40.927]  Sodom and Gomorrah is the way to describe it.
[00:46:41.147 --> 00:46:45.208]  And this is how our children are now being taught to behave.
[00:46:45.248 --> 00:46:47.408]  But again, all that is a side issue.
[00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.292]  How does this, and I know a lot of you heard this last Friday.
[00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:53.213]  I heard it rebroadcast yesterday.
[00:46:53.713 --> 00:46:59.697]  How does this transfer into... This is very important.
[00:47:01.098 --> 00:47:06.842]  How does this transfer into peace activists beating up troops?
[00:47:06.922 --> 00:47:11.525]  I mean, it's just the most... Why do they let Limbaugh do what he does?
[00:47:11.665 --> 00:47:14.547]  I mean, they got... He's gone out of his mind on the air.
[00:47:15.726 --> 00:47:17.107]  I mean, he's just gone completely.
[00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:18.809]  And folks, it was hours of it.
[00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:20.730]  Three hours of lying.
[00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.532]  I was getting into Houston.
[00:47:23.572 --> 00:47:26.535]  I could just start to pick up the JLBJ.
[00:47:27.576 --> 00:47:29.817]  Leaving Galveston, and I was listening to three hours of it.
[00:47:29.837 --> 00:47:31.399]  I heard it from start to finish yesterday.
[00:47:32.279 --> 00:47:33.640]  And I mean, I shouldn't have.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.781]  I got mad, folks.
[00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:39.785]  I mean, I was like banging the string wheel, which I rarely get that angry.
[00:47:39.825 --> 00:47:42.988]  I guess I've been disconnected from politics for a week.
[00:47:45.149 --> 00:47:47.450]  And the other stuff that made me mad while I was gone.
[00:47:47.570 --> 00:48:12.700]  I mean, I'm sitting there at the hotel on the exercise bike at 6.30 in the morning last week, and Alan Greenspan is sitting there giving a speech, and he's saying that the economy may fall apart, and that things aren't looking good in the future, and that things are getting weaker.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.621]  I mean, this is his worst dire prediction ever.
[00:48:15.538 --> 00:48:18.699]  And he says it's because of protectionist policies.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.943]  Now again, that is the equivalent of telling somebody they had liver failure because they didn't drink enough Jack Daniels.
[00:48:28.603 --> 00:48:36.406]  You're only drinking three quarts a day of Jack Daniels and so you had liver failure because you weren't drinking enough Jack Daniels.
[00:48:37.867 --> 00:48:40.988]  I mean, how do I articulate the level of that lie?
[00:48:42.248 --> 00:48:43.329]  Here is the individual
[00:48:44.378 --> 00:48:45.699]  Who is really our President.
[00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:48.581]  I mean, he gets more respect than Bush does when he goes to Congress.
[00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:50.342]  They grovel, they lick his boots.
[00:48:50.683 --> 00:48:56.587]  He is the Chairman, the CEO of the 12 families that own the 12 member banks of the private Federal Reserve.
[00:48:56.647 --> 00:48:57.528]  It's a fact, folks.
[00:48:57.908 --> 00:48:58.808]  Just a stated fact.
[00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.351]  And they have set the policy.
[00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:07.254]  He has printed all this money that's now caused the real estate bubble to get this big.
[00:49:07.495 --> 00:49:12.178]  Because real estate may be overinflated, but at least there's some tangible real value there.
[00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:14.262]  Whereas there's not in the fiat currency.
[00:49:14.442 --> 00:49:16.803]  So people are rushing to real estate.
[00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:19.504]  I mean, look at fuel doubling in the last two years.
[00:49:19.864 --> 00:49:21.745]  Look at housing doubling in the last ten.
[00:49:22.425 --> 00:49:24.105]  Look at just everything exploding.
[00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:25.846]  We've got super inflation here.
[00:49:26.606 --> 00:49:29.287]  And people are running to where at least there's some value.
[00:49:30.347 --> 00:49:31.327]  Of course it's a bubble.
[00:49:31.387 --> 00:49:33.688]  Of course it's wildly overpriced.
[00:49:34.699 --> 00:49:36.480]  But it's the only thing keeping the bubble going.
[00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:48.469]  And here he is with a needle attempting to pop it when they caused it by the last decade of just the printing presses at the Mint going so fast, folks, they had to build new lines.
[00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:53.633]  Literally running them 24 hours a day to print enough money.
[00:49:55.194 --> 00:50:03.100]  So it's the equivalent of Charlie Manson getting on the stand and chastising his cult for killing Sharon Tate.
[00:50:05.276 --> 00:50:05.756]  And her baby.
[00:50:06.977 --> 00:50:09.718]  How dare you kill Sharon Tate?
[00:50:09.918 --> 00:50:10.679]  You are evil!
[00:50:10.699 --> 00:50:14.481]  It's like having Charles Manson as the judge.
[00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:18.323]  Or Herman Goering as the judge at the Nuremberg Trials.
[00:50:18.343 --> 00:50:19.584]  I mean, it's just ridiculous!
[00:50:20.004 --> 00:50:24.426]  Number one, we have no trade barriers to speak of.
[00:50:25.247 --> 00:50:29.769]  We are awash in slave goods from India to China, to Latin America.
[00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:43.478]  To a hundred plus other third world countries, our entire industrial base has been shutting down, and as they prepare to implode the economy, Greenspan, who's the perpetrator of it all, stands up and says, because we're protectionist.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.742]  I mean, that is, that is just, just ridiculous!
[00:50:51.964 --> 00:50:53.905]  And we'll tell you about more of that when we get back.
[00:50:53.986 --> 00:50:54.826]  Your calls are coming up.

[00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:39.731]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:53:18.368 --> 00:53:18.968]  I think so.
[00:53:38.575 --> 00:53:41.477]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:27.106]  You know, back on the eve of 1929, the bankers, who'd already seized control of the country through the Federal Reserve System in 1913, allowed, quote, protectionists to put in a few trade barriers, a few tariffs on trade.
[00:54:27.547 --> 00:54:39.752]  And then when they imploded the economy, which the documents have all gone, are now all public, the bankers actually instituted the Great Depression to blow out the economy, so then they could buy up everything for pennies on the dollar.
[00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:45.018]  It was actually a empowerment time, or a shearing of the sheep.
[00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:48.119]  They actually engineered that.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:55.062]  And then, of course, blamed it on the, quote, protectionist, you know, smooth haulings act.
[00:54:55.902 --> 00:54:59.624]  But now, they don't even need to pass some tariff law or something.
[00:55:00.484 --> 00:55:06.807]  They just say, protectionist activities have caused this.
[00:55:08.708 --> 00:55:09.328]  That's all they do.
[00:55:11.334 --> 00:55:28.759]  They just say, well, we're losing our jobs, and the economy's in for a really rocky ride, and the housing bubble could implode, and oil prices are high, because, and I saw Greenspan on TV say this, and I have the transcript here in front of me as well.
[00:55:29.299 --> 00:55:32.580]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.340]  All of this is happening.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.181]  All of it.
[00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:39.962]  Because we have protectionist policies.
[00:55:41.721 --> 00:55:43.062]  Yes, yes.
[00:55:44.262 --> 00:55:47.823]  And our troops were attacked by peace activists in Seattle.
[00:55:48.383 --> 00:55:48.904]  In Limbaugh.
[00:55:49.264 --> 00:55:52.565]  I mean, it's just the level of lying is getting ridiculous.
[00:55:52.625 --> 00:56:03.389]  Oh, by the way, when I was out in Crawford two weeks ago, we had people threaten to physically attack us if we simply said to them, but no WMDs were found.
[00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:08.771]  And I got back on that Monday and people didn't believe me that it was that bad.
[00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:11.884]  That the neocons were that embarrassing.
[00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:26.627]  And then the next day, people were running over crosses with their vehicles, dragging pipes down the road, and gunshots over their heads, and the person admits, well I don't like them being here, and you know, just all of this going on.
[00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:39.350]  Well now, since then, with 4,000 people there over the weekend, thousands for Bush, thousands against Bush, but again, when I was there, there were hundreds and hundreds against the war, and five or six
[00:56:41.013 --> 00:56:44.216]  For the war, and the news said it was 50-50, so I don't know what the truth is.
[00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:45.176]  I'm sure it's the same lie.
[00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:47.959]  There were probably, you know, 100 Bush supporters and they called them 2,000.
[00:56:48.279 --> 00:56:53.103]  But, uh, in the so-called liberal media, always lying for the neocons.
[00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:56.405]  But, um, there's a story!
[00:56:57.146 --> 00:57:07.434]  There's several mainstream news articles I have here where Bush supporters would have signs that were, no war, and then under it would say, no freedom.
[00:57:08.522 --> 00:57:19.809]  But the Bush supporters were so stupid that they saw no war, and were physically pushed and almost attacked, and the sign was grabbed, and then the neocons groveled and said, no, look!
[00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:21.010]  No war!
[00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.391]  No freedom!
[00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:23.972]  We're for Bush!
[00:57:24.032 --> 00:57:25.693]  And the neocons shook their heads.
[00:57:25.753 --> 00:57:33.818]  I mean, there was actually a pack of them physically went after and was chasing, I have the article right here, chasing them and grabbing their sign.
[00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:34.319]  I mean, now,
[00:57:35.524 --> 00:57:36.685]  I guess I should have gone out there.
[00:57:36.725 --> 00:57:39.287]  We sent a reporter out there who got video this weekend.
[00:57:41.149 --> 00:57:43.171]  I heard about it down at the beach, basking.
[00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:47.555]  And so we sent Morris Wood out there.
[00:57:47.575 --> 00:57:48.996]  He's going to have that report filed.
[00:57:49.016 --> 00:57:50.217]  That will be on the website this week.
[00:57:50.637 --> 00:57:51.518]  Prison Planet folks.
[00:57:51.578 --> 00:57:52.699]  PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.305]  And I mean literally chasing people.
[00:58:00.285 --> 00:58:11.432]  So now I've got to go out there with a sign that says that I'm against the war, and I guess I'll be... Oh, and they went and tried to grab crosses, and the police let them take the names off the crosses.
[00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:16.835]  Because the people came and said, we talked to the families, and they don't want their names on these crosses.
[00:58:17.215 --> 00:58:18.276]  Well, so what?
[00:58:18.636 --> 00:58:19.817]  That's the First Amendment!
[00:58:21.073 --> 00:58:26.456]  So you found two families who you claim don't want their son's names on the crosses?
[00:58:26.716 --> 00:58:27.457]  It doesn't matter!
[00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:30.799]  It's cold free and the cops took their names off!
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.020]  Ugh!
[00:58:34.581 --> 00:58:36.642]  I mean, it's just chasing people!
[00:58:37.402 --> 00:58:39.283]  And it's insanity!

[00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:04.359]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.099 --> 00:59:05.959]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:10.641]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:14.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.162 --> 00:59:22.284]  Alright, coming up I will detail specifically what Alan Greenspan has been saying in the last week.
[00:59:22.844 --> 00:59:25.905]  In statements last week and now over the weekend, very chilling.
[00:59:27.386 --> 00:59:29.987]  Greenspan warns against protectionist trade.
[00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:37.512]  Yes, the economy's in trouble because of protectionist policies here in America, when we have the complete opposite.
[00:59:38.692 --> 00:59:42.855]  But again, the average American doesn't know what the word protectionist even means, so it doesn't matter.
[00:59:44.155 --> 00:59:45.536]  And I'm not being elitist, folks.
[00:59:45.796 --> 00:59:46.917]  I'm freaked out by this.
[00:59:47.597 --> 00:59:48.778]  The people are so dumbed down.
[00:59:50.499 --> 00:59:50.799]  U.S.
[00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:53.181]  heading for housing price crash.
[00:59:53.801 --> 00:59:55.202]  I just quote, crash.
[00:59:55.993 --> 00:59:57.955]  Greenspan's using words like crash.
[00:59:59.676 --> 01:00:03.339]  Greenspan tells buyers, we'll get into that, there's just so much coming up.
[01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:05.140]  I know we got loaded phone lines, okay?
[01:00:05.781 --> 01:00:13.086]  I'm fully aware of Jason and Stavos, Michael and Mike and everybody.
[01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:18.270]  I want to go to Stuart Nelson, who's been a good friend of mine for many years.
[01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:23.955]  He was one of the carpenters that helped us build a new home for a veteran whose home they bulldozed here in Austin.
[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:27.735]  And then of course he helped with the Memorial Chapel in Waco.
[01:00:28.496 --> 01:00:36.049]  One of the head carpenters who was there, Hooper, died of complications in the hospital in Houston over the weekend.
[01:00:36.778 --> 01:00:39.360]  So he was calling in about that, but also, I didn't know this.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:47.384]  We sent a camera guy, because I was out of town, to Crawford for some of the bedlam, some of the hatred, some of the neoconism this weekend.
[01:00:47.404 --> 01:00:48.345]  We'll be having that for you.
[01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:50.747]  I haven't even seen the video yet, but I'm told it's pretty powerful.
[01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:54.008]  But Stewart called in, and I said, is that the Stewart I know?
[01:00:54.089 --> 01:00:55.169]  And sure enough, it was.
[01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:02.233]  And I figured he was calling about Hooper, but he was calling about... Also, he went to Crawford where, according to some reports, there were 4,000 people.
[01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:08.609]  1,500 bush worshippers, 2,500 dead wedding liberals.
[01:01:08.869 --> 01:01:12.611]  And again, both sides are pretty dumbed down and mindless.
[01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:16.192]  Though there are some real people in the peace group who I agree with.
[01:01:16.212 --> 01:01:17.573]  They have every right to be there.
[01:01:17.953 --> 01:01:24.676]  The neocons are violent and hateful and out of control and so all our stations get a chance to hear this.
[01:01:25.296 --> 01:01:28.598]  I'm going to go to calls as soon as we start the next segment.
[01:01:29.098 --> 01:01:29.878]  Here in a couple minutes.
[01:01:30.338 --> 01:01:31.719]  So we'll go to Stuart and we'll go to
[01:01:32.313 --> 01:01:35.155]  Jason and Michael and Mike and Stavos and everybody else.
[01:01:35.835 --> 01:01:39.358]  I mean, what do you say, folks?
[01:01:39.378 --> 01:01:43.721]  I mean, people have trouble believing me when I talk about neocons threatening to physically attack me.
[01:01:45.562 --> 01:01:53.427]  If I just calmly said, but Bush said there were WMDs, I'll take a swing at you, you bleeper!
[01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:59.251]  But Bush is actually, you know, big government, open borders.
[01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:01.253]  Shut up and back off, boy!
[01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:04.639]  Son, you see that man?
[01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.340]  You may have to kill him someday.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.061]  Well, now the running over of the crosses.
[01:02:10.121 --> 01:02:18.003]  Well, now even neocons whose signs, again as I said last hour, say things like, I've got the articles right here.
[01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:18.504]  It's admitted.
[01:02:18.884 --> 01:02:19.644]  Mainstream news.
[01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.965]  And the neocons are very, very sorry.
[01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:29.727]  These two idiots, they're called warriors or whatever, this neocon group, they have a sign saying that
[01:02:32.111 --> 01:02:33.272]  No war, no freedom.
[01:02:33.312 --> 01:02:39.675]  Well, the sign said, no war, big on top, and people saw it up on top the sign, and they physically began attacking them.
[01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:45.539]  Just, oh my gosh, and they had to beg them as they were being attacked, no, no, no, no, please help me!
[01:02:46.259 --> 01:02:48.460]  Look, I've got, I'm, I'm a worshipper!
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.381]  Oh, we're sorry, brother!
[01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:51.542]  We're sorry, brother!
[01:02:51.622 --> 01:03:00.067]  In our, in our piranha, piranha-like, you know, uh, feeding frenzy, we, we, we, we have attacked you, brother!
[01:03:00.754 --> 01:03:04.396]  And they're grabbing at the crosses and just frothing.
[01:03:05.876 --> 01:03:16.901]  And again, I've been there when, let's be serious, there are 10 people, 4 Bush, and 300 against the war, and the news says 50-50.
[01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:18.842]  Okay, I've been there, I've seen it.
[01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.803]  So I don't know what the truth is.
[01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:26.085]  Were there 1,500 Bush worshippers bussed in from neocon radio stations?
[01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:32.558]  And, again, the story itself really, I think, is a big distraction.
[01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:40.840]  We've talked way too much about this, but it's the little story surrounding it that's kind of a microcosm that makes it so important.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:46.801]  So, we'll briefly cover that, and then we'll get to all the rest of your calls.
[01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:49.142]  Stuart Nelson is up first.
[01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:50.782]  When we get back, stay with us.
[01:03:55.316 --> 01:03:58.157]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.417 --> 01:03:59.998]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.338 --> 01:04:05.000]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.781]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:14.343]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.603 --> 01:04:17.444]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.544 --> 01:04:22.206]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:26.787]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:27.047 --> 01:04:34.249]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:36.950]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.851]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:04:38.951 --> 01:04:45.000]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.991]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.705]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:57.745 --> 01:05:01.926]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:02.186 --> 01:05:04.967]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.568]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:07.748 --> 01:05:16.390]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:17.931]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:22.312]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:22.632 --> 01:05:23.393]  We're good to go!
[01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:44.343]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:45.284]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.069 --> 01:06:00.816]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel September 19th and 20th.
[01:06:00.836 --> 01:06:03.580]  Store prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.681]  Featuring the Ms.
[01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:12.912]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for health, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[01:06:13.312 --> 01:06:17.717]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[01:06:17.737 --> 01:06:18.838]  See a fashion show.
[01:06:19.118 --> 01:06:21.701]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Man.
[01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:23.503]  There's something new every hour.
[01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:27.106]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[01:06:27.487 --> 01:06:31.171]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[01:06:31.491 --> 01:06:34.454]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[01:06:35.715 --> 01:06:39.297]  For discount tickets, visit 101expos.com or call 612-798-7256.
[01:06:39.397 --> 01:06:49.224]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[01:06:49.504 --> 01:06:52.666]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[01:06:55.248 --> 01:07:01.272]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:04.854]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:11.699]  I got started but didn't finish.
[01:07:14.183 --> 01:07:15.324]  An important program note.
[01:07:16.046 --> 01:07:17.908]  We're gaining a lot of new affiliates.
[01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:19.871]  They're seeking us out.
[01:07:21.152 --> 01:07:24.656]  Because so much of what we've talked about in the past is now pretty much mainstream news.
[01:07:24.936 --> 01:07:36.347]  We're not as radical as we used to be, and there's a lot of really honorable, great stations out there that really do love freedom and love liberty and do want to keep our Second Amendment and our sovereignty.
[01:07:36.908 --> 01:07:42.013]  And so they're putting this truly, you know, classical conservative program on the air.
[01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:48.011]  Well, it looks like we'll probably be going on in San Francisco here pretty quick.
[01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:51.152]  I'm not going to talk about that until it happens, but they've contacted us.
[01:07:51.172 --> 01:07:51.953]  We're pretty close.
[01:07:51.973 --> 01:07:53.233]  That'll be a big deal if that happens.
[01:07:54.454 --> 01:07:59.816]  We'll be in the home of one of the chief beatniks, the oily beatniks, Michael Savage.
[01:07:59.836 --> 01:08:02.617]  You know, liberals in conservative's clothing.
[01:08:03.138 --> 01:08:08.440]  But in Rockford, Illinois, we're already on several other great affiliates that cover Chicago.
[01:08:09.393 --> 01:08:12.316]  In Illinois as well, but now Rockford, Illinois.
[01:08:13.216 --> 01:08:18.481]  W-L-U-V, or W-L-O-V, 1520 AM.
[01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:26.647]  So if you live anywhere around Rockford, Illinois, be sure and tell folks, 1520 AM and go to the station and get a bumper sticker.
[01:08:27.848 --> 01:08:29.009]  And that's something you can do.
[01:08:29.049 --> 01:08:38.617]  I mean, if you're listening to a station we've been on for, say, five, six years, like our great affiliate up in Kansas City, or WVTJ down in Pensacola, Florida.
[01:08:39.934 --> 01:08:42.055]  Or Radio Free Fredericksburg here in Texas.
[01:08:42.815 --> 01:08:46.797]  You've been listening to us, you know, for four, five, six years on a station.
[01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:49.718]  Still, keep telling people about that station.
[01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:51.299]  We need to get even more listeners there.
[01:08:52.039 --> 01:08:56.841]  About especially new affiliates like WLUV 1520.
[01:08:57.682 --> 01:08:59.923]  We're getting a new affiliate every week.
[01:09:00.983 --> 01:09:05.205]  And what's happened over the years is we always hover around the same number of stations.
[01:09:06.505 --> 01:09:07.986]  Around 80 stations or so.
[01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:14.573]  Because we get new stations, but then stations sell, or they change formats, or whatever happens.
[01:09:14.794 --> 01:09:16.595]  We never seem to grow past that point.
[01:09:16.915 --> 01:09:20.678]  But we have exploded in the last six months past that, and are growing.
[01:09:20.718 --> 01:09:23.700]  And I want to thank all of those stations and their sponsors.
[01:09:24.621 --> 01:09:29.104]  And so if you're listening, be sure and call the station and thank them, all of our affiliates.
[01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.607]  And be sure and support that station's sponsors.
[01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.428]  Or if you have a local business,
[01:09:36.121 --> 01:09:39.683]  Go support them, because this is so critical.
[01:09:40.303 --> 01:09:49.188]  I mean, we are reaching millions of people a week through these AM and FM affiliates, and again, I'm just humbled by it and thankful.
[01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:51.009]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now.
[01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:53.510]  I've been gone for a week, folks.
[01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:57.172]  It's hard to get to your calls just because there's so much I want to talk about.
[01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:00.474]  Let's go to Stuart Nelson, a good friend of mine who called in.
[01:10:01.877 --> 01:10:02.897]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:03.518]  Hey, Stewart.
[01:10:03.598 --> 01:10:06.058]  I hear that you're here in Austin.
[01:10:06.559 --> 01:10:08.579]  You went to Crawford this weekend.
[01:10:08.619 --> 01:10:09.359]  What did you witness?
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.741]  And let me tell you, Stewart has the Second Amendment stickers on his car.
[01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:17.022]  I mean, he's more right-wing than Attila the Hun.
[01:10:17.402 --> 01:10:19.523]  But what did you think of these neocons?
[01:10:20.323 --> 01:10:21.724]  It was mind-blowing.
[01:10:21.824 --> 01:10:22.544]  It really was.
[01:10:22.624 --> 01:10:25.565]  Jack was put a call out, a bunch of us convoyed down there.
[01:10:27.005 --> 01:10:28.706]  And I went to Camp Casey, too.
[01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:33.062]  Went downtown Crawford, you know where the stores are and all that.
[01:10:33.102 --> 01:10:35.723]  That's where I saw most of the neocons.
[01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:39.945]  I did not go to Camp Casey 1, but I was downtown and walked through their crowd.
[01:10:40.345 --> 01:10:44.406]  I had my girlfriend with me, so I didn't want to engage in any conversation, really.
[01:10:45.707 --> 01:10:48.968]  But, I mean, these people, I mean, bug-eyed, angry.
[01:10:49.628 --> 01:10:57.291]  The spirit, the attitude, the... It was just hatred and bitterness and anger.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.041]  Well, when you go to Camp Casey II, you're around the Peace House.
[01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:06.264]  It's an atmosphere of peace and acceptance and love.
[01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:09.325]  Even if your perspective is a little different, we welcome you.
[01:11:09.345 --> 01:11:11.746]  Now, they really are nice folks.
[01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:15.268]  I mean, a few of them are greebling liberals, but most of them are really nice.
[01:11:15.668 --> 01:11:15.808]  Right.
[01:11:15.828 --> 01:11:19.190]  There were people with their Howard Dean t-shirts on and so on.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:39.916]  Uh, you know, we walked through the crowd there with everybody waving, the neocon bunch, the Bush war supporters, and waving their plastic American flags, and I wish now that I would have asked them, can I see where that flag is made, and kind of show them that their flag is made in China, but uh... Now did you hear about how
[01:11:40.945 --> 01:11:50.713]  They actually saw neocons with a sign that said, no war, no freedom, but the no war was on top, and now they physically went and tackled them and chased them down?
[01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:54.276]  I mean, did you witness any frothing?
[01:11:55.557 --> 01:11:59.960]  Well, I didn't witness anybody getting, as far as that happened, no.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:08.167]  But people standing on the corner downtown Crawford were screaming at Cindy Sheehan, just
[01:12:09.719 --> 01:12:11.700]  You just, yeah, frothing at the mouth.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.000]  That's really a good way to put it.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.101]  Was there a lot of profanity?
[01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:15.321]  Yes, there was.
[01:12:15.341 --> 01:12:17.142]  As a matter of fact, I went down there with my girlfriend.
[01:12:17.162 --> 01:12:18.023]  We took her car.
[01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.903]  She's got stickers on the back of her car.
[01:12:19.963 --> 01:12:28.227]  We get back to her car and there's a letter on her, uh, a note with just cuss words all over it because of the bumper stickers she had on her car.
[01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:34.703]  And, you know, it's just, it's just... I mean, I couldn't even sleep that next night.
[01:12:34.843 --> 01:12:36.104]  I was just so blown away.
[01:12:36.404 --> 01:12:40.906]  I mean, I'm thinking that I... And by the way, these guys would love to man concentration camps.
[01:12:40.946 --> 01:12:43.987]  They'd love to take our guns, because they'll have the guns.
[01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:45.808]  They love big government.
[01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:48.349]  They love Bush doubling the size of the BATF.
[01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:51.230]  I had them tell me that I was a right-wing Republican.
[01:12:52.048 --> 01:12:54.409]  I mean, imagine going, hey, Bush is a conservative.
[01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.910]  You're one of them right-wingers!
[01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:57.311]  Get the bleep out of here!
[01:12:57.771 --> 01:13:00.973]  I mean, they know, a lot of them know they're not conservatives.
[01:13:01.213 --> 01:13:06.637]  These are dirty beatniks, dirty, oily slimebags who could never take over in the 60s.
[01:13:06.677 --> 01:13:07.837]  They're now Bush worshippers.
[01:13:08.938 --> 01:13:10.319]  Oh, man, I tell you, we're in trouble.
[01:13:11.239 --> 01:13:13.881]  But Ted Casey, too, had at least 4,000 people there.
[01:13:16.053 --> 01:13:22.276]  And everybody there was kind, and they had food everywhere, free drinks, water.
[01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:34.741]  Well, my experience is, when I was there and I talked to a bunch of other reporters that I trust who were there during other periods, you got like 300 pro Camp Casey people and a maximum of 10 bush worshippers.
[01:13:34.781 --> 01:13:36.202]  And I've got videos on the website.
[01:13:36.722 --> 01:13:38.083]  But then National News said 50-50.
[01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:38.263]  Right.
[01:13:43.104 --> 01:13:44.124]  That's what Hogg was.
[01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:54.388]  Hey, did you hear me talk about Limbaugh saying that peace activists attacked two soldiers at a bar in Seattle?
[01:13:55.008 --> 01:13:56.588]  And no one ever said that.
[01:13:56.628 --> 01:13:59.409]  It was gang members over their girlfriends.
[01:14:00.249 --> 01:14:00.790]  Oh, man.
[01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:03.850]  I guess they're so desperate because they're drinking Kool-Aid.
[01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:07.352]  Yeah, but I mean, lies of that level.
[01:14:07.452 --> 01:14:11.173]  Just saying that peace activists... And he wasn't joking!
[01:14:13.872 --> 01:14:19.496]  You know, and we get back to the car with just cuss words all over this thing.
[01:14:20.097 --> 01:14:39.354]  I mean, during a break, I thought, Stewart from Texas, Hooper died, I bet that's Stewart, my friend, went and talked to you, and you hadn't told me about the cussing until we got on air, but of course I was, it's not hard to predict it because I have hours of video of it, that of course we can't really put on, we did put some of it on the website, but we bleeped it all out,
[01:14:39.995 --> 01:14:50.917]  And I mean, if you just calmly ask them a question that isn't a mindless bleating of, you know, like a goose or something, I worship Bush, I worship Bush.
[01:14:51.498 --> 01:14:55.178]  I mean, literally, if you don't just repeat a mantra, they will begin screaming, cussing.
[01:14:55.438 --> 01:14:57.599]  Did you have any of them threaten to attack you?
[01:14:58.339 --> 01:14:59.099]  No, I didn't have them.
[01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:00.059]  That's right, you didn't talk to them.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:01.540]  Yeah, I didn't really engage.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.500]  But they did see the communication on your car.
[01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:07.101]  What were the bumper stickers on your girlfriend's car?
[01:15:07.891 --> 01:15:20.239]  Oh, basically, bring them home sticker, uh, Bush is, uh, a, uh, chimp, um, stop the war, uh, Bush is a liar, you know, things like that that are kind of true.
[01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:27.523]  Oh, have you heard that, uh, the big TV network will not run Cindy Sheehan's mild TV ad because it claims there were no WMDs?
[01:15:29.064 --> 01:15:29.684]  Oh, gosh.
[01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:30.665]  No, I didn't hear that.
[01:15:30.885 --> 01:15:34.207]  Yeah, so now that, oh, there are WMDs, uh-huh.
[01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:35.548]  Oh, gosh.
[01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:37.632]  Take care of myself.
[01:15:38.013 --> 01:15:40.813]  Hooper, of course, good friend of ours, died over the weekend.
[01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.594]  Do you know when the funeral service will be?
[01:15:42.974 --> 01:15:43.834]  No, I don't know yet.
[01:15:43.854 --> 01:15:45.355]  I'm going to call and find that out today.
[01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:47.555]  Alright, well call me back when you find out, Skirt.
[01:15:47.635 --> 01:15:48.136]  Okay, great.
[01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:48.336]  Thanks.
[01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:49.176]  Take care.
[01:15:50.176 --> 01:15:50.976]  Okay.
[01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:55.518]  Listen, I don't mean to spend all day on this Camp Casey thing.
[01:15:56.972 --> 01:16:12.596]  Really, in and of itself, it is a distraction because it creates that left-right friction that the globalists love, basically divide and conquer, to get us fighting with each other, in kind of a sports team mentality, to switch off the thinking process.
[01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:19.879]  But to just case-by-case point look at all of the... Folks, if you're doubting me, go out to Camp Casey.
[01:16:19.939 --> 01:16:25.000]  It is just the neocons, when there's ten of them, they act like animals.
[01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:29.683]  I couldn't imagine hundreds of them.
[01:16:29.703 --> 01:16:31.964]  I forgot to ask Stuart the actual numbers of them.
[01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.366]  He said 4,000 pro-Camp Casey.
[01:16:35.406 --> 01:16:36.647]  I didn't get the numbers from him.
[01:16:38.988 --> 01:16:39.408]  On the other.
[01:16:40.369 --> 01:16:42.850]  He just said, saying it was 50-50s baloney.
[01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:45.532]  Which is the standard line.
[01:16:45.572 --> 01:16:48.373]  The media is still saying it's 50-50.
[01:16:48.413 --> 01:16:50.174]  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.
[01:16:50.234 --> 01:16:51.055]  Jason, go ahead.
[01:16:51.075 --> 01:16:52.556]  Hi, thanks Alex.
[01:16:53.519 --> 01:16:57.682]  I was wondering if you were, actually I just want your take on something.
[01:16:57.902 --> 01:17:02.566]  Colin Powell, I read, was supposed to be signing a U.N.
[01:17:02.606 --> 01:17:13.695]  charter for a Palestinian state with huge Israeli concessions on 9-11, 2001, and I was wondering what your take was on the timing of that.
[01:17:13.775 --> 01:17:15.096]  It was supposed to be at 10 a.m.
[01:17:15.136 --> 01:17:18.859]  and it was thwarted by the attack, obviously.
[01:17:21.976 --> 01:17:25.137]  I was not familiar with the specific thing.
[01:17:25.157 --> 01:17:33.339]  I mean, I know that they were having meetings at that time, but I know we've got the Israeli pullout of some areas going on right now, which is a brutal scene.
[01:17:33.699 --> 01:17:33.919]  Right.
[01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:36.880]  But I wasn't specifically aware of that day, that hour.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.600]  Yes, at 10 a.m.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:48.402]  was when the paper was to be signed by Colin Powell, and then for obvious reasons it didn't happen, and it just seemed like an odd thing, you know?
[01:17:49.703 --> 01:17:51.103]  Something that they would want, and
[01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:53.014]  to thwart it themselves.
[01:17:53.614 --> 01:17:55.034]  I just couldn't put it together.
[01:17:55.635 --> 01:18:00.016]  Well, I've been roundly criticized for not saying that Israel carried out 9-11.
[01:18:01.057 --> 01:18:03.298]  Well, Israel can't make NORAD stand down.
[01:18:03.398 --> 01:18:07.779]  Israel can't fly Al-Qaeda out of the country.
[01:18:07.919 --> 01:18:10.580]  Israel can't warn Willie Brown not to fly.
[01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:13.582]  Certainly, Israel had knowledge.
[01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:19.644]  Israel and intelligence agencies were intimately connected into the groups that did carry it out.
[01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:27.917]  But, you know, we've had Israeli pilots go public about attacking the USS Liberty under orders.
[01:18:29.018 --> 01:18:34.703]  So, I mean, Israel knows their own people aren't that evil to carry out a 9-11.
[01:18:34.723 --> 01:18:37.485]  The government itself didn't carry it out.
[01:18:38.586 --> 01:18:45.332]  The globalists that are in control of Israel certainly did carry it out, but to say just Israel did it, I think is
[01:18:46.585 --> 01:18:48.106]  Well, do you want to comment more on that, Jason?
[01:18:48.146 --> 01:18:48.967]  Yes, you can help me.
[01:18:48.987 --> 01:18:49.467]  Well, stay there.
[01:18:49.487 --> 01:18:50.988]  Yeah, we got a break right here.
[01:18:51.008 --> 01:18:53.230]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.113]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:18:58.353 --> 01:19:00.134]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[01:19:00.354 --> 01:19:03.997]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:19:04.297 --> 01:19:10.161]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:19:10.281 --> 01:19:12.242]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:19:12.382 --> 01:19:16.245]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:19:16.565 --> 01:19:20.248]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:19:20.428 --> 01:19:25.251]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:19:25.391 --> 01:19:32.957]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic, you can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[01:19:33.197 --> 01:19:36.419]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy and
[01:19:36.619 --> 01:19:36.899]  We're good.
[01:19:55.476 --> 01:19:58.439]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:58.819 --> 01:20:07.646]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:07.966 --> 01:20:12.630]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:19.835]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:20.236 --> 01:20:32.005]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:33.226]  Currency devaluation.
[01:20:33.266 --> 01:20:33.686]  Inflation.
[01:20:33.726 --> 01:20:34.346]  One and the same.
[01:21:00.786 --> 01:21:05.832]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:12.825 --> 01:21:15.967]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:19.068]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:23.510]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:24.711 --> 01:21:25.611]  Here's reality.
[01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:29.533]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:30.614 --> 01:21:34.256]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:35.036 --> 01:21:38.920]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:04.377]  I will say this for what Jason brought up.
[01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:07.699]  9-11 helped governments worldwide, period.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:12.723]  Unless you were one of the, quote, rogue nations, i.e.
[01:23:12.823 --> 01:23:22.629]  a government or country, regardless of the leadership, I'm not debating that, that didn't play ball with the new world order, then you get invaded.
[01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:29.174]  But for all the other countries of the world, from China to Russia to India to Mexico,
[01:23:30.871 --> 01:23:34.473]  For the United Kingdom, Deutschland, France, the U.S.
[01:23:34.994 --> 01:23:38.356]  It was used as a police state crackdown mechanism.
[01:23:38.656 --> 01:23:41.658]  Bush told his own biographer in 99.
[01:23:41.798 --> 01:23:46.621]  His biographer, the guy he hired, has gone public and said, yeah, Bush said, I'm going to start wars.
[01:23:47.342 --> 01:23:51.825]  I'm going to be a war president because you can't question a war president.
[01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:56.928]  Oh, and Richard Clark says that he's a dirty liberal.
[01:23:57.489 --> 01:23:59.550]  When O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary says,
[01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:03.314]  That's what they were talking about day one in the White House.
[01:24:03.374 --> 01:24:03.935]  First day!
[01:24:05.796 --> 01:24:06.677]  Late January.
[01:24:09.719 --> 01:24:17.605]  First thing they were doing was talking about the oil fields in Iraq and going to war and how to get that job done.
[01:24:19.247 --> 01:24:22.489]  And certainly it helped Israel set up more of a police state.
[01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:24.751]  And certainly it helped Egypt do that.
[01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:26.552]  It's been used all over the world.
[01:24:27.705 --> 01:24:32.468]  To say it's just Israel, which I'm not accusing Jason of, I was bringing up what others have said.
[01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:41.673]  To say it's just Israel, number one, isn't true, and shields the globalists themselves.
[01:24:42.193 --> 01:24:43.114]  Anything else, Jason?
[01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:44.114]  You wanted to say something else?
[01:24:44.355 --> 01:24:52.359]  Yes, I wanted to know if you have heard of a paper issued by the Israeli government called the Daniel Project recently?
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:53.660]  Yes, I have.
[01:24:54.275 --> 01:24:58.376]  And I was wondering about your take on that, and isn't that a pretty scary paper?
[01:24:59.036 --> 01:24:59.376]  It is.
[01:24:59.436 --> 01:25:00.697]  Why don't you fill folks in on it?
[01:25:01.377 --> 01:25:04.698]  Well, it says that they have a short window of opportunity.
[01:25:04.758 --> 01:25:18.461]  I'm not certain of the time of the writing of the paper, but a very short window of opportunity to attack Iran before their nuclear capabilities are beyond the point of no return.
[01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:19.361]  That's right.
[01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:23.122]  The CIA's own estimates
[01:25:24.111 --> 01:25:25.071]  Are at 10 years.
[01:25:25.992 --> 01:25:27.512]  The Israeli estimates are at 4.
[01:25:29.593 --> 01:25:31.133]  That is not a short time.
[01:25:31.153 --> 01:25:34.854]  They have video cameras inside these facilities.
[01:25:36.435 --> 01:25:38.175]  They can't do anything with it.
[01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:39.736]  Israel has 400 nukes.
[01:25:40.956 --> 01:25:42.177]  It's a joke, okay?
[01:25:42.217 --> 01:25:44.817]  The globalists want war because it's so profitable.
[01:25:45.398 --> 01:25:49.559]  The war itself is a diversion to what's happening here domestically.
[01:25:49.599 --> 01:25:50.119]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:57.154]  And Israel may drag us in to a war with Iran by preemptively attacking them.
[01:25:57.715 --> 01:25:59.316]  And then we have a defense treaty with them.
[01:26:00.357 --> 01:26:08.586]  I mean, I had George Galloway, senior member of the British Parliament, on a few months ago, before the London bombings, about a week or two before, and I said,
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:15.102]  He said, well, they want to attack Iran, and maybe Israel can drag us in, but they're just as a support.
[01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:20.643]  And I said, what of their terrorist attacks carried out by our government to be blamed on Iran?
[01:26:20.683 --> 01:26:22.984]  He said, that is a very real threat.
[01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:25.844]  And we're a parliament agreeing with us.
[01:26:27.545 --> 01:26:28.685]  I interviewed Michael Meacher.
[01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:29.786]  He said similar things.
[01:26:29.846 --> 01:26:30.586]  Member of Parliament.
[01:26:31.006 --> 01:26:32.706]  Number three man in Blair's government.
[01:26:32.746 --> 01:26:35.147]  I mean, folks, this is serious business.
[01:26:36.027 --> 01:26:37.368]  Michael in New York.
[01:26:37.508 --> 01:26:38.348]  You're on the air.
[01:26:38.408 --> 01:26:38.828]  Go ahead.
[01:26:39.847 --> 01:26:41.029]  Hi Alex, welcome back.
[01:26:41.449 --> 01:26:42.110]  Thank you.
[01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:55.827]  Well you know Alex, clearly we're building a bunch of bases in Iraq so the intention is we're there to stay and clearly to expand the war and any means to achieve that of course for the globalist agenda will
[01:26:56.628 --> 01:27:01.211]  Well gee, I mean, you're probably some liberal making up that lie.
[01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:05.133]  We just want to give freedom to the Iraqis.
[01:27:05.213 --> 01:27:05.653]  Oh really?
[01:27:05.793 --> 01:27:12.857]  Dick Cheney says the plan is to never leave and use Iraq as a base to attack Iran and Syria.
[01:27:13.137 --> 01:27:17.900]  Now, should we listen to Dick Cheney, or should we just keep claiming it's some evil liberal lie?
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.343]  Well, if it's an evil liberal lie, why have the majority of the Democrats voted for it?
[01:27:22.563 --> 01:27:27.946]  Why is the biggest cheerleaders Chuckie Schumer and Hillary dirtbag Clinton?
[01:27:29.016 --> 01:27:32.819]  Hillary Rotten Clinton is how we call her over here in New York.
[01:27:32.839 --> 01:27:35.380]  Don't you call good conservative American names.
[01:27:36.401 --> 01:27:51.111]  Now Alex, speaking of that, yeah you know I used to think like you, Limbaugh was conservative back in the days when Clinton was president and Limbaugh started to come out with like finally conservative getting his voice out on the air somebody talking and speaking what we feel
[01:27:51.950 --> 01:28:02.595]  And then when the Republicans came in, it started to become obvious, hold on, this guy's not really a conservative, he's really now just a stooge for the controllers of the Republican Party.
[01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:04.796]  And so you're right on the money with that.
[01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:15.901]  And Alex, I just want to say, when you came along, because I was on the trail of the New World Order back in the 70s when I was a kid, but to get the evidence on it was difficult, and when you came along,
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:22.262]  You were heaven sent because you're just an incredible reservoir of information.
[01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:24.583]  Getting it out there to people.
[01:28:26.864 --> 01:28:30.685]  Thank God for you and all the work you're doing and all your associates at GCN.
[01:28:30.985 --> 01:28:33.406]  But Alex, if I could, I'd like to make a couple more comments.
[01:28:33.586 --> 01:28:34.947]  Alright, Poll Watch is coming up.
[01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:40.169]  If you want to hold, Mike, we'll get to you and the other Michael and Robert and Matt and everybody else.
[01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:42.730]  We'll tell you about Greenspan when we get back first.
[01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.871]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.812 --> 01:28:51.496]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.677 --> 01:28:57.038]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:57.278 --> 01:29:01.119]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:01.439 --> 01:29:02.259]  Read the labels.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.821]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:11.222]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:11.602 --> 01:29:16.464]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:16.864 --> 01:29:20.446]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:20.626 --> 01:29:25.968]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:26.248 --> 01:29:28.969]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:29.269 --> 01:29:30.169]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:41.194]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:57.191]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:02.432]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.692 --> 01:30:07.053]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:16.255]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:30:25.684 --> 01:30:32.394]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.907 --> 01:30:33.568]  What about you?

[01:30:56.019 --> 01:31:02.843]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.505]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:31:05.745 --> 01:31:07.706]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:31:08.047 --> 01:31:13.390]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:13.890]  Yes!
[01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:18.075]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:31:18.496 --> 01:31:21.039]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[01:31:21.259 --> 01:31:26.405]  With this 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:31:26.605 --> 01:31:33.694]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:31:34.174 --> 01:31:37.337]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.

[01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:16.812]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here Monday through Friday from 11 to Central Standard Time.
[01:32:17.352 --> 01:32:18.953]  Back from 9 to midnight Central.
[01:32:19.573 --> 01:32:20.853]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:32:20.893 --> 01:32:21.254]  Eastern.
[01:32:23.074 --> 01:32:30.936]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us here in just a few minutes and we're going to let Mike and Michael and Robert and Matt and everybody have their say as well.
[01:32:31.637 --> 01:32:35.818]  But I've really got to comment on this a little bit more and then get Paul's take on it.
[01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:40.869]  Just some amazing statements by Alan Greenspan.
[01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:41.910]  U.S.
[01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:46.213]  heading for housing price crash.
[01:32:47.133 --> 01:32:48.834]  Greenspan tells buyers.
[01:32:49.435 --> 01:32:52.137]  What a headline from the Financial Times of London.
[01:32:52.717 --> 01:32:54.578]  Using the word crash.
[01:32:55.379 --> 01:32:55.939]  Crash.
[01:32:56.179 --> 01:32:57.080]  The Great Crash.
[01:33:08.547 --> 01:33:13.190]  of a crash if they continue to drive property prices higher.
[01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:15.191]  He said that the U.S.
[01:33:15.711 --> 01:33:24.716]  house price spiral had become an economic imbalance, threatening stability like the country's trade gap or its budget deficit.
[01:33:26.277 --> 01:33:26.717]  I love it.
[01:33:26.777 --> 01:33:31.660]  I mean this is like somebody that saws your legs off and then tells you you need crutches.
[01:33:32.754 --> 01:33:35.975]  The Federal Reserve runs our entire economic system.
[01:33:36.496 --> 01:33:37.856]  They set the interest rates.
[01:33:37.896 --> 01:33:39.797]  They tell the Treasury and the U.S.
[01:33:39.857 --> 01:33:41.377]  Mint how much money to print.
[01:33:41.898 --> 01:33:43.518]  They openly run everything.
[01:33:43.558 --> 01:33:47.000]  They are private with the 12 families that are private shareholders.
[01:33:49.261 --> 01:33:57.484]  And then they create the economic climate that does this to us and then stand around grandstanding pointing out the illness.
[01:33:58.953 --> 01:34:15.316]  It would be like if a doctor walked up to you and shot you in the head with a .45 caliber handgun, .45 handgun cartridge, and then announced, I'm smart, look, I can tell you just by looking at the hole, it's a .45.
[01:34:15.976 --> 01:34:20.097]  I mean, it just, there's no end to it.
[01:34:20.117 --> 01:34:23.378]  I mean, this is just too ridiculous.
[01:34:26.599 --> 01:34:45.687]  In a pre-retirement speech to fellow central bankers at Jackson's Hole, Wyoming, for all the elitist hangout, Mr. Greenspan said that people were investing in houses as if they were a one-way bet, not allowing for the risk of price falls, he said.
[01:34:45.747 --> 01:34:49.709]  History had not dealt kindly with investors who kept ignoring risk.
[01:34:51.201 --> 01:35:06.210]  Well, if the currency has lost 45% of its value in the last three years, and energy prices have doubled, doubled, and it may go higher now, then where are you supposed to invest?
[01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:10.892]  I mean, gold certainly is a good investment.
[01:35:10.952 --> 01:35:11.813]  I mean, gold has
[01:35:12.518 --> 01:35:14.619]  Gone up by about 50% in the last few years.
[01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:18.462]  I haven't sold my meager holdings because it's pure insurance.
[01:35:18.942 --> 01:35:21.083]  I know it may go down or it may explode in price.
[01:35:21.384 --> 01:35:22.024]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:22.044 --> 01:35:26.467]  It at least has some tangible real base value.
[01:35:27.627 --> 01:35:28.628]  Like a skill.
[01:35:28.888 --> 01:35:37.774]  Being an auto mechanic, or being a dentist, or being a masseuse, or being a farmer, or being a plumber.
[01:35:38.734 --> 01:35:40.295]  That's a real investment.
[01:35:40.335 --> 01:35:41.436]  That's a real skill.
[01:35:42.049 --> 01:35:43.450]  That is tangible.
[01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:46.931]  Property is a real tangible thing.
[01:35:47.592 --> 01:35:50.953]  And so people are investing because everything else is fiat.
[01:35:51.353 --> 01:35:55.035]  It is spiraling, spiraling, spiraling, spiraling upwards.
[01:35:56.516 --> 01:35:57.936]  It's grossly inflated.
[01:35:58.396 --> 01:36:02.778]  But would you rather have... Here's another analogy.
[01:36:02.798 --> 01:36:03.839]  You know I'm the king of these.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:07.921]  Whether they're good or not.
[01:36:08.501 --> 01:36:10.762]  I may be the king of bad analogies, but so what?
[01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:16.953]  Would you rather have a air-filled donut with a small amount of jelly in it?
[01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:19.734]  Or would you rather eat air?
[01:36:20.735 --> 01:36:22.255]  You see, the dollar is air.
[01:36:22.475 --> 01:36:24.076]  The dollar could have zero value.
[01:36:24.697 --> 01:36:25.157]  Thin air.
[01:36:25.557 --> 01:36:27.118]  Would you rather have thin air?
[01:36:28.559 --> 01:36:33.901]  Or would you rather have a glass of water with a squeeze of lemon in it?
[01:36:35.062 --> 01:36:41.245]  It may not have much nutritional value, but it is light years ahead of drinking thin air.
[01:36:44.448 --> 01:36:46.429]  With almost no moisture in it.
[01:36:48.751 --> 01:36:49.031]  Okay?
[01:36:49.691 --> 01:36:59.958]  And, you know, that's really a bad analogy because it's more like saying, you know, would you rather have Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, with not a lot of value in it, or thin air?
[01:37:00.578 --> 01:37:02.619]  You could survive on Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.
[01:37:02.879 --> 01:37:04.340]  You couldn't survive on thin air.
[01:37:05.441 --> 01:37:05.881]  So where?
[01:37:05.901 --> 01:37:06.662]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:37:08.548 --> 01:37:15.332]  It's just, it's so... and then, as if that isn't bad enough, folks, Greenspan warns against protectionist trade.
[01:37:16.753 --> 01:37:26.398]  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that the housing boom is causing major distortions in the economy and suggests it must be reined in in what higher interest rates.
[01:37:26.739 --> 01:37:29.240]  But he warned in a speech at a gathering of economists
[01:37:30.788 --> 01:37:41.940]  That a failure to curb budget deficits and its protectionist war with China could cause a sharp jump in long-range interest rates and prevent a smooth and damage-free resolution of the problem.
[01:37:43.001 --> 01:37:50.509]  And he went on to say, protectionist moves and protectionist actions could cause serious economic downturn.
[01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:52.331]  Protectionist?
[01:37:54.221 --> 01:37:58.183]  Folks, in the last 20 years, we've almost shut down every industry in this country.
[01:37:58.583 --> 01:38:10.268]  Even the service industry is beginning to retract its primary outlays, and even some sectors of it are closing down, or reducing their size, or their investitures.
[01:38:11.829 --> 01:38:12.969]  I mean, do I have to look?
[01:38:13.069 --> 01:38:13.889]  I know you're smart.
[01:38:13.969 --> 01:38:15.170]  We've got a very smart audience.
[01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:23.411]  And I know trying to talk to your neighbors who are experts on baseball, or experts on fishing, or experts on acting cool, or experts on golfing.
[01:38:23.651 --> 01:38:25.191]  It's not even that the public's dumb.
[01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:27.772]  They're totally not focused on real issues.
[01:38:29.173 --> 01:38:36.915]  Or, even the guy who reads the newspaper every morning, who thinks he's real smart, doesn't know 101 about real economics because he's been given a bunch of bull.
[01:38:37.755 --> 01:38:43.456]  Just let me give you the... For those yuppies out there listening for the first time, let me just explain something to you.
[01:38:44.037 --> 01:38:45.537]  I don't have that high a view of myself.
[01:38:47.708 --> 01:38:58.204]  And so that makes me really get depressed when I know that I am light years in my basic understanding of economics to what unbelievable bull
[01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:00.043]  This statement is.
[01:39:00.243 --> 01:39:01.063]  The Greenspan made.
[01:39:01.424 --> 01:39:05.646]  You understand, folks, we are the exact opposite of a protectionist society.
[01:39:05.947 --> 01:39:09.009]  Globalization has battered us to pieces.
[01:39:09.529 --> 01:39:10.550]  We are wide open.
[01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:11.370]  We are hemorrhaging.
[01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:12.931]  Our economy is dying.
[01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:19.876]  So the Federal Reserve just puts more opiates, more painkiller into our bloodstream.
[01:39:20.643 --> 01:39:27.527]  It's like they're harvesting our organs in slow motion while we're wide awake, but to soothe us, they're pumping morphine into us.
[01:39:27.907 --> 01:39:28.928]  And what's the morphine?
[01:39:29.388 --> 01:39:45.417]  They've opened new mints, new mint factories, literally, it's even admitted on the History Channel, I saw a documentary a few years ago about it, they admitted what we already knew, but it was incredible to see them admit it, that literally the printing presses are going 24 hours a day, almost smoking.
[01:39:45.857 --> 01:39:48.779]  There's so much paper money spewing out of them.
[01:39:50.091 --> 01:39:50.811]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:39:51.291 --> 01:40:02.115]  It's just that at only 3% of actual paper currency to the numbers in the computers.
[01:40:02.375 --> 01:40:08.017]  That is, there's 3% or less actual paper money to just what's in the banks.
[01:40:08.077 --> 01:40:11.418]  That's not counting derivatives and hedge funds and advantage.
[01:40:13.622 --> 01:40:14.443]  Astronomical.
[01:40:14.503 --> 01:40:20.048]  But for money in the bank, for zeros and ones in computer banks, there's only 3% cash.
[01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:25.854]  And that's what the printing press is literally about to catch on fire.
[01:40:25.874 --> 01:40:27.495]  Just shooting money out.
[01:40:29.057 --> 01:40:33.361]  Paul Watson, your parents had to leave England.
[01:40:34.022 --> 01:40:38.526]  Up there in Sheffield, one of the most famous areas in the world for cutlery,
[01:40:39.907 --> 01:40:45.431]  I guess maybe only on the Rhine in Germany is a bigger area known for cutlery.
[01:40:45.992 --> 01:40:56.079]  Your parents, middle class folks, had to sell their house and had to move to France to try to run a service industry with the capital they had from their home sale.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.387]  And you've seen total economic implosion in England, but Greenspan says that we need to have more transfer of jobs.
[01:41:06.887 --> 01:41:07.468]  Factories, Paul.
[01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:10.001]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:10.041 --> 01:41:13.863]  I mean, there's no industry in Sheffield anymore, that's for sure.
[01:41:13.903 --> 01:41:22.266]  That's why my parents had to leave, because the last engineering jobs that were around were being shipped off to Czechoslovakia.
[01:41:22.586 --> 01:41:30.369]  With the houses, I've got relatives who 15, 20 years ago bought a house for £8,000, which is now worth £200,000.
[01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:40.986]  And they've been fear-mongering for three or four years now that the escalation in house prices would lead to a bust.
[01:41:41.106 --> 01:41:41.586]  It hasn't.
[01:41:42.146 --> 01:41:43.687]  It's just slowed down a little bit.
[01:41:43.707 --> 01:41:44.727]  There's been no bust.
[01:41:44.967 --> 01:41:53.729]  But at a point, they're going to pop that, buy them for pennies on the dollar, come in, and there's talk of making you pay off the full note at the original value.
[01:41:55.389 --> 01:41:55.689]  Yeah.
[01:41:55.949 --> 01:42:02.271]  I mean, hopefully it doesn't get to a point like it is in India, where the banks and the loan companies
[01:42:03.087 --> 01:42:08.790]  have hired criminals to torture people who've taken out loans into paying the loans back.
[01:42:09.771 --> 01:42:12.472]  Yeah, that's a mainstream big Indian newspaper today.
[01:42:12.492 --> 01:42:21.097]  And, you know, with eminent domain where the government can just take your land without even giving you any money for it in some cases.
[01:42:21.477 --> 01:42:28.801]  Yeah, clearly, for economic reasons, clearly the new bankruptcy laws, they're getting everything set up nicely, Paul.
[01:42:30.782 --> 01:42:31.663]  Well, yeah, so I mean,
[01:42:32.424 --> 01:42:36.726]  They're fear-mongering about so many different things, you don't know which ones to take at face value.
[01:42:37.947 --> 01:42:51.994]  Well, I know Greenspan's never used words like crash before, but I mean, the nerve to say this is happening to us because of protectionists, I mean, that is just unbelievable, Paul.
[01:42:54.015 --> 01:42:56.716]  Well, you know, black is white, night is day.
[01:42:57.017 --> 01:42:59.498]  They do this kind of thing all the time in their rhetoric.
[01:43:00.157 --> 01:43:03.178]  When the reality of the situation is diametric opposite.
[01:43:05.219 --> 01:43:06.320]  I've been gone for a week.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.521]  First vacation in forever.
[01:43:08.941 --> 01:43:14.744]  Actually, the first 7 day vacation or 5 day vacation since I started in talk radio over 10 years ago.
[01:43:14.904 --> 01:43:16.464]  But I'm back Paul.
[01:43:16.745 --> 01:43:24.288]  What do you think is most important to talk about for the listeners that have been listening to guest talk show hosts or refeeds last week?
[01:43:25.828 --> 01:43:29.876]  Well, um, we need to update on air the de Menezes story.
[01:43:30.396 --> 01:43:37.670]  The man, innocent man who was assassinated by British Special Police the day after the 21st of July failed.
[01:43:38.377 --> 01:43:39.238]  London bombings.
[01:43:57.209 --> 01:44:10.474]  But all that's come out now, but it ties in, Paul, with Iraq, where the new puppet president, they kill another Reuters cameraman, wound the other, and then say, we don't apologize, this is just how things work.
[01:44:10.874 --> 01:44:18.737]  And now the cops here act like that when they kill innocent people, so we have a new standard, Paul, where when they kill us for no reason, it's, we don't apologize!
[01:44:20.118 --> 01:44:23.719]  Well yeah, I mean, that might have been one of the reasons for doing it.
[01:44:24.515 --> 01:44:28.657]  Um, obviously they knew he was innocent before shooting him now 11 times.
[01:44:29.197 --> 01:44:31.799]  Oh, I'm gonna... tell us the developments.
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:39.903]  Well, the branch that was involved, SO19, trained in Israel, is renowned for carrying out political assassinations.
[01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:42.088]  And the police knew he was innocent.
[01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:49.720]  The police source stated there is no way those three guys would have been on the train carriage with him if they believed he was carrying a bomb.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:53.606]  Nothing he did gave the surveillance team the impression that he was carrying a device.
[01:44:54.006 --> 01:44:56.550]  Yeah, now it turns out they just walked up to him and killed him.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.541]  Yeah, so you can look at it two ways.
[01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:02.942]  Either he was killed because he had damaging knowledge about the bombings.
[01:45:02.982 --> 01:45:12.507]  Remember, he was a freelance electrician and that could have been connected to the power surge explanation that went out for an hour after the bombing.
[01:45:13.027 --> 01:45:22.311]  On top of that, obviously, two separate witnesses at two different bomb locations described an electrical surge and then the explosions coming up from under the trains.
[01:45:22.391 --> 01:45:24.152]  No guys with backpacks involved.
[01:45:25.007 --> 01:45:28.168]  Um, so could he have been involved in manufacturing that electrical device?
[01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:33.050]  Well, we know the globalists hire Latin Americans to play the part of Muslim terrorists.
[01:45:33.531 --> 01:45:35.091]  We know this going back 20 years.
[01:45:36.672 --> 01:45:39.453]  So that's all I can say is he looks like a military type.
[01:45:39.473 --> 01:45:44.015]  You know, the haircut, the musculature, just the whole look.
[01:45:44.155 --> 01:45:48.437]  Day one when I saw him, alarm bells went off, and then all this fits in place.
[01:45:50.071 --> 01:45:55.975]  But his death has sent a message to the British public that the state can gun down anyone in cold blood at any time.
[01:45:55.995 --> 01:46:08.702]  Whatever the reason, certainly the circumstances of the death have been subject to this intense cover-up, which has miserably failed because they've got this police source on the inside leaking information.
[01:46:09.183 --> 01:46:10.724]  So now they want to prosecute him?
[01:46:11.424 --> 01:46:19.049]  So first the police came out and said that, surprise surprise, none of the cameras that would have caught the incident on tape were working that day.
[01:46:19.733 --> 01:46:23.635]  The tube officials came back and said that they were working on that day.
[01:46:23.655 --> 01:46:28.758]  And of course the same thing happened with all the other bombings and with the bus bomb.
[01:46:29.779 --> 01:46:32.441]  Yeah, so then the police came... And by the way, Paul, we went to that very spot.
[01:46:32.461 --> 01:46:34.102]  There's cameras all over the place.
[01:46:34.262 --> 01:46:34.682]  We were there.
[01:46:36.163 --> 01:46:44.608]  Yeah, so the police came back and said they had removed the camera tape to study them after the July 21st failed bombings.
[01:46:44.628 --> 01:46:46.589]  So, I mean, what?
[01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:48.370]  They can't put a new tape in a camera?
[01:46:48.891 --> 01:46:55.797]  But then, they came back and flip-flopped again and said there was no footage of the shooting because the tape or the camera was faulty.
[01:46:56.277 --> 01:46:59.039]  So they're changing their reasons from one minute to the next.
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:04.684]  So then it gets in the news and some pointed questions start being asked.
[01:47:05.644 --> 01:47:09.567]  And then the police come out and say, abracadabra, we found the tape.
[01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:16.253]  But unfortunately, you'll be surprised to know, certain segments have been erased by accident.
[01:47:17.774 --> 01:47:33.781]  It's always the same, it's just... It's the most blatant... But it's admitted that the police chief, Blair, no relation to the Prime Minister, it's admitted that Ian Blair came right out and told them to cover it up!
[01:47:33.841 --> 01:47:34.922]  He should be in jail!
[01:47:35.322 --> 01:47:44.066]  Yeah, before he then went on the news and said it was directly related to anti-terrorist operations, when he already knew they'd shot an innocent man.
[01:47:44.626 --> 01:47:47.027]  So then he went out and blamed an innocent man they'd murdered,
[01:47:48.358 --> 01:47:51.100]  Uh, with being involved, which truly probably was.
[01:47:52.381 --> 01:48:00.927]  So they know for sure that these tapes, which have been mysteriously erased, um, others say they've got, still got them, so it's all up in the air.
[01:48:01.307 --> 01:48:13.356]  But I mean, they know they show the innocent man in the denim jacket, we've got a photo of it, running for a train, not vaulting the barrier, um, then calmly sitting down before being brutally murdered.
[01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:18.934]  So every detail of that tape will prove that the police lied on every point of the original story.
[01:48:18.954 --> 01:48:20.635]  Plus there's the 11 times.
[01:48:22.516 --> 01:48:31.782]  Originally it was 5 from a witness who was connected to the Metropolitan Police who also said he was wearing a heavy jacket with bomb wires coming out of it.
[01:48:32.402 --> 01:48:34.923]  Completely fabricated witness statements.
[01:48:36.283 --> 01:48:41.367]  The Brazilian delegation was told all this, but they went home saying there was no cover-up.
[01:48:41.447 --> 01:48:43.448]  Brazilian government's one of the most corrupt in the world.
[01:48:44.009 --> 01:48:47.652]  So they don't want riots at home to deal with, so they've shut up about it.
[01:48:48.232 --> 01:48:57.599]  They tried to pay off the Menezes family half a million dollars before any kind of investigation had even started for them to keep their mouths shut.
[01:48:58.650 --> 01:49:09.295]  Um, and as I wrote, you know, isn't it cute when the overwhelming benefits of CCTV is rammed down our throats whenever they catch a bad guy, but... But in every case it malfunctions.
[01:49:09.355 --> 01:49:15.918]  Yeah, whenever the police get caught covering up their own criminal activities, the cameras mysteriously malfunction.
[01:49:16.058 --> 01:49:19.920]  And while we were in London, over and over again, they'd march over and say, turn your cameras off.
[01:49:21.337 --> 01:49:30.621]  That's right, at that very spot, Stockwell, we were filming a fruit stall and some floral tributes, and apparently that was some kind of threat, which they didn't want us to film.
[01:49:31.802 --> 01:49:33.443]  Well, it's okay.
[01:49:33.983 --> 01:49:36.944]  Paul, we've got a bunch of other issues to cover.
[01:49:37.004 --> 01:49:41.466]  Exploding oil prices, or as you say across the pond, petrol prices.
[01:49:42.627 --> 01:49:47.129]  And then we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this break.
[01:49:47.711 --> 01:49:49.412]  And we'll take your calls as well.
[01:49:49.552 --> 01:49:50.712]  Got a whole hour left!
[01:49:51.273 --> 01:49:52.613]  And now we're in some change.
[01:49:55.174 --> 01:49:58.115]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.776 --> 01:50:00.076]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:20.187 --> 01:50:24.831]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.931 --> 01:50:27.653]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.993 --> 01:50:31.175]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.

[01:53:00.883 --> 01:53:03.284]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:04.465 --> 01:53:04.605]  U.S.
[01:53:05.666 --> 01:53:09.609]  oil prices surged $4 to above $70 a barrel.
[01:53:09.809 --> 01:53:12.231]  Meanwhile, the Ayatollah over in
[01:53:21.983 --> 01:53:24.526]  Iran is attacking what he calls Police State Britain.
[01:53:25.026 --> 01:53:31.833]  Boy, you know stuff's bad when Police State Iran gets to point at our countries and call them a police state.
[01:53:32.894 --> 01:53:36.698]  I got several articles here about hawks and doves descend on Bush Ranch.
[01:53:37.819 --> 01:53:41.683]  Paul, have you read these articles yet where neocons have signs that say
[01:53:42.799 --> 01:53:48.924]  No war, no freedom, but the neocons only see the no war and physically start chasing and attacking their own minions?
[01:53:49.004 --> 01:53:54.427]  I mean, this is the frothing hatred that we have going on out at Crawford?
[01:53:55.728 --> 01:54:08.978]  Well, yeah, there's obviously a massive movement that's been mobilized amongst the neocons to attack Cindy Sheehan and label her as hating the troops and attacking the troops when
[01:54:10.164 --> 01:54:14.606]  She's attacking the person and the administration that sent them there to Dyson Austin for a life.
[01:54:15.306 --> 01:54:17.207]  So, that's in high gear at the moment.
[01:54:17.487 --> 01:54:25.590]  But a major cable channel will not even take her milk toast ad that says George Bush lied about WMDs.
[01:54:25.650 --> 01:54:31.153]  I mean, folks, they take political ads all the time that haven't been proven, but her claim has been proven.
[01:54:31.173 --> 01:54:37.275]  The administration admits no WMDs are there, but they go, no, that has not been proven and will not run her ad.
[01:54:37.315 --> 01:54:39.356]  I mean, now there's no free speech.
[01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:45.255]  Well, yeah, and again, it demolishes this myth of a liberal press.
[01:54:45.856 --> 01:54:52.644]  I mean, ABC News is owned by General Electric, who make the engines for fighter jets.
[01:54:53.064 --> 01:54:58.291]  Well, I mean, David Rockefeller owns a large portion of NBC, and defense contractors do as well.
[01:54:58.351 --> 01:54:58.952]  I mean, folks,
[01:54:59.838 --> 01:55:07.783]  They act like they're liberal, but because they want your guns and your property and all the rest of it, and Bush's Supreme Court goes along with all of it, it's totally staged!
[01:55:08.244 --> 01:55:11.966]  But again, it's this mindless fighting with each other, but they love to get going!
[01:55:13.027 --> 01:55:15.008]  Well, what I said about it in an article on...
[01:55:15.777 --> 01:55:25.463]  Monday was that you would get Democratic operatives, the kind of ones who jumped onto the Downing Street memo after that got big.
[01:55:25.803 --> 01:55:32.607]  Notice that soon disappeared when they had the meeting on Capitol Hill and it got whitewashed as a partisan issue.
[01:55:33.354 --> 01:55:41.862]  That disappeared off the radar, and now we learn that Democratic operatives are visiting Cindy Sheehan, giving her information.
[01:55:42.363 --> 01:55:51.051]  So that's what they're going to try and turn it into, a left-right distraction, to get her away from the key message, which has been successful so far.
[01:55:52.927 --> 01:55:56.989]  Well, exactly, and Martin Sheen's out there.
[01:55:57.029 --> 01:56:01.951]  You know, Martin Sheen didn't criticize Bill Clinton when he was attacking Serbia for no reason.
[01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:06.413]  And look, the point here is, and the neocons go, see?
[01:56:06.853 --> 01:56:07.193]  See?
[01:56:07.273 --> 01:56:08.194]  War's good!
[01:56:08.274 --> 01:56:09.354]  Bill Clinton's good!
[01:56:09.454 --> 01:56:09.814]  No!
[01:56:10.314 --> 01:56:11.235]  It's all bad!
[01:56:12.455 --> 01:56:15.757]  The globalists own both the parties, can't they?
[01:56:17.197 --> 01:56:18.318]  Can't they figure that out, Paul?
[01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:22.892]  No, because it's sold to them as a football match.
[01:56:23.753 --> 01:56:28.717]  Pick your team and never stop supporting them even if they're going through hard times.
[01:56:29.177 --> 01:56:34.401]  That's how it's sold to people and people buy it because it's so simple and so easy to buy into.
[01:56:34.681 --> 01:56:40.446]  Well, I think some people doubted me about how bad Crawford was when I did that report, but now, I mean, it's just everyday occurrences.
[01:56:41.471 --> 01:56:43.913]  Paul, we're going to take calls as soon as we start the next hour.
[01:56:43.933 --> 01:56:45.754]  I know you've got a lot of issues you want to talk about.
[01:56:45.794 --> 01:56:47.074]  I want to get into the bird flu.
[01:56:47.094 --> 01:56:51.297]  I mean, they're talking about open martial law now here and, of course, in England.
[01:56:51.897 --> 01:56:56.300]  The CFR is putting out reports talking about breakdown of world economies.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.781]  I mean, they're really fear-mongering.
[01:56:58.081 --> 01:56:59.342]  We're not the ones doing this.
[01:56:59.382 --> 01:56:59.842]  They are.
[01:57:00.803 --> 01:57:02.504]  And so we'll cover that as well.
[01:57:02.544 --> 01:57:04.305]  What are some of the other issues you want to cover, Paul?
[01:57:05.839 --> 01:57:13.582]  The Lockerbie CIA admission of planted evidence to frame people for terrorist attacks and more journalists being killed in Iraq.
[01:57:14.423 --> 01:57:21.486]  Oh, and it is, by the way, clear that the Lockerbie situation was another MI6 action.
[01:57:22.166 --> 01:57:26.207]  And we've even got MI5 agents now going public saying that and more evidence documenting it.
[01:57:26.748 --> 01:57:29.269]  So we'll cover that on the other side as well.
[01:57:29.329 --> 01:57:29.749]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.218 --> 01:57:39.125]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.427 --> 01:57:54.630]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:56.131]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.831 --> 01:57:57.852]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.412 --> 01:58:02.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.594 --> 01:58:06.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.917 --> 01:58:13.281]  Alright, my friends, we are now into this
[01:58:16.098 --> 01:58:19.940]  Third and final hour, the 29th day of August 2005.
[01:58:20.741 --> 01:58:23.702]  Good news on the hurricane, it did not hit.
[01:58:24.403 --> 01:58:26.704]  A direct hit of New Orleans, Louisiana.
[01:58:27.785 --> 01:58:30.786]  It's main body came ashore about 100 miles east of there.
[01:58:30.826 --> 01:58:32.827]  Still caused a lot of flooding and some serious problems.
[01:58:33.308 --> 01:58:35.189]  No deaths as of yet, thank God.
[01:58:35.889 --> 01:58:44.674]  Sometimes we have floods here in Texas, and 35 people die in one night, so... Very, very serious, but not in this case so far.
[01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:46.731]  Really dodged the bullet there.
[01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:56.997]  I just can't get over Greenspan saying we could have an economic crash because the housing market is too inflated, and then he blamed protectionism, protectionist policies.
[01:58:58.658 --> 01:59:01.159]  I mean, really, that is just unspeakable.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:08.984]  The individual guilty for so much of this, by devaluing the dollar with wild printing,
[01:59:10.384 --> 01:59:12.566]  And then grandstanding, you know, as the savior.
[01:59:13.106 --> 01:59:13.827]  Just so sick.
[01:59:13.847 --> 01:59:16.349]  You know, this basic equation is broken.
[01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:22.233]  Where the globalists carry out the policies in front of us that do this, and then pose as the saviors.
[01:59:22.273 --> 01:59:32.060]  And the public is so disconnected from the socio-economic, geo-political board, that they can't even be communicated with.
[01:59:33.581 --> 01:59:36.223]  I know we've got a load of phones, and I haven't been taking a lot of calls.
[01:59:36.423 --> 01:59:36.823]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:37.617 --> 01:59:40.980]  So we're going to move very quickly now, Paul Watson riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:53.289]  But right now, let's just real fast, Mike in New York, I mean real fast because you were already on, finish up, then Mike in Canada, Michael in Washington, and then Thomas and Bert and others.
[01:59:53.309 --> 01:59:54.389]  Go ahead Mike in New York.
[01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:57.852]  Thanks Alex, I'm just going to run through a bunch of bullets and then you can follow
[02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:00.350]  Yes.
[02:00:24.439 --> 02:00:26.301]  Backstabbing and selling us out.
[02:00:26.421 --> 02:00:32.045]  So Greenspan and isn't he also with Powell and Bush family knighted by the Queen of England?
[02:00:32.405 --> 02:00:34.127]  Yeah, totally, totally criminal.
[02:00:34.547 --> 02:00:39.130]  And then last, Alex, because this is what made me call when you were covering George Washington.
[02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.671]  I'm right in that area.
[02:00:40.712 --> 02:00:42.653]  He's been up and down my backyard.
[02:00:44.835 --> 02:00:47.977]  I live in the most historical place of the country where it all started.
[02:00:48.823 --> 02:00:51.625]  And we covered all the great stuff at Washington.
[02:00:51.645 --> 02:01:04.353]  Are you familiar with who they called the mysterious professor that appeared in the balcony in that inn when they were trying to determine on the draft of the Declaration of Independence whether or not that was the final draft.
[02:01:04.394 --> 02:01:05.214]  They were arguing.
[02:01:05.554 --> 02:01:07.416]  The war was imminently going to break out.
[02:01:07.796 --> 02:01:17.102]  And in heated debate all of a sudden a man, a mysterious figure, appears in the balcony and he makes a big oratory and at the end of it he says, God has decreed America to be free.
[02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:18.583]  Hurry up and sign that document.
[02:01:22.725 --> 02:01:23.725]  Yes, I'm familiar with it.
[02:01:23.745 --> 02:01:24.446]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:25.406 --> 02:01:28.367]  Paul, comments to what the listener was just saying?
[02:01:29.828 --> 02:01:31.049]  Oh, that's what you were telling me.
[02:01:31.829 --> 02:01:32.790]  I'm down here in Texas.
[02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:33.650]  They're up in Minnesota.
[02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:38.972]  They were telling me Paul's phone system cut out, so we're calling him back.
[02:01:41.634 --> 02:01:44.595]  Paul Watson, the listener again was bringing up
[02:01:45.165 --> 02:01:51.308]  I don't know how much of that you missed, but just the asinine nature of Greenspan saying protectionism.
[02:01:51.868 --> 02:01:54.029]  I know we're repeating this, but this is a big deal.
[02:01:54.609 --> 02:02:01.933]  Greenspan says the economy may basically fall apart, his words are crash, because we've been protectionist.
[02:02:01.993 --> 02:02:06.495]  I mean, that is... Paul, do you have words to describe it?
[02:02:08.136 --> 02:02:13.358]  Well, you remember the comments of that Bush staffer, um, we create reality.
[02:02:14.335 --> 02:02:18.758]  So in their own minds, they can believe it's true, because they created it, so it must be true.
[02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:22.040]  Well, that's what O'Brien, when he's torturing Winston, says.
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:23.001]  Exactly.
[02:02:23.021 --> 02:02:25.242]  I mean, he really believes it.
[02:02:25.322 --> 02:02:26.563]  I mean, we really make reality.
[02:02:28.244 --> 02:02:29.765]  Oh, these people are out of control.
[02:02:30.726 --> 02:02:33.888]  And then when they do pull the rug out, they'll dance around as our saviors.
[02:02:33.928 --> 02:02:36.030]  I mean, it's just so, so sick!
[02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:43.154]  We'll be right back, and we'll go straight to, uh... We'll go straight to, uh... All your calls.
[02:02:43.174 --> 02:02:43.955]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:02:47.225 --> 02:02:50.107]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.347 --> 02:02:51.929]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.269 --> 02:02:56.932]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.273 --> 02:03:04.018]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.338 --> 02:03:06.319]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.362]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.462 --> 02:03:14.125]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.325 --> 02:03:18.728]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.968 --> 02:03:26.193]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.453 --> 02:03:28.895]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:42.892 --> 02:04:43.093]  Call 880-344-38.
[02:04:46.662 --> 02:04:53.165]  I love the new sandal style, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:57.406]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:04:57.666 --> 02:04:59.827]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:05:00.167 --> 02:05:07.210]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:10.131]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:05:10.392 --> 02:05:13.873]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:22.057]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:22.437 --> 02:05:23.957]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:24.218 --> 02:05:36.123]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[02:05:36.603 --> 02:05:38.904]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:39.304 --> 02:05:44.707]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:46.388 --> 02:05:48.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:52.010]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.510 --> 02:06:01.274]  Alright, let's hurry through these calls.
[02:06:01.395 --> 02:06:04.276]  Let's go ahead and go to
[02:06:06.232 --> 02:06:07.792]  Michael in Canada.
[02:06:07.812 --> 02:06:08.433]  You're on the air.
[02:06:08.493 --> 02:06:09.413]  Welcome.
[02:06:09.453 --> 02:06:09.713]  Hello.
[02:06:09.753 --> 02:06:10.253]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:10.613 --> 02:06:11.313]  Thanks for calling.
[02:06:11.573 --> 02:06:11.753]  Yeah.
[02:06:12.013 --> 02:06:12.253]  All right.
[02:06:12.273 --> 02:06:12.733]  Well, thank you.
[02:06:13.474 --> 02:06:17.674]  Yeah, I called because I'm running for the Green Party in my constituency next election.
[02:06:17.795 --> 02:06:25.096]  Not because I particularly agree with their platform or anything, but because we really need to start standing up and speaking out.
[02:06:26.216 --> 02:06:29.757]  Just average people like you're doing right now and like I'm trying to do.
[02:06:31.297 --> 02:06:33.538]  We're going to basically lose all of our sovereignty up here.
[02:06:35.034 --> 02:07:01.452]  I'm not sure if you heard about what happened to Mark Emery, who's the big pro-pot advocate up here, but he got arrested and he's going to be extradited to the states very shortly for selling marijuana seeds, which is, it's okay to do that up here, but they against the law to do that down there, so... Sir, I turned on News 8 one day here locally, Tom Warner has local news here, and they were swearing in our local police, I think it was like 15 of them, as international cops,
[02:07:02.743 --> 02:07:16.770]  And then it showed them swearing in Japanese simultaneously to come over here, and they've openly got twenty-something percent of the military is now Latin American, and they're hiring foreign Latin American troops, and that's all mainstream news.
[02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:28.776]  Now and finally in ABC News, we've been talking about it for a full year, people couldn't believe it, we got Mexican commandos killing people 600 plus all over Texas, and we've got
[02:07:29.685 --> 02:07:35.209]  Your own Canadian papers admit you're going under the Union of American States, the American Union.
[02:07:35.729 --> 02:07:41.193]  The average American, you tell them that, they begin giggling at you like they're... Well, there's not a better term, folks.
[02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:41.713]  Retarded.
[02:07:41.734 --> 02:07:48.999]  I mean, just gibbering idiots is the only... And it's so sad that... Exactly.
[02:07:49.059 --> 02:07:49.679]  No, no, listen.
[02:07:50.019 --> 02:07:50.360]  Look, look.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:53.702]  Six years ago, I saw stuff where a white supremacist
[02:07:54.763 --> 02:07:57.489]  Uh, said that 6 million Jews didn't die.
[02:07:57.950 --> 02:08:04.726]  Now whether 10 million Jews died or a million Jews died, you know, whether I agree with that or not...
[02:08:06.033 --> 02:08:15.337]  People should have a right to say what they want, but no, under German law, the FBI arrested him and flew an American citizen to Germany where he is still in jail.
[02:08:15.617 --> 02:08:23.000]  Oh yeah, that's happening right now up here to a guy named Ernest Zundel, who by all means, I don't agree with the guy, but this is like what happened to Galileo.
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:26.101]  Galileo just happened to be right, this guy just happens to be wrong.
[02:08:26.681 --> 02:08:34.464]  But it's the same thing, you know, you charge a person with heresy for disagreeing with what the church has said is, you know, sun revolves around the earth, that's the way it goes.
[02:08:34.825 --> 02:08:35.585]  You disagree with that?
[02:08:36.232 --> 02:08:37.875]  We're gonna hang it.
[02:08:37.975 --> 02:08:41.120]  Well, I mean, Hitler was really bad, and a lot of bad things.
[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:48.893]  The problem is the Soviets wrote a lot of lies about the Nazis, and so those have been discredited.
[02:08:48.913 --> 02:08:50.195]  A lot of exaggerations.
[02:08:51.287 --> 02:09:00.437]  And so then people try to say the whole story isn't true when, uh, yeah, folks, Hitler was bad news and did kill a bunch of people, a lot of them Jews.
[02:09:01.798 --> 02:09:08.745]  And so, but exactly, regardless of whether Zundel is wrong or right, that guy is now in a German jail cell.
[02:09:09.446 --> 02:09:11.688]  Oh yeah, well, yeah, he's going to be extradited there.
[02:09:11.708 --> 02:09:14.130]  He's been here, like, in Canada since the fifties.
[02:09:15.491 --> 02:09:17.173]  Well, then he moved to Tennessee.
[02:09:17.213 --> 02:09:18.654]  No, no, he's now in Germany.
[02:09:19.014 --> 02:09:19.855]  Oh, he is?
[02:09:19.875 --> 02:09:21.216]  They finally extradited him, yeah.
[02:09:23.838 --> 02:09:27.461]  And by the way, Zungel stuff is mild, folks.
[02:09:28.822 --> 02:09:31.264]  It is mild compared to some of the revisionists.
[02:09:31.905 --> 02:09:34.687]  But again, it's illegal to write revisionist history.
[02:09:34.727 --> 02:09:35.548]  That's our new freedom.
[02:09:36.593 --> 02:10:03.454]  Oh yeah, we've got some anti, quote, anti-genocide laws up here where you can't advocate for the killing of someone based upon their race and stuff like that, which, I mean, I don't agree with people advocating that, but... Well, see, that's how they got it put through on the surface, but now, David Icke tries to fly into town four years ago, and he believes space aliens control us, and they came and arrested him and said, well, we believe space aliens code for Jews.
[02:10:03.954 --> 02:10:06.316]  And David Icke said, no, no, I really think they're space aliens.
[02:10:07.254 --> 02:10:26.507]  And again, I totally disagree with David Icke that space aliens are running things, but, you know what, it's David Icke's right to say that, but see, they even extrapolate, well look, I've got ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center documents that are, I've got their training manuals for police, where they say talking bad about the Federal Reserve is code for Jews and you should be arrested.
[02:10:26.887 --> 02:10:29.209]  Paul Watson comments on what this caller is talking about.
[02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:32.473]  Well, yeah, I mean, what is revisionist history?
[02:10:32.553 --> 02:10:34.394]  It's anything the government wants it to be.
[02:10:34.955 --> 02:10:38.657]  It's disagreeing with the official version of an event.
[02:10:39.258 --> 02:10:56.610]  So, with the new legislation being passed in the wake of the London bombings, the government says that supporting via websites or written media terrorist attacks, which basically can be defined as anything on top of that interacting with websites is included in the legislation,
[02:10:58.411 --> 02:11:01.632]  It's subject to you being investigated on the grounds of terrorism.
[02:11:01.912 --> 02:11:05.992]  So that revisionist history can and will be included in that definition.
[02:11:06.052 --> 02:11:15.494]  But to go back to the heart of what Mike in Canada brought up, that you've got somebody who just sells legal marijuana seeds, our government doesn't like it.
[02:11:16.474 --> 02:11:25.016]  So, by the way, Washington, one of his big farms was hemp, and he did grow the variety, George Washington did smoke it.
[02:11:25.755 --> 02:11:26.376]  I don't smoke it.
[02:11:26.436 --> 02:11:27.016]  I don't like it.
[02:11:27.477 --> 02:11:28.938]  I have smoked it, you know, in college.
[02:11:28.978 --> 02:11:29.379]  I tried it.
[02:11:29.399 --> 02:11:29.939]  I don't like it.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.061]  I did smoke it.
[02:11:32.081 --> 02:11:34.643]  I didn't inhale, but I don't... I used to be a big pot smoker.
[02:11:34.663 --> 02:11:36.285]  I used to smoke, like, six joints a day.
[02:11:36.465 --> 02:11:40.769]  I don't now, but, like, when I was living out in Vancouver, that's, like, the pot capital of the world.
[02:11:40.809 --> 02:11:43.772]  The point is, you shouldn't go to jail for it, and alcohol is much worse.
[02:11:44.272 --> 02:11:45.133]  Yeah, basically.
[02:11:45.153 --> 02:11:48.216]  Alcohol will turn your liver into a bowling ball.
[02:11:48.843 --> 02:11:54.368]  Yeah, and this is also propping up organizations like the Mafia and Hell's Angels and giving them funds.
[02:11:54.448 --> 02:11:57.331]  Which is why the bankers made drugs illegal to begin with.
[02:11:57.371 --> 02:12:00.394]  They just lost alcohol prohibition, so they created a new one.
[02:12:01.654 --> 02:12:05.397]  Drug use tripled, and crime gangs tripled, everything triples.
[02:12:05.937 --> 02:12:14.403]  But I mean, going back to what you said, whether it's a pot dealer, or whether it is somebody who writes a history you don't like, none of us are safe!
[02:12:14.443 --> 02:12:25.790]  I mean, I go back to Robin Page, mainstream BBC reporter, rural affairs reporter, says, rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:27.892]  Didn't even criticize homosexuals.
[02:12:29.133 --> 02:12:29.813]  We interviewed him.
[02:12:29.953 --> 02:12:31.134]  He was arrested.
[02:12:32.409 --> 02:12:38.291]  Because Scotland Yard Diversity Unit said that they deemed the use of the word homosexual to be hateful.
[02:12:39.972 --> 02:12:56.177]  Yeah, well, it was like in Saskatoon about two years ago, this one native leader of a band, David Henneckew, he was really drunk making a speech and made some comment about how the Jews owned Germany before Nazi Germany came in.
[02:12:56.677 --> 02:12:59.578]  Anyway, this reporter asked him about it and he said the Jewish people were a disease.
[02:13:00.419 --> 02:13:03.542]  And he got charged under our anti-hate legislation for that.
[02:13:03.582 --> 02:13:06.565]  He's one of the first people to really get charged.
[02:13:08.107 --> 02:13:17.856]  There was a big publicity show here about that because this guy was like the top leader of Native bands in Canada and Native people up here are like 10% of the population.
[02:13:19.197 --> 02:13:24.803]  And like basically Native people up here are kind of like black people down there for like the amount of
[02:13:25.535 --> 02:13:28.316]  Basically, racism there is against that group.
[02:13:28.576 --> 02:13:29.436]  No, I understand.
[02:13:29.456 --> 02:13:31.497]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:31.677 --> 02:13:40.919]  Look, and again, folks, you should be more afraid of a government that can arrest you for saying something than you are even if you disagree with the group.
[02:13:40.999 --> 02:13:43.940]  I mean, I don't like the Ku Klux Klan of the Aryan Nations.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.201]  In fact, look at their... A lot of websites out there attack me.
[02:13:47.721 --> 02:13:48.301]  They don't like me.
[02:13:49.081 --> 02:13:50.782]  And then also the ADL doesn't like me.
[02:13:50.822 --> 02:13:52.082]  That's because they're two peas in a pod.
[02:13:52.102 --> 02:13:52.562]  We've caught
[02:13:53.257 --> 02:13:56.178]  ADL front groups creating white supremacist groups.
[02:13:57.098 --> 02:13:58.439]  You know, time and time again.
[02:13:59.539 --> 02:14:03.720]  So this is how these people operate.
[02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:06.261]  But it's a lot worse than that now, folks.
[02:14:06.301 --> 02:14:10.562]  I mean, in Europe, if you criticize the EU, you get arrested.
[02:14:10.602 --> 02:14:12.603]  I mean, we have mainstream articles.
[02:14:14.704 --> 02:14:21.646]  You've got that BBC story where headline 100 homes rated an anti-hate sweep.
[02:14:22.418 --> 02:14:29.599]  And it says that most of the people were arrested and put in front of their children because a neighbor heard them use the racist term.
[02:14:30.179 --> 02:14:33.140]  Now, I don't like the racist term for black people.
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:36.280]  W is how it starts.
[02:14:37.821 --> 02:14:43.842]  But I feel like I should say it just because we have to have the right to say this stuff.
[02:14:45.082 --> 02:14:45.822]  Paul comments.
[02:14:47.202 --> 02:14:51.483]  Well, yeah, when all these rap stars say it in every song they release, do they get arrested?
[02:14:51.543 --> 02:14:51.663]  No.
[02:14:52.705 --> 02:14:56.046]  And it's this idea of being force-fed tolerance.
[02:14:57.507 --> 02:14:59.127]  Tolerance of homosexuality.
[02:14:59.667 --> 02:15:04.529]  But then, those advocating that cannot tolerate any criticism of it.
[02:15:04.809 --> 02:15:10.291]  To the point where you get preachers in Canada going to jail for quoting Bible passages.
[02:15:10.311 --> 02:15:12.632]  Oh, we have it in Philadelphia, reading from the Bible.
[02:15:12.652 --> 02:15:14.532]  You were arrested and faced 47 years.
[02:15:15.292 --> 02:15:17.273]  The Philadelphia Daily News, folks.
[02:15:17.293 --> 02:15:19.914]  Yeah, there's no tolerance for that.
[02:15:22.546 --> 02:15:24.287]  Well, that's what free speech means to them.
[02:15:24.467 --> 02:15:29.050]  So the neocons are all... Listen, I hear Limbaugh, Weiner, Nona Savage, all of them.
[02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:31.512]  You'd be arrested for this in World War II.
[02:15:31.572 --> 02:15:32.953]  You shouldn't be allowed to talk like that.
[02:15:33.153 --> 02:15:34.434]  Every day they're saying it.
[02:15:34.974 --> 02:15:37.416]  They... See, and that's how the globalists control us.
[02:15:37.456 --> 02:15:40.658]  Through the phony right wing, they ban all the liberal speech.
[02:15:40.698 --> 02:15:45.001]  Through the phony left wing, they ban all conservative speech.
[02:15:45.321 --> 02:15:46.902]  Hence, all speech is banned.
[02:15:49.798 --> 02:15:51.280]  Yeah, so there's very little left.
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:52.421]  It's a vice.
[02:15:53.522 --> 02:15:55.083]  It's a pretty nice little system, Paul.
[02:15:55.804 --> 02:15:56.365]  Exactly.
[02:15:56.725 --> 02:15:58.246]  It's about creating thought criminals.
[02:15:59.468 --> 02:16:02.331]  Well, let's take another here.
[02:16:02.411 --> 02:16:03.432]  Michael in Washington.
[02:16:03.452 --> 02:16:04.032]  You're on the air.
[02:16:04.092 --> 02:16:04.513]  Go ahead.
[02:16:05.153 --> 02:16:05.994]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:16:06.154 --> 02:16:06.415]  Good.
[02:16:06.635 --> 02:16:07.356]  Good to have you back.
[02:16:09.201 --> 02:16:15.003]  I just wanted to comment a little bit on, well, in Great Britain, at least their cameras malfunction.
[02:16:15.103 --> 02:16:18.805]  Here, they just stick out their tongues and go, national security.
[02:16:19.965 --> 02:16:21.546]  And last night, I was listening to the news.
[02:16:21.586 --> 02:16:25.327]  I don't watch TV, my girlfriend does, but I get so much more just hearing it.
[02:16:25.648 --> 02:16:28.789]  And FEMA demanded the police must start talking English.
[02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:31.690]  No more 10-4, no more 10-20s.
[02:16:33.231 --> 02:16:38.973]  And that's probably to get all the illegal aliens that are going to be taking over the cop jobs to where they can understand them.
[02:16:40.208 --> 02:16:48.334]  And also I was listening and they kept fear-mongering this thing in this hurricane.
[02:16:49.074 --> 02:16:51.215]  And over and over and over and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[02:16:51.436 --> 02:16:52.296]  FEMA will save us!
[02:16:52.316 --> 02:16:53.137]  FEMA loves you!
[02:16:53.177 --> 02:16:53.917]  FEMA is good!
[02:16:53.937 --> 02:16:55.138]  Thank God for FEMA!
[02:16:55.158 --> 02:16:57.119]  What would we do without our federal handlers?
[02:16:57.399 --> 02:17:03.243]  And this morning I was listening to the Power Hour and Joyce said that she was just shocked.
[02:17:03.263 --> 02:17:04.684]  She heard this the night before.
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:26.625]  I didn't catch the newscast, but Bush did this speech, and she played it on the air, and they said, Dave said he looked like a deer caught in the headlights, it was just a picture of him, and then this garbled voice that sounded like it was a short band or marine radio talking, and then the announcer came on and goes, well, the military doesn't really set up phone lines very well.
[02:17:26.946 --> 02:17:27.966]  And she said, the military?
[02:17:28.026 --> 02:17:29.146]  I didn't know they were in Crawford.
[02:17:29.386 --> 02:17:32.427]  Well, I just called Dennis Kline, who's in
[02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:40.934]  The movie with Lorraine Murray, they're both down there in Crawford, and I said, they're good friends of mine, I said, is the military down there?
[02:17:41.495 --> 02:17:44.240]  And he told me they just flew Bush out in two helicopters.

[02:20:47.873 --> 02:20:50.315]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[02:20:50.535 --> 02:20:53.338]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[02:20:53.678 --> 02:20:57.701]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[02:20:57.941 --> 02:21:07.229]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname, Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[02:21:07.529 --> 02:21:12.451]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[02:21:12.731 --> 02:21:23.876]  Loaded with Xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and sleep.
[02:21:23.916 --> 02:21:24.696]  So much more.
[02:21:24.916 --> 02:21:30.958]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:37.180]  Call now 800-625-2890.
[02:21:51.187 --> 02:22:09.402]  We're going to go to Thomas in Illinois, and Martin, Texas, and Mark in Missouri, and Mike in Illinois, and many, many others here in a minute or so, but... Paul Watson, at the start of the broadcast, I was talking about Russ Limbaugh.
[02:22:09.482 --> 02:22:19.731]  I heard a rebroadcast Sunday, yesterday, saying that our troops, two of our troops, were viciously attacked by a mob
[02:22:21.872 --> 02:22:31.096]  And he went on for like 30 minutes by a mob of a peace activist outside of a restaurant and almost killed.
[02:22:32.376 --> 02:22:40.639]  So I got home and I looked up the video and all the news articles and it was gang members at a gang member type bar who got in a fight with two soldiers who were in plain clothes.
[02:22:40.779 --> 02:22:46.942]  And no one ever said it was because they were troops, no one ever claimed it was because they threw a hot dog at the gang member types.
[02:22:47.842 --> 02:22:55.724]  And I mean, just to have Limbaugh just openly lying and saying peaceniks are now attacking troops.
[02:22:56.264 --> 02:23:02.606]  No wonder out at Camp Crawford they're like piranhas even assaulting their own Bush supporters.
[02:23:03.886 --> 02:23:05.966]  Again, at the top of the sign says, no war.
[02:23:07.107 --> 02:23:08.847]  And under it, no freedom, but it doesn't matter.
[02:23:08.867 --> 02:23:09.947]  People don't see that part.
[02:23:10.607 --> 02:23:12.328]  And grabbing the crosses again.
[02:23:12.388 --> 02:23:17.229]  I mean, is this a willful craziness, Paul?
[02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:20.361]  Well, it is, yeah.
[02:23:20.581 --> 02:23:23.283]  I mean, on Limbaugh's part, he does that kind of thing every day.
[02:23:23.784 --> 02:23:42.540]  He came out with absolutely no evidence, no follow-up, no retraction, said that the Downing Street memos were leaked by somebody connected to the CBS Rathergate scandal, because he remembered the same name being connected to the Rathergate scandal, and the name was Michael Smith.
[02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:46.203]  You'd really remember that name, it's very different.
[02:23:47.364 --> 02:23:47.624]  And then,
[02:23:48.607 --> 02:23:49.808]  With Cindy Sheehan.
[02:23:49.828 --> 02:23:51.790]  I mean, take this for example.
[02:23:52.611 --> 02:23:56.695]  Cindy Sheehan says, when I get up to heaven, he's going to say, good job, mom.
[02:23:57.015 --> 02:23:59.438]  Talking about her son, Casey Sheehan.
[02:24:00.178 --> 02:24:06.585]  So, will Netdaily write an article which says that Cindy Sheehan channels the dead?
[02:24:08.246 --> 02:24:11.990]  How obvious is that as a quite pathetic smear attempt?
[02:24:12.774 --> 02:24:14.876]  So that's what you get from New York Times.
[02:24:14.936 --> 02:24:19.401]  And by the way, folks, if we just wanted to get hits, we could write headlines like that and get them all day.
[02:24:20.863 --> 02:24:24.727]  But, I mean, World Net Daily is just getting less and less credibility.
[02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:28.711]  Let's take a call.
[02:24:28.731 --> 02:24:29.732]  I'm just so sick of it.
[02:24:29.992 --> 02:24:34.377]  And imagine all these liberals who, if you're reasonable and if you talk to them,
[02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:42.593]  And if you're anti-war, you can convince them the Second Amendment's good, you can convince them that big corporations use government to steal.
[02:24:43.013 --> 02:24:44.574]  They'll get the real paradigm!
[02:24:44.834 --> 02:24:46.234]  But no one's ever told them!
[02:24:46.454 --> 02:24:47.695]  No one's ever talked to them!
[02:24:47.915 --> 02:24:59.340]  They see Republicans as people screaming that they want to kill them, with their kids dressed up in uniforms, pointing toy machine guns at them, running over crosses like piranhas attacking their own people.
[02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.161]  That's what they see!
[02:25:03.781 --> 02:25:04.402]  Well, exactly.
[02:25:04.442 --> 02:25:04.942]  I mean, it's like
[02:25:05.575 --> 02:25:19.804]  When Pat Robertson calls for the assassination of Chavez, people see that as an example of Christianity, and they see Christianity as being advocated by a bunch of walking hypocrites, so they say, if that's God, I want nothing to do with it.
[02:25:19.824 --> 02:25:26.709]  Meanwhile, you know, he's saying abortion's doing what they gotta do in China, and he owns, you know, five million dollar race horses, and...
[02:25:28.839 --> 02:25:33.443]  And then he uses his non-profit system to sell a shake and say it's of the Lord.
[02:25:33.723 --> 02:25:34.604]  Now it's going private.
[02:25:34.824 --> 02:25:37.206]  Then Limbaugh said that was bad too, to criticize him.
[02:25:37.426 --> 02:25:38.647]  People were against free market.
[02:25:38.928 --> 02:25:40.049]  It's not that, folks.
[02:25:40.369 --> 02:25:42.370]  Christ went into the temple with the money changers.
[02:25:43.031 --> 02:25:45.893]  Pastors aren't supposed to be selling miracle shakes.
[02:25:48.115 --> 02:25:48.736]  Sorry, Paul.
[02:25:48.756 --> 02:25:51.458]  Go ahead.
[02:25:51.518 --> 02:25:52.559]  On the Pat Robertson thing,
[02:25:53.664 --> 02:26:00.469]  After that, Fox News had a bunch of former CIA agents on and said that basically, yeah, they agree with him.
[02:26:00.809 --> 02:26:04.151]  We should go out and assassinate every leader who doesn't cooperate.
[02:26:05.312 --> 02:26:12.497]  And Chavez, he's an evil communist, that's why he took state-owned land, seized by US-controlled governments, and gave it back to the people.
[02:26:13.203 --> 02:26:19.347]  Hundreds of thousands of acres here, 50 for you, 100 for you, just giving it to the poor indigenous populations here.
[02:26:19.367 --> 02:26:20.568]  It's yours, take it.
[02:26:20.928 --> 02:26:31.075]  Meanwhile, our government, our Republican, the Democrats, most of the Democrats voted against the land grab, but our good Republican jurists, why, they say that we can take your private property.
[02:26:32.136 --> 02:26:32.616]  Exactly.
[02:26:32.757 --> 02:26:35.538]  Because they're fighting commies, Paul.
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:39.041]  Brian, I mean, even
[02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:45.074]  Bad dictators, if they don't cooperate with the globalists, then they are taken out.
[02:26:45.154 --> 02:26:47.176]  It's all about the non-integrating states.
[02:26:47.216 --> 02:26:50.799]  That is the same with no angel, but he wasn't cooperating.
[02:26:50.859 --> 02:26:53.101]  Exactly, but they can point to it and go, well, look, he's bad.
[02:26:53.161 --> 02:26:54.522]  Yeah, our government put him in there.
[02:26:54.802 --> 02:26:59.126]  But the point is, whether they're good, bad, or indifferent, or ugly, or polka-dotted, they're sovereign.
[02:26:59.146 --> 02:27:00.266]  That's why they're being taken out.
[02:27:00.286 --> 02:27:01.087]  Right.
[02:27:01.107 --> 02:27:06.892]  I mean, Chavez is certainly not, you know, a pure-driven snow lily.
[02:27:09.739 --> 02:27:11.081]  He does come from poor roots.
[02:27:11.141 --> 02:27:13.703]  He is just an indigenous himself, and he's sick of it.
[02:27:15.505 --> 02:27:18.328]  And again, Chavez isn't up here trying to take my liberties, folks.
[02:27:18.929 --> 02:27:22.773]  And he's giving people private property taken by our public governments in the past.
[02:27:24.014 --> 02:27:25.155]  I don't know what you call that.
[02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:27.418]  The government divesting land?
[02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:30.921]  Oh, that's communism, yeah, sure.
[02:27:30.941 --> 02:27:32.343]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.643 --> 02:27:39.644]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.564 --> 02:27:43.325]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.486 --> 02:27:50.087]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:51.208]  Look no further!
[02:27:51.508 --> 02:27:54.089]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:27:54.509 --> 02:28:03.012]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:28:03.172 --> 02:28:04.292]  You can order everything you need
[02:28:04.292 --> 02:28:04.492]  We're good.
[02:28:20.486 --> 02:28:21.146]  We're good.
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:51.505]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:28:51.805 --> 02:28:57.250]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:57.290 --> 02:29:01.574]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.914 --> 02:29:04.937]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:05.257 --> 02:29:08.680]  So effective you can drink raw untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:18.365]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.605 --> 02:29:22.127]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.367 --> 02:29:29.451]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:46.633 --> 02:29:49.436]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:29:49.556 --> 02:29:54.622]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:29:54.842 --> 02:30:01.029]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:30:01.290 --> 02:30:06.936]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:30:07.196 --> 02:30:12.700]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:16.783]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:30:16.803 --> 02:30:23.087]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:30:23.107 --> 02:30:24.208]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:24.248 --> 02:30:28.931]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[02:30:29.091 --> 02:30:33.274]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[02:30:33.494 --> 02:30:36.376]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[02:30:36.576 --> 02:30:40.820]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:42.481]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.357 --> 02:31:04.778]  I got a little Daily Show clip that would be funny if it wasn't so sad.
[02:31:04.798 --> 02:31:05.479]  I don't want to play.
[02:31:05.499 --> 02:31:07.380]  Of course, a lot of phone lines here.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:10.881]  And a big stack of news like this.
[02:31:11.001 --> 02:31:11.341]  U.S.
[02:31:11.421 --> 02:31:14.683]  establishment helped empower Chinese police state.
[02:31:14.703 --> 02:31:16.623]  Taiwan news.
[02:31:17.404 --> 02:31:19.505]  I guess they're just evil commies in Taiwan, though.
[02:31:19.705 --> 02:31:20.505]  You know how they are.
[02:31:20.825 --> 02:31:22.426]  Fighting the good freedom lovers.
[02:31:23.046 --> 02:31:25.167]  And the Chinese, uh, what do you call them?
[02:31:26.077 --> 02:31:46.863]  Former Police Chief Says Lockerbie Evidence Faked CIA Planted Timer to Frame Libyan US Sniper Kills Reuters Cameraman and Wounds the Other Assistant India Banks Hire Criminals Torturers to Recover Loans and the President over in India is talking about it now.
[02:31:47.664 --> 02:31:49.044]  Ah, hiring torturers, it's part of freedom.
[02:31:49.833 --> 02:31:55.356]  A Halliburton critic is demoted in the Army Corps of Engineers for criticizing corrupt Halliburton practices.
[02:31:55.376 --> 02:31:56.837]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:31:57.257 --> 02:32:00.379]  Militarized police storm Utah rave beat partygoers.
[02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:02.620]  I've seen the video.
[02:32:03.121 --> 02:32:04.481]  There's regular military with them.
[02:32:05.422 --> 02:32:05.962]  And a U.S.
[02:32:06.022 --> 02:32:08.744]  Army commander warns blogs are security risk.
[02:32:10.104 --> 02:32:10.845]  Evil blogs.
[02:32:10.865 --> 02:32:11.785]  Gotta do something about those.
[02:32:12.786 --> 02:32:16.228]  And of course, Paul, I want to go to Thomas and others right now, though, but
[02:32:17.370 --> 02:32:26.975]  Over in England, they're saying only the elite, only the Queen and BBC reporters and others, 2% of the population, get a special vaccine to fight the bird flu and the pills.
[02:32:27.755 --> 02:32:30.737]  So that creates kind of that run on the stores.
[02:32:30.997 --> 02:32:32.357]  We've got to have it if it's coming.
[02:32:33.578 --> 02:32:40.221]  The CFR in their August-September issue, bi-monthly issue, three articles saying we will be hit by it.
[02:32:40.821 --> 02:32:45.764]  It could just basically end modern civilization, destroy the economies,
[02:32:46.736 --> 02:32:49.277]  Don't worry, they've got a martial law plan to keep you safe.
[02:32:50.037 --> 02:32:51.898]  They like to brag before they do something.
[02:32:51.978 --> 02:33:00.881]  I hope this is just more fear-mongering, but now to have your country bracing for martial law for your safety, though, Paul, your comments on it.
[02:33:02.622 --> 02:33:07.264]  Well, yeah, I mean, they were saying the same thing about SARS in 2003.
[02:33:08.124 --> 02:33:08.945]  Nothing happened.
[02:33:09.685 --> 02:33:14.687]  Certainly if it did, take China as the example, where they, um,
[02:33:16.135 --> 02:33:21.441]  Imposed curfews, even killed people, kept people in home detention.
[02:33:21.921 --> 02:33:24.484]  I mean it would be a good trigger to do that kind of thing.
[02:33:24.924 --> 02:33:25.645]  But then you look at...
[02:33:27.279 --> 02:33:39.803]  Um, the Spanish Flu, for example, whereby they're transporting it between different labs at biosafety levels way below those... Now this is a flu that killed conservatively 50 million people.
[02:33:40.263 --> 02:33:50.526]  Our government digs it up out of the dead whaler, buried in the permafrost, ships it all over the country and the world, and now is saying, ooh, make it released, and see, that's an excuse to let her release it.
[02:33:50.686 --> 02:33:51.786]  But they're not worried about that one.
[02:33:52.826 --> 02:33:53.487]  No, exactly.
[02:33:53.547 --> 02:33:54.647]  So they're running around with it.
[02:33:55.638 --> 02:33:59.820]  Um, no security safeguards whatsoever, and then saying that it's going to happen.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.181]  Thousands of labs that didn't ask for it get it.
[02:34:05.222 --> 02:34:17.226]  Meanwhile, something that's killed like a hundred people, oh, it's just, our lives are over, better take the new vaccine, and they admit the people that gave the vaccine weren't even in an area affected, so they don't know that it's good for the bird flu.
[02:34:17.946 --> 02:34:23.188]  It's just, it's like when they admitted the smallpox shot would not protect you from smallpox.
[02:34:24.369 --> 02:34:24.829]  Remember that?
[02:34:25.979 --> 02:34:29.541]  Yeah, and what was it, 99.9% said no anyway.
[02:34:29.661 --> 02:34:31.802]  Oh, the police and military, yeah.
[02:34:33.322 --> 02:34:35.323]  Look, this is totally petty, but I'm going to talk about it.
[02:34:35.763 --> 02:34:37.824]  I told you folks about Lance Armstrong.
[02:34:38.744 --> 02:34:45.948]  And why are we criticizing him for some blood-doping, you know, type steroid that makes you grow more blood, basically?
[02:34:46.828 --> 02:34:48.609]  Why are we all freaking out about that?
[02:34:49.169 --> 02:34:52.290]  You know, if it's true or not, and obviously it's, you know, they got him.
[02:34:53.531 --> 02:34:53.791]  Listen.
[02:34:54.685 --> 02:34:55.766]  Why do we care about that?
[02:34:55.886 --> 02:34:57.808]  We've got him on Nike.
[02:34:58.969 --> 02:35:00.590]  Nike owns slave camps.
[02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:02.131]  Nike uses little kids.
[02:35:02.692 --> 02:35:03.693]  It's very evil.
[02:35:04.833 --> 02:35:06.595]  I've been boycotting them for ten years, folks.
[02:35:06.635 --> 02:35:09.878]  It's not like some new thing I just started doing because I don't like Lance Armstrong.
[02:35:11.059 --> 02:35:12.860]  I just, the guy radiates evil.
[02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:14.301]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you folks.
[02:35:14.321 --> 02:35:16.063]  You know I got a good sense about folks.
[02:35:16.603 --> 02:35:19.045]  And I just, I go off hunches.
[02:35:19.786 --> 02:35:23.609]  I go off, 99% is facts, but I just always had a bad feeling about Armstrong.
[02:35:24.093 --> 02:35:25.774]  I haven't really been following that, to be honest.
[02:35:49.443 --> 02:35:53.665]  It's just he's really an aggressive, arrogant, domineering, control freak, folks.
[02:35:54.105 --> 02:35:55.026]  And he's gotta be stopped.
[02:35:57.187 --> 02:36:04.150]  I mean, he's getting into politics, and that's why I'm coming out against him, so... If you like Armstrong and you don't like it... Here's another thing, too.
[02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:06.371]  People are like, I don't care if he's on drugs!
[02:36:07.191 --> 02:36:08.932]  When I was on vacation, I don't care!
[02:36:08.952 --> 02:36:09.912]  He's my hero!
[02:36:09.952 --> 02:36:11.233]  Don't take my hero!
[02:36:11.832 --> 02:36:15.095]  And I'm like, why is your hero Michael Jordan or Lance Armstrong?
[02:36:15.475 --> 02:36:17.817]  Why isn't it a firefighter that goes into a burning building?
[02:36:18.237 --> 02:36:24.542]  Why isn't it your great-grandmother when your grandfather died that worked three jobs to raise your grandparents?
[02:36:26.724 --> 02:36:28.825]  Why isn't your hero George Washington?
[02:36:29.826 --> 02:36:33.209]  Do people know how the troops walked through the snow leaving a trail of blood?
[02:36:33.229 --> 02:36:35.751]  By the way, that is because they had no shoes.
[02:36:35.811 --> 02:36:37.132]  That's the British histories.
[02:36:38.253 --> 02:36:39.874]  Do they know about everything we went through?
[02:36:41.647 --> 02:36:47.050]  No, people don't know about, you know, 6,000 troops facing 40,000 troops?
[02:36:48.831 --> 02:36:49.672]  No, you don't know.
[02:36:49.692 --> 02:36:52.593]  Lance Armstrong is a piece of filth.
[02:36:53.073 --> 02:36:53.974]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:36:55.295 --> 02:36:57.576]  Number one, these people shouldn't be our heroes.
[02:36:58.376 --> 02:36:59.357]  Any comments on that, Paul?
[02:37:00.718 --> 02:37:06.461]  Well, I mean, they pumped them up to be larger than life, so people put them on a pedestal and then think that they're
[02:37:07.157 --> 02:37:12.920]  Angels, and they can't make any mistakes, so when they do, they just ignore it and don't believe it.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.761]  Well, I can look at people making mistakes.
[02:37:15.781 --> 02:37:18.722]  That's why I haven't attacked Jordan or Tiger Woods.
[02:37:19.602 --> 02:37:22.043]  I mean, I've mentioned it for, you know, having Nike contracts.
[02:37:22.104 --> 02:37:28.006]  I mean, here they are, you know, the progeny of slaves, and they're literally making money off slaves.
[02:37:28.666 --> 02:37:29.687]  And we just put up with it.
[02:37:29.747 --> 02:37:32.448]  But Lance Armstrong, he wants power.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:38.523]  I mean, the minute Michael Jordan sought politics, I would be against him, because he's shown very bad judgment.
[02:37:39.484 --> 02:37:44.487]  The minute Tiger Woods tries to get into politics, I'll come out against him, but... Alright.
[02:37:45.227 --> 02:37:46.588]  Let's just go to Thomas in Illinois.
[02:37:46.628 --> 02:37:47.489]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[02:37:47.529 --> 02:37:47.909]  Go ahead.
[02:37:48.489 --> 02:37:48.890]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:49.450]  How's it going?
[02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.750]  Good.
[02:37:50.411 --> 02:37:51.271]  Hey, uh, listen.
[02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:56.654]  Uh, what's the story behind Stu Wett and why he's slamming you on his website?
[02:37:57.695 --> 02:37:59.616]  I'm not aware of that, and I appreciate the call.
[02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:00.577]  Uh, take care.
[02:38:00.817 --> 02:38:02.038]  All I've said on air is
[02:38:03.033 --> 02:38:10.155]  Uh, is that... Somebody asked me about what I thought about what he says and I said I don't agree with it.
[02:38:11.275 --> 02:38:14.536]  So, now, I am the second coming of Satan.
[02:38:15.296 --> 02:38:18.657]  You know, I am the goblin of hell itself.
[02:38:19.577 --> 02:38:20.757]  I'm sure is what you're saying.
[02:38:20.777 --> 02:38:21.837]  I haven't seen it, never.
[02:38:22.417 --> 02:38:25.158]  Also, sir, there is a tactic, okay?
[02:38:27.032 --> 02:38:28.033]  Use by people.
[02:38:28.093 --> 02:38:29.174]  And I'm not talking about him.
[02:38:29.214 --> 02:38:29.714]  I haven't seen him.
[02:38:29.734 --> 02:38:30.194]  I don't care.
[02:38:30.735 --> 02:38:35.158]  There is a tactic used by people where they don't have an advertising budget.
[02:38:36.158 --> 02:38:41.342]  And so instead of writing articles and coming up with good info and doing research and traveling and working hard.
[02:38:42.403 --> 02:38:45.505]  Also, number one, people are envious of those that work hard.
[02:38:46.085 --> 02:38:46.926]  It's the old thing of
[02:38:48.436 --> 02:39:03.826]  You've got 100 acres and your neighbor's only got 50, but you're sure he's got better land than you because he's got money, and he's building a bigger barn, and he's got more pigs than you do, and more cows, just because he's a cheater.
[02:39:04.727 --> 02:39:05.748]  He's doing something.
[02:39:05.788 --> 02:39:07.049]  He's bad.
[02:39:07.769 --> 02:39:10.571]  Folks, I work fighting the New World Order 18 hours a day.
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:12.280]  Okay?
[02:39:12.741 --> 02:39:19.966]  And so there's a lot of people that wonder why our websites are pretty big and people tell them, oh, have you heard of Alex Jones?
[02:39:19.986 --> 02:39:20.967]  Have you heard of Paul Watson?
[02:39:21.367 --> 02:39:24.849]  And because some of these people are egomaniacs, that just burns them!
[02:39:25.730 --> 02:39:30.473]  I love it when I'm out in the street in some foreign city and people walk up, hey, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[02:39:30.513 --> 02:39:33.756]  Hey, I also like, you know, this person, that person.
[02:39:33.816 --> 02:39:34.436]  I go, good!
[02:39:34.496 --> 02:39:38.059]  I mean, it means to me that, you know, I think it's good when I hear that
[02:39:39.508 --> 02:39:45.113]  You know, some other patriot or some freedom lover's got a new book out that's sold, you know, a whole bunch of copies.
[02:39:45.453 --> 02:39:46.754]  I go, wow, great!
[02:39:46.814 --> 02:39:55.102]  The people, you know, I mean, I have hundreds... Also, what I do is I watch people for a long time before I have them on as guests.
[02:39:55.642 --> 02:39:57.984]  Over the years, and people say, well, why won't you have me on?
[02:39:58.024 --> 02:39:59.806]  Well, I'm not done watching you.
[02:40:00.507 --> 02:40:02.190]  And a lot of these people, I know all about them.
[02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:13.367]  But the point is, if I sat here and spent my show attacking other people who were just little nobodies, then my whole show would be about that instead of all this important news.
[02:40:13.667 --> 02:40:14.789]  Paul Watson, comments.
[02:40:16.215 --> 02:40:21.680]  Well, they attack us for the very simple reason that it gets them attention and it gets them hits.
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:23.361]  It's a cheap marketing plan.
[02:40:23.401 --> 02:40:32.949]  If we respond, and by the way folks, myself and others have responded to some detractors in the past, and they'll still say, they will not respond.
[02:40:33.549 --> 02:40:34.610]  They will not respond.
[02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:39.194]  You can send a response and they'll go, ha ha, you bastard, we're not going to put it up.
[02:40:39.974 --> 02:40:42.937]  So a lot of these folks are paid, and I don't mean the person you mentioned,
[02:40:43.675 --> 02:40:44.937]  A lot of these people are paid.
[02:40:46.338 --> 02:40:51.845]  Again, reading about the Revolutionary War, which, by the way, about 40% of the British were against.
[02:40:52.406 --> 02:40:57.692]  Edmund Burke and Mr. Fox and so many people over there, they eloquently spoke out against it.
[02:41:00.357 --> 02:41:04.038]  But even at that time, the British main operation wasn't just their military.
[02:41:04.358 --> 02:41:09.100]  They had paid spies everywhere, even generals in Washington's army.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:15.182]  It's debatable whether Lee was, but it's pretty clear he was, running around trying to defeat Washington.
[02:41:16.082 --> 02:41:16.462]  Okay?
[02:41:16.962 --> 02:41:18.723]  And so you've got this going on.
[02:41:19.263 --> 02:41:19.863]  Comments, Paul?
[02:41:21.083 --> 02:41:24.784]  Well, wasn't Ben Franklin also involved?
[02:41:24.804 --> 02:41:26.385]  Well, he retired in England.
[02:41:26.425 --> 02:41:28.105]  It's been totally proven he was a British agent.
[02:41:28.406 --> 02:41:29.826]  With the Hellfire Club and the
[02:41:30.592 --> 02:41:33.433]  Sacrificing bodies under his house.
[02:41:33.473 --> 02:41:35.873]  That's Times of London, by the way, if you don't believe it.
[02:41:37.634 --> 02:41:41.174]  No, I mean, we get attacked for being too commercial and selling things.
[02:41:42.355 --> 02:41:45.575]  So they attackers get lots of hits and sell things.
[02:41:45.935 --> 02:41:48.936]  So it let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
[02:41:50.656 --> 02:41:54.697]  But again, we've done 2 hours and 44 minutes and 9 seconds.
[02:41:55.117 --> 02:41:56.758]  And I have not yet plugged my videos.
[02:41:57.198 --> 02:41:57.698]  I should!
[02:41:59.597 --> 02:42:03.080]  But frankly, I'm as sick of talking about them as you're as sick of hearing about them, folks.
[02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:04.221]  I just wish you'd buy them.
[02:42:04.522 --> 02:42:06.924]  We're gonna go quickly to Bart and Mark and Mike here in a second.
[02:42:07.805 --> 02:42:08.526]  But I gotta say this.
[02:42:09.006 --> 02:42:11.408]  If I... People say, well, you don't respond.
[02:42:12.169 --> 02:42:14.812]  I have responded to stuff a hundred times.
[02:42:15.152 --> 02:42:16.153]  A hundred.
[02:42:16.393 --> 02:42:20.317]  But when I respond, the people attacking me never put my response.
[02:42:21.218 --> 02:42:21.598]  Okay?
[02:42:22.079 --> 02:42:24.481]  And so what happens is it just sits out there
[02:42:25.416 --> 02:42:29.858]  You know, this stuff that's been said about me by the ADL or by the, you know, whoever.
[02:42:30.639 --> 02:42:35.461]  He just sits there, like I never said the Mexican culture was the most evil thing on Earth.
[02:42:35.881 --> 02:42:38.763]  I said the Aztec culture was evil, like the Nazis.
[02:42:39.543 --> 02:42:41.384]  Now, do I have to sue the ADL?
[02:42:42.466 --> 02:42:44.987]  I think there's a lot of things about the Mexican culture that I love.
[02:42:45.487 --> 02:42:46.707]  They're very pro-family.
[02:42:47.588 --> 02:42:48.828]  They're very into the earth.
[02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:53.430]  Frankly, it's a strong male household, which I think is important.
[02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:56.071]  I never said the Mexican culture was evil.
[02:42:57.531 --> 02:42:59.832]  See, I mean, you know, but I cannot respond.
[02:42:59.892 --> 02:43:02.113]  I get emails every week about that ADL article.
[02:43:02.293 --> 02:43:06.894]  I cannot spend my life responding to the ADL or their pimps.
[02:43:08.235 --> 02:43:08.515]  Okay?
[02:43:08.555 --> 02:43:09.655]  I mean, I just cannot do it.
[02:43:09.975 --> 02:43:11.856]  Let's play this little three minute piece.
[02:43:13.519 --> 02:43:17.561]  From last week's, one of the better shows from the Daily Show.
[02:43:17.581 --> 02:43:20.863]  Go ahead and roll that, we'll come back and take some more calls.
[02:43:20.903 --> 02:43:21.323]  Here it is.
[02:43:21.743 --> 02:43:26.285]  We're going to begin tonight with more on our victory in Iraq.
[02:43:27.766 --> 02:43:35.050]  In Iraq, it's just past its two year mark, and the victory there is growing increasingly glorious.
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:48.544]  So the President is launching a brand new defensive over Iraq, hitting the road in response to criticism on the weekend's news talk shows from the usual band of peacenecks, like Nebraska Republican Senator Chuck Hagel.
[02:43:50.264 --> 02:43:54.306]  Any measurement, any standard you apply to this, we're not winning.
[02:43:54.406 --> 02:43:56.526]  Now, what's the definition of not winning?
[02:43:57.447 --> 02:44:04.169]  I think if you could just, for example, say that you could secure the road from the Baghdad airport to downtown Baghdad,
[02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:14.230]  Oh my God.
[02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:27.192]  We've gone from promising to democratize the Middle East to hoping to secure a quick ride to the airport.
[02:44:28.833 --> 02:44:32.693]  Now, a political scandal obviously can't be taken seriously until it gets a gate.
[02:44:33.193 --> 02:44:36.254]  Well, there's a similar test for foreign policy fiascos.
[02:44:36.634 --> 02:44:42.775]  We are locked into a bogged down problem, not unsimilar, dissimilar to where we were in Vietnam.
[02:44:43.399 --> 02:44:45.240]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
[02:44:46.261 --> 02:44:48.343]  Now it's a problem, now it's a problem.
[02:44:49.103 --> 02:44:50.764]  It's in a frustrated Vietnam.
[02:44:51.985 --> 02:44:54.727]  Could we stop comparing intractable conflicts to me?
[02:44:56.829 --> 02:44:57.729]  I mean, I've moved on.
[02:44:57.769 --> 02:44:59.771]  Hello, thriving sex trade.
[02:45:02.733 --> 02:45:06.816]  But Virginia Republican George Allen vehemently refuted Hagel.
[02:45:07.651 --> 02:45:09.953]  It's a big difference from Vietnam.
[02:45:10.013 --> 02:45:14.996]  The Vietnamese, our opposition there had, it was communist, but nevertheless, there was a philosophy.
[02:45:15.397 --> 02:45:16.638]  There was an organization.
[02:45:16.678 --> 02:45:18.739]  There was a government, so to speak.
[02:45:18.799 --> 02:45:20.320]  It was North Vietnam.
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:23.002]  Here, the terrorists don't have any government.
[02:45:23.062 --> 02:45:26.144]  They are just there to wreak havoc, to intimidate.
[02:45:26.264 --> 02:45:26.585]  See?
[02:45:26.845 --> 02:45:27.766]  It's not Vietnam!
[02:45:27.786 --> 02:45:31.268]  In Vietnam, we had, you know, someone to attack and negotiate with.
[02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:36.512]  This is worse.
[02:45:37.972 --> 02:45:42.115]  But if Iraq isn't like Vietnam, what country can it be compared to, Mr. Allen?
[02:45:42.375 --> 02:45:51.202]  Of the Iraqi military, the army and security forces we're training up are actually many of them still loyal to their parties, still loyal to their militias, and it's not a national army.
[02:45:51.843 --> 02:45:52.563]  Well, that's true.
[02:45:53.064 --> 02:45:55.485]  And you have that even in our United States.
[02:45:55.525 --> 02:45:57.447]  We have local police, we have state police.
[02:46:02.631 --> 02:46:05.213]  See, Iraqi militias are like the local police.
[02:46:06.886 --> 02:46:08.006]  Muqtada al-Sadr?
[02:46:08.226 --> 02:46:09.347]  He's their boss hog.
[02:46:12.067 --> 02:46:25.210]  So, he's a nice gentleman.
[02:46:26.531 --> 02:46:32.872]  Meanwhile, while his Iraq policy is coming under fire from his own party, President Bush was in a field of poppy.
[02:46:34.210 --> 02:46:39.014]  Going on a two-hour bike ride with seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong.
[02:46:39.094 --> 02:46:42.657]  Now, the president is riding his bike a lot.
[02:46:42.697 --> 02:46:44.078]  He's jogging five miles a day.
[02:46:44.118 --> 02:46:45.039]  He's lifting weights.
[02:46:47.421 --> 02:46:49.482]  Is he preparing for something we don't know about?
[02:46:51.024 --> 02:46:54.887]  Some kind of, I don't know, every-man-for-himself scenario?
[02:46:56.047 --> 02:46:56.907]  Coming down to the fight.
[02:46:57.168 --> 02:46:58.628]  I must be stronger for sure.
[02:46:58.988 --> 02:47:00.549]  I would have to fend for myself.
[02:47:00.609 --> 02:47:01.329]  That's the end.
[02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:06.292]  I mean, it's just the insanity of the statements.
[02:47:07.152 --> 02:47:09.873]  And by the way, folks, we're meant to be talking about the war.
[02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.634]  We're meant to be diverted by all of this.
[02:47:13.515 --> 02:47:19.078]  In reality, this is all a smokescreen for the domestic police state and the looting going on here.
[02:47:21.239 --> 02:47:24.340]  This war is meant to fail, as I said a year before it started.
[02:47:25.163 --> 02:47:26.444]  It is meant to be a quagmire.
[02:47:26.464 --> 02:47:27.865]  It is meant to demonize America.
[02:47:27.925 --> 02:47:29.167]  It is meant to bring the U.N.
[02:47:29.227 --> 02:47:29.607]  in later.
[02:47:29.907 --> 02:47:32.630]  Paul, we've been on record all along saying what would happen.
[02:47:33.090 --> 02:47:34.892]  See, people just can't figure that out, though.
[02:47:35.152 --> 02:47:35.392]  Paul?
[02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:44.960]  Well, exactly, and that has happened in Afghanistan now, where the NATO troops are moving in, the American-British troops are moving out.
[02:47:46.942 --> 02:47:51.025]  Comparisons with Iraq and Vietnam, as we saw from Hagel.
[02:47:51.846 --> 02:47:52.687]  I mean, there's another.
[02:47:53.194 --> 02:48:00.020]  More journalists killed in Iraq since March 2003 than the entire number killed during Vietnam.
[02:48:01.201 --> 02:48:02.482]  And that's not by accident.
[02:48:03.363 --> 02:48:12.710]  No, it's like they have the CNN executive say they're killing journalists, then on purpose he says, I don't have any facts, when we have all the government's own admission, we're going to kill you!
[02:48:13.651 --> 02:48:20.497]  Yeah, the US ambassador to Iraq after this latest Reuters journalist was shot said, we don't target civilians.
[02:48:21.167 --> 02:48:29.549]  When that's the exact policy they said would be in place before the war, where they target independent journalists.
[02:48:29.589 --> 02:48:33.429]  Well, I mean, it's like the Pentagon says, we're going to lie to you, then they say, we don't lie.
[02:48:35.310 --> 02:48:39.331]  I mean, it's just, and then before congressional testimony, they go, oh yeah, we lied.
[02:48:39.791 --> 02:48:41.091]  Yeah, we told you we lied.
[02:48:41.791 --> 02:48:42.851]  We lied to you.
[02:48:43.371 --> 02:48:44.212]  We lied to you.
[02:48:44.252 --> 02:48:45.672]  We're telling you, we lied to you.
[02:48:47.276 --> 02:48:54.643]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.924 --> 02:48:59.668]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.888 --> 02:49:05.534]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.794 --> 02:49:10.296]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:10.516 --> 02:49:17.660]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:18.480]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:18.521 --> 02:49:22.242]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.382 --> 02:49:24.904]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:25.124 --> 02:49:31.887]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:51:47.077 --> 02:51:49.818]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.838 --> 02:51:53.700]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:58.062 --> 02:51:59.543]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:59.623 --> 02:52:02.924]  Bart in Texas, you're on the air, and then Mark in Missouri, and that's it.
[02:52:03.185 --> 02:52:04.025]  Bart, go ahead, sir.
[02:52:04.785 --> 02:52:14.250]  Alex, you know, what I wanted to talk about was, today I was sitting in class, and I was sitting behind a young lady that's a reservist, and was getting ready to complete her college credit so she can go to Iraq.
[02:52:15.279 --> 02:52:17.460]  And just how absolutely disturbing it was.
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:22.201]  I mean, I really have to say it made me want to vomit, listening to some of the things she was saying.
[02:52:22.221 --> 02:52:34.566]  You know, she was just bragging about how much she loved her weapon, and one of the statements she made was, you know, it really... I really don't care about them, but it just tears my heart out when one of our guys gets killed.
[02:52:35.446 --> 02:52:41.888]  And the whole... Look, look, she's not been in the real world, and if she's unlucky enough to get a leg blown off, she won't be laughing.
[02:52:42.779 --> 02:52:51.405]  Well, I don't understand how good Americans can view themselves as moral and upright, and then brandy about death.
[02:52:52.306 --> 02:52:56.428]  Well, that's the thing, is that our founding fathers didn't brandy about death.
[02:52:56.468 --> 02:52:58.390]  The British Redcoats did.
[02:52:58.770 --> 02:53:01.632]  They were the ones that were constantly giggling about murdering and slaughtering.
[02:53:02.439 --> 02:53:04.440]  And it's the same thing.
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:06.601]  Americans never have behaved like this.
[02:53:07.061 --> 02:53:08.462]  And we're not supposed to behave like this.
[02:53:08.482 --> 02:53:09.843]  Now we're the worst of the worst.
[02:53:10.583 --> 02:53:18.107]  And somebody who really knows how to use a weapon isn't slathering about how powerful it is and how they can't wait to use it.
[02:53:18.707 --> 02:53:22.351]  I mean, I've talked to a lot of old soldiers who won't talk about World War II or Vietnam.
[02:53:22.691 --> 02:53:28.657]  I mean, you kill somebody, it's nauseating to you, because you've got your instincts.
[02:53:28.737 --> 02:53:32.561]  You certainly don't brag about it and smack your lips, Paul Watson.
[02:53:33.642 --> 02:53:36.324]  Well, I talked to someone before the war started.
[02:53:36.404 --> 02:53:40.689]  I said, are you looking forward to killing Iraqi kids?
[02:53:41.289 --> 02:53:42.951]  And that person said, yes, I am.
[02:53:43.777 --> 02:53:51.021]  Well, there have been Reuters reporters who are standing there when they go, you just killed a child, and the Marines all scream, oh, oh, oh, yeah, we're going to kill more.
[02:53:51.041 --> 02:53:52.582]  It's like a five-year-old splattered.
[02:53:53.022 --> 02:53:53.922]  It's just, it's funny.
[02:53:54.163 --> 02:53:54.703]  But you know what?
[02:53:54.903 --> 02:53:57.725]  I mean, folks, God's universe will punish you.
[02:53:57.845 --> 02:53:58.545]  God's law.
[02:53:59.065 --> 02:54:06.149]  I mean, can you imagine if that Marines, they're going to come home and have kids, and they're going to wonder why they die of car wrecks, why they die of leukemia.
[02:54:06.589 --> 02:54:09.211]  And folks, I'm not trying to, you know, get into mumbo-jumbo here.
[02:54:09.491 --> 02:54:11.432]  This is how the universe operates.
[02:54:11.992 --> 02:54:14.495]  I mean, you don't just kill kids and laugh about it and get away with it.
[02:54:16.537 --> 02:54:17.318]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[02:54:18.499 --> 02:54:21.803]  Well, I've found the same rule applies to my life.
[02:54:21.863 --> 02:54:22.824]  You reap what you sow.
[02:54:22.904 --> 02:54:24.026]  It's pretty straightforward.
[02:54:24.066 --> 02:54:28.050]  And these people are going to suffer pain for these things they've done.
[02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:29.672]  It's just God's will.
[02:54:30.876 --> 02:54:31.456]  God's will.
[02:54:31.516 --> 02:54:32.456]  Thanks for the call, Bart.
[02:54:32.497 --> 02:54:34.537]  You can call back tomorrow with more of the story if you want.
[02:54:34.857 --> 02:54:36.238]  Mark in Missouri, last caller.
[02:54:36.278 --> 02:54:36.658]  Go ahead.
[02:54:36.678 --> 02:54:37.698]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:38.058 --> 02:54:38.338]  Hi.
[02:54:38.658 --> 02:54:39.659]  Thanks for all you're doing.
[02:54:40.059 --> 02:54:44.080]  Just wanted to say that it's just 13 days away from 9-1-1.
[02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:51.222]  And we have planned here a showing of your documentary, Martial Law, in Springfield, Missouri.
[02:54:51.662 --> 02:54:52.062]  Oh, good!
[02:54:52.482 --> 02:54:53.323]  On 9-11 and also on 9-29.
[02:54:53.343 --> 02:54:54.463]  Where are you showing it?
[02:54:58.405 --> 02:55:00.866]  At the Springfield Eight Theaters in Springfield, Missouri.
[02:55:02.667 --> 02:55:03.487]  Well, that's good!
[02:55:04.828 --> 02:55:05.908]  So, September 11th.
[02:55:05.948 --> 02:55:07.729]  What time is September 11th?
[02:55:07.769 --> 02:55:09.390]  The showing will be at 7 p.m.
[02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:15.313]  That's a Sunday night, and it'll also be showing on September the 29th at 7 p.m.
[02:55:16.253 --> 02:55:17.073]  Well, that's great!
[02:55:17.194 --> 02:55:17.734]  Anything else?
[02:55:18.834 --> 02:55:24.277]  In between, we're showing Beyond Treason at the same theater on September the 22nd.
[02:55:25.888 --> 02:55:26.368]  Oh, good!
[02:55:27.108 --> 02:55:29.249]  Now of course, I told you you could free a charge, Eric.
[02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:31.690]  Are Dave and Joyce charging the show theirs?
[02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:33.391]  Uh, no.
[02:55:33.411 --> 02:55:34.691]  Well, that's good of them.
[02:55:35.931 --> 02:55:37.972]  In fact, Joyce is coming to Beyond Treason.
[02:55:38.252 --> 02:55:39.653]  Well, that's going to be just wonderful.
[02:55:40.013 --> 02:55:40.533]  Anything else?
[02:55:40.713 --> 02:55:49.376]  There is a link on InfoWars.com that says Martial Law in Missouri if people want tickets to come to it.
[02:55:49.496 --> 02:55:50.336]  How does that work?
[02:55:50.736 --> 02:55:52.097]  I don't know how that was ever done.
[02:55:53.457 --> 02:55:54.898]  But listen, we're out of time, my friend.
[02:55:54.938 --> 02:55:55.318]  Take care.
[02:55:57.603 --> 02:56:00.324]  We will be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:00.404 --> 02:56:02.485]  I didn't plug the videos today, a few of the ads aired.
[02:56:03.126 --> 02:56:08.028]  They're great films, and if you want them, you need to get them.
[02:56:08.709 --> 02:56:13.751]  You need to get Marshall Law and other documentaries, you need to get them out to people.
[02:56:14.231 --> 02:56:19.134]  Because they're powerful, they wake people up, and they make this broadcast possible as well.
[02:56:19.154 --> 02:56:20.575]  I want to thank all those that have supported us.
[02:56:20.895 --> 02:56:22.236]  Paul, thanks for coming on, my friend.
[02:56:22.436 --> 02:56:22.976]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:23.456 --> 02:56:24.757]  He's got some big articles coming up later.
[02:56:26.650 --> 02:56:30.963]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
