[00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:06.316]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.037]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:09.858]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:11.319]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.040]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:21.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:25.568]  And it's Wednesday.
[00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:29.947]  The 21st day of December 2005.
[00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.469]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.850]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.772]  And yes, we're going to have wide open phones for the entire balance of the broadcast today.
[00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.994]  Kind of like the Washington Journal format you see on C-SPAN.
[00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:49.456]  Any news item, any story, any topic, any issue you want to bring up,
[00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:59.983]  Any piece of propaganda you wish to decipher, if you agree with me, if you have a question, if you disagree, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:15.058]  The mission statement of this broadcast is fighting tyranny, standing up to despotism, standing up to tyrants, standing up to bullies wherever we find them, whether they be street thugs,
[00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:20.340]  Or government thugs, criminals in high places, low places, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.146]  We're here to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution that simply point out our God-given, inherent, organic, natural law, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:36.788]  And the both parties are totally bought and paid for by the same global financial interest.
[00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.711]  They are openly destroying our standard of living and dismantling our once free and great nation.
[00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:52.858]  And on every front, the Republican and Democratic parties are executing the exact same programs of enslavement, of control, of surveillance.
[00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:58.021]  And then every time a Democrat gets caught doing something, oh, it's okay, because the Republicans are doing it, too.
[00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:03.904]  And every time a Republican gets caught doing something, it's okay, because the Democrats are doing it, too.
[00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:08.626]  That's like saying, because somebody else committed a murder, it's okay for you to commit a murder.
[00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.347]  It's weird psychology.
[00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:13.786]  I mean, we wrote articles weeks ago.
[00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:20.269]  We've written articles for years reporting on the fact that the government's been surveilling our everyday lives.
[00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.792]  And we predicted they'd come out in the neocon media and say, look, Bill Clinton's surveilled!
[00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:29.333]  It's okay!
[00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:37.737]  Paul Watson and I, Steve Watson, we all wrote articles last week and, what, another article on Monday covering this.
[00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:50.626]  And, uh, sure enough, now Newsmax and Worldnet Daily and, uh, why even the Associated Press and others are going, the New York Times, why Bill Clinton did it too!
[00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:53.668]  Well, that means it's okay!
[00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:57.610]  No, that shows it's even worse!
[00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.711]  Exactly!
[00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:58.871]  Exactly!
[00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:03.658]  All your cell phones are tracked.
[00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:04.860]  OnStar is tracked.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.651]  I just had the local FEMA Homeland Security head university professor on who's helping organize stuff in Knoxville.
[00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:29.143]  And I described their local emergency management center that every major city has, and even small towns have now, with the military, the police, the sheriff's department, local tattletale squads, tracking people in real time with cameras and cell phones, and he said, yeah, what you said's true.
[00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:30.823]  Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah, mm-hmm.
[00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:35.585]  Folks, you can forget, I mean, the government did this on purpose.
[00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:36.926]  Bush's approval rating has gone up.
[00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:40.487]  People didn't get that last week when I said, you watch, he's gonna get a bump out of this.
[00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:42.928]  And people said, that's ridiculous, Alex.
[00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:45.593]  See, no, it's not ridiculous.
[00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:56.097]  It's to grandstand, I'm only spying on a few of you for your safety, then we all get conditioned that spying means the government loves us and it was just foreigners calling America.
[00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:03.186]  And then you look at it, it's actually over 30,000 times, 18,000 times, and it was purely inside America.
[00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:04.766]  And folks, that's just what they're telling you about.
[00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:08.789]  That is not even the tip of the proverbial ice cube.
[00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.811]  It is not even the tip of the glacial structure, the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:13.692]  It is just so...
[00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:27.658]  It is declassified, admitted, not debatable that roving computers for at least 20 years have been roving every phone line, every radio transmission, every fax, every email.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.561]  Randomly out there.
[00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.583]  You've all had computers listening to you at one time or another.
[00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:34.844]  You're somebody like me.
[00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:41.328]  You've got actual analysts, actual warm bodies in the seat, assigned to, of course, myself, who sit there and listen.
[00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.088]  We already know that.
[00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.591]  Most of you, of course, have never even had an actual human listen to the recordings the NSA grabbed.
[00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.512]  And I'm just not going to put up with it.
[00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:49.693]  I mean, I'm sick.
[00:04:49.713 --> 00:04:50.954]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.970]  This is why we decried Bill Clinton.
[00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.992]  But does it make it okay because Bill Clinton did it?
[00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:58.633]  Oh, now it's okay if Bush does it?
[00:04:58.993 --> 00:04:59.693]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:05.256]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.218]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.418 --> 00:05:13.161]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.684]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.585]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:22.265]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.751]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:00.476]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.095]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:14.265]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:19.271]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:26.436]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:38.566]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:43.548]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:46.049]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:50.812 --> 00:06:51.852]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.498 --> 00:07:04.100]  Government is that which governs me.
[00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.963]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:06.403 --> 00:07:09.107]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:12.191]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:19.081]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.359]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:41.900]  Have you?
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.980]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:52.182]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:53.702]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:55.443]  Osama bin Ferdinand.
[00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:59.504]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:08.573]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.193 --> 00:08:12.234]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:26.996]  It is Wednesday, my friends, 21st day of December 2005.
[00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:27.876]  I want to get into all the
[00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:42.460]  New repercussions of the soap opera concerning Bush and the NSA and the Pentagon spying on the American people and all of the spin that's coming out of that.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.503]  I want to get into more torture revelations.
[00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:47.806]  There's also a lot of shockwaves developing.
[00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:56.221]  Where Vicente Fox is basically calling for political unrest and resistance by his dual citizenship population.
[00:08:56.661 --> 00:09:00.121]  What is it, 20 million plus dual citizens that are publicly U.S.
[00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:02.402]  citizens and Mexican citizens?
[00:09:02.462 --> 00:09:07.083]  And you've got another 30 plus million conservative illegal aliens who have had U.S.
[00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:14.804]  government-financed comic books, literally, given to them since they were young children, saying that America belongs to Mexico, the Southwest does.
[00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:17.445]  And so it's just all part of the plan.
[00:09:18.616 --> 00:09:22.319]  Bush is actively using his muscle in Mexico to try to bring down the U.S.
[00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:25.341]  I mean, that's always been his goal, and I'm not joking about this.
[00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:29.564]  We've had the former head of the Border Patrol Union on to say that, not the former, the current.
[00:09:30.064 --> 00:09:36.109]  We've had Glenn Spencer on, we've had Congressman on, we've had Tom Dancredo on talking about it.
[00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:39.111]  It is about global government, and that's what's happening.
[00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:42.994]  Right now, let's go ahead and
[00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:49.715]  Get into what's been going on with the NSA spying on the American people.
[00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:51.416]  And number one, let me just say this again.
[00:09:52.637 --> 00:10:06.683]  The National Security Agency, set up after the CIA was set up in the early 1950s, has been surveilling the American people in total for at least two decades.
[00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:11.065]  That doesn't mean you're always, you know, have a computer listening to your phone,
[00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:12.761]  Uh, for keywords.
[00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:17.063]  It doesn't mean that you always have your email being run through a filter.
[00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:27.887]  It doesn't mean that you always have your faxes being read, but on a routine basis, you are being run through these big filters.
[00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:29.988]  These data mining operations.
[00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:35.690]  Now, I remember ten years ago, and the reason I always talk about this is because this is the denial people are under.
[00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.053]  This has been declassified in the last 15 years or so.
[00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:42.515]  People don't even know the name of the NSA until about 15 years ago.
[00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:53.805]  I remember there are newspaper articles calling me a conspiracy theorist out there because you can find the articles, Alex Jones believes there's government agencies listening to the people.
[00:10:55.946 --> 00:11:02.812]  What's incredible about this is that it can be declassified, admitted, not debatable, and people still just say it isn't true.
[00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:06.757]  And then I just want to tell everybody about the NSA.
[00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:14.279]  Most of what the NSA and all these other groups and organizations, even above them, that we don't even know the names of, or at least I can't tell you I know the names of them.
[00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:17.360]  And what do they do?
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.340]  They're not looking for terrorists, folks.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.201]  Okay?
[00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:27.622]  And a lot of these are private-contracted private companies that are part of this whole Echelon system, and Echelon is just one program.
[00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:29.762]  There's InfoPoll9 and many others.
[00:11:30.502 --> 00:11:33.063]  They do what Google does, but just on a wider scale.
[00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:43.190]  Not just with internet traffic, but with phone, fax, radio, what their intelligence officers, what their sociologists are saying.
[00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:48.051]  All of this is put into these computers and war games and algorithms.
[00:11:48.952 --> 00:12:01.135]  And the example I was given by one NSA connection is, if for some reason a trend begins to develop where everybody's obsessed with strawberries, an organic, pun intended, just
[00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.692]  Societal development towards liking strawberries and everything.
[00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:07.733]  Strawberry!
[00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:12.917]  Then that data will be given ahead of others noticing the trend.
[00:12:13.397 --> 00:12:18.381]  That data will be given to select globalist corporations that are part of the power structure.
[00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:21.351]  But I mean, let's use a more real world example.
[00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:30.137]  Let's say that a Dutch company or a French company is about to, who isn't part of the inner inner circle of the elite.
[00:12:30.397 --> 00:12:36.482]  They're about to come out with a new processor system that will be five times faster than anything else on the market.
[00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:43.547]  The NSA goes and sees that and then will do whatever they have to, infiltrate people into the building, infiltrate people into the company.
[00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:45.028]  They'll get that data, they'll steal it.
[00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.234]  And then you go, oh good!
[00:12:47.274 --> 00:12:48.355]  That's stealing's good!
[00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:50.056]  That helps America!
[00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:52.218]  No, it doesn't help America!
[00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:55.920]  What happens is, is that then global corporations controlling the U.S.
[00:12:56.221 --> 00:13:06.268]  will patent that, develop that, and then launch it in China, and have their slaves in China or India develop that, and then leverage out the French and the Americans, i.e.
[00:13:06.288 --> 00:13:09.771]  the middle class, that develops almost all of these technologies.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:26.807]  So understand, most of it has nothing to do with tracking terrorist bogeys and boogies and other dark figments of the imagination running around in the countryside with long fangs.
[00:13:28.828 --> 00:13:32.970]  Ring-wraith, Grim Reaper type creatures that people the imaginations of so many.
[00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.351]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:38.027]  Trends!
[00:13:38.087 --> 00:13:41.550]  People are really getting mad about property taxes, and this is what they're saying about it.
[00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.791]  This is the angle.
[00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:54.643]  And then the government's able to come out with a PR campaign, which you'll suddenly see show up in 20 different TV shows, and then in public service announcements, and then in their CIA talking point minions.
[00:13:55.888 --> 00:14:00.574]  They're able to guide and understand trends, but you know what?
[00:14:00.654 --> 00:14:09.484]  Things are moving so fast, things are so organic, and now with the new media exploding even faster than they thought it would, they were going to use it to control us, but now it's starting to backfire.
[00:14:09.524 --> 00:14:16.572]  The evidence is clear, the internet and the rest of it, that they can't keep track of it, and people have automatically built a tolerance to the propaganda.
[00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:40.661]  Either people totally succumb to it and get dumber than dirt, and just plunge into levels of lethargy and self-mesmerized psychological places, or people get resistant to it and you can automatically tell if something is a facsimile or something is a fake, or if something isn't the real McCoy.
[00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:44.943]  So there's a discernment, the palate has become developed
[00:14:45.544 --> 00:14:51.347]  And so the elite, about five years ago, picked up that they couldn't stop us exposing them.
[00:14:51.928 --> 00:14:57.251]  That they couldn't kill us anymore, or just put us in prison, or try to plant pipe bombs on people's property.
[00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.632]  And this is what used to happen to you if you were in this movement, folks.
[00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:00.813]  It was hellish.
[00:15:01.273 --> 00:15:03.174]  People beat you up in parking lots, you name it.
[00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:04.615]  Shut up, don't talk about it anymore.
[00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:07.617]  They figured out they couldn't win, so if you can't beat them, join them.
[00:15:08.097 --> 00:15:13.460]  So now they've all come out of the woodwork, and it's become popular on TV, popular on radio, popular everywhere.
[00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:22.650]  And they're trying to give you at least a flavor of it, a little bit of it, but not take you all the way, not show you the full paradigm shift.
[00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:31.275]  So if you want to understand what the NSA is, here's a microcosm, a local way to understand it.
[00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:35.338]  I remember a USA Today article, it wasn't like it was something classified four years ago.
[00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:41.663]  And it said, it listed several major grocery stores and shopping centers around the country.
[00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:42.363]  They didn't even hide it.
[00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:46.005]  And when you go in, there's tiny pressure plates on the floor.
[00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:54.932]  There are tiny retina following, eye following, eye movement following cameras mounted in the shelving.
[00:15:56.152 --> 00:16:00.876]  There are all sorts of scanners and readers.
[00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:05.639]  And off of the hundreds of choices you make in that grocery store,
[00:16:06.676 --> 00:16:08.858]  And then when you swipe your card, they get that data.
[00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:19.626]  You notice that these customer loyalty pledges, when you still use your credit card, even if you don't want the Randall's card or whatever, when you swipe it, then they want you to... Oh, your card didn't go through.
[00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:20.347]  Swipe it again.
[00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:24.110]  It'll then ask you if you want credit or debt, because they're still getting your data off that regardless.
[00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:34.638]  And then they can combine all of that, and it said right there that... They use an example of a young man coming in, and he stops in the baby aisle, and he's looking at baby materials.
[00:16:35.525 --> 00:16:36.366]  I don't know.
[00:17:00.248 --> 00:17:04.110]  You see, you wonder why Google's trading for four hundred and something dollars a share.
[00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.553]  You wonder why Google has moved in with NASA.
[00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:16.236]  You wonder why Google's allowed to show all these satellite images, but then magically they're edited in real time if you click on the wrong thing.
[00:17:17.177 --> 00:17:22.320]  All that is is the outward snout of the NSA.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:28.543]  The outward proboscis, or the suction point
[00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:31.250]  Of this entire structure.
[00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:35.474]  And they think they're God with it.
[00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:38.756]  They think they can map future developments and societal trends.
[00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:40.137]  They think they can control everything.
[00:17:41.238 --> 00:17:43.759]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.523]  And so that's why Google is now bigger than IBM.
[00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:52.005]  That's why yesterday this happened.
[00:17:52.025 --> 00:17:55.368]  And of course Google will probably go down later and they're going to end up having 10 of these things.
[00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:58.542]  That's what the RFID is.
[00:17:58.582 --> 00:18:07.784]  The RFID will be in every razor, every Campbell's soup can, every bottle of shampoo, every gun, everything, every ammo box you buy.
[00:18:08.284 --> 00:18:12.925]  And that will be attached to your name and will be put in a cookie registry.
[00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:15.426]  Just like when you visit websites, there's an exact record of all of it.
[00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:20.127]  And then off of those thousands of choices a week, they can build detailed psychological algorithms.
[00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:26.746]  You know, when you go, I guess, to be a government agent, they give you those big 600-question things.
[00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:34.915]  You go work at a major corporation, they give you those big psychological tests with 600 questions, supposedly there to catch you in lies and find out what your real psychological makeup is.
[00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:36.576]  Those are nothing.
[00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:37.778]  Those are a shadow.
[00:18:38.507 --> 00:18:51.690]  Those aren't even a shadow of what the real digital algorithms, the psychological algorithms show off of your millions of internet choices, off of your millions of grocery store purchases over the years.
[00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:57.592]  Out of all of the things you do, they get your number.
[00:18:58.372 --> 00:18:59.452]  They know you.
[00:18:59.532 --> 00:19:01.293]  You all have files.
[00:19:02.273 --> 00:19:04.834]  It isn't, oh, I'm going to get on the list if I don't
[00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:09.201]  You know, just go along with this.
[00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:11.022]  You're all on the list, folks.
[00:19:11.762 --> 00:19:13.003]  You're all, it's total.
[00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:20.866]  I mean, right in front of you, you know, when you go on a website and then it flashes the little Google ad and it says, hey, you're in Austin.
[00:19:20.906 --> 00:19:23.207]  You want to hook up with Austin Singles?
[00:19:24.401 --> 00:19:25.501]  Or, hey, you're in Austin.
[00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:26.582]  Go by the Quick Lube.
[00:19:27.342 --> 00:19:30.343]  It's just a mile from your house.
[00:19:30.463 --> 00:19:31.183]  I've seen those.
[00:19:31.243 --> 00:19:32.663]  Oh, you know where I live.
[00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:33.583]  Oh, how nice.
[00:19:34.184 --> 00:19:35.204]  Tailored ads for you.
[00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.905]  Oh, but the government, it's not listening to me.
[00:19:38.605 --> 00:19:41.045]  The government, it's not tracking me.
[00:19:42.026 --> 00:19:43.606]  Just all your cell phones in real time.
[00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:44.846]  Cameras going up.
[00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:45.967]  I mean, come on.
[00:19:46.707 --> 00:19:51.008]  So, it's just... It's as if we live in glass houses.
[00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:53.112]  And physically we do now.
[00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:56.678]  They have these police helicopters look right through your walls with ground penetrating radar.
[00:19:56.698 --> 00:19:58.481]  And you're totally naked.
[00:19:58.602 --> 00:19:59.163]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:08.950]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:22.014]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:23.975]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:27.637]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:31.679]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:36.902]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:20:37.182 --> 00:20:38.903]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:20:39.163 --> 00:20:43.125]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:45.247]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[00:21:12.051 --> 00:21:23.298]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:29.342]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.

[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.002]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.582 --> 00:22:11.082]  That's right.
[00:22:11.382 --> 00:22:14.043]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:21.145]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:29.416]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.856 --> 00:22:34.719]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.362]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:45.266]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:45.646 --> 00:22:47.847]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.527 --> 00:22:50.688]  Make sure that you secure your future.

[00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.990]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:09.657]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?

[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.802]  This is real, not science fiction.

[00:24:02.014 --> 00:24:04.757]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:08.701]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.923 --> 00:24:16.328]  Look, I know we've had a lot of phone lines since this transmission against tyranny began, and we'll get your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:17.770]  It's open phones all day today.
[00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.715]  But I mean, let's just go through the propaganda, because
[00:24:23.889 --> 00:24:40.373]  The government admits, and big corporations admit, everything will have a tiny, they're only about a cent now, for one that reads about 5 feet away, about 3 or 4 cents for one that reads up to, in some cases, 100 yards away, or roughly 300 feet away.
[00:24:41.053 --> 00:24:43.614]  So this is the type of stuff that we're talking about.
[00:24:44.574 --> 00:24:47.695]  This is the type of stuff that is out there.
[00:24:48.670 --> 00:25:02.159]  And with that tiny little RFID chip attached to your name and attached to where you go and what you do, with radio readers being put up just all over the country on the highways and roads and stores, and no one tells you why.
[00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:04.360]  You read the industry publications, it tells you why.
[00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:06.722]  It's going to read and track all of this.
[00:25:07.482 --> 00:25:09.143]  And then they're already advertising it.
[00:25:09.183 --> 00:25:11.565]  Oh, the new smart refrigerators that everyone's going to have.
[00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:15.948]  They'll tell you what you're low on on a computer screen on the front, off the RFID.
[00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:20.368]  And then that becomes the equivalent of the cookies on the internet.
[00:25:20.408 --> 00:25:30.937]  That attaches chips to the real world and creates a type of cyberspace map or three-dimensional grid that we're all supposed to live in.
[00:25:30.957 --> 00:25:34.940]  It literally is a matrix-like system.
[00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:38.078]  And the government is doing this.
[00:25:38.198 --> 00:25:41.781]  Walmart is trying to force all their manufacturers for the last three years to do it.
[00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:51.808]  By this year, two years ago, they had ordered all of their suppliers to have RFID in all of their products, in each individual product.
[00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:56.952]  Not just in each, let's say, package of Gillette razors, but in each razor.
[00:25:58.113 --> 00:26:00.255]  And Gillette and many others complied.
[00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:01.095]  Michelin complied.
[00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:02.096]  So many others complied.
[00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:05.639]  But tens of thousands of suppliers just said, no way!
[00:26:07.282 --> 00:26:09.103]  And plus, all the boycotts started.
[00:26:09.163 --> 00:26:11.646]  So see, we're effectively fighting them.
[00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:13.207]  We're effectively holding them back.
[00:26:13.247 --> 00:26:18.472]  But then to have debates about, well, Bill Clinton spat on us, so it's alright.
[00:26:18.973 --> 00:26:20.534]  No, it shows it's even worse.
[00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:22.877]  It shows it's a unified program.
[00:26:23.977 --> 00:26:26.118]  Bush and Clinton are buddies.
[00:26:26.218 --> 00:26:27.619]  They vacation together.
[00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:28.979]  It's always been staged.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.681]  I'd tell people that ten years ago, they'd laugh at me.
[00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:33.942]  People don't laugh anymore, folks.
[00:26:33.982 --> 00:26:34.962]  This is not a joke.
[00:26:35.002 --> 00:26:36.623]  People now go, yeah, it's true.
[00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:43.634]  Newsweek, Bush asked Keller and Sulzberger to stop Spy Story.
[00:26:44.154 --> 00:26:56.037]  We mentioned this yesterday, but the reason it's so important is, here's Bush calling the New York Times editor into his office and the publisher as well and saying, please don't run this.
[00:26:56.497 --> 00:27:00.720]  And then the news goes, well, the New York Times is publishing a book about this.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.725]  Yeah, and the book's a little tripe-filled, nothing piece of junk, and they have all their own reviewers.
[00:27:07.305 --> 00:27:08.906]  Oh, it's pure genius.
[00:27:09.447 --> 00:27:10.268]  Research.
[00:27:10.708 --> 00:27:12.769]  There's something called the NSA.
[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.730]  Ooh!
[00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.312]  Ooh, such a development.
[00:27:16.672 --> 00:27:19.515]  Oh, give him a Pulitzer for it.
[00:27:19.575 --> 00:27:20.996]  I mean, watch this.
[00:27:21.756 --> 00:27:23.018]  You have to listen to this.
[00:27:23.398 --> 00:27:24.940]  I think the whole thing hasn't been theatred.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.362]  The New York Times folks have to act like it's fighting Bush.
[00:27:27.803 --> 00:27:29.324]  Act like it's anti-establishment.
[00:27:29.344 --> 00:27:33.689]  Remember, they're the ones putting up the fake aluminum tube stories with government operatives working there.
[00:27:33.929 --> 00:27:35.190]  They're a government op.
[00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:36.852]  They play the fake left.
[00:27:37.153 --> 00:27:38.274]  They play the good cop.
[00:27:38.554 --> 00:27:41.177]  They play the bad cop, depending on which side of the spectrum you're on.
[00:27:42.282 --> 00:27:46.923]  But all of it's okay, because the Drudge Report has this big scoop for you, see?
[00:27:47.243 --> 00:27:49.124]  Oh, they give you such big scoops!
[00:27:49.304 --> 00:27:52.305]  Oh, they're such incredible journalists!
[00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:53.725]  Flashback!
[00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:58.487]  Clinton-Carter search and surveillance without court order!
[00:27:58.887 --> 00:27:59.967]  Oh, they did it!
[00:28:00.507 --> 00:28:04.308]  They signed executive orders back in February 9th, 1995.
[00:28:07.435 --> 00:28:17.480]  And then Clinton did it again, and before that in 1994, July 15th, and while the Washington Post had the headline, Administration Backing No Warrant Spy Searches.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:28.725]  Ooh, and the big scoop here is that somebody did a Google search and was able to post that, which we'd already done a week ago in our story showing all the examples of this, and I'm telling you, these people are lazy.
[00:28:29.758 --> 00:28:31.801]  These drudges of the world and others are just lazy.
[00:28:31.821 --> 00:28:34.706]  They're just going to read what we write and what others write and just put it up.
[00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.028]  But they put their own spin on it.
[00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:39.854]  Oh, see Bush is good because Bill Clinton did it too.
[00:28:42.017 --> 00:28:43.560]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:50.284]  And then there's these arguments of, well, it's like we're speeding to the hospital with a woman having a baby.
[00:28:50.304 --> 00:28:52.267]  You know, we can't go get warrants every time.
[00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:54.149]  There are no warrants.
[00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:55.130]  There is no.
[00:28:55.571 --> 00:29:00.036]  The NSA, all these people do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:02.419]  There's no warrant to track every cell phone in the country.
[00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:08.585]  When they're now announcing they're going to use it, quote, for traffic data, then a month later, oh, and for law enforcement.
[00:29:08.885 --> 00:29:13.290]  We're putting cameras up in your neighborhood for traffic and, oh, and crime, they announce a month later.
[00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.771]  I mean, it's the same M.O.
[00:29:14.831 --> 00:29:15.272]  every day.
[00:29:17.097 --> 00:29:19.499]  So, so, why are they now announcing this?
[00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:20.360]  To get you used to it?
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.981]  Oh, the NSA is spying on me!
[00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:28.786]  But just when Al Qaeda calls home, just when somebody calls out of America to the Middle East, I mean, it's just for them Arabs.
[00:29:28.866 --> 00:29:29.747]  It's okay.
[00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:34.230]  So, see, we have to be acclimated because now they want to start using this on the news.
[00:29:34.551 --> 00:29:37.933]  They want to start using it, and, well, they've always been using it.
[00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:42.156]  They want to admit they're using it so they can then use it in court.
[00:29:42.437 --> 00:29:43.878]  So they can then use it on TV.
[00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:45.758]  You understand, folks?
[00:29:45.778 --> 00:29:47.481]  This is their coming out party!
[00:29:47.521 --> 00:29:48.844]  Big Brother's coming out!
[00:29:51.768 --> 00:29:52.650]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.151 --> 00:29:54.773]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.675 --> 00:29:58.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:05.645 --> 00:30:12.209]  Do you have no credit, limited credit, bad credit, or even a past bankruptcy that is preventing you from owning the computer you want?

[00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:19.093]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.153 --> 00:31:30.499]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:37.925]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:50.781]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:33:02.126 --> 00:33:18.359]  Alright, I've got a clip of James Bamford, who was an ABC News executive, and who back in the mid-90s wrote a best-selling book about the NSA that actually exposed what was going on.
[00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:20.641]  Some 850-page monstrosity.
[00:33:21.361 --> 00:33:24.244]  Then he wrote Body of Secrets just a few years ago about the U.S.
[00:33:24.264 --> 00:33:27.166]  government planning and carrying out terror attacks against itself.
[00:33:28.064 --> 00:33:38.111]  We've had him on, and he was the guy at the National Security Archives, because they just declassify tons of it every week, who had his staffers digging through and found Northwoods, which then the U.S.
[00:33:38.131 --> 00:33:41.274]  government did confirm was theirs, the official U.S.
[00:33:41.294 --> 00:33:49.019]  government plan to hijack jets and crash them, and blame it on foreign enemies, and to bomb D.C., and kill Marines, and blame it on foreign enemies, and blow up ships.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.841]  Oh, they did do that with the USS Liberty, by the way.
[00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:56.605]  We're just killing our own troops, killing our own sailors for the New World Order.
[00:33:57.325 --> 00:33:59.928]  I don't support the troops, see, because I don't want to kill them.
[00:34:00.468 --> 00:34:03.931]  I'm not a mindless, gibbering idiot, so I'm not good.
[00:34:04.732 --> 00:34:11.818]  But we'll play a clip of him on C-SPAN and just listen to the mindless arguments that some neocon on the show attacks him with.
[00:34:12.459 --> 00:34:13.440]  And then we'll play another clip.
[00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:15.922]  This is a Bush in two separate speeches.
[00:34:16.843 --> 00:34:22.428]  And by the way, you can link through to whitehouse.gov where you can find the text of those speeches he gave.
[00:34:23.035 --> 00:34:23.976]  It's not just the video.
[00:34:24.236 --> 00:34:26.118]  We have it off the White House website.
[00:34:26.438 --> 00:34:30.783]  We grabbed the body of the text off the site, but then have links to it.
[00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:34.646]  And it was actually listeners who pointed this out in email.
[00:34:35.687 --> 00:34:37.869]  But since then, articles have been written about it.
[00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:41.473]  Because he says, you know, oh, no big deal.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:42.634]  Yeah, we did it without warrants.
[00:34:42.674 --> 00:34:43.435]  I'm the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:34:43.475 --> 00:34:45.457]  I can do whatever I want, which is total fraud.
[00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:47.618]  He's bound by the Constitution.
[00:34:47.658 --> 00:34:49.699]  He's not even Commander-in-Chief until war is declared.
[00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.261]  And then that's Commander-in-Chief of the military, not the American people.
[00:34:52.501 --> 00:34:53.902]  But anyways, back to what I was saying.
[00:34:54.922 --> 00:34:58.545]  Bush then says that we don't need warrants.
[00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:02.207]  But there's a problem.
[00:35:03.128 --> 00:35:06.110]  Bush, in other cases, has said, we always have warrants.
[00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.550]  Don't worry.
[00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:07.811]  The Patriot Act's no big deal.
[00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:09.592]  We're not violating your rights.
[00:35:09.632 --> 00:35:11.113]  I mean, it's just lying.
[00:35:11.173 --> 00:35:12.914]  It's called lying.
[00:35:12.974 --> 00:35:14.535]  They knew that they were lying.
[00:35:15.853 --> 00:35:17.228]  About WMDs.
[00:35:18.288 --> 00:35:33.373]  In fact, let's go ahead and play the Body of Secrets clip here, as Mr. Bamford is on C-SPAN, and he's sitting there arguing with his neocon, and listen to the little tripe arguments that they're using.
[00:35:33.794 --> 00:35:37.675]  And I mean, Bamford's defense of his argument isn't even that strong.
[00:35:37.715 --> 00:35:42.217]  I mean, Bamford's pretty milquetoast, but I mean, look at what he is compared to these neocons.
[00:35:42.237 --> 00:35:42.657]  Here it is.
[00:35:43.017 --> 00:35:44.077]  Now, let me ask you a question.
[00:35:44.097 --> 00:35:45.938]  Let's say your wife is expecting, right?
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.443]  And she says, Dear Jim, I've got to go to the hospital right away.
[00:35:50.885 --> 00:35:54.549]  And you know that you're going to have to speed to get to the hospital in time.
[00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.915]  You say, No dear, I've got to wait and call a judge to make sure I can exceed the speed limit.
[00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:00.617]  Now what would you do?
[00:36:00.637 --> 00:36:02.519]  Would you call a judge or would you just take off?
[00:36:03.482 --> 00:36:11.513]  Actually, it's a good question, because the FISA Act takes that into consideration, and if there's an emergency, you can speed, and you can go out there and get the information.
[00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:16.019]  You just later have to go back and explain to the judge why you did it.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.082]  And the judge will either say,
[00:36:18.642 --> 00:36:20.243]  Good idea or bad idea.
[00:36:20.423 --> 00:36:22.664]  But it takes that into consideration.
[00:36:23.124 --> 00:36:29.147]  I think what we have here is not just speeding to the hospital to save somebody.
[00:36:29.507 --> 00:36:35.430]  This is a president who's used this constantly since 2001, bypassing that law.
[00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.811]  This isn't a one-time deal.
[00:36:38.111 --> 00:36:44.214]  And again, he has a lot of options for going to the court and doing this.
[00:36:44.274 --> 00:36:45.375]  He didn't go to the court.
[00:36:46.236 --> 00:36:50.797]  And there is a legal provision in that statute that says if you don't go to the court...
[00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.313]  It's five years in jail and $10,000 fine.
[00:36:54.893 --> 00:37:01.299]  So the solution here is to get a special prosecutor to take a look at whether the law was violated.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.462]  And I don't know what's funny about that.
[00:37:03.882 --> 00:37:11.489]  You know, we had the Republicans go to impeachment over a minor sexual discretion by a president.
[00:37:11.649 --> 00:37:15.914]  And here's a president violating a law that says ten years in jail
[00:37:16.614 --> 00:37:20.758]  I think it's time that we stop criminalizing the political process and that we
[00:37:32.388 --> 00:37:35.591]  There's nothing criminalizing the political process.
[00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:37.773]  This is breaking the law.
[00:37:37.934 --> 00:37:39.755]  You don't even know the process that was used.
[00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:41.137]  You don't even know who all was interviewed.
[00:37:52.387 --> 00:37:53.087]  You don't know all the facts.
[00:37:53.107 --> 00:37:59.490]  You don't need a Juris Doctor degree to tell you that the law says the only way you can eavesdrop on U.S.
[00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:05.352]  citizens is by going through the FISA Court, and if you don't go through the FISA Court, you... Do you think it was illegal?
[00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.633]  And the President says, I didn't go through the FISA Court.
[00:38:07.653 --> 00:38:17.656]  Do you think it was illegal if we were listening to Osama Bin Laden, and he called somebody in the United States, and they did not hang up, as they had done before 9-11, out of an abundance of precaution?
[00:38:17.737 --> 00:38:19.937]  That's what I hope the Special Prosecutor will find out.
[00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:25.560]  Yeah, I mean, again, that's just total baloney.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:34.562]  The NSA, in just the information that's been released, was listening to Ambassador Wilson, because he wasn't playing ball with them.
[00:38:35.002 --> 00:38:36.343]  They have enemies list.
[00:38:37.243 --> 00:38:42.104]  They do this, and then again, you have this whole argument, Osama Bin Laden is going to get us.
[00:38:42.144 --> 00:38:43.885]  You know, every few months,
[00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:53.015]  We have Bush and Rumsfeld and others dancing around on TV telling us Bin Laden's going to get us, that he's deadly dangerous, that he's evil.
[00:38:53.675 --> 00:39:00.760]  And then meanwhile, Buzzy Krongard tells an intelligence community convention, oh, we don't want Bin Laden, we know where he is.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.722]  He actually said that, Times of London, Associated Press.
[00:39:04.862 --> 00:39:13.094]  And then we have British Special Forces that have been live and surrounding US Special Forces and they're told back off every time they capture senior Taliban and Al Qaeda generals.
[00:39:13.274 --> 00:39:14.556]  This has been in major newspapers.
[00:39:14.956 --> 00:39:17.219]  Our troops are ordered to physically release them.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.125]  They load them on C-130s and fly them out and then they're seen being paid.
[00:39:22.042 --> 00:39:27.503]  They get paid, just like the supposed hijackers were trained in the Defense Language School, Monterey, California.
[00:39:27.523 --> 00:39:30.364]  The dean went public, just like Muhammad Adam.
[00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:32.925]  Magically, they got trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[00:39:33.305 --> 00:39:34.325]  Magically, the U.S.
[00:39:34.765 --> 00:39:36.526]  embassies were told to let them back into the U.S.
[00:39:36.586 --> 00:39:38.686]  It was, quote, part of a government operation.
[00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:49.009]  Oh, they just all get top spy pay, and they get top spy training, and they get totally protected and have government credit cards and FBI informants living in houses with them.
[00:39:49.913 --> 00:39:51.534]  But everything's fine.
[00:39:51.574 --> 00:39:53.255]  They're not government agents.
[00:39:54.336 --> 00:40:02.102]  It was accidental when they flew 8,000 of them out to safety out of Kunduz into Pakistan.
[00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:04.243]  It's all an accident.
[00:40:04.283 --> 00:40:05.584]  Go back to sleep.
[00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:08.026]  Bin Laden's gonna get you, but...
[00:40:09.179 --> 00:40:15.122]  Right before they invaded Iraq, Bush actually got on TV and said, I don't want to hear about Bin Laden anymore.
[00:40:15.543 --> 00:40:16.503]  He's not a threat.
[00:40:16.904 --> 00:40:18.064]  He's not a problem.
[00:40:18.484 --> 00:40:19.745]  He's been neutralized.
[00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:21.006]  He's been dealt with.
[00:40:22.247 --> 00:40:24.208]  And it's no problem, which is true.
[00:40:25.148 --> 00:40:28.950]  Bin Laden took the hit for the family and they were rewarded with even bigger U.S.
[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.391]  contracts.
[00:40:29.431 --> 00:40:30.831]  They built every major U.S.
[00:40:30.872 --> 00:40:31.552]  base in the Middle East.
[00:40:32.802 --> 00:40:34.103]  They air-conditioned Mecca.
[00:40:34.123 --> 00:40:35.963]  They air-conditioned most of those major cities.
[00:40:36.364 --> 00:40:37.844]  They air-conditioned the U.S.
[00:40:37.904 --> 00:40:39.385]  and British and European compounds.
[00:40:39.785 --> 00:40:44.927]  I mean, they have like half of the construction contracts in all the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:47.788]  I mean, these people are just making millions a month.
[00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:52.110]  They're huge Carlyle Group owners.
[00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:56.152]  They are majority owners, substantive owners.
[00:40:57.356 --> 00:41:01.338]  Let's just say majority is an incorrect comment.
[00:41:01.378 --> 00:41:05.280]  They are tier one owners.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.242]  They own more than even George Bush and his people.
[00:41:08.442 --> 00:41:10.263]  They don't own more than the Queen of England.
[00:41:10.303 --> 00:41:10.863]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:41:10.883 --> 00:41:12.824]  Just type in Queen of England, Halliburton.
[00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:16.126]  And you'll get BBC, AP, she's the big owner.
[00:41:16.146 --> 00:41:16.906]  So that's incorrect.
[00:41:17.687 --> 00:41:22.129]  Sachs-Coburg, Goethe's, Bin Laden's, and then the Bush's and people like that.
[00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:24.073]  On down the line.
[00:41:24.493 --> 00:41:27.094]  And I'm sorry, if you don't like hearing this, it's just the facts.
[00:41:27.654 --> 00:41:27.895]  Okay?
[00:41:27.915 --> 00:41:30.116]  I mean, Bush has arrested anybody with Al Qaeda connections.
[00:41:30.456 --> 00:41:36.419]  No one has more Al Qaeda connections I've ever seen to Osama Bin Laden than the Bushes.
[00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:43.403]  The only people with more of a more intimate, close connection to Bin Laden is his actual family.
[00:41:43.663 --> 00:41:48.726]  His mama is the only person that is close.
[00:41:49.806 --> 00:41:50.787]  His mama
[00:41:52.037 --> 00:41:52.818]  You understand me?
[00:41:53.358 --> 00:42:10.624]  Osama Bin Laden's mama and his daddy and his greedy greedy granny are the only people that I know of who've got more business connections and vacation connections and business connections going back into the seventies as the Bushes.
[00:42:10.724 --> 00:42:14.086]  Now I'm just sick of it and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:42:14.546 --> 00:42:14.866]  In fact,
[00:42:15.701 --> 00:42:18.083]  So Bush openly said, I'm not worried about Bin Laden anymore.
[00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:19.164]  We need to focus on Saddam.
[00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:23.087]  And the news actually shut up about Bin Laden for years and made it all Saddam.
[00:42:23.888 --> 00:42:25.309]  This is no longer the boogeyman.
[00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:26.330]  This is the new boogeyman.
[00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.431]  This is who you're supposed to hate.
[00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:28.858]  Again!
[00:42:29.418 --> 00:42:35.082]  No one has more connections to Saddam Hussein of any government than the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:35.703]  Public.
[00:42:36.724 --> 00:42:35.703]  1958.
[00:42:36.924 --> 00:42:39.246]  Hired when he was 18 years old.
[00:42:39.286 --> 00:42:40.987]  Given two years of assassin training.
[00:42:41.307 --> 00:42:43.449]  Killed and killed and killed and killed.
[00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.630]  All over.
[00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.732]  Killed so many Ba'athists it was ridiculous.
[00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:47.993]  Machine gunning presidents.
[00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:48.413]  Killing.
[00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:49.294]  Bombing.
[00:42:49.374 --> 00:42:49.914]  Torturing.
[00:42:49.954 --> 00:42:52.937]  Just absolute, you know, Billy Bad Butt.
[00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.559]  Just rampaging everywhere.
[00:42:56.099 --> 00:43:02.842]  And then they got him in as the head of security in 69, head Baptist in 79, gave him 30 plus billion to attack the Iranians, U.S.
[00:43:02.902 --> 00:43:09.726]  Ambassador April Gillespie said go ahead and attack Kuwait, we're on your side, we're not going to get involved, we're your ally, he said thank you, invaded.
[00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:18.130]  It's all, so again, Bin Laden, Saddam, and I don't want to hear, well we did some blow back, we worked with whoever we need to.
[00:43:19.557 --> 00:43:21.637]  We work with whoever we have to.
[00:43:22.078 --> 00:43:23.858]  No, it isn't we work with them.
[00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:25.118]  We are them.
[00:43:25.438 --> 00:43:26.678]  They're finger puppets.
[00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:29.239]  They're sock puppets, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:29.999 --> 00:43:30.419]  Okay?
[00:43:30.759 --> 00:43:41.682]  You know, if you put on a puppet show with a little Pinocchio puppet, and you're sitting there working the marionette, and you got the strings, baby, you know, that puppet's under your control.
[00:43:42.402 --> 00:43:44.782]  It isn't like that puppet's out dancing around on its own.
[00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.343]  I mean, this is why I'm so angry.
[00:43:46.863 --> 00:43:48.623]  This stuff isn't hard to figure out.
[00:43:50.282 --> 00:43:51.283]  It isn't hard at all.
[00:43:51.723 --> 00:43:53.244]  So go ahead and play that other clip.
[00:43:54.325 --> 00:43:58.709]  This is a clip of Bush when he was asked about Bin Laden.
[00:43:58.729 --> 00:44:00.750]  He said, this is two years ago, I don't care about Bin Laden.
[00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.611]  I don't care where he is.
[00:44:02.051 --> 00:44:03.252]  I don't care what he's doing.
[00:44:04.393 --> 00:44:07.556]  Then this got brought up in the presidential debates and Bush said, I never said that.
[00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:08.637]  That's a lie.
[00:44:08.857 --> 00:44:09.457]  That's a lie.
[00:44:09.497 --> 00:44:12.620]  He even said to his own skull and bones brother, Kerry, that's a lie.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.480]  I never said that.
[00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:15.222]  You're a liar, boy.
[00:44:15.642 --> 00:44:16.983]  Well, I guess we're all liars.
[00:44:17.023 --> 00:44:17.344]  Here it is.
[00:44:17.364 --> 00:44:17.844]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:44:18.835 --> 00:44:20.677]  And again, I don't know where he is.
[00:44:20.697 --> 00:44:26.381]  I repeat what I said.
[00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:28.202]  I truly am not that concerned about him.
[00:44:30.644 --> 00:44:31.825]  Play that again, Lewis.
[00:44:33.607 --> 00:44:35.488]  And again, I don't know where he is.
[00:44:35.508 --> 00:44:41.172]  I repeat what I said.
[00:44:41.233 --> 00:44:42.894]  I truly am not that concerned about him.
[00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:46.445]  All right, well that's good, Bush.
[00:44:46.485 --> 00:44:47.486]  We really appreciate that.
[00:44:47.506 --> 00:44:49.589]  Now let's play this new clip.
[00:44:49.669 --> 00:44:56.898]  This is where Bush lies, and this is from two separate press conferences and we repeat it repeatedly.
[00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:01.103]  Bush lies stating that wiretap required court order.
[00:45:02.003 --> 00:45:04.644]  And what a difference a year makes, or is this election?
[00:45:04.984 --> 00:45:20.288]  Back in 2004, George W. Bush was caught on camera claiming very carefully that the government always requires a court order when chasing down terrorists trying to sell the Patriot Act, which is a total lie, which he wanted renewed, but which was coming under increased fire from all sides of the political spectrum.
[00:45:20.708 --> 00:45:23.269]  Bush was very clear that a wiretap requires a court order.
[00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:24.550]  Nothing has changed, by the way.
[00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.510]  That's what he said.
[00:45:27.071 --> 00:45:35.154]  By that he meant that neither the Patriot Act nor its ostensible cause, the 9-11 terrorist attacks, changed the absolute legal requirement of the government to get a court order.
[00:45:35.714 --> 00:45:36.595]  But here it is.
[00:45:36.655 --> 00:45:39.056]  Let's play the clips from two separate speeches.
[00:45:39.096 --> 00:45:39.416]  Here it is.
[00:45:40.016 --> 00:45:40.877]  With court approval.
[00:45:41.217 --> 00:45:42.077]  With court approval.
[00:45:42.437 --> 00:45:43.298]  With court approval.
[00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:44.518]  With court approval.
[00:45:44.878 --> 00:45:45.779]  With court approval.
[00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:49.921]  We have long used roving wiretaps to lock up monsters.
[00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:51.681]  Mobsters.
[00:45:53.062 --> 00:45:54.683]  Now we have a chance to lock up monsters.
[00:45:57.668 --> 00:46:01.790]  Secondly, there are such things as roving wiretaps.
[00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:10.814]  By the way, any time you hear the United States government talking about wiretap, a wiretap requires a court order.
[00:46:12.135 --> 00:46:13.995]  A wiretap requires a court order.
[00:46:14.436 --> 00:46:16.297]  A wiretap requires a court order.
[00:46:16.737 --> 00:46:18.598]  A wiretap requires a court order.
[00:46:19.058 --> 00:46:20.919]  A wiretap requires a court order.
[00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:23.680]  Nothing has changed, by the way.
[00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:29.246]  When we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so.
[00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:42.093]  It's important for our fellow citizens to understand, when you think Patriot Act, constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the Constitution.
[00:46:42.113 --> 00:46:44.114]  Because we value the Constitution.
[00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:46.095]  Because we value the Constitution.
[00:46:46.115 --> 00:46:48.076]  Because we value the Constitution.
[00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:50.077]  Because we value the Constitution.
[00:46:50.437 --> 00:46:51.478]  So with court order,
[00:46:52.874 --> 00:47:00.960]  Law enforcement officials can now use what's called roving wiretaps, which will prevent a terrorist from switching cell phones in order to get a message out to one of his buddies.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:07.525]  Are you putting in order a leaks investigation into the disclosure of the NSA surveillance program?
[00:47:08.305 --> 00:47:14.950]  And why did you skip the basic safeguard of asking courts for permission for these intercepts?
[00:47:16.151 --> 00:47:19.854]  Why did you skip the basic safeguards of asking courts
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.521]  For permission for the intercept.
[00:47:22.602 --> 00:47:23.782]  We use FISAs still.
[00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:26.004]  You're referring to the FISA court in your question.
[00:47:26.024 --> 00:47:26.965]  Of course we use FISAs.
[00:47:28.186 --> 00:47:30.147]  But FISAs is for long-term monitoring.
[00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:35.291]  What is needed in order to protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to detect.
[00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:41.455]  Having suggested this idea, I then obviously went to the question, is it legal to do so?
[00:47:41.475 --> 00:47:45.278]  I am, you know, I swore to uphold the laws.
[00:47:46.979 --> 00:47:48.821]  Do I have the legal authority to do this?
[00:47:50.327 --> 00:47:51.788]  And the answer is absolutely.
[00:47:53.048 --> 00:48:01.933]  As I mentioned in my remarks, legal authority is derived from the Constitution, as well as the authorization of force by the United States Congress.
[00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:03.193]  Right.
[00:48:03.753 --> 00:48:04.314]  Appreciate it.
[00:48:04.554 --> 00:48:04.774]  Thank you.
[00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:08.462]  You know what?
[00:48:08.502 --> 00:48:09.202]  Stop it right there.
[00:48:09.242 --> 00:48:10.263]  It just goes on and on.
[00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:22.176]  Now, I'm sorry, that's three separate clips that we played in their entirety, and then it's repeated over and over again by the folks who put this together, I guess to add some comical impact, but I don't really think it's funny.
[00:48:22.737 --> 00:48:25.880]  And then it was some clips from his press conference Monday morning.
[00:48:27.261 --> 00:48:30.565]  Understand, folks, roving wiretaps are already unconstitutional.
[00:48:31.104 --> 00:48:32.265]  Okay, but they're doing that.
[00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:36.409]  That is, the FISA court says, hey, go run 5,000 of these if you want.
[00:48:36.709 --> 00:48:38.331]  Just randomly listen to whoever you want.
[00:48:38.911 --> 00:48:41.173]  Now, folks, again, they've been listening to everybody to begin with.
[00:48:41.193 --> 00:48:46.138]  This is just because they now want to publicly tell you about it to condition you to expand it.
[00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:50.882]  And then he says, but do I have the authority?
[00:48:51.182 --> 00:48:53.845]  Oh, yes, because I'm the commander-in-chief, is what he's saying.
[00:48:53.865 --> 00:48:57.388]  You know, Congress gave me the military authorization for force.
[00:48:58.206 --> 00:49:02.669]  That was based on a lie, and was a limited time, and was not constitutional.
[00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:08.532]  They should have declared war, and specifically named the enemy, and then that put the constitutional safeguards in place.
[00:49:08.592 --> 00:49:09.933]  You violated all of that!
[00:49:10.574 --> 00:49:12.955]  But now it's supposedly okay because Bill Clinton did it too.
[00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:17.058]  And the media is patting themselves on the back.
[00:49:17.198 --> 00:49:19.219]  Oh, there's a thing called the NSA.
[00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:19.899]  Aren't we great?
[00:49:19.939 --> 00:49:20.740]  Aren't we incredible?
[00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:22.381]  So...
[00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:30.675]  That's the kind of stuff that we have up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:49:31.916 --> 00:49:34.638]  And I hope you'll go there and get these clips and get them out to everybody.
[00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:40.063]  And when people go, well, so what if they surveil us?
[00:49:40.103 --> 00:49:46.468]  Point out, all your cell phones are surveilled, all your internet traffic is surveilled, all your phone calls are already surveilled.
[00:49:46.508 --> 00:49:47.849]  That is all admitted!
[00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:55.621]  But the public is so ignorant of this, they're now having a false debate, teaching the public, oh no, we're listening to you, but only a little bit.
[00:49:55.661 --> 00:50:00.523]  See, if the Global is trying to come out and say everything you do is being tracked, Jack, people freak out.
[00:50:00.603 --> 00:50:06.547]  But if they slowly, oh it's just to stop Bin Laden, and Bin Laden's on the phone, should we have to get a warrant for that?
[00:50:07.107 --> 00:50:09.368]  What they don't tell you is there's already no need for that warrant.
[00:50:09.428 --> 00:50:10.849]  If it's overseas, there's no need.
[00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:13.773]  If it's an overseas call, here domestically.
[00:50:14.793 --> 00:50:15.894]  They don't have to go get the warrant.
[00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:22.999]  They just later have to go show to the judge who would rubber stamp a ham sandwich and call it the Empire States Building.
[00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:29.044]  They don't even want to do that because this is just pell-mell.
[00:50:29.684 --> 00:50:34.047]  30,000 national security letters have been signed in the last four years.
[00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:35.048]  30,000 national security letters.
[00:50:35.368 --> 00:50:35.929]  You know what those do?
[00:50:37.538 --> 00:50:38.298]  It's been on the record.
[00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:48.244]  They go into a major bookstore and say, we're going to search all your records for who's been buying books here, not just libraries, but we'll arrest you as a terrorist if you ever, in perpetuity, tell anyone we were here.
[00:50:49.565 --> 00:50:51.906]  So it also violates your free speech.
[00:50:52.846 --> 00:50:54.807]  And it makes you talk and violates the Fifth Amendment.
[00:50:55.428 --> 00:50:58.009]  I mean, it's just, it's all total violations.
[00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.951]  And they're trying to dress it up and have a debate about it.
[00:51:02.788 --> 00:51:05.631]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.891 --> 00:51:07.473]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.813 --> 00:51:12.497]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.838 --> 00:51:19.564]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.884 --> 00:51:21.885]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.085 --> 00:51:24.927]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.007 --> 00:51:29.690]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:34.292]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.532 --> 00:51:41.756]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.996 --> 00:51:44.418]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:41.914]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper, and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.

[00:52:56.305 --> 00:52:56.765]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:19.307]  I think so.
[00:53:38.899 --> 00:53:39.219]  I think so.
[00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:11.212]  I've done pretty close to an hour here covering news, and we're going to go to David and Jeff and Kamin and Bob and Jim.
[00:54:11.232 --> 00:54:12.332]  I got some Kamin boots.
[00:54:13.172 --> 00:54:13.652]  Pretty good.
[00:54:13.932 --> 00:54:15.193]  I look forward to talking to you, Kamin.
[00:54:16.773 --> 00:54:18.914]  And there is just so much more coming up.
[00:54:18.974 --> 00:54:20.954]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:54:22.295 --> 00:54:23.835]  Look at this Washington Post article.
[00:54:23.855 --> 00:54:25.055]  I could talk about this all day.
[00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:27.116]  Now, it's very subtle, but listen.
[00:54:27.456 --> 00:54:31.677]  Chinese police bring villagers to heel after latest uprising.
[00:54:32.825 --> 00:54:36.847]  And it shows, uh, you know, basically families that have been beat up with small children in the street.
[00:54:36.867 --> 00:54:37.707]  They have a photo of it.
[00:54:38.988 --> 00:54:42.409]  And they just machine gun whole crowds of people that don't want to give up their property who fight back.
[00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:46.671]  Now, ten years ago, it would have been freedom fighters stand up against a brutal communist.
[00:54:47.351 --> 00:54:51.173]  But now, when they mow people down on the streets, it's just a minor footnote in a few newspapers.
[00:54:51.193 --> 00:54:52.473]  It's been going on for a month now.
[00:54:53.154 --> 00:54:56.975]  And they just go, oh, the police dealt with some really bad people.
[00:54:58.556 --> 00:54:59.736]  You see how that works?
[00:54:59.956 --> 00:55:01.177]  See how we've changed?
[00:55:02.256 --> 00:55:03.997]  Maybe Gentleman's Square was good.
[00:55:04.037 --> 00:55:06.438]  Maybe they were with Al Qaeda.
[00:55:08.299 --> 00:55:12.861]  We're going to start the second hour and go right to David, Jeff, Cayman and Bob and many others.
[00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:14.121]  So stay there folks.
[00:55:14.181 --> 00:55:15.042]  We'll get to you.
[00:55:15.202 --> 00:55:16.662]  Just a few program notes here.
[00:55:17.203 --> 00:55:21.444]  I'm offering InfoWars.com listeners your own Genesis streams.
[00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.505]  Genesis has their streams.
[00:55:23.604 --> 00:55:25.225]  They play their games, we play ours.
[00:55:25.505 --> 00:55:27.506]  That's a Full Metal Jacket quote, I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.
[00:55:28.427 --> 00:55:31.669]  But they were having some problems with one of their servers, now it's up and working fine.
[00:55:31.689 --> 00:55:40.114]  But it doesn't matter, we have our own 2200 streams as a supplement to their thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of streams to supply you.
[00:55:40.794 --> 00:55:42.055]  And you can go to
[00:55:43.195 --> 00:55:49.917]  InfoWars.com if you want streams that won't be hiccuping on you and find 2200 of them right there for you.
[00:55:49.957 --> 00:55:57.439]  New streams to bookmark, new supplies of the InfoWars river of information.
[00:55:57.519 --> 00:55:59.179]  So, we'd love it if you do that.

[00:58:46.655 --> 00:58:46.755]  Hello?
[00:58:57.626 --> 00:58:58.287]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.947 --> 00:58:59.988]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.709 --> 00:59:01.830]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:03.291]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:04.952]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.613 --> 00:59:09.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:13.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.303 --> 00:59:20.643]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:20.683 --> 00:59:26.586]  We're now into the second hour of this live Wednesday, the 21st day of December, 2005 edition.
[00:59:26.626 --> 00:59:28.548]  We will have open phones now for the next few hours.
[00:59:29.328 --> 00:59:34.951]  There's a bunch of news on the mass murder by the Chinese government over in China, suppressing their peasantry.
[00:59:35.966 --> 00:59:44.168]  We also have a lot of other torture news, a lot of other corruption news, a lot of news on this wiretapping and the NSA and the rest of it and some other clips we're going to be playing.
[00:59:44.588 --> 00:59:46.448]  Big show lined up for you in the next two hours.
[00:59:46.468 --> 00:59:47.788]  Without further ado, let's go to your calls.
[00:59:47.828 --> 00:59:49.769]  And quickly, David and Mass, you're a trooper.
[00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:50.109]  Welcome.
[00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:52.009]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:59:52.329 --> 00:59:52.909]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:59:53.689 --> 00:59:55.069]  You'll find this kind of interesting.
[00:59:55.370 --> 01:00:03.751]  The other day, a couple days ago, I was having problems with the archive streams at GCN that you were alluding to in the last segment.
[01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:11.636]  So I was trying to email them over there, but I didn't know what their actual DNS address was, their domain or name server.
[01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:16.679]  So I typed in gcn.com and got an interesting site.
[01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:18.420]  Listen to how paradoxical this is.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.482]  Government Computer News.
[01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:23.083]  And some nice little articles up there.
[01:00:23.183 --> 01:00:27.926]  This one here, TSA Biometric ID Card Programs Move Forward.
[01:00:28.447 --> 01:00:33.552]  They have the two programs, one for pre-screened travelers, and the other one for nation-wide.
[01:00:33.572 --> 01:00:42.301]  And that's going to be the national ID card, that's what I saw Reg announce three years ago, and it's going to be nationwide with federal troops on every street corner.
[01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:48.768]  And the guidelines here, collection of ten fingerprints, two iris images at enrollment,
[01:00:49.227 --> 01:00:51.688]  Utilizing smart cards to verify identities.
[01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:53.588]  Rapid rolling out of the program.
[01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:55.769]  Sustaining the program through user fees.
[01:00:56.109 --> 01:01:00.430]  Including identity authentication and verification.
[01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:05.351]  And see right now it's going to be a status thing and go to the other line as your good little volunteer Nazi.
[01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:11.653]  But the feds have already instructed through the Real ID Act for under law all the states to adopt it in their drivers license.
[01:01:11.913 --> 01:01:17.314]  That's right and this is very interesting Alex because yesterday in the Boston Globe I got this article here.
[01:01:18.146 --> 01:01:20.768]  T is rolling ahead with fare cards.
[01:01:20.888 --> 01:01:23.891]  Details of plans to convert to prepaid system by end of 2006.
[01:01:25.332 --> 01:01:26.633]  Now this is the same thing.
[01:01:26.693 --> 01:01:28.314]  They're doing away with all the tokens.
[01:01:28.775 --> 01:01:30.276]  Everything's going to be a smart card.
[01:01:30.296 --> 01:01:39.183]  They're going to set up all these automated kiosks where you can get your smart cards and you can do cash, debit or credit and the whole thing.
[01:01:39.243 --> 01:01:41.986]  But the illegal aliens, they're going to be getting theirs.
[01:01:42.901 --> 01:01:43.441]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:44.382]  They'll come right through.
[01:01:44.422 --> 01:01:46.122]  So, you know, it's interesting.
[01:01:46.142 --> 01:01:47.863]  I think that was quite an interesting thing.
[01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:53.765]  So they'll set up, that'll be also tied in to when they want to roll out the biometrics to utilize it.
[01:01:53.825 --> 01:01:55.906]  They'll be very easily done by then.
[01:01:55.926 --> 01:01:56.926]  You emailed me that, didn't you?
[01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:57.427]  Because I read that.
[01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.447]  I emailed you, yes.
[01:01:58.467 --> 01:02:05.810]  You know, the article I emailed you from Computer News was, top-off exercise would benefit from better information sharing.
[01:02:06.365 --> 01:02:13.647]  And that was from that same site, and I don't know if you got that, but I did email that over to Tips and Info Wars, but... No, I was reading it this morning.
[01:02:14.168 --> 01:02:20.450]  Yeah, I mean, it's quite interesting, though, how this all ties into the control grid, and... Well, look, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.951]  The general public's still debating, are we going to get a national ID card?
[01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:26.372]  They put it in five years ago in most states.
[01:02:26.412 --> 01:02:27.772]  They passed a law to do it.
[01:02:28.052 --> 01:02:32.974]  They're setting it up, and the average person's going, I ain't gonna take one, and you got one in your back pocket.
[01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:34.791]  You already have.
[01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:45.636]  And now they've got the Viper teams, I'm sure you've heard about that, which are the TSA going to be on the street with police under their command, and the police are going to have Homeland Security Tattletail squads under them.
[01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.177]  Did you hear that Homeland Security chief that I had on?
[01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:50.678]  The Tattletail squad leader?
[01:02:51.218 --> 01:02:57.441]  The big professor out of Knoxville, and he admitted that the emergency management centers are these federal grids and that they're tracking us all?
[01:02:58.863 --> 01:03:07.161]  Well, Alex, I'm surprised that they haven't sent the Viper squads in to suppress and put back in order the New York City transit strike.
[01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:08.123]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:08.143 --> 01:03:08.845]  Where are the troops?
[01:03:09.918 --> 01:03:17.162]  Actually, they do have cops out, not letting people with, you know, less than three or four people, what is it, four people, into the city, and it's just unbelievable.
[01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:20.484]  Well, I'm surprised that they didn't use a more, uh, Orwellian kind of name for them, like Domestic Peacekeeper.
[01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:22.785]  How about Skulltrips, or Devil Dogtrips, or, I mean, you know, Viper's good enough, though.
[01:03:22.805 --> 01:03:32.551]  Viper Teams, Viper, Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:03:33.932 --> 01:03:36.474]  I mean, it's all archetypal.
[01:03:36.754 --> 01:03:39.916]  You know, I made the joke that SWAT team people wear Cobra Commander outfits.
[01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:42.578]  Alex, have a Merry Christmas.
[01:03:42.638 --> 01:03:44.199]  I know the NSA is probably listening.
[01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:46.320]  Well, you know, they're probably listening and agreeing with us.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.541]  We've already converted most of them.
[01:03:47.982 --> 01:03:49.723]  A lot of them were converted before we ever talked to them.
[01:03:50.043 --> 01:03:51.324]  Yeah, hi boys, hi girls.

[01:04:24.497 --> 01:04:29.021]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:31.703]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:31.944 --> 01:04:38.650]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:06:03.364 --> 01:06:04.886]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.188]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:06:07.368 --> 01:06:10.852]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:06:11.232 --> 01:06:13.253]  And they can do it without due process.

[01:06:53.724 --> 01:06:59.265]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.622 --> 01:07:12.627]  We just had a caller who called in about that government computer website.
[01:07:12.647 --> 01:07:13.968]  It's like an industry publication.
[01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:20.876]  And about how they just admit we'll all have these national ID cards with all these biometrics on it and how they're implementing it.
[01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.479]  And that's actually one of the places I go.
[01:07:23.519 --> 01:07:25.622]  There's gotta be like a hundred of them.
[01:07:26.677 --> 01:07:52.717]  They've got an RFID website, what is it, RFID News, and they just say, you'll have it to buy and sell, and you go to the incredible microchip websites, and, oh, you'll have to have it to buy and sell, and then I have the CEOs on, reply digital, and they go, oh yes, in the future you'll have to have this to buy and sell, and the chip will prevail, and get chipped today, these are the little trademark comments, catchphrases, and Tommy Thompson travels the country telling the kids to take them, but he's not taking his, and
[01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:57.120]  There's no doubt about what they're doing.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:57.681]  That's the thing.
[01:07:57.701 --> 01:08:06.988]  You read the New York Times, they'll tell you some 20-year-old news with a spin on it like it's good, and then run around giving themselves Pulitzer Prizes, literally.
[01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:11.291]  It's pathetic, mindless, tripe, garbage.
[01:08:11.311 --> 01:08:12.492]  It's always twisted.
[01:08:12.773 --> 01:08:14.014]  It's an intelligence operation.
[01:08:14.334 --> 01:08:15.535]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:17.316]  But you go read industry publications.
[01:08:18.257 --> 01:08:20.479]  You go to the big press release websites.
[01:08:21.745 --> 01:08:26.649]  And, you know, there's all these companies, press relations, where they're communicating with each other and stockholders.
[01:08:27.089 --> 01:08:31.072]  You know, oh, Lockheed Martin's moving into domestic law enforcement control.
[01:08:31.392 --> 01:08:35.715]  This new market could be bigger than potential fine markets and conflicts.
[01:08:35.755 --> 01:08:39.878]  I mean, you just read where they openly are taking over.
[01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:41.559]  That's why I'm so angry.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.322]  And yes, so much of it is in the industry publications.
[01:08:45.362 --> 01:08:47.624]  I remember ten years ago, a truck driver
[01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:50.486]  Nailing me a big truck driving magazine.
[01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:52.027]  I don't remember the exact name of it.
[01:08:52.048 --> 01:08:53.529]  It was one of those huge magazines.
[01:08:53.549 --> 01:08:57.132]  You know those magazines that are full color and they're like twice the size of a Time magazine.
[01:08:57.152 --> 01:08:58.374]  They're really tall and really wide.
[01:08:58.394 --> 01:09:00.556]  It was like this big old, you know, thing.
[01:09:00.596 --> 01:09:03.579]  And it was the whole issue was there'll be radio readers going up.
[01:09:03.619 --> 01:09:05.000]  Part of a federal test program.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.284]  We'll be tracking all the trucks and thumb scanning and we'll be, it's going to be wonderful.
[01:09:09.364 --> 01:09:11.887]  And that's how I knew all this.
[01:09:14.142 --> 01:09:19.324]  And then I'd see a state rep's name in there, but this state rep doesn't like it, so I'd call and get him on.
[01:09:19.344 --> 01:09:21.985]  And he'd say, I've been in the federal task force meetings.
[01:09:22.285 --> 01:09:26.066]  It's going to be a tax nationwide on transponders in all of your cars.
[01:09:26.326 --> 01:09:28.907]  He didn't call them RFID, and it's absolutely horrible.
[01:09:29.227 --> 01:09:30.368]  We've got to defeat it.
[01:09:30.748 --> 01:09:31.348]  What was his name?
[01:09:31.388 --> 01:09:32.608]  Some Democrat from Wisconsin.
[01:09:32.628 --> 01:09:34.389]  He was on the federal transportation board.
[01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:38.130]  But still, newspapers would attack me.
[01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:41.411]  Alex Jones says they're tracking you with your phone!
[01:09:41.632 --> 01:09:42.672]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:44.045 --> 01:09:45.606]  He's an idiot!
[01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:47.787]  It's not in the Washington Post!
[01:09:47.807 --> 01:09:49.409]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:09:49.429 --> 01:09:50.910]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:09:51.751 --> 01:09:52.531]  It's ridiculous.
[01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:57.055]  But again, they're not going to come out and say, we're surveilling everything you do!
[01:09:57.495 --> 01:09:58.476]  People will go, no way!
[01:09:58.556 --> 01:09:58.976]  Stop it!
[01:09:59.517 --> 01:10:01.818]  We just surveil when Bin Laden calls.
[01:10:01.858 --> 01:10:03.400]  It's just to stop Al Qaeda.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.243]  So we're surveilling you tens of thousands of times.
[01:10:08.524 --> 01:10:10.145]  And again, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:12.527]  So they're breaking the ice with you.
[01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.298]  Jeff in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[01:10:15.498 --> 01:10:15.819]  Welcome.
[01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:32.769]  Yeah, Alex, yeah, I just wanted to say, first of all, that we'd like to see your show expanded to eight hours a day, of course, but I don't even think that that would be long enough due to all the corruption and cover-ups that are going on in the government, but in any event, I wanted to talk a little bit about the NSA, and you're exactly right.
[01:10:32.789 --> 01:10:40.494]  You hit on several key points, and Bush's flip-flopping, of course, saying that he needed a court order for a wiretap, and then
[01:10:40.947 --> 01:10:42.427]  He's saying something totally different now.
[01:10:42.527 --> 01:10:45.248]  Well, he was lying, saying, we don't spy on you without a warrant.
[01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:46.748]  Well, everybody knows that's pure baloney.
[01:10:46.948 --> 01:10:47.549]  Oh, exactly.
[01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:59.571]  And not only that, Alex, the NSA, exactly what they're doing, and also the Patriot Act, and of course the FBI are doing exactly the same thing the NSA is doing.
[01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:06.333]  And a good example, let me give you a good example of how they're using the Patriot Act for non-terrorism purposes.
[01:11:06.843 --> 01:11:10.925]  They targeted Mr. Ghilardi, who's a strip club owner up in Las Vegas.
[01:11:11.785 --> 01:11:13.666]  They targeted him and used the Patriot Act.
[01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.367]  Yeah, that was in the Las Vegas Review Journal.
[01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:16.227]  Exactly.
[01:11:16.608 --> 01:11:22.190]  And they're using it for non-terrorism purposes, and they're targeting war protesters, they're targeting activists.
[01:11:22.931 --> 01:11:30.514]  And there's already been several federal court rulings, Alex, that, well, several provisions of the Patriot Act are unconstitutional.
[01:11:32.785 --> 01:11:34.966]  Violating a lot of federal laws.
[01:11:35.006 --> 01:11:36.307]  You know what a listener did yesterday?
[01:11:36.347 --> 01:11:48.753]  If you go to prisonplanet.com, right at the top now, because it's so important, it says tips, suggestions, emails, and a listener, and he gave the URLs, a listener sent us like
[01:11:49.667 --> 01:11:52.609]  I don't know, there's like ten examples, and these are all examples I was aware of.
[01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.951]  Man rights letter, deemed terrorism, no threat, arrested.
[01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:58.792]  Man complains, arrested.
[01:11:58.812 --> 01:12:03.275]  You know, toy store visited under Patriot Act.
[01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:07.037]  And then there's just a whole, homeless people arrested under Patriot Act.
[01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:10.019]  War protesters peacefully charged under Patriot Act.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.982]  Exactly, and then Bush gets up on TV.
[01:12:13.022 --> 01:12:23.533]  I've seen these staged events, like on Fox News, where they'll have one of their ringer, you know, civil liberties people who's really on their side and operative, and they'll be a bumbling fool, and then Hannity will make a fool out of them.
[01:12:23.733 --> 01:12:25.355]  You just show me one example!
[01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.016]  You just show me one!
[01:12:27.036 --> 01:12:29.779]  I mean, I can show you 50 examples in Austin, Texas.
[01:12:29.839 --> 01:12:30.300]  I mean, it just...
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.141]  It's just pure baloney!
[01:12:32.321 --> 01:12:55.811]  Every time you go to get a bank account, every time you go cash a check, every time you go buy a new refrigerator, every time you go buy a used car, every time you enroll your kids, every time you go and get a prescription, I don't care if it's for a diaphragm, or for a prosthesis, or for prescription strength ibuprofen, it is immediately run through the government via the Patriot Act, via NSA.
[01:12:56.031 --> 01:12:57.032]  Remember the executive order?
[01:12:57.452 --> 01:12:57.912]  I don't know.
[01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.092]  Oh, you're suing vaccine manufacturers.
[01:13:15.112 --> 01:13:16.472]  We'll just make it where you can't sue them.
[01:13:16.973 --> 01:13:23.696]  Oh, you know, you don't like us instantly uploading everything you should, every prescription you get.
[01:13:23.736 --> 01:13:25.336]  Well, I'll just sign an executive order.
[01:13:25.676 --> 01:13:27.577]  I mean, people, you don't think you're being surveilled?
[01:13:27.617 --> 01:13:29.538]  Everything you do is instantly uploaded.
[01:13:29.798 --> 01:13:42.604]  And Alex, also, I've made several phone calls to the Congress and more so the Senators concerning the Patriot Act and, of course, concerning the federal law or the federal rulings, court rulings,
[01:13:43.123 --> 01:14:10.426]  Certain provisions were unconstitutional and of course the Senate just filibustered the Patriot Act for now and I don't know what they're going to do about it but there's a lot of things going on that people need to realize and Alex, if you go to freewebs.com forward slash top issues again that's F-R-E-E-W-E-B-S dot com forward slash type in top issues freewebs.com
[01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.253]  Okay, that three times is enough.
[01:14:12.273 --> 01:14:12.774]  Okay, I gotta go.
[01:14:12.794 --> 01:14:13.374]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:39.335 --> 01:14:40.256]  Here's the problem.
[01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:43.698]  Everything is terrorism under Section 802, sir.
[01:14:43.858 --> 01:14:48.221]  Trying to influence government, influence politicians, period, is terrorism.
[01:14:49.122 --> 01:14:51.023]  Any misdemeanor crime is terrorism.
[01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:55.872]  In the first Patriot Act definition of H.R.
[01:14:56.072 --> 01:14:57.712]  3162, so that's the problem.
[01:14:58.232 --> 01:15:04.094]  I mean, it is a crime what Bush did using the NSA without even getting the blank check mass warrants.
[01:15:04.114 --> 01:15:06.555]  I mean, before it was just get a blank check.
[01:15:06.615 --> 01:15:08.036]  That got rid of the 4th Amendment right there.
[01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:11.877]  Oh, just, you know, here, every time I give you one of these, you can surveil 10,000 people.
[01:15:11.937 --> 01:15:12.177]  Randomly.
[01:15:14.756 --> 01:15:15.176]  Okay.
[01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:23.603]  Or, or, oh, we surveil the entire population every day, but we just call it training, or we call it data mining and put it into statistical algorithms.
[01:15:23.924 --> 01:15:24.564]  Same thing.
[01:15:25.465 --> 01:15:27.446]  But interesting points there, Jeff.
[01:15:27.506 --> 01:15:31.470]  I'm just trying to go to calls quickly, which I'm not good at doing, but we're trying here.
[01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:33.031]  Cayman in New York.
[01:15:33.091 --> 01:15:33.852]  Cayman, go ahead.
[01:15:33.872 --> 01:15:35.153]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:35.793]  How you doing?
[01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:36.774]  Good, sir.
[01:15:36.934 --> 01:15:37.635]  First time in a long time.
[01:15:38.235 --> 01:15:38.615]  Check it out.
[01:15:38.836 --> 01:15:40.177]  I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
[01:15:40.297 --> 01:15:44.220]  One time you said on your program that Bill Clinton was a CIA agent.
[01:15:45.134 --> 01:15:46.236]  Some sort?
[01:15:46.316 --> 01:15:48.018]  Clearly an intelligence operative, yes.
[01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:54.807]  Yeah, I want to be able to find that somewhere, like some type of a proof, like an article stating something like that.
[01:15:54.827 --> 01:15:55.688]  Where would I find that?
[01:15:56.992 --> 01:16:09.339]  Well, I can dig up research papers and research showing that he has operated as an intelligence asset, clearly under known intelligence assets, clearly under government agents at a very young age he was being handled.
[01:16:10.439 --> 01:16:12.561]  I mean, you can't get the documents that Bush Sr.
[01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:13.201]  was CIA by 1951.
[01:16:17.163 --> 01:16:21.187]  But it's well known that he was, and then magically became CIA Director.
[01:16:21.227 --> 01:16:28.915]  It's now come out that Porter Goss, the entire time he was in Congress, even before he ran, has been a CIA mole in the Congress.
[01:16:29.235 --> 01:16:30.377]  He's now CIA Director.
[01:16:30.797 --> 01:16:35.522]  It's now admitted that Tony Blair was working for MI5 and MI6 from the time he was in college.
[01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:39.184]  Vladimir Putin was former KGB.
[01:16:41.145 --> 01:16:45.747]  Look at Ariel Sharon, former intelligence and military commander.
[01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:46.448]  They all are.
[01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:49.850]  Where specifically would I have to look?
[01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.931]  A lot of this stuff comes from sources.
[01:16:51.951 --> 01:16:58.875]  I have personally interviewed multiple CIA officers on record, mid-level CIA officers, high level over operations.
[01:17:00.155 --> 01:17:14.240]  That is high level on their echelon, officer level, in the CIA who knew that Bill Clinton was involved with the Bush's as an operative in the massive cocaine running from the day one of being governor of Arkansas.
[01:17:14.621 --> 01:17:15.881]  So there's evidence right there.
[01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:18.782]  One other thing before you tell me.
[01:17:19.122 --> 01:17:20.823]  Sir, do you know what founded the CIA?
[01:17:22.358 --> 01:17:22.598]  Excuse me?
[01:17:23.099 --> 01:17:24.961]  Do you know what founded the CIA?
[01:17:25.662 --> 01:17:27.204]  Drug money, Skull & Bones?
[01:17:27.404 --> 01:17:29.847]  OSS through the Russell Trust, Skull & Bones.
[01:17:30.447 --> 01:17:35.093]  Our CIA was set up on an MI6, Her Majesty's Intelligence Network system.
[01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:37.795]  Can you know what set that up over there?
[01:17:37.895 --> 01:17:45.957]  The Rhodes Trust, Cecil Rhodes, Rhodesia, the Diamond Monopoly, the Queen of England.
[01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:53.378]  It's clear that Clinton was under globalist, Illuminati tutelage from the time he left high school, perhaps even younger.
[01:17:54.619 --> 01:18:01.640]  We know clearly that his mother was a whore and that he was the illegitimate son of one of two Rockefellers.
[01:18:02.176 --> 01:18:02.616]  Wow.
[01:18:03.017 --> 01:18:03.898]  Wow, that's insane.
[01:18:04.098 --> 01:18:05.099]  That's a whole other show.
[01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.060]  We've done those shows.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.043]  It's on the web if you want it.
[01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:14.007]  Hold on, let me finish answering your question because it's a big one.
[01:18:14.427 --> 01:18:18.791]  Right now we know that the Bush's called Bill Clinton their son, that he vacations with them, right?
[01:18:19.497 --> 01:18:19.637]  Yeah.
[01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:36.349]  It's a charity scam, right?
[01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:40.254]  They're laughing at us, sir.
[01:18:40.614 --> 01:18:41.956]  I mean, it's a staged event.
[01:18:42.416 --> 01:18:45.279]  You know Kerry and Bush are cousins, members of the same secret society.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.602]  It's the same thing, sir.
[01:18:47.742 --> 01:18:48.723]  Stay there, okay?
[01:18:49.043 --> 01:18:50.025]  It's the same thing.
[01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.492]  Government of death which governs these.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.321]  Wake up and smell the fascism!
[01:18:58.762 --> 01:19:01.484]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:19:01.925 --> 01:19:04.567]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:19:05.008 --> 01:19:11.474]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:19:46.647 --> 01:19:47.811]  Oh, some have been forgotten.

[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:57.052]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:55.828]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.249 --> 01:21:00.611]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:00.891 --> 01:21:06.695]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:06.935 --> 01:21:10.978]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.278 --> 01:21:16.481]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:18.182]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:21.724 --> 01:21:25.626]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:28.047]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:28.387 --> 01:21:30.708]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:31.069 --> 01:21:34.690]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:41.374]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:41.834 --> 01:21:42.814]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.154 --> 01:21:43.475]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.495 --> 01:21:43.675]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:56.093]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:56.694 --> 01:21:58.457]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:59.622 --> 01:22:07.510]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.372]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'
[01:22:10.352 --> 01:22:11.774]  's patented methodology.

[01:22:25.605 --> 01:22:26.865]  That's www.L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C.com.
[01:22:26.885 --> 01:22:28.766]  Or, call LaysMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:22:57.037 --> 01:22:58.978]  All right, let's go back to Cayman in New York.
[01:22:58.998 --> 01:23:00.279]  He had one more question.
[01:23:00.299 --> 01:23:01.040]  Cayman, go ahead.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.601]  Alex, thanks a lot, man.
[01:23:03.101 --> 01:23:03.421]  Check it out.
[01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:04.282]  Thank you for calling.
[01:23:04.322 --> 01:23:04.962]  Thank you for listening.
[01:23:04.982 --> 01:23:06.243]  Go ahead.
[01:23:06.283 --> 01:23:07.524]  There was one more question I had.
[01:23:07.544 --> 01:23:13.949]  I don't know if I read it on your website or on another one, but there was this mainstream article.
[01:23:14.029 --> 01:23:24.376]  It was an NBC article talking about how one of the airplanes had supposedly either crashed into the Pentagon or the one that was flying over Pennsylvania, but it landed in Ohio.
[01:23:25.316 --> 01:23:26.117]  And they had
[01:23:26.784 --> 01:23:29.510]  There were early reports that it actually landed in an Ohio airport.
[01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:33.398]  I don't know if I... Yeah, we have Peter Jennings saying that we have that report.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.343]  Scott, can you think you can find that?
[01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:41.135]  Poor Scott, he's got like an improperly labeled thing with like 500 plus clips in it.
[01:23:41.936 --> 01:23:43.277]  Lord knows what it says in there.
[01:23:44.699 --> 01:23:45.720]  We actually have that clip.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.541]  If we can dig it up, we'll play it for you later.
[01:23:48.082 --> 01:23:54.268]  You know, I've gotten some into that, but I don't get too far into things that can never be proven one way or the other.
[01:23:54.308 --> 01:23:59.973]  They claim, the mayor claimed, that Flight 93 really was diverted and did land.
[01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:08.692]  Because of a bomb problem, but that could have been during the panic as the news had come of the Pentagon and then the World Trade Centers being hit.
[01:24:09.932 --> 01:24:13.854]  But we try to talk to the mayor and others, they're very tight-lipped about it and act very strange.
[01:24:14.894 --> 01:24:18.836]  And we get caught up in the minutiae of the things that we can't prove.
[01:24:20.271 --> 01:24:23.275]  And everybody loves a mystery, then we don't prove the case.
[01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:28.981]  If we stick to what we can prove, just like it's a police murder investigation, they warn public officials not to fly.
[01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:32.465]  We know the supposed hijackers were being protected by the government.
[01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:36.169]  Not just that they were being protected, but that they were government assets.
[01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.850]  We have total
[01:24:37.746 --> 01:24:41.629]  Iron-clad, 110% gold-proof.
[01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.192]  Okay, just dead-on, no debate.
[01:24:44.852 --> 01:24:48.055]  In-triplicate, up one side and down the other, from every different angle you can imagine.
[01:24:48.115 --> 01:24:48.915]  It's ridiculous.
[01:24:49.256 --> 01:24:50.417]  Hundreds of cases of evidence.
[01:24:51.257 --> 01:24:53.099]  Then we have clearly bombs in the buildings.
[01:24:53.119 --> 01:24:54.440]  The owners saying they blew it up.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:59.244]  The blast points as the explosions go off in Building 7 and in Tower 1 and 2.
[01:25:00.105 --> 01:25:01.586]  We have NORAD standing down.
[01:25:01.646 --> 01:25:03.387]  We have Cheney taking control.
[01:25:04.008 --> 01:25:06.110]  We have all of those points
[01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:08.151]  And there's hundreds of them.
[01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:10.613]  And those are the points that no one wants to focus on.
[01:25:11.453 --> 01:25:12.894]  Thanks a lot, Alex, for your help.
[01:25:13.034 --> 01:25:14.095]  You're doing a great job, man.
[01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:15.236]  Well, thank you, Kamin.
[01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.137]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:16.197 --> 01:25:21.380]  And yes, it would be nice if the mainstream media would do an article about Bill Clinton being an intelligence asset.
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.301]  We know Bush is.
[01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:24.002]  That is his father.
[01:25:24.102 --> 01:25:25.343]  We know Bush Jr.
[01:25:25.383 --> 01:25:26.884]  has always basically been his minion.
[01:25:27.324 --> 01:25:31.447]  Even when his dad was CIA director, Bush, he was doing some work for him in the early 70s.
[01:25:32.348 --> 01:25:33.288]  We know Putin is.
[01:25:33.348 --> 01:25:34.749]  We know Blair is.
[01:25:34.769 --> 01:25:35.710]  This is all admitted now.
[01:25:36.599 --> 01:25:41.002]  With Clinton, we know that from high school, he was groomed.
[01:25:41.062 --> 01:25:42.203]  He was on the fast track.
[01:25:42.383 --> 01:25:42.763]  We know that.
[01:25:43.164 --> 01:25:46.846]  I mean, I saw him give the Freedom Award to David Rockefeller and he started crying.
[01:25:46.886 --> 01:25:51.009]  He goes, there were only two people in 1968 that thought I could be president.
[01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:52.871]  My mama.
[01:25:53.391 --> 01:26:01.357]  And he looked at David Rockefeller and he said, and David Rockefeller, thank you, David Rockefeller.
[01:26:02.678 --> 01:26:06.000]  So, you know, that's the type of stuff that goes on out there.
[01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:24.820]  And then he's sent as a Rhodes Scholar, and then he's at Georgetown, which is a major government operation, under Carol Quigley, who admitted he was basically an officer of the New World Order, wrote a book about it, about how they control communism and fascism, and how it's all controlled to bring in the synthesis.
[01:26:26.662 --> 01:26:27.502]  This is what's happening.
[01:26:28.363 --> 01:26:30.845]  Let's go to Jim Hung Up.
[01:26:30.925 --> 01:26:31.826]  So let's go to Bob.
[01:26:31.846 --> 01:26:33.668]  Bob, where are you calling us from?
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:36.340]  Texas, hello?
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.060]  Welcome, sir.
[01:26:37.421 --> 01:26:41.862]  Texas, there are two things, and I know how much you like proof.
[01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:51.425]  There is documented evidence that the NSA, New World Order, has surveillance capabilities that are more advanced than your worst nightmares.
[01:26:51.585 --> 01:27:03.048]  And number two, this eavesdropping scandal that's going on right now, controversy, whatever you want to call it, I think it is a falling out between the neocons who are compromised and blackmailed,
[01:27:03.766 --> 01:27:07.547]  And the State of Israel, both of whom participated in the atrocities of 9-11.
[01:27:09.247 --> 01:27:15.089]  Well, every administration we have, foreign governments, especially Israel, blackmailing and leveraging, that's public.
[01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:18.029]  And I would agree that they want to send the U.S.
[01:27:18.089 --> 01:27:26.091]  on a suicide mission, and the neocons are knowing that it will destroy them, and so there's some balking, and so there's some public spanking going on right now.
[01:27:26.604 --> 01:27:33.329]  Well, as to the surveillance capabilities, there's documented proof going back to 1929 by Dr. Henry Moray.
[01:27:33.349 --> 01:27:34.510]  You're familiar with him, aren't you?
[01:27:35.731 --> 01:27:37.792]  Dr. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City, Utah?
[01:27:37.912 --> 01:27:38.953]  Not a little bit, not really.
[01:27:39.273 --> 01:27:46.379]  Well, he had a device with which he could tune into a conversation with no intervening conventional circuitry of any kind.
[01:27:46.419 --> 01:27:53.304]  In other words, he could vector into the space that you occupy and extract the disturbance in the air of your speech.
[01:27:54.195 --> 01:28:00.158]  With no intervening circuitry of any kind, and number two, he also had a device where he could actually... Yeah, well, that's been patented.
[01:28:00.198 --> 01:28:01.059]  It can be duplicated.
[01:28:01.599 --> 01:28:05.801]  And he also had a device where he could actually detect mental activity.
[01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:06.822]  We're talking about 1929.
[01:28:07.362 --> 01:28:18.648]  We're talking 75 years ahead of any... Well, there's a lot of scientists who claim they developed this or claim they developed that, and I'm not going to... I mean, something I'm ignorant on, I'm not going to debate with you.
[01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:19.689]  I mean, they have passive
[01:28:20.309 --> 01:28:21.950]  MRI's now that do do that.
[01:28:22.671 --> 01:28:25.373]  These are affidavits that are signed and witnessed.
[01:28:26.514 --> 01:28:27.535]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[01:28:27.555 --> 01:28:29.296]  Very interesting there, Bob in Texas.
[01:28:30.157 --> 01:28:37.162]  Steve and Eddie and Andy and John and everybody else, your calls are coming up in a ton of news.
[01:28:37.382 --> 01:28:41.685]  Oh, Vicente Fox wants his troops basically to revolt here in the U.S.
[01:28:41.705 --> 01:28:42.346]  We'll tell you about it.
[01:28:43.707 --> 01:28:44.607]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.108 --> 01:28:46.589]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.595 --> 01:28:50.356]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.638 --> 01:28:56.019]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.259 --> 01:29:00.101]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.421 --> 01:29:01.242]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.662 --> 01:29:05.784]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.004 --> 01:29:10.206]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.567 --> 01:29:15.449]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:19.391]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.591 --> 01:29:24.933]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.213 --> 01:29:27.934]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:29.134]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:29.435 --> 01:29:40.159]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[01:29:40.539 --> 01:29:45.980]  Call CalBen toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.461]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:55.163]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.283 --> 01:29:59.404]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.524 --> 01:30:02.404]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:09.146]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.366 --> 01:30:09.626]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:25.179 --> 01:30:34.581]  More MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:42.202]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.242 --> 01:30:42.502]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.522 --> 01:30:43.863]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:30:53.894 --> 01:30:56.696]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:30:56.816 --> 01:31:01.879]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:31:02.119 --> 01:31:08.282]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:14.146]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:31:14.466 --> 01:31:19.973]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:31:20.213 --> 01:31:24.058]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:29.345]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:31:29.545 --> 01:31:29.745]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:32.148 --> 01:31:36.211]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:40.534]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:31:40.734 --> 01:31:43.656]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[01:31:43.856 --> 01:31:48.739]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com and order today.
[01:31:48.979 --> 01:31:51.301]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!
[01:31:58.223 --> 01:32:00.123]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:03.404]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.464 --> 01:32:15.347]  We're going to continue with your calls after I get into what's happening in Mexico due to the House passing a bill that would build a meager security fence over part of the southern border.
[01:32:16.947 --> 01:32:22.308]  And Bush is vowing to add total amnesty to it so they won't need a fence anymore, they'll all be legal.
[01:32:23.377 --> 01:32:26.719]  But we'll get into that and several other issues and then get back to your calls.
[01:32:26.739 --> 01:32:27.819]  And I want to spend more time on this.
[01:32:27.879 --> 01:32:31.261]  Chinese police bring villagers to heel after the latest uprising.
[01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:37.204]  See, the whole attitude now is they're not standing up against tyranny, having their land taken by the communist Chinese thugs.
[01:32:37.644 --> 01:32:40.625]  Now it's, hmm, Chinese are doing pretty good.
[01:32:40.665 --> 01:32:43.187]  Communist Chinese dealing with them troublemakers.
[01:32:43.647 --> 01:32:46.588]  Gee, I wish we had some good cops like that over here.
[01:32:47.569 --> 01:32:48.729]  So that's kind of the attitude.
[01:32:48.769 --> 01:32:52.291]  Before I cover that and go back to your calls,
[01:32:54.315 --> 01:32:56.036]  Several issues.
[01:32:57.177 --> 01:33:01.980]  This is the last day today you can get two-day delivery.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:02.740]  Free!
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:06.823]  And that's like $55 for a big Berkey, normally what that would be.
[01:33:07.903 --> 01:33:10.425]  It goes between $50 and $60 depending on where in the U.S.
[01:33:10.545 --> 01:33:11.185]  The point is it's around $55.
[01:33:12.526 --> 01:33:13.327]  Normally shipping is like $18.
[01:33:13.947 --> 01:33:15.468]  They ship it to your UPS ground.
[01:33:15.488 --> 01:33:16.849]  Well right now they're giving you free!
[01:33:16.869 --> 01:33:18.370]  So you don't have to pay for the shipping, the $18.
[01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:18.610]  Free!
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:31.828]  Today, UPS guaranteed shipping on their $199 Big Berkey with the black elements, does tens of thousands of gallons, cuts out all the toxins, all the poisons.
[01:33:32.418 --> 01:33:33.559]  Just an amazing system.
[01:33:33.659 --> 01:33:34.700]  I use it personally.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.543]  They have the stainless steel models with black elements as well if you want those 2 day.
[01:33:39.163 --> 01:33:41.085]  Any of your orders, 2 day folks.
[01:33:41.565 --> 01:33:47.350]  They got sports bottle deals that make the water safe, cut out most of the toxins and poisons and bacteria.
[01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:49.191]  You can even use swamp water through these.
[01:33:49.592 --> 01:33:51.493]  Hundreds and hundreds of refills.
[01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:55.076]  600 plus tap water refills, 130 swamp waters.
[01:33:55.777 --> 01:33:57.018]  Until you can't use it anymore.
[01:33:57.478 --> 01:33:59.920]  Great thing for survival, but a great thing when you go to the restaurant.
[01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:01.837]  Just pour your iced tea in it.
[01:34:01.857 --> 01:34:03.599]  Pour your water in it.
[01:34:03.619 --> 01:34:04.500]  Stop drinking.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.442]  The tap water is so poisonous, folks.
[01:34:06.462 --> 01:34:07.443]  We've done old shows on this.
[01:34:07.503 --> 01:34:10.487]  It's just amazing how bad it is.
[01:34:11.648 --> 01:34:13.250]  And there's more and more stuff in there every day.
[01:34:14.492 --> 01:34:16.174]  Debbie's there right now to take your call.
[01:34:16.314 --> 01:34:16.895]  The phone's busy.
[01:34:16.935 --> 01:34:18.637]  Leave a message and she'll call you right back.
[01:34:19.412 --> 01:34:21.093]  And they are the national makers of this.
[01:34:21.133 --> 01:34:22.314]  They are the distributors of this.
[01:34:22.514 --> 01:34:33.642]  They supply, I think they said they have like 300 people that buy in bulk stores and camping supply places and the military and stuff like that and missionary groups.
[01:34:34.142 --> 01:34:37.044]  So they have Debbie just for the radio interviews.
[01:34:37.344 --> 01:34:43.108]  Debbie, one of their managers, just to take calls from this show.
[01:34:44.031 --> 01:34:56.563]  And so give, and a few other shows she does, so give Debbie a call, and her assistant there, 1-888-803-4438.
[01:34:56.583 --> 01:34:56.923]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:34:58.084 --> 01:35:01.908]  And not only is it made in America, we have a $10,000 a month shortwave bill.
[01:35:01.928 --> 01:35:02.768]  Yes, we pay for that.
[01:35:02.788 --> 01:35:07.473]  We don't pay for AM and FM stations, but we have to pay for the shortwave because it's the international outreach.
[01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:16.197]  And I get letters from India, and letters from China, and letters from Africa, and letters from places like Egypt and Mexico, and people on cruise ships listening.
[01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:19.460]  I mean, it is a big audience, and it's international.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.741]  It's an outreach we do.
[01:35:21.281 --> 01:35:25.184]  And New Millennium, ladies and gentlemen, they fit the bill for that.
[01:35:25.925 --> 01:35:28.087]  And they just do an amazing job.
[01:35:28.147 --> 01:35:29.408]  So you get at a discount.
[01:35:30.429 --> 01:35:33.111]  Manufacturer prices, you know, direct.
[01:35:33.823 --> 01:35:36.807]  It's made in America, and it supports the international outreach.
[01:35:36.887 --> 01:35:41.893]  It doesn't matter if you don't listen on the shortwave, you listen on the internet, or a local Amoretum affiliate, which is just wonderful.
[01:35:42.354 --> 01:35:42.814]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:42.834 --> 01:35:45.377]  You're still supporting that international outreach.
[01:35:45.397 --> 01:35:49.843]  You know, the real voice of America, really telling the truth, really warning the people.
[01:35:50.604 --> 01:35:51.725]  Of what's happening.
[01:35:51.805 --> 01:35:53.787]  And believe me, it's got the Globalist hopping mad.
[01:35:54.407 --> 01:36:00.232]  So, 1-888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com.
[01:36:00.252 --> 01:36:01.393]  That's BerkeyWater.com.

[01:36:17.185 --> 01:36:17.525]  All right.
[01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:44.142]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to briefly tell you that we got PrisonPlanet.tv with all my films, 14 of them, all my weekly TV reports, hundreds of them, hundreds of my best audio interviews, special video reports from England, special reports from Crawford, special reports on weather warfare with the father of weather warfare, Ben Livingston, physicist Ben Livingston, just all of it.
[01:36:45.606 --> 01:36:48.370]  There is so much there, so much more that's going to be there.
[01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:50.793]  We're now going into our second year here in about two months.
[01:36:50.813 --> 01:36:51.454]  It'll be two years.
[01:36:52.856 --> 01:36:59.685]  I want to thank all the members that are there, but right now you can get a yearly membership and get five plus months free.
[01:36:59.805 --> 01:37:01.027]  Almost half a year free.

[01:37:04.262 --> 01:37:08.503]  When you get a yearly membership right now, that's only going to the first of the year, so take advantage of that.
[01:37:08.803 --> 01:37:13.724]  Or call toll free to get any of my documentaries or any of the books or videos we carry that can answer all your questions.
[01:37:13.744 --> 01:37:14.385]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:37:14.425 --> 01:37:14.665]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:37:25.108 --> 01:37:27.672]  On Saturday they might get it on Monday or Tuesday.
[01:37:28.112 --> 01:37:31.998]  Now it's not guaranteed UPS ground to get to you by Christmas if you order today.
[01:37:32.459 --> 01:37:37.827]  But if you want to give it as a gift, you forgot to give your cousin or your neighbor or your grandpa or your son or your daughter a gift.
[01:37:38.453 --> 01:37:41.235]  Or you've already given them some other gifts but you want to give them something that really counts.
[01:37:41.735 --> 01:37:47.198]  Go put their address and information and even a little note to them in the comments section on the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:47.218 --> 01:37:47.759]  You can do that.
[01:37:48.099 --> 01:37:52.021]  And we'll put your note in there to them and we will mail it to them and they'll get it right after Christmas.
[01:37:52.381 --> 01:37:54.683]  In some areas they'll get it before Christmas but it's not guaranteed.
[01:37:55.715 --> 01:38:06.704]  So, that's available at InfoWars.com to send them hard copies or you can simply call them up or email them the passcodes and their membership to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:07.245 --> 01:38:08.486]  Give them a monthly subscription!
[01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.712]  And then if they like it, they can continue to subscribe themselves.
[01:38:12.772 --> 01:38:14.093]  Or if they like it, you can buy them a year.
[01:38:14.754 --> 01:38:15.915]  Use it as an activist tool.
[01:38:15.955 --> 01:38:18.717]  Go there and download the videos, the books, the materials.
[01:38:18.797 --> 01:38:19.738]  Burn them on CDs.
[01:38:19.778 --> 01:38:20.519]  Give them to people.
[01:38:20.919 --> 01:38:26.244]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just an amazing activist tool, and I want to thank all of you that are supporters of it.
[01:38:27.505 --> 01:38:29.046]  And I don't talk enough about this.
[01:38:29.787 --> 01:38:33.630]  We've got so many new affiliates signing affiliate relations agreements and turning on the show.
[01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:34.771]  I need to announce those guys.
[01:38:36.186 --> 01:38:39.868]  But I need to get all the affiliates' names and call signs first.
[01:38:40.028 --> 01:38:42.170]  We're all a little busy and I forget to do that sometimes.
[01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:42.850]  I apologize.
[01:38:43.350 --> 01:39:02.201]  But all of our old affiliates, like WBCR in Tennessee, or KCXL in Kansas City, or the Sunshine Network, three great affiliates up in upstate New York, or WVTJ in Pensacola, Florida, or our fine station out in Southern California.
[01:39:03.219 --> 01:39:03.679]  All of them.
[01:39:03.699 --> 01:39:04.420]  There's so many of them.
[01:39:04.941 --> 01:39:06.023]  All of those stations.
[01:39:06.824 --> 01:39:10.049]  And stations that have been carrying us for a year or two years, you know, up in Illinois.
[01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:13.834]  If you're listening on AM or FM station, that is so precious.
[01:39:13.854 --> 01:39:15.216]  That is so wonderful.
[01:39:15.817 --> 01:39:17.079]  Tell people about it.
[01:39:17.643 --> 01:39:19.544]  Call the sponsors and thank them.
[01:39:20.065 --> 01:39:21.005]  Thank the station.
[01:39:21.045 --> 01:39:24.327]  If you have a local business, sponsor that local station.
[01:39:24.867 --> 01:39:27.089]  Thank them for carrying the show.
[01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:32.552]  Because the show is growing so much, I just want to thank all of our affiliates.
[01:39:33.192 --> 01:39:35.614]  And they should be rewarded for telling the truth.
[01:39:35.634 --> 01:39:37.035]  They should be blessed for telling the truth.
[01:39:37.255 --> 01:39:38.736]  For letting us defend this country.
[01:39:39.676 --> 01:39:42.318]  It's getting easier for stations to pick us up now.
[01:39:42.998 --> 01:39:45.720]  You tune in five years ago, I'm talking about the NSA listening to you.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.200]  I'm a coot.
[01:39:47.362 --> 01:39:49.803]  I tell you they're going to be trying to force you to take microchips.
[01:39:49.863 --> 01:39:50.303]  I'm a kook.
[01:39:50.723 --> 01:39:52.724]  I tell you they're going to be announcing how they want martial law.
[01:39:52.744 --> 01:39:53.144]  I'm a kook.
[01:39:53.304 --> 01:39:54.645]  Now it's on the nightly news.
[01:39:55.225 --> 01:39:56.746]  The difference is I say no, that's bad.
[01:39:57.206 --> 01:40:02.428]  The difference is the American people all hate this stuff and I agree with them.
[01:40:02.508 --> 01:40:03.348]  We're the majority.
[01:40:03.428 --> 01:40:04.609]  We have the majority view.
[01:40:04.909 --> 01:40:06.089]  We have the populist view.
[01:40:06.349 --> 01:40:07.890]  We have the pro-Second Amendment view.
[01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:09.110]  We have the pro-border view.
[01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:11.031]  But we're not little neocons.
[01:40:12.074 --> 01:40:16.619]  And so a lot of stations are turning us on right now because we've been vindicated.
[01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:18.021]  We've been proven right.
[01:40:18.341 --> 01:40:19.823]  We've been shown to be visionary.
[01:40:19.863 --> 01:40:26.010]  We've been shown to be cutting edge, on the ball, pioneers, trailblazers, cutting edge.
[01:40:27.612 --> 01:40:32.738]  You know, on the front lines of this, invading the New World Order, trying to take America back.
[01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:40.837]  And so to all the new affiliates, to all the old affiliates, I commend you, I thank you, I appreciate you, you're wonderful.
[01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:45.122]  And to the listeners, and to the folks at Genesis, the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:50.182]  You are doing just such a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful job.
[01:40:50.222 --> 01:41:01.045]  The host on Genesis, who don't get involved in all of the backbiting and the dirty laundry airing and all the trash that the other little wannabe networks do.
[01:41:01.505 --> 01:41:03.425]  Again, I commend the Genesis Network.
[01:41:03.445 --> 01:41:04.826]  You've done a fabulous job.
[01:41:07.486 --> 01:41:08.927]  It really is just that simple.
[01:41:09.867 --> 01:41:11.787]  Alright, I want to go to your calls.
[01:41:11.847 --> 01:41:13.628]  I said I'd cover some of this news and we need to.
[01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:24.166]  I just every day think about how thankful I am to be on the air, how honored I am to be able to talk to millions of people, to be on AM and FM stations all over the country, and to be growing.
[01:41:24.886 --> 01:41:25.987]  I mean, that's good news.
[01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:29.289]  I'm sorry, there is a lot of good stuff that is happening.
[01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:34.513]  You know, the fact that Bush is having to say, I'm not a king, I'm not a dictator.
[01:41:35.554 --> 01:41:38.356]  He's not snickering anymore, saying he wishes he was a dictator.
[01:41:39.097 --> 01:41:42.099]  The elite's trying to make him a dictator, and it isn't selling.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:43.500]  It's flopping.
[01:41:46.215 --> 01:41:47.895]  But I've got two reports here.
[01:41:47.995 --> 01:41:52.056]  One is ABC News, and the other is the Associated Press.
[01:41:54.096 --> 01:41:58.877]  Mexico promises to block border wall plan, promises to block the plan.
[01:41:59.637 --> 01:42:02.718]  And depending on which article you read, there's different quotes by Vicente Fox.
[01:42:02.778 --> 01:42:04.378]  In the Mexican newspapers, it's even worse.
[01:42:05.218 --> 01:42:07.459]  It says, we've got millions of our citizens there.
[01:42:07.539 --> 01:42:11.319]  Protest, demonstrate, lawsuits, get involved, get in the streets.
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.100]  A foreign leader.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.240]  I'm here looking at the quotes.
[01:42:15.918 --> 01:42:20.721]  A foreign leader is telling people to go to the streets to protest, to sue.
[01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:29.206]  A foreign leader is saying what we have to do is raise a storm of criticism and is already happening against this, he said, promising to turn the international community against the plan.
[01:42:29.706 --> 01:42:31.547]  International community telling us what to do.
[01:42:31.568 --> 01:42:33.589]  And let me find the other quotes here.
[01:42:34.909 --> 01:42:42.294]  Calling us shameful, calling us Nazis, telling his population to go into the streets to protest, to sue.
[01:42:43.194 --> 01:42:44.496]  There's different quotes in each article.
[01:42:44.516 --> 01:42:45.918]  I've got to find the full text of it.
[01:42:45.938 --> 01:42:46.839]  It's just horrible.
[01:42:46.859 --> 01:42:55.571]  A foreign leader who has tens of millions, at least 20 million, it's got to be more, dual citizens, another
[01:42:56.417 --> 01:42:59.058]  Fifteen to thirty million, depending on what federal number you look at.
[01:42:59.078 --> 01:43:01.199]  I believe the thirty million number before I believe the fifteen.
[01:43:01.539 --> 01:43:03.639]  You ought to see it here, folks.
[01:43:03.659 --> 01:43:05.940]  There's more illegal aliens than there are Americans.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.501]  And I mean Americans who are black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:11.362]  I mean, you see, illegal aliens are everywhere.
[01:43:11.402 --> 01:43:14.543]  You can't get a job in most places if you're not an illegal alien.
[01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:21.705]  And I mean illegal aliens from India and China and Russia taking all the jobs who will work for twenty percent of
[01:43:22.345 --> 01:43:23.546]  And we're losing our benefits.
[01:43:23.566 --> 01:43:24.806]  We're losing our jobs.
[01:43:25.226 --> 01:43:26.667]  Everybody's losing their health care.
[01:43:26.687 --> 01:43:33.369]  I mean, I know people with three degrees who are making $200,000 a year, five years ago, who were snickering and laughing at me.
[01:43:33.889 --> 01:43:35.249]  You know, old friends of mine from college.
[01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:36.930]  They're freaking out now, folks.
[01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:38.330]  They're working at HEB.
[01:43:39.111 --> 01:43:41.251]  They're working at auto parts stores.
[01:43:41.271 --> 01:43:45.693]  They're working three jobs, trying to hang on, trying to pay that mortgage.
[01:43:47.163 --> 01:43:49.025]  And folks, that's not the American way.
[01:43:49.045 --> 01:43:51.388]  The American way is working hard and getting ahead.
[01:43:51.909 --> 01:43:53.050]  Is innovating.
[01:43:53.631 --> 01:43:54.532]  That's the American way.
[01:43:54.592 --> 01:43:55.473]  Working smart.
[01:43:56.534 --> 01:43:58.577]  We're totally being sanguinated.
[01:43:58.597 --> 01:44:00.258]  We're being sucked dry.
[01:44:00.319 --> 01:44:03.122]  The country has turned into a scrofulous wart.
[01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:06.566]  And every indicator, every real indices,
[01:44:07.486 --> 01:44:13.931]  It's plunging, and I don't want to hear, oh, we have the best year of the last five years for growth, 4.1.
[01:44:14.191 --> 01:44:18.874]  That's with all the jacked up numbers calling fast food restaurants manufacturing.
[01:44:18.954 --> 01:44:22.056]  It's just, it's all baloney numbers.
[01:44:22.096 --> 01:44:30.062]  And I've had two of Reagan and Bush, senior Ann Bush, the current Bush's top economist on telling you it's pure baloney.
[01:44:31.303 --> 01:44:33.744]  I mean, it's just, it's la-la land.
[01:44:33.784 --> 01:44:35.185]  It's all la-la land.
[01:44:35.725 --> 01:44:38.846]  Meanwhile, we, I mean, do you want to live like they do in Mexico, folks?
[01:44:38.866 --> 01:44:39.526]  Because you're going to.
[01:44:40.246 --> 01:44:41.067]  And this doesn't stop.
[01:44:41.107 --> 01:44:42.387]  In fact, it's probably already too late.
[01:44:43.328 --> 01:44:43.548]  Okay?
[01:44:43.588 --> 01:44:44.908]  And the government and the elite just loves it.
[01:44:44.928 --> 01:44:46.329]  We're all going to be little peons.
[01:44:46.529 --> 01:44:48.830]  We're all going to be poor, with no chance of digging out.
[01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:51.131]  And I mean, if you want that, fine.
[01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:58.493]  You're going to get, you're really, you can have your La Reconquista pride, and the liberals can, you know, America's bad needs to be balkanized.
[01:44:58.513 --> 01:44:59.754]  You can have your little attitude.
[01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:05.734]  And wear your little knit cap and go to your coffee shops and feel liberal about yourself, but your future is gone.
[01:45:05.774 --> 01:45:06.495]  Do you understand?
[01:45:07.455 --> 01:45:10.377]  If you don't stop it now, this is globalization.
[01:45:11.658 --> 01:45:14.881]  And here is Vicente Fox telling us what to do.
[01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:23.207]  Here is Vicente Fox getting in our face, telling his people who he lets have dual citizenship to influence our political process.
[01:45:24.432 --> 01:45:26.414]  Saying that he controls our process.
[01:45:26.774 --> 01:45:30.436]  Saying that, saying that they're going to, he says, quote, where is it?
[01:45:31.477 --> 01:45:37.101]  Vicente Fox, quote, he promises to, quote, block border wall plan.
[01:45:39.423 --> 01:45:41.304]  Telling his people to go to the streets.
[01:45:42.385 --> 01:45:43.206]  What does that mean?
[01:45:44.907 --> 01:45:45.587]  You know what it means.
[01:45:45.627 --> 01:45:47.449]  Believe me, your people have gone to the streets.
[01:45:48.089 --> 01:45:51.311]  South Texas is a ghost town in many areas, shutting down.
[01:45:51.371 --> 01:45:52.732]  Yes, you've really gone to the streets.
[01:45:52.772 --> 01:45:53.313]  Yes, you have.
[01:45:56.562 --> 01:46:04.487]  Again, I don't care what color you are, folks, but I don't have any guilt, I don't have any weird liberalness, you know.
[01:46:04.827 --> 01:46:21.458]  It's a third world country with about ten other third world countries underneath it, doubling their population every thirty years in Latin America, and they all want to come here, and Big Ford Foundation money, same folks that funded Hitler, by the way, Big Ford Foundation money is down there telling them that this is theirs.
[01:46:24.582 --> 01:46:25.122]  And it isn't.
[01:46:25.643 --> 01:46:34.867]  The only person down there isn't going along with it is Hugo Chavez, and he says Napkin Gats evil, and he says that this whole menialization of our borders is to take them over.
[01:46:35.127 --> 01:46:36.567]  And boy is he right, exactly.
[01:46:36.587 --> 01:46:46.972]  The elite, this is going to hurt Mexico, it's going to hurt Venezuela, it's going to hurt Colombia, it's going to hurt Chile, it's going to hurt Brazil, it's going to hurt Nicaragua, it's going to hurt Ecuador, it's going to hurt all of you!
[01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:51.692]  It's going to hurt Belize, it's going to hurt all of it.
[01:46:52.232 --> 01:46:55.294]  It's not going to help anybody but the elite.
[01:46:55.794 --> 01:47:01.677]  It is openly to drive us down into third world status and to keep Latin America in third world status.
[01:47:03.638 --> 01:47:12.223]  And now Vicente Fox has got the gall, he's got the nerve to sit up there and start threatening our country, telling us what to do.
[01:47:12.664 --> 01:47:14.364]  Deport the illegal aliens now!
[01:47:16.718 --> 01:47:18.159]  Get them out of our country!
[01:47:18.599 --> 01:47:26.523]  They're running around, waving Mexican flags, with Invasion, La Reconquista, Plan of San Diego stickers on their cars, and I'm sick of it!
[01:47:28.844 --> 01:47:30.525]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:47:31.186 --> 01:47:35.788]  Steve in Pennsylvania, then Eddie, Andy, John, Nathaniel, Mike, and others.
[01:47:36.128 --> 01:47:37.229]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Steve.
[01:47:38.069 --> 01:47:38.509]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:38.529 --> 01:47:39.710]  It's been a long time, listening.
[01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.390]  Welcome.
[01:47:40.731 --> 01:47:41.591]  I just had a question.
[01:47:41.611 --> 01:47:42.872]  I don't know if it's true or not.
[01:47:43.012 --> 01:47:44.973]  Basically, with all our jobs we want overseas,
[01:47:45.836 --> 01:47:49.098]  How many Americans are actually calling overseas, not realizing it?
[01:47:51.479 --> 01:47:52.299]  Oh, routinely.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.942]  I forget the numbers, but it's soon to approach the majority.
[01:47:56.962 --> 01:47:58.703]  In fact, I saw the number a few months ago.
[01:47:58.743 --> 01:48:04.586]  I believe it's already the majority of customer service calls are going to India.
[01:48:06.447 --> 01:48:06.787]  All right.
[01:48:06.807 --> 01:48:08.828]  That's all I need to know, though.
[01:48:08.848 --> 01:48:09.548]  Keep up the good work.
[01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.329]  All right.
[01:48:10.349 --> 01:48:11.149]  I appreciate it, sir.
[01:48:13.423 --> 01:48:19.108]  Don't forget there are millions and millions of people in the prison industries, and you call up and give your credit card to them and stuff.
[01:48:19.148 --> 01:48:21.831]  Did you know a lot of those travel agents and stuff are actually prisoners?
[01:48:22.471 --> 01:48:25.113]  Oh yeah, good, make them criminals work!
[01:48:25.173 --> 01:48:27.275]  Yeah, for twenty cents an hour, taking our jobs.
[01:48:28.756 --> 01:48:29.877]  I dislike that even more.
[01:48:30.318 --> 01:48:32.680]  I mean, an illegal alien will work for four bucks an hour.
[01:48:35.482 --> 01:48:39.746]  So, I dislike them less than I dislike the prisons.
[01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:43.162]  I mean, nobody can compete.
[01:48:43.962 --> 01:48:45.262]  Not even slaves in China.
[01:48:45.282 --> 01:48:49.043]  By the time they have the shipping cost over here, slaves in China can't compete.
[01:48:50.344 --> 01:48:51.364]  No one can compete.
[01:48:51.404 --> 01:48:52.345]  That's the new phase.
[01:48:54.145 --> 01:48:54.765]  We're going to break.
[01:48:55.065 --> 01:48:56.286]  Let's just get him started right now.
[01:48:56.386 --> 01:48:59.067]  Eddie and England, start your comment, then I'm going to let you comment on the other side.
[01:48:59.087 --> 01:48:59.527]  Go ahead, Eddie.
[01:49:00.947 --> 01:49:03.828]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:04.168 --> 01:49:08.890]  Your last caller, as regards to being moved to India, we got it exactly the same here.
[01:49:10.245 --> 01:49:13.846]  Nearly all the big companies have moved all their call centers into India.
[01:49:14.126 --> 01:49:20.627]  And all we've got is our fiat currency left that they're accepting to buy their goods, and when that's gone, we've got nothing.
[01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:21.747]  You're right.
[01:49:22.207 --> 01:49:26.028]  And your previous caller, was it Taman or Karman?
[01:49:26.848 --> 01:49:29.509]  It was Cayman, Laz, and Cayman Alligator.
[01:49:30.009 --> 01:49:30.849]  I apologize.
[01:49:31.409 --> 01:49:36.250]  I just thought I'd say, perhaps if he looked at the Tavistock Trust,
[01:49:37.082 --> 01:49:40.947]  That's a perfect university, a Rockefeller Foundation, he would start to learn something.
[01:49:54.562 --> 01:49:57.405]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.665 --> 01:49:59.227]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.587 --> 01:50:04.271]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.612 --> 01:50:09.016]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.456 --> 01:50:13.661]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.861 --> 01:50:16.703]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.804 --> 01:50:19.286]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:50:19.486 --> 01:50:26.050]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.291 --> 01:50:33.535]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.755 --> 01:50:36.197]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.337 --> 01:50:40.760]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law 1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping

[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:59.045]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:07.292]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.532 --> 01:51:14.598]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.538 --> 01:51:22.019]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:27.301]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.421 --> 01:51:36.282]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.542 --> 01:51:43.504]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[01:52:53.868 --> 01:52:59.192]  Okay, Eddie and Anglin, go ahead and finish up.
[01:52:59.212 --> 01:53:05.096]  The last part was that the reason I rang was a question, really.
[01:53:23.317 --> 01:53:35.140]  Alex, I've got an email from a friend in Canada stating that District Judge Robertson has just resigned from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
[01:53:35.885 --> 01:53:37.026]  Do you know anything about it?
[01:53:37.186 --> 01:53:38.367]  Can you let me know anything?
[01:53:38.467 --> 01:53:42.589]  Yeah, I've got a Washington Post article about the, and thanks for the call, Eddie.
[01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:52.535]  I've got a Washington Post article about him resigning because he's saying the whole court has been discredited because of this news coming out.
[01:53:53.115 --> 01:53:56.057]  And so I'll try to get into some of that coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:56.077 --> 01:54:00.140]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Andy.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:03.062]  Andy, where are you calling us from today?
[01:54:03.902 --> 01:54:05.383]  First of all, Merry Christmas, Alex.
[01:54:06.033 --> 01:54:06.693]  Merry Christmas!
[01:54:06.713 --> 01:54:08.274]  You've committed another hateful crime!
[01:54:09.114 --> 01:54:10.175]  That's the whole purpose.
[01:54:10.295 --> 01:54:13.556]  The federal agents will be over to my front door in a minute.
[01:54:14.557 --> 01:54:18.519]  I'm calling from Rockford, Illinois and I can never call your show without plugging my affiliate.
[01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:22.120]  I catch you on AM 1520 WLUV.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.181]  Great folks!
[01:54:23.881 --> 01:54:24.521]  Yes they are.
[01:54:24.821 --> 01:54:26.182]  Same owner for 43 years.
[01:54:27.363 --> 01:54:28.603]  I want to get to a couple points.
[01:54:28.643 --> 01:54:31.404]  First of all, your caller Jeff stole some of my fire.
[01:54:32.225 --> 01:54:34.706]  I was listening to Rush Limbaugh the other day.
[01:54:35.839 --> 01:54:46.505]  And he said, folks, I want concrete proof that a law-abiding citizen has been arrested under the Patriot Act.
[01:54:47.165 --> 01:54:48.226]  No, no, that's a script.
[01:54:48.266 --> 01:54:52.288]  They all do that, and we have literal bins of mainstream articles.
[01:54:52.608 --> 01:55:04.515]  We're homeless, pot dealers, you know, just everybody, county commissioners, war protesters, and they'll just say there's never been a case.
[01:55:05.822 --> 01:55:06.022]  Yes.
[01:55:06.503 --> 01:55:12.707]  Um, second point I wanted to make was, um, I would suggest that everybody goes and rents the movie JFK.
[01:55:13.668 --> 01:55:18.131]  Because the investigator Jim Garrison, he was like the Alex Jones of the 60s.
[01:55:19.112 --> 01:55:26.558]  He tried so hard to get the truth out about the corruption in our government, and government cover-ups, and he was just called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:55:26.798 --> 01:55:28.439]  Well, he was dead on, too.
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.720]  He was, and he warned.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.141]  He was so prophetic about 9-11.
[01:55:32.182 --> 01:55:34.564]  He warned, if we don't wake up the government corruption,
[01:55:35.623 --> 01:55:37.164]  Our future is in serious trouble.
[01:55:38.045 --> 01:55:51.933]  Well, you know, when the actor in that film there at the end, Kevin Costner, does his closing arguments, those are basically from Garrison's real closing argument in that case.
[01:55:52.633 --> 01:55:53.574]  And we ought to play that.
[01:55:53.594 --> 01:55:54.594]  We played that before.
[01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:58.537]  We ought to find that audio file and play his closing arguments in that film.
[01:55:59.637 --> 01:56:06.521]  And you're right, it mirrors what's happening today, but it mirrors what happened a hundred years ago, or five hundred years ago, or five thousand years ago.
[01:56:06.921 --> 01:56:09.543]  It's just the same thing over and over again.
[01:56:09.563 --> 01:56:14.966]  Elites get in there, they think that basically we're all their slaves, and they just keep pushing and pushing.
[01:56:15.626 --> 01:56:19.348]  One more thing before I go, to answer Rush Limbaugh's question.
[01:56:20.549 --> 01:56:26.012]  This doesn't quite relate to the Patriot Act, but I do possess American dictators.
[01:56:26.893 --> 01:56:27.553]  I have seen you
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.947]  You're being kidnapped by police for asking President Bush just a simple question.
[01:56:34.028 --> 01:56:42.562]  Now, don't you think the same president that would arrest a journalist would arrest a law-abiding, who would have dictatorial power?
[01:56:43.163 --> 01:56:45.445]  Arrest law-abiding citizens under Patriot Act.
[01:56:45.725 --> 01:56:52.230]  Well, another thing is that I've been there when cops are just arresting people in a protest and then people go, how do you do this?
[01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:54.051]  They go, things change, the Patriot Act.
[01:56:54.091 --> 01:56:56.312]  It's like they don't even know what it is.
[01:56:56.332 --> 01:56:57.854]  They just say we're using it.
[01:56:58.194 --> 01:57:08.821]  But now we have a whole archive on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com of the Patriot Act specifically being used against citizens and stuff that is no connection to terrorism.
[01:57:08.881 --> 01:57:11.103]  And I'm talking about arrests, a whole bunch of them.
[01:57:11.952 --> 01:57:17.894]  And so, next time, but you notice he now embossed saying, before it was, show me one case being used on Americans.
[01:57:18.414 --> 01:57:20.534]  Now it's law abiding.
[01:57:20.554 --> 01:57:23.255]  So you see, oh now, crime is terror.
[01:57:23.495 --> 01:57:25.896]  Oh, it's like the TSA Viper teams.
[01:57:25.916 --> 01:57:27.176]  They're going to fight crime.
[01:57:27.576 --> 01:57:29.817]  Third Hour, your calls, masses of news coming up.
[01:57:33.258 --> 01:57:37.899]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.841 --> 01:57:50.501]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.142 --> 01:57:52.202]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.923 --> 01:57:54.023]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.683 --> 01:57:55.504]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.264 --> 01:57:57.165]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.825 --> 01:58:01.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.007 --> 01:58:06.129]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.851 --> 01:58:15.454]  Chinese police bring villagers to heel after lasting uprising.
[01:58:17.245 --> 01:58:22.349]  Despite the fact that record numbers of teens are being arrested for using marijuana, it's only increasing.
[01:58:22.369 --> 01:58:24.311]  Well, yeah, the drug war is succeeding.
[01:58:24.351 --> 01:58:25.172]  More people are using it.
[01:58:25.552 --> 01:58:26.533]  It's always been the plan.
[01:58:26.553 --> 01:58:27.474]  More on Mexico.
[01:58:27.534 --> 01:58:30.076]  Retaliates for border wall plans.
[01:58:30.096 --> 01:58:31.917]  Says that they will control the U.S.
[01:58:31.978 --> 01:58:33.619]  and force our walls down.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:37.182]  And telling people inside the U.S.
[01:58:37.222 --> 01:58:40.024]  to rise up and take to the streets and start protesting.
[01:58:40.665 --> 01:58:43.227]  Oh, a foreign leader trying to manipulate our internal activities.
[01:58:43.267 --> 01:58:44.148]  That's unbelievable.
[01:58:45.086 --> 01:58:47.687]  And a UConn school group found on U.S.
[01:58:47.747 --> 01:58:48.327]  threat lists.
[01:58:48.367 --> 01:58:52.708]  Just a tame group that went and protested the military is found as a threat.
[01:58:53.428 --> 01:58:56.668]  Just all these groups listed as threats by the Pentagon watching them.
[01:58:58.489 --> 01:59:02.550]  And we will get into where George Tenet went.
[01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:10.271]  He went to head up thing at Visage, names ex-CIA chief George Tenet to boards.
[01:59:10.291 --> 01:59:13.892]  All these big telecommunications companies have got spooks running them.
[01:59:14.964 --> 01:59:19.266]  And every day I see a whole bunch of articles that say, cameras that cut down on crime in Oak Ridge.
[01:59:19.306 --> 01:59:20.207]  And, oh, guess what?
[01:59:20.227 --> 01:59:21.828]  We put cameras up to look at the traffic.
[01:59:21.908 --> 01:59:23.729]  Oh, now they're going to want you to fight crime.
[01:59:24.389 --> 01:59:25.250]  Remember years ago?
[01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:27.671]  Oh, weren't they not ever going to use those to watch you?
[01:59:27.691 --> 01:59:31.273]  That's to watch, that's to watch, you know, for crime.
[01:59:32.413 --> 01:59:38.377]  Remember the Diebold CEO stepped down with allegations of fraud and election fraud and scams and all this?
[01:59:38.877 --> 01:59:39.397]  Well, St.
[01:59:39.437 --> 01:59:42.499]  Louis is going with Diebold election systems.
[01:59:43.345 --> 01:59:44.046]  This is out of the St.
[01:59:44.086 --> 01:59:47.849]  Louis Post-Dispatch, and it says, uh, the St.
[01:59:47.889 --> 01:59:53.274]  Louis Election Board has chosen Diebold Election Systems to provide a new hybrid voting system to the city.
[01:59:53.694 --> 01:59:57.497]  Officials said they were impressed by the firm's operations and equipment.
[01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:58.318]  Oh, yeah!
[01:59:59.359 --> 02:00:01.661]  Just absolutely wonderful.
[02:00:03.062 --> 02:00:10.849]  And Chertoff, uh, Comrade Chertoff, his cousin writes hit pieces on me, Homeland Security Director, says FEMA may see radical changes.
[02:00:11.969 --> 02:00:12.709]  And U.S.
[02:00:12.789 --> 02:00:15.491]  warrants Turkey of airstrike on Iran and Syria.
[02:00:15.891 --> 02:00:16.751]  We will cover that.
[02:00:16.931 --> 02:00:17.031]  U.S.
[02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:18.352]  holding children in prison camps.
[02:00:18.412 --> 02:00:20.073]  New report on that.
[02:00:20.693 --> 02:00:21.634]  And look at this article.
[02:00:21.694 --> 02:00:24.795]  Doctors charged with treating cancer patients with weed killer.
[02:00:25.455 --> 02:00:26.736]  They're not saying it wasn't working.
[02:00:27.503 --> 02:00:29.864]  Basically, that's what the chemotherapy is.
[02:00:30.064 --> 02:00:34.606]  They just have some patented weed killer that's 5,000 times more expensive than weed killer.
[02:00:35.106 --> 02:00:38.948]  A lot of doctors, I mean a lot of them have been caught doing this, just giving people regular poison.
[02:00:39.468 --> 02:00:41.489]  Seems to work just as good or better all the time.
[02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:42.790]  Pretty sick though.
[02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:44.190]  Here's the one going underneath it.
[02:00:45.391 --> 02:00:46.952]  A lot of scams.
[02:00:47.792 --> 02:00:52.474]  A lot of scams going on out there that are very, very serious.
[02:00:52.894 --> 02:00:55.836]  But we're also going to get into
[02:00:58.155 --> 02:01:02.356]  Some other news about torture and the Iraq War, and of course, continue to take your calls.
[02:01:02.396 --> 02:01:03.357]  And now I'm warmed up!
[02:01:03.377 --> 02:01:06.457]  We've already taken a lot of calls, but I'm going to take a whole parcel of them.
[02:01:06.477 --> 02:01:07.658]  And listen, get ready.
[02:01:07.918 --> 02:01:09.518]  I'm giving each person about 60 seconds.
[02:01:10.058 --> 02:01:13.479]  I'm going to move on to the next person so everybody gets a chance to get involved on air.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:14.980]  I'm going to go wild.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:15.060]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:15.120]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:22.582 --> 02:01:34.210]  On this Wednesday, the 21st day of December 2005 edition, when we get back from this quick break, isn't it just amazing that we have had this long year?
[02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:37.232]  But it seems like it was five minutes.
[02:01:37.352 --> 02:01:38.293]  At least it does to me.
[02:01:38.353 --> 02:01:48.880]  It took me four or five months to get accustomed to the fact that we were now in 2005, and now it's about, in ten days, less than ten days, to be 2006.
[02:01:53.852 --> 02:02:01.578]  Coming up in eight, nine months, we're going to end up having the fifth anniversary of 9-11 and the government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:02:01.638 --> 02:02:04.260]  So that is coming up.
[02:02:05.681 --> 02:02:11.086]  But I'll tell you, this really is, this has been a bumper year for the truth.
[02:02:11.786 --> 02:02:16.590]  I mean, this is the year that we've seen mass acceptance of 9-11 being an inside job at major polls.
[02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:21.654]  It's been the year that it's become acceptable to be discussed by a lot of prominent people.
[02:02:22.526 --> 02:02:26.190]  It has been the year that the government's been fully discredited.
[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:30.434]  And it's just been a momentous, fast-moving year.
[02:02:30.914 --> 02:02:33.917]  And we're not out of the woods yet, but all of you deserve a pat on the back.
[02:02:33.937 --> 02:02:34.798]  And I'm talking to you.
[02:02:35.158 --> 02:02:42.605]  Thank you, listeners, and sponsors, and affiliates, and all of you out there that have been part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:02:42.985 --> 02:02:43.586]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.402 --> 02:02:46.904]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.084 --> 02:02:50.187]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.307 --> 02:02:54.210]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:58.495]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.835 --> 02:03:02.598]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.739 --> 02:03:04.600]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:08.084]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.104 --> 02:03:09.165]  The medical bills!
[02:03:10.025 --> 02:03:12.807]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.967 --> 02:03:15.988]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.168 --> 02:03:19.070]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.530 --> 02:03:25.653]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.173 --> 02:03:29.976]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:45.365 --> 02:04:50.009]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.789]  have diabetes.
[02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:58.075]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:04:58.215 --> 02:05:02.739]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:05:02.939 --> 02:05:05.761]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:05:45.269 --> 02:05:50.315]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.695 --> 02:05:52.957]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.639 --> 02:06:12.151]  So listeners, I know you're calling in about a whole host of issues, but listeners, what do you think of Vicente Fox saying, hey, rise up, protest in the streets, sue, complain, file complaints, we're going to bring that wall down, we're going to use the international community to pressure the U.S.
[02:06:12.191 --> 02:06:16.734]  telling Mexican TV and Address, we are going to stop them from building the wall.
[02:06:17.234 --> 02:06:23.159]  A foreign government who has a wall up against, um, up against Guatemala,
[02:06:23.903 --> 02:06:29.205]  Very strict immigration rules, but saying, we're going to stop your wall from going in.
[02:06:29.245 --> 02:06:31.466]  Man, I demand 10 walls.
[02:06:31.526 --> 02:06:34.367]  I demand walls with barbed wire hanging off of them.
[02:06:34.888 --> 02:06:45.032]  I mean, it's just, again, I've got to have TSA Viper teams creeping around demanding to see my papers, but the border's going to be wide open, and we're going to legalize all the illegal aliens with an amnesty card.
[02:06:45.732 --> 02:06:48.573]  And then Congress finally, the House finally passes a bill.
[02:06:48.813 --> 02:06:49.833]  Hadn't passed the Senate yet.
[02:06:50.093 --> 02:06:54.815]  They're saying they're going to put, for instance, going to go ruin it and put amnesty in it so the wall won't matter.
[02:06:56.095 --> 02:06:59.216]  They'll just put a big gate right in it, come on in.
[02:06:59.236 --> 02:07:01.497]  And that's what the NAFTA highways do.
[02:07:01.717 --> 02:07:05.338]  All your cars have transponders and they just, you know, you're an authorized worker.
[02:07:08.819 --> 02:07:10.300]  They just drive right in.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:11.760]  Excuse me.
[02:07:12.967 --> 02:07:13.968]  I got a cold still, folks.
[02:07:14.008 --> 02:07:16.089]  I'm getting better, but I have these coughing attacks.
[02:07:16.529 --> 02:07:17.490]  I've got to hit the cough button.
[02:07:20.231 --> 02:07:26.956]  So to make a long story short, when you hear that they're going to give them worker visas, that's just legalize all of them.
[02:07:27.596 --> 02:07:29.237]  And that means skilled and unskilled.
[02:07:29.277 --> 02:07:35.381]  Computer workers, software engineers, you think you like that 75% pay cut you've gotten over the last three years?
[02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:37.082]  How about just not have a job at all?
[02:07:37.122 --> 02:07:37.962]  How does that sound to you?
[02:07:38.402 --> 02:07:39.043]  Well, don't worry.
[02:07:39.243 --> 02:07:40.804]  You're going to get to lose all your jobs.
[02:07:40.864 --> 02:07:42.525]  I mean, this is the plan.
[02:07:43.234 --> 02:07:44.115]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[02:07:44.155 --> 02:07:45.095]  I should not take calls.
[02:07:46.016 --> 02:07:48.378]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[02:07:48.478 --> 02:07:49.178]  John, welcome.
[02:07:49.679 --> 02:07:50.019]  Hello.
[02:07:50.459 --> 02:08:07.051]  I'd like to recommend a person to you who I consider a president, Jim Garrison, and does go back to the investigations in the 60s, the JFK assassination, the Robert Kennedy assassination, and right down to the president and the 9-11 conspiracy.
[02:08:07.371 --> 02:08:10.093]  And he's a veteran by the name of Ralph Schoenman.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:12.962]  And he's at TakingAim.info.
[02:08:13.002 --> 02:08:15.424]  His website is TakingAim.info.
[02:08:15.905 --> 02:08:24.412]  And he's about the only person I hear occasionally that gets on Pacifica Radio that climbs over and around that censorship wall.
[02:08:24.972 --> 02:08:27.715]  The gatekeeper is erect against any discussion.
[02:08:28.288 --> 02:08:32.454]  Of the evidence of government complicity in the 9-11 attacks?
[02:08:32.534 --> 02:08:37.921]  Listen, there are not, think about this, there are not gatekeepers on George Norris coast-to-coast.
[02:08:37.941 --> 02:08:39.763]  They let people get on and say whatever they want.
[02:08:39.784 --> 02:08:42.968]  They let me get on and say whatever I want, but Pacifica
[02:08:43.735 --> 02:08:54.706]  The supposed bastion of freedom and just being a wonderful place of liberalism, you try to expose the left-right paradigm.
[02:08:54.726 --> 02:09:04.456]  You try to expose the Democrats for being a bunch of war-mongering criminals in the same hip pocket of the same military-industrial complex, and it ain't going over the air because they take Ford Foundation money!
[02:09:05.336 --> 02:09:10.279]  Well, I would think that, from what I've heard, they do expose the Democrats on Pacifica.
[02:09:10.319 --> 02:09:20.146]  They don't do it on Air America, though I've heard today that Mike Malloy is going to have somebody on it, starting at 3 o'clock, who's going to point out the finding of the
[02:09:21.174 --> 02:09:27.835]  Black Boxes from 9-11 is pretty belated, but that's pretty good, and he's about the only one on Air America that will do that.
[02:09:27.875 --> 02:09:28.875]  That's in the stack.
[02:09:28.975 --> 02:09:31.196]  Counterpunch, and it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:31.216 --> 02:09:32.756]  See, this is such old news to us.
[02:09:32.816 --> 02:09:40.077]  It's been in the Philadelphia Daily News, it's been in the Boston Globe, and we've interviewed the people.
[02:09:40.437 --> 02:09:43.498]  They found three of the four boxes with the orange stripes on them.
[02:09:43.538 --> 02:09:44.738]  It's in my film, Martial Law.
[02:09:45.058 --> 02:09:45.918]  There's no debating it.
[02:09:45.938 --> 02:09:48.499]  The FBI said national security, and hauled them off.
[02:09:48.539 --> 02:09:49.959]  Now, why don't they win Counterpunch?
[02:09:50.539 --> 02:09:53.780]  Doug, I've got more evidence that the FBI does indeed have them.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.160]  Well, of course they have them!
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.301]  They carried out the attack!
[02:09:56.801 --> 02:09:57.341]  Absolutely.
[02:09:57.921 --> 02:09:58.921]  There's something I wanted to mention.
[02:09:59.941 --> 02:10:11.264]  I've just heard somebody play a part of it on his laptop, taking inbound info about how this investigation into Libby is really not what it appears to be.
[02:10:11.384 --> 02:10:17.706]  And this guy, Fitzgerald, is really part of a... there is some kind of a split between the neocons and the
[02:10:18.679 --> 02:10:46.458]  uh... the more cunning imperialist uh... who are objecting to some of their stupid mishandling of the war even though they support all of the evil aims of this war and uh... Fitzgerald uh... and uh... uh... Wilson was uh... actually uh... uh... uh... uh... perpetrated a sting operation against uh... by uh... fabricating that uh... Niger document uh... it was actually according to uh... Ralph Schoenman forged by uh... the CIA in alliance with uh... Plame and Wilson
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:53.162]  To sucker them into this, using it, because they'll use any kind of lie, these neocons, and they fell for it.
[02:10:53.602 --> 02:11:03.865]  And according to a showman, they were at a party of CIA agents, saying, man, it was really cool, we really suckered them right into it, because they'll go for any fabricated intelligence.
[02:11:04.405 --> 02:11:16.049]  And that they're trying to actually set them up, and Fitzgerald actually was one of the people who covered up the FBI involvement in the 93 attacks on the World Trade Center.
[02:11:16.553 --> 02:11:43.852]  that he was uh... uh... the prosecutor at that time and he prosecuted uh... lynn stewart who was uh... i was aware of that no i i you know i had everybody's like this girl's gonna save us what a great american look at that young man he's a good boy he's like elliot ness and pure baloney and so i will get that individual uh... on and i am familiar with some of his work uh... but uh... it was a point you raised earlier though you call them imperialist
[02:11:44.572 --> 02:12:05.023]  And I know the communists use that terminology, but the Pentagon gets on C-SPAN with Barnett and others, Professor Barnett, and says, we are an empire, we work for Wall Street, the American people, we don't work for them, and they openly in their documents say we're an empire, and then good old boys hear that and go, well good, I'll be part of the empire.
[02:12:05.063 --> 02:12:06.964]  You're going to be a slave in the empire, folks.
[02:12:07.704 --> 02:12:12.467]  And, you know, I wanted to get your take, because I know you're a leftist, in the false paradigm still, John, you've called before.
[02:12:12.487 --> 02:12:23.094]  I mean, have you ever read Carroll Quigley at Georgetown, where he says, I've been into the elite meetings, we control the communists and the fascists, we control anything that's command and control, we support it all?
[02:12:23.454 --> 02:12:32.100]  Don't you understand these internationalists are bigger than any one country, and they play these different countries off against each other, and anything that centralizes is their tool?
[02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:49.612]  Well, I know about Carol Quigley, but I don't agree with the analysis that the Soviet Union, whether it was a deformed socialism, whether it was hijacked by Stalin or not, was actually something that they wanted.
[02:12:49.652 --> 02:12:56.053]  They will naturally try to subvert it, they will try to overturn it, but a country that closes out... Okay, let me ask you a question.
[02:12:56.073 --> 02:12:59.154]  Tiananmen Square, do you think Tiananmen Square was wrong?
[02:13:00.431 --> 02:13:05.956]  Yes, but what I'm saying is... Let me stop you right there, because the Washington Post is kind of like, it's a good thing now.
[02:13:06.676 --> 02:13:21.067]  What do you think about the latest thing where these farmers didn't want to give up their ancestral lands with their already subsistence level, the poorest people in China, and don't want to move on to being factory slaves, basically, building widgets, and they just went in and mowed a bunch of them down.
[02:13:21.087 --> 02:13:21.848]  You think that's real good?
[02:13:22.148 --> 02:13:25.331]  Well, I think China is a capitalist country at this point, and it never was.
[02:13:25.391 --> 02:13:26.772]  You're actually right, it is, yeah.
[02:13:26.952 --> 02:13:38.535]  Yeah, and also, I'm just saying that we have to have the same kind of skepticism that we get reports concerning China, North Korea, Cuba, or anything that has a communist label, true or false, on it.
[02:13:39.933 --> 02:13:45.018]  We know how much they lie about the lesser targets that they have in Syria, Iraq, and Iran.
[02:13:45.399 --> 02:13:59.394]  I think we have to have the same kind of skepticism because I recall an anti-war activist who considered himself very sophisticated, a top leader, who got fooled by some of this kind of disinformation of the CIA in Angola, John Stockwell, the CIA station chief.
[02:13:59.901 --> 02:14:11.549]  wrote how they were planting false disinformation about Cuba, Cuban troops committing atrocities in Angola, and then the next day they would print a story saying that Castro disciplined the troops.
[02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:16.813]  Both of the stories were false, but if you have something that seems to mitigate the first one, people will believe it.
[02:14:17.153 --> 02:14:25.759]  All I'm saying is that we've got to be just as skeptical about the phase two targets of the project from the American Century, North Korea and China.
[02:14:26.366 --> 02:14:48.089]  uh... as we are all come on north korea he really does have a seven-story pleasure palsy apologize for kidnapping women he wanted a rape to death i mean the guys in an absolute bucket of puss well it worked out eventually they're going to drop this uh... two-pronged strategy of of uh... having china up with regardless just because the globalists are evil doesn't mean that their opponents aren't evil
[02:14:49.190 --> 02:14:51.611]  Just let's not get sucked into a war.
[02:14:51.651 --> 02:14:52.832]  John, thanks for the call.
[02:14:52.872 --> 02:14:53.612]  You're never going to learn.
[02:14:54.073 --> 02:14:55.233]  Government's evil.
[02:14:55.273 --> 02:14:56.774]  The nature of man is evil.
[02:14:57.074 --> 02:15:02.237]  You centralize something, evil people are going to gravitate towards power because they're control freaks.
[02:15:02.977 --> 02:15:03.638]  You understand that?
[02:15:03.678 --> 02:15:05.118]  It's always going to backfire.
[02:15:05.459 --> 02:15:06.719]  It's always going to be bad.
[02:15:06.739 --> 02:15:08.220]  Okay?
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.002]  You see, there are 60-something rogue countries at the global that say they want to invade.
[02:15:12.757 --> 02:15:20.121]  And some of those countries are good, some of those countries are bad, some of those countries are somewhat corrupt, or a little corrupt, or aren't corrupt.
[02:15:21.222 --> 02:15:23.763]  And then they'll say, well, are you for the New World Order?
[02:15:24.644 --> 02:15:25.564]  With Europe and the U.S.
[02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:26.304]  taking over?
[02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:30.026]  Or are you with the mullahs in Iran?
[02:15:31.947 --> 02:15:36.470]  Or, well, are you for, you know, I look at it with a geopolitical strategy.
[02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:40.272]  And I say, well, okay, who is more evil?
[02:15:40.312 --> 02:15:41.413]  Who is more centralized?
[02:15:41.493 --> 02:15:42.634]  Well, it's the globalists.
[02:15:42.654 --> 02:15:45.475]  I mean, they're just absolute murdering trash.
[02:15:45.495 --> 02:15:47.096]  They have a horrible mass plan.
[02:15:47.476 --> 02:15:48.737]  What screws up their plan?
[02:15:49.057 --> 02:15:49.777]  Rogue nations.
[02:15:50.037 --> 02:15:50.958]  Quote, what is rogue?
[02:15:51.298 --> 02:15:52.619]  Free, independent nations.
[02:15:54.039 --> 02:15:56.181]  And so, that's what they're going after.
[02:15:57.641 --> 02:16:02.364]  And as soon as you fall into a debate of, oh, I'm against the globalists, so I'm for, you know, China.
[02:16:02.404 --> 02:16:04.385]  And people go, what do you mean China's capitalist?
[02:16:05.005 --> 02:16:06.786]  Capitalism is not free market.
[02:16:08.383 --> 02:16:09.263]  And people are going, really?
[02:16:09.864 --> 02:16:10.744]  Yes, it's not.
[02:16:10.945 --> 02:16:12.726]  See, people don't even know what definitions mean.
[02:16:14.147 --> 02:16:15.849]  People don't even know what definitions mean.
[02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:22.014]  Capitalism is a form of centralized mercantilism, okay?
[02:16:22.294 --> 02:16:25.897]  And there are four different types of capitalism, but we have crony,
[02:16:27.638 --> 02:16:31.824]  Centralized, command and control, authoritative capitalism.
[02:16:32.285 --> 02:16:32.645]  Okay?
[02:16:33.106 --> 02:16:34.147]  And they'll use anybody.
[02:16:34.168 --> 02:16:37.052]  They'll go hire a communist thug because he'll give them all the gold mines.
[02:16:37.332 --> 02:16:40.016]  And they'll fund him to kill his own population and use them as slaves.
[02:16:40.999 --> 02:16:53.782]  As the workmen beat him over the head, going, you're part of the workers' brigade, you know, the people's... And then the communists went after the family, they went after God, they went after freedom of religion.
[02:16:54.322 --> 02:16:55.723]  I mean, they did do those things.
[02:16:55.763 --> 02:17:02.325]  You've got all these bleeding hearts who just will scream and yell once they're under a real communist regime.
[02:17:04.185 --> 02:17:05.105]  That's only window dressing.
[02:17:05.125 --> 02:17:07.806]  It's the same thing as a fascist regime or any of this.
[02:17:08.701 --> 02:17:19.949]  So, Zheng Ximen, before he left office a few years ago, it was a BBC headline, Chinese Communism, the Ultimate Expression of Capitalism.
[02:17:20.329 --> 02:17:21.911]  People said, man, he's really going crazy.
[02:17:21.971 --> 02:17:22.771]  No, it's true!
[02:17:22.791 --> 02:17:37.522]  You've got a bunch of fat generals, a bunch of scum, a bunch of ticks, bleeding the population with a bunch of slave goods, leveraging out all our jobs, working with our degenerate elite.
[02:17:38.479 --> 02:17:40.321]  I mean, it's not communism.
[02:17:40.401 --> 02:17:42.983]  Communism doesn't exist outside of an anthill.
[02:17:43.483 --> 02:17:44.464]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:17:46.866 --> 02:17:49.468]  Thanks for tuning in to this edition of Coffee on the Air.

[02:18:47.136 --> 02:18:48.177]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:18:48.497 --> 02:18:51.279]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.559 --> 02:18:55.702]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.143 --> 02:18:56.963]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.284 --> 02:19:01.867]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.347 --> 02:19:04.469]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:05.830]  Sheltering in place.
[02:19:06.246 --> 02:19:19.659]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:35.291 --> 02:19:36.371]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:19:36.391 --> 02:19:37.251]  One and the same.
[02:19:37.331 --> 02:19:38.672]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:04.634]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:05.054 --> 02:20:08.196]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.456 --> 02:20:10.277]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:10.337 --> 02:20:13.359]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:13.899 --> 02:20:16.121]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.501 --> 02:20:20.083]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:20.564 --> 02:20:24.226]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:24.786 --> 02:20:27.628]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.

[02:22:00.495 --> 02:22:04.796]  You know, I said I'd give each caller about a minute and go to all of you, and then I gave John the entire segment.
[02:22:06.637 --> 02:22:07.777]  I just can't do that.
[02:22:09.038 --> 02:22:11.298]  None of this stuff is really sound bites.
[02:22:11.318 --> 02:22:22.382]  We're going to your calls really fast now, and then I will get into 9-1-1 missing black boxes and World Trade Center attacks found by firefighters, analyzed by NTSB, concealed by FBI, and that's counterpunch, okay?
[02:22:23.766 --> 02:22:30.812]  Which is a, you know, actually mainstream journalist that couldn't get their stuff printed in the LA Times and New York Times anymore, so they went and started a website.
[02:22:31.693 --> 02:22:36.296]  Lots of leftist stuff, but it's always, you know, milquetoast, totally confirmed.
[02:22:37.057 --> 02:22:41.681]  So, I mean, we already knew this, but they'll be hailed as breaking a massive story, which is fine.
[02:22:41.701 --> 02:22:42.421]  I don't care.
[02:22:42.481 --> 02:22:44.063]  It's just that everybody's saying, have you heard?
[02:22:44.103 --> 02:22:44.643]  Have you heard?
[02:22:44.663 --> 02:22:50.748]  Well, yeah, it was in, like, major Boston papers and Philadelphia papers years ago, but there's been some new developments, so we'll go over it.
[02:22:52.822 --> 02:22:59.687]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathaniel in Texas and then Mike and many, many others.
[02:22:59.727 --> 02:23:00.508]  Go ahead, Nathaniel.
[02:23:00.528 --> 02:23:01.989]  Hey Nathaniel, how's it going out?
[02:23:02.229 --> 02:23:03.850]  I'm sorry, hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:04.771]  Good, good.
[02:23:05.211 --> 02:23:07.173]  Have you heard of Echelon?
[02:23:08.514 --> 02:23:08.854]  Yes.
[02:23:09.655 --> 02:23:10.795]  What do you know about Echelon?
[02:23:11.696 --> 02:23:14.118]  It's a kind of global spying network, right?
[02:23:15.194 --> 02:23:19.836]  Yes, it's between five countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.
[02:23:20.437 --> 02:23:26.300]  And it's a particular program name of data sharing between these hubs and those five countries.
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:28.641]  It's part of the National Security Agency.
[02:23:28.661 --> 02:23:43.669]  Okay, have you heard anything about black boxes and TV snooping two-way, audio-visual coming into your house?
[02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:46.531]  They've had this technology since 79 or 83.
[02:23:46.591 --> 02:23:50.514]  It uses the wiring of your house.
[02:23:51.114 --> 02:23:53.696]  Yeah, I can actually... I mean, are you asking me a question?
[02:23:53.776 --> 02:23:57.358]  Yeah, I was asking if you've heard of that and you believe that's true also.
[02:23:58.119 --> 02:24:00.601]  Well, I mean, it depends on what technology you're talking about.
[02:24:00.801 --> 02:24:02.582]  But go ahead and make your point so I'll answer your question.
[02:24:03.683 --> 02:24:05.424]  I was just wondering what you knew about it, actually.
[02:24:05.444 --> 02:24:10.587]  I've got an article here from Wake Up America from the ForbiddenKnowledge.com.
[02:24:10.627 --> 02:24:11.948]  I didn't know if you've seen that website.
[02:24:13.049 --> 02:24:14.010]  Yeah, I've seen that stuff.
[02:24:15.407 --> 02:24:18.068]  Let's just cover what we can totally prove, okay?
[02:24:18.488 --> 02:24:18.768]  Okay.
[02:24:19.088 --> 02:24:25.230]  Cable systems can track what you watch and how long you watch it and what you do.
[02:24:25.330 --> 02:24:31.052]  Now with the digital cable and the TiVos, they know exactly what you watch and how long you watch it.
[02:24:31.592 --> 02:24:35.413]  And remember when Janet Jackson two years ago exposed herself?
[02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:41.055]  Oh yeah, everybody ran it back on TiVo that was a perv and didn't have porno television.
[02:24:41.295 --> 02:24:45.098]  Well, the point is that TiVo bragged, people went, well, wait a minute, they finally clicked.
[02:24:45.478 --> 02:24:49.661]  TiVo goes, we had 2.4 million replays in that first five minutes, a record.
[02:24:49.681 --> 02:24:55.346]  And then the Boston papers and the Dallas papers and then a big one was in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:24:55.886 --> 02:24:59.048]  They said, wait a minute, TiVo watches what we watch?
[02:24:59.108 --> 02:25:04.993]  Well, yeah, and then they also get that data on your habits, very lucrative.
[02:25:05.653 --> 02:25:08.816]  And I've had Tom Warner employees, luckily, get mad at me and send me mean emails.
[02:25:08.896 --> 02:25:10.577]  How dare you talk about that?
[02:25:10.658 --> 02:25:12.980]  Sure, we can do that, but it doesn't mean we do.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:14.581]  Well, are you in that division?
[02:25:14.621 --> 02:25:15.161]  Well, no.
[02:25:15.181 --> 02:25:17.043]  I just don't like you anymore.
[02:25:17.103 --> 02:25:18.444]  We're going to lose subscribers.
[02:25:18.544 --> 02:25:19.765]  I mean, the facts are the facts.
[02:25:19.785 --> 02:25:29.253]  Listen, these Atlantic Scientific, Scientific Atlantic boxes, most of them have microphones in them, though there's, quote, no use for them.
[02:25:29.294 --> 02:25:30.435]  And it's in the owner's manual.
[02:25:30.795 --> 02:25:32.016]  They can be used to listen to you.
[02:25:33.202 --> 02:25:35.903]  So, but that's nothing compared to what the computers do.
[02:25:36.543 --> 02:25:44.666]  And then they've also talked about how there's technology where they can use the electricity in your outlets to listen to you.
[02:25:44.846 --> 02:25:46.886]  I don't know if that's real, but I know this is real.
[02:25:47.666 --> 02:25:52.948]  They have old technology where they dial into your phone and use it even when it's off the hook.
[02:25:54.055 --> 02:25:55.256]  I think so.
[02:26:15.757 --> 02:26:17.558]  You know, have a little box they use.
[02:26:18.098 --> 02:26:24.120]  Or it can be set up via computers and then they use the receiver as a microphone in your house.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.761]  So they don't need to break in your house and go and put microphones in.
[02:26:29.801 --> 02:26:30.861]  They use the phones.
[02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:37.543]  Sounds like they don't really need all the extra powers they're trying to get from the Patriot Act.
[02:26:37.644 --> 02:26:38.644]  They can already do all that.
[02:26:39.304 --> 02:26:42.025]  Yeah, the Patriot Act is about them trying to put it in law.
[02:26:43.507 --> 02:26:44.848]  Oh, make it a law, make it official?
[02:26:45.148 --> 02:26:46.149]  Yeah, just make it official.
[02:26:48.491 --> 02:26:52.874]  What does the V-Chip, do you know what it's function is that they're advertising, that they're pushing on television now?
[02:26:54.636 --> 02:26:55.837]  I'm sorry, somebody was talking to me.
[02:26:55.857 --> 02:26:56.337]  What did you say?
[02:26:56.357 --> 02:27:00.080]  Do you know what the purpose of them pushing the V-Chip on us is?
[02:27:00.861 --> 02:27:04.544]  You know, that they're advertising it as being able to control what your kids watch better?
[02:27:05.664 --> 02:27:08.246]  That just, well, that's a whole other area.
[02:27:08.266 --> 02:27:08.907]  Thank you for the call.
[02:27:09.307 --> 02:27:12.590]  And you see, I just said I'd go to the callers quicker and I really didn't.
[02:27:13.534 --> 02:27:16.736]  It's almost impossible, because I get asked question after question after question.
[02:27:17.557 --> 02:27:36.789]  The V-Chip is so they can have all the violence and stuff on TV, and they know that no one's going to spend the time to actually program that, and so it just gives you the emotional salve and the excuse to let all that propaganda and violence and brainwashing come into your house, and at the other level it gets you, you know, accustomed to... We're on the march.
[02:27:37.269 --> 02:27:38.870]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.891 --> 02:27:42.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.085 --> 02:27:48.686]  Government is best which governs me.
[02:27:49.246 --> 02:27:50.546]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:50.986 --> 02:27:53.707]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:54.148 --> 02:27:56.809]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:57.229 --> 02:28:03.691]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:28:26.163 --> 02:28:26.503]  Have you?
[02:28:27.083 --> 02:28:28.584]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:28:38.883 --> 02:28:40.044]  Osama bin Ferdinand?

[02:29:52.939 --> 02:29:57.941]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.262 --> 02:30:06.166]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.326 --> 02:30:13.370]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:14.790]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:38.323]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:38.343 --> 02:30:40.525]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:07.334]  All the studies, all the statistics universally show that television is a society-destroying mechanism.
[02:31:08.613 --> 02:31:12.775]  Because reading and listening, they develop the brain.
[02:31:12.795 --> 02:31:14.716]  You have to image what you hear on the radio.
[02:31:14.756 --> 02:31:16.137]  You're imaging in real time.
[02:31:16.177 --> 02:31:22.360]  Your mind is creating a mental picture, subconsciously, and if you focus on it consciously, of everything I'm saying.
[02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:24.541]  When I talk about your mind, you picture your brain.
[02:31:25.102 --> 02:31:29.024]  That is an intellect, thought process building device.
[02:31:29.624 --> 02:31:31.225]  Reading, just as much so.
[02:31:32.297 --> 02:31:40.401]  TV is a mesmerizing, passive, spectating, spectator situation.
[02:31:41.101 --> 02:31:44.803]  And it actually lowers your brainwaves lower than sleep.
[02:31:45.843 --> 02:31:47.164]  To an artificially low level.
[02:31:47.424 --> 02:31:48.124]  Major studies!
[02:31:48.625 --> 02:31:52.687]  Strangely enough, video games, after a long play, even more!
[02:31:52.727 --> 02:31:54.808]  That's why they'll finally have seizures after they're done playing.
[02:31:55.708 --> 02:31:57.809]  I mean, this is mind control, folks.
[02:31:58.838 --> 02:32:00.279]  The flicker of the TV, everything.
[02:32:00.299 --> 02:32:11.887]  I mean, I've been at UT Psychology Department where they have whole rooms, whole laboratories funded by DARPA that aren't even classified about how to flicker the TV the right rate to make you be suggestible.
[02:32:12.848 --> 02:32:14.028]  I mean, it's not even hidden.
[02:32:14.048 --> 02:32:15.229]  I've been allowed in to see it.
[02:32:15.569 --> 02:32:20.873]  Oh, here we're testing the flicker rate of TV screens on these monkeys to see what will mesmerize them and control them.
[02:32:21.133 --> 02:32:23.035]  Don't worry, we euthanize them after we're done.
[02:32:23.435 --> 02:32:24.996]  UT Psychology Department, right now.
[02:32:26.923 --> 02:32:28.584]  I was not allowed to see the monkeys themselves.
[02:32:28.604 --> 02:32:29.464]  They're on computer screens.
[02:32:29.484 --> 02:32:30.224]  They can punch them up.
[02:32:30.244 --> 02:32:32.965]  They're actually in a building across the street.
[02:32:32.985 --> 02:32:34.606]  I bet this makes you mad, doesn't it?
[02:32:35.226 --> 02:32:35.746]  Globalist.
[02:32:35.766 --> 02:32:42.168]  I mean, they actually have little primates in there testing for you how to flicker the TV to control you better.
[02:32:42.368 --> 02:32:44.009]  The exact flicker rate that's the best.
[02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:46.350]  And that's without looking.
[02:32:46.390 --> 02:32:47.190]  Oh, what's in this room?
[02:32:47.290 --> 02:32:53.135]  Oh, we test the woman's sex response and then after being on a particular drug.
[02:32:53.255 --> 02:32:54.256]  Oh, what's in this room?
[02:32:54.316 --> 02:32:55.657]  Oh, retina scanner testing.
[02:32:55.857 --> 02:32:58.319]  Oh, it's a retina scanner that scans you from a distance.
[02:32:58.379 --> 02:32:58.939]  Oh, very nice.
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:32:59.980]  Funded by DARPA?
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:00.261]  Yes.
[02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:01.361]  Here's the DARPA sheet.
[02:33:01.381 --> 02:33:03.703]  It'll be hanging on this wall in the laboratory.
[02:33:03.743 --> 02:33:04.524]  It's all DARPA funded.
[02:33:05.419 --> 02:33:07.301]  And so most of this building doesn't have students in it.
[02:33:07.361 --> 02:33:07.821]  No, no, no.
[02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:09.202]  Most of this is defense research.
[02:33:10.203 --> 02:33:11.063]  Oh, thank you.
[02:33:11.323 --> 02:33:12.724]  Oh, you have the monkeys here.
[02:33:13.045 --> 02:33:13.425]  Watch this.
[02:33:13.465 --> 02:33:15.526]  This is to test how it affects the brain.
[02:33:15.807 --> 02:33:16.747]  Different flicker rates.
[02:33:16.927 --> 02:33:17.748]  Oh, thank you.
[02:33:18.168 --> 02:33:19.849]  This is my life, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:19.889 --> 02:33:21.471]  Meanwhile, you tell the general public this.
[02:33:21.671 --> 02:33:22.351]  It's not even hidden.
[02:33:22.371 --> 02:33:22.992]  They don't even know.
[02:33:23.332 --> 02:33:25.614]  They're flickering the TV to do this to you.
[02:33:25.854 --> 02:33:27.455]  That's why my videos are so successful.
[02:33:27.775 --> 02:33:32.098]  They're the truth being used in that medium, and it just totally deprograms people.
[02:33:34.148 --> 02:33:36.010]  I go watch movies every few weeks.
[02:33:36.130 --> 02:33:37.732]  I watch a little bit of TV when I have to.
[02:33:37.812 --> 02:33:39.854]  I watch tapes and videos you send me of TV.
[02:33:40.575 --> 02:33:42.437]  But, I mean, I don't like it.
[02:33:42.737 --> 02:33:44.559]  I don't enjoy TV anymore.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:46.301]  It's not true.
[02:33:46.381 --> 02:33:52.787]  I wasn't watching TV for a long time the last few years, but I end up watching about an hour a day on the stair-stepper.
[02:33:52.827 --> 02:33:53.808]  I've got a treadmill, too.
[02:33:55.290 --> 02:33:57.152]  I have a stair-stepper, a treadmill, and a bicycle.
[02:33:57.754 --> 02:34:04.497]  Because I do that now, so I can still eat cheeseburgers and enchiladas.
[02:34:04.677 --> 02:34:09.339]  The caller brings up a great point.
[02:34:09.379 --> 02:34:12.340]  I want to talk about it for hours, and I've got a stack of those here in loaded phones.
[02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:14.741]  I'm really going to them fast now.
[02:34:15.301 --> 02:34:16.422]  I am getting some calls here.
[02:34:17.122 --> 02:34:20.643]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:34:20.683 --> 02:34:21.224]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:34:21.244 --> 02:34:22.204]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:34:22.504 --> 02:34:22.764]  Good.
[02:34:23.164 --> 02:34:26.446]  One of these days I'm going to get canned for the hot air wait time, but that's all right.
[02:34:26.486 --> 02:34:27.146]  I love your hot air.
[02:34:28.182 --> 02:34:29.142]  Don't get canned!
[02:34:29.383 --> 02:34:30.303]  No, don't worry about it.
[02:34:30.383 --> 02:34:31.303]  If it happens, big deal.
[02:34:31.343 --> 02:34:32.984]  I'll just move to politics.
[02:34:33.064 --> 02:34:34.944]  Two things that I'm looking forward to, and then I'll get off here.
[02:34:34.984 --> 02:34:37.505]  The politicians against Bush, since it's an election year.
[02:34:37.905 --> 02:34:39.206]  Now they're all going to turn against him.
[02:34:39.246 --> 02:34:40.246]  No, we weren't against him.
[02:34:40.286 --> 02:34:41.766]  We were against this from the start.
[02:34:42.667 --> 02:34:50.189]  But actually, the reason I called you yesterday, and again today, we just had security in our building come up and take everybody's photograph.
[02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:53.250]  And when I went to, I deal a lot with building management.
[02:34:53.806 --> 02:35:00.051]  And I went and I talked to the general manager and he and I sat down and he said it's got nothing to do with an initiative by the management company.
[02:35:00.612 --> 02:35:04.035]  It's part of the city of Chicago's city-wide security grid.
[02:35:04.215 --> 02:35:06.116]  That's now going to go into a database.
[02:35:06.136 --> 02:35:07.257]  They didn't tell anybody that.
[02:35:07.377 --> 02:35:09.539]  I understand that, but they didn't tell anybody that.
[02:35:09.559 --> 02:35:10.780]  It's infrastructure protection.
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:11.981]  It's a Pentagon model.
[02:35:12.221 --> 02:35:14.683]  And all slaves, where you work, where you look.
[02:35:15.304 --> 02:35:17.125]  Remember what Ridge said three years ago?
[02:35:17.506 --> 02:35:19.127]  Where you work, what job you have.
[02:35:19.147 --> 02:35:22.550]  They've been following all this for 14 years, every single day.
[02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:23.751]  Well, I'm going to shut up.
[02:35:23.771 --> 02:35:24.632]  Tell us what they told you.
[02:35:25.493 --> 02:35:30.798]  All they told us was this was to redo the security initiatives for our building.
[02:35:30.838 --> 02:35:34.121]  And as I talked to management, they turned around and said, no, this is citywide.
[02:35:35.042 --> 02:35:44.351]  All it's for is so where you are, you're recognized, it brings up your ID, you're supposed to be in X building on the corner of, you're over here, and it flags a situation.
[02:35:44.451 --> 02:35:47.494]  And then I'll say this one thing, and then I'll jump off, and God bless you for what you do, Alex.
[02:35:48.203 --> 02:35:57.990]  My father, for 35 years, built clean rooms, safe rooms, worked for companies that were government contractors that designed reconnaissance cameras and weapon sighting systems.
[02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:01.172]  And most of the stuff that you would sit back and go, well, I don't know.
[02:36:01.492 --> 02:36:02.053]  Yeah, they do.
[02:36:02.213 --> 02:36:03.493]  And they've been doing it for a long time.
[02:36:03.874 --> 02:36:09.778]  They had to generate their own power for these systems, for these rooms, so nobody could tap in through the power lines.
[02:36:10.098 --> 02:36:11.759]  This stuff's been going on for years.
[02:36:11.879 --> 02:36:12.960]  People don't want to admit it.
[02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:16.446]  We need to start getting smart and we need to start taking action.
[02:36:16.486 --> 02:36:19.067]  The first thing that has to happen is we need to educate each other.
[02:36:19.127 --> 02:36:26.531]  So if you're sitting there going, I don't know what to do, don't just focus on things that are way out in left field that would be hard for people to grasp.
[02:36:26.731 --> 02:36:27.532]  Start to educate.
[02:36:27.572 --> 02:36:29.393]  And most of them don't even know who their congressmen are.
[02:36:29.913 --> 02:36:31.854]  And they're sitting there and they're going to go and cast a vote.
[02:36:31.894 --> 02:36:35.856]  And this time we're going to go with the Democrats because it was the Republicans that are screwing us over.
[02:36:36.317 --> 02:36:38.378]  We have to smarten up or it's over.
[02:36:38.438 --> 02:36:39.338]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:36:39.378 --> 02:36:40.059]  Merry Christmas.
[02:36:40.139 --> 02:36:40.419]  Love you.
[02:36:40.439 --> 02:36:40.619]  Bye.
[02:36:42.088 --> 02:36:49.271]  Well, that was the great caller that tunes in to listen to the babbler, but no, I mean, certainly I know they've got some high-tech devices that can do that, but you're right.
[02:36:49.291 --> 02:36:50.552]  I mean, why even focus on it?
[02:36:51.272 --> 02:36:59.755]  The surveillance is total, and you can decide to go in your shell and just get in a fetal position and New World Order take me away, or you can decide to fight it.
[02:37:00.556 --> 02:37:08.199]  Criminals have had unlimited funding and power and have had a secret government, and they've gotten really arrogant, and they see us as their cattle, and they're engaging in social engineering.
[02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:11.515]  And yeah, no, no, it's in MIT Magazine.
[02:37:11.595 --> 02:37:13.017]  It's in Pentagon documents.
[02:37:13.057 --> 02:37:13.537]  It's public.
[02:37:14.017 --> 02:37:18.781]  These cameras and face scanners and ID cards, all designed by the Defense Department to control you.
[02:37:19.322 --> 02:37:23.145]  And what building you're in and where you go, and it's hooked into face scanning cameras.
[02:37:23.886 --> 02:37:28.210]  And they're talking about private buildings, any job you have, RFID in your IDs.
[02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:29.991]  I mean, total slavery, folks.
[02:37:30.151 --> 02:37:31.693]  No one's ever been this enslaved.
[02:37:32.133 --> 02:37:32.533]  No one.
[02:37:32.613 --> 02:37:35.836]  We are going to be just in hell on earth.
[02:37:35.896 --> 02:37:36.657]  It's almost here.
[02:37:37.262 --> 02:37:42.547]  And the general public's going, well I guess Ben Laden's on the phone, he ought to be able to listen to it.
[02:37:42.587 --> 02:37:43.648]  They listen to everything.
[02:37:44.529 --> 02:37:51.695]  One of their biggest problems was before 9-11, the NSA kept red flagging the government's own op, and so they had to tell the NSA to shut up.
[02:37:52.516 --> 02:37:56.600]  The only problem for this surveillance is that sometimes it actually does what it's supposed to do.
[02:37:57.890 --> 02:38:00.491]  They haven't been following any Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[02:38:02.612 --> 02:38:03.613]  We're in so much trouble.
[02:38:03.673 --> 02:38:06.154]  I love this country so much, and I can't believe they're getting away with this.
[02:38:06.434 --> 02:38:07.534]  Well, they're not going to get away with it.
[02:38:08.355 --> 02:38:09.575]  And I wasn't aware of the particulars.
[02:38:09.595 --> 02:38:10.556]  Taking photos, everybody.
[02:38:10.576 --> 02:38:13.637]  I didn't know that was already happening, but I've read that in mainstream newspapers.
[02:38:13.677 --> 02:38:14.417]  It's not even hidden.
[02:38:14.978 --> 02:38:18.339]  I mean, that's the thing, is they're just doing it.
[02:38:18.419 --> 02:38:20.020]  I mean, we're total prisoners.
[02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:22.601]  The public schools are turning the kids out to be prisoners.
[02:38:23.021 --> 02:38:24.282]  Everything is how to be a prisoner.
[02:38:24.992 --> 02:38:35.965]  Have an ID, get shook down by the cops, have police dogs sniffing on you and biting your bags, and we've got video of all that, and shaking you down, and cameras in the bathrooms, and meanwhile the border's wide open.
[02:38:38.768 --> 02:38:42.092]  Meanwhile, every time someone's a terrorist, it turns out they're a government agent.
[02:38:43.542 --> 02:39:07.598]  And we have documents we're swimming in of our government staging terror attacks back over 110 years, you know, from 1898 and what happened with the Maine, to what happened with the Gulf of Tonkin, to the USS Liberty, to Operation Northwoods, to programs they carried out, like the NATO option, the Salvadoran option.
[02:39:09.308 --> 02:39:13.370]  I have army field manuals about how to carry out terror attacks and blame it on people.
[02:39:13.690 --> 02:39:19.332]  They have classified army manuals that have been declassified how to carry out terror attacks and blame it on people.
[02:39:19.593 --> 02:39:20.513]  I'm sick of it!
[02:39:20.773 --> 02:39:21.673]  I'm tired of it!
[02:39:21.974 --> 02:39:23.254]  I don't want to take your Ritalin.
[02:39:23.434 --> 02:39:24.695]  I don't want to take your Prozac.
[02:39:24.855 --> 02:39:26.676]  I don't want to drink your sodium fluoride.
[02:39:26.916 --> 02:39:30.557]  I don't want to sit here and drink the poison, the aspartame.
[02:39:30.777 --> 02:39:35.099]  I don't want to take your vaccines full of mercury that you say is nutritious on the local news.
[02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:36.820]  I mean, we have local newscasts.
[02:39:37.446 --> 02:39:42.253]  Here in Austin, and they've heard nationwide, it's the same script, saying mercury is nutritious, good for your brain.
[02:39:42.493 --> 02:39:43.795]  I mean, that's just pure bull!
[02:39:44.055 --> 02:39:45.557]  You people are out of control!
[02:39:45.577 --> 02:39:49.222]  And it freaks me out!
[02:39:49.282 --> 02:39:55.110]  I mean, it just... The public is willfully in denial, just willfully stupid about all this.
[02:39:56.252 --> 02:40:12.838]  All the energies of our economy, all the energies of America, since 1947, have been put into dumbing us down, enslaving us, tracking us, understanding our behavior, making us as stupid as they can, and we've gone from being the smartest to being the dumbest, from being the most healthy to being the most unhealthy.
[02:40:13.018 --> 02:40:17.362]  From being the innovators of the world to being the spoiled, rotten, dumb of the world.
[02:40:17.603 --> 02:40:20.145]  And they were government hits put on us.
[02:40:20.626 --> 02:40:21.667]  Government programs.
[02:40:21.687 --> 02:40:24.530]  They did it to us just so we could be controlled.
[02:40:24.810 --> 02:40:26.391]  Look what they've done to us!
[02:40:28.293 --> 02:40:32.137]  Government people listening right now, what is your major malfunction?
[02:40:36.778 --> 02:40:44.002]  Well, they're going to take your pension fund, they're going to take everything you've got, too, and you'll still love them, I know, because you're a government person, you've got a uniform, I know.
[02:40:44.842 --> 02:40:45.443]  Oh, man.
[02:40:45.483 --> 02:40:46.723]  Tim in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:40:50.145 --> 02:40:50.826]  Very nice, Tim.
[02:40:50.866 --> 02:40:51.766]  Anything you'd like to say?
[02:40:51.786 --> 02:40:55.228]  Okay, let's go to Mike in Louisiana.
[02:40:55.268 --> 02:40:55.968]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:40:56.409 --> 02:40:56.909]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:40:56.929 --> 02:40:57.489]  How are you doing today?
[02:40:57.589 --> 02:40:57.849]  Good.
[02:40:58.290 --> 02:40:59.410]  Quick statement.
[02:40:59.771 --> 02:41:05.814]  Last week here in Louisiana, they were digging up the levees to check to see if they were built to spec, because everyone was
[02:41:07.012 --> 02:41:07.612]  I don't
[02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:31.454]  It pretty much says that, well, this whole civil engineering thing is kind of a guessing game.
[02:41:31.475 --> 02:41:32.396]  You can't really test it.
[02:41:32.756 --> 02:41:36.360]  Trying to basically poo-poo the fact that maybe the whole design was wrong anyway.
[02:41:36.621 --> 02:41:40.065]  Well, we don't just have local community leaders saying they saw or heard bombs.
[02:41:40.105 --> 02:41:41.186]  We have two police officers.
[02:41:41.206 --> 02:41:46.373]  We have one beat cop and we have one senior probation officer who saw explosions.
[02:41:46.853 --> 02:41:47.934]  Yeah, so I don't know.
[02:41:48.394 --> 02:41:48.755]  You know what?
[02:41:48.815 --> 02:41:50.016]  I'm not going to debate that, see.
[02:41:50.776 --> 02:41:51.797]  I'm sure they did blow it up.
[02:41:51.877 --> 02:41:52.898]  But you know what?
[02:41:53.038 --> 02:41:54.659]  It's not just to, quote, flood the black neighborhoods.
[02:41:54.699 --> 02:42:00.084]  It's to flood the whole thing so they can take it over and run a scam and have a big diversion and pump $200 billion into it that goes to their buddies.
[02:42:00.684 --> 02:42:03.306]  I know Bush said that every contract would go to locals.
[02:42:03.727 --> 02:42:04.327]  None of them have.
[02:42:04.367 --> 02:42:06.549]  There have been two state contracts last time I checked.
[02:42:06.989 --> 02:42:12.351]  And there's hundreds of others that go to Halliburton and others, and Halliburton uses illegal aliens, and then doesn't even pay the illegal aliens.
[02:42:12.391 --> 02:42:14.692]  I mean, this is the type of greediness we're seeing.
[02:42:15.172 --> 02:42:21.195]  And then on top of it, sir, FEMA jammed the communications from word one, minute one, as the hurricane hit, Katrina hit.
[02:42:21.615 --> 02:42:23.156]  FEMA sabotaged the lines.
[02:42:23.196 --> 02:42:26.017]  The police had to, at gunpoint, pull them off stuff.
[02:42:26.257 --> 02:42:27.718]  They wouldn't let the food get in.
[02:42:27.778 --> 02:42:33.960]  And then we got the FEMA memo that said they knew that would happen, and then they spin it to where FEMA knew they were inept.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.201]  No, FEMA did this.
[02:42:36.141 --> 02:42:37.842]  Screwing up, they'll get more funding.
[02:42:38.062 --> 02:42:39.742]  Yeah, and I don't see how people buy that.
[02:42:39.802 --> 02:42:44.364]  It's like, you know, the bigger the government program is, the more it screws up, more money is going to solve it.
[02:42:45.004 --> 02:42:45.784]  And people believe it.
[02:42:45.924 --> 02:42:48.985]  Drug war doubles every 10 years, and the numbers are out.
[02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:51.946]  Even more drug use, more prisons, and they're just going to expand it.
[02:42:52.206 --> 02:42:53.967]  But they can tell you that all the stats are the same.
[02:42:55.291 --> 02:42:55.711]  Exactly.
[02:42:56.071 --> 02:42:56.471]  Thanks a lot.
[02:42:56.491 --> 02:42:56.891]  Have a good day.
[02:42:57.151 --> 02:42:57.752]  Good to hear from you.
[02:42:57.792 --> 02:42:59.032]  I appreciate you holding, Mike.
[02:42:59.052 --> 02:43:00.392]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:43:00.432 --> 02:43:01.132]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:43:01.452 --> 02:43:02.252]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:43:03.093 --> 02:43:07.774]  There was a KET program on the other night about this experiment with these gliders called Dragonfly with the Marines.
[02:43:07.794 --> 02:43:09.234]  These are like surveillance gliders.
[02:43:09.334 --> 02:43:12.675]  Have you heard the reports of this experiment that they want to do with these?
[02:43:13.255 --> 02:43:16.935]  Well, I know that the Marines all over the country have already had them flying around surveilling us.
[02:43:17.676 --> 02:43:17.996]  What was it?
[02:43:18.136 --> 02:43:18.296]  L.A.
[02:43:18.316 --> 02:43:19.476]  Times reported that they bought
[02:43:20.123 --> 02:43:25.585]  Well, when I watched that it also has like a computer and they admittedly say it's like a database of information that they
[02:43:36.755 --> 02:43:43.179]  I've got Fox News, I've got a clip somewhere in my stacks of videos from like three years ago where it showed them testing a quote domestic surveillance population control drone or something.
[02:43:43.219 --> 02:43:44.941]  It was a domestic surveillance drone.
[02:43:58.281 --> 02:44:00.442]  Uh... Riot Control Drone.
[02:44:00.582 --> 02:44:02.423]  They had some really scary name for it.
[02:44:02.724 --> 02:44:10.928]  And this little flying saucer with a turbine flies up, and has weapons on it, and orders somebody to stand still while they're face scanning to show their ID.
[02:44:12.063 --> 02:44:13.083]  I'm not kidding.
[02:44:13.123 --> 02:44:15.004]  I mean, this is what they're actually developing.
[02:44:15.464 --> 02:44:17.164]  And then now, I told people about the blimps.
[02:44:17.244 --> 02:44:18.904]  Now, five major cities have blimps.
[02:44:19.464 --> 02:44:19.864]  Tethered.
[02:44:20.164 --> 02:44:22.505]  Homeland Security with ground penetrating radar looking through their walls.
[02:44:23.605 --> 02:44:31.566]  And they're announcing nationwide that they're going to start having, there's already 144 Cessnas flying around watching us, but now it's going to be drones.
[02:44:31.626 --> 02:44:35.667]  Just drones flying around giving us orders, controlling us.
[02:44:36.427 --> 02:44:36.947]  It's admitted.
[02:44:36.987 --> 02:44:38.928]  And those can see right through walls and everything.
[02:44:39.448 --> 02:44:40.388]  Oh, they had this on the show.
[02:44:41.906 --> 02:44:42.906]  Oh, just very friendly then.
[02:44:43.727 --> 02:44:45.287]  What else was the program telling us about?
[02:44:45.307 --> 02:44:52.689]  Well, another technology experiment they were watching, as I was watching, was a little small type to go inside of houses.
[02:44:52.709 --> 02:44:58.911]  Oh, wouldn't this be neat if we could get one as small as a fly or an insect and fly around your house in surveillance to see what's going on in there?
[02:44:59.451 --> 02:45:01.492]  I mean, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
[02:45:01.772 --> 02:45:04.232]  This is for urban warfare they were talking about.
[02:45:04.432 --> 02:45:08.093]  Yeah, you go to those Marine Corps drills, it's for here in America, Chris.
[02:45:08.494 --> 02:45:09.874]  It surely is, and it's your freedom.
[02:45:10.912 --> 02:45:11.513]  It is freedom.
[02:45:11.593 --> 02:45:13.635]  Freedom is no due process.
[02:45:13.695 --> 02:45:15.236]  Freedom is being tasered.
[02:45:15.296 --> 02:45:17.018]  Freedom is having giant prisons everywhere.
[02:45:17.298 --> 02:45:20.481]  Freedom is losing your jobs and having police stomp around in Darth Vader outfits.
[02:45:20.521 --> 02:45:21.041]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:21.261 --> 02:45:21.541]  Thank you.
[02:45:21.902 --> 02:45:25.445]  Yeah, freedom is having all these public officials saying we should all be forced to take chips.
[02:45:25.945 --> 02:45:27.346]  And then if you criticize it, you're a kook.
[02:45:27.406 --> 02:45:27.867]  That's freedom.
[02:45:28.668 --> 02:45:31.070]  See, we're the weird ones for not liking it.
[02:45:31.130 --> 02:45:32.591]  They're normal when they say it on TV.
[02:45:32.671 --> 02:45:33.692]  We're radical.
[02:45:34.092 --> 02:45:36.314]  We're freaking out over all this, and we really shouldn't.
[02:45:36.935 --> 02:45:37.735]  Chris in Texas.
[02:45:37.755 --> 02:45:38.236]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:45:42.507 --> 02:45:58.697]  I just wanted to say, not to keep going back to Katrina, but what a lot of people don't realize, I was a paramedic there, I spoke to you in person, the involvement that went on to the staging of what Jesse Jackson did, he went in there with those five buses, people were left for dead!
[02:45:59.397 --> 02:46:07.442]  And EMS was ordered, all rescue personnel, ordered to stay out of New Orleans so that it would not look bad when he came in there
[02:46:08.021 --> 02:46:09.322]  They're coming to rescue those people.
[02:46:09.402 --> 02:46:10.983]  I mean, he had a National Guard Troop.
[02:46:11.063 --> 02:46:13.926]  I've never heard anybody cover this, and I've never been able to tell anybody.
[02:46:13.946 --> 02:46:15.367]  He's a CFR officer.
[02:46:15.747 --> 02:46:16.768]  It's totally staged.
[02:46:16.808 --> 02:46:21.632]  Jackson and Bush and Clinton are all buddies, and it's just all staged.
[02:46:21.852 --> 02:46:23.634]  It was there to create racial division.
[02:46:25.175 --> 02:46:27.236]  FEMA was there to make sure everything fell apart.
[02:46:27.256 --> 02:46:28.197]  This is how they do it.
[02:46:30.759 --> 02:46:32.841]  I was aware of that, but why don't you tell folks more about it?
[02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:36.261]  Well, basically, this was day five.
[02:46:36.281 --> 02:46:39.623]  A lot of people don't realize this is actually the day that FEMA was supposedly supposed to take over.
[02:46:39.643 --> 02:46:41.744]  They'd ordered everybody to stay out.
[02:46:41.784 --> 02:46:44.725]  I went ahead and went in, because I knew they still needed help.
[02:46:45.486 --> 02:46:47.767]  They had entire nursing homes dropped off at my feet.
[02:46:47.847 --> 02:46:52.709]  There were infants that were unconscious, about to die, that hadn't eaten in four days.
[02:46:53.149 --> 02:46:53.690]  And they were left.
[02:46:53.710 --> 02:46:54.730]  We were begging people.
[02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:58.312]  The only way that we got help was I actually got to grab one of the helicopter pilots.
[02:46:58.732 --> 02:47:02.534]  And this was at, everybody's got to realize, this was at Tempton Causeway, the main refugee camp.
[02:47:03.126 --> 02:47:07.711]  And I grabbed one of him and started yelling at him, and he went on a divert to get some of these people out of here.
[02:47:08.231 --> 02:47:15.759]  At the end, when everybody was going to the Louis Armstrong International Airport, where the main stage hospital,
[02:47:16.127 --> 02:47:17.368]  They had no place left to take them.
[02:47:17.388 --> 02:47:17.868]  They stopped.
[02:47:18.088 --> 02:47:20.509]  They started bringing them back to us at Tim and Cosway.
[02:47:20.549 --> 02:47:22.890]  I mean, critically ill people.
[02:47:22.910 --> 02:47:28.232]  And even days afterwards, I mean, just the amount of resources that I witnessed turned away the day after the hurricane.
[02:47:28.272 --> 02:47:30.854]  Well, I mean, that's what the emergency manager said.
[02:47:30.874 --> 02:47:32.354]  They had to watch their family die.
[02:47:32.795 --> 02:47:37.136]  And FEMA ordered no one in to help because they had to, quote, go, oh, look, we screwed up.
[02:47:37.156 --> 02:47:38.137]  We need triple the funding.
[02:47:38.477 --> 02:47:40.318]  It's just a cynical way to get control.
[02:47:42.779 --> 02:47:43.600]  Well, I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:44.640]  You're doing a great job.
[02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:45.841]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:45.881 --> 02:47:46.702]  Take care, my friend.
[02:47:46.762 --> 02:47:47.362]  Last call.
[02:47:47.782 --> 02:47:48.583]  Everett in Ohio.
[02:47:48.643 --> 02:47:49.223]  Everett, go ahead.
[02:47:49.243 --> 02:47:52.205]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:52.506 --> 02:47:52.806]  Yes?
[02:47:52.926 --> 02:47:58.970]  I've been researching the Help of America Vote Act of 2002 because our local TV stations have been saying that
[02:47:59.625 --> 02:48:02.727]  We're required to put in these electronic touchscreen machines.
[02:48:02.747 --> 02:48:03.288]  And you're not!
[02:48:03.388 --> 02:48:09.732]  It just says if the states or the counties want the money, the feds will pay to have Diebold fraud machines put in for you.
[02:48:09.872 --> 02:48:20.479]  Well, for people, that's section 301 and I'll read it and it says, Verify may not be defined in any manner to make it impossible for a paper ballot voting system to meet the requirement.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.422]  If you could give us information on what manufacturers make those machines,
[02:48:25.407 --> 02:48:27.049]  That we could get information to our candidates.
[02:48:27.089 --> 02:48:27.929]  Stay there, stay there, Everett.
[02:48:28.109 --> 02:48:32.053]  But the big point here is, and I've seen the same newscast here, it's always the same script.
[02:48:32.834 --> 02:48:35.076]  By law, we've got to take these machines.
[02:48:35.176 --> 02:48:35.957]  It's the law.
[02:48:36.457 --> 02:48:36.998]  Not the law.
[02:48:37.478 --> 02:48:40.240]  It's six million bucks to pay to put the fraud machines in.
[02:48:41.021 --> 02:48:43.603]  And, you know, it's just more pure lies.
[02:48:43.644 --> 02:48:44.184]  Everything's lies.
[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:49.742]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.003 --> 02:48:51.584]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:51:45.543 --> 02:51:57.547]  Hi, we disconnected Tim so he wants a chance to say what he had to say.
[02:51:57.567 --> 02:52:00.448]  He'll have to do it quickly because I want to get into this article.
[02:52:02.268 --> 02:52:06.691]  About the black boxes, which are really orange boxes with stripes on them.
[02:52:07.491 --> 02:52:08.212]  Yeah, it's admitted.
[02:52:08.232 --> 02:52:11.154]  I mean, the FBI grabbed them and declared national security and won't release them.
[02:52:11.434 --> 02:52:12.274]  And they lied about it.
[02:52:12.294 --> 02:52:14.556]  They've been caught and there's another article about it today.
[02:52:14.596 --> 02:52:16.557]  But real quick, Everett in Ohio.
[02:52:17.711 --> 02:52:25.473]  You bring up this point about how they say it's the law, we've got to take the new voting machines with no record, connected to all this fraud.
[02:52:26.333 --> 02:52:28.694]  And really, there is no law.
[02:52:28.714 --> 02:52:36.336]  It just says if the states want the money, they can take the money to put in new, recommended, all of course fraud-driven systems.
[02:52:37.337 --> 02:52:40.017]  But so many systems are bad.
[02:52:40.037 --> 02:52:44.879]  I mean, even the Scantron systems are bad, because that is then fed into a computer.
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:47.460]  Go ahead and finish up your comments.
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:53:11.305]  Well, in trying to read Section 301, I don't understand what it's even upgrading, unless it says that you need to have it accessible to people with limited literacy and alternate languages, but it doesn't, it says that, it indicates that you can still use the voting machine, the same voting machines, as long as it updates these things, so I wish people would read over that.
[02:53:12.045 --> 02:53:14.646]  Section 301, go to the commissioners, and then if you have any
[02:53:16.013 --> 02:53:24.821]  Any companies that provide the lever, the old machines, because the experts are going to the county commissioners and saying, there are no other manufacturers, we have to get these.
[02:53:24.841 --> 02:53:27.283]  No, no, it's a national scam, thanks for the call.
[02:53:27.843 --> 02:53:29.485]  And if they get all this in, it's over.
[02:53:29.645 --> 02:53:31.587]  No, you voted to be put in the FEMA camp.
[02:53:31.627 --> 02:53:33.648]  Yeah, you voted to have your pension fund taken.
[02:53:33.929 --> 02:53:35.490]  Uh-huh, see, the machine said so.
[02:53:36.211 --> 02:53:38.833]  I mean, the Diebold head guy just had to resign.
[02:53:39.133 --> 02:53:42.236]  There's all this fraud coming out, but oh, let's put their machines in.
[02:53:42.576 --> 02:53:43.397]  Oh, here, yes.
[02:53:45.286 --> 02:53:55.773]  9-1-1 Missing Black Boxes and World Trade Center Attacks Found by Firefighters Analyzed by NTSB Concealed by FBI by Dave Lindorf, Counterpunch.
[02:53:57.674 --> 02:54:05.299]  And it says on the, um, one of the more puzzling mysteries of 9-11 is whatever happened to the flight recorders of the two planes that hit the World Trade Center towers?
[02:54:05.439 --> 02:54:07.380]  Now it appears they may not be missing at all.
[02:54:08.781 --> 02:54:09.282]  Oh, really?
[02:54:09.422 --> 02:54:12.604]  And Counterpunch has learned that the FBI has them?
[02:54:13.866 --> 02:54:17.409]  Well, that's been in the Philadelphia Daily News two years ago.
[02:54:18.190 --> 02:54:25.437]  Flight recorders, commonly known as black boxes, though these days they are generally bright orange, are required on all passenger planes.
[02:54:25.457 --> 02:54:31.583]  They are always to a flight data recorder that keeps track of the people's speed, altitude, and course.
[02:54:32.543 --> 02:54:36.184]  And then it goes into all four of the devices were recovered from the two planes that hit the Pentagon.
[02:54:36.485 --> 02:54:40.246]  We have witnesses that saw three, and at the rural crash in Pennsylvania.
[02:54:40.286 --> 02:54:50.810]  In the case of Flight 77, which hit the Pentagon, the FBI reports that the flight data recorder survived and had recoverable information, but the voice recorder was allegedly too damaged to provide any record.
[02:54:50.930 --> 02:54:52.471]  Oh, so now they're going to produce that one.
[02:54:53.217 --> 02:55:00.463]  No, and in the case of United Airlines Flight 93, which hit the ground at 500 miles per hour in Pennsylvania, the situation was reversed.
[02:55:00.943 --> 02:55:04.927]  The voice recorder survived, but the flight data box was allegedly damaged beyond recovery.
[02:55:05.467 --> 02:55:13.714]  But the FBI states, and also the 9-11 Commission reports, that none of the recording devices from the two planes that hit the World Trade Center were ever recovered.
[02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:29.751]  Uh, but now, uh, the FBI, it says that, is saying there's stronger evidence that something is amiss, and that simply the alleged non-recovery of all four boxes, a source of the National Transportation Safety Board, so the agency has had the task of
[02:55:31.818 --> 02:55:40.140]  Deciphering the data that came back from boxes retrieved from the crash sites, including those that are being handled as crimes, and fall under the jurisdiction of the FBI.
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:48.242]  So the NTSB is saying the FBI does have, it's a long article, it's on PrisonPlanet.com, and they did dig up some new information and we commend them.
[02:55:48.582 --> 02:55:51.383]  But they've already been caught red-handed sneaking off of three of them.
[02:55:52.163 --> 02:55:54.884]  I'm sorry Tim, we didn't have time to get to you.
[02:55:55.004 --> 02:55:58.665]  I was going to try, but I tried to rush through that and it was incoherent.
[02:56:00.283 --> 02:56:03.605]  I'll see you back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:04.065 --> 02:56:06.707]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:07.507 --> 02:56:09.048]  Get out there and expose corruption.
[02:56:09.388 --> 02:56:19.395]  Get out there and help us get America back to what its founding principles are, liberty and freedom, land of the free, home of the brave, not land of the slave and, you know, home of the stupid.
[02:56:19.895 --> 02:56:20.495]  We're out of here.
[02:56:20.555 --> 02:56:21.536]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.556 --> 02:56:22.957]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
