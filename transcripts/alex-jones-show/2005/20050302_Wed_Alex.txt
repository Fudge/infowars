[00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:06.315]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:08.056]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:09.916]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:11.357]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:14.017]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:21.919]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:34.755]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:35.915]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:39.217]  It is Wednesday, the second day of March 2005.
[00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:41.417]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:43.718]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:58.804]  We have a preeminent expert on nanotechnology revolution and how it will change our societal systems forever in the next ten years, coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:12.357]  And then I came across an article on PrisonPlanet.com today that was already about five days old from the Globe and Mail, mainstream newspaper out of Toronto, Canada.
[00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:24.902]  Hunter Thompson was working on WTC Collapse Story before mysterious sudden death, warned he'd be suicided and told a writer
[00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:35.119]  for the Toronto Globe and Mail this over the phone the night before he died and that was in the Globe and Mail.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.701]  Very, very interesting.
[00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:42.262]  Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.625]  Also, rein in the Patriot Act.
[00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:48.325]  Some legislators urge
[00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:54.969]  Concerned voice that broad surveillance provisions pose threat to civil rights.
[00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.070]  The set of the AP will be covering it.
[00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.911]  Iraqi police committed torture and rape, says U.S.
[00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.373]  Well, yeah, they're the former Ba'athists put back into power.
[00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.895]  And a lot of people that weren't resisting the occupation now are because of it.
[00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:40.926]  peers to the crown or the house of lords are lining up to condemn terrifying house arrest plan for basically any reason in England you can be arrested now if you're rude to someone this is mainstream news they've already passed laws where you can be basically committed as a criminal not as a mental patient but labeled as a belligerent troublemaker
[00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:48.560]  And if you drop bubble gum on the street, 500 pound fines, the list goes on and on.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.261]  Well now, just house arrests for entire populations.
[00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:53.621]  Total martial law.
[00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.202]  There's a lot of resistance amounting to it.
[00:02:57.042 --> 00:03:10.226]  You know, I hadn't gotten into the BTK killer, the alleged killer, that they say they caught last Friday, until I started listening to the news over the weekend, the last few days, driving in the car.
[00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:14.824]  They always describe him as Christian, family man.
[00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:24.327]  It's funny, when a black guy is a serial killer, they don't go black man, or when a Jew kills somebody, they don't go a Jewish man.
[00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:39.072]  But every time it's a Christian, or it's a conservative, you know, a supposed Christian or conservative, they tell you over and over again, family man, family man, family man, family man,
[00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:44.847]  When an Indian goes out and kills somebody, they don't go, an Indian who was a Buddhist.
[00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:47.689]  What is going on here?
[00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.892]  I mean, sure, this goes to show that, they don't like to mention he's a government official either.
[00:03:55.013 --> 00:04:06.859]  I mean, I've read the articles and it admits he was a government official, authority, but when you listen to radio or watch a little snip of the TV, which I did a few nights ago, it's, he was a Christian.
[00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.948]  He was a family man.
[00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:12.128]  He was a government official.
[00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.770]  Demonizing the word family man.
[00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.271]  Ooh, family man!
[00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.791]  They must be serial killers!
[00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.753]  So we'll cover this report as well.
[00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:26.213]  And again, he's an alleged killer.
[00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:33.676]  I also want to get into this Financial Times of London fear-mongering article.
[00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:37.357]  The world is not ready for a flu pandemic.
[00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.450]  And Bush, final social security action may not happen yet.
[00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:49.172]  Senator wants cable, satellite TV subjected to decency rules.
[00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.413]  And a lot more big broadcasts lined up for you today.
[00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:57.555]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:04:57.635 --> 00:04:58.535]  Be sure and check them out.
[00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:05.441]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.044]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:14.587]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:15.968]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:17.709]  Panama!
[00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:18.529]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:47.368]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:10.462]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:21.949]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:27.312]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:28.013]  Are no problem.
[00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:34.899]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.925]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:43.967]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:46.289]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.392]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:50.053]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:58.558]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:08.142]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology, but have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:07:08.363 --> 00:07:15.306]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:22.329]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by colored crayons.
[00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.110]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.050]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.
[00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:38.375]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:45.137]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:50.019]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:52.740]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.542]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the Bio-Ox family of products.
[00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:05.954]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.374 --> 00:08:08.655]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:22.502]  We know that Princess Diana is on videotape.
[00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:25.624]  But they had the British government seize it.
[00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:27.565]  The letters have been published.
[00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:31.499]  She said, Prince Charles is going to have me murdered.
[00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:36.142]  I've been told it's going to be made to look like a fake auto accident.
[00:08:37.443 --> 00:08:40.165]  It's going to be staged during an auto accident.
[00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.387]  And, um, what?
[00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:46.730]  Six months later, she died in an auto accident in Paris.
[00:08:48.419 --> 00:09:06.948]  We know that Dr. David Kelly, the head of Porton Down Bioweapons Lab, developing race-specific bioweapons, also the head British envoy to the UN weapons inspectors, told an American and British inspector colleagues that, they're going to kill me and leave me in the woods if I don't shut up.
[00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:08.629]  That's a quote, by the way.
[00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.632]  We know that many other people say, they're going to kill me, I've been death-threatened, and then they
[00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:19.772]  Well, get their heads blown off, or they slit their wrists and there's no blood at the scene.
[00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:25.676]  Or they shoot themselves, in the case of Vince Foster, and there's no blood at the scene.
[00:09:25.736 --> 00:09:31.580]  And, you know, Clinton has them scrubbing the walls and carpet cleaning the carpets and won't let the police into his office.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.181]  He's found out in the park.
[00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:36.583]  And the gun in his hand doesn't match the caliber.
[00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:42.647]  We do know, from two different personal friends of Gary Webb,
[00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:58.388]  That he was told, the Pulitzer Prize winner of the Dark Alliance series about CIA cocaine trafficking, that he had been followed, he had been harassed, and he had talked about how he'd been threatened.
[00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:03.793]  But then we're told the official story by the Grand Poobahs,
[00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.445]  That, uh, no, he committed suicide.
[00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:08.786]  Shot himself twice in the head.
[00:10:08.826 --> 00:10:11.707]  Why, contrary to popular belief, that's quite common.
[00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:13.927]  Of course, it's not, unless you're in Arkansas.
[00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:19.850]  You know, two shotgun blasts to the back of the head, and Tammy Malick, the famous medical examiner, says you committed suicide.
[00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:31.274]  Gary Webb supposedly shot himself with a .357, blew his jaw off and a bunch of his teeth out of the front of his face, and then shot himself again in the head.
[00:10:32.234 --> 00:10:33.455]  Well, I'll tell you, he's a tough guy.
[00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:38.506]  You slug most people on the chin real hard, they're going to be dazed.
[00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:44.450]  You blow somebody's jaw off with a high caliber, high powered handgun, and they're not going to be feeling too good.
[00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.172]  In fact, the first shot, the coroner's report clearly shows, would have killed him.
[00:10:48.993 --> 00:10:51.875]  But, uh... Well, you know how it is.
[00:10:54.717 --> 00:10:57.378]  But, Hunter S. Thompson, it was a Sunday night.
[00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:01.421]  I'd just driven to the store to get a cup of hot tea, because I had to work
[00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:05.427]  An 18-hour day that day, trying to finish this film like I did last night.
[00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:07.088]  Almost done, folks.
[00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:09.729]  I'm doing the credits today.
[00:11:09.749 --> 00:11:29.979]  It was about a week and a half ago on a Sunday, and I'm about to park my car, drinking tea, and Drudge starts basically making fun of Hunter S. Thompson, and talking about how he supposedly committed suicide.
[00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:31.600]  This just out, and I just thought, man,
[00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:35.939]  That stinks to high heaven, but I said I don't have time to worry about it.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.482]  I'm going to work on the film.
[00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:45.464]  And, you know, I can't keep track of all the news.
[00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.666]  That's why the millions of listeners this broadcast has are so important.
[00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:56.511]  Because you're able to send us the emails and read the hundreds of newspapers that I may miss.
[00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.594]  And an article that we do have posted on, right now,
[00:12:02.884 --> 00:12:09.466]  PrisonPlanet.com was by Paul Roberts, a writer for the Toronto Globe and Mail, mainstream respected paper.
[00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:18.209]  Hunter Thompson was working for WTC Collapse Story before mysterious sudden death, warned he'd be suicided.
[00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.811]  This is what Paul Roberts wrote, a friend of Hunter's.
[00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:26.372]  Hunter telephoned me on February 19th, the night before his death.
[00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:28.093]  He sounded scared.
[00:12:29.907 --> 00:12:33.569]  It wasn't always easy to understand what he said, particularly over the phone.
[00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:34.509]  He mumbled.
[00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:38.410]  Yet when there was something he really wanted you to understand, you did.
[00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:53.637]  He'd been working on a story about the World Trade Center attacks, and stumbled across what he felt was hard evidence showing the towers had been brought down, not by the airplanes that flew into them, but by explosive charges set off in their foundations.
[00:12:54.637 --> 00:12:57.678]  What, did Hunter watch PBS and see the owners say they blew it up?
[00:12:57.738 --> 00:12:58.659]  I mean, what?
[00:12:58.719 --> 00:12:59.439]  That type of evidence?
[00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:03.177]  Now he thought someone was out to stop him publishing it.
[00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:06.780]  They're gonna make it look like a suicide, he said.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.042]  I know how these bastards think.
[00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:12.765]  Hunter S. Thompson was indeed working on such a story.
[00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:18.990]  Now check out this February 25th Associated Press story about Thompson's death.
[00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.293]  Sounds like a professional hit with a silencer.
[00:13:23.394 --> 00:13:24.715]  I was on the telephone with him.
[00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:26.657]  He set the receiver down.
[00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:29.062]  And he did it.
[00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:30.923]  I heard the clicking of the gun.
[00:13:31.284 --> 00:13:36.747]  Anita Thompson told the Aspen Daily News in Friday's editions.
[00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:43.170]  She said her husband had asked her to come home from the health club so they could work on his weekly ESPN column.
[00:13:44.511 --> 00:13:49.433]  Thompson said she heard a loud muffled noise but didn't know what had happened.
[00:13:50.294 --> 00:13:51.174]  So she heard it happen.
[00:13:51.194 --> 00:13:52.515]  He's on the phone and boom!
[00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:56.297]  He's saying, come on baby, let's write an article and then he blows his head off supposedly.
[00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:58.339]  Loveless is really good at that.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.641]  I was waiting for him to get back on the phone, she said.
[00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:07.902]  Her account to the Rocky Mountain News reporter, Jeff Kass, is slightly different.
[00:14:07.922 --> 00:14:11.203]  I did not hear any bang, she told Kass.
[00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:21.726]  She added that Thompson's son, who was in the house at the time, believed that a book had fallen when he heard the shot, according to Kass' report.
[00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:27.396]  And our good buddy Mack White sums up the questions well.
[00:14:28.177 --> 00:14:34.479]  Thomas' family says he was not depressed, nor was he in enough pain to kill himself.
[00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:37.060]  In fact, by all reports, he was quite happy.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:46.483]  He was talking on the phone to his wife, getting ready to work on a column, when he decided it would be wise to kill himself so that he could go
[00:14:47.464 --> 00:14:59.026]  Out, we are told, while still at the top of his form, even though this would mean not finishing his column or his expose on 9-1-1, potentially the most important thing he would ever write.
[00:15:00.126 --> 00:15:04.007]  Hunter S. Thompson's suicide story changes as a related article.
[00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:15.649]  This account says Thompson killed himself while sitting in a chair on his typewriter, and yet the original account tells us that Thompson shot himself while talking to his wife on the phone in the kitchen.
[00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:30.532]  Why has the story changed and what is the significance of the word typed on the papers in light of the fact that Thompson said he would be suicided before being able to release a major story on explosions bringing down the towers.
[00:15:33.013 --> 00:15:34.353]  And there's another related article.
[00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:37.594]  Hunter S. Thompson thought 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:44.455]  So he told one of his friends who's written a story about it in the Toronto Globe and Mail
[00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:51.501]  But you've got to pay to get in to read the rest of it, because I didn't learn about it on the first day when it was free up on the site.
[00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:54.442]  I don't know, maybe somebody will go pay for it and get it.
[00:15:54.962 --> 00:16:01.424]  I didn't have time to register this morning and get the whole story, but Hunter S. Thompson, they're going to kill me.
[00:16:01.664 --> 00:16:04.245]  I'm on a story about them blowing up the World Trade Center.
[00:16:06.506 --> 00:16:07.006]  Oh boy.
[00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:13.888]  Again, I don't know what really happened here, but Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:20.722]  Would they kill him over something he was about to report on?
[00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:21.763]  I don't know.
[00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:27.288]  I mean, 9-11 being an inside job is public.
[00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:31.351]  Most Americans believe it now in major polls.
[00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:45.702]  That's why from CNN to NPR to Popular Mechanics to Vanity Fair, they're all in overdrive trying to assassinate my character and other people's characters.
[00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:57.452]  And sometimes that's a precursor to them terminating, liquidating, annihilating, erasing people.
[00:16:57.532 --> 00:16:58.613]  But there's too many of us.
[00:16:58.693 --> 00:17:02.417]  It's just... We're like shark teeth.
[00:17:02.697 --> 00:17:05.660]  You know, you pull out one set, another set rolls forward.
[00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:11.546]  It's kind of like when you look into a mirror with another mirror behind you and it's just an endless
[00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:15.578]  In this hall of mirrors, you cannot stop us.
[00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:18.741]  We will be defeated at New World Order.
[00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:25.905]  But, uh, who knows if he had some inside dynamic info that was really going to hurt him.
[00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.008]  You know, so much other dynamic info has come out.
[00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.089]  I mean, legions of it.
[00:17:31.209 --> 00:17:36.533]  Confirmed, admitted, prior knowledge, involvement, funding the terrorists, running drills.
[00:17:37.714 --> 00:17:39.675]  The so-called hijackers were just
[00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:42.302]  Government officers part of the drills?
[00:17:45.344 --> 00:17:46.605]  It's all part of the record.
[00:17:48.045 --> 00:17:51.447]  And the way to save this country is being bold and telling the truth.
[00:17:51.507 --> 00:17:54.129]  I mean, when I say the government, it wasn't our government that did 9-11.
[00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:58.732]  It was a very small criminal group, you know, even above Bush.
[00:17:58.792 --> 00:18:03.294]  Bush really is a gibbering puppet, just like the rest of the people up there in Washington.
[00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:07.717]  I mean, George Bush could resign from office tomorrow.
[00:18:07.737 --> 00:18:09.658]  The New World Order will just keep rolling on.
[00:18:11.067 --> 00:18:12.808]  John Kerry could have been elected.
[00:18:12.828 --> 00:18:15.370]  You'd see the exact same stuff today.
[00:18:18.092 --> 00:18:19.013]  Some good news, though.
[00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:28.240]  Reign in Patriot Act, some legislators urge, concerns voiced that broad surveillance provisions pose threat to civil rights.
[00:18:29.061 --> 00:18:39.629]  Some legislators warn to tell Congress they think the flagship federal law aimed at fighting terrorism should be changed to make sure it doesn't compromise people's civil rights.
[00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:53.952]  The State House and Senate Judiciary Committees heard public testimony yesterday on the measure that would urge Congress to pass a new law limiting some of the USA Patriot Act's broad surveillance provisions.
[00:18:55.912 --> 00:18:59.393]  This is out of Washington State.
[00:19:00.713 --> 00:19:07.515]  There's now four states that have already passed these laws, over 400 cities and towns, and those numbers are almost a year old.
[00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:07.875]  I haven't
[00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:13.128]  I've gone and spent two hours trying to dig up the actual numbers on this since then.
[00:19:14.229 --> 00:19:20.710]  I've seen, I don't know, probably 50 other cities and towns do it since then, so it's gotta be over 450, but let's just say 400.
[00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:26.232]  The mainstream media is now up to like 350 when you see reports, but it's well past that.
[00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:30.373]  They don't count like small towns that are a couple thousand people though, so.
[00:19:31.614 --> 00:19:33.894]  We don't know all the towns that have done it, we just know it's over 400.
[00:19:34.455 --> 00:19:38.676]  But here, this will be a fifth state if they do this.
[00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:44.461]  But, uh, it's good news.
[00:19:44.481 --> 00:19:47.543]  At least people are aware of what's happening.
[00:19:47.983 --> 00:19:49.644]  We'll come back, cover a bunch of other news.
[00:19:49.684 --> 00:19:50.424]  Take your calls.
[00:19:50.484 --> 00:19:52.385]  Got a big guest on Nanotech coming up.
[00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:53.086]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:53.106 --> 00:19:54.006]  And, uh, personplanted.tv.
[00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:55.287]  Might want to check it out as well.
[00:20:02.194 --> 00:20:07.718]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:08.919]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:09.920]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.882]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:13.063 --> 00:20:17.946]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:18.187 --> 00:20:19.267]  Check out this new product.
[00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.330]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.373]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:20:26.613 --> 00:20:29.215]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.

[00:20:37.642 --> 00:20:43.086]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:43.927]  Try No-B-O.

[00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:46.510]  No B.O.

[00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:04.832]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:06.232]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:11.336]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:14.938]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:23:14.998 --> 00:23:16.939]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:17.520]  Cardivite.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.020]  Cardivite.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.581]  We all use Cardivite!

[00:23:40.575 --> 00:23:41.075]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:53.184]  I don't think so.
[00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:27.215]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:24:27.235 --> 00:24:31.316]  We're going to get more into the Patriot Act being thrown out by more states and cities around the country.
[00:24:33.117 --> 00:24:36.458]  Also, I want to get into Iraqi police committed torture and rapes as U.S.
[00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:38.198]  official.
[00:24:38.638 --> 00:24:40.059]  Well, I mean, who isn't over there?
[00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:44.740]  And we'll also get into people fighting back against the police state in England.
[00:24:45.642 --> 00:24:55.966]  The BTK murderer up in the Midwest, the alleged murderer, and how they're calling him a family man, a Christian, playing up that word over and over again.
[00:24:56.366 --> 00:24:58.186]  The world is not ready for a flu pandemic.
[00:24:58.447 --> 00:25:01.828]  More fear-mongering out of Interpol, this out of the Financial Times of London.
[00:25:02.428 --> 00:25:03.108]  It's all coming up.
[00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:04.609]  But I want to go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:07.570]  And I'm told this is Vox from New York.
[00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.310]  Is this the Vox I met in New York?
[00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:10.551]  Yes, it's he.
[00:25:10.571 --> 00:25:12.631]  How are you doing, man?
[00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:13.232]  Good.
[00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:14.112]  It's good to talk to you.
[00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.204]  Yeah, good to hear from you.
[00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:23.153]  I was calling about the Hunter Thompson thing that you were talking about, but I actually wanted to talk about the Everly thing as well.
[00:25:23.675 --> 00:25:25.396]  Well, I've got to get you on as a guest sometime.
[00:25:25.456 --> 00:25:35.222]  I had the privilege and the pleasure to ride around with you on your big jet boat at night, giving us a tour, and then to be pulled over twice by gunboats with machine guns.
[00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:36.022]  That was a lot of fun.
[00:25:36.042 --> 00:25:41.285]  Yeah, well, it was the high point of my Republican convention, having you as a guest.
[00:25:41.425 --> 00:25:42.326]  Well, you're a great guy.
[00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:43.507]  What's on your mind?
[00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:52.512]  Well, I guess it's time that we should put up some sort of anti-suicide website, so that could be sort of like a repository for researchers like us.
[00:25:53.272 --> 00:25:53.793]  We're good to go.
[00:26:11.164 --> 00:26:12.425]  That's not grounds for suicide.
[00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:19.171]  Because it'll always be some simplistic thing like, you know, okay, he was depressed, but he mentioned that he split up with his girlfriend.
[00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:21.553]  Oh, well, okay, then that's okay.
[00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:22.854]  He suicided himself, you know.
[00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:24.916]  So that's the one thing I wanted to talk about.
[00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:30.701]  And the other thing was, um, I don't know if you've been covering it because I haven't caught your show, but the Everly Gannon, uh, you know about this Everly guy?
[00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:33.003]  Who's behind Gannon and Guckert?
[00:26:33.324 --> 00:26:36.366]  Apparently he was the key witness to the Pentagon 77 flight crash.
[00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:49.167]  You know, that's been pointed out, and again, one of the key witnesses to seeing the plane at the Pentagon turns out to be one of these paid White House reporters.
[00:26:49.807 --> 00:26:55.451]  Yeah, well, I mean, that would point out that he's either with Rove or with the CIA.
[00:26:55.892 --> 00:27:02.597]  I will say that Everly, I mean, that seems like, it depends on when he made his declaration of that
[00:27:03.943 --> 00:27:04.903]  of him witnessing.
[00:27:04.963 --> 00:27:16.493]  If he made that within hours of the crash, then he would most likely be placed as a CIA operative or with the actual people who did the attacks.
[00:27:17.213 --> 00:27:21.917]  So, Everly, this might be one of these smoking guns that should be looked at.
[00:27:22.698 --> 00:27:25.120]  Because that's a little bit too suspicious.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.383]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, everything's getting crazier and crazier.
[00:27:30.584 --> 00:27:30.785]  Yeah.
[00:27:31.165 --> 00:27:31.906]  And in the case of
[00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:40.697]  Hunter Thompson or Princess Diana or Dr. David Kelly or Gary Webb, they say, I'm being threatened, I may be killed.
[00:27:41.517 --> 00:27:47.920]  And then people come out of the woodwork going, oh no, he was very upset.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.061]  And of course the whole Gary Webb thing.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:59.102]  There's no way anyone's going to convince me that you're going to fire into your face, and then actually be able to even hold a gun, much less cock it and fire a second time.
[00:27:59.262 --> 00:27:59.702]  No way.
[00:28:00.202 --> 00:28:13.606]  No way anyone says... Yeah, folks, just, I mean, don't try this at home, but, uh, you know, that's like, uh, jump off a 20-foot roof, and then that's like saying you're going to climb back up on the roof and jump off again on your head.
[00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:14.346]  Yeah.
[00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:19.487]  Or, you know, hit yourself full force with a hammer in your temple and then do it again.
[00:28:22.466 --> 00:28:36.693]  It's so amazing how they also seem to manage to get a few key family members, like in this case, in Hunter's case, the wife is now blathering about how she knows that this is a great thing and this is a wonderful thing he did.
[00:28:36.713 --> 00:28:42.475]  In the case of Gary Webb, there's reports that the family is sure that this is not a...
[00:28:46.923 --> 00:28:55.646]  Friends, and we find in the major newspaper section, people Webb had criticized, hop up and go, look, case closed, it's official.
[00:28:57.927 --> 00:29:00.187]  Let me just tell you, he committed suicide, end of story.
[00:29:00.527 --> 00:29:06.429]  Sure, well, Al Giordano did that to, what's his name, Gary Webb?
[00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:08.890]  Did you read the Giordano article from Narco News?
[00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:09.863]  No, I didn't.
[00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:11.984]  With friends like that, who needs the Grim Reaper?
[00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:18.386]  The guy was like, oh no, he committed suicide, no problem, open and shut, forget it, I've been friends with him for a long time, this was a great thing he did.
[00:29:20.747 --> 00:29:31.150]  And then you have the Spax Baxter, who, in my opinion, was probably an operative at the end of the street, the one at the other end of the street.
[00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:35.332]  He closed off the street, approached him, under the guise of maybe a fake cop car,
[00:29:36.144 --> 00:29:39.127]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:39.387 --> 00:29:42.029]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.371 --> 00:31:02.992]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.132 --> 00:31:07.236]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.376 --> 00:31:10.238]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:17.044]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.224 --> 00:31:20.246]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.426 --> 00:31:22.848]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:30.855]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:31:31.535 --> 00:31:42.437]  Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.577 --> 00:31:50.338]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:03.115 --> 00:32:08.582]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.023 --> 00:32:13.248]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:13.488 --> 00:32:20.497]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:26.998]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.138 --> 00:32:28.379]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:31.659]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:33.840]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:26.856]  Big guest on Nanocheck coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:28.858]  It's going to revolutionize our world.
[00:33:28.878 --> 00:33:34.062]  That's what the globalists are racing to get total police state controls in now.
[00:33:35.103 --> 00:33:44.391]  Because this is going to totally end their monopoly of control unless they get an iron-clad dictatorship in place now.
[00:33:45.932 --> 00:33:51.217]  Totally shifting the entire socio-economic and political paradigm.
[00:33:52.392 --> 00:33:53.433]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:33:53.473 --> 00:33:55.595]  Let's talk to Russell in Florida.
[00:33:56.215 --> 00:33:58.217]  Welcome, my Floridian friend.
[00:33:58.237 --> 00:33:59.218]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:33:59.318 --> 00:34:00.679]  Good to talk to you again.
[00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:01.220]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.842]  I'm anxiously awaiting your martial law release.
[00:34:04.102 --> 00:34:07.805]  I've got a bunch of friends here that are quite fond of you and your work.
[00:34:08.026 --> 00:34:16.273]  It's going up on PrisonPlanet.tv tomorrow night at the latest Friday morning.
[00:34:17.094 --> 00:34:19.616]  And it'll be on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:20.456]  Can't wait.
[00:34:20.496 --> 00:34:25.320]  I think this is, in my opinion, a bigger release to me than The Passion of the Christ.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.401]  I can't wait to see it.
[00:34:27.421 --> 00:34:30.083]  I don't want to... I mean, look, it is an epic.
[00:34:30.183 --> 00:34:36.727]  It's really... I had a screening last night with a few friends, and they said, man, this is like a mini-series or an epic.
[00:34:37.488 --> 00:34:42.331]  It's really three major 15-minute films.
[00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:44.933]  You said you had an awakening while doing it, right?
[00:34:45.353 --> 00:34:45.633]  Yes.
[00:34:45.693 --> 00:34:46.654]  Like, spiritual for you?
[00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:51.439]  I mean, it was just so much stuff happened while we were in New York.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.661]  You know, we're not just talking about the Illuminati and we run into them on the street.
[00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:59.582]  You know, these top White House people, you know, they don't deny it.
[00:34:59.602 --> 00:35:00.723]  They get in your face over it.
[00:35:00.743 --> 00:35:03.804]  Well, that's what we love about you, Alex.
[00:35:03.844 --> 00:35:06.205]  You get in their faces and you challenge them and you're not afraid.
[00:35:07.345 --> 00:35:08.785]  That's one of the reasons why we love you.
[00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:10.186]  Well, you only live once.
[00:35:10.799 --> 00:35:11.859]  That's true, that's true.
[00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:13.480]  Might as well live full throttle.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.341]  You said you've been empowered by fighting this and I believe that.
[00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.302]  You definitely have, God's called you to do this.
[00:35:20.442 --> 00:35:32.246]  I have a question for you regarding the, I missed some of your shows last week and when you were commenting on the Popular Mechanics article and the 9-11 attacks, 9-11 straw man lies.
[00:35:33.146 --> 00:35:35.867]  Can you comment on that and comment on the
[00:35:37.152 --> 00:35:51.781]  You know, I'm open for everybody to have their own views about 9-11 and to debate what they think the strongest evidence is.
[00:35:52.802 --> 00:35:55.104]  And overall, no, I don't think so.
[00:35:55.124 --> 00:35:56.365]  I mean, I had him on the broadcast.
[00:35:56.385 --> 00:35:57.766]  He doesn't agree with everything I say.
[00:35:57.786 --> 00:35:59.947]  I don't agree with everything he says.
[00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:01.308]  But, you know, none of us do.
[00:36:01.808 --> 00:36:05.511]  We're dealing with just a orgy of evidence.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.200]  On 9-11.
[00:36:08.421 --> 00:36:11.823]  And people like him argue, you know, let's focus on the most concrete stuff.
[00:36:12.963 --> 00:36:23.848]  And I tend to agree with him to a certain degree, but, you know, I mean, look, he admitted on this broadcast that it was people that he disagrees with today on some issues that woke him up to begin with.
[00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:32.532]  So, you know, I've woken up a lot of people who then go research 9-11 and believe the government did it, but just don't believe some of the things I believe.
[00:36:32.572 --> 00:36:33.793]  Well, that's fine, it's a free country.
[00:36:34.655 --> 00:36:48.424]  There shouldn't be an orthodoxy to any of this, but no, I think his Strawman article overall is helpful explaining how popular mechanics and others, this is a tactic that they do over and over again.
[00:36:49.225 --> 00:37:03.114]  Well, you've said over and over that you concentrate on the concrete evidence that you can prove, and I agree 100% with that, but it seems like some of the responses, there is evidence out there that maybe you and I cannot prove conclusively, but that
[00:37:03.835 --> 00:37:09.338]  It paints a larger, broader picture, and it seems like this article just dismisses a lot of that.
[00:37:09.758 --> 00:37:15.361]  And that to me... Yeah, you're talking about the response to the hit piece you say in a way is a hit piece.
[00:37:15.942 --> 00:37:16.182]  Yes.
[00:37:17.122 --> 00:37:18.083]  In some ways it is.
[00:37:18.943 --> 00:37:30.810]  In some ways it is, just like an article that came out a few months ago in the New American, written by Brandt, that criticized people that believed if a plane didn't hit the Pentagon, then they were somehow conspiracy wackos.
[00:37:31.357 --> 00:37:32.038]  No, I hear you.
[00:37:32.078 --> 00:37:33.118]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:35.500]  Let me try to comment on the subject you brought up.
[00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:53.273]  Number one, I really think the New American is ignorant to a certain extent because I saw William F. Jasper in 1999 in Urban Warrior in Northern California or Central California and in Oakland.
[00:37:53.766 --> 00:38:03.528]  And I'm there with German troops and Dutch troops and black helicopters and tanks and drills and role players screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in the camp.
[00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:11.749]  And I turn, and I'm with dozens of members of the press, Japanese, German, American TV, and I turn and there's William F. Jasper.
[00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.050]  And I go, Jasper!
[00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.811]  And he goes, hey, Alex Jones!
[00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:20.611]  I didn't know he knew who I was.
[00:38:21.263 --> 00:38:23.205]  And I'm like, I'm always trying to get you on the radio!
[00:38:23.485 --> 00:38:27.968]  I can never get any of those guys, and nobody else can, on their radio shows.
[00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:31.171]  Any of the John Birch Society-type people, who I think do a lot of good work.
[00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:39.157]  And I turn to him and I say, uh, you wrote an article a few months ago saying black helicopters basically don't exist.
[00:38:39.837 --> 00:38:40.658]  And I said, guess what?
[00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:46.322]  I've been doing my radio show or call-ins from here on the ground on a cell phone, and I've been printing articles off
[00:38:47.176 --> 00:38:48.956]  The computer at the hotel at like 5 a.m.
[00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:49.377]  in the morning.
[00:38:49.897 --> 00:38:53.077]  Here's an Associated Press article I happen to have in my folder.
[00:38:53.658 --> 00:38:59.379]  I just printed yesterday about black helicopters while I've been in this town, in California, hitting Texas again.
[00:38:59.419 --> 00:39:05.260]  I go, here, here's the Associated Press, and here is a San Antonio Express News article.
[00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:07.441]  And I said, here it is.
[00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:13.022]  Guess what I saw a month later in the New America?
[00:39:13.562 --> 00:39:15.503]  The exact AP article reprint.
[00:39:17.123 --> 00:39:20.345]  So, I think they're like in a bubble or something?
[00:39:21.146 --> 00:39:26.689]  Because if I'd have given that to him and I wouldn't have seen it in the magazine, I'd have thought, man, those are agents, you know.
[00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:35.255]  They're saying black helicopters don't exist, you know, these special ops, you know, that's kind of an acronym or a blanket thing for covert military operations.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.740]  Black helicopters.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.783]  That's because the FEMA and the Delta Force and a lot of other secret groups, this is what they use.
[00:39:43.023 --> 00:39:46.725]  It's got a radar absorbent paint job.
[00:39:46.785 --> 00:39:47.525]  I mean, that's all it is.
[00:39:48.826 --> 00:39:49.947]  They can be gray, too.
[00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:50.727]  They can be green, too.
[00:39:50.747 --> 00:39:51.688]  But they're predominantly black.
[00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:54.069]  Because they do night operations.
[00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:54.949]  You know, we own the night.
[00:39:54.989 --> 00:39:55.670]  The Night Stalkers.
[00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:56.570]  Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
[00:39:58.351 --> 00:39:59.472]  So I don't think they're bad.
[00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:02.833]  I mean, I saw them say that Gulf War illness didn't exist.
[00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:03.994]  Well, now the government admits it.
[00:40:04.014 --> 00:40:04.934]  All the scientists admit it.
[00:40:04.954 --> 00:40:05.935]  And they admit it.
[00:40:07.508 --> 00:40:12.771]  So, I really don't think they're fighting the FTAAA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[00:40:13.352 --> 00:40:13.912]  Great job!
[00:40:14.732 --> 00:40:15.473]  I don't think they're bad.
[00:40:15.493 --> 00:40:16.813]  We don't have to all agree with each other.
[00:40:20.716 --> 00:40:26.019]  We have to just try to be alternative news and media and be diverse in our ideas.
[00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:27.799]  May the best man win.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.540]  May the best person reach the most people.
[00:40:31.522 --> 00:40:33.283]  Hopefully people will get more discerning.
[00:40:33.363 --> 00:40:35.884]  I mean, that's really it.
[00:40:36.912 --> 00:40:38.273]  And I don't think Hoffman's bad.
[00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:44.897]  I mean, uh, my biggest beef with Patriots and Truth Seekers is this.
[00:40:46.918 --> 00:40:54.423]  People trust alternative media a lot more in major studies, and plus just from my experience, than they trust mainstream news.
[00:40:55.343 --> 00:40:56.604]  And I don't think that's healthy.
[00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:58.265]  I really don't.
[00:40:58.305 --> 00:41:00.206]  Number one, you got a lot of infiltrators in it.
[00:41:00.226 --> 00:41:01.947]  You got a lot of disinfo people.
[00:41:01.967 --> 00:41:02.788]  You got a lot of kooks.
[00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:13.654]  And just because the mainstream media twists and manipulates and spins and outright fabricates sometimes, more often than not, they just don't report on stuff.
[00:41:14.874 --> 00:41:23.678]  Or they put it in the back of the paper, or they, you know, put the real important information, paragraph 20, on page A-19, or B-19.
[00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:31.961]  But, what really hurts us as a movement of truth-seekers is the media can go out and point out all the kooks.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.181]  And they give them the attention.
[00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:37.022]  But a bigger problem is we give them the attention.
[00:41:37.682 --> 00:41:44.706]  You know, just because the media manipulates, doesn't mean all the alternative media, you should just trust them.
[00:41:46.407 --> 00:41:54.671]  I mean, the magic machines that are going to heal you, the magic creams that are going to heal you, take this pill, you're going to be 20 years younger.
[00:41:54.691 --> 00:41:57.033]  I mean, I could make a million bucks doing that.
[00:41:57.233 --> 00:41:59.314]  I will not, I shall not,
[00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:07.594]  I know a lot of people wish they could take this show and turn it into a giant whorehouse of snake oil.
[00:42:10.034 --> 00:42:18.097]  They look at this program greedily and hate the fact that I'm talking about other networks, other people, and want to do that over my dead body.
[00:42:18.297 --> 00:42:21.678]  If it ever got to that point, I just won't do radio, folks.
[00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:24.960]  I will not compromise my morals.
[00:42:26.972 --> 00:42:27.953]  You listen to what I promote.
[00:42:27.993 --> 00:42:28.834]  It's documentaries.
[00:42:28.894 --> 00:42:29.414]  It's books.
[00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:30.955]  It's water filters.
[00:42:31.356 --> 00:42:32.596]  It's just plain Jane.
[00:42:32.997 --> 00:42:33.737]  Real stuff.
[00:42:34.078 --> 00:42:35.219]  Hey, this is good for you.
[00:42:35.259 --> 00:42:36.500]  Hey, this is good information.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.921]  Hey, this is backed up.
[00:42:39.262 --> 00:42:40.663]  And the same thing goes for info.
[00:42:41.043 --> 00:42:42.364]  Don't believe what I say.
[00:42:42.404 --> 00:42:44.646]  Don't believe what I tell you.
[00:42:44.686 --> 00:42:45.186]  Please don't.
[00:42:45.407 --> 00:42:46.447]  Don't believe what anybody tells you.
[00:42:46.948 --> 00:42:49.069]  Unless it's your wife and you've known her for ten years.
[00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.110]  Or your husband.
[00:42:51.812 --> 00:42:52.352]  It's that simple.
[00:42:53.234 --> 00:42:54.695]  I certainly don't trust government.
[00:42:54.735 --> 00:42:57.898]  I mean, this mindless trust of government is just idiotic.
[00:42:58.258 --> 00:43:01.381]  It goes against common sense, history, the Founding Fathers' warnings.
[00:43:02.102 --> 00:43:07.686]  But the government may do 99 things wrong in a day, but in the hundredth, they've still got good intentions.
[00:43:08.227 --> 00:43:09.027]  Boulderdash.
[00:43:11.049 --> 00:43:11.950]  That's cockamamie.
[00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:15.753]  It's, uh, it's bunk.
[00:43:17.254 --> 00:43:17.835]  It's nuts.
[00:43:18.235 --> 00:43:21.158]  Whatever cliché term you want to use.
[00:43:23.658 --> 00:43:24.399]  Heaven help us!
[00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:40.812]  And I gotta tell you, it really is going nowhere to say it's the evil white people that run the New World Order, it's the Jews, it's the Catholics, it's the Protestants, it's the Muslims, it's the... it's evil people.
[00:43:40.912 --> 00:43:53.162]  And folks, evil people crawl to the tops of these dung heaps that we call governments because they're cunning, they're intelligent, they're ruthless, they're manipulative, because bigger groups control them and have picked them because they're compromised,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:02.247]  And the Muslims are run by scum, the Jews are run by scum, the Catholics are run by scum, the Protestants are run by scum.
[00:44:03.228 --> 00:44:08.172]  Scum, scum, scum, scum, scum, scum, scum, scum!
[00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:11.394]  I mean, what does the Bible tell you?
[00:44:12.996 --> 00:44:19.221]  The devil holds the leaders of the world like pennies in his hand, to paraphrase.
[00:44:20.002 --> 00:44:21.663]  Like so much change in the pocket.
[00:44:25.206 --> 00:44:28.970]  And that's just the nature of the world.
[00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.952]  People knew this just 50 years ago.
[00:44:30.972 --> 00:44:34.215]  Now it's, I TRUST THE GOVERNMENT!
[00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:36.397]  What is your major malfunction?
[00:44:37.378 --> 00:44:39.601]  Because it's easy, see, it's easy just to believe.
[00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:43.044]  Oh, that just can't be true.
[00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:44.946]  No, I just don't want to believe that.
[00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.351]  It's time for childhoods in.
[00:44:48.371 --> 00:44:54.114]  A lot of adults are in these childlike, you know, I see yuppies, I people watch.
[00:44:54.194 --> 00:44:56.115]  I don't really watch a lot of TV, I people watch.
[00:44:56.455 --> 00:45:05.460]  When I'm in a restaurant, or when I'm at a Republican National Convention, or once a year when I go to a baseball game or something, I people watch.
[00:45:07.685 --> 00:45:08.225]  You watch them.
[00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:10.306]  They're totally obsessed with how they look.
[00:45:10.326 --> 00:45:12.726]  They're totally obsessed with people looking at them.
[00:45:13.206 --> 00:45:16.167]  You can see them playing parts.
[00:45:16.287 --> 00:45:18.127]  You know, acting like they're reading newspapers.
[00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:20.468]  These so-called intellectuals.
[00:45:20.588 --> 00:45:21.988]  You'll see them even acting like they're reading a newspaper.
[00:45:22.008 --> 00:45:22.608]  They're not even reading it.
[00:45:22.628 --> 00:45:24.109]  They're just acting official.
[00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:28.070]  Because I know how that is because I remember when I was 3, 4, 5 years old,
[00:45:31.073 --> 00:45:34.697]  I remember seeing the world as if it's all me.
[00:45:35.137 --> 00:45:37.459]  Everything else in the world is just what I see.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.722]  The world revolves around me.
[00:45:39.742 --> 00:45:40.763]  This is ego.
[00:45:40.783 --> 00:45:43.085]  This is profound, too.
[00:45:43.105 --> 00:45:45.047]  It's all self-centered.
[00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.913]  I was conscious of this when I was about three years old.
[00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:55.754]  By the time I was five or six, I really stopped looking at the world this way to a certain extent.
[00:45:55.954 --> 00:45:57.875]  You see, most teenagers are totally unhappy.
[00:45:57.895 --> 00:45:58.955]  They're totally insecure.
[00:45:59.515 --> 00:46:01.215]  They're totally worried about how they look.
[00:46:01.255 --> 00:46:02.756]  They're embarrassed in public.
[00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:04.476]  They feel weird.
[00:46:06.517 --> 00:46:07.637]  And, you know, it's the balance.
[00:46:07.837 --> 00:46:10.718]  The problem is, you can get like me, where you just totally don't even care.
[00:46:15.307 --> 00:46:17.169]  You know, you stop caring how your hair looks.
[00:46:17.369 --> 00:46:18.950]  I mean, you stop caring how you're dressing.
[00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:22.653]  The extreme of that can become a problem.
[00:46:23.754 --> 00:46:25.976]  Because I'm so outwardly focused.
[00:46:26.036 --> 00:46:32.341]  Just totally, totally outwardly focused and I just go into my mind to analyze information and look at things.
[00:46:35.737 --> 00:46:39.379]  But literally, most of these Republicans and Democrats, it's all about identity.
[00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:40.120]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:40.920]  I'm a Republican.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.381]  I'm a member of the Country Club.
[00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:43.341]  I'm a hippie.
[00:46:43.361 --> 00:46:47.244]  You know, I go to the hippie meetings and talk about how great the Democrats are and how evil Bush is.
[00:46:47.464 --> 00:46:48.904]  And they don't want to give up that identity.
[00:46:48.924 --> 00:46:55.028]  They've been playing a part, they've been playing a role, so long they're not real people.
[00:46:56.629 --> 00:46:59.090]  They're playing a simulated existence.
[00:47:00.871 --> 00:47:02.192]  It's a virtual reality.
[00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.691]  And a lot of people don't want to hear real talk radio.
[00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:12.174]  They want to hear hardcore patriot information, real truth-seeking info.
[00:47:12.514 --> 00:47:13.654]  They like the kooky.
[00:47:13.674 --> 00:47:14.575]  They like the weird.
[00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:21.158]  They like the cataclysmic, the Planet X is going to kill us tomorrow.
[00:47:21.858 --> 00:47:23.619]  Because that's otherworldly.
[00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:25.920]  And their subconscious, they know it's not true.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:28.942]  And it creates kind of a disconnect.
[00:47:29.482 --> 00:47:31.023]  It's like the rapture cults.
[00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:36.078]  I might not even think you're going to have a rapture.
[00:47:36.098 --> 00:47:39.359]  The point is, I don't have to worry because I'll be punched out of here.
[00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:42.320]  I'll be ejection-seated out of here.
[00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:47.062]  It's just all a cop-out, folks.
[00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:49.783]  It's nothing more than a gigantic cop-out.
[00:47:50.604 --> 00:47:51.584]  And that's all people do.
[00:47:51.624 --> 00:48:00.267]  I mean, yeah, I've had so many good old boys, when I finally proved 9-11 is an inside job, they just go, well, Alex, you know, sometimes they've got to do that to keep control.
[00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:02.848]  I mean, it's for America's future.
[00:48:02.868 --> 00:48:04.069]  You've got to break a few eggs.
[00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:18.386]  And I know people in business, people who are multi-millionaires, who are afraid and upset when you're talking to them, and finally when you sell them, because they know it's true, they've already heard all the info, seen it for themselves, they just go, well Alex, I mean that's just how we do things.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.932]  That's just, that's just how we do things.
[00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:28.875]  I'll never forget a story my friend Kevin Booth told me.
[00:48:30.356 --> 00:48:33.779]  He was with his dad at the Grand Canyon.
[00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:40.439]  And there was a drunk Native American outside the Grand Canyon by one of their little reservations.
[00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:50.287]  And his father just looked over to him and said, Son, that's why we were able to take their land and see how they are.
[00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:56.612]  See, it's just kind of like a, just an attitude, just a, you know, like, we're a part of it.
[00:48:58.133 --> 00:49:03.458]  As if, as if, and I mean, I know Mr. Booth, he's a nice guy.
[00:49:04.098 --> 00:49:05.019]  And he's not racist.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.281]  He would say that about any group.
[00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:16.646]  It's just feeling like, because he was a corporate executive, it's feeling like you are part of the power structure.
[00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:17.727]  You are part of the system.
[00:49:18.027 --> 00:49:20.108]  A system that will squash you like a bug.
[00:49:20.668 --> 00:49:22.109]  I mean, you want to play along with it.
[00:49:22.169 --> 00:49:31.234]  I mean, I've got video from the convention panning across the faces of the crowds, and it's the same look, this smile, this feeling like you're part of something big.
[00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:34.642]  You want to feel like you're part of something big?
[00:49:34.942 --> 00:49:36.042]  That's your family.
[00:49:36.882 --> 00:49:38.263]  That's your local community.
[00:49:38.423 --> 00:49:40.164]  That's what you do for society.
[00:49:40.184 --> 00:49:41.364]  That's what you leave behind.
[00:49:41.744 --> 00:49:48.926]  That isn't going and being part of a sporting event as a spectator or sitting there and hearing somebody read off a teleprompter and feeling like you're part of that system.
[00:49:52.127 --> 00:49:53.268]  I mean, this is so important.
[00:49:56.449 --> 00:49:57.309]  It's so important.
[00:50:00.006 --> 00:50:06.009]  Alright, I want to go to KC and Craig and Jason and others.
[00:50:06.049 --> 00:50:07.270]  We do have a big guest coming up.
[00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:19.116]  You know, just because we put out alternative news, other people do, just because somebody's putting out an alternative story doesn't mean they're right.
[00:50:19.196 --> 00:50:21.177]  I mean, that's something I need to tell you.
[00:50:22.778 --> 00:50:27.501]  And a lot of people get into this Patriot movement because they want to be hot shots, they want to be leaders.
[00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:31.114]  I'll never... People love to speak in front of crowds.
[00:50:31.674 --> 00:50:36.376]  Because, primitively, talking to a crowd of 500 to 1,000 people... Man, you're the tribal leader.
[00:50:37.056 --> 00:50:38.156]  I mean, this feels good.
[00:50:40.357 --> 00:50:43.658]  But, they don't... But, but, but, but... They'll fall asleep doing a radio interview.
[00:50:44.459 --> 00:50:45.599]  See, they're not conscious.
[00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:48.380]  I realize during the radio, I'm talking to millions.
[00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:51.981]  And I almost fall asleep giving a speech to a crowd.
[00:50:53.242 --> 00:50:53.762]  You see, people...
[00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:56.794]  It's all about their own view.
[00:50:57.074 --> 00:50:58.815]  Oh, I see a crowd, so this is big.
[00:50:59.195 --> 00:50:59.796]  We'll be back.
[00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:08.260]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.941]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.141 --> 00:51:12.362]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.482 --> 00:51:14.584]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:19.807]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.127 --> 00:51:24.169]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.409 --> 00:51:26.171]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:36.903]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.063 --> 00:51:38.946]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.326 --> 00:51:42.988]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[00:51:43.108 --> 00:51:44.669]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.689 --> 00:51:45.089]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:47.510]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.571]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.842 --> 00:52:06.064]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.204 --> 00:52:14.307]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:21.609]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:21.809 --> 00:52:23.070]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:29.055]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.235 --> 00:52:34.339]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.439 --> 00:52:43.327]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.587 --> 00:52:46.889]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:05.834 --> 00:54:07.435]  The globalists are ruthless.
[00:54:07.475 --> 00:54:11.076]  They don't have the inhibitions that normal people have, the conscience.
[00:54:12.417 --> 00:54:13.718]  And they see that as a strength.
[00:54:15.138 --> 00:54:24.162]  They see us as weak, because we love, because we cry, because we have dreams, and we love beauty and creativity.
[00:54:24.943 --> 00:54:27.684]  They see themselves as survival of the fittest, social Darwinists.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.461]  They think they're strong, but they're strong like a cancer is in the body.
[00:54:33.922 --> 00:54:40.724]  They're aberrant, they're destructive, they're anti-matter, in the scheme of the fabric of life.
[00:54:42.344 --> 00:54:43.865]  And they are destined to fail.
[00:54:43.925 --> 00:54:45.886]  There were two globalists left in a room together.
[00:54:47.046 --> 00:54:49.767]  They'd killed everyone on the earth, they would then kill each other.
[00:54:51.848 --> 00:54:52.448]  That's the truth.
[00:54:52.928 --> 00:54:55.929]  They will fail, they will be defeated, they will implode.
[00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:59.633]  The question was, will they drag the rest of us down with them?
[00:55:02.255 --> 00:55:05.938]  Alright, you know, I must start going back to your calls here.
[00:55:05.978 --> 00:55:07.479]  I've just got to say this briefly.
[00:55:07.499 --> 00:55:11.703]  This is how we fund our operations and it's also really good videos.

[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.701]  That a worldwide death cult runs the planet and carried out 9-11.
[00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.721]  They prove it conclusively.
[00:55:59.741 --> 00:56:02.042]  They really expose them.
[00:56:02.691 --> 00:56:07.134]  And you need to see the video.
[00:56:07.695 --> 00:56:09.156]  So PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:09.956 --> 00:56:14.179]  Let's go ahead and, you'll be able to order hard copies of it in a few days as well.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:21.125]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess KC in Minnesota is on the air.
[00:56:21.185 --> 00:56:21.905]  Go ahead KC.
[00:56:22.706 --> 00:56:23.186]  Hi Alex.
[00:56:24.127 --> 00:56:24.507]  How you doing?
[00:56:25.127 --> 00:56:25.848]  Good, pretty good.
[00:56:26.388 --> 00:56:28.850]  Just had kind of a two part question for you.
[00:56:30.902 --> 00:56:39.406]  For one, I kind of wanted to know what your initial inspiration was which got you involved in the world.
[00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:44.668]  Well, really, I just read a lot of history books and knew how corrupt governments were.
[00:56:44.769 --> 00:56:51.392]  And then I heard my professors telling me government is all knowing and loving and good and give your rights up.
[00:56:51.972 --> 00:56:56.994]  I'd watch C-SPAN and see one thing happen, watch Fox News or CNN, see something else.
[00:56:58.235 --> 00:57:00.436]  I woke up before even Fox TV was on in Austin.
[00:57:01.506 --> 00:57:03.967]  Um, I mean, that's basically it.
[00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:05.208]  I mean, it's a fraud.
[00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:10.771]  Any person in particular that gave you the motivation to step out?
[00:57:11.051 --> 00:57:15.254]  Well, I read Gary Allen's An Uncalled Conspiracy written in 72.
[00:57:16.314 --> 00:57:20.216]  And I read that probably in about 1993.
[00:57:21.797 --> 00:57:23.698]  You know, so at the time, 20 years old.
[00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.860]  And it was all true.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.161]  I mean, everything he said would happen had happened.
[00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:34.760]  Does that answer your question?
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.200]  Oh, most definitely.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:42.282]  And the second part of my question, I know that you have friends in the mainstream.
[00:57:42.962 --> 00:57:53.726]  And, you know, I think I can speak unanimously from your viewers that we would like to see you go mainstream and step it up a notch.
[00:57:54.327 --> 00:58:00.889]  And I don't mean to sound cocky when I say that, but I really think that that'd be great.
[00:58:02.017 --> 00:58:05.059]  Well, we're on dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations.
[00:58:05.079 --> 00:58:08.280]  I think we've gotten, like, seven new affiliates in the last month.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.861]  I mean, that's a fast growth rate for us.
[00:58:11.682 --> 00:58:16.584]  And, uh, normally we'd gain four or five stations and lose two or three, so we'd slowly grow.
[00:58:16.624 --> 00:58:19.606]  Now it's, we lose one station for every ten we gain.
[00:58:19.626 --> 00:58:21.947]  You know, changing formats or whatever.
[00:58:21.967 --> 00:58:24.988]  Uh, so, I mean, mainstream.
[00:58:25.048 --> 00:58:25.909]  What is mainstream?
[00:58:25.949 --> 00:58:28.630]  We're going to talk about that paradigm shift coming up.
[00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:30.611]  But, uh,
[00:58:31.534 --> 00:58:32.594]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:58:34.014 --> 00:58:34.495]  God bless you.
[00:58:34.535 --> 00:58:37.995]  I mean, I'm in one Hollywood movie, talking about the New World Order.
[00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.896]  I'm in another big one that's gonna be coming out.
[00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:41.636]  I don't even really talk about that stuff.
[00:58:41.656 --> 00:58:42.596]  I don't try to be in movies.
[00:58:42.616 --> 00:58:45.377]  I mean, the phone rings, it's gonna be in a movie, I go do it.
[00:58:46.097 --> 00:58:48.037]  You know, if it's talking about the New World Order, I do.
[00:58:48.417 --> 00:58:48.997]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.338 --> 00:58:51.838]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:58.159]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.889 --> 00:58:59.930]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:01.751]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:03.252]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.992 --> 00:59:04.873]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.893 --> 00:59:09.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.736 --> 00:59:13.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.801]  Have you ever seen that movie, They Live?
[00:59:18.762 --> 00:59:23.025]  Where you put the sunglasses on and you see the real world around you?
[00:59:24.898 --> 00:59:26.500]  A caller asked how I woke up.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:36.829]  I mean, just studying history a little bit because I found it interesting and looking at what the media was reporting and doing and how human societies structure themselves.
[00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.754]  It's like putting on a pair of sunglasses and you then see the real world.
[00:59:42.915 --> 00:59:45.617]  It's just right underneath the surface.
[00:59:45.937 --> 00:59:46.958]  Let's take some more calls.
[00:59:46.978 --> 00:59:50.622]  I've got an expert on nanotechnology coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:52.032 --> 00:59:53.513]  Let's go ahead and talk to Craig.
[00:59:53.533 --> 00:59:55.154]  Craig, where are you following us from today?
[00:59:55.895 --> 00:59:56.675]  Wisconsin, Alex.
[00:59:57.055 --> 00:59:57.395]  Welcome.
[00:59:57.415 --> 00:59:58.376]  How are you doing today?
[00:59:58.576 --> 00:59:58.796]  Good.
[00:59:59.136 --> 00:59:59.357]  Great.
[00:59:59.917 --> 01:00:03.199]  I cut off four of your movies back in December and I've been making copies up here.
[01:00:03.219 --> 01:00:05.500]  It seems Wisconsin is pretty locked down, you know?
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.562]  A lot of people walking with their heads down.
[01:00:07.682 --> 01:00:08.302]  It is, yeah.
[01:00:08.322 --> 01:00:13.305]  Wisconsin is in Milwaukee and... Because you don't have a radio station up here.
[01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:14.346]  I have to listen to you online.
[01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:17.648]  But I'm just, you know, making copies.
[01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:21.890]  I give them to some people and they give them back and say I didn't have time to watch it.
[01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:25.392]  And I go, okay, I'd rather get it back and give it to somebody that might watch it.
[01:00:25.472 --> 01:00:28.073]  Well, I bet they had time to watch the sitcoms.
[01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:28.813]  Oh yeah, I know.
[01:00:28.873 --> 01:00:32.295]  It's like they have an idea, but they just don't want to know.
[01:00:32.575 --> 01:00:37.357]  They have an idea something's wrong, but they're like, ah... Because they think the world is contained in between their ears.
[01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:41.919]  They think what they think and what they do is reality, and that's a fraud, folks.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.941]  It's pretty scary, just the apathy.
[01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:46.361]  It's just...
[01:00:47.017 --> 01:00:47.477]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:48.237 --> 01:00:49.538]  I'm a member of Prison Planet TV.
[01:00:49.578 --> 01:00:51.458]  I'm really looking forward to your new epic also.
[01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:55.479]  I've been waiting since the beginning of February, so I can't wait.
[01:00:56.339 --> 01:01:00.460]  And I was just going to say, I was trying to find your NPR piece, and I don't know if they ever played it or not.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:00.840]  Do you know?
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.121]  Yeah, they played it all over the country, and I think Paul Watson put a link to it.
[01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:06.301]  Okay, I have to check it out.
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:10.422]  If you want to hear it, just go to the NPR website, go to On The Media, and it was last weekend's show.
[01:01:10.442 --> 01:01:11.262]  Okay, great.
[01:01:12.243 --> 01:01:13.663]  I just have one more question for you.
[01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:21.797]  I read about Mr. Skolnik in an article on Rents about, I don't know, Thompson might have been working on an underground pedophile book or something.
[01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:22.317]  There's that.
[01:01:22.538 --> 01:01:23.898]  I mean, I don't know if you checked into that.
[01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:30.240]  I don't know how real that is.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.062]  Yeah, Thompson's name had come up concerning exposing stuff or more than that.
[01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.875]  His name had come up in conjunction with Bohemian Grove before.
[01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:44.295]  I know, I've read that too.
[01:01:44.355 --> 01:01:50.517]  I don't know how true it is, but it seems that he might have been inside and had some real information that could have come out, you know?
[01:01:51.358 --> 01:01:51.578]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:53.158]  And he didn't get a chance to.
[01:01:53.238 --> 01:01:59.360]  And then his wife, of course, said that he was very depressed, and they were talking about when he died, you know, what to do with his money and all that.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:03.462]  You know, that sounds pretty fixed, and like she's probably scared to death.
[01:02:03.522 --> 01:02:04.262]  Who knows what, you know?
[01:02:05.325 --> 01:02:07.405]  What could really happen to her and the kids?
[01:02:07.846 --> 01:02:10.886]  Well, again, for those who don't know, it was in the Toronto Globe and Mail.
[01:02:10.906 --> 01:02:15.267]  One of his friends talked to him the night before and he said, I'm working on a 9-11 story.
[01:02:15.907 --> 01:02:18.028]  I think they're going to make it look like a suicide, he said.
[01:02:18.048 --> 01:02:21.168]  I know how these bleepers work.
[01:02:21.668 --> 01:02:29.330]  All I can say is Alex, you're doing a great job and I really respect and I'm inspired by your integrity and your love.
[01:02:30.327 --> 01:02:31.468]  And common sense, actually.
[01:02:31.488 --> 01:02:32.709]  It's pretty much common sense.
[01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:34.430]  So, keep up the good work and I'll be listening.
[01:03:00.734 --> 01:03:02.175]  There's people out here praying for you.
[01:03:04.175 --> 01:03:06.196]  I haven't worked in a couple of months.
[01:03:06.236 --> 01:03:17.660]  I'm calling to actually ask if you can put me in touch with someone like your last caller who could record some of your videos so that you can get another fire started out here on the eastern shore of Maryland.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.781]  Well, I can make the films.
[01:03:20.861 --> 01:03:23.222]  I can tell people they can make copies of them, but I can't.
[01:03:23.902 --> 01:03:25.123]  I'm getting a lot of calls.
[01:03:25.163 --> 01:03:27.864]  Can you get me in touch with somebody who will give me your videos free?
[01:03:28.364 --> 01:03:29.024]  I can't do that.
[01:03:29.887 --> 01:03:32.369]  I mean, I can't, like, start doing a message service on air.
[01:03:32.449 --> 01:03:33.971]  It would become too confusing.
[01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:35.132]  Well, I thank you anyway.
[01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:40.516]  And there's a lot of people, uh, you know, out in Maryland, uh, who've got the videos.
[01:03:40.597 --> 01:03:45.181]  I mean, find somebody who's got them, and, uh, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:47.122]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:48.263 --> 01:03:50.165]  As much as I can do is say you can make copies.
[01:03:50.225 --> 01:03:50.826]  I can't do any more.
[01:03:53.888 --> 01:03:56.711]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:58.760]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:04.708]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:10.235]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:12.138]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:04:12.278 --> 01:04:14.699]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:14.839 --> 01:04:18.640]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.521]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.621 --> 01:04:26.382]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:26.682 --> 01:04:29.862]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:04:29.902 --> 01:04:31.723]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:34.305]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:52.021]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.078 --> 01:04:54.680]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.943]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:01.946]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.026 --> 01:05:08.752]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.932 --> 01:05:11.935]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.135 --> 01:05:14.537]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.658 --> 01:05:19.382]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:34.132]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:05:34.272 --> 01:05:40.336]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.356 --> 01:05:40.616]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:41.096]  Or order on the web
[01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:55.083]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.323 --> 01:05:59.164]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:59.504 --> 01:06:00.304]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:04.845]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.085 --> 01:06:09.286]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.646 --> 01:06:14.527]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.907 --> 01:06:18.468]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.668 --> 01:06:24.010]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.030]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:27.311 --> 01:06:28.211]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:42.475 --> 01:06:42.795]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.926 --> 01:06:59.986]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.686 --> 01:07:01.827]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.447 --> 01:07:03.307]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.027 --> 01:07:05.007]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.427 --> 01:07:09.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.768 --> 01:07:16.269]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:28.031]  Alright, 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this second hour of global transmission against the worldwide tyranny.
[01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:37.649]  We're going to go to our guest here in just a minute or two, Douglas Mulhall, and he, again, has a bio about a thousand feet long.
[01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:51.054]  Douglas Mulhall is a leading nanotechnology journalist and one-time award-winning documentary filmmaker and broadcast executive who has appeared often on national syndicated talk shows, CNN, the New York Times, BBC Newsweek and PBS.
[01:07:51.454 --> 01:07:52.254]  I've interviewed him.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.861]  I heard him on Coast to Coast the other night with George Norrie.
[01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:58.222]  Just amazing information.
[01:07:58.262 --> 01:07:59.823]  It meshes with all of my research.
[01:08:00.363 --> 01:08:05.286]  And he's got some really powerful books and some websites we'll be telling you about as well.
[01:08:05.306 --> 01:08:07.106]  He'll be with us until the middle of the next hour.
[01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:09.748]  He'll have plenty of time to take your calls as well.
[01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:21.473]  Then in the last half hour, next hour, I'll get more into the Globe and Mail article about Hunter S. Thompson telling reporters, telling friends, they're about to kill me over a 9-11 story I'm about to break and a staged suicide.
[01:08:22.327 --> 01:08:23.567]  It's like Princess Diana.
[01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:26.328]  They have the letters saying they're going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:27.629]  Charles told me so.
[01:08:28.089 --> 01:08:31.850]  And she dies in that very way and we go, oh, it was an accident.
[01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:34.351]  Unbelievable.
[01:08:34.491 --> 01:08:35.892]  So, more on that coming up.
[01:08:36.963 --> 01:08:39.305]  Good news, more states throwing out the Patriot Act.
[01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.967]  But nanotechnology, why is it so important?
[01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:50.554]  I mean, just all of the third and fourth wave kind of merging, the biotech revolution merging with the information technology systems.
[01:08:51.315 --> 01:08:56.919]  All of these technologies that have been developed over the last 20 years kind of coming into their own and then integrating.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:04.105]  We have a lot of futurists and scientists and university heads on here, but the reason this is so important is
[01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:13.705]  My friends, the elite want world government, world tyranny, because they're threatened by losing their monopoly of high technology.
[01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:18.370]  And the elite wants the life-extension technologies for themselves.
[01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:19.211]  They've said this.
[01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.673]  They do not want the six and a half billion.
[01:09:21.693 --> 01:09:28.440]  And by the time it's technologically mass-available, ten billion people
[01:09:29.341 --> 01:09:36.646]  They don't want you having access to it, and so for you to not have access to it, they don't want you to even know about its existence.
[01:09:37.566 --> 01:09:51.616]  And so they're kind of creating these higher-level technological spires, or technological Mount Olympuses, that they build behind a iron curtain of national security.
[01:09:52.676 --> 01:09:57.880]  And they say, we've got to have world government in their own policy papers, because we cannot allow
[01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:04.591]  Foreign countries, rogue nations, to get these technologies or they could destroy the planet, which is true!
[01:10:05.872 --> 01:10:12.036]  The Air Force admits they've developed anti-matter bombs, San Francisco Chronicle, no one seems to report on it, but it's been in a few stories.
[01:10:13.077 --> 01:10:25.026]  They've got all sorts of new particle beams, they've got super, you know, 10th generation bio-weapons already, stuff that, you know, has 100% kill rates, and it's true!
[01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:26.728]  Foreign countries could develop this!
[01:10:27.758 --> 01:10:33.781]  But instead of making treaties and doing real deals and having them agree to inspections independently, oh no!
[01:10:34.261 --> 01:10:44.986]  You look at the globalists, the people saying, give us world government to stop all this, they're the very ones giving nuclear reactors in North Korea and allowing Khan Laboratories in Pakistan to develop them.
[01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:50.329]  The globalists are actually going to release all of this to bring in their total world tyranny.
[01:10:51.292 --> 01:11:04.555]  And it's so they get control of all the life-exigent technologies and so they control the revolutions in new energies and new technologies that will totally shatter their monopolies of control.
[01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:07.275]  And so that's why you've got this race to tyranny.
[01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:14.757]  And so they're able to sell the intellectuals, the intelligentsia on this tyranny at a
[01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:22.864]  High level in the pyramidal structure, not at the highest level, but the very upper rungs, a lot of well-meaning people.
[01:11:22.884 --> 01:11:27.126]  You know, folks with 180 IQs, they say, well, we can't have other countries having this, can we?
[01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:28.206]  It's too destructive.
[01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:30.907]  Well, we know you've got the mind to be part of this.
[01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:32.467]  Join us, be part of it.
[01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:34.968]  It'll go along with world government to save humanity.
[01:11:35.168 --> 01:11:37.169]  We can't let this stuff get out of control or it's all over.
[01:11:39.372 --> 01:11:58.226]  But then the globalists actually are a bunch of inbred trash who enjoy control, who enjoy domination, who are sadistic, who are social Darwinists, who are actually proliferating this and putting the ingredients for mousepox out on the internet so they can bring in the crisis to then bring in a total tyranny.
[01:11:59.227 --> 01:12:00.788]  So, that's the bottom line, folks.
[01:12:00.808 --> 01:12:03.190]  They're going to have a worldwide monopoly on this stuff.
[01:12:03.789 --> 01:12:12.171]  To where we don't get access to these incredible healthcare developments, to the clean-burning energy sciences, to all of it.
[01:12:12.191 --> 01:12:18.292]  All right, without further ado, that ranting, babbling, run-on sentence has now come to an end.
[01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:22.652]  Douglas Moll, Paul, thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[01:12:23.092 --> 01:12:24.593]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:12:25.793 --> 01:12:28.773]  You're in nanoland, by the way, there in Austin.
[01:12:29.434 --> 01:12:31.554]  Texas is a big nanotechnology area.
[01:12:32.617 --> 01:12:37.642]  Well, yeah, they had the secret IBM laboratory announce its new super chip a few weeks ago.
[01:12:37.662 --> 01:12:40.224]  There's a lot of secret labs in Austin.
[01:12:40.744 --> 01:12:44.668]  Yeah, there's a lot of not-so-secret ones as well, because most of the university is there.
[01:12:44.688 --> 01:12:52.275]  And, you know, it's a good place to start, because you mentioned about this struggle over preventing this stuff from breaking out.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:08.936]  I think one of the things that we can start by talking about is the fundamental difference between nanotechnology as a technology, what its character is, and the big centralized technologies that we really have had up until now.
[01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:14.242]  Well, before we go any further, tell us a little bit about yourself, your websites, your books.
[01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:17.757]  Well, basically, we have got two books out.
[01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:23.523]  The first one is called Our Molecular Future, and the second one is called The Calcium Bomb.
[01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:31.551]  And the websites for those are at ourmolecularfuture.com, but the most recent book is at calcify.com.
[01:13:31.591 --> 01:13:33.153]  It's C-A-L-C-I-F-Y.
[01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:41.699]  And that doesn't just publicize the book, but it also talks about all of the issues that are tied into this.
[01:13:41.759 --> 01:13:43.660]  And here's the link between these two books.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:51.782]  The reason that we got into this in the first place, basically my co-author and I have been working in the science field.
[01:13:51.842 --> 01:13:56.804]  Although I am a science journalist, I have managed scientists for quite some time.
[01:13:56.844 --> 01:14:01.305]  I was the head of an institute that was working in the environmental sciences for many years.
[01:14:01.365 --> 01:14:03.386]  And my co-author is a biological engineer.
[01:14:03.942 --> 01:14:09.665]  Who has worked on a number of projects around the world directed mostly at clean water.
[01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:22.593]  But what we realized and the reason we wrote this book is because these new technologies are breaking out at an incredible pace and running ahead of a lot of the conventional technology.
[01:14:22.653 --> 01:14:23.553]  It's exponential!
[01:14:23.994 --> 01:14:24.574]  Exponential.
[01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:26.435]  It's called exponential acceleration.
[01:14:27.356 --> 01:14:33.279]  And so our molecular future examines the convergence of these technologies
[01:14:33.954 --> 01:14:44.940]  And how we can use those technologies to protect ourselves against some very big natural threats that currently we can't really do that much about and that really pose a risk.
[01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:51.984]  And these changes dwarf the atomic bomb, the theory of relativity, the internal combustion engine.
[01:14:52.285 --> 01:14:55.006]  They even dwarf, I would say, the discovery of fire.
[01:14:55.266 --> 01:15:01.390]  Well, the interesting thing is that not only does the technology have the possibility to do that, but it also has the possibility
[01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:19.951]  to help us cope with some very big nasty natural occurrences that until now we really haven't been able to handle so that's dealt with in our molecular future but in the second book which is the calcium bomb what we looked at was how can these technologies be used
[01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:43.119]  Right now to bring the broadest possible benefits to the largest possible population so that people can understand that these technologies really can work for them to promote health and longevity and so we'll be talking about that in a while but basically so the first book deals with how we use these technologies to deal with the really big threats
[01:15:43.926 --> 01:15:50.729]  And the next one deals with how we can use these technologies to deal with the really small threats that are inside us biologically.
[01:15:50.949 --> 01:16:10.858]  Okay, for those that don't understand what nanotech is, and I'm just throwing this out there, isn't primitive, naturally occurring nanotech, wouldn't you, I mean, kind of say akin to that would be crystals, or these naturally occurring things that grow themselves?
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:27.972]  Alex, what we're trying to do with nanotechnology is what nature has been doing for more than a billion years and the beautiful example of this that we brought up originally a few years ago and a lot of nanotechnologists really didn't like to hear about it because they thought they were inventing something that nature hadn't done is DNA.
[01:16:28.872 --> 01:16:35.457]  DNA actually is an elegant form of nanotechnology because what it does
[01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:41.373]  It does what the nanotechnologists are doing and are also trying to perfect right now.
[01:16:41.553 --> 01:17:00.844]  And now I've seen the shift in the last year, and I had read some of the papers where this was being talked about a long time ago, and you're right, now they're finally having to admit, oh, you know, literally ourselves, these codes off of these basic energy sources keep replicating these incredible self-replicating engines.
[01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:03.406]  Yeah, basically what we have here
[01:17:04.188 --> 01:17:15.591]  is tiny molecular-sized engines that have software attached to them that instructs them to make copies of themselves and then build bigger machines that then can build functioning machines.
[01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:16.551]  Well, guess what?
[01:17:16.991 --> 01:17:18.151]  That's what DNA does.
[01:17:18.492 --> 01:17:19.272]  And you know what it builds?
[01:17:19.412 --> 01:17:20.032]  It builds us.
[01:17:20.872 --> 01:17:28.914]  And so basically what we're trying to do, what nanotechnologists are trying to do, is to emulate that and control it.
[01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:30.815]  It's really that basic.
[01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:32.695]  And whether it's done with
[01:17:33.217 --> 01:17:40.982]  Electrical, or chemical, or mechanical, or biological properties, that's basically the aim of the game.
[01:17:41.263 --> 01:17:44.745]  Well, let's shift into the nuclear sciences and the subatomic particles.
[01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:51.890]  They are doing superconducting supercollider tests that top scientists have told them, and I'm sure you know this, preaching to the choir here,
[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:55.012]  Could cause a chain reaction and blow the whole planet up.
[01:17:55.292 --> 01:17:56.953]  Well, the same thing goes for nanotech.
[01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:06.760]  I mean, all this just out-of-control testing that's being done, you know, they could create something that starts growing in a laboratory and pecks over the face of the earth in just a few months.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:16.026]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of talk about that, and the founder of modern nanotechnology, who is really Eric Drexler, who coined this term
[01:18:16.645 --> 01:18:34.119]  Grey goo and everything getting out of control, and little machines using carbon-based life forms as food, has basically said, you know, if we look at the way that nature works, and even the type of nature that we have fooled around with and made a mess of sometimes... Nature has built-in defenses.
[01:18:34.219 --> 01:18:40.204]  It has built-in defenses, and that's the argument against the whole thing getting out of control, but we'll get into that after the break.
[01:18:40.964 --> 01:18:45.648]  But you can say nature has built-in defenses against uranium, you know, being purified out of the Rocky Mountains.
[01:18:46.405 --> 01:18:50.308]  Yeah, and so what we have to do is... and that's what our books are about.
[01:18:50.328 --> 01:18:50.648]  Stay there!
[01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:52.770]  Stay there!
[01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:58.094]  This is Jeff Diamond and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[01:18:58.194 --> 01:19:01.356]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[01:19:01.376 --> 01:19:02.197]  Her name is Joni.
[01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:06.040]  She already lost 12 pounds in only seven days and she was so excited.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.863]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[01:19:10.063 --> 01:19:14.768]  When you drink a right size smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[01:19:14.828 --> 01:19:16.630]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.592]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[01:19:19.652 --> 01:19:26.519]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry.
[01:19:26.559 --> 01:19:28.421]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[01:19:28.481 --> 01:19:29.422]  It's a great product.

[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:59.623]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:07.846]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.186 --> 01:20:16.049]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.369 --> 01:20:21.113]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.453 --> 01:20:26.156]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.676 --> 01:20:30.539]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.040]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:21:53.772 --> 01:21:54.913]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.193 --> 01:22:00.198]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.438 --> 01:22:03.061]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.261 --> 01:22:11.789]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:23:04.935 --> 01:23:21.544]  We're talking to Douglas Mulhall, leading nanotechnology journalist and one-time award-winning documentary filmmaker and broadcast executive, who has appeared often on radio and TV and written some amazing books, with a scientist and of course managed scientific operations.
[01:23:22.425 --> 01:23:29.409]  Continuing where you left off, sir... Well, you know, Alex, let's talk about what it is we're talking about when we say nanotechnology.
[01:23:29.429 --> 01:23:33.831]  You know, we gave this example of DNA and nature doing it, but here's the important thing.
[01:23:34.966 --> 01:24:01.033]  The reason that nanotechnology has become so important is because particles of things that we see every day, when they get down to the scale of 1 billionth to 100 billionth of a meter, which is a billionth of a meter is a nanometer, when they get down to that level, they take on fundamentally different properties than they do at the macro scale.
[01:24:01.053 --> 01:24:02.153]  And I'll give you an example.
[01:24:02.934 --> 01:24:04.254]  Gold particles.
[01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:24.985]  are a million times more luminescent at the nanoscale than they are in regular gold and that's because these properties such as electrostatic properties and frictional properties take over from properties like gravity and all the other things that we're used to dealing with
[01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:26.763]  at the human scale.
[01:24:26.903 --> 01:24:34.770]  So, that is what got scientists so interested, is these different properties that take over at that level.
[01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:41.095]  And so, for example, an application of that would be, with a gold nanoparticle, you can actually track it.
[01:24:41.255 --> 01:24:46.159]  You can attach it to a cell in the body and track it non-invasively through the body.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:54.166]  If it's attached, for example, to a special protein on a cancer cell, that would let you track an individual cancer cell through the body
[01:24:54.547 --> 01:25:00.620]  And if you attach something to kill that cell off, you could kill that cell without nuking the whole body with radiation.
[01:25:00.681 --> 01:25:03.307]  So, that's what they're actually trying to do right now.
[01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:09.494]  And gold nanoshells are being used right now in medicine to do that kind of tracking.
[01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:16.198]  So you can see there's a current... Well, if it's a million times more luminescent, do you mean it's a million times... Brighter?
[01:25:16.598 --> 01:25:25.944]  Yeah, it sends off a reflection... It's a million times brighter and also... Well, then something like that would have the reflective power for heat shielding on spacecraft.
[01:25:26.385 --> 01:25:30.968]  Well, there's all kinds of applications because these materials also
[01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:39.054]  They can become super hard when you organize them and combine them and scrunch them together at that scale.
[01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:41.035]  So we're talking about really new elements?
[01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:49.822]  Well, yeah, you're talking about the essential creation of new types of materials with new properties and being able to control them.
[01:25:50.182 --> 01:25:51.583]  That is the key thing.
[01:25:51.623 --> 01:25:57.288]  You know, control them with light or electrical properties, you know, all those types of things.
[01:25:58.109 --> 01:26:02.331]  The other important thing to understand about nanotechnology is that there's really two types.
[01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:04.472]  The first type is what we're using right now.
[01:26:04.632 --> 01:26:06.113]  It's in the marketplace right now.
[01:26:06.273 --> 01:26:07.533]  It's being used in products.
[01:26:08.074 --> 01:26:16.498]  And that is basically pushing molecules around in, you know, mostly in two dimensions, sometimes in three dimensions.
[01:26:17.198 --> 01:26:21.560]  And, you know, just basically putting them individually together using bigger machines
[01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:24.516]  ...to push smaller things around.
[01:26:24.696 --> 01:26:32.414]  So, that's the dominant kind of nanotechnology we have today, and compared to what nature does, it's actually quite primitive, because nature does it the opposite way.
[01:26:32.975 --> 01:26:39.738]  Nature uses a more sophisticated kind of molecular nanotechnology that builds from the bottom up.
[01:26:39.858 --> 01:26:50.424]  And what that means is they use the individual molecules and chemical instructions to build themselves into larger machines from the bottom up.
[01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:57.187]  And an example is the sperm and egg meat creates a zygote and nine months later you've got a fully formed human being.
[01:26:57.247 --> 01:27:03.248]  Yeah, except the sperm and egg, of course, are billions of times larger than the nanoparticles that we're talking about.
[01:27:03.268 --> 01:27:12.731]  They consist of literally millions and millions of, for example, fragments of DNA, which are operating more at the nanoscale.
[01:27:12.751 --> 01:27:18.292]  So a more accurate comparison would be this DNA that uses
[01:27:18.752 --> 01:27:24.637]  And I've been hearing them liken genetic engineering to nanotech saying, oh that's how we're going to do it.
[01:27:44.787 --> 01:27:47.069]  I mean, I again see a lot of dangers in that.
[01:27:47.409 --> 01:27:51.932]  Well, you know, that's what we talk about in these books.
[01:27:52.472 --> 01:28:01.858]  The fact is that nanotechnology has some characteristics that are going to move the risk evaluation yardsticks off the field.
[01:28:02.138 --> 01:28:09.923]  That is to say that current risk evaluation methods don't work on the upside or on the downside.
[01:28:10.343 --> 01:28:10.644]  Why?
[01:28:11.284 --> 01:28:14.206]  Because unlike, for example, nuclear energy
[01:28:14.887 --> 01:28:20.629]  Nanotechnology can be used by very small numbers of people to do very powerful things.
[01:28:21.589 --> 01:28:27.971]  And that is what makes it fundamentally different from so many of the technologies that we are using today.
[01:28:29.512 --> 01:28:29.972]  All right.
[01:28:30.032 --> 01:28:32.593]  The future is now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:33.793 --> 01:28:35.834]  And we'll be right back.
[01:28:35.854 --> 01:28:36.274]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.732 --> 01:28:44.693]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.133 --> 01:28:46.734]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:32:05.952 --> 01:32:06.933]  Oh, and just a correction.
[01:32:06.973 --> 01:32:11.897]  I heard Douglas Bohol on Art Bell's show Saturday night.
[01:32:12.498 --> 01:32:18.643]  I was driving home from the office editing, finishing up my new video and heard him on and I did some research on him.
[01:32:19.822 --> 01:32:20.682]  He's the real deal.
[01:32:21.022 --> 01:32:30.704]  He's an award-winning documentary filmmaker, journalist, and of course been a broadcast executive and appear on CNN, New York Times, BBC, you name it.
[01:32:30.724 --> 01:32:31.985]  He's got some best-selling books.
[01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.345]  He's written with a scientist.
[01:32:33.765 --> 01:32:37.106]  He's also managed scientific operations for major institutions.
[01:32:37.506 --> 01:32:38.426]  We're honored to have him.
[01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:40.166]  He'll be coming back up with us here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:40.626 --> 01:32:45.127]  I know we have a load of phone lines, Linda David, Jeremy, Dan, many others.
[01:32:45.267 --> 01:32:47.888]  We'll get to your calls, but first we need to talk about the pluses.
[01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.259]  The attributes of nanotech today.
[01:32:51.279 --> 01:32:54.982]  You know, nanotech is like a gun, or a computer, or a rolling pin.
[01:32:55.742 --> 01:32:58.104]  You know, I mean, it's just an object.
[01:32:58.124 --> 01:32:59.545]  It can be used for good or bad.
[01:33:00.846 --> 01:33:18.339]  So, you know, I'm a supporter of technology, but I'm very concerned about controlling it because it's dangerous, but at the same time, we've got the foxes guarding the hen house, a bunch of psychopaths running the global system, and so it doesn't look good to me, but we'll go back to our guest here in one moment.
[01:33:19.389 --> 01:33:22.990]  Before I do that, it's basically done.
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:28.431]  Today I am just watching the film through again and finishing up the credits.
[01:33:29.712 --> 01:33:30.652]  It's another epic.
[01:33:30.952 --> 01:33:31.652]  My best epic.
[01:33:31.692 --> 01:33:34.053]  It's two hours, thirty plus minutes long.
[01:33:34.073 --> 01:33:35.693]  It's really three films in one.
[01:33:36.234 --> 01:33:40.435]  The police state in New York for the RNC, the sound wave cannons, the press being arrested.
[01:33:40.455 --> 01:33:44.876]  I confront Michael Moore about his 9-11 film being a whitewash.
[01:33:46.934 --> 01:33:47.835]  Just so much more.
[01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:49.675]  That's the first 45 minutes of the film.
[01:33:49.735 --> 01:33:56.299]  Then the next hour is 9-11 and the cover up there and all the latest information and Building 7 and it just goes on and on.
[01:33:57.819 --> 01:34:00.721]  Then we get into skull and bones.
[01:34:00.821 --> 01:34:03.062]  We interview people in the convention.
[01:34:03.102 --> 01:34:08.925]  We confront David Gergen, the Karl Rove of four, I say four, it's five administrations.
[01:34:09.305 --> 01:34:11.006]  Yeah, Nixon to Clinton.
[01:34:12.207 --> 01:34:12.647]  It's just
[01:34:13.707 --> 01:34:14.328]  Amazing!
[01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:17.910]  You absolutely need to get this video.
[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:23.675]  Then we go into Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Fool's Society that controls all of it.
[01:34:24.255 --> 01:34:26.537]  I mean, really folks, this gives you the big picture.
[01:34:27.538 --> 01:34:29.259]  There's no other way to boil it down than this.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.562]  Nazi devil worshippers are creating the Fourth Reich.
[01:34:32.842 --> 01:34:33.262]  Okay?
[01:34:33.462 --> 01:34:34.223]  It's documented.
[01:34:34.803 --> 01:34:35.504]  I'm not kidding.
[01:34:36.305 --> 01:34:39.807]  And it's the real deal and you better get the video.
[01:34:40.248 --> 01:34:42.069]  You can watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:43.090]  It'll be there first.
[01:34:44.167 --> 01:34:45.348]  It's going up tomorrow.

[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.941]  And it is now time for you to take action and get the films.
[01:35:53.422 --> 01:35:57.863]  I do authorize you listeners to make copies of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:35:58.164 --> 01:35:59.644]  My goal is to get the information out.
[01:35:59.664 --> 01:36:01.125]  All right, going back to our guest.
[01:36:01.285 --> 01:36:12.370]  Douglas, I want to get into the pluses and the minuses from your futurist view and all the scientists that you've consulted on this and your scientific background as a scientific journalist.
[01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:17.252]  But let's first talk about your websites and the books.
[01:36:17.924 --> 01:36:26.308]  Well, Alex, what we did in this book, The Calcium Bomb, and the website is www.calcify.com, is we wanted to look
[01:36:26.946 --> 01:36:47.953]  Based on our experience with the earlier book at what was the broadest possible benefit that was accruing right now to the most people to at least give everybody some indication that these technologies not only had a downside but also had a huge upside if we apply them properly.
[01:36:48.473 --> 01:36:56.436]  And so this book, The Calcium Bomb, is basically about that and I just want to explain for any of your listeners who have got
[01:36:57.248 --> 01:37:23.324]  Anything related to heart disease, prostate disease, arthritis, and a whole list of other illnesses that they will see on this website, there has been a new approach that has been published now in clinical trials to heart disease and prostate disease, where especially for people who are very ill, whose other drugs haven't worked, whose surgery hasn't worked,
[01:37:23.877 --> 01:37:32.704]  There is now a new approach that has, in preliminary clinical trials, succeeded in reversing the symptoms of these conditions.
[01:37:32.784 --> 01:37:35.206]  And I've read this in major scientific literature.
[01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:47.877]  I mean, really, it isn't how much plaque is in your arteries, it's that when the calcium gets into it and starts nanotech growing, which, you know, just like limestone, just like what you see with fossils, it makes them brittle,
[01:37:48.684 --> 01:37:53.646]  You just like an old rubber hose in your car blowing and is that what you're getting at?
[01:37:53.666 --> 01:38:01.569]  Yeah, and a lot of people have heard this by more familiar names like hardening of the arteries, like bone spurs, kidney stones.
[01:38:03.008 --> 01:38:09.433]  All of that white stuff that is seen in x-rays on the edges of bones and tendons.
[01:38:09.613 --> 01:38:11.434]  Or what builds up on your teeth.
[01:38:12.115 --> 01:38:18.080]  Well, the stuff that builds up on your teeth is actually a little different because that comes from a bacteria, but... Well, I mean, my dad's a dentist.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:25.986]  I understand that the base of it is there, but once it's there... Inside the tooth pulp, quite often dentists will run into these dental stones.
[01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:28.192]  It's all the same stuff.
[01:38:28.372 --> 01:38:33.017]  It's rock-hard and toxic calcium phosphate deposits.
[01:38:33.397 --> 01:38:36.761]  And here's been the big mystery to doctors for the last 50 years.
[01:38:37.362 --> 01:38:47.352]  Why do these toxic calcium phosphate deposits form in the body, in the organs, in the skin, in all these places, when calcium levels in the blood are perfectly normal?
[01:38:47.893 --> 01:38:48.734]  Why would that happen?
[01:38:49.272 --> 01:39:12.644]  And so there have been thousands and thousands, there are more than 23,000 papers that are published in the National Library of Medicine that reference this problem of calcification but they have not been able to identify a culprit and so quite often patients haven't heard of it even though it goes by all of these individual names in all these individual diseases and when you put them together
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:26.610]  You find that calcification is one of the most pervasive illnesses in America today and has been largely untreatable until one very important thing happened.
[01:39:27.471 --> 01:39:41.581]  Scientists who work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, just not far away from you actually at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, have discovered that there is a tiny nano-sized blood particle
[01:39:42.304 --> 01:39:45.726]  that does something that no other blood particle has been seen to do before.
[01:39:46.407 --> 01:40:03.718]  It calcifies under normal blood condition and this calcification is exactly the same in chemical composition to the calcification that is found in the plaque in heart disease, at the core of kidney stones, in bone spurs, in bursitis, in tendonitis.
[01:40:04.438 --> 01:40:08.941]  So this was a really major breakthrough when they discovered this and actually the particle
[01:40:09.332 --> 01:40:17.698]  Well, it's really simple.
[01:40:17.738 --> 01:40:23.642]  It's like when you take your dishes out of the dishwasher and from the water, they've got all that white film built up on them.
[01:40:24.183 --> 01:40:25.604]  Well, that's a little different, actually.
[01:40:25.624 --> 01:40:31.168]  That's interesting you should say that, because a lot of doctors have blamed calcification on
[01:40:31.778 --> 01:40:36.720]  Precipitation of calcium, even though there's been no evidence that that precipitation occurs.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.921]  My only point is, it is a way to try to illustrate how this stuff builds up.
[01:40:42.021 --> 01:40:44.122]  I understand you're saying... And that's what it looks like.
[01:40:44.142 --> 01:40:46.162]  I understand you're saying it's growing in the body.
[01:40:46.182 --> 01:40:48.023]  Yeah, like a coral reef.
[01:40:48.783 --> 01:40:56.005]  I understand, but it still starts with the basic nutrients that are already in the environment.
[01:40:56.186 --> 01:41:00.807]  Absolutely correct, and the body has been mysteriously taking those nutrients
[01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.816]  And normally, of course, they're used to build healthy bones and teeth.
[01:41:04.297 --> 01:41:12.361]  So the question has been, why the heck does this happen when the calcium levels are normal in the wrong places in the body?
[01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:14.202]  So is it almost like an autoimmune thing?
[01:41:16.623 --> 01:41:23.906]  That's a very good explanation because... You've got these little guys going around, they're supposed to be building bones... And that's what one of the problems is.
[01:41:24.147 --> 01:41:26.968]  These calcium phosphate deposits trigger
[01:41:27.501 --> 01:41:29.022]  an autoimmune reaction.
[01:41:29.162 --> 01:41:39.348]  They trigger acute inflammation, they trigger very big problems with joint movement and pain, and they're also associated with joint destruction.
[01:41:39.788 --> 01:41:51.015]  So they are very pervasive, a huge problem, especially as you start to age, but also younger athletes get them as bone spurs or calcified tendonitis and things like that.
[01:41:51.055 --> 01:41:53.076]  Doesn't sodium fluoride play into this?
[01:41:53.971 --> 01:41:57.372]  Well, you know, not really, and that's what they found.
[01:41:57.933 --> 01:42:03.575]  What they have found is that this thing is actually related, apparently, to this tiny infection.
[01:42:04.075 --> 01:42:07.456]  And so there is actually a biological process that's going on.
[01:42:07.536 --> 01:42:14.679]  But here's the good news, Alex, and this is what we want to talk about when we're talking about what nanoscale technologies can do for people.
[01:42:15.259 --> 01:42:17.340]  When these NASA scientists found this out,
[01:42:17.768 --> 01:42:24.653]  They also, when they were examining it, had to get inside it, and the way they got inside it was to strip off the calcium layer and then kill it.
[01:42:25.273 --> 01:42:27.574]  And when they did that, they discovered how to treat it.
[01:42:28.295 --> 01:42:35.099]  And that treatment has been used by Cleveland Clinic, for example, who just published a paper on it three weeks ago.
[01:42:35.119 --> 01:42:36.120]  And what is that treatment?
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:43.905]  That treatment is, and it's especially important, and I know we're going to talk about this in view of this FDA scandal over these new drugs,
[01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.492]  that have got all these problems with them.
[01:42:46.532 --> 01:43:06.962]  What they did here was they used conventional well-known chemicals and drugs that have a known safety record but what they did was they put them together in a new cocktail and it was that cocktail that Cleveland Clinic used in their clinical trial and that doctors in Tampa Florida used in the clinical trial in heart disease
[01:43:07.538 --> 01:43:11.703]  And in both cases, they were able to reverse the measurable symptoms.
[01:43:11.983 --> 01:43:13.325]  Now, let me ask you a question.
[01:43:13.365 --> 01:43:18.190]  Does it target the autoimmune response of these little bone builders?
[01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:25.579]  Or does it just simply, like putting a fuel injector cleaner in your engine, does it dissolve it?
[01:43:26.264 --> 01:43:28.706]  Actually, that's a great question, because it does both.
[01:43:29.346 --> 01:43:34.689]  What it does is, it first of all, strips off the calcium phosphate layer.
[01:43:35.089 --> 01:43:36.570]  Okay, so I get what you're saying.
[01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:37.611]  It's like a cycle.
[01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:41.013]  Once these start, it builds on the autoimmune response.
[01:43:41.333 --> 01:43:45.215]  So by cleaning it up, that makes the inflammation go away?
[01:43:45.476 --> 01:43:52.480]  You got it exactly, because calcification replicates in the body at a rate of about, it doubles once every two and a half years.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.541]  So you can get it when you're a teenager and not notice it.
[01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:57.463]  But then when you're 45 or 50, whammo!
[01:43:57.883 --> 01:44:03.527]  And that's why we call it the calcium bomb, because it builds and builds and builds until it provokes a crisis.
[01:44:03.707 --> 01:44:06.609]  Just like nanotech, it has an exponential growth.
[01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:10.212]  Okay, now, because I want to get the calls, let's get in...
[01:44:10.925 --> 01:44:23.273]  You know, to the good things we can do with nanotech, and then I want to get into the bad side of this, and we talked during the break about how the elite does want to control this, and the centralized model versus the decentralized model.
[01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:28.116]  And I just want to add one thing about this nanobacteria thing, the calcification is very important.
[01:44:28.557 --> 01:44:32.019]  Doctors at Washington Hospital Center have also developed a test
[01:44:32.423 --> 01:44:40.594]  That correlates that particle with coronary artery calcification, which means they can find heart disease in people who show no symptoms.
[01:44:40.694 --> 01:44:45.341]  And the reason that's important is because half of all heart attacks happen in people who have no symptoms.
[01:44:45.381 --> 01:44:47.564]  So here we have new tests
[01:44:48.098 --> 01:44:56.262]  New treatments, people can read about this at our website, and anyone who's got those illnesses should find out about them and get their doctors to find out about them.
[01:44:56.302 --> 01:45:02.926]  So they're making now direct links to him not even having to go into invasive surgery or do a CAT scan.
[01:45:03.206 --> 01:45:09.669]  If you've got this little creature in you, then there's a good chance he's already done his damage.
[01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.570]  That's right.
[01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:15.994]  And the beauty of it now is that they actually have a way to get at it after 50 years of not knowing how to touch it.
[01:45:16.275 --> 01:45:16.675]  All right.
[01:45:17.115 --> 01:45:19.958]  Now let's get into, just quickly, some of the other upsides.
[01:45:19.978 --> 01:45:20.859]  I want to get into the downside.
[01:45:21.559 --> 01:45:33.350]  Well, I mean, one of the major upsides that was just announced this week, actually, is that a solar cell has been invented and is being brought to market.
[01:45:33.823 --> 01:45:38.547]  That is five times more efficient than anything that's on the market today.
[01:45:39.108 --> 01:45:41.450]  And most importantly, it is cheap.
[01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:52.039]  And the way that they have been able to do this is to be able to create a three dimensional what's known as a quantum dot that has been used in quite a lot of nanotechnology.
[01:45:52.099 --> 01:45:57.884]  It's really basically a it's an artificial atom in some senses, although it's about 10 times or 100 times bigger.
[01:45:59.318 --> 01:46:05.162]  But the advantage of it is, it's three-dimensional and they can control a lot of its properties.
[01:46:05.242 --> 01:46:09.345]  And what that does, in the case of solar energy... They're able to harness more of the power.
[01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:25.095]  Yeah, because you're not just using a flat surface, you're using a three-dimensional surface that can not only absorb energy from all different angles, but can also transmit it across nanometers to make it much more energy effective as well.
[01:46:25.655 --> 01:46:28.037]  So, this means a dramatic drop in cost,
[01:46:28.436 --> 01:46:30.737]  A dramatic increase in efficiency, and guess what?
[01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:41.084]  It's going into the marketplace at the end of 2006, and this really, if it is allowed to happen, will provide a mechanism to help us get rid of oil.
[01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:47.608]  Yeah, I saw reports of that, and because the Communist Chinese military is going to implement, our army is going to implement, right?
[01:46:47.708 --> 01:46:52.591]  Well, this is the irony of the whole thing, because, you know, you have been so good at explaining
[01:46:53.061 --> 01:47:16.767]  How the elites often try and control these technologies and the ironic thing here is that all the militaries in the world are rushing against each other to get this technology going and in so doing have propelled the research on solar energy to the point where commercial groups, non-military groups, have commercialized it and are able to use it.
[01:47:16.967 --> 01:47:21.028]  And this is what Eisenhower talked about, the danger of the military-industrial complex is that 90%
[01:47:22.388 --> 01:47:30.554]  Alex, you've got it, and you know, in all the doom and gloom about this, and there is a lot of cause to have doom and gloom about it, this is a bright shining light, because if it goes ahead,
[01:47:48.208 --> 01:47:53.532]  We could dramatically affect the whole globalized politics right now.
[01:47:53.552 --> 01:48:01.739]  Right now a solar car really won't go over 30 miles an hour, but if this is five times more powerful, it could be smaller receptors, and your car's doing 120.
[01:48:01.779 --> 01:48:04.321]  And I'm buying one!
[01:48:04.421 --> 01:48:12.568]  Yeah, and the big thing is that it can be combined with miniaturized fuel cells that then store the energy from this solar paint.
[01:48:13.047 --> 01:48:15.269]  And by the way, that's the other advantage of this.
[01:48:15.449 --> 01:48:16.389]  Of nanotech, yeah.
[01:48:16.569 --> 01:48:36.343]  It can actually be, some of it can be painted onto surfaces, so you're no longer stuck with these big clunky solar panels that everybody has right now, but instead can put it on flexible surfaces, and when you put that together with fuel cell storage, you have got yourself a new energy paradigm.
[01:48:36.723 --> 01:48:41.026]  But, it'll probably never come to market, because the globalists are going to nuke a city in Europe or the U.S.
[01:48:41.046 --> 01:48:42.087]  and have total martial law.
[01:48:42.999 --> 01:48:44.941]  Well, you know, it's going to be a tight race.
[01:48:45.802 --> 01:49:01.458]  It's going to be a tight race because, naturally, of course, because the existing energy paradigm is centralized, and there's a lot of interest in maintaining that centralization, you are seeing exactly that struggle happening right now.
[01:49:01.478 --> 01:49:05.162]  And it's going to be really interesting because here you've got these Silicon Valley companies,
[01:49:06.829 --> 01:49:08.851]  Yeah, they're dying.
[01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:12.394]  The old order really is dying, which they call the New World Order.
[01:49:12.674 --> 01:49:16.138]  It's totally threatened by all this, but they're panicking.
[01:49:16.158 --> 01:49:27.288]  They're panicking, and it's going to be an interesting situation also because the other thing that we're seeing is this nanotechnology is forcing the collapse and overload of the patent regime
[01:49:27.862 --> 01:49:36.948]  And that's something we can talk about after the break because they're being overloaded with all these inventions that are being propelled by this accelerating technology.
[01:49:38.148 --> 01:49:41.410]  They've got to have world tyranny or they lose their monopoly of control.
[01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:43.351]  Yeah, it's going to be an interesting race.
[01:49:44.092 --> 01:49:44.432]  It is.
[01:49:44.492 --> 01:49:45.233]  It's a race.
[01:49:46.333 --> 01:49:46.954]  A race.
[01:49:47.194 --> 01:49:48.054]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:48.895]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.524 --> 01:49:57.866]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.046 --> 01:50:02.468]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.628 --> 01:50:07.010]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.050 --> 01:50:08.391]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.211 --> 01:50:10.112]  Hammered!
[01:50:10.172 --> 01:50:14.394]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.454 --> 01:50:21.378]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.518 --> 01:50:23.539]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.899 --> 01:50:34.347]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.508 --> 01:50:39.912]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:58.127 --> 01:52:59.468]  We don't need more taxes.
[01:52:59.488 --> 01:53:00.909]  We don't need more regulation.
[01:53:01.429 --> 01:53:02.850]  Most of it's corporate welfare.
[01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:04.191]  It's always about control.
[01:53:04.211 --> 01:53:13.837]  But this is why they're really racing to put in the satellite tracking of the transponders in California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, New York.
[01:53:14.557 --> 01:53:18.020]  Because, you know, they say, oh, because we're not getting enough money from fuel taxes.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:18.500]  They're actually
[01:53:19.255 --> 01:53:20.255]  Getting more than ever.
[01:53:20.296 --> 01:53:25.398]  We've actually, instead of using 15 million barrels a day like we were five years ago, it's 20-something million barrels a day.
[01:53:25.618 --> 01:53:26.578]  We're making more money than ever.
[01:53:26.818 --> 01:53:34.122]  But if this revolution is successful, if all this is able to happen, just one aspect of nanotech, it's over for them.
[01:53:34.962 --> 01:53:37.383]  And so they've got to start taxing some other way to get control.
[01:53:37.403 --> 01:53:38.964]  The problem is the taxes they're talking about
[01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:45.196]  ...are roughly eight times what current taxes are, and they sell it as a tax cut!
[01:53:45.616 --> 01:53:46.798]  A two-year-old can do the math!
[01:53:47.498 --> 01:53:48.739]  But they're very threatened by this.
[01:53:48.779 --> 01:53:49.580]  They want control.
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:54:01.090]  Continuing with our guest, a, of course, researcher and award-winning journalist and broadcast executive and manager of major scientific operations, expert on nanotech, Douglas Mulhall.
[01:54:02.111 --> 01:54:05.034]  Douglas, continuing now, talking about the negatives of nanotech.
[01:54:05.174 --> 01:54:22.261]  Yeah, and I just also want to give an example of how some of these established powers are trying to keep this stuff hemmed in, and it has to do with the, you know, the FDA hearings that are going on right now about the conflict of interest in approving only the most expensive drugs that they can, you know, make the most money off of.
[01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:30.565]  Well, the flip side of that, and it's come out in the Los Angeles Times recently, is that they are ignoring
[01:54:30.973 --> 01:54:41.843]  The affordable treatments that are coming out for people in favor of approving all of these other more expensive ones and that is exactly what has happened with this new approach to calcification.
[01:54:42.443 --> 01:54:51.271]  You know the scientists, imagine working at Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic and NASA and all of these groups, do you think that they can get
[01:54:51.673 --> 01:55:00.597]  These government regulatory agencies and research supporting agencies to have a serious look at broadening this treatment.
[01:55:00.617 --> 01:55:09.601]  Well, they do that, listen, they do that across the board and then all the real cures are cataloged and given to the elite clinics that serve the royalty and the top elite.
[01:55:09.701 --> 01:55:12.763]  Yeah, and exactly, and in this case, you know, this treatment is already out there.
[01:55:13.023 --> 01:55:15.044]  That goes back, Douglas, to this two-tier system.
[01:55:16.024 --> 01:55:17.465]  We already have a two-tier system.
[01:55:18.775 --> 01:55:21.879]  Where we get the expensive junk and they get all the real stuff.
[01:55:21.919 --> 01:55:22.240]  Go ahead.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:26.045]  Well, and you know, in this particular case, the treatment is out there.
[01:55:26.485 --> 01:55:32.474]  Right now, it's a safe combination of generic drugs that, you know, people can't make a big profit off of.
[01:55:32.914 --> 01:55:34.957]  And it works according to these clinical trials.
[01:55:35.297 --> 01:55:40.927]  But do you think that the NIH is funding any further research to see how well it will work against other diseases?
[01:55:41.247 --> 01:55:47.397]  Well, we've also got a public that's lazy and doesn't really care about their health, so they're not going to research this stuff.
[01:55:47.417 --> 01:55:49.681]  They're just going to believe whatever the ad on television tells them.
[01:55:50.208 --> 01:55:55.271]  Yeah, well, with what you see on the evening news, with what drug to tell your doctor to give you next, it's not surprising.
[01:55:55.551 --> 01:55:57.752]  Well, yeah, about half their advertisement is that.
[01:55:58.593 --> 01:56:06.297]  But some of the futuristic, I mean, we're talking, how long until this totally shatters the current economic paradigm of nanotech?
[01:56:06.317 --> 01:56:06.877]  10 to 30 years?
[01:56:07.117 --> 01:56:13.701]  Well, you know, Alex, it's very interesting you just say that, because there have been a number of nanotechnologists who I have a lot of respect for.
[01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:15.602]  I mean, Eric Drexler being one of them.
[01:56:16.395 --> 01:56:28.882]  But also there's a number of associations in the United States that are working on this, you know, the Foresight Institute and the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology and the Foundation for Accelerating Change.
[01:56:29.502 --> 01:56:35.306]  They have all taken shots at estimating and here's here are the numbers that they're looking at.
[01:56:36.006 --> 01:56:37.747]  They're saying that maximum
[01:56:38.931 --> 01:56:47.675]  30 years when we're really going to see a type of change in society that is just impossible to predict or control.
[01:56:47.695 --> 01:56:49.395]  That's the outside.
[01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:50.376]  Some of them go to 35, 40 years.
[01:56:52.353 --> 01:57:00.640]  And others are going to 10 or 15 years, so basically... Yeah, but looking at the exponential curve of this, we're talking 5 years!
[01:57:01.021 --> 01:57:04.143]  Well, you know, I don't think it's going to happen that fast.
[01:57:04.364 --> 01:57:09.468]  But I can definitely... Yeah, but they told us the B-2 bomber was new in 1987 and had been around for a decade.
[01:57:09.808 --> 01:57:17.295]  Yeah, and if you look, for example, at the solar cells that we were talking about, I mean, imagine if those things took off, and imagine the changes that those things would bring about.
[01:57:18.370 --> 01:57:21.411]  Well, that's a global shift right there!
[01:57:21.751 --> 01:57:22.351]  Absolutely.
[01:57:22.651 --> 01:57:32.314]  So, in some ways, the primitive nanotechnology that we're using now could start to have major effects in the next few years, if it's allowed to go ahead.
[01:57:34.274 --> 01:57:38.456]  Yeah, and what's this going to do to all the engineering systems that like the engineered obsolescence?
[01:57:38.476 --> 01:57:39.176]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:39.216 --> 01:57:40.056]  Third Hour, stay with us.
[01:57:49.853 --> 01:57:50.493]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.173 --> 01:57:52.214]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.934 --> 01:57:54.034]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.695 --> 01:57:55.515]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.275 --> 01:57:57.176]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.836 --> 01:58:01.437]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.018 --> 01:58:06.139]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.521]  We're talking to Douglas Mulhall.
[01:58:10.879 --> 01:58:21.809]  He's a leading nanotechnology journalist, one-time award-winning documentary filmmaker and broadcast executive, who has appeared often on nationally syndicated talk shows, CNN, New York Times, BBC Newsweek, PBS.
[01:58:21.829 --> 01:58:27.994]  I've interviewed him, and he has run major scientific organizations.
[01:58:28.074 --> 01:58:34.260]  He's written several books with the top scientists who are experts on nanotechnology and a lot more.
[01:58:35.342 --> 01:58:38.403]  And we are honored to be joined by him.
[01:58:38.443 --> 01:58:47.084]  Of course, he's written for Newsday, The Futurist, The National Post, and many other major publications in the United States and across the world.
[01:58:47.604 --> 01:58:49.585]  And we'll go to your calls here.
[01:58:49.885 --> 01:58:51.405]  In fact, we're going to go to them right now.
[01:58:52.385 --> 01:59:01.507]  Let's go ahead, and I know some of you callers have been holding forever, so these calls may be all over the map, but I'm sure it all ties back into these futuristic ships we're seeing.
[01:59:02.227 --> 01:59:03.668]  Let's talk to Linda in Texas.
[01:59:03.728 --> 01:59:04.548]  Linda, you're on the air.
[01:59:04.588 --> 01:59:04.948]  Go ahead.
[01:59:05.956 --> 01:59:25.782]  Hi Alex, my call is in reference to a simple medical marijuana bill that's being pushed in our Texas legislature right now, introduced by both Republicans and supported by Republicans and Democrats, but our governor promises to veto this medical marijuana bill.
[01:59:25.802 --> 01:59:28.882]  Well, haven't you seen Reefer Madness?
[01:59:28.962 --> 01:59:32.423]  If you smoke pot, you're going to go out and kill 55 people with a huge dagger.
[01:59:32.984 --> 01:59:33.944]  Right, in Texas,
[01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:38.750]  incarcerate thousands of medical marijuana users.
[01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:53.473]  So we have a group called Texans for Medical Marijuana dot o-r-g and you can go online and you can send a letter to your representative in Texas and ask them to support this very simple medical marijuana bill.
[01:59:53.633 --> 01:59:55.653]  Okay, listen Linda, thank you for the call.
[01:59:55.713 --> 01:59:56.713]  Interesting information.
[01:59:57.253 --> 02:00:04.675]  Also, you know, I can say something about that Alex because nanostructured drugs and recreational drugs
[02:00:05.316 --> 02:00:26.825]  are going to make medical marijuana almost obsolete because they're basically taking the active ingredients from that and putting them into configurations that, first of all, are far more powerful and in other ways are, you don't have to grow them in one place and transport them to another because they're going to be manufactured in home labs.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.183]  Basically, you get a nanotech kit that will make anything you want.
[02:00:31.663 --> 02:00:55.780]  Well, one of the powerful points about nanotechnology is the ability to manufacture these very complex chemical combinations with, you know, anyone who has basically a lab on a chip, which is being, you know, used now, along with the computer program, and you can get two or three highly trained chemists in a room and they can do a lot.
[02:00:56.621 --> 02:00:57.001]  And so,
[02:00:57.631 --> 02:01:06.853]  The whole era of traceable drugs is about to take a gigantic leap because of all of these developments.
[02:01:06.873 --> 02:01:13.654]  And then you change one molecule, even if they make drugs illegal on a daily basis, you just keep changing the molecules and it's not illegal.
[02:01:13.694 --> 02:01:20.516]  Exactly, and the reason I'm bringing that up is because it is correct to say that all these people have been incarcerated because of marijuana, but there's no way
[02:01:20.936 --> 02:01:27.840]  That the system is going to be able to keep up with the variety of non-detectable recreational drugs that are coming onto the market right now.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.321]  Well, it's all a joke to begin with.
[02:01:29.381 --> 02:01:37.845]  I mean, they push Ritalin and Prozac that are deadly on our children, and then they'll SWAT team your house looking for some marijuana that George Washington smoked.
[02:01:38.345 --> 02:01:39.686]  And I don't use these drugs.
[02:01:39.886 --> 02:01:40.927]  I'm not even defending it.
[02:01:40.947 --> 02:01:42.988]  The point is... It's a type of schizophrenia.
[02:01:43.928 --> 02:01:46.229]  Well, yeah, it's an excuse for control.
[02:01:46.569 --> 02:01:46.749]  Yes.
[02:01:47.049 --> 02:01:53.911]  I mean, the private interest on the prisons, I need an excuse to put people in the prisons, working 20 cents an hour, where else can they get slaves?
[02:01:55.051 --> 02:01:59.952]  Well, and, you know, the whole thing is going to become so outdated so quickly by this technology.
[02:01:59.972 --> 02:02:07.935]  Yeah, I want to talk about how it's going to affect labor and what the masses of people are even going to do with their time with the nanotech revolution.
[02:02:08.255 --> 02:02:13.276]  Well, I think that the nanotech revolution is going to finally force us to redefine work.
[02:02:14.065 --> 02:02:19.349]  Because, basically, you're going to have, first of all, machines doing a lot of things.
[02:02:19.849 --> 02:02:25.112]  But also, you're going to have people redefining what they do.
[02:02:25.673 --> 02:02:29.095]  And that's just going to require a complete reassessment.
[02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:30.876]  A total shift.
[02:02:31.597 --> 02:02:36.780]  The species literally going into a completely new dimension.
[02:02:37.141 --> 02:02:37.641]  Absolutely.
[02:02:37.941 --> 02:02:40.343]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:02:40.363 --> 02:02:41.664]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:41.684 --> 02:02:42.084]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.385 --> 02:02:46.866]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.086 --> 02:02:50.168]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.288 --> 02:02:54.190]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.230 --> 02:02:58.472]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.812 --> 02:03:02.594]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.734 --> 02:03:04.535]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.775 --> 02:03:08.038]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.078 --> 02:03:12.803]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.

[02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:56.190]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.711 --> 02:06:02.672]  Technology, advanced technologies that the government's been trying to suppress and control.
[02:06:03.292 --> 02:06:04.932]  How will this affect our society?
[02:06:05.213 --> 02:06:06.053]  What are the dangers?
[02:06:06.073 --> 02:06:11.214]  We're going to be talking more about that in this hour with our guest who's coming back up with us in just a few minutes.
[02:06:11.814 --> 02:06:14.615]  You do not want to miss it, Douglas Mulholland.
[02:06:15.911 --> 02:06:20.712]  And then, of course, we're going to go straight to Frank and James and Jack and everybody else that's holding.
[02:06:21.072 --> 02:06:27.614]  You want to talk to our guests or talk about these technological, just geometric or exponential growth curves.
[02:06:27.634 --> 02:06:28.194]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:28.214 --> 02:06:28.254]  800-259-9231.
[02:06:28.294 --> 02:06:29.595]  But before we go back to Douglas,
[02:06:39.022 --> 02:06:44.127]  Let's shift gears and talk to Debbie Morrow there at New Millennium Concepts.
[02:06:44.187 --> 02:06:52.116]  The high quality, made in America, very rare, water purification systems.
[02:06:52.536 --> 02:06:53.637]  And it's what I use.
[02:06:54.458 --> 02:06:56.501]  It is just a fabulous system.
[02:06:56.641 --> 02:06:58.663]  Indian knockoffs of pieces of junk.
[02:06:59.624 --> 02:07:06.526]  Costs just as much or more, and we've got some great specials going right now, and a lot of other items and products that I really believe in.
[02:07:07.566 --> 02:07:08.727]  Just high quality stuff.
[02:07:09.047 --> 02:07:10.347]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with me.
[02:07:10.727 --> 02:07:13.008]  Hi Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[02:07:13.408 --> 02:07:13.748]  You bet.
[02:07:13.788 --> 02:07:20.050]  Tell folks about the Big Berkey, the Berkey Light, the new Black Berkey Elements that are even a higher standard, and how folks get them.
[02:07:20.695 --> 02:07:30.118]  Well, the Berkey water filter and purification systems are the ultimate water filtration possible for your personal protection.
[02:07:31.098 --> 02:07:32.679]  You can use them every single day.
[02:07:32.759 --> 02:07:45.643]  You know, it's funny, I've run into some people recently that I've met at different places and we get to talking and I tell them about Berkey water filters and they say, oh, I have one.
[02:07:45.703 --> 02:07:48.184]  I bought it for Y2K and it's in my closet.
[02:07:48.834 --> 02:07:49.094]  Thank you.
[02:08:06.485 --> 02:08:08.226]  Then you already know how to use it.
[02:08:08.246 --> 02:08:09.747]  Well Debbie, it's simple.
[02:08:10.007 --> 02:08:10.507]  It's simple.
[02:08:10.547 --> 02:08:13.468]  If we want to be healthy, our bodies are 70% water.
[02:08:13.789 --> 02:08:22.793]  The water is full of, you know, gasoline additives and herbicides and pesticides and motor oil and even if they put chlorine in it, it kills the bacteria.
[02:08:23.113 --> 02:08:25.374]  You're still drinking them bacteria, folks!
[02:08:25.955 --> 02:08:27.295]  And live bacteria, too.
[02:08:27.315 --> 02:08:32.558]  Don't forget about those people who are buying bottled water at the little convenience store.
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:41.811]  Drinking a few sips of it, leaving it in their car for several hours, and then drinking some more... And for those who don't know, just type in a search engine...
[02:08:44.381 --> 02:08:47.763]  You know, Bottled Water Not Safe, you'll get all these mainstream news articles.
[02:08:48.464 --> 02:08:52.847]  Folks, it's time to call, it's time to get a Berkey Waterful Treasure System.
[02:08:52.867 --> 02:08:57.890]  They've got little sports bottles, too, that really do a great job as well.
[02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:59.591]  Tell folks about the sports bottle special.
[02:09:00.272 --> 02:09:05.796]  Well, the sports bottles, we have some generic labeled ones that we purchased from the
[02:09:07.192 --> 02:09:12.816]  That they don't put our label on it, so we're able to make a really good special for them.
[02:09:13.056 --> 02:09:14.737]  It doesn't even matter, it's the same filter.
[02:09:14.777 --> 02:09:19.020]  Right, the same exact filter, same exact bottle, but doesn't have the writing on the bottle.
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.902]  And you can get 5 for $99, or you can get 12 for $199.
[02:09:21.962 --> 02:09:23.563]  So that's a really good deal.
[02:09:28.559 --> 02:09:33.660]  Especially this time of year when you're going to be out in the heat so much, you need to drink water all the time.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:35.401]  That just makes your water safe.
[02:09:36.921 --> 02:09:40.062]  Now the Berkey purification system, tell them about that briefly.
[02:09:40.082 --> 02:09:45.684]  Okay, the Berkey, black Berkey purification elements come in our Berkey Light systems.
[02:09:46.224 --> 02:09:50.645]  They take out pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.
[02:09:51.215 --> 02:10:12.339]  From methane, VOCs, inorganic minerals, things like that, like your chlorine, and your benzene, and your atrazine, and your MTB, to a non-detectable level, which means that under the most powerful electron microscope, there were absolutely no contaminants, no pathogens were detected, which is amazing.
[02:10:12.399 --> 02:10:17.780]  It set a new standard in the water purification industry when we developed these filters.
[02:10:18.599 --> 02:10:20.280]  And they're very simple to use.
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:22.020]  You don't have to hire a plumber.
[02:10:22.941 --> 02:10:25.082]  They're a gravity water filter system.
[02:10:25.122 --> 02:10:26.562]  You set it on your counter.
[02:10:26.742 --> 02:10:28.723]  It holds two and a half gallons of water.
[02:10:29.163 --> 02:10:36.946]  You fill it up with water and very slowly the water seeps through the filters and drips down into the bottom filter.
[02:10:37.667 --> 02:10:38.987]  And then you take it out with a stick.
[02:10:39.047 --> 02:10:40.468]  I'm going to give folks the number.
[02:10:40.908 --> 02:10:41.508]  Write it down.
[02:10:41.528 --> 02:10:42.328]  Give her a call.
[02:10:42.448 --> 02:10:43.269]  Go to the website.
[02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:44.989]  They make the Black Berkey Elements.
[02:10:45.009 --> 02:10:46.310]  Made right here in America.
[02:10:46.934 --> 02:10:49.598]  They've got a lot of other great items.
[02:10:50.199 --> 02:10:51.100]  $199 without the lights.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.863]  The LED lights built into the base.
[02:10:52.883 --> 02:10:54.605]  $259 with that.
[02:10:54.665 --> 02:10:56.107]  You get two free gifts for the $259.
[02:10:56.147 --> 02:10:57.309]  You get one free gift for the $199.
[02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:59.312]  Give her a call right now, folks.
[02:11:03.558 --> 02:11:05.720]  1-888-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-4438, 808-803-
[02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:27.379]  If you call or in the comments section at Berkeywater.com.
[02:11:27.659 --> 02:11:28.961]  Again, that number, 888-803-4438.
[02:11:29.421 --> 02:11:32.684]  Debbie, always great to hear from you.
[02:11:32.704 --> 02:11:33.605]  God bless and take care.
[02:11:33.625 --> 02:11:34.806]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:34.986 --> 02:11:35.346]  Bye-bye.
[02:11:35.767 --> 02:11:44.635]  Alright, going back to our guest, who I appreciate holding, and then straight back to your calls, Douglas Mulholland, continuing to talk about nanotech technologies.
[02:11:44.975 --> 02:11:47.698]  Let's talk to Frank in West Virginia.
[02:11:48.018 --> 02:11:49.359]  Frank, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:11:49.379 --> 02:11:49.760]  Go ahead.
[02:11:50.382 --> 02:11:52.363]  Hello, I have a question for you, Dr. Mohaw.
[02:11:52.923 --> 02:11:53.923]  Actually, a couple questions.
[02:11:54.003 --> 02:11:56.664]  I'll give the first one and wait for your response.
[02:11:56.824 --> 02:12:00.785]  It's concerning supplementation of minerals and calcium.
[02:12:01.425 --> 02:12:03.586]  A lot of us do take it and we've heard all our life.
[02:12:03.906 --> 02:12:04.106]  Right.
[02:12:04.446 --> 02:12:07.707]  It is very important for a lot of bodily functions.
[02:12:08.027 --> 02:12:11.608]  Calcium citrate really pushes the best, or at least one of them.
[02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:15.530]  I was wondering what your view is on taking those, first of all.
[02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:16.950]  Well, here's the interesting thing.
[02:12:17.862 --> 02:12:24.065]  And we discussed this, by the way, in this book, The Calcium Bomb, if you want to know more about it.
[02:12:24.145 --> 02:12:35.709]  But the interesting thing is that there doesn't seem to be any link between drinking milk, taking calcium supplements, and this calcification that forms in the human body and causes all this trouble.
[02:12:36.129 --> 02:12:38.730]  And this has been one of the great mysteries, you know?
[02:12:39.111 --> 02:12:45.133]  Why is it that when the levels are perfectly normal, it doesn't matter, you know, if you're... I mean, sometimes
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:52.486]  If you really OD on calcium supplements, you can get a different kind of calcification that is from having too much of it.
[02:12:52.886 --> 02:13:07.119]  Basically, the scientific studies show, and this has been in the news, and you covered, one of the pioneers exposing it, NASA first discovered it, is that it is a little bone builder, or a creature that's in our body, who's basically going crazy.
[02:13:07.239 --> 02:13:13.304]  Yeah, speaking of NASA, you know, NASA just published a paper in Kidney International, the leading kidney publication, showing that
[02:13:13.792 --> 02:13:30.978]  This stuff multiplies five times faster in weightlessness, and you can read this in the book, than it does in normal Earth gravity, and that may explain why astronauts suddenly get sick in space with kidney stones and calcification.
[02:13:31.279 --> 02:13:42.923]  They've never been able to figure out why these healthy astronauts go up there, get this stuff out of nowhere, and now this may explain it because these little nanoparticles have a much higher multiplication rate
[02:13:43.337 --> 02:13:43.978]  In weightlessness.
[02:13:44.078 --> 02:13:51.427]  And can I just add, Alex, that if anyone who wants to get the book and hear more about this, they can also call 800-497-0037.
[02:13:51.487 --> 02:13:51.648]  That's 497-0037.
[02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:59.611]  Or it's available at any of the major bookstores.
[02:13:59.791 --> 02:14:00.931]  I forgot to mention that earlier.
[02:14:01.231 --> 02:14:03.152]  And it's calcify.com?
[02:14:03.572 --> 02:14:07.573]  Yes, the website is www.calcify.com.
[02:14:07.593 --> 02:14:09.193]  It's C-A-L-C-I-F-Y.
[02:14:09.473 --> 02:14:15.315]  Before you leave us, we'll give that number out again so folks stay with us to the end of the broadcast and we'll give that number out again for you.
[02:14:15.335 --> 02:14:16.535]  You had one other question, Frank?
[02:14:16.975 --> 02:14:22.019]  Well, actually, what you just mentioned brings up another question concerning the, uh, called nanotechs.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:25.342]  Would you consider these prions, or bacteria, or virus?
[02:14:25.422 --> 02:14:27.364]  I mean, those... Ah, very interesting question.
[02:14:27.384 --> 02:14:28.325]  No, it's interesting.
[02:14:28.725 --> 02:14:31.968]  Well, nanobacteria appear to be a novel life form.
[02:14:31.988 --> 02:14:36.171]  They haven't been fully characterized, and scientists are fighting over them like crazy.
[02:14:36.271 --> 02:14:36.712]  Aren't they?
[02:14:36.772 --> 02:14:42.036]  But aren't they starting to classify them as, uh, as primitive precursors to single-cell organisms?
[02:14:42.556 --> 02:14:45.579]  You know, that's a very interesting point you brought up, Alex, because
[02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:47.560]  These things have butts.
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:55.429]  They butt off these 50 nanometer wide little creatures that they haven't quite figured out because they're too small.
[02:14:55.449 --> 02:14:58.493]  So it's like in between a virus and a bacteria?
[02:14:58.513 --> 02:15:02.077]  That's a very good description and it seems to be unique from them.
[02:15:03.718 --> 02:15:05.919]  Your caller, Frank, you were talking about prions.
[02:15:05.959 --> 02:15:07.459]  That again seems to be something different.
[02:15:07.659 --> 02:15:16.422]  The point is that there's a whole sub-microscopic world out there that is now being discovered that hasn't been found before.
[02:15:16.602 --> 02:15:19.463]  Frank, I gotta let you go, bro.
[02:15:19.803 --> 02:15:21.023]  We gotta get everybody else on here.
[02:15:21.423 --> 02:15:23.044]  James in Maryland.
[02:15:23.084 --> 02:15:23.784]  Go ahead, James.
[02:15:23.804 --> 02:15:25.244]  Hello, I'm calling.
[02:15:25.284 --> 02:15:31.646]  I have a calcium deposit on my eighth vertebrae that causes me a lot of pain at night.
[02:15:32.287 --> 02:15:38.432]  With a pinched nerve, and I was wondering if your product... It's not a product.
[02:15:38.612 --> 02:15:40.034]  Yeah, let me explain.
[02:15:40.054 --> 02:15:41.335]  First of all, I'm not a doctor.
[02:15:41.355 --> 02:15:42.235]  I'm a science journalist.
[02:15:42.315 --> 02:15:46.239]  We have documented the work of the physicians and scientists who worked on this.
[02:15:46.279 --> 02:15:47.079]  We've cataloged it.
[02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:48.601]  That's what the book is about.
[02:15:49.261 --> 02:15:50.582]  And that adds credibility.
[02:15:50.823 --> 02:15:52.404]  Plus, I've read these scientific studies.
[02:15:52.704 --> 02:15:54.065]  This has been out there for a while.
[02:15:54.325 --> 02:15:55.867]  He's not pitching you a product.
[02:15:55.887 --> 02:15:59.610]  Yeah, we're not connected with any companies that are selling this product, but I will tell you
[02:16:00.086 --> 02:16:06.590]  That there is a treatment out there that has been used for calcification and you can find out about it by going to some of the links on our website.
[02:16:06.630 --> 02:16:15.756]  We're not affiliated with the companies that are doing it but of course people ask about it so we have to provide that information and I would definitely find out about that.
[02:16:16.077 --> 02:16:21.160]  The clinical trials have not been done yet for calcification of the spine but what I can tell you
[02:16:21.784 --> 02:16:34.174]  Is that there has been anecdotal reports out of people who participated in the clinical trials that other calcification-related conditions such as cataracts, arthritis, on the spine have gone away at the same time.
[02:16:34.294 --> 02:16:37.116]  Yes, so the trials have been on the cardiovascular system.
[02:16:37.136 --> 02:16:42.781]  They've been on cardiovascular and prostate disease and then anecdotally some of the patients have remarked
[02:16:43.489 --> 02:16:44.570]  Okay.
[02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:49.252]  Does that answer your question, James?
[02:16:49.452 --> 02:16:50.033]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:50.053 --> 02:16:54.435]  Without a product to take, is it just reading the book and no one wants to buy it?
[02:16:54.475 --> 02:16:54.595]  No, no.
[02:16:54.635 --> 02:16:55.876]  There are products out there.
[02:16:55.916 --> 02:16:59.297]  There's a product called NanoBak and you can read about it.
[02:16:59.337 --> 02:17:02.639]  There's a company that produces it and it's available across the United States.
[02:17:02.987 --> 02:17:05.529]  And there's also a test for detecting it.
[02:17:05.849 --> 02:17:08.170]  The only thing I wanted to emphasize is we're not selling it.
[02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:09.571]  It's another company that's doing that.
[02:17:09.971 --> 02:17:12.693]  And you've also got to watch out with any new scientific development.
[02:17:12.713 --> 02:17:16.295]  A lot of quack groups show up and basically sell you talcum powder.
[02:17:16.475 --> 02:17:22.859]  Yeah, and that's why it's very important to make sure that you use the stuff that was tried in the clinical trial.
[02:17:23.359 --> 02:17:29.903]  And you can read more about the doctors who use that and you can reach them by looking at the links on our website.
[02:17:30.925 --> 02:17:31.506]  Absolutely.
[02:17:31.566 --> 02:17:35.052]  I mean, I could show up tomorrow and say, I've got mega decalcified.
[02:17:35.112 --> 02:17:37.196]  Yeah, and there's a problem with that.
[02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:41.864]  Yeah, and so it's important to look at the stuff that's been used in the clinical trials.
[02:17:42.004 --> 02:17:42.525]  We've got to break.
[02:17:45.504 --> 02:17:53.466]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:17:53.866 --> 02:17:55.086]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:17:55.326 --> 02:17:56.046]  Now check this out.
[02:17:56.366 --> 02:17:59.787]  The average American consumes 2-3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:18:00.107 --> 02:18:02.287]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[02:18:02.767 --> 02:18:05.448]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:18:05.688 --> 02:18:06.468]  Your health suffers.
[02:18:06.708 --> 02:18:07.288]  It's that simple.
[02:18:07.708 --> 02:18:09.469]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[02:18:09.649 --> 02:18:11.469]  With the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[02:18:12.089 --> 02:18:20.055]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[02:18:47.435 --> 02:18:52.037]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.358 --> 02:18:54.699]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:18:54.939 --> 02:18:56.480]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:01.923]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:19:02.243 --> 02:19:03.463]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:19:03.523 --> 02:19:06.225]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:19:45.171 --> 02:19:53.794]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:19:54.014 --> 02:20:05.277]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:20:05.497 --> 02:20:08.158]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:08.498 --> 02:20:12.599]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:20:12.799 --> 02:20:14.941]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:20:15.101 --> 02:20:16.983]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:20:17.183 --> 02:20:23.208]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:20:23.448 --> 02:20:29.053]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:20:34.115 --> 02:20:34.816]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.106 --> 02:20:49.933]  This is Jeff Donovan and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[02:20:50.013 --> 02:20:53.177]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[02:20:53.197 --> 02:20:53.998]  Her name was Joni.
[02:20:54.018 --> 02:20:57.864]  She already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days and she was so excited.
[02:20:57.884 --> 02:21:01.689]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[02:21:01.889 --> 02:21:06.574]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[02:21:06.654 --> 02:21:08.436]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[02:21:08.476 --> 02:21:11.418]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[02:21:11.478 --> 02:21:18.345]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry.
[02:21:18.365 --> 02:21:20.247]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[02:21:20.307 --> 02:21:21.228]  It's a great product.
[02:21:21.468 --> 02:21:24.090]  You're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:27.293]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[02:21:27.333 --> 02:21:28.734]  You don't pay anything up front.
[02:21:28.774 --> 02:21:33.777]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[02:21:33.797 --> 02:21:34.218]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:34.238 --> 02:21:34.318]  1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:34.338 --> 02:21:35.759]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[02:21:50.217 --> 02:21:52.138]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.598 --> 02:21:55.439]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:08.782 --> 02:22:10.663]  Alright, let's go straight back to your calls.
[02:22:11.583 --> 02:22:13.524]  Let's talk to Jack in New Jersey.
[02:22:13.584 --> 02:22:15.044]  Jack, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:22:15.544 --> 02:22:17.805]  Talking about advanced technologies, nanotech.
[02:22:19.802 --> 02:22:23.946]  Hey, I actually have a couple concerns about nanotechnology.
[02:22:24.726 --> 02:22:28.509]  Could it possibly be used as an instrument for control?
[02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:41.300]  I figure that it could be possible that certain nanotech particles which could be forcibly injected into people who might be, you know, like newborns or whatever.
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:46.304]  Well, you don't have to wait for that because, for example, right now
[02:22:47.254 --> 02:22:51.557]  And I just want to explain something about the link between nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.
[02:22:52.397 --> 02:23:04.284]  All of these computers that are being built now are being built with nanoscale technologies that are accelerating the capacity of artificially intelligent software, because the software needs all of the memory it can get.
[02:23:04.664 --> 02:23:12.129]  And so when you have these nanostructured memory chips, you can have much more powerful artificially intelligent systems that can recognize
[02:23:12.566 --> 02:23:25.315]  Patterns on their own and learn patterns by themselves and one of the ways that is being used for example in the UK and this was announced a new scientist just a few weeks ago is to do pattern recognition across wide
[02:23:26.552 --> 02:23:31.095]  database systems to locate matching criminals with the crime.
[02:23:31.335 --> 02:23:36.739]  Now, that is the nice use of it, but as we well know, there can also be some really nasty uses of it.
[02:23:36.939 --> 02:23:50.689]  Yeah, these algorithms, really what that is, is the Department of Pre-Crime, we look at all these psychological indicators, these purchases, your activities, and then claim the system shows that you're the guilty one.
[02:23:51.309 --> 02:23:52.050]  When we've caught these
[02:23:52.911 --> 02:24:04.827]  And Alex, I'm glad you used the term algorithm, because for people who don't know, the algorithm is really a fancy name for software that teaches itself based on trial and error.
[02:24:05.187 --> 02:24:08.031]  And the reason nanotechnology is so important to that is because
[02:24:08.399 --> 02:24:19.162]  The more you can accelerate that process of learning from trial and error, and you can perform trillions of operations per second, that's when you start to get a kind of intelligence that learns by itself.
[02:24:19.282 --> 02:24:24.423]  And that's why the link between nanotech and artificial intelligence is accelerating it.
[02:24:26.424 --> 02:24:33.626]  How long till we get a truly self-aware computer system that
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:49.032]  Well, you know, one of the guys that started working on this was Werner Wenge, who was actually giving one of his rare lectures at one of the upcoming Accelerating Change conferences in September of this year.
[02:24:49.212 --> 02:24:58.619]  And Wenge mentioned in the 1990s that he thought that within 30 years, a self-aware machine would be invented.
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:04.004]  And he said at that time, that is when the human era would really start to come to an end.
[02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:09.146]  Alright, Jack, anything else?
[02:25:09.746 --> 02:25:21.191]  Yeah, well, what I was actually talking more about was that, like, I understand that these nanites could, what I meant was by control, is that they could
[02:25:21.801 --> 02:25:42.375]  Let's say you're on parole, you're a prisoner, they inject these into you, they go and place themselves in the major arteries of the heart, and if you're not a good globalist, they just hit a button and you've already got an implant in you that activates those, and they chew through your heart in 24 hours.
[02:25:43.075 --> 02:25:43.895]  A death switch, yeah.
[02:25:44.155 --> 02:25:47.477]  Yeah, well, but, you know, that technology has also been around for a while.
[02:25:47.557 --> 02:25:58.761]  I think the more, the more interesting aspect to that is if you have these, and by the way, these self-replicating nanobots don't exist yet.
[02:25:58.841 --> 02:26:01.042]  That is the next step in nanotechnology.
[02:26:01.082 --> 02:26:08.165]  It's called molecular nanotechnology, and we haven't figured out quite how to do that yet, but we're getting very close.
[02:26:08.757 --> 02:26:13.704]  So, we're not talking about this happening... I thought they have made them replicate before?
[02:26:13.824 --> 02:26:15.747]  Well, self-replication...
[02:26:16.426 --> 02:26:22.250]  And molecular assembly, where they make bigger machines, are two different fish entirely.
[02:26:22.390 --> 02:26:26.772]  Well sure, they're not building and they're not controllable, but I mean, they've made them replicate.
[02:26:26.792 --> 02:26:37.079]  They've got self-replicating and they have so-called chemically self-assembling functions, but they haven't been able to use those to build machines from the bottom up yet.
[02:26:37.159 --> 02:26:41.581]  So we just don't want to... Well look, here's the problem, and thanks for the call, Jack.
[02:26:41.802 --> 02:26:42.362]  Good questions.
[02:26:43.467 --> 02:26:56.571]  Humans can already, except for the most, you know, tiny areas of specialities, or people that specialize in just very small areas, already we don't even know how we build these computers.
[02:26:56.611 --> 02:26:58.932]  We don't even know how a lot of this stuff works.
[02:26:59.232 --> 02:27:11.316]  And a lot of these computers are now already designing things like transistors and switches more efficiently than humans can, and those humans, the advanced technologists are saying,
[02:27:11.744 --> 02:27:14.145]  They haven't even figured out how those machines have done it.
[02:27:14.485 --> 02:27:17.366]  So those artificially intelligent systems are with us today.
[02:27:18.727 --> 02:27:22.728]  They're artificially intelligent, but they're not, uh... They're not self-aware.
[02:27:22.908 --> 02:27:23.889]  They're not self-aware.
[02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:26.330]  Alright, folks.
[02:27:27.050 --> 02:27:29.571]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[02:28:45.250 --> 02:28:48.274]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.575 --> 02:28:53.501]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.761 --> 02:28:58.124]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.404 --> 02:29:07.330]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:11.153]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.433 --> 02:29:16.476]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.776 --> 02:29:23.461]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:23.981 --> 02:29:24.622]  What about you?

[02:29:47.162 --> 02:29:52.645]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.066 --> 02:29:57.308]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.528 --> 02:30:04.572]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:04.953 --> 02:30:11.056]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.196 --> 02:30:12.417]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.757 --> 02:30:15.699]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.839 --> 02:30:17.861]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.181 --> 02:30:25.426]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:25.726 --> 02:30:29.109]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:43.856 --> 02:30:54.221]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.601 --> 02:30:57.763]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:03.689 --> 02:31:05.210]  All right, my friends, welcome back.
[02:31:05.410 --> 02:31:08.431]  It is Wednesday, the second day of March 2005.
[02:31:08.791 --> 02:31:10.011]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:31:11.952 --> 02:31:15.713]  And Jeremy and John and Frank and Brian and others, your calls are coming up for our guest.
[02:31:15.793 --> 02:31:24.296]  Before we go back to our guest, who is Douglas Mulhall, and the website, one of the websites is calcify.com.
[02:31:25.076 --> 02:31:29.957]  And he's really an expert on nanotechnology and run major scientific programs.
[02:31:30.378 --> 02:31:31.398]  He's also a journalist.
[02:31:32.163 --> 02:31:38.045]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the world concerning advanced technologies that are now here amongst us.
[02:31:38.105 --> 02:31:44.587]  I mean, it is 2005, and when we get back to him in a few minutes, I do want to talk about the end of the human species.
[02:31:44.627 --> 02:31:53.289]  This is what the elite are talking about, and this is what these artificially intelligent, self-aware machines could do.
[02:31:54.130 --> 02:31:59.014]  We're talking about this abomination, these different futurists we've had on, of forcibly merging us with it.
[02:31:59.054 --> 02:32:05.058]  Well, you've got to go along with the rest of society, and if we merge into the cyborgs, then you're going to have to do it.
[02:32:05.119 --> 02:32:07.901]  These are like people being funded by the government saying this.
[02:32:08.581 --> 02:32:11.343]  It's like Battlestar Galactica or something, you know?
[02:32:11.363 --> 02:32:13.645]  The Cylon Raiders are going to get us.
[02:32:14.446 --> 02:32:22.952]  But it's 2005, folks, and 2010 will be here when you blink your eyes, and 2020, and people that are young today, you're going to wake up 75 years old, and
[02:32:24.842 --> 02:32:31.044]  Either we're not going to be here, or we're going to be something completely different, and you talk about devilish systems, you talk about revelations.
[02:32:32.545 --> 02:32:35.086]  I mean, it's the real deal.
[02:32:35.866 --> 02:32:44.029]  Before we go back to our guest, my new film, the long-awaited, five months in the making, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:32:44.689 --> 02:32:48.310]  I had a little private screening last night, and everybody that saw it said it's really three films in one.
[02:32:49.133 --> 02:32:57.057]  The latest police state sound wave weapons, secret arrests, reporters being arrested, surveillance blimps inside the RNC when I was in New York.
[02:32:57.898 --> 02:33:06.602]  Then we get into the occult and the bohemian grove and the skull and bones and who controls all of this and we confront David Gergen and he blows up at me and the big White House advisor.
[02:33:07.423 --> 02:33:12.886]  And then we get into Arnold and the Nazi connections and how the elite's behind him and basically their master plan
[02:33:13.914 --> 02:33:15.215]  You've got to see the film.
[02:33:15.235 --> 02:33:16.916]  You've seen clips of it on the website.
[02:33:16.956 --> 02:33:18.457]  You've heard people talk about it.
[02:33:18.517 --> 02:33:21.138]  Believe me, this is my best work.
[02:33:21.218 --> 02:33:22.239]  I'm most professional.
[02:33:22.959 --> 02:33:36.027]  It is a tour de force, and it really takes you through the philosophy, the driving mindset of the elite, the world they're building, from the ground level up into the pinnacles of power in their ivory towers.
[02:33:36.127 --> 02:33:37.948]  You need to get martial law.
[02:33:39.511 --> 02:33:41.392]  Two hours, 35 minutes long.
[02:33:41.893 --> 02:33:42.753]  It's going to be up there.
[02:33:43.334 --> 02:33:44.915]  We'll start pre-orders tomorrow.
[02:33:45.135 --> 02:33:52.580]  We'll start mass-producing it on Friday, but you can start ordering hard copies of it tomorrow, and you'll be the first to get it when it mails out in about a week or two.
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.021]  Probably about a week and a half.
[02:33:55.102 --> 02:34:02.948]  But for people that are members of PrisonPlanet.TV, we will start uploading this sucker tomorrow, but it's two and a half hours long.
[02:34:04.125 --> 02:34:06.446]  It should be up Thursday night, if not Friday morning.
[02:34:06.866 --> 02:34:08.646]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:08.866 --> 02:34:10.607]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:34:11.627 --> 02:34:12.307]  15 cents a day.
[02:34:12.908 --> 02:34:14.728]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:15.208 --> 02:34:19.529]  Members will be the first to be able to see this in high bandwidth and low bandwidth.
[02:34:20.570 --> 02:34:21.950]  It is so important.
[02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:23.230]  I'm very proud of this film.
[02:34:23.791 --> 02:34:25.791]  And we're releasing it on the internet first.
[02:34:25.811 --> 02:34:28.372]  It's something that is revolutionary in and of itself.
[02:34:29.033 --> 02:34:30.634]  Because we know this is the wave of the future.
[02:34:30.714 --> 02:34:32.374]  The future is now here.
[02:34:32.895 --> 02:34:35.136]  It is the way of the future, as Howard Hughes would say.
[02:34:35.156 --> 02:34:41.298]  And please go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a monthly or yearly subscription.
[02:34:41.718 --> 02:34:43.839]  A monthly subscription is what?
[02:34:43.859 --> 02:34:43.839]  $4.95?
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:46.501]  And frankly, that just pays for the bandwidth.
[02:34:47.001 --> 02:34:48.721]  Our goal is to get the information out.
[02:34:49.002 --> 02:34:54.484]  And when you order your hard copy, which you won't be able to order until tomorrow, on the website and by the toll-free number,
[02:34:55.683 --> 02:35:01.028]  When you order your hard copy and you get it, please feel free to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:35:01.088 --> 02:35:15.382]  My goal is warning humanity to the totally criminally insane, decadent, mind-warped, power-tripping, sociopathic elite that has no business running our lives, running their own lives.
[02:35:15.402 --> 02:35:18.565]  They should all be institutionalized as complete psychopaths.
[02:35:19.285 --> 02:35:22.846]  And literally, the nuts running the asylum is what we're talking about.
[02:35:23.326 --> 02:35:27.567]  Running all this nanotech, controlling it all, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:35:27.607 --> 02:35:30.688]  So, toll-free number to get my films or other films I carry, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:30.728 --> 02:35:31.448]  Going back to Douglas,
[02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:45.414]  And again, before he leaves us, we'll give you the toll-free number and the web address to get his fine books and material.
[02:35:45.854 --> 02:35:46.675]  Very impressive.
[02:35:46.755 --> 02:35:47.795]  I've researched this stuff.
[02:35:48.236 --> 02:35:50.698]  He is really spot-on and a pioneer.
[02:35:51.358 --> 02:35:53.520]  A futurist, I would bill him as.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:03.047]  But before we go back to these calls, I want to understand this from your unique view, from your studies of this.
[02:36:04.048 --> 02:36:08.672]  You talk about, and a lot of top futurists and scientists talk about, Earth becoming a
[02:36:10.949 --> 02:36:17.212]  point one society that we haven't even reached point one that is being able to get off the planet surviving as a species.
[02:36:17.232 --> 02:36:17.532]  Right.
[02:36:17.712 --> 02:36:19.993]  And then yeah, I see it really stacked against us.
[02:36:20.114 --> 02:36:28.618]  I see our own creations and humans using these dangerous creations to dominate other humans.
[02:36:29.138 --> 02:36:36.601]  It's guaranteed to get out of control and we're guaranteed to see really the end of our species and some say this is a beautiful thing.
[02:36:36.862 --> 02:36:37.962]  No, I say this is horrible.
[02:36:40.655 --> 02:36:48.156]  Alex, you know, I think someone once said that technology is a continuation of evolution by other means.
[02:36:49.177 --> 02:37:04.820]  And I think that's a very profound statement because a lot of people have heard about a guy by the name of Stephen Jay Gould, who is a very well-known anthropologist who got himself into a lot of trouble and became notorious for the theory of something known as punctuated equilibrium.
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:07.380]  And punctuated equilibrium basically states
[02:37:08.035 --> 02:37:23.900]  That evolution does not occur in a nice, slow, gradual slope, as most anthropologists would have us believe, but in fact, occurs with long periods where not much happens, and then suddenly, in very, very short periods, violent, explosive change!
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:29.142]  Enormous spurts, and they are the things that dictate the direction of evolution.
[02:37:29.702 --> 02:37:37.025]  Furthermore, what Stephen Jay Gould and a number of other nanotechnologists have said is that
[02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:41.912]  We are the next punctuated equilibrium.
[02:37:41.953 --> 02:37:49.797]  That is to say, that humans, rather than the other things that we see as nature, are going to be the thing.
[02:37:49.837 --> 02:37:55.941]  So instead of having, for example, a comet hit the earth and wipe out the dinosaurs and allow other more adapted species to come along,
[02:37:56.664 --> 02:38:06.708]  We as humans are creating an explosive situation on the planet that will lead to wholesale destruction and rebirth.
[02:38:06.808 --> 02:38:12.770]  That is a very strong theme that we see going through this.
[02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:14.230]  And the greatest minds agree on that.
[02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:15.471]  Now I want to bring something in here.
[02:38:16.571 --> 02:38:18.192]  I have had spiritual experiences.
[02:38:18.412 --> 02:38:20.092]  I know that God is real.
[02:38:20.773 --> 02:38:21.073]  I know
[02:38:21.883 --> 02:38:23.084]  That that is a reality.
[02:38:23.825 --> 02:38:28.350]  And when you look at the science, that's where the creationists come in.
[02:38:28.390 --> 02:38:31.433]  They say, no, the real evidence shows explosive change.
[02:38:31.954 --> 02:38:33.956]  So I never saw the argument.
[02:38:34.216 --> 02:38:40.142]  I argued with the evolutionists and the Darwin people for saying it happens over millions of years.
[02:38:40.242 --> 02:38:42.465]  When who was to say how God designed things?
[02:38:42.605 --> 02:38:44.387]  Look at this ultimate nanotech.
[02:38:45.508 --> 02:38:49.951]  That, you know, is light years ahead of what we've got today, you know, God's system.
[02:38:50.252 --> 02:38:59.660]  And so I saw this as the scientist setting up a fake debate to try to discredit religion in general, and especially Christianity.
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:01.081]  I never saw the argument.
[02:39:02.702 --> 02:39:13.031]  Well, you know, it's... I think the one thing that we want to bring across in our books, the message that we want to bring to people, is that whatever is going on
[02:39:13.547 --> 02:39:19.073]  It is happening a lot faster than people would like to think.
[02:39:19.213 --> 02:39:24.498]  And we've got to wake up and smell the coffee so that we can learn to adapt to it before it adapts to us.
[02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:29.411]  And that, I think, is the most important message that people can get here today.
[02:39:30.072 --> 02:39:33.433]  Because, you know, there's two sides to this whole nanotechnology thing.
[02:39:33.453 --> 02:39:43.276]  On one side, a lot of the nanotechnology associations are saying, well, you know, we don't want people to get all excited about the hype about nanotechnology when it ends up being a dot-com bust.
[02:39:43.857 --> 02:39:44.777]  But on the other side,
[02:39:45.462 --> 02:39:51.484]  Unlike the dot-com bust, these technologies are coming into the marketplace now.
[02:39:51.505 --> 02:39:52.305]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:39:52.445 --> 02:39:56.246]  I mean, people that try to say that, I mean, that's a complete fraud.
[02:39:56.507 --> 02:39:58.988]  They're already, as you said, bringing this to market.
[02:39:59.328 --> 02:40:00.188]  This is real.
[02:40:00.268 --> 02:40:04.390]  This is just controlling the nature of matter at a subatomic level.
[02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:14.934]  Yeah, and you've got this kind of schizophrenia, where on one hand people are paranoid about everyone jumping on the bandwagon and hyping this whole thing up, but on the other hand, unlike
[02:40:15.345 --> 02:40:19.486]  The other boom and bust... Well, the elites are doing that because they want to buy it up.
[02:40:19.506 --> 02:40:20.746]  They don't want us having a piece of it.
[02:40:21.186 --> 02:40:27.608]  Well, I tell you, there's a huge amount of investment going into this, and I'm glad you brought that up, because that brings us back to what we talked about at the top of the show.
[02:40:28.208 --> 02:40:30.548]  This stuff is breaking out everywhere.
[02:40:30.628 --> 02:40:37.770]  For example, one of the leading nanobiology organizations in the world is located in... Singapore!
[02:40:38.490 --> 02:40:39.570]  And the Singaporeans
[02:40:40.043 --> 02:40:50.196]  And their Prime Minister have been aggressively coming to the United States recruiting scientists to do work that they can't get funded for here in the US, setting them up with enormous labs in Singapore.
[02:40:50.536 --> 02:40:51.037]  Believe me!
[02:40:51.616 --> 02:40:54.677]  This is not just happening in the United States.
[02:40:54.817 --> 02:40:57.578]  Well, the dot-com, I mean, the internet is taking over.
[02:40:57.638 --> 02:40:59.318]  It's shifted the business model.
[02:40:59.398 --> 02:41:00.678]  It's great for the individual.
[02:41:01.379 --> 02:41:03.699]  It's really hurting the existing power structures.
[02:41:04.179 --> 02:41:12.061]  I mean, the so-called dot-com bust was just the stock scam bubbles popping, and a lot of scammers out there that weren't doing real things.
[02:41:12.461 --> 02:41:18.563]  And what's really interesting is that you're seeing countries, small countries, this is really going to level the playing field for small countries.
[02:41:18.903 --> 02:41:26.491]  Because you've got countries like Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia... Well, that's why they can't have so-called rogue nations.
[02:41:26.531 --> 02:41:36.581]  That's why Thomas Barnett at the Pentagon talks about the gap and going into all these countries and taking them over because the elite cannot allow them to be stand-alone because they will develop this stuff.
[02:41:36.862 --> 02:41:40.105]  Yeah, and of course the problem is that, as I spoke earlier about,
[02:41:40.878 --> 02:41:50.703]  It's not just nation states that can do this, but it's a very innovative small group of chemists or nanotechnologists who really know what they're doing, so taking over all these countries isn't really going to help.
[02:41:50.723 --> 02:41:51.464]  Let me ask you one more question.
[02:41:52.044 --> 02:42:00.889]  We need to go to these calls, but these top futurists, top scientists, people with 200 IQs, giant eggheads, are basically saying it's over for us.
[02:42:01.389 --> 02:42:06.832]  Why are we allowing, why capitulate to this?
[02:42:06.912 --> 02:42:08.453]  We should control this,
[02:42:09.654 --> 02:42:11.675]  And then they say, okay, global government.
[02:42:11.835 --> 02:42:19.962]  But the people running the global government are, again, a bunch of inbred, spoiled, rotten, death-loving, out-of-control sickos.
[02:42:20.382 --> 02:42:27.448]  Well, you know, there still is a huge argument going on amongst this technological elite as to which way it's going to go.
[02:42:27.488 --> 02:42:32.552]  In other words, the situation is still fluid, and that's important for people to understand.
[02:42:32.912 --> 02:42:34.033]  There is not agreement.
[02:42:34.113 --> 02:42:34.714]  For example,
[02:42:35.157 --> 02:42:41.012]  You got Ray Kurzweil arguing with Bill Joy, two of the highest level technicians who have been working on this.
[02:42:41.525 --> 02:42:47.230]  And Bill Joy's saying, this stuff is so dangerous that we may have to consider simply not going ahead with some of these technologies.
[02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:51.654]  And Kurtzweil's saying, too late, genie's out of the bottle, we gotta learn how to live with it.
[02:42:51.774 --> 02:43:09.789]  Well, Pandora's box is open, and of course Bill Joy, co-owner of Sun Microsystems, multi-billionaire, wrote, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, and he said, I've been at the meetings where the elite talks about exterminating 80% of us, and that goes back to redefining work,
[02:43:10.784 --> 02:43:13.126]  What are people going to do?
[02:43:13.246 --> 02:43:16.849]  And literally, on purpose, they've dumbed us down.
[02:43:16.889 --> 02:43:23.874]  You've got like this mindless class of barbarians controlled by a tiny technocracy of technocrats.
[02:43:24.354 --> 02:43:27.457]  And I get back to that technological Mount Olympus, the elite.
[02:43:27.697 --> 02:43:29.318]  That's why they're so arrogant right now.
[02:43:29.818 --> 02:43:34.022]  Yeah, and you know, the thing is that nanotechnology can really free the individual.
[02:43:34.102 --> 02:43:37.144]  I mean, that's one of the tremendous things about it.
[02:43:37.725 --> 02:43:39.966]  If we let it go... No, no, it's decentralized.
[02:43:39.986 --> 02:43:57.412]  It'll allow, you know, all these factories with all these new ideas, with a million factories, with a million owners, creating all these new incredible products and ideas, and, you know, space elevators, and, you know, huge spacecraft, you know, where you put the nanotech factory in space and build it there.
[02:43:57.572 --> 02:43:58.812]  Perhaps that should be it.
[02:43:59.012 --> 02:44:01.973]  Perhaps we should have laws that this stuff can only go on in space.
[02:44:02.373 --> 02:44:04.194]  Then that will encourage exploration.
[02:44:04.884 --> 02:44:10.866]  Well, I think that's a great idea, because you look at the mess that we have with the space program right now, it's about time we got back out there.
[02:44:12.026 --> 02:44:13.307]  That's for sure.
[02:44:13.747 --> 02:44:24.210]  But then you get into the argument of how to have a law that people follow, that you can only do these... and then you're going to have space criminals who bring the technologies back down to the planet.
[02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:30.252]  Well, yeah, but you know something, and this is one of the things that we argue in this book, Our Molecular Future,
[02:44:31.693 --> 02:44:48.833]  You know, we're at risk from nature as well, and one of these days we're going to get smacked by another asteroid or comet, and what we really want to be in the situation of having is a fallback plan, like maybe being on Mars, so that at least we can give ourselves a bit of a chance of surviving a natural event like that.
[02:44:49.201 --> 02:44:53.244]  And that's where these nanotechnologies might really come in and help us.
[02:44:53.504 --> 02:44:56.245]  Now you're talking about the space colonies.
[02:44:56.946 --> 02:44:59.347]  And that's what we need to do.
[02:44:59.387 --> 02:45:04.510]  And look, the technologies we see today, I mean, you've got to know, Douglas, they're 30 years behind.
[02:45:04.530 --> 02:45:08.433]  I mean, the government's got a lot of secret stuff they're not telling us about.
[02:45:08.533 --> 02:45:12.976]  Well, I mean, the space program is definitely not using all of the capabilities that it can.
[02:45:12.996 --> 02:45:14.917]  We're suffering from a lack of leadership there.
[02:45:15.453 --> 02:45:26.161]  It's a big disappointment in a lot of ways, especially with all of these new, cheap, very highly sophisticated technologies that could be used to, you know, get us onto the moon.
[02:45:26.181 --> 02:45:29.624]  We've got private people with 10 million bucks going to space!
[02:45:30.544 --> 02:45:31.485]  Exactly!
[02:45:31.505 --> 02:45:32.906]  Exactly!
[02:45:32.926 --> 02:45:34.607]  And let's support them!
[02:45:34.687 --> 02:45:35.188]  Yay!
[02:45:36.189 --> 02:45:37.129]  It's about time!
[02:45:37.710 --> 02:45:39.371]  And the reason that they're able to do that
[02:45:39.821 --> 02:45:45.984]  And by the way, not to trash the space program too much, because a lot of these technologies came out of the space program, they just didn't use them!
[02:45:46.644 --> 02:45:58.830]  Well, I'm here to tell you, I've studied it, Douglas, and you're a really intelligent, great guy, but I'm here to tell you, the elite are, I'm telling you, they are just a bunch of spoiled, multi-generational brats.
[02:46:00.191 --> 02:46:04.293]  They have no real vision, and they are going to screw everything up.
[02:46:04.953 --> 02:46:09.895]  Well, let's hope that the nature of the technology itself can help prevent a lot of that, Alex.
[02:46:09.955 --> 02:46:18.157]  That's one of the great hopes that we have, and that's one of the reasons that we wrote these two books, was to give examples of how these technologies empower the individual.
[02:46:18.177 --> 02:46:19.238]  We're going to plug those coming up.
[02:46:19.318 --> 02:46:20.218]  I've gone way over.
[02:46:20.258 --> 02:46:21.299]  I've got to get to these calls.
[02:46:21.879 --> 02:46:23.059]  Jeremy in Florida, quickly.
[02:46:23.099 --> 02:46:24.420]  Jeremy, quick question or comment.
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.361]  Yeah, I was just wondering, with the nanotechnology,
[02:46:29.375 --> 02:46:35.503]  How close we are to Optic Camouflage Reflective Refractive Light Camouflage?
[02:46:35.543 --> 02:46:36.564]  It's already here.
[02:46:36.804 --> 02:46:38.226]  That was in Japan five years ago.
[02:46:38.367 --> 02:46:41.230]  Yes, they already have Optic Chemical Camouflage.
[02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:46.097]  And by the way, another little thing they have is something called Smart Dust that has been developed by DARPA.
[02:46:47.021 --> 02:46:49.782]  The next generation in RFID.
[02:46:50.202 --> 02:46:50.682]  Exactly.
[02:46:50.702 --> 02:46:54.403]  It's a camera sensor that is used for environmental sensing.
[02:46:54.543 --> 02:46:55.663]  It can float on air.
[02:46:56.444 --> 02:47:01.345]  But for those that don't know what this optic camouflage is, you've seen the movie The Predator, folks?
[02:47:02.685 --> 02:47:03.525]  Where you're invisible?
[02:47:03.925 --> 02:47:04.125]  Okay.
[02:47:05.546 --> 02:47:06.066]  Thanks.
[02:47:06.126 --> 02:47:07.186]  Anything else, Jeremy, quickly?
[02:47:08.247 --> 02:47:09.247]  No, no, that's about it.
[02:47:09.267 --> 02:47:10.187]  Alright, great question.
[02:47:10.347 --> 02:47:11.727]  I apologize for going so quick.
[02:47:12.007 --> 02:47:13.368]  John in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:47:13.428 --> 02:47:13.788]  Go ahead.
[02:47:15.427 --> 02:47:15.687]  Hello?
[02:47:15.908 --> 02:47:16.568]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:16.628 --> 02:47:18.731]  Thank you, first off, very much, for what you do.
[02:47:19.051 --> 02:47:19.532]  It's great.
[02:47:20.673 --> 02:47:21.073]  Where can I...
[02:47:22.734 --> 02:47:24.715]  Learn more about this nanotechnology.
[02:47:24.735 --> 02:47:28.018]  I mean this is all really complicated, really far out there.
[02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:33.462]  That's one of the reasons we wrote these two books, because these books are for general audiences.
[02:47:33.842 --> 02:47:38.225]  Type nanotech into Google and you'll get all the big scientific reports.
[02:47:39.106 --> 02:47:46.071]  But if you go to ourmolecularfuture.com you can see that and the link to the book and also calcify.com.
[02:47:46.091 --> 02:47:47.652]  Those are the two websites and
[02:47:48.112 --> 02:47:53.136]  Get both the books, because we wrote them exactly for general audiences who want to understand this stuff.
[02:47:53.196 --> 02:47:53.576]  Okay.
[02:47:53.877 --> 02:47:54.757]  Anything else, John?
[02:47:55.438 --> 02:47:56.999]  Yeah, actually, I had a question.
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:02.323]  What do you think I... Actually, I'll call you back on a different day and ask you that.
[02:48:02.363 --> 02:48:03.224]  No, you can ask the question.
[02:48:03.244 --> 02:48:04.044]  We've got 40 seconds.
[02:48:04.064 --> 02:48:04.385]  Go ahead.
[02:48:04.405 --> 02:48:04.645]  Alright.
[02:48:04.905 --> 02:48:10.949]  I want to know if, like, the subliminal messages and things that the government's putting in our head,
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.484]  The short-term memory loss caused by marijuana could be one of the reasons that they don't want it legalized.
[02:48:20.265 --> 02:48:21.486]  No.
[02:48:22.347 --> 02:48:23.588]  Prohibition had ended.
[02:48:24.288 --> 02:48:26.830]  They needed something for all their federal police to do.
[02:48:26.850 --> 02:48:30.652]  So they demonized marijuana as something new to go after.
[02:48:30.672 --> 02:48:31.853]  And it's a business.
[02:48:31.913 --> 02:48:37.937]  It's an excuse to put your children in their private prisons building things for 20 cents an hour.
[02:48:38.897 --> 02:48:39.638]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:39.858 --> 02:48:40.519]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:41.059 --> 02:48:44.643]  That's why marijuana's illegal.
[02:48:45.664 --> 02:48:49.889]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.189 --> 02:48:54.634]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.774 --> 02:48:59.159]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.199 --> 02:49:00.521]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.442 --> 02:49:02.203]  Animersion.
[02:49:02.303 --> 02:49:06.529]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:13.540]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.663]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.084 --> 02:49:26.489]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.649 --> 02:49:32.012]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.552 --> 02:49:36.434]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:45.834 --> 02:49:48.838]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.178 --> 02:49:57.988]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.329 --> 02:50:02.994]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.454 --> 02:50:10.181]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.581 --> 02:50:22.272]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.832 --> 02:50:27.294]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.454 --> 02:50:29.914]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:29.935 --> 02:50:31.775]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:31.795 --> 02:50:32.996]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.056 --> 02:50:34.516]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:34.536 --> 02:50:35.596]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:49.008 --> 02:51:56.456]  Look at how beautiful the forest and the ocean and the mountains and all the different creatures are.
[02:51:57.177 --> 02:52:01.842]  All of it threatened by this technology that is not evil itself, but is a double-edged sword.
[02:52:03.443 --> 02:52:12.392]  It's always been wonderful to be on so many stations and all the listeners are so important to me in Colorado and California and Texas and all over the country.
[02:52:12.872 --> 02:52:17.676]  I just wanted to say that it's a real blessing to be your host and to have you out there listening.
[02:52:17.716 --> 02:52:23.582]  I want to thank the stations that have carried this broadcast over the years and all the new stations that are picking it up as well.
[02:52:24.002 --> 02:52:26.625]  I want to jam two final calls, Frank and Brian, in.
[02:52:27.525 --> 02:52:37.428]  Here, sorry to all the other callers, but Douglas Mulhall, please plug your website and phone number one more time.
[02:52:37.448 --> 02:52:53.753]  The phone number is 800-497-0037, that's 497-0037, and the website is www.calcify.com, that's C-A-L-C-I-F-Y, and the name of the book is The Calcium Bomb, and the earlier book is Our Molecular Future.
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:58.603]  Alright, we've got links for that on InfoWars.com, boys and girls.
[02:52:59.044 --> 02:53:00.805]  Frank in Louisiana, go ahead, sir.
[02:53:01.286 --> 02:53:02.987]  Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:53:03.027 --> 02:53:12.495]  Very quickly, I have a cataract, which they're talking about putting a lens in there, and I just turned it on when you were talking about the
[02:53:13.331 --> 02:53:14.752]  Cataracts being calcium.
[02:53:14.792 --> 02:53:28.520]  Right, so quickly, calcification is involved in cataracts and there have been anecdotal reports in the clinical trials that some cataracts have resolved on their own when people are treated for calcification in heart disease.
[02:53:28.861 --> 02:53:30.822]  Read the book, The Calcium Bomb.
[02:53:31.162 --> 02:53:32.523]  Talk to your physician about it.
[02:53:32.603 --> 02:53:33.764]  Get him to find out about this.
[02:53:34.324 --> 02:53:38.987]  Okay, and lastly, I have to echo what y'all were saying that
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:51.305]  Anytime I hear of advanced technology, I know that the ruling elite, these banking families, are going to try to get their hands on it because we fight the bankers' wars and they control our government.
[02:53:51.325 --> 02:53:55.327]  That's what scares me about modern technology so much, is I know who's going to get their hands on it.
[02:53:55.727 --> 02:53:58.948]  Well, by 2010, half the Air Force is going to be robotic.
[02:53:59.369 --> 02:54:04.351]  They're going to spend, what is it, like $76 billion on ground-fighting robots.
[02:54:05.311 --> 02:54:10.234]  Alex, the banking system is already using artificial intelligence for stock trading.
[02:54:10.714 --> 02:54:12.735]  Yeah, and to run their scams, I know.
[02:54:13.315 --> 02:54:14.516]  All right, Frank, good points.
[02:54:14.596 --> 02:54:16.977]  Brian in Texas, go ahead, last caller, welcome.
[02:54:18.078 --> 02:54:18.898]  Yeah, hi, how's it going?
[02:54:19.818 --> 02:54:26.162]  I was always under the impression that the oil giants like Shell and others already own the patents for the new technology.
[02:54:26.442 --> 02:54:27.022]  No, they don't.
[02:54:27.222 --> 02:54:28.823]  Well, there's always new technology.
[02:54:29.043 --> 02:54:32.485]  They don't own anywhere near any of it, and the patents aren't going to matter anymore.
[02:54:32.913 --> 02:54:40.595]  Alex and I on some other show are going to talk about the collapse of the patent regime, with the overload on all of this stuff, and they don't control it right now.
[02:54:40.615 --> 02:54:47.518]  Hey look, you've got scientists at the computer companies that don't know how the computer works, it's so advanced, how is the patent office going to certify it?
[02:54:47.958 --> 02:54:48.798]  Exactly!
[02:54:48.958 --> 02:54:49.678]  Good point!
[02:54:49.978 --> 02:54:53.879]  The problem is the patent office doesn't have the expertise to assess this stuff.
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:55:01.882]  And so the whole basis of American and European technological superiority is being overwhelmed by these high-tech applications.
[02:55:03.308 --> 02:55:04.449]  Alright, and one last thing.
[02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:05.750]  What's preventing these U.S.
[02:55:05.830 --> 02:55:08.452]  labs from conducting the type of research that's needed?
[02:55:08.512 --> 02:55:10.895]  I know you're talking about rogue nations doing what we can't do.
[02:55:10.915 --> 02:55:11.175]  No, no, no.
[02:55:11.235 --> 02:55:12.536]  It's going on in Austin.
[02:55:12.576 --> 02:55:13.797]  It's going on in California.
[02:55:13.817 --> 02:55:15.058]  And it's going on in Maryland.
[02:55:15.398 --> 02:55:16.359]  It's going on here.
[02:55:16.399 --> 02:55:19.582]  What he's saying is that other countries are accelerating it.
[02:55:19.662 --> 02:55:20.643]  Is that correct, Douglas?
[02:55:20.683 --> 02:55:22.404]  It's breaking out all over the place.
[02:55:22.545 --> 02:55:28.029]  Every major university in every major country in the world has done nanotech research.
[02:55:28.410 --> 02:55:29.931]  So that's the race you're talking about.
[02:55:31.005 --> 02:55:35.510]  It's amazing how broadly it is breaking out.
[02:55:35.570 --> 02:55:39.614]  We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of universities working on this.
[02:55:40.635 --> 02:55:41.376]  All around the world.
[02:55:41.396 --> 02:55:43.938]  Thanks, Brian.
[02:55:44.018 --> 02:55:46.121]  We'll see you on the other side tonight.
[02:55:47.245 --> 02:55:48.666]  Tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:55:49.106 --> 02:55:50.307]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:51.167 --> 02:55:54.649]  Douglas Mulhall has been my guest, and I really want to thank you for coming on.
[02:55:54.669 --> 02:55:55.129]  Take care.
[02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:57.111]  I really look forward to having you back on.
[02:55:57.411 --> 02:55:59.072]  Alex, it's been great, and I really enjoyed it.
[02:55:59.272 --> 02:56:03.914]  And I'd like to have your scientist colleague on, the co-author of the nanotech book.
[02:56:03.954 --> 02:56:05.015]  Perhaps I could have you both on.
[02:56:05.295 --> 02:56:06.016]  That sounds great.
[02:56:06.056 --> 02:56:06.536]  Let's do it.
[02:56:06.856 --> 02:56:07.196]  All right.
[02:56:07.216 --> 02:56:08.617]  Biocondios.
[02:56:08.897 --> 02:56:09.337]  Take care.
[02:56:09.357 --> 02:56:10.078]  All right.
[02:56:10.138 --> 02:56:11.899]  Very interesting discussion.
[02:56:12.734 --> 02:56:14.996]  A lot of other news and information we didn't get to today.
[02:56:15.056 --> 02:56:19.060]  It's oninfowars.com and prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:29.869]  And again, to all those affiliates out there, to all of you that listen, to the sponsors, to everybody that I've gotten a chance to know, I want to say, uh, thanks!
[02:56:30.570 --> 02:56:31.771]  Alright, take care!
