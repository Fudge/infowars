[00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:06.444]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:08.165]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:09.986]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:11.447]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:13.168]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:17.431]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.033]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:44.557]  Alright folks, welcome.
[00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.318]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:54.800]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're going to be live for the next three hours here today.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.641]  I tell you, so much has happened.
[00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.882]  So many things are going on, but I just realized today
[00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:15.039]  I just realized, in a flash, that we're only 300 million people in the United States, but we're seen as the top of the mark.
[00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.461]  We're seen as as good as it gets.
[00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.382]  We set the standards.
[00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:31.489]  And the globalists, when they have our police dressed up in black uniforms and black masks, searching everyone, checking IDs, that's broadcast all over the world.
[00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.190]  That's seen by
[00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:39.612]  Four or five billion people who have access to televisions on a regular basis.
[00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.475]  Really, it's more than four million people.
[00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:51.521]  And so more than just this whole police state being about suppressing the American people, which it is, of course, it's also about
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:04.966]  Conditioning the world, training the world, brainwashing the world to accept a new world order, to accept total tyranny, to accept this control grid.
[00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:08.108]  It's simple.
[00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.390]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:19.834]  And, I mean, just ten years ago, China would get in trouble when it would just massively abuse people in public.
[00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:22.839]  The Russians would get in trouble.
[00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.520]  People in Africa would get in trouble.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.781]  It was a big deal.
[00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:31.804]  And now, yeah, we torture, and yeah, we're taking everybody's rights, and yeah, we kill somebody every day with a taser.
[00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.807]  And yeah, we're setting up a total control grid.
[00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:39.427]  But so what?
[00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:44.530]  And so that's being used globally as nations across the board
[00:02:45.738 --> 00:02:55.561]  Follow suit, and buy the control systems, the tracking systems from the very same military industrial complex that controls America.
[00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:59.062]  So we've become a very, very bad role model in many ways.
[00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:01.223]  And that's by design.
[00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:07.965]  Another little tidbit, I got an email here going, I thought you were great, you piece of scum, but you're like Michael Moore.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.082]  You're like Michael Moore who criticizes the war but then owns Halliburton stock and defense stocks.
[00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.662]  Well, I don't own any Halliburton or defense stocks, okay?
[00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:18.743]  I don't own any stocks.
[00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:29.766]  But what the person was talking about was some little $100 a month ad on our website to a self-defense website that sells, amongst other things, tasers.
[00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:31.646]  I think tasers are great!
[00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.107]  I think guns are great!
[00:03:35.107 --> 00:03:36.367]  I think army tanks are great!
[00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:38.128]  I think jet fighters are great!
[00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.373]  If you've got a good people in control of a nation, choose for defense.
[00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:45.135]  I think it's fine that police have tasers.
[00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:54.422]  It's just that they should get in deep trouble for using them if somebody backtalks them or doesn't get out of their car quick enough or, you know, if they shoot somebody five times with it and they die.
[00:03:55.174 --> 00:03:56.535]  It's being way overused.
[00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:58.276]  The way it's been implemented is bad.
[00:03:58.316 --> 00:03:59.297]  I've said that over and over again.
[00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:04.341]  So don't confuse my website with your anti-weapon views.
[00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.702]  Somebody's always going to have weapons.
[00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:08.884]  And so a weapon is an inanimate object.
[00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:16.729]  And I think for people that are afraid of guns, because they're brainwashed, or people that are... I think it's great for women who don't want to have a gun.
[00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.651]  It's not as good as a gun.
[00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.413]  It's not as reliable, but it does pack a punch.
[00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.014]  And I think women
[00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:31.174]  You know, cops are moving to ban Americans, what do they call us, civilians in military terminology, from being able to have these.
[00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:37.739]  So, I don't know, I'm going to cover that too.
[00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:42.283]  I've got a bunch of news here and some interesting guests coming up today.
[00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.267]  So we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:50.550]  The website's rinfoawards.com, infoawards.net, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:05.427]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:07.249]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:12.273]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.614 --> 00:05:19.360]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.641]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:24.702]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:29.444]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:34.047]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:41.510]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.191]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:04.287]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:07.389]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:11.812]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.252 --> 00:06:13.073]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:17.976]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.457 --> 00:06:20.578]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.078 --> 00:06:21.919]  Sheltering in place.
[00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:35.748]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:42.934]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.253]  Government is death which governs me.
[00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:06.096]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:09.260]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.344]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:19.234]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.531]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.051]  Have you?
[00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.132]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:52.336]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:53.857]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:07:54.417 --> 00:07:55.598]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.680]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:08.506]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:12.148]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.214 --> 00:08:23.837]  Okay, folks, it is Wednesday, 30th day of November 2005.
[00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:26.979]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.463]  Every day we're treated to Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Lieberman,
[00:08:32.538 --> 00:08:47.723]  Just countless other creatures, Schumer and others, telling us how George Bush is a wondrous god-like creature and we must stay the course in Iraq and this war is just absolutely wonderful and good and wholesome.
[00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:52.985]  And then meanwhile we have all the neocons on the radio saying it's evil liberals politicizing all this.
[00:08:53.045 --> 00:09:00.207]  No, they all voted for it, they all attacked Serbia, they're all owned by the exact same interest and it's just a complete and total fraud.
[00:09:01.534 --> 00:09:06.298]  And I guarantee you, if Democrats were in office right now, the Democrats, most of them, would love this attack on Iraq.
[00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:07.619]  They'd love it.
[00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.461]  They loved the first war.
[00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:13.184]  They loved Clinton's bombings and ongoing siege and genocide.
[00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:14.165]  And they're going to love this.
[00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:17.027]  That's just the way it is.
[00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:19.789]  That's how the cookie crumbles.
[00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.614]  Because they totally have their thinking processes switched off by the false left-right paradigm.
[00:09:27.636 --> 00:09:28.176]  It's that simple.
[00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:39.240]  Unfortunately, until we wake up to that, things are just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:49.444]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson and myself have put together this little article, Miami Model ACLU shysters stab America in the back again.
[00:09:50.413 --> 00:10:05.821]  In response to the news that Miami police were going to conduct random sieges and checks of IDs and patrols of buses and trains, the ACLU stabbed America in the back again by shrugging their shoulders and stating that the new measures did not violate anybody's rights.
[00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:12.985]  What we're dealing with is officers on street patrol, which is more effective and consistent with the Constitution.
[00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:16.686]  And you read what the police chief and others say they're going to do.
[00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:20.048]  They're going to surround buildings and search everyone and check IDs.
[00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:20.988]  Randomly.
[00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:26.471]  We have to see how this is implemented, said Howard Simon, Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida.
[00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:35.995]  Consistent with the Constitution, a total violation of the Fourth Amendment, this is the most clear violation of what it means to live in a free society that you're ever going to see short of what
[00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:44.017]  When they cart us all off to those cozy ex-Soviet gulag camps, which they're now operating.
[00:10:44.617 --> 00:10:51.683]  The Miami model is akin to the police looking for a man driving a red Volkswagen in the entire western United States.
[00:10:52.224 --> 00:11:02.112]  They decide to raid a bank building in Albuquerque because the felon just might happen to be in that one building out of a list of hundreds of thousands.
[00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:03.753]  Really, it's millions of targets.
[00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:10.121]  It makes absolutely no sense unless it is designed to scare people into groveling to the overlords in black ski masks.
[00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:13.803]  And they actually say on there, we don't want to intimidate you, but we do want you to be aware.
[00:11:14.283 --> 00:11:15.304]  It is about intimidation.
[00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.705]  Letting us know who the bosses are.
[00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:22.107]  And really, this makes it pale in significance.
[00:11:22.127 --> 00:11:23.348]  You know, this lady in
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:34.427]  Denver, where when it goes through certain federal areas of the city by federal buildings and things, you know, they claim that you don't have any rights in these wide circles around federal buildings, schools, things of that nature.
[00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:42.472]  You know, security guard marches on, let me see your IDs, and then he doesn't even look at any of them, day after day, just, okay, thank you, you submitted, now move along.
[00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:50.918]  Your domestication is continuing, just like you break a horse, just like you train a pig to do tricks, I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.784]  And I have another big mainstream news article here.
[00:11:58.804 --> 00:12:02.787]  I actually thought I had it up on the top of my stack, but I'm having trouble finding it.
[00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:06.311]  About mainstream news, it sounds like I wrote the article.
[00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:09.954]  Well, here's a couple of them.
[00:12:10.254 --> 00:12:11.235]  Here's one out of The Guardian.
[00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:15.339]  Spy in the sky to spot energy-wasting homes.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.405]  Spy in the sky to spot energy-wasting homes.
[00:12:23.283 --> 00:12:32.691]  And it says that the thermal scanning, they're going to notice if there's any hot spots or if you've got a window open or if you're here, if you turn them too high, we're going to come find you and feed you.
[00:12:33.031 --> 00:12:33.692]  That's in England.
[00:12:34.893 --> 00:12:36.274]  But here's one out of the new standard.
[00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:39.777]  Mainstream publication magazine.
[00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:43.920]  Feds to fund controversial school surveillance is the headline.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.163]  A debate over government surveillance rages in adult society.
[00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:50.364]  Well, no one wants it, but it just keeps being put in place.
[00:12:50.724 --> 00:12:51.124]  The U.S.
[00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:58.212]  Department of Justice is quietly enacting school districts, enticing school districts to implement controversial technologies that monitor and track students.
[00:12:58.552 --> 00:13:01.896]  Critics fear these efforts will normalize electronic surveillance,
[00:13:02.643 --> 00:13:12.129]  At an early age, conditioning young people to accept privacy violations while creating a market for companies that develop and sell surveillance systems.
[00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:20.754]  A few of the nation's schools are already running pilot programs to monitor students' movements using radio frequency identification or RFID.
[00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:27.718]  The highly controversial programs implemented in the name of student protection see pupils wearing tags around their necks
[00:13:28.218 --> 00:13:33.003]  And submitting themselves to electronic scanning as they enter and leave school property.
[00:13:33.463 --> 00:13:39.689]  Now a new federal grant could lure more districts into using these or similar technologies.
[00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:53.329]  Even though school violence is at its lowest rate in a decade, according to the federal government's own statistics, the Justice Department's school safety technologies, which are actual prison technologies, admit schools are literal lockdown medium security facilities.
[00:13:53.969 --> 00:14:09.882]  Grants will be distributed to schools and develop proposals in four broadly defined areas, integrated physical security systems, bus fleet monitoring systems, low-level force devices, and school safety training.
[00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:17.587]  Chasers, guns, cameras, face scanning cameras, cameras in school buses, cameras in the bathrooms, that's already happening.
[00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.548]  Just type it into Google.
[00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:26.634]  Remember in Tennessee a couple years ago they had a big computer system and people were accessing it all over the country.
[00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:31.017]  And it was the 10 and 11 year old middle school girls in the showers, remember that?
[00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:35.741]  And normal girls from a local basketball team were in the showers.
[00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:50.754]  They ran out screaming, there's cameras, and the police, and the Bizarro, just totally insane, out of control, New World Order principal just said, of course there are cameras in the bathroom.
[00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:52.476]  It stops theft and fighting.
[00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.679]  Cameras, it's normal.
[00:14:55.719 --> 00:15:00.724]  And then everyone started freaking out and running around and screaming, and basically the parents almost rioted.
[00:15:02.057 --> 00:15:03.698]  Because, see, they just told the kids, that's cool.
[00:15:03.738 --> 00:15:07.921]  See, there's certain areas of brainwashed people in certain areas where they'll just put up with anything.
[00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.562]  And then there's still normal, old-fashioned people.
[00:15:10.622 --> 00:15:14.024]  Hey, a camera in the shower is a little much!
[00:15:15.005 --> 00:15:21.869]  And then they found out that from North Carolina to Ohio, people were accessing it and watching it.
[00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.031]  It was the type of video where it takes a snapshot every few seconds.
[00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:30.494]  You know, the stop-start computer system.
[00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:36.106]  And that didn't stop, uh, what is it, uh, the Capitol over there in, uh, California.
[00:15:37.026 --> 00:15:37.646]  Sacramento!
[00:15:39.507 --> 00:15:47.332]  Article in the Sacramento Bee about how state police all over the state along with local police are tied into cameras and it said even, quote, in the locker room.
[00:15:47.432 --> 00:15:55.536]  So, so you think it's bad in 1984 where there's a camera, you know, in the bathroom and, uh, I remember seeing six, seven years ago in Michigan
[00:15:56.252 --> 00:16:05.976]  And it's down on Nationwide where they put hidden cameras in the rest stop bathrooms and they've got their excuses of, oh, there's people selling drugs in there, people having sex in there.
[00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:11.578]  Well, the point is, you just put a patrol car there, you start bussing some people, and then it stops.
[00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.959]  But no, we're not going to do that.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.421]  We're not going to put a camera in there while you go potty.
[00:16:20.282 --> 00:16:22.883]  And you know what, last night I was searching around, I was reading
[00:16:24.298 --> 00:16:36.203]  Some of the books that have been written that attack me by professors and neocons, and I didn't know that one, Professor Barak, or whatever his name is, I didn't know he was like an anti-terror guy, but it turns out he's a globalist and involved in all this stuff.
[00:16:36.223 --> 00:16:44.927]  But I was just reading how they claim, you know, they'll mix in all these crazy things and Planet X and all this other stuff in with serious people that are just talking about the world
[00:16:45.567 --> 00:17:00.391]  Power structures, these imperial power structures that openly say they're going to control us, that openly say they're going to enslave us, and then they just mix all this stuff together and try to discredit us, but he says we're deadly dangerous, and we're taking over, and you know, we're just totally evil and criminal.
[00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:10.234]  So they are getting afraid, and they are starting to realize that, well, people used to just laugh at these people, now they're listening, because it's all happening!
[00:17:10.294 --> 00:17:10.494]  I mean,
[00:17:12.006 --> 00:17:13.566]  And there are disinfo people out there.
[00:17:13.586 --> 00:17:14.527]  There are government ops.
[00:17:14.547 --> 00:17:19.468]  There are disinfo individuals out there who try to talk about kooky things and mix in ridiculous things.
[00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:20.749]  They're on the payroll, folks.
[00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:21.789]  We don't do that here.
[00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:25.190]  We're really fighting the New World Order.
[00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.470]  We're doing the best job we can.
[00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:29.471]  By the way, my new film is out.
[00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:30.271]  It's The Order of Death.
[00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:31.472]  I'm really, really proud of it.
[00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:39.194]  And it covers, well, the new footage shot inside Bohemian Grove by a person that worked there for two years inside the YOW, the effigies.
[00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:40.587]  I don't think so.
[00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:03.549]  Available right now.
[00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:04.029]  Get it.

[00:18:11.492 --> 00:18:13.833]  Great stocking stuffers.

[00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:20.667]  Make copies.
[00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:21.587]  Get them out to people.
[00:19:22.387 --> 00:19:23.368]  Buy multiple copies.
[00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:24.548]  Get my new film, Martial Law.
[00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:25.048]  It's so good.
[00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:25.749]  It's a miniseries.
[00:19:26.349 --> 00:19:28.369]  It's exposed in 9-11 like no other film out there.
[00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.590]  They need to be seen.
[00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:36.012]  And they won't be seen if you don't get them, if you don't give them as gifts, if you don't show them to your neighbors, if you don't... Get out there and get the word out.
[00:19:36.974 --> 00:19:39.636]  And I want to commend those that have and I want to thank those that have gotten the word out.
[00:19:39.676 --> 00:19:43.119]  I want to ask those of you that haven't joined in the fight, this is so important.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.122]  I mean, if we don't stop these globalists, it's over for the society.
[00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:48.944]  Two films for one price.
[00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.826]  And it's a great new film, Wanderer of Death.
[00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:53.187]  Each additional copy, $9.95.
[00:19:53.408 --> 00:19:54.989]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:57.351]  Alright, we'll be right back with a lot of key information.
[00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:57.791]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.995 --> 00:20:04.016]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[00:20:04.617 --> 00:20:05.938]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:17.384]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[00:20:17.964 --> 00:20:20.505]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:25.947]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:31.270]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:50.443]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:20:51.004 --> 00:20:55.727]  That's www.LibertyDollar.org or call toll-free
[00:20:56.414 --> 00:20:56.514]  888-421-6181.
[00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:02.856]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:08.959]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:09.219 --> 00:21:14.361]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:23.964]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:24.304 --> 00:21:29.266]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:33.587]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:33.807 --> 00:21:38.529]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:44.831]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:49.975]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:50.615]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:52.276]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:53.197]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:53.237 --> 00:21:53.738]  One and the same.
[00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:20.737]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.157 --> 00:22:24.278]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:24.538 --> 00:22:25.939]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:29.460]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.220]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:36.162]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:36.642 --> 00:22:40.263]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:40.874 --> 00:22:44.616]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.057 --> 00:22:48.759]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:50.620]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:50.900]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:05.438]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.578 --> 00:23:07.339]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:08.660]  But not just any water.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.962]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:13.022 --> 00:23:22.727]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.

[00:23:44.668 --> 00:23:51.313]  Hear the interview with GCN's Dr. Diegel at Nutramedical.com and for more information visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:51.693]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:23:51.713 --> 00:23:54.955]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.597 --> 00:24:28.624]  I got an email here in my stack from a listener, and he says, you know, I used to like you, Alex.
[00:24:28.704 --> 00:24:31.727]  I didn't think you were a great person, but you're an absolute piece of trash.
[00:24:32.808 --> 00:24:33.649]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:34.710]  It's somewhere here in the stack.
[00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.851]  I'm in a bad mood today, folks.
[00:24:38.553 --> 00:24:44.676]  He then just goes, I've caught you, you're a traitor, you're an evil hog-goblin demon, basically.
[00:24:44.696 --> 00:24:47.797]  You're just like Michael Moore, profiteering off of weapons.
[00:24:51.238 --> 00:25:04.624]  Because, I think they pay us $100 a month to be on the rotating banner on PrisonPlanet.com, some great little outfit, who's getting a lot of plugs right now, who sells self-defense things, a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.811]  But I guess predominantly tasers.
[00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:12.895]  You know, I don't own a taser because I don't like having one shot.
[00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:20.880]  I like, personally, revolvers and shotguns just because they're simple, they don't malfunction.
[00:25:24.342 --> 00:25:31.487]  Maybe one case out of a thousand, they don't malfunction like some fancy assault rifle or handgun.
[00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:38.427]  But, you see, this is the mind control.
[00:25:38.467 --> 00:25:39.488]  This is the disconnect.
[00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:43.472]  The individual obviously hasn't been listening carefully.
[00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:45.514]  I'm pro-gun.
[00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:47.255]  I'm pro-sword.
[00:25:47.836 --> 00:25:48.977]  I'm pro-ice pick.
[00:25:49.638 --> 00:25:51.139]  I'm pro-taser.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:58.306]  Ice picks and tasers and hickory sticks and fire axes
[00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:16.304]  You know, if I, again, if somebody came into a building and was beating people to death or shooting them, and I was running through the halls and I saw a fire axe, I'm going to rip it open, I'm going to pull the fire axe out, and I'm going to go attempt to use the fire axe on the individual who's running around shooting people.
[00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:26.509]  I'm going to try to sneak up like an overweight polar bear, and I'm going to run up behind him, or if I have to, I'm going to charge him with that axe.
[00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:30.247]  The axe is not evil.
[00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:31.087]  Do you understand that?
[00:26:31.287 --> 00:26:32.888]  It is actually good.
[00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:39.131]  It can be used to knock down burning doors or knock down burning walls if firefighters have got to escape.
[00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:41.011]  It can be used to kill an intruder.
[00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:43.933]  It can be used to... it can be brandished on an intruder.
[00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:52.197]  It's just like I had a fire going last night at my house and finally got some cold weather and I have to have a fire and I had the fireplace poker.
[00:26:52.637 --> 00:26:54.277]  I thought, man, that's a good little weapon right there.
[00:26:54.297 --> 00:26:56.238]  You know, the old classic fireplace poker.
[00:26:58.456 --> 00:26:59.537]  So there's that total disconnect.
[00:26:59.577 --> 00:26:59.757]  No.
[00:26:59.977 --> 00:27:02.738]  We're against the police misusing the tasers.
[00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:09.861]  We're against the police shooting somebody eight times with it and killing them.
[00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:11.882]  Shocking them over and over again and laughing.
[00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:16.324]  We're against them using it on an autistic child who doesn't follow their orders.
[00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:23.406]  We're against them using it on a pregnant woman who they're giving a ticket to and she says, you know, I don't want to sign that ticket.
[00:27:23.747 --> 00:27:24.547]  I wasn't speeding.
[00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:27.429]  Instead of just, okay, get out of the car, lady.
[00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.713]  You shouldn't even arrest her for that, folks.
[00:27:29.874 --> 00:27:30.715]  Just give her the ticket.
[00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:31.997]  Unsigned.
[00:27:32.639 --> 00:27:33.520]  No, they taser her.
[00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:36.185]  She's flopping around on the ground and almost has a miscarriage.
[00:27:36.205 --> 00:27:37.488]  In some cases, they are having miscarriages.
[00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:46.043]  It's the misuse of the gun, the misuse of the axe, the misuse of the fireplace poker, the misuse of the baseball bat.
[00:27:46.343 --> 00:27:49.184]  The baseball bat is not evil, and I know this is common sense.
[00:27:49.444 --> 00:27:56.665]  I'm not up here pontificating about some great genius epiphany that I am giving to the world here.
[00:27:59.786 --> 00:28:00.866]  I'm not Shakespearean.
[00:28:00.926 --> 00:28:01.826]  I've never pretended to be.
[00:28:04.047 --> 00:28:05.247]  But it is frustrating.
[00:28:06.868 --> 00:28:08.208]  It is extremely frustrating.
[00:28:10.303 --> 00:28:12.303]  And I'll dig it out and read it later.
[00:28:12.543 --> 00:28:13.984]  I was looking for it in the break room to find it.
[00:28:14.964 --> 00:28:17.104]  But I get these type of emails.
[00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:19.425]  Other people will go buy tasers.
[00:28:19.485 --> 00:28:20.425]  I'll go buy guns.
[00:28:21.445 --> 00:28:30.206]  Again, for women who have those social conditioning that guns are just the antichrist, women tend to still go out and get a taser.
[00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:31.587]  You better train with it.
[00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:32.747]  You better learn how to use it.
[00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:33.987]  You got one shot.
[00:28:34.447 --> 00:28:39.268]  But I tell you, that's better than you having nothing when some scumbag tries to rob you or rape you in a parking lot.
[00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:42.799]  Aim at center of mass and pull the trigger!
[00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:43.699]  Honey?
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.041]  So, are we evil because we want people to buy tasers?
[00:28:51.402 --> 00:28:54.063]  It's... It's... It's... Like, I ought to sell tasers.
[00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:56.764]  I don't think you need a gun license to sell those.
[00:28:57.484 --> 00:28:59.065]  Firearms dealer license to sell them.
[00:28:59.205 --> 00:28:59.865]  I believe in them.
[00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.987]  I don't like it when the company implies that it's non-lethal.
[00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:06.888]  Now they're having to say it's less lethal.
[00:29:07.688 --> 00:29:12.912]  I don't like it when they try to train and sell the cops on using them if somebody looks at them wrong.
[00:29:14.013 --> 00:29:15.474]  I think the cops should own guns.
[00:29:15.494 --> 00:29:17.396]  You know, there's moves to, quote, disarm the cops.
[00:29:17.736 --> 00:29:18.897]  The UN wants to do that.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:33.148]  I don't want to take guns away from the police, but I want them to know that there are servants, and when they shoot some innocent person in the back, I want that cop to go to jail, and I don't want other cops to defend them.
[00:29:34.228 --> 00:29:38.129]  No, I don't own Halliburton stock or biometric stock or Lockheed stock.
[00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:41.810]  I do not own one share of stock like Michael Moore.
[00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:48.311]  So don't try to make the parallel because I want you to defend yourself that I'm like Michael Moore profiteering from the war.
[00:29:49.272 --> 00:29:50.032]  Make me sick.
[00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:52.813]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:54.893]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.813 --> 00:29:58.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.658 --> 00:30:05.040]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:05.620]  Why?
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.581]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:30:08.661 --> 00:30:13.604]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.860]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.681]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:09.044]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:09.324 --> 00:31:20.227]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:20.807]  We're good to go!
[00:31:36.972 --> 00:31:37.472]  That's right!
[00:31:37.652 --> 00:31:44.775]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:49.176]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:31:53.858 --> 00:31:54.318]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:04.560]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.641]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:09.781]  Read the labels.
[00:32:10.222 --> 00:32:14.363]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.563 --> 00:32:18.744]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:19.124 --> 00:32:24.006]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:24.386 --> 00:32:27.931]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:33.499]  It's all-natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra-virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[00:32:50.557 --> 00:32:51.578]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:33:12.754 --> 00:33:21.437]  There is a cornucopia, a galaxy, a universe of examples of propaganda and TV movies.
[00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:28.219]  Just ABC alone has two shows coming out in the new year where the U.S.
[00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:30.740]  is destroyed, where U.N.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.301]  troops come in and arrest all the evil right-wingers.
[00:33:35.672 --> 00:33:38.535]  Harvard newspaper comes out and says we all need to be arrested.
[00:33:38.596 --> 00:33:40.958]  Sean Hannity says every militia member needs to be arrested.
[00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:46.524]  When we're just following the Second Amendment, every man in this country is in the militia between 18 and 49.
[00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.007]  That's federal law, by the way.
[00:33:49.968 --> 00:33:51.790]  They can ignore it if they want because they're a bunch of criminals.
[00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.728]  It's just total propaganda.
[00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:00.011]  I read online and watch the ads for the video games.
[00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:03.474]  I'd have to say about half of the shoot-em-up games, you are U.N.
[00:34:03.514 --> 00:34:05.555]  soldiers killing American militias.
[00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:10.220]  And of course, it's always for the good of the country, and the Illuminati's really helping.
[00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:15.896]  I mean, there's so many of these games, and another one was just brought to my attention.
[00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:20.978]  It's Shattered Union out from Xbox, produced by 2K Games.
[00:34:21.018 --> 00:34:26.379]  And by the way, I have a friend who is high level at Microsoft in the development of the Xbox.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:35.482]  It is a platform for online gaming, virtual reality, relationships, PC, email.
[00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:40.397]  And already they're starting to interface pain induction, pleasure induction through them.
[00:34:40.697 --> 00:34:42.899]  They're gonna be actual mind control boxes.
[00:34:42.939 --> 00:34:43.719]  In fact, they are.
[00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.641]  And I can't tell you who this individual is, obviously.
[00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:49.262]  They're high level.
[00:34:50.203 --> 00:34:52.624]  And it is openly mind-controlled.
[00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:53.645]  Openly.
[00:34:53.725 --> 00:34:55.846]  I mean, we're talking Department of Defense.
[00:34:56.026 --> 00:35:03.689]  This is all run in gleaming, you know, boardrooms with top scientists coming in with, you know, giant eggheads, folks.
[00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:06.671]  I mean, it is just scientifically crafted to destroy us.
[00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:12.794]  Meanwhile, there's slithering professors running around writing books about me, attacking me, saying I'm dangerous.
[00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:16.055]  I mean, you listen to this and you say, you know, is this dangerous?
[00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:17.496]  Why is this all we hear?
[00:35:18.246 --> 00:35:19.466]  Hundreds of games like this.
[00:35:19.546 --> 00:35:20.647]  Hundreds of TV shows.
[00:35:21.007 --> 00:35:22.027]  Hundreds of movies.
[00:35:22.387 --> 00:35:23.987]  They're all coming out right now.
[00:35:24.428 --> 00:35:25.808]  Just selling you on fear.
[00:35:25.928 --> 00:35:27.548]  Selling you on accepting this.
[00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:30.909]  They know we're going to be checking your IDs and searching you.
[00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:32.490]  But we're going to leave the illegal aliens alone.
[00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.610]  It's a joke.
[00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.810]  So here's Shattered Union.
[00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.031]  I think it tells a scary story.
[00:35:39.051 --> 00:35:43.552]  Because unfortunately, I believe this is one of the main battle plans.
[00:35:44.052 --> 00:35:46.213]  The globalists always have plan A, B, C down to Z.
[00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:49.116]  And Patsy, folks.
[00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:54.901]  And we know, it isn't like it's our opinion.
[00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:57.983]  We've interviewed the military officers that have been in the meetings.
[00:35:58.003 --> 00:36:00.065]  We've interviewed the emergency managers that have been in the meetings.
[00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:02.707]  We've got video clips of it, audio clips of it.
[00:36:03.147 --> 00:36:04.328]  It's been on the news now.
[00:36:04.648 --> 00:36:07.351]  Remember six, seven years ago, I was the crazy kook talking about this?
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:10.133]  But I have an emergency manager on, I have a police chief on.
[00:36:10.893 --> 00:36:12.555]  They're going to break this country down.
[00:36:12.995 --> 00:36:17.559]  The government's going to stay just malicious and bomb stuff and blow things up.
[00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:22.185]  And perhaps even set off a nuke and claim that the militias work with Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:22.966 --> 00:36:24.767]  They even, you know, this show 24 does that.
[00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:26.868]  It just gets constant.
[00:36:26.908 --> 00:36:27.369]  We know.
[00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:28.930]  That's one of their main plans.
[00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.331]  It could be a bio-attack as well.
[00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:33.032]  It could be economic.
[00:36:33.092 --> 00:36:33.812]  It could be both.
[00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:47.821]  But I just, everything I'm seeing, the indicators, I think the number one plan, plan A, plan A is suitcase nukes, multiple suitcase nukes, foreign troops, and you don't think this will happen here.
[00:36:48.755 --> 00:36:51.978]  I'm telling you folks, they're really gearing up to do it.
[00:36:52.018 --> 00:36:53.019]  We can stop them.
[00:36:53.079 --> 00:37:00.065]  I believe they would have already done it, and we wouldn't have been so bold and got in their face and said, we know you're the terrorist, we know you're behind it.
[00:37:00.325 --> 00:37:06.111]  So now Bush gives a speech and says, I'm going to control illegal immigration, and CNN has a poll of 98% say he's a liar.
[00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:07.772]  They don't believe him.
[00:37:08.132 --> 00:37:07.772]  98%!
[00:37:08.633 --> 00:37:12.036]  We have the poll saved on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:37:16.293 --> 00:37:18.756]  28% now think Bush is good.
[00:37:19.657 --> 00:37:21.859]  And again, Bush is a puppet, but that's an indicator.
[00:37:21.899 --> 00:37:23.261]  They're not buying it, folks.
[00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:25.203]  You've lost all credibility.
[00:37:25.923 --> 00:37:30.949]  So make your video games and try to condition the kids who are going to be driving the drones in 10 years.
[00:37:32.074 --> 00:37:36.977]  By the way, these are all combat application fighter simulators.
[00:37:37.377 --> 00:37:39.579]  The exact same buttons, the exact same systems.
[00:37:39.919 --> 00:37:49.084]  They've already got combat mobile drone tanks, mobile combat robots, mobile combat drones, mobile combat helicopters.
[00:37:49.445 --> 00:37:51.026]  By the way, 2011, half the Air Force goes to this.
[00:37:54.574 --> 00:37:58.257]  2011?
[00:37:55.494 --> 00:37:58.257]  They are going to have hundreds of thousands of these combat mechs.
[00:37:58.337 --> 00:37:59.337]  And you think I'm joking?
[00:37:59.538 --> 00:38:01.299]  It's in the Honolulu Advertiser.
[00:38:01.339 --> 00:38:02.620]  It's in the Associated Press.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.061]  Every day I see it!
[00:38:05.342 --> 00:38:13.709]  And it's somebody drinking Jolt Cola, eating Cheetos, in an armored underground office complex.
[00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.672]  It's going to be rampaging around, slaughtering you and your family.
[00:38:16.692 --> 00:38:18.073]  We're going to be fighting these things.
[00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:20.135]  Folks, I'm not joking about this!
[00:38:21.184 --> 00:38:22.024]  You understand that?
[00:38:22.325 --> 00:38:23.965]  They're already fighting swords.
[00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:26.386]  They're already fighting hundreds of robots in Iraq.
[00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:31.049]  And these are stuff that's 20 years old, okay?
[00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:33.790]  They're just holding back on all their real stuff, but it's all public.
[00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.391]  So, science fiction, yeah, boys and girls, it's 2005.
[00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:40.853]  Go to the Air Force's website.
[00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:42.694]  Half the Air Force is going to be drone.
[00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:45.255]  Most are going to be in 010 or year behind, 011.
[00:38:45.515 --> 00:38:49.237]  Let's go ahead and roll a shattered Union, more conditioning.
[00:38:51.058 --> 00:38:54.500]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.621]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:02.864]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[00:39:03.084 --> 00:39:12.528]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:20.412]  In response, the president invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:29.232]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[00:39:30.393 --> 00:39:37.355]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[00:39:39.535 --> 00:39:43.396]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:48.958]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[00:39:49.018 --> 00:39:49.378]  Congress.
[00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:53.512]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[00:39:53.972 --> 00:39:57.833]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[00:39:58.553 --> 00:40:03.675]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:06.276]  area to secure international interest.
[00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:15.059]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[00:40:15.945 --> 00:40:22.990]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:25.211]  Now.
[00:40:27.653 --> 00:40:31.956]  The once United States of America lie in ruin.
[00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:41.582]  The time for words has passed, and a second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[00:40:43.163 --> 00:40:45.765]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.272]  To restore peace.
[00:40:49.575 --> 00:40:52.560]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[00:41:00.097 --> 00:41:01.258]  We know that's the plan.
[00:41:01.278 --> 00:41:08.202]  They've got the Larry Conquistas being funded by the Ford Foundation, the very same organizations and foundations that are funding the white supremacist organizations.
[00:41:08.703 --> 00:41:14.426]  Our military is being joint-trained continually with the police, with foreign troops, and that's the real plan.
[00:41:14.887 --> 00:41:21.511]  It's going to be in this Republic of Texas business, the California sector, and we're going to be broken up into regions of the Pan-American Union.
[00:41:21.871 --> 00:41:26.114]  Now, again, when I say Plan A, I mean Plan A of a hot war.
[00:41:27.415 --> 00:41:28.896]  They've already gone with a cold war.
[00:41:29.693 --> 00:41:32.615]  That's when you walk into the 7-Eleven like I did late last night.
[00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:36.137]  I walk into the 7-Eleven and there's the little scanners.
[00:41:36.977 --> 00:41:44.341]  And I ask the guys, well, people don't like it, nobody's using it, but yeah, all the new credit cards coming out from Visa are going to make you basically have a chip in them.
[00:41:45.822 --> 00:41:52.286]  You see, they don't ask you, they just do it, and now they can track you and read you and scan you using that.
[00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:54.782]  Folks, it isn't a joke.
[00:41:54.902 --> 00:41:56.603]  I mean, they have really trained foreign troops.
[00:41:56.623 --> 00:41:58.024]  I mean, I made a video about it, Police Day 2000.
[00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:05.270]  I went there and watched the foreign troops, and I've got the Army Colonel, Colonel Love, saying, yeah, this is for here in America, for your own good.
[00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.031]  I've got them doing the mocking derogations.
[00:42:07.231 --> 00:42:07.792]  Where are you from?
[00:42:07.852 --> 00:42:08.713]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:42:08.733 --> 00:42:09.653]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.235]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[00:42:13.096 --> 00:42:16.799]  You know, I've talked to Colonel Craig Roberts here on air, where his nephew goes,
[00:42:17.809 --> 00:42:23.195]  And he's there at his West Point thing, and in comes Wesley Clark, telling him that we're going to have foreign troops in America.
[00:42:23.515 --> 00:42:28.300]  I'm watching Nightline, and UN General McKenzie says we're going to use UN troops in America.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.422]  I mean, this isn't a joke, okay?
[00:42:31.784 --> 00:42:39.992]  And just because some counter-terrorism professor out there likes to write books about me, and go on C-SPAN and call me names... You know what?
[00:42:40.032 --> 00:42:40.813]  He's scared, though.
[00:42:41.824 --> 00:42:42.665]  See, I never read the book.
[00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:45.626]  I was reading some passages of it last night because I don't pay for such trash.
[00:42:45.706 --> 00:42:52.469]  I was reading some of the passages, some of the pages that have been put on the web by the publisher.
[00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.450]  And it was, they're afraid.
[00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.431]  They're going to take over.
[00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:56.752]  They're going to get us.
[00:42:57.212 --> 00:42:58.112]  They're taking over.
[00:42:58.833 --> 00:42:59.793]  Because it's the truth!
[00:42:59.813 --> 00:43:01.134]  We're not taking anything over!
[00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:02.935]  You're trying to take us over!
[00:43:03.495 --> 00:43:04.496]  Leave us alone!
[00:43:04.596 --> 00:43:05.116]  Stop it!
[00:43:09.116 --> 00:43:11.438]  And everything's being transferred to China.
[00:43:11.538 --> 00:43:14.780]  All the investments, the money, the factories, the jobs.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.681]  It's all being moved to Europe and China.
[00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:18.602]  They're the two model sectors.
[00:43:18.642 --> 00:43:19.082]  The U.N.
[00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:19.763]  openly says it.
[00:43:19.783 --> 00:43:21.224]  They giggle about it on NPR.
[00:43:21.604 --> 00:43:23.385]  Americans have had a good far too long.
[00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:24.385]  We're about to be shown.
[00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:28.288]  They all make their little jokes and they snicker about it.
[00:43:28.788 --> 00:43:30.129]  The yuppies snicker.
[00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:31.890]  It's all real funny.
[00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.011]  Well, it isn't funny!
[00:43:35.672 --> 00:43:37.193]  They're going to break this country up.
[00:43:37.233 --> 00:43:38.094]  They're going to do it.
[00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:51.429]  Folks, you remember six, seven years ago, even when I had emergency managers and generals and people on the show saying they've seen plans to bring in foreign troops and break the country up and put us in camps and face scan us to walk down the street.
[00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:53.991]  I go, I don't think that'll ever happen.
[00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:55.793]  They just can't get away with it.
[00:43:56.033 --> 00:44:02.198]  Well, now I'm here telling you that it's not just a possibility, it is probable.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.022]  And I'm sorry to the stupid cops and stupid military.
[00:44:07.586 --> 00:44:08.747]  Those of you that are stupid.
[00:44:09.148 --> 00:44:10.629]  I mean, what do you expect us to do?
[00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:14.112]  What do you expect us to do when you want to take us to the camp?
[00:44:15.093 --> 00:44:19.697]  So we can be debriefed, so we can be interrogated to make sure we're good.
[00:44:19.897 --> 00:44:22.900]  That's all Iraq is, is a huge laboratory for this.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.482]  Pentagon admits, for America, for the Western world.
[00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:31.848]  Checkpoints, arrest about a third of the people every day, take them to camps, interrogate them, release some, torture others, kill others.
[00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:40.932]  I mean, you'd expect us to say, oh, there's nice men in black uniforms and masks at this checkpoint.
[00:44:41.212 --> 00:44:44.016]  Oh, here, let me, let me just with my family get in the paddy wagon with you.
[00:44:44.276 --> 00:44:45.317]  Here, oh, sure.
[00:44:45.617 --> 00:44:47.640]  Oh, the children go in one area of the camp.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.341]  I can't see them.
[00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:49.182]  My wife goes in another.
[00:44:49.222 --> 00:44:49.962]  I go in this other.
[00:44:50.383 --> 00:44:52.886]  I'm going to be interrogated now by some shaved head punk.
[00:44:55.473 --> 00:44:57.634]  Well, America got hit by the weapons.
[00:44:58.094 --> 00:45:01.775]  Three cities and major areas destroyed by the nukes of 07.
[00:45:02.215 --> 00:45:03.155]  We're just not gonna.
[00:45:03.795 --> 00:45:05.536]  It was people like you, Jones.
[00:45:06.256 --> 00:45:11.197]  People like you, Jones, that didn't let us implement the security we needed so the terrorists were able to get us.
[00:45:11.597 --> 00:45:15.318]  And that's why now, Jones, you're gonna tell us about all your contacts and everybody you know.
[00:45:16.039 --> 00:45:17.539]  Meet Dr. Johnson.
[00:45:18.399 --> 00:45:19.259]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:19.979 --> 00:45:20.740]  Hello, now.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.140]  You can just... And that isn't a joke, folks.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.861]  This is where our future's going.
[00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:27.801]  So, no, I'm not going to go to the camp with them.
[00:45:28.901 --> 00:45:33.783]  The stupid little goons that come along, if this stuff does break out, are just going to have a bad time.
[00:45:37.063 --> 00:45:40.064]  There's a lot of punks that like to shoot their mouths off about violence.
[00:45:40.084 --> 00:45:44.705]  A lot of people like to talk about how they're big and bad, and they like to threaten people.
[00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:47.826]  And a lot of them are just big, fat feds, is what they are, folks.
[00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:50.706]  I want to avert that.
[00:45:51.886 --> 00:45:57.507]  And I want the police to not serve the New World Order.
[00:45:58.028 --> 00:46:00.148]  I want the police to realize how they're being controlled.
[00:46:00.408 --> 00:46:01.269]  You gave an oath.
[00:46:02.149 --> 00:46:06.770]  You swore an oath to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, to this country, to the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.771]  What does it mean to a plastic American flag made by slaves in China?
[00:46:11.031 --> 00:46:12.112]  That ain't America!
[00:46:14.893 --> 00:46:16.293]  Do you understand me?
[00:46:20.293 --> 00:46:21.293]  They know what they're doing.
[00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.974]  Don't think the globalists didn't have close elections for nothing.
[00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:27.875]  Don't think they didn't let the evidence of election fraud come out for nothing.
[00:46:28.295 --> 00:46:32.836]  Don't think they didn't let all of this happen.
[00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:35.616]  It's part of an agenda to demonize America.
[00:46:35.696 --> 00:46:37.277]  I'm not here to demonize America.
[00:46:38.117 --> 00:46:40.337]  We are bought and paid for and owned.
[00:46:40.357 --> 00:46:41.978]  This is not a secret.
[00:46:42.058 --> 00:46:42.838]  It's in Forbes.
[00:46:42.878 --> 00:46:43.478]  It's in money.
[00:46:44.098 --> 00:46:44.558]  By the EU.
[00:46:44.638 --> 00:46:45.618]  The European Union.
[00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:55.872]  The financial interest there, could they go in and take over Iraq with the population put up with it there?
[00:46:55.932 --> 00:46:56.212]  No.
[00:46:57.992 --> 00:46:59.293]  How do they make themselves look good?
[00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:00.873]  They have their bad cop do it.
[00:47:02.274 --> 00:47:03.774]  And they play us like a fiddle.
[00:47:04.494 --> 00:47:17.058]  And I'm not trying to sit here and preach today, it's just that many of the public schools around the country, I haven't seen the numbers, I know it's a large portion of them,
[00:47:19.148 --> 00:47:20.508]  Now have fences around them.
[00:47:20.888 --> 00:47:23.369]  Ten, twelve foot fences, barbed wire in many cases.
[00:47:24.009 --> 00:47:28.810]  They show IDs, they wear them around their necks, they scan them, they thumbprint to get lunches, library books.
[00:47:29.551 --> 00:47:36.492]  They're lined up, in many cases, once a week and police come in with dogs and the kids have to face the wall like a shakedown.
[00:47:36.932 --> 00:47:38.153]  I mean, that's a prison!
[00:47:39.233 --> 00:47:40.233]  But our border's wide open.
[00:47:41.313 --> 00:47:44.854]  These illegals can kill and rape whoever they want, they can spread whatever diseases they want.
[00:47:45.214 --> 00:47:46.495]  Not a word said, but U.S.
[00:47:46.515 --> 00:47:47.775]  citizens are on the rack.
[00:47:48.658 --> 00:47:52.482]  And you look at these cops now, you see the old timer cops, nice, friendly, helpful folks.
[00:47:52.523 --> 00:47:56.267]  I see state police changing tires on old ladies cars, God bless them.
[00:47:56.787 --> 00:47:59.230]  I see good people like that, but they never move up the chain.
[00:47:59.511 --> 00:48:02.514]  The little drug dealing, corrupt detective, he ends up being chief.
[00:48:04.877 --> 00:48:09.302]  And I go see these new steroid goons, shaved head cops with the tattoos all over them on the roids.
[00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.806]  Bugging their eyes out at people.
[00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:13.786]  Stomping around.
[00:48:13.806 --> 00:48:14.886]  They never were real men.
[00:48:14.926 --> 00:48:16.207]  They don't know what a real man is.
[00:48:16.447 --> 00:48:17.587]  How a real man feels empathy.
[00:48:17.627 --> 00:48:18.688]  How a real man is strong.
[00:48:18.908 --> 00:48:21.389]  How a real man has true moral courage.
[00:48:22.089 --> 00:48:25.370]  Not just mindless bestial posturing.
[00:48:27.151 --> 00:48:28.491]  They want to make their bones.
[00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:29.572]  They want to get a kill.
[00:48:29.592 --> 00:48:30.552]  They want to get tough.
[00:48:31.192 --> 00:48:32.593]  They want people to submit to them.
[00:48:37.819 --> 00:48:38.339]  I don't think so.
[00:48:56.756 --> 00:49:09.922]  You think you're part of the system, bureaucrats, city managers, city council people, county commissioners listening, people getting a little deal, living in a fancy house because you took the bribe or you took the sweetheart deal, the wink wink.
[00:49:11.222 --> 00:49:12.703]  You've destroyed your children's future.
[00:49:12.723 --> 00:49:14.104]  You've destroyed your own future.
[00:49:17.025 --> 00:49:22.327]  Corruption and evil and decadence and torture and wanton evil has become the norm.
[00:49:22.607 --> 00:49:23.508]  We have become evil.
[00:49:27.285 --> 00:49:32.050]  Our societies, our families, our cultures are unraveling, are dying.
[00:49:32.791 --> 00:49:35.334]  The death of the West is upon us.
[00:49:36.468 --> 00:49:49.960]  By design, because anything beautiful and strong and pure and good, whatever culture it is, whatever group it is, whatever community it is, threatens the board, threatens the New World Order, threatens these people.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.304]  They want you dumbed down, soulless, drugged out, drooling.
[00:49:54.584 --> 00:49:57.647]  And that's only so they can kill you in an orderly fashion.
[00:49:58.207 --> 00:50:16.773]  Oh, the drugging and the psychological conditioning and all of that is just to get you to submit to the New World Order, to submit to the compact cities, to submit to the control grid, so they can put you into these systems, so they can straitjacket you, and so they can kill you, kill us, kill me, kill my family.
[00:50:18.253 --> 00:50:21.014]  And these punks can write their articles about how we're all crazy.
[00:50:21.681 --> 00:50:33.563]  And now we make this shot, but that's their official World Trade Organization, IMF, World Bank, World Health Organization, UN Food Program's own statements!
[00:50:34.523 --> 00:50:37.384]  We've got people saying they want to kill us!
[00:50:39.004 --> 00:50:40.304]  And we're doing nothing!
[00:50:41.984 --> 00:50:43.345]  As they put the grid in!
[00:50:43.365 --> 00:50:44.565]  I hear the music.
[00:50:45.685 --> 00:50:48.666]  We're gonna go to break here in a moment.
[00:50:50.446 --> 00:50:50.986]  Come back and
[00:50:52.085 --> 00:50:53.126]  Take a few of your calls.
[00:50:54.428 --> 00:50:55.269]  Got a guest coming up.
[00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:59.794]  And as well... And I'm in a dark mood today, I know that.
[00:50:59.834 --> 00:51:00.334]  But you know what?
[00:51:00.535 --> 00:51:01.516]  These are dark times.
[00:51:01.536 --> 00:51:05.901]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:10.446]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:13.234 --> 00:51:13.795]  Disaster.
[00:51:14.195 --> 00:51:15.056]  A New World Order.
[00:51:15.136 --> 00:51:16.498]  A New World Order.
[00:51:17.159 --> 00:51:17.900]  Panama.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.426]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:29.415]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.555 --> 00:51:31.538]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.778 --> 00:51:42.283]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.543 --> 00:51:47.905]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.067 --> 00:52:03.048]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:52:03.128 --> 00:52:13.832]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:14.212 --> 00:52:18.734]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.814 --> 00:52:30.138]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.738 --> 00:52:37.582]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.982 --> 00:52:40.103]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.603 --> 00:52:45.586]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[00:52:45.886 --> 00:52:52.029]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.049 --> 00:52:53.149]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:52:53.209 --> 00:52:53.790]  That's toll free!
[00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:53.850]  888-803-4438.
[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:02.975]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:18.549]  I think so.
[00:53:40.803 --> 00:53:42.884]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[00:53:43.044 --> 00:53:47.487]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[00:53:47.707 --> 00:53:50.789]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:56.913]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.796 --> 00:54:09.141]  I'll just say this to the corrupt police out there.
[00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:16.273]  Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves and being part of a corrupt system, be like the good cops.
[00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:25.120]  It feels a lot better to change an old lady's tire when she needs help than to take some 14-year-old kid to jail because he's got some marijuana.
[00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:31.925]  When your own government's pushing psychotropic drugs, so toxic and deadly, it's just unbelievable.
[00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:33.987]  Meanwhile, shipping in the narcotics.
[00:54:34.267 --> 00:54:35.147]  How do you do that?
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.160]  And engage in such hypocrisy.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.181]  And I don't want to hear the government doesn't ship the drugs in.
[00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:41.061]  Everybody knows they do.
[00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:43.821]  My gosh, this is ridiculous.
[00:54:45.422 --> 00:54:50.723]  That is the lion's share of it, and then they use the military and the DEA and others against their competition.
[00:54:51.563 --> 00:54:52.943]  Let's talk to Terri in Florida.
[00:54:52.963 --> 00:54:54.343]  Terri, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:54:54.623 --> 00:54:55.164]  Yes, hi.
[00:54:55.664 --> 00:55:01.225]  I want to let you know that I called you before about something that was going on, you know, about our property problems we were having here.
[00:55:01.305 --> 00:55:02.565]  We had a meeting last night
[00:55:03.078 --> 00:55:09.321]  And I mean, everybody got up and started saying, well, the Bilderbergers are behind this, the Illuminatis, the New World Order, I mean, it was unreal!
[00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:10.142]  I mean, it was real!
[00:55:10.162 --> 00:55:12.423]  Well, were you at some type of county commission meeting or something?
[00:55:12.443 --> 00:55:17.205]  Yeah, and they're trying to pass these regulations where they can take people's property wages from the smallest little thing.
[00:55:17.305 --> 00:55:20.707]  What percentage of the people there were saying it's the New World Order?
[00:55:20.967 --> 00:55:21.787]  Oh, quite a few.
[00:55:22.248 --> 00:55:22.648]  Quite a few!
[00:55:22.668 --> 00:55:22.888]  I love it!
[00:55:23.468 --> 00:55:26.911]  You see, it's gotten so mainstream, everybody just knows who the enemy is.
[00:55:27.231 --> 00:55:35.877]  The little guys hiding behind these Presidents and these Governors, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Oppenheimers, the Sachs-Coburg-Gobels, they're all being exposed.
[00:55:36.017 --> 00:55:37.418]  Well, I got up and said it myself.
[00:55:37.759 --> 00:55:40.400]  And I even told them, I said, we left England to get away from tyranny.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.661]  I said, this is not going to happen.
[00:55:42.022 --> 00:55:45.224]  And I said, when a government becomes so destructive, the people have a right to abolish it.
[00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:47.417]  Well, not just a right of duty.
[00:55:47.457 --> 00:55:48.357]  Thanks, Terry.
[00:55:48.417 --> 00:55:49.197]  Pat in Ohio.
[00:55:49.217 --> 00:55:50.418]  I'm going to move quick today.
[00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:51.258]  Go ahead, Pat.
[00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:51.818]  You're on the air.
[00:55:52.238 --> 00:55:52.559]  Okay.
[00:55:52.699 --> 00:55:58.521]  Alex, you know, you made an interesting comment a few weeks ago about, what's his name, Tim McVeigh.
[00:55:59.241 --> 00:56:03.323]  And you said that you were told that he was drooling in the mouth or whatever.
[00:56:03.363 --> 00:56:04.243]  Somebody found him.
[00:56:04.663 --> 00:56:05.323]  Well, no.
[00:56:06.304 --> 00:56:11.946]  It was in the major newspapers of the state that he was basically falling down and drooling and saying, I got a chip.
[00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:13.286]  You know, turn it off.
[00:56:13.727 --> 00:56:14.447]  They put it in me.
[00:56:15.297 --> 00:56:22.003]  I mean, this is a guy who cooks a perfect bomb, parks it, and then he's driving around erratically without a license plate.
[00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:24.706]  Oh, okay.
[00:56:27.689 --> 00:56:29.991]  Has anybody done a tape on him?
[00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:31.092]  Tape on that?
[00:56:31.192 --> 00:56:32.013]  That's pretty interesting.
[00:56:32.653 --> 00:56:37.438]  Ma'am, I'm sorry, my line to the network up in Minnesota just cut out for a moment.
[00:56:37.978 --> 00:56:39.820]  Was I on air just now, guys?
[00:56:40.842 --> 00:56:41.262]  Okay, good.
[00:56:41.503 --> 00:56:42.483]  I guess people didn't hear that.
[00:56:44.205 --> 00:56:45.706]  I was cut off for a few seconds there.
[00:56:45.886 --> 00:56:46.046]  Oh.
[00:56:46.627 --> 00:56:46.847]  Yeah.
[00:56:47.347 --> 00:56:49.229]  Now, you were asking if someone was making a film about that?
[00:56:49.429 --> 00:56:49.969]  Right.
[00:56:50.009 --> 00:56:51.150]  Or tape or something.
[00:56:51.571 --> 00:56:52.431]  Or a book on it.
[00:56:53.232 --> 00:56:56.555]  On how they captured him and how he was drooling at the mouth and whatnot.
[00:56:56.595 --> 00:56:58.616]  Well, I mean, that was in the Daily Oklahoman.
[00:56:58.676 --> 00:56:59.997]  It was State Police reported it.
[00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:01.959]  He was stumbling around saying, I got it, Jeff, help me.
[00:57:02.734 --> 00:57:04.216]  Which I don't believe he actually had a chip.
[00:57:04.436 --> 00:57:04.997]  You don't?
[00:57:05.477 --> 00:57:19.395]  No, what they'll do is, he may have, but what they'll do is they'll torture you for several months, sometimes longer, and while they're dunking you in the water, giving you the LSD, the PCP, the mescaline, together with other drugs that also cause pain.
[00:57:20.115 --> 00:57:22.637]  While they're torturing you, they will then just keep saying a key word.
[00:57:22.978 --> 00:57:25.420]  Now we're going to take the chip out because you do what we say.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:32.486]  And then they can simply call someone up and say something like, I don't want to say something too mind-controllish.
[00:57:32.526 --> 00:57:33.627]  It might actually trigger somebody.
[00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:41.974]  But the point is, if you don't follow this out, code 7X7349 against a designated target, we're going to activate the chip.
[00:57:42.554 --> 00:57:45.096]  And then just the person's brain is totally broken down.
[00:57:45.136 --> 00:57:47.999]  Their resistance... This has been in congressional hearings, by the way, folks.
[00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:53.220]  Totally broken down, they will then march out and do whatever they're told.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.861]  And of course, mind control subjects normally don't operate very well.
[00:57:56.901 --> 00:57:58.422]  They can't do really complex things.
[00:57:58.442 --> 00:57:59.683]  They're pretty much ruined.
[00:57:59.963 --> 00:58:01.443]  They're mentally ill basket cases.
[00:58:01.463 --> 00:58:04.765]  You take someone and make them basically schizophrenic and screwed up.
[00:58:05.365 --> 00:58:09.227]  So he obviously didn't carry out the bombing itself, but he's seen on the video with the Muslims.
[00:58:09.807 --> 00:58:10.127]  Yes.
[00:58:18.274 --> 00:58:18.735]  Can you hear me?
[00:58:18.835 --> 00:58:20.096]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[00:58:20.116 --> 00:58:21.258]  Yeah, I'm cutting in and out, folks.
[00:58:21.278 --> 00:58:22.459]  People can't hear it, I can hear it.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:28.286]  But they will... You know what?
[00:58:28.306 --> 00:58:28.947]  Thanks, Nicole.
[00:58:29.007 --> 00:58:31.811]  I'll have to try to reconnect, get these lines working better.
[00:58:31.951 --> 00:58:36.837]  It's an important subject, so I'll try to elaborate on it.
[00:58:36.857 --> 00:58:37.478]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.437 --> 00:58:46.278]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.318 --> 00:58:46.778]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.938 --> 00:58:47.698]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.918 --> 00:58:49.839]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.979 --> 00:58:52.019]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.452 --> 00:59:05.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.352 --> 00:59:09.715]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.195 --> 00:59:14.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.976 --> 00:59:24.982]  Debra Davis, who on a daily basis, the security guards would just come on to the public bus and man to see everybody's ID.
[00:59:25.042 --> 00:59:27.344]  As soon as they submitted, they would just leave them alone.
[00:59:27.424 --> 00:59:28.344]  They wouldn't even look at the IDs.
[00:59:28.384 --> 00:59:30.006]  It was just about submission.
[00:59:30.446 --> 00:59:35.950]  And now they're just announcing on the highways, the roads, the streets, the banks, goons will be doing this in Miami.
[00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.772]  So she's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:40.713 --> 00:59:42.915]  A caller, Pat in Ohio, brought up an interesting point.
[00:59:43.335 --> 00:59:46.017]  It was reported by the state police and in TV and newspapers.
[00:59:47.190 --> 01:00:02.637]  The McVeigh was captured a few hours after the Oklahoma City bombing, driving an older model white sedan with the plates off of it, so it would be real obvious and easy to notice, swerving up and down the road, driving at a higher rate of speed, and stopping, pulling over.
[01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:04.999]  The state police pulled him over.
[01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:09.981]  McVeigh got out drooling, saying, I got a chip, I got a chip, it burns, help me.
[01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:17.732]  The state police are on record about this, and normally what it is, is it's a mind control trigger.
[01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:19.573]  He doesn't really have a chip.
[01:00:20.713 --> 01:00:29.996]  It is a psychological trigger point, or kind of a psychological node for the mind controlee to be triggered.
[01:00:30.657 --> 01:00:32.777]  You can break a woman, they have reported.
[01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:37.479]  Dr. Ewan Cameron could break them in just a few months, even shorter if it was a young girl.
[01:00:38.883 --> 01:00:39.964]  Men, it takes longer.
[01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:44.066]  You can break men, but then they tend to be even more dysfunctional than women.
[01:00:44.606 --> 01:00:47.888]  So that's why, obviously, McVeigh didn't cook the bomb or set it all up.
[01:00:48.168 --> 01:00:49.769]  He was a basket case.
[01:00:49.789 --> 01:01:04.498]  And then even his federal handler, once he was in prison for the trial, and who died shortly after McVeigh was executed, was Jolion West, the admitted famous MKUltra top scientist, with Dr. Ewan Cameron and others.
[01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:06.193]  I mean, it was on the news.
[01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:06.894]  Jolly and West.
[01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:08.174]  He visits him in his cell.
[01:01:08.214 --> 01:01:09.655]  Jolly and West is his psychiatrist.
[01:01:10.035 --> 01:01:13.637]  Well, obviously, you've got to have a mind controller to handle him and still get him through.
[01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:22.881]  Basically, you can just get somebody to say what you want and sit there and you'll be lucky if they don't look like complete lunatics who are catatonic, which is what McVeigh looked like a lot.
[01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:26.462]  Just big black circles, really unable to talk, starry-eyed look.
[01:01:27.343 --> 01:01:29.083]  I mean, it's just classic mind control.
[01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:30.244]  The North Koreans developed it.
[01:01:30.264 --> 01:01:31.064]  The Russians developed it.
[01:01:31.084 --> 01:01:32.445]  Of course, we're Americans.
[01:01:32.465 --> 01:01:33.485]  We always surpass everyone.
[01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:34.846]  We've got the worst systems there are.
[01:01:35.772 --> 01:01:36.933]  And that's just 101!
[01:01:38.855 --> 01:01:43.619]  You've got McVeigh getting out of the vehicle with John Doe No.
[01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:47.502]  2, Al-Husseini Hussein, known CIA operative, trained in the 1980s by the U.S.
[01:01:47.522 --> 01:01:50.305]  government, Republican Guard, brought back in by Bush Sr.
[01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:56.250]  in 1992 as part of three waves of a total of 5,000 Iraqi Republican Guard.
[01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.992]  They were seen as the decoys.
[01:01:59.873 --> 01:02:01.995]  They needed a fallback plan to blame it on them as well.
[01:02:02.705 --> 01:02:05.327]  They claim it was Arabs, but they went with a militia angle instead.
[01:02:06.467 --> 01:02:15.013]  FBI's been in the LA Times, officers, you know, they're not all bad, saying, yeah, I saw the tape, it's McVeigh with Muslims, and I've talked to police who've seen the tape, and it's been on record.
[01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:21.036]  The government's declared national security on that tape, and it was never used by the prosecution to show McVeigh bombing it.
[01:02:21.457 --> 01:02:22.497]  Funny, they wouldn't show that, sir.
[01:02:22.737 --> 01:02:26.640]  Well, there was actually 12 tapes, but one was right above them, you know, close-ups of them.
[01:02:27.401 --> 01:02:31.083]  And we have all that, the newscast admitting it, the local interviews.
[01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:33.625]  In my film, 9-11, the Road to Tyranny.
[01:02:34.425 --> 01:02:37.647]  Forty minutes of the almost three-hour film covers Oklahoma City.
[01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:41.029]  The lady was asking how she could get that or how she could find out about that.
[01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:44.151]  And this is just a science, folks.
[01:02:44.231 --> 01:02:45.572]  It's a science of breaking people.
[01:02:46.212 --> 01:02:48.133]  There's lots of different forms of mind control.
[01:02:48.173 --> 01:02:52.596]  I mean, 800 years ago, 500 years ago in Japan, they had the ninja.
[01:02:54.477 --> 01:02:58.360]  Which was just one little secret society of assassins of many in Japan.
[01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:13.693]  And just with opium, sex, and rank, they could have somebody who was trained for 10-15 years, and when they were 30 years old, they would go out and commit a murder, and then commit suicide.
[01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:18.237]  Just to get rid of any record of who sent them.
[01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:22.541]  Now that's just with some opium and some sex.
[01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:26.336]  And with some social conditioning, peer pressure.
[01:03:26.356 --> 01:03:28.916]  I mean, look at the mind control of the Marine Corps.
[01:03:29.396 --> 01:03:30.457]  And folks, it is mind control.
[01:03:30.497 --> 01:03:33.317]  Shaved heads, chanting, you know, all that business.
[01:03:33.657 --> 01:03:34.398]  Jim Jones stuff.
[01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:48.121]  So believe me, you start tabling people for six months, and you start hopping them up on four or five hallucinogens at once with other drugs that cause incredible pain, believe me, you can get exactly what you want real fast.
[01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:57.709]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.969 --> 01:03:59.551]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.891 --> 01:04:04.574]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.915 --> 01:04:11.660]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.962]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:17.005]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.105 --> 01:04:21.749]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.969 --> 01:04:26.373]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:33.840]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:56.570]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:59.694]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.954 --> 01:05:04.120]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:05.381]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:10.287]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.768 --> 01:05:12.890]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:14.232]  Sheltering in place.
[01:05:14.656 --> 01:05:28.040]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:58.652]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:05:58.692 --> 01:05:59.432]  have diabetes.
[01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:06.714]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:06:06.854 --> 01:06:11.375]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:06:11.575 --> 01:06:14.396]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:59.541]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:12.685]  When the police become the military, when the military becomes the police, you have tyranny, you have a police state.
[01:07:14.285 --> 01:07:18.787]  And the classical benchmark of a police state is
[01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:21.941]  On the train in Nazi Germany.
[01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:25.003]  Madam, may I see your papers please?
[01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:25.584]  Thank you.
[01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.165]  These are not in order.
[01:07:27.205 --> 01:07:30.928]  I will need to pull you off at the next stop and take you for further questioning.
[01:07:31.368 --> 01:07:32.629]  Is that clear?
[01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:36.772]  Now, I've told the story of, it's gotta be 12 years ago.
[01:07:37.493 --> 01:07:38.173]  I was in college.
[01:07:39.494 --> 01:07:40.615]  I lived in a decent apartment.
[01:07:41.296 --> 01:07:42.096]  Decent area of town.
[01:07:42.116 --> 01:07:44.398]  Can you imagine how bad it is for folks in the poor part of town?
[01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:44.959]  It's even worse.
[01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:46.660]  It's where they test this stuff out.
[01:07:48.081 --> 01:07:51.884]  And I'm walking back from the convenience store with some Blue Bell ice cream and Gatorade.
[01:07:52.064 --> 01:07:52.624]  I still remember.
[01:07:52.644 --> 01:07:53.565]  And the cops pull over.
[01:07:54.225 --> 01:07:55.426]  And they go, let us see your ID.
[01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.687]  And I said, I don't have one.
[01:07:56.727 --> 01:07:57.468]  Why don't you have one?
[01:07:57.508 --> 01:07:58.268]  I could arrest you for one.
[01:07:58.288 --> 01:08:00.190]  Well, I live right there in those apartments.
[01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.010]  Which apartment?
[01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:03.332]  Well, I live in, I think it was 107.
[01:08:03.952 --> 01:08:04.913]  I live in 107.
[01:08:05.954 --> 01:08:08.075]  Well, right over there off of Greystone.
[01:08:09.196 --> 01:08:10.957]  And literally, I'm like 100 yards from my apartment.
[01:08:10.977 --> 01:08:13.239]  Because the convenience store was right behind it.
[01:08:14.301 --> 01:08:15.302]  But those details don't matter.
[01:08:15.322 --> 01:08:16.843]  The point is, and I said, are you looking for somebody?
[01:08:16.863 --> 01:08:17.623]  I was trying to be helpful.
[01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:19.224]  I said, do I look like somebody?
[01:08:19.504 --> 01:08:20.125]  No, you don't!
[01:08:21.806 --> 01:08:23.587]  I'm doing the talking here, you know, something like that.
[01:08:23.607 --> 01:08:25.008]  It's just real rude.
[01:08:25.088 --> 01:08:26.349]  One cop was nice, one cop was mean.
[01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:27.390]  They're playing good cop, bad cop.
[01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:30.352]  And I just said, well, I'm going then.
[01:08:31.212 --> 01:08:33.013]  Hey, I could arrest you for failure to ID.
[01:08:35.075 --> 01:08:38.317]  Now, these have all been thrown out, federally, state level.
[01:08:39.267 --> 01:08:40.608]  But they just continue.
[01:08:40.648 --> 01:08:42.449]  Here in Austin it's been thrown out several times.
[01:08:42.489 --> 01:08:47.791]  There's a Supreme Court case from Texas, it was around 20 years ago, that I've read.
[01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:48.852]  From Austin.
[01:08:50.432 --> 01:08:55.435]  And they just keep doing it, keep doing it, and they use our tax money to pay off a few lawsuits that come of it.
[01:08:55.475 --> 01:08:58.456]  But it is a violation of our rights.
[01:08:58.556 --> 01:08:59.237]  It is illegal.
[01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:01.077]  It is false arrest.
[01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.158]  It is false imprisonment.
[01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:08.801]  And all over the country, oh it's for drunk drivers, oh it's for criminals, oh it's to look for contraband, oh it's to look for drugs.
[01:09:09.262 --> 01:09:25.814]  I've been in these checkpoints, I've shot video where they shut all of I-35 down, and they're looking in the car, searching the cars, arresting people, looking for excuses to pull you over, and now they say, oh well, we pull over every third car, so that isn't, since it's totally random, it's not profiling, so it's okay.
[01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.696]  No, that's even worse!
[01:09:29.097 --> 01:09:29.697]  That's even worse!
[01:09:31.326 --> 01:09:35.510]  When you just admit there's absolutely no probable cause, you're just randomly searching.
[01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:44.777]  Well, now the police chief out in Miami, and we read this yesterday on air, I've got it on the website, said, uh, we want you to know we're out there.
[01:09:44.797 --> 01:09:45.778]  We're going to be in your face.
[01:09:45.818 --> 01:09:50.202]  We're going to surround buildings and search everyone in it and check you, but this won't violate your rights.
[01:09:50.222 --> 01:09:53.645]  It's like saying, I'm going to shoot you five times in the head, but this won't hurt.
[01:09:54.326 --> 01:09:57.688]  I guess technically you're going to die, so it won't hurt in a millisecond.
[01:09:58.609 --> 01:09:59.510]  Uh, but, but, but,
[01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:02.111]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:10:03.592 --> 01:10:11.035]  And they're saying on the roads, and the banks, and the grocery stores, and the malls, on the buses, and again, everything that happens to you in the airport, that's going to be nationwide.
[01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:14.977]  TSA is training police all over the country to do this nationwide.
[01:10:15.518 --> 01:10:21.981]  But without further ado, she was in the news last week, and now they're going to be going to court over this.
[01:10:23.426 --> 01:10:24.446]  Meet Deborah Davis.
[01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:27.767]  She's a 50-year-old mother of four who lives and works in Denver, Colorado.
[01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:29.227]  Her kids are all grown up.
[01:10:29.247 --> 01:10:34.168]  Of course, she has a car, but suddenly she wanted to make a little bit of money, save some money by riding the bus.
[01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:36.829]  Her middle son is a soldier fighting in Iraq.
[01:10:37.949 --> 01:10:38.049]  Oh!
[01:10:39.609 --> 01:10:42.190]  That's probably how they're living over in Iraq, being checked at checkpoints.
[01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:49.171]  She leads an ordinary middle-class life you probably never would have heard of, Deborah Davis, if it weren't for her belief in the U.S.
[01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:49.791]  Constitution.
[01:10:53.962 --> 01:11:00.306]  On the morning of September 2005, she was riding a public bus to work.
[01:11:00.886 --> 01:11:13.473]  She was minding her own business, reading a book and planning for work, when a security guard got on this public bus and demanded that every passenger show their ID.
[01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:15.614]  Deborah, having done nothing wrong, declined.
[01:11:16.275 --> 01:11:23.299]  The guard called in federal cops and she was arrested and charged with federal criminal misdemeanors of refusing to show an ID on demand.
[01:11:24.193 --> 01:11:27.575]  On the 9th of December 2005, Deborah Davis will be arraigned in U.S.
[01:11:27.615 --> 01:11:38.783]  District Court in a case that will determine whether Deborah and the rest of us live in a free society or a country where we must show our papers whenever a cop demands them.
[01:11:39.844 --> 01:11:43.486]  And then I have the Rocky Mountain News saying, let her travel without her papers.
[01:11:45.207 --> 01:11:50.671]  And several other reports here where obviously the people in the press are supporting Deborah.
[01:11:51.312 --> 01:11:53.213]  And again, we're going to go to her right now.
[01:11:53.988 --> 01:12:00.394]  But you have to understand, folks, that this is because she was driving past or through one of these big federal complexes.
[01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:06.399]  And I have friends that have gone to jail or are in the process of going to prison, and the cops know this.
[01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:08.721]  They'll be driving along the edge of UT.
[01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:12.004]  And they pull them over and they go, do you have a concealed carry?
[01:12:12.224 --> 01:12:13.545]  Well, yes, sir, officer, I do.
[01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:14.967]  Get out of the car.
[01:12:15.227 --> 01:12:16.068]  Felony charges.
[01:12:17.922 --> 01:12:19.382]  People are driving past a school.
[01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:20.803]  100 yards from a school.
[01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:22.163]  Now they're even expanding it.
[01:12:22.563 --> 01:12:22.963]  Pull over.
[01:12:23.003 --> 01:12:23.843]  Got a concealed carry?
[01:12:23.883 --> 01:12:24.923]  Yes, officer, I do.
[01:12:25.403 --> 01:12:26.183]  Get out of the car.
[01:12:26.323 --> 01:12:27.064]  You're going to prison.
[01:12:28.704 --> 01:12:31.264]  And, I mean, folks, I have a friend who went to jail.
[01:12:31.304 --> 01:12:32.225]  He had to spend six months.
[01:12:32.605 --> 01:12:37.465]  I have another one who's got a lot of money and fancy lawyers, no criminal record, owns a computer company.
[01:12:37.505 --> 01:12:39.446]  He's worth millions of dollars.
[01:12:41.386 --> 01:12:44.087]  He's battling for his freedom, folks.
[01:12:44.707 --> 01:12:46.027]  Same thing, driving by a
[01:12:47.248 --> 01:12:50.489]  State installation, which under federal law.
[01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.650]  So, you know, the country's gone, folks.
[01:12:53.531 --> 01:12:55.591]  Let's go to Deborah Davis.
[01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:57.992]  So, Deborah, thanks for holding during my four-minute diatribe.
[01:12:58.012 --> 01:12:58.753]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:12:59.093 --> 01:12:59.533]  Oh, thank you.
[01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:04.426]  Now, I've read other press reports that get into more details.
[01:13:04.826 --> 01:13:16.548]  The first time you went along with it, but then the next day, he did this again, and I want you to just run through what happened, how they called you in, how they handcuffed you, what they said to you, exactly what developed.
[01:13:16.588 --> 01:13:17.528]  Go through it for us, please.
[01:13:17.988 --> 01:13:18.629]  Okay.
[01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:28.250]  The first day on my way to work, they stopped, the guard got on at the gate to the Federal Center and asked everybody for their IDs, and I was really surprised.
[01:13:28.531 --> 01:13:30.651]  I thought, geez, you know, and so I showed it to them.
[01:13:31.354 --> 01:13:41.079]  On the way home, the same thing happened, coming through the Federal Center from the other direction, and the guard got on, your ID, and I pulled mine out and showed it to him, and he got off.
[01:13:41.979 --> 01:13:47.522]  And then I didn't take my ID after that, because I thought, you know, I'm not required to carry papers.
[01:13:48.082 --> 01:13:50.103]  You know, I'm not going to even have them with me.
[01:13:50.183 --> 01:13:52.644]  I'm just trying to read a book, you know, just leave me alone.
[01:13:53.264 --> 01:13:58.047]  And I'm not getting off at the Federal Center, and so I thought, I don't even have to have anything with me.
[01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:05.491]  When they asked me, probably for the next two weeks, I would just say, I don't have any.
[01:14:05.631 --> 01:14:07.172]  They'd say, well, are you getting off at the FedEx?
[01:14:07.232 --> 01:14:07.832]  And I'd say, no.
[01:14:07.872 --> 01:14:08.592]  And they'd say, okay.
[01:14:08.632 --> 01:14:09.672]  And then they would go on.
[01:14:09.692 --> 01:14:11.892]  Sometimes they'd talk to the bus driver.
[01:14:13.153 --> 01:14:17.954]  And then one Friday on my way home, the guard said, I said, I don't have my ID.
[01:14:18.494 --> 01:14:22.575]  And he said, well, you've been on this bus long enough that you know you're supposed to have an ID.
[01:14:22.655 --> 01:14:24.595]  You better have it the next time you're going to have to get off.
[01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:32.386]  Apparently I've never seen anybody have to get off because I only go like three times a week or so for only a month.
[01:14:32.846 --> 01:14:39.070]  Now this is a major bus that runs quite a way through Denver and it goes through this complex.
[01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:39.891]  Right, right.
[01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:40.849]  Right.
[01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:43.812]  It's like a government office building.
[01:14:44.072 --> 01:14:47.995]  You know, it's not like Rocky Flats or NORAD or... No, I understand.
[01:14:48.056 --> 01:14:50.177]  I read the type of agencies that are there.
[01:14:50.438 --> 01:14:51.519]  It's milk toast.
[01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:52.039]  Right.
[01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:52.840]  Well, yeah.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.421]  Social Security, stuff like that.
[01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:54.681]  Right.
[01:14:54.721 --> 01:14:58.585]  I mean, I've gone in there and gotten a USGS map before, you know.
[01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:01.550]  Showing my ID in a car, you know, going through.
[01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:04.352]  Well, see, that's a green zone.
[01:15:04.372 --> 01:15:06.753]  You're going, this is occupied America.
[01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:09.935]  You're going into a... Yeah, it's open to the public.
[01:15:10.175 --> 01:15:12.596]  But you're going into the occupied command zone.
[01:15:12.616 --> 01:15:13.917]  You've got to learn to be a proper slave.
[01:15:14.157 --> 01:15:16.518]  Oh, yeah, whatever.
[01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:17.639]  I don't think so.
[01:15:18.039 --> 01:15:23.342]  But anyways, I spent that weekend, you know, investigating if the Constitution had changed since I was in 8th grade.
[01:15:23.402 --> 01:15:24.783]  And I found out it hadn't.
[01:15:25.043 --> 01:15:27.764]  One thing did change was that you do have to
[01:15:29.511 --> 01:15:30.392]  Identify yourself.
[01:15:30.472 --> 01:15:36.416]  If a police officer asks you who you are, you can say something, but you have to tell them.
[01:15:36.476 --> 01:15:39.318]  Well, actually, that law has been thrown out thousands of times.
[01:15:39.338 --> 01:15:39.938]  Oh, has it?
[01:15:40.378 --> 01:15:41.739]  You still have a Fifth Amendment.
[01:15:41.799 --> 01:15:44.201]  Deborah, you don't have to answer their questions.
[01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:45.502]  An ax murderer doesn't have to.
[01:15:45.922 --> 01:15:47.023]  Well, that's good to know.
[01:15:48.886 --> 01:15:50.426]  I was prepared to tell him who I was.
[01:15:50.486 --> 01:15:53.367]  They're already telling us that the Second Amendment isn't a right.
[01:15:53.427 --> 01:15:56.168]  He's always pushing the envelope.
[01:15:56.548 --> 01:15:58.128]  Go ahead.
[01:15:58.488 --> 01:16:02.489]  I just decided I have a right to carry my ID, even.
[01:16:04.109 --> 01:16:06.190]  I did have it with me on that Monday.
[01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:10.551]  He asked me, the guard came on the bus and said, do you have an ID?
[01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:11.111]  I said yes.
[01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:11.971]  He said, can I see it?
[01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:12.371]  I said no.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.441]  And he was kind of surprised.
[01:16:14.581 --> 01:16:16.843]  And he said, well, then you're going to have to get off the bus.
[01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:18.044]  And I said, no, I don't think so.
[01:16:18.084 --> 01:16:20.145]  I'm on a public bus going to work.
[01:16:20.625 --> 01:16:21.586]  I'm not doing anything.
[01:16:22.647 --> 01:16:26.029]  So he said, well, I'm going to, you know, see.
[01:16:26.089 --> 01:16:33.675]  And he got off the bus and brought a federal cop on and then went through the same thing.
[01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:34.696]  No, I'm not getting off.
[01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.137]  And I said, do you have a search warrant?
[01:16:36.157 --> 01:16:37.198]  Reason to suspect me.
[01:16:37.258 --> 01:16:37.458]  No.
[01:16:38.158 --> 01:16:40.160]  So he got off and he got the
[01:16:41.124 --> 01:16:46.647]  Another federal policeman they both got on and I was on my cell phone by then because I was a little nervous.
[01:16:46.767 --> 01:16:49.728]  By the way, once you get to court, Debra, this is going to be 101.
[01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:54.750]  The failure to ID has been thrown out literally thousands of times.
[01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.411]  You have thousands of court cases.
[01:16:56.891 --> 01:16:57.792]  So that's a fraud.
[01:16:58.052 --> 01:16:58.972]  You'll beat them right there.
[01:16:59.052 --> 01:17:02.934]  Also, you can put that cop on the stand in front of witnesses that were on the bus, especially.
[01:17:03.554 --> 01:17:07.477]  And say, did you admit you have no probable cause, no suspicion?
[01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:09.158]  I mean, you've got them hands down.
[01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:17.464]  Of course, Denver is the very place where a federal judge said, I don't follow the Constitution, so... Well, I mean, I'm not nervous about that.
[01:17:17.484 --> 01:17:19.206]  So now they get three people on the bus, right?
[01:17:19.226 --> 01:17:19.766]  Three cops.
[01:17:20.006 --> 01:17:20.206]  Right.
[01:17:20.267 --> 01:17:22.188]  Well, two cops and a security guard.
[01:17:23.289 --> 01:17:26.211]  And then, you know, I wouldn't hang up my cell phone.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.801]  I don't know.
[01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:45.529]  If they just said, would you please come with us, I wouldn't have.
[01:17:45.549 --> 01:17:48.172]  Well, I mean, even the Nazis didn't grab your stuff and throw it up against the wall.
[01:17:48.192 --> 01:17:49.513]  They just took you and killed you.
[01:17:49.733 --> 01:17:54.057]  No, it's like, no, I'm not, I don't even look dangerous, you know?
[01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:57.721]  No, I understand, but if somebody violently throws your phone across the room, could've hit somebody.
[01:17:59.182 --> 01:17:59.682]  Then what happened?
[01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:02.783]  I grabbed her and they both each grabbed an arm and jerked me on my feet.
[01:18:02.823 --> 01:18:08.705]  I saw this in the paper, he yells at grabber like you're a giant Al Qaeda or something.
[01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:10.145]  Yeah, no I'm not.
[01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:11.645]  And I wasn't firm.
[01:18:11.785 --> 01:18:13.326]  I wasn't aggressive.
[01:18:13.386 --> 01:18:14.226]  I wasn't belligerent.
[01:18:14.246 --> 01:18:15.626]  I wasn't rude.
[01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:16.647]  I was firm.
[01:18:16.787 --> 01:18:17.747]  I was assertive.
[01:18:18.247 --> 01:18:20.568]  Which they cannot stand.
[01:18:20.588 --> 01:18:22.188]  No, I'm not giving you my ID.
[01:18:22.328 --> 01:18:23.529]  I am not getting off the bus.
[01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:24.709]  I'm just trying to go to work.
[01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:27.340]  Well, how would he like this happening to his wife?
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.681]  And I'm sure he'd say, I like it, it keeps her safe.
[01:18:30.001 --> 01:18:30.622]  No, it doesn't.
[01:18:30.682 --> 01:18:31.182]  No, it doesn't.
[01:18:31.282 --> 01:18:31.982]  See, that's the thing.
[01:18:32.002 --> 01:18:33.303]  They weren't taking my name down.
[01:18:33.343 --> 01:18:35.064]  They weren't anybody's name down.
[01:18:35.464 --> 01:18:38.306]  They weren't comparing it to any kind of... Yeah, no, that was even in the paper.
[01:18:38.386 --> 01:18:41.227]  In fact, everybody just holds them up and then, okay, alright.
[01:18:41.587 --> 01:18:45.910]  And I've also read that if there's illegal aliens on there, they kind of leave them alone.
[01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.110]  It's like an unspoken rule.
[01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:48.811]  Oh, we don't do anything to them.
[01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:50.792]  It's just the citizens.
[01:18:50.812 --> 01:18:51.313]  Stay there, Debra.
[01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:51.893]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.707 --> 01:18:57.710]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:00.112]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?

[01:19:54.895 --> 01:19:59.419]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.844]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.144 --> 01:20:04.685]  We listened.
[01:20:05.005 --> 01:20:09.990]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.750]  We listened.
[01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.174]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.594 --> 01:20:15.135]  We listened.
[01:20:15.595 --> 01:20:18.538]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[01:20:18.558 --> 01:20:18.738]  I think?
[01:20:44.997 --> 01:20:46.481]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:20:46.501 --> 01:20:48.105]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:54.542 --> 01:20:56.783]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.203 --> 01:21:01.564]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:07.626]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.866 --> 01:21:11.928]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:17.409]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.769 --> 01:21:19.110]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:22.671 --> 01:21:26.572]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:28.992]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:29.332 --> 01:21:31.633]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:35.654]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:36.114 --> 01:21:42.315]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:42.755 --> 01:21:43.735]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:44.095 --> 01:21:44.416]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.436 --> 01:21:44.636]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[01:22:54.627 --> 01:22:59.770]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:02.731]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:10.064 --> 01:23:10.825]  Deborah Davis.
[01:23:13.107 --> 01:23:13.968]  No criminal record.
[01:23:14.028 --> 01:23:16.511]  Mother of happy children.
[01:23:18.032 --> 01:23:23.738]  Just tries to take the bus to save money on gas prices for the holidays that are coming up.
[01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:26.941]  And every day just getting hoarded around by some little goon.
[01:23:26.961 --> 01:23:31.065]  I love it whenever you read about how these goons half the time are like
[01:23:31.704 --> 01:23:37.828]  Members of extremist Muslim groups or gang members that are stealing jewelry from people, especially in the airports.
[01:23:37.848 --> 01:23:43.832]  But side issue, we're going to hold Debra about five minutes over to the next segment to take a call or two from Roger in Pennsylvania and others.
[01:23:43.872 --> 01:23:45.292]  But she's been so gracious to join us.
[01:23:46.413 --> 01:23:49.935]  And before we go any further, Debra, I want to thank you for your courage.
[01:23:50.376 --> 01:23:56.679]  What you're doing ensures to a greater extent that my children are going to grow up in a free society.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:00.662]  And if it wasn't for people like you, we'd be in a lot worse position right now.
[01:24:05.114 --> 01:24:07.555]  So I do want to thank you for all you've done and your courage.
[01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:08.916]  So now they grab you.
[01:24:09.516 --> 01:24:10.696]  What do they do when they grab you?
[01:24:10.736 --> 01:24:11.877]  He yells, grab her!
[01:24:11.957 --> 01:24:12.577]  What happened then?
[01:24:12.937 --> 01:24:17.899]  Well then they each grabbed me by an arm and marched me out the bus and handcuffed me.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:33.986]  Put me in the back of a police car and drove me across to the little police station there on the federal property and left me handcuffed while they agreed what to charge me with or talked and looked at computers or whatever they did.
[01:24:34.959 --> 01:24:38.980]  And then they threw what tickets down on the ground?
[01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:06.972]  When they took me outside, one of them threw him on the ground.
[01:25:06.992 --> 01:25:08.573]  Psychopaths!
[01:25:08.593 --> 01:25:13.577]  Just arrogant gang members!
[01:25:14.798 --> 01:25:20.521]  It was really humiliating, standing there watching these cars drive by and looking at me like I felt like a common criminal.
[01:25:20.541 --> 01:25:21.282]  You know, and I wasn't.
[01:25:24.881 --> 01:25:28.302]  I'm super knowledgeable about laws and everything, but I knew what the Constitution said.
[01:25:28.483 --> 01:25:34.445]  You need to file official complaints on the goons, and even if you don't win, you need to sue them.
[01:25:34.985 --> 01:25:37.326]  They can beat the rep, they can't beat the ride.
[01:25:37.767 --> 01:25:41.628]  They won't be laughing at you anymore after they're going bankrupt.
[01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.389]  Well, yeah, I don't know about that.
[01:25:44.529 --> 01:25:47.051]  I just know that I don't have to show ID.
[01:25:47.251 --> 01:25:51.072]  I'm not required as an American citizen, so far, to carry papers.
[01:25:51.232 --> 01:25:52.673]  And that's what I'm hoping, you know, that
[01:25:53.382 --> 01:26:00.748]  That not just public transportation will become ID-less, but, you know, that people really begin standing up.
[01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.130]  Well, this is even worse, though.
[01:26:03.731 --> 01:26:06.513]  I hadn't read that they threw your papers down.
[01:26:06.553 --> 01:26:08.875]  I mean, describe it for us, Deborah.
[01:26:08.895 --> 01:26:15.961]  Well, the one just said, since you don't seem to give a f***, I'm not going to bother to read these to you.
[01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:16.922]  You can read them yourself.
[01:26:18.277 --> 01:26:21.238]  You know, and the other one was unhandcuffing me.
[01:26:21.518 --> 01:26:27.520]  Yeah, well, let's not repeat what the officer said anymore, but for documentary purposes, that's on record now.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.301]  So, just, and then threw him on the ground.
[01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:30.801]  Right.
[01:26:31.861 --> 01:26:35.322]  Right, just threw him on the ground and said, you know, there's the bus stop.
[01:26:35.422 --> 01:26:37.183]  If you ever come back to me, you go to jail.
[01:26:37.203 --> 01:26:41.324]  If you ever end up on this property again, you go to jail.
[01:26:41.344 --> 01:26:43.164]  Yeah, no court order, no nothing.
[01:26:43.184 --> 01:26:45.065]  See, now you pay for that property.
[01:26:45.703 --> 01:26:48.385]  Which is this imperial base, but now you can't come on it.
[01:26:48.845 --> 01:26:49.105]  Right.
[01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:50.006]  Right.
[01:26:50.346 --> 01:26:53.007]  Well, I can't ride a public bus through there.
[01:26:53.027 --> 01:26:54.188]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:26:54.989 --> 01:26:57.150]  You know, it might be one thing that they check an ID.
[01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:59.851]  I don't know whether, you know, I don't know anything about that.
[01:26:59.971 --> 01:27:03.534]  All I know is that I was going on a public bus.
[01:27:04.114 --> 01:27:05.094]  I wasn't getting off.
[01:27:05.615 --> 01:27:06.936]  I had done nothing wrong.
[01:27:08.036 --> 01:27:09.577]  I wasn't suspected of anything.
[01:27:10.538 --> 01:27:12.599]  You know, I've had speeding tickets, that's all.
[01:27:14.922 --> 01:27:18.203]  Did you know that in just a few years they won't even need that?
[01:27:18.823 --> 01:27:22.364]  All the new Visas and MasterCards are going to have little tracker chips in them.
[01:27:22.824 --> 01:27:29.005]  The readers are already going in nationwide, and the police can automatically just scan off that, so it's even worse.
[01:27:29.145 --> 01:27:31.445]  Yeah, that very much disturbs me.
[01:27:32.465 --> 01:27:38.127]  Well, people just better not use these, and they better demand the old system, and better use cash as much as you can, folks.
[01:27:41.454 --> 01:27:42.375]  I don't know.
[01:27:42.435 --> 01:27:44.296]  Now you're facing, I guess, jail time.
[01:27:44.336 --> 01:27:44.996]  You're going to court.
[01:27:45.456 --> 01:27:47.257]  Yep, I'm looking at 60 days.
[01:27:48.358 --> 01:27:48.818]  So far.
[01:27:48.838 --> 01:27:52.960]  60 days of what I know right now.
[01:27:54.101 --> 01:27:56.942]  But my arraignment's not until December 9th.
[01:27:57.042 --> 01:27:58.603]  They could change the charges.
[01:27:59.855 --> 01:28:02.596]  They could drop them, they could up them, they could do whatever they want.
[01:28:02.896 --> 01:28:05.817]  Well, they may try to get you to plea bargain, but frankly, I hope you don't.
[01:28:05.997 --> 01:28:08.098]  No, they already did, and I said no.
[01:28:08.478 --> 01:28:08.838]  No way.
[01:28:09.138 --> 01:28:09.919]  Oh, good!
[01:28:09.959 --> 01:28:11.379]  Describe that meeting for us, please.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.441]  Oh, I just, you know, they just offered me a plea, and I... That's it.
[01:28:18.022 --> 01:28:19.342]  Why don't you offer them a plea?
[01:28:19.802 --> 01:28:20.242]  I'm sorry?
[01:28:20.863 --> 01:28:22.523]  You want to offer them a plea?
[01:28:22.783 --> 01:28:24.504]  Well, yeah, something needs to happen.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:25.901]  Well, stay there.
[01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:31.985]  I want to talk about some of the websites folks can visit, how we can try to support you, Debra, and then take a call or two on the other side.
[01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:32.866]  Can you do that with us?
[01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:35.087]  Let me see if I have some time, okay?
[01:28:35.207 --> 01:28:35.488]  Okay, great.
[01:28:35.548 --> 01:28:36.508]  I might not have enough time.
[01:28:36.668 --> 01:28:37.969]  If you don't, that's going to be alright.
[01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:39.390]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:44.574 --> 01:28:45.515]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.955 --> 01:28:47.576]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.477 --> 01:28:51.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.164 --> 01:28:56.145]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.

[01:28:59.266 --> 01:29:04.649]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:29:04.889 --> 01:29:06.410]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:08.691]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:12.433]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:29:12.773 --> 01:29:13.033]  I don't know.
[01:29:35.472 --> 01:29:38.414]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.

[01:30:58.073 --> 01:30:59.394]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:30:59.835 --> 01:31:02.537]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:31:02.978 --> 01:31:05.640]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:31:06.081 --> 01:31:12.546]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:31:35.918 --> 01:31:37.418]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:48.883]  Oh, some have been forgotten.

[01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:53.046]  Okay.
[01:31:54.888 --> 01:32:06.017]  Our guest, Deborah Davis, has to leave us here in just a few minutes, but I wanted to give you the website that's been set up
[01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:29.293]  So you can support her and learn more about her case and that's Papers Please PapersPlease.org and we have a link to it up on InfoWars.com Debra, I want to thank you for coming on with us today.
[01:32:29.593 --> 01:32:30.214]  Well, thank you.
[01:32:30.614 --> 01:32:32.956]  And I want to thank you again for standing up.
[01:32:33.016 --> 01:32:37.360]  If more people did this, they couldn't get away with this.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:38.401]  Do you believe
[01:32:39.697 --> 01:32:40.258]  As I do?
[01:32:40.278 --> 01:32:47.743]  Or do you disagree that the government is attempting to condition us and train us to accept basically not having any rights?
[01:32:48.303 --> 01:32:48.904]  I don't know.
[01:32:48.924 --> 01:32:50.285]  I don't know about that.
[01:32:50.305 --> 01:32:51.305]  I don't know.
[01:32:51.325 --> 01:32:53.527]  I just know that I don't have to carry papers.
[01:32:54.007 --> 01:32:56.609]  I'm just trying to get to work on a public bus system.
[01:32:57.546 --> 01:33:02.647]  Without being searched by the Gestapo, let's take a call quickly from Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:04.868]  Roger, she's got to go here in a second, so make it quick.
[01:33:04.948 --> 01:33:21.893]  Yeah, well, please not too quick, because there's two separate... I wish it was all cut and dry, but there's two separate issues, which I'm not sure how to disentangle, and that is of the rights to private property and the ability to control its policies in using that property, and then the issue of compliance with law.
[01:33:22.553 --> 01:33:26.834]  And I would remind you that in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which follows
[01:33:27.509 --> 01:33:33.433]  Rosa Parks, that was very brilliant, that boycott, and that's really what brought the establishment to its knees.
[01:33:33.933 --> 01:33:39.116]  But that did not validate Rosa Parks' initial act, per se.
[01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:47.061]  Now is the bus company privately owned, and or is it heavily subsidized by your tax dollars, so they take the
[01:33:47.628 --> 01:33:56.914]  ...poison fruit, and therefore they can no longer force these policies... Hey, regardless, Roger, I mean, now in Miami they're going to be on the side of the street doing it and around shopping malls.
[01:33:57.214 --> 01:34:04.379]  Regardless, it's un-American, it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and people can try to namby-pamby around all day long.
[01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:05.700]  This is a fraud.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.580]  This is wrong.
[01:34:07.081 --> 01:34:10.183]  It sounds like you're just basically preaching at her.
[01:34:10.223 --> 01:34:10.843]  She's got to go.
[01:34:11.163 --> 01:34:13.445]  Oh, if you don't follow proper principles... Yeah, I'm sorry, Jack, I need to go.
[01:34:13.525 --> 01:34:14.626]  I mean, Alex, I need to go?
[01:34:14.746 --> 01:34:15.426]  Yeah, she's got to go.
[01:34:15.446 --> 01:34:16.547]  Okay, I've got another appointment.
[01:34:16.967 --> 01:34:17.427]  I understand.
[01:34:17.647 --> 01:34:18.428]  Thanks a lot, Roger.
[01:34:18.968 --> 01:34:19.568]  I appreciate it.
[01:34:19.608 --> 01:34:20.008]  Take care.
[01:34:20.288 --> 01:34:22.149]  Yeah, I told you, Roger, she really did have to go.
[01:34:22.169 --> 01:34:26.530]  So if you had one quick question or one quick comment, she had to go.
[01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:29.812]  She had another radio interview that they just held up five minutes for us.
[01:34:30.532 --> 01:34:38.795]  So I'm not trying to be rude to you, Roger, but you said you had a question for her and it was just kind of a... I understand what your statement is, but obviously,
[01:34:41.256 --> 01:34:43.517]  These general conveyances down the road.
[01:34:44.117 --> 01:34:46.797]  Look, this is a 10 hour discussion right here.
[01:34:46.837 --> 01:34:48.318]  I happen to know the law on this.
[01:34:48.678 --> 01:34:50.258]  I happen to know the case law on this.
[01:34:50.598 --> 01:34:56.679]  I happen to have studied this and researched this and interviewed scores of guests over the years on this subject.
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:08.262]  The government and their enforcers, their magistrates, their minions say that it's a privilege to travel, a privilege to drive down the road in your automobile.
[01:35:10.277 --> 01:35:10.798]  It is not.
[01:35:11.738 --> 01:35:23.649]  The laws were erected for large trucks engaging in commerce on the roads, and they told the public, hey, you're having to pay for these roads, but these rich trucks are making money off of it.
[01:35:23.929 --> 01:35:25.751]  The railroad's got to pay for the railway.
[01:35:25.831 --> 01:35:27.552]  Shouldn't the trucks have to pay for the road?
[01:35:29.494 --> 01:35:31.335]  And so 80 years ago, licensing started.
[01:35:35.223 --> 01:35:35.683]  Okay?
[01:35:36.164 --> 01:35:40.726]  Around 1925 or so, and it was on a city by city basis and a state by state basis.
[01:35:41.007 --> 01:35:43.568]  We didn't even have driver's licenses in those states until the 50s.
[01:35:44.469 --> 01:35:49.712]  And then it was a piece of paper showing you'd simply passed the exam to drive for safety.
[01:35:52.093 --> 01:35:54.235]  And so it's camel's nose under the tent flap.
[01:35:55.475 --> 01:35:56.936]  But notice we were a lot safer back then.
[01:35:57.196 --> 01:36:00.839]  You see, the more Big Brother and the more police state we have, the worse things get.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:02.960]  It's that simple.
[01:36:04.361 --> 01:36:16.826]  And, uh, yes, no, these bus companies are, of course, privately managed, and always in some sweetheart scam deal with these major cities, but they are city entities and with city powers.
[01:36:17.406 --> 01:36:21.768]  But, uh, the debate about, you know, they're driving through a federal complex.
[01:36:21.788 --> 01:36:24.309]  I understand it's a big office park, big part of the city.
[01:36:24.489 --> 01:36:27.170]  It's just, it's like here with the University of Texas.
[01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:31.012]  They tell you you're going on a state property and it's just major roads of Austin.
[01:36:32.233 --> 01:36:32.954]  That drive through it.
[01:36:33.494 --> 01:36:35.556]  And if you've got a concealed carry, they're going to pull you over.
[01:36:35.576 --> 01:36:37.257]  You're going to spend years in prison.
[01:36:38.578 --> 01:36:39.459]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:36:39.479 --> 01:36:40.280]  She's driving through.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.441]  This goon gets on board.
[01:36:41.821 --> 01:36:42.742]  TSA trained.
[01:36:42.782 --> 01:36:43.162]  Guaranteed.
[01:36:43.182 --> 01:36:45.344]  That's who trains these federal security guards.
[01:36:46.545 --> 01:36:47.426]  It's got a new name now.
[01:36:47.466 --> 01:36:49.567]  They just abolished the TSA a few months ago.
[01:36:49.607 --> 01:36:52.750]  But the point is, they go on board.
[01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:58.254]  A point she made to a newspaper is that everybody just basically holds their ID cards up.
[01:36:59.015 --> 01:37:00.256]  This guy doesn't even look at them.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.202]  He's just been told, you go in there and have them show their IDs.
[01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:08.566]  And again, that comes down the line to condition the public to accept this.
[01:37:09.667 --> 01:37:10.668]  It's just that simple.
[01:37:11.348 --> 01:37:16.733]  All right, we're going to go to George and Cliff and Mike and everybody else.
[01:37:16.753 --> 01:37:21.017]  We've got an hour and 22 minutes right now left in the broadcast.
[01:37:21.057 --> 01:37:24.880]  There is so much news that needs to be covered.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:29.564]  But in the news, home prices have hit
[01:37:30.425 --> 01:37:31.586]  Record levels again.
[01:37:32.926 --> 01:37:41.570]  They're hitting record levels in the amount of homes being sold, the price of those homes.
[01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:45.031]  Just every major indice is that it's out of control.
[01:37:45.331 --> 01:37:47.612]  But what did the Associated Press say on top of that?
[01:37:48.012 --> 01:37:50.333]  Oh, this is probably the end, the last hurrah.
[01:37:50.653 --> 01:37:51.674]  It's going to burst.
[01:37:53.835 --> 01:38:00.856]  Why is the outgoing Fed Chairman bouncing up and down every day, yelling, it's going to burst, it's going to burst, it's going to implode, it's going to implode?
[01:38:01.296 --> 01:38:03.417]  Why are all the big financial publications saying this?
[01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:04.997]  Why do they want it to implode?
[01:38:07.297 --> 01:38:18.980]  Because even though real estate is in most areas way overpriced, people are putting money in it because they know the stock market, even though it's getting close to $11,000 again, is dangerous.
[01:38:22.609 --> 01:38:32.597]  is speculative, and they know that even if a house is selling for three times what it's worth, at least there's some real tangible value in it.
[01:38:34.118 --> 01:38:40.462]  And that's why the money is chasing the land, the homes, because that's where the real wealth comes from.
[01:38:40.522 --> 01:38:42.284]  It comes from the land, it comes from the sea.
[01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:46.607]  It comes from your labor with those materials.
[01:38:48.128 --> 01:38:51.751]  Real estate is a decent investment, though it's so expensive to get into right now
[01:38:52.958 --> 01:38:57.941]  That it prices out most people, and it may again be devalued by 89% in the next six months.
[01:38:58.061 --> 01:38:59.142]  I'm not even saying that's going to happen.
[01:38:59.382 --> 01:39:02.103]  They're trying to pop the bubble, but people just aren't listening to them.
[01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:08.587]  See, the globalists... People don't listen to the globalists anymore.
[01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.611]  And so, at many levels, they're unable to control things.
[01:39:16.512 --> 01:39:18.213]  Something else they've tried to badmouth,
[01:39:19.382 --> 01:39:22.624]  For the last 50 years plus is gold.
[01:39:23.185 --> 01:39:24.746]  Don't buy it, it's evil, it's bad.
[01:39:25.246 --> 01:39:40.236]  But the last few years, investors discovered that the Warren Buffets, the Bill Gateses, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers of the world, the big investment banks are not walking, they are running, foaming at the mouth to gold.
[01:39:41.737 --> 01:39:47.581]  Folks, I bought gold years ago that's almost doubled in value, and have I dumped it now for dollars?
[01:39:48.789 --> 01:39:49.390]  No, I haven't.
[01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:50.630]  I haven't done that.
[01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:52.992]  I haven't done that.
[01:39:53.652 --> 01:39:55.453]  I have held on to it, and I believe it.
[01:39:55.513 --> 01:39:56.634]  Here is Reuters.
[01:39:57.054 --> 01:39:58.695]  Gold above 500 in Asia.
[01:39:58.736 --> 01:39:59.236]  Platinum 1000.
[01:39:59.276 --> 01:40:00.397]  This is from yesterday.
[01:40:00.917 --> 01:40:14.706]  Gold rose above 500 an ounce in Asia on Tuesday for the first time since December 1987, as dealers and funds had diversified into precious metals on worries about inflation and geopolitical movements.
[01:40:15.367 --> 01:40:19.390]  Platinum reached the psychological 1000 ounce, hitting its highest price since 1980.
[01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.132]  Spot gold went to $502.75 an ounce.
[01:40:22.172 --> 01:40:22.752]  In adjusted U.S.
[01:40:23.012 --> 01:40:25.955]  numbers, spot platinum went to $1,003 an ounce.
[01:40:26.675 --> 01:40:27.556]  And it goes on and on.
[01:40:34.682 --> 01:40:35.202]  Well, guess what?
[01:40:35.222 --> 01:40:43.985]  Ted Anderson has gold for you, ladies and gentlemen, at very reasonable, fair prices, and you know it goes to supporting the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:44.005 --> 01:40:45.006]  He owns Modest Resources.
[01:40:45.046 --> 01:40:45.826]  He owns Genesis.
[01:40:46.606 --> 01:40:59.411]  And you also know that there is some collector value to the coins, so they're not confiscatable, and so you're getting collector coins at very near what Bullion is selling for.
[01:40:59.511 --> 01:41:00.511]  I personally have bought Bullion.
[01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:03.172]  Lately, I have been buying Semiprecious and
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.020]  What's the term?
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:06.621]  Semi-numismatic and numismatic.
[01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:13.103]  Because it has that added value, because you can get so many numismatic coins now at near bullion prices.
[01:41:13.143 --> 01:41:14.403]  So it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:41:14.724 --> 01:41:16.884]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us in studio.
[01:41:17.224 --> 01:41:19.045]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:41:19.105 --> 01:41:21.346]  What's the population in Austin, Texas right now?
[01:41:21.426 --> 01:41:21.646]  Do you know?
[01:41:23.266 --> 01:41:25.567]  Is it 600,000 or how many people you got down there?
[01:41:25.908 --> 01:41:26.728]  I'm having to think.
[01:41:26.788 --> 01:41:28.449]  I think it's 800 and something thousand.
[01:41:28.489 --> 01:41:35.914]  They still have the old signs up from 10 years ago on the highway, but it's about 800,000 in the city and another 300,000 or so in surrounding towns.
[01:41:35.954 --> 01:41:36.874]  We're well over a million.
[01:41:37.094 --> 01:41:39.215]  Well, here's the special that I have today.
[01:41:39.235 --> 01:41:42.497]  I'm going to go to the $10 gold piece.
[01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:46.300]  Currently, right now, I'm talking about the $10 Olympic coin that was issued by the U.S.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.340]  Mint in 1984.
[01:41:49.065 --> 01:41:56.737]  The reason why I picked on that coin right now is there are 600,000 total coins out there that have ever been minted and they shipped half of them overseas into Europe.
[01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:02.775]  That particular year to go to the people who are buying them in Europe for the commemorating the Olympics that particular time.
[01:42:03.235 --> 01:42:05.276]  It's the only $10 gold piece the U.S.
[01:42:05.336 --> 01:42:18.540]  Mint has ever issued as a commemorative and it is the first coin that the United States issued in gold since the confiscation in the 1930s as a commemorative piece, as a collector piece.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:23.102]  There are only 600,000 of these coins available right now and think about it back
[01:42:24.002 --> 01:42:27.364]  In 1980, you were mentioning that gold went up over $500 an ounce.
[01:42:27.885 --> 01:42:31.727]  This coin at that time was trading for $700 plus a coin.
[01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:36.049]  And right now I have the same exact coin at $364.
[01:42:36.089 --> 01:42:37.930]  Now think about it.
[01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:49.177]  If everybody in Austin, where you're at in the city that you're at right now, if everybody in Austin decided that they wanted to have one Olympic coin, there would be a shortage of 200,000 coins that wouldn't be available for people to get.
[01:42:49.744 --> 01:42:50.925]  They're not making them anymore.
[01:42:50.985 --> 01:42:52.026]  They've destroyed the dies.
[01:42:52.086 --> 01:42:52.927]  There is nothing left.
[01:42:52.987 --> 01:42:55.509]  This is the only $10 gold piece issued by the U.S.
[01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:55.769]  Mint.
[01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:58.812]  Back in the 1980s, I couldn't sell them in volume.
[01:42:59.292 --> 01:43:03.696]  And there's such a finite supply, and they're trading up in that $700 range.
[01:43:03.716 --> 01:43:05.898]  Like I said, it's just absolutely a steal.
[01:43:06.259 --> 01:43:09.601]  Now, we've been talking about $5 gold pieces to Alex here recently.
[01:43:10.762 --> 01:43:13.365]  They're practically completely sold out of the market.
[01:43:13.385 --> 01:43:15.787]  There's very little left in that particular area at all.
[01:43:16.226 --> 01:43:16.947]  You're right on that.
[01:43:16.987 --> 01:43:19.589]  Gold was over $500 an ounce just yesterday.
[01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:22.051]  I do have these in at $364.
[01:43:22.431 --> 01:43:26.274]  You can pick them up in half rolls of 10 or rolls of 20.
[01:43:26.334 --> 01:43:31.418]  The half rolls of 10 are $3,640 per 10 coins.
[01:43:32.059 --> 01:43:34.641]  I can't recommend it any more than I can.
[01:43:34.881 --> 01:43:39.645]  The only reason why I have supply right now, Alex, is because when gold got down to 200 and some an ounce,
[01:43:41.216 --> 01:43:43.978]  You know, there were times where you could accumulate these coins.
[01:43:44.439 --> 01:43:50.364]  Now, they're sitting there, there's not anything available, the prices are obviously being pressured upward.
[01:43:50.384 --> 01:44:00.072]  Basically, people are going to get prices from weeks and months ago, and then when these are gone, and Ted's back on in a few weeks, it's going to be a lot higher, and it's still going to be a good deal then.
[01:44:00.212 --> 01:44:02.253]  A lot higher, and that's the problem, Alex.
[01:44:02.273 --> 01:44:03.755]  You won't be able to get any quantity of them.
[01:44:03.775 --> 01:44:06.637]  There are only 600 of these total that have ever been minted.
[01:44:07.347 --> 01:44:14.037]  And now we're talking about if everybody in Austin, that one small city that you're in right now, I don't know what number that market is.
[01:44:14.097 --> 01:44:17.142]  It's in the hundreds, I suppose, in the United States.
[01:44:17.182 --> 01:44:18.224]  I mean, Minneapolis-St.
[01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:20.227]  Paul has 4 million people.
[01:44:20.826 --> 01:44:23.208]  I think Austin's like number 40 or something.
[01:44:23.328 --> 01:44:24.849]  Yeah, and then you go out to New York.
[01:44:24.869 --> 01:44:25.669]  Houston's number 4.
[01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:28.371]  San Antonio's number 10.
[01:44:28.411 --> 01:44:31.173]  I think Dallas's number is 5 or 6.
[01:44:31.293 --> 01:44:33.715]  You could even touch the population of Dallas.
[01:44:33.735 --> 01:44:37.397]  There would be just a small percentage of people that would be able to buy a coin like this in Dallas.
[01:44:37.697 --> 01:44:42.840]  So you think about that and how few coins there are and how hot gold is getting at this time.
[01:44:43.241 --> 01:44:44.922]  This is obviously a great buy.
[01:44:45.572 --> 01:44:51.053]  So basically, they're just a little bit more than bullion, which again is at raw melt price, or a little bit above.
[01:44:52.153 --> 01:44:56.875]  And so you're getting a... would this be considered semi-numismatic or numismatic?
[01:44:57.075 --> 01:45:01.516]  Well, it would be semi-numismatic because the majority of the value is tied into the bullion gold itself.
[01:45:01.596 --> 01:45:04.376]  But this is a coin that was issued specifically by the U.S.
[01:45:04.456 --> 01:45:05.296]  Mint as collector.
[01:45:05.696 --> 01:45:11.398]  So there is no way in the world that the United States government can come back and say, no, this is a bullion coin, we're going to confiscate it from you.
[01:45:11.718 --> 01:45:12.378]  Now every time...
[01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:14.730]  Somebody mentions this on the show.
[01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:17.571]  I get an email from somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about.
[01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.272]  They go, compensate gold?
[01:45:19.772 --> 01:45:21.072]  Our government's never done that.
[01:45:21.673 --> 01:45:24.213]  My grandmother remembers it, boys and girls.
[01:45:24.273 --> 01:45:25.074]  Ted, tell them about that.
[01:45:25.234 --> 01:45:26.994]  Well, that was Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[01:45:27.034 --> 01:45:29.335]  I mean, he was elected into office on a weekend.
[01:45:29.355 --> 01:45:30.696]  The banks had lines waiting.
[01:45:30.716 --> 01:45:31.956]  You know, they're closing.
[01:45:32.876 --> 01:45:34.277]  1933?
[01:45:33.097 --> 01:45:34.277]  Yeah, 1933.
[01:45:34.317 --> 01:45:36.899]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt confiscated gold on a weekend.
[01:45:36.939 --> 01:45:38.340]  It became illegal on a Monday.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:43.043]  You had a $10,000 fine and or 10 years imprisonment if you were caught with gold at that time.
[01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:45.885]  They confiscated it from the people at $22 an ounce.
[01:45:45.925 --> 01:45:46.645]  I'll tell you a story.
[01:45:46.685 --> 01:45:49.887]  I had a great-grandfather who was able to buy a bunch of land.
[01:45:49.907 --> 01:45:51.588]  That's why I've said I'll try to duplicate that.
[01:45:52.009 --> 01:45:54.790]  Because when the gold confiscation took place, he didn't turn it in.
[01:45:55.571 --> 01:45:58.753]  And boy, he was able to sell that for quite a bit on the black market.
[01:45:59.272 --> 01:46:00.793]  Yeah, that's just the thing.
[01:46:01.014 --> 01:46:04.597]  And then gold stayed illegal all the way through 1974.
[01:46:04.997 --> 01:46:11.703]  So for 48 years or whatever it is, 49 years, we couldn't have gold here in the United States.
[01:46:11.723 --> 01:46:12.504]  You couldn't buy it.
[01:46:12.544 --> 01:46:13.324]  You couldn't sell it.
[01:46:13.564 --> 01:46:14.926]  It was like trading cocaine.
[01:46:14.986 --> 01:46:15.606]  It was illegal.
[01:46:15.626 --> 01:46:16.287]  It was a felony.
[01:46:16.947 --> 01:46:18.348]  People don't believe that, though, Ted.
[01:46:18.368 --> 01:46:19.608]  They're actually laughing right now.
[01:46:19.788 --> 01:46:28.790]  Well, if you want to do it, just if you don't believe it, call in to the number and ask for the Executive Order of Franklin Delano Roosevelt of 1933 and read it in black and white.
[01:46:29.331 --> 01:46:29.971]  That's right!
[01:46:29.991 --> 01:46:39.073]  A friend of mine, or an ex-friend of mine, actually had that hanging on his wall, the original 1933 Executive Order, hanging on his wall.
[01:46:39.113 --> 01:46:41.194]  Folks, you need to get this now.
[01:46:41.214 --> 01:46:43.955]  Now, Ted, do you have any of the $5 pieces left?
[01:46:46.008 --> 01:46:47.209]  Very few in supply.
[01:46:47.249 --> 01:46:48.049]  We do have those at $167.
[01:46:48.429 --> 01:46:53.652]  I was just talking to one of my suppliers and I said, can you get me a bunch of these?
[01:46:53.692 --> 01:46:57.675]  He says, no, you better, if you're going to be going on the radio, better talk about $10 gold pieces.
[01:46:58.115 --> 01:47:00.676]  So if you want to get the fives, you can ask for them.
[01:47:00.937 --> 01:47:02.918]  There may be 20, 30 coins available.
[01:47:03.358 --> 01:47:10.102]  But these $10 gold pieces, as far as I'm concerned, I was really glad he had a good supply of those because this is really a good buy too.
[01:47:10.542 --> 01:47:12.503]  Alex, like I said, $600,000 total mintage.
[01:47:14.777 --> 01:47:15.718]  Actually, that's a rough number.
[01:47:15.738 --> 01:47:18.300]  It's probably 635,000 total mintage.
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:19.081]  But that's it!
[01:47:19.581 --> 01:47:21.182]  There isn't more to go around after that.
[01:47:21.222 --> 01:47:23.424]  And like I said... And you're getting these at a really great deal.
[01:47:23.584 --> 01:47:32.050]  Let's give folks the toll-free number to call in and talk to Midas Resources and tell them it's the Alex Jones Special to take advantage of the previous price.
[01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:32.531]  Right, Ted?
[01:47:32.611 --> 01:47:32.791]  Yep.
[01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:33.592]  You can call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:47:33.692 --> 01:47:33.892]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:47:42.189 --> 01:48:04.315]  2237 ask about the $10 gold pieces and once again I mean that this is lower than the US Mint issued them originally when people actually bought them right out of the Mint and that's how you had to get them so you're actually getting a better price than them in addition to this they're over $700 an ounce or $700 a piece back in the 1980s when gold was at $500 so when we have $500 gold right now and you can pick them up at $364 a coin
[01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:07.551]  It's a great buy, folks.
[01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:08.271]  It really is.
[01:48:08.331 --> 01:48:10.573]  We have a situation going on in the economics.
[01:48:10.873 --> 01:48:13.475]  You know, you're talking about the real estate market.
[01:48:13.495 --> 01:48:18.418]  I mean, that market is probably 92 to 96 percent leverage.
[01:48:18.939 --> 01:48:21.821]  And the little tiny sliver... Well, that's what's dangerous about it.
[01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:24.082]  It's not that real estate is a bad investment.
[01:48:24.102 --> 01:48:27.125]  It's that the people that are doing it are doing it speculatively.
[01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:31.067]  And when the bubble does burst, it's going to be disastrous.
[01:48:31.508 --> 01:48:34.590]  And that's when you need to be in the position, folks, to get some real estate.
[01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:37.594]  Of course, things may get so bad in the future that it won't even matter.
[01:48:49.872 --> 01:48:51.173]  Well Ted, it's simple.
[01:48:51.453 --> 01:48:56.795]  Even if gold goes down to $400 an ounce, which it obviously isn't in the near future, it doesn't matter.
[01:48:56.835 --> 01:48:58.395]  You still have something that's gold.
[01:48:58.455 --> 01:48:58.875]  It's real.
[01:48:58.935 --> 01:49:00.196]  It's not a piece of flimsy paper.
[01:49:00.496 --> 01:49:01.917]  Give them a call right now, folks.
[01:49:02.257 --> 01:49:03.017]  I believe in this.
[01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:04.077]  I believe in water filters.
[01:49:04.117 --> 01:49:05.698]  I believe in real things.
[01:49:05.758 --> 01:49:06.578]  Documentaries.
[01:49:06.638 --> 01:49:10.440]  I'm about real things, not magic cures or magic bullets or magic machines.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.302]  This is real stuff you need.
[01:49:12.322 --> 01:49:12.842]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:12.862 --> 01:49:14.244]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you right now.
[01:49:14.264 --> 01:49:14.324]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:14.344 --> 01:49:16.386]  If you missed that number, just go to GCNlive.com.
[01:49:16.406 --> 01:49:19.189]  We have links and phone numbers over to Midas Resources.
[01:49:27.237 --> 01:49:28.658]  Of course, there's ModestResources.com.
[01:49:28.958 --> 01:49:34.421]  Ted, thank you so much for coming on with us, and thanks for your great work having this network where we can tell the truth and get the word out.
[01:49:34.601 --> 01:49:36.842]  Thanks a lot for having me on, Alex.
[01:49:36.942 --> 01:49:37.883]  You bet.
[01:49:37.903 --> 01:49:37.923]  1-800.
[01:49:37.943 --> 01:49:39.504]  Here it is.
[01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:39.744]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:40.024 --> 01:49:40.324]  All right.
[01:49:40.444 --> 01:49:41.525]  I haven't taken a lot of calls lately.
[01:49:41.545 --> 01:49:42.666]  I've been having a lot of guests on.
[01:49:43.066 --> 01:49:47.448]  I will take calls rapid-fire for the rest of the broadcast with a smattering of news.
[01:49:47.828 --> 01:49:50.030]  We'll tell you about that news and take your calls when we get back.
[01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.690]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.415 --> 01:50:01.257]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.557 --> 01:50:02.937]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:03.137 --> 01:50:05.338]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.478 --> 01:50:07.578]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.839 --> 01:50:12.780]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.141]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:17.401 --> 01:50:19.182]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:19.262 --> 01:50:29.907]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.047 --> 01:50:31.948]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:32.148 --> 01:50:36.030]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:50:36.110 --> 01:50:37.531]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:50:37.591 --> 01:50:37.771]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:50:44.494 --> 01:50:48.158]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:50:48.458 --> 01:50:52.542]  I'll give them that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.063 --> 01:50:55.685]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.805 --> 01:50:59.949]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:51:00.049 --> 01:51:02.932]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:03.012 --> 01:51:09.698]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.898 --> 01:51:12.902]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:13.102 --> 01:51:15.485]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:15.646 --> 01:51:25.779]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apcozine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:26.740]  MTBE.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:27.260]  Radon 222.
[01:51:27.861 --> 01:51:29.842]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:35.107]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:51:35.267 --> 01:51:43.014]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.034 --> 01:51:43.254]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.274 --> 01:51:44.635]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:51:55.248 --> 01:51:55.588]  I think so.
[01:52:10.473 --> 01:52:11.133]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.006 --> 01:52:43.087]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.267 --> 01:52:49.249]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.951 --> 01:53:02.993]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:03.593 --> 01:53:06.554]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:10.811 --> 01:53:13.492]  George, Cliff, Norm, we're going to you, my friends.
[01:53:13.552 --> 01:53:19.433]  Everybody else who wants to get involved on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:20.834 --> 01:53:22.354]  I'm challenging myself today.
[01:53:22.394 --> 01:53:25.295]  I'm going to see if I can make myself take 20 calls in the next hour.
[01:53:27.029 --> 01:53:35.296]  And if I can keep the calls down to about a minute, minute and a half, and if I can keep my mouth shut and not add too much to it, but the callers are always great, and they always bring up great points.
[01:53:35.616 --> 01:53:41.801]  I felt bad cutting Roger off earlier, but the guest had to go, so sorry about that, Roger.
[01:53:43.522 --> 01:53:45.864]  And I get angry about this stuff as it unfolds.
[01:53:45.884 --> 01:53:48.206]  We've got a press release by the ACLU.
[01:53:48.246 --> 01:53:52.069]  They've been spanked severely for trying to be police state snakes.
[01:53:53.087 --> 01:53:58.388]  And try to give aid and comfort to the enemy, the New World Order, with this Miami move to turn it into total Nazi Germany.
[01:53:58.408 --> 01:53:59.688]  So I'll tell you about that in the next hour.
[01:54:00.368 --> 01:54:06.270]  Just so much other news on the economy and torture and the war and what Hillary's up to.
[01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:07.450]  It's all coming up.
[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.410]  I'm going to spend 30 seconds on this.
[01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:11.170]  My new film, The Order of Death, is out.
[01:54:11.651 --> 01:54:12.591]  I'm very proud of it.
[01:54:13.331 --> 01:54:15.951]  It gets deeply into the occult activities of the elite.
[01:54:16.652 --> 01:54:18.932]  New footage inside Bohemian Grove, inside the Owl.
[01:54:19.925 --> 01:54:24.347]  We go back into history, show how the Ku Klux Klan is part of the Illuminati publicly.
[01:54:25.828 --> 01:54:32.511]  It is such an important film, you need to have it, and it comes on the same DVD as Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:32.972 --> 01:54:35.913]  Re-edited, remastered, the 2005 edition.
[01:54:36.794 --> 01:54:37.594]  I'm really proud of this.
[01:54:37.854 --> 01:54:38.434]  Two films, $24.95.
[01:54:38.915 --> 01:54:44.397]  And because my true desire is just to get these out, each additional copy, $9.95.
[01:54:44.618 --> 01:54:45.038]  Over 60% off each
[01:54:50.434 --> 01:54:55.960]  I don't know what it is, but the point is, do the math.
[01:54:57.281 --> 01:54:59.664]  Get a whole bunch of copies, give them as gifts, get the word out.
[01:54:59.724 --> 01:55:03.748]  Infowars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:03.768 --> 01:55:06.110]  The Order of Death is out after the long wait.
[01:55:07.632 --> 01:55:09.894]  George in Texas, speaking of long waits, thanks for holding.
[01:55:11.443 --> 01:55:12.224]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:55:12.444 --> 01:55:12.864]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:13.325 --> 01:55:19.931]  Can you put me over to one of your people after we get off so I can talk about possibly coming to work for you?
[01:55:21.433 --> 01:55:22.173]  Here's the problem.
[01:55:22.914 --> 01:55:33.164]  I'm in a little office in South Austin, and my people on this phone line you called in on is one guy doing three people's jobs at the Genesis Network.
[01:55:33.644 --> 01:55:37.847]  Answering the phones, web mastering, and running this show.
[01:55:37.927 --> 01:55:41.369]  Three people should be doing that, but if we get the support, there will be three people doing it.
[01:55:41.689 --> 01:55:49.893]  But the point is that we can't really do resume things over the phone, sir, but you're welcome to send a resume in.
[01:55:49.933 --> 01:55:54.436]  Flattery would like to work here, but I'd like to get a resume that way, George.
[01:55:55.054 --> 01:56:07.299]  Well, it's just, you know, I just listen to you and it's like the light bulb comes on and it's the same stuff I've been telling people for, you know, five years and they won't listen to me and it's just... You need to start a website, sir.
[01:56:07.339 --> 01:56:09.020]  You need to go to a cable show locally.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:12.261]  You need to be a leader and then I'll link to you and send a million people over to you.
[01:56:12.701 --> 01:56:14.342]  I want to talk about one more thing.
[01:56:14.362 --> 01:56:18.984]  A guy named Kevin Trudeau, he wrote a book called Secrets That They've
[01:56:19.574 --> 01:56:21.355]  That they don't want you to know about.
[01:56:21.715 --> 01:56:25.216]  And it's a book, he kind of exposes corruption.
[01:56:25.236 --> 01:56:26.716]  I thought it was Secret Cures.
[01:56:27.396 --> 01:56:28.116]  Oh, you're right, sir.
[01:56:28.317 --> 01:56:28.977]  You're actually right.
[01:56:29.357 --> 01:56:31.257]  Secret Cures, they don't want you to know about.
[01:56:31.297 --> 01:56:35.839]  And he talks about corruption between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:56:36.079 --> 01:56:37.099]  And his model's great.
[01:56:37.119 --> 01:56:42.541]  He went and bought him for Marshall Time, did the production, and has made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:56:43.421 --> 01:56:45.841]  And that's what we ought to do, because then we can really fight the new world order.
[01:56:45.882 --> 01:56:47.202]  But I guarantee you, if I started doing that,
[01:56:48.643 --> 01:56:50.344]  They would come and do something to me.
[01:56:50.565 --> 01:56:54.048]  Well, the amazing thing is that I was having problems with indigestion.
[01:56:54.228 --> 01:56:56.030]  I'm a young guy.
[01:56:56.210 --> 01:57:02.295]  Chronic indigestion, sick in my stomach, just diarrhea, acid reflux, all these different things.
[01:57:02.335 --> 01:57:03.336]  And what did the book tell you to do?
[01:57:03.877 --> 01:57:06.019]  Well, it said stop eating fast food.
[01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:07.940]  So I just stopped eating all fast food.
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:10.082]  I started eating all organic food.
[01:57:10.783 --> 01:57:11.644]  Everything organic.
[01:57:11.764 --> 01:57:12.404]  Totally natural.
[01:57:12.424 --> 01:57:14.146]  Yeah, do you know what's in fast food?
[01:57:15.454 --> 01:57:16.835]  Actual petrochemicals.
[01:57:16.855 --> 01:57:17.956]  The actual oil.
[01:57:18.176 --> 01:57:19.417]  Designed to make you fat.
[01:57:20.477 --> 01:57:22.038]  Designed to make you hungry.
[01:57:23.139 --> 01:57:26.461]  I mean, they're designed that way to make you fat.
[01:57:26.501 --> 01:57:27.602]  I hear you.
[01:57:27.862 --> 01:57:28.802]  Great points, George.
[01:57:29.523 --> 01:57:30.383]  Call back soon.
[01:57:30.583 --> 01:57:31.824]  We'll be right back with the 3rd Hour.
[01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:33.485]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.746 --> 01:57:38.988]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.804 --> 01:57:51.444]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.105 --> 01:57:53.146]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:54.967]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.628 --> 01:57:56.449]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.230 --> 01:57:58.130]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.791 --> 01:58:02.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.955 --> 01:58:07.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.259 --> 01:58:11.423]  All right, now into the second, third hour.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:22.888]  Of this 30th of November 2005 edition, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:23.328 --> 01:58:24.109]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:29.133]  Central Standard Time, and back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:58:29.153 --> 01:58:30.214]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:34.837]  Cliff and Norm and Jeffrey and many others, wide open phones in this third hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:52.551]  You know, the ACLU has caused a national firestorm by being in the Miami Herald and Associated Press saying that, oh, random checkpoints and searches of the population is a wonderful thing.
[01:58:54.053 --> 01:58:58.237]  And so now they're trying to halfway back off of that, but they're loyal opposition and we're going to expose them.
[01:58:59.138 --> 01:59:00.919]  That doesn't mean if you're a member you're bad.
[01:59:00.939 --> 01:59:02.921]  It doesn't mean if you're a member of the NRA you're bad.
[01:59:03.261 --> 01:59:05.704]  The globalists infiltrate these organizations.
[01:59:06.897 --> 01:59:15.183]  I think in the case of the ACLU, they founded it, but we'll get into that and just so much more, but as promised right now, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:59:15.583 --> 01:59:17.004]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cliff in Utah.
[01:59:17.024 --> 01:59:19.166]  How are you doing there, Alex?
[01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.828]  Anyhow, I want to make about three real quick points.
[01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:26.791]  The real estate bubble is going to crash here pretty quick, that's for sure.
[01:59:26.831 --> 01:59:29.393]  It's going to burst, and Ted Anderson is completely correct.
[01:59:29.413 --> 01:59:33.196]  I have a copy of that also of the executive order where they confiscated the gold.
[01:59:34.324 --> 01:59:37.546]  $22 an ounce, and then they raised it to $35, so they made some money.
[01:59:38.306 --> 01:59:43.169]  And then the second point... And then he publicly shipped it to his bosses in Europe.
[01:59:43.529 --> 01:59:44.550]  That's exactly right.
[01:59:45.210 --> 01:59:53.595]  And I wanted to... Americans weren't allowed to buy it, so the Firestone family set up a dummy corporation to buy gold in Europe, and they were arrested and spent time in prison.
[01:59:54.055 --> 01:59:55.076]  That's exactly right.
[01:59:55.416 --> 01:59:58.658]  And the second point I wanted to make was that you and Deborah are terrorists.
[01:59:58.678 --> 02:00:00.259]  I have a paper here that says you are.
[02:00:00.339 --> 02:00:02.320]  It's from the FBI out of Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:00:03.418 --> 02:00:06.719]  Well, that was given out, 40,000 of those were given out nationwide.
[02:00:06.759 --> 02:00:09.139]  That was just the Phoenix, Arizona office version.
[02:00:09.599 --> 02:00:12.320]  And it says, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.220]  Constitution are terrorists.
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:17.601]  Second Amendment groups, it was quite a few people, yeah.
[02:00:18.261 --> 02:00:22.002]  Okay, and another point I wanted to make was, you talk about Timothy McVeigh.
[02:00:22.122 --> 02:00:26.603]  I've seen the man, personally, in another state, and he was a nutcase.
[02:00:26.643 --> 02:00:31.664]  He was always laughing to himself, and he was dressing fatigues, and there was also another guy dressing fatigues with him.
[02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:32.764]  He used to go to the SWAT meets.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:37.327]  And there was one more gentleman with him that was not from this country, I guarantee you.
[02:00:37.467 --> 02:00:43.018]  And I also talked to the manager of the motel where they stayed, and he said the same thing.
[02:00:46.636 --> 02:00:52.078]  Told TV stations that, and they also told the Daily Oklahoman that.
[02:00:52.158 --> 02:00:53.859]  And understand folks, it's simple.
[02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:56.820]  They torture you, they drug you, you'll do whatever they say.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:01.501]  This is documented, patented, admitted, declassified.
[02:01:02.102 --> 02:01:07.424]  And McVeigh was found drooling on the side of the road saying, I gotta chip, chip, stop the pain, chip, chip.
[02:01:08.084 --> 02:01:11.025]  And then the top mind control doctor, Jollien West.
[02:01:11.265 --> 02:01:11.785]  That's right.
[02:01:13.826 --> 02:01:14.066]  Go ahead.
[02:01:15.658 --> 02:01:16.399]  Are you there, sir?
[02:01:16.419 --> 02:01:17.599]  Yeah, can you hear me now?
[02:01:17.619 --> 02:01:18.500]  I'm not kidding you.
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:23.103]  Every time I talk about this McVeigh thing and mind control, my connection cuts out.
[02:01:23.163 --> 02:01:23.864]  You can't hear it.
[02:01:23.904 --> 02:01:27.146]  What I hear is... That's right.
[02:01:27.727 --> 02:01:29.608]  You almost had me thrown in jail one time, too.
[02:01:29.688 --> 02:01:34.131]  I put a document into a little town, you know, trying to get rid of the Patriot Act.
[02:01:35.012 --> 02:01:42.057]  I left the building and I didn't make it three quarters of a block and I was stopped by a cop car in front and a white unmarked truck in the back.
[02:01:42.437 --> 02:01:45.079]  And they questioned me and my partner for about an hour.
[02:01:46.158 --> 02:01:51.201]  Then tried to find something out like saying that the license plates didn't match the title and blah blah blah, which it did.
[02:01:51.241 --> 02:01:59.545]  He had it in a glove box and uh... come to find out later then that uh... they were dual deputized and the guy, the police officer didn't even work for him anymore.
[02:02:01.112 --> 02:02:01.953]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:02:02.033 --> 02:02:04.035]  So, now I came up with the idea.
[02:02:04.055 --> 02:02:10.961]  It was picked up on by the Gribs and I don't know, it's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cities.
[02:02:11.521 --> 02:02:13.062]  And six states have thrown it out.
[02:02:13.102 --> 02:02:17.086]  You're saying you went and just brought that resolution down and they didn't like it?
[02:02:17.106 --> 02:02:18.507]  They sure didn't like it.
[02:02:18.527 --> 02:02:21.149]  In fact... Well, they're training them, sir, that just freedom's illegal!
[02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:26.394]  I got footage of Abby Newman pulled over on the side of the road by state police in Virginia.
[02:02:26.714 --> 02:02:28.716]  She's got one of my videos and they arrested her for it.
[02:02:29.164 --> 02:02:32.527]  You were talking also about the right, you know, to travel and drive and all that stuff.
[02:02:32.567 --> 02:02:33.748]  I have all the records on that.
[02:02:33.768 --> 02:02:38.151]  A person has the right to travel anywhere they want, you know, and you're right about the driver's license.
[02:02:38.752 --> 02:02:39.673]  It's all a scam, Alex.
[02:02:39.693 --> 02:02:40.914]  It's all a scam.
[02:02:40.934 --> 02:02:41.714]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:41.774 --> 02:02:43.136]  You're working for the man!
[02:02:47.682 --> 02:02:50.544]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.785 --> 02:02:52.366]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.726 --> 02:02:57.390]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.730 --> 02:03:04.476]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.796 --> 02:03:06.777]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.977 --> 02:03:09.797]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.917 --> 02:03:14.579]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.779 --> 02:03:19.180]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:22.821]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[02:03:22.981 --> 02:03:26.643]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.883 --> 02:03:29.324]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:29.484 --> 02:03:32.365]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.738 --> 02:03:50.001]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:50.081 --> 02:03:54.265]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:54.505 --> 02:03:57.287]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:57.487 --> 02:03:59.889]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:08.717]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.917 --> 02:04:10.278]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:10.458 --> 02:04:14.582]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:14.942 --> 02:04:15.723]  We're good to go!
[02:04:33.865 --> 02:04:36.651]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.691 --> 02:04:37.553]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:53.763]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:53.924 --> 02:05:06.850]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:08.811]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:05:08.991 --> 02:05:12.454]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:05:12.734 --> 02:05:16.518]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:05:16.778 --> 02:05:21.742]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:05:22.023 --> 02:05:23.724]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:05:23.984 --> 02:05:27.968]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:05:28.228 --> 02:05:30.070]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:05:41.497 --> 02:05:44.639]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:05:46.339 --> 02:05:54.023]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.986 --> 02:06:00.167]  Countless video games where you work for the world government.
[02:06:00.187 --> 02:06:01.108]  You have microchips.
[02:06:01.128 --> 02:06:02.248]  You kill militia people.
[02:06:02.308 --> 02:06:02.969]  You torture them.
[02:06:02.989 --> 02:06:04.209]  You confiscate their guns.
[02:06:04.589 --> 02:06:06.450]  You're a loving UN peacekeeper.
[02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:11.953]  You're a loving liberal Canadian peacekeeper who comes down to take the evil Americans' guns with your gun.
[02:06:11.973 --> 02:06:16.114]  And this new one, Shattered Union, we played it in the first hour.
[02:06:16.134 --> 02:06:18.195]  I'll play it again before the show ends.
[02:06:18.235 --> 02:06:19.396]  I'll play it at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:20.939 --> 02:06:28.483]  After the bottom of the hour break, coming up again for those that missed it and we've got a link up to it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:29.704 --> 02:06:33.526]  Right now, we've got wide open phones for the next 52 minutes.
[02:06:33.546 --> 02:06:36.127]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 and I will get into the situation
[02:06:45.612 --> 02:06:58.222]  Across the country, from Miami to Denver, Colorado, but now in Miami, just on the highways, on the roads, in the shopping malls, in parking lots, at banks, squadrons of goon police are going to be out just shaking everyone down.
[02:06:58.262 --> 02:07:02.085]  The police chief has said this, the deputy chief has said this, and the ACLU said, we love it!
[02:07:02.145 --> 02:07:02.426]  Good!
[02:07:02.766 --> 02:07:03.907]  Oh, this is so constitutional.
[02:07:04.988 --> 02:07:07.230]  It's diametrically opposed to the Constitution.
[02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:11.233]  So the ACLU is getting really spanked right now, so now they're trying to
[02:07:12.748 --> 02:07:14.490]  Retreat a little bit, but really not.
[02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:17.692]  You know, in lawyer's speak, they've basically twisted things.
[02:07:17.712 --> 02:07:20.474]  So, that's coming up.
[02:07:20.875 --> 02:07:26.839]  Ex-Powell Aid is criticizing the detainee effort, and much more coming up.
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:30.122]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:07:30.723 --> 02:07:32.444]  Let's talk to Norm in South Dakota.
[02:07:32.464 --> 02:07:33.064]  Welcome, Norm.
[02:07:33.485 --> 02:07:34.085]  Oh, thank you.
[02:07:34.646 --> 02:07:36.687]  Alex, I'd sure like to appreciate you for what you're doing.
[02:07:36.747 --> 02:07:37.968]  You're the toughest guy I know.
[02:07:39.029 --> 02:07:40.951]  Oh, no, you're tougher than I am, my friend.
[02:07:41.071 --> 02:07:41.251]  Oh, no.
[02:07:42.751 --> 02:08:08.267]  I don't know if anybody picked this up but on Friday on the National News on ABC they had a neat little article and unless you were acquainted with the Illuminati hence when you may not catch up on this but there's a fellow at MIT and he's a brother of John Negroponte and he's a big big professor there and he has this genius plan that he's gonna give every child on earth a laptop computer and it's important that that computer belong to that individual
[02:08:08.976 --> 02:08:11.898]  And they're going to have the little power source right there where you can turn the crank.
[02:08:11.918 --> 02:08:12.538]  No, I saw that.
[02:08:12.699 --> 02:08:16.321]  He supposedly invented it where you crank it.
[02:08:16.741 --> 02:08:19.983]  And really, this is an NSA tracking control grid.
[02:08:20.144 --> 02:08:21.544]  He didn't develop that.
[02:08:21.685 --> 02:08:25.727]  That was given to him out of the different Defense Department developments.
[02:08:26.007 --> 02:08:33.232]  But of course, what's given to him is his brother, and then he claims he developed it, but the evidence is coming out that it's a Defense Department proprietary item.
[02:08:33.613 --> 02:08:35.574]  I figured that, but just John Negroponte,
[02:08:36.559 --> 02:08:39.622]  I mean he is a high class scumbag if anybody don't know about him.
[02:08:40.342 --> 02:08:42.464]  And this guy, the whole family must be in on it.
[02:08:42.644 --> 02:08:45.006]  Anyway, are you familiar with Robert Galen Ross Jr.?
[02:08:45.507 --> 02:08:46.387]  Yes, I interviewed him.
[02:08:46.728 --> 02:08:48.089]  Oh man, good boy.
[02:08:48.329 --> 02:08:50.511]  He tells the story about who they are and what they're doing.
[02:08:51.311 --> 02:08:53.753]  Also did, I'm sure you're aware of this, but the CIA
[02:08:54.938 --> 02:08:57.439]  Is not subject to any law, civil or criminal?
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.262]  No, that's where you get the 007 thing for MI6.
[02:09:01.802 --> 02:09:01.962]  Right.
[02:09:02.262 --> 02:09:14.289]  Licensed to kill and now they give it to the other cops and they shoot some guy more than 10 times and then it turns out he didn't run, he didn't resist, they just executed him because he was involved in some op, we believe, with them.
[02:09:14.309 --> 02:09:17.931]  He could pass for error but they were getting rid of a loose end.
[02:09:18.567 --> 02:09:23.133]  Did you familiar with Kathy O'Brien that wrote the book Transformation of America?
[02:09:23.213 --> 02:09:24.415]  Yeah, I've interviewed her.
[02:09:24.515 --> 02:09:24.975]  I don't know.
[02:09:25.075 --> 02:09:27.318]  I can't endorse that.
[02:09:27.358 --> 02:09:29.541]  Much of what she says checks out, but I just can't.
[02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:34.312]  They claim whenever you try to take one to court, they say national security and you can't do it.
[02:09:34.753 --> 02:09:35.933]  Oh, I know that!
[02:09:36.514 --> 02:09:39.416]  They declare national, but we have footage of McVeigh with the Iraqis.
[02:09:39.837 --> 02:09:41.738]  Why won't the government use it to convict McVeigh?
[02:09:41.798 --> 02:09:42.919]  Why did the defense use it?
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:49.885]  Because it was all staged and we've interviewed the people that saw the tape, FBI, police on record, we've interviewed the lawyers involved.
[02:09:49.905 --> 02:09:54.008]  They've declared national security in two separate trials on twelve tapes they've got.
[02:09:54.529 --> 02:09:58.272]  One of them, close up of McVeigh getting out with Mr. Husseini.
[02:10:00.573 --> 02:10:02.455]  Now again, why wouldn't they want to show that?
[02:10:02.855 --> 02:10:10.041]  Because it's on record, those Iraqis were CIA trained in the 80s, brought back in at the end of the Gulf War by George Bush Sr.
[02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:10.362]  Right.
[02:10:11.402 --> 02:10:20.951]  Also, Joan Pion was on Liberty Radio with Stan Monteith the other night and she had some real good information about old Prince Charles and how he's
[02:10:22.082 --> 02:10:22.943]  Some of his goings-on.
[02:10:22.983 --> 02:10:24.785]  Do you get that information?
[02:10:25.425 --> 02:10:26.246]  Yeah, I don't.
[02:10:26.326 --> 02:10:30.230]  Personally, I think Jones does a great job of covering global government and GEN21 and all that.
[02:10:30.691 --> 02:10:32.353]  I don't really agree that he's the Antichrist.
[02:10:32.373 --> 02:10:33.193]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:33.954 --> 02:10:36.297]  But I'll say this, he's an Antichrist-type individual.
[02:10:37.318 --> 02:10:44.225]  Down in Brazil, they've got a huge bronze statue of him as Lucifer, the angel, standing on dead people.
[02:10:45.117 --> 02:10:47.919]  Drinking wine, the blood of the dead.
[02:10:47.939 --> 02:10:52.162]  He's involved in the World Wildlife Fund with his father, Prince Philip.
[02:10:52.182 --> 02:10:56.085]  They openly said they want to kill 80 plus percent of us in publications.
[02:10:56.786 --> 02:10:57.787]  He's definitely pure evil.
[02:10:59.468 --> 02:11:00.909]  It's Gorbachev.
[02:11:01.049 --> 02:11:03.471]  It's Prince Charles.
[02:11:03.591 --> 02:11:09.956]  It's Benjamin Crimson always talking about Maitreya.
[02:11:12.478 --> 02:11:16.380]  Folks, I just know there's an evil system coming down on us, and I'm going to fight it.
[02:11:17.201 --> 02:11:22.464]  And I don't need to see some evil head leading it to know, but I know what is anti-crushed.
[02:11:24.265 --> 02:11:28.488]  It's Pat Robertson saying, don't worry about the microchip, it's not the mark of the beast, it's no big deal.
[02:11:29.789 --> 02:11:32.470]  Don't worry, face scanning and thumb scanning is good, don't worry about it.
[02:11:33.631 --> 02:11:35.472]  And then giving the sign of the devil on the TV.
[02:11:37.673 --> 02:11:40.215]  We rarely watch TV, and this is the kind of stuff we catch when we do.
[02:11:41.918 --> 02:11:50.988]  I know that when they say we must follow whatever Israel does, no matter what Israel does, whatever their government does, we must just mindlessly follow it.
[02:11:52.809 --> 02:11:54.351]  Well, I mean, I'm attacked by both sides.
[02:11:54.431 --> 02:11:55.392]  I'm not against Israel.
[02:11:55.432 --> 02:11:57.835]  I'm not against the Jewish people being there.
[02:11:58.635 --> 02:12:04.962]  But they lived in peace with the Arabs before the modern crew, the Socialist Zionist Party, that's what they called themselves,
[02:12:06.256 --> 02:12:14.542]  A group who, for $50 billion, adjusted $3 billion then, microwave with radiation, 110,000 kids, killing most of them.
[02:12:15.003 --> 02:12:15.883]  Those are Jewish kids.
[02:12:16.304 --> 02:12:17.104]  I'm against killing them.
[02:12:18.025 --> 02:12:20.146]  I'm against killing anybody, little black kids for that matter.
[02:12:21.207 --> 02:12:27.172]  I mean, I'm upset by all of these cultures being destroyed, by black culture being destroyed, by white culture being destroyed.
[02:12:27.932 --> 02:12:32.335]  Of all the groups that are dying, it's the Jewish group that's intermarrying more than anybody else.
[02:12:32.355 --> 02:12:34.277]  There won't be any Jews by another hundred years.
[02:12:35.766 --> 02:12:36.807]  And why do I bring that up?
[02:12:36.847 --> 02:12:41.268]  The Zionists are just these incredible racists, but they're not doing anything with the Jewish people.
[02:12:41.468 --> 02:12:46.010]  They're actual Luciferians hired by the Illuminati to enslave the Jewish people.
[02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:47.610]  That's what the devil always does.
[02:12:47.650 --> 02:12:50.751]  He always... Look, every prophet came and rebuked Israel.
[02:12:50.831 --> 02:12:54.693]  Every prophet came and said, you're evil, you're going to go into captivity, you're going to be enslaved.
[02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:58.534]  That's why most Orthodox Jews are saying that the Zionist state of Israel is evil.
[02:12:59.574 --> 02:13:01.795]  Because it's diametrically opposed to what God said.
[02:13:02.255 --> 02:13:03.796]  Somehow, though, people haven't read the Bible.
[02:13:04.582 --> 02:13:10.447]  They think worshipping whatever Israel does is what you're supposed to do, and that you're cursed if you criticize the policy of Israel.
[02:13:12.448 --> 02:13:20.915]  So according to their logic, if I say it's wrong for Israel to radiate 110,000 Jewish children, I am getting in between God and His covenant.
[02:13:21.235 --> 02:13:22.076]  That's ridiculous!
[02:13:24.157 --> 02:13:26.479]  All God did was chastise and spank Israel.
[02:13:27.219 --> 02:13:30.362]  All God did was send prophets to tell them to stop their evil ways.
[02:13:31.163 --> 02:13:31.423]  So,
[02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.990]  Over half?
[02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.810]  That's right, over half.
[02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:38.052]  But they play all these weird Knesset rules and switch parties all the time.
[02:13:38.332 --> 02:13:44.356]  But about 55% of the people in Israel don't like the current policies, don't like the war, don't like what's happening.
[02:13:44.376 --> 02:13:46.578]  You get arrested if you report certain things in their news.
[02:13:48.059 --> 02:13:50.641]  They have the same thing as what they have in England, even to a greater extent.
[02:13:50.681 --> 02:13:53.002]  The, uh, oh, what's it called?
[02:13:54.343 --> 02:13:58.626]  The name in Israel, it's not the same, uh, Official Secrets Act in England.
[02:13:58.646 --> 02:14:00.167]  They've got a similar name in Israel.
[02:14:02.637 --> 02:14:06.878]  But the point is, is that so the Jewish people aren't allowed to criticize Israel.
[02:14:07.018 --> 02:14:10.178]  I mean, it's the group running Israel.
[02:14:10.198 --> 02:14:11.639]  We've had Barry Amish on to talk about this.
[02:14:12.059 --> 02:14:13.619]  I don't want to get off down that rat hole.
[02:14:13.659 --> 02:14:16.879]  The point is, I don't even know how I got to talking about this.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.100]  It's just, it's so frustrating.
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:29.262]  You ought to try getting hate mail from the white supremacist, and then hate mail from the ADL crowd, and then hate mail from the, you know, this group, that group.
[02:14:29.682 --> 02:14:31.102]  Folks, I am for justice.
[02:14:31.462 --> 02:14:31.902]  Period.
[02:14:32.768 --> 02:14:35.189]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:38.771]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess Jeff is up next.
[02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:40.472]  Jeff, where are you calling us from?
[02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:42.093]  Warrensburg, Missouri there.
[02:14:42.353 --> 02:14:42.693]  Welcome.
[02:14:43.133 --> 02:14:43.534]  Thank you.
[02:14:43.934 --> 02:14:45.995]  I wanted to bring up the lack of outrage.
[02:14:47.476 --> 02:14:56.120]  A couple months ago I read in an Aviation Weekly magazine that the plan for America is to form our military to fight one war, and that's it.
[02:14:57.261 --> 02:15:01.663]  Prior to that, in the year 2000, we were postured to fight two major wars at once.
[02:15:02.438 --> 02:15:10.062]  Since 2000, our military capability has been cut in half by this administration, but yet there's no outrage anywhere about it.
[02:15:10.082 --> 02:15:12.363]  The media is not covering this.
[02:15:12.383 --> 02:15:12.703]  You know what?
[02:15:12.783 --> 02:15:25.949]  You or others ought to write an article for PrisonPlanet.com, and that's an article I have been meaning to write, meaning to do, and I've been meaning to write an article about how Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Chuckie Schumer, all of them are quote for this phony war, well then how is it liberal
[02:15:26.953 --> 02:15:28.374]  Uh, you know, to be against the war.
[02:15:28.835 --> 02:15:32.217]  There's so many articles I want to write that I just don't have time to write, but let me break this down.
[02:15:32.557 --> 02:15:38.462]  Obviously, sir, you know the answer to this, and I want to see if you agree with me when I say this, but this is not my opinion.
[02:15:38.502 --> 02:15:39.642]  This is the official plan.
[02:15:41.043 --> 02:15:43.845]  Make America look bad in the eyes of the world.
[02:15:43.885 --> 02:15:45.927]  Let everybody know about the torture and the evil.
[02:15:46.807 --> 02:15:49.628]  And the shooting women and children and the raping them.
[02:15:50.008 --> 02:15:53.490]  Domestically tell us we're good, keep the people in line going along with it.
[02:15:54.070 --> 02:16:07.095]  Make the EU look like the good cop, then they get to pose as the savior to crystallize and form the world government that's already been in long development and is already partially completed to a great extent.
[02:16:07.655 --> 02:16:09.876]  Meanwhile, everything that's been done
[02:16:10.766 --> 02:16:33.790]  By Nixon and by Reagan and by all of these guys, it's not to build a military up, it's to have big boondoggles that go to sweethearts, not to build a real military, to give the troops absolutely nothing, to have horrible VA hospitals, you name it, to send our military in, in 160-something countries, to debase it down to absolutely nothing,
[02:16:34.865 --> 02:16:41.369]  And as you said, they're going to a one-front war when all the strategists say we need to be able to fight a three-front war.
[02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:44.532]  They have given all the supercomputers secrets.
[02:16:44.892 --> 02:16:47.313]  Look, Clinton gave some supercomputers to China.
[02:16:47.353 --> 02:16:48.374]  He was decried as evil.
[02:16:48.474 --> 02:16:49.275]  I did it personally.
[02:16:49.695 --> 02:16:53.898]  Bush takes all restrictions off, and you're not going to hear a word from Rush Limbaugh.
[02:16:55.330 --> 02:16:56.711]  Bush is the Trojan horse.
[02:16:56.731 --> 02:16:58.172]  He's bringing us down.
[02:16:58.572 --> 02:17:02.134]  This Iraq situation is about getting us tied up in a Vietnam situation.
[02:17:02.474 --> 02:17:03.455]  It's the same thing.
[02:17:03.715 --> 02:17:09.278]  Yes, and don't forget the transfer of technology in 2001 when a P-3 landed at Hainan, China.
[02:17:10.178 --> 02:17:12.500]  And the Chinese took apart the P-3 aircraft.
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:13.420]  Yeah, that was all staged.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:17.402]  They all had the acid packs.
[02:17:18.063 --> 02:17:19.543]  They had buttons they were supposed to hit.
[02:17:19.603 --> 02:17:20.684]  Alex, I got one more thing.
[02:17:20.724 --> 02:17:22.385]  None of the acid packs were...
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:24.461]  Alex, you got... Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:24.481 --> 02:17:25.301]  I'll let you quickly finish.
[02:17:25.321 --> 02:17:26.982]  I said I'm gonna take a lot of calls, so I gotta move quickly.
[02:17:27.002 --> 02:17:27.202]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:27.642 --> 02:17:28.923]  We'll let you finish up, Jeffrey, on the other side.
[02:17:28.943 --> 02:17:29.003]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:29.023 --> 02:17:29.723]  The new film is out!
[02:17:29.743 --> 02:17:31.464]  The Order of Death at long last!
[02:17:31.504 --> 02:17:32.064]  I've released it!
[02:17:32.084 --> 02:17:33.125]  One of my best videos of the day!
[02:17:33.145 --> 02:17:33.445]  You need it!
[02:17:47.785 --> 02:17:52.229]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:56.073]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:17:56.233 --> 02:18:04.361]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:18:04.621 --> 02:18:10.247]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:18:10.547 --> 02:18:15.790]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:18:16.050 --> 02:18:18.132]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:18:18.392 --> 02:18:30.539]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:18:30.779 --> 02:18:35.204]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:18:35.424 --> 02:18:36.366]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:18:36.566 --> 02:18:38.188]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:18:38.308 --> 02:18:40.110]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:40.831]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:18:40.851 --> 02:18:41.051]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:18:48.544 --> 02:18:51.547]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:18:51.887 --> 02:19:00.715]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:01.035 --> 02:19:05.719]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:06.179 --> 02:19:12.903]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:13.303 --> 02:19:25.070]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:25.550 --> 02:19:30.012]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:19:30.192 --> 02:19:32.513]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:32.533 --> 02:19:34.494]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:34.514 --> 02:19:35.714]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:19:35.774 --> 02:19:37.235]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:19:37.255 --> 02:19:38.315]  Now get available in Iowa.
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:48.540]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:53.381]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:19:53.561 --> 02:20:01.363]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:20:01.623 --> 02:20:06.984]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:07.204 --> 02:20:14.186]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:14.486 --> 02:20:19.809]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:20:20.069 --> 02:20:24.811]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:20:25.151 --> 02:20:32.735]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:20:33.075 --> 02:20:39.341]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:20:39.641 --> 02:20:40.842]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.902 --> 02:20:41.102]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.186 --> 02:20:49.787]  Government is best what governs least.
[02:20:50.348 --> 02:20:51.649]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:52.089 --> 02:20:54.811]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:55.232 --> 02:20:57.894]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:58.334 --> 02:21:04.799]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:12.486]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.

[02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.909]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.

[02:21:25.632 --> 02:21:27.073]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:21:27.253 --> 02:21:27.593]  Have you?
[02:21:28.173 --> 02:21:29.674]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:30.134 --> 02:21:32.055]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:32.075 --> 02:21:36.097]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:36.277 --> 02:21:36.838]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:21:39.955 --> 02:21:41.116]  Oh, some have been forgotten.
[02:21:41.576 --> 02:21:45.299]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:49.942]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.962 --> 02:21:53.904]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.287 --> 02:21:59.728]  This is the type of stuff that comes in the mail every day.
[02:21:59.748 --> 02:22:05.772]  A very well-written, properly formatted resume from a 13-year-old
[02:22:09.369 --> 02:22:10.970]  Living in the Middle East.
[02:22:11.731 --> 02:22:13.452]  From, it was mailed from Kuwait.
[02:22:13.472 --> 02:22:15.994]  I mean, this is the type of stuff I get.
[02:22:16.635 --> 02:22:19.617]  I just, I mean, even try to wade through it all, but keep it coming.
[02:22:20.518 --> 02:22:23.440]  Videos, documents, I'm just wading in information.
[02:22:24.301 --> 02:22:30.166]  Now Wyatt called a few weeks ago, a few months ago, and I was a little bit rude to him, so I'm going to skip ahead to Wyatt after we take a call here.
[02:22:30.626 --> 02:22:35.410]  Because Wyatt's a long-time listener, and we'll see if he's going to chastise me on air.
[02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:37.191]  But let's go back to
[02:22:38.908 --> 02:22:39.789]  We're talking to Jeffrey.
[02:22:39.809 --> 02:22:40.549]  Finish up, Jeffrey.
[02:22:41.170 --> 02:22:41.270]  Okay.
[02:22:41.530 --> 02:22:59.942]  Alex, last Friday in the local paper, Daily Star Journal, Warrensburg, for Wednesday's arrest report by the sheriff, it has an article in here that says deputies responded to the local Air Force base of a report of a male subject accused in the Air Force pilots of shooting laser beams in his house and in his head.
[02:23:00.002 --> 02:23:01.843]  And it gives the guy's name and the town he's from.
[02:23:02.363 --> 02:23:04.565]  And they arrested him for driving without a license.
[02:23:05.866 --> 02:23:06.986]  And they released him later.
[02:23:07.126 --> 02:23:07.727]  That's all it says.
[02:23:08.966 --> 02:23:13.129]  Well, there are a lot of crazy people out there, but there's also people that really are being harassed by the government.
[02:23:13.149 --> 02:23:13.709]  Right.
[02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:15.010]  I appreciate the call.
[02:23:15.331 --> 02:23:15.531]  Thank you.
[02:23:15.951 --> 02:23:16.331]  You bet.
[02:23:16.772 --> 02:23:20.554]  Remember the guy they arrested for shooting a green laser at an airplane at like 20,000 feet?
[02:23:20.594 --> 02:23:26.358]  But how does a green laser from 20,000 feet get into the cockpit when it's up above the person who's below?
[02:23:26.378 --> 02:23:34.604]  Then it turned out that the government was doing a laser test at that very same time with a system to identify and blind hijackers.
[02:23:36.983 --> 02:23:38.844]  Just really weird stuff goes on, folks.
[02:23:39.244 --> 02:23:40.085]  I don't know what to make of that.
[02:23:41.206 --> 02:23:42.447]  Let's go to Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:23:42.487 --> 02:23:43.407]  Wyatt, how are you doing, buddy?
[02:23:43.707 --> 02:23:44.208]  Good, Alex.
[02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:44.648]  How are you?
[02:23:44.908 --> 02:23:45.208]  Good.
[02:23:45.789 --> 02:23:48.751]  I went off on my apology for the last call I did.
[02:23:48.771 --> 02:23:50.432]  No, I was rude to you, too.
[02:23:50.472 --> 02:23:52.093]  What's going on, sweetie?
[02:23:52.173 --> 02:24:01.879]  Well, one of my interests is, in your movie Wake Up or Waco, you had Ramsey Clark in the video.
[02:24:02.817 --> 02:24:08.060]  And Ramsey Clark is over in Iraq, assisting in legal counsel for Saddam Hussein.
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:18.385]  And I don't think, I mean, I would like, hopefully when this is over, would you have him back on and ask him what he had discovered or found out or what he is able to talk about about that?
[02:24:19.145 --> 02:24:28.850]  Yes, in fact, I interviewed Ramsey Clark about eight years ago, and so obviously you've seen that from longer, I guess, in America, wake up or wake up.
[02:24:29.671 --> 02:24:37.276]  And then there's also, because he assisted the Branch Davidians, for those that don't know, former Attorney General for Kennedy and LBJ.
[02:25:00.762 --> 02:25:04.565]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[02:25:04.585 --> 02:25:10.490]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[02:25:11.691 --> 02:25:16.355]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[02:25:17.116 --> 02:25:20.038]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:25.783]  There are men coming down from the clouds.
[02:25:25.803 --> 02:25:27.044]  Okay, folks, we're back live.
[02:25:28.217 --> 02:25:42.490]  And I'm not trying to blame our technical difficulties from Austin, Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota on the government, but I was told by multiple government sources that there's a group who's going to start screwing my broadcast up.
[02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:50.457]  And the first time I ever talked about this, I had Colonel Craig Roberts on who had
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:00.964]  Let's just say I've been close to one of the sources, and right when I brought it up, and it wasn't even planned, and said, yeah, they've told me they're going to start knocking me off the air, cutting me off, right then it happened.
[02:26:01.964 --> 02:26:06.406]  And every time I'm talking about something serious or something important now, this is starting to happen.
[02:26:06.426 --> 02:26:07.786]  But it's not a big deal.
[02:26:07.966 --> 02:26:10.207]  We'll put in four or five more ISDN lines in here.
[02:26:10.588 --> 02:26:12.848]  We'll just start switching over to other ones when we have to.
[02:26:13.229 --> 02:26:15.630]  And I still have my other studio set up across town.
[02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:18.971]  I can move over there and do it there if this doesn't stop.
[02:26:19.071 --> 02:26:21.492]  And it could be a technical thing, or it could be these jokers.
[02:26:22.375 --> 02:26:26.137]  But I'm going to go give them a visit down at their office and file a complaint on them.
[02:26:26.197 --> 02:26:28.939]  You idiots, we even know what office you're in down off the river.
[02:26:30.539 --> 02:26:32.781]  So, and we've got people too.
[02:26:33.521 --> 02:26:35.882]  Alright, Wyatt are you there now?
[02:26:35.922 --> 02:26:36.603]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[02:26:36.903 --> 02:26:37.803]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:37.963 --> 02:26:39.584]  It's interesting how it cuts in and out.
[02:26:40.485 --> 02:26:44.067]  I was turning in the power hour this morning and they've had trouble with their internet.
[02:26:45.187 --> 02:26:47.328]  Their broadcast on their internet, it keeps going out on them.
[02:26:49.013 --> 02:26:53.297]  So anyway, uh... Well, that was the network itself, and that was our problem.
[02:26:53.557 --> 02:26:54.638]  Oh, okay.
[02:26:55.079 --> 02:27:05.508]  Well, that was primarily my biggest question, with that information, because they've changed the reason why Saddam Hussein is being tried now.
[02:27:05.848 --> 02:27:07.510]  Well, he already killed three of his lawyers.
[02:27:08.229 --> 02:27:08.429]  Right.
[02:27:08.769 --> 02:27:16.292]  And I saw a curious thing in the Associated Press where our government said, oh, we'll just keep trying him over and over again if he's found not guilty.
[02:27:16.872 --> 02:27:17.412]  Since when?
[02:27:17.512 --> 02:27:19.473]  Again, double jeopardy, folks.
[02:27:19.593 --> 02:27:23.175]  Even people who you think are bad are supposed to get free and fair trials.
[02:27:23.195 --> 02:27:23.835]  But no, no, no.
[02:27:23.895 --> 02:27:26.336]  No, we don't give free and fair trials.
[02:27:26.716 --> 02:27:27.676]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:27.696 --> 02:27:28.397]  Anything else, Wyatt?
[02:27:28.717 --> 02:27:29.297]  That's enough.
[02:27:29.617 --> 02:27:30.557]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[02:27:31.097 --> 02:27:34.519]  We're going to continue with your calls and a lot of other news when we get back.
[02:27:34.539 --> 02:27:34.979]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.787 --> 02:27:39.809]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.709 --> 02:27:43.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.532 --> 02:27:50.154]  Attention drivers, poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[02:27:50.474 --> 02:27:53.755]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[02:27:54.096 --> 02:27:58.958]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[02:27:59.318 --> 02:28:02.980]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:04.461]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[02:28:04.741 --> 02:28:07.744]  Poor mileage and reduced performance at a time of record fuel prices.
[02:28:08.064 --> 02:28:08.724]  There is an answer.
[02:28:08.985 --> 02:28:15.129]  Protekta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:22.075]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[02:28:22.775 --> 02:28:24.997]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[02:28:25.297 --> 02:28:29.321]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protekta.
[02:28:29.741 --> 02:28:31.302]  Go to www.sfr.com.
[02:28:32.543 --> 02:28:32.864]  That's 888-873-7371
[02:28:46.656 --> 02:28:51.881]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:52.021 --> 02:29:00.108]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:29:00.369 --> 02:29:07.295]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:07.595 --> 02:29:08.876]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:08.956 --> 02:29:14.859]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:15.059 --> 02:29:20.122]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:20.242 --> 02:29:29.127]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:29.387 --> 02:29:32.689]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:35.110]  We're good.
[02:29:46.909 --> 02:29:53.271]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.491 --> 02:29:58.492]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.832 --> 02:30:06.734]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.894 --> 02:30:13.936]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:14.156 --> 02:30:15.376]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:15.517 --> 02:30:18.898]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:18.958 --> 02:30:20.078]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:20.358 --> 02:30:21.639]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:21.839 --> 02:30:28.681]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:28.781 --> 02:30:31.242]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:30:31.442 --> 02:30:34.344]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.364 --> 02:30:34.404]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.425 --> 02:30:35.445]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.465 --> 02:30:38.648]  I got a star on my car and one on my wrist, and it keeps car payments coming.
[02:31:01.607 --> 02:31:02.508]  We'll cover that in a minute.
[02:31:02.888 --> 02:31:05.410]  Right now, let's continue with your phone calls.
[02:31:05.450 --> 02:31:06.971]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[02:31:07.011 --> 02:31:07.492]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:31:07.512 --> 02:31:07.792]  Welcome.
[02:31:08.793 --> 02:31:09.793]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:31:09.913 --> 02:31:10.274]  Good, sir.
[02:31:10.954 --> 02:31:11.335]  Good.
[02:31:11.375 --> 02:31:16.539]  I just wanted to comment on what you said earlier about, you know, microchips and stuff like that.
[02:31:16.579 --> 02:31:18.440]  Just how people need to start waking up to that.
[02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:19.601]  You know, biometrics on your I.D.
[02:31:19.661 --> 02:31:20.782]  and computers and stuff like that.
[02:31:20.822 --> 02:31:21.803]  And chips.
[02:31:22.063 --> 02:31:23.564]  Microchips in little kids.
[02:31:23.604 --> 02:31:25.986]  They're already in dogs and stuff like that.
[02:31:27.291 --> 02:31:29.753]  It's just amazing how these people are just kind of, you know, mindless to this thing.
[02:31:29.793 --> 02:31:30.714]  They don't realize what's going on.
[02:31:30.794 --> 02:31:33.176]  They just start winking out, you know?
[02:31:33.216 --> 02:31:33.477]  Perfect.
[02:31:34.377 --> 02:31:34.918]  No, you're right.
[02:31:34.958 --> 02:31:37.380]  People aren't questioning.
[02:31:38.561 --> 02:31:39.522]  And your phone's breaking up.
[02:31:39.542 --> 02:31:40.163]  Thanks for the call.
[02:31:40.203 --> 02:31:41.344]  I appreciate it.
[02:31:41.384 --> 02:31:44.987]  Let's talk to, I believe, Justin in Texas?
[02:31:45.948 --> 02:31:46.248]  Go ahead.
[02:31:46.288 --> 02:31:46.808]  You're on the air.
[02:31:46.828 --> 02:31:48.069]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:31:48.330 --> 02:31:48.650]  Hi.
[02:31:49.411 --> 02:31:51.733]  I've got a quick little story, real quick.
[02:31:52.908 --> 02:32:09.218]  Two weeks ago I was in, I run a pool service, swimming pool service and uh... I'm running through the neighborhood and I keep seeing undercover cops everywhere and uh... eventually uh... I leave the neighborhood and I go the back way so that I don't have to mess with them and uh... I guess that drew their suspicions.
[02:32:09.278 --> 02:32:11.640]  They pulled me over and said I had a taillight out.
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:22.206]  I didn't use my blinker or something and uh... anyways he asked for my ID and all this and uh... next thing out of his mouth is also we had a uh... he was saying that he had a uh...
[02:32:23.047 --> 02:32:27.910]  A guy around the neighborhood in a white truck with a tool box, just like mine, trying to pick up kids in the neighborhood.
[02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:30.111]  Uh, okay, well, whatever.
[02:32:30.271 --> 02:32:33.393]  And, uh, he said, but we know it's not you because you have blue writing.
[02:32:33.433 --> 02:32:34.573]  The truck looks like red writing.
[02:32:35.134 --> 02:32:37.155]  So let me take your ID and run your ID and all this.
[02:32:37.295 --> 02:32:39.256]  Um, well, he does all that.
[02:32:39.316 --> 02:32:39.856]  He comes back.
[02:32:39.896 --> 02:32:41.337]  I've got a ticket that I didn't pay for.
[02:32:41.357 --> 02:32:42.257]  So he puts me in handcuffs.
[02:32:42.658 --> 02:32:46.020]  Um, I'm sitting there in handcuffs up against the cop bar, ready to go to jail.
[02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:52.383]  And, uh, next thing I know, a red truck pulls up another unmarked vehicle and he starts taking digital pictures of my truck.
[02:32:52.938 --> 02:32:55.200]  And I tell him, hey, hey, hey, you know, don't do that, don't do that.
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:57.682]  And he pulled his badge out and found a little necklace.
[02:32:57.702 --> 02:32:59.263]  And I was all, thank you for showing the badge to me.
[02:32:59.303 --> 02:33:00.264]  He's all, I didn't do it for you.
[02:33:00.824 --> 02:33:01.565]  And he kept on going.
[02:33:01.585 --> 02:33:05.268]  He took a picture of my truck and then he put this big digital camera right in my face.
[02:33:05.928 --> 02:33:08.170]  And I turned my head and was like, no, you're not going to take a picture of me.
[02:33:08.210 --> 02:33:09.211]  You're not going to take a picture of me.
[02:33:09.691 --> 02:33:15.536]  And the cop standing next to me told me, uh, if I didn't, he was going to physically restrain me and make me take this picture.
[02:33:16.136 --> 02:33:18.158]  And, you know, I ended up taking the picture.
[02:33:18.398 --> 02:33:20.880]  And, uh, you know, that's just a little, uh,
[02:33:21.533 --> 02:33:22.755]  Little much, I didn't know what to think of that.
[02:33:22.975 --> 02:33:33.228]  Well, actually, child kidnapping is at all-time lows in modern history, but the news, they've actually done studies, they ask people, oh, is it at all-time highs or all-time lows?
[02:33:33.269 --> 02:33:34.450]  They'll say all-time highs.
[02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:37.935]  Meanwhile, Dine Corps, based right here in Austin, kidnaps 200,000 women and children.
[02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:41.317]  And it's international news.
[02:33:41.377 --> 02:33:45.760]  The average American isn't even aware that they actually run an industrialized kidnapping operation.
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:47.841]  We've even played congressional hearings of that.
[02:33:47.901 --> 02:33:48.702]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[02:33:49.142 --> 02:33:59.248]  Meanwhile, I heard on the radio last week, somebody in a white truck, in the last week, at red lights, talked to children.
[02:34:00.348 --> 02:34:03.130]  And there was an article in the AP out of Australia
[02:34:04.116 --> 02:34:06.337]  Where the airline seats you.
[02:34:06.777 --> 02:34:13.538]  You're sitting in your assigned seat, but if a young boy or girl, I think it's under 15, is sitting by you, they make you move.
[02:34:13.558 --> 02:34:17.559]  You know, like we're all, you know, these evil killers or whatever.
[02:34:18.459 --> 02:34:22.500]  And it's this mentality where people are just in absolute, total fear.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:30.042]  They're not afraid of their kids sitting in a school next to an illegal alien coughing drug-resistant or drug-immune TB on them, or spinal meningitis.
[02:34:30.962 --> 02:34:32.243]  No, they're not worried about that.
[02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:37.479]  They're actually just, oh, all these men are just these evil killers.
[02:34:38.179 --> 02:34:41.880]  And, sir, that sounds like a gang enforcement unit, though, that you ran into.
[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:46.701]  They just go around taking snapshots of everybody doing secret police type stuff.
[02:34:46.721 --> 02:34:47.482]  So how did it all end?
[02:34:47.502 --> 02:34:48.202]  They took you to jail?
[02:34:48.822 --> 02:34:51.803]  Well, as I was sitting there, I told them not to take the picture.
[02:34:51.883 --> 02:34:55.484]  I ended up, I wasn't going to really want to be forcibly restrained to do it.
[02:34:55.584 --> 02:34:58.925]  So I'm sitting there and I turn around and I hear ruckus behind me.
[02:35:00.329 --> 02:35:11.816]  I turn around and the cop tells me, you might not want to turn around, and I do, and it's Fox 7 News with a camera zeroed in on me and I guess they were on a skin or something and they knew that the cops were looking for the pedophile or whatever.
[02:35:11.896 --> 02:35:13.037]  Did they put you on TV?
[02:35:13.858 --> 02:35:15.159]  I don't really, I don't know.
[02:35:15.219 --> 02:35:17.240]  So you need to find out, you can own them.
[02:35:17.998 --> 02:35:19.599]  You can own that place.
[02:35:19.679 --> 02:35:21.260]  You will absolutely own them.
[02:35:23.262 --> 02:35:24.183]  You know what?
[02:35:24.203 --> 02:35:31.047]  They had the press there, buddy, and they just randomly pulled you over and randomly did that just to act like they're doing something good.
[02:35:31.448 --> 02:35:31.768]  You know what?
[02:35:31.788 --> 02:35:32.909]  I'll put you on hold.
[02:35:33.209 --> 02:35:34.150]  Leave me your number, please.
[02:35:34.170 --> 02:35:34.870]  I sure will.
[02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:35.831]  I was going to say...
[02:35:40.768 --> 02:35:46.510]  Five minutes ago, when you first arrived, I was going to say, were news cameras there?
[02:35:46.530 --> 02:35:47.731]  Were you being followed around?
[02:35:48.091 --> 02:35:51.712]  I haven't watched TV in the last week or so, but can somebody call in?
[02:35:52.053 --> 02:35:52.753]  Get into the line?
[02:35:52.793 --> 02:35:55.614]  Did you see a local Fox 7 piece the last few days?
[02:35:56.214 --> 02:36:03.757]  Or maybe Fox 7 was smart enough to not put you on TV or to blur out your face, but still it's the exact same thing.
[02:36:03.777 --> 02:36:04.958]  So we're going to put him on hold now.
[02:36:05.638 --> 02:36:06.558]  We're going to get his phone number.
[02:36:06.598 --> 02:36:07.119]  Okay, guys?
[02:36:07.839 --> 02:36:08.079]  Thanks.
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:16.805]  But this is just classic behavior.
[02:36:18.666 --> 02:36:19.687]  And I'm so tired of it.
[02:36:22.428 --> 02:36:23.029]  So sick.
[02:36:23.989 --> 02:36:24.450]  So sick.
[02:36:24.510 --> 02:36:28.372]  I mean, obviously, if somebody's out really doing stuff, put out an APB, go after them.
[02:36:28.392 --> 02:36:29.934]  But I heard this on the radio.
[02:36:29.954 --> 02:36:31.515]  It was on KLVJ.
[02:36:31.555 --> 02:36:39.360]  I heard this report, and it was just in the last week, kids say that
[02:36:40.097 --> 02:36:43.099]  Somebody in a white pickup said hi to them!
[02:36:46.241 --> 02:36:49.223]  And probably what it was, was probably some third world illegal alien.
[02:36:49.243 --> 02:36:50.284]  You know, they say hi to people.
[02:36:51.605 --> 02:36:53.526]  They got a lot of negatives, but also a lot of positives.
[02:36:53.546 --> 02:36:54.547]  You ought to be out in the country!
[02:36:55.103 --> 02:36:58.686]  Where everybody says hi to kids, but not in these big cities, boy.
[02:36:58.706 --> 02:37:01.068]  You got a bunch of people just scared to death.
[02:37:02.029 --> 02:37:03.150]  Dinecore changed its name.
[02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.810]  I forget the name.
[02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:05.091]  They got a big building downtown.
[02:37:05.352 --> 02:37:10.075]  There's like an actual anti-Christ devil corporation, and nobody cares.
[02:37:10.636 --> 02:37:11.437]  It's fine and dandy.
[02:37:12.377 --> 02:37:15.520]  They feel real safe, because see, the news didn't tell them to worry about it.
[02:37:16.124 --> 02:37:16.904]  I said I'd play this.
[02:37:16.944 --> 02:37:17.625]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:37:17.645 --> 02:37:18.925]  We'll take a few more calls.
[02:37:19.225 --> 02:37:20.486]  And I've got to hurry through the news.
[02:37:20.986 --> 02:37:23.107]  Ex-pal aide criticizes detainee effort.
[02:37:23.467 --> 02:37:25.608]  Rumsfeld says don't call them insurgents.
[02:37:26.248 --> 02:37:30.109]  Even though he instructed them before to call them insurgents and homicide bombers.
[02:37:30.370 --> 02:37:31.010]  He's saying no.
[02:37:31.050 --> 02:37:33.031]  Big Brother says that's now not the term to use.
[02:37:34.571 --> 02:37:38.053]  Also, I want to get into feds to fund controversial school surveillance.
[02:37:38.093 --> 02:37:38.733]  More on that.
[02:37:39.213 --> 02:37:41.654]  Spy in the sky to spot energy-wasting homes.
[02:37:42.415 --> 02:37:45.477]  Cindy Sheehan claims photos falsely implied her book signing was a flop.
[02:37:46.037 --> 02:37:49.139]  How high-tech Repo Man keeps car payments coming.
[02:37:49.179 --> 02:37:53.862]  I want to hit those, but this is a new video game that's come out, and there's scores of these.
[02:37:55.363 --> 02:37:59.465]  And getting you ready for martial law, getting you ready for foreign troops, acclimating you.
[02:38:00.826 --> 02:38:05.209]  You, in most of these games, get enhanced by the microchips you're implanted with.
[02:38:06.029 --> 02:38:08.110]  But here's this new one on Shattered Union.
[02:38:08.151 --> 02:38:08.851]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:38:12.501 --> 02:38:14.162]  Oh, we're trying to find it in the computer.
[02:38:14.202 --> 02:38:14.943]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:14.963 --> 02:38:19.786]  I kind of sprung that on you, I guess.
[02:38:20.706 --> 02:38:22.847]  Well, I know it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:38:23.808 --> 02:38:26.329]  If we're unable to play that for you today.
[02:38:27.310 --> 02:38:35.335]  We did play it in the first hour, and now I'm told it's disappeared down the memory hole, so let's just... Oh, we have it now!
[02:38:36.661 --> 02:38:43.026]  Hey, buddy, in between webmastering, answering the phones, and running my show, I want you to start juggling, too.
[02:38:43.047 --> 02:38:44.888]  That's a joke.
[02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:46.169]  It's a joke.
[02:38:46.930 --> 02:38:48.851]  All right, let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:38:48.891 --> 02:38:49.292]  Here it is.
[02:38:50.553 --> 02:38:53.996]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[02:38:54.056 --> 02:38:57.118]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[02:38:57.138 --> 02:39:02.323]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[02:39:02.964 --> 02:39:10.807]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:39:12.808 --> 02:39:19.931]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:39:20.531 --> 02:39:28.714]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:39:29.875 --> 02:39:36.837]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:39:39.017 --> 02:39:42.878]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[02:39:42.978 --> 02:39:48.480]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:49.280]  Congress.
[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:52.981]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[02:39:53.461 --> 02:39:57.322]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:39:58.047 --> 02:40:03.171]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[02:40:03.331 --> 02:40:05.812]  area to secure international interest.
[02:40:07.193 --> 02:40:14.619]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:22.464]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:40:24.485 --> 02:40:24.606]  Now.
[02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:31.519]  The once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:40:32.499 --> 02:40:41.062]  The time for words has passed and the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[02:40:42.623 --> 02:40:45.324]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[02:40:46.604 --> 02:40:47.744]  To restore peace.
[02:40:49.065 --> 02:40:52.066]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[02:40:57.635 --> 02:41:03.539]  And notice how the game mirrors reality, and the government really is gearing up to use foreign troops.
[02:41:03.959 --> 02:41:07.201]  They really are gearing up to do this and bring in foreign troops, NATO, UN troops.
[02:41:08.322 --> 02:41:10.984]  And I'm not saying they're going to do it, but folks, we've got to pay attention.
[02:41:11.024 --> 02:41:14.886]  They really are putting hundreds of billions of dollars into it.
[02:41:14.926 --> 02:41:16.447]  They really are gearing up for it.
[02:41:16.948 --> 02:41:22.111]  They really are militarizing the police and training them that we're all scum slaves that have got to learn to submit to them.
[02:41:24.913 --> 02:41:26.134]  But that's just amazing.
[02:41:28.032 --> 02:41:29.973]  Let me just run to the news and then I'll go right to your calls.
[02:41:29.993 --> 02:41:32.454]  Look at this big stack here.
[02:41:32.474 --> 02:41:36.456]  Yeah, I've got to commend this ex-Powell aide.
[02:41:36.797 --> 02:41:40.298]  I keep meaning to tell my producer to get this individual on.
[02:41:40.318 --> 02:41:40.979]  We're going to try.
[02:41:41.539 --> 02:41:44.020]  Ex-Powell aide criticizes detainee effort.
[02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:56.347]  A top aide to former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Monday that wrong-headed ideas from the handling of foreign detainees arose from White House and Pentagon officials
[02:41:57.074 --> 02:42:03.558]  No longer public servants, officials, who argued that the President, this is a quote, of the United States is all-powerful.
[02:42:04.199 --> 02:42:08.722]  That was in the Alberto Gonzales memos, and the Geneva Convention is irrelevant.
[02:42:08.842 --> 02:42:17.147]  So again, he's quoting Alberto Gonzales, who said the President is above the law, the President is all-powerful, he is the law.
[02:42:17.447 --> 02:42:23.051]  He is literally allowed to murder one-month-old babies on the White House lawn if he wants to.
[02:42:24.719 --> 02:42:25.700]  I mean, that's what they're saying.
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:28.062]  He is absolute Caesar.
[02:42:28.262 --> 02:42:29.403]  God-man.
[02:42:31.464 --> 02:42:34.967]  I mean, I don't think they even announced that Hitler was all-powerful.
[02:42:34.987 --> 02:42:36.808]  He had a few little things he had to follow.
[02:42:36.828 --> 02:42:37.288]  No, no, no.
[02:42:37.729 --> 02:42:39.690]  No, we have more power than Adolf Hitler.
[02:42:41.011 --> 02:42:53.961]  In an Associated Press interview, former Powell Chief of Staff Lawrence Wilkerson also said that President Bush was too aloof, too distant from the details of post-war planning, underlings exploited Bush's detachment, and made poor decisions, Wilkerson said.
[02:42:55.149 --> 02:42:57.331]  He blamed Vice President Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others.
[02:42:57.591 --> 02:43:08.100]  And then Rumsfeld says he never talked to Bush about the war, when it turns out that Bush is literally bike-riding three hours a day, lifting weights an hour a day, taking a two-hour nap, and playing video games.
[02:43:09.521 --> 02:43:11.082]  I mean, he's just an absolute twit.
[02:43:13.544 --> 02:43:14.505]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:43:16.586 --> 02:43:16.967]  Here's one.
[02:43:17.027 --> 02:43:18.388]  FBI plays Big Brother.
[02:43:18.408 --> 02:43:20.169]  The FBI is behaving like Big Brother again.
[02:43:20.189 --> 02:43:21.130]  This is Toledo Blade.
[02:43:21.591 --> 02:43:22.812]  Conducting surveillance on U.S.
[02:43:22.852 --> 02:43:24.373]  citizens without regard to guidelines.
[02:43:25.103 --> 02:43:27.505]  It is supposed to follow to keep its operations above board.
[02:43:28.045 --> 02:43:30.006]  And those guidelines themselves are illegal.
[02:43:30.987 --> 02:43:36.471]  What's worse is that once these breaches were pointed out, the agency brushed them off as no big deal.
[02:43:38.072 --> 02:43:42.055]  Then it gets into how they're using it in non-terror-related cases and harassing people.
[02:43:42.535 --> 02:43:48.879]  The FBI's been caught coast-to-coast running whores, prostitution, drugs, murder for hire from Boston to L.A.
[02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:52.322]  I mean, you give somebody power and anonymity, what do you think happens?
[02:43:53.931 --> 02:43:59.674]  But no, let's have no oversight of statistically the most dangerous thing on earth, government.
[02:44:00.575 --> 02:44:01.435]  Let's just trust it.
[02:44:02.776 --> 02:44:08.239]  CNN of course has fired the operator who had the giant X over Cheney's face, and of course it did turn out that was on purpose.
[02:44:12.781 --> 02:44:14.582]  Blair's approval rating is down to 30%.
[02:44:14.622 --> 02:44:15.062]  Bush's is down to 28%.
[02:44:15.162 --> 02:44:16.843]  We should all be concerned.
[02:44:22.935 --> 02:44:30.977]  Because the globalists could carry out some type of terror event at any time to boost that back up, unless they want to hang Bush out to dry and just let the whole agenda keep going forward.
[02:44:31.277 --> 02:44:36.638]  And it seems they're positioning Hillary and all the rest of them to, even after Bush gets burned, just keep it rolling.
[02:44:36.738 --> 02:44:37.759]  Oh, the war's good.
[02:44:38.419 --> 02:44:39.239]  Now it's liberal.
[02:44:39.279 --> 02:44:41.139]  Now you're an evil right-winger if you're against it.
[02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:45.240]  Ex-Powell aide criticized detainee effort.
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:47.761]  Again, I am just proud of that article.
[02:44:48.974 --> 02:44:50.074]  Glad he's telling the truth there.
[02:44:50.515 --> 02:44:52.875]  Rumsfeld, again, don't call them insurgents.
[02:44:53.335 --> 02:44:58.377]  More than two and a half years into the Iraq War, Donald H. Rumsfeld has decided the enemy are not insurgents.
[02:44:58.897 --> 02:45:01.338]  This is a group of people who don't merit that word insurgency.
[02:45:01.638 --> 02:45:07.019]  I think Rumsfeld said Tuesday at Pentagon News Conference, he said that he thought he had come to him suddenly over the Thanksgiving weekend.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:08.120]  It was
[02:45:10.635 --> 02:45:15.499]  Empathy, whatever that means, rum-salt, comments, crude chuckles, but he had a serious side.
[02:45:15.519 --> 02:45:18.121]  And you watch folks, they're going to stop calling them insurgents.
[02:45:18.161 --> 02:45:20.743]  He says homicide bomber, the media says, yes sir.
[02:45:21.304 --> 02:45:26.748]  He can say an elephant was a pigeon, and then the news will start referring to pigeons as elephants.
[02:45:28.530 --> 02:45:30.772]  Or elephants to pigeons.
[02:45:38.218 --> 02:45:43.680]  Webster's New World College Dictionary defines the term insurgent as rising up against established authority.
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:48.702]  Of course, they really don't want what this group surely are, and that's the resistance.
[02:45:49.702 --> 02:46:02.307]  And whether that... people think of that as a good thing, because people instinctively know government's bad, so resistance is always thought of as positive, when in reality it's the proper name for them, whether they're good or bad.
[02:46:02.847 --> 02:46:06.188]  Resistance just means against the dominant power.
[02:46:06.764 --> 02:46:15.930]  They are the resistance, that's the proper use of the word, but because it has a connotation of good, Rumsfeld said do not use resistance, use enemy combatant, use insurgent.
[02:46:16.311 --> 02:46:23.355]  Now he's decided that insurgent sounds too much like resistance, so don't use that.
[02:46:24.956 --> 02:46:27.138]  And yes, go back to the word terrorist.
[02:46:31.821 --> 02:46:32.422]  Listen to this.
[02:46:33.382 --> 02:46:41.608]  The ACLU has gotten caught red-handed saying that checkpoints, random searches, total Nazi Germany in Miami is wonderful and not a violation of the Constitution.
[02:46:41.949 --> 02:46:54.438]  They've now had to backpedal, but the way they backpedal is, well this is Alessandra Mita's ACLU statement on Miami's SHIELD program.
[02:46:57.216 --> 02:47:00.517]  She says there's some confusion over the specifics of the Miami Shield program.
[02:47:00.817 --> 02:47:03.658]  Really, the police chief and the deputy police chief have been all over the news telling us what it is.
[02:47:04.079 --> 02:47:08.300]  Just gangs of men dressed like Darth Vader shoving us around, grabbing at our IDs.
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:09.561]  I mean, we know what it is, ladies.
[02:47:09.581 --> 02:47:11.081]  It's a shakedown here in the prison.
[02:47:11.802 --> 02:47:20.005]  Reports differ as to whether the plan involves large squads of officers stopping everyone at a local locale and then demanding people to produce an identification.
[02:47:20.245 --> 02:47:21.905]  Well, that's what they say it is!
[02:47:22.546 --> 02:47:23.466]  There's confusion?
[02:47:24.631 --> 02:47:29.174]  See, anytime they get in trouble, they then back off a little bit, but then continue the program.
[02:47:29.734 --> 02:47:38.279]  Although the Miami Police Department has claimed that the Miami Shield will respect people's rights, much of it is constitutional, will depend on how the program is implemented.
[02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:42.161]  And they just go on to basically repeat the same thing.
[02:47:44.102 --> 02:47:46.964]  Imagine you're with your family at the shopping mall, there's a bunch of guys,
[02:47:47.877 --> 02:47:53.039]  Big ol' arms and tattoos and just looking for trouble and, did you see your ID?
[02:47:53.279 --> 02:47:54.499]  Well, no you don't.
[02:47:54.799 --> 02:47:55.720]  What do you got to hide?
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:59.041]  And already, folks, we told you year after year they do this.
[02:48:00.361 --> 02:48:02.882]  They pull you over and they go, mind if I search the car?
[02:48:02.922 --> 02:48:04.603]  And I go, why are you even asking, officer?
[02:48:04.643 --> 02:48:06.403]  Because you know it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:48:06.483 --> 02:48:06.723]  No.
[02:48:07.564 --> 02:48:09.304]  And now you're going to say, what do you have to hide?
[02:48:09.324 --> 02:48:11.065]  Yeah, what do you have to hide?
[02:48:11.085 --> 02:48:11.825]  And that's what they say.
[02:48:13.766 --> 02:48:15.827]  And... Nothing!
[02:48:16.067 --> 02:48:17.047]  This is a free country, Bubba!
[02:48:17.975 --> 02:48:19.296]  Well, you know, things have changed.
[02:48:19.876 --> 02:48:23.659]  Yeah, the border is more wide open than ever, and you're here wanting to shake me down.
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:26.841]  When statistically, you're more criminal than anyone else.
[02:48:28.242 --> 02:48:31.345]  If anybody needs to have probable cause on them, it's you, officer.
[02:48:31.545 --> 02:48:32.405]  Now back off!
[02:48:33.907 --> 02:48:34.627]  Back off!
[02:48:35.948 --> 02:48:40.912]  No, we said it's going to start in the cars and the planes and be on the streets.
[02:48:41.272 --> 02:48:41.892]  Now it is.
[02:48:42.173 --> 02:48:44.854]  Now they're coming to your house and saying, what do you have to hide?
[02:48:44.915 --> 02:48:45.335]  Let me in.
[02:48:47.499 --> 02:48:50.418]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:52.391]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:17.134]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:17.534 --> 02:49:23.497]  It's on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:23.557 --> 02:49:25.418]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:52:02.249 --> 02:52:17.442]  I want to try to cram a few final phone calls in here from Kevin and Steve before we end this broadcast, but I also wanted to just have a chance to read a couple of lines out of these articles here.
[02:52:19.705 --> 02:52:22.947]  High Tech Repo Man keeps car payments coming.
[02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:39.619]  And it says that every car that sold off the lot from Patriot Audio Sales in Norfolk, Virginia has this little code box that if you don't have the code that renews every day, you can't start your car.
[02:52:41.881 --> 02:52:43.082]  And at the same time,
[02:52:44.713 --> 02:52:53.217]  A lot of car companies are now putting into the cars a little kill switch that the police, it's called a Zapper I think, can automatically kill your system.
[02:52:53.257 --> 02:52:55.739]  Just more of how we're all being treated like slaves.
[02:52:55.759 --> 02:53:09.325]  And then a really, really scary article here out of the London Guardian about how they're going to have airplanes, use satellites, you name it, in the EU, in Europe, in England.
[02:53:10.427 --> 02:53:17.560]  Digital mapping systems to then look with heat resonance and see if too much heat's coming out of your house, out of your chimney, or out of your doors.
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:19.965]  And then they're going to come and fine and fee you, so.
[02:53:20.874 --> 02:53:21.854]  That's what they're doing with that.
[02:53:22.294 --> 02:53:35.778]  And then there's this Feds to fund controversial school surveillance, New Standard Magazine, and they admit in here, which is really good news to have them admitting it in mainstream news, that it's all federally paid for, face scanning, thumb scanning, but now the Feds are angry because people are resisting it.
[02:53:36.318 --> 02:53:41.899]  So now they're advising the school districts, and there's a bunch of new federal funding, for integrated physical security systems.
[02:53:43.139 --> 02:53:51.026]  Which would include non-obtrusive sensors to detect drugs and weapons, as well as to track students, staff, visitors, and intruders on school grounds.
[02:53:51.426 --> 02:53:57.972]  It also asks applicants to develop systems that enable law enforcement personnel to track the time and place that students enter and exit school buses.
[02:53:58.613 --> 02:54:09.442]  In one of the more controversial areas of the grant solicitation, the feds state that non-cooperative identification and tracking is preferred over cooperative or RFID tracker chips or face scanning technology.
[02:54:10.302 --> 02:54:13.483]  And it just gets into how it's being implemented with RFID and all the rest of it.
[02:54:14.024 --> 02:54:14.904]  Total prison!
[02:54:15.144 --> 02:54:16.364]  The schools are prisons!
[02:54:18.765 --> 02:54:20.826]  And just so you guys know, when I came in, I didn't have audio.
[02:54:20.846 --> 02:54:23.547]  Whenever we're going to these calls, I'm probably going to need that.
[02:54:23.607 --> 02:54:25.868]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin and Mass.
[02:54:25.908 --> 02:54:26.469]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:54:27.289 --> 02:54:29.430]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:34.392]  I just had a couple of news items myself that I wanted to see if you had a news comment on.
[02:54:34.712 --> 02:54:39.974]  This is per Tom Hannigan, who's been testifying on the Fitzgerald Grand Jury.
[02:54:40.758 --> 02:54:55.062]  And he's been saying that Jose Padilla's sister, named Lana Padilla, is Terry Lynn Nichols' first wife from the Oklahoma City bombing, and that Jose Padilla... Yeah, and listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:54:55.102 --> 02:54:56.162]  We're just out of time, sir.
[02:54:56.182 --> 02:54:58.582]  If you call me back tomorrow, I can comment on that.
[02:55:00.483 --> 02:55:09.265]  Tom and those guys also said that one of the people from one of the airplanes that crashed on 9-11 had been found alive.
[02:55:11.076 --> 02:55:15.839]  And, uh, Barbara Olson, I mean, where's the proof of that?
[02:55:15.859 --> 02:55:19.060]  I just really don't have any comments to that whole crew of people.
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:22.262]  I mean, great, they can go print whatever they want and say whatever they want.
[02:55:22.642 --> 02:55:24.323]  Where's the indictments of Cheney and Bush?
[02:55:24.863 --> 02:55:25.223]  Where is it?
[02:55:25.243 --> 02:55:26.084]  I mean, maybe it's true.
[02:55:26.144 --> 02:55:28.705]  Maybe I just... We're out of time.
[02:55:29.105 --> 02:55:29.926]  Steve in Texas.
[02:55:30.266 --> 02:55:30.926]  No, Tennessee.
[02:55:30.986 --> 02:55:31.467]  Last caller.
[02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:31.787]  Go ahead.
[02:55:32.707 --> 02:55:33.108]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:33.408 --> 02:55:33.608]  Hi.
[02:55:34.028 --> 02:55:34.929]  Well, you kind of covered it.
[02:55:34.969 --> 02:55:37.610]  That's what I was going to ask you about, the Barbara Olson thing.
[02:55:38.764 --> 02:55:41.326]  Isn't that, what do they call that, synchronicity?
[02:55:41.907 --> 02:55:42.807]  Or serendipity?
[02:55:42.887 --> 02:55:44.188]  One's positive, one's neutral.
[02:55:45.109 --> 02:55:49.412]  But it's funny, he called in about that and you brought up Barbara Olsen.
[02:55:50.013 --> 02:56:04.804]  I mean just, those articles that were written had countries, bordering countries that didn't border, had people paying in money that those countries haven't had for three years, had just, it was just, it'd be like if I said Ronald McDonald is coming back to earth for the second coming.
[02:56:04.864 --> 02:56:06.045]  I mean it just, there's no,
[02:56:06.778 --> 02:56:11.799]  I mean, what am I supposed to... I don't attack people, I don't get involved in all this, but people should have some discernment.
[02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:15.640]  Today is September 22nd.
[02:56:19.481 --> 02:56:20.141]  What does that mean?
[02:56:20.201 --> 02:56:20.802]  I'm confused.
[02:56:20.822 --> 02:56:23.422]  The article on his website.
[02:56:25.423 --> 02:56:26.503]  As of this year, you mean?
[02:56:26.683 --> 02:56:30.584]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
