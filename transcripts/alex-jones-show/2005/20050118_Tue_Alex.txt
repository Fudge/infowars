[00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:09.895]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.376]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.037]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.722]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:41.806]  Already Tuesday, the 18th day of January 2005.
[00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.668]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:48.050]  Wide open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.752]  And masses of vital news and information.
[00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:54.134]  Toll-free number to join us, on air, 1-800-255-99231.
[00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.095]  There's been an earthquake in the ocean off Japan, a 6+.
[00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:15.026]  And they're also panicking down in southern South America because of different seismic reports that they could have a tsunami.
[00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:28.216]  And the Earth is definitely in the middle of a, well let's just say, a speeding up cycle where we're having more volcanic, more tectonic, more bizarre weather.
[00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:36.045]  Now the question is, have human beings caused this, or exacerbated it, or is this just part of the normal cycle of this planet?
[00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:42.548]  Certainly, long before human beings existed, there were even greater calamities that were happening.
[00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:58.036]  I think we think a little bit too much of ourselves to always think that it's human beings doing this, though with the case of the tsunami, we do have Defense Department documents admitting that they have these
[00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:04.875]  These weapons that can cause tsunamis, water weapons, tsunami bombs, as they're called.
[00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:09.137]  We know that Secretary of Defense Cohen talked about tectonic weapons back in 1997.
[00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:16.520]  We know they introduced a bill in 2001 to restrict these weapons in the Congress that was defeated.
[00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:20.882]  But still, we'll get more into that as well.
[00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:22.862]  But I didn't spend enough time on this yesterday.
[00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:24.183]  I want to spend some more time on it.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.242]  Iraq anger at abuser's jail term.
[00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:30.763]  I thought it was torturer's jail term.
[00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:36.687]  Iraqis have reacted angrily to a 10-year sentence imposed on a U.S.
[00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:41.189]  soldier for abusing inmates at Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad.
[00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.114]  Well, murderers in this country get four and a half years, so I'd actually say that if you want to judge it according to that, it's a pretty good sentence.
[00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.236]  Many said Specialist Charles
[00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:56.125]  Well, I have no doubt that Mr. Greiner is a sadist.
[00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:26.896]  I mean, he walked up to the cameras and said, we'll see what type of monster I really am.
[00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.237]  I mean, he looks like a psychopath.
[00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:34.179]  But the mafia hires psychopaths to go out and break people's legs!
[00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:42.142]  The mafia is just as guilty as when their soldiers go out and squeeze money out of little old ladies.
[00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:49.145]  In fact, the capos, the mob bosses, their dons,
[00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:57.562]  They get even bigger prison sentences, and rightfully so, than those breaking the fingers and the legs and the arms.
[00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:03.327]  And I don't think that even some of our listeners realize what the Army admits.
[00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:08.951]  The stuff that's gotten wide circulation and publication is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:15.195]  We're talking about raping and murdering and beating innocent people to death at 32 camps.
[00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:28.361]  This all just went public because these fools were stupid enough to think just because they were ordered to do it, they could take photos of it and pass them around like baseball cards, which they've admitted they did.
[00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:30.982]  That's the only reason you're hearing about this.
[00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:42.288]  So I want to talk about torture, and I want to like the listeners to chime in about this, but not just about these cases of torture, but how you hear people out there in the media condoning it, saying it's good.
[00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:44.870]  What's happened to us?
[00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:52.544]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.228]  Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break, so please stay with us.
[00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:05.460]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.062]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:14.584]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:15.985]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:17.526]  Animergy.
[00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.166]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:47.386]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:10.499]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:21.985]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:28.028]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:34.933]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:41.958]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:43.999]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.321]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.242]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[00:06:48.422 --> 00:06:49.383]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-443-APEX-888
[00:06:56.948 --> 00:07:08.331]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:13.372]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:17.453]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:20.634]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:27.801]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:36.629]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:43.276]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:47.280]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.041]  We're so sure it works, we guarantee it.

[00:07:50.823 --> 00:07:51.283]  Big Brother.
[00:07:51.303 --> 00:07:51.884]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:09.876]  Hello, my friends.
[00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:12.257]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:40.936]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-255-99231.
[00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:45.919]  This broadcast is not about left or right, it's about right or wrong.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:59.028]  Example of this, I heard a talk show host this morning, national talk show host, talking about the evil liberals that want to drug all of America's school children.
[00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:04.171]  And how they want to put them on Ritalin and Prozac, and how they're a bunch of control freaks.
[00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:07.228]  And I thought, man, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:32.229]  But why aren't you mentioning that George Bush helped ram through, and his buddies wrote, the New Freedom Initiative that passed a month and a half ago that would forcibly, psychologically test every school child and teenager in the country, and then will even start forcibly, psychologically testing pregnant women.
[00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:35.556]  Everybody gets the social worker visits.
[00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:38.599]  The guidelines were written by the drug companies.
[00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:46.307]  They openly brag that they'll go from 15% of the children being on drugs, mind-bending drugs, to 50%.
[00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:50.372]  And boy, it's going to be a big profitable venture.
[00:09:51.973 --> 00:09:53.335]  So again, double think.
[00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:58.348]  Think about how hypocritical that is.
[00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:05.095]  I'm about stopping these programs, not just talking about, oh, the Democrats are evil all day.
[00:10:06.557 --> 00:10:09.600]  Because both parties are run by the same organization.
[00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.964]  The Global Crime Syndicate, known as the New World Order.
[00:10:13.164 --> 00:10:15.807]  Here's another example from the other side of the false paradigm.
[00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:17.176]  Democrats!
[00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:18.597]  Oh, Ashcroft is evil!
[00:10:19.278 --> 00:10:21.099]  Oh, Alberto Gonzalez is evil!
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.820]  Oh, they're for torture!
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.241]  Oh, they're for the Patriot Act!
[00:10:24.641 --> 00:10:26.923]  Oh my gosh, they're taking all of our freedoms!
[00:10:27.263 --> 00:10:28.604]  National ID cards!
[00:10:28.964 --> 00:10:31.566]  Bush is butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution!
[00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:33.908]  Oh, the Democrats need to save us!
[00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:40.172]  Bill Clinton ran through the Anti-Terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act.
[00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:41.713]  It was really Patriot Act 1.
[00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:42.914]  Much of what was in
[00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:50.796]  The first Patriot Act that passed in 2001 after the attacks was written by Bill Clinton's minions, but they couldn't pass it.
[00:10:52.678 --> 00:11:08.052]  The Democrats voted in the House and Senate for Patriot 1 and Patriot 2, and the National ID Card, and the Total Information Awareness Network, and the TIPS Program in greater numbers than Republicans!
[00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:10.434]  So see,
[00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.094]  There's this mental illness out there.
[00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.757]  It's hard to describe how incredible it is.
[00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:33.671]  What the establishment does is it has the Republicans and Democrats go out, that is the leaders of the parties, there's some real fights at the mid and lower levels, but at the higher levels, the campaign chairman and the heads of the committees and the governors, it's really a staged event.
[00:11:34.887 --> 00:11:55.121]  They go out and they have a fight over some made-up issue, or some wedge issue, some hot-button, balkanizing, divide-and-conquer issue, and we all focus on it like it's a football game, and draw the battle lines, and pick which side we're on, and go out and cheer on our party.
[00:11:57.242 --> 00:12:02.926]  And meanwhile, both the parties have got the same owner, to use a football analogy, or
[00:12:03.658 --> 00:12:05.019]  Here's a racehorse analogy.
[00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:07.161]  The Mafia owns all the horses.
[00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:08.482]  They don't lose.
[00:12:08.742 --> 00:12:10.844]  So you think you're betting on different horses.
[00:12:11.104 --> 00:12:15.988]  You think there's some type of chance in all of this and it's all rigged!
[00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:25.937]  And so, Democrats think that everything will be alright if they just get the Democratic Party back into power.
[00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:28.339]  Why, they'll stop all this police state.
[00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:34.434]  And the conservatives sit up there on talk radio and go, man, if we just... George Bush is good.
[00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:35.855]  He'll deal with the open borders.
[00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:37.376]  He'll deal with the gun control.
[00:12:37.816 --> 00:12:40.418]  He'll deal with the UN and UNESCO.
[00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:44.100]  And he'll deal with... because he has all this rhetoric about how he's for it.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.043]  You know, how he's for stopping the UN while he actually radically increases their funding.
[00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:51.806]  It's good cop, bad cop, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:52.006 --> 00:12:53.787]  The Democrats play good cop, bad cop.
[00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:56.449]  And if you're a Democrat, then the Democrats are the good cop.
[00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.392]  And if you're a Republican, then the Republicans are the good cop.
[00:12:59.952 --> 00:13:01.053]  And the Democrats are the bad cop.
[00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:02.094]  Vice versa.
[00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:07.778]  There were Roman handbooks written 2,000 years ago.
[00:13:07.798 --> 00:13:08.859]  2,100 years ago.
[00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:14.696]  There were British handbooks written.
[00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:16.137]  These are published.
[00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:17.319]  These have been republished.
[00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:20.842]  One of them is The Battle for Gaul by Julius Caesar.
[00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:24.005]  Written by Julius Caesar!
[00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:26.908]  And you ought to go get that book.
[00:13:27.008 --> 00:13:28.270]  And you should go to the library.
[00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.251]  You should check it out.
[00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:31.553]  You should start reading more, folks.
[00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:33.975]  I'm not being sardonic or sitting up here on a high horse.
[00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:35.136]  You should go read it.
[00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:37.684]  We need to get back to that as Americans.
[00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:49.050]  And go read how he describes staging fights between different chiefs, and acting like he's with one group and another, and manipulating, and all these staged rhetoric events.
[00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:55.973]  Go read Machiavelli's The Prince.
[00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:58.554]  He wrote two books, but I suggest The Prince.
[00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:05.358]  This is a guy 500 years ago in Italy, talking about manipulating people and how politics really operated.
[00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:08.959]  And it'll be everything you see today!
[00:14:11.386 --> 00:14:12.730]  Everything you see today!
[00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:15.148]  So just stop being fooled.
[00:14:15.268 --> 00:14:16.448]  Stop being conned.
[00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:18.349]  We're going to lose our borders.
[00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.190]  We're going to lose our sovereignty.
[00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.811]  We're going to lose our Second Amendment.
[00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:26.153]  We're going to be forcibly psychologically tested and forcibly psychologically drugged.
[00:14:26.673 --> 00:14:27.294]  It's admitted.
[00:14:27.314 --> 00:14:28.074]  They're passing it.
[00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:29.795]  They're putting in the National ID Card.
[00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:31.275]  And they wouldn't tell you about it.
[00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:34.197]  It was nowhere in the mainstream media until after they passed it.
[00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.858]  Now it's in USA Today.
[00:14:36.138 --> 00:14:38.899]  Now it's in AP, Reuters, Time, Newsday.
[00:14:39.439 --> 00:14:44.643]  Oh, you didn't know it, but a national ID card was passed, and now you're gonna have to submit to it.
[00:14:44.663 --> 00:14:53.329]  Oh, you didn't know it, but now there's a federal plan to make you all take transponders in your cars at the state level through federal mandates to track and trace what you do.
[00:14:53.349 --> 00:15:05.557]  Oh, and you didn't know it, but all these cameras the feds have put up in every town and city in the country, they're scanning your faces and scanning your license plates and tracking you, and oh, the Total Information Awareness Network really didn't get canceled.
[00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:08.859]  We just changed the name and doubled the funding and we're watching everything!
[00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:09.419]  You do?
[00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:13.781]  We're watching everything but the border and everything but the terrorists that we fund!
[00:15:17.043 --> 00:15:19.124]  And now we're going to talk about torture.
[00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:24.427]  Iraqi anger and abusers jail term.
[00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:30.270]  Let's go ahead and play this BBC clip and I think this says it all.
[00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.630]  Here it is.
[00:15:31.405 --> 00:15:37.049]  Charles Grainer chose not to take the stand in his trial, but just before sentencing, he did.
[00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:42.333]  Speaking for more than two hours, he admitted a lot at Abu Ghraib had been wrong.
[00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.774]  Well, there were a lot of things that were wrong.
[00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:49.337]  Inside, Grainer told the jury he'd just done what he was told.
[00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:55.722]  When he tried to protest, he said, he was told by a senior officer, they're in charge, follow their orders.
[00:15:56.741 --> 00:16:01.883]  But Graynor was visibly center stage in many of the now notorious pictures of abuse.
[00:16:02.424 --> 00:16:07.826]  Prosecutors called him a ringleader, a bully who abused prisoners for sport, for laughs.
[00:16:08.586 --> 00:16:15.409]  He was found guilty of multiple counts of assault, including beating detainees and forcing them to perform sexual acts.
[00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.351]  He's the fifth soldier to be convicted, but the first to plead innocent.
[00:16:21.092 --> 00:16:23.593]  In community hindsight, I'm saying orders.
[00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:27.766]  And he would have committed a crime if he did not obey orders.
[00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:29.809]  So he was doomed either way.
[00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.415]  The abuse at Applegrade shocks the world and damaged the reputation of the U.S.
[00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:35.936]  military.
[00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:42.104]  Critics say the whole administration is tarnished and wants more inquiries, going right to the top.
[00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:48.006]  But American officials say it was down to rogue individuals, like Rayner.
[00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:56.879]  They point to the prison terms as proof they've taken the matter seriously, and are trying to bring an end to this acutely embarrassing episode.
[00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:59.723]  Jill McGivery, BBC News, Washington.
[00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:14.293]  Alright, so let me just go over this and then we'll go to break and we'll come back and take calls and get into all the other world news that's going on with the economy and the war and more talk of drafts, a national draft conscription.
[00:17:15.514 --> 00:17:18.316]  But don't worry, they're not going to call it a draft, it's going to be called Selective Service.
[00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:22.018]  So if we change the name, we kept our promise, no draft.
[00:17:23.138 --> 00:17:29.162]  But the Army's own report, two separate reports, General Togundu and others,
[00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:45.363]  There are 32 camps, not just Abu Ghraib, and they say that 75 to 90 percent of those at the camps are families or individuals who did not have their papers in order picked up at checkpoints.
[00:17:47.063 --> 00:17:53.865]  The Army's report describes things, and this is on the Associated Press, MSNBC, it's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:54.165 --> 00:17:59.667]  Just type in Army's Report on Torture and several different reports will pop up.
[00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:05.564]  Things we can't mention on air, but they include raping women in front of their husbands.
[00:18:06.705 --> 00:18:11.389]  One of the reports includes raping people's children in front of them, torturing children in front of their parents.
[00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.572]  Folks, there's no excuse for torturing children, period.
[00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:17.435]  I know that on Threat Matrix and 24 and shows like
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.661]  Spooks, a big spy drama show they have in England.
[00:18:25.002 --> 00:18:27.022]  We have links to this on Infowars.com.
[00:18:27.382 --> 00:18:31.004]  They simulate torturing people's children to get answers to stop terror attacks.
[00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:32.284]  Oh, but it's gotta be done.
[00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.465]  Torturing children's good.
[00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:36.105]  Again, it's not just happening in the real world.
[00:18:36.145 --> 00:18:43.128]  They're also mutating our minds, bathing us, basting us, marinating us in this evil.
[00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:48.850]  And, uh, you know, this, uh, Greiner guy,
[00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:53.180]  This individual was a prison guard.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.720]  Most of these people were federal prison guards.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.541]  They've been having this fun for years.
[00:18:56.981 --> 00:19:00.862]  I can't tell you how many hundreds of reports I've seen in the years where it's admitted.
[00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:19.749]  I can think of three prisons within 40 miles of where I sit where they have admitted that they would videotape mass raping of the women, where they would film these horrible porno videos, where they would torture people to death, hang people in their cells.
[00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:22.326]  Just where I live!
[00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:24.307]  At these prisons.
[00:19:25.827 --> 00:19:27.308]  This is going on everywhere!
[00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:31.310]  And they were ordered to do it.
[00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.472]  It's called Operation Copper Green over in Iraq.
[00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:42.435]  And Gonzales' memo is out there public about we're going to torture people right up until death.
[00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:47.318]  And if they have organ failure and die and we didn't mean to do it, then it's not murder.
[00:19:48.598 --> 00:19:50.079]  And besides, we're above the law.
[00:19:50.894 --> 00:19:51.955]  We can torture people!
[00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:58.179]  Folks, they have a program going full bore that can't train you except torture.
[00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:05.544]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:14.550]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:16.912]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[00:20:17.612 --> 00:20:18.193]  While you listen,
[00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:23.572]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:20:24.192 --> 00:20:25.753]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:20:26.293 --> 00:20:28.455]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:31.076]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:20:31.637 --> 00:20:32.737]  And it's so easy.
[00:20:33.438 --> 00:20:35.519]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:36.900]  When you want.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.080]  Where you want.
[00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:43.824]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.

[00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:07.344]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.805 --> 00:21:15.589]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:23.773]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:28.855]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:33.876]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.396 --> 00:21:38.258]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.758 --> 00:21:39.778]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:07.149]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.492]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:13.192 --> 00:22:20.236]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.118 --> 00:22:29.905]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[00:23:53.946 --> 00:24:06.276]  Now when you look at the Democrats and Republicans from Alan Dershowitz to Homeland Security
[00:24:23.806 --> 00:24:30.193]  Leader, Governor Ridge, they are all saying and doing the exact same things.
[00:24:30.313 --> 00:24:31.394]  They're reading off a script.
[00:24:33.116 --> 00:24:38.441]  We've got the Secretary of Defense coming out years ago and going, yeah, we're torturing people.
[00:24:38.922 --> 00:24:43.807]  And the editorials in the New York Times, time to get out the pliers and the rubber hoses.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.441]  They tried to sell us on it.
[00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:48.743]  Then we saw some of the lighter images.
[00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:56.249]  They did not release the thousands of other ones that members of Congress saw of the stuff a thousand times more grisly than what we did witness.
[00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.512]  And so they're kind of titrating the dose.
[00:24:59.612 --> 00:25:00.372]  Building it up.
[00:25:00.873 --> 00:25:03.575]  Building our tolerance level to it.
[00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:05.477]  Training us that it's okay.
[00:25:05.517 --> 00:25:07.318]  That, oh, it's just some fun.
[00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:09.580]  Just some blowing off some steam.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.882]  What are people getting so upset about?
[00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:22.008]  And then meanwhile, the media is out there in the fiction department promoting these scenarios of torture and all these different dramas.
[00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:25.090]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:30.474]  So in the middle of all these convictions of people saying, hey, I was ordered to do this.
[00:25:30.594 --> 00:25:31.475]  Well, of course they were.
[00:25:31.515 --> 00:25:32.716]  The documents have been released.
[00:25:33.697 --> 00:25:38.560]  You were ordered to do this by the CIA and private contractors and army intelligence on record.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.001]  They go, well, that's fine.
[00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:42.043]  You're still going to be convicted of this.
[00:25:43.809 --> 00:26:01.636]  This is like a trial where they send out a mafia soldier to break somebody's legs, as I said earlier, and then it comes out in the newspapers that the mob boss grabs their soldier and then sits as the judge over them and says, you're bad, and passes judgment on them.
[00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:04.598]  It's just so hypocritical.
[00:26:05.498 --> 00:26:06.719]  It's off the charts.
[00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.880]  It's just unspeakable.
[00:26:11.317 --> 00:26:16.240]  But meanwhile, in the middle of all this, Governor Ridge comes out and says, hey, torture's needed sometimes.
[00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:19.602]  And gives a ridiculous excuse or example of why.
[00:26:19.882 --> 00:26:25.166]  You know, somebody's got a nuclear weapon they're about to detonate and only torture will get the information.
[00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:26.186]  Maybe torture's good.
[00:26:26.907 --> 00:26:30.489]  Well, I saw those type of arguments in law enforcement magazines before 9-11.
[00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:37.013]  There's one magazine, what, The Firearms and Weapons of Law Enforcement, an April issue back in, what, 2000.
[00:26:39.276 --> 00:26:41.598]  Anthrax is going to be released.
[00:26:41.678 --> 00:26:43.941]  Thousands will die only by torturing.
[00:26:43.961 --> 00:26:44.801]  Can you get the answer?
[00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:45.802]  Torture is good.
[00:26:46.683 --> 00:26:48.125]  All of this being promoted.
[00:26:48.165 --> 00:26:58.635]  It's the same agenda, the same little moral games that they play where situational ethics
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.851]  Which they have in the public schools now for the last 30 years, where they play Spaceship, or Lifeboat, or Desert Island.
[00:27:06.071 --> 00:27:09.177]  But there's only enough resources on the life raft for 10 people.
[00:27:09.921 --> 00:27:13.123]  But there's 20 people in the class that represents the Lockboat.
[00:27:13.604 --> 00:27:14.864]  10 of you have to die!
[00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:16.866]  Now let's decide who's needed.
[00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:18.587]  We need a policeman.
[00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:20.969]  We need a... We need a this and a that.
[00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.169]  Oh!
[00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:22.730]  We don't need these people.
[00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.071]  They're gonna have to die.
[00:27:24.131 --> 00:27:27.033]  So see, this is being introduced into our minds.
[00:27:27.253 --> 00:27:30.675]  We're being taught just how to be sickos, folks.
[00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:35.218]  They're changing our morals, reaching into our minds, twisting them.
[00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:38.981]  And there's a worse clip I found on the web of Limbaugh.
[00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:45.219]  For some reason we can't pull that up on the computer, where he actually just said, so what, this is war, it's good.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.082]  But here's one clip where he likens the stuff at Abu Ghraib to just a college fraternity.
[00:27:51.402 --> 00:27:54.324]  Yes, they even released photos of people beaten to death.
[00:27:55.145 --> 00:27:55.845]  Beaten to death.
[00:27:56.085 --> 00:28:01.688]  At Abu Ghraib they admit that they sodomized people with large devices dripping with battery acid.
[00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:06.491]  I mean, that's in the Army report, so that's having a little fun.
[00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:08.512]  So next time a serial killer
[00:28:09.423 --> 00:28:11.346]  He grabs a woman off the street and does this to her.
[00:28:11.727 --> 00:28:15.652]  I guess he should just go to the court and say, hey, I was just having some fun blowing off some steam.
[00:28:16.113 --> 00:28:19.137]  Or I guess Joseph Mengele was blowing off some steam in the Nazi death camps.
[00:28:19.378 --> 00:28:20.039]  Here's that clip.
[00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:23.193]  It's psychologically wrong with that.
[00:28:23.633 --> 00:28:24.714]  It's not the act so much.
[00:28:24.754 --> 00:28:30.515]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[00:28:31.435 --> 00:28:33.135]  Exactly my point!
[00:28:33.435 --> 00:28:44.258]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives with it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we're going to really hamper them because they had a good time.
[00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.491]  These people are being fired at every day.
[00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.012]  I'm talking about people having a good time.
[00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.814]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[00:28:54.874 --> 00:28:56.795]  You ever heard of needing to blow some steam off?
[00:28:57.916 --> 00:28:59.617]  You know, I actually agree with that.
[00:28:59.657 --> 00:29:00.817]  They are blowing off steam.
[00:29:01.178 --> 00:29:08.181]  When we get back, we'll play the clip off of PBS where a family is caught stealing three sticks of wood off the side of a road.
[00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:09.222]  That's not allowed.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.181]  And, uh, by the way, the U.N.
[00:29:12.221 --> 00:29:20.108]  has announced that in Iraq and all these third world countries, there's gonna be a 50% tax, this is out of the Associated Press, on GDP paid to the U.N.
[00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:24.511]  So again, everything belongs to them, but I wanna play having a good time.
[00:29:25.212 --> 00:29:29.575]  They machine gun the vehicle, laugh about it, then run over it with a tank.
[00:29:30.436 --> 00:29:35.180]  By the way, they'll all be coming back and becoming your police officers.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.561]  And see, this will be the mindset.
[00:29:38.248 --> 00:29:42.531]  We just doled out the punishment for taking sticks of wood to cook your dinner.
[00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:44.353]  This is part of the new freedom.
[00:29:45.334 --> 00:29:46.875]  The Romans weren't even this brutal.
[00:29:46.895 --> 00:29:47.555]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:52.579]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.641]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.542 --> 00:29:58.244]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:04.128]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health.
[00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:08.050]  And let me tell you, I found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[00:30:08.491 --> 00:30:08.811]  I use it.
[00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:11.153]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[00:30:11.213 --> 00:30:13.014]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie.
[00:30:13.374 --> 00:30:17.397]  And it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[00:30:17.777 --> 00:30:19.538]  And what it is, it's a wedge device.
[00:30:19.998 --> 00:30:20.739]  Just a small one.
[00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:23.040]  That you put underneath your sacrum.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.561]  And then you get down on it.
[00:30:24.601 --> 00:30:25.962]  You put your weight down on it.
[00:30:26.042 --> 00:30:26.582]  On the floor.
[00:30:27.042 --> 00:30:28.843]  And you let gravity do the work.
[00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.585]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away.
[00:30:31.885 --> 00:30:33.266]  Chiropractors go away.
[00:30:33.306 --> 00:30:34.447]  You don't need them anymore.
[00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:35.887]  You gotta give it a try.
[00:30:36.228 --> 00:30:38.389]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.

[00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:08.415]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.836 --> 00:32:13.060]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:20.327]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.707 --> 00:32:26.813]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.953 --> 00:32:28.174]  There are no side effects.

[00:32:48.776 --> 00:32:49.997]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[00:32:50.057 --> 00:32:54.740]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.561]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.018 --> 00:33:29.421]  So, more than just talking about torture and how it's being promoted, and how it's being engaged in in these prisons all over America, then there's the line of, there are a bunch of killers in the prisons, torture them!
[00:33:31.602 --> 00:33:35.743]  Well, wait a minute, they admit that over 65% of people in prison are non-violent.
[00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:38.744]  And they're criminalizing everything.
[00:33:38.764 --> 00:33:40.444]  The Cato Institute's talked about that.
[00:33:40.464 --> 00:33:41.805]  Got a new book out.
[00:33:43.545 --> 00:33:44.485]  Straight to jail.
[00:33:45.246 --> 00:33:46.746]  The criminalization of everything.
[00:33:47.714 --> 00:33:50.696]  They're criminalizing everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:52.817 --> 00:33:59.921]  You sell a gallon of milk to somebody on a criminal or terrorist watch list, you get five years in prison, one million dollar fine.
[00:34:01.842 --> 00:34:03.043]  That's the minimum, by the way.
[00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:07.045]  This is the type of stuff that's in the Patriot Act.
[00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:08.086]  You think I'm joking?
[00:34:09.887 --> 00:34:11.288]  That was in, uh, what was it?
[00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:18.762]  Sacramento Bee, like a week ago, we covered it on air, where businesses are shutting down all over the country because they've read the law.
[00:34:19.042 --> 00:34:23.243]  Just type Patriot Act Compliance into a search engine, you'll get hundreds of thousands of links.
[00:34:25.944 --> 00:34:33.247]  The point is, total surveillance, total control, and people say, well this is just for those Arab terrorists, those sub-humans.
[00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:37.789]  I actually hear them say, sub-human, sub-human, they're animals, they're animals, they're animals, they're animals.
[00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.889]  They're animals!
[00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:40.450]  They're animals!
[00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.030]  They're animals!
[00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.610]  They're animals!
[00:34:42.031 --> 00:34:42.331]  Folks!
[00:34:43.812 --> 00:34:46.914]  A lot of the people in the Arab countries didn't ever hate America.
[00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:57.621]  They certainly didn't in Iraq during the 1980s when they were our big ally and had all the radio stations playing rock and roll music and they left Christians alone in the country.
[00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:01.503]  But our government put Saddam in, had him invade a bunch of countries.
[00:35:01.923 --> 00:35:03.904]  He followed the orders to go ahead and go into Kuwait.
[00:35:03.924 --> 00:35:04.585]  That's on record.
[00:35:04.905 --> 00:35:05.786]  They said, oh, go ahead.
[00:35:06.546 --> 00:35:07.807]  And they shut him up.
[00:35:08.843 --> 00:35:12.024]  Again, I'm not a fan of him, horrible guy, but compared to some of the other Arabs, he's nothing.
[00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:29.232]  And so now, I thought we were going into Iraq to liberate these people, and now it's, well if somebody takes a sniper pop shot at us, we are going to bulldoze, it's been going on for two years, every date palm, every tangerine orchard, everything in your town.
[00:35:29.512 --> 00:35:31.914]  We're going to arrest every man down to age 10.
[00:35:32.154 --> 00:35:35.835]  And we're going to take you to the 34 camps, the 32 camps,
[00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:39.868]  That have hundreds of thousands of people in them.
[00:35:39.908 --> 00:35:40.628]  How does that sound?
[00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:47.610]  And we're going to import sadistic jail guards who can't get away with rape and murder and killing in the U.S.
[00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.471]  And we're going to import them here to rule over you.
[00:35:51.491 --> 00:35:54.772]  And we're going to take all the Ba'athists that Saddam put into power.
[00:35:54.792 --> 00:36:01.954]  We're going to put all of them, except for a few of Saddam's family members, we're going to put all of them back into command.
[00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:03.055]  All the people you hate.
[00:36:03.355 --> 00:36:04.555]  The secret police you hate.
[00:36:07.256 --> 00:36:21.789]  And then we're going to appoint 300 plus leaders over you, then we're going to say that we're having an election, and then we're going to kill anybody that runs for election against our candidates, and then when our media picks up on it, we'll just say, well, we can't tell you who's running against our candidates because of security issues.
[00:36:22.029 --> 00:36:23.150]  Christian Science Monitor.
[00:36:24.251 --> 00:36:27.815]  Imagine an election where they don't tell you who the candidates are, because there is no election.
[00:36:29.836 --> 00:36:33.640]  But as long as we talk about an election on our news, the people will believe there's an election.
[00:36:34.645 --> 00:36:37.206]  So I want to talk about the psychology of a country.
[00:36:39.386 --> 00:36:43.907]  Of people who call into talk shows saying, torture, murder, kill.
[00:36:44.247 --> 00:36:45.467]  It's good when we do it.
[00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:52.929]  Number one, when our troops get captured, how are we going to say it's bad for the enemy to torture them?
[00:36:53.969 --> 00:36:59.271]  I guess when our airmen got shot down in Vietnam and got tortured, I guess that was okay?
[00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:00.331]  I don't think it's okay.
[00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.211]  I think it's bad.
[00:37:03.078 --> 00:37:06.401]  Oh, but the North Vietnamese said our troops were criminals, animals.
[00:37:06.921 --> 00:37:13.026]  They argued internationally that you're not under the Geneva Convention because you broke the rules of war.
[00:37:13.246 --> 00:37:15.028]  Well, that's what our government says now.
[00:37:15.288 --> 00:37:18.691]  So a new standard of barbarousness being sold.
[00:37:20.312 --> 00:37:28.198]  And 75 to 90 percent of those at the camps, Army's own report, are families picked up at checkpoints for not having their papers in order.
[00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:29.880]  We've played the clip of
[00:37:31.112 --> 00:37:47.786]  Tom Brokaw's last broadcast a few months ago where they have a reporter live in Fallujah and he says, oh yes, everyone coming back into Fallujah is given a retina scan and a thumb print and if they're caught without their ID card, they're shot on the spot.
[00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:54.131]  If they're caught without their national ID card, they are killed on the spot.
[00:37:57.759 --> 00:38:00.441]  Leave the immediate area around their homes, they're killed.
[00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:02.143]  This is after the liberation of Fallujah.
[00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:03.444]  Yes, liberating it.
[00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:09.348]  So when our troops first got there, most of the Iraqis were happy.
[00:38:09.388 --> 00:38:10.569]  They believed the propaganda.
[00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:11.690]  They believed the leaflets.
[00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:16.654]  They knew our government put Saddam in, but they figured, well, you know, maybe they're going to be nice to us.
[00:38:18.135 --> 00:38:21.297]  And then they saw that they put all the Ba'athists back into control.
[00:38:21.317 --> 00:38:22.979]  And then they saw stuff like this.
[00:38:24.113 --> 00:38:30.041]  And we've played the clips before where they're laughing as they... Look at that Iraqi bleeper, that dumb woman.
[00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:30.662]  Watch this.
[00:38:30.742 --> 00:38:31.022]  Boom.
[00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:32.264]  Man, did you see her head explode?
[00:38:32.525 --> 00:38:33.946]  Just a woman walking down the road.
[00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:35.809]  Op, she's coming up towards our position.
[00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:36.810]  Let's just go ahead and shoot her.
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.912]  And then they laugh about it!
[00:38:38.638 --> 00:38:42.859]  You know, it'd be one thing if they, it'd be sicking up if they were, well, we better just go ahead and kill her.
[00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:45.360]  Those kids are throwing rocks, you better go ahead and machine gun them.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.801]  Man, this is too bad.
[00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:50.222]  That'd be bad enough, but I'm gonna blow that kid away!
[00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:52.422]  I'm gonna blow that woman's head off, watch this.
[00:38:53.023 --> 00:38:55.403]  From, you know, 800 yards, I'm awesome.
[00:38:58.024 --> 00:39:03.406]  And just stop, and to watch this PBS clip, and there's so many of these, where, where,
[00:39:04.364 --> 00:39:05.805]  Now, listen to the troops.
[00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:07.466]  They're going, what do you got these kids with you?
[00:39:07.886 --> 00:39:08.927]  Why, they should be in school.
[00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:10.868]  This is all the country's burning.
[00:39:11.488 --> 00:39:14.650]  Weeks into the occupation, everything's shut down, the power's off.
[00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:17.051]  And this guy's playing social worker.
[00:39:17.332 --> 00:39:18.092]  What are you doing?
[00:39:18.392 --> 00:39:19.453]  Hey, why don't you, um...
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.700]  Have those kids in school.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.381]  It's a family.
[00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:23.041]  They're standing there.
[00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:23.861]  By their car.
[00:39:23.941 --> 00:39:25.102]  Caught off the side of the road.
[00:39:25.462 --> 00:39:26.342]  Picking up some wood.
[00:39:26.362 --> 00:39:27.002]  And they've been ordered.
[00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:28.243]  No one's allowed to pick up wood.
[00:39:28.303 --> 00:39:31.244]  That's foraging and hurting the environment and whatever.
[00:39:31.284 --> 00:39:32.565]  You're not supposed to be doing anything.
[00:39:32.585 --> 00:39:33.985]  Don't be out on the roads doing nothing.
[00:39:34.846 --> 00:39:37.747]  You're not gonna heat your home or cook your food.
[00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:39.787]  There's a family out there.
[00:39:40.308 --> 00:39:42.288]  There's their little white car.
[00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:44.549]  Picking up scraps of wood.
[00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:46.410]  And so this is what happens to them.
[00:39:48.112 --> 00:39:50.413]  We still see what's been going on when we arrived.
[00:39:51.493 --> 00:39:57.475]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[00:39:57.915 --> 00:40:00.016]  That child don't need to be here.
[00:40:00.176 --> 00:40:02.716]  You know what school is?
[00:40:02.756 --> 00:40:05.957]  That's what he needs to be doing, not following you.
[00:40:06.277 --> 00:40:09.659]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:16.020]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we crush it.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.841]  United States Army, tankers, who of them?
[00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:31.587]  That's what you get when you loop.
[00:40:59.858 --> 00:41:03.561]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[00:41:04.342 --> 00:41:05.803]  The car was my livelihood.
[00:41:07.504 --> 00:41:11.948]  So you've got a country that's totally shut down, the power off, everything blown to bits.
[00:41:12.509 --> 00:41:13.730]  And imagine this family.
[00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.352]  Let's go out and get some firewood.
[00:41:17.413 --> 00:41:23.217]  So they're out driving around, you see the shot, it's around some buildings in there, and foraging around for some wood.
[00:41:24.478 --> 00:41:26.220]  And imagine, you're standing there by your father.
[00:41:27.142 --> 00:41:28.303]  Your father's standing there.
[00:41:28.643 --> 00:41:30.625]  He's looking at these guys and they start laughing at you.
[00:41:30.665 --> 00:41:31.906]  Why aren't you in school?
[00:41:32.206 --> 00:41:33.127]  That's where you need to be.
[00:41:33.207 --> 00:41:34.468]  Not following this guy.
[00:41:34.488 --> 00:41:36.190]  Of course, the child doesn't even understand it.
[00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.592]  They don't just run over the car.
[00:41:38.612 --> 00:41:40.153]  That's not enough pleasure for them.
[00:41:40.393 --> 00:41:41.754]  They've got to first shoot it.
[00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:43.356]  They just start laughing.
[00:41:43.636 --> 00:41:46.839]  Ha ha!
[00:41:46.899 --> 00:41:48.240]  Now we're going to run over your car.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.361]  That's what you get when you loot.
[00:41:49.781 --> 00:41:50.842]  Now imagine that family.
[00:41:51.683 --> 00:41:54.245]  Most Iraqis, I've talked to Iraqis,
[00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.171]  We're back and forth between Iraq, and it's been in the foreign, even in the Arab press, European press.
[00:41:59.531 --> 00:42:00.752]  They were pretty happy, actually.
[00:42:00.792 --> 00:42:05.993]  Okay, maybe the sanctions are over, we're gonna get freedom, we're gonna, you know, all this stuff's over, okay, fine.
[00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:07.714]  And then all this happens.
[00:42:09.274 --> 00:42:17.876]  And somebody shoots at the American troops, and so, okay, we're gonna arrest every man down to age 10 in this city of 5,000, 6,000 people.
[00:42:18.217 --> 00:42:19.717]  We're going to bulldoze all your fields.
[00:42:21.087 --> 00:42:28.289]  And there have been reports, video of it, photos of it, the women just go out and sit with their poor children in the dust and go, I sit here and wait to die.
[00:42:29.249 --> 00:42:33.871]  And there's mass starvation, cholera, death, just exploding numbers.
[00:42:34.571 --> 00:42:37.712]  A million and a half Iraqis died from 1991 up until 2003.
[00:42:38.152 --> 00:42:41.293]  And now since the liberation, it's even worse.
[00:42:44.693 --> 00:42:47.574]  I mean, this is a holocaust.
[00:42:48.014 --> 00:42:50.375]  These are human beings, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:51.664 --> 00:42:54.106]  And by the way, the Pentagon knows this will make them fight.
[00:42:54.566 --> 00:42:56.528]  It knows this will cause the war to deepen.
[00:42:57.088 --> 00:42:58.589]  They don't want to win the war.
[00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:01.572]  It's meant to go on longer for weapon sales.
[00:43:02.312 --> 00:43:03.533]  It's meant to go on longer.
[00:43:03.793 --> 00:43:05.054]  It's order out of chaos.
[00:43:05.094 --> 00:43:07.016]  Folks, just like Vietnam, the documents came out on that.
[00:43:07.216 --> 00:43:08.337]  We weren't meant to win that.
[00:43:08.357 --> 00:43:10.318]  It was designed to go on forever.
[00:43:11.659 --> 00:43:12.460]  All of this is.
[00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:16.963]  That's why dozens of generals have left the Pentagon.
[00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:21.207]  They've gone public, known conservatives, JAG officers, heads of the Navy, and said,
[00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:24.700]  This is designed to defeat us!
[00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:25.821]  This isn't going to work!
[00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:27.022]  Torture's wrong!
[00:43:27.642 --> 00:43:29.983]  Gonzales saying torture's okay is evil!
[00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:32.164]  It's evil!
[00:43:34.606 --> 00:43:36.226]  Did Jesus torture people?
[00:43:37.527 --> 00:43:39.348]  Did Jesus say torture people?
[00:43:40.629 --> 00:43:41.929]  You don't do it!
[00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.191]  And, well, they're Al-Qaeda!
[00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:46.552]  No, they're not!
[00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:53.000]  But if they weren't going to be Alciada and recruited into something like that, they will be now.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.441]  Which is exactly what the Pentagon document P-2-O-G says.
[00:43:57.862 --> 00:44:12.547]  A huge Pentagon group, six billion a year funding since 2002, UPIAP, just type it in, P-2-O-G, as in puppy two, the number two, P-2-O-G.
[00:44:15.268 --> 00:44:15.628]  Alright?
[00:44:17.728 --> 00:44:18.929]  Now this is the reality.
[00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:21.530]  This is the reality.
[00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:27.713]  They say we're going to go out and ravage and kill and kill families and it says it.
[00:44:27.993 --> 00:44:34.796]  This is what's declassified to get the Arabs to fight and to widen the war so we can invade everyone.
[00:44:35.736 --> 00:44:37.797]  While we're losing the war, we've got to have a draft.
[00:44:38.217 --> 00:44:40.798]  Oh, a terrorist attack has happened in America again.
[00:44:41.018 --> 00:44:42.699]  We've got to go into Iran and Syria.
[00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:44.040]  That'll finally end this.
[00:44:47.526 --> 00:44:48.246]  Just think about it.
[00:44:48.326 --> 00:44:49.267]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:44:49.327 --> 00:44:50.287]  I've been going on and on.
[00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:52.227]  Barton, Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:44:52.288 --> 00:44:52.728]  Go ahead.
[00:44:52.748 --> 00:44:53.828]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:44:54.068 --> 00:44:54.328]  Good.
[00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:56.769]  I'm down here in Louisiana.
[00:44:57.049 --> 00:44:58.169]  This is about FEMA.
[00:44:58.349 --> 00:45:06.152]  We had a tornado come through here in early December, pretty much wiping out this town of Owla, okay?
[00:45:06.472 --> 00:45:15.955]  1,500 people, over 200 homes damaged and destroyed, one fatality, and FEMA declined our response for financial aid yesterday.
[00:45:16.818 --> 00:45:17.579]  I find that horrible.
[00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:19.381]  These people are poor people.
[00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:20.622]  They don't have much down there.
[00:45:21.162 --> 00:45:27.888]  Well, you know that 93% of FEMA funding is secret and has nothing to do with disaster relief.
[00:45:27.949 --> 00:45:28.990]  It's the shadow government.
[00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.332]  And by the way, that's admitted now.
[00:45:31.372 --> 00:45:35.756]  Years ago I was a conspiracy theorist reading federal documents on air, but now that's admitted.
[00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:38.619]  Well, I'm wondering where the rest of the Americans are.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.561]  I'm letting this come out now so the American people can stand up and maybe help these people down here.
[00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:46.841]  They're telling them to go to the Salvation Army.
[00:45:47.481 --> 00:45:48.262]  It's devastating.
[00:45:48.282 --> 00:45:53.863]  My wife went through the area a week ago and said that the houses were still laying on the side of the road.
[00:45:53.963 --> 00:45:56.123]  Trees were stripped apart, blown down.
[00:45:56.163 --> 00:45:57.704]  It looked like a nuclear helicopter.
[00:45:57.804 --> 00:46:00.224]  And we can't get no financial aid from these folks.
[00:46:01.124 --> 00:46:03.805]  But yet we sent our money over to the Stonanis over here.
[00:46:04.827 --> 00:46:12.178]  We're going to rebuild all these resorts for these wealthy people to go vacation in, when this is a poor little town here in Louisiana where people don't have anything.
[00:46:14.141 --> 00:46:21.051]  Well I'll tell you this, we pay our taxes supposedly so we'll get these services, but the services are all nothing but new taxing mechanisms.
[00:46:21.832 --> 00:46:23.454]  And they call the IRS a service.
[00:46:23.495 --> 00:46:26.679]  They call the new toll roads going in nationwide the new service.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.201]  It's all service.
[00:46:28.221 --> 00:46:29.183]  They're going to service you.
[00:46:29.423 --> 00:46:30.104]  Give you something.
[00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:35.912]  I guess the French cutting people's heads off during the French Revolution, it was a service.
[00:46:35.972 --> 00:46:37.635]  Or falling off a cliff is a service.
[00:46:38.486 --> 00:46:40.908]  But look, they're getting ready to take the pension funds.
[00:46:40.948 --> 00:46:44.632]  They've changed the rules so you don't own your pension funds, your private pension funds.
[00:46:44.652 --> 00:46:46.053]  They're raiding Social Security.
[00:46:46.613 --> 00:46:48.075]  It's mass looting, sir.
[00:46:48.515 --> 00:46:55.922]  And the new CIA report came out this weekend saying, yes, America will go to second world and third world status for the next 25 years.
[00:46:57.203 --> 00:46:58.844]  We are being de-industrialized.
[00:46:58.884 --> 00:46:59.925]  We are being shut down.
[00:47:00.586 --> 00:47:03.108]  This is an internal CIA report that got leaked.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.041]  Now it's in the mainstream news.
[00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:06.441]  They don't give it a lot of attention.
[00:47:06.921 --> 00:47:08.362]  But there are some good analysts there.
[00:47:09.382 --> 00:47:10.443]  Look, America's cooked.
[00:47:10.963 --> 00:47:16.205]  But we won't even know we're cooked while it's happening, because they'll still tell us we're number one while they're taking everything we've got.
[00:47:16.545 --> 00:47:19.807]  That's what the tyranny's about, so they can have their way with us.
[00:47:20.447 --> 00:47:22.448]  Well, you know, this forced medication, too.
[00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:23.648]  I live here in Louisiana.
[00:47:23.668 --> 00:47:27.610]  My daughter lives in Illinois, and she was diagnosed with bipolar last year.
[00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.852]  And I took two months and went up there and stayed with her, and she was in the hospital and so on and so forth.
[00:47:33.314 --> 00:47:42.411]  The hospital had sent her paper for me to fill out and they wanted to have testing done on myself while I was there.
[00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:50.270]  And I had been there a couple months and then... So let me ask you, your daughter was depressed, went on drugs, and then got even more depressed?
[00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:52.533]  Oh yes, and I'm working with... See, it's always the same.
[00:47:52.893 --> 00:48:03.284]  Somebody's a little depressed, they go get on the medication, then they get completely depressed, because their own studies show it actually makes you worse, then they put you on two, three, four medications, then you start having seizures, and you go on Depakote,
[00:48:04.429 --> 00:48:07.631]  She was on Devil Crow, and I spent many years... I see, I know it all.
[00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:09.652]  I'm sorry I have to say that.
[00:48:09.672 --> 00:48:11.933]  But on this subject, I know what they do.
[00:48:12.073 --> 00:48:13.293]  I know their pattern.
[00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:18.996]  I don't know a lot, but when it comes to how they operate, I frankly know just that it's not very arrogant, but it's sick.
[00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:21.037]  It's sick to know how criminal they are.
[00:48:21.657 --> 00:48:25.338]  When it comes to this drugging stuff, I really know their whole program.
[00:48:25.718 --> 00:48:35.660]  And so what they do is you have a car wreck, you've got breast cancer, you break a leg, and the insurance company goes, we don't really want to fix that, we just want to put you on drugs.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.441]  Then you flip out, then they hospitalize you.
[00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:39.741]  Exactly.
[00:48:39.921 --> 00:48:46.043]  So for those that just tuned in, tell me the chain of events with your daughter, how this played out.
[00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:51.204]  Well, she had called me several times and I could tell that something was wrong.
[00:48:51.244 --> 00:48:53.626]  Either drugs or a combination of drugs or illness.
[00:48:53.686 --> 00:48:55.427]  And the mother up there didn't know what to do.
[00:48:55.487 --> 00:48:58.029]  So, I explained to her... Let me talk to her.
[00:48:58.089 --> 00:48:58.969]  How did this start?
[00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:01.011]  How did you first get on the drugs?
[00:49:02.112 --> 00:49:03.093]  How'd she get on the drugs?
[00:49:03.433 --> 00:49:06.175]  Well, they committed her to the hospital at the ICU.
[00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:08.017]  Before that, was she on drugs?
[00:49:08.337 --> 00:49:09.018]  No, sir.
[00:49:09.438 --> 00:49:10.559]  Then I was wrong, so you don't know it all.
[00:49:10.959 --> 00:49:12.240]  No, she was not on drugs.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.222]  Not that you know, though.
[00:49:14.262 --> 00:49:14.782]  Are you sure?
[00:49:14.802 --> 00:49:16.043]  She wasn't seeing a psychologist?
[00:49:16.343 --> 00:49:17.084]  No, no, she wasn't.
[00:49:17.304 --> 00:49:17.784]  Not at all.
[00:49:18.005 --> 00:49:23.429]  Well, you know, we didn't know whether it was drugs from the street that was causing this, or she was on drugs or alcohol.
[00:49:23.929 --> 00:49:26.130]  Well, what was she doing that needed her to be committed?
[00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:36.913]  Well, she was out in the street and she was, uh, the neighbors and she was putting stuff in the swimming pool like tomatoes and other stuff.
[00:49:36.953 --> 00:49:41.474]  She was growing outside and she was acting bizarre and having bizarre mood swings.
[00:49:42.518 --> 00:49:43.759]  And, uh, so on and so forth.
[00:49:43.779 --> 00:49:45.381]  I mean, really bizarre situation.
[00:49:45.501 --> 00:49:56.111]  And we didn't know whether she was on drugs from the streets, so I told my wife before the police got her, because they didn't know what was wrong with her, and beat her down or took her to the jail to take her to the hospital and never checked out.
[00:49:56.211 --> 00:50:02.237]  Well, there's a program up in Illinois at the University of Illinois that, uh... But let me stop you.
[00:50:02.498 --> 00:50:03.919]  Why did they put her on Depakote?
[00:50:04.776 --> 00:50:06.279]  Uh, why did they put her on Depakote?
[00:50:06.899 --> 00:50:07.881]  Uh... Was I right about that?
[00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:10.265]  Like, after they put her on some drugs, then they put her on the Depakote?
[00:50:10.285 --> 00:50:10.665]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:10.845 --> 00:50:11.186]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:14.371]  There were several different drugs, and Depakote was the one I remember for sure.
[00:50:15.129 --> 00:50:18.951]  And I ran up on Depakote because, like I said, I stayed there two months with her.
[00:50:19.591 --> 00:50:24.514]  And some of the side effects of Depakote were... So that came after they put her on the first ones, though?
[00:50:24.774 --> 00:50:26.275]  Right, right.
[00:50:26.735 --> 00:50:28.396]  This is part of the zombification.
[00:50:28.916 --> 00:50:33.618]  They put you on these others and then you totally break down even worse than they put you on the Depakote.
[00:50:33.778 --> 00:50:35.339]  Right, and there's been several.
[00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:39.521]  I mean, this has been about a year and a half or two years now that she's been... There's been several.
[00:50:39.841 --> 00:50:43.925]  You need to get your daughter out of there, bring her down to Louisiana, and get her in a good church.
[00:50:44.366 --> 00:50:44.927]  Exactly.
[00:50:45.247 --> 00:50:46.248]  I'm working with her now.
[00:50:46.528 --> 00:50:51.093]  You know, I've had... Look, if you don't get your daughter out of there, they're going to fry her brain.
[00:50:51.453 --> 00:50:54.557]  And then they're going to work on her little child, is what I'm trying to tell her.
[00:50:54.957 --> 00:50:57.059]  Did your daughter, was she kind of into the counterculture?
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.681]  What's that mean, Alex?
[00:50:58.721 --> 00:50:59.302]  How'd she dress?
[00:51:00.308 --> 00:51:01.769]  Ah, she's dressed conservative.
[00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:02.870]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.153]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.293 --> 00:51:10.196]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.256 --> 00:51:14.480]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.603]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:20.545]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:22.046 --> 00:51:28.793]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.953 --> 00:51:32.016]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:35.039]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:41.646]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.166 --> 00:51:45.969]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:37.242]  You know how it's bad when Joseph Mingala of the Nazis or the North Koreans torture somebody or when the North Vietnamese torture somebody, but it's good when our government does.
[00:54:37.302 --> 00:54:37.943]  It's loving.
[00:54:38.852 --> 00:54:39.532]  It's helpful.

[00:54:43.494 --> 00:54:44.374]  I want to hear from you on this.
[00:54:44.394 --> 00:54:49.656]  Have you seen the mass promotion of it in the media, in fiction and non-fiction?
[00:54:49.696 --> 00:54:53.677]  Before we go back and let Burt finish up very quickly, I'm going to try to jam Steve Ross and others in here.

[00:56:14.944 --> 00:56:14.984]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.825]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk
[00:56:28.979 --> 00:56:30.540]  Finish up, Burt, about your daughter.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.342]  Yes, I'd like to give one example to the people about this medication.
[00:56:34.382 --> 00:56:42.147]  When I first got my daughter out of the psychiatric ward, we went out in the public, and I'm telling you, literally people would come across us and run.
[00:56:42.607 --> 00:56:47.710]  Because my daughter was so medicated that you could tell she wasn't right from a distance.
[00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.171]  And when we approached people,
[00:56:49.591 --> 00:56:51.453]  They would actually literally run from us.
[00:56:51.673 --> 00:56:52.653]  And that was heartbreaking.
[00:56:52.814 --> 00:56:54.915]  Because he looked like a zombie.
[00:56:54.955 --> 00:56:56.076]  Well, yeah.
[00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:57.897]  Well, be careful how she goes off the drugs.
[00:56:57.937 --> 00:57:01.600]  Do it under a doctor's care, a medical doctor's care, not these quacks.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:07.284]  Well, you know Alex, she got herself off the drugs and I talked to her today and she, I could communicate with her.
[00:57:07.304 --> 00:57:08.846]  She seems normal today.
[00:57:08.866 --> 00:57:09.586]  Good, good, good.
[00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:10.407]  Happy ending, Burt.
[00:57:10.447 --> 00:57:11.067]  Gotta let you go.
[00:57:11.087 --> 00:57:11.868]  Have a good day.
[00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:12.348]  Take care.
[00:57:12.648 --> 00:57:13.789]  Steve in Tennessee.
[00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:14.590]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:57:17.322 --> 00:57:18.122]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[00:57:18.282 --> 00:57:22.866]  Yeah, I wanted to let you know I was on Monopin.
[00:57:22.966 --> 00:57:24.948]  They put me on that for anti-anxiety.
[00:57:24.968 --> 00:57:29.132]  I had anxiety attacks and I was on the lowest dosage and that made me a zombie.
[00:57:30.291 --> 00:57:33.132]  Were you drinking a lot of caffeine before you had the anxiety attacks?
[00:57:33.952 --> 00:57:35.952]  Uh, I've always drank a lot of caffeine.
[00:57:35.972 --> 00:57:39.373]  Well, sir, I mean, see, they don't tell you the basic stuff that'll stop it.
[00:57:39.673 --> 00:57:45.915]  If you have anxiety attacks, the number one cause, this is medical information, is over-consumption of caffeine.
[00:57:46.295 --> 00:57:47.595]  Stop drinking caffeine.
[00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:48.915]  Well, that's what I did.
[00:57:48.955 --> 00:57:50.736]  Oh, you already knew that, okay.
[00:57:50.856 --> 00:57:51.776]  Yeah, that's what I did.
[00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:55.977]  My grandmother told me, she said, well, you could have too much caffeine, so you better stop.
[00:57:56.717 --> 00:57:59.558]  Cut your intake gradually, because then you can get off that stuff.
[00:58:00.342 --> 00:58:03.144]  So it was, oh my god, you know, come on.
[00:58:16.054 --> 00:58:18.856]  8 in the morning and I'm having a cup at like 10 o'clock at night.
[00:58:19.256 --> 00:58:22.699]  So I'm actually using speed right now to finish this new film.
[00:58:22.739 --> 00:58:23.499]  But go ahead.
[00:58:23.659 --> 00:58:25.741]  Well, I'll just talk about the Klonopin.
[00:58:25.761 --> 00:58:27.802]  The lowest dosage made me a zombie.
[00:58:28.543 --> 00:58:29.764]  It killed my creativity.
[00:58:29.824 --> 00:58:30.604]  It killed everything.
[00:58:30.644 --> 00:58:33.566]  And I said to the doctor, I said, take me off this.
[00:58:33.666 --> 00:58:34.627]  It's not doing me any good.
[00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:37.356]  And he says, okay, well, uh, there you go.
[00:58:37.476 --> 00:58:39.517]  I had a question for you, if, uh... Sure, stay there!
[00:58:39.537 --> 00:58:39.938]  Stay there!
[00:58:40.418 --> 00:58:44.681]  We're gonna come back, start the second hour, and I'm gonna just start ramming through your calls.
[00:58:45.102 --> 00:58:46.463]  Steve, Ross, Barney, Tim, and others.
[00:58:46.483 --> 00:58:47.003]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:51.847]  Hello!
[00:58:57.591 --> 00:58:58.232]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.892 --> 00:58:59.993]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.654 --> 00:59:01.814]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:03.256]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.996 --> 00:59:04.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.547 --> 00:59:09.490]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.974 --> 00:59:21.157]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, already into our number two.
[00:59:21.197 --> 00:59:22.798]  We've been talking about torture.
[00:59:22.838 --> 00:59:29.022]  Governor Ridge, our great leader of Homeland Freedom, is telling us torture is good.
[00:59:29.042 --> 00:59:33.005]  The monster who was just convicted
[00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:39.494]  of torture, Greiner, has come out and said, well, I was ordered to torture, which is admitted.
[00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:40.555]  The documents are public.
[00:59:42.056 --> 00:59:46.099]  So we're discussing not just that, but the propaganda surrounding how we're being sold torture.
[00:59:46.619 --> 01:00:03.352]  And while Alberto Gonzalez, to be our new Attorney General, says torture's good, and Ridge says torture's good, but then, oh, but we didn't order torture, even though the memos are public and the documents are public, and it was Operation Copper Green, the different training they were being given, and being ordered by the CIA to torture people, including small children, in front of their parents.
[01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:06.558]  Pretty sick stuff, so I want to get back into this.
[01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:07.859]  Plus, U.S.
[01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:09.441]  officers want more troops in Iraq.
[01:00:09.461 --> 01:00:11.103]  Selective service being set back up.
[01:00:12.364 --> 01:00:17.769]  And we're talking about the Great Coronation coming up here in a couple days, two days.
[01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.512]  Stanley Hilton's 9-1-1 suit dismissed.
[01:00:20.572 --> 01:00:21.353]  Appeal pending.
[01:00:22.154 --> 01:00:25.978]  Was Robert Kennedy killed by a real Manchurian candidate-style assassin?
[01:00:26.278 --> 01:00:27.940]  That's the London Independent!
[01:00:28.655 --> 01:00:29.896]  Another one out of the Boston Globe.
[01:00:29.956 --> 01:00:33.777]  Martin Luther King's family still convinced assassination was a conspiracy.
[01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:36.879]  Ex-KGB and Stasi chiefs to work under Chertoff.
[01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:37.839]  New news on that.
[01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:40.160]  Airbus unveils its super-jumbo.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.522]  European leaders hail the lead over the US.
[01:00:44.022 --> 01:00:46.383]  UK lawyer quits after terror law.
[01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:49.524]  Minnesota town hits 54 below zero.
[01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:50.605]  You think your town's cold?
[01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:54.137]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:00:54.577 --> 01:00:56.798]  Steve in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:00:57.018 --> 01:00:58.419]  Yeah, I just had a real quick question.
[01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:04.922]  I watched the trailer for your new Rise of the Police State, and I was... Talk about torture.
[01:01:04.942 --> 01:01:09.624]  That guy looked like you had asked him if he had ever been in a ritual, and he looked like he wanted to rip your head off.
[01:01:09.664 --> 01:01:10.204]  Who was that?
[01:01:10.224 --> 01:01:11.225]  Was he a security guy?
[01:01:11.245 --> 01:01:14.466]  That was the Chief White House Advisor to four U.S.
[01:01:14.526 --> 01:01:15.907]  Presidents, David Gergen.
[01:01:15.947 --> 01:01:17.268]  I just said, what about the ritual?
[01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.889]  And he didn't deny it, did he?
[01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.049]  No, he didn't.
[01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:21.990]  He... I was shocked.
[01:01:22.423 --> 01:01:23.164]  That's going to be great.
[01:01:23.204 --> 01:01:23.824]  Can't wait to get it.
[01:01:23.864 --> 01:01:24.505]  Thanks for your time.
[01:01:25.025 --> 01:01:25.826]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:01:25.846 --> 01:01:27.727]  I appreciate the call.
[01:01:27.747 --> 01:01:36.574]  Yeah, you can watch the trailer for Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:36.595 --> 01:01:37.495]  It's there on the main pages.
[01:01:38.416 --> 01:01:42.099]  Or just type Martial Law, Alex Jones video trailer into a search engine.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.662]  And yeah, I'm trying to put everything into this film.
[01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:50.084]  Because if the globalists kill me, I want to leave something behind.
[01:01:50.104 --> 01:01:54.588]  I want to try to empty the contents of my little brain into something.
[01:01:54.608 --> 01:01:58.210]  Because that's what matters.
[01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:01.132]  It's what we do, what we stand up for, and who we help.
[01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:05.636]  I've just got a feeling I need to make this a really good film.
[01:02:08.638 --> 01:02:09.478]  I'm trying hard.
[01:02:10.714 --> 01:02:11.114]  We'll see.
[01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.736]  All right, let's take another call here.
[01:02:13.756 --> 01:02:16.439]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ross in Ohio.
[01:02:16.539 --> 01:02:17.279]  Ross, welcome.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.262]  Oh yes, I have a two-part question.
[01:02:22.243 --> 01:02:27.307]  The first is there is an arsenal about eight miles from where I live, the Ravenna Arsenal.
[01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:37.215]  And I just noticed while I was driving by there a couple weeks ago, they're building two new railroads back in through there.
[01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.278]  And this seems very
[01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:44.117]  Well, how big is the facility?
[01:02:44.618 --> 01:02:44.798]  Huh?
[01:02:45.479 --> 01:02:48.082]  How big is the facility?
[01:02:48.142 --> 01:02:49.403]  175,000 acres.
[01:02:51.206 --> 01:03:00.377]  Well, they may be wanting to store equipment there, but they've got 18 wheelers to do that, and all over the country they admit FEMA camps have been built, and they take old bases and expand them.
[01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:04.006]  Uh, but uh, there's enough real live admitted prisons.
[01:03:04.026 --> 01:03:07.929]  I mean, we've gone from 1.3 mil in prison a few years ago to 7 mil now.
[01:03:07.969 --> 01:03:09.930]  They say there'll soon be 30 million of us in prison.
[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.692]  They're criminalizing everything, so.
[01:03:13.073 --> 01:03:15.294]  I look at all the real live camps that are in plain view.
[01:03:16.235 --> 01:03:16.435]  Yeah.
[01:03:17.055 --> 01:03:22.099]  But uh, I've also, I've uh, staked out like a place across the street from back in the woods.
[01:03:22.119 --> 01:03:23.140]  A little bit.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:29.084]  I have binoculars and I'll see like army, militarized vehicles drive in with like uh,
[01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:32.149]  Like, flatbeds with different parts of deck.
[01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:33.370]  Buildings and stuff.
[01:03:34.271 --> 01:03:35.472]  And, uh, boxes of stuff.
[01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.654]  Which I don't know what are in the boxes yet.
[01:03:38.135 --> 01:03:44.260]  Well, I'm sure you could probably do a search on the city website and find out, or... It's probably innocuous.
[01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:51.387]  I've asked, uh... I've gone up and asked them what... what was going on, and they... refused to give me any information whatsoever.
[01:03:51.567 --> 01:03:52.428]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:03:53.237 --> 01:03:57.583]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.743 --> 01:04:02.188]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.328 --> 01:04:06.714]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.734 --> 01:04:08.096]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.893 --> 01:04:14.116]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.176 --> 01:04:21.102]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:23.284]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.504 --> 01:04:33.993]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.233 --> 01:04:35.554]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:04:35.814 --> 01:04:36.154]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:36.274 --> 01:04:37.415]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.511]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.651 --> 01:04:58.694]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:01.776]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:08.581]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:11.763]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:11.963 --> 01:05:14.365]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.485 --> 01:05:22.391]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:22.671 --> 01:05:23.692]  We're good to go.
[01:05:53.169 --> 01:05:54.649]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:05:54.849 --> 01:06:02.191]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:02.511 --> 01:06:06.912]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:07.193 --> 01:06:17.015]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:06:17.775 --> 01:06:21.438]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:24.300]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:30.505]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:06:30.745 --> 01:06:32.306]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:06:32.566 --> 01:06:33.447]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:06:33.527 --> 01:06:36.508]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:06:36.688 --> 01:06:37.589]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.829]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.951]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:41.931]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:54.361 --> 01:07:00.384]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:04.026]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.367 --> 01:07:12.830]  Alright, in the last hour, I went over Governor Ridge saying, hey, torture is a good thing, if it keeps us safe.
[01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:21.935]  At the same time while they're doing this, all these different army soldiers and officers that are being convicted of torture, or of abuse,
[01:07:23.123 --> 01:07:26.085]  And they try to spin it psychologically into a lesser thing.
[01:07:26.805 --> 01:07:30.008]  Raping people and killing them is not abuse.
[01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:31.108]  It's torture.
[01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:36.452]  It's sadistic, serial killer, American psycho-type activity.
[01:07:36.472 --> 01:07:41.135]  And they're trying to, again, sell us that, well, let's just stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:41.655 --> 01:07:42.456]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[01:07:42.496 --> 01:07:47.599]  But at the same time, we have our leaders, Alberto Gonzales and Ridge and the rest of them, saying it's a good thing.
[01:07:47.799 --> 01:07:48.660]  It shouldn't be illegal.
[01:07:50.091 --> 01:07:54.312]  And then we have the government's own documents where they ordered these troops to torture these people.
[01:07:55.993 --> 01:08:00.134]  Now, the Brigadier General of Camp X-Ray two years ago, Rick Baucus, quit!
[01:08:00.454 --> 01:08:01.815]  And said, I've been ordered to torture people?
[01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:02.535]  I'm not doing it!
[01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.516]  And so that never made the national news.
[01:08:05.576 --> 01:08:06.816]  I mean, it was on the news wires.
[01:08:06.936 --> 01:08:10.638]  Reuters, AP, and one Rhode Island TV station picked it up.
[01:08:11.658 --> 01:08:13.198]  The General wouldn't come on for an interview.
[01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:14.239]  He was told to shut up.
[01:08:14.379 --> 01:08:14.999]  I was told that.
[01:08:16.548 --> 01:08:18.209]  But Rick Baucus refused to go along.
[01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:27.814]  They can't even have a trial at Camp X-Ray because they've had like, what, five prosecutors and defense lawyers quit saying, these aren't real trials.
[01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:33.017]  So they can't even have a kangaroo court because good people are in our military and are going no way.
[01:08:33.497 --> 01:08:43.623]  Now these sicko federal jail guards that they hired and put into the military and commissioned as officers and sent over there, oh yeah, they've been having lots of practice on fresh meat.
[01:08:44.221 --> 01:08:46.343]  And this is how the psychology of torture starts.
[01:08:46.763 --> 01:08:50.706]  Well, these are criminals in our prison, so why shouldn't we just torture them?
[01:08:50.986 --> 01:08:52.988]  Or hang them in their jail cells?
[01:08:53.268 --> 01:08:56.131]  Or do biological and chemical testing on them?
[01:08:56.951 --> 01:08:57.692]  Type in, um...
[01:08:58.616 --> 01:09:02.739]  Secret government program testing in Huntsville, Texas.
[01:09:02.759 --> 01:09:03.959]  You'll get Houston Chronicle.
[01:09:03.999 --> 01:09:04.400]  You name it.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.121]  I've been covering this for six, seven years.
[01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:08.162]  The local town got sick from it.
[01:09:08.242 --> 01:09:09.483]  Jail guards got sick from it.
[01:09:09.743 --> 01:09:11.264]  And when you got sick, nobody helped you.
[01:09:11.504 --> 01:09:14.065]  Because you thought, well, these are criminals anyways.
[01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:17.747]  Why not kiss and bow weapons on them?
[01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:19.809]  You see how that works?
[01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:21.309]  I mean, that's been going on in our prisons.
[01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:24.711]  So now we're all, oh my gosh, they're torturing Iraqis.
[01:09:24.752 --> 01:09:25.412]  And it is bad.
[01:09:26.112 --> 01:09:29.094]  But then the sickos out there go, well, they're not human!
[01:09:29.315 --> 01:09:30.956]  Well, they're sub-human!
[01:09:31.577 --> 01:09:33.338]  Well, that's the same thing that goes on in our prisons.
[01:09:33.558 --> 01:09:41.925]  Well, there are a bunch of murderers in prison, getting fat, lifting weights, and watching cable TV, and they got hot tubs!
[01:09:42.686 --> 01:09:43.927]  Make them work harder!
[01:09:45.388 --> 01:09:50.212]  Uh, maybe Club Fed, where Martha Stewart is, uh, is nice.
[01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:56.456]  But they don't have jacuzzis or cable TV, unless you're a special federal case.
[01:09:57.116 --> 01:09:57.536]  No, no, no.
[01:09:57.576 --> 01:10:08.120]  The prisons are asbestos-filled, they're the older prisons, with tuberculosis in the walls, chemical, biological testing going on in many of them.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.741]  You work for 18 to 25 cents an hour.
[01:10:11.201 --> 01:10:14.342]  If you want the most basic foods that are edible and not rotten baloney,
[01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:17.746]  And you go work, and people go, good, make them work!
[01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:18.046]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.487 --> 01:10:23.331]  Can you compete against 7 million people, 5 million of which work in the prison industries?
[01:10:23.651 --> 01:10:28.915]  Can you compete against a 5 million person workforce that gets, on average, 20 cents an hour?
[01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:31.057]  Oh, you never thought of that, did you?
[01:10:31.097 --> 01:10:36.802]  See, you've got to think of things in the multifaceted, multivariate, how they're interconnected, how they operate.
[01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:38.944]  That's what you've got to do.
[01:10:39.784 --> 01:10:41.686]  I mean, we ought to be scared to death of a government.
[01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:46.349]  That is openly promoting torture and every form of larcenous evil.
[01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:53.754]  And by afraid of it, I mean we should be concerned about it, and when I'm afraid, I fight.
[01:10:54.014 --> 01:10:55.295]  I don't engage in flight.
[01:10:57.956 --> 01:11:01.838]  And I certainly choose my battles, but I engage in the info war, and I want to be clear on this.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:07.622]  A lot of patriots, a lot of whistleblowers have been killed.
[01:11:08.979 --> 01:11:14.965]  And they've killed a lot of patriots in the last few years, and I have gotten occasional, and they've started up again, death threats.
[01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:18.748]  And I just want to say on record, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:19.689]  Ever.
[01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:22.151]  Never entered my mind.
[01:11:22.472 --> 01:11:23.132]  I love life.
[01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.494]  I just love the beauty of life.
[01:11:25.555 --> 01:11:26.535]  I love the stars.
[01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:27.456]  I love the trees.
[01:11:27.556 --> 01:11:27.937]  I love
[01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.871]  My family, I just love decency.
[01:11:30.891 --> 01:11:34.673]  I love and I appreciate basic things like a good meal.
[01:11:35.613 --> 01:11:37.574]  Life to me is an incredible adventure.
[01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:45.518]  Every moment is just filled with amazing thoughts and ideas and just all these memories.
[01:11:46.318 --> 01:11:53.021]  And it's sad to know that when I die, all of that, at least on this plane of existence, will be lost forever.
[01:11:54.062 --> 01:11:54.942]  There'll be no more
[01:11:55.743 --> 01:11:58.905]  Interfacing with humanity no more on this plane of existence.
[01:11:59.946 --> 01:12:06.870]  And I'm very frustrated that I don't have the skills to articulate my world view and the things that I understand and see.
[01:12:09.932 --> 01:12:15.075]  And I don't think... I mean, I know I'll be alive as long as God wants me to be alive.
[01:12:15.535 --> 01:12:22.620]  I've talked to a lot of soldiers who've been in combat and they'll tell you that it's like Colonel Craig Roberts says, his old
[01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:28.652]  Or was it Baptist Grandpa when he was going to Vietnam as a sniper?
[01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:37.317]  He said, son, you don't worry because there's a lot of them Vietnamese boys that are only wanting to kill you and a lot of people dying around you.
[01:12:37.557 --> 01:12:38.357]  Paraphrasing this.
[01:12:39.718 --> 01:12:42.659]  But it's whatever God wants.
[01:12:42.679 --> 01:12:44.120]  If you're going to die, you're going to die.
[01:12:45.086 --> 01:12:46.847]  And, uh, you know, that's just the way it is.
[01:12:47.087 --> 01:12:48.228]  And really that is the way it is.
[01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:56.734]  If we love life so much that we always go to the path of weakness, the path of compromise, the path of stagnation.
[01:12:57.594 --> 01:13:04.299]  If we love life so much that we tower in fear to bullies and despots and thugs and their secret police.
[01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:16.410]  If we love life so much that we're even afraid of what our neighbors think, and then subconsciously, psychologically, because this is most of the cowardice, twist our minds and make excuses for it, and deny it's going on.
[01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:18.051]  Most people just deny it's even going on.
[01:13:18.491 --> 01:13:19.591]  But deep down you know it's true.
[01:13:19.631 --> 01:13:22.212]  That's why you've got that sick feeling right now listening to this.
[01:13:24.232 --> 01:13:32.835]  And so, people want to hold on or are so self-centered, so greedy, that
[01:13:33.673 --> 01:13:35.593]  That they are bringing death!
[01:13:36.113 --> 01:13:43.495]  And when all of you act like cattle, and all of you act like sheep, and all of you act like gazelles on the African plain, the lions come!
[01:13:44.455 --> 01:13:45.335]  And they devour!
[01:13:45.395 --> 01:13:47.235]  The wolves come, and they devour!
[01:13:48.696 --> 01:13:51.216]  Well, I'm not a sheep, and I'm not a wolf!
[01:13:52.756 --> 01:13:53.597]  I'm a sheepdog!
[01:13:55.357 --> 01:13:59.938]  And I don't like wolves, and I sardonically am angry at the sheep.
[01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.418]  I wish they'd become sheepdogs.
[01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:06.584]  And you know what, if a pack of wolves corner me one day and rip my guts out.
[01:14:08.024 --> 01:14:10.525]  You know, if they line me up and say, you knew you had this coming.
[01:14:11.425 --> 01:14:13.386]  If they strap me down and torture me.
[01:14:14.887 --> 01:14:16.888]  It doesn't matter, because let me tell you something.
[01:14:17.788 --> 01:14:18.568]  Let me tell you something.
[01:14:20.269 --> 01:14:24.451]  You look at your children and you know the world you're giving them and what you're putting them into.
[01:14:25.851 --> 01:14:27.912]  And if you won't do everything possible
[01:14:29.033 --> 01:14:40.340]  And if there is even fear in you, and you even have to think about doing something to stop this new world order, something is wrong with you fundamentally.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.682]  The globalists put cancer viruses and vaccines on purpose.
[01:14:44.842 --> 01:14:45.963]  They've been caught a thousand times.
[01:14:46.944 --> 01:14:48.204]  They created the AIDS virus.
[01:14:48.444 --> 01:14:50.566]  Nobel laureates, it's public, it's admitted.
[01:14:50.746 --> 01:14:55.068]  The patents, the army funding, the naval funding for it, it's all admitted.
[01:14:55.088 --> 01:14:55.969]  Congressional testimony.
[01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:57.770]  These people,
[01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:00.605]  took G.I.'
[01:15:00.585 --> 01:15:06.949]  's wives and gave them uranium pills when they were pregnant to kill their babies and to track what it would do to them.
[01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:15.753]  And if you can't stand up against this pack of psychopaths who take our troops and stand them out in the field and fly over and nerve gas them just to see what it'd do to our own troops.
[01:15:16.474 --> 01:15:20.176]  If you can't stand up against these people, do you know how bad things are gonna get?
[01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:31.392]  If you buy their lies and listen to their propaganda and feel good and take the easy path and make excuses to yourself, do you know the hell you're delivering this country into?
[01:15:32.814 --> 01:15:39.341]  This nation has been captured by high-tech, genius criminals.
[01:15:40.436 --> 01:16:00.306]  Societies, organized crime societies that took over the western world hundreds of years ago but couldn't manifest their full designs because the public wasn't wicked enough, the general population wasn't psychotic enough, so they made a conscious decision through the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others.
[01:16:00.506 --> 01:16:06.349]  They wrote the reports to destroy our moral fabric, to twist us so we would be tools of empire.
[01:16:06.549 --> 01:16:08.230]  And they've now captured this country
[01:16:08.988 --> 01:16:16.029]  And they are using it as an engine, as a power system, as a battering ram.
[01:16:16.069 --> 01:16:18.290]  They are forging us into a tool.
[01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.350]  That's what tyranny is about.
[01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.891]  And your pension funds and your health and your safety don't matter.
[01:16:24.271 --> 01:16:33.352]  It's all the goal to dumb you down, to turn you into mindless idiots, to project you outwards as their military arm to take over the world.
[01:16:34.193 --> 01:16:35.893]  I've watched the Pentagon on C-SPAN.
[01:16:35.933 --> 01:16:36.333]  Admit it!
[01:16:37.156 --> 01:16:39.537]  Call it world government, say that's what it's about!
[01:16:41.057 --> 01:17:03.605]  And the people serving this, the people going along with this, are doing it deep down, 90% of them, at the higher levels, because deep down they're afraid of this, they got into it for power and control, as they got higher up in it, they found out just how evil it is, just how serious it is, and most of them, out of fear, energetically execute the
[01:17:04.597 --> 01:17:09.881]  Building plans, the blueprints of this monstrosity that is nearing completion.
[01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:12.143]  It is a wrecking ball.
[01:17:12.704 --> 01:17:14.185]  I can see the phases of it.
[01:17:14.585 --> 01:17:16.387]  It's laid out like a blueprint in front of me.
[01:17:18.087 --> 01:17:29.017]  Once they've taken over the third world, once they've got the world ID cards in, once they've got the whole planet with cameras on it, then they're going to start releasing the plagues, then they're going to start exterminating masses of people.
[01:17:29.237 --> 01:17:32.581]  Their official plan, 80 plus percent of us could be exterminated.
[01:17:32.801 --> 01:17:34.282]  And look, I know this sounds insane.
[01:17:34.502 --> 01:17:35.023]  It's true.
[01:17:36.804 --> 01:17:39.207]  Again, a lot of you have been listening for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years.
[01:17:39.227 --> 01:17:40.628]  You know, everything I've told you has come true.
[01:17:40.648 --> 01:17:43.431]  Folks, you don't want to be in the next phase of this in the next 20 years.
[01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:46.239]  You think, oh, 20 years away?
[01:17:46.259 --> 01:18:01.299]  I mean, before that, to get us even more clamped down and straightjacketed by the New World Order, nukes going off, bios being released, all of it, as they get us into this, and we give up more freedom, as they promise to keep us safe, and then the next thing just gets bigger.
[01:18:02.674 --> 01:18:06.877]  And so many people in this system make the psychological excuse to deny what I'm saying.
[01:18:07.097 --> 01:18:08.679]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:18:09.159 --> 01:18:11.301]  You can set your watch and warrant on it.
[01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:12.542]  You can bank on it.
[01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:14.383]  You can guarantee it.
[01:18:14.843 --> 01:18:22.169]  This stuff is going to happen unless there is a mass revelation of understanding and resistance to it.
[01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:27.413]  And so facing this threat to the species
[01:18:28.568 --> 01:18:38.212]  I have the instinctive drive, if I have to throw myself into the gears of it, and be crushed by it, to stand in front of that tank like Tiananmen Square, so be it!
[01:18:40.713 --> 01:18:43.374]  There is not even a thought in my mind.
[01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:44.635]  I am committed.
[01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:46.275]  I am driven.
[01:18:47.436 --> 01:18:50.437]  I am possessed by the desire to defend life!
[01:18:54.517 --> 01:18:55.958]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:58.479]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:18:58.859 --> 01:18:59.720]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.300]  Oil War III has started.
[01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:04.062]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:19:04.482 --> 01:19:07.864]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:08.304 --> 01:19:09.124]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:19:09.164 --> 01:19:12.126]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:19:12.386 --> 01:19:13.646]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:18.569]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:22.971]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:19:23.511 --> 01:19:29.393]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:35.754]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:19:36.274 --> 01:19:36.614]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:36.654 --> 01:19:42.516]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:19:42.956 --> 01:19:44.856]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:19:44.876 --> 01:19:45.216]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:53.644 --> 01:19:57.309]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:03.137]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:04.699]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:04.739 --> 01:20:08.765]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:22.698]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.238 --> 01:20:28.523]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:28.843 --> 01:20:34.729]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:36.811]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:36.951 --> 01:20:41.493]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:20:41.934 --> 01:20:43.094]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.596 --> 01:20:48.097]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:20:48.117 --> 01:20:49.157]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.961]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.721 --> 01:21:02.344]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:02.385 --> 01:21:03.105]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:03.883 --> 01:21:08.185]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:21:08.225 --> 01:21:11.827]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:12.828 --> 01:21:18.111]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:46.962]  They railed against the crown.
[01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:14.390]  They railed against the crown Another red-tag band Declaring independence They laid their bodies down
[01:23:18.443 --> 01:23:25.646]  And the lives they leave far ahead of the time.
[01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:30.128]  All right, folks.
[01:23:48.715 --> 01:23:49.715]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:50.975 --> 01:23:53.836]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[01:23:54.436 --> 01:23:57.297]  When it comes to heroes, the renegades are mine.
[01:23:59.257 --> 01:24:02.937]  Folks, powerful, strong men have always wanted to dominate.
[01:24:04.278 --> 01:24:10.279]  And if our ancestors, regardless of what color we are, didn't stand up, we wouldn't even have the freedoms we have now.
[01:24:10.839 --> 01:24:15.900]  Tyranny will go to the limit until it is met with force.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.300]  Bullies will.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.101]  We're talking about a lot more than bullies.
[01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:25.123]  Globalists couldn't live with themselves if they had a conscience, but it's more than that.
[01:24:25.343 --> 01:24:27.624]  They're not just sociopaths.
[01:24:27.664 --> 01:24:28.385]  They're sadists.
[01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:30.726]  They enjoy their work.
[01:24:31.547 --> 01:24:35.549]  They enjoy tearing the human spirit to pieces.
[01:24:35.589 --> 01:24:38.991]  They love to devour, because their father is the devil.
[01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:42.953]  And they're either possessed by the world and by its owner,
[01:24:43.795 --> 01:24:45.296]  Or you are possessed by God.
[01:24:45.336 --> 01:24:48.178]  You're filled by God's vision and what God wants.
[01:24:48.398 --> 01:24:51.780]  And you're either living for the devil, or you're living for God.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:52.920]  It's simple!
[01:24:54.301 --> 01:25:00.024]  And I'm sick of hearing you get on the radio, you sick filth, and talk about how the torture's good.
[01:25:01.045 --> 01:25:04.066]  You ought to be made to go over there to Iraq, and you should be made.
[01:25:04.086 --> 01:25:08.549]  You know, when you go to hell, you're probably going to have to watch them torture those Iraqi children forever.
[01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:16.461]  You're going to have to sit there as it's replayed to you in hell if there's any justice forever as they torture those children to death!
[01:25:16.522 --> 01:25:17.302]  You filth!
[01:25:18.963 --> 01:25:21.284]  You demon-possessed trash!
[01:25:23.245 --> 01:25:25.866]  I've been in preacher mode lately, folks.
[01:25:26.927 --> 01:25:30.089]  I've actually been working, trying to finish this film like 18-19 hours a day.
[01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:31.910]  I actually have more energy.
[01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:32.690]  It's weird.
[01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:34.231]  I'm sure I'll be exhausted afterwards.
[01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:35.732]  I've kind of hit a second wind here.
[01:25:37.152 --> 01:25:38.113]  And I talked about how I'm
[01:25:38.817 --> 01:25:39.537]  Drinking coffee.
[01:25:39.557 --> 01:25:40.058]  Not a lot of it.
[01:25:40.078 --> 01:25:41.598]  Maybe one cup in the morning and one cup at night.
[01:25:42.319 --> 01:25:43.499]  But I was being honest about it.
[01:25:43.559 --> 01:25:45.460]  I guess that is a speed.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.581]  I need to get off coffee.
[01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:47.361]  It's bad.
[01:25:48.322 --> 01:25:51.944]  But I just, you know, folks, we've got to wake up.
[01:25:51.964 --> 01:25:52.944]  We've got to fight this thing.
[01:25:53.645 --> 01:25:55.345]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:25:56.606 --> 01:25:57.707]  Barney in Maryland.
[01:25:57.747 --> 01:25:58.507]  Go ahead, Barney.
[01:25:59.007 --> 01:25:59.648]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:25:59.908 --> 01:26:00.508]  Two things.
[01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:05.991]  First, the Iraqi war was an illegal war.
[01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:09.667]  And, uh, it was based on lies.
[01:26:10.668 --> 01:26:19.533]  And on the torture issue, everybody that was involved up the chain of command could be turned over to the Iraqis for punishment.
[01:26:20.413 --> 01:26:28.138]  Everybody that should have known about it on the chain of command and didn't should be replaced.
[01:26:29.098 --> 01:26:32.580]  And on the second... Well, look, it's admitted that the White House ordered all of this.
[01:26:33.061 --> 01:26:33.761]  It's admitted.
[01:26:33.781 --> 01:26:37.163]  I mean, it's public, but the media just keeps ignoring that.
[01:26:37.996 --> 01:26:38.556]  It's sick.
[01:26:38.576 --> 01:26:41.778]  What do you think about these people that call the Iraqis subhuman?
[01:26:42.798 --> 01:26:44.819]  Well, they're just out of this world.
[01:26:44.859 --> 01:26:46.500]  They've got problems.
[01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:57.926]  But on the second issue, I would like to know what department or agencies are responsible for collecting the camera
[01:26:58.644 --> 01:27:00.465]  Another surveillance equipment on us.
[01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:01.906]  Here's how it works.
[01:27:02.106 --> 01:27:09.510]  The feds pay about 70% on average and then we have to supplement locally to put the traffic cameras in the last 10 years.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:18.864]  Then they built, in the last six years, emergency command centers, even like you'll have four or five rural counties, even if it's rural, they'll have a FEMA command base.
[01:27:19.164 --> 01:27:35.311]  The cameras nexus through there, then are fiber-optic cabled or satellited into the federal government, into the NSA, into the National Traffic Safety groups, into the National Transportation Organizations, and so they all have
[01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:36.611]  Yep.
[01:28:03.897 --> 01:28:06.098]  Okay, well, buddy, you better pace yourself.
[01:28:06.118 --> 01:28:07.679]  We've got a long fight ahead of us.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.181]  I know we do, Barney.
[01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:17.845]  I just, uh... I've been in this for forty-five years, and you just have to take it as it comes.
[01:28:18.506 --> 01:28:19.386]  Ride the punches.
[01:28:20.007 --> 01:28:22.028]  When did you wake up to the New World Order, Barney?
[01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:22.588]  About 1960.
[01:28:22.728 --> 01:28:26.130]  I've been fighting it ever since.
[01:28:26.171 --> 01:28:33.015]  We had good leaders, we had good workers, but we didn't have the means of communication we have today, and, uh...
[01:28:35.164 --> 01:28:38.666]  People weren't hurting, so it took all this time to get things going.
[01:28:39.006 --> 01:28:39.766]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.768 --> 01:28:44.688]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:46.769]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:50.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.419 --> 01:28:59.661]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:05.964]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:29:06.244 --> 01:29:14.627]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:29:14.927 --> 01:29:17.469]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter.
[01:29:17.589 --> 01:29:21.972]  And during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:29:22.253 --> 01:29:27.096]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:32.700]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:29:33.041 --> 01:29:36.083]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or nightlight.
[01:29:36.443 --> 01:29:44.409]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-44438.
[01:29:44.449 --> 01:29:45.150]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:49.353]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use, in business and socially.
[01:29:59.838 --> 01:30:06.221]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:30:06.821 --> 01:30:08.542]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:30:09.262 --> 01:30:15.225]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:30:15.865 --> 01:30:17.426]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:30:17.966 --> 01:30:20.127]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:22.728]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:30:23.308 --> 01:30:24.389]  And it's so easy.
[01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:27.070]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:30:27.944 --> 01:30:28.604]  When you want.
[01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:29.765]  Where you want.
[01:30:30.565 --> 01:30:35.587]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[01:30:36.408 --> 01:30:39.229]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[01:30:39.249 --> 01:30:40.029]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:30:40.049 --> 01:30:40.510]  That's 419-WORD.
[01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:40.670]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:30:53.174 --> 01:30:59.420]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:00.160]  I use it.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.482]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[01:31:02.562 --> 01:31:08.748]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie, and it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[01:31:09.128 --> 01:31:20.173]  And what it is, it's a wedge device, just a small one, that you put underneath your sacrum, and then you get down on it, you put your weight down on it, on the floor, and you let gravity do the work.
[01:31:20.593 --> 01:31:25.775]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away, chiropractors go away, you don't need them anymore.
[01:31:26.115 --> 01:31:27.216]  You gotta give it a try.
[01:31:27.576 --> 01:31:29.737]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.059]  SACROWEDGY.COM
[01:31:56.551 --> 01:31:57.071]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.531 --> 01:31:59.072]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.572 --> 01:32:02.312]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.332 --> 01:32:07.953]  Yeah, it sounds horrible, the stuff we're talking about, but don't worry.
[01:32:08.033 --> 01:32:09.734]  Evil always implodes on itself.
[01:32:10.854 --> 01:32:13.034]  You had ten globalists left in a room.
[01:32:13.734 --> 01:32:16.475]  The only people on Earth, they would all start turning on each other.
[01:32:17.675 --> 01:32:18.375]  That's their nature.
[01:32:18.395 --> 01:32:19.656]  That's what they do.
[01:32:19.736 --> 01:32:21.276]  They're predators.
[01:32:21.356 --> 01:32:22.236]  They're more than predators.
[01:32:22.516 --> 01:32:25.837]  They're destructive, hateful creatures.
[01:32:28.294 --> 01:32:32.719]  We're taking your calls, talking about torture, and just decadence, period.
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:38.165]  How we're being sold evil, wholesale, pell-mell, here in America.
[01:32:39.166 --> 01:32:49.118]  And being forged into a dark, battering ram, to take over every free nation, every sovereign nation, every rogue nation, regardless of who runs them, good, bad, the ugly.
[01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:52.871]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:53.552]  Tim, welcome.
[01:32:53.892 --> 01:32:54.212]  Related.
[01:32:54.272 --> 01:32:55.232]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[01:32:55.453 --> 01:32:55.813]  Yes, sir.
[01:32:55.833 --> 01:32:56.113]  Welcome.
[01:32:56.393 --> 01:32:59.715]  Just like you, I'm surrounded by fascists and fools.
[01:32:59.755 --> 01:33:05.218]  I've given them the name step birds when you put so much information in front of people.
[01:33:05.298 --> 01:33:06.958]  And like you say, they still want to deny it.
[01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.780]  They know deep down, but they don't want to admit.
[01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:11.248]  I don't even mean that.
[01:33:26.508 --> 01:33:31.690]  The time, the energy to effectively, truly articulate what we're facing.
[01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:37.091]  I don't think people realize how truly anti-Christ is the only way to describe it.
[01:33:37.592 --> 01:33:39.292]  This global system is.
[01:33:39.332 --> 01:33:46.294]  And then even the so-called Christians, their churches have been compromised and they're there fooling them, not giving them the big picture.
[01:33:46.614 --> 01:33:49.395]  They are telling them that evil leaders are of God.
[01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:51.676]  It's sick!
[01:33:52.056 --> 01:33:54.777]  That's where my definition of Stepford steps in.
[01:33:55.656 --> 01:34:00.020]  Speaking of that, over the Christmas holidays, there was an interview with Ann Coulter.
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:00.740]  Did you catch that?
[01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:03.523]  In the quote where she said, I think it would be fun to nuke North Korea?
[01:34:03.543 --> 01:34:04.703]  Yeah, I think it would be fun to nuke people.
[01:34:04.763 --> 01:34:07.706]  I think we need to kill more civilians in Iraq.
[01:34:08.106 --> 01:34:08.687]  Unbelievable.
[01:34:08.707 --> 01:34:10.268]  Yeah, that was a big New York paper.
[01:34:10.368 --> 01:34:11.469]  I actually read it on there.
[01:34:11.489 --> 01:34:12.229]  Which one was that?
[01:34:12.329 --> 01:34:12.710]  I forget.
[01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:13.951]  It was one of the New York publications.
[01:34:13.971 --> 01:34:14.931]  Yeah, I'll find out.
[01:34:14.991 --> 01:34:16.192]  I think it was New York Daily News.
[01:34:16.252 --> 01:34:17.413]  I'll call you back tomorrow.
[01:34:17.473 --> 01:34:19.175]  It's posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:19.195 --> 01:34:20.616]  Yeah, it's just crazy.
[01:34:20.936 --> 01:34:22.938]  I mean, folks, as she said, we need to kill more civilians.
[01:34:22.978 --> 01:34:23.618]  That's the answer.
[01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:26.340]  She goes, our troops just need to kill them.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.521]  Just kill more civilians.
[01:34:27.541 --> 01:34:28.061]  Just kill them.
[01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:31.524]  I mean, this idiot who probably doesn't even know how to load a firearm.
[01:34:31.884 --> 01:34:34.566]  I mean, it's just like Marie Antoinette, let them eat cake.
[01:34:34.766 --> 01:34:35.427]  Just kill them.
[01:34:35.627 --> 01:34:37.168]  Just kill more of the civilians.
[01:34:37.188 --> 01:34:38.529]  That's what keeps them.
[01:34:38.949 --> 01:34:40.130]  Just smash them.
[01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:42.672]  I mean, it's so decadent.
[01:34:43.268 --> 01:34:43.648]  It'd be so fun!
[01:34:43.668 --> 01:34:46.491]  She sounds like she's been hanging around with Albright too long.
[01:34:46.651 --> 01:34:49.954]  It'd be so fun to just start nuking!
[01:34:50.354 --> 01:34:52.076]  Question about the inauguration this week.
[01:34:53.497 --> 01:34:55.359]  Yes, just the inauguration.
[01:34:55.599 --> 01:34:56.439]  The oath.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.165]  Now, the Senator does not say, I promise to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:35:03.746 --> 01:35:05.567]  Yes, they violate the oath big time.
[01:35:06.909 --> 01:35:11.472]  You're right, the Patriot Act, the Homeland Security, that does nothing but eviscerate our Constitution.
[01:35:11.552 --> 01:35:12.733]  It reduces all civil liberties.
[01:35:12.813 --> 01:35:21.918]  And actually makes it easier in the new intelligence bill they just passed, the 9-11 overhaul, actually had amnesty in it to accept all the fake ID cards of foreigners.
[01:35:22.839 --> 01:35:35.787]  And they're all impeachable offenses, and once again, people look the other way, which then they get branded by me a stepper, because if you're that brainwashed that you can't take all of this information and see what is really going on,
[01:35:36.417 --> 01:35:37.517]  Then you're completely brainwashed.
[01:35:39.017 --> 01:35:41.698]  Well, again, it's comfortable and easy to just deny it.
[01:35:41.898 --> 01:35:42.798]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[01:35:42.818 --> 01:35:45.179]  But that's not how the real world works.
[01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:45.739]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:47.479 --> 01:35:50.320]  And again, let me try to boil this down just as simply as I can.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.360]  Here's an example.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.881]  Democrats talk about how Bush is evil.
[01:35:56.881 --> 01:35:58.081]  Oh, he's for the Patriot Act.
[01:35:58.181 --> 01:35:59.101]  Oh, he's for the National I.D.
[01:35:59.221 --> 01:35:59.441]  Card.
[01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:00.721]  Oh, he's for torture.
[01:36:01.942 --> 01:36:03.722]  Well, you're prominent Democratic leaders.
[01:36:04.628 --> 01:36:05.909]  They helped write up a lot of this.
[01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:07.410]  They helped write up the Patriot Act.
[01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:12.494]  They helped push that more Democrats are voting with Bush than Republicans.
[01:36:12.514 --> 01:36:13.115]  Did you know that?
[01:36:14.075 --> 01:36:16.177]  On all these key votes, I've read the votes on there.
[01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.279]  They're actually the ones.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.881]  It's a handful of good, real conservatives.
[01:36:23.403 --> 01:36:26.105]  Like Ron Paul and Coon and others.
[01:36:26.969 --> 01:36:27.769]  That are doing this.
[01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:29.150]  That are standing up.
[01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:31.251]  The Democrats helped write it.
[01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:34.012]  Bill Clinton helped set up the foundations for all this.
[01:36:34.232 --> 01:36:37.333]  Bill Clinton's out saying how great it is with George Bush and his daddy.
[01:36:39.074 --> 01:36:40.314]  And it's like conservatives.
[01:36:40.354 --> 01:36:41.275]  I heard one this morning.
[01:36:41.455 --> 01:36:46.797]  A neocon on radio going, let me tell you, these Democrats want to drug all our kids.
[01:36:46.877 --> 01:36:47.637]  It's just horrible.
[01:36:48.457 --> 01:36:50.878]  They want to drug all our kids with Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:36:51.319 --> 01:36:54.760]  It's George Bush about to make it law that you have to do it.
[01:36:56.286 --> 01:36:57.066]  Not about to make it law.
[01:36:57.086 --> 01:36:57.806]  They just passed it.
[01:36:57.866 --> 01:36:59.127]  Forced psychological testing.
[01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:01.707]  They said they're going to put half the kids on drugs.
[01:37:01.747 --> 01:37:03.648]  I mean, that's the British Medical Journal, the AP.
[01:37:03.668 --> 01:37:04.608]  You can go read the articles.
[01:37:04.668 --> 01:37:05.508]  It's the bill!
[01:37:06.569 --> 01:37:08.389]  I've had Ron Paul, Congressman, on about it.
[01:37:08.949 --> 01:37:10.009]  Other Congressmen on about it.
[01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:12.050]  Tom Tancredo on.
[01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:15.251]  I mean, it's real, folks!
[01:37:15.391 --> 01:37:17.831]  I could have called into that show and done a little George Bushes for it.
[01:37:18.092 --> 01:37:19.532]  Alright, you liar!
[01:37:20.132 --> 01:37:21.892]  Here he is, Tommy!
[01:37:23.113 --> 01:37:23.713]  Again, so...
[01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:26.392]  People are all being given a false choice.
[01:37:26.412 --> 01:37:27.532]  Oh, the Democrats will protect me.
[01:37:27.572 --> 01:37:28.712]  Oh, the Republicans will protect me.
[01:37:28.852 --> 01:37:35.414]  Wouldn't they all go on vacation together and give each other awards and sit on the same boards together and go to the Bohemian Grove together?
[01:37:35.434 --> 01:37:41.576]  And go select their male prostitute they wish to, you know, spend the night with?
[01:37:41.596 --> 01:37:43.797]  And even put it in the newspaper.
[01:37:43.837 --> 01:37:43.957]  Yeah!
[01:37:44.277 --> 01:37:45.937]  We're getting serviced by the porn stars.
[01:37:46.218 --> 01:37:46.938]  The gay porn stars.
[01:37:46.978 --> 01:37:47.238]  So what?
[01:37:47.258 --> 01:37:47.678]  We're Christian.
[01:37:48.413 --> 01:37:51.056]  And then the preachers get up on the radio and rebuke me.
[01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:54.039]  Alex Jones is an evil devil.
[01:37:54.099 --> 01:37:55.821]  He told lies about President Bush.
[01:37:56.141 --> 01:37:58.724]  Claims he goes to a place called Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:59.404 --> 01:37:59.725]  What?
[01:37:59.765 --> 01:38:00.566]  I mean, it's admitted!
[01:38:00.586 --> 01:38:05.531]  I mean, it's just... Or you go, what about Skull and Bones?
[01:38:05.591 --> 01:38:06.552]  Well, that was when he was...
[01:38:07.296 --> 01:38:09.897]  Young man, there's no big deal.
[01:38:10.077 --> 01:38:14.678]  Oh yeah, the order of death where you ask Satan to enter your body, Lucifer to enter your body.
[01:38:15.038 --> 01:38:16.138]  They believe Lucifer's God.
[01:38:16.478 --> 01:38:17.398]  And this is admitted!
[01:38:19.079 --> 01:38:20.959]  You wonder why stuff's getting so crazy?
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.740]  Alright, let's go to Len in Oklahoma.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.401]  Len, go ahead.
[01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:27.201]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:38:27.281 --> 01:38:28.481]  It's good to talk to you again.
[01:38:28.661 --> 01:38:29.341]  Good to talk to you.
[01:38:29.561 --> 01:38:30.522]  Just a quick comment.
[01:38:30.562 --> 01:38:36.103]  Tonight on Paula's Own on CNN, they're going to have a segment called, Citizen Spies.
[01:38:37.552 --> 01:38:38.293]  I kid you not.
[01:38:39.594 --> 01:38:41.215]  And of course, they'll say, is it good?
[01:38:41.535 --> 01:38:42.476]  Maybe it is good.
[01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:43.136]  Maybe it's not.
[01:38:43.156 --> 01:38:45.318]  Just kind of soft-soap it and sell it to us.
[01:38:45.578 --> 01:38:52.063]  Yeah, well, the promo they ran featured a stay-at-home mom who has her computer hooked up, I guess, to the internet.
[01:38:52.123 --> 01:39:00.469]  And they showed a screenshot of the video monitor, you know, and it was segmented with different video feeds.
[01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:04.492]  And she basically stays at home and buys.
[01:39:05.233 --> 01:39:05.993]  Let me stop you.
[01:39:06.093 --> 01:39:06.674]  Let me stop you.
[01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:10.992]  Did you not hear me over a year ago scream and yell about this?
[01:39:11.232 --> 01:39:11.932]  Absolutely.
[01:39:12.852 --> 01:39:16.953]  Now I knew about the federal program and the plan, but then it was in the New York Times.
[01:39:18.233 --> 01:39:25.774]  And by law, when we're all drafted upwards to age 49, or when they blow the economy out, then you'll get a supplemental check.
[01:39:26.135 --> 01:39:33.596]  You're going to get a government check on a national ID card, but you'll have to quote work upwards of 20 hours a week sitting at a computer
[01:39:34.506 --> 01:39:36.629]  Watching video feeds, but never from your city.
[01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:37.890]  It's always another city.
[01:39:38.771 --> 01:39:48.782]  And you watch the feed, now as a Big Brother spy, and the government says, in case you're not watching, they are going to insert false feeds.
[01:39:49.637 --> 01:39:58.182]  Computer-generated, showing a terrorist, go up to the power plant fence, showing someone spanking their child.
[01:39:58.202 --> 01:40:00.543]  This is actually in the news, because that's terrorism.
[01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:01.803]  I'm not kidding!
[01:40:01.964 --> 01:40:02.444]  I'm not kidding!
[01:40:02.544 --> 01:40:03.164]  I'm not kidding, folks!
[01:40:03.204 --> 01:40:03.985]  Listen to me carefully!
[01:40:04.545 --> 01:40:09.568]  They're going to superimpose video in test to make sure you're always watching.
[01:40:09.608 --> 01:40:11.669]  So this does about ten different things, but here's a few of them.
[01:40:12.129 --> 01:40:17.752]  Number one, it creates the psychological perception of those watching that
[01:40:18.743 --> 01:40:22.164]  They've done a big Pavlovian test on this at major psychology departments.
[01:40:22.184 --> 01:40:23.284]  We've even found documents on it.
[01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:31.987]  This creates the perception, like all the fake terror drills, that terrorism is a real widespread threat because you're watching the simulated terrorism.
[01:40:32.327 --> 01:40:39.669]  It also makes it fun like a game so that you don't get bored of it, but it also then
[01:40:45.023 --> 01:40:57.530]  But it just does so many things, and it also conditions us to accept the government inserting fake things in real things for our own good, getting us ready for more and more fake newscasts and all this generated.
[01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:03.634]  So understand, imagine, you're going to have to sit there and watch a screen, and then it's going to be tied into a live police feed.
[01:41:05.064 --> 01:41:09.508]  They gave the example of you're in Baltimore and you'll be watching somebody in Chicago or you're in Houston.
[01:41:09.768 --> 01:41:12.250]  You'll be watching somebody in San Diego.
[01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:17.574]  That way you don't see one of your own family members, something bad happening to them or something, and then not go along with it.
[01:41:17.795 --> 01:41:20.016]  And then you're there reporting all crime and everything.
[01:41:20.697 --> 01:41:23.579]  And so you're telling me, I've got to take this, but I'm going to be on TV tonight.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.641]  What time is Paula's On on?
[01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:28.003]  It's on at 7 o'clock Central.
[01:41:29.053 --> 01:41:34.997]  Okay, I'll probably type it myself, but if I don't, will somebody type this SP and mail it to me?
[01:41:35.037 --> 01:41:41.241]  So tell me in detail, just from a little blurb for the ad, what did they say this... Describe it for us.
[01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:45.263]  Well, it was just a brief promo during the course of the program itself.
[01:41:45.343 --> 01:41:52.188]  It was probably 15, maybe 15 seconds or so in duration, but basically it's called Citizen Spy.
[01:41:52.208 --> 01:41:58.592]  They're going to talk about it tonight during the program, and they're going to feature a stay-at-home mom who has a computer, and they showed
[01:41:59.409 --> 01:42:04.112]  A computer monitor, and it was segmented, you know, with different video feeds from different locations.
[01:42:04.853 --> 01:42:06.714]  And it really didn't go into any detail.
[01:42:07.334 --> 01:42:12.098]  But, uh, apparently, I guess they're going to cover that, uh, cover that in detail tonight.
[01:42:12.218 --> 01:42:12.758]  Is it good?
[01:42:12.818 --> 01:42:13.979]  Well, after 9-11?
[01:42:14.439 --> 01:42:15.600]  Maybe so!
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:27.508]  Well, one of the, I'm sorry, I was just going to say, one of the things that they talked about rather extensively on last night's program was the lack of, you know, security at the, uh, uh,
[01:42:28.157 --> 01:42:37.039]  You know, with the railways across the country, and they had Joseph Biden, and he was... And now we've got to have the TSA type searchers there, on the bridges, on the highways.
[01:42:37.079 --> 01:42:40.841]  Yeah, I saw Rich two and a half years ago say, everywhere is going to be like the airport.
[01:42:40.861 --> 01:42:41.181]  Go ahead.
[01:42:41.361 --> 01:42:42.021]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:46.042]  And they were talking about maybe, you know, needing to put cameras in and that kind of thing.
[01:42:46.062 --> 01:42:48.123]  They're going to search you when you go in the shopping mall.
[01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:49.483]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:49.523 --> 01:42:53.144]  But anyway, they're going to give... I guess they're going to give this quite a...
[01:42:54.193 --> 01:43:01.403]  Well, they haven't hired former Stasi Chiefs and KGB Chiefs.
[01:43:02.064 --> 01:43:02.685]  This is admitted.
[01:43:02.705 --> 01:43:06.610]  They haven't hired these people to bring them in to consult for nothing.
[01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:09.634]  Like, I've seen old... It was the weirdest thing.
[01:43:09.654 --> 01:43:11.737]  They have a university channel here in Austin.
[01:43:12.678 --> 01:43:14.239]  Channel 18 or 22, I forget.
[01:43:14.259 --> 01:43:15.300]  They have a couple channels.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:21.384]  They were airing old, but was dubbed in English, old East German TV shows.
[01:43:21.444 --> 01:43:24.286]  And it was all propaganda about, she's a caring mother.
[01:43:24.506 --> 01:43:25.927]  That's why she spies on her neighbor.
[01:43:26.387 --> 01:43:33.772]  You know, you may not think that it's aiding the evil Westerners and engaging in terrorism to hoard food coupons, but it is.
[01:43:33.912 --> 01:43:36.914]  Overall, it weakens the state and hurts her children.
[01:43:37.235 --> 01:43:38.515]  That's why she reports them.
[01:43:39.016 --> 01:43:41.357]  And aw, look at the great bounty of it.
[01:43:42.698 --> 01:43:44.960]  And so this is basically what our news is now.
[01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:51.947]  And well, you know Alex, that's the exact verbiage they used for the, you know, during the promo that they ran during the program last night.
[01:43:52.127 --> 01:43:53.629]  Oh, she's supporting her children, and yeah.
[01:43:53.749 --> 01:43:57.252]  Yeah, well, citizen spy is what they called it, but I just had one last thing.
[01:43:57.272 --> 01:44:00.035]  What is the latest on ArnoldExposed.com?
[01:44:00.055 --> 01:44:01.076]  What's the latest with that?
[01:44:02.037 --> 01:44:04.098]  Well, I'll tell you, I've bid off more than I can chew.
[01:44:04.138 --> 01:44:05.139]  We're going to run the ads.
[01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:06.279]  I've made some stuff.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.220]  We've extended out the contest.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.341]  We've only gotten a few entries.
[01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:10.482]  Millions of visitors.
[01:44:10.522 --> 01:44:11.822]  Only a few entries.
[01:44:11.842 --> 01:44:13.143]  $2,000 prize for the best ad.
[01:44:13.824 --> 01:44:16.385]  And I'm busy trying to finish this film in the next few weeks.
[01:44:16.805 --> 01:44:17.646]  Martial law.
[01:44:18.066 --> 01:44:19.046]  And it's going to happen.
[01:44:19.106 --> 01:44:20.147]  And we update the site.
[01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:20.867]  And we're going to do it.
[01:44:21.268 --> 01:44:21.468]  Great.
[01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:21.868]  All right.
[01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:22.708]  Well, thank you much, Alex.
[01:44:23.089 --> 01:44:23.329]  All right.
[01:44:23.349 --> 01:44:24.509]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:44:24.549 --> 01:44:25.030]  I really do.
[01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:28.232]  Yeah, it's just so sick, folks.
[01:44:28.272 --> 01:44:28.952]  Torture's good.
[01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:30.053]  We're going to spy on you.
[01:44:30.113 --> 01:44:30.713]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:31.617 --> 01:44:33.058]  Marijuana aids terrorists.
[01:44:33.098 --> 01:44:35.039]  We're going to arrest you as a terrorist.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.342]  We're going to put your kids on drugs that actually Swiss cheese their brains.
[01:44:40.243 --> 01:44:42.144]  But don't smoke what George Washington did.
[01:44:42.164 --> 01:44:43.945]  I don't like marijuana.
[01:44:43.965 --> 01:44:46.347]  I don't think it's good, but it's good for a few medical things.
[01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:55.513]  The point is, don't swat in people's houses looking for marijuana while you're pushing 15% of the kids already on the drugs that are 100 times worse.
[01:44:56.214 --> 01:44:56.774]  More than that,
[01:44:58.633 --> 01:45:13.725]  Hey Alex, I'm a new listener.
[01:45:14.546 --> 01:45:17.188]  Recently awoke out of the Matrix about a year and a half ago.
[01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:24.574]  I was a gospel singer and itinerating preacher for 25 years and moved to Nashville about five years ago and got into the media.
[01:45:26.545 --> 01:45:50.932]  And I just want to ask if you could put on the front of your webpage maybe a link to a page dedicated to giving us specifics, information on how to hold a town meeting, your resolution to fight the Patriot Act, specifics on your rules about copying and distributing videos, specifics on action that we can take.
[01:45:53.402 --> 01:46:01.185]  Well, basically, everybody just needs to start informing others and daily focusing and thinking about just how serious all this is.
[01:46:02.166 --> 01:46:05.707]  And people, I mean, it's not hard to set up town hall meetings.
[01:46:05.727 --> 01:46:06.948]  People should be able to figure that out.
[01:46:08.188 --> 01:46:14.070]  I came up with the idea to throw Patriot X out at the city and state and county level and put it out.
[01:46:14.131 --> 01:46:16.371]  People picked it up and expanded on it and ran with it.
[01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:19.813]  Last time I checked, there's over 400 cities and 4 states have done it.
[01:46:21.317 --> 01:46:22.678]  I mean, I can't think of it all.
[01:46:24.318 --> 01:46:25.819]  I tell you what, I mean, you got any ideas?
[01:46:25.839 --> 01:46:30.240]  I mean, I'd love to build a page about activism and solutions.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.581]  It's just that I can only do so much.
[01:46:32.681 --> 01:46:33.121]  I hear you.
[01:46:34.062 --> 01:46:35.262]  I couldn't find your resolution.
[01:46:35.282 --> 01:46:39.984]  Maybe your webmaster could put a link or something a little clearer on that resolution, because I'll just print it off.
[01:46:40.004 --> 01:46:45.526]  We'll just type in, um, Restoring the Constitution Resolution Alex Jones into a search engine.
[01:46:46.446 --> 01:46:46.666]  Okay.
[01:46:47.547 --> 01:46:48.247]  Anything else, sir?
[01:46:49.079 --> 01:46:53.744]  Well, I'm a preacher and I've been kicked out of many churches for preaching the truth.
[01:46:54.264 --> 01:46:58.428]  And I think that the problem with the Christians is they're looking to hirelings and false shepherds.
[01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:02.553]  The handlers are running the denominations behind the scenes.
[01:47:02.613 --> 01:47:03.694]  They're just hierarchies.
[01:47:04.054 --> 01:47:05.876]  That's not what Jesus and the apostles taught.
[01:47:05.916 --> 01:47:07.297]  They taught servant leadership.
[01:47:07.698 --> 01:47:10.120]  The apostles and the ministers had their own businesses.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:10.901]  They were independent.
[01:47:11.354 --> 01:47:14.876]  It wasn't this big money-making, multi-level ministry scheme we have now.
[01:47:14.916 --> 01:47:25.560]  The people have got to start thinking for themselves, going to the crosswalk.com, looking up the scriptures in the Greek, like Romans 13, seeing what it really says, and start fighting for our country.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.041]  Because the prophets didn't say the New World Order had to take over America.
[01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:29.982]  They said the world.
[01:47:30.322 --> 01:47:31.763]  And the world was the system.
[01:47:32.083 --> 01:47:38.005]  And the world was referring to Europe, China, Asia, and the cradle of civilization.
[01:47:38.065 --> 01:47:39.426]  They didn't even know about America then.
[01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:43.327]  God's given us this country as a place of refuge, and we need to fight for it.
[01:47:43.607 --> 01:47:47.608]  We need to believe... Why do you think the New World Order is concentrating most of its firepower here?
[01:47:48.408 --> 01:47:55.069]  Oh yeah, we're the last ones that still have guns, and God is blessing us, but we've got to repent of this abortion and all our sins.
[01:47:55.209 --> 01:47:59.170]  If we'll repent of our sins, He'll heal our land, but He's calling the Christians to repent.
[01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:00.450]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:04.711]  No, I mean, Christ spoke out against the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[01:48:05.831 --> 01:48:10.934]  Up there parading around, telling the Jews how good Rome was, go along with Rome.
[01:48:10.954 --> 01:48:14.215]  You know, going after the zealots.
[01:48:16.216 --> 01:48:16.496]  Sick.
[01:48:16.516 --> 01:48:17.957]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:48:18.837 --> 01:48:20.718]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[01:48:22.599 --> 01:48:24.080]  Cheryl in Ohio, go ahead.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:34.385]  Hi sir, I was wondering if you had heard anything on your local news in regarding some classified
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:49:03.380]  Documents that now have become unclassified in regards to back during Vietnam, Gulf War I, Gulf War II, that they had chemicals that they could use on our men and women in war that they would be able to spray, that our men and women would be able to chase one another of the same sex.
[01:49:04.292 --> 01:49:05.614]  Yeah, that's come out.
[01:49:05.654 --> 01:49:07.275]  I mean, they've been developing this for a while.
[01:49:08.477 --> 01:49:14.623]  It's a super aphrodisiac meant to be sprayed on trips for the same sex.
[01:49:14.704 --> 01:49:17.306]  And that broke into the news again about a week ago.
[01:49:18.266 --> 01:49:18.506]  Yes.
[01:49:19.326 --> 01:49:21.487]  I posted it on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:22.228 --> 01:49:23.228]  It is on your site?
[01:49:23.488 --> 01:49:25.149]  Yeah, it's somewhere last week in there.
[01:49:25.489 --> 01:49:32.252]  Okay, because, you know, if that's not a form of torture in of itself, then I don't know what is.
[01:49:32.272 --> 01:49:34.913]  Well, notice how much of this torture is sexual, see?
[01:49:35.313 --> 01:49:35.473]  Yes.
[01:49:35.493 --> 01:49:36.834]  It's a club host for a bunch of perverts.
[01:49:36.954 --> 01:49:37.214]  Yes.
[01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:43.617]  And so, basically, who knows what they're...could they be spraying that in the chemtrails?
[01:49:45.003 --> 01:49:46.747]  They're doing all kinds of stuff, my dear.
[01:49:46.767 --> 01:49:47.629]  Good points.
[01:49:47.869 --> 01:49:48.531]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:48.551 --> 01:49:48.992]  We'll be back.
[01:49:53.388 --> 01:50:00.255]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.555 --> 01:50:01.937]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.117 --> 01:50:04.319]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.479 --> 01:50:06.561]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.842 --> 01:50:11.787]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.127 --> 01:50:16.151]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:18.152]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.232 --> 01:50:28.876]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.036 --> 01:50:30.937]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.137 --> 01:50:34.678]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info.
[01:50:34.778 --> 01:50:35.399]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.603 --> 01:51:00.126]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:00.406 --> 01:51:11.310]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:13.393]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:13.653 --> 01:51:16.977]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:17.318 --> 01:51:27.772]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:28.072 --> 01:51:28.572]  That's right.
[01:51:28.732 --> 01:51:35.854]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:36.154 --> 01:51:40.276]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:51:40.436 --> 01:51:44.897]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.917 --> 01:51:45.417]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.395 --> 01:51:54.736]  I think so.
[01:52:09.677 --> 01:52:10.277]  I think so.
[01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:34.330]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:38.931]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.

[01:52:54.594 --> 01:52:57.675]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[01:53:00.572 --> 01:53:02.852]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:12.634 --> 01:53:21.216]  Alright, third hour coming up.
[01:53:21.256 --> 01:53:21.876]  Tons of news.
[01:53:21.916 --> 01:53:23.076]  Your call is continuing at 800-259-9241.
[01:53:29.113 --> 01:53:41.479]  Before I go back into the news here, a little bit of the news at the end of this hour, I just really call on all of you, every man and woman, black, white, old, young, to join me in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.781]  To inform yourself about the true nature of the globalists.
[01:53:45.642 --> 01:53:48.463]  And yes, to get my films, and to make copies of them.
[01:53:49.283 --> 01:53:54.146]  I authorize you, I beg you, I beseech you, on my knees, please take action!
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:54:00.864]  Get the films, jam them in the VCR, jam them in the DVD burner, and begin making copies!
[01:54:01.944 --> 01:54:03.285]  Give them to opinion makers.
[01:54:03.865 --> 01:54:04.846]  Give them to people.
[01:54:05.306 --> 01:54:06.067]  Educate others.
[01:54:06.127 --> 01:54:11.450]  I've made eleven powerful videos that are very informative and all documented.
[01:54:13.151 --> 01:54:22.957]  If you want to know what's really going on in the world, you want to have facts, you want to have a tool that has been very effective at waking others up, the videos will do it.
[01:54:24.164 --> 01:54:28.487]  For those that will watch the videos with an open mind, we're getting a 90% conversion rate.
[01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:31.109]  That is, they're waking up and agreeing with the information.
[01:54:31.129 --> 01:54:34.772]  And the next step is getting more informed for them and then taking action.
[01:54:35.672 --> 01:54:41.177]  The globalists have got to get us to at least be buffaloed by them or be confused by them so they can carry out their agenda.
[01:54:41.457 --> 01:54:43.258]  We have to shine a light on that!
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:52.525]  My videos are all over two hours long, except for the newest one, American Dictators, a little under two hours long, five minutes under two hours.
[01:54:53.524 --> 01:55:10.944]  On the DVD in about 95 minutes on the VHS, American Dictators exposes the false left-right paradigm of the election and shows the frauds they consider skull and bones and Bush and Kerry being cousins and all the other so-called things that they do that aren't very Christian or conservative.
[01:55:13.104 --> 01:55:14.225]  You need to have this video.
[01:55:14.965 --> 01:55:18.006]  If you buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy is $5.95.
[01:55:18.446 --> 01:55:22.128]  I'm still offering this slash-rate special.
[01:55:22.188 --> 01:55:23.068]  Same with Road Journey.
[01:55:23.088 --> 01:55:23.468]  $24.95 on DVD.
[01:55:23.488 --> 01:55:24.109]  Almost 3 hours, 170 minutes.
[01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:25.569]  Just 10 minutes short of
[01:55:30.306 --> 01:55:31.868]  3 hours, each additional copy $5.95.
[01:55:32.308 --> 01:55:35.612]  So why not buy 5, 10, 20 copies?
[01:55:35.932 --> 01:55:40.096]  Give them as gifts, or sell them for $20 at your bookstore, or your restaurant.
[01:55:40.256 --> 01:55:41.998]  I don't care, just get it out to people!
[01:55:42.338 --> 01:55:42.939]  Please!
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.061]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:50.422 --> 01:55:52.184]  Triple 8, 253-3139.
[01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.746]  Or just write to me.
[01:55:54.806 --> 01:56:00.452]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:56:02.954 --> 01:56:08.480]  Or you can, again, simply go to InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[01:56:09.864 --> 01:56:11.045]  That's all I'm going to say on the subject.
[01:56:11.065 --> 01:56:11.865]  I hope you take action.
[01:56:11.905 --> 01:56:14.066]  Another big solution is any talk show host locally.
[01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.968]  Tell them the truth about the New World Order.
[01:56:16.048 --> 01:56:16.588]  Promote them.
[01:56:16.648 --> 01:56:17.368]  Tell people about them.
[01:56:17.769 --> 01:56:18.549]  I broadcast.
[01:56:18.729 --> 01:56:21.971]  Tell people about it whether you listen on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[01:56:23.352 --> 01:56:24.472]  Spread the word.
[01:56:25.393 --> 01:56:27.414]  Expose Bush for not being a conservative.
[01:56:29.555 --> 01:56:31.957]  And get in people's faces that are promoting torture.
[01:56:31.977 --> 01:56:37.160]  These are sick, sick people on their way to becoming just bankrupt minds.
[01:56:38.172 --> 01:56:38.493]  U.S.
[01:56:38.573 --> 01:56:40.255]  officers want more troops in Iraq.
[01:56:40.435 --> 01:56:44.460]  UPI, despite the Pentagon's assessment, there are sufficient U.S.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.522]  troops in Iraq.
[01:56:45.662 --> 01:56:47.384]  Officers there routinely request more.
[01:56:47.404 --> 01:56:49.246]  The Washington Times reported Monday.
[01:56:49.347 --> 01:56:52.350]  Well, if they just say you don't need more, it's so.
[01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:53.452]  Learn to double-think.
[01:56:54.053 --> 01:56:57.756]  A retired general who asked not to be named because he does business with the Pentagon.
[01:56:58.176 --> 01:57:04.862]  In the newspaper, the open, often requested figure is six to eight more brigades or even more than 50,000 more troops.
[01:57:05.402 --> 01:57:08.265]  They are not bemoaning, not griping, it's just the way they feel.
[01:57:08.625 --> 01:57:09.966]  They need, the source said.
[01:57:11.067 --> 01:57:14.490]  General John Abizid, the U.S.
[01:57:14.530 --> 01:57:18.493]  commander in the region, was not requested a sizable increase in strength.
[01:57:19.133 --> 01:57:21.275]  The Bush administration has settled on troop U.S.
[01:57:21.335 --> 01:57:22.076]  forces of 150,000 troops in Iraq
[01:57:24.221 --> 01:57:26.722]  For the January 30th elections, an increase of 12,000.
[01:57:27.642 --> 01:57:29.403]  There are no elections!
[01:57:29.843 --> 01:57:32.384]  No one's running against the installed candidates!
[01:57:33.184 --> 01:57:33.884]  That's admitted!
[01:57:34.805 --> 01:57:36.285]  But they keep calling it an election!
[01:57:37.666 --> 01:57:40.907]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the third hour.
[01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:50.530]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.191 --> 01:57:52.191]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:57.242]  What would it profit a man if he gained the whole world, but lost his soul?
[01:57:57.482 --> 01:57:58.642]  Humanity is being warped.
[01:58:19.147 --> 01:58:20.628]  Humanity's always had problems.
[01:58:20.648 --> 01:58:21.508]  It's always been evil.
[01:58:21.528 --> 01:58:22.989]  But it's growing.
[01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:25.470]  It's expanding.
[01:58:27.171 --> 01:58:27.911]  It's a stench.
[01:58:30.452 --> 01:58:31.012]  Pathetic.
[01:58:32.733 --> 01:58:33.193]  Reeking.
[01:58:34.854 --> 01:58:35.134]  Heap.
[01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:36.755]  Of pain.
[01:58:36.775 --> 01:58:40.417]  And it's run by a bunch of control freaks.
[01:58:42.398 --> 01:58:44.719]  My friends, we must defeat the New World Order.
[01:58:44.739 --> 01:58:47.200]  We're going to take a ton of your calls here in the third hour.
[01:58:48.519 --> 01:58:50.080]  Go straight to your calls after this break.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:54.181]  I'm gonna go to your calls one after the other in rapid succession.
[01:58:54.201 --> 01:59:00.624]  1-800-259-9231 What do you think about these people?
[01:59:00.664 --> 01:59:03.105]  You hear all over talk radio and TV going, Torture's good!
[01:59:03.485 --> 01:59:04.705]  Yes, let's torture people!
[01:59:05.585 --> 01:59:06.306]  Let's torture them!
[01:59:06.346 --> 01:59:07.126]  Torture's wonderful!
[01:59:09.247 --> 01:59:10.787]  What's wrong with their minds?
[01:59:10.807 --> 01:59:10.867]  1-800-259-9231
[01:59:16.710 --> 01:59:22.952]  Pamela Lisa Rice is in testimony right now for the Senate for her confirmation as Secretary of State.
[01:59:22.972 --> 01:59:25.773]  The lady that said the government never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings.
[01:59:25.793 --> 01:59:33.776]  No, there have just been scores of government drills concerning it and missile launchers on top of the Genoa-Italy summit months before 9-11 put there by our government.
[01:59:33.796 --> 01:59:38.918]  And they just had a CIA memo specifically giving details of it a month before, but they never heard of such a plan.
[01:59:40.978 --> 01:59:42.939]  And they never said there were weapons of mass destruction either.
[01:59:42.999 --> 01:59:44.479]  No, just hundreds of times apiece.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:46.060]  Literally.
[01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:51.815]  Now the Feds have been fear-mongering that terrorists may attack the inauguration.
[01:59:52.875 --> 01:59:55.015]  And after they've created fear, then they withdraw the fear.
[01:59:55.035 --> 01:59:57.796]  And, oh, we don't think that's going to happen now, because you gave up all your rights.
[01:59:58.436 --> 02:00:03.877]  Just don't look the President in the eye, they said.
[02:00:05.457 --> 02:00:09.978]  Don't look the President in the eye, because, well, that's what terrorists do.
[02:00:10.758 --> 02:00:12.758]  And Stanley Hilton we've got coming on later this week.
[02:00:12.798 --> 02:00:16.639]  Bob Dole, former Chief of Staff, that's suing the Bush administration for involvement in 9-11.
[02:00:18.368 --> 02:00:21.310]  Got an interview with him, a clip of him in Masters of Terror.
[02:00:22.811 --> 02:00:24.032]  His suit's been thrown out.
[02:00:25.132 --> 02:00:28.094]  So, we'll be covering this little article about that.
[02:00:28.454 --> 02:00:29.775]  Also, an article on the London Independent.
[02:00:30.035 --> 02:00:33.958]  Was Robert Kennedy killed by a real Manchurian candidate-style assassination?
[02:00:33.978 --> 02:00:35.178]  We'll cover this story.
[02:00:35.198 --> 02:00:36.359]  Another one out of the Boston Club.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.202]  Martin Luther King family still convinced assassination was conspiracy.
[02:00:41.642 --> 02:00:47.046]  Airbus unveils the new super-jumbo European leaders hail lead over the United States.
[02:00:48.143 --> 02:00:50.484]  Minnesota Town hits 54 below zero.
[02:00:51.024 --> 02:00:53.385]  Man, I complain down here in Texas when it gets down to freezing.
[02:00:53.805 --> 02:00:54.385]  I'm a wimp!
[02:00:54.505 --> 02:00:56.166]  Minnesota Town hits 54 below zero.
[02:00:56.186 --> 02:01:09.450]  Associated Press temperatures plummeted across the eastern half of the nation last night, approaching an all-time record in northern Minnesota and freezing the Gulf Coast as a river of Arctic air pushed southward.
[02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:15.792]  Thermometers registered at a low of 54 degrees below zero at Imbaras, Minnesota.
[02:01:16.477 --> 02:01:27.263]  You keep living, but it gets old after a while, said Christine McAuley, the town clerk of the community of 691 people in the Northeast Minnesota.
[02:01:27.283 --> 02:01:36.989]  Minnesota's record low is 60 below, set in February of 1996 in Tower, about 10 miles north of Imbaras.
[02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:43.873]  The cold in Imbaras didn't stop the regular customer from getting their morning coffee at Four Corners, a cafe and gas station.
[02:01:45.023 --> 02:01:49.246]  Doesn't really have to do with the New World Order, but it is interesting.
[02:01:49.266 --> 02:01:54.109]  54 degrees below zero.
[02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:56.251]  Man, that's got to be painful.
[02:01:57.832 --> 02:02:00.013]  The network's based up in Minnesota, St.
[02:02:00.053 --> 02:02:00.374]  Paul.
[02:02:00.394 --> 02:02:04.116]  And I'm glad I'm down in Texas.
[02:02:04.516 --> 02:02:11.201]  Of course, they don't have to put up with 115 degree August days sometimes.
[02:02:11.401 --> 02:02:12.402]  I remember doing two a days.
[02:02:13.146 --> 02:02:16.967]  Back in high school, a football man is out there running sprints in 115 degree weather.
[02:02:17.648 --> 02:02:21.989]  That... That'll make you percolate like a... like a sieve.
[02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:31.072]  Alright, um... We'll, uh, come back and take calls and get into just a lot of other news and a lot of what I just mentioned.

[02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:51.071]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:02:57.297 --> 02:03:02.561]  In 2 hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:02.841 --> 02:03:06.965]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.125 --> 02:03:10.930]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.190 --> 02:03:15.836]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:15.936 --> 02:03:22.184]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.244 --> 02:03:24.066]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:05:33.999 --> 02:05:34.920]  Central Standard Time.
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:35.981]  Then back from 9 to midnight.
[02:05:59.947 --> 02:06:01.268]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:01.348 --> 02:06:02.949]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:02.969 --> 02:06:06.831]  Let me cover just a couple articles.
[02:06:06.872 --> 02:06:09.313]  I'll go to John, Diane, Nick, and others that are holding.
[02:06:09.653 --> 02:06:12.295]  Military test lasers to warn off aircraft.
[02:06:13.075 --> 02:06:16.117]  I mentioned this last Friday.
[02:06:17.218 --> 02:06:20.220]  Didn't read the article, and then I got an email saying I was lying about it.
[02:06:21.561 --> 02:06:22.341]  Okay, fine.
[02:06:23.382 --> 02:06:24.343]  I'll read the article.
[02:06:24.423 --> 02:06:26.344]  This is from the Washington Post.
[02:06:28.032 --> 02:06:30.633]  Military test lasers to warn off aircraft.
[02:06:30.673 --> 02:06:40.797]  Now before I read this article, six months ago there was suddenly a rash of articles Al Qaeda is going to target aircraft with lasers.
[02:06:41.357 --> 02:06:42.518]  Industrial lasers.
[02:06:43.418 --> 02:06:56.103]  I wonder why they were promoting it so much and I said there's only a question of time until some idiot playing around with their laser pointer points it at a helicopter or aircraft and the people see the red light go across the windshield
[02:06:57.037 --> 02:06:57.618]  We're good to go.
[02:07:11.776 --> 02:07:16.921]  Many times, you know, I've been downtown going to a restaurant by the bar district and it was a fad a few years ago.
[02:07:16.941 --> 02:07:17.762]  Still kind of a fad.
[02:07:17.802 --> 02:07:19.644]  I mean, just laser pointers everywhere.
[02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:23.028]  I've been at movies probably 15 times.
[02:07:23.048 --> 02:07:25.830]  Probably a third of the movies I've gone to in the last few years.
[02:07:26.151 --> 02:07:28.473]  Somebody aims a laser pointer at the screen.
[02:07:29.154 --> 02:07:30.715]  They sell them at all the gas stations.
[02:07:30.735 --> 02:07:31.336]  You've seen them.
[02:07:32.466 --> 02:07:37.751]  And so, some father with his daughter was messing around with a tiny laser, pointing it, and hit a plane.
[02:07:37.771 --> 02:07:51.004]  I still don't understand how a plane's above you and it hits the cockpit, but... And then they admit there's no danger, but they come and arrest him and charge him as a terrorist, you know, and... And I wondered, you know, why suddenly do they talk about this before it happened?
[02:07:53.166 --> 02:07:54.146]  Well, then this came out.
[02:07:54.906 --> 02:08:01.888]  A day after the Department of Transportation urged pilots to report hazardous laser beams aimed at aircraft, the U.S.
[02:08:01.928 --> 02:08:11.711]  military said it was testing a system to beam red and green lasers at aircraft in the Washington area as a warning when they entered restricted airspace.
[02:08:12.822 --> 02:08:29.359]  The plan has prompted confusion among some area pilots who said they were unsure whether they would be able to tell the difference between a commercial laser used by someone playing at home and one operated by the North American Aerospace Defense Command who carried out the 9-11 attacks, I would add.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:30.881]  Transportation Secretary
[02:08:31.619 --> 02:08:38.322]  Norman Y. Mineta on Wednesday urged pilots to report laser sightings to the Federal Aviation Administration and local law enforcement.
[02:08:38.763 --> 02:08:45.186]  A commercially available laser beamed into a cockpit can distract a pilot and, in rare cases, cause permanent eye damage.
[02:08:45.606 --> 02:08:46.527]  That's a total lie.
[02:08:46.867 --> 02:08:55.731]  You aim one of these lasers... Man, I've, again, I've got one somewhere around here where the cat or the chihuahua, you aim it at the ground and it chases it around.
[02:08:55.811 --> 02:08:57.332]  It's kind of fun.
[02:08:57.352 --> 02:08:58.332]  I talked about that last week.
[02:08:58.372 --> 02:09:01.214]  I want to dig it out and play with the chihuahua or the cat again.
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:06.663]  But I've been out in the front yard, folks, and I'm going to admit it.
[02:09:07.103 --> 02:09:09.004]  I've aimed a stop sign with it.
[02:09:10.124 --> 02:09:14.467]  And by the time it hits a stop sign 100 yards away or 200 yards, it covers the whole stop sign.
[02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:15.948]  These lasers spread out.
[02:09:15.988 --> 02:09:18.589]  They're not really lasers in the true sense.
[02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:25.353]  It's just a directed beam of light, which I guess the sun shining on you is a broad-spectrum laser.
[02:09:26.553 --> 02:09:27.954]  And it just isn't true.
[02:09:29.591 --> 02:09:32.673]  I mean, even a powerful laser on a rifle.
[02:09:34.114 --> 02:09:39.517]  You know, you're out in the woods, and you point it at a fence post 400 yards away.
[02:09:40.397 --> 02:09:42.699]  It's about the size of a baseball.
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:49.003]  I think they want to demonize lasers to ban their use, so you can't have them on your guns.
[02:09:49.763 --> 02:09:53.605]  And I said that, and another, well actually a listener called about it, and he was right.
[02:09:53.645 --> 02:09:54.926]  Now they're announcing it.
[02:09:56.227 --> 02:09:57.287]  Everything's got to be restricted.
[02:09:57.307 --> 02:09:58.168]  Everything's got to be criminal.
[02:09:59.147 --> 02:10:15.079]  But then it turns out, in the areas where we've been having these laser problems, NORAD spokesman said, told the Aviation Administration, prepare to start having planes be hit by our lasers, but said, oh, don't worry, it won't hurt you.
[02:10:16.179 --> 02:10:20.222]  And be ready to see us testing our lasers, which are even more powerful.
[02:10:21.783 --> 02:10:23.485]  I mean, you've got a plane, folks, at 1,000 feet.
[02:10:23.505 --> 02:10:25.426]  A helicopter at 1,000 feet, 800 feet, 500 feet.
[02:10:28.599 --> 02:10:34.561]  I mean, even if you buy one of these lasers they have for light shows, those things spread out quite a bit.
[02:10:34.601 --> 02:10:37.422]  I mean, it's just going to be a green or red light reflecting off.
[02:10:37.502 --> 02:10:38.402]  It's a joke!
[02:10:38.962 --> 02:10:40.143]  It could distract somebody.
[02:10:42.223 --> 02:10:47.805]  It's like all over the country they're banning cell phones in the car without a headset.
[02:10:50.506 --> 02:10:54.227]  Well, now the feds have come out and said, we want to ban headsets too.
[02:10:56.068 --> 02:10:57.488]  Well, get ready for them to ban everything.
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:04.470]  Eating in the car, talking in the car, putting a CD in, it's going to be a felony.
[02:11:05.031 --> 02:11:05.692]  You think I'm joking?
[02:11:05.712 --> 02:11:07.254]  They're announcing it.
[02:11:07.274 --> 02:11:09.217]  So see, they start banning and it just accelerates.
[02:11:12.896 --> 02:11:13.857]  Everything's going to be a crime.
[02:11:13.897 --> 02:11:18.120]  And the Feds have said they're trying to pass the law or get the regulation through.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:22.664]  We're talking Houston Chronicle, when I first saw it three, four years ago.
[02:11:23.084 --> 02:11:26.406]  Last week, Ergonomics Today, the major industry publication.
[02:11:26.967 --> 02:11:29.469]  Major car manufacturers are preparing to make it standard.
[02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:34.853]  A camera that constantly scans your face, like the Void Comp and Blade Runner.
[02:11:37.515 --> 02:11:42.519]  Where if your eye is moving too fast with a micro-vibration, that means you're tired, your car will not start.
[02:11:44.571 --> 02:11:46.012]  That's what the industry publications say.
[02:11:46.052 --> 02:11:47.814]  You read the mainstream news, it's a little bit less.
[02:11:47.834 --> 02:11:48.774]  They tell you, oh, how good it is.
[02:11:49.895 --> 02:11:51.376]  There's pressure sensors in the car.
[02:11:51.416 --> 02:11:58.322]  If someone in it with a thermometer picks up, if it's over 98 degrees and someone's in the car, it starts giving you a warning.
[02:11:58.362 --> 02:12:01.664]  And if you don't respond, you say, oh, I just got in the car and just started it.
[02:12:02.185 --> 02:12:05.207]  It's an AI computer, primitive AI, artificial intelligence.
[02:12:05.467 --> 02:12:11.672]  Then it goes ahead and calls the police and uplinks them with the infrared camera, because it can see in the dark, too.
[02:12:13.411 --> 02:12:15.413]  So, um, and this will be in your cars!
[02:12:15.453 --> 02:12:16.714]  This will happen!
[02:12:18.155 --> 02:12:19.476]  You will be watched by it!
[02:12:19.956 --> 02:12:25.861]  And when you're doing distractive driving, if you look away from, uh, straight forward for more than 1.5 seconds, it warns you!
[02:12:25.881 --> 02:12:35.828]  The third time, it notifies and dials into the police department, and it pops up at the emergency management facility, and they have the video of you!
[02:12:38.410 --> 02:12:40.412]  They have the video of you in the vehicle!
[02:12:44.341 --> 02:12:47.743]  Ladies and gentlemen, now again, this is not a joke.
[02:12:47.884 --> 02:12:48.644]  This is happening.
[02:12:48.984 --> 02:12:52.367]  There are cameras in hundreds of schools that we know of in the bathrooms.
[02:12:54.768 --> 02:12:58.531]  And when a janitor gets caught doing it, because they're a pervert, he gets ten years in prison and he should.
[02:12:58.911 --> 02:13:03.094]  But when the official school district does it, and gets caught, they say, yes, it's good, aha!
[02:13:03.254 --> 02:13:10.178]  And then they were caught with one Tennessee school trading the video on the internet of the ten-year-old girls taking showers.
[02:13:11.519 --> 02:13:12.220]  Associated Press.
[02:13:13.413 --> 02:13:16.055]  Are you starting to get what I'm saying here?
[02:13:16.075 --> 02:13:17.697]  This is unbelievable!
[02:13:18.157 --> 02:13:21.581]  There is no rational, calm response to this.
[02:13:21.641 --> 02:13:22.561]  This is insane.
[02:13:22.822 --> 02:13:26.645]  If we were normal, we'd be running down the street screaming, freaking out over this.
[02:13:26.705 --> 02:13:29.888]  This is pull your hair out, stick your head out of the window, start screaming.
[02:13:30.829 --> 02:13:31.810]  This is insane!
[02:13:33.912 --> 02:13:35.033]  They're just doing it!
[02:13:35.413 --> 02:13:39.257]  I remember five, six years ago, AP, Detroit Free Press,
[02:13:40.783 --> 02:13:41.383]  Out of Michigan.
[02:13:41.664 --> 02:13:47.547]  Almost all their roadside rest stops put cameras not just in the restrooms, but in the stalls.
[02:13:48.167 --> 02:13:49.208]  Oh, it will stop crying!
[02:13:51.769 --> 02:13:53.610]  Now they've got AI computers and all this.
[02:13:53.650 --> 02:13:54.751]  It'll be scanning your face.
[02:13:55.871 --> 02:13:56.672]  They'll be doing it all.
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:01.222]  I mean, folks, this is worse than Brave New World.
[02:14:01.242 --> 02:14:01.982]  This is worse than 1984.
[02:14:02.702 --> 02:14:04.944]  It has nothing to do with terrorism!
[02:14:05.164 --> 02:14:09.926]  That terrorism legislation is actually giving the illegal aliens amnesty and accepting their fake IDs!
[02:14:09.946 --> 02:14:12.708]  Alright, I'll send a couple of calls.
[02:14:12.728 --> 02:14:14.168]  I apologize for running on.
[02:14:14.449 --> 02:14:16.930]  John in Ohio, then Diane, Nick, and others.
[02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:17.650]  John, go ahead.
[02:14:18.471 --> 02:14:26.635]  Yeah, I really appreciate your righteous indignation and the jumpstart to the conscience that I think the corporate media and these fascists in the government are
[02:14:27.668 --> 02:14:36.073]  I hope they're not making progress along those lines.
[02:14:36.153 --> 02:14:40.475]  It seems like they're putting something in the water that lobotomizes our conscience.
[02:14:40.675 --> 02:14:46.078]  I want to talk about the Robert Kennedy assassination and the Martin Luther King assassination.
[02:14:49.582 --> 02:14:54.167]  I think it's been known for many years, even decades, that this was a conspiracy.
[02:14:54.287 --> 02:14:58.691]  And it's interesting that the Indian government... Governments never kill their rivals in history.
[02:14:58.711 --> 02:14:59.512]  Oh, really?
[02:15:00.072 --> 02:15:01.754]  In fact, that's the norm in history.
[02:15:01.794 --> 02:15:03.616]  It's rare that assassination isn't going on.
[02:15:03.796 --> 02:15:05.878]  But nowadays, it doesn't exist.
[02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:06.999]  Absolutely.
[02:15:07.079 --> 02:15:10.883]  You know, and I find, I really have a real problem with some of the
[02:15:11.818 --> 02:15:28.549]  Left liberals who I think sometimes bring out important information like ZMAG.org, they've actually taken the policy on the one hand of exposing the horrific crimes of the CIA in genocide, in killing a million Indonesians, hundreds of thousands in Central America.
[02:15:28.889 --> 02:15:32.431]  But if it comes to the United States, we're not going to discuss any kind of conspiracy.
[02:15:32.531 --> 02:15:34.993]  It's a total schizophrenia.
[02:15:35.513 --> 02:15:41.596]  And, you know, I would hope that you would have somebody on maybe like from AssassinationScience.com we've had on before.
[02:15:41.656 --> 02:15:42.696]  I've had him on many times.
[02:15:43.017 --> 02:15:52.141]  Yeah, because this has been known for a long time that Robert Kennedy was killed by, as you say, a Manchurian candidate, sir hand, sir hand.
[02:15:52.481 --> 02:15:57.483]  Actually, the number of shots that were fired were almost double what could be held.
[02:15:57.523 --> 02:15:58.824]  The police have said that!
[02:15:59.224 --> 02:16:02.305]  Yes, and there was actually a photograph of the door jams with these bullet holes.
[02:16:02.566 --> 02:16:07.308]  The man who shot them was directly behind them a couple of inches away, St.
[02:16:07.388 --> 02:16:16.472]  Eugene Cesar, that was seen by witnesses, and he has connections to the private fronts for the CIA, even the Thomas Noguchi Corridor.
[02:16:16.492 --> 02:16:18.853]  Well, that's now in major British papers.
[02:16:18.893 --> 02:16:19.693]  They're now admitting it.
[02:16:20.053 --> 02:16:25.436]  Yeah, and it seems like this has been known for so long, and you get in the paper,
[02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:35.739]  And the media, this claim that somehow if people like Gerald Posner, these CIA agents that are constantly trying to refute any of this,
[02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:39.210]  Say that people have this innate need to believe in conspiracies.
[02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:40.591]  That's ridiculous as you've been pointing out.
[02:16:40.611 --> 02:16:41.171]  No, it's true.
[02:16:41.251 --> 02:16:41.631]  It's true.
[02:16:41.671 --> 02:16:47.914]  I mean, how dare the Roman history books say that there was a conspiracy to kill Caesar that they all turned stabbing him?
[02:16:48.174 --> 02:16:49.754]  I mean, it happened, but it's impossible.
[02:16:49.994 --> 02:16:51.735]  People in government don't kill their rivals.
[02:16:51.795 --> 02:16:52.475]  It's impossible.
[02:16:52.555 --> 02:16:53.376]  It's a conspiracy!
[02:16:53.616 --> 02:16:53.896]  No!
[02:16:54.076 --> 02:16:55.476]  No, Caesar was not killed!
[02:16:55.697 --> 02:16:56.897]  No one's ever been killed!
[02:16:57.077 --> 02:16:58.998]  We didn't have a bunch of presidents assassinated!
[02:16:59.218 --> 02:16:59.558]  No one!
[02:16:59.578 --> 02:17:00.859]  It's always lone people!
[02:17:00.959 --> 02:17:01.319]  Lone!
[02:17:01.419 --> 02:17:01.779]  Lone!
[02:17:02.159 --> 02:17:09.823]  As long as it's somebody on the hit list of the CIA, whether it's the former... Well, I mean, look, our government hired Saddam when he was 18 years old.
[02:17:10.344 --> 02:17:12.505]  Big scrappin' tough guy out of the Iraqi Army.
[02:17:13.125 --> 02:17:15.506]  In 54, trained him to assassinate and he killed hundreds.
[02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:17.808]  I mean, there's no assassination.
[02:17:17.948 --> 02:17:21.370]  MSNBC just came out and said, our troops are gonna kidnap and assassinate.
[02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:22.270]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:23.491]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:24.091 --> 02:17:25.632]  Yeah, we'll come back and straight your calls.
[02:17:25.652 --> 02:17:26.492]  Just write to them.
[02:17:26.632 --> 02:17:27.153]  Write to them.
[02:17:27.593 --> 02:17:29.254]  Diane and Nick and others.
[02:17:29.955 --> 02:17:30.675]  Stay with us!
[02:17:31.016 --> 02:17:33.016]  We're going in, we're going in full throttle!
[02:17:33.417 --> 02:17:35.598]  Engage the New World Order in the Info War!
[02:17:36.138 --> 02:17:38.059]  Mercilessly smash their lies!
[02:17:38.619 --> 02:17:40.020]  Crush their propaganda!
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:41.880]  Free the minds of the people!
[02:17:42.261 --> 02:17:43.081]  Revolt!
[02:17:45.682 --> 02:17:49.904]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.

[02:19:49.091 --> 02:19:51.712]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:52.472 --> 02:20:08.583]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[02:20:09.562 --> 02:20:14.807]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:20:15.607 --> 02:20:23.554]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.134 --> 02:20:53.743]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:20:53.963 --> 02:21:05.254]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:21:05.474 --> 02:21:08.077]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:08.437 --> 02:21:14.900]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.941]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:21:17.141 --> 02:21:23.163]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:21:23.404 --> 02:21:29.066]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:21:29.286 --> 02:21:30.447]  Alright, let's talk to Diane in Detroit.
[02:21:58.357 --> 02:21:59.438]  Go ahead, Diane, welcome.
[02:22:00.079 --> 02:22:00.980]  Yes, hello.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.823]  This is such a great thing to be able to talk to you.
[02:22:04.123 --> 02:22:07.267]  But I want to tell the nation right now something that's very important.
[02:22:07.807 --> 02:22:12.312]  If you listen to thedebka.com, I mean, go to that website.
[02:22:12.773 --> 02:22:15.596]  That is the, uh, the, uh, um, uh,
[02:22:16.545 --> 02:22:17.365]  We're good to go.
[02:22:34.754 --> 02:22:46.285]  And military officers of the former Saddam Hussein regime who had confirmed by intelligence to be established in Syria and running the guerrilla war in Iraq out of their homes and offices.
[02:22:46.665 --> 02:22:51.169]  And addresses, telephone numbers and cell phone numbers were listed beside each name.
[02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:53.812]  But the punchline was in the last demand.
[02:22:54.412 --> 02:22:59.114]  Just in case any are found in Iraq, General Casey, commander of the U.S.
[02:22:59.174 --> 02:23:14.559]  forces in Iraq, has already received orders from the commander-in-chief in the White House to pursue military action inside Syria according to his best military... No, that was in Reuters and the Associated Press a week ago... And also a Russian bomb had it on.
[02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:20.641]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, for a year and a half they've been bombing and strafing and shooting.
[02:23:20.661 --> 02:23:23.202]  There's been a war going on on the border with Syria.
[02:23:23.872 --> 02:23:25.073]  Right, we know that.
[02:23:25.113 --> 02:23:26.194]  It's already been going on.
[02:23:26.734 --> 02:23:27.034]  Right.
[02:23:27.975 --> 02:23:45.167]  But now they're saying that if they don't go ahead and also hand over these 55 individuals by the end of this month, that there's another thing that says that they're going to bomb in Syria in February.
[02:23:46.664 --> 02:23:53.446]  Yeah, I had heard that, and sometimes what they say is accurate, sometimes it's not, but they admit they want to go into Syria and Iran.
[02:23:53.486 --> 02:23:57.127]  I have family in the military, and they've been told that's their next stop.
[02:23:57.167 --> 02:23:58.087]  Diane, great points.
[02:23:58.507 --> 02:23:59.208]  Good to hear from you.
[02:23:59.248 --> 02:23:59.688]  Thank you.
[02:24:00.568 --> 02:24:01.788]  Nick in Missouri.
[02:24:01.848 --> 02:24:02.388]  Go ahead, Nick.
[02:24:03.549 --> 02:24:05.089]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:24:05.449 --> 02:24:06.310]  Nice talking to you.
[02:24:06.470 --> 02:24:07.410]  Nice talking to you, sir.
[02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:14.732]  Yes, I've been listening to your show for about four and a half years, and I want to compliment you on a wonderful year.
[02:24:15.202 --> 02:24:20.846]  The wonderful job you're doing exposing these, well these, uh, New World Order people.
[02:24:20.886 --> 02:24:22.307]  Those are the real terrorists.
[02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:28.032]  But, uh, anyway, uh, we gotta stop these people, man.
[02:24:28.252 --> 02:24:28.872]  We gotta do it.
[02:24:29.853 --> 02:24:35.037]  And, uh, these, uh, this special that you're offering, it's the greatest special yet.
[02:24:35.137 --> 02:24:39.861]  We're really gonna get the word out with these, uh, with these, uh, 595 additional copies.
[02:24:42.748 --> 02:24:44.108]  Well, I hope people take advantage of that.
[02:24:44.168 --> 02:24:45.629]  Yeah, you buy one of my videos.
[02:24:45.649 --> 02:24:46.969]  We're offering this with a few of the videos.
[02:24:46.989 --> 02:24:48.249]  You buy one at regular price.
[02:24:48.449 --> 02:24:54.030]  Every additional is $5.95 of that same title to give them as gifts or sell them in your store or whatever.
[02:24:54.570 --> 02:24:55.571]  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[02:24:55.631 --> 02:24:56.551]  I'm going to pass them out.
[02:24:57.011 --> 02:24:58.231]  Anyway, that's all I had to say.
[02:24:58.631 --> 02:24:59.851]  Well, I appreciate that, Nick.
[02:24:59.871 --> 02:25:00.432]  God bless you.
[02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:01.932]  Don in Missouri.
[02:25:01.992 --> 02:25:02.792]  Don, go ahead.
[02:25:03.912 --> 02:25:05.112]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:25:05.793 --> 02:25:07.293]  I'm a new caller.
[02:25:08.413 --> 02:25:09.473]  New soldier in the flank.
[02:25:10.153 --> 02:25:12.474]  Fallen rank.
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:17.501]  I'll try to articulate this as quickly as I can so you can move on.
[02:25:18.762 --> 02:25:41.569]  I just wanted to say to the congressmen or senators that might be listening to consider if they have a shadow government that they're prepared to put into play that if this group of people are willing to sacrifice dozens of children in Oklahoma City
[02:25:43.542 --> 02:26:07.764]  You know, thousands of people in New York City and our soldiers in Iraq exposing them to depleted uranium that they wouldn't think twice about murdering congressmen in order to put this shadow government into play.
[02:26:09.042 --> 02:26:15.283]  Well, right up in Missouri, another top microbiologist in bioweapons research was stabbed to death.
[02:26:15.763 --> 02:26:17.324]  It's hundreds of them now that have been murdered.
[02:26:17.344 --> 02:26:18.844]  We've got to ask, why is that happening?
[02:26:19.184 --> 02:26:25.145]  These are people that can treat or help develop this stuff, who can ID where these bioweapons are going to come from.
[02:26:25.865 --> 02:26:28.866]  And the reason I raise that is you talk about shadow government.
[02:26:28.886 --> 02:26:33.167]  They went ahead and passed it, where Congress gives up all its authority to go under FEMA control.
[02:26:34.071 --> 02:26:40.141]  and uh... the shadow government's now public and they've openly set up the mechanisms for total martial law
[02:26:40.779 --> 02:26:49.321]  But the borders are wide open and PDD-60 still stands, mutually assured destruction gone, saying we will absorb nuclear strikes before deciding what to do.
[02:26:49.581 --> 02:27:04.606]  They're doing everything to leave us wide open, arming North Korea, arming Pakistan, arming everybody, and then telling us we've got to go into Iran and Syria because they're a threat when they're not compared to these other nations, and while telling us as citizens we've got to give up all our freedoms while they leave the borders wide open.
[02:27:04.686 --> 02:27:05.386]  It's a joke!
[02:27:06.673 --> 02:27:17.022]  Well, I guess I'd just like to put out a plea to congressmen and senators to join our fight and stand up against this while they have a chance.
[02:27:18.043 --> 02:27:18.703]  I agree with you.
[02:27:18.823 --> 02:27:19.584]  Very good point.
[02:27:20.745 --> 02:27:24.368]  A lot of these congressmen will say, well, I protect my family by joining the New World Order.
[02:27:24.728 --> 02:27:25.789]  I'm on the winning team.
[02:27:26.850 --> 02:27:28.451]  You're on the winning team, huh?
[02:27:29.572 --> 02:27:32.315]  That's committing social suicide with our society.
[02:27:33.135 --> 02:27:33.696]  I'll be right back.
[02:27:35.959 --> 02:27:38.961]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.981 --> 02:27:42.663]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.206 --> 02:27:49.268]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:27:50.008 --> 02:27:53.490]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:27:54.091 --> 02:27:57.593]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:27:58.286 --> 02:28:00.847]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:28:00.867 --> 02:28:03.727]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:28:04.227 --> 02:28:05.648]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:28:06.368 --> 02:28:08.068]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[02:28:08.628 --> 02:28:09.569]  Check with your doctor.
[02:28:09.689 --> 02:28:14.590]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[02:28:15.050 --> 02:28:19.771]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[02:28:20.431 --> 02:28:21.271]  Light up your life.
[02:28:21.371 --> 02:28:24.032]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a northern light.
[02:28:24.625 --> 02:28:34.875]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com.
[02:28:35.375 --> 02:28:37.517]  That's northernlighttechnologies.com.
[02:28:38.098 --> 02:28:39.319]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:47.121]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:47.221 --> 02:28:57.927]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.287 --> 02:29:02.830]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[02:29:02.890 --> 02:29:14.236]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.816 --> 02:29:21.660]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:24.201]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.701 --> 02:29:29.644]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:29.964 --> 02:29:36.268]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.348 --> 02:29:40.531]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:40.751 --> 02:29:41.572]  That's toll free.
[02:29:41.592 --> 02:29:41.632]  888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:48.923]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[02:29:49.203 --> 02:29:51.525]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:29:51.725 --> 02:29:58.851]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:29:59.052 --> 02:30:04.436]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:30:04.696 --> 02:30:12.123]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:30:12.323 --> 02:30:13.444]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:30:13.664 --> 02:30:23.211]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.
[02:30:23.491 --> 02:30:27.855]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:30:28.155 --> 02:30:32.978]  Reclaim that youthful and energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help from Minerals from the Sea.
[02:30:33.179 --> 02:30:34.800]  Call for Sea Minerals today at 877-817-9829.
[02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:35.160]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.181]  Or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[02:31:03.803 --> 02:31:05.484]  I've said this many times and I'll say it again.
[02:31:05.524 --> 02:31:10.868]  This is the best way to describe the denial that we see in this nation.
[02:31:12.970 --> 02:31:14.711]  Those of you that have children have seen this.
[02:31:15.071 --> 02:31:16.873]  It's a fun game you play with them.
[02:31:17.953 --> 02:31:21.696]  A child covers their eyes when they're a toddler, when they're a baby.
[02:31:21.716 --> 02:31:26.680]  You can start playing pick-a-boo with a child normally by the time they're about a year old.
[02:31:28.331 --> 02:31:30.112]  Their brain has advanced enough to think it's funny.
[02:31:30.653 --> 02:31:34.656]  And you teach them how to cover their eyes and then the world disappears.
[02:31:34.756 --> 02:31:41.241]  Or you put a newspaper up in front of you and then lower it back down and they see you disappear and then reappear.
[02:31:41.701 --> 02:31:47.746]  Because to them, they look through their little eyes and the world only exists in their mind.
[02:31:49.507 --> 02:31:51.028]  And you have disappeared.
[02:31:52.069 --> 02:31:53.670]  And it's quite interesting to them.
[02:31:55.492 --> 02:31:55.832]  Peek-a-boo!
[02:31:57.498 --> 02:32:02.319]  But as soon as the child gets to be about two and figures out you're just covering your face, they just look around the side and laugh at you.
[02:32:02.339 --> 02:32:03.360]  They then know it's a game.
[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:06.380]  They laugh at the game itself, not at thinking you disappeared.
[02:32:07.401 --> 02:32:23.585]  But adults think that if they lie to themselves minute by minute, if they bury their head in the sand, or if they just rationalize and make excuses, or they just deny something exists, that it somehow goes away.
[02:32:25.347 --> 02:32:27.748]  And that isn't how the world works.
[02:32:27.908 --> 02:32:29.809]  Out of sight isn't out of mind.
[02:32:33.730 --> 02:32:40.412]  And, you know, you might deny to yourself that fire is hot, but stick your hand in it and you'll find out.
[02:32:42.133 --> 02:32:50.036]  You might deny to yourself that the national government is totally corrupt, that Roosevelt
[02:32:51.781 --> 02:32:53.622]  The Library of Congress has released the documents.
[02:32:53.642 --> 02:32:54.582]  They're public and admitted.
[02:32:55.062 --> 02:32:57.383]  Said, oh, we got 7,000 civilians in the Philippines.
[02:32:57.403 --> 02:32:58.583]  They could evacuate the next month.
[02:32:58.883 --> 02:33:00.144]  Don't let them evacuate.
[02:33:00.224 --> 02:33:02.404]  I want them to be captured.
[02:33:02.424 --> 02:33:04.905]  It'll be great newsreel propaganda.
[02:33:05.985 --> 02:33:12.388]  I've interviewed people who were 7-year-old girls who watched their parents executed by the Japanese and were abused.
[02:33:13.388 --> 02:33:15.128]  They were captured and of the 7,000, over 4,000 died.
[02:33:15.188 --> 02:33:16.209]  But it did make great propaganda.
[02:33:20.956 --> 02:33:24.017]  And again, a lot of you will think in your psychology, what are you saying, the Japanese are good?
[02:33:24.677 --> 02:33:25.317]  No, I'm not.
[02:33:25.337 --> 02:33:27.918]  I'm pointing out something that happened.
[02:33:29.379 --> 02:33:33.880]  It isn't who's good or who's bad like in a rah-rah football game whose side you're on.
[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:35.881]  My side's perfect no matter what they do.
[02:33:36.181 --> 02:33:37.361]  Why, you just hate America!
[02:33:38.462 --> 02:33:44.123]  America isn't these crooks that run our government unless we allow them to control us and go along with them.
[02:33:44.143 --> 02:33:46.644]  You know what's supposed to be we the people?
[02:33:47.104 --> 02:33:48.025]  We are above the government?
[02:33:48.345 --> 02:33:49.305]  Maybe you've heard that before?
[02:33:52.119 --> 02:33:56.102]  The government tells you now, oh, we're just doing all of this to keep you safe.
[02:33:56.362 --> 02:33:58.684]  We care so much about you.
[02:33:58.704 --> 02:34:01.205]  I mean, it's really a synthesis of evil.
[02:34:01.225 --> 02:34:03.567]  It is social Darwinism.
[02:34:04.648 --> 02:34:08.991]  And no, I'm not talking about the theory of evolution by Mr. Darwin.
[02:34:09.411 --> 02:34:13.514]  I mean, what the elite did with that was they created social Darwinism.
[02:34:13.894 --> 02:34:15.155]  Survival of the fittest.
[02:34:16.249 --> 02:34:20.133]  They make the excuse, hey, I'm the most ruthless, I'm the most cunning, I exercise power.
[02:34:20.153 --> 02:34:23.816]  They have a little contest of who's the most ruthless, who's the most cunning.
[02:34:25.018 --> 02:34:36.488]  And, uh, so I am fit to rule because I am willing to do all these horrible things and someone else would be doing these horrible things if I wasn't doing it, but just the way the world's always worked, so it might as well be me.
[02:34:36.549 --> 02:34:37.429]  That's just the way it is.
[02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:46.517]  And besides, we have all these lofty plans once we've cleaned up humanity and gotten control and secured all the rogue technologies that could threaten our monopoly of power.
[02:34:46.537 --> 02:34:49.120]  You know, this is the whole line they give people.
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:56.708]  In the establishment, in the technocracy, in the feats of power over different mechanisms of the overall superstructure.
[02:34:58.790 --> 02:35:06.659]  And so, the world goes along with the lie, through the PR and the slick packaging.
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:10.443]  We go ever closer to just high-tech slavery.
[02:35:12.808 --> 02:35:14.269]  I don't want to get into that anymore.
[02:35:14.289 --> 02:35:15.170]  Let's just go to calls.
[02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:16.411]  Ken and Mike and others.
[02:35:16.711 --> 02:35:18.012]  Ken in New York around the year.
[02:35:18.052 --> 02:35:18.473]  Go ahead.
[02:35:18.653 --> 02:35:19.614]  Yes, Alex.
[02:35:19.854 --> 02:35:24.457]  You just talked about the corruption and stuff and how the Patriot Act is aimed at us.
[02:35:25.278 --> 02:35:25.879]  That sort of thing?
[02:35:26.479 --> 02:35:27.240]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:39.149]  And back when Reagan died and everybody was boo-hooing what a great guy he was, I sent a letter to my local papers and we saved 14,000 terrorists in Beirut back in 82 with
[02:35:40.632 --> 02:35:44.434]  When the Israelis had Yasser trapped in Beirut.
[02:35:46.255 --> 02:35:46.975]  In Beirut.
[02:35:47.075 --> 02:35:53.719]  Well Yasser Arafat was a globalist and that's what Barry Hamish and other big writers from Jerusalem said.
[02:35:54.179 --> 02:35:56.640]  The Jewish groups are controlled, the Arab groups are controlled.
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:03.624]  A lot of times you've got real terrorists but they don't know that their boss's boss who's funding them is CIA.
[02:36:03.904 --> 02:36:04.124]  Yeah.
[02:36:04.844 --> 02:36:06.205]  And I just read again
[02:36:06.809 --> 02:36:23.601]  Well, I have to say about Ronald Reagan, I mean, he was just a social climber, and he was an actor, folks, and people buy that image of the guy in the cowboy hat, and he stood up against the evil commies.
[02:36:24.202 --> 02:36:27.244]  But Ronald Reagan is nothing compared to George Bush Sr.
[02:36:27.284 --> 02:36:29.105]  in evil, nothing compared to Bush.
[02:36:30.146 --> 02:36:31.867]  I mean, clearly Bush Sr.
[02:36:31.907 --> 02:36:33.989]  was involved in the assassination attempt on Reagan.
[02:36:35.308 --> 02:36:38.009]  And, uh, it's, it's, it's just amazing.
[02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:39.950]  You know, one more thing and then I'll let you go.
[02:36:40.311 --> 02:36:41.791]  You know what I called my last cat?
[02:36:43.312 --> 02:36:43.692]  Clinton.
[02:36:44.573 --> 02:36:47.874]  Because every time you use litter box it smelled like a Clinton speech.
[02:36:47.894 --> 02:36:51.536]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[02:36:51.796 --> 02:36:52.677]  Good to hear from you.
[02:36:53.877 --> 02:36:54.317]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:56.518]  Mike in Arizona, go ahead.
[02:36:56.538 --> 02:36:57.739]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:58.059 --> 02:37:03.602]  Earlier you were talking about a secret CIA report that somehow was available to you.
[02:37:04.887 --> 02:37:10.392]  That described a plan to really destroy this country.
[02:37:10.993 --> 02:37:12.414]  Do you remember where you saw that?
[02:37:12.494 --> 02:37:13.375]  Now be specific.
[02:37:15.677 --> 02:37:16.318]  What was I saying?
[02:37:16.898 --> 02:37:21.603]  You said there was a secret CIA plan.
[02:37:22.904 --> 02:37:24.545]  Oh no, it's not secret.
[02:37:24.585 --> 02:37:26.467]  It's here actually in the stack from yesterday.
[02:37:26.507 --> 02:37:28.909]  It was in all the big news wires.
[02:37:28.949 --> 02:37:30.511]  It was big news over the weekend.
[02:37:31.632 --> 02:37:36.409]  I think the headline was, I'll try to dig it out, America's got a rough ride coming in the future.
[02:37:37.159 --> 02:37:40.940]  And it was just talking about how we're going to be a second world nation.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.661]  It's not their plan to do it to us.
[02:37:43.441 --> 02:37:49.082]  It was actually a good report, being honest, that was secret and got leaked and is now public and they admit it's real.
[02:37:49.662 --> 02:37:58.605]  One of the internal reports, not one of the for public consumption reports, and it was saying that China's going to be preeminent along with Europe and that we're basically going in the toilet.
[02:37:58.865 --> 02:38:05.407]  But I have seen C-SPAN, you know, four or five years ago where the CFR's meeting was talking about how China's going to be preeminent.
[02:38:07.617 --> 02:38:11.879]  I think there's even programs you can buy from C-SPAN called, you know, China's Preeminence in 2020.
[02:38:12.639 --> 02:38:15.520]  But, yeah, no, that was all over the news.
[02:38:15.921 --> 02:38:18.022]  So that was on your website yesterday?
[02:38:18.702 --> 02:38:19.062]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:19.602 --> 02:38:26.945]  In fact, I will try to... I've got yesterday's news in a stack about six inches tall, but I'll flip through it during a break.
[02:38:27.646 --> 02:38:30.327]  In fact, why don't you go ahead and talk and I'll look for it.
[02:38:30.727 --> 02:38:33.568]  Yeah, the other question I had was about Abu Ghraib.
[02:38:35.342 --> 02:38:48.733]  That certainly seems to fit in with the P-2-O-G strategy, as far as releasing this kind of damaging information or evidence, which would in turn inflame the Arab world.
[02:38:50.375 --> 02:38:52.817]  Do you remember how Abu Ghraib came to light?
[02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:58.742]  Yes, CBS leaked it, and I have thousands of photos, thousands!
[02:38:59.481 --> 02:39:02.102]  That Congress was able to see, but they decided what to release.
[02:39:02.362 --> 02:39:11.325]  They released the lightest photos, and then had a debate about that, but it was still enough to outrage people overseas, but enough to condition us that it's okay here domestically.
[02:39:12.225 --> 02:39:14.866]  Okay, so it was, it did start with CBS.
[02:39:15.086 --> 02:39:15.326]  Yes.
[02:39:16.167 --> 02:39:19.048]  Well, that's fitting, isn't it?
[02:39:19.108 --> 02:39:19.208]  Okay.
[02:39:19.228 --> 02:39:21.769]  Yeah, it was founded by a former CIA director.
[02:39:22.049 --> 02:39:22.289]  Right.
[02:39:22.869 --> 02:39:28.791]  Yeah, with strong ties back to London, City of London, and the Rothschild Group.
[02:39:30.071 --> 02:39:31.231]  Very nice people, aren't they?
[02:39:31.471 --> 02:39:31.931]  Yes, indeed.
[02:39:33.052 --> 02:39:33.392]  Alrighty.
[02:39:33.452 --> 02:39:34.052]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:39:34.152 --> 02:39:34.952]  Well, now keep going.
[02:39:34.972 --> 02:39:35.992]  I'm looking for the article.
[02:39:36.493 --> 02:39:38.933]  What do you think about torture?
[02:39:38.953 --> 02:39:40.313]  How they're trying to legitimize torture?
[02:39:41.274 --> 02:39:48.956]  Yeah, actually, I've been trying to dig up some articles here to... I wanted to write something myself about this torture business.
[02:39:49.716 --> 02:39:54.757]  I don't think Americans know exactly how bad, how evil this stuff is.
[02:39:55.797 --> 02:39:59.078]  And, you know, if nothing else, they should ponder
[02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:02.572]  What happens when all this comes home to this country?
[02:40:02.592 --> 02:40:08.676]  I mean, what you do to the other guy, what our government does to them eventually, is going to come home to roost here.
[02:40:08.696 --> 02:40:15.221]  And they're just sharpening up their fangs, I'm afraid, on other nation's citizens.
[02:40:16.402 --> 02:40:21.826]  They're going to be very well versed in it by the time they start practicing it on American citizens.
[02:40:22.406 --> 02:40:24.848]  Well, that's the way empires have always been.
[02:40:24.928 --> 02:40:28.671]  What a nation does to others happens at home, in many cases, even worse.
[02:40:29.719 --> 02:40:33.321]  These are just basic laws of society.
[02:40:33.741 --> 02:40:45.008]  Yeah, and it's really frustrating for me as a Christian to look at other Christians who just go along with this insanity and don't object.
[02:40:46.088 --> 02:40:50.391]  Somehow, I guess they've relegated the Arab world or Muslims to
[02:40:51.226 --> 02:40:57.529]  Do second-class... Well, sir, you must not be listening to talk radio, because I don't watch a lot of TV, but I listen to a lot of talk radio driving around.
[02:40:57.930 --> 02:41:03.593]  I mean, I don't tune in for more than an hour when I'm driving, but I don't hear them sub-human dogs, animals, kill them.
[02:41:03.993 --> 02:41:04.393]  I know, I know.
[02:41:04.433 --> 02:41:07.415]  You listen to Michael Savage, and you hear that constantly, and...
[02:41:08.833 --> 02:41:13.115]  Tammy Bruce and these people, not to mention Colter.
[02:41:13.255 --> 02:41:20.279]  Another thing I've noticed is it seems to me like people, a lot of them aren't Jewish, but some of them are Jewish.
[02:41:20.639 --> 02:41:22.980]  You hear Jewish people calling Arabs subhuman.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.241]  I've actually heard that.
[02:41:24.801 --> 02:41:26.502]  That is really despicable.
[02:41:26.922 --> 02:41:35.727]  Yeah, a friend of mine, about two years ago, believe it or not, he took a trip over to Gaza and also got on a bus and toured around Israel.
[02:41:36.451 --> 02:41:42.314]  And that was one of the commonest things he heard from Israelis when he mentioned that he was going to Gaza.
[02:41:42.334 --> 02:41:47.457]  He was staying at an old Baptist mission there.
[02:41:47.477 --> 02:41:54.100]  They would say, why in the world do you want to be around those animals, those pigs?
[02:41:54.781 --> 02:41:56.902]  They just had the vilest terms for those people.
[02:41:58.325 --> 02:42:01.506]  Well, the Arabs have those names for them, too.
[02:42:01.766 --> 02:42:03.926]  I mean, that's tribal warfare.
[02:42:04.886 --> 02:42:07.427]  But let's just pull back from this.
[02:42:08.507 --> 02:42:08.867]  Alright?
[02:42:08.987 --> 02:42:10.508]  I mean, Abraham goes back.
[02:42:10.568 --> 02:42:21.790]  Both groups split from Abraham, and they've done genetic tests on the three different genetic strains of Jews out there.
[02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:24.110]  And then, of course, there's Co-Minglin and all those groups.
[02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:26.771]  But Jews that really do originally come from the Middle East.
[02:42:27.432 --> 02:42:28.833]  I mean, you know, you see them in Israel.
[02:42:28.873 --> 02:42:29.513]  They're running around.
[02:42:29.533 --> 02:42:30.694]  They look just like the Arabs.
[02:42:31.314 --> 02:42:32.395]  And they've done genetic tests.
[02:42:32.415 --> 02:42:33.355]  It's the same people!
[02:42:34.516 --> 02:42:38.458]  And it goes back to, you know, to these tribes fighting with each other.
[02:42:38.798 --> 02:42:40.879]  And it's never going to stop.
[02:42:41.379 --> 02:42:45.442]  Because the Arab countries... Excuse me.
[02:42:46.242 --> 02:42:47.883]  The Arab countries like
[02:42:49.848 --> 02:43:04.217]  Egypt and others like getting the millions and millions off the heightened alert and then other Arab countries are always pushing the Palestinians and then big Jewish interest over there with weapon sales and those that, you know, you can't speak out against the government in Israel, you can't put a lot of stuff on the news.
[02:43:04.577 --> 02:43:06.938]  The government likes having that control over Jews as well!
[02:43:07.279 --> 02:43:10.120]  So both sides have a stake in keeping it going.
[02:43:10.821 --> 02:43:11.481]  Absolutely.
[02:43:11.881 --> 02:43:17.024]  But as far as, you know, what kind of Jews are present in Israel, I mean, you've got the two main
[02:43:18.769 --> 02:43:24.114]  Two main branches of Jewry, which is the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.
[02:43:24.294 --> 02:43:28.978]  A lot of the Sephardim actually trace their lineage to the Berber tribes of Northern Africa.
[02:43:29.159 --> 02:43:41.450]  They kind of look like Arabs, but I don't think any of these people, frankly, can... We had a sample of Father Abram's cells.
[02:43:42.288 --> 02:43:46.671]  I don't think any of these people would be able to trace their lineage directly to Abraham.
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.140]  You know, huge restriction.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:15.661]  Yeah, that was the big influx, yeah.
[02:44:15.781 --> 02:44:16.401]  Big kill-off.
[02:44:17.281 --> 02:44:24.023]  Yeah, roughly half the population died, and so then a lot of people from the Mediterranean filled in the gaps in Western Europe.
[02:44:24.303 --> 02:44:24.463]  Right.
[02:44:24.743 --> 02:44:38.226]  But the Ashkenazi, which are the predominant branch of Jewry throughout the world, probably these 80-90% are of Southern, you know, they're basically a Turkish stock.
[02:44:40.799 --> 02:44:46.701]  Go back to Southern Russia, the area of Eastern Poland today, and they are non-Semitic people.
[02:44:47.121 --> 02:44:49.202]  Well, the Queen of England claims to be Jewish.
[02:44:49.222 --> 02:44:49.762]  Did you know that?
[02:44:50.602 --> 02:44:55.884]  Yeah, well, I have a little Jewish blood in me too, but I don't call myself a Jew and I don't consider myself one.
[02:44:56.144 --> 02:45:05.287]  Yeah, well, the point I was making is that the Queen of England, they're coronated on the supposed stone where Abraham was going to kill his son for the sacrifice.
[02:45:05.307 --> 02:45:05.767]  Did you know that?
[02:45:06.644 --> 02:45:06.924]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:07.444 --> 02:45:10.225]  I mean, they think they're the... and it's weird.
[02:45:10.265 --> 02:45:22.129]  It's like, with that British Israelism then, that ties into the Nazis, and Hitler, if you really read the real historical books, he was like, we're the true Jews and we're gonna go kill... I mean, it just... it goes on and on.
[02:45:22.649 --> 02:45:29.712]  It's just... That's what's good about the New Testament, is it's the New Covenant, and we just all need to love God and get along with each other.
[02:45:29.752 --> 02:45:30.272]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:31.121 --> 02:45:31.822]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:31.862 --> 02:45:33.583]  Very interesting discussion there.
[02:45:33.603 --> 02:45:35.584]  Let's take one more call and I'm going to cover some final news.
[02:45:35.804 --> 02:45:36.965]  Who's up next in order here?
[02:45:38.726 --> 02:45:39.867]  Jean in Pennsylvania.
[02:45:39.887 --> 02:45:40.307]  Go ahead.
[02:45:40.327 --> 02:45:41.348]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:41.488 --> 02:45:45.450]  I just wanted to tell you I get the Erie, Pennsylvania paper.
[02:45:46.071 --> 02:45:46.471]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:45:46.711 --> 02:45:50.894]  Saturday they have this big spread of wing and a prayer.
[02:45:51.214 --> 02:45:53.936]  Migrant space plays role in treacherous journey.
[02:45:54.336 --> 02:45:59.820]  And they're telling you all about how they pray and all the altars and all this before they sneak in.
[02:46:00.512 --> 02:46:11.158]  And then there's a, about a four page, four inch thing that says if you want to help, and then they give all these organizations that are helping stash these people in the states.
[02:46:12.679 --> 02:46:15.801]  Say that, maybe I'm dumb, but explain what you're talking about.
[02:46:16.201 --> 02:46:23.566]  They have an article about the faith and prayer, their journey in the United States illegally.
[02:46:23.993 --> 02:46:40.044]  And then they have an article that tells you where you can... Listen, the big foundations that want to wreck this country have policy reports that are public about how to sell well-meaning Christians on being part of the illegal alien invasion and aiding and abetting all this.
[02:46:40.364 --> 02:46:51.231]  Well, it's a four-column thing on the front page of the third section, and it's a Saturday paper that tells you, it's the face page that's telling you how
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:55.541]  I guess all us good Christians are supposed to help them illegally come in.
[02:46:56.022 --> 02:46:56.822]  Well, that's right.
[02:46:57.062 --> 02:46:57.602]  You are.
[02:46:58.442 --> 02:47:01.664]  And then it gives you four websites that you can help donate.
[02:47:03.584 --> 02:47:04.745]  I just get so mad.
[02:47:05.165 --> 02:47:12.168]  I'm not regular at speaking or writing a letter, but I'm almost tempted to say, heck with the Erie paper.
[02:47:14.368 --> 02:47:15.009]  It's incredible.
[02:47:15.089 --> 02:47:16.869]  Look at the Austin paper last Friday.
[02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:21.071]  It showed Wiccan witches, Baptist preachers, Catholics,
[02:47:21.801 --> 02:47:29.207]  Buddhists, Jews, Rabbis, all linking hands in a circle and praying to each of their gods.
[02:47:30.248 --> 02:47:32.769]  I mean, it doesn't get any more blasphemous than that.
[02:47:33.730 --> 02:47:36.652]  And that's what the UN is promoting, is this one world religion.
[02:47:38.134 --> 02:47:39.194]  I agree with you, sir.
[02:47:39.214 --> 02:47:40.655]  I mean, it was unbelievable.
[02:47:40.756 --> 02:47:41.816]  Front page of the paper.
[02:47:42.177 --> 02:47:44.719]  I worry about you getting upset because I know how upset I get.
[02:47:46.434 --> 02:47:48.835]  Look, if you're not upset, you're not paying attention.
[02:47:49.556 --> 02:47:52.297]  What's the bumper sticker if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention?
[02:47:52.497 --> 02:47:56.720]  But there's so many people that don't have an inkling what's going on.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:59.641]  Well, you know, the football crew.
[02:47:59.661 --> 02:48:04.704]  I like football, but I know what's going on in the world, too.
[02:48:04.724 --> 02:48:10.267]  And our tool and die industry here has been going down, down, down.
[02:48:11.188 --> 02:48:14.249]  And you see more signs of homes for sale.
[02:48:15.652 --> 02:48:18.194]  Just worry about what's really going to come of these people.
[02:48:18.334 --> 02:48:19.515]  Oh, the economy's great!
[02:48:19.535 --> 02:48:20.435]  The news said so!
[02:48:20.455 --> 02:48:22.296]  Well... They don't lie!
[02:48:22.316 --> 02:48:25.578]  I know, and the whole thing's happening with Walmart, too.
[02:48:25.598 --> 02:48:27.740]  We've got a big Walmart in all the little towns.
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:28.820]  Stores are dying.
[02:48:29.201 --> 02:48:31.582]  Well, they've got signs saying Made in America on the walls.
[02:48:31.602 --> 02:48:33.243]  It doesn't matter if nothing there is made in America.
[02:48:33.523 --> 02:48:35.425]  They've got a sign up on the wall saying Made in America.
[02:48:35.445 --> 02:48:37.506]  Even though the sign was printed in China.
[02:48:37.966 --> 02:48:38.407]  Come on!
[02:48:39.087 --> 02:48:41.048]  Just stick your head in the sand and it'll all go away, dear.
[02:48:41.068 --> 02:48:42.269]  Thanks for calling.

[02:48:54.817 --> 02:48:59.180]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[02:51:48.271 --> 02:51:54.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.893 --> 02:51:57.854]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:01.595 --> 02:52:03.396]  I want folks to keep something in mind.
[02:52:03.416 --> 02:52:08.978]  The Pentagon came out two years ago and said, we're going to lie to you, plant fake news stories for our own good.
[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:14.874]  And then see, as you find out about fake news stories, they go, well, it's just a policy to fight the enemy.
[02:52:14.954 --> 02:52:15.874]  Lying's good!
[02:52:16.195 --> 02:52:17.616]  Lying to you is good!
[02:52:18.436 --> 02:52:20.018]  You're not for Al Qaeda, are you?
[02:52:20.038 --> 02:52:34.989]  So I dug up this old New York Times article, Pentagon Ways Use of Deception in a Broad Area, and it gets off into it, and all these articles about, oh, I heard Limbaugh a couple days ago going, look at Howard Dean!
[02:52:35.610 --> 02:52:38.592]  He paid internet bloggers to go out and say positive things about him.
[02:52:39.545 --> 02:52:43.706]  Which is dishonest, and disreputable, and sneaky, but nothing compared.
[02:52:44.427 --> 02:52:47.127]  That was bad Limbaugh said, but I just so happened to hear him the day before that.
[02:52:47.568 --> 02:52:49.188]  Three years around here, I hear a little bit of it.
[02:52:50.148 --> 02:52:53.469]  Talking about, it's no big deal, Armstrong Williams.
[02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:55.570]  $240,000 to go out and propagandize.
[02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:58.691]  See, I mean, it's just like a daily dose.
[02:52:59.191 --> 02:53:07.354]  So the new order gets their agenda through on the right, they get it through on the left, the left can't see the corruption of the left, the right can't see the corruption of the right, and there's no real difference.
[02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:10.011]  It's so important to understand that.
[02:53:12.872 --> 02:53:20.235]  It's a very, very, very sad thing to see this type of garbage happening.
[02:53:20.555 --> 02:53:22.475]  Another article here is out of AFP.
[02:53:22.536 --> 02:53:24.916]  Globalization to bring age of uncertainty, U.S.
[02:53:24.956 --> 02:53:25.757]  intelligence warns.
[02:53:26.137 --> 02:53:28.978]  It says many new al-Qaeda type groups are going to pop up.
[02:53:30.043 --> 02:53:31.603]  And officials, instead of more than 1,000 U.S.
[02:53:31.643 --> 02:53:38.364]  and foreign experts, were consulted and more than 30 conferences were held around the world to give the analysis a global dimension.
[02:53:39.645 --> 02:53:56.367]  And it says that in the next 15 years, again by 2020, that China's gross national product will be second only to that of the United States, and India will have outtaken, overtaken most of European economies.
[02:53:56.427 --> 02:53:59.388]  Both countries are well positioned to become technology leaders, it said.
[02:54:00.583 --> 02:54:03.265]  And all Americans know how to do is drink beer and praise football.
[02:54:04.826 --> 02:54:12.731]  We have to foresee a more pervasive sense of insecurity and it goes into the radical changes in our standard of living and the rest of it.
[02:54:13.091 --> 02:54:14.752]  Just type this into a search engine and you'll get it.
[02:54:15.112 --> 02:54:18.314]  Globalization to bring age of uncertainty, U.S.
[02:54:18.354 --> 02:54:19.595]  intelligence warns.
[02:54:21.156 --> 02:54:25.679]  That was from actually last Friday, AFP, or Agency French Press.
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:27.760]  We're flat out of time.
[02:54:28.041 --> 02:54:30.122]  The last minute and a half I got here left.
[02:54:30.939 --> 02:54:42.904]  I would, again, encourage all of you tuning in, all of you who procrastinated, all of you who haven't taken action, to get fully educated about the New World Order, and to start educating people, to get involved.
[02:54:43.424 --> 02:54:45.165]  And a great way to do it is my films.
[02:54:45.185 --> 02:54:54.789]  I also carry, I don't know, like seven or eight other great documentary films, a bunch of books on tape about the New World Order on CD and cassette, a great gift to give people.
[02:54:55.706 --> 02:54:58.168]  Because that's something they can listen to in the car.
[02:54:58.528 --> 02:54:59.629]  People love books on tape.
[02:54:59.909 --> 02:55:00.529]  I know I do.
[02:55:01.490 --> 02:55:02.891]  Pro-Second Amendment t-shirts.
[02:55:02.971 --> 02:55:04.112]  You'll call it ultra-liberal.
[02:55:04.172 --> 02:55:04.712]  Okay, fine.
[02:55:06.044 --> 02:55:10.666]  I know the new conservatism says guns are bad, but I have a pro-second-amendment t-shirt, attorney-in-response-team t-shirt.
[02:55:10.966 --> 02:55:12.667]  Buy bumper stickers, we sell them at cost.
[02:55:12.927 --> 02:55:14.668]  Just pay for the shipping and send you ten of them out.
[02:55:15.189 --> 02:55:26.014]  Go to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the secure, safe online shopping cart, watch free clips of the films, or call toll-free to ask about all the different titles and different specials.
[02:55:26.514 --> 02:55:27.194]  Give them a call.
[02:55:27.234 --> 02:55:28.115]  No obligation to buy.
[02:55:28.135 --> 02:55:28.735]  Just give them a call.
[02:55:28.755 --> 02:55:28.815]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:28.835 --> 02:55:29.836]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:55:29.876 --> 02:55:33.918]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:55:33.998 --> 02:55:36.559]  Don't count on somebody else to do it.
[02:55:36.579 --> 02:55:42.281]  And by getting the videos, you also support our work here if you believe in what we're doing.
[02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:56.912]  Triple 8, 253-3139.
[02:55:57.593 --> 02:56:00.396]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:00.436 --> 02:56:01.257]  Get a membership there.
[02:56:01.277 --> 02:56:04.742]  15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:56:04.882 --> 02:56:07.986]  All my films, books, audio interviews.
[02:56:08.146 --> 02:56:09.688]  It's crazy how much is there.
[02:56:10.108 --> 02:56:10.769]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:19.902]  Remember, evil will only be stopped when you stand up against it, and when you get involved, and denying its existence only empowers it.
[02:56:20.282 --> 02:56:30.844]  If you love your family, if you love decency and honor and beauty and creativity, then you better stand up and join us in history in the fight for humanity against dehumanization.
[02:56:31.204 --> 02:56:32.944]  God bless you all!
