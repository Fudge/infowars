[00:00:05.847 --> 00:00:06.488]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:08.188]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.009]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.489]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.471]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:22.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:32.675]  Well, it feels like a Monday.
[00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.364]  But as you know well, it is Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day.
[00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:40.506]  May 31st, 2005.
[00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:47.852]  We'll be live for the next 2 hours and 59 minutes, 15 seconds.
[00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:51.375]  And he's scheduled to come on.
[00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.217]  Been working on this for several weeks.
[00:00:55.318 --> 00:01:00.963]  In 30 minutes, George Galloway, the head of the Respect Party, the Member of Parliament, who
[00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:16.371]  grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat and exposed the neocons as a bunch of forging criminal liars when it came to the Iraq oil food program which they themselves were scamming, not Mr. Galloway or his party.
[00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:24.855]  So we're scheduled to have that in about thirty minutes and I want to play a few minutes of his speech before Mr. Galloway joins us.
[00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:25.656]  That's been posted
[00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:35.039]  Of course for about three or four weeks on InfoWars.com and on PrisonPlanet.com so you can't miss it there on the site.
[00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:41.736]  In the third hour, we have the head of the Canadian Hemophiliac Society coming on.
[00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:56.568]  Big BBC report admitting that the Red Cross knowingly was trafficking in blood, infected with HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C, and many other horrible pathogens, viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[00:01:56.648 --> 00:02:01.773]  And this goes back to the Hemophiliac Society, and Bill Clinton was still in office being robbed
[00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:13.696]  Being raided the same night that the doctor in Little Rock had exposed them taking the blood from the prisoners that they knew had HIV and Hepatitis and selling it.
[00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:24.398]  He got firebombed the same night the Hemophiliac Society got robbed all the files and computers that had anything in them to do with the blood case.
[00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.153]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.435]  Just to show you the mindset of these people.
[00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:36.556]  What we're dealing with.
[00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:46.503]  How cavalier they are towards spreading death and destruction in a wanton, really relished fashion.
[00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:48.945]  They don't just do it in a cavalier fashion.
[00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:56.290]  They enjoy doing it while posing and telling you what saviors they are for you and your family.
[00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.131]  It's thoroughly disgusting.
[00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.952]  Coming up, French non-vote puts EU in turmoil.
[00:03:02.972 --> 00:03:05.713]  We reported last week that polls show they would fail.
[00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:17.719]  They did fail, but the EU says they're just going to go ahead and enforce their arbitrary centralized system without the yes vote for merging the EU's power in France.
[00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.201]  The Netherlands is set to begin pulling out of the EU.
[00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.935]  This has really got the globalists panicking and very, very upset.
[00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.177]  French voters clear.
[00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:38.764]  No to the EU constitution has left European leaders struggling to define the way forward.
[00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:39.265]  Yes.
[00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.628]  Again, I already mentioned this, but here's the headline.
[00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:47.231]  Canadian Red Cross use HIV blood knowingly.
[00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.334]  Iraq bombers hit security forces.
[00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:58.354]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad, that is push, Saddam Hussein into war.
[00:03:58.374 --> 00:04:06.900]  RFID chips injected into Barcelona ravers and more news on this coming out as the microchipping spreads.
[00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:17.428]  The perils of smoking are discussed at a World No Tobacco Day as they push for world tax against tobacco products.
[00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.839]  U.S.
[00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.722]  may ask for Canadian domestic passport list.
[00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:22.963]  Expanding that database.
[00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:30.610]  There's just masses and masses of news coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.913]  And of course, your phone calls today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.962]  The website's updated for you daily, multiple times daily.

[00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:52.906]  Check them out today.
[00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:57.807]  More real talk radio, issues of real significance, straight ahead.
[00:04:58.208 --> 00:04:59.508]  So, please stay with us.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.842]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:06.125]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:10.149]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.454]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:18.578]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:20.520]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.002]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:28.785]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:31.967]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:35.009]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.614]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:45.937]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.338 --> 00:05:47.719]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.100]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.442]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:52.703]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:09.277]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.498 --> 00:06:20.788]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:20.988 --> 00:06:23.611]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:30.438]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.480]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.707]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:44.613]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:48.854]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:50.295]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:03.243]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:07.346]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:08.487]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.907 --> 00:07:13.029]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:17.452]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:22.695]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:26.678]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.858 --> 00:07:32.202]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:35.204]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:36.385]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:50.976]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:08.209]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:10.049]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.550]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.191]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:17.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.013 --> 00:08:22.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:34.561]  Well, the last six months, we've had the number three man of the CIA, Buzi Prangar, tell the Times of London
[00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:42.649]  That he's not concerned about capturing Bin Laden, that capturing Bin Laden would be very dangerous and would help Al Qaeda.
[00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.551]  We know Bin Laden is CIA.
[00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:51.335]  We know what FBI agent Robert Wright and Larry Klayman and others told us at the National Press Club three years ago.
[00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:54.838]  We've been ordered under national security to not tell you what we know.
[00:08:54.858 --> 00:09:03.003]  All we can say is, here is the letter threatening to arrest us, and we can tell you the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:10.645]  That's Larry Klayman with Robert Wright, a big six-foot-four man, crying because he wanted to protect this country.
[00:09:11.386 --> 00:09:16.370]  So blown away that he was being threatened with arrest that day if he told you what he knows.
[00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:23.815]  Well, we know what he knows, and David Shippers had told us most of it months before that when he came on this broadcast a week after 9-11.
[00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.699]  But you see how I get off the beaten path here.
[00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:32.399]  The bottom line is the government protects Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.500]  Al-Qaeda is the pretext they need to scare us into submission.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:46.542]  Usually when they bust an Al-Qaeda member it turns out that it was some innocent person or they were CIA and they were staging their arrest to quote protect their identity.
[00:09:48.763 --> 00:09:51.823]  And then they'll still use that person's name years later.
[00:09:52.323 --> 00:09:55.884]  Oh this top Al-Qaeda person's out killing people or we just killed him.
[00:09:56.795 --> 00:10:01.716]  Well, wait, I have an article from three years ago, two years ago, where you say he was CIA and you were protecting him.
[00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:04.597]  I mean, that's how in your face they are.
[00:10:05.677 --> 00:10:20.960]  There were several big British newspapers, very prestigious and respected, that reported that months before 9-11, this is before 9-11, they reported that British diplomats were in Pakistan on the Afghan border and that bin Laden was there being guarded by U.S.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.880]  Special Forces.
[00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.301]  I mean, that was before 9-11, and then
[00:10:26.855 --> 00:10:42.985]  Months after 9-11 with the takeover of Afghanistan, it turns out that they just arrested the conscripts that were in the front lines, and our government did, and that the Arab fighters behind them in the lines were loaded onto helicopters and C-130s by the U.S.
[00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:46.167]  government and flown out to safety in Afghanistan.
[00:10:47.068 --> 00:10:49.089]  They were CIA assets!
[00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:54.128]  And then Bush, remember for two years, he said, we're going to get bin Laden.
[00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:56.289]  Number one job, kill bin Laden.
[00:10:56.309 --> 00:10:57.309]  We're going to get bin Laden.
[00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:02.371]  Then they were getting ready to invade Iraq and they said, don't worry about bin Laden anymore.
[00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:03.731]  The focus is Saddam.
[00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:04.272]  He did it.
[00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:08.033]  And then now it's turned into Bush saying, hey, I'm not worried about bin Laden.
[00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:09.153]  I don't care where he is.
[00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:10.434]  We're not after him.
[00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:11.514]  We have those clips.
[00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:12.034]  We've played them.
[00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:13.615]  You've probably seen them on TV.
[00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:16.516]  Then later Bush said, I never said we didn't want to capture bin Laden.
[00:11:17.324 --> 00:11:18.364]  That's an urban legend!
[00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:20.025]  And then they play the clip of Bush saying it.
[00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:23.186]  They've had a lot of fun with that on the Jon Stewart Show.
[00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:25.567]  They're on Comedy Central.
[00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:28.028]  Not the Jon Stewart Show.
[00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:30.609]  It's the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
[00:11:31.489 --> 00:11:32.650]  Mesopotamia.
[00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.131]  But all of that with this backdrop.
[00:11:37.352 --> 00:11:37.732]  U.S.
[00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:40.313]  to widen focus against extremism.
[00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:46.535]  This is the major Bilderberg Group paper and we got internal sources telling us they want to go after patriots.
[00:11:47.422 --> 00:11:49.523]  They're very angry with patriots in America.
[00:11:50.443 --> 00:12:07.109]  The Bush administration has launched a high-level review of its efforts to battle terrorism and aimed at moving away from a policy that has stressed efforts to capture or kill some of the Latin and Al-Qaeda leaders and towards what an official called a broader strategy against violent extremism.
[00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.237]  And, uh, guess who's in here?
[00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:13.721]  Not just the Muslims, but those evil Christian conservatives, those evil patriots.
[00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.283]  Why, they're probably working with Bin Laden.
[00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:22.207]  And so, by fighting extremism, which... I've been called an extremist for talking about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:12:23.588 --> 00:12:24.429]  A world government.
[00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:25.650]  You know, you're an evil terrorist.
[00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.711]  So, we see them widening that.
[00:12:28.872 --> 00:12:30.894]  Another headline here, Troops on the Border.
[00:12:30.954 --> 00:12:34.657]  Minutemen Project showed how effective eyes can be on the border.
[00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:42.978]  From cakewalk to bloodbath, Bush opts for civil war in Iraq as things get more and more serious.
[00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:54.112]  Now we're learning that the RAF, the Royal Air Force in England, bombed Iraq for years trying to get Saddam to launch an attack on someone, which he never did.
[00:12:56.187 --> 00:13:00.429]  So, there they are, trying to manufacture terrorism yet again.
[00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.710]  And here's another one, New York Times.
[00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.592]  Trying to thwart possible terrorists quickly, FBI agents are often playing terrorists.
[00:13:08.233 --> 00:13:09.093]  Playing them, yes.
[00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:13.535]  And when they get caught carrying out terror attacks, oh no, it was just a sting gone bad.
[00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:15.956]  That's why we're funding and training all the terrorists.
[00:13:16.637 --> 00:13:19.018]  Oh no, we were just trying to stop them.
[00:13:19.648 --> 00:13:23.430]  And a really scary article here, documented proof of Stasi-like recruitment.
[00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.071]  We've got one of these letters going out around the U.S.
[00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.712]  and England, getting neighbors to be tattletales.
[00:13:29.512 --> 00:13:33.534]  And now all crime is terrorism, so it says, fight the terrorists, tattle on your neighbor.
[00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:35.414]  Are they smoking marijuana?
[00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.756]  This is the type of news I have here in front of me.
[00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.357]  I hope he's coming on.
[00:13:41.417 --> 00:13:44.518]  I mean, it's a big catch and we're going to be honored to have him.
[00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:58.793]  George Galloway, the Member of Parliament who turned the tables on the neocons in the Senate and their slanderous, larcenous attacks on him, is scheduled to be joining us in about 15-16 minutes, so don't want to miss that.
[00:14:02.714 --> 00:14:09.335]  And coming up later, the government and others knowingly making sure that HIV and hepatitis blood went out to millions of people.
[00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:21.997]  More and more documents in hindsight coming out documenting what this audience already knew, but we're going to have the head of the Canadian Hemophiliac Society on the broadcast to discuss it.
[00:14:23.298 --> 00:14:24.558]  There is some good news.
[00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:30.599]  National ID cards, they've tried to pass them for the sixth time in England in the last decade and failed.
[00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:36.938]  They don't have those special electronic voting machines, and as soon as they get those, everyone will love what's happening.
[00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.579]  Just like we do here now.
[00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:42.180]  But, oh, it doesn't matter if 90% of us are against something in a poll.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.342]  90 plus percent, magically, the machines always come through.
[00:14:47.602 --> 00:14:54.305]  In areas where the machines aren't in, magically, the government's programs fail, but magically, where they do have the machines, they get everything they want.
[00:14:55.396 --> 00:15:00.118]  But it's on the rocks there, and the government's still trying to pass it yet again.
[00:15:00.258 --> 00:15:02.600]  When you first don't succeed, try, try again.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.900]  We've got to have that same attitude.
[00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:10.203]  When it comes to defending liberty and freedom, French non-puts-EU-in-turmoil.
[00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:14.025]  French voters clear no to the EU Constitution.
[00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:17.547]  It's left European leaders struggling to define the way forward.
[00:15:17.907 --> 00:15:23.170]  European Commission President, José Manuel Barçaro, said there was
[00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:30.018]  Now, a very serious problem, that's the quote, and there was no willingness to reopen negotiations.
[00:15:30.859 --> 00:15:38.284]  In the French referendum, almost 55% of people voted no, with 45% in favor, turnout was high, almost 70%.
[00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:46.090]  Wish we could get 70% turnout here, but people instinctively know, most elections are now frauds.
[00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.571]  Sorry to have to report that to you.
[00:15:48.553 --> 00:15:52.196]  It, in a severe, perhaps fatal blow, I love it!
[00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:53.777]  Dance on that grave!
[00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:56.879]  This sucker's a body snatcher, an undead.
[00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:57.839]  It doesn't die.
[00:15:57.859 --> 00:15:58.580]  We gotta keep fighting.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.261]  Gotta cut it up in little pieces.
[00:16:01.382 --> 00:16:02.843]  And scatter it to the four winds.
[00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:10.488]  It is a severe, perhaps fatal blow to the EU Constitution, which needs to be ratified by all 25 member states.
[00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:21.876]  French President Jacques Chirac accepted the vote's sovereign decision on Sunday but said it created a difficult context for the difference of our interests.
[00:16:21.956 --> 00:16:26.078]  In Europe he has campaigned hard for a yes vote.
[00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:35.582]  The next big test comes in the Netherlands on Wednesday when the Dutch vote in a referendum and the no camp has a clear lead in opinion polls.
[00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:49.695]  UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who lost most of the seats for his party but is still in office, whose government will take over the EU Presidency on July 1st, called for a time of reflection.
[00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:55.457]  France's rejection of the Constitution raised profound questions about Europe's future, he said.
[00:16:55.937 --> 00:16:56.997]  Winners and losers.
[00:16:57.057 --> 00:17:02.619]  The BBC's World Affairs Analyst, Paul Reynolds, says there is no plan B for the EU, no clear way forward.
[00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:05.820]  Funny, I'm reading here where they're saying they're just going to start implementing the
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.481]  You see, governments are endorsing it, not the people.
[00:17:08.521 --> 00:17:16.382]  European Union Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solano insisted that the EU's international role must not suffer and warned Europeans against entering a zone of paralysis psychologically.
[00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:41.798]  No, they would put themselves under paralysis of advocating, giving up all of their freedoms.
[00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.538]  And that's what the EU Constitution did.
[00:17:43.978 --> 00:17:48.940]  Basically set up an even greater police state in Europe, where most basic rights have already been torn away.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:18:02.664]  The President of the European Parliament, José Porel, also put a brave face on the result, saying, I think we have to continue asking the other countries, and we should not stop the process of ratification.
[00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:07.789]  In his televised addresses, Mr. Ciroc said voters had registered their frustrations.
[00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:15.692]  He said he would take the decision on the future of the center-right government in the coming days, hinting at a possible reshuffle.
[00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:17.132]  Yes.
[00:18:17.772 --> 00:18:23.595]  Trying to pay off some more of the politicians in a parliamentary power-sharing agreement to get people to go along.
[00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:29.297]  This is wonderful news, and again, the national ID cards shot down yet again in England, and
[00:18:30.168 --> 00:18:33.669]  The polls are over 80% against it and the government just keeps trying to pass it.
[00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.651]  But here they're more crafty.
[00:18:37.671 --> 00:18:39.391]  They don't call it a national ID card.
[00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.132]  They call it a real ID card or a security feature.
[00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:47.634]  Which actually does nothing to stop illegals and everything to put us all into these huge databases.
[00:18:48.614 --> 00:18:50.975]  So here in America they don't allow us to vote on it.
[00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:52.115]  They're not honest about it.
[00:18:53.936 --> 00:18:58.137]  And I was on a radio show this morning and they were going, can we stop the national ID card?
[00:18:58.177 --> 00:18:59.758]  They didn't know it had already been passed.
[00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:01.723]  Two different versions of it!
[00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:10.227]  You know, it's like they laid the foundation in December of last year and a couple weeks ago passed the building of the entire structure on steroids.
[00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:14.409]  But, again, there's a lot of good news today.
[00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:15.830]  We're in this fight.
[00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:16.690]  We're in this bout.
[00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.871]  We've got a chance to win it.
[00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:22.593]  But we've got to have recall elections on paper ballots of the electronic voting machines.
[00:19:22.613 --> 00:19:25.134]  And I keep throwing that idea out there.
[00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.075]  That's the key.
[00:19:26.215 --> 00:19:28.616]  A recall of the ballot machines.
[00:19:29.696 --> 00:19:31.277]  We've got to have, or it's over!
[00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:50.443]  Six plus billion dollars that Chuckie Schumer and George Bush wrote up together, Bush administration and Schumer, and Hillary spearheaded it, and that six billion bucks in the last four years has been used to put in, it's over 35% now, the country has these machines that are total frauds, and soon it's going to be over!
[00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:52.963]  Unless we stop it now!
[00:19:54.024 --> 00:19:57.505]  There are a bunch of states that are pulling out, that's exciting, what, seven states right now?
[00:19:58.232 --> 00:19:59.582]  Make sure your state does it too.
[00:19:59.602 --> 00:19:59.945]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.261]  Terrorism!
[00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.161]  Terrorism!
[00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:09.305]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:11.186]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:13.907]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.287 --> 00:20:28.856]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:29.216]  government.
[00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:31.117]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.557 --> 00:20:37.482]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.622 --> 00:20:42.125]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:06.212]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:14.659]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.500]  More than likely, this includes you.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.783]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.

[00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:07.551]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:10.214]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.912]  All water isn't the same.
[00:23:03.192 --> 00:23:08.198]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:23:08.438 --> 00:23:11.041]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:23:11.262 --> 00:23:19.792]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:23:20.152 --> 00:23:28.596]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.805]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.466 --> 00:24:10.788]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:16.474 --> 00:24:29.922]  Later in the broadcast today, next hour, I do want to talk about life and death and how transitory life is and how quickly those we love can be taken from us and how that fits into the equation of standing up against tyranny.
[00:24:31.643 --> 00:24:34.025]  I don't want a bunch of people to call me and say they're sorry for me.
[00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:44.351]  I think it's a lesson to be learned from it, but my sweet little chihuahua named Conan, little three-pound chihuahua that was a rescue dog
[00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.771]  You know, been one of these puppy mills, 80-something dogs, been taken away from a lady.
[00:24:49.391 --> 00:24:53.432]  We went and got him when he was like a concentration camp victim about five years ago.
[00:24:54.312 --> 00:25:04.875]  Nursed him back to health, and he'd gotten so spunky, he'd been so fearful and wouldn't come out from under the bed, and he'd gotten to where he'd run around and, you know, chase other dogs out of the yard.
[00:25:04.895 --> 00:25:06.416]  He'd dig out under the fence.
[00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:08.476]  We were always putting wire under the fence to stop him.
[00:25:09.957 --> 00:25:12.597]  And I went with my wife and children for a jog around the lake.
[00:25:13.998 --> 00:25:14.458]  This, uh,
[00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:18.545]  Sunday, I got home and there was a nut on the door.
[00:25:18.605 --> 00:25:21.726]  He'd been plowed under by a car.
[00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:24.608]  I went and got his portable smashed body.
[00:25:25.248 --> 00:25:28.050]  I'll tell you, I have cried probably 15 times over it.
[00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.271]  I love that dog like a person.
[00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:33.112]  Especially because it's so little and sweet and smart.
[00:25:33.132 --> 00:25:35.954]  It was like one of my babies or something.
[00:25:36.354 --> 00:25:40.016]  It lets you know how short life is.
[00:25:40.296 --> 00:25:40.636]  Here I am.
[00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:42.517]  I've got all this serious news to talk about.
[00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:46.910]  I don't know, it's just a real loss.
[00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.893]  And then it makes you think about all the people you've loved and how they've died.
[00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:57.297]  And then I think about, you know, grandparents that have died and cousins that have died, family that's died.
[00:25:57.317 --> 00:26:01.840]  Had dreams about them the last two nights, Sunday night and Monday night.
[00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.822]  Wake up real sad over and over again.
[00:26:04.842 --> 00:26:06.283]  Such a sweet little dog.
[00:26:06.843 --> 00:26:09.605]  So good, so smart, so loving, so loyal.
[00:26:11.106 --> 00:26:14.849]  And to watch his metamorphosis from being a little, you know, scared
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.043]  Two-pound dog up to over three pounds and healthy and like a little bull.
[00:26:22.324 --> 00:26:24.465]  Just so sad, that sweet little dog.
[00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:29.749]  It was really sad digging that little grave and putting him in the ground.
[00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:37.814]  Member of Parliament George Galloway is coming on to talk about his Sterling rebuttal of the lying neocons.
[00:26:38.254 --> 00:26:39.835]  That's coming up after this break.
[00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:45.739]  Let's go ahead and go to part of his opening statements to the Senate
[00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:53.037]  So there's nothing fanciful about this.
[00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:56.259]  Nothing at all fanciful about it.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:05.905]  The existence of forged documents implicating me in commercial activities with the Iraqi regime is a proven fact.
[00:27:06.025 --> 00:27:13.110]  It's a proven fact that these forged documents existed and were being circulated amongst right-wing newspapers
[00:27:13.872 --> 00:27:19.693]  In Baghdad and around the world in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Iraqi regime.
[00:27:19.953 --> 00:27:26.954]  Now Senator, I gave my heart and soul to oppose the policy that you promoted.
[00:27:28.054 --> 00:27:43.517]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq, which killed a million Iraqis, most of them children.
[00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:48.359]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis.
[00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:53.242]  But they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis.
[00:27:53.803 --> 00:27:56.965]  With the misfortune to be born at that time.
[00:27:58.026 --> 00:28:05.611]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq.
[00:28:06.612 --> 00:28:12.076]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.682]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:28:20.442 --> 00:28:26.423]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:32.925]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:34.505]  I told the world, contrary to your claims,
[00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:50.891]  That the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country, and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[00:28:51.671 --> 00:28:58.874]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right, and you turned out to be wrong.
[00:28:59.415 --> 00:29:02.096]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[00:29:02.636 --> 00:29:06.478]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers, sent to their deaths.
[00:29:07.126 --> 00:29:08.629]  On a pack of lies.
[00:29:08.649 --> 00:29:10.872]  15,000 of them wounded.
[00:29:11.233 --> 00:29:13.216]  Many of them disabled forever.
[00:29:13.596 --> 00:29:14.919]  On a pack of lies.
[00:29:15.499 --> 00:29:20.187]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded.
[00:29:20.882 --> 00:29:35.076]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor, if the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we're in today.
[00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:35.917]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:36.317 --> 00:29:42.303]  We're going to come back with Member of Parliament George Galloway, a real trailblazer, honored that he's going to be joining us.
[00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:44.004]  We'll also finish up that little clip.
[00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:45.526]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:51.835 --> 00:29:52.716]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.236 --> 00:29:54.817]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.837 --> 00:29:58.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:09.336]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:30:09.856 --> 00:30:15.277]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now is the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:30:15.677 --> 00:30:25.699]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:28.179]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:31.580]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.281]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:36.242]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:30:36.542 --> 00:30:40.865]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:42.845]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:54.952]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:30:55.452 --> 00:30:59.794]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:31:01.323 --> 00:31:04.364]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.664 --> 00:31:09.586]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:14.207]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.488 --> 00:31:23.411]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.611 --> 00:31:27.232]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.532 --> 00:31:32.574]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:39.558]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.720]  What about you?
[00:31:41.361 --> 00:31:46.724]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.764 --> 00:31:47.864]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.944 --> 00:31:49.825]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:08.921]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:32:09.321 --> 00:32:10.623]  It suppresses your immune system!
[00:32:10.783 --> 00:32:11.484]  Now check this out.
[00:32:11.824 --> 00:32:15.229]  The average American consumes 2-3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:32:15.569 --> 00:32:17.692]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[00:32:18.212 --> 00:32:20.875]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:32:21.135 --> 00:32:21.916]  Your health suffers.
[00:32:22.176 --> 00:32:22.797]  It's that simple.
[00:32:23.158 --> 00:32:27.122]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:35.471]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[00:32:35.911 --> 00:32:36.352]  We're good to go.
[00:33:16.104 --> 00:33:18.405]  I heard that you were a free speech man.
[00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:21.225]  I'm telling you, he's great to talk to in person.
[00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:24.926]  I just got a chance to talk to Mr. Galloway for the last few minutes during the break.
[00:33:24.946 --> 00:33:28.126]  We'll be talking to him live here in just a minute or two.
[00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:33.567]  An unbelievably intelligent and courageous individual.
[00:33:33.607 --> 00:33:37.488]  I wish we had more politicians like him here in the United States, but he's a statesman.
[00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:45.559]  And basically left the Labor Party because he refused to go along with their propaganda with Tony Blair and the CIA and MI6.
[00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:53.701]  And now he has just turned the tables on the lying neocons who were bearing false witness against him.
[00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:59.303]  And he's winning lawsuits against liars and other perpetrators of mass murder in Iraq.
[00:33:59.663 --> 00:34:01.083]  And so I want to just commend him.
[00:34:01.304 --> 00:34:02.724]  But here's about two minutes
[00:34:03.204 --> 00:34:09.910]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq, which killed a million Iraqis, most of them children.
[00:34:32.142 --> 00:34:35.745]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis.
[00:34:36.526 --> 00:34:40.649]  But they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis.
[00:34:41.189 --> 00:34:44.352]  With the misfortune to be born at that time.
[00:34:45.413 --> 00:34:52.999]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.484]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[00:35:00.749 --> 00:35:07.092]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:35:07.853 --> 00:35:13.776]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:22.536]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:38.267]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country, and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:46.280]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong.
[00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:49.482]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:56.046]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers, sent to their deaths on a pack of lies.
[00:35:56.606 --> 00:36:02.330]  Fifteen thousand of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies.
[00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:07.573]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded,
[00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:14.576]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor.
[00:36:15.096 --> 00:36:22.481]  If the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we're in today.
[00:36:23.302 --> 00:36:26.805]  Senator, this is the mother of all smokescreens.
[00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:36.692]  You are trying to divert attention from the crimes that you supported, from the theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth.
[00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:40.984]  Have a look at the real oil for food scandal.
[00:36:41.524 --> 00:36:52.794]  Have a look at the 14 months you were in charge of Baghdad, the first 14 months, when 8.8 billion dollars of Iraq's wealth went missing on your watch.
[00:36:53.454 --> 00:37:01.401]  Have a look at Halliburton and the other American corporations that stole not only Iraq's money, but the money of the American taxpayer.
[00:37:02.142 --> 00:37:04.684]  Have a look at the oil that you didn't even meter.
[00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:10.972]  That you were shipping out of the country and selling, the proceeds of which went who knows where.
[00:37:11.312 --> 00:37:20.400]  Have a look at the 800 million dollars you gave to American military commanders to hand out around the country without even counting it or weighing it.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.324]  Alright, now again it goes on and on and he totally turned the tables on him.
[00:37:25.784 --> 00:37:30.448]  This is the same crew that lied about Mr. Galloway, the Honorable Mr. Galloway, Member of Parliament.
[00:37:30.889 --> 00:37:31.970]  This is the same crew!
[00:37:33.024 --> 00:37:42.766]  That creates fake Niger uranium documents, that uses 12-year-old graduate student documents, that holds up vials of anthrax and comes up with 45-minute missile stories.
[00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:49.227]  This is the same crew that tried to plant weapons of mass destruction over and over again and always got caught lying.
[00:37:49.287 --> 00:37:52.008]  This is the crew that ordered the CIA to lie.
[00:37:52.068 --> 00:37:56.509]  This is the crew involved in all the bid rigging and Dick Cheney running the contracts out of the White House.
[00:37:56.969 --> 00:38:00.651]  Okay, enough of Mr. Galloway's earlier statements and my comments.
[00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.112]  Mr. Galloway, it's a great honor to have you joining us.
[00:38:03.392 --> 00:38:04.873]  It's a great pleasure, any time at all.
[00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:16.979]  Please give us in a nutshell what really happened here and then any new developments that you've discovered involving this monstrous fraud that they tried to falsely paint you with.
[00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:21.201]  Well, I think that the comments you've just made really sum it up.
[00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:24.903]  This is mendacity on a militarized scale.
[00:38:25.555 --> 00:38:43.162]  The British and American states were involved in spinning a story so vile and such a monumental lie that they will be damned forever in the history books and beyond that into the hell fires themselves.
[00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:48.774]  Because they have killed a huge number of people on that pack of lies.
[00:38:48.815 --> 00:38:51.497]  This is not just like lying to win an election.
[00:38:51.938 --> 00:38:55.502]  It's not lying about what you think of the economic curve.
[00:38:55.922 --> 00:38:59.086]  It's not lying on a normal political scale.
[00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:09.208]  This is lying on a scale that has plunged the world into a disaster, the bottom of which we have very definitely not yet reached.
[00:39:09.828 --> 00:39:21.572]  The reverberations of the war on Iraq, the invasion and its occupation, will continue as long as you and I are alive and probably as long as our children are alive.
[00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:27.489]  They have scarred the face of the international legal and political systems.
[00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:34.795]  They have undermined respect for democratic government in your country and in mine.
[00:39:35.376 --> 00:39:41.180]  They have polarized the world between the West and the East, between the North and the South.
[00:39:41.781 --> 00:39:49.387]  They have made hundreds of millions of people hate us even more intently than they already hated us.
[00:39:49.968 --> 00:39:51.549]  And with a charge sheet like that,
[00:39:52.193 --> 00:40:01.617]  It's no wonder that those responsible are throwing up what I call the mother of all smokescreens, because they have to fool us one more time.
[00:40:02.077 --> 00:40:07.039]  They have to take our eyes off the real issues and the real villains of the peace.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:15.343]  And so they construct false villains, windmills at which they wish the people to tilt, like Kofi Annan.
[00:40:16.007 --> 00:40:24.551]  Who has enraged them forever by describing their war as an illegal war, meaning that they are criminals.
[00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:35.636]  Those responsible for an illegal war are, what they said at Nuremberg in 1945, guilty of the, and I quote, paramount war crime.
[00:40:36.161 --> 00:40:41.343]  Which is a crime of aggression, the illegal invasion of another people's country.
[00:40:42.104 --> 00:40:54.769]  These people want to turn your ire against President Chirac in France, against people like me in the anti-war movement in Britain, against people like Scott Ritter, the former American arms inspector.
[00:40:55.169 --> 00:41:01.652]  They want to have you running around on inquiry after inquiry, based on their forged documents.
[00:41:02.248 --> 00:41:07.572]  Instead of putting them on trial, at least politically, and sweeping them out of office.
[00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:38.494]  Yes they did, and people can read about it at the RespectCoalition.org.
[00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:44.219]  That's www.RespectCoalition, all one word, dot org.
[00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:49.479]  And there they will see the story as it unfolded now over nearly three years.
[00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:52.422]  But they put out so many lies, their lies contradicted each other.
[00:41:52.702 --> 00:42:02.911]  Yes, the forged documents couldn't keep up with the other forgeries, and therefore were throwing up mutually incompatible stories.
[00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.794]  If I take one that's of particular interest to American listeners,
[00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:24.190]  It is the one perpetrated by the Christian Science Monitor, generally regarded as one of the world's great newspaper titles, but who purchased a set of documents from someone claiming to be an Iraqi general within a few days of the fall of Baghdad.
[00:42:24.971 --> 00:42:33.753]  They placed that on their front page around the world and on their website around the world that I had received 10 million dollars
[00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:37.503]  From a son of Saddam Hussein, whom I had never met.
[00:42:37.623 --> 00:42:40.684]  But it turns out the oil for food program didn't even exist then.
[00:42:40.944 --> 00:42:41.384]  Exactly.
[00:42:41.845 --> 00:42:56.612]  A son of Saddam Hussein I had never even met, and starting in a year I had never yet set foot in Iraq, and finishing on a given date, an actual date, when instead of being in Iraq as they claimed, collecting another million dollar check,
[00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.412]  Which is another ludicrous aspect to it.
[00:42:59.432 --> 00:43:09.119]  Iraq, of course, under quarantine, was not part of the international banking system, so a cheque from the Iraqi regime would have been as useful as toilet paper.
[00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:22.788]  The date that they chose was, in fact, demonstrably in the House of Commons, on the Guardian website, doing an interactive interview with the Guardian's readers.
[00:43:24.093 --> 00:43:34.244]  I said on the day they called me about this in the English press because the Christian Science Monitor made no effort to contact me or put that allegation to me.
[00:43:34.384 --> 00:43:36.327]  And by the way, your background is journalism.
[00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:37.548]  You know about real journalism.
[00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:42.914]  I do know about journalism and I am a columnist and a journalist of many years standing.
[00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:54.998]  But when the English press following this story up contacted me and I told them the truth, I was denounced by the neocon journals in the United States.
[00:43:55.118 --> 00:43:56.239]  I was clearly guilty.
[00:43:56.619 --> 00:44:00.662]  According to them, I had become a multi-millionaire thanks to Saddam Hussein.
[00:44:01.243 --> 00:44:08.788]  The only problem is that and then an English newspaper bought a set of documents off the same ersatz general.
[00:44:09.562 --> 00:44:33.761]  And they subjected their documents to forensic examination, only to discover that the signatures on them were forged, that the information within the documents was mutually contradictory, and when I gave them my passports to check the dates I had come and gone from Iraq, they didn't match up with the times I was supposed to be in Iraq picking up money.
[00:44:34.182 --> 00:44:38.245]  The Christian Science Monitor then forensically examined their own documents.
[00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:42.817]  You might think they should have done that before they published the smear against me.
[00:44:43.382 --> 00:44:50.127]  But they subjected their own documents to chemical ink, forensic analysis, and the whole thing came down like a pack of cards.
[00:44:50.707 --> 00:44:57.451]  It was a crude set of forgeries, but an intricate one, and one which had been done within days of the fall of Baghdad.
[00:45:14.022 --> 00:45:22.186]  Yes, and I'll tell you what, not one of the new Labour government that's currently in power and in league with George Bush was with me on the protest.
[00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:23.286]  Not one of them.
[00:45:23.727 --> 00:45:31.630]  No Tony Blair's, no Jack Straw's, nobody from the current new Labour hierarchy ever set foot on any of our demonstrations.
[00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:39.794]  As a matter of fact, when we were demonstrating outside Downing Street against the presence there of the Iraqi government leaders,
[00:45:40.569 --> 00:45:52.277]  Douglas Hard, who was then the Foreign Office Minister, told the Iraqi leaders that we who were protesting for democracy and human rights in Iraq were just a bunch of communist troublemakers.
[00:45:52.978 --> 00:45:54.078]  And that's what we were doing.
[00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:59.322]  We were accused of causing trouble for those who were making big money.
[00:45:59.873 --> 00:46:04.896]  Out of the special relationship that British and American companies had with the Iraqi regime.
[00:46:05.336 --> 00:46:18.343]  I want to know, there's so many forgeries and so many lies, and those are now admitted to be lies by the papers that did it themselves, but the neocons, sir, I listen to them, they're still slandering you and still crucifying you on a daily basis.
[00:46:19.084 --> 00:46:22.926]  Yes they are, but I fear that fewer and fewer people are listening.
[00:46:23.573 --> 00:46:38.965]  My impression of my very brief visit to the United States, which I hope to follow up with a speaking tour over the summer months, is that there are a vast number of American citizens who have already seen through this crew, this neocon.
[00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:39.805]  A lot of their supporters.
[00:46:39.885 --> 00:46:41.046]  A Christian fundamentalist.
[00:46:41.146 --> 00:46:42.727]  A lot of their former supporters.
[00:46:43.248 --> 00:46:43.548]  Yes.
[00:46:44.609 --> 00:46:52.755]  By the way, one of the amazing things about your neocons is that so many of them used to be Trotskyists and Marxists of one variety or another.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.461]  They've exchanged one zealotry for another zealotry.
[00:46:56.921 --> 00:47:00.562]  Even though it's facing in entirely the opposite direction to the one they used to face.
[00:47:01.222 --> 00:47:06.884]  But my impression is that fewer and fewer people are listening to these neocon journals and websites.
[00:47:07.484 --> 00:47:11.925]  Because I've had this fantastic response from the people of the United States.
[00:47:12.326 --> 00:47:17.187]  And I'm looking forward to meeting many of them at the speaking engagements I do in the United States over the summer.
[00:47:17.387 --> 00:47:20.228]  You told me that you've gotten 20,000 emails from Americans.
[00:47:20.308 --> 00:47:20.548]  Yes.
[00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:22.702]  20,000 emails.
[00:47:22.982 --> 00:47:29.305]  And it's not easy for an American to get hold of the email address of a British Member of Parliament.
[00:47:29.705 --> 00:47:33.827]  Which is, by the way, GallowayG at Parliament dot UK.
[00:47:34.247 --> 00:47:36.388]  GallowayG at Parliament dot UK.
[00:47:36.608 --> 00:47:39.129]  The sooner we get the better, we should all stay in touch.
[00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.391]  We should make a big network on both sides of the Atlantic.
[00:47:42.811 --> 00:47:46.913]  Because your country and my country are the biggest problems in the world today.
[00:47:47.273 --> 00:47:48.754]  We're the biggest rogue states.
[00:47:49.204 --> 00:47:50.025]  In the world today.
[00:47:50.325 --> 00:47:52.806]  And the citizens have got to take back control of the plane.
[00:47:53.207 --> 00:47:56.969]  Well, Mr. Galloway, isn't it that the elite corporations aren't even free market now?
[00:47:57.249 --> 00:48:03.393]  They've seized control of Airstrip One, England, and the United States as an engine of global domination?
[00:48:03.853 --> 00:48:04.794]  That's absolutely right.
[00:48:05.294 --> 00:48:08.256]  Military spending is the welfare of capitalism.
[00:48:08.696 --> 00:48:12.599]  It's being used war after war to prime the pumps
[00:48:13.254 --> 00:48:24.680]  Of the big corporations, some of the profits from those corporations goes back into the political system as recycled campaign dollars and then the governments hand out the contracts all over again.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:33.344]  Well sir, this year we had record numbers of weapons being sold to third world dictators and in five years our government will then invade those countries calling them dictators.
[00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:40.187]  Exactly so, and we have a big arms fair coming up in my own constituency in East London later this year
[00:48:40.797 --> 00:48:50.912]  And when it was last year, two years ago, and we turned up to protest, the government turned out an anti-terrorist order to blockade the area.
[00:48:51.533 --> 00:48:54.758]  Not against the dictators that were inside buying arms,
[00:49:06.201 --> 00:49:08.522]  Mr. Galloway, we don't have a lot of time left with you.
[00:49:08.562 --> 00:49:19.630]  I wanted to get into any new developments concerning the neocons and their real profiteering from the war, and any new developments, because when you were there in front of the Senate, I mean, they looked scared.
[00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.873]  Did they expect you to come back and fight them, or do they think you'd just take it?
[00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:25.853]  Well, the truth has wings.
[00:49:26.374 --> 00:49:27.854]  And God gave me wings that day.
[00:49:27.954 --> 00:49:28.914]  I was really flying.
[00:49:28.934 --> 00:49:31.015]  I know the subject inside out.
[00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:36.817]  And I was right, as was the anti-war movement in both the United States and Great Britain.
[00:49:37.237 --> 00:49:40.998]  We said exactly what would happen, and it's now happening.
[00:49:41.038 --> 00:49:46.719]  And since I was in front of that committee in Washington, some more brave American boys have lost their lives.
[00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:48.460]  Others have lost their limbs.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.221]  And many, many more Iraqis have been killed.
[00:49:51.721 --> 00:49:52.721]  In the month of May,
[00:49:53.513 --> 00:49:56.434]  Almost a thousand people lost their lives in one month.
[00:49:57.114 --> 00:49:59.135]  And that's just the ones we bothered to count.
[00:49:59.795 --> 00:50:07.338]  The number of operations taking place in Iraq between the resistance and the occupation forces is now at record levels.
[00:50:07.918 --> 00:50:12.760]  Just months after they told us that there was an election in Iraq and that was the beginning of the end.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.821]  They've trumpeted the beginning of the end so many times.
[00:50:16.323 --> 00:50:17.804]  Nobody's listening anymore.
[00:50:18.285 --> 00:50:21.727]  In fact, we're in for a long, bloody haul in Iraq.
[00:50:22.128 --> 00:50:25.010]  And many more young American boys will lose their lives as a result.
[00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.032]  That's what I wanted to ask you is, where do you think all this is going?
[00:50:28.573 --> 00:50:30.895]  Well, I think Britain and America are sunk in a swamp.
[00:50:30.975 --> 00:50:32.676]  They can't go forward, they can't go back.
[00:50:33.256 --> 00:50:40.943]  If they withdraw out of the cities, into the camps that they're building, the resistance will take over control of the streets overnight.
[00:50:41.543 --> 00:50:42.704]  If they stay on the streets,
[00:50:43.234 --> 00:50:45.297]  They'll be the target for the resistance.
[00:50:45.857 --> 00:50:47.720]  The resistance is getting stronger and stronger.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.502]  You know, Mr. Galloway, we're out of time.
[00:50:49.522 --> 00:50:53.467]  Can I hold you just a few more minutes after the break so you can give us more of your analysis?
[00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:54.688]  Of course you can, sir, yes.
[00:50:54.748 --> 00:50:55.850]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.011]  We're really honored to have you.
[00:50:57.952 --> 00:50:59.314]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:05.884]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.084 --> 00:51:10.506]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.646 --> 00:51:15.028]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.068 --> 00:51:16.409]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.129 --> 00:51:18.009]  Panama.
[00:51:18.189 --> 00:51:22.430]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:29.432]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.532 --> 00:51:31.613]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.913 --> 00:51:41.055]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery
[00:51:41.135 --> 00:51:41.455]  That's 888-253-3139
[00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:04.685]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.045 --> 00:52:13.856]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:18.842]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.322 --> 00:52:26.048]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.449 --> 00:52:38.219]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.699 --> 00:52:43.162]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.322 --> 00:52:45.784]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:50.406 --> 00:52:51.467]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:54:07.799 --> 00:54:09.581]  A big guest coming up in the third hour.
[00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:15.285]  Our government knowingly knew that HIV and Hepatitis was in the blood supply and shipped it all over the world.
[00:54:15.426 --> 00:54:16.667]  Europe, Canada and the US.
[00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:19.809]  Tens of thousands got HIV and Hepatitis from it.
[00:54:20.129 --> 00:54:21.331]  That's in the BBC today.
[00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.632]  We'll be covering that coming up in the third hour.
[00:54:23.672 --> 00:54:25.394]  We've got Mr. Galloway for a few more minutes.
[00:54:25.434 --> 00:54:26.255]  Member of Parliament.
[00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:28.216]  A man of conscience.
[00:54:28.236 --> 00:54:31.219]  We really appreciate joining us today.
[00:54:32.262 --> 00:54:35.303]  Mr. Galloway, during the break I was talking to you.
[00:54:35.323 --> 00:54:45.187]  You're about to collect on $600,000 from your libel slander suit against newspapers that printed these lies.
[00:54:45.227 --> 00:54:49.849]  Yes, $600,000 to me and about, oh, the best part of $3 million to the lawyers.
[00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:53.570]  So the costs and damages have been very great.
[00:54:54.670 --> 00:55:01.393]  Saddam Hussein gave me nothing but the newspapers who alleged that he had are having to pay very dearly for those lies.
[00:55:02.126 --> 00:55:11.553]  And where I can, I will tackle the American outlets that are still peddling these same discredited lies about me.
[00:55:12.074 --> 00:55:18.739]  Unfortunately, these senators made their attack behind the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege.
[00:55:19.179 --> 00:55:21.661]  So I can't sue them for what they said about me.
[00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:23.603]  But I helped demolish it, I think.
[00:55:23.683 --> 00:55:27.405]  It was a house of cards that fell down with a bit of huff and puff from me.
[00:55:27.846 --> 00:55:30.648]  It all fell down because it was based on nothing at all.
[00:55:31.631 --> 00:55:37.593]  But a much more important issue is how we stop this disaster, not just in Iraq, but around the world.
[00:55:38.013 --> 00:55:55.117]  We really have to pull our countries out of this coalition of the killing, because it's making people all over the world hate us, it's damaging our interests, it's endangering our citizens when they travel or when they work and live abroad, and we really have to get out of this nosedive that we are in.
[00:55:55.897 --> 00:56:02.304]  So, I hope that people will look at our website, that's respectcoalition.org, and will stay in touch with me.
[00:56:02.384 --> 00:56:11.153]  Send me, by any means, your email, gallowayg at parliament dot uk, and I'll let you know when my speaking tour begins, the big cities I'm going.
[00:56:11.654 --> 00:56:14.797]  One of the main places where there's a huge demand is Minnesota.
[00:56:15.416 --> 00:56:33.982]  Where they used to have an honorable senator called Wellstone, who was mysteriously killed in a plane accident, and who was succeeded by none other than the smarmy Norman Coleman, the man who chaired the Senate McCarthyite witch hunt, into me, the author of the Mother of All Smokescreens.
[00:56:34.442 --> 00:56:36.163]  They said he was a presidential hopeful.
[00:56:36.523 --> 00:56:39.684]  He didn't much look like a presidential hopeful by the time I was finished with him.
[00:56:40.467 --> 00:56:42.149]  Just two more final questions.
[00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:42.789]  We're going to let you go.
[00:56:42.809 --> 00:56:45.292]  I know you're very busy and it's evening over there in London right now.
[00:56:45.872 --> 00:56:50.857]  Mr. Galloway, George Galloway, looking at this, you've gotten to Iraq falling apart.
[00:56:52.099 --> 00:57:01.448]  The Pentagon's own P2OG documents, perhaps folks should send this to you, said they want to widen the hatred, cause more attacks as a pretext to invade more countries.
[00:57:01.808 --> 00:57:04.211]  Where do you see this ending and will they go into Iran?
[00:57:05.209 --> 00:57:06.871]  I think they're too weak to do so.
[00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:10.354]  I think the Iraqi resistance has stopped them in their tracks.
[00:57:10.955 --> 00:57:15.560]  Undoubtedly they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.985]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[00:57:21.226 --> 00:57:23.969]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[00:57:23.989 --> 00:57:26.191]  They're saying they'll go ahead and may attack Iran.
[00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:34.460]  Well, there was an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[00:57:34.921 --> 00:57:39.386]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:42.009]  What if Israel drags us in?
[00:57:42.249 --> 00:57:43.391]  Well, that's a possibility.
[00:57:43.791 --> 00:57:45.193]  Israel might strike Iran.
[00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:52.380]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.801]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:57:54.861 --> 00:57:58.603]  Well, I have another article, RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[00:57:58.683 --> 00:58:02.404]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[00:58:02.764 --> 00:58:06.606]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[00:58:06.706 --> 00:58:13.469]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[00:58:13.909 --> 00:58:15.792]  To launch any new wars.
[00:58:16.272 --> 00:58:18.035]  But we must keep them weak.
[00:58:18.555 --> 00:58:20.218]  If we let them recover their strength...
[00:58:20.882 --> 00:58:25.564]  If we let them off the hook, then they may well decide to start yet another war.
[00:58:25.584 --> 00:58:26.305]  We've got 30 seconds.
[00:58:26.505 --> 00:58:30.647]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack to blame it on them?
[00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:34.229]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:40.232]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[00:58:40.312 --> 00:58:42.413]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:43.494]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:43.794 --> 00:58:48.976]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[00:58:49.177 --> 00:58:49.757]  I salute you.
[00:58:50.297 --> 00:58:57.829]  Thank you very much.
[00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:58.631]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:00.396]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.117 --> 00:59:02.217]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.858 --> 00:59:03.679]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.439 --> 00:59:05.320]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:09.683]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.184 --> 00:59:14.327]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.828 --> 00:59:21.893]  An absolutely incredible news-making interview.
[00:59:23.479 --> 00:59:25.520]  In the last 30 minutes of the last hour.
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.421]  Unbelievable!
[00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:29.282]  Blew me away!
[00:59:30.642 --> 00:59:39.547]  George Galloway, Member of Parliament, United Kingdom, falsely accused, winning libel suits left and right, against the papers that try to demonize him.
[00:59:39.987 --> 00:59:41.848]  I bring up government-sponsored terror.
[00:59:42.088 --> 00:59:44.149]  Our government's carrying out terror attacks.
[00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:50.532]  And he's now joined the ranks of Andres von Bulow, German Defense Minister, number three in the Blair government,
[00:59:51.494 --> 00:59:55.018]  Michael Meacher saying the government may be behind the terror attacks.
[00:59:55.218 --> 00:59:59.322]  He said, you heard him, we're gonna air it again later, we're gonna air a few minutes of that later.
[00:59:59.602 --> 01:00:01.725]  He said that's a very real possibility.
[01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.727]  I gotta get him back on, he was out of time.
[01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.209]  Very serious, see?
[01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:13.517]  The big threat is our government carrying out a terrorist attack and blaming it on their enemies.
[01:00:14.457 --> 01:00:15.958]  This is not a joke, folks.
[01:00:16.138 --> 01:00:21.762]  All people that have real political minds and know history and are on the side of decency know the truth.
[01:00:21.782 --> 01:00:25.284]  I need to catch my breath after that.
[01:00:25.464 --> 01:00:27.546]  I am just blown away.
[01:00:27.566 --> 01:00:30.328]  Now, of course, I don't agree with Galloway on everything.
[01:00:30.348 --> 01:00:30.768]  You know, the U.N.
[01:00:30.848 --> 01:00:35.291]  is good, and coffee in it is good, but that's all part of the false left-right choice we're given.
[01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:44.117]  But, obviously, our government is totally rogue, out of control, being used as the bad cop by the globalists right now, and they're power-mad, totally out of control.
[01:00:46.245 --> 01:00:47.426]  What did you think of that interview?
[01:00:47.806 --> 01:00:50.808]  I'd like you to speak on that interview or any of the other news items we've mentioned.
[01:00:50.828 --> 01:00:52.188]  We'll take your calls when we get back.
[01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:52.268]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:52.288 --> 01:00:52.409]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:52.429 --> 01:00:54.530]  We will get you up and on the air.
[01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:57.271]  Man, that was just absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:14.152]  And coming up later in this hour, we'll air three or four minutes at the end of that interview.
[01:01:14.172 --> 01:01:15.854]  Did you hear him drop that bombshell?
[01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:18.815]  Did you hear him drop that bombshell?
[01:01:19.796 --> 01:01:23.738]  That, you know, I tend to go right up to breaks with guests in some stations.
[01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:25.660]  You know, they have it delayed.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.761]  And it goes down to satellite delayed.
[01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:30.223]  I know some stations that last ten seconds might have been cut off.
[01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.625]  I really shouldn't go right up to breaks like that, but there's so much news and information.
[01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.326]  So we'll be sure and air that.
[01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:36.707]  In fact, you know what?
[01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.648]  We'll just air the whole five minutes.
[01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:53.384]  That whole last five minute segment, with that bombshell nuke, thermal nuclear bomb of info weaponry being dropped on the globalists, that was absolutely stunning.
[01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:55.925]  You can tell I'm excited here.
[01:01:57.325 --> 01:01:59.566]  Oh man, I tell you, I am wound up now.
[01:01:59.626 --> 01:02:08.569]  I got up about five this morning, went and did a couple hours at a local radio station, and mourning the loss of my chihuahua that got out of the fence and got plowed by a car.
[01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:09.129]  It was horrible.
[01:02:10.316 --> 01:02:12.919]  But that's just life, my friends.
[01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:26.995]  But I tell you, having interviews like that makes it all worthwhile and reminds me why I'm here and why I'm doing what I'm doing and why I take all the barbs and darts that people throw at me because fighting the globalists is what I was made for.
[01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:29.538]  And I appreciate you riding shotgun with us.
[01:02:29.558 --> 01:02:31.040]  You were made to fight the New World Order.
[01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:41.117]  And I appreciate everybody hanging with us on this broadcast as we grow and reach more and more people, and I'm honored and blessed to be your host and humbled.
[01:02:41.418 --> 01:02:43.159]  So I just want to thank all of you for joining us.
[01:02:44.499 --> 01:02:48.982]  Coming up, aspartame triggers impotence and blindness, major medical reports.
[01:02:50.102 --> 01:02:54.325]  We already knew this, but now ABC reports today that the FDA is looking into blindness.
[01:02:55.901 --> 01:03:01.285]  And of course, it's now coming out what Viagra does, a lot of evidence showing.
[01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:05.708]  I mean, yeah, it causes all sorts of weird cardiovascular manipulations.
[01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:08.770]  And so it's going to have unseen side effects.
[01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:12.132]  A lot of times the side effects of these drugs are worse than what they do for you.
[01:03:12.953 --> 01:03:19.077]  And they say about one to five percent of medical issues get reported properly.
[01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:21.899]  And so if hundreds have gone blind,
[01:03:22.697 --> 01:03:25.378]  Linked to this, it could be in the tens of thousands.
[01:03:26.238 --> 01:03:30.038]  But you notice they'll pull drugs like this when they can be proven to have a problem.
[01:03:30.078 --> 01:03:33.259]  Unless it's psychotropics being pushed on the population.
[01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:37.420]  No matter how many suicides or mass murders or depression is linked to it.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.880]  They just keep pushing it with their new freedom initiative.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.481]  Which we did defeat in Texas for now.
[01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:44.901]  Some good news I can declare to you.
[01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:49.502]  More good news, they just shot down part of the EU expansion in France.
[01:03:49.962 --> 01:03:50.602]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.524 --> 01:04:00.370]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:02.052]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:04.474]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.594 --> 01:04:06.696]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:11.901]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.241 --> 01:04:16.285]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.525 --> 01:04:18.286]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.366 --> 01:04:29.009]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:31.070]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:33.251]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:04:33.251 --> 01:04:33.651]  We're good.

[01:06:00.096 --> 01:06:04.279]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[01:06:23.786 --> 01:06:25.807]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.250]  Again that's 888-211-1715.
[01:06:54.233 --> 01:07:03.119]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.279 --> 01:07:07.202]  Alright, we've got the head of the Hemophiliac Society of Canada coming on.
[01:07:07.242 --> 01:07:16.929]  Everything we talked about six, seven, eight years ago is all public now about the government and the Red Cross and others knowing there was HIV and Hepatitis and other horrible
[01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:24.352]  diseases, pathogenic diseases, in there, and they knowingly shipped it all over the world for over a decade.
[01:07:25.513 --> 01:07:34.356]  Just like the depleted uranium, just like the genetically modified food, they know how bad it is, just like all these big pharma, psychotropic drugs, they know, and they just keep doing it!
[01:07:35.657 --> 01:07:44.160]  We're about to go right to your calls, and then more into what Viagra can make you go blind, folks, and aspartame triggers impotence and blindness.
[01:07:45.535 --> 01:07:47.417]  Another report, this time ABC News.
[01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:50.499]  Again, we had guests on seven, eight years ago about this.
[01:07:50.519 --> 01:07:51.680]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.842]  I'm letting you know, this has all been public.
[01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.463]  They're just having trouble hiding it now.
[01:07:57.704 --> 01:08:08.733]  But I'm gonna, in about 25 minutes, I'm gonna, re-air the last five minutes of that Member of Parliament George Galloway interview, where at the very end I said, George,
[01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:12.958]  Don't you think the danger to go to war with Iran is the government to carry out a terror attack?
[01:08:12.978 --> 01:08:15.320]  Because you said, yeah, they're probably not going to invade Iran right now.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.161]  I go, what if they carry out a terror attack?
[01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:17.762]  Our own government?
[01:08:18.963 --> 01:08:20.684]  He said, that is a very real threat.
[01:08:20.724 --> 01:08:21.905]  That is very serious.
[01:08:22.406 --> 01:08:29.832]  Folks, look, this is the real deal and an incredible statement from Mr. Galloway.
[01:08:29.852 --> 01:08:35.216]  We're going to be playing that coming up at the 33 After.
[01:08:37.499 --> 01:08:39.880]  Let's go to Daryl, calling us from France.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.840]  Daryl, go ahead.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.500]  Alex, nice to talk to you again.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.421]  You know, I wanted to make a couple of statements about, first of all, congratulations on the Galloway interview.
[01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:48.182]  That's fantastic.
[01:08:48.782 --> 01:08:51.983]  And I never heard him go that far with a statement like that.
[01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:54.823]  But I wanted to talk to you about the election here.
[01:08:55.163 --> 01:09:01.445]  And, you know, the sentiment has been steadily degrading for the government here for quite a while.
[01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:08.931]  You know, the American public needs to know that the French public are well informed, and they know that their jobs are being shipped to China just like in America.
[01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.954]  They just threw out the expansion of the EU Constitution!
[01:09:11.974 --> 01:09:12.694]  Give us a report!
[01:09:13.035 --> 01:09:17.198]  They did, and what happened was that six other countries had already approved it.
[01:09:17.798 --> 01:09:22.122]  And so they thought early on it was a slam dunk, and the French public surprised them.
[01:09:22.462 --> 01:09:31.910]  And about a month ago, when they started realizing that they weren't going to win this, they came, they pulled out all the stops that they could do, and they brought all of their political might to bear,
[01:09:32.503 --> 01:09:36.145]  And the public's disdain for them increased, not went down.
[01:09:36.726 --> 01:09:41.088]  And the final vote turned out about 56% against, 44% for it.
[01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:46.912]  And the next vote's coming up in a day from now over in Holland, and they're looking at 70% rejection.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.981]  And so, for all intents and purposes, this Constitution is finished.
[01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:56.483]  Well, that's because people finally, in the alternative press, got to learn what's in it.
[01:09:57.264 --> 01:10:01.725]  And it's a total police state takeover, and even an expanded loss of sovereignty.
[01:10:01.745 --> 01:10:07.408]  They've already given up their currencies and many of their laws, and now it's going to be a total dictatorship if this thing went through.
[01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:08.488]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:10:08.528 --> 01:10:12.650]  But I notice the bureaucrats are saying, we're going to use the bureaucracy, we're still going to implement this.
[01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.610]  Well, you know, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.691]  And here's one of the things the American public doesn't know.
[01:10:17.071 --> 01:10:22.072]  Many of these policies about land use and the things that go on in America... That all comes from Europe.
[01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:23.873]  It's been tried out here already.
[01:10:23.913 --> 01:10:24.833]  You're exactly right.
[01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:31.134]  And I mean, what they've done here is they've made it almost impossible for people to live on the land anymore, and they're forcing people into the city.
[01:10:31.154 --> 01:10:35.155]  And now people have about 1.3 children, and some of the cities are half empty.
[01:10:35.175 --> 01:10:38.316]  I mean, the whole culture's falling apart thanks to social engineering.
[01:10:38.636 --> 01:10:46.161]  Well, you know, it's happening, but see, the French public have seen this, that they know that they smell a rat, and they're coming out in force.
[01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:55.246]  You know, our government was responsible largely for trashing the French because they were the first people to come out and say that the 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:10:55.686 --> 01:11:01.490]  And as soon as they did that, that was the government that trashed the whole country of France and called it Freedom Fries and all this.
[01:11:02.337 --> 01:11:07.542]  And in fact, the French have been, from the beginning, saying to the American public, your own government's doing this stuff to you.
[01:11:08.322 --> 01:11:13.286]  And over here, we're getting a different news cycle than we're getting in the United States.
[01:11:13.306 --> 01:11:14.727]  We're getting a little bit of different stuff here.
[01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:19.551]  Now I know the intel we've got is the Bilderbergs are pulling their hair out.
[01:11:19.571 --> 01:11:20.252]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:20.752 --> 01:11:21.793]  Good to hear from you there.
[01:11:22.694 --> 01:11:25.136]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[01:11:26.394 --> 01:11:28.135]  Mike and Tejas, go ahead, sir.
[01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:29.936]  Yes, Alex, this is Mike.
[01:11:30.176 --> 01:11:31.896]  Kudos on that interview with George Galloway.
[01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:32.697]  Thank you.
[01:11:32.817 --> 01:11:41.420]  I was one of the 20,000 who emailed him to thank him for his guts to stand up against that commission and to speak the truth about the war in Iraq.
[01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:45.942]  What we have in Washington are just a bunch of wimps, except for Ron Paul, that is.
[01:11:45.962 --> 01:11:47.443]  A bunch of bought-off criminals.
[01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:48.163]  That's right.
[01:11:48.923 --> 01:11:50.184]  And kudos on that.
[01:11:50.344 --> 01:11:54.486]  Another thing I want to touch on quickly is I've got a close family member that's being sent to China to train
[01:11:55.871 --> 01:11:58.173]  Train the Chinese to do the jobs we're doing here in America.
[01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.133]  It's for real, folks.
[01:11:59.193 --> 01:12:12.063]  Listen, almost everybody, and I don't mean almost everybody, I mean literally, in fact everyone I know, I haven't found somebody in high tech who hasn't been told in the next year to six months, this has been going on for years, most of them have lost their jobs.
[01:12:12.363 --> 01:12:16.426]  You've got to train this guy from India or China and he's going back to train people at our new factory.
[01:12:16.746 --> 01:12:17.307]  Exactly.
[01:12:17.407 --> 01:12:20.069]  And how are we going to buy all this garbage if our jobs are all gone?
[01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:21.610]  And I don't want to hear it's free trade.
[01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:24.812]  China has a 40 plus percent tariff on us on average.
[01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:32.937]  We've got an average of 2% on them, now they're talking about a 10% textile tax, which won't even begin to touch what's happening, and people are freaking out!
[01:12:33.177 --> 01:12:33.958]  It's incredible, Alex.
[01:12:33.978 --> 01:12:39.482]  People need to wake up, and they need to do so by going to attend the showings of your new film.
[01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:42.283]  And I bought my tickets online, I'm ready to go and check it out.
[01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:43.704]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:12:43.724 --> 01:12:44.825]  What showing are you going to?
[01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:47.747]  I'm going to the Wednesday night, June the 8th, 8 o'clock.
[01:12:48.689 --> 01:12:50.190]  All right, I appreciate the call, Mike.
[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:52.171]  In fact, I didn't plug my videos.
[01:12:52.211 --> 01:12:54.673]  I didn't plug the film showing in the last hour.
[01:12:54.693 --> 01:12:56.574]  I should have.
[01:12:56.594 --> 01:12:58.195]  So much news, such a great guest.
[01:12:58.275 --> 01:13:03.118]  But coming up this Friday, now in four days, less than four days, 7 and 10 p.m.
[01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:03.938]  downtown.
[01:13:05.639 --> 01:13:07.400]  7 and 10 p.m.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.542]  downtown, Colorado Street, Alamo Draft House.
[01:13:11.275 --> 01:13:15.956]  Food, ice cream, pizzas, hamburgers, coffee and other beverages.
[01:13:16.296 --> 01:13:16.656]  Tables!
[01:13:16.676 --> 01:13:19.477]  You have your own little table and you're sitting there watching the movie.
[01:13:19.497 --> 01:13:20.357]  It's really nice.
[01:13:20.758 --> 01:13:21.818]  It's their original theater.
[01:13:21.838 --> 01:13:23.978]  They've got a whole bunch of them all over Texas now, so popular.
[01:13:23.998 --> 01:13:25.499]  7 and 10 p.m.
[01:13:25.519 --> 01:13:28.380]  I'll give a little speech beforehand, take a few questions and answer afterwards.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.680]  Have my books and videos out there at the little table.
[01:13:31.701 --> 01:13:36.782]  And then coming up next Wednesday, I guess in about 8-9 days, or 8 days to be precise,
[01:13:38.042 --> 01:13:41.785]  8 p.m., June 8th, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:13:42.846 --> 01:13:46.709]  And there's plenty of parking there, because it's on South Lamar.
[01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:50.252]  They've got a giant, it's a former grocery store, where they put the theater.
[01:13:50.272 --> 01:13:52.133]  There's five screens in there.
[01:13:52.674 --> 01:13:53.874]  We'll be showing on the biggest screen.
[01:13:53.914 --> 01:13:54.355]  Really nice.
[01:13:54.415 --> 01:13:56.036]  I go there every couple of weeks.
[01:13:56.096 --> 01:13:56.957]  I love their theater.
[01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.700]  A warning, a word to the wise.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:07.505]  This Friday screen that you're going to be coming to, the Republic of Texas Biker Rally.
[01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:36.338]  is going to be going on in downtown Austin and so I suggest you use the parking garage right down there's a couple big parking garages like two dollars four dollars don't use the open-air parking where they charge you seven bucks there's also a lot of parking meters but if you can't find parking on a Friday night down there and don't worry they're not scary bikers I mean now bikers are all basically yuppies you know lawyers who just worship their
[01:14:37.088 --> 01:14:40.909]  They're Harley Davidsons, but you will get to see a lot of cool bikes downtown.
[01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:43.350]  But a word to the wise is sufficient.
[01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:52.813]  If you're going to the Friday 7 o'clock or 10 o'clock, you can either park at a parking meter and walk a few blocks, which is always nice to do.
[01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:54.033]  We don't walk enough in America.
[01:14:54.653 --> 01:14:59.695]  Or you can park at one of the high-rise parking garages and save three or four bucks.
[01:15:00.773 --> 01:15:03.235]  And plus they've got security guards and everything else.
[01:15:03.555 --> 01:15:08.398]  Or there's a big parking place, I think it's like five or six bucks, right next to the theater.
[01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:10.540]  They're all over the place.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.240]  You can't miss it.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.882]  But yeah, there's going to be that added expense, but so what.
[01:15:13.902 --> 01:15:16.243]  It's fun to take the messes out downtown.
[01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:22.807]  You can take her to dinner and then go to the 10 o'clock or you can go to the 7 o'clock and eat dinner there and hang out.
[01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:26.890]  Or if you want to miss all the big crowds, you can just come to next Wednesday's showing
[01:15:27.992 --> 01:15:30.033]  I'll look forward to seeing everybody that's coming out.
[01:15:30.073 --> 01:15:31.494]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:15:31.854 --> 01:15:38.097]  Link through to the Alamo Draft House website to the safe, secure area where you can buy tickets.
[01:15:38.478 --> 01:15:39.478]  And I hope to see you there.
[01:15:39.498 --> 01:15:42.180]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Elias.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.201]  Elias, where are you calling us from?
[01:15:44.221 --> 01:15:45.241]  Hello, how are you doing?
[01:15:45.261 --> 01:15:46.482]  Where are you calling us from?
[01:15:46.502 --> 01:15:47.062]  From Michigan.
[01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:47.562]  Welcome.
[01:15:48.103 --> 01:15:49.544]  Yeah, right.
[01:15:50.044 --> 01:15:54.506]  But you know, did he say what his itinerary would be if he comes here to speak?
[01:15:54.786 --> 01:15:55.967]  Is there any way of finding that out?
[01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:02.852]  He doesn't know the itinerary yet, but he said it'd be on that website.
[01:16:03.352 --> 01:16:04.772]  Oh, that's GallowayG?
[01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:06.373]  No, wait a minute.
[01:16:06.453 --> 01:16:07.153]  I didn't write it down.
[01:16:07.233 --> 01:16:08.213]  I don't have it either.
[01:16:08.233 --> 01:16:10.474]  I have his email address.
[01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:12.894]  Well, I'm sure if you type it in, you'll find it.
[01:16:13.214 --> 01:16:14.054]  The Respect Party.
[01:16:14.954 --> 01:16:15.835]  The Respect Party?
[01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:16.855]  Is that what it is?
[01:16:17.615 --> 01:16:17.775]  Yes.
[01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:19.615]  But when I said welcome, you said, yeah, right.
[01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:20.516]  What, you don't think you're welcome?
[01:16:21.396 --> 01:16:22.836]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:23.236 --> 01:16:24.676]  Well, I don't call you much.
[01:16:24.796 --> 01:16:26.577]  I got a bad cold, anyway.
[01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:28.651]  It must sound terrible.
[01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:32.754]  It's a beautiful interview, and the man is a great speaker.
[01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:39.437]  And if he comes here, I hope it is really put out everywhere and people can hear him.
[01:16:40.337 --> 01:16:41.958]  Well, he said he's going to Minnesota.
[01:16:42.418 --> 01:16:49.622]  He must tour this country and try to break down the facade that has been built around this government.
[01:16:50.943 --> 01:16:51.343]  I agree.
[01:16:51.363 --> 01:16:51.983]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:52.663 --> 01:16:53.264]  Great points.
[01:16:53.404 --> 01:16:55.645]  Umar in Michigan, go ahead.
[01:16:56.588 --> 01:17:00.109]  Yeah, my hat goes off to Mr. Galloway.
[01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:04.509]  He's a template of what a statesman or politician should be.
[01:17:04.529 --> 01:17:12.991]  He's not a toady or a bootlicker, and I was on the edge of my seat when he was playing his interview.
[01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:17.612]  I mean, his response to the allegations that was made against him.
[01:17:17.692 --> 01:17:18.072]  Yes.
[01:17:18.492 --> 01:17:23.733]  And Alex, I got the tape going out last weekend to about 106 people.
[01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:28.876]  So, people was really astonished when they seen it.
[01:17:29.617 --> 01:17:30.938]  Oh, you got Martial Law?
[01:17:31.398 --> 01:17:33.861]  No, I got Road to Tyranny.
[01:17:35.262 --> 01:17:36.603]  To me, that's the best thing.
[01:17:36.884 --> 01:17:41.268]  I got Martial Law, but still, the Road to Tyranny, that's the eye opener.
[01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:46.193]  A lot of people are saying Road to Tyranny is as good or better.
[01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:48.215]  I like Martial Law, but...
[01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:50.542]  But I think they're both excellent.
[01:17:50.682 --> 01:17:51.462]  All of them good.
[01:17:51.482 --> 01:17:52.343]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:53.344]  I ain't knocking none of them.
[01:17:53.644 --> 01:17:57.746]  But to me, when they see that road to tyranny, they just do something to them.
[01:17:57.786 --> 01:18:01.389]  But anyway, you keep up the good work.
[01:18:01.429 --> 01:18:03.030]  I'm going to let you get to the rest of your calling.
[01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.771]  Well, Lamar, I appreciate the call.
[01:18:05.391 --> 01:18:06.512]  And then thanks for what you're doing.
[01:18:06.552 --> 01:18:08.093]  I mean, that's why we're really having an effect.
[01:18:08.113 --> 01:18:10.474]  I mean, you made 100 copies plus.
[01:18:11.815 --> 01:18:16.498]  And of half those people, a third of them, 10% of them make copies, and then they make copies.
[01:18:17.825 --> 01:18:18.846]  I mean, I've done the math.
[01:18:19.806 --> 01:18:22.428]  A thousand videos go out, and then it turns into millions.
[01:18:22.528 --> 01:18:24.489]  I mean, because of you, and I can only commend you.
[01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:37.758]  You know, and obviously the Respect Party's made up of liberals and even some socialists, and I don't agree with a lot of what their policies are, but they have told the truth, they have stood up to lies, and you can only commend them.
[01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:40.787]  And I think Galloway's for real.
[01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:45.717]  And regardless, I mean, talk about big government, I mean, George Bush puts the Liberals to shame.
[01:18:46.238 --> 01:18:47.902]  A $2.6 trillion budget.
[01:18:48.543 --> 01:18:49.646]  I'm a Constitutionalist.
[01:18:49.666 --> 01:18:50.227]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:57.941]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:19:53.383 --> 01:19:56.664]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.704 --> 01:20:00.905]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:03.946]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.126 --> 01:20:06.527]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.707 --> 01:20:15.369]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.549 --> 01:20:16.890]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:21.271]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.571 --> 01:20:21.891]  I think so.
[01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:54.854]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:20:55.154 --> 01:20:59.737]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:21:00.077 --> 01:21:02.419]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:21:02.639 --> 01:21:04.180]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.644]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:21:09.944 --> 01:21:11.185]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[01:21:11.245 --> 01:21:13.947]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:20.270]  Right now Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:22:56.161 --> 01:23:02.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.803 --> 01:23:05.764]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:19.187]  You know, there's a reason this broadcast is being attacked by Vanity Fair and Popular Mechanics and American Legion and Front Page Magazine.
[01:23:19.947 --> 01:23:23.708]  Some of them are government ops, some of them are useful idiots, many of them are just media whores.
[01:23:24.403 --> 01:23:27.406]  But the order's gone out to attack Alex Jones, and I love it.
[01:23:28.367 --> 01:23:32.491]  We take that as a major indicator of our growing success against globalist forces.
[01:23:34.073 --> 01:23:36.936]  And there's so many people getting involved, getting involved in the fight.
[01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:39.338]  It's just wonderful.
[01:23:39.378 --> 01:23:45.585]  Coming up, I'm going to re-air the last five minutes of that Galloway interview where he talked about government-sponsored terrorism being a very grave threat.
[01:23:47.285 --> 01:23:53.070]  And then we'll get into all of this other news, aspartame triggers, impotence and blindness, and a lot more.
[01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:56.813]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:23:57.034 --> 01:23:58.575]  Rick in Reno, go ahead.
[01:23:59.696 --> 01:24:02.799]  Alex, will you support a boycott of the major U.S.
[01:24:02.839 --> 01:24:05.301]  media who are blacking out the Downing Street Memo?
[01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:09.965]  Well, again, for those that don't know, the Downing Street Memo came out a few weeks ago.
[01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:26.648]  And we should have covered it more here, we've talked about it some, but it's what we already knew, where they had meetings with Tony Blair's people, the Bush White House did, and they admitted it was all fake, and how to manipulate the public, and it's an admitted public document, and yeah, it's not in our media.
[01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:29.310]  We put their links to the stories, though.
[01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:31.212]  I've said my piece, Alex, thank you.
[01:24:31.812 --> 01:24:36.956]  Yeah, you bet, we need to cover that more, we need to try to force the mainstream media to talk about it.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:45.623]  But their owners own and run the military industrial complex, and they've got a lot to lose if they don't cover that up.
[01:24:46.403 --> 01:24:52.685]  But just one more piece of evidence, and then what they do is they'll plant false evidence in the midst of it, later to try to discredit the whole thing.
[01:24:52.705 --> 01:24:59.328]  There'll be more news coming out from the Army itself about torture and bodily functions on Karans.
[01:24:59.968 --> 01:25:02.809]  But then Newsweek goes, well, we might not have sourced one of our people right.
[01:25:02.829 --> 01:25:03.429]  We're sorry.
[01:25:03.469 --> 01:25:04.030]  We were tracked.
[01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.130]  It's all staged, folks.
[01:25:06.286 --> 01:25:13.031]  And Dick Cheney says, I'm very upset by people, uh, Amnesty International saying that we have a bad record for torture.
[01:25:13.091 --> 01:25:21.136]  Why, that's just... Your own Attorney General put out memos when he was the Chief Advisor to the President saying they're allowed to torture people to death!
[01:25:21.176 --> 01:25:22.537]  His own memos, public!
[01:25:23.758 --> 01:25:23.858]  Ah!
[01:25:24.699 --> 01:25:26.140]  But again, they ignore all that.
[01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:29.782]  Ah, let's go ahead and talk to Fred Marilyn.
[01:25:29.842 --> 01:25:30.543]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:25:30.563 --> 01:25:32.184]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:32.784]  Good.
[01:25:34.105 --> 01:25:35.346]  I just wanted to say that, uh,
[01:25:36.007 --> 01:25:43.414]  I was watching Fox News Saturday night and the propaganda against Iran has definitely begun in full swing now.
[01:25:43.434 --> 01:25:48.939]  They had a special where they were talking about Iran and the nuclear threat on Fox News.
[01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:50.660]  I just wanted to know what you had to say about that.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.042]  Well, the UN, the globalists give us a false choice.
[01:25:53.062 --> 01:25:58.247]  They've already accepted total UN control, thousands of inspectors everywhere, totally peaceful reactors.
[01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.232]  No way it could be used for weapons.
[01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:08.678]  Even if they built a reactor that could give them the fuel, it would take five years, conservatively, to get one bomb.
[01:26:09.519 --> 01:26:11.020]  But that doesn't stop the globalists.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.801]  They say any minute they could attack us.
[01:26:12.821 --> 01:26:18.705]  If they fuel that thing, they could nuke us, and we better invade now, and oh my gosh!
[01:26:19.486 --> 01:26:22.949]  It is utterly and totally ridiculous.
[01:26:23.769 --> 01:26:24.690]  And again, folks,
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:41.311]  They want to take over that entire region, and yeah, but coming up we talk to Galloway, we're going to re-air that last five minutes, and I said, well, they may not have the political will of the people now to invade, but that won't stop the globalists from another 9-11.
[01:26:41.831 --> 01:26:42.431]  Did you hear that?
[01:26:43.372 --> 01:26:43.632]  Oh, yes.
[01:26:43.892 --> 01:26:44.593]  Oh, definitely.
[01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:52.098]  They're going to need a pretext to go on Iran, and so... Yeah, you notice Galloway was saying they couldn't do it until I mentioned that whole new equation.
[01:26:52.819 --> 01:26:53.199]  That's right.
[01:26:55.416 --> 01:26:57.437]  Well, you'll know who has the motive if it happens.
[01:26:57.577 --> 01:26:59.179]  I mean, it's the same old, same old.
[01:27:00.499 --> 01:27:06.864]  Oh, they're even saying they even had a former Israeli pilot on there saying, well, if the United States doesn't attack Israel, we can do it.
[01:27:09.585 --> 01:27:11.527]  You mean if the United States doesn't attack Iran?
[01:27:11.547 --> 01:27:13.128]  I mean, yeah, Iran.
[01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.909]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:16.190]  No, it's horrible.
[01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:19.252]  And then if the Iranians fight back, oh, they're evil.
[01:27:19.372 --> 01:27:21.433]  And again, folks, I love our country.
[01:27:22.054 --> 01:27:23.895]  We're not supposed to operate like this.
[01:27:25.135 --> 01:27:27.537]  Mozadek was anti-communist, pro-America.
[01:27:27.737 --> 01:27:29.979]  Our government went in and removed him, put the Shaw in.
[01:27:30.019 --> 01:27:31.180]  Then we got the Ayatollah.
[01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:37.125]  And, you know, very corrupt country, but compared to the globalists, they're not a threat at all.
[01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.867]  Look at Pakistan with nukes that could hit the U.S.
[01:27:39.947 --> 01:27:41.328]  Oh, but our government's not worried about them.
[01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:42.529]  Look at North Korea.
[01:27:42.569 --> 01:27:43.150]  Look at China.
[01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:43.770]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:44.351 --> 01:27:45.131]  Great points, Fred.
[01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:46.733]  Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:46.773 --> 01:27:47.553]  Don, go ahead.
[01:27:48.794 --> 01:27:49.835]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:49.955 --> 01:27:50.496]  Great talking to you.
[01:27:50.696 --> 01:27:51.036]  Thank you.
[01:27:51.256 --> 01:27:54.499]  And I'm really proud to be standing side-by-side with another great American just like you, sir.
[01:27:55.118 --> 01:27:57.301]  Together I think we can win and we can win peaceably.
[01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:58.782]  We can win peaceably.
[01:27:59.723 --> 01:28:04.308]  Did you catch Bill, Bootlicker Bill O'Malpy's rally on Faux News Network the other night?
[01:28:04.508 --> 01:28:05.909]  No, I don't watch much TV.
[01:28:06.049 --> 01:28:06.650]  I don't blame you.
[01:28:07.091 --> 01:28:09.773]  I didn't mean to either, I just needed a good laugh so I thought I'd watch Faux.
[01:28:10.134 --> 01:28:16.160]  And he's up there saying that he's blathering on about how terrorists could not be allowed to race.
[01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:17.170]  Can I continue?
[01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:18.572]  Because what he's doing is horrible.
[01:28:18.592 --> 01:28:21.714]  But then everybody's a terrorist and none of us are allowed to have rights.
[01:28:21.774 --> 01:28:22.355]  That's right.
[01:28:22.455 --> 01:28:22.815]  I'll tell you what.
[01:28:22.835 --> 01:28:23.696]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:25.937]  I'll re-air five minutes at Galloway and I'll go back to you.
[01:28:25.957 --> 01:28:26.358]  Okay, Don?
[01:28:27.078 --> 01:28:28.239]  Just stay on hold for five minutes.
[01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:31.202]  If you want to be technical, it'll be eight minutes because it's a three-minute break.
[01:28:31.942 --> 01:28:32.563]  Three-minute break.
[01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:41.010]  We'll play what Galloway said in the last five minutes that some of you may have missed from last hour and then we'll go right back to your calls in the news.
[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.470]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.005 --> 01:28:44.888]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:47.015]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.938 --> 01:28:50.626]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:45.516 --> 01:31:47.317]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:32:07.382 --> 01:32:11.725]  Mr. Galloway, during the break I was talking to you.
[01:32:11.745 --> 01:32:20.331]  You're about to collect on $600,000 from your libel slander suit against newspapers that printed these lies.
[01:32:20.371 --> 01:32:24.995]  Yes, $600,000 to me and about, oh, the best part of $3 million to the lawyers.
[01:32:26.035 --> 01:32:28.717]  So the costs and damages have been very great.
[01:32:29.818 --> 01:32:36.523]  Saddam Hussein gave me nothing but the newspapers who alleged that he had are having to pay very dearly for those lies.
[01:32:37.263 --> 01:32:46.691]  And where I can, I will tackle the American outlets that are still peddling these same discredited lies about me.
[01:32:47.212 --> 01:32:53.877]  Unfortunately, these senators made their attack behind the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege.
[01:32:54.317 --> 01:32:56.799]  So I can't sue them for what they said about me.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:58.741]  But I helped demolish it, I think.
[01:32:58.821 --> 01:33:02.564]  It was a house of cards that fell down with a bit of huff and puff from me.
[01:33:02.984 --> 01:33:05.787]  It all fell down because it was based on nothing at all.
[01:33:06.774 --> 01:33:12.735]  But a much more important issue is how we stop this disaster, not just in Iraq, but around the world.
[01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:30.419]  We really have to pull our countries out of this coalition of the killing, because it's making people all over the world hate us, it's damaging our interests, it's endangering our citizens when they travel or when they work and live abroad, and we really have to get out of this nosedive that we are in.
[01:33:31.019 --> 01:33:37.447]  So, I hope that people will look at our website, that's respectcoalition.org, and will stay in touch with me.
[01:33:37.527 --> 01:33:46.297]  Send me, by any means, your email, gallowayg at parliament.uk, and I'll let you know when my speaking tour begins, the big cities I'm going.
[01:33:46.778 --> 01:33:49.942]  One of the main places where there's a huge demand is Minnesota.
[01:33:50.522 --> 01:34:09.136]  Where they used to have an honorable senator called Wellstone, who was mysteriously killed in a plane accident, and who was succeeded by none other than the smarmy Norman Coleman, the man who chaired the Senate McCarthyite witch hunt, into me, the author of the Mother of All Smokescreens.
[01:34:09.596 --> 01:34:11.317]  They said he was a presidential hopeful.
[01:34:11.658 --> 01:34:14.820]  He didn't much look like a presidential hopeful by the time I was finished with him.
[01:34:15.603 --> 01:34:17.925]  Just two more final questions and we're going to let you go.
[01:34:17.945 --> 01:34:20.448]  I know you're very busy and it's evening over there in London right now.
[01:34:21.008 --> 01:34:25.973]  Mr. Galloway, George Galloway, looking at this, you've gotten to Iraq falling apart.
[01:34:27.234 --> 01:34:36.562]  The Pentagon's own P2OG documents, perhaps folks should send this to you, said they want to widen the hatred, cause more attacks as a pretext to invade more countries.
[01:34:36.923 --> 01:34:39.345]  Where do you see this ending and will they go into Iran?
[01:34:40.343 --> 01:34:41.984]  I think they're too weak to do so.
[01:34:42.165 --> 01:34:45.487]  I think the Iraqi resistance has stopped them in their tracks.
[01:34:46.088 --> 01:34:50.711]  Undoubtedly they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:56.115]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[01:34:56.355 --> 01:34:59.097]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[01:34:59.117 --> 01:35:01.299]  They're saying they'll go ahead and attack Iran.
[01:35:01.859 --> 01:35:09.602]  Well, there's an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[01:35:10.042 --> 01:35:14.504]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[01:35:14.884 --> 01:35:17.125]  What if Israel drags us in?
[01:35:17.365 --> 01:35:18.505]  Well, that's a possibility.
[01:35:18.925 --> 01:35:20.306]  Israel might strike Iran.
[01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:27.509]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[01:35:27.569 --> 01:35:29.930]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.850]  Well, I have another article.
[01:35:31.090 --> 01:35:33.771]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[01:35:33.811 --> 01:35:37.553]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[01:35:37.893 --> 01:35:41.734]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[01:35:41.834 --> 01:35:48.577]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[01:35:49.037 --> 01:35:49.337]  Alright.
[01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:50.338]  We got 30 seconds.
[01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:58.724]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack to blame it on them?
[01:36:06.429 --> 01:36:09.350]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:15.333]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[01:36:15.433 --> 01:36:17.574]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[01:36:17.994 --> 01:36:18.614]  Unbelievable!
[01:36:18.914 --> 01:36:24.076]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[01:36:24.096 --> 01:36:25.137]  I salute you!
[01:36:25.417 --> 01:36:26.117]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:27.774 --> 01:36:36.862]  Well, my goodness, we need a vigilant citizenry to foil the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:39.684]  Yes, that's a very real threat.
[01:36:39.744 --> 01:36:48.392]  We need to have a very vigilant citizenry to foil the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:57.435]  What if our military industrial complex carries out an attack, a terrorist attack, to blame it on these countries?
[01:36:59.296 --> 01:37:00.196]  As a pretext.
[01:37:02.357 --> 01:37:02.898]  Amazing.
[01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.799]  I'll tell you what, that is so important.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.881]  I don't know if people heard that.
[01:37:09.101 --> 01:37:11.743]  But we might just hear the last minute of that.
[01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:16.454]  In the third hour, call your friends, call your family, call your neighbors.
[01:37:16.994 --> 01:37:20.877]  You're listening to us on AM or FM, call your local people locally in your area.
[01:37:21.357 --> 01:37:25.860]  Tell them to tune in, because in the next hour I will play that one more time, but just a minute of it, not five minutes of it.
[01:37:27.481 --> 01:37:32.845]  And again, out of this, the UN and the EU and all of them get to look like they're the good guys.
[01:37:32.885 --> 01:37:39.930]  When the same global corporations that own Europe own us, they're using America as their muscle, but still, they then allow it to
[01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:41.709]  Hey, thanks again Alex.
[01:37:41.729 --> 01:37:46.993]  As one of our vigilant citizens, I'm really proud to tell you an idea that I think will help us win, and we can do it peaceably.
[01:38:07.774 --> 01:38:10.235]  All we have to do is, sometimes we write a letter.
[01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:12.355]  Sometimes some of us will make a statement.
[01:38:12.395 --> 01:38:15.816]  Sometimes some of us will post a notice about something, a sign somewhere.
[01:38:16.177 --> 01:38:18.617]  Sometimes some of us will promote a website even.
[01:38:18.637 --> 01:38:20.898]  We'll do something to help with the cause of freedom in a small way.
[01:38:20.938 --> 01:38:24.019]  We need to do this in the form of a question.
[01:38:24.619 --> 01:38:27.980]  Whatever approach we take, make sure we're asking questions.
[01:38:28.413 --> 01:38:31.436]  They're kind of like flipping on lights, which is exposing cockroaches.
[01:38:31.476 --> 01:38:31.976]  They scatter.
[01:38:32.456 --> 01:38:36.740]  You know, that is a way to get people to think, instead of just telling them something, which is also effective.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.402]  Ask, who stands to gain from these terror attacks?
[01:38:39.442 --> 01:38:39.903]  Any question.
[01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:43.446]  Why are our borders still wide open, but we're hearing we're going to have to give up our liberties?
[01:38:43.646 --> 01:38:44.046]  That's right.
[01:38:44.126 --> 01:38:48.470]  And every question puts fear in the hearts and what's left of the souls of these murderers.
[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:51.993]  Why is Bush pro-gun control and have a budget much bigger than Bill Clinton's biggest?
[01:38:52.033 --> 01:38:53.014]  How is that conservative?
[01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.235]  That's the next question.
[01:38:54.276 --> 01:38:57.380]  Why is he appointing pro-abortion individuals to high courts?
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.641]  Okay, you see my point then.
[01:38:59.022 --> 01:39:00.744]  It's gonna work and we can win peaceably.
[01:39:00.764 --> 01:39:03.267]  The questions are like bullets of love.
[01:39:03.768 --> 01:39:04.669]  We want to expose things.
[01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:05.230]  We want to shoot.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.440]  Don, I agree with you, and again I salute you as well.
[01:39:34.017 --> 01:39:36.739]  Jason in Kansas, go ahead.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.683]  I was in Colorado Residence just visiting Kansas, as a matter of fact.
[01:39:42.164 --> 01:39:44.125]  Okay, well you told us Kansas, so go ahead.
[01:39:44.585 --> 01:39:46.267]  No, that's fine.
[01:39:46.487 --> 01:39:50.790]  That was just a segue into my point that I was making in Nevada.
[01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:58.576]  I believe it was House Bill, or Senate Bill 89, and state legislature passed with regards to
[01:40:00.493 --> 01:40:17.261]  A mandatory database tracking of vaccinations for all children is the guide they put it under with regards to... And there's no law, you've got to take these, but they act like there is in a database, and I was aware of that law, but they're trying to pass all over the states, federally funded.
[01:40:17.622 --> 01:40:20.443]  That database then sets up the precursor to make it the law.
[01:40:21.092 --> 01:40:36.278]  Yeah, and I'm suspecting that Denver being a rather large city in and of itself, and it's pure speculation, but I think that might have something to do with the... Well, they've had Top Off 1 and Top Off 2 there.
[01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:39.559]  Quote, controlled terror was the ABC News headline.
[01:40:39.999 --> 01:40:40.960]  Conditioning the public.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.480]  I've had your mayor on.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.481]  Who was the female?
[01:40:43.521 --> 01:40:44.081]  I forget her name.
[01:40:44.813 --> 01:40:46.355]  I had her on a few years ago.
[01:40:46.375 --> 01:40:50.619]  She said, oh yeah, we practice putting people in the sports stadiums.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:56.625]  Your governor was in the Rocky Mountain News three years ago saying they've got huge incinerators ready.
[01:40:57.906 --> 01:41:00.329]  That was in the Rocky Mountain News, by the way.
[01:41:01.378 --> 01:41:16.029]  Well, I was watching, uh, uh, Masters of Terror, I think it was, where you, uh, quoted somebody saying that, uh, that there was going to be another terrorist attack in Denver, Cleveland, and, uh, another city was actually going to be, uh... I think that was police state three total enslavement.
[01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:16.930]  That was Gary Hart.
[01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:27.860]  Well, I was just thinking about that and putting together the fact that they just passed the legislation with regards to keeping track of a database.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:30.601]  It's going on there, but it's also going on all over the 50.
[01:41:30.741 --> 01:41:32.582]  In the lower 48 particularly.
[01:41:35.394 --> 01:41:49.686]  Another thing, just a real comment, I was at 1360 out there at KHNC, former affiliate of yours, and I think it was Jill Harrison had a show with a gentleman that was talking about the origin of
[01:41:50.387 --> 01:41:51.308]  Smallpox.
[01:41:51.968 --> 01:41:54.871]  And it visually originated from bed bugs.
[01:41:54.911 --> 01:42:05.460]  I didn't even catch the whole thing because as soon as he started talking about how smallpox originated or whatever, the broadcast cut out and I couldn't get anything on the radio station.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:06.000]  Interesting.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.401]  Alright, well thanks for the call.
[01:42:08.643 --> 01:42:12.706]  Smallpox in third world, open sewer, 100 degree heat.
[01:42:13.647 --> 01:42:14.948]  It needs heat to really move.
[01:42:16.975 --> 01:42:22.978]  Only about, what, 30% of people even get infected with it, and of those, it's an even lower number die.
[01:42:24.179 --> 01:42:38.185]  And the so-called smallpox vaccine that they were going to force 11 million government workers, state, federal, firefighters, EMS, police, sheriffs, deputies, 11 million of them, they ordered them to take it three years ago.
[01:42:39.165 --> 01:42:40.806]  And the LA Times reported that 99.8% said no
[01:42:44.477 --> 01:42:47.158]  I remember talking to cops, you know, in the gas station.
[01:42:47.218 --> 01:42:47.859]  I'm not taking it!
[01:42:47.919 --> 01:42:48.599]  Y'all heard about it!
[01:42:48.639 --> 01:42:51.080]  We're not ever... Our union's saying, Nuh-uh!
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:51.720]  Nuh-uh!
[01:42:52.221 --> 01:42:52.681]  Nuh-uh!
[01:42:52.881 --> 01:42:55.062]  Because all these doctors went public and went, wait a minute!
[01:42:56.222 --> 01:42:59.724]  This smallpox shot will actually spread smallpox, because it's live.
[01:42:59.764 --> 01:43:03.606]  It'll actually cause real smallpox cases, when we've eradicated it.
[01:43:04.286 --> 01:43:08.148]  And all the doctors were going public, the epidemiologists and virologists, and were going, look!
[01:43:09.219 --> 01:43:11.740]  This doesn't protect you from weaponized smallpox!
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.140]  It doesn't do anything!
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:22.882]  You know, it's like forcing our troops to take experimental anthrax vaccines, which, if something's experimental, even if you've signed a military contract, they can't tell you to slit your wrist or blow your head off or jump off a cliff.
[01:43:24.323 --> 01:43:36.465]  The federal law says, even with troops or federal workers, and they've still got all their rights, but troops supposedly waive some, that it's a federal felony every time you order somebody to take something that's experimental.
[01:43:36.586 --> 01:43:38.426]  You have to sign a form saying, I agree.
[01:43:39.255 --> 01:43:40.957]  Well, they didn't even have them sign the forms.
[01:43:40.977 --> 01:43:42.358]  They just said, do it or you go to jail.
[01:43:42.418 --> 01:43:43.278]  And some did go to jail.
[01:43:44.419 --> 01:43:48.623]  Pregnant women who refused, women who were breastfeeding who refused, were arrested.
[01:43:48.663 --> 01:43:50.304]  I mean, put in stockades.
[01:43:51.365 --> 01:43:56.310]  Some of the Air Force bases, over a third of the pilots were no-fly and kicked out.
[01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.911]  And some were court-martialed.
[01:43:58.992 --> 01:44:01.034]  When the law said they didn't have to take it.
[01:44:01.674 --> 01:44:03.816]  And then it didn't even protect them on top of it.
[01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:06.890]  You gotta ask, why did they do that?
[01:44:06.931 --> 01:44:14.276]  Well, Admiral Crowe and others on Bioport that was getting all the contracts on making the vaccine, and then finally, what was it, seven times?
[01:44:14.876 --> 01:44:22.482]  On the seventh time, they finally got shut down by the FDA because of all these chemicals and bacteria and fungus in their vaccine.
[01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:26.645]  On top of it, I mean, deadly, deadly, deadly stuff!
[01:44:27.646 --> 01:44:29.127]  I mean, people would take it and die!
[01:44:30.168 --> 01:44:34.451]  They made all the Bioport workers take it, and some had seizures, some collapsed,
[01:44:35.256 --> 01:44:44.127]  One person in two weeks got of a bizarre autoimmune disturbance that the coroner then linked with a local epidemiologist to the shot.
[01:44:44.147 --> 01:44:48.312]  You know, where they got the shot all swelled up and pus was squirting out of it.
[01:44:50.655 --> 01:44:51.216]  I mean, folks!
[01:44:52.049 --> 01:44:54.910]  Again, Viagra, linked to going blind now.
[01:44:55.451 --> 01:45:07.496]  Obviously, folks, you take something that manipulates your circulation, the first place you're going to get circulatory manifestations is going to be in your appendages, your fingers and toes, and in your eyeballs!
[01:45:09.016 --> 01:45:12.518]  Something that increases pressure is not good for you.
[01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:14.879]  It's like these ads for drugs.
[01:45:16.165 --> 01:45:22.889]  Fifty-five seconds of how great it is, and five seconds of may cause heart attacks and bloating, disturbances, cancer, depression, suicide.
[01:45:22.909 --> 01:45:26.111]  You know, just in five seconds they'll spew like twenty things and more.
[01:45:26.131 --> 01:45:28.873]  Read more of it, and then they'll give you their website that lists a hundred things.
[01:45:29.573 --> 01:45:32.875]  I mean, the inserts with these drugs, you ought to read them online.
[01:45:33.695 --> 01:45:36.237]  It'll show the molecule and what's in it.
[01:45:37.237 --> 01:45:45.022]  And the hundreds of things with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and now they're coming out with a new class of drugs that affect two or three chemicals in the brain, not just one base chemical.
[01:45:46.365 --> 01:45:48.987]  Aspartame triggers impotence and blindness.
[01:45:49.007 --> 01:45:49.688]  Here's another one.
[01:45:50.208 --> 01:45:52.910]  ABC News reports today the FDA is looking into blindness.
[01:45:53.831 --> 01:45:55.512]  The FDA doesn't have to look far.
[01:45:56.433 --> 01:46:01.757]  Change in sexual function is listed on the FDA report of 92 symptoms of aspartame.
[01:46:02.197 --> 01:46:05.880]  Vision loss and blindness is so commonly triggered by aspartame.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.301]  It's the sixth on the list.
[01:46:08.542 --> 01:46:12.545]  If you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand when you put a drug on the market,
[01:46:14.426 --> 01:46:22.610]  Which is also addictive, that liberates free methyl alcohol and affects the vision.
[01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:31.274]  In aspartame, the methanol converts to formaldehyde and formulaic acid in the retina of the eye and destroys the optic nerve.
[01:46:31.374 --> 01:46:37.237]  Remember how many thousands went blind and died during Prohibition because of the use of wood alcohol, methanol.
[01:46:38.135 --> 01:46:46.679]  So many went blind on aspartame and had seizures and in 86 the Community Nutrition Institute in 86 petitioned the FDA to ban aspartame.
[01:46:46.699 --> 01:46:48.259]  The FDA hadn't made them.
[01:46:48.279 --> 01:46:49.860]  The drug chemical industry refused.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:52.801]  And then they link through in this Betty Martini.
[01:46:52.821 --> 01:46:53.702]  I've got to get her back on.
[01:46:53.722 --> 01:46:54.662]  I haven't had her on in years.
[01:46:55.042 --> 01:46:59.284]  She links through to the ABC News report about, you know, what they're admitting.
[01:47:00.244 --> 01:47:01.585]  But we just trust this government.
[01:47:02.445 --> 01:47:06.207]  I'm going to break and come back and take a few calls, but I want to spend two minutes
[01:47:09.221 --> 01:47:11.002]  Well, I may have to spend longer than that on this.
[01:47:11.543 --> 01:47:13.404]  Remembering my little chihuahua.
[01:47:14.385 --> 01:47:16.267]  But there is a moral to the story.
[01:47:16.287 --> 01:47:19.369]  You know, I have two chihuahuas and a Boston Terrier.
[01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:33.040]  And Conan, about five years ago, before I was married, my wife got Conan, and Conan had been in a puppy mill.
[01:47:34.941 --> 01:47:38.344]  Eighty-seven dogs, or something like that, in one cage.
[01:47:38.931 --> 01:47:40.652]  He was a concentration camp victim.
[01:47:40.672 --> 01:47:42.613]  I remember seeing him when she had him.
[01:47:43.634 --> 01:47:52.899]  And she fed him, got him back healthy, and she was going to get him to my grandmother, because my grandfather had just gone to the nursing home, but he would hide under the bed so she couldn't take him.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.002]  And he turned into the most spunky, intelligent little dog in the last five years.
[01:47:59.062 --> 01:48:04.285]  I mean, doing little tricks, running around happy, afraid of nobody, you know, big dogs came in the yard.
[01:48:05.632 --> 01:48:08.613]  Furrow out of the fence and chase him and hang off their lips.
[01:48:08.633 --> 01:48:11.514]  I mean, he was a funny guy and I really loved him.
[01:48:12.774 --> 01:48:15.355]  And I kept putting wire under the fence and trying to block it up.
[01:48:15.455 --> 01:48:16.595]  It was almost a daily occurrence.
[01:48:16.635 --> 01:48:17.275]  He'd dig out.
[01:48:18.075 --> 01:48:19.536]  Well, we could hardly put him in the backyard.
[01:48:20.036 --> 01:48:29.779]  But lately, he hadn't been digging out, so I left him in the backyard Sunday morning and went around the hike and bike trail, you know, with the kids in the jogging stroller with my wife.
[01:48:30.779 --> 01:48:34.620]  We got home and there was a neighbor out front and they said, the other neighbors got your dog.
[01:48:35.891 --> 01:48:40.073]  He was out front and some lady wanted to catch him and bring him back to whoever his owner was.
[01:48:40.093 --> 01:48:48.896]  He was running around on the sidewalk and basically one of the joggers chased him out onto the main road and somebody just plowed him under.
[01:48:48.976 --> 01:48:51.537]  I mean, poor little thing was flapping like a pancake.
[01:48:51.597 --> 01:48:52.918]  It was really sad burying him.
[01:48:53.658 --> 01:48:54.779]  I did give him a kiss though.
[01:48:54.799 --> 01:48:57.500]  I love him.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.442]  But he was a success story and a survivor and I guess he only got to live about
[01:49:03.302 --> 01:49:05.424]  He was about six months old when we got him, eight months old.
[01:49:05.444 --> 01:49:07.346]  So I guess he got to live about five and a half years.
[01:49:09.407 --> 01:49:15.373]  And I tell you, that dog's death hurt me, because I guess in your mind it's like a baby, because they're little and sweet, and they give you kisses.
[01:49:16.674 --> 01:49:17.595]  But it was like a baby.
[01:49:18.115 --> 01:49:21.018]  I have just been, I can't help it, I've been crying a lot about it.
[01:49:21.858 --> 01:49:24.260]  And thinking I could have done more, should have done more.
[01:49:25.782 --> 01:49:27.964]  But, you know, that's what happens when dogs dig out.
[01:49:29.598 --> 01:49:33.760]  It makes you think how short life is and how people you love can be snuffed out so quickly.
[01:49:34.121 --> 01:49:36.823]  So tell them you love them today, whether they're a dog or a human being.
[01:49:38.224 --> 01:49:44.608]  And it made me think about all the other people I love who've died, human beings, and other dogs that have died.
[01:49:44.628 --> 01:49:48.411]  Friends long gone, I've had a lot of dreams about them the last two nights.
[01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:49.912]  But God bless you, Coco.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:58.242]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.422 --> 01:50:02.844]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.004 --> 01:50:07.385]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.405 --> 01:50:08.746]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.566 --> 01:50:10.507]  Panama.
[01:50:10.547 --> 01:50:14.769]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.829 --> 01:50:21.772]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.892 --> 01:50:23.953]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.253 --> 01:50:34.678]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.899 --> 01:50:35.739]  If you want to understand

[01:53:01.852 --> 01:53:03.754]  But think about normal people.
[01:53:03.835 --> 01:53:08.240]  You know, we've all got evil in us, we've got problems, but we have a conscience.
[01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:09.802]  We have a love.
[01:53:09.822 --> 01:53:11.144]  I mean, I love that little dog.
[01:53:12.005 --> 01:53:14.769]  I love my family so much more, it's unfathomable.
[01:53:16.027 --> 01:53:17.088]  The globalists don't care.
[01:53:17.148 --> 01:53:27.376]  They'll let hundreds of thousands of people get HIV and hepatitis knowingly for a decade, shipping out tainted blood from prisoners from people they know have those diseases, knowingly!
[01:53:27.396 --> 01:53:30.258]  They'll knowingly let our troops breathe depleted uranium.
[01:53:30.278 --> 01:53:33.180]  They'll knowingly put drugs on the market they know hurt people.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:38.124]  They'll knowingly put genetically modified food out that kills rats en masse.
[01:53:39.364 --> 01:53:40.846]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:53:41.866 --> 01:53:45.349]  They know that they just have no conscience, no nothing.
[01:53:47.156 --> 01:53:50.578]  And that's who we're facing, and it takes people that have got a little bit of decency in them.
[01:53:51.699 --> 01:53:55.841]  Lord knows it's been almost driven out of all of us in today's society to stand up against these people.
[01:53:56.102 --> 01:53:56.942]  And to tell them no!
[01:53:57.542 --> 01:54:01.925]  To protect the lives that really matter of our children and grandchildren and their children to come.
[01:54:02.566 --> 01:54:03.906]  Because the globalists are pure evil.
[01:54:04.127 --> 01:54:08.029]  Just very briefly, then I'm going to go to Charles and Tim and others, and we've got a guest coming up too.
[01:54:09.450 --> 01:54:11.771]  About the AIDS in the blood.
[01:54:13.272 --> 01:54:14.413]  Finally hitting mainstream news.
[01:54:16.454 --> 01:54:21.338]  Before I do that, my new film, Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[01:54:21.879 --> 01:54:22.940]  It's my best work yet.

[01:54:31.067 --> 01:54:36.392]  I believe it's my best film.
[01:54:36.432 --> 01:54:42.798]  It covers 9-11, the police state, and who the global star and what their driving ideologies are, how they're part of the cult of death, literally.
[01:54:44.735 --> 01:54:47.957]  And you can get the film as low as $14 when you get multiple copies.
[01:54:47.977 --> 01:54:49.877]  We've got a bunch of different specials going right now.

[01:55:50.304 --> 01:55:51.465]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:55:51.485 --> 01:55:52.166]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:55:52.746 --> 01:55:54.768]  Mr. Jones, I'm sorry about your two hours.
[01:55:56.034 --> 01:55:56.595]  I really am.
[01:55:56.615 --> 01:56:00.098]  I remember you called about five years ago and said you had a chihuahua.
[01:56:00.338 --> 01:56:00.719]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:00.779 --> 01:56:01.780]  I sent you a picture of it.
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:02.501]  That's right.
[01:56:02.541 --> 01:56:04.042]  You and your wife and the chihuahua.
[01:56:04.062 --> 01:56:04.182]  Yes.
[01:56:05.123 --> 01:56:05.744]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:05.804 --> 01:56:06.324]  I know how it is.
[01:56:06.344 --> 01:56:07.746]  That was hanging up at my old office.
[01:56:07.766 --> 01:56:08.606]  I don't know where it is now.
[01:56:09.207 --> 01:56:11.049]  Well, it's like losing a baby, you know?
[01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:12.931]  I really feel bad for you.
[01:56:14.102 --> 01:56:15.203]  It'll be alright, my friend.
[01:56:15.223 --> 01:56:21.286]  Oh, listen, I wanted to ask you, is Mr. Galloway, is he going to go from state to state in the United States talking, or...?
[01:56:21.746 --> 01:56:27.389]  Oh, I think he'll visit a bunch of misguided liberals that don't understand the full paradigm, but it sounds like he gets the whole picture.
[01:56:27.689 --> 01:56:29.530]  Yes, he does, and that was a wonderful interview.
[01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:31.951]  You know, Carl Schwartz is doing the same thing.
[01:56:31.991 --> 01:56:33.332]  I think he's in London right now.
[01:56:34.235 --> 01:56:34.615]  Up there.
[01:56:35.436 --> 01:56:37.358]  But Mr. Jones, I wanted to ask you this question.
[01:56:37.378 --> 01:56:41.642]  Do you think we're getting ahead of them, we're winning, we're slowing them down?
[01:56:42.062 --> 01:56:42.643]  Well, I know this.
[01:56:42.683 --> 01:56:43.464]  We don't have a choice.
[01:56:43.584 --> 01:56:47.607]  I know we're holding them back to a certain extent.
[01:56:47.647 --> 01:56:49.669]  I mean, they're still pushing us back, but slower.
[01:56:49.689 --> 01:56:53.933]  It'd be like a train off the side of a cliff, or like a glacier.
[01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:58.678]  Would you rather have it move slowly like a glacier, incrementally, or like over the side of a cliff?
[01:56:59.338 --> 01:57:00.139]  Well, like a glacier.
[01:57:01.494 --> 01:57:05.055]  Well, believe me, if you weren't out there doing what you're doing, Charles, things would be a lot worse.
[01:57:05.235 --> 01:57:07.315]  I want to just remind people about the tapes again.
[01:57:07.355 --> 01:57:08.296]  It does make a difference.
[01:57:08.336 --> 01:57:09.536]  I'm making a difference down here.
[01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:14.957]  And if people, if they would just pass one or two tapes out, these other people could pass one or two tapes.
[01:57:15.217 --> 01:57:16.138]  This is the way to do it.
[01:57:16.178 --> 01:57:17.418]  The tapes are the way to do it.
[01:57:17.678 --> 01:57:21.999]  And I ask people, please, please, for their country, get the tape and make a few tapes.
[01:57:22.899 --> 01:57:24.760]  And I want to thank you, Mr. Jones, for what you're doing.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:25.900]  Well, thank you, Charles.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:26.600]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:29.621]  I'm not defending the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:57:30.586 --> 01:57:32.207]  But do you know how they brought down the Shaw?
[01:57:33.487 --> 01:57:34.608]  Audio cassettes.
[01:57:35.368 --> 01:57:36.588]  Everybody making copies.
[01:57:37.789 --> 01:57:39.290]  It's mucho powerful.
[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:44.172]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.214 --> 01:57:50.874]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.514 --> 01:57:52.515]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.286 --> 01:57:54.387]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.028 --> 01:57:55.868]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.609 --> 01:57:57.510]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.530 --> 01:58:01.833]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.374 --> 01:58:06.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.018 --> 01:58:12.682]  Alright folks, we're now into hour number three.
[01:58:14.674 --> 01:58:18.815]  Coming up in just a few minutes, Canadian Red Cross use HIV blood.
[01:58:19.255 --> 01:58:32.198]  The Red Cross in Canada is put guilty to distributing contaminated blood, supplies which infected thousands of Canadians with HIV and Hepatitis C. More than 3,000 people have died since getting the tainted blood in the 1980s.
[01:58:33.198 --> 01:58:37.059]  And the blood scandal is widely regarded as one of the worst public health disasters in Canadian history.
[01:58:37.079 --> 01:58:38.380]  It was also shipped in the U.S.
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:39.580]  out of Arkansas.
[01:58:40.365 --> 01:58:48.168]  And also all over Europe, and it came out years ago in the Australian press that they knew what was in it.
[01:58:49.028 --> 01:59:02.812]  And they certified it out of the Arkansas prisons, and Clinton's buddies made tens of millions, and they knew that the jail guards would sell the drugs to the people who had the HIV, who would then sit out there once a week giving blood, they looked like scarecrows.
[01:59:03.333 --> 01:59:04.373]  We have the doctor on,
[01:59:05.282 --> 01:59:08.904]  He was Firebomb, by the way, who was a doctor of prosthesis.
[01:59:09.585 --> 01:59:11.186]  Or prosthetics, I don't know what the term is.
[01:59:11.666 --> 01:59:15.769]  But he, you know, artificial limbs, there in this mega prison in Arkansas.
[01:59:16.489 --> 01:59:19.371]  And he saw this and wrote a book about it.
[01:59:20.411 --> 01:59:22.753]  And then got death-threatened and firebombed and other nice things.
[01:59:22.773 --> 01:59:30.237]  He got firebombed the same night the Hemophiliac Society got robbed of their blood files on this.
[01:59:30.317 --> 01:59:33.439]  We're going to be talking to the head of the Canadian Hemophiliac Society.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.303]  Coming up here in a few minutes, Tim in Ohio.
[01:59:37.323 --> 01:59:38.445]  Go ahead, Tim, you're on the air.
[01:59:38.805 --> 01:59:39.546]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.389]  Hello?
[01:59:41.609 --> 01:59:42.170]  Yes, hmm?
[01:59:43.131 --> 01:59:50.281]  Uh, you were bringing up the, uh, the SBAR team again, and, uh, just want to remind everyone that it was our pal, old, uh, Ronnie Dumsfeld.
[01:59:50.970 --> 01:59:51.910]  That was working for G.D.
[01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:52.670]  Searle at the time.
[01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:59.992]  Nuclear reactors in North Korea, weapons to Saddam, Searle with aspartame, genetically modified crops, Terminator genes.
[02:00:00.272 --> 02:00:02.633]  He is really a dark lord of the Sith.
[02:00:03.013 --> 02:00:16.936]  What's interesting about that is it was like 20 years that aspartame was trying to be approved and they could never get it approved until he put in his own boy, Dr. Arthur Hall Hayes, who actually had it approved and when he got out of there he went to work for Monsanto.
[02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:18.320]  From the FDA.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.762]  And Searle was a division of Monsanto.
[02:00:21.002 --> 02:00:21.302]  Right.
[02:00:21.983 --> 02:00:24.525]  And you know something that I noticed last year?
[02:00:24.865 --> 02:00:31.290]  The labels on the popular chewing gum, Double Mint, Wrigley's, Juicy Fruit, the labels changed.
[02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.312]  The color and the diagram on them.
[02:00:34.313 --> 02:00:36.174]  I flipped over back just out of curiosity.
[02:00:36.855 --> 02:00:39.697]  Sugar, gum base, blah blah blah, aspartame.
[02:00:39.737 --> 02:00:43.040]  And I'm thinking, why would a product... Here's the problem.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.181]  The first ingredient is sugar.
[02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:46.623]  Six years ago, the patent ran out.
[02:00:47.424 --> 02:00:48.365]  On Aspartame.
[02:00:49.145 --> 02:00:59.533]  And so now it's not just one company, now over 9,000 foods on the average store shelf has it and they don't even have to list it anymore.
[02:00:59.933 --> 02:01:02.715]  Right, but what's interesting is they're listing an artificial sweetener
[02:01:03.271 --> 02:01:05.813]  In a product whose main ingredient was sugar.
[02:01:06.093 --> 02:01:09.496]  Well that's because it's something like 200 times sweeter and much cheaper.
[02:01:10.017 --> 02:01:12.499]  So they can put a little bit of sugar just so you see that first.
[02:01:12.519 --> 02:01:14.921]  And then the main ingredient is aspartame.
[02:01:15.261 --> 02:01:28.472]  And then to follow up on that I noticed about three or four weeks after that there was a report on Fox News about how children who chew gum in school do better.
[02:01:28.905 --> 02:01:29.566]  So there they go.
[02:01:29.606 --> 02:01:30.867]  They get the changeover.
[02:01:31.267 --> 02:01:37.012]  And they encourage all the kids to 2-2-2.
[02:01:37.032 --> 02:01:38.393]  Get that aspartame in your brain.
[02:01:38.633 --> 02:01:42.676]  And the thargic learning process continues.
[02:01:42.936 --> 02:01:47.280]  Well, did you ever hear of that CBS piece we aired that aired nationally but this was a local note of it?
[02:01:48.321 --> 02:01:50.182]  That mercury is actually good for your brain.
[02:01:50.222 --> 02:01:50.782]  It's nutritious.
[02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:51.203]  That's right.
[02:01:51.223 --> 02:01:52.304]  Delicious and nutritious.
[02:01:53.084 --> 02:01:54.966]  Part of this nutritious morning breakfast.
[02:01:55.406 --> 02:01:57.408]  It's actually a very delicious heavy metal for you.
[02:01:58.248 --> 02:02:03.431]  Doesn't matter if it's the most deadly heavy metal to brain neurons, but doesn't matter if we have all the major scientific reports.
[02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:04.072]  Just shut up!
[02:02:04.092 --> 02:02:04.872]  You're with Al-Qaeda!
[02:02:05.412 --> 02:02:06.373]  Are you against the government?
[02:02:06.753 --> 02:02:08.114]  Aspartame is delicious.
[02:02:08.534 --> 02:02:09.555]  Mercury is delicious.
[02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:13.291]  Terminator seeds taken over the crops.
[02:02:13.712 --> 02:02:16.833]  Rats dying from the corn that's got jammed.
[02:02:16.913 --> 02:02:17.994]  It's just good for you, okay?
[02:02:18.294 --> 02:02:22.696]  And to remind people, too, they can donate early their own blood if they want to go into surgery.
[02:02:23.116 --> 02:02:25.697]  And I would never take any other's blood if I could help it.
[02:02:26.018 --> 02:02:28.479]  How many people have died from blood transfusions?
[02:02:28.599 --> 02:02:30.400]  Arthur Ashe.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:31.600]  Arthur Ashe, the tennis player.
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.201]  I was about to say, so many people.
[02:02:34.182 --> 02:02:37.183]  Roll up your sleeve, we got some poison for you from the prison.
[02:02:37.623 --> 02:02:39.104]  Ha ha ha, it's sick.
[02:02:39.755 --> 02:02:40.495]  It's so evil!
[02:02:45.637 --> 02:02:47.177]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.357 --> 02:02:50.438]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.578 --> 02:02:54.460]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:58.761]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.101 --> 02:03:02.882]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.002 --> 02:03:04.803]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.403 --> 02:03:08.307]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:13.052]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.232 --> 02:03:16.275]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:19.319]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.799 --> 02:03:25.926]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.446 --> 02:03:30.249]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:50.901 --> 02:04:51.962]  You wear deodorant, right?

[02:04:53.063 --> 02:04:55.925]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.105 --> 02:05:00.969]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.229 --> 02:05:02.310]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:03.590]  It's called No B.O.

[02:05:07.854 --> 02:05:09.435]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.

[02:05:51.485 --> 02:05:52.545]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.265 --> 02:05:54.366]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.026 --> 02:05:55.886]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.586 --> 02:05:57.527]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.167 --> 02:06:02.068]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.348 --> 02:06:06.469]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:12.550]  John Flader is our guest.
[02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:18.872]  He is the spokesman for the Canadian Hemophilia Society.
[02:06:20.326 --> 02:06:47.183]  And try as they may, the government, the establishment media cannot cover up the fact that for eight years, after it was illegal in Arkansas, and after everybody knew that they were shipping tainted blood from people they knew had HIV, from people they knew, understand, from people they knew had hepatitis and all of this,
[02:06:47.944 --> 02:06:49.986]  They would sell them the drugs right there in the prison.
[02:06:50.006 --> 02:06:52.508]  They'd go out every week, give blood, which you're not supposed to be able to do.
[02:06:53.028 --> 02:06:54.429]  News of this got out around the country.
[02:06:54.449 --> 02:06:57.652]  It was illegal, but Bill Clinton would have the blood certified as good and wholesome.
[02:06:58.232 --> 02:07:03.377]  And it was shipped to Canada, shipped through a company there, shipped to Europe, shipped here in the U.S.
[02:07:03.457 --> 02:07:05.819]  It was used all over the place out of Arkansas prisons.
[02:07:06.239 --> 02:07:11.123]  Other prisons were doing it before that, and it caused a major scandal, and Arthur Rash, and all those people died.
[02:07:12.156 --> 02:07:14.177]  But, I mean, tens of thousands died.
[02:07:14.197 --> 02:07:14.958]  This has been horrible.
[02:07:14.998 --> 02:07:21.622]  You're in a car wreck, you survive the car wreck, but you die five years later of hepatitis, ten years later of HIV.
[02:07:21.782 --> 02:07:22.683]  It is horrible!
[02:07:23.844 --> 02:07:26.145]  Absolutely, unbelievably horrible.
[02:07:26.245 --> 02:07:31.149]  And now there's a big report here out of the BBC, Canadian Red Cross use HIV blood.
[02:07:31.469 --> 02:07:33.030]  It's come out in Australia, they knew.
[02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:34.651]  They knew it and still did it.
[02:07:35.211 --> 02:07:37.253]  And so, joining us is John Plater.
[02:07:37.853 --> 02:07:39.054]  John, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:07:39.414 --> 02:07:40.275]  Pleasure to be here, Alex.
[02:07:40.874 --> 02:07:48.962]  For those who don't know about this nightmare saga that I haven't covered in years, though I should have, there's so many of these nightmares out there.
[02:07:50.263 --> 02:07:55.247]  Let's go over some of the history of this, and then I want out-of-the-gates people to know that the Red Cross was robbed and raided.
[02:07:55.788 --> 02:08:01.133]  You guys were robbed and raided the same night that you guys were raided, about five years ago, six years ago.
[02:08:03.203 --> 02:08:12.967]  Michael Golster, the practitioner of prosthesis, the medical man who first blew the whistle on this, watching it in Arkansas State Pens, he got firebombed that same night.
[02:08:12.987 --> 02:08:21.211]  Some very nice people running this, but just go over the scandal itself and how it's affected you and others, and then let's get into what's happened.
[02:08:21.491 --> 02:08:25.213]  Well, it's a huge scandal up here in Canada, and there's a whole lot of different levels.
[02:08:25.273 --> 02:08:26.694]  The Arkansas is probably
[02:08:27.845 --> 02:08:34.329]  Of all the different problems that went on, it's probably the most egregious situation we had.
[02:08:34.389 --> 02:08:55.762]  Essentially, what you had was, as you described it, a situation down there in Arkansas in a prison where the company that was charged with providing medical services to the inmates, at the same time, was on the back end taking blood donations from those inmates and selling it.
[02:08:56.859 --> 02:09:02.125]  Um, and it's just incredible as we, you know, over the years learned of what went on down there.
[02:09:02.165 --> 02:09:07.691]  It turns out individuals were, uh, individual inmates were actually running the program for them.
[02:09:08.051 --> 02:09:11.415]  They were the ones managing the documents, recording who was giving blood.
[02:09:11.996 --> 02:09:14.959]  And of course, uh, our understanding is that, uh, prison,
[02:09:15.877 --> 02:09:24.115]  Uh, basically, guys were donating blood to get money to get the basics for themselves, and so it really meant a lot to get the money through that program.
[02:09:24.336 --> 02:09:25.378]  And for those who don't know...
[02:09:27.239 --> 02:09:36.208]  We've got the cases like John Arpaio out in Arizona where 65 cents a day, basically rotten bologna and cheese sandwiches.
[02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:45.858]  If inmates want any decent food, any money to call family, they've got to quote, work in the prison industry that's normally private now, competing against the rest of our jobs.
[02:09:46.218 --> 02:09:56.903]  But in this case, it's blood, it's fluids, and the doctor, uh, Galster described, or the medical practitioner, we should say, described these open-air tents with the people giving blood every week.
[02:09:56.943 --> 02:09:57.664]  It was a nightmare.
[02:09:58.084 --> 02:09:58.484]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:58.504 --> 02:10:04.567]  I mean, it's one thing if they're hammering out, uh, license plates or something, but, uh, I mean, this stuff was turned around.
[02:10:05.027 --> 02:10:08.069]  Of course, as you said, it was illegal by the end of it.
[02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:12.391]  It was illegal to do it in the States, but they came up with a scheme where they were able to, uh,
[02:10:13.058 --> 02:10:16.441]  Delivered to a blood broker working in the Montreal area.
[02:10:16.461 --> 02:10:17.581]  Knowing her!
[02:10:17.601 --> 02:10:18.282]  Now let's make this clear!
[02:10:18.302 --> 02:10:21.945]  By a local company in Canada and turned into products used for hemophiliacs.
[02:10:21.965 --> 02:10:22.565]  Yeah, I'll repeat that.
[02:10:22.605 --> 02:10:23.206]  I interrupted you.
[02:10:23.586 --> 02:10:24.647]  I'll repeat the chain of events.
[02:10:25.327 --> 02:10:37.857]  The blood went in through a blood broker in the Montreal area and then in turn we understand that it was bought by a company in the Toronto area who turned it into blood products that hemophiliacs used.
[02:10:38.257 --> 02:10:42.340]  The scary thing is that all you needed is one prisoner to donate
[02:10:43.362 --> 02:10:43.822]  I think so.
[02:11:00.296 --> 02:11:05.998]  At the end of the day, they only needed one prisoner donating to potentially contaminate thousands of hemophiliacs.
[02:11:06.038 --> 02:11:15.160]  Now, subsequently, we learned, obviously, there were lots of inmates that were Hep C and probably HIV positive donating through the time period.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:25.783]  And the scary thing is, up on our end, I mean, people, if I remember correctly, you know, they looked on the form at the bottom of the page and saw that blood came from ADC.
[02:11:26.103 --> 02:11:26.723]  No one asked.
[02:11:27.478 --> 02:11:28.778]  What the heck is ADC?
[02:11:29.018 --> 02:11:30.699]  Well, Arkansas Department of Corrections.
[02:11:31.679 --> 02:11:33.439]  That's the kind of craziness that went on.
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:35.200]  Well, let me make something clear.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:40.221]  I interviewed Michael Golster, the prosthesis medical man.
[02:11:40.621 --> 02:11:52.464]  I interviewed others who were there at the prison witnessing this, and he described it as a lot of the homosexual inmates, too, or the punks, as they're properly called in the prison.
[02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:55.545]  Sorry for that term, but that's what they're called, who had, you know,
[02:11:56.892 --> 02:11:59.273]  Not just HIV, but AIDS.
[02:12:00.254 --> 02:12:01.915]  Full-blown were in there doing this.
[02:12:02.075 --> 02:12:06.898]  And what this shows is a premeditated callousness.
[02:12:07.238 --> 02:12:12.521]  It was illegal to be taking blood out of the prisons, but they still did it, and then were so cheap.
[02:12:13.101 --> 02:12:29.043]  Didn't even test the blood to maximize product sales, and then this went on for my documents for eight years after it was illegal, and that shows just the unconscionable, bottomless pit of... I mean, that is...
[02:12:30.192 --> 02:12:32.454]  That is hellish!
[02:12:32.594 --> 02:12:33.795]  How could you do that?
[02:12:34.196 --> 02:12:42.542]  I mean, I am guilty when I'm rude to my neighbor, or rude to my wife, or when I don't block up the hole under the fence and my chihuahua gets hit by a car.
[02:12:42.943 --> 02:12:45.565]  I mean, I'm grieving and guilty!
[02:12:45.905 --> 02:12:49.088]  These people can murder tens of thousands and they just think it's fun!
[02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:51.790]  Well, I mean, it's certainly incredible.
[02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:56.694]  I know we had a full-blown inquiry into the whole situation, and that's where
[02:12:57.219 --> 02:13:04.465]  You know a lot of it, we started to learn bits and pieces about this and then of course Gollister brought out a lot of the story.
[02:13:04.845 --> 02:13:10.390]  Our understanding is right now there's an ongoing RCMP investigation into the whole situation.
[02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:23.401]  We just yesterday actually had the Canadian Red Cross plead guilty to an unrelated, well it's not completely unrelated, but to a charge under our Food and Drugs Act for distributing
[02:13:23.979 --> 02:13:24.799]  I don't think so.
[02:13:37.836 --> 02:13:46.218]  Criminal cases involving a pharmaceutical company and some doctors up here, but we're really looking forward to what the RCMP is going to come up with.
[02:13:46.238 --> 02:13:47.498]  And that's your federal police?
[02:13:47.878 --> 02:13:48.619]  Yep, that's right.
[02:13:48.939 --> 02:13:49.599]  The Mounties?
[02:13:49.959 --> 02:13:50.919]  The Mounties, yeah.
[02:13:50.979 --> 02:14:03.102]  What about two years ago, I don't have it in front of me but my memory is pretty good, it was in the ABC Australia and several others, the Age and others, where they caught the Red Cross knowingly distributing tainted blood.
[02:14:03.682 --> 02:14:11.991]  Well, I mean, all around the world, the one thing with this story is to stay on top of it is virtually impossible.
[02:14:12.011 --> 02:14:13.552]  They get caught and they don't stop!
[02:14:13.732 --> 02:14:18.457]  There's so much stuff going on all over the world and it's big business.
[02:14:18.677 --> 02:14:25.204]  One of the problems is for years and years and years the public just assumed that it's do-gooder volunteerism.
[02:14:26.630 --> 02:14:29.533]  I guess down in the states you had more of the paid-for system.
[02:14:29.553 --> 02:14:30.614]  We didn't have that in Canada.
[02:14:30.634 --> 02:14:33.476]  Well, take the Red Cross here in the United States.
[02:14:33.536 --> 02:14:44.326]  They got record amounts of blood, and even after their refrigerators were filled and they were throwing it directly in the trash, after 9-11 they were still getting it, and selling it hand over fist to blood brokers.
[02:14:44.647 --> 02:14:48.070]  So you're just giving blood so they can then go sell it.
[02:14:48.130 --> 02:14:49.411]  It's such a scam.
[02:14:49.671 --> 02:14:52.334]  You know, my grandfather had some really rare type of blood, I forget.
[02:14:52.794 --> 02:14:57.518]  But he was always getting calls at midnight to come give some young kid blood that had been in a car wreck and he always did it.
[02:14:57.758 --> 02:15:02.842]  They take all these well-meaning people, take our blood and dump it into a big soup of contaminated blood!
[02:15:03.623 --> 02:15:08.907]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's something that we all have to be constantly vigilant about.
[02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:18.475]  I know here in Canada we've taken the whole blood system away from the Red Cross a number of years ago and set up two organizations that manage it now.
[02:15:19.082 --> 02:15:25.167]  Yeah, but you know, we're constantly watching, making sure that they've got the right screening processes in place.
[02:15:25.187 --> 02:15:26.528]  Hey, I mean this when I say it.
[02:15:26.868 --> 02:15:29.210]  We can show some of these companies knowingly did this.
[02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:32.153]  Shouldn't they be brought up on trial, given life imprisonment?
[02:15:32.373 --> 02:15:40.419]  Well, in fact, this November we've got a criminal trial against a company called Armor Pharmaceuticals.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:43.402]  And what they did is they knowingly distributed
[02:15:44.625 --> 02:15:47.086]  Hemophilia products that had not been heat treated.
[02:15:47.266 --> 02:15:52.189]  We discovered in the 80's that you could actually heat the stuff up and kill whatever was in it.
[02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:54.610]  But they used a process they knew didn't work.
[02:15:55.871 --> 02:16:02.355]  And even though, you know, their own internal scientists said, hey guys, we shouldn't be sending this stuff out the door.
[02:16:02.375 --> 02:16:08.858]  And for those who don't know, they'll take hundreds of ounces of blood to make one shot for hemophiliac with a clotting agent, correct?
[02:16:09.118 --> 02:16:10.999]  Well, they pool it.
[02:16:11.059 --> 02:16:12.380]  So what happens is they'll take
[02:16:12.813 --> 02:16:19.782]  You know, 10,000 donors, pool the whole thing, extract what we're looking for, and then ship it out to thousands of hemophiliacs.
[02:16:20.342 --> 02:16:21.424]  So that's what's scary.
[02:16:21.843 --> 02:16:24.244]  You take one person out of that 10,000 donors.
[02:16:24.264 --> 02:16:26.706]  You only need one infected unit.
[02:16:27.106 --> 02:16:28.086]  That's the whole batch.
[02:16:28.386 --> 02:16:29.527]  But here's the incredible thing.
[02:16:29.547 --> 02:16:32.529]  I mean, nobody knows more about this than you because you're up there at the tip of the spear.
[02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:34.069]  I want to say this again.
[02:16:34.130 --> 02:16:35.350]  They're not stopping.
[02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:37.391]  These people continue to do this.
[02:16:37.911 --> 02:16:42.634]  Well, I mean, in Canada, we've got, I mean, I can't speak altogether for the states.
[02:16:42.674 --> 02:16:46.356]  We've got, you know, pretty strict rules about screening, you know.
[02:16:47.049 --> 02:16:53.193]  And recent diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, we screen people out from that.
[02:16:53.253 --> 02:17:01.678]  If you've been in Britain in the last few years because of the whole mad cow scare, we won't let you donate up here.
[02:17:02.178 --> 02:17:09.883]  The beauty for hemophiliacs in Canada is actually most of us have access to a new technology that has virtually no blood in it.
[02:17:10.712 --> 02:17:12.993]  And it's a synthetic product.
[02:17:13.113 --> 02:17:15.014]  You're a hemophiliac, sir?
[02:17:15.394 --> 02:17:15.634]  Sorry?
[02:17:16.055 --> 02:17:16.855]  Are you a hemophiliac?
[02:17:16.975 --> 02:17:19.176]  Yeah, I have severe factor A hemophilia.
[02:17:19.516 --> 02:17:22.738]  So, you know, for hemophiliacs up here, it's much safer.
[02:17:22.798 --> 02:17:30.001]  Now, I know you've got guys down in the States there that are still, you know, forced to purchase the cheaper product that is made directly from blood.
[02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:35.244]  And although they do everything they can to screen stuff out and to kill anything that's in it,
[02:17:35.931 --> 02:17:40.240]  You know, not everybody down there to my understanding has access to better stuff.
[02:17:40.841 --> 02:17:42.264]  Please stay with us, sir.
[02:17:42.284 --> 02:17:43.748]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:48.590]  You've heard it over and over again.
[02:20:48.811 --> 02:20:51.273]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[02:20:51.613 --> 02:20:55.276]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[02:20:55.576 --> 02:21:00.440]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.

[02:21:40.906 --> 02:21:43.708]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:48.212]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:48.792 --> 02:21:51.654]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:53.076 --> 02:22:00.522]  We have a member of Parliament, George Galloway, who annihilated the Senate's propaganda about the food for oil scam.
[02:22:01.652 --> 02:22:06.874]  I'm going to air just a minute of that from the first hour when we get back from break.
[02:22:06.954 --> 02:22:14.737]  Our final segment here with John Plater, and he's a spokesman for the Canadian Hemophilia Society.
[02:22:14.777 --> 02:22:17.378]  I want to get this on record, the type of mafia we're dealing with.
[02:22:18.258 --> 02:22:25.921]  This was, what, five, six years ago, but a firebombing the same night in Little Rock of the medical man who exposed all this, a large note of it,
[02:22:26.545 --> 02:22:29.186]  You guys get robbed, and then the Red Cross gets robbed.
[02:22:29.906 --> 02:22:31.587]  Go over that Forest Police.
[02:22:32.327 --> 02:22:36.408]  Well, I mean, it's hard to know exactly what was going on that night.
[02:22:36.508 --> 02:22:42.090]  Obviously, you know, there was a lot of focus in those days on the situation down there.
[02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:49.012]  Mr. Goldster was making some pretty significant allegations, and the strange thing is, at the time,
[02:22:49.685 --> 02:22:52.726]  I don't think most people could believe it because it was so outlandish.
[02:22:52.806 --> 02:23:11.515]  I mean, there you had the governor of the state who went on to become the president of your country, overseeing a prison system that had a company that was providing health services, at the same time had a contract to take blood donations
[02:23:12.077 --> 02:23:14.338]  From the prisoners and sell them offshore.
[02:23:14.518 --> 02:23:16.278]  And was one of his biggest contributors.
[02:23:16.418 --> 02:23:17.079]  Exactly.
[02:23:17.119 --> 02:23:24.421]  I mean, our understanding is that the board of directors of that company was well populated by people that turned up later.
[02:23:24.441 --> 02:23:29.243]  And so, you know, it was it was quite the thing.
[02:23:29.323 --> 02:23:39.866]  And, you know, in legal terms, because I'm a lawyer on the other side of my life, you know, circumstantial evidence, but pretty strange that we'd have, you know,
[02:23:40.805 --> 02:23:43.607]  The significant events all happened on the same night.
[02:23:43.627 --> 02:23:53.432]  It's not like it was just roving people, you know, breaking in, looking for, uh, you know, cheap computers or... I read in the Globemail... You know, they were looking for files.
[02:23:53.532 --> 02:23:57.494]  They took all the files that were on this blood case and some computers and phones, correct?
[02:23:57.514 --> 02:24:02.097]  Stuff that was, yeah, stuff that was, you know, clearly relevant to the stuff we're doing, we're talking about.
[02:24:02.157 --> 02:24:04.778]  Very professional, and then firebombed him at the same time.
[02:24:04.838 --> 02:24:07.160]  Yeah, no, that was, that was the scariest thing.
[02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:08.100]  I mean... Multinational!
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.701]  He was fearing for his life.
[02:24:10.879 --> 02:24:11.840]  As I understand it.
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.562]  Oh yeah, I talked to him later and he wouldn't do interviews.
[02:24:14.602 --> 02:24:15.602]  He said, look, I'm done with this.
[02:24:15.702 --> 02:24:16.683]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:16.983 --> 02:24:19.365]  Multinational though, that's quite powerful.
[02:24:19.625 --> 02:24:20.205]  Well, sure.
[02:24:20.285 --> 02:24:21.766]  I mean, you know, that's the thing.
[02:24:21.847 --> 02:24:24.849]  Blood, blood crosses borders in a big way.
[02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:32.934]  And if you look sort of, you know, around the world at the history of blood and the sale of blood, you know, some scary stuff has gone on.
[02:24:32.994 --> 02:24:34.715]  How has this affected you personally?
[02:24:34.895 --> 02:24:40.079]  Well, I, you know, I was about 18, I guess, when my mother called me.
[02:24:40.999 --> 02:24:41.499]  I think so.
[02:24:41.559 --> 02:24:41.960]  I think so.
[02:25:04.779 --> 02:25:05.780]  We're good to go!
[02:25:28.414 --> 02:25:30.336]  And I've lost a lot of friends.
[02:25:30.676 --> 02:25:32.878]  How many hemophiliacs have died?
[02:25:32.958 --> 02:25:39.063]  We know over 400 up here, and that's over 50% of the people that were, of the hemophiliacs that were infected.
[02:25:39.103 --> 02:25:41.686]  But 3,000's in the BBC today.
[02:25:41.786 --> 02:25:44.288]  That's people with transfusions and hemophilia.
[02:25:45.157 --> 02:25:46.158]  So that's everybody.
[02:25:46.258 --> 02:25:48.639]  But worldwide, I've read it's in the tens of thousands.
[02:25:48.879 --> 02:25:50.140]  Oh, yeah, I mean, who knows?
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:50.900]  Who knows?
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:52.841]  Because, I mean, this is all over Europe.
[02:25:52.861 --> 02:25:55.102]  This is a situation in Japan.
[02:25:55.122 --> 02:25:56.823]  They had a terrible circumstance.
[02:25:56.843 --> 02:25:57.683]  Well, I'm surprised.
[02:25:57.744 --> 02:26:00.645]  I mean, he really... Now, you're fighting him now as a lawyer.
[02:26:00.665 --> 02:26:02.906]  You're going to be in court exposing these creatures today.
[02:26:03.126 --> 02:26:08.549]  Well, I mean, I actually am not doing too much on the professional side myself, because you know what?
[02:26:08.629 --> 02:26:10.170]  Frankly, I don't have the energy.
[02:26:10.891 --> 02:26:11.771]  To keep up with it.
[02:26:11.851 --> 02:26:12.591]  Oh, I misunderstood.
[02:26:12.651 --> 02:26:18.833]  During the break, you were saying you were going to be in court, so... Well, yeah, I try to get there to observe everything, that's for sure.
[02:26:18.853 --> 02:26:20.933]  I mean, are you angry at these people?
[02:26:20.993 --> 02:26:22.394]  I mean, they knew what they were doing.
[02:26:22.614 --> 02:26:23.934]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[02:26:24.194 --> 02:26:25.995]  I mean, now I am.
[02:26:26.115 --> 02:26:28.775]  In the early days, I just thought it was a terrible mistake.
[02:26:29.355 --> 02:26:30.656]  You know, something had gone wrong.
[02:26:31.216 --> 02:26:35.557]  Are you able to fathom or grasp the cold-bloodedness of these people?
[02:26:36.966 --> 02:26:39.347]  That's what scares you at the end of the day.
[02:26:40.127 --> 02:26:46.450]  I was standing there in front of the courthouse yesterday after the Red Cross here had pled guilty to what they'd done.
[02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:56.734]  You just can't believe that people responsible for people's health would disregard obvious, obvious signs.
[02:26:57.432 --> 02:27:00.736]  And not do what they were supposed to do, and that led to people's death.
[02:27:00.796 --> 02:27:02.698]  Well, what about genetically modified foods?
[02:27:02.738 --> 02:27:03.719]  Depleted uranium?
[02:27:04.159 --> 02:27:04.760]  Aspartame?
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:05.080]  Surge?
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:05.841]  It's everything!
[02:27:05.881 --> 02:27:06.842]  They just do this!
[02:27:07.162 --> 02:27:08.904]  This is standard operating procedure!
[02:27:09.184 --> 02:27:16.532]  Well, it's, I mean, it's certainly a reminder to us as individuals that we've got to be ever vigilant about what's going into our bodies.
[02:27:17.032 --> 02:27:19.674]  Oh, it's going out of our bodies to some degree too, huh?
[02:27:19.694 --> 02:27:21.876]  Well, John, I want to commend you for coming on.
[02:27:21.896 --> 02:27:23.697]  I hope to get you back on as this develops.
[02:27:24.097 --> 02:27:25.418]  John Plater, God bless you.
[02:27:25.618 --> 02:27:26.139]  Thank you very much.
[02:27:26.159 --> 02:27:27.560]  Hold on, the website for your society.
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.160]  Sorry?
[02:27:28.581 --> 02:27:29.341]  Yeah, your website.
[02:27:29.701 --> 02:27:35.005]  www.hemophilia... Stay there, we'll plug it afterwards.
[02:27:35.425 --> 02:27:35.726]  Thanks.
[02:27:36.226 --> 02:27:37.147]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.607 --> 02:27:39.228]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.129 --> 02:27:42.811]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:45.743 --> 02:28:51.985]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.105 --> 02:28:58.267]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.547 --> 02:29:06.930]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:14.298]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.558 --> 02:29:19.403]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.623 --> 02:29:25.029]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:28.413]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.753 --> 02:29:36.678]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.758 --> 02:29:37.338]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.061 --> 02:29:49.464]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[02:29:49.604 --> 02:29:53.287]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[02:29:53.467 --> 02:29:59.512]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[02:29:59.752 --> 02:30:06.838]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[02:30:06.978 --> 02:30:10.821]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[02:30:11.201 --> 02:30:14.143]  That God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one.
[02:30:14.403 --> 02:30:17.205]  And that we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor.
[02:30:17.385 --> 02:30:21.887]  Christ promises to grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in his mercy.
[02:30:22.108 --> 02:30:27.210]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[02:30:27.431 --> 02:30:31.413]  I'm offering you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about divine mercy.
[02:30:31.653 --> 02:30:32.074]  We're good to go.
[02:30:57.151 --> 02:30:58.112]  Alright, one more time.
[02:30:58.152 --> 02:30:59.533]  I'll air just a few minutes.
[02:30:59.573 --> 02:31:01.155]  Coming up in a second.
[02:31:01.175 --> 02:31:02.176]  We're not going to go through it right now.
[02:31:02.196 --> 02:31:12.445]  I thought that Member of Parliament George Galloway today, when I brought up the war with Iran that's looming, and he said, well, they don't have the political power to do it now.
[02:31:12.505 --> 02:31:15.268]  I said, what if we have government-sponsored terrorism?
[02:31:15.308 --> 02:31:16.629]  And his answer was unbelievable.
[02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:19.292]  Then we'll go to Robert and Richard and a few others.
[02:31:19.612 --> 02:31:21.594]  I've got a bunch of news I want to run down as well.
[02:31:23.391 --> 02:31:47.282]  But talking to that poor hemophiliac, who's taken charge, become a lawyer, you know, involved with the Hemophilia Society, her spokesman, you can go to their website and learn more about this travesty, this horrible pit of evil that we're witnessing here, this premeditated mass murder by going to www.hemophilia.ca
[02:31:49.273 --> 02:31:59.962]  h-e-m-o-p-h-i-l-i-a dot c-a or just type in Hemophilia Society of Canada or type in they're paid off here in the U.S.
[02:32:00.123 --> 02:32:01.784]  to a certain extent.
[02:32:02.365 --> 02:32:16.777]  One of the biggest power brokers, globalist up in Canada is involved in all this and I saw the articles years ago and had all the experts on for just a few cents more per bag of blood, what six ounces of blood
[02:32:17.902 --> 02:32:19.583]  Just a few cents, not even a quarter.
[02:32:20.143 --> 02:32:28.666]  They could have tested it, and then just to be safe, heated it, and basically homogenized it before they extracted the platelets.
[02:32:29.987 --> 02:32:32.828]  But that doesn't happen.
[02:32:32.848 --> 02:32:35.869]  And we're not allowed to have the new medical break frees here in America.
[02:32:35.909 --> 02:32:45.013]  We pay the highest prices for pharmacological compounds, drugs, of any country in the world, and then everybody else gets it for free or almost nothing.
[02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:49.512]  And then we don't even get access to it, as you heard him talking about all the new things that are out there.
[02:32:49.552 --> 02:32:53.315]  But the reason I got into this today is because more and more of it's coming out.
[02:32:53.335 --> 02:32:56.117]  They're pleading guilty to knowingly doing this.
[02:32:57.018 --> 02:33:01.521]  The Red Cross is an absolutely evil organization.
[02:33:03.202 --> 02:33:06.745]  Again, I keep using the word unfathomable, the term unfathomable.
[02:33:06.805 --> 02:33:10.388]  I mean, it's a black pit that is bottomless.
[02:33:13.015 --> 02:33:16.976]  I told you not to give them money and blood on 9-11, because it doesn't go to the people.
[02:33:17.516 --> 02:33:18.216]  And that came out.
[02:33:19.217 --> 02:33:24.318]  I mean, on Oklahoma City, they went and told the local post offices, oh, let us collect the money for the people.
[02:33:24.658 --> 02:33:27.279]  They forged names on the checks, took the cash for themselves.
[02:33:27.559 --> 02:33:29.679]  Because people see a widow on TV, send her a check for $10,000.
[02:33:29.759 --> 02:33:32.340]  By the way, they were convicted of this.
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:33.560]  Civilly.
[02:33:34.161 --> 02:33:34.741]  Found guilty.
[02:33:34.761 --> 02:33:37.221]  Paid like a $15 million settlement to different people.
[02:33:38.062 --> 02:33:39.242]  We had them on a few years ago.
[02:33:40.453 --> 02:33:49.839]  But, I mean, criminal folks, I mean, they'll just, from the top down, they will just take your checks and forge them and whatever and take the blood if somebody needs it and sell it to somebody else.
[02:33:50.119 --> 02:33:51.500]  They won't test it, nothing.
[02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:55.162]  They are evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.
[02:33:56.183 --> 02:34:02.086]  But it's Bill Clinton and it's these companies and the Red Cross is nothing compared to these people.
[02:34:04.227 --> 02:34:04.848]  And it goes
[02:34:05.791 --> 02:34:07.132]  To everything we're talking about.
[02:34:07.152 --> 02:34:11.074]  I mean, you notice that our guest, a Member of Parliament, talked about eternal vigilance.
[02:34:11.154 --> 02:34:12.775]  Our other guest talked about eternal vigilance.
[02:34:13.196 --> 02:34:14.717]  I guess that's kind of the impromptu.
[02:34:14.757 --> 02:34:18.899]  We always have a theme, really, that emerges on every broadcast, but today, very clearly.
[02:34:20.781 --> 02:34:26.384]  You're dealing with globalists that do not care about you, and actually enjoy killing you.
[02:34:26.884 --> 02:34:31.287]  They like particularly painful deaths, and they love killing their servants.
[02:34:31.327 --> 02:34:32.508]  They love
[02:34:33.507 --> 02:34:42.009]  The fact that our troops are well-meaning, deep-hearted, good people that want to defend America, and they love having them live in bases they bomb with DU.
[02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:45.949]  They love giving them experimental injections, sometimes 50 a year.
[02:34:46.449 --> 02:34:48.970]  They love putting them on food stamps.
[02:34:49.330 --> 02:34:54.091]  They love, after you've served 10 years, force re-upment, bringing you back in.
[02:34:54.431 --> 02:35:00.212]  They love putting out this poisonous GM food, spreading and taking over all the other base crops.
[02:35:00.672 --> 02:35:11.518]  They love putting sodium fluoride in the water that is so deadly and attacks your key endocrines and key hormones in the brain that destroy pleasure and life.
[02:35:11.978 --> 02:35:14.459]  They absolutely hate the human spirit.
[02:35:14.479 --> 02:35:16.100]  They absolutely hate beauty.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.120]  They hate love.
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:17.921]  They rebel.
[02:35:18.521 --> 02:35:22.343]  They try to one-up each other for who is the most dark and evil and wicked.
[02:35:23.726 --> 02:35:24.587]  They get off on it.
[02:35:24.627 --> 02:35:29.511]  They see it as weak that we get sad when our Chihuahua gets run over.
[02:35:29.971 --> 02:35:33.374]  They see it as weakness when we lay our lives down for others.
[02:35:33.694 --> 02:35:35.936]  They see it as weakness that we won't lie.
[02:35:36.316 --> 02:35:40.259]  They see it as weakness that we, uh, they are sick!
[02:35:42.361 --> 02:35:44.362]  They love darkness.
[02:35:44.402 --> 02:35:51.168]  They believe it's their right to rule us because they are ruthless and they execute and operate this evil every day against us.
[02:35:51.943 --> 02:35:53.144]  Stop being so naive.
[02:35:53.164 --> 02:35:54.786]  Let me tell the cops out there something.
[02:35:55.226 --> 02:36:00.150]  I know most of you aren't bad men and women, but you work for a criminal government, and it does do some good.
[02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:02.692]  You know, rat poison is 98% food.
[02:36:02.732 --> 02:36:04.674]  Well, you're half rat poison, half grain.
[02:36:05.295 --> 02:36:06.736]  You know, the decon rat poison.
[02:36:07.376 --> 02:36:08.758]  You think you're doing so good.
[02:36:08.818 --> 02:36:14.783]  Believe me, you track what you're doing, you look at the big picture, you're destroying this country by following unconstitutional orders.
[02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:18.921]  And that goes for the government bureaucrats, and the people in the legislatures, and all of you.
[02:36:19.221 --> 02:36:38.032]  You know, you guys in the legislatures, the state legislature, you might be millionaires, and you're a big, fancy legislator in the Texas legislature, or you're a legislator in the Missouri legislature, or you're a big, fancy guy, you drive a big old Cadillac, and you got a boathouse, and you got money, and you got a mistress, and you got all this stuff, and you wink-wink, do whatever the
[02:36:39.346 --> 02:36:45.291]  Lobbyist comes in and tells you to do and then your grandson who's a hemophiliac gets this shot and dies.
[02:36:45.632 --> 02:36:46.813]  That's a real case I know about.
[02:36:48.094 --> 02:36:54.760]  You go along with this stuff and your granddaughter's in the army and gets given that injection that makes her come down with an advanced cancer.
[02:36:55.641 --> 02:36:56.982]  Unknown to humans before now.
[02:36:57.717 --> 02:37:07.143]  You know, you go along with all this, and you feel good about it, and you drink your Diet Coke and laugh at me and say it isn't bad for you, and you drink your sodium fluoride, you enjoy it.
[02:37:07.523 --> 02:37:09.084]  You know, you're all being judged too!
[02:37:11.286 --> 02:37:12.767]  I mean, just stop it!
[02:37:12.887 --> 02:37:14.488]  Stop the insanity here!
[02:37:16.689 --> 02:37:21.832]  I'm just old stock, old breed country boy from Texas.
[02:37:21.852 --> 02:37:22.633]  That's all I am.
[02:37:23.672 --> 02:37:30.715]  You know, I come from the caveman types who just as much, you know, have a gunfight with you than have an argument with you.
[02:37:32.096 --> 02:37:33.956]  You know, I'm an old-fashioned guy.
[02:37:33.976 --> 02:37:34.897]  That's what I come from.
[02:37:35.377 --> 02:37:36.518]  And I can see it straight.
[02:37:36.558 --> 02:37:39.699]  I can see it straight for what it is and how you can't see it.
[02:37:39.759 --> 02:37:40.999]  How you live in denial!
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:46.822]  Tens of thousands of hemophiliacs worldwide and they knew exactly
[02:37:47.648 --> 02:37:50.429]  And not just the hemophiliacs, they were hardest hit per capita.
[02:37:50.829 --> 02:37:52.630]  And there's all the other tens of thousands.
[02:37:53.891 --> 02:37:57.012]  How many famous people go get a blood transfusion and die from it?
[02:37:58.072 --> 02:38:01.113]  They knew, they knew, it was illegal and they knew.
[02:38:02.214 --> 02:38:04.975]  And they kept shipping the blood out and certifying it as wholesome.
[02:38:05.915 --> 02:38:08.536]  Because they wanted to make a little more money!
[02:38:11.017 --> 02:38:12.098]  It's unbelievable!
[02:38:13.877 --> 02:38:15.398]  Money is the root of all evil.
[02:38:15.658 --> 02:38:17.699]  It's not evil itself, it's the root of it.
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:20.261]  The love of money is the root of all evil.
[02:38:20.581 --> 02:38:21.081]  The love.
[02:38:21.101 --> 02:38:31.647]  When you'll set money up, I know people who would do anything to get ahead, do anything to be a hot shot, do anything to be loved, do anything to have power and power over others.
[02:38:31.987 --> 02:38:32.747]  I can't stand it.
[02:38:32.807 --> 02:38:34.168]  I can't stand responsibility.
[02:38:34.488 --> 02:38:37.610]  I can't stand having to go around and defend people 24 hours a day.
[02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:39.311]  But you know what?
[02:38:39.391 --> 02:38:41.452]  I do have a driving desire to do it,
[02:38:42.254 --> 02:38:46.636]  But at the same time, it's enjoyable at certain levels, but not at others.
[02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:48.778]  I wish the world wasn't like this.
[02:38:49.678 --> 02:38:51.759]  But I can't stand power and authority.
[02:38:52.099 --> 02:38:54.401]  And once these people get power and authority, they hate it.
[02:38:54.921 --> 02:38:57.542]  So they think, oh, the answer is, let's get more power and authority.
[02:38:57.822 --> 02:38:58.743]  That'll make it good.
[02:39:00.564 --> 02:39:03.305]  They would sell their grandmother out for a stick of bubblegum.
[02:39:03.325 --> 02:39:04.626]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:39:04.966 --> 02:39:06.267]  Everybody that buys my videos.
[02:39:09.605 --> 02:39:11.366]  After about a year, we don't even keep the record.
[02:39:11.606 --> 02:39:12.447]  It just gets shredded.
[02:39:12.487 --> 02:39:15.609]  But some people say it's the wrong order, or there's a problem, so we keep it.
[02:39:16.169 --> 02:39:20.572]  I've been offered tens of thousands of dollars to sell the list.
[02:39:21.233 --> 02:39:22.253]  And it's not a conspiracy.
[02:39:22.313 --> 02:39:24.915]  It's just to other, quote, conservative groups that want to have a mailing list.
[02:39:25.215 --> 02:39:27.097]  And I say no, and they go, well, why won't you?
[02:39:27.117 --> 02:39:28.037]  Everybody else does.
[02:39:28.497 --> 02:39:30.459]  Because I have my morals.
[02:39:30.599 --> 02:39:32.420]  Money means absolutely nothing to me.
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:34.902]  It is something to put in my gas tank.
[02:39:35.762 --> 02:39:36.102]  That's all.
[02:39:36.163 --> 02:39:36.723]  It's like fuel.
[02:39:37.506 --> 02:39:38.606]  Money means nothing.
[02:39:38.666 --> 02:39:40.707]  It means I can keep my employees hired.
[02:39:40.947 --> 02:39:43.448]  Maybe I can get a bigger office so I can have some interns in here.
[02:39:43.708 --> 02:39:46.289]  I get offered every day, you know, great interns that want to come to help us.
[02:39:46.729 --> 02:39:47.949]  But I can't because I don't have enough money.
[02:39:49.050 --> 02:39:50.370]  Money means nothing.
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:51.390]  Zero to me.
[02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:54.771]  And frankly, it means succulent enchiladas, okay?
[02:39:55.792 --> 02:39:56.852]  I mean, you know, that kind of stuff.
[02:39:56.892 --> 02:40:02.754]  I mean, it means money and possessions aren't bad in and of themselves.
[02:40:02.874 --> 02:40:07.155]  But when you'll set everything aside, when that's all that matters to you,
[02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:09.251]  Is status and power.
[02:40:10.613 --> 02:40:11.794]  You are totally lost.
[02:40:11.894 --> 02:40:14.536]  What matters is blood, sweat and tears.
[02:40:14.576 --> 02:40:15.837]  What matters is family.
[02:40:16.118 --> 02:40:17.579]  What matters is civilization.
[02:40:17.619 --> 02:40:20.322]  What matters is God and following his plan.
[02:40:20.742 --> 02:40:22.764]  Not selling your own species out.
[02:40:23.365 --> 02:40:24.786]  And the globalists think they're strong.
[02:40:24.806 --> 02:40:26.908]  They think they're the elite because they are missing
[02:40:27.754 --> 02:40:28.434]  Their souls.
[02:40:28.915 --> 02:40:30.636]  They're missing their conscience.
[02:40:31.276 --> 02:40:33.537]  And so they think they're the survival of the fittest.
[02:40:33.578 --> 02:40:38.440]  They think that they're the social Darwinist executing, you know, Mother Nature's will on us.
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:39.381]  This is their MO.
[02:40:39.861 --> 02:40:43.363]  Because we're so dumb and aren't ruthless like them, we deserve what's happening to us.
[02:40:44.564 --> 02:40:46.745]  A species that destroys the biosphere.
[02:40:47.085 --> 02:40:49.087]  A species that chews into its own guts.
[02:40:49.447 --> 02:40:52.729]  A species that tries to dumb down its own species.
[02:40:53.533 --> 02:41:01.399]  We're dealing with a subspecies of predators of our own species, basically trying to dumb us down and turn us into mindless cattle they can more easily feed on.
[02:41:01.779 --> 02:41:05.002]  That is not an advancement of the species, that is cancer!
[02:41:05.662 --> 02:41:11.546]  That is a disease, that is a virus, rushing through the flesh of humanity, killing it!
[02:41:11.947 --> 02:41:13.448]  And I'm just a white blood cell!
[02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:18.011]  I am just a sheep dog.
[02:41:18.892 --> 02:41:20.193]  I'm not a wolf, I'm not a sheep.
[02:41:21.074 --> 02:41:22.875]  I love Mark Kornke's analogy using this.
[02:41:24.517 --> 02:41:25.598]  I get angry at the sheep.
[02:41:25.738 --> 02:41:26.960]  I want them to be sheep dogs.
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:33.086]  I hate watching them baa, baa, and bray and bay and be let off by the wolves.
[02:41:33.927 --> 02:41:35.088]  It's very frustrating.
[02:41:36.089 --> 02:41:37.391]  And I want at the wolves.
[02:41:38.312 --> 02:41:39.973]  I want at them so bad I can taste it.
[02:41:40.614 --> 02:41:43.357]  And I'm tired of watching them get away with all the things they do.
[02:41:45.179 --> 02:41:46.100]  I've had enough of it!
[02:41:48.115 --> 02:41:50.116]  It's time for you to stop being suckers!
[02:41:50.737 --> 02:41:52.618]  It's time for you to stop being scammed!
[02:41:52.998 --> 02:41:56.781]  It's time for you to start getting angry and getting upset about what's going on!
[02:41:57.522 --> 02:42:02.705]  Let me tell you something, at my base level, at my base, all I care about is my family.
[02:42:03.626 --> 02:42:09.630]  But if my family's gonna be safe, my city, my state, my country, my world has to be safe.
[02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:12.871]  If you're going to have freedom, then I'm going to have freedom.
[02:42:12.911 --> 02:42:14.391]  If I'm going to have freedom, you're going to have freedom.
[02:42:14.631 --> 02:42:15.831]  It doesn't work one way.
[02:42:16.051 --> 02:42:19.272]  People think the yuppies think they get ahead by only caring about themselves.
[02:42:19.512 --> 02:42:24.273]  They think they get ahead by being totally self-centered and being mindless, giggling morons.
[02:42:26.174 --> 02:42:27.954]  And you don't get ahead in a world like that.
[02:42:27.974 --> 02:42:31.475]  Because there's nobody there to watch your back when it comes down to it at the end of the day.
[02:42:32.896 --> 02:42:33.996]  And you're being ripped off.
[02:42:34.016 --> 02:42:38.037]  You're being denied what it is to be a human being in this transitory glimmer.
[02:42:38.917 --> 02:42:42.940]  Like, like, like mist in the morning being burned away in mere seconds by the sun.
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:44.601]  Your life is so short!
[02:42:45.141 --> 02:42:55.268]  And it's about raising a strong family, being a good person, never selling out, doing the right thing, standing up for what's honorable, putting your life at risk if need be for what's good.
[02:42:55.608 --> 02:42:57.049]  And that means not being manipulated.
[02:42:57.069 --> 02:43:03.493]  There's a lot of good saps out there who are good people, but are gullible, and I have to watch them being used by these wolves.
[02:43:03.894 --> 02:43:08.657]  I have to watch you, good people, empowering the devil's forces of hell itself!
[02:43:13.121 --> 02:43:15.983]  So there's... I'm ranting and raving here today.
[02:43:16.984 --> 02:43:19.206]  It's just... I think about them knowingly.
[02:43:19.727 --> 02:43:25.051]  Eight years after it was illegal, certifying the blood is good from not just Arkansas, but other prisons.
[02:43:25.452 --> 02:43:26.973]  And shipping it in the U.S.
[02:43:27.093 --> 02:43:30.216]  and Latin America and Canada and to Europe.
[02:43:31.542 --> 02:43:33.443]  And it's the same thing with Mad Cow.
[02:43:33.483 --> 02:43:35.004]  It's all over the place, folks.
[02:43:35.444 --> 02:43:37.425]  It's the same thing with the genetically modified food.
[02:43:37.725 --> 02:43:38.865]  It's the same thing with all of it.
[02:43:38.905 --> 02:43:42.287]  They know what it's doing, but they don't... They don't just care!
[02:43:42.467 --> 02:43:43.727]  They love what they're doing!
[02:43:43.747 --> 02:43:44.988]  They revel in it!
[02:43:48.729 --> 02:43:49.990]  They are cancerous!
[02:43:52.182 --> 02:43:57.105]  I mean, yes, they get into all the elite positions, the pinnacles of power, because they don't have the conscience.
[02:43:57.485 --> 02:43:58.666]  Because they don't have the love.
[02:43:58.706 --> 02:43:59.626]  It doesn't control them.
[02:43:59.966 --> 02:44:01.827]  They are defunct.
[02:44:02.187 --> 02:44:03.248]  They are deformed.
[02:44:03.548 --> 02:44:05.029]  They are diseased.
[02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:06.330]  They are aberrant.
[02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:08.391]  They are malfunctioning.
[02:44:09.331 --> 02:44:13.033]  And they're burning a hole through humanity that may be irreparable!
[02:44:14.254 --> 02:44:19.817]  I'm watching this incredible species be flushed down the toilet by a bunch of inbred murdering trash!
[02:44:26.112 --> 02:44:27.633]  It's time to stop denying it!
[02:44:27.913 --> 02:44:29.674]  It's time to face the full horror!
[02:44:29.694 --> 02:44:35.736]  And I heard these people go, I've checked it out, I know it's true, but Alex, I'm depressed, I just want to be happy!
[02:44:37.277 --> 02:44:39.038]  Dink down, you weren't happy before!
[02:44:39.118 --> 02:44:42.879]  This country isn't happy, look at all the depression, all the problems, it's screwed up!
[02:44:43.119 --> 02:44:44.660]  Illegitimacy at record levels!
[02:44:46.741 --> 02:44:48.602]  Debt at record levels, you're not happy!
[02:44:49.582 --> 02:44:51.143]  Because you know something's wrong!
[02:44:51.843 --> 02:44:54.964]  And you're not going to be happy and fulfilled until you start fighting this thing!
[02:44:55.204 --> 02:44:56.045]  So join me!
[02:44:58.086 --> 02:44:59.066]  Come up beside me!
[02:44:59.386 --> 02:45:00.227]  Get in front of me!
[02:45:00.867 --> 02:45:01.767]  Don't follow me!
[02:45:02.167 --> 02:45:03.748]  And don't tell me how great I am!
[02:45:04.368 --> 02:45:06.169]  I'm doing my duty and that's it!
[02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:09.150]  People say, oh, you've got so much courage.
[02:45:09.411 --> 02:45:12.532]  The evil we've just talked about, it's not courage, folks!
[02:45:13.972 --> 02:45:16.534]  This ship is going down if we don't save it!
[02:45:16.694 --> 02:45:18.054]  And we don't have much time!
[02:45:18.294 --> 02:45:19.555]  It's the opposite of courage!
[02:45:20.988 --> 02:45:23.109]  I'm trying to save what we're on!
[02:45:24.010 --> 02:45:25.010]  What we're standing on!
[02:45:25.050 --> 02:45:25.991]  What we're living in!
[02:45:28.372 --> 02:45:32.295]  I'm doing the best job I can, and that isn't a very good job sometimes.
[02:45:32.875 --> 02:45:35.276]  And I appreciate you out there and your support.
[02:45:40.279 --> 02:45:42.421]  But let me tell you, stuff's gonna get real bad.
[02:45:43.101 --> 02:45:44.402]  These people plan to kill.
[02:45:45.282 --> 02:45:47.123]  80 plus percent of us in their official documents.
[02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:48.184]  It's not a joke!
[02:45:49.827 --> 02:45:52.188]  Everything you've seen up until now is just a warm-up.
[02:45:52.228 --> 02:45:53.109]  It's the hors d'oeuvres.
[02:45:54.629 --> 02:45:55.610]  It's the precursor.
[02:45:57.611 --> 02:45:58.271]  It's the trigger.
[02:45:58.611 --> 02:45:59.372]  The tripwire.
[02:45:59.692 --> 02:46:00.512]  The flashpoint.
[02:46:00.712 --> 02:46:01.392]  The ignition.
[02:46:02.653 --> 02:46:03.273]  The launch.
[02:46:03.694 --> 02:46:04.214]  The jump.
[02:46:06.415 --> 02:46:07.215]  That's all it is.
[02:46:07.275 --> 02:46:12.057]  We're jumping right now into the darkest pits humanity's ever seen.
[02:46:13.398 --> 02:46:14.659]  We're jumping right now.
[02:46:14.919 --> 02:46:16.460]  The jump is in progress.
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:17.360]  Can you feel it?
[02:46:19.747 --> 02:46:23.490]  And for every action there is a equal or greater reaction.
[02:46:23.650 --> 02:46:24.831]  That's why people are waking up.
[02:46:24.991 --> 02:46:26.092]  That's why they'll listen now.
[02:46:26.233 --> 02:46:27.013]  Because they've seen it.
[02:46:27.053 --> 02:46:27.954]  They know in their guts.
[02:46:29.315 --> 02:46:31.137]  Because they're not totally given over to evil.
[02:46:31.517 --> 02:46:33.178]  God will give you perception.
[02:46:33.579 --> 02:46:34.740]  And will give you discernment.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:36.521]  If you will accept it.
[02:46:37.042 --> 02:46:39.504]  If you deny it and rationalize and harden your heart.
[02:46:40.304 --> 02:46:41.826]  Then God won't give it to you anymore.
[02:46:41.846 --> 02:46:43.967]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:46:44.748 --> 02:46:46.029]  Robert in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:46:46.049 --> 02:46:47.270]  Alex?
[02:46:47.791 --> 02:46:47.971]  Yes.
[02:46:49.239 --> 02:46:52.141]  Uh, Senator Galloway was good today.
[02:46:52.501 --> 02:46:53.401]  He's a member of parliament.
[02:46:54.242 --> 02:46:54.482]  Yeah.
[02:46:55.803 --> 02:46:57.083]  We need more of him.
[02:46:58.924 --> 02:47:02.846]  Uh, what are the seven states that are seceding from the feds?
[02:47:04.307 --> 02:47:05.728]  Well, there's people talking about it.
[02:47:06.248 --> 02:47:08.850]  It's the ten original southern states are moving to do it.
[02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:15.033]  New Hampshire, the week before 9-11, had the votes of their commonwealth counties and they were about to pull out.
[02:47:15.891 --> 02:47:19.012]  And there's been bills introduced in Arizona.
[02:47:19.052 --> 02:47:20.073]  Yes, Arizona to do it.
[02:47:20.093 --> 02:47:20.713]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:21.353 --> 02:47:22.253]  Richard in Florida.
[02:47:22.273 --> 02:47:23.054]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:47:23.074 --> 02:47:31.416]  The Himephiliac gentleman from Canada is listening, but he's got to watch out for the RCMP.
[02:47:31.456 --> 02:47:33.517]  He seems to put a lot of credence in them.
[02:47:33.557 --> 02:47:34.858]  Yeah, they don't know they're all paid off.
[02:47:35.178 --> 02:47:35.878]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:35.898 --> 02:47:40.360]  The Mounties go around planting the genetically modified canola to blow into people's fields.
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:41.680]  We've been caught doing it.
[02:47:42.202 --> 02:47:47.504]  Well, they've been caught in Ottawa telling the city police to do stuff, and a big scandal.
[02:47:47.544 --> 02:47:54.168]  Anyway, I wanted to warn him about the RCMP because they're bad, bad... And that's why evil's getting bigger and bigger, because nobody can stop it!
[02:47:54.188 --> 02:47:54.848]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:55.188 --> 02:47:55.368]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:56.349 --> 02:47:56.509]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:59.950 --> 02:48:00.871]  What else is on your mind?
[02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:05.213]  Well, I was a little shocked at this Amnesty International about Guantanamo.
[02:48:05.253 --> 02:48:08.454]  I mean, I think we... Come on, we need to make some changes here.
[02:48:08.954 --> 02:48:10.235]  Let's close down Guantanamo.
[02:48:11.246 --> 02:48:13.627]  Well, there's not even real Al-Qaeda or Taliban in there.
[02:48:13.667 --> 02:48:15.187]  They flew those guys out to safety.
[02:48:15.207 --> 02:48:17.168]  The Army's own reports admit all this.
[02:48:17.348 --> 02:48:19.569]  Yeah, or put Bush and Cheney in Guantanamo.
[02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:20.209]  That's what we need.
[02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:22.210]  Hey, you have a good one.
[02:48:22.850 --> 02:48:23.350]  Anything else?
[02:48:23.370 --> 02:48:24.451]  You can hold over if you want.
[02:48:24.631 --> 02:48:25.311]  Sure, I'll hold over.
[02:48:25.351 --> 02:48:26.311]  Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you short.
[02:48:26.331 --> 02:48:27.031]  Let me finish up.
[02:48:27.292 --> 02:48:30.473]  Yeah, I'm against cruel and unusual punishment because we become them.
[02:48:31.153 --> 02:48:34.394]  But I would like to see them in federal prison for the rest of their miserable lives.
[02:48:35.034 --> 02:48:36.255]  But again, they're just front men.
[02:48:36.275 --> 02:48:37.035]  They're just puppets.
[02:48:37.935 --> 02:48:40.156]  Little doppelgangers of the globalists behind them.
[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:45.062]  The transmission will continue into its final quadrant.
[02:48:45.983 --> 02:48:50.305]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.485 --> 02:48:54.928]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.068 --> 02:48:59.430]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.470 --> 02:49:00.811]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.551 --> 02:49:02.532]  Can emerge.
[02:49:02.613 --> 02:49:06.837]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.897 --> 02:49:13.845]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.965 --> 02:49:15.968]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.328 --> 02:49:26.751]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.951 --> 02:49:32.353]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:50:04.121 --> 02:50:04.521]  We're good to go!
[02:50:20.735 --> 02:50:21.235]  That's right!

[02:51:46.724 --> 02:51:49.486]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.506 --> 02:51:53.329]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.194 --> 02:52:12.983]  Before we let Richard and Florida finish up and Bill and Toronto Canada briefly, I had George Galloway, the Member of Parliament on, who skewered the crony Senate a few weeks ago, and I brought up government-sponsored terror so we could invade Israel.
[02:52:14.056 --> 02:52:15.157]  And this is what he said to that.
[02:52:15.217 --> 02:52:15.617]  Here it is.
[02:52:15.998 --> 02:52:18.420]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:20.462]  They're saying they'll go ahead and attack Iran.
[02:52:31.651 --> 02:52:39.400]  Well, there's an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[02:52:39.861 --> 02:52:44.306]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one he'll have to count us out.
[02:52:44.686 --> 02:52:46.929]  What if Israel drags us in?
[02:52:47.149 --> 02:52:48.311]  Well, that's a possibility.
[02:52:48.751 --> 02:52:50.113]  Israel might strike Iran.
[02:52:50.755 --> 02:52:57.298]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[02:52:57.358 --> 02:52:59.720]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:00.640]  Well, I have another article.
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:03.521]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[02:53:03.602 --> 02:53:07.323]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[02:53:07.684 --> 02:53:11.525]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[02:53:11.626 --> 02:53:18.369]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[02:53:18.809 --> 02:53:19.109]  Alright.
[02:53:19.410 --> 02:53:20.351]  We got 30 seconds.
[02:53:20.391 --> 02:53:28.518]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack, deployment on them?
[02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:39.148]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[02:53:39.168 --> 02:53:45.172]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[02:53:45.232 --> 02:53:47.354]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[02:53:47.774 --> 02:53:48.415]  Unbelievable!
[02:53:48.695 --> 02:53:53.919]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[02:53:54.099 --> 02:53:55.180]  I salute you!
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:55.900]  Thank you very much.
[02:53:56.761 --> 02:53:59.183]  All right, let's go right back to government-sponsored terror.
[02:53:59.223 --> 02:53:59.723]  Did you hear him?
[02:53:59.803 --> 02:54:01.084]  Very real threat.
[02:54:01.124 --> 02:54:01.885]  Richard, finish up.
[02:54:02.225 --> 02:54:03.026]  Oh, exactly.
[02:54:03.526 --> 02:54:04.807]  I was impressed with him.
[02:54:06.095 --> 02:54:11.360]  Really, I'm trying to say it nicely, gave them a new you-know-what.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:13.962]  I mean, this is outrageous conduct.
[02:54:14.042 --> 02:54:15.544]  He put their bike in the fire.
[02:54:15.864 --> 02:54:16.404]  Exactly.
[02:54:16.424 --> 02:54:20.748]  Yeah, we need more, you know, involvement in the basics.
[02:54:20.768 --> 02:54:28.675]  You know, I was out doing an initiative petition drive, and you'd be surprised at the number of young people that say, you know, it's so corrupt, I don't even want to register to vote.
[02:54:28.916 --> 02:54:31.478]  I don't want to be involved with the system.
[02:54:31.909 --> 02:54:33.089]  But you know, that's the sad part.
[02:54:33.129 --> 02:54:33.990]  We have to be involved.
[02:54:34.010 --> 02:54:37.450]  Hey, we cannot abandon this ship just because we're in rocky waters.
[02:54:37.470 --> 02:54:38.611]  We've got to grab the wheel.
[02:54:39.131 --> 02:54:39.671]  Exactly.
[02:54:39.731 --> 02:54:42.371]  But you know, the young people of today say, you know what?
[02:54:42.472 --> 02:54:44.952]  It's so corrupt, I don't want any part of it.
[02:54:45.472 --> 02:54:46.552]  Well, they're going to be part of it.
[02:54:46.572 --> 02:54:47.693]  It's going to come eat their lunch.
[02:54:47.733 --> 02:54:48.333]  Sure, for sure.
[02:54:48.353 --> 02:54:49.213]  But they don't realize it.
[02:54:49.533 --> 02:54:50.693]  Richard, thanks for the call.
[02:54:50.733 --> 02:54:51.534]  Thanks for the great points.
[02:54:51.854 --> 02:54:52.874]  Bill in Toronto, Canada.
[02:54:52.894 --> 02:54:53.614]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:54:53.634 --> 02:54:54.014]  Go ahead.
[02:54:54.234 --> 02:55:01.376]  Alex, we don't have much time, but let me tell you, a friend of mine just came back from Poland, from one month vacation in Poland.
[02:55:01.983 --> 02:55:10.288]  He's Polish, and he says that Polish people, the elder ones, are dying out because they're getting very low pension.
[02:55:10.449 --> 02:55:11.349]  They can't survive.
[02:55:11.389 --> 02:55:12.790]  They have no money to buy food.
[02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:14.711]  They're starving themselves to death.
[02:55:15.492 --> 02:55:21.175]  And here in Canada, about the RCMP, when they say they are investigating, it's nothing but cover-up.
[02:55:22.716 --> 02:55:24.237]  My nephew is with the RCMP.
[02:55:24.958 --> 02:55:29.701]  And I tell you, if you listen very carefully, just like all that
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:33.302]  And they'll just keep doing what they're doing with the blood?
[02:55:45.922 --> 02:55:57.878]  They're creating a bad image to the Iraqi people, as I have a friend, the Iraqians, they're good Muslim people, family oriented, they don't like them, because they want to defend the family, they want to destroy the family.
[02:55:57.938 --> 02:55:59.821]  No, that's right, listen, I appreciate the call.
[02:56:00.241 --> 02:56:01.884]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:02.524 --> 02:56:04.806]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:04.906 --> 02:56:06.168]  Unbelievable broadcast today.
[02:56:06.208 --> 02:56:07.028]  Great job to everybody.
[02:56:07.449 --> 02:56:10.171]  Go to prisonplanet.com to get the new film, Martial Law.
[02:56:10.451 --> 02:56:16.817]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv to watch it all online right now and support us so we can get the word out and fight the globalists even harder.
[02:56:17.197 --> 02:56:18.138]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:18.158 --> 02:56:23.243]  From the front lines of the Info Wars, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:56:26.986 --> 02:56:27.947]  God bless you all.
[02:56:28.048 --> 02:56:29.329]  Thanks for all you do.
[02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:32.032]  Humanity, with God's help, will prevail.
[02:56:32.133 --> 02:56:33.014]  God bless!
