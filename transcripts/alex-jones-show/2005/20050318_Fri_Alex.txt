[00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:06.248]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:07.989]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.810]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.534]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.857]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:40.578]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:42.159]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:49.280]  It is already Friday, and we're talking about the 18th day of March 2005.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:59.942]  Andre Iglesias will be joining us coming up in the next hour to talk about our private central bank, the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:07.317]  Look at this BBC News article, Lab Fireball, Maybe Black Hole.
[00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:09.958]  A fireball created in a U.S.
[00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:16.081]  particle accelerator has the characteristics of a black hole, a physicist has said.
[00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:30.689]  It was generated at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in New York, U.S., which smashes beams of gold nuclei together at near light speeds.
[00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.166]  Now, I've talked a lot about this.
[00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:49.712]  These particle accelerators, top physicists, top scientists, have said could create an anti-matter chain reaction and destroy thousands of square miles, an entire planet, an entire solar system, or even blow a huge hole in a galaxy.
[00:01:51.393 --> 00:01:55.774]  I mean, back in the 40's, my friends, they were making A-bombs that blow up whole cities.
[00:01:55.894 --> 00:01:56.015]  It's 2005!
[00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:07.501]  And a large majority of top physicists have warned the government and other scientists, and they don't stop, they don't care.
[00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:15.407]  The globalists just keep on doing it, because they're on power trips and think that they're invincible.
[00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:21.232]  Very scary article from the BBC, and this is the real deal.
[00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:27.437]  We will be discussing this, and it just illustrates what could happen.
[00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:40.914]  The San Francisco Chronicle and the Associated Press have reported that the government, the Pentagon, in the last decade has successfully developed anti-matter bombs.
[00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:43.855]  Anti-matter warheads.
[00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:46.516]  Boy, if that doesn't get the NSA listing, I don't know what will.
[00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:54.840]  But this is the kind of stuff the general public really has no idea about, even though it's in the scientific journals.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.301]  Anti-matter bombs.
[00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:57.781]  Boy!
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.701]  That's just wonderful.
[00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.863]  And the excuse is, well, if we don't develop it, somebody else will.
[00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:05.884]  Wonder how long we're going to be here.
[00:03:05.904 --> 00:03:09.126]  Wonder how long there's even going to be a planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:15.269]  Japanese spy plane flies near islands disputed with South Korea.
[00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.612]  Malibu gas station already charging more than three dollars a gallon.
[00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:24.575]  Pentagon developing super speed aircraft, says report.
[00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:26.936]  And of course, they're going to be unmanned.
[00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.795]  In a blow to Lord Bush, Senators reject cuts to Medicaid.
[00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:38.140]  Maguire refuses to say if he took steroids or not.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.980]  Hey, what's wrong?
[00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:41.363]  You should probably be governor of a major state.
[00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:43.725]  Maguire said he admired Hitler.
[00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.106]  He might be able to become president.
[00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:46.848]  Of course he doesn't, so he won't be able to, but...
[00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.174]  It's bad if you use steroids.
[00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.795]  Good if Lord Schwarzenegger uses them.
[00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:57.357]  And more on the Russian war games aimed at practicing invasion of Taiwan.
[00:03:57.577 --> 00:04:01.898]  Also, Israel armed itself with nuclear option 40 years ago.
[00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:05.779]  Ex-minister says, ooh, this is now just mainstream news.
[00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:11.316]  They have over 200 nuclear devices.
[00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:19.260]  They have submarines and cruise missiles and medium-range missiles and fighter-bombers and bombers and they're ready.
[00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:24.460]  Also, EU fusses over cyber-humans.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.622]  Yes, that's the Register headline.
[00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:29.665]  We'll tell you the details of that as well.
[00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:30.225]  U.S.
[00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:34.229]  Army asks for longer estimates as recruitment number falls.
[00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.333]  They lower their recruitment level so they can claim they're reaching their goal.
[00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.775]  That's a nice way of cooking the books.
[00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:51.025]  This and a lot more coming up on the other side of this quick break and your calls toll free at 1-800-259-9231 and the websites InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net
[00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:05.510]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.112]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.252 --> 00:05:14.635]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.016]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:17.776]  Pan-America.
[00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:22.038]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.098 --> 00:05:29.040]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.221]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:41.905]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:42.585]  If you want
[00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:47.572]  If you'd like to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:13.450]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.135]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.170]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.691]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.851]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:11.632]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:15.013]  I've been using Avocor now for four months and it's a great product.
[00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:17.234]  They back everything with a money-back guarantee.
[00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:18.294]  It works!
[00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:21.195]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:27.526]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:31.429]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.

[00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:52.706]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:07.533]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:22.684]  Alright, Andre Eggleston is joining us, coming up in the next hour to talk about our private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.992]  Who has created a system where it's impossible for us to ever get out of debt.
[00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:40.561]  It is a system just like the IMF and World Bank system, when they have their own documents, designed to destroy the middle class, create a giant underclass, and have a teeny tiny elite running and owning everything.
[00:08:41.262 --> 00:08:42.402]  It is not free market.
[00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:43.243]  It is criminal.
[00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:46.045]  It is the centerpiece of the New World Order.
[00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:51.329]  And for years and years and years, I mean every week I talked about the Federal Reserve.
[00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:53.791]  Every week I talked about aspartame and fluoride and
[00:08:54.798 --> 00:09:01.261]  You know, these are the staple issues, the Uniform Commercial Code, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:05.523]  These are the things that I talked about predominantly before 9-11.
[00:09:05.684 --> 00:09:17.189]  In the year before 9-11, I started talking more and more about government-sponsored terrorism because I could see that they were preparing to move into the martial law phase.
[00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.252]  But it is important to bring back experts on the Federal Reserve.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:38.079]  We've had them all on, the Eustace Mullins of the world, the Red Beckmans of the planet, the Congressman Ron Pauls, the folks that write the books like The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:40.201]  We have them all on from time to time.
[00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:45.207]  Andre, who's coming on the next hour, has written a great book.
[00:09:45.247 --> 00:09:49.550]  He's very informed, very articulate when it comes to the Federal Reserve.
[00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:56.074]  It'll be the first time he joins us, so I'm looking forward to that coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:56.234 --> 00:10:01.057]  And again, as I said in the last segment, we'll have wide open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:01.077 --> 00:10:01.237]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:02.678]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.021]  Let me plunge into this right now.
[00:10:15.422 --> 00:10:20.344]  In the last 10 years, I like to read some scientific journals, just occasionally.
[00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:22.985]  I'm not a big science buff, but I find it interesting.
[00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:38.552]  And I know that when they were going to build the superconducting supercollider outside Dallas, Texas, just south of Dallas, in the Waxahachie area, it was going to be the biggest superconducting supercollider in the world.
[00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:44.088]  Now it's an underground private CIA training base.
[00:10:45.608 --> 00:10:47.489]  I'm not kidding, that's the Dallas Morning News.
[00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.592]  The thing is like 80 feet high inside.
[00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:54.772]  They built about two-thirds of it.
[00:10:55.093 --> 00:10:57.774]  It goes for, I forget, almost 100 miles.
[00:10:58.314 --> 00:10:59.615]  The thing is gigantic.
[00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:01.936]  It's huge.
[00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:04.977]  And they cancelled it.
[00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:18.457]  They cancelled it, and then they transferred much of its funding and its experts to the European Union's superconducting supercollider that they did construct.
[00:11:18.517 --> 00:11:21.799]  But there's lots of these superconducting supercolliders.
[00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:25.682]  But the bigger they are, the more sophisticated tests they can do.
[00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:31.786]  For those that don't know what a superconducting supercollider is, basically it's
[00:11:32.913 --> 00:11:41.321]  A couple generations more advanced than the technologies that developed the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb.
[00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:46.566]  The nuclear age, as it was called back in the 60s.
[00:11:48.488 --> 00:11:57.877]  And the majority of top physicists and theoretical physicists and scientists of the mathematical persuasion that study this
[00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:07.147]  Even though they want government funding, they've been honest and said, look, we don't know what these superconducting super colliders will do.
[00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:10.430]  We don't know what these fission fusion reactors will do.
[00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.971]  There's a whole class of this stuff.
[00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:23.801]  It could create an artificial sun, which they actually do in miniature, and then use these giant fields that they project to hold it in place.
[00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.083]  They try to derive energy from it.
[00:12:26.423 --> 00:12:30.986]  They've got these big devices where they can take one element and create a totally new element.
[00:12:31.006 --> 00:12:32.988]  They've created hundreds of new elements.
[00:12:33.688 --> 00:12:37.951]  But it's so expensive to make the new elements that they can't mass produce them.
[00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:45.556]  And you tell the average person this, and I get emails laughing at me, I've gotten calls before on the TV show,
[00:12:46.334 --> 00:12:52.517]  Which sometimes, you know, you get more of a dumbed-down audience watching than this incredibly intelligent, informed audience.
[00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:53.458]  You're crazy!
[00:12:53.478 --> 00:13:02.582]  They can't make black holes, they can't make suns, they can't... There's no such thing as all this when I'm, you know, reading scientific journals, major magazines.
[00:13:02.602 --> 00:13:05.264]  You know, most people who read know about this.
[00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:07.585]  Unfortunately, a lot of Americans don't.
[00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:11.357]  It's kind of like genetic engineering.
[00:13:11.397 --> 00:13:13.539]  I've told the stories of people tapping me on the shoulder.
[00:13:13.979 --> 00:13:15.200]  Hey man, you're a liar.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.861]  There's no such thing as spider goats.
[00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:21.244]  You know, I had biology in 73 at UT.
[00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:23.166]  Well, it's 2000, buddy.
[00:13:25.328 --> 00:13:26.528]  I've had the CEO on.
[00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:28.030]  It's CNN.
[00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.251]  It's CBS News.
[00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:35.355]  People deny stuff that is already public.
[00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:36.536]  It's like world government.
[00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:42.887]  The media and the culture told us there's no such thing as world government in the last 20 years.
[00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:44.528]  If anybody talks about it, they're a kook.
[00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:48.391]  Or it's code word for racism or some other mindlessness.
[00:13:50.512 --> 00:13:57.937]  And then now, you know, you read the CBC News articles, you read the Canadian papers, the Mexican papers, we're losing our sovereignty!
[00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:00.259]  Pan-American Union, they're signing the documents!
[00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:01.800]  And this is in the last month.
[00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:05.758]  I've got some of the mainstream news articles out of Canada on this today.
[00:14:05.838 --> 00:14:11.840]  Chertoff, Homeland Security head, is going, Hey, it's not the American Union.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.541]  Don't worry about top off three, this big drill with Canada.
[00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:18.702]  Don't worry, we're not taking your sovereignty now.
[00:14:18.742 --> 00:14:20.122]  Canadians don't protest.
[00:14:20.723 --> 00:14:21.883]  Well, that's exactly what it is.
[00:14:22.423 --> 00:14:26.204]  But because they told you it didn't exist, they're good at this.
[00:14:26.504 --> 00:14:28.045]  Before they roll something out,
[00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:34.392]  Before they announce something, before they do something, they tell you it doesn't exist, bad people say it exists.
[00:14:34.692 --> 00:14:45.578]  And they say it thousands of times, you hear it, so when they finally announce it, you still don't criticize it because it's almost like, well, it's taboo, it's politically incorrect.
[00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:50.620]  It's like black helicopters, you know, that's just kind of an iconic
[00:14:53.146 --> 00:15:22.955]  cultural word or term for government black ops for covert operations in this country uh... four super secret special forces that have done anti-terror drills in the last ten years terrorizing almost every major city in the country firing bullets in the restaurants while people eat in miami crashing helicopters in downtown houston and killing people blowing up uh... police stations three days after the police move out terrorizing citizens i mean
[00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:27.377]  If you've seen Police State 2000, you've seen police chiefs on video saying they tried to bribe them.
[00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:32.099]  Police chiefs admitting foreign troops, you know, next door to nursing homes, blowing up buildings.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:40.983]  And look, I have to admit, ten years ago, people would call into my show, Alex, black helicopters, uh, you know, I live in old St.
[00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.644]  Louis, and they were flying around.
[00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:43.544]  It's in the newspaper.
[00:15:43.604 --> 00:15:45.926]  I'd go, I wasn't using the internet at that time.
[00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:47.306]  I'd go, yeah, sure.
[00:15:47.326 --> 00:15:50.548]  You know, the internet was so fledgling like in 95.
[00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:53.389]  I had a computer.
[00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:54.329]  It was online.
[00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.971]  But it got going in 1996.
[00:15:57.671 --> 00:15:59.792]  And finally the newspaper articles started coming in.
[00:15:59.832 --> 00:16:01.033]  I'd say, mail that to me!
[00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:02.594]  Well, it would come in the mail.
[00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:04.795]  I'd be reading mainstream news articles.
[00:16:04.815 --> 00:16:06.816]  Special forces firing automatic weapons.
[00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:08.637]  The public was terrified.
[00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:09.638]  People had heart attacks.
[00:16:10.138 --> 00:16:11.279]  Thought it was a Russian attack.
[00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.591]  So I said, well, why then does the news keep making fun of black helicopter people?
[00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:19.891]  I mean, these are in newspapers, but never on the national news.
[00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:21.952]  Always in a regional newspaper.
[00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:24.312]  And so then when you talked about it, you got attacked.
[00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:35.574]  And you'd hear a, you know, I remember a Dish Network ad, or some ad for satellite TV, and it's, yeah, black helicopters are flying around, and I'm gonna be washing cars on Mars for the Martians.
[00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:39.135]  It was like some weird kooky guy talking part of the ad.
[00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.715]  Just everywhere, it was, you're a kook if you talk about it.
[00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:44.416]  You're a kook if you discuss it.
[00:16:44.776 --> 00:16:45.657]  It doesn't exist.
[00:16:46.217 --> 00:17:04.488]  And then they started attacking Texas, and I'm sitting in, you know, the police chief of San Antonio's office going, well, they tried to bribe us, and big satchels of money, and then I went to other towns, smoking buildings, you know, video of black helicopters attacking, and then I was in the front page of the Statesman, the headline,
[00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:17.284]  Army terrorizes South Texas, black helicopters swarm, and they admitted it but then right next to it called me a conspiracy theorist because I didn't like it.
[00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:21.047]  So they were still creating a stigma.
[00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:22.748]  It's really weird.
[00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:33.075]  Well it's the same thing with these superconducting super colliders and these and these other high-tech systems they've got, these other laboratories.
[00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:35.637]  I mean here's the BBC,
[00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:39.269]  Today, the 18th of March, 2005.
[00:17:40.569 --> 00:17:45.850]  Lab fireball may be black hole, which is exactly... I know it doesn't exist.
[00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:46.710]  I understand.
[00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.751]  I know.
[00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:48.371]  I understand.
[00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.611]  A fireball created in a U.S.
[00:17:50.691 --> 00:17:55.872]  particle accelerator has the characteristics of a black hole a physicist has said.
[00:17:56.493 --> 00:18:06.515]  It was generated at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in New York, U.S., which smashes beams of gold nuclei together at near light speed.
[00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:11.345]  Because of gold's reflectivity, it's perfect for high-speed acceleration.
[00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:21.108]  And Horiakun Masaki says his calculations show the core of the fireball has a striking similarity to a black hole.
[00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:30.390]  His work has been published in the pre-print website ARXIV.org and is reported in the New Scientist Magazine.
[00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:37.212]  When the gold nuclei smash into each other, they are broken into particles called quarks and
[00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:45.598]  Gluons, if I'm pronouncing that right, I know it's quartz, these form a ball of plasma about 300 times hotter than the surface of the sun.
[00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.999]  That's a real good idea, to do that here on the planet.
[00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:50.440]  If you want to do that, go out to Mars and do it.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.122]  The fireball, which last, just, there needs to be a law that this cannot be done on the planet.
[00:18:55.282 --> 00:19:03.025]  That will, by the way, encourage space exploration for, then you get into the problem of the people off planet are more advanced than they dominate us, I know.
[00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:05.726]  This is all going to happen too if we don't kill ourselves.
[00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:10.347]  These form a ball of plasma about 300 times hotter than the surface of the sun.
[00:19:10.748 --> 00:19:20.090]  This fireball, which lasts just 10 million billion billions of a second, can be detected because it absorbs jets of particles produced by the beam collisions.
[00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:30.612]  And the problem with this is if that black hole gets purchased and starts feeding on outside particles, it can start growing
[00:19:32.486 --> 00:19:32.787]  Oh boy!
[00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:34.028]  Not very good!
[00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:39.772]  But the scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island says there is something unusual about it.
[00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:45.197]  Ten times as many jets are being absorbed by the fireball as were predicted by calculations.
[00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:50.941]  The Brown researcher thinks the particles are disappearing into the fireball's core and reappearing as thermal radiation.
[00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:56.766]  Just a matter is thought to fall into a black hole and come out as a Hawking radiation.
[00:19:57.427 --> 00:19:58.908]  The physicist Hawking.
[00:19:59.288 --> 00:20:00.289]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.241]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:08.123]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:08.443 --> 00:20:10.783]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:11.003 --> 00:20:12.544]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:12.924 --> 00:20:18.005]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:20:18.305 --> 00:20:19.525]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:22.306]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[00:21:01.064 --> 00:21:04.546]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:08.308]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:12.351]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:18.734]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:27.059]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:32.800]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.721]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:38.962]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:41.183]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:21:41.423 --> 00:21:46.364]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:21:46.404 --> 00:21:52.125]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:55.346 --> 00:21:59.189]  That's 888-803-4438 and protects your family.
[00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.572]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:06.675]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:07.816]  Read the labels.
[00:22:08.236 --> 00:22:12.339]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.783]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:22:17.163 --> 00:22:22.027]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:25.950]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:31.514]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:34.516]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:22:34.817 --> 00:22:35.717]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:22:36.018 --> 00:22:46.746]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.751]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.411 --> 00:23:09.993]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:23:11.229 --> 00:23:13.511]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:23:14.332 --> 00:23:20.557]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:29.584]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:38.412]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.826]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:40.846 --> 00:23:41.206]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.226 --> 00:23:41.707]  Call now.
[00:23:41.727 --> 00:23:45.731]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:14.312]  So I want people to understand this.
[00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:24.855]  The government and private corporations are doing genetic engineering, in many cases having no idea what it's going to cause, what it's going to do.
[00:24:24.875 --> 00:24:32.018]  They could give rise to super viruses or super bacteria that could wipe out hundreds of millions if not billions of people.
[00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:37.751]  They are wildly engaging in cross-species engineering, chimeras.
[00:24:39.192 --> 00:24:53.261]  They are just hand over fist in an out-of-control, uncontrolled revolution, engaging in all of this manipulation with the very makeup of matter itself at the subatomic level.
[00:24:56.198 --> 00:25:02.961]  The Pentagon is now admitting they have, it's just quietly admitted, oh yeah, we're developing anti-matter bombs.
[00:25:03.061 --> 00:25:03.701]  Oh, that's nice.
[00:25:06.002 --> 00:25:07.002]  They're just doing it all.
[00:25:07.543 --> 00:25:10.984]  And then they just, believe me, if they're telling you about this, it's a lot more advanced.
[00:25:11.284 --> 00:25:20.708]  We have up in New York, same place they've got the military bases with these spider goats that produce body armor out of their udders, their milk,
[00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:32.024]  It goes on, however, even if the ball of plasma is a black hole, it is not thought, not thought to pose a threat at these energies and distances.
[00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:34.986]  Gravity is not the dominant force in a black hole.
[00:25:36.147 --> 00:25:42.171]  But I thought you just said that this isn't following any of the mathematics they previously were subscribing to.
[00:25:43.052 --> 00:25:49.476]  And Hawking had been saying he thought he was wrong about his black hole theory of it emitting a type of dark radiation.
[00:25:50.498 --> 00:26:01.765]  Again, the brown researcher thinks the particles are disappearing into the fireball's core and reappearing as thermal radiation, just as a matter is thought to fall into black holes and come out as Hawking radiation.
[00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:04.727]  But again, I'm not the big physicist.
[00:26:04.787 --> 00:26:10.351]  I just listen to some of the most respected physicists out there, and they say this is very dangerous.
[00:26:12.793 --> 00:26:14.774]  But hey, ever onward and upward!
[00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:20.068]  We had stuff back in the late forties that would blow up whole cities.
[00:26:20.688 --> 00:26:23.450]  Imagine how big and powerful it is now.
[00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.651]  Let's just have fun with it!
[00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:31.614]  I mean, the globalists are so powerful, they wouldn't let anything bad happen.
[00:26:32.775 --> 00:26:34.135]  Globalists know it all.
[00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:35.816]  That's what they think up in their ivory towers.
[00:26:35.836 --> 00:26:37.437]  They're completely power drunk.
[00:26:38.858 --> 00:26:42.200]  And they've got that excuse that if we don't develop it, somebody else will.
[00:26:43.374 --> 00:26:51.379]  And so one day, you may be out there, you know, with your children at the playground, swinging them in the swings, and you feel just a millisecond of heat.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:27:11.393]  When you all evaporate, and are sucked into a big fat black hole, or there's a superconducting supercollider reaction, and there's an explosion, and it blows up the entire planet, or maybe it just burns the surface of the Earth into a crisp.
[00:27:12.978 --> 00:27:15.640]  Or maybe it just blows up a few thousand square miles.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.520]  Who knows what it'll do?
[00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.122]  Or maybe nothing bad will happen.
[00:27:18.142 --> 00:27:23.965]  Maybe it'll all be okay, even though the mathematics show there's a real good chance it'll kill everybody.
[00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:25.506]  That's okay.
[00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:26.907]  The mathematics show it.
[00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:28.468]  Let's just ignore it.
[00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:29.429]  How does that sound?
[00:27:29.469 --> 00:27:30.770]  Let's just keep doing it.
[00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:42.678]  Here, let's take different particles and slam them into blocks of uranium and plutonium and slam them into blocks of lead and gold and titanium and let's just keep slamming them into things.
[00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:52.766]  Let's just do it every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, in dozens and dozens and dozens of these facilities around the world.
[00:27:53.267 --> 00:27:54.388]  Everything's okay.
[00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:59.052]  I saw PBS probably 15 years ago.
[00:27:59.072 --> 00:28:01.193]  That was longer than that.
[00:28:02.174 --> 00:28:03.575]  It's back when I lived in Dallas.
[00:28:03.976 --> 00:28:05.937]  I remember watching PBS one afternoon.
[00:28:05.957 --> 00:28:10.441]  I got home from school and, well, they had video on there.
[00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:11.242]  They were showing
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.882]  Uh, these different systems where they create fish infusion, artificial suns.
[00:28:16.563 --> 00:28:29.170]  They have these giant machines that, I mean, you know, multi-story buildings in size, uh, focusing all their power into these different fields to hold the artificial suns in place.
[00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:35.554]  You know, I hate to use the example of a movie, but have you seen the new Spider-Man movie came out last year?
[00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:37.118]  And we're the bad guy?
[00:28:37.158 --> 00:28:40.019]  I mean, a lot of the stuff they put in those comic books, you know, is from real world stuff.
[00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:48.141]  You know, the bad, evil character is creating this energy source, this artificial sun, and it starts growing and sucking everything into it?
[00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:51.042]  Well, that comes from real scientific systems.
[00:28:51.682 --> 00:28:52.622]  Real developments.
[00:28:52.862 --> 00:28:54.503]  Real, real things.
[00:28:56.603 --> 00:29:02.345]  And the globalists argue, well, we've got to have a global government to control all this stuff, or some rogue nation will get it and kill all of us.
[00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:06.425]  The problem with that is it's the globalists that are developing all of this.
[00:29:06.985 --> 00:29:12.307]  And it's the globalists handing out these technologies and not restricting their deployment.
[00:29:13.348 --> 00:29:23.733]  I mean, if we really educated people about this, we could maintain national sovereignty and have treaties, truly independent treaties between nations, not to develop this.
[00:29:23.753 --> 00:29:24.633]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:29:25.145 --> 00:29:28.908]  The globalists have got to create a crisis so we all accept the global government.
[00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:33.771]  And the globalists could blow up a city and claim it was an experiment gone bad.
[00:29:34.932 --> 00:29:36.593]  And then get global government out of that.
[00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:39.795]  These are the real things we've got to face and discuss.
[00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:43.118]  We'll come back, take your calls, get into a bunch of other news.
[00:29:43.838 --> 00:29:44.939]  Call the free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:46.240]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:54.746]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:05.480]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.381]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:09.961]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:20.044]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:30:20.244 --> 00:30:21.985]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:26.148]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:30:26.368 --> 00:30:30.810]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:30:30.991 --> 00:30:34.833]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:30:35.073 --> 00:30:41.197]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:30:41.437 --> 00:30:44.260]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.763]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[00:30:47.863 --> 00:30:51.746]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.047]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:53.648]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:31:01.579 --> 00:31:06.805]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:15.055]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.295 --> 00:31:22.363]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.483 --> 00:31:23.444]  We're good to go!
[00:31:44.327 --> 00:31:44.747]  I think so.
[00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:11.390]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.034]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:32:15.094 --> 00:32:17.077]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:32:17.097 --> 00:32:18.118]  Cardivite.
[00:32:18.178 --> 00:32:19.720]  We all use Cardivite!
[00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:24.026]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:32.852]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world, specially designed to improve your health.
[00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:36.094]  Come on and care about yourself just a little more with Cardivite.

[00:32:40.818 --> 00:32:41.198]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:55.228]  Alright, we're gonna go to Stavos, Stavros, Kyle, Jeff,
[00:33:19.517 --> 00:33:28.722]  Patrick and others here in just a minute or two, and then I'm going to plunge into all the other economic and geopolitical news.
[00:33:29.523 --> 00:33:31.824]  More information about the Pan-American Union.
[00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:38.048]  Homeland Security Director Chertoff is telling Canadians, don't be upset, we're not taking your country over.
[00:33:38.488 --> 00:33:45.392]  He actually says, this isn't part of an American Union, because that's all over their newspapers, because the actual documents say that.
[00:33:48.092 --> 00:34:00.236]  They could watch Bush almost four years ago, coming up on four years ago, when he was in Canada, where they were openly on C-SPAN, talking about it.
[00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:03.197]  It's all happening, so that's coming up as well.
[00:34:03.557 --> 00:34:12.840]  Before we go to your calls, in the next hour, we've got an expert on the Federal Reserve joining us, a very interesting, intelligent gentleman, who I look forward to talking with, Andre Eccleson.
[00:34:15.299 --> 00:34:24.385]  My friends, my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, has been shipping all week long.
[00:34:26.026 --> 00:34:31.049]  It is by far my best and most powerful and best produced documentary film.
[00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.470]  It is 2 hours 35 minutes long.
[00:34:35.646 --> 00:34:38.629]  It's not just a great video, you also support what we're doing here.
[00:34:38.649 --> 00:34:42.932]  The websites, the radio show, future films, all of it.
[00:34:43.192 --> 00:34:45.815]  You make this broadcast possible, quite frankly.
[00:34:46.955 --> 00:34:57.004]  The video, the first 35 minutes cover the nightmare police state that we saw at the RNC, the hover blimps, the sound cannons, police arresting people for no reason, threatening to arrest us.
[00:34:57.854 --> 00:34:58.855]  Over and over again.
[00:34:58.875 --> 00:35:07.540]  Then the next hour of the film is the most concise, focused, hard-hitting, 9-11 documentary out there, bar none.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.941]  The film, again, is really three documentaries in one.
[00:35:12.002 --> 00:35:22.448]  Then the third part, a whole other hour, is about the elite that runs things, their mindset, their ideology, their driving philosophy, what makes them tick.
[00:35:23.197 --> 00:35:34.522]  We show how the Nazis grew out of a German death cult that created Bohemian Grove, that created Skull and Bones, that controls our country and is supporting Arnold A. Lowe Schwarzenegger.
[00:35:35.662 --> 00:35:39.644]  We also confront David Gergen, the Karl Rove of four administrations.
[00:35:39.664 --> 00:35:44.066]  He doesn't deny the rituals, he just says, none of your business at Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:47.067]  We also confront Michael Moore for doing a 9-11 whitewash.
[00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:49.948]  It's a powerful video!
[00:35:50.805 --> 00:36:18.767]  That is non-stop information and it is riveting according to all the reviews we've been getting from folks that have been watching it at PrisonPlanet.TV We've been putting up a lot of sections of the film of course for free for the general public to watch in hopes that you'll wake others up and in hopes you'll become members at PrisonPlanet.TV to watch the new film in its entirety and to look at all the other videos I've done there on the website by Weekly TV Reports
[00:36:20.248 --> 00:36:25.493]  And of course, on top of my weekly TV reports I do, you can now get my Best of Austin TV show.
[00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:26.494]  It's won Best of Austin.
[00:36:27.135 --> 00:36:27.995]  And the Reader's Poll.
[00:36:28.156 --> 00:36:32.199]  Now you can get that anywhere in the country or the world if you're a member of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.621]  Usually two episodes a week.
[00:36:33.741 --> 00:36:35.443]  Always one episode a week.
[00:36:35.483 --> 00:36:40.187]  Sometimes I just run a tape for the second show if I'm really, really busy.
[00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:44.471]  But bottom line folks, PrisonPlanet.TV
[00:36:45.962 --> 00:36:50.306]  You can go there, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions available.
[00:36:50.326 --> 00:36:52.367]  It takes about a minute and a half to sign up.

[00:37:13.956 --> 00:37:14.657]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:14.697 --> 00:37:15.677]  That's triple 8.
[00:37:15.717 --> 00:37:15.877]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:37:15.997 --> 00:37:17.879]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:22.001]  And I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:46.555]  And I beseech thee, get the films, make copies of them.
[00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:48.956]  I've done the math.
[00:37:49.456 --> 00:37:55.298]  One video of you make ten copies and half the people that get the film from you make copies can turn into over a hundred videos.
[00:37:56.378 --> 00:37:56.738]  Easily.
[00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:05.641]  If you, let's say a thousand videos go out and half the people make ten copies, we're looking at over a million videos.
[00:38:07.482 --> 00:38:11.663]  And it is such an incredible effect that you've had, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:38:12.429 --> 00:38:13.369]  By making copies.
[00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:14.970]  So get Marshall Law.
[00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.910]  Make copies, please.
[00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:18.671]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:23.812]  It is up to you to take action.
[00:38:23.872 --> 00:38:24.112]  Okay.
[00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:26.333]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:38:26.373 --> 00:38:27.553]  Thank you so much for holding.
[00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:32.034]  And Stavros, in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:38:32.074 --> 00:38:32.454]  Go ahead.
[00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:33.595]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:34.075]  How you doing?
[00:38:34.415 --> 00:38:34.595]  Good.
[00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:39.683]  I have a story up here, keeping up with what you could call Pedophile Week.
[00:38:40.224 --> 00:38:45.810]  I got this thing from Workers Vanguard, which is from the Spartacist League Trotskyites.
[00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.573]  I'm just going to quote a couple of things from their article.
[00:38:48.613 --> 00:38:49.734]  You can find this online too.
[00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:55.749]  It says, uh, about NABLA, which is the North American Man-Boy Lovers Association.
[00:38:55.969 --> 00:39:12.938]  And for those that just joined us, we did two interviews this week, uh, with Senator DeCamp exposing this, and how it connects into Gannon and the fake reporters, and then we also interviewed Tom Flacco, and we also interviewed a retired New York City detective, but go ahead.
[00:39:13.098 --> 00:39:13.418]  That's right.
[00:39:14.142 --> 00:39:26.510]  So it says, Namblus, North American Man-Boy Lovers Association, name, is perennially dragged through the plentiful Boston mud, having been pounded for over 20 years by media smears and witch-hunting prosecutions.
[00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:34.715]  We and the Spartacist League Trotskyite have repeatedly defended this tiny beleaguered group as an elementary act of proletarian decency.
[00:39:35.427 --> 00:39:43.315]  We oppose criminalizing their advocacy of the eminently reasonable proposition that youth who have sexual feelings be allowed to express them.
[00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:48.980]  NAMBLA simply advocates the decriminalization of consensual sex between men and boys.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.643]  So they're basically out in the open promoting pedophilia.
[00:39:53.024 --> 00:39:59.490]  And what people have to remember... Sir, and of course the Trotskyite Spartacus League, and Spartacus was the codename of Adam Weisshaub,
[00:40:00.497 --> 00:40:21.703]  So, you can see that right there in your face, the neocons, and this is mainstream news folks, we're talking ABC News, Globe and Mail, they are Trotskyites, we've had Ron Paul on, they were the fourth international that said we've got to take over the conservatives in America, but the American Psychological Association
[00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:34.225]  Founded by the convicted CIA kidnapper, this is even on the History Channel, Dr. Ewing Cameron, came out four years ago and said that pedophilia is good.
[00:40:34.745 --> 00:40:38.646]  And then when Dr. Laura came out against it, she was boycotted and attacked.
[00:40:39.046 --> 00:40:41.707]  She's the bad person for being against it.
[00:40:42.027 --> 00:40:42.587]  Give me a break.
[00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:43.868]  No, this is sick.
[00:40:43.968 --> 00:40:46.909]  And the thing is, some of these people who are putting the newspaper out,
[00:40:48.044 --> 00:40:53.489]  When they were asked, oh, you know, where do you get the money to print out so many newspapers, right?
[00:40:53.509 --> 00:40:55.991]  Like, these other groups like Socialist Worker, etc., etc.
[00:40:56.031 --> 00:41:00.115]  They're like, oh, we get money from businessmen who invest in us.
[00:41:00.415 --> 00:41:04.339]  And they say, oh, they don't care because they quote-unquote make money off of this.
[00:41:04.839 --> 00:41:05.580]  Now, I hear you.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.922]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:08.663 --> 00:41:11.265]  I mean, look, on this whole horrible subject,
[00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:18.195]  You've got to understand, folks, that they are trying to change our worldviews.
[00:41:18.255 --> 00:41:21.538]  They are trying to manipulate us to accept all this.
[00:41:22.338 --> 00:41:24.700]  And the globalists are predators, bottom line.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.224]  And Dambla, this was in my first film, we just mention it in passing.
[00:41:29.964 --> 00:41:35.549]  We mention how Kurt Voltheim was a Nazi, and how the UN protected him and didn't want him to lose his job.
[00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:39.052]  When it came out, he was a top Nazi, I mean, actually doing the killings.
[00:41:40.638 --> 00:41:44.679]  And then on top of it, we show how the U.N.
[00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:48.720]  has NAMBLA as a member of its non-governmental organizations.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.221]  And on top of that, it's now come out with the U.N.
[00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:57.122]  putting out these child handbooks for the third world promoting this.
[00:41:58.783 --> 00:41:59.803]  It is so horrible.
[00:41:59.843 --> 00:42:01.203]  These people exploit children.
[00:42:01.243 --> 00:42:02.344]  They do horrible things.
[00:42:02.784 --> 00:42:06.765]  They need to be put in prison, or if they hurt children, they need to be executed.
[00:42:07.745 --> 00:42:11.428]  I want them executed after a jury of their peers finds them guilty.
[00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:17.752]  In case you think this is an oxymoron or I'm being contradictory, I am for the death penalty.
[00:42:19.593 --> 00:42:29.279]  I just believe this government is so criminal and has been caught framing so many innocent people that I don't trust this government to carry out the death penalty.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.002]  People who don't understand that, that's a three-dimensional view of politics.
[00:42:34.523 --> 00:42:37.505]  Again, in politics it's either you are or you aren't.
[00:42:38.454 --> 00:42:42.236]  To understand this, look, I believe in the state death penalty.
[00:42:43.836 --> 00:42:47.458]  I believe in the state death penalty, and I do believe there should be the appeals process.
[00:42:47.478 --> 00:42:48.898]  It's a very serious situation.
[00:42:49.959 --> 00:42:56.502]  And I believe it should only be in the most extraordinary of cases, and death penalties should only be handed down in the sentencing phase by a jury of the peers.
[00:42:57.702 --> 00:42:59.563]  We need to kill these people.
[00:43:00.683 --> 00:43:00.983]  Alright?
[00:43:01.023 --> 00:43:07.286]  It's really that, every mammal out there on the face of the earth will defend itself when it's young to the
[00:43:08.237 --> 00:43:08.778]  Unto death!
[00:43:09.618 --> 00:43:15.583]  But I do not support a federal death penalty because the federal government is completely and totally criminal.
[00:43:16.023 --> 00:43:19.906]  And if it continues to federalize the states, I will oppose the death penalty outright.
[00:43:21.207 --> 00:43:22.988]  But there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:23.689 --> 00:43:25.130]  We need to execute these people.
[00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.311]  Kyle in California.
[00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:28.452]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[00:43:28.512 --> 00:43:28.993]  Go ahead.
[00:43:29.953 --> 00:43:30.934]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:30.974 --> 00:43:32.255]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:32.736]  Welcome.
[00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:34.357]  Thank you for your humble attitude.
[00:43:34.397 --> 00:43:35.317]  I really appreciate it.
[00:43:35.338 --> 00:43:35.898]  It's refreshing.
[00:43:36.266 --> 00:43:43.476]  I just want to say a few weeks ago I visibly remember checking out MSNBC, the little bottom line with the real news.
[00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:47.522]  Arnold has no regrets about taking steroids.
[00:43:47.843 --> 00:43:49.305]  And we got all this hullabaloo.
[00:43:49.525 --> 00:43:50.727]  It's pretty funny to me.
[00:43:51.714 --> 00:43:52.874]  See, that's his M.O.
[00:43:53.014 --> 00:43:54.255]  is just flaunting.
[00:43:54.795 --> 00:43:55.515]  Yeah, so what?
[00:43:55.535 --> 00:43:56.315]  I did it to the women.
[00:43:56.555 --> 00:43:57.195]  Yeah, so what?
[00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:57.995]  I took steroids.
[00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:58.615]  Yeah, so what?
[00:43:58.635 --> 00:43:59.715]  I'm in gay magazines.
[00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:00.916]  Yeah, so what?
[00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:01.756]  Yeah, so what?
[00:44:01.796 --> 00:44:02.916]  I like Kurt Volk.
[00:44:02.976 --> 00:44:04.236]  I don't care if he's a Nazi.
[00:44:04.796 --> 00:44:05.356]  So what?
[00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:06.677]  I mean, it's just so what?
[00:44:07.237 --> 00:44:08.617]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:44:09.137 --> 00:44:10.417]  What a tremendous example.
[00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:13.798]  By the way, he has been THE poster boy for steroids, folks.
[00:44:14.138 --> 00:44:15.878]  He made them fashionable in the 80s.
[00:44:15.938 --> 00:44:16.298]  Go ahead.
[00:44:17.199 --> 00:44:19.119]  I was going to say, what a tremendous
[00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:23.550]  He's a role model for our young athletes in the States here.
[00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.651]  He's a beautiful leader.
[00:44:25.991 --> 00:44:26.691]  Let me tell you something.
[00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:29.052]  Listen, I know people that have taken anabolic steroids.
[00:44:29.392 --> 00:44:30.372]  I've talked to doctors.
[00:44:31.013 --> 00:44:32.793]  They are really bad for you.
[00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:37.715]  Now I see articles going, well, steroids aren't that bad.
[00:44:37.995 --> 00:44:39.255]  Oh, no, they're not that bad.
[00:44:39.275 --> 00:44:47.098]  They just enlarge your heart and make you aggressive and make your males genitalia basically
[00:44:48.777 --> 00:44:49.538]  Get cancer?
[00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:51.200]  Shrivel up to nothing?
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.262]  I mean, who wants... This is horrible!
[00:44:53.402 --> 00:44:55.264]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:44:55.304 --> 00:44:59.608]  Yeah, there was a great section in Marshall Law there about that at the end there.
[00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:09.519]  I wanted to say, I don't know if you intended to, but I caught myself laughing so many times at these compromising positions you'd get these guys in, that it's kind of a de facto comedy, I thought.
[00:45:09.912 --> 00:45:31.916]  But actually I did, I'm calling for a specific reason Alex, I've heard a couple times about you guys commenting about, and some callers commenting about Amy Goodman and Democracy Now!, and I've heard myself around here, she's a very radical speaker and got some pretty hardcore views, but there's also some other, it's not her that is that entire show, it's Juan Gonzalez who's been uncovering the depleted uranium and
[00:45:32.358 --> 00:45:48.967]  All kinds of other people involved in that and I was wondering if you would have somebody on from that show and have some Bin Laden debates because there's just there's maybe there on this show there seems to be no question at all but in the in the rest of the world there definitely seems to be the belief that this is our enemy.
[00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:52.703]  And I just wonder, if you could help me out with that, I would greatly appreciate it.
[00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:56.584]  And thanks also for... Well, I mean, I'm going to elaborate, so maybe I'm dense.
[00:45:57.004 --> 00:45:57.624]  Bin Laden?
[00:45:57.644 --> 00:45:58.364]  I don't understand.
[00:45:58.864 --> 00:46:12.027]  Well, I'm just... The view... I understand Amy Goodman in her public speeches views Bin Laden as the enemy, and they're getting into this freedom fighter mindset, much like Ward Churchill.
[00:46:12.347 --> 00:46:19.049]  And so, instead of recognizing Bin Laden as a useful tool, like I feel he is,
[00:46:21.009 --> 00:46:26.811]  The view still remains... By useful tool you mean to the globalists?
[00:46:27.471 --> 00:46:27.991]  Absolutely.
[00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:29.712]  Okay, well thanks for the call.
[00:46:30.012 --> 00:46:30.952]  Let me try to answer that.
[00:46:30.972 --> 00:46:39.556]  I have some friends who get her show on satellite on five days a week on Austin Cable.
[00:46:40.136 --> 00:46:41.196]  They're the sponsors of it.
[00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:48.139]  They've been very effective at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of access TV stations around the country.
[00:46:48.795 --> 00:46:55.540]  To get the access stations, and my local, some of my friends are the sponsors of it here locally, to get it on five days a week.
[00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:59.624]  And they're also on regular cable, on the free speech network.
[00:46:59.944 --> 00:47:00.624]  That's how they get it.
[00:47:01.725 --> 00:47:02.706]  On free speech TV.
[00:47:03.386 --> 00:47:08.530]  And so I watch, in fact it comes on before my show.
[00:47:09.831 --> 00:47:11.553]  I only get the show twice a week.
[00:47:11.593 --> 00:47:15.676]  The show as important as this gets to be on every day, five days a week here locally.
[00:47:17.845 --> 00:47:18.846]  I'm on right after it.
[00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:26.831]  And so a lot of times when I'm done setting up the live broadcast, I'll flip it on and watch 10 minutes of it, and it's just a bunch of garbage.
[00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:28.612]  I mean, I have to really be honest with you.
[00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:46.764]  I mean, yes, 80% of it's really good, depleted uranium's bad, the globalists are bad, globalization is bad, but oh, Bin Laden's real and he attacked us, and, and, uh, you know, the Democrats are going to save us, and guns are bad,
[00:47:47.858 --> 00:47:49.339]  And the UN is good.
[00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:53.481]  See, the globalists know you're gonna wake up to the fact that something's controlled.
[00:47:54.762 --> 00:48:00.464]  And they hope you knock through one level of it, and then think, oh, it's liberal or conservative, or one group's good and the other group's bad.
[00:48:00.484 --> 00:48:00.704]  No, no.
[00:48:01.065 --> 00:48:02.385]  Both sides are controlled.
[00:48:03.646 --> 00:48:06.107]  And then Ward Churchill takes it even further.
[00:48:07.247 --> 00:48:16.432]  Ward Churchill comes out and says, you know, Bin Laden's basically a freedom fighter, and the people that died in the towers weren't innocent, they were basically the technocracy of the Nazis.
[00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:20.243]  And that plays into the paradigm.
[00:48:20.263 --> 00:48:24.026]  I mean, the neocons get the point of that and say, see how bad the left is?
[00:48:24.586 --> 00:48:25.587]  See how bad they are?
[00:48:25.627 --> 00:48:26.848]  They're saying Al-Qaeda's good?
[00:48:26.868 --> 00:48:27.649]  See, they're traitors!
[00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:30.392]  Let's arrest all these people and put them in work camps!
[00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:42.022]  Whereas the facts show, you'd have to be an idiot not to know this if you're informed, that Al-Qaeda's CIA-controlled, that the Arabs never stood to gain from these attacks, that they've all denied it,
[00:48:42.992 --> 00:48:44.453]  But none of them are connected to it.
[00:48:44.973 --> 00:48:56.659]  But this is a CIA-controlled body with a bunch of useful idiot Arabs under it who think they're part of some jihad, when really they're the crisis creators so the globalists can go in and take over the Middle East.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.481]  And so Ward Churchill comes out and plays into that.
[00:49:01.862 --> 00:49:03.803]  Michael Moore comes in and plays into it.
[00:49:04.103 --> 00:49:08.165]  You know, Bush is an idiot, he was fishing too much, he was on too many vacations.
[00:49:08.505 --> 00:49:10.366]  That's why Al Qaeda was able to attack us.
[00:49:11.263 --> 00:49:18.488]  Well, that takes the whole debate and falsifies it into, you know, Bin Laden really is out there still threatening us.
[00:49:18.528 --> 00:49:19.648]  Bin Laden's real.
[00:49:19.668 --> 00:49:21.029]  Bin Laden's a real threat.
[00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.612]  Not that he's a CIA creation protected by Bush and his controllers.
[00:49:27.414 --> 00:49:29.135]  So, this is what they do, Kyle.
[00:49:29.315 --> 00:49:30.896]  And, you know, Amy Goodman.
[00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:32.677]  Yeah, I ought to try to get Amy Goodman on this show.
[00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:35.179]  Jeff in Ohio.
[00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:35.759]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:41.052]  Prison TV member listening on the GCN 32K feed.
[00:49:41.072 --> 00:49:58.344]  I caught a almost unbelievably humorous story the other day on a news channel where they were hiding police in the woods with battery-operated radar guns dressed up in camo to catch speeders.
[00:49:59.545 --> 00:50:04.448]  And after I watched it, I heard them mention a computer system that they use called the
[00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:07.090]  The Prophecy Computer System.
[00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.991]  Have you heard about that?
[00:50:08.551 --> 00:50:09.212]  No, I haven't.
[00:50:09.372 --> 00:50:10.432]  Oh, well, you'll love this.
[00:50:10.592 --> 00:50:11.333]  This is a new one.
[00:50:11.973 --> 00:50:16.336]  Pittsburghlive.com is the Valley News Dispatch.
[00:50:17.076 --> 00:50:26.502]  And state police computer screen is replacing colored pins on county maps to help maintain state police to predict crime trends.
[00:50:27.102 --> 00:50:33.066]  A goal to identify trouble spots and better direct patrols to reduce drug and driving accidents and death.
[00:50:33.826 --> 00:50:37.967]  And they say that this is great, a valuable tool to help protect citizens.
[00:50:38.907 --> 00:50:44.949]  Well, this is all part of the militarization, and they're training our police to be covert.
[00:50:45.049 --> 00:50:48.930]  So, and I am aware of them dressing up in camo and hiding in the woods around the country.
[00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:56.031]  And so, but see, they train them on something innocuous like that, then it shifts over into something much more serious.
[00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:58.472]  Stay there, we'll discuss it more on the other side, Jeff.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:08.282]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.602 --> 00:51:09.963]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.163 --> 00:51:12.383]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.523 --> 00:51:14.604]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.884 --> 00:51:19.826]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:24.187]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.727 --> 00:51:26.228]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.288 --> 00:51:36.954]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.995]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:13.159 --> 00:54:18.122]  Their lives are being exposed more and more readily every single day.
[00:54:34.764 --> 00:54:41.488]  Let's go now to Jeff and let him finish up so I can go to Patrick and Lynn and others.
[00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:43.770]  Jeff, this is very interesting.
[00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:48.853]  Everything is the military garb, the military salutes, military activity.
[00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:55.698]  Governors, mayors, county commissioners, cops, firemen call us civilians.
[00:54:56.398 --> 00:54:58.059]  Well, we're all civilians.
[00:54:58.099 --> 00:55:00.081]  We have a civilian government.
[00:55:00.461 --> 00:55:03.543]  But the nomenclature is all changing.
[00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:06.948]  And it's all becoming militarized.
[00:55:06.988 --> 00:55:07.509]  Anything else?
[00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:19.639]  You know, it amazes me, since you've opened my eyes to the New World Order, how they use these Orwellian biblical terms to name these things that are set to control us.
[00:55:19.799 --> 00:55:24.663]  Yeah, they call the big computer in Brussels, and this is mainstream news, this is not a joke, the Beast,
[00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:35.377]  They call these different RFID systems, you know, Angel, Digital Angel, Archangel, Revelation, and it's a flaunting!
[00:55:36.217 --> 00:55:39.139]  I wasn't aware of this particular program you mentioned, but it sounds loving.
[00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:41.961]  Yeah, Prophecy, so you might want to check into that.
[00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:43.441]  Well, see, it's pre-crime.
[00:55:43.461 --> 00:55:44.202]  That's what they're saying.
[00:55:44.282 --> 00:55:47.683]  They're prophesying with their computer algorithm models.
[00:55:47.723 --> 00:55:59.526]  And I did know about these programs they're putting in the police cars, and swiping your driver's license, and cameras on the squad cars in L.A., constantly scanning faces as they drive, scanning license plates.
[00:56:00.626 --> 00:56:01.626]  It's all part of freedom, sir.
[00:56:01.947 --> 00:56:03.647]  Well, we're lifting you up in prayer, Alex.
[00:56:03.687 --> 00:56:04.807]  You're doing a great job.
[00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:06.088]  Keep up the good work.
[00:56:06.228 --> 00:56:09.449]  Well, I appreciate your calling.
[00:56:09.489 --> 00:56:10.389]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:56:11.127 --> 00:56:13.108]  I salute you, Jeff and Ohio.
[00:56:13.448 --> 00:56:15.429]  Patrick and Tejas, you're on the air.
[00:56:15.469 --> 00:56:16.050]  Go ahead.
[00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.210]  Hello, Alex.
[00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:17.911]  Hello.
[00:56:18.711 --> 00:56:23.934]  What would the police do if we took somebody against their will and drugged them like these psychiatrists do?
[00:56:23.954 --> 00:56:25.355]  They'd lock us up, wouldn't they?
[00:56:26.955 --> 00:56:28.296]  Well, that's part of the freedom, sir.
[00:56:28.316 --> 00:56:39.242]  Yeah, well, I... I mean, also, I've read that every minute and 15 seconds there's somebody involuntarily committed into a mental institution and drugged against their will.
[00:56:41.128 --> 00:56:43.271]  I too have read that number, yes.
[00:56:54.468 --> 00:56:58.530]  Bit and chewed her mom's flesh off of her mom.
[00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.051]  Well, I think she needs to be in the mental institution.
[00:57:01.071 --> 00:57:05.113]  Well, it was reported she had taken Prozac earlier, so... Oh, of course.
[00:57:05.313 --> 00:57:07.154]  You know, these scientists are so smart.
[00:57:07.254 --> 00:57:09.955]  I mean, why don't they get a brain and try it themselves, you know?
[00:57:10.075 --> 00:57:11.396]  I hear you, and thanks for the call.
[00:57:11.456 --> 00:57:18.359]  Look, they admit that... Again, they try to claim, well, that's because people are already mentally ill.
[00:57:18.379 --> 00:57:19.180]  They take the Prozac.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:19.800]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:20.498 --> 00:57:22.399]  They've done a whole bunch of big studies.
[00:57:22.899 --> 00:57:24.860]  These are all public, over the last 20 years.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.381]  With these serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:57:27.942 --> 00:57:32.424]  Now they're coming out with drugs that affect multiple base chemicals in the brain, that are even worse.
[00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:34.765]  But we've read the studies here on air.
[00:57:35.866 --> 00:57:42.609]  They take people who are depressed or got problems, and they put them on Prozac type class drugs, and they actually get worse.
[00:57:43.229 --> 00:57:46.231]  They put people on sugar pill, they actually get better 3 to 1.
[00:57:47.822 --> 00:57:48.642]  They just found St.
[00:57:48.682 --> 00:57:52.524]  John's Wort is three to one better when compared to Zoloft.
[00:57:53.645 --> 00:57:53.885]  St.
[00:57:53.925 --> 00:57:59.988]  John's Wort really does help people who, let's say in the dark of the winter, have lower levels of certain hormones.
[00:58:00.088 --> 00:58:02.990]  If you're not getting enough sunshine, you're supposed to get out of the house.
[00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:08.232]  I recommend getting out in the sun instead of taking St.
[00:58:08.252 --> 00:58:09.053]  John's Wort.
[00:58:09.233 --> 00:58:11.354]  I know folks think St.
[00:58:11.374 --> 00:58:12.475]  John's Wort don't have any problems.
[00:58:12.935 --> 00:58:15.056]  That's why the government wants to restrict you having that.
[00:58:16.058 --> 00:58:18.580]  That will help you with your serotonin levels.
[00:58:19.821 --> 00:58:22.043]  Alright, we are going to end this hour now.
[00:58:22.083 --> 00:58:25.045]  When we come back with the second hour, I'll get to Len and a few others.
[00:58:25.465 --> 00:58:28.928]  Then we have Andre Eggleson joining us.
[00:58:29.749 --> 00:58:33.692]  South Florida Speaks Out with Andre Eggleson.
[00:58:33.872 --> 00:58:36.834]  He wrote a book about the Federal Reserve.
[00:58:36.914 --> 00:58:37.895]  Really interesting guy.
[00:58:38.495 --> 00:58:43.239]  I look forward to speaking with him and I'm sure he looks forward to hearing from you with your calls as well.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:48.065]  I'll also throw a smattering of PNews articles out at him and get his take on that.
[00:58:48.986 --> 00:58:49.766]  Hello fo- Big Brother.
[00:58:49.827 --> 00:58:50.407]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:01.992]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.652 --> 00:59:03.513]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.233 --> 00:59:05.114]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.134 --> 00:59:09.756]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.997 --> 00:59:14.139]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.401]  That's right, live from Austin, Texas.
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:17.961]  Thank you.
[00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:19.382]  We're now into the second hour.
[00:59:19.402 --> 00:59:22.204]  Thirty seconds into the second hour.
[00:59:22.224 --> 00:59:26.827]  We've got Andre Eggleson joining us to talk about the Federal Reserve.
[00:59:26.847 --> 00:59:28.828]  Don't want to miss that in the next segment.
[00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:35.195]  Also coming up, we'll get more into Lab Fireball, maybe a black hole.
[00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:42.076]  BBC reporting, that's what the researchers are doing, creating stuff that could be very destructive.
[00:59:43.457 --> 00:59:46.917]  Malibu Gas Station already charging more than $3 a gallon.
[00:59:47.598 --> 00:59:49.738]  A bunch of news concerning torture.
[00:59:51.258 --> 00:59:59.780]  Oh yes, they're now out there, Porter Goss, the new head of the CIA, saying, yeah, we're not ruling out that we're torturing people, we're not stopping.
[01:00:00.413 --> 01:00:03.515]  Pentagon also developing super-speed spacecrafts, says a report.
[01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:12.279]  And tonight, they've got their whole new generations of weapon systems that really were developed over two decades ago that they're now announcing.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.481]  In a blow to Bush, Senators reject cuts to Medicaid.
[01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:19.643]  McGuire refuses to say if he took steroids or not.
[01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:21.884]  Well, just admit you did, like Arnold, and say, I don't apologize.
[01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:26.447]  A China-Russia war games aimed at practicing invasion of Taiwan.
[01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.668]  This is from the Russian's own major news agency.
[01:00:29.438 --> 01:00:32.699]  Israel armed itself with nuclear weapons over 40 years ago.
[01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:36.801]  Now finally coming out in the mainstream news, decades old news for us.
[01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:41.142]  EU fusses over cyber humans, this is out of the register.
[01:00:42.803 --> 01:00:44.023]  And a lot more coming up.
[01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.984]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Lynn in North Carolina.
[01:00:47.024 --> 01:00:48.605]  Lynn, thanks for holding, welcome.
[01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.325]  Hi Alex, first time caller.
[01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:51.986]  Welcome!
[01:00:52.326 --> 01:00:57.147]  I think the Atlanta courthouse killings had government operation written all over it.
[01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:58.708]  They had the motive, they had to get the
[01:00:59.252 --> 01:01:00.254]  We're good to go.
[01:01:10.456 --> 01:01:25.207]  Oh, they've already been saying that for about three years, that, oh, officers have their guns taken, we've got to have it where you're wearing a bracelet or a ring, or the gun has a little finger pad where you've got to scan your finger.
[01:01:25.628 --> 01:01:30.591]  Oh, and then now in Miami they said, maybe we should just put chips in the officers.
[01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:35.115]  Yeah, another... Let me ask you, are they saying that now about this case?
[01:01:36.816 --> 01:01:39.058]  I haven't read that specifically, but I'm sure they will be.
[01:01:39.753 --> 01:01:57.643]  But another red flag to me was this article from the Baptist Press about this hostage, Miss Smith, who is practically converting the killer to Christianity by reading him, to him from this New Age book, Purpose Driven Life, which is being heavily promoted to all the people in the American churches.
[01:01:57.883 --> 01:02:05.387]  Yeah, and again, I keep hearing about how it's this New Age booklet, and so, it is suspicious, but who knows?
[01:02:05.747 --> 01:02:07.428]  And she was reading to him from Chapter 33, Day 33,
[01:02:09.582 --> 01:02:12.163]  of the book, and Nichols age is given as 33.
[01:02:12.243 --> 01:02:16.425]  So they put number 33 three times in the article.
[01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:17.786]  The crime was committed on 3-11.
[01:02:17.986 --> 01:02:20.087]  You know, three times 11 is 33.
[01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:21.108]  No, you know what?
[01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:24.129]  I said they'd probably pull some type of government terror op on 3-11.
[01:02:24.149 --> 01:02:30.152]  911 days after 9-11, we had the Madrid bombing, and then 365 days later on 3-11 again, we have the shooting in the courthouse.
[01:02:37.245 --> 01:02:40.248]  And you're right, he was 33 and she was reading to him.
[01:02:40.268 --> 01:02:42.069]  I did see that out of chapter 33.
[01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.671]  I mean, this is really suspicious.
[01:02:44.351 --> 01:02:46.433]  Because the globalists are like any other psychopath.
[01:02:46.473 --> 01:02:50.657]  You ever read how psychopaths like to leave clues and codes with the cops?
[01:02:51.057 --> 01:02:51.978]  At least you've all heard of this.
[01:02:52.298 --> 01:02:55.441]  And then this guy, magically, is doing all of this.
[01:02:56.061 --> 01:02:57.623]  Maybe it's a coincidence.
[01:02:57.663 --> 01:02:59.885]  Maybe it's a coincidence that the lone gunman on Fox
[01:03:00.675 --> 01:03:06.277]  Had a show about the government hijacking a jet to fly to the World Trade Center to invade Afghanistan and for martial law.
[01:03:06.577 --> 01:03:10.398]  Maybe it's a coincidence that, you know, one of the flights was 9-11.
[01:03:10.698 --> 01:03:17.060]  Maybe it's a coincidence that the New York lottery came up 9-11 on the one-year anniversary and the Chicago Mercantile came up 9-11.000.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.900]  One out of 14 plus billion.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.041]  I'm sure it's all a coincidence, okay?
[01:03:23.157 --> 01:03:32.059]  The number of the Antichrist is 11, and they like to put multiples of 11 in their news articles to kind of signal to the other Illuminati that they've done this.
[01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:34.959]  Very interesting.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.820]  Mr. Nichols, he's no ordinary street thug.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.821]  He's a college-educated computer technician and his father is a Treasury Department official.
[01:03:44.241 --> 01:03:45.242]  Very interesting.
[01:03:45.262 --> 01:03:52.183]  Just like Harrison Klebold, nuclear physicist, Air Force officer who's involved in secret programs.
[01:03:53.653 --> 01:04:04.384]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:04:04.564 --> 01:04:12.172]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:15.515]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:04:15.795 --> 01:04:21.561]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:04:21.842 --> 01:04:28.008]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:32.253]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:04:32.313 --> 01:04:34.175]  The water level is always visible.
[01:04:34.355 --> 01:04:40.298]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:04:40.538 --> 01:04:46.861]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:47.001 --> 01:04:52.343]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[01:04:52.363 --> 01:04:57.765]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.965 --> 01:05:02.407]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.527 --> 01:05:03.768]  There is a chance
[01:05:04.288 --> 01:05:06.912]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:06.952 --> 01:05:08.333]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:09.815]  Hannah Murray.
[01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:14.301]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.361 --> 01:05:21.309]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.429 --> 01:05:23.432]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:34.234]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.414 --> 01:05:39.775]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:55.498 --> 01:06:00.503]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:06:00.764 --> 01:06:03.366]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:12.116]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:02.150]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.631]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.352 --> 01:07:05.232]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.252 --> 01:07:09.816]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.117 --> 01:07:14.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:23.108]  Alright, we're now into our number 2 second segment, 8 minutes, 30 seconds, to be precise.
[01:07:23.897 --> 01:07:26.538]  It is Friday, the 18th day of March 2005.
[01:07:26.898 --> 01:07:28.458]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:36.220]  The websites are infowars.com, because there is a war on for your mind, and knowing that is half the battle.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:50.223]  Of course, we also have prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv, because the globalists, the controllers, the social architects, the slave masters, the dehumanizers, are building a giant prison planet in their own words.
[01:07:50.343 --> 01:07:52.804]  A control grid against free humanity.
[01:07:53.911 --> 01:07:57.233]  You've probably heard him on Coast to Coast AM or on David Joyce's broadcast.
[01:07:57.653 --> 01:08:02.556]  I kept meaning in the last year to get him on, but for some reason, with some guess, it just falls through the cracks.
[01:08:04.077 --> 01:08:18.005]  But we did get him on, and he's Andre Eglashon, and we are just honored to, uh, Eglashon, I can't seem to, it's a great name, I can't seem to pronounce that properly, Andre Eglashon, and his website
[01:08:18.605 --> 01:08:21.048]  He's really up to speed on the criminal Federal Reserve
[01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:39.481]  Well, it's a pleasure and an honor to be with you as well, Alex.
[01:08:57.907 --> 01:09:01.150]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you woke up to the Matrix.
[01:09:01.891 --> 01:09:09.557]  Well, it all started when I first was made aware that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned company.
[01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:11.159]  It's a cartel.
[01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:13.481]  It's a corporation that's set up for profit.
[01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:17.324]  When I found that out, then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:09:17.404 --> 01:09:19.927]  This is not right because I had read
[01:09:21.088 --> 01:09:29.314]  The Constitution has studied it a little bit, and I found, you know, it to be diametrically opposed with Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
[01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:37.441]  Paragraph 5 specifically states that Congress alone shall print our money, or shall coin our money, and establish the weights and measures thereof.
[01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:43.826]  Then I started seeing that much of the precious metals were taken out of our money in 1964, I believe it was.
[01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:47.991]  And this bothered me.
[01:09:48.372 --> 01:10:03.661]  And the more I began to study the Federal Reserve System, the more I felt compelled, as an American citizen, in fulfillment of my responsibilities as a fourth branch of checks and balances in this country, to make as many people aware about it as possible.
[01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:09.305]  So this has led me to write my book, Thieves in the Temple, America Under the Federal Reserve System.
[01:10:09.745 --> 01:10:15.986]  To simply try to raise awareness as to what is controlling our monetary policy in this country.
[01:10:16.726 --> 01:10:22.027]  Now, there was another book called Secrets of the Temple, and why do you and others call it the Temple?
[01:10:22.647 --> 01:10:30.049]  Well, back during the time of the Messiah in Israel, the Temple was the center of commerce.
[01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:36.930]  Although Herod ruled Galilee during his life, the real power was in the hands of the Sanhedrin Council.
[01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:43.193]  One of the areas of business that they were dominant in was the area of money.
[01:10:43.593 --> 01:10:45.913]  Money changers that Christ whipped.
[01:10:46.274 --> 01:10:46.954]  Absolutely.
[01:10:46.994 --> 01:10:54.516]  It's the only time you read about him using force in his ministry was when he drove those money changers out of the temple for debauching the currency at that particular time.
[01:10:54.696 --> 01:10:56.197]  That is currency manipulation.
[01:10:56.217 --> 01:10:59.941]  You had to buy a particular coin for a particular sacrifice.
[01:11:00.281 --> 01:11:06.827]  They would only accept a certain coin, and they would make you pay for it in other real currency at a much higher level.
[01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:08.509]  It was a fiat currency they created.
[01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:10.130]  That's exactly right.
[01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:15.776]  And even the Bible itself, you know, talks about that kind of dishonest manipulation of currency.
[01:11:16.336 --> 01:11:18.558]  You can read about it in Amos 8 and 4.
[01:11:18.658 --> 01:11:19.319]  It gives you the
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.281]  The definition of what inflation is and how it was being done during biblical times.
[01:11:25.361 --> 01:11:26.562]  I'll read that verse for you.
[01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:39.225]  It reads, Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail, saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn, and the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat?
[01:11:39.725 --> 01:11:43.810]  Making the IFA small, that's artificially reducing the value of that currency.
[01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:48.315]  And the shekel great, that's artificially increasing the value of that currency.
[01:11:48.736 --> 01:11:51.259]  And falsifying the balances by deceit.
[01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:57.266]  Or in other words, they're dishonestly manipulating money and the exchange of money in their favor.
[01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:01.988]  Continuing, that we may buy the poor for silver.
[01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:03.928]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:12:03.968 --> 01:12:06.609]  They have bought the poor for silver in our country today.
[01:12:07.029 --> 01:12:10.029]  They have instituted a very draconian form of debt slavery.
[01:12:10.689 --> 01:12:24.152]  And it is tied to the type of rape and murder and torture and human rights atrocities that we're seeing going on right now in the Congo and Sudan and in so many other places in various and sundry times in our history.
[01:12:25.339 --> 01:12:40.514]  Any country, whether they're good, bad, or ugly, whether it's Serbia or Iraq, anybody that doesn't let the private global central banks, the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, into control things, they are in short order invaded and taken over.
[01:12:40.895 --> 01:12:41.495]  Absolutely.
[01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:44.879]  We don't care how despotic a regime is.
[01:12:45.639 --> 01:12:46.620]  To their own people.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:13:00.511]  As long as they will allow the United States unfettered access to the resources that are prerequisites for the industrialization of any society, of our society, and particularly in the future here in the 21st century.
[01:13:00.532 --> 01:13:03.614]  And about three years ago, some of the World Bank documents came out.
[01:13:03.714 --> 01:13:09.619]  They want control of those resources so those countries cannot industrialize and cannot be self-sufficient.
[01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:10.500]  Absolutely.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.262]  We want to be able to control the rate, pace, and sequence
[01:13:13.662 --> 01:13:14.143]  We're good to go.
[01:13:30.358 --> 01:13:39.345]  Some of it ends up recirculating around the world in search of a higher return on the investment, fleeing from the inflationary aspects of their softer currencies.
[01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:44.189]  You know, we think that this money is actually benefiting the civilians in these countries, but it's not.
[01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:48.753]  It's all being used as a pacifier for these despots.
[01:13:49.153 --> 01:14:05.813]  And the moment they get a leader that rises up and says, no, we want more equity from our resources, then the policy is no longer engagement, but it becomes confrontation and we will either call him a communist, well that was before the wall came down, now you will be labeled a terrorist and you'll be taken out of power.
[01:14:06.545 --> 01:14:14.331]  Now, for those who just joined us, because most of my listeners predominantly know what the Federal Reserve is, but a large group doesn't understand it.
[01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:17.674]  I mean, they think Federal Express is federal because it says federal.
[01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:22.298]  They think, you know, a local bank called Federal Savings is federal when it's not federal.
[01:14:22.738 --> 01:14:29.423]  Explain to people the history of the Federal Reserve, how it operates, how it's designed to put you into debt.
[01:14:29.483 --> 01:14:33.927]  It's impossible for a country to be solvent while under this parasitic system.
[01:14:34.207 --> 01:14:41.111]  Well, briefly, the Federal Reserve is America's fourth failed experiment with a privately owned central bank.
[01:14:41.532 --> 01:14:43.513]  We had three others prior to this one.
[01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:52.958]  Bankers have always wanted to control, and monetary scientists have always wanted to control the issuance of money and to have control over interest rates.
[01:14:53.499 --> 01:14:55.360]  This was started in our country.
[01:14:56.289 --> 01:15:06.493]  When Robert Morris, a Philadelphia banker, during the revolution created the Bank of North America, which was our first failed experiment with a privately owned central bank.
[01:15:06.513 --> 01:15:09.614]  They were given a two-year charter and they miserably bankrupted the country.
[01:15:10.175 --> 01:15:18.438]  Then Alexander Hamilton worked to create the first bank of the United States, which was our second failed experiment with a privately owned central bank.
[01:15:18.798 --> 01:15:19.639]  They did the same thing.
[01:15:19.679 --> 01:15:20.619]  They debauched our money.
[01:15:21.059 --> 01:15:22.640]  They tried to assassinate Hamilton.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:22.920]  Twice!
[01:15:42.453 --> 01:15:45.417]  Twice they tried to kill Andrew Jackson, and he even remarked about it.
[01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:48.501]  He said, the bank is trying to kill me, but I'm going to kill it!
[01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:49.562]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:49.662 --> 01:15:58.733]  That was Jackson, and of course, people got a little bit mad at Hamilton, and something bad happened to him.
[01:15:58.993 --> 01:15:59.874]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:15:59.895 --> 01:16:01.597]  He was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr.
[01:16:02.818 --> 01:16:20.511]  And then now, you know, after Andrew Jackson killed the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, and we went through a wildcat period when banking in America was largely unregulated, the bankers concocted a scheme to create a fourth privately owned central bank in this country in 1913, and that's the Federal Reserve.
[01:16:20.551 --> 01:16:22.493]  And it was snuck through Congress.
[01:16:23.053 --> 01:16:32.057]  On December 23rd, when everybody was away for Christmas, there was only three members of Congress present there, and they were all cronies of the bank, and the bill passed unanimously.
[01:16:32.077 --> 01:16:38.199]  Woodrow Wilson signed it into law the very next day, and we had a fourth privately owned central bank that came on the heels
[01:16:38.859 --> 01:16:41.820]  Four periods of extreme monetary crisis in our country.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:17:00.305]  And then they created the taxing mechanism with the 16th Amendment, the income tax, and at the same time, the 17th Amendment, taking our senators who were appointed by the elected legislatures, giving states a power veto over the federal government, and transferred them to Washington.
[01:17:00.605 --> 01:17:02.025]  That is exactly right.
[01:17:02.045 --> 01:17:06.246]  The 16th Amendment was never fully ratified by the necessary number of states.
[01:17:06.667 --> 01:17:08.147]  And it is the amendment.
[01:17:08.727 --> 01:17:15.951]  That established what the Supreme Court deemed several times in the 19th century was unconstitutional, and that is a federal income tax.
[01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:22.994]  So, you know, for all intents and purposes, for the last 91 years, they've been confiscating the American people's wealth in the open illegally.
[01:17:24.688 --> 01:17:47.007]  Now, we're going to break here in a second, but I want to go over how the Federal Reserve works, and explain to people this sleight of hand, this fraud, how this scam works, because people say, well, you know, the Federal Reserve, they've been doing a great job, but right after the Federal Reserve got power, then they gave us a Great Depression, and they bragged that all of this is engineered.
[01:17:47.467 --> 01:18:02.476]  Well, you're absolutely right, and most economists, even in the academic world, have concluded that the Great Depression and the stock market crash of the 1929 through 1939 was the result of malign policies coming out of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:18:02.496 --> 01:18:06.878]  So this is an accepted assessment of the role of the Fed in our history.
[01:18:07.779 --> 01:18:10.380]  How the Fed works, there are two schools of thought.
[01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:15.363]  One says that the Fed simply reacts to problems in the economy,
[01:18:15.923 --> 01:18:20.705]  And the other school of thought says that the Fed works to manipulate the economy.
[01:18:21.265 --> 01:18:28.367]  But, I mean, obviously it's the second case, because Greenspan routinely says, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, to control the economy.
[01:18:28.607 --> 01:18:38.590]  Now here it is, back in 1996, this guy talked about irrational exuberance, and we all remember the irrational exuberance speech, you know, we're spending too much, the deficits are too high.
[01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:43.732]  Andre, we've got a break, tell us about the irrational exuberance, and the Bohemian Grove member
[01:18:44.463 --> 01:18:47.489]  Greenspan, when we get back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.253]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:18:49.293 --> 01:18:49.734]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:54.657]  Are you losing your hair?
[01:18:54.998 --> 01:18:56.439]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.921]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[01:18:58.441 --> 01:19:00.103]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[01:19:00.323 --> 01:19:04.928]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[01:19:05.269 --> 01:19:08.292]  I've been using Avocor now for four months and it's a great product.

[01:19:10.835 --> 01:19:11.576]  It works!
[01:19:11.936 --> 01:19:14.519]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[01:19:15.965 --> 01:19:20.787]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?

[01:19:49.941 --> 01:19:55.846]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.969]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:03.373]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:03.813 --> 01:20:04.634]  So what do you do?
[01:20:04.954 --> 01:20:09.518]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:09.998 --> 01:20:12.140]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:27.331]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:20:52.768 --> 01:20:53.748]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:53.828 --> 01:20:58.610]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:06.573]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:06.853 --> 01:21:12.215]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:12.415 --> 01:21:19.397]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:19.697 --> 01:21:25.043]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:25.303 --> 01:21:30.028]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:21:30.369 --> 01:21:37.997]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:21:38.317 --> 01:21:41.020]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.542]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:21:44.863 --> 01:21:46.064]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.124 --> 01:21:46.324]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.344 --> 01:21:49.286]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:22:04.227 --> 01:22:08.330]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:17.455]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:22:18.256 --> 01:22:23.599]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:22:23.619 --> 01:22:31.704]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:32.504 --> 01:22:32.984]  Just call 1-800
[01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:34.602]  516-8736.
[01:22:34.662 --> 01:22:35.363]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:35.403 --> 01:22:36.664]  It's absolutely free.
[01:22:36.684 --> 01:22:39.126]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:39.767]  Just call right now.
[01:23:02.768 --> 01:23:21.221]  We're talking to Andre Eglishan, a talk show host in Florida, author of a new book, Thieves in the Temple, and a little bit later we'll tell you how to get this powerful book that I recommend everybody purchase, and after you're done reading it, share it with your friends and family.
[01:23:21.842 --> 01:23:24.203]  Andre, let's get into the brass tacks.
[01:23:24.704 --> 01:23:30.688]  Later we'll get into who controls the Federal Reserve and how it's just a unit of this global banking cartel, but I want to get
[01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:35.186]  into the specifics for people to understand how the scam works.
[01:23:35.246 --> 01:23:42.349]  I mean, it's because of the Federal Reserve that a car that cost $15,000 ten years ago cost $30,000.
[01:23:42.469 --> 01:23:55.153]  It's because of the Federal Reserve that 30-40 years ago a guy could have a blue-collar job and have a nice house in a two-car garage and put one of his children through college and go on vacations.
[01:23:55.533 --> 01:23:56.313]  Now you can't.
[01:23:57.174 --> 01:24:02.579]  It's because of the Federal Reserve System and their own documents that both the man and woman basically have to work.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.602]  Let's go over how the Federal Reserve actually operates.
[01:24:06.203 --> 01:24:09.946]  Well, the way they get money into the money supply is two ways.
[01:24:11.267 --> 01:24:14.030]  They can either buy bonds on the open market.
[01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:16.693]  The federal government will write a bond, an IOU.
[01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:21.848]  These are purchased by the Federal Reserve System, and this adds money to the money supply.
[01:24:22.789 --> 01:24:29.137]  And every time the money is deposited into a bank, the bank can then loan ten times that amount
[01:24:29.986 --> 01:24:32.927]  Based on that deposit as a reserve.
[01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:48.873]  So, when you take this loan from a bank, and you go and you spend it into the economy, and other people deposit it into their banks, it also is multiplied by a factor of 10 because of the fractional reserve law by which the banks operate.
[01:24:49.613 --> 01:24:55.496]  This expands our money supply geometrically, and the more money we have in circulation, the less the money is worth.
[01:24:56.156 --> 01:24:59.237]  Now, the Federal Reserve looks at, excuse me, I'm so sorry,
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:14.713]  They look at statistics that are reported by the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, you know, everything from industrial production to housing statistics, consumer price index, consumer credit, the producer price index, and GDP.
[01:25:15.798 --> 01:25:22.944]  And they meet with the Federal Open Market Committee, and they decide at that point to whether or not they're going to raise or lower interest rates.
[01:25:23.305 --> 01:25:33.333]  And this is the second way in which money is created by the Federal Reserve System, by raising and lowering the discount rate, which is where banks go to borrow money to facilitate loans.
[01:25:33.473 --> 01:25:37.357]  In this way, they control how much your house is going to cost.
[01:25:37.817 --> 01:25:40.059]  They control whether or not you have a job tomorrow morning.
[01:25:40.159 --> 01:25:41.941]  And that gives this private group
[01:25:42.942 --> 01:25:59.102]  Because the Federal Reserve stock is held privately, total control, and at the same time, they're able to then give the banks they control this power to engage in fractional reserve banking, and then they are able to literally buy up the world
[01:25:59.502 --> 01:26:05.527]  And if you're not a banker, you're going to pay interest on money that is literally just zeros and ones in a computer.
[01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:09.150]  And then when you don't pay those debts, they then get to repossess your home.
[01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:10.971]  I mean, it's like all the credit cards.
[01:26:11.011 --> 01:26:12.773]  They say they're going to keep sending credit cards out.
[01:26:13.233 --> 01:26:16.015]  As soon as you're economically solvent, they stop sending you credit cards.
[01:26:16.035 --> 01:26:19.939]  But if you're a college student who's in debt, they just keep sending more and more.
[01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:23.061]  And now they're talking about types of debtor prisons in this country.
[01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.943]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:26:25.003 --> 01:26:26.204]  I mean, it's the biggest
[01:26:26.844 --> 01:26:29.945]  Scam that's ever been perpetrated upon mankind.
[01:26:30.265 --> 01:26:36.106]  I mean, you can make electronic bookkeeping entries in a computer and enslave the entire world.
[01:26:36.146 --> 01:26:39.407]  There's nothing tangible exchanging hands anymore.
[01:26:39.467 --> 01:26:48.029]  And the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, when Richard Nixon took us off the gold standard, allowed these international bankers to do this on an international scale.
[01:26:48.389 --> 01:26:51.070]  And the American taxpayer is the cosigner for much of this debt.
[01:26:51.770 --> 01:27:11.654]  You know, and it wreaks havoc around the world, and the Fed is actually pulling their hair out, trying to deal with the hot money or stateless capital that's generated as a result of many of these loans that are made to developing countries, and many of them have despotic leaders without any prudent regard for risk assessment.
[01:27:11.914 --> 01:27:13.275]  The money comes back to America.
[01:27:13.315 --> 01:27:15.375]  It's invested in our capital and financial markets.
[01:27:16.045 --> 01:27:23.311]  Uh, they're trying to be sheltered from runaway inflation in their own country, and when the money leaves our country, it wreaks havoc on our market.
[01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:31.397]  And this is a major problem for our central bank today, in dealing with the scope and the mania of stateless capital around the world.
[01:27:31.438 --> 01:27:33.079]  And I have a whole chapter in my book
[01:27:33.559 --> 01:27:35.060]  On stateless capital.
[01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:46.348]  But at the same time, the IMF and World Bank go to these thugs, openly tell them, don't pay this loan off, just sign over your people's resources to us, so they designed it that way.
[01:27:46.668 --> 01:27:47.489]  Absolutely 100%.
[01:27:47.609 --> 01:27:49.650]  You're hitting the nail dead on the head.
[01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:51.992]  Look, if it were not for the Cobalt
[01:27:52.792 --> 01:27:58.835]  The copper, the diamonds, and all the other minerals, particularly in West Africa, in the Congo right now.
[01:27:59.976 --> 01:28:03.577]  The Columbite Tamalite, which is also called Coltan.
[01:28:04.258 --> 01:28:11.481]  It's vital to the manufacture of cell phones, jet engines, airbags, night vision goggles, fiber optics, capacitors.
[01:28:11.761 --> 01:28:13.802]  You can't have computers without this stuff.
[01:28:14.642 --> 01:28:21.967]  But the globalists were able to go in, give loans to dictators for pennies on the dollar, what those countries actually have in wealth.
[01:28:22.187 --> 01:28:23.007]  And militarize them.
[01:28:23.267 --> 01:28:25.389]  And the people never see any of it.
[01:28:25.429 --> 01:28:26.049]  Stay with us.
[01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.689]  Absolutely.
[01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:29.731]  And it's the same scam here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:31.332]  It's all about control.
[01:28:32.033 --> 01:28:33.233]  It's not a free market.
[01:28:33.714 --> 01:28:37.276]  We'll break this down when we get back and talk about the new World Bank head.
[01:28:38.076 --> 01:28:40.818]  That's right, good old Wolfowitz.
[01:28:43.873 --> 01:28:46.883]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:50.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:59.630 --> 01:31:06.756]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:31:06.956 --> 01:31:12.341]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:31:12.582 --> 01:31:17.226]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[01:31:17.466 --> 01:31:20.007]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.348]  Either way, why chance it?

[01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:17.246]  We're going to have Andre Eglishan on with us throughout the balance of the broadcast the next hour and 26 minutes to be precise.
[01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.508]  Before we go back to Mr. Eglishan,
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.905]  I want to encourage each and every one of you that is joining us to get my new film.
[01:32:25.965 --> 01:32:30.030]  It's my best film, my most professionally produced, my most hard-hitting.
[01:32:30.991 --> 01:32:34.255]  It is Marshall Law, 911, Rise of the Police State.
[01:32:34.836 --> 01:32:38.901]  It's really three films in one, two hours, thirty-five minutes long.
[01:32:39.907 --> 01:32:49.129]  The first 35 minutes covers the hover blimps, the sound cannons, the police arresting innocent protesters and media and threatening to arrest us at the RNC.
[01:32:49.609 --> 01:32:51.749]  Then we spend an hour on 9-11.
[01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:54.170]  It's a 9-11 documentary in and of itself.
[01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:55.750]  I interview locals.
[01:32:55.830 --> 01:33:00.591]  I cover the Zogby Poll where half of New Yorkers think the government's behind 9-11.
[01:33:01.251 --> 01:33:03.892]  I cover how 9-11 was carried out by the globalists.
[01:33:04.672 --> 01:33:08.913]  Then for the third hour we show you what makes them tick, their ideology, their philosophy.
[01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:17.552]  We show how Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove are Germanic death cult offshoots of the Order of Death.
[01:33:17.572 --> 01:33:20.896]  Well, the Order of the Death said that the Nazis grew out of.
[01:33:20.996 --> 01:33:23.459]  We then explore Arnold A. Lowe Schwarzenegger.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.522]  We then explore the Bushes and the Nazis.
[01:33:26.582 --> 01:33:27.684]  And it ends with Bush
[01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:35.597]  Giving his inaugural speech, just swearing in, and we show for the last ten minutes how they're destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:33:36.037 --> 01:33:38.459]  Three films in one, $25.95.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:43.904]  I want every single solitary one of you out there to stop procrastinating.
[01:33:44.955 --> 01:34:00.775]  And to get this video or the other great videos I carry or I produce, and the book I've written, the book I carry, the book I've published, Paul Watson's book, all the materials, the books on tape, you name it, at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:34:08.213 --> 01:34:10.854]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, it's 2595.
[01:34:11.255 --> 01:34:11.895]  Three films in one.
[01:34:11.915 --> 01:34:14.977]  Write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:34:32.412 --> 01:34:34.341]  And last but not least, you can also write to me...
[01:34:35.915 --> 01:35:02.877]  Again, as I just said, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704, or order via the safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com, or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, read my book, read Paul Watson's book, watch my weekly TV show, hear my best audio interviews, watch all my films, dozens of other great films, we've been authorized to post.
[01:35:03.437 --> 01:35:06.659]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:10.821]  And that cost that we charge just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:11.881]  Barely does.
[01:35:12.982 --> 01:35:19.785]  And then, at the same time, I hope that you get Andre's book, Thieves in the Temple.
[01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:23.246]  Thieves in the Temple, America under the Federal Reserve System.
[01:35:23.667 --> 01:35:25.407]  It is getting rave reviews.
[01:35:25.848 --> 01:35:27.348]  It is selling quite nicely.
[01:35:27.969 --> 01:35:30.730]  And, by the way, the network has it at cost.
[01:35:31.534 --> 01:35:33.695]  And the network has chosen to sell this book.
[01:35:33.715 --> 01:35:36.476]  You know, I have guests on every day that we don't sell their materials.
[01:35:36.596 --> 01:35:37.297]  I'm not selling it.
[01:35:37.317 --> 01:35:44.159]  I should sell it, but I encourage the network to sell it because it is so important.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.101]  So you support the network and what Andre is doing.
[01:35:47.501 --> 01:35:49.242]  Give him a call at 800-686-2237 and tell him that you want
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.262]  The book Thieves in the Temple for $14.95.
[01:35:58.843 --> 01:36:00.644]  It's a big book.
[01:36:00.664 --> 01:36:02.766]  800-686-2237.

[01:36:14.187 --> 01:36:15.909]  So you get a great book that will inform you.
[01:36:15.949 --> 01:36:17.370]  You'll be an expert on the Federal Reserve.
[01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:20.293]  You can then give it as a gift after you've read it and inform others.
[01:36:20.754 --> 01:36:23.737]  You'll also support the network and our satellites and everything we do.
[01:36:24.297 --> 01:36:27.961]  And you'll support Andre Eglishan who's doing just a fabulous job.
[01:36:28.001 --> 01:36:28.501]  So again, 800-686-2237.
[01:36:32.791 --> 01:36:43.384]  Or, go to GCNlive.com, click through to the GCN store, and you'll notice most of the stuff there is about the Federal Reserve because it's so important to expose this.
[01:36:43.684 --> 01:36:51.493]  This is the foundation and the power base, the blood supply, and the brain of the New World Order in this country.
[01:36:52.481 --> 01:36:53.402]  So please take action.
[01:36:53.742 --> 01:37:03.107]  Andre, getting into what they do in third world countries and what they're preparing to now do here in America, how this scam works, tell us all about it.
[01:37:03.508 --> 01:37:16.895]  Well, basically the way it works is that these countries have now become addicted to fiat money, or money that's totally unbacked by gold, silver, or any other commodity that has intrinsic value.
[01:37:18.276 --> 01:37:19.257]  These countries are
[01:37:19.921 --> 01:37:38.429]  Signing on to the World Bank and the IMF's initiatives because they don't have the infrastructure in their country to build an established business dynamic there, and the people aren't making enough money to support commercial businesses in their own countries.
[01:37:38.509 --> 01:37:42.911]  Therefore, they're living on credit cards, just like the average American is today.
[01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:45.352]  They're living on borrowed money from the West.
[01:37:45.953 --> 01:37:51.661]  And the Federal Reserve System and the World Bank can create as much of this money as they want out of nothing at all.
[01:37:51.761 --> 01:38:01.856]  And that's why it's particularly interesting that Paul Wolfowitz, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense, is now being nominated as President of the World Bank.
[01:38:02.404 --> 01:38:09.106]  Alex, what I'm seeing is a rapid re-centralization of power in this country under the neoconservative ideology.
[01:38:09.607 --> 01:38:17.669]  You're also going to have this guy, Faith, is going to leave as Undersecretary of the Defense Department Policy.
[01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:21.251]  She's going to leave a hole there in the Department of Defense.
[01:38:21.431 --> 01:38:23.091]  Now you have Condoleezza Rice there.
[01:38:23.451 --> 01:38:30.194]  We've already seen what her attitude is towards the world and that she's thumbing her nose at everyone that has a confrontation with the United States.
[01:38:30.234 --> 01:38:31.054]  She's cancelled trips.
[01:38:31.555 --> 01:38:37.807]  To Canada, and to Egypt, and everywhere else wherein they don't greet them with a red carpet.
[01:38:38.485 --> 01:38:50.810]  And consequently, what we're going to see is a coalescing of these three organizations, the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the World Bank, all doing the bidding of neocons out of the Bush White House.
[01:38:50.850 --> 01:39:05.716]  Well, Marine Corps Brigadier General Smedley Butler, who they tried to hire for a coup d'etat to set up a fascist dictatorship along the lines of the merge with Hitler, he'd been all over the world, and he said back then, if they don't let our banks take control, we invade.
[01:39:06.534 --> 01:39:07.014]  Absolutely.
[01:39:07.034 --> 01:39:12.896]  And he was talking about Latin America and Africa and Asia and predominantly in the Pacific.
[01:39:13.016 --> 01:39:15.696]  Or we'll implement a low-intensity coup d'etat.
[01:39:15.896 --> 01:39:18.477]  Either way it goes, the leader will not be allowed to stand.
[01:39:18.497 --> 01:39:22.158]  The policy will shift from one of engagement to one of confrontation.
[01:39:22.238 --> 01:39:29.700]  And to be clear, America is used by the parasites that have hijacked the central nervous system of the executive branch of the government
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.923]  To go out and be the bully or the big doppelganger to take over.
[01:39:35.263 --> 01:39:36.304]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:39:36.384 --> 01:39:38.045]  And it's happening all over the world.
[01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.086]  It has been for quite some time.
[01:39:40.806 --> 01:39:46.569]  It is the prime reason why we saw the Latin American debt crisis in the 80s.
[01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:49.351]  It's the prime reason why we saw the Asian financial crisis in the 90s.
[01:39:49.411 --> 01:39:52.553]  And it's the prime reason we're seeing a financial crisis today.
[01:39:52.973 --> 01:40:17.560]  I mean, never before have we had such a luxurious recession in America, because if they included the housing figures and the equity bubble in their assessments of the inflation index, if the Federal Reserve included those figures like they properly should, then inflation would be double digits in America today.
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.701]  I want to stop right there.
[01:40:19.221 --> 01:40:20.761]  I want to stop right there, because this is key.
[01:40:21.502 --> 01:40:22.462]  Here's another example.
[01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:25.384]  They say we've got all these people off unemployment.
[01:40:25.444 --> 01:40:25.664]  No.
[01:40:25.984 --> 01:40:32.366]  When someone runs out of unemployment and doesn't get a job, they go off the unemployment rolls and that number's not used.
[01:40:32.486 --> 01:40:33.006]  That's right.
[01:40:33.046 --> 01:40:46.151]  They also use people working two jobs, so they look at 287 million people in the 2000 Census and say, well... And then they count all these millions of people that have two, three jobs as separate people having jobs.
[01:40:46.511 --> 01:40:47.791]  That's another scam they pull.
[01:40:47.811 --> 01:40:49.092]  But to understand this, folks,
[01:40:49.989 --> 01:40:53.213]  What Andre is saying is fact.
[01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:56.817]  It's the simple base numbers of what we're dealing with.
[01:40:56.877 --> 01:40:59.540]  I mean, Austin was the number one city in the U.S.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:06.609]  with the fastest growing economy until early 2001 when they popped the bubble right before 9-11 and used it as a smoke screen.
[01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:12.692]  Now, almost everybody I know has lost their high-tech job or taken a 70% cut.
[01:41:13.112 --> 01:41:16.114]  People are all having to sell their houses or get another mortgage.
[01:41:16.414 --> 01:41:17.794]  Now that money is running out.
[01:41:18.235 --> 01:41:20.556]  Private debt, corporate debt, government debt.
[01:41:21.056 --> 01:41:24.418]  The average American is spending like $1.20 for every dollar they bring in.
[01:41:24.938 --> 01:41:26.779]  The economy is in shambles.
[01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:29.861]  Gas prices are going above $2 a gallon.
[01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:34.944]  Real inflationary trends are off the Richter scale.
[01:41:35.144 --> 01:41:41.367]  But meanwhile, you watch the nightly news, they're telling you how great the economy is, so you feel like you're alone.
[01:41:41.687 --> 01:41:43.709]  You feel like you're a loser.
[01:41:43.929 --> 01:41:45.610]  Everybody else must be doing great.
[01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:47.511]  It's total smoke and mirrors.
[01:41:47.711 --> 01:41:48.952]  You got that right, Alex.
[01:41:49.072 --> 01:41:54.655]  And it's all because they refuse to index in the precipitous rise in home values.
[01:41:55.295 --> 01:42:00.276]  Over the last four years, as well as this huge, huge equity bubble we have out there.
[01:42:00.556 --> 01:42:19.061]  The only thing Alan Greenspan has done since his irrational, exuberant speech when he told us we're acquiring too much debt, and then just two or three weeks ago in his address to the House Budget Committee when he talked again about the impending problem of our deficits, the only thing he did was not pay attention to his own advice
[01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:20.062]  We're good to go.
[01:42:39.899 --> 01:42:48.547]  So high that it is a deficit reduction tool, and it's another mechanism to transfer the wealth of the American people into the coffers of these banks and these corporations.
[01:42:48.587 --> 01:42:51.429]  The more these houses are worth, the more they're going to tax you on it.
[01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:57.534]  The more taxes they collect, the more they can fund their schemes of tax cuts for the rich in this war in Iraq.
[01:42:57.795 --> 01:43:01.518]  And for those who don't understand this, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:43:02.139 --> 01:43:12.965]  You need to understand that when the bubble busts, which they designed these to do, then they're going to call in all those notes and you're going to see something that makes the Great Depression look like a new part of it.
[01:43:12.985 --> 01:43:17.707]  You're going to see a wave of foreclosures in this country unlike anything we've ever seen before.
[01:43:18.147 --> 01:43:27.574]  You know, the prudent advice would be to buy some land in the country somewhere, because the cities are going to become so gangstrified, you will not be able to live in them.
[01:43:27.614 --> 01:43:29.055]  They're going to be totally uninhabitable.
[01:43:29.355 --> 01:43:32.157]  And we have a clear case to take and look at.
[01:43:32.197 --> 01:43:35.199]  We have a precedent that's already been set here in our own backyard.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:41.504]  If you look at the island of Jamaica, it has only 2.3 million people, but they've got the fifth highest murder rate on the face of the earth.
[01:43:41.804 --> 01:43:42.084]  Why?
[01:43:42.425 --> 01:44:01.339]  Partly because after 9-11, much of the resources that were used to interdict drugs and to deal with the money laundering and all of the aspects of drug proliferation, as the Caribbean is one major hub for drug distribution in our hemisphere, it was all reallocated back to America for so-called national security purposes and for defending us in the war on 9-11.
[01:44:01.379 --> 01:44:02.260]  What had happened was,
[01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:04.061]  Absolutely.
[01:44:04.081 --> 01:44:04.361]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:22.232 --> 01:44:25.595]  Literally, it's all gone, and we got the World Bank documents.
[01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:27.377]  Joseph Stiglitz quit, and they were released.
[01:44:27.717 --> 01:44:28.838]  Chief Economist, World Bank.
[01:44:28.938 --> 01:44:33.722]  It was all engineered to destroy their economy, and they played ball!
[01:44:34.002 --> 01:44:34.503]  Absolutely.
[01:44:34.543 --> 01:44:40.007]  The peso is toast down there right now, and the people just don't know what to ask for.
[01:44:40.067 --> 01:44:45.972]  And that's why I wrote my book, Things in the Temple, to give the American people some reference as to what's happening to them.
[01:44:46.473 --> 01:44:50.016]  We don't have a healthy perspective on our economy today, because they shroud
[01:44:50.456 --> 01:44:53.399]  Let me throw this in and then we're going to go to some calls.
[01:44:53.439 --> 01:44:56.481]  We're going to have Andre with us for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:44:56.802 --> 01:44:57.822]  Wonderful information.
[01:44:57.843 --> 01:44:59.384]  We're right on target, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:59.404 --> 01:44:59.804]  Here's an example.
[01:45:18.772 --> 01:45:27.152]  Until 1959, in major polls, 95% of Americans, I was just researching this in more detail last night,
[01:45:28.783 --> 01:45:32.305]  95% of Americans did not believe that organized crime existed.
[01:45:32.805 --> 01:45:36.988]  They did not believe that Lacoste and Nostra existed because J. Edgar Hoover told them it didn't.
[01:45:37.569 --> 01:45:44.853]  Until in a farmhouse up back east, a local state police went ahead and busted them because the FBI wouldn't put a stop to it.
[01:45:44.874 --> 01:45:49.877]  Now that was one small, the Italian Mob was one small part of the bigger puzzle, but the point is
[01:45:50.999 --> 01:46:00.083]  People didn't even know something existed that was huge for decades and decades just because the Mafia spent so much time and money paying off the media.
[01:46:00.544 --> 01:46:02.084]  It's the same thing with the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:02.144 --> 01:46:03.205]  It's totally public.
[01:46:03.485 --> 01:46:08.347]  It's operating in plain view, but because they own and control the media, nobody talks about it.
[01:46:08.668 --> 01:46:09.948]  They are right out in the open.
[01:46:09.988 --> 01:46:11.429]  They are organized crime.
[01:46:12.369 --> 01:46:19.553]  These are the families that are hell-bent on bringing in a new world order, and it's time for us to force an awakening
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:28.154]  To the real mafia, the banking cartels.
[01:46:28.174 --> 01:46:29.055]  You're absolutely right.
[01:46:30.338 --> 01:46:31.560]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:38.083]  Well, before we do that, Andre, just put a quick plug in for your book that, by the way, Genesis is carrying.
[01:46:38.363 --> 01:46:46.709]  Okay, Genesis is carrying the book so you guys can get in contact with Alex Jones' network and you can purchase a copy of the book there and he'll give you the number.
[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:49.671]  The book is doing fantastic.
[01:46:49.691 --> 01:46:52.193]  We went to number 38 on Amazon.com.
[01:46:52.573 --> 01:47:00.599]  The book is called Thieves in the Temple, America Under the Federal Reserve System and it is exposing the anatomy and physiology
[01:47:01.239 --> 01:47:02.040]  We're good to go.
[01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:26.889]  Not for me to make money.
[01:47:26.909 --> 01:47:28.151]  That's not what this is about.
[01:47:28.211 --> 01:47:30.134]  This is about waking up this country.
[01:47:30.154 --> 01:47:34.300]  Well, Andre, I hope you make money so you can fight it on a larger scale.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.823]  Oh, I've got another book in the wings.
[01:47:36.003 --> 01:47:37.666]  Well, we've all got to fund what we're doing.
[01:47:37.706 --> 01:47:38.827]  I mean, the globalists have the money.
[01:47:38.847 --> 01:47:39.689]  That's why they're winning.
[01:47:39.889 --> 01:47:40.269]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:40.409 --> 01:47:44.753]  It's the same price as it is on Amazon.
[01:47:44.773 --> 01:47:50.558]  800-686-2237 or GCNlive.com.
[01:47:51.039 --> 01:47:54.262]  Let's go ahead and go to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[01:47:54.322 --> 01:47:55.303]  Margaret, you're on the air.
[01:47:55.343 --> 01:47:55.683]  Welcome.
[01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:56.864]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:56.884 --> 01:48:01.308]  I just want to thank you for all the hard work you do on this stuff.
[01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:06.893]  It's really scary about this backhoe business, but I have a little encouragement, if I may.
[01:48:07.492 --> 01:48:11.902]  Back in the days of Noah, God said that there's nothing that they won't get into.
[01:48:12.343 --> 01:48:13.426]  So he sent a flood.
[01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:15.089]  Now in our day today...
[01:48:16.002 --> 01:48:17.803]  Our hope is in a sentence in Matthew 24.
[01:48:18.203 --> 01:48:20.144]  Ma'am, are you on a cordless telephone?
[01:48:20.664 --> 01:48:20.884]  No.
[01:48:21.304 --> 01:48:21.585]  Okay.
[01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:22.105]  You're not here?
[01:48:22.125 --> 01:48:24.046]  Yeah, your phone's real bad, but go ahead.
[01:48:24.166 --> 01:48:24.406]  I know.
[01:48:25.346 --> 01:48:30.188]  Anyway, today we have a good sentence in Matthew 24 in verse 22.
[01:48:30.308 --> 01:48:37.212]  It says, and it's speaking of our time, Jesus said, except those days be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.
[01:48:37.572 --> 01:48:40.653]  But for the elect's sake, those days shall be shortened.
[01:48:41.093 --> 01:48:44.515]  Our Savior is not going to let us be consumed by a black hole.
[01:48:45.183 --> 01:48:46.584]  I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[01:48:46.624 --> 01:48:47.485]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:47.885 --> 01:49:00.116]  Andre, if you just joined us earlier and missed the first hour, BBC, Lab, Fireball, maybe Black Hole, and they're doing these super colliders, superconducting
[01:49:01.013 --> 01:49:02.093]  No, it doesn't.
[01:49:02.113 --> 01:49:05.194]  I mean, you know, we experiment in things that we don't fully understand.
[01:49:24.839 --> 01:49:38.751]  And I am a proponent of the model of the Earth's geological history known as Catastrophism, rather than Uniformitarianism, and that is that changes in our Earth happen very quickly over very short periods of time.
[01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:44.796]  We go through these various cataclysms, and they're playing around with something that could bring about another cataclysm.
[01:49:45.297 --> 01:49:51.943]  Our Department of Defense has experimented with the electromagnetic, with trying to weaponize everything... Stand there, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:55.193]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.393 --> 01:49:58.476]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.616 --> 01:50:02.518]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.578 --> 01:50:06.802]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:10.924]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.065 --> 01:50:12.866]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.066 --> 01:50:16.369]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:21.113]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.273 --> 01:50:24.336]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.496 --> 01:50:27.378]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.859 --> 01:50:33.964]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.504 --> 01:50:38.285]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:55.952]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.252 --> 01:51:01.176]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.436 --> 01:51:05.799]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.079 --> 01:51:15.005]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.205 --> 01:51:18.828]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.108 --> 01:51:24.150]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:31.173]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.654 --> 01:51:32.194]  What about you?
[01:51:32.953 --> 01:51:37.855]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:53:02.268 --> 01:53:03.972]  Talking to Andre Eglishan.
[01:53:05.134 --> 01:53:06.737]  Written the book Thieves in the Temple.
[01:53:07.398 --> 01:53:08.641]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[01:53:08.661 --> 01:53:09.402]  I want to cover 9-11.
[01:53:09.543 --> 01:53:13.190]  Get his take on that and where he thinks things are going in the future.
[01:53:15.177 --> 01:53:20.618]  The globalists create order out of chaos, and they're power mad up in their ivory towers.
[01:53:20.638 --> 01:53:28.741]  And Andre, you were bringing up electromagnetic weapons, seismic weapons, that Secretary of Defense Cohen talked about in a press conference back in 1997.
[01:53:29.121 --> 01:53:33.562]  They admit in mainstream publications that the Pentagon's developed anti-matter weapons.
[01:53:34.362 --> 01:53:37.483]  Now they're coming out today and admitting that they've developed space planes.
[01:53:37.883 --> 01:53:42.084]  Things are a lot more advanced than they let the public know, aren't they?
[01:53:42.344 --> 01:53:42.845]  Absolutely.
[01:53:42.885 --> 01:53:46.628]  Information is disseminated to the public in a very skewed way.
[01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:53.115]  In everything from advances in military technology to the health status of our economy.
[01:53:53.215 --> 01:53:58.120]  I mean, they only tell us a partial version of the story.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.482]  They don't tell us the complete thing.
[01:53:59.642 --> 01:54:03.125]  They want to keep us dumbed down and ignorant so they can continue to manipulate us.
[01:54:03.185 --> 01:54:04.327]  But thanks to people like you,
[01:54:05.047 --> 01:54:17.394]  You know, out here on the radio, telling the people what the social architects of our society don't want us to know, and what the monetary scientists and their poodles in government don't want us to know, the American people do stand a chance.
[01:54:18.914 --> 01:54:23.317]  Yeah, the globalists are very good at creating crises and then posing as our saviors.
[01:54:23.337 --> 01:54:28.119]  The number one thing I try to do is explain to people that they're engineering the crises.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.662]  Every time we track it back, it's the globalists' handiwork and their fingerprints.
[01:54:31.682 --> 01:54:32.762]  It's all in the Galilean dialect.
[01:54:32.802 --> 01:54:38.886]  I mean, you create a problem, you offer a solution to the problem, that's going to engender the desired result that you want in the first time.
[01:54:39.266 --> 01:54:42.428]  I mean, it's been going on for a long, long time.
[01:54:42.588 --> 01:54:49.690]  What I try to do, though, is point that out to people so that they realize that running to the people that did it in the first place isn't going to help them.
[01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:51.190]  That is exactly right.
[01:54:51.250 --> 01:54:54.351]  We, the people, must arm ourselves with information and with knowledge.
[01:54:54.751 --> 01:54:55.892]  It's the great equalizer.
[01:54:55.952 --> 01:55:07.615]  And I do believe, and it's based upon the history of our country and our experiments with privately owned central banks, that every time these banks have put America into dire straits from an economic perspective, the people have risen up
[01:55:08.095 --> 01:55:08.316]  I think?
[01:55:23.198 --> 01:55:24.399]  They've written about this topic.
[01:55:24.539 --> 01:55:27.321]  Hopefully, the American people are starting to get some kind of a reference.
[01:55:27.361 --> 01:55:32.004]  Well, Ron Paul has introduced bills of a way to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:32.204 --> 01:55:32.625]  Absolutely.
[01:55:32.645 --> 01:55:34.005]  And it'd be very good for the economy.
[01:55:34.065 --> 01:55:38.088]  Let's talk to Robert in Denver, the James Art Dean and others.
[01:55:38.168 --> 01:55:38.929]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:55:39.409 --> 01:55:40.130]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:41.030]  Thanks so much for taking my call.
[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:42.191]  I appreciate it.
[01:55:42.211 --> 01:55:48.035]  John, I had never heard of you until about two or three weeks ago when you were on Postco George Neary.
[01:55:48.395 --> 01:55:49.156]  Then I heard you on
[01:55:50.453 --> 01:55:51.753]  Radio Liberty with Dr. Monteith.
[01:55:51.813 --> 01:55:59.416]  I must say you have an absolute, obscene and incredible depth and breadth of knowledge of the Federal Reserve and the money system and how it all works.
[01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:02.476]  And I plan on getting a copy of your book, Seize the Temple.
[01:56:02.556 --> 01:56:03.777]  I tip my hat to you, Andre.
[01:56:03.817 --> 01:56:04.357]  You're incredible.
[01:56:04.737 --> 01:56:05.157]  Thank you.
[01:56:05.197 --> 01:56:05.757]  Quick question.
[01:56:07.378 --> 01:56:15.120]  Michael Trudeau, who is with Colonial Assets up in Minnesota, predicts that one day in the not-too-distant future there will be a banking emergency like in the 30s.
[01:56:15.993 --> 01:56:16.494]  Well, let me say this.
[01:56:16.514 --> 01:56:17.414]  Yeah, let me say what they're doing.
[01:56:17.454 --> 01:56:20.537]  Instead, they're already implementing the National ID Card through the driver's license.
[01:56:34.731 --> 01:56:36.232]  So I think it's going to be the opposite of that.
[01:56:36.292 --> 01:56:38.293]  We're already going to have the smart card.
[01:56:38.533 --> 01:56:42.536]  We're already going to be using it more and more through a national sales tax.
[01:56:42.916 --> 01:56:47.959]  Then they'll bring in the crisis and shift everything over to a totally digital system.
[01:56:48.079 --> 01:56:48.379]  Andre?
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:51.521]  I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[01:56:51.541 --> 01:56:58.185]  The New World Order is not anything that's going to be able to be identified by all of a sudden one day with the appearing.
[01:56:58.245 --> 01:56:59.866]  No, it's creeping on us gradually.
[01:56:59.926 --> 01:57:00.727]  We're in it now.
[01:57:01.533 --> 01:57:03.094]  And we have been for quite some time.
[01:57:04.594 --> 01:57:09.096]  They are operating according to the creed of Fabian Socialism, which is gradualism.
[01:57:09.216 --> 01:57:15.578]  Only the Bush administration now is accelerating many of these long sought after goals by globalists and the elites.
[01:57:15.638 --> 01:57:20.120]  And that's because they're behind schedule and Bush is just simply following his orders.
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:21.020]  Absolutely.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.461]  He is a speech maker and nothing more.
[01:57:23.781 --> 01:57:25.862]  Alright, thank you for the call Robert.
[01:57:25.882 --> 01:57:27.783]  When we start the third hour we'll go to James.
[01:57:28.753 --> 01:57:35.295]  Art, Dean, and many others, toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:35.315 --> 01:57:41.597]  Coming up, we'll explore 9-11, and, uh, well, World War IV, as the Pentagon's calling it.
[01:57:43.778 --> 01:57:44.378]  Hello, folks!
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:50.760]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.560]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.201 --> 01:57:54.281]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.941 --> 01:57:55.841]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.542 --> 01:57:57.302]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.087 --> 01:58:01.730]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:06.413]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.473 --> 01:58:25.045]  Alright, we're talking to talk show host and also author of a book that's a best seller now, Thieves in the Temple, America Under the Federal Reserve System, Andre Eglishan.
[01:58:26.545 --> 01:58:28.046]  And we're going to be taking your calls.
[01:58:28.866 --> 01:58:33.448]  Andre, before we go back to the calls, I wanted to talk about several separate issues.
[01:58:34.649 --> 01:58:37.750]  China and Russia are doing joint war games right now.
[01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:43.093]  An official Russian news agency says for drills to, quote, invade Taiwan.
[01:58:43.773 --> 01:58:45.094]  Bush says, hey, go ahead.
[01:58:45.614 --> 01:58:48.255]  Won't even invite Taiwan to his swearing-in ceremony.
[01:58:48.295 --> 01:58:49.436]  Every other country was invited.
[01:58:50.874 --> 01:59:00.486]  At the very same time, we have our government helping to arm all these different countries, like North Korea and Pakistan, but they want to invade the Middle East, saying that they're a threat.
[01:59:01.207 --> 01:59:01.928]  Your take on that?
[01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:03.950]  Well, I can tell you this.
[01:59:04.050 --> 01:59:11.896]  It's impossible to understand the organization of our foreign policy in the 21st century without taking into account this meteoric rise of China.
[01:59:12.396 --> 01:59:17.860]  Their ascension to the World Trade Organization was called the biggest coming-out party in the history of capitalism.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:23.844]  As a matter of fact, Goldman Sachs has said that in 40 years, China's economy is going to overtake the economy of the United States.
[01:59:23.884 --> 01:59:30.989]  And in 10 years, they're going to be able to overtake the world's capacity to be able to produce base metals, food, even luxury goods.
[01:59:31.489 --> 01:59:43.372]  Right now, China's consuming about 40% of the world's cement, 31% of the coal, 25% of the aluminum, about 30% of the iron ore, 27% of all the steel produced in the world, and about 70% of the world's crude.
[01:59:44.032 --> 01:59:54.035]  Now, this is a problem, because our corporations and these banks who seek to increase their fees on transnational mergers and acquisitions, particularly as it pertains to China,
[01:59:54.555 --> 02:00:01.342]  You know, how can we continue to exploit the industrialization of China without committing suicide?
[02:00:01.382 --> 02:00:05.606]  Because they're in direct competition with the West for these resources.
[02:00:05.626 --> 02:00:09.029]  The average American isn't going to have money to buy anything from the Chinese.
[02:00:09.210 --> 02:00:09.910]  Absolutely.
[02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:15.696]  I mean, you know, sooner or later, just like you pointed out, I mean, living on these credit cards, living on the equity in our homes, it's going to run out.
[02:00:16.204 --> 02:00:16.704]  I think so.
[02:00:33.395 --> 02:00:37.696]  We are looking at a global meltdown very, very shortly.
[02:00:38.017 --> 02:00:41.458]  So the American people had better take evasive maneuvers.
[02:00:41.478 --> 02:00:50.360]  We'd better position ourselves, because 2004 was an impactful year, but 2005 promises to be a very decisive year in world economics.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.701]  We'd better position ourselves for the coming adjustments.
[02:00:54.469 --> 02:00:59.330]  Meanwhile, we see a police state being set up here in America long before 9-11.
[02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:10.252]  They were erecting it, and the question is, if we've put up with all this tyranny up until now, and we haven't been violent against it, why is the government setting up the riot police, the emergency camps?
[02:01:10.712 --> 02:01:15.993]  What is it they've got planned that's so horrible that they know people are going to riot en masse?
[02:01:16.713 --> 02:01:21.194]  One more event like 9-11 would be too much for this country to handle.
[02:01:21.934 --> 02:01:36.397]  Besides that, if you've read the report for Mayan Mountain, which was issued back in the 1960s, you know that they have plans that have been long in place to deal with a population, a disaffected population during peacetime and during wartime.
[02:01:36.797 --> 02:01:48.079]  And one of the solutions, along with the re-institution of slavery, which would be in some form consistent with the modern political process, would be these mass internment camps
[02:01:49.029 --> 02:02:16.410]  uh... and mass incarcerations of people suspension of the constitution uh... suspension of the will of congress and the american people and all of this uh... has been uh... provided to the president because of the national security act of nineteen forty seven and in a month ago congress passed the doomsday bill giving up their authority to the executive absolutely absolutely i mean you know it all but like i said when we created the national security act in nineteen forty seven what began at that particular time what
[02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:24.775]  As a civilian advisory committee to the president has now become the command post for covert black operations to be backdoored out of the White House.
[02:02:24.835 --> 02:02:27.997]  And they're not even backdooring them anymore, they're doing it right in front of our faces.
[02:02:28.057 --> 02:02:32.639]  Alberto Gonzalez has said the executive makes all the laws now and runs everything.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.361]  Diametrically opposed to a free society.
[02:02:35.821 --> 02:02:40.324]  And they're behind the terrorism, giving you the crisis so they can offer you the solution.
[02:02:40.724 --> 02:02:41.605]  Total slavery.
[02:02:41.965 --> 02:02:43.566]  Your calls and more news straight ahead.
[02:02:45.569 --> 02:02:49.911]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.091 --> 02:02:54.513]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.653 --> 02:02:59.035]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.075 --> 02:03:00.436]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.196 --> 02:03:01.957]  Panama.
[02:03:02.217 --> 02:03:06.462]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.502 --> 02:03:13.450]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:15.573]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.953 --> 02:03:26.376]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.576 --> 02:03:31.917]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:45.161 --> 02:03:53.790]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:54.010 --> 02:04:05.302]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.502 --> 02:04:08.145]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.485 --> 02:04:14.949]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:16.990]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.171 --> 02:04:23.194]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.434 --> 02:04:29.118]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:04:45.106 --> 02:04:50.631]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[02:04:50.831 --> 02:04:58.397]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[02:04:58.497 --> 02:05:05.103]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[02:05:05.303 --> 02:05:06.684]  Now it's available to you.
[02:05:06.844 --> 02:05:13.370]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:17.932]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[02:05:18.212 --> 02:05:24.475]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[02:05:24.615 --> 02:05:28.677]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[02:05:45.464 --> 02:05:50.506]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.886 --> 02:05:53.207]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:00.190 --> 02:06:02.131]  We're talking to Andre Eglishan.
[02:06:03.031 --> 02:06:04.052]  We're taking your calls.
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:11.824]  The last segment we talked about a global pandemic financial meltdown, which again we have the IMF and World Bank documents.
[02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:13.965]  They do this by design.
[02:06:13.985 --> 02:06:25.111]  We always knew this with the Great Depression, which again most major economists admit was engineered now, back in the 1929 that went on for roughly 10 years.
[02:06:26.091 --> 02:06:27.532]  It's all about consolidation.
[02:06:27.572 --> 02:06:28.693]  It's not free market.
[02:06:28.773 --> 02:06:30.634]  I use the term mercantilism.
[02:06:31.616 --> 02:06:47.317]  We talked about this yesterday, where a tiny elite, through government power, controls how the economy is set up, and they design it to create a larger serf or slave mass, while liquidating the middle class.
[02:06:48.556 --> 02:07:02.322]  Talking about the national draft, I have an article here from today from the Associated Press where they're talking about how the Army is having to change its assessments.
[02:07:02.662 --> 02:07:08.725]  What they'll do is every year they can't get their recruits in the Army, the Navy, even the Marine Corps.
[02:07:09.885 --> 02:07:13.967]  The only group that can get their recruits now is the Air Force because they don't see a lot of frontline combat.
[02:07:15.468 --> 02:07:17.689]  And so they get permission to then lower
[02:07:18.730 --> 02:07:22.812]  The Pentagon told the White House they needed 400,000 to 500,000 troops to take Iraq and hold Iraq.
[02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:39.131]  There's about 150,000 there right now.
[02:07:39.691 --> 02:07:42.332]  Only about 50,000 of those are actually combat troops.
[02:07:42.372 --> 02:07:43.612]  The place is falling apart.
[02:07:43.972 --> 02:07:45.693]  It's basically an open civil war.
[02:07:46.213 --> 02:07:49.434]  We passed months ago at the 1500 mark.
[02:07:49.494 --> 02:07:56.377]  They don't count you as a troop that died in theater, even if you died on the helicopter flying you out of the DMZ.
[02:07:57.677 --> 02:08:00.378]  So, they're also cooking those numbers.
[02:08:01.141 --> 02:08:04.423]  And Andre, they've got a bunch of bills introduced for a national draft.
[02:08:04.704 --> 02:08:06.105]  The Pentagon has said they need it.
[02:08:06.365 --> 02:08:08.326]  They've set up the draft boards again.
[02:08:08.626 --> 02:08:11.368]  The Selective Service had its funds doubled last year.
[02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:14.531]  They're running ads telling everybody to sign up, even women.
[02:08:16.172 --> 02:08:21.976]  I see them engineering the draft, but calling it national service, after the next big terrorist attack, Andre.
[02:08:23.161 --> 02:08:23.702]  Wholeheartedly.
[02:08:23.742 --> 02:08:30.987]  I mean, there's no way the United States can continue to advance its foreign policy goals without instituting a draft at some point.
[02:08:31.267 --> 02:08:41.355]  You know, this all goes back to the Roosevelt Doctrine, when Roosevelt basically decided, you know, most people have forgotten, we were the number one exporter of oil during World War II.
[02:08:41.415 --> 02:08:44.137]  As a matter of fact, we sold Adolf Hitler most of his gas and oil.
[02:08:45.737 --> 02:08:52.859]  Roosevelt decided, look, we're going to run out of our oil first, so let's go ahead and find a surrogate oil-producing country and use them.
[02:08:52.959 --> 02:08:55.019]  So, up comes the House of Saud.
[02:08:55.479 --> 02:08:57.520]  We create this alliance with them.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:03.361]  Then the Eisenhower Doctrine comes along, which says that we're going to use military force in order to defend us.
[02:09:03.441 --> 02:09:12.323]  And that doctrine pretty much was fortified in the administration of Jimmy Carter when he said, let me make myself perfectly clear, any outside force
[02:09:12.723 --> 02:09:13.103]  We're good to go.
[02:09:35.413 --> 02:09:36.614]  It's the new colonialism.
[02:09:36.895 --> 02:09:37.395]  Absolutely.
[02:09:37.455 --> 02:09:42.900]  I mean, we're pumping tons of money into the Colombian government in their fight against the leftist guerrillas.
[02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:47.104]  You have Chavez down in Venezuela saying that, look, the United States wants to kill me.
[02:09:47.484 --> 02:09:55.812]  You've got all of these leading industrialized nations implementing very deceptive diplomatic policies in these areas that are already highly destabilized.
[02:09:57.213 --> 02:10:03.098]  If a spark goes off around this powder keg, we're in World War III for real, okay?
[02:10:03.138 --> 02:10:11.384]  And then they're going to have to institute a draft, because, I mean, you can't pull enough troops out of Europe and reallocate them to these various theaters to be able to carry out this campaign.
[02:10:11.624 --> 02:10:19.891]  And the Chinese have already said, I mean, the People's Liberation Army of China, and their leader, Kuo Lan, already said that there's going to be a war over these resources, and we intend to win it.
[02:10:20.391 --> 02:10:22.254]  Now, we have militarized China.
[02:10:23.295 --> 02:10:26.399]  They have put a lot of ordinances along the borders of Taiwan.
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:29.243]  The world right now, Alex, is a powder keg.
[02:10:29.263 --> 02:10:37.354]  And there's no way we're going to be able to continue to advance our foreign policy interests in the way in which they're being advanced under the Bush administration without creating a war.
[02:10:37.674 --> 02:10:45.519]  China last week passed a resolution authorizing the invasion of Taiwan, and right now Russia's doing a war-grain drill with them to invade.
[02:10:45.839 --> 02:10:54.165]  Absolutely, and you know, the rationale that Europe and the Soviets have tried to sell to the American people and to people generally in the West
[02:10:54.705 --> 02:10:57.808]  Is that look, we have to sell these ordinances to China.
[02:10:57.928 --> 02:10:59.590]  They're mostly obsolete.
[02:10:59.730 --> 02:11:01.812]  The Clinton administration sold missiles over there.
[02:11:02.212 --> 02:11:15.685]  And in spite of the talk about lifting the arms embargo, that's a carrot that Europe is dangling before China's face to get them to have some momentum towards the Euro and away from the dollar as a reserve currency, which is another strategic threat to America.
[02:11:15.825 --> 02:11:17.525]  And if China does that, it all implodes.
[02:11:17.665 --> 02:11:18.486]  Oh, it all implodes.
[02:11:18.506 --> 02:11:19.766]  The whole world's economy is done.
[02:11:20.206 --> 02:11:28.328]  And this is what Europe, and particularly Russia, with Putin's momentum towards the establishment of a Eurasian Economic Union, is trying to bring about.
[02:11:28.348 --> 02:11:29.108]  Well, that's what they said.
[02:11:29.128 --> 02:11:33.069]  They said, we're going to create a Russian, Europe-based New World Order.
[02:11:33.089 --> 02:11:33.569]  That's right.
[02:11:33.689 --> 02:11:36.790]  And that's why the operation they're running right now is called Commonwealth 2005.
[02:11:38.691 --> 02:11:42.834]  Now, let's get above this, though, and go to the next level of the pyramid, then we're going to Kohl's.
[02:11:43.514 --> 02:11:46.937]  You look at who owns Russia's six big oligarchs.
[02:11:47.377 --> 02:11:52.100]  It's come out Lord Rothschild is the secret signatory and real owner of these six companies.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.641]  That's BBC News.
[02:11:54.462 --> 02:11:56.764]  You look at who owns this country's stocks.
[02:11:56.824 --> 02:11:58.385]  It's predominantly British families.
[02:11:58.885 --> 02:11:59.646]  That's Forbes.
[02:12:00.538 --> 02:12:05.720]  When you look at it, though, they act like there's this bipolar world between Russia, Europe, and the U.S.
[02:12:06.081 --> 02:12:14.525]  When in reality, though, it's the same group that Dr. Tania Kardashian, the chief economist in Russia, called the Death Sed, or the Order of Death.
[02:12:14.985 --> 02:12:17.046]  Now, she's not talking about skull and bones alone, folks.
[02:12:17.106 --> 02:12:21.868]  In my studies, when you really look at this, you find out it is a global
[02:12:22.328 --> 02:12:25.611]  And Andra, I don't know where you stand on this, but this is what my new film covers.
[02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:26.672]  This is the truth.
[02:12:26.792 --> 02:12:28.053]  I can prove it conclusively.
[02:12:28.493 --> 02:12:37.700]  It is literally a group of Nazi devil-worshippers, I'm serious, that control this thing and are ushering in what they call World War 4.
[02:12:38.141 --> 02:12:41.583]  They call the Cold War World War 3.
[02:12:41.823 --> 02:12:46.127]  They're ushering in this worldwide economic military cataclysm.
[02:12:46.467 --> 02:12:50.110]  Out of that, they say the people will beg for a world government.
[02:12:50.450 --> 02:13:01.378]  You know, I can tell you this, that what we are under is a global socialist dictatorship, and it's being dictated by very powerful banking interests and very powerful corporate interests, no question about it.
[02:13:01.838 --> 02:13:14.527]  It's being dictated by the ruling class elite, and I'm calling it socialism because what else can you call it when, take for instance right here in our country with the mortgage industry and all of these other government securities, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these companies
[02:13:16.008 --> 02:13:31.712]  They have the fiscal foundation of a house of cards, and they continue to facilitate these, they continue to broker these mortgages, and they know they don't have the fiscal base to do it, but they've got big brother there waiting in the wings to bail them out.
[02:13:31.772 --> 02:13:33.533]  Now, I submit to you that that's socialism.
[02:13:33.593 --> 02:13:40.034]  It's a transfer of wealth from the hands of the poor into these big brokerage houses that are running the mortgage industry amok.
[02:13:40.134 --> 02:13:42.235]  Now, they're doing this on a global scale.
[02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:44.610]  And it doesn't matter about your country.
[02:13:44.670 --> 02:13:50.815]  People must understand that these guys don't have a sense of nationalism, patriotism, patriotism... Well, you said something.
[02:13:51.275 --> 02:13:54.137]  I mean, I think you had a subconscious slip, which is correct.
[02:13:54.478 --> 02:13:56.259]  You call these corporations countries.
[02:13:56.599 --> 02:14:01.403]  Of the hundred richest countries, what, 45 of them are corporations?
[02:14:01.523 --> 02:14:02.204]  You got that right.
[02:14:02.744 --> 02:14:05.647]  So these corporations are bigger than most governments.
[02:14:06.067 --> 02:14:08.189]  They pay off and control our governments.
[02:14:08.849 --> 02:14:14.593]  And so when the world says, oh, America is taking over, no, America has been captured, hijacked.
[02:14:15.194 --> 02:14:20.358]  You know, when a big ship starts running over other little boats, you don't blame the ship, you blame the captain.
[02:14:20.698 --> 02:14:30.525]  You know something Alex, if we can't see that, take for instance this social security thing, if we can't see that this is a pipeline to the benefactors of these politicians in Washington D.C.
[02:14:30.866 --> 02:14:32.727]  to put money in their coffers.
[02:14:32.747 --> 02:14:35.749]  They've already been stealing the money, now they're just going to take all of it.
[02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.490]  Absolutely.
[02:14:37.339 --> 02:14:37.719]  Absolutely.
[02:14:37.739 --> 02:14:38.320]  They want it all!
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:40.420]  Let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:46.183]  Up next, here in... Let's go ahead and talk to James in Delaware.
[02:14:46.263 --> 02:14:47.163]  James, you're on the air.
[02:14:47.203 --> 02:14:47.544]  Welcome.
[02:14:47.864 --> 02:14:48.564]  Hello, how are you?
[02:14:49.144 --> 02:14:49.364]  Good.
[02:14:49.725 --> 02:14:49.905]  Good.
[02:14:50.225 --> 02:15:00.749]  My question stems from an article I actually pulled off of Infowars.com dealing with Asia and Russia dumping sizable dollar amounts, or dumping dollar in sizable chunks.
[02:15:00.789 --> 02:15:03.891]  Yeah, they're going to the Euro or the Arab Dinar.
[02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:05.792]  Yes, and China also
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:13.045]  Calculating when to best dump the dollar for the yen, or unpeg it from the yen?
[02:15:13.085 --> 02:15:17.869]  Well, Japan has always been the bulwark, the chief owner of dollars.
[02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:19.029]  They're now starting to dump.
[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:25.355]  Now, what will this do to the American economy if the central banks switch over and diversify more?
[02:15:25.415 --> 02:15:30.679]  They'll just print money even faster, we'll have even more inflation, and the news will tell you there's no inflation.
[02:15:30.779 --> 02:15:31.099]  Andre?
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:32.861]  I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[02:15:32.921 --> 02:15:36.043]  I mean, the primary lump in
[02:15:36.844 --> 02:15:39.505]  Fiscal regulation internationally is the U.S.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:55.529]  housing market right now, and if China refuses to finance these huge deficits, and if they refuse to continue to finance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we're going to see that lump absolutely leveled, unless the Federal Reserve begins to pump money into the money supply and hyperinflate the dollar.
[02:15:55.849 --> 02:16:02.951]  Alan Greenspan told the House Budget Committee that he didn't see any evidence whatsoever that the Chinese were even considering a movement
[02:16:03.271 --> 02:16:05.773]  Towards the euro, replacing the dollar as their currency reserve.
[02:16:05.793 --> 02:16:07.815]  But they said they have and they've already moved 7%!
[02:16:08.015 --> 02:16:09.396]  Absolutely, I mean...
[02:16:12.082 --> 02:16:18.246]  I don't know why he said that, but I mean, you take a monkey and knock his brains out with a 26-ounce hammer, he should be able to see that.
[02:16:18.606 --> 02:16:33.496]  I mean, he talks about the yield curve conundrum, and he knows and he understands this relationship of the yield curve on the 10-year bond note to our housing markets, but he doesn't see any chance that China may attempt to, even for the sake of diversification, move out of the dollar.
[02:16:33.516 --> 02:16:36.818]  But China, last time I checked, had already moved 7% in the Euros.
[02:16:36.858 --> 02:16:37.519]  That's right.
[02:16:37.919 --> 02:16:39.240]  And this would devalue the dollar.
[02:16:39.983 --> 02:16:41.264]  They would destroy the dollar.
[02:16:41.324 --> 02:16:44.486]  Would this be the catalyst involved?
[02:16:44.646 --> 02:16:45.927]  Hey, sir, I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:16:46.187 --> 02:16:50.911]  The dollar has been devalued by 44% in the last three years against the euro.
[02:16:51.111 --> 02:16:53.833]  The euro was at 88 to 89 cents.
[02:16:53.853 --> 02:16:56.155]  It was 81 cents for every dollar in November of 2001.
[02:16:56.495 --> 02:16:57.576]  Yeah.
[02:16:58.356 --> 02:17:00.298]  Well, the point is that it's over 44%.
[02:17:00.798 --> 02:17:03.460]  It's already devalued.
[02:17:03.996 --> 02:17:14.338]  Now would this be the catalyst, when they actually switch to currency to diversify more, would this be a catalyst to the American people, a depression that would enable the government to force us into these concentration camps?
[02:17:14.838 --> 02:17:16.858]  Would that be the... Well, they're not going to be called camps.
[02:17:17.038 --> 02:17:18.559]  I have the Times of London yesterday.
[02:17:18.859 --> 02:17:21.179]  They're called rest and relocation centers.
[02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:23.880]  Yes, I've found... And this is for your safety, sir.
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:25.440]  And you're going to have to work.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:27.220]  I mean, you've got to work to feed everybody.
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.561]  If you're lazy, we can't put up with that.
[02:17:30.581 --> 02:17:31.441]  These aren't camps.
[02:17:32.236 --> 02:17:34.401]  These are Rest and Relocation Centers, sir.
[02:17:34.762 --> 02:17:35.082]  Stay there.
[02:17:35.102 --> 02:17:36.205]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[02:17:37.127 --> 02:17:37.468]  Quickly.
[02:17:37.488 --> 02:17:39.652]  Because I want to get to everybody else.
[02:17:40.654 --> 02:17:42.138]  Art, Dean, and Ray, and everybody else.
[02:17:42.158 --> 02:17:42.539]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:47.762]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:17:48.062 --> 02:17:52.667]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.967 --> 02:17:55.330]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.550 --> 02:17:57.091]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.472 --> 02:18:02.557]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:02.878 --> 02:18:04.099]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:18:04.159 --> 02:18:06.862]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:07.242 --> 02:18:13.186]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[02:18:14.587 --> 02:18:17.450]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:26.796 --> 02:18:32.303]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:32.383 --> 02:18:34.346]  Get the map.

[02:18:36.989 --> 02:18:37.991]  The time is now.
[02:18:38.331 --> 02:18:40.674]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.235 --> 02:18:44.359]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:18:45.763 --> 02:18:46.524]  Terrorism!
[02:18:46.684 --> 02:18:47.424]  Terrorism!
[02:18:47.524 --> 02:18:53.589]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:18:53.849 --> 02:18:55.451]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:18:55.691 --> 02:18:58.173]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:58.553 --> 02:19:13.144]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:13.164 --> 02:19:13.504]  government.
[02:19:13.665 --> 02:19:15.386]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.826 --> 02:19:21.749]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:26.392]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:19:45.066 --> 02:19:46.126]  Are you losing your hair?
[02:19:46.447 --> 02:19:47.887]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[02:19:48.227 --> 02:19:49.388]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[02:19:49.908 --> 02:19:51.568]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[02:19:51.788 --> 02:19:56.430]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[02:19:56.730 --> 02:19:59.771]  I've been using Avocor now for four months and it's a great product.
[02:19:59.871 --> 02:20:01.952]  They back everything with a money-back guarantee.
[02:20:02.292 --> 02:20:03.013]  It works!
[02:20:03.393 --> 02:20:05.894]  My hair hasn't looked this good in over 15 years.
[02:20:07.427 --> 02:20:12.252]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[02:20:12.452 --> 02:20:16.156]  We're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.
[02:20:16.476 --> 02:20:20.661]  Avacor is proven to successfully stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[02:20:21.241 --> 02:20:26.747]  Even if hair loss runs in the family, Avacor can help you regrow your own natural hair.
[02:20:27.227 --> 02:20:27.548]  Call 1-800-548-5910.

[02:20:32.592 --> 02:20:32.792]  Call 1-800-548-5910.
[02:20:32.812 --> 02:20:33.232]  That's 1-800-548-5910.
[02:20:33.312 --> 02:20:37.494]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:20:56.485 --> 02:21:06.156]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:21:07.077 --> 02:21:13.665]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:21:14.614 --> 02:21:23.456]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:21:24.056 --> 02:21:25.557]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:25.637 --> 02:21:25.877]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:25.897 --> 02:21:26.057]  Call now.
[02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:31.438]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:21:49.848 --> 02:22:04.693]  Globalists, the social architects, the controllers, are very good at, after they create a crisis, they then suddenly will engage in a terror attack, or blame it on some foreign enemy to take all of your anger and misdirect it.
[02:22:04.733 --> 02:22:11.636]  So, right after an economic crash, or right before it, you'll have a huge terrorist attack.
[02:22:11.676 --> 02:22:12.596]  Then they'll pull out
[02:22:13.263 --> 02:22:14.024]  I don't think so.
[02:22:28.095 --> 02:22:34.580]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt did, but they'll have to be men with machine guns guarding the camp because there might be terrorists that plan to attack it.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:44.307]  And then if you refuse to work at these big work camps, or if you're in debt in part of one of these debtor camps they're openly talking about, then sorry, we're going to have to lock you up.
[02:22:44.667 --> 02:22:49.091]  And I've been to Marine Corps drills where they're drilling for American cities, putting people in camps,
[02:22:49.892 --> 02:22:57.063]  There's Newsmax found the documents a few years ago about three one million man camps in public bidding for these.
[02:22:57.083 --> 02:22:57.965]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:22:58.285 --> 02:22:59.387]  They're gearing up for it.
[02:22:59.728 --> 02:23:00.849]  The question is why?
[02:23:00.890 --> 02:23:02.212]  They've been gearing up for decades.
[02:23:03.573 --> 02:23:07.114]  And if we expose them, they may not be as confident and may not go ahead with this.
[02:23:07.394 --> 02:23:08.515]  Now, I want to go to all your calls.
[02:23:08.855 --> 02:23:09.715]  We've got to hurry here.
[02:23:09.795 --> 02:23:11.856]  James, finish what you're saying in 15 seconds.
[02:23:11.896 --> 02:23:12.256]  Go ahead.
[02:23:12.636 --> 02:23:26.401]  Yes, I see the next terrorist attack as, or perceived terrorist attack, would be the dumping of the dollar by other countries, destroying our dollar, sold to the American people as a financial terror attack, or an equivalent of a nuclear first strike.
[02:23:27.156 --> 02:23:28.917]  Well, Bush says he wants a weak dollar.
[02:23:28.937 --> 02:23:31.279]  So again, this is part of a larger global plan.
[02:23:31.299 --> 02:23:32.279]  Thanks for the call, Andre.
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:33.540]  I agree with you.
[02:23:34.341 --> 02:23:37.903]  The question is, why haven't we seen more sobriety?
[02:23:37.943 --> 02:23:44.287]  I mean, these low interest rates, the easy money and the loose credit, they are nothing but the fuel of asset bubbles.
[02:23:44.327 --> 02:23:50.731]  And we've gone from a production economy to a service economy to an economic environment of multiple asset bubbles.
[02:23:50.771 --> 02:23:53.773]  Now, the Fed is now beginning to swing the pendulum the other way.
[02:23:54.453 --> 02:24:00.739]  And there have been 11 rake hikes in the last 50 years, only none of them have achieved the soft landing that they've been looking for.
[02:24:00.839 --> 02:24:05.163]  And they tell us that NAFTA and GATT would be great, now they're going to expand it with Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[02:24:05.544 --> 02:24:07.225]  You know, everything they say is great, folks.
[02:24:07.265 --> 02:24:08.006]  Hasn't been great?
[02:24:09.062 --> 02:24:20.644]  I tell you, the first area we can look to be hit is probably going to be the financial sector, and then after that, you know, you're going to see the junk bars are going to get hit, real estate, the bubble's going to pop.
[02:24:20.724 --> 02:24:26.005]  I mean, we are headlong into an economic perfect storm.
[02:24:27.386 --> 02:24:28.046]  Unbelievable.
[02:24:28.946 --> 02:24:31.227]  Let's go ahead and go to Art in Michigan.
[02:24:31.367 --> 02:24:32.567]  Art, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:24:32.587 --> 02:24:33.027]  Go ahead.
[02:24:33.767 --> 02:24:34.187]  Yes.
[02:24:35.247 --> 02:24:38.028]  I'm holding Andre's book in my hand, and I have nothing
[02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:47.140]  If I say thumbs up, that'd be a misstatement, because it arms up with palms flat out towards the Creator of Heaven and Earth.
[02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:57.804]  And I'm aware of McFadden's book of the 30s, and Charles Lindbergh's of the infamous 1913, and a creature from Jekyll Island, all of that.
[02:24:58.164 --> 02:25:06.167]  But I have to say this for Andre, that he hooks it up to where the real power and authority is, okay?
[02:25:06.247 --> 02:25:07.468]  He hooks it up scripturally.
[02:25:08.021 --> 02:25:11.263]  And let me just use this for a springboard.
[02:25:11.303 --> 02:25:16.627]  A few minutes ago, I guess an hour and a half ago, but it's the best hour and a half I've ever hung on to a phone.
[02:25:17.047 --> 02:25:26.973]  But anyway, it was mentioned about the new speak, or the so using old terms, and the devil speak on them, reveals himself.
[02:25:27.393 --> 02:25:34.518]  But I was surprised, Alex, you sort of missed it as sharp and as quick and as whatever you are, that the spaceship never could nether.
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:36.261]  Was in the Matrix.
[02:25:36.301 --> 02:25:37.543]  You remember that, Neil?
[02:25:37.723 --> 02:25:38.264]  It on there?
[02:25:38.824 --> 02:25:40.086]  Well, see?
[02:25:40.526 --> 02:25:43.109]  It's the old dualism, the match and merge.
[02:25:43.189 --> 02:25:48.916]  Now, there are people in this cause, or I say THE cause, because there's money in it.
[02:25:49.321 --> 02:25:53.203]  And then there's people in it for the cause, for the cause of righteousness.
[02:25:53.523 --> 02:25:57.664]  And I count Alex, and Andre, I count you both in that book.
[02:25:57.684 --> 02:26:07.308]  For those who just joined us, so it doesn't sound completely off the charts, you're talking about occult names in movies, and culture, and all the names of the spacecraft at NASA are occultic.
[02:26:07.368 --> 02:26:09.029]  I mean, is that what you're bringing up?
[02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:11.230]  Amen, hallelujah, you got it right on.
[02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:12.911]  Okay, well thank you for the call.
[02:26:12.951 --> 02:26:14.772]  I appreciate those fine comments.
[02:26:15.332 --> 02:26:22.917]  And for those that want to get the book, you can call 800-686-2237 to get a copy of it for $14.95.
[02:26:22.957 --> 02:26:34.184]  800-686-2237 or go to GCNlive.com and click on the secure shopping cart and you'll find Andre's book, Thieves in the Temple, America under the Federal Reserve System.
[02:26:34.584 --> 02:26:38.306]  Now, let's go to Dean in Wisconsin.
[02:26:38.326 --> 02:26:39.147]  Dean, go ahead.
[02:26:39.167 --> 02:26:41.228]  Yeah, are you there?
[02:26:41.673 --> 02:26:44.155]  You know, from Wisconsin, I haven't called you in a couple of years, my friend.
[02:26:44.175 --> 02:26:45.456]  In a long time.
[02:26:45.476 --> 02:26:46.436]  Well, thanks for calling.
[02:26:46.456 --> 02:26:46.977]  What's on your mind?
[02:26:46.997 --> 02:26:51.380]  I remember talking to you a couple of years ago when I first heard about you, but I just have four quick things.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.303]  Uh, you know, the problem we're having today, gentlemen, is that we love good, right?
[02:26:56.323 --> 02:26:58.144]  You love good, don't you, A.J.?
[02:26:58.264 --> 02:27:01.627]  And, Andre, we're gonna start hating evil.
[02:27:02.427 --> 02:27:04.148]  We need to start hating evil, people.
[02:27:04.548 --> 02:27:05.689]  It's not being done.
[02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:08.051]  That's reality.
[02:27:09.033 --> 02:27:11.475]  Well, I mean, if I just hated evil, I'd burn out.
[02:27:12.535 --> 02:27:14.236]  I fight because I love my family.
[02:27:14.416 --> 02:27:15.057]  Exactly.
[02:27:15.077 --> 02:27:17.098]  I think that's a greater power source.
[02:27:17.198 --> 02:27:17.558]  There you go.
[02:27:17.598 --> 02:27:21.201]  And point number two, that C is in the temple.
[02:27:21.981 --> 02:27:23.002]  Well, just stay there.
[02:27:23.122 --> 02:27:25.684]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, Dean.
[02:27:26.124 --> 02:27:28.405]  Then we'll go to Tim and many others that are holding.
[02:27:28.425 --> 02:27:28.706]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:28.746 --> 02:27:29.866]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:27:29.886 --> 02:27:30.407]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.090 --> 02:27:39.078]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.001 --> 02:27:42.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.731 --> 02:27:52.256]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:27:52.396 --> 02:27:53.457]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:27:53.577 --> 02:27:54.458]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:27:54.578 --> 02:27:57.420]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:27:57.601 --> 02:28:02.485]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:28:02.725 --> 02:28:03.806]  Check out this new product.
[02:28:03.966 --> 02:28:06.868]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:28:07.229 --> 02:28:10.912]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:28:11.152 --> 02:28:13.735]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.

[02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:22.083]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:28:22.183 --> 02:28:27.608]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:28:27.688 --> 02:28:28.449]  Try No-B-O.

[02:30:14.388 --> 02:30:15.528]  Sugarbalance.org.
[02:30:15.548 --> 02:30:16.508]  The U.S.

[02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:28.451]  The Nobel Prize winning science of Food Matrix has created an organic formula, providing you the vital nutrients you need.

[02:30:50.726 --> 02:30:52.647]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.128 --> 02:30:55.950]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.971 --> 02:31:00.694]  Folks, we've unloaded phone lines as the start of the broadcast, like we do each day.
[02:31:02.396 --> 02:31:24.967]  I'm really going to give each caller about a minute but Andre about 30 seconds to answer because I want to try to cram a bunch of people in here at the end the last 26 minutes 26 and a half minutes we've got left here so have your questions and comments ready be quick please to be fair to others before we go back to Andre and all of the callers that are patiently holding at 800-259-9231 call them when you hear somebody hang up before we do that
[02:31:30.541 --> 02:31:34.004]  Again, I want to tell you, because we're getting some calls, what's that number?
[02:31:34.084 --> 02:31:34.624]  I missed it.
[02:31:35.805 --> 02:31:48.374]  Again, Andre Eglishon takes you on a captivating and electrifying journey through the evolution of America's experiments with privately owned central banks in his powerful new book, Thieves of the Temple, America Under the Federal Reserve System.
[02:31:48.674 --> 02:31:57.380]  This book brings us face-to-face with the fact that in 1913, America allowed a few greedy men to unconstitutionally privatize the issuance of our money, credit,
[02:31:58.681 --> 02:32:08.925]  And enact a usury-based monetary law creating a system of perpetually exploiting debt, expanding debt, and ultimately destroying America's once-proud economic sovereignty.
[02:32:09.805 --> 02:32:13.106]  And it goes into the IMF and World Bank today, how they operate.
[02:32:13.126 --> 02:32:14.167]  It's really an excellent book.
[02:32:14.787 --> 02:32:17.128]  And I hope that you'll get a copy of it at $14.95.

[02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:37.091]  Marshall Law covers the latest police state information.
[02:33:37.472 --> 02:33:39.414]  It covers who really carried out 9-11.
[02:33:39.934 --> 02:33:44.379]  It covers the occult elite that controls this worldwide banking system.
[02:33:45.279 --> 02:34:02.794]  And then the film ends, 2 hours 35 minutes long, with Bush being sworn in and engaging in treason and violating his oath of office because we show you, for the last 10 minutes, how he systematically is dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution for his masters.
[02:34:03.835 --> 02:34:10.821]  It is so important, the reviews have been just overwhelmingly 100% positive.
[02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:12.462]  You want to write a negative one for it?
[02:34:13.796 --> 02:34:16.961]  Send one to the review section of PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:34:23.971 --> 02:34:25.374]  Not one has been negative.

[02:35:12.583 --> 02:35:13.664]  Going back to Andre.
[02:35:13.804 --> 02:35:15.405]  Andre, let's go straight back into the calls.
[02:35:15.685 --> 02:35:18.548]  Real fast, finish your points, Dean in Wisconsin.
[02:35:18.828 --> 02:35:20.349]  Yeah, just one minute here.
[02:35:20.409 --> 02:35:22.311]  I've got two comments and a question.
[02:35:22.952 --> 02:35:29.337]  No, the thieves in the Temple, gentlemen, are the biggest ones, are the National Evangelical Christian of Washington, who think he's a Christian.
[02:35:29.377 --> 02:35:29.917]  Well, he's not.
[02:35:30.137 --> 02:35:30.918]  Okay, okay.
[02:35:31.158 --> 02:35:32.179]  He doesn't think he's a Christian.
[02:35:32.199 --> 02:35:33.220]  We'll comment on that next.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.321]  And the other thing is the draft.
[02:35:35.341 --> 02:35:36.682]  Well, he won't be drafting my son.
[02:35:36.702 --> 02:35:36.882]  He's 16.
[02:35:37.063 --> 02:35:39.364]  I've got a daughter of 14 and a son of 9.
[02:35:39.404 --> 02:35:41.626]  Sorry, folks, but I'm going to resist that.
[02:35:41.686 --> 02:35:42.727]  And my question is this.
[02:35:43.527 --> 02:35:44.388]  I'm out of work, people.
[02:35:44.408 --> 02:35:52.394]  Three and a half years without a job, trying to find some employment, and I have no idea where my next bus is coming from, and I'm not a happy camper.
[02:35:53.430 --> 02:35:57.056]  I try to be a civil person, but you know, beyond that, here's my question.
[02:35:57.497 --> 02:36:04.850]  Is it true, I talked to Butch Paul, Alex, and Andre, you can comment on this, is it true that the Homeland Security now, and also the Patriot Act 1 and 2,
[02:36:06.058 --> 02:36:10.280]  We're also being instigated into the hiring practices of companies.
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:10.600]  Yes, it is.
[02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:11.461]  Thank you for the call.
[02:36:11.881 --> 02:36:12.601]  Andre comments.
[02:36:12.901 --> 02:36:26.048]  Well, he's absolutely right to be concerned about his employment situation because, as I was talking about earlier, our country, the country that we love, America, is going to undergo the self-same gangstrification that we see in the Caribbean right now.
[02:36:26.128 --> 02:36:29.170]  And in terms of the Christians being, you know,
[02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:36.717]  Christianity has been co-opted many times before in order to advance an imperialistic agenda.
[02:36:36.917 --> 02:36:39.580]  The entire Bible warns people about false prophets!
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.220]  Absolutely!
[02:36:42.963 --> 02:36:44.024]  Unbelievable!
[02:36:44.524 --> 02:36:47.067]  Now, he was bringing up the fact that
[02:36:47.930 --> 02:36:51.652]  Is it true that Homeland Security is going to control the hiring processes?
[02:36:51.692 --> 02:36:51.932]  Yes.
[02:36:52.253 --> 02:36:53.033]  Ridge has said it.
[02:36:53.073 --> 02:36:53.834]  They've all said it.
[02:36:54.174 --> 02:36:57.856]  Hundreds of private indexes run by convicted, you know, cocaine dealers.
[02:36:58.096 --> 02:37:00.417]  They put innocent people's names over now 400,000.
[02:37:00.517 --> 02:37:04.580]  I've been saying 350,000 innocent people in these databases.
[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:05.020]  Andre?
[02:37:05.701 --> 02:37:07.882]  Well, it could very well be.
[02:37:07.942 --> 02:37:12.505]  I mean, we saw it already with so many people being incarcerated after 9-11.
[02:37:13.965 --> 02:37:24.673]  Having not been charged with a crime, denied the right to counsel, the Patriot Act is a grand compromise to our civil liberty in this country, and it should be something that our elected representatives should be squawking about.
[02:37:24.693 --> 02:37:32.319]  They've said on record, and it's in this new National ID Card Bill, where you've got to be in good graces with them once they finally get it in place to have a job.
[02:37:32.599 --> 02:37:33.160]  Pretty much.
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:36.162]  I mean, you know, Revelation the 13th chapter says it all.
[02:37:36.202 --> 02:37:38.944]  I mean, you won't be able to buy or sell unless you receive that mark.
[02:37:39.464 --> 02:37:41.365]  You know, I see that mark as a mindset.
[02:37:41.405 --> 02:37:48.349]  You look up the word mark in the dictionary, it means to characterize, as the 19th century was characterized by the Industrial Revolution.
[02:37:48.369 --> 02:37:57.935]  So if your mind can be characterized by someone who is indulging in the relentless pursuit of gain and indulgence, then you have that mark of the beast.
[02:37:57.975 --> 02:38:06.880]  Now, it may have a physical counterpart as well, but I think that the greater mark is a person whose conscience is marked by greed and indulgence, no matter what the cost.
[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:08.081]  I agree.
[02:38:08.141 --> 02:38:09.222]  What is the Antichrist?
[02:38:09.262 --> 02:38:16.168]  He is the opposite of Christ in his actions, but his rhetoric is very close to what Christ says.
[02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:17.470]  He is a counterfeit.
[02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:21.653]  And so Christ says, do unto others as you have them do unto you.
[02:38:22.354 --> 02:38:25.597]  Christ says, love your neighbor as yourself.
[02:38:25.657 --> 02:38:26.498]  Lay down your life.
[02:38:26.958 --> 02:38:33.504]  Today, these yuppies and people think, by only caring about themselves, by only, you know, so what, it's all about me.
[02:38:33.584 --> 02:38:43.031]  They think that creates a climate where they're going to do well, and that works for a while, but then everybody becomes a parasite, and you talk about the gangstrification, that's the implosion.
[02:38:43.332 --> 02:38:44.172]  You got that right.
[02:38:44.212 --> 02:38:45.794]  I mean, one of the principles of
[02:38:46.534 --> 02:38:47.395]  We're good to go.
[02:39:16.674 --> 02:39:17.775]  Absolutely!
[02:39:18.076 --> 02:39:22.900]  So, you know, the free market ideology has a lot of negative baggage right along with it.
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.163]  So, as we endorse free market capitalism, we should be mindful of that.
[02:39:26.303 --> 02:39:28.325]  That's because it's not really free market capitalism.
[02:39:28.345 --> 02:39:28.825]  That's right.
[02:39:29.126 --> 02:39:30.347]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:39:30.387 --> 02:39:31.588]  Gotta move quick here, folks.
[02:39:32.369 --> 02:39:34.250]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:39:34.290 --> 02:39:34.971]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:39:35.131 --> 02:39:35.712]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:39:35.992 --> 02:39:36.272]  Hello.
[02:39:36.392 --> 02:39:36.953]  Hello, Andre.
[02:39:37.033 --> 02:39:42.738]  I was hoping you could talk a bit, if it's come up on your radar, the Depository Trust Corporation in New York.
[02:39:43.288 --> 02:39:48.291]  And it's correlation to the Independent Treasury Act of 1921 and the Federal Reserve.
[02:39:48.311 --> 02:39:50.212]  Yeah, explain to them what that institution does.
[02:39:50.672 --> 02:39:56.735]  Well, the Treasury Department basically, what they do is they actually print the money.
[02:39:56.895 --> 02:39:58.436]  And they actually issue the money.
[02:39:59.236 --> 02:40:02.058]  It is the depositing house for all government assets.
[02:40:02.858 --> 02:40:04.399]  It's where Social Security has gone.
[02:40:04.459 --> 02:40:16.026]  It's one general fund there that Congress has actually been extracting money from, wherein we think that there are a bunch of separate accounts that are set up for aid and development and Social Security and all the other things that the government is doing.
[02:40:16.346 --> 02:40:18.908]  It's all coming out of one general fund.
[02:40:19.228 --> 02:40:20.049]  This was a mistake.
[02:40:20.489 --> 02:40:21.369]  It's a counterpart.
[02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:23.771]  It's the sister organization to the Federal Reserve System.
[02:40:24.151 --> 02:40:29.861]  Now, they're using all of these social organizations set up within the states also to siphon money from the states.
[02:40:29.921 --> 02:40:30.602]  Absolutely.
[02:40:30.643 --> 02:40:31.764]  Well, we've got a point here, too.
[02:40:31.785 --> 02:40:36.332]  This is what all this federally controlled money, with the policies set by the private banks, does.
[02:40:36.673 --> 02:40:37.554]  They tell the states.
[02:40:38.314 --> 02:40:42.795]  Arrest certain X number of men, whether they're innocent or guilty, and you get more funds.
[02:40:43.075 --> 02:40:44.555]  Absolutely.
[02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:47.656]  Now you don't even yell at your wife, you still get arrested.
[02:40:47.856 --> 02:40:51.217]  They say grab X number of children, or you don't get your funds.
[02:40:51.477 --> 02:40:54.457]  Vaccinate certain number of children, or you don't get your funds.
[02:40:54.577 --> 02:40:59.398]  They literally have bounties on getting us into prison, getting us into the psychiatric system.
[02:40:59.819 --> 02:41:01.939]  This is how they're engineering society.
[02:41:02.259 --> 02:41:05.980]  And allowing our communities to deteriorate in order to get federal funds.
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:07.260]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:10.601]  I mean, the system, it's a self-cannibalizing system.
[02:41:10.721 --> 02:41:14.822]  It's openly set up to dehumanize us and turn us into mindless animals.
[02:41:14.902 --> 02:41:15.142]  Yes.
[02:41:15.882 --> 02:41:17.522]  It is engineered that way.
[02:41:18.782 --> 02:41:20.163]  Thank you for the call, Tim.
[02:41:20.183 --> 02:41:20.983]  Who's up next here?
[02:41:22.663 --> 02:41:23.983]  Shane in Texas, go ahead.
[02:41:26.044 --> 02:41:31.845]  Yes, I just had a very brief question regarding the way that the National Earth
[02:41:32.489 --> 02:41:35.533]  I was just curious, I understand that the Federal Reserve is a private bank.
[02:41:35.593 --> 02:41:39.157]  Is that the same type of thing that the World Bank is, or is that a different type of organization?
[02:41:52.452 --> 02:41:56.214]  Well, it is a private bank, the Federal Reserve is, and so is the World Bank.
[02:41:56.234 --> 02:42:02.977]  The World Bank and the IMF are funded by over 200 member nations, but the lion's share of the funding comes from the United States of America.
[02:42:03.517 --> 02:42:10.281]  And the self-same modus operandi by which the Fed operates, so does the World Bank IMF.
[02:42:10.341 --> 02:42:14.523]  That is, they create money out of nothing at all, get people addicted to it, and enslave you.
[02:42:14.683 --> 02:42:15.243]  And then they...
[02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:25.116]  Back up that fiat currency by the military, and then they tell client countries, let these private corporations take control of your assets, or we won't give you more money.
[02:42:25.296 --> 02:42:25.816]  That's it.
[02:42:26.617 --> 02:42:27.437]  Totally criminal.
[02:42:27.477 --> 02:42:28.038]  Anything else?
[02:42:29.038 --> 02:42:29.499]  No, that's it.
[02:42:29.519 --> 02:42:30.139]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:30.319 --> 02:42:31.160]  Good call.
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:31.560]  Thank you.
[02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:32.200]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:32.601 --> 02:42:33.681]  Nathan in Tennessee.
[02:42:34.002 --> 02:42:34.882]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[02:42:34.942 --> 02:42:35.382]  Go ahead.
[02:42:36.903 --> 02:42:37.384]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:38.004 --> 02:42:38.284]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:38.705 --> 02:42:40.005]  It's always an honor to talk with you.
[02:42:40.606 --> 02:42:40.926]  Thank you.
[02:42:41.106 --> 02:42:43.007]  Real quick, I just have a comment about China.
[02:42:45.544 --> 02:42:56.633]  I took a welding class here at a local community college and just to give you an idea of how much steel has increased in price because of China buying it all up.
[02:42:57.114 --> 02:43:06.922]  We were buying 20 foot bars and they were 2 inches wide and a quarter inch thick for $20 last year before April I think and the price went up to $36 in less than a month.
[02:43:08.470 --> 02:43:09.590]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:43:09.651 --> 02:43:12.232]  I mean, there's a tremendous trade imbalance with China right now.
[02:43:12.252 --> 02:43:15.693]  We're $124 billion in a trade deficit with China.
[02:43:15.773 --> 02:43:17.754]  Imports from China... And that's only China!
[02:43:18.034 --> 02:43:18.854]  That's only China!
[02:43:19.174 --> 02:43:19.655]  Absolutely.
[02:43:19.975 --> 02:43:30.539]  And steel... China's consuming 27% of the world's steel, including the steel that came out of the World Trade Center before forensic science had a chance to go over and find out why did it collapse.
[02:43:31.079 --> 02:43:37.540]  But don't worry, we'll see a lot of that steel back here in this country in the form of imported cars from China in the very near future.
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:39.581]  Yeah, they're now getting into cars.
[02:43:39.781 --> 02:43:40.301]  Absolutely.
[02:43:42.642 --> 02:43:58.745]  Quickly, what that had actually done locally on the local small business level, that increased prices so much in steel that little businesses that weld together trailers and stuff like that, it's actually put all those small businesses out.
[02:43:59.676 --> 02:44:01.617]  Like, uh, they can't afford to buy the fuel anymore.
[02:44:01.637 --> 02:44:01.937]  No, I hear you.
[02:44:01.957 --> 02:44:02.557]  I appreciate the call.
[02:44:02.637 --> 02:44:04.638]  And that's a big part of this.
[02:44:05.058 --> 02:44:20.203]  The globalists, openly, with George Bush as the ambassador, with Nixon, made the deal with the Chinese to use them with their slave labor, to leverage out all the free market companies and corporations in the West, and then only select corporations are allowed to do the lion's share of business.
[02:44:20.443 --> 02:44:26.725]  They then use that as economic warfare to consolidate, and that's now the process we're seeing the end results of.
[02:44:27.165 --> 02:44:29.006]  That's characteristic of any cartel.
[02:44:29.713 --> 02:44:30.533]  You're absolutely right.
[02:44:30.793 --> 02:44:32.394]  And so really it's an oligopoly.
[02:44:33.334 --> 02:44:36.415]  But then if you look at the select corporations, they're all interlocking directorates.
[02:44:36.475 --> 02:44:37.696]  It's truly a monopoly.
[02:44:37.996 --> 02:44:38.576]  Absolutely.
[02:44:38.596 --> 02:44:46.319]  I characterize it as a global hegemonic plutocracy operated by neoconservatives as the poodles in government to pull all this off.
[02:44:47.242 --> 02:44:54.287]  Who are just a front minions will be discarded later with a counter-revolutionary false left-wing movement to be engineered after the collapse.
[02:44:54.407 --> 02:44:54.928]  Absolutely.
[02:44:55.308 --> 02:44:57.430]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:44:57.470 --> 02:44:58.370]  Russell, you're on the air.
[02:44:58.390 --> 02:44:58.791]  Go ahead.
[02:44:59.291 --> 02:45:00.832]  Pleasure to talk to you both and an honor.
[02:45:01.493 --> 02:45:03.874]  Excellent show today, Andre and Alex.
[02:45:04.315 --> 02:45:07.057]  Andre, question for you and I'd like Alex to comment as well.
[02:45:07.977 --> 02:45:13.361]  We know that there's going to be an economic turmoil ahead and we know there's going to be probably financial disaster.
[02:45:13.461 --> 02:45:15.383]  What do you both recommend
[02:45:19.539 --> 02:45:23.340]  I'll just say this first.
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:38.743]  Get out of debt, get a piece of property with a shack on it in the country, have water filters, storable foods, have information, have friends, have firearms, get some gold, get some silver, and basically have an escape route.
[02:45:38.843 --> 02:45:39.003]  Andre?
[02:45:39.523 --> 02:45:41.645]  Well, you need to know where you are in the business cycle.
[02:45:41.705 --> 02:45:48.151]  Right now, the business cycle, I believe, in terms of securities, they're at the crest right now.
[02:45:48.531 --> 02:45:54.556]  And when commodities begin to outperform securities, you know that the business cycle is about ready to flip.
[02:45:54.596 --> 02:46:00.862]  So, right now, energy is up 70%, base metals are up 30-40%, and that's where I would be.
[02:46:00.922 --> 02:46:02.023]  That's where I would put my money.
[02:46:03.644 --> 02:46:10.189]  I would hedge further devaluation of the dollar by, you know, maybe acquiring some Euros on the currency exchange market.
[02:46:11.529 --> 02:46:13.511]  You know, these are all things that I would do.
[02:46:13.651 --> 02:46:16.873]  Ultimately, I would try to buy a little piece of land out in the country somewhere.
[02:46:16.893 --> 02:46:18.114]  Yeah, Andre, I would say this.
[02:46:18.134 --> 02:46:21.196]  I mean, morally, I'm not going to invest in Euros.
[02:46:21.716 --> 02:46:25.179]  I'm not going to invest in offense, which they call defense.
[02:46:25.839 --> 02:46:29.121]  I am not going to invest in the energy stocks.
[02:46:29.181 --> 02:46:30.022]  Call me stupid,
[02:46:30.622 --> 02:46:32.762]  I mean, I know I'd be making huge profits.
[02:46:32.822 --> 02:46:34.063]  Absolutely, that was the question.
[02:46:34.543 --> 02:46:35.583]  But I'm not going to do it.
[02:46:35.803 --> 02:46:37.223]  Well, no, I understand.
[02:46:37.243 --> 02:46:39.244]  You're a conscientious investor.
[02:46:39.264 --> 02:46:42.504]  You're an investor activist, and that's the level that everybody's going to have to get to.
[02:46:42.904 --> 02:46:46.345]  But ultimately, as you said, I mean, get yourself out of debt as quickly as possible.
[02:46:46.785 --> 02:46:49.345]  Oh, I know you were just, you know, mechanically answering the question.
[02:46:49.365 --> 02:46:49.585]  Absolutely.
[02:46:49.605 --> 02:46:51.006]  I mean, you're right.
[02:46:51.086 --> 02:46:52.426]  I mean, invest in biometrics.
[02:46:52.466 --> 02:46:53.486]  I said that five years ago.
[02:46:53.766 --> 02:46:56.147]  Invest in evil, and you'll do quite nicely.
[02:46:56.167 --> 02:46:57.207]  Everything else won't do well.
[02:46:57.247 --> 02:46:57.787]  Who's up next?
[02:46:59.964 --> 02:47:02.026]  Mike in Arizona, go ahead and hit me, go ahead.
[02:47:03.627 --> 02:47:05.869]  Good afternoon, I really enjoy this program.
[02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:27.707]  I was reading a book here, it's called The Zionist Connection by Dr. Alfred Lilienthal, and he's talking about the Arab oil embargo back in 72 and 73, and there was an article in Psychology Today, and then a little bit after that, then Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger went on one of these weekend talk shows, and he came out and admitted
[02:47:28.226 --> 02:47:35.733]  That we needed to avoid another Arab oil embargo to militarily take over the Middle East oil field for security reasons.
[02:47:35.773 --> 02:47:39.296]  Well, that's all been the stated policy, but let me be clear about the whole Zionist thing.
[02:47:39.756 --> 02:47:46.903]  I mean, it's evil Arabs, it's evil Jews, it's evil Germans, it's evil Africans, it's evil people ruling over us.
[02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:47.443]  Andre?
[02:47:47.723 --> 02:47:48.824]  I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[02:47:48.884 --> 02:47:55.110]  This is not a Jewish conspiracy, this is a money conspiracy, and it's being perpetrated by virtually every ethnic group, the elites in those groups.
[02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:56.151]  All right.
[02:48:10.882 --> 02:48:13.104]  There was a naval exercise in the Mediterranean.
[02:48:13.124 --> 02:48:26.196]  The United States and Soviet Union had our ships out there, and instead of backing America as they promised that they would do, they started cutting off oil shipments to the United States at a very strategically crucial time.
[02:48:26.716 --> 02:48:39.562]  So, you know, we have been engaging the Saudi Royals, we've been engaging Vladimir Putin and every other despot on the face of the earth, but what has the American people gotten for it in exchange for these compromises in our foreign policy?
[02:48:39.662 --> 02:48:39.802]  Nothing.
[02:48:39.822 --> 02:48:40.523]  That's a key point.
[02:48:40.543 --> 02:48:43.264]  A lot of people think we're all part of this, we get something, we don't.
[02:48:46.681 --> 02:48:54.044]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:59.066]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.286 --> 02:49:04.928]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.168 --> 02:49:17.071]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the taxless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.091 --> 02:49:17.892]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:17.912 --> 02:49:21.633]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.793 --> 02:49:24.313]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.534 --> 02:49:29.735]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroy
[02:49:29.755 --> 02:49:30.196]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.874 --> 02:49:50.818]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:49:51.138 --> 02:49:56.562]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:56.622 --> 02:50:00.906]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:50:01.246 --> 02:50:04.268]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:04.588 --> 02:50:08.011]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:17.700]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:21.444]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:21.684 --> 02:50:28.791]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:50:46.565 --> 02:50:46.946]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.804 --> 02:51:02.464]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.329 --> 02:51:34.410]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.570 --> 02:51:40.532]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:48.334 --> 02:51:54.376]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.956 --> 02:51:57.917]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:00.470 --> 02:52:03.191]  Final segment, Andre Eglishan is our guest.
[02:52:03.211 --> 02:52:06.432]  He's written a book, Thieves in the Temple, America under the Federal Reserve System.
[02:52:07.292 --> 02:52:18.116]  If we don't expose this, this publicly private organization manipulating our economy, creating a system of eternal debt to enslave us, then we're never going to stop the New World Order.
[02:52:19.317 --> 02:52:21.698]  And you need to get Thieves in the Temple, my friends.
[02:52:21.718 --> 02:52:22.038]  800-686-2237.
[02:52:22.058 --> 02:52:22.038]  $14.95.
[02:52:22.078 --> 02:52:23.298]  It's a thick book, very well written.
[02:52:29.218 --> 02:52:30.919]  It's a bestseller out there.
[02:52:30.939 --> 02:52:32.820]  800-686-2237.
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:40.085]  Or go to GCNLive.com, click through the shopping cart, you can find it right there.
[02:52:40.145 --> 02:52:42.306]  And Andre's website is TalkToAndre.com.
[02:52:44.136 --> 02:52:46.557]  We're linked through to that at Infowars.com as well.
[02:52:47.278 --> 02:52:50.480]  We can't take any more calls here at the end of the show because we're basically out of time.
[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:53.842]  But Andre, I always enjoy talking to folks.
[02:52:53.902 --> 02:52:57.264]  It's good to know there's so many people out there that are concerned, that are upset.
[02:52:57.884 --> 02:53:04.368]  I have faith, as you said you do earlier, that we're going to make it out of this if we're aware of who the real terrorists are.
[02:53:04.908 --> 02:53:07.930]  And in closing, I'd like to get your take on what really happened on 9-11.
[02:53:09.315 --> 02:53:28.848]  I think 9-11, first of all, was a tragedy of epic proportion, and I think that at the very least we can say that a fertile ground, a fertile breeding environment for the type of despotism to perpetrate these acts of terrorism against people all over the earth has been inadvertently created by our foreign policy.
[02:53:29.148 --> 02:53:29.829]  Let me say this.
[02:53:31.109 --> 02:53:31.970]  Never in the history
[02:53:32.871 --> 02:53:34.431]  Of, uh, modern construction.
[02:53:34.451 --> 02:53:36.852]  Has a building ever collapsed from fire alone?
[02:53:37.332 --> 02:53:41.753]  We just had a towering inferno in, um, Spain a few, about a month ago.
[02:53:41.773 --> 02:53:43.194]  100 foot white flames.
[02:53:43.354 --> 02:53:45.074]  Absolutely, and the building didn't collapse.
[02:53:45.634 --> 02:53:51.216]  You should ask yourself, what happened to the wreckage of the Boeing 757 that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon?
[02:53:51.736 --> 02:54:09.775]  You know, why was it that NORAD, who knows exactly, even if a crow is flying at every square inch of airspace over this country, why did they lose the airplane that struck the Pentagon after it left Ohio and it didn't show back up on their radar screens until it got to D.C.?
[02:54:09.795 --> 02:54:12.798]  They thought it was part of a drill.
[02:54:12.918 --> 02:54:14.379]  They thought it was part of a drill or something.
[02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:16.101]  Come on, people.
[02:54:16.321 --> 02:54:19.863]  We need to wake up and start asking the federal government these types of serious questions.
[02:54:19.903 --> 02:54:22.124]  Andre, ask yourself who stands to gain from 9-11.
[02:54:22.184 --> 02:54:25.145]  Why would Arabs do this, knowing it would bring down the wrath?
[02:54:25.366 --> 02:54:28.827]  I don't think Arabs had the capability of pulling anything like this off.
[02:54:28.967 --> 02:54:29.828]  I really, really don't.
[02:54:29.848 --> 02:54:32.770]  My new film details what really happened on 9-11.
[02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:34.570]  We detail what happened to the buildings.
[02:54:34.891 --> 02:54:36.251]  We show how they carried out 9-11.
[02:54:36.271 --> 02:54:40.574]  And we definitively define how the operation was run.
[02:54:40.594 --> 02:54:42.615]  And that film is martial law.
[02:54:44.016 --> 02:54:45.757]  Andre, what do you see happening?
[02:54:45.777 --> 02:54:47.318]  Give us your forecast for the next few years.
[02:54:47.879 --> 02:54:50.501]  In the next few years, we're going to see a further erosion of the dollar.
[02:54:50.521 --> 02:54:55.045]  We're going to see the trend that the euro has been on since November of 2001 continue.
[02:54:55.685 --> 02:54:57.587]  The dollar will continue to lose its value.
[02:54:57.887 --> 02:55:06.574]  You're going to see a lot of pressure put on governments by internal economic forces to opt out of the dollar, as well as all other dollar-related assets.
[02:55:07.234 --> 02:55:09.835]  And I think we're going to see an economic collapse in America.
[02:55:10.055 --> 02:55:14.516]  And basically, the globalists have used America to pump up the Ponzi scheme.
[02:55:14.836 --> 02:55:19.897]  We're going to be imploded, and out of it, Europe will become preeminent, with a power axis with China and Russia.
[02:55:19.977 --> 02:55:22.078]  People have to understand that there are really two Americas.
[02:55:22.118 --> 02:55:27.119]  There's us, the American people, and then there's a ruling class oligarchy that really don't care about us.
[02:55:27.679 --> 02:55:31.260]  And they're going to make their money, but they're going to destroy us in the process.
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:32.581]  Yeah, they're offshore.
[02:55:32.901 --> 02:55:33.421]  Absolutely.
[02:55:34.375 --> 02:55:34.996]  Amazing.
[02:55:35.496 --> 02:55:46.403]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Thieves in the Temple America under the Federal Reserve System 800-686-2237 or you can also go to GCNlive.com and get the book right there.
[02:55:46.783 --> 02:55:51.646]  Andre, I want to have you back up again and I really want to thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[02:55:51.707 --> 02:55:52.487]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:52.527 --> 02:55:53.308]  Anytime, Alex.
[02:55:53.488 --> 02:55:53.808]  Thank you.
[02:55:54.308 --> 02:56:02.195]  And I would just add here that I see people waking up everywhere, more and more Andres out there fighting the Globalist, and we're better off for him.
[02:56:02.215 --> 02:56:02.615]  Take care.
[02:56:02.695 --> 02:56:05.658]  And you to be credited, and people like you for that.
[02:56:06.078 --> 02:56:07.660]  Well, you too, my friend.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:08.260]  God bless you.
[02:56:08.721 --> 02:56:11.523]  And all of you can be leaders in this fight against the Globalist.
[02:56:11.583 --> 02:56:14.045]  I mean, going along with it only ensures they'll win.
[02:56:14.525 --> 02:56:17.428]  Fighting it gives us and our children a chance with God's help.
[02:56:18.388 --> 02:56:28.355]  So again, I'll be back tonight 9 to midnight central on the shortwave at 3210 or on your local AM or FM station and back on Monday 11 to 2 with rebroadcasts throughout the weekend.
[02:56:29.016 --> 02:56:30.797]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:31.157 --> 02:56:32.098]  God bless you all!
