[00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:06.693]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.353 --> 00:00:08.434]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:10.254]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:11.695]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:13.315]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:17.977]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:22.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.501]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:32.944]  It is Wednesday, the 14th day of September 2005.
[00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:36.666]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:48.833]  Member of Parliament, formerly number three in the Blair government, Michael Meacher, who I interviewed in the United Kingdom a month or so ago, will be joining us for a full hour.
[00:00:49.957 --> 00:01:00.507]  To talk about the neocons, to talk about 9-11, to talk about the London bombings, to talk about their entire global agenda, and how to stop them.
[00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:11.958]  Michael Meacher resigned from the Blair government, refusing to go along with the lies on the eve of the Iraq war.
[00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.541]  And so he will be joining us
[00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:19.930]  Coming up, again, in the second hour, we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.270]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.672]  You're free to call in about any issue you wish.
[00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:39.836]  Fuel prices, the aftermath of Katrina, the unfolding reports of mass gun confiscations still ongoing in New Orleans.
[00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.498]  You're welcome to call in about any issue you wish.
[00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:54.343]  Requested only 455 buses to rescue 20,000, then canceled the order altogether.
[00:01:54.943 --> 00:01:57.284]  And that's from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:03.107]  As bodies were covered, reporters were told, no photos, no stories.
[00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:04.928]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:12.391]  Now a federal judge told the feds that, no, you can't bar the press covering this.
[00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:17.695]  And FEMA's answer is, hey, we're the boss, shut up.
[00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:20.757]  We got the men with machine guns.
[00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:27.201]  And I kept mentioning this article, and I'm glad that a listener dug it out and did email it to me.
[00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:32.685]  Two and a half years ago, New Orleans was federalized.
[00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:34.486]  The first fully federalized city.
[00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:36.768]  Now there's talk of federalizing it now.
[00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:37.228]  No, no, no, no.
[00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:38.989]  It was always federalized.
[00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.831]  That's how FEMA could basically have the stand down.
[00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:47.059]  And then jam the police communications to make sure things did fall apart.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.702]  That's what they do by design.
[00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:58.910]  And so, we'll go over this report from the Times-Picayune back on February 11, 2003.
[00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:03.354]  Oh, my birthday!
[00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:08.119]  This is a reprint of the article from the Times-Picayune.
[00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:21.705]  Nagan announces major overhaul of City Hall, new Homeland Security office to oversee cops, firemen, emergency agencies, and admits the feds were taking over.
[00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:28.630]  Bush has now taken responsibility for blunders after he made two or three people fall on the sword.
[00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.395]  It didn't work, so now he'll take responsibility, but there won't be any ramifications for Bush.
[00:03:36.423 --> 00:03:39.565]  The government all the time, you know, I take full responsibility.
[00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:41.746]  And then no one gets in trouble.
[00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:48.110]  So, Bush takes full responsibility, and then makes a bunch of excuses.
[00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:53.553]  Also, mystery surrounds flood wall breaches.
[00:03:54.293 --> 00:04:00.076]  This isn't from PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, as we've been covering the mystery for the last two weeks.
[00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:00.957]  No.
[00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:01.017]  No.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:09.101]  This is from the Times-Picayune as well.
[00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:20.068]  And amid Katrina chaos, congressmen used National Guard to visit his home and to check on his property and retrieve his family belongings.
[00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.313]  The detachment of National Guard helicopters, trucks, could have saved hundreds.
[00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:32.517]  But no, the congressman was too busy taking care of his junk.
[00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:41.407]  And FEMA has outsourced to a Bush crony company who's been involved in illegal dumping of bodies.
[00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.892]  So Bush now and his buddies making money off of the dead, of course.
[00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:49.854]  That's what they do.
[00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:56.039]  Bushes ought to stick a straw in our crowded arteries and suck the blood out that way.
[00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.702]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:00.182]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.772]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:07.593]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:12.596]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:19.661]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.003]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:25.045]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:29.790]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.414]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:41.860]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.542]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.702 --> 00:05:46.444]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:11.750]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:19.514]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.774 --> 00:06:22.895]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:28.878]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.198 --> 00:06:35.342]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:35.702 --> 00:06:39.605]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:41.546]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:47.670]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:52.173]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:06.205]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:13.447]  Look at this headline out of the Times of London today.
[00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:20.650]  Petrol panic begins to spread as oil prices rise.
[00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.851]  They're paying $8 a gallon now in England.
[00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:33.221]  To gas up a small economy-sized car that gets 45 miles to the gallon, people are paying the equivalent of $150.
[00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:43.488]  And Henry Kissinger earlier this year, about, what, six months ago, said, we're going to be paying $150 a barrel by next year.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:59.766]  Now, every prediction, every statement that's come out of his disgusting mouth at the Bilderberg Group, that our spies have been able to get a hold of, have come true.
[00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:01.887]  The fall of the Berlin Wall.
[00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:06.210]  No, we're not going to invade in 02, we're going to invade in March 03.
[00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.410]  Iraq.
[00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.032]  I mean, just everything keeps happening like clockwork.
[00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:16.856]  The predictions of Jim Tucker over and over again, via Henry Kissinger and other slime bags,
[00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:20.520]  Inside the Bilderberg Group, just keep coming true.
[00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:25.884]  And if fuel hits $150 a barrel, you'll be paying $8 a gallon here in this country.
[00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:34.229]  And by the way, why do they pay $8 in England, $6 in Germany, $5 a gallon in Japan?
[00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.431]  And why do we pay $3 a gallon here?
[00:09:38.132 --> 00:09:39.853]  Why is there that discrepancy?
[00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:41.214]  Why is there that difference?
[00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:43.996]  We'll discuss it.
[00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:44.776]  We'll go over it.
[00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:47.138]  Why do we pay on average triple
[00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:51.622]  What other industrialized nations pay for prescription drugs?
[00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:54.904]  Because these are cartels.
[00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:57.425]  This is not free market.
[00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:06.251]  The same people that own the drug companies own the prisons, own the military companies that supply the weapons systems, the defense contractors.
[00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:09.774]  It's an inside job, my friends.
[00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:11.455]  It's like it always is.
[00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:17.439]  By the way, I've never aired this song, and I... Every time I go on Coast to Coast AM,
[00:10:18.806 --> 00:10:26.371]  To talk about 9-11, or to talk about the New World Order, or to talk about the British government being involved in the bombings in England.
[00:10:27.172 --> 00:10:28.933]  Or when I went on to talk about the Madrid bombing.
[00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:36.278]  They play this inside job song by Don Henley.
[00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:38.400]  And I like Don Henley.
[00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:44.239]  I haven't really been paying much attention to music the last few years, so I wasn't really aware of this song.
[00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:50.622]  And I'd heard Coast to Coast AM play the Inside Job theme, but I had never heard the entire song.
[00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:59.928]  Well, some of our listeners took video clips from my documentaries and other documentaries and put them together under
[00:11:02.512 --> 00:11:13.296]  This is Don Henley's song, Inside Job, and so I had a chance this morning over at PrisonPlanet.com, where we've linked to the little video montage, to actually hear the whole song.
[00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:16.698]  And he's talking about the towers.
[00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:18.739]  He's talking about the people that brought down the towers.
[00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:20.899]  You know, they did it while we were sleeping.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.480]  They stole our freedoms.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.182]  They stole our right to stand up and speak and be heard.
[00:11:26.742 --> 00:11:30.283]  And they're going to do it over and over and over again until we stop them.
[00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:31.944]  So,
[00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:45.353]  There are so many big musical artists right now, whether they're hip-hop or rock and roll or Christian films, exposing government involvement in 9-11.
[00:11:45.393 --> 00:11:48.637]  But to have somebody of Don Henley's stature
[00:11:50.507 --> 00:11:54.850]  Clearly telling it like it is and not mincing words is amazing.
[00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.432]  And no wonder I haven't heard this on the radio.
[00:11:57.472 --> 00:11:58.633]  Now maybe you have.
[00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:03.437]  I don't listen to a lot of music on the radio because frankly I'm obsessed with my work.
[00:12:04.197 --> 00:12:08.461]  So I listen to talk radio to listen to what the other side, the neocons, are saying.
[00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:12.884]  But I occasionally do listen to music and I've never heard this song.
[00:12:13.224 --> 00:12:15.526]  Maybe it airs every five minutes and I've just been missing it.
[00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:20.299]  But here is Don Henley's inside job.
[00:12:21.421 --> 00:12:23.924]  And we'll come back and take some of your calls.
[00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:39.177]  I don't know.
[00:13:05.723 --> 00:13:07.123]  We're good to go.
[00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:38.270]  I don't think so.
[00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.133]  I don't know.
[00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:35.505]  We're good.
[00:14:57.138 --> 00:14:59.260]  I know what I've done wrong.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.362]  I am acquainted with the night.
[00:15:02.763 --> 00:15:08.107]  I know how hard it is to always walk out in the light.
[00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:14.071]  And it's an inside job to learn about forgiving.
[00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:20.096]  It's an inside job to hang on to the joy of living.
[00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:32.447]  I don't know.
[00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:48.937]  Alright folks, well that's Don Henley and Inside Job.
[00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:50.938]  Did you listen to those lyrics?
[00:16:52.358 --> 00:16:54.979]  They know your mother's maiden name.
[00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:56.820]  They know what you had for breakfast.
[00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:00.322]  It's an inside job.
[00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:03.483]  Chalk it up to business by the well-connected.
[00:17:04.187 --> 00:17:05.867]  I mean, on and on and on.
[00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:10.209]  It's an inside job, like it always is.
[00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:14.370]  Just an amazing, amazing song.
[00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.150]  And while we were sleeping, they did it!
[00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:26.313]  And, uh, clearly talking about this whole police state, this whole New World Order coming down on us.
[00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:30.454]  I mean, you'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:37.221]  Not to see the magnitude of the corruption and the tyranny that we're facing right now.
[00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:47.243]  Alright, there are just myriad reports on energy, huge new developments coming out on Katrina, Bush is taking responsibility but then making excuses.
[00:17:48.003 --> 00:17:51.504]  Okay, well, you know, I'm at fault, but here's why.
[00:17:52.184 --> 00:17:53.644]  By the way, Bush isn't at fault!
[00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:58.085]  Bush is falling on his sword for those above him!
[00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:01.798]  Just like Brown below him fell on his sword the day before.
[00:18:03.418 --> 00:18:12.640]  Because they can try to put perfume on a pig, they can try to dress it up and make excuses for what happened in New Orleans and surrounding areas of the Gulf Coast.
[00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.482]  This was an inside job and the people saw it for what it was this time.
[00:18:18.102 --> 00:18:18.742]  You've been caught.
[00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:20.222]  You've been caught gun confiscating.
[00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:22.823]  You've been caught blocking aid getting into those people.
[00:18:24.232 --> 00:18:29.521]  You've been caught running the whole scam, cutting police lines, jamming police communications.
[00:18:30.248 --> 00:18:32.549]  And they're hoping you just think it was a screw-up.
[00:18:32.969 --> 00:18:35.390]  They're hoping you just get mad at the government.
[00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.891]  They're hoping that you just only get one layer of the onion.
[00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:46.913]  They're hoping you just go down one layer of the rabbit hole and don't figure out that it was an inside job.
[00:18:47.273 --> 00:18:48.394]  It's like it always is.
[00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:53.915]  I mean, it's now hitting mainstream newspapers, the discussion of someone blowing up the levees.
[00:18:54.855 --> 00:18:56.116]  Bombing the levees.
[00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.797]  I'm bracing for it to be blamed on Al-Cieda
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.561]  Within the next few days, but just a ton of news and information coming up.
[00:19:05.961 --> 00:19:08.722]  We will take your calls, though, before I even get into the news.
[00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:12.742]  I want to kind of do this opposite of what we normally do.
[00:19:12.762 --> 00:19:14.023]  We'll go ahead and take some calls first.
[00:19:14.503 --> 00:19:16.863]  When we get back, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:16.883 --> 00:19:16.923]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:26.013 --> 00:19:28.734]  And I hope you'll visit the sites updated daily for you.
[00:19:29.055 --> 00:19:32.156]  Many times, multiple times daily with the most important news and information.
[00:19:32.697 --> 00:19:42.061]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PresidentPlanet.tv, and PresidentPlanet.com.
[00:19:42.502 --> 00:19:48.825]  A lot of the same news on all four of those sites, but a lot of different news and different information you won't see on some of the other sites.
[00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:52.047]  And some information you won't see anywhere but on our sites.
[00:19:52.607 --> 00:19:53.748]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:54.308]  Stay with us.
[00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:58.383]  Currency devaluation.
[00:19:58.483 --> 00:19:58.723]  Inflation.
[00:19:58.783 --> 00:19:59.324]  One and the same.
[00:19:59.404 --> 00:20:03.829]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:20:17.802 --> 00:20:20.923]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:20:21.183 --> 00:20:23.023]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:20:23.063 --> 00:20:26.524]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:20:26.784 --> 00:20:28.865]  Here is reality.
[00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:32.826]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:20:33.306 --> 00:20:36.967]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:40.088]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:45.416]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:00.603]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:00.923 --> 00:21:03.725]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:03.986 --> 00:21:08.129]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:09.410]  So what do you do?
[00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.274]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.896]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:21:58.115 --> 00:22:01.996]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:22:02.136 --> 00:22:03.877]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:05.217]  But not just any water.
[00:22:05.277 --> 00:22:09.499]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.

[00:22:58.985 --> 00:23:06.929]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.790]  What happened to those prices?
[00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.031]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[00:23:12.612 --> 00:23:18.595]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:19.595]  The result?
[00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:21.296]  Inflation was born.
[00:23:21.796 --> 00:23:23.857]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:26.721]  What can you do about it?
[00:23:27.162 --> 00:23:29.467]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:35.646]  Private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[00:23:36.087 --> 00:23:41.249]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:44.170]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.

[00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:04.302]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:04.802 --> 00:24:07.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:17.470]  Member of Parliament, number three in the Blair government resigned on the eve of the Iraq War, Michael Nietzsche, for a full hour interview.
[00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.272]  Had to twist his arm to get that, folks.
[00:24:21.352 --> 00:24:23.073]  They're used to five-minute interviews over there.
[00:24:23.934 --> 00:24:25.514]  Coming on in the next hour.
[00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:30.357]  Right now, let's go to Bruce in Colorado, then James, Peter, and others.
[00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:31.438]  Go ahead, Bruce.
[00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:33.146]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:33.706]  Hello.
[00:24:33.726 --> 00:24:43.889]  Well, I hear people calling in on your show about churches and how they're corrupted by government and New World Order dominance, and they always ask what to do and where to go.
[00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:56.453]  Now, I have a website, and I want to give that website out with some solutions to, you know, the various questions that people have about, you know, what to do about the churches and so on.
[00:24:57.362 --> 00:25:04.385]  We here in this land have been invaded from within and without, and Almighty Yahweh has withdrawn protection.
[00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:09.347]  So, this calls for prayer for the healing of our nation.
[00:25:10.908 --> 00:25:13.249]  But there are three good things that people could do.
[00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:14.790]  There's more than that on the website.
[00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.470]  Okay, well, tell us the three good things.
[00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:23.073]  Okay, this is only three of many, and I'm trying to be short, you know, make it a quick call here.
[00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:26.615]  One is make copies of Alex Jones' videos and give them out.
[00:25:28.038 --> 00:25:40.406]  Well, I don't know how Alex feels about this, but with a disclaimer, at the end of the video that you make a copy of, you might use a camcorder or something, and make a disclaimer and say, this is not part of Alex Jones' video.
[00:25:41.046 --> 00:25:43.087]  And you can get some spiritual information out.
[00:25:44.068 --> 00:25:44.948]  Perhaps a website.
[00:25:45.008 --> 00:25:48.050]  Oh, you're saying, you're saying ad stuff at the end of the film.
[00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.512]  Yeah, but make sure you say this is not part of Alex Jones' video.
[00:25:52.053 --> 00:25:52.633]  That's what I do.
[00:25:54.013 --> 00:25:56.214]  Make written copies of what's going on.
[00:25:56.274 --> 00:25:58.035]  Get the main news of what's going on.
[00:25:58.075 --> 00:25:59.896]  Like, for instance, New Orleans, etc.
[00:25:59.936 --> 00:26:01.437]  Put it on paper and distribute it.
[00:26:01.557 --> 00:26:09.700]  Actually, you can do it with your own printer if you have a computer or you can go to... Yeah, and millions of people doing that, it's just unbelievably powerful.
[00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:15.503]  Right, and on that paper, ask people who get it to make copies and give their copies of that out.
[00:26:15.923 --> 00:26:16.163]  Good.
[00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:21.426]  Alright, if that's number one, I guess number two is the... Number two and number three
[00:26:22.338 --> 00:26:25.080]  Come out from her, my people, Revelation 18.4.
[00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:34.747]  If you've got a problem with a church, if it's government controlled, which most of them are, and I've been running around looking for churches, just start your own group.
[00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:36.509]  Well, exactly!
[00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:39.911]  I mean, what stops you from having meetings at your house?
[00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:42.253]  Right, your house or the wilderness.
[00:26:43.694 --> 00:26:45.015]  You know, out in the mountains somewhere.
[00:26:46.617 --> 00:26:48.478]  It doesn't have to be your home, it could be anywhere.
[00:26:49.657 --> 00:26:51.298]  Someone's home, or your own home.
[00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:54.080]  Oh yeah, you can have weekend retreats out in the fresh air.
[00:26:55.001 --> 00:26:57.903]  Well you keep it up, Bruce, I appreciate you calling.
[00:26:57.923 --> 00:27:02.006]  Let me get this website out, because it's got more information on it.
[00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:05.269]  I sent you an email so you could look at this website beforehand.
[00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:06.750]  Oh, that's okay, go ahead.
[00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.774]  P as in Paul, S as in Sam, I as in India, council.com.
[00:27:11.814 --> 00:27:13.435]  That's psycouncil.com.
[00:27:13.515 --> 00:27:14.476]  P as in Paul,
[00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:16.956]  S's in Sam, I's in India.
[00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:18.377]  Council.com.
[00:27:18.397 --> 00:27:19.217]  Okay, thank you.
[00:27:19.377 --> 00:27:20.338]  Thank you for the call, brother.
[00:27:20.358 --> 00:27:21.218]  It's good to hear from you.
[00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:24.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Toronto, Canada.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.160]  James, go ahead.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.441]  Hey, Alex.
[00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:26.981]  Hi.
[00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:30.003]  Hey, I just wanted to call to let you know... You're on speakerphone, aren't you?
[00:27:30.603 --> 00:27:32.844]  No, I'm actually in... I was in my hallway.
[00:27:33.124 --> 00:27:33.624]  Okay, okay.
[00:27:33.744 --> 00:27:35.685]  It was echoing so bad I couldn't understand you.
[00:27:36.026 --> 00:27:36.286]  Sorry.
[00:27:37.006 --> 00:27:40.708]  I just wanted to call to tell you there's a guy, rap artist, Anubis,
[00:27:41.235 --> 00:27:47.881]  And this guy has a song called How Come with a sample from Martial Law, 9-11 rise of the police state in it.
[00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:50.763]  I didn't know that.
[00:27:50.823 --> 00:28:07.778]  I know that there are literally 30 or 40 songs and music I've been sent where people play clips of the films and I know that even, I mean I've been told by the folks that produce those Eminem videos that Eminem
[00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:12.816]  You know, he made several films that make allusions to government involvement.
[00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:21.702]  He made several videos that made mention of government involvement in 9-11, and that he primarily got that from my material.
[00:28:22.042 --> 00:28:30.488]  I mean, I'm flattered by that, but it just shows that individually, all of us can affect change, and that more and more people are getting on board every day.
[00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.749]  That's it.
[00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.231]  We're joining the revolution.
[00:28:36.055 --> 00:28:37.676]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:39.758]  And I wasn't trying to be rude, James.
[00:28:39.838 --> 00:28:43.161]  It's just when you're in an echoing room, it's really hard to understand you.
[00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.703]  Let's talk to Peter.
[00:28:45.944 --> 00:28:47.385]  Peter, where are you calling us from today?
[00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.567]  I'm calling from Missouri, Alex.
[00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:52.970]  Just wanted a comment on that fellow.
[00:28:53.010 --> 00:29:01.637]  I'm sure you saw him on the news, that lawyer, Ashton O'Dwyer, down there, who was telling the Feds where to get off.
[00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:16.753]  Yeah, Ashton DeWire, and I actually watched that clip and forgot to tell my webmasters to post it, and he's sitting there in this big million dollar house, local lawyer, and he says, look, if you cross this line, I'm going to kill you.
[00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:18.074]  I'm sick of this.
[00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:19.154]  This is my property.
[00:29:19.574 --> 00:29:20.614]  I'm not your slave.
[00:29:20.694 --> 00:29:21.814]  Don't try to kick me out.
[00:29:22.514 --> 00:29:23.595]  I'll tell you what, stay there, Peter.
[00:29:23.615 --> 00:29:31.456]  I'm going to let you comment on Ashton DeWire, New Orleans lawyer, there in his high and dry house, saying, look,
[00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:33.712]  I'm not your slave.
[00:29:34.412 --> 00:29:36.113]  Come to my house, wantin' my guns.
[00:29:36.514 --> 00:29:37.334]  I'm gonna kill ya.
[00:29:38.775 --> 00:29:41.957]  Alright, we'll be... We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:41.977 --> 00:29:42.498]  Stay with us.
[00:29:42.538 --> 00:29:44.799]  We'll let Peter and others continue.
[00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:46.000]  We'll also cover the news.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.621]  Michael Meacher's coming up.
[00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.042]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.502 --> 00:29:51.143]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:54.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.893]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:07.299]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:08.100]  Supreme Court.
[00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:13.185]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:30:13.205 --> 00:30:16.828]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:23.034]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:32.136]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:35.459]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:44.272]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:30:47.753 --> 00:30:48.333]  Call now.
[00:30:48.494 --> 00:30:55.056]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:58.234 --> 00:31:01.817]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:01.857 --> 00:31:02.357]  are located?
[00:31:02.557 --> 00:31:05.960]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.884]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:11.164 --> 00:31:16.168]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:22.450]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:34.734]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis,
[00:31:35.074 --> 00:31:35.594]  We're good to go.
[00:31:59.153 --> 00:32:04.460]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:10.068]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:32:10.508 --> 00:32:13.452]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:32:14.073 --> 00:32:14.533]  We're good to go.
[00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:42.028]  Send for your $19 subscription to The Nationalist Times, P.O.

[00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.790]  That's The Nationalist Times, P.O.

[00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:24.288]  Member of Parliament, Michael Meacher, coming up in the next hour to talk about a host of vital issues from 9-11 to the Iraq War and the lies that took us there.
[00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:28.518]  Peter, continue with the point you were making.
[00:33:28.538 --> 00:33:29.980]  Yeah, had Ashton decided to open fire
[00:33:45.836 --> 00:33:55.058]  He would have had a historical precedent on his side, and that would have been the Concord Bridge at Lexington, April 19th, 1775.
[00:33:55.539 --> 00:34:03.381]  Well, for those that didn't see the clip, and we don't have the clip here, though we should, why don't you describe for folks the video clip you saw?
[00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:08.662]  Well, I saw it on the news, and he was saying, essentially, hey, I'm okay.
[00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:11.022]  Just leave me alone.
[00:34:11.822 --> 00:34:13.563]  I don't need to be rescued.
[00:34:13.623 --> 00:34:15.044]  I don't want to be evacuated.
[00:34:15.084 --> 00:34:20.467]  This is my house, and I'm drawing the line right here on my property, and I'll shoot back.
[00:34:21.147 --> 00:34:30.512]  Unfortunately, either he lost his nerve, or maybe he decided that he would be better off living to fight another day.
[00:34:30.572 --> 00:34:36.034]  It would have cost him his life, but it would have been within the precedent set by the American Revolution.
[00:34:36.054 --> 00:34:37.255]  Well, what happened to him?
[00:34:38.552 --> 00:34:39.674]  He was arrested.
[00:34:39.714 --> 00:34:43.340]  They probably sent in a high-tech goon squad.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.685]  They did mention the fact that he was arrested.
[00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:47.590]  And he didn't get any shots off.
[00:34:48.111 --> 00:34:54.576]  So, uh, you know, they... So basically, he got up there and made these statements, and then they said, well, we're not going to put up with that.
[00:34:54.596 --> 00:35:10.448]  But notice, while they're attacking, while the gun confiscation is continuing, all over New Orleans, the middle class areas and working class areas, rich areas, areas that weren't even, you know, deluged, areas that never had water in them, areas that are 100%, still,
[00:35:13.627 --> 00:35:15.688]  They're going in and confiscating the guns.
[00:35:16.068 --> 00:35:18.510]  Meanwhile, they say, okay, we're not doing that now.
[00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.151]  That's to neutralize opposition.
[00:35:22.072 --> 00:35:24.093]  And this is just so despicable.
[00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:28.076]  Well, they want everybody out of there, and that brings me up to my next point.
[00:35:28.136 --> 00:35:28.796]  Years back,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.264]  I remember I saw a map of how the U.N.
[00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:35.606]  was planning to carve up this country.
[00:35:35.626 --> 00:35:38.569]  Yeah, that's in my video, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:45.075]  Do you remember if New Orleans was even on that map, or is that bye-bye into some wilderness area?
[00:35:46.216 --> 00:35:51.041]  Most of Louisiana is a wilderness area, no human activity allowed.
[00:35:51.702 --> 00:35:52.943]  What about New Orleans?
[00:35:53.703 --> 00:35:54.163]  You remember?
[00:35:54.443 --> 00:35:57.665]  I don't have the map in front of me, but no, I believe that's a human zone.
[00:35:57.985 --> 00:35:58.125]  Oh.
[00:35:58.625 --> 00:35:59.106]  Okay.
[00:35:59.126 --> 00:36:02.007]  Maybe they just want it for redevelopment then.
[00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:02.507]  Okay.
[00:36:02.707 --> 00:36:03.448]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:03.508 --> 00:36:04.208]  Good points, Peter.
[00:36:04.628 --> 00:36:08.450]  By the way, we take National Geographic.
[00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:16.674]  My now-dead grandfather gave it as a Christmas present every year, and I guess the subscription is continued by my lovely grandmother.
[00:36:18.012 --> 00:36:19.493]  Why did I just tell that story?
[00:36:19.934 --> 00:36:21.835]  There's no reason to give that background.
[00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:24.077]  But see, that's how my weird brain works.
[00:36:24.137 --> 00:36:39.710]  I thought of National Geographic, and I thought then to describe why I take the dehumanizing anti-freedom publication, and then it popped in my head that
[00:36:43.596 --> 00:36:45.797]  Oh, my grandfather gave me that publication.
[00:36:46.397 --> 00:36:47.357]  Not that he was bad.
[00:36:47.398 --> 00:36:48.758]  See, now we're down another rabbit trail.
[00:36:48.778 --> 00:36:51.459]  But just because, I mean, obviously, it's a nice magazine.
[00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:53.400]  Lots of big color photos.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.261]  Very popular, I guess, back during his day.
[00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:57.441]  Still popular.
[00:36:58.142 --> 00:37:00.623]  Now I certainly am running around in rabbit trails.
[00:37:01.423 --> 00:37:09.826]  But regardless, the caller brings up these wilderness areas and these UN biospheres and all of this Agenda 21 world government business.
[00:37:13.576 --> 00:37:31.686]  A few years ago, I was reading National Geographic, and they showed armed troops from somewhere in Asia, I forget where now, armed troops guarding thousands and thousands of acres from, quote, human encroachment.
[00:37:32.587 --> 00:37:39.811]  And it said that they shoot any humans that come into the area foraging for food or anything else.
[00:37:40.399 --> 00:37:45.222]  And the argument is, well, they're guarding this incredibly vital environment.
[00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.925]  They're guarding the environment from poachers.
[00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:57.311]  Well, major independent studies show that the poachers tend to be the guards, because they've got the trucks, they can get in and out, they've got the guns.
[00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.232]  Point is, you're not going to stop it.
[00:37:59.752 --> 00:38:02.274]  But this is what we're going to see in America.
[00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:05.196]  In fact, they've already taken parks in Austin.
[00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:16.764]  Where you could go and they just put signs up saying no human activity, no humans allowed, environmental area under regrowth and repair.
[00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:20.090]  And so it's just feudalism.
[00:38:20.945 --> 00:38:30.130]  If you go look at the encyclopedia at the definition of, and the description of feudalism, it's where the elite keeps you on tiny plots of land.
[00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:34.253]  It's always for the environment, always to keep the forest or the fields up.
[00:38:34.693 --> 00:38:37.315]  Why the horrible rabble just destroy it.
[00:38:37.875 --> 00:38:39.576]  Look at what they do with the commons.
[00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:45.679]  That's what they call parks in the feudal era.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.142]  And that's all we're going to live under today, is neo-feudalism.
[00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:54.072]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:38:55.153 --> 00:38:58.717]  Let's talk to John in Canada.
[00:38:58.777 --> 00:38:59.698]  John, you're on the air.
[00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:02.641]  Alex.
[00:39:03.122 --> 00:39:03.402]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:04.103 --> 00:39:12.132]  Yeah, you know, it's one thing for you to encourage your listeners not to hold George Bush accountable for his personal decisions that he makes as an individual.
[00:39:12.757 --> 00:39:21.200]  It's another thing to do as you did yesterday, which was lie about my circumstance and the political state of reality here in Canada.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.301]  We have a better system.
[00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:30.644]  Honorable police officers feel it's not right to put an innocent man in prison without trial.
[00:39:31.704 --> 00:39:33.565]  You know, without any legal recourse.
[00:39:34.225 --> 00:39:37.026]  And that was the intent of your demon leader there.
[00:39:37.466 --> 00:39:41.067]  Now our legal system, and it hasn't been two years, it's been four.
[00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:42.328]  But there are
[00:39:42.879 --> 00:39:55.390]  Forces in this world who are working to have me incarcerated in probably a Guantanamo type situation just because I air the facts as they stand irrespective of anybody's opinion.
[00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:57.352]  It doesn't matter what my name is.
[00:39:57.933 --> 00:39:59.274]  It's the FBI's position.
[00:39:59.887 --> 00:40:12.457]  It's American soldiers' demand by firepower to defend those officers and to demand the immediate arrest of those we know who participated in the terrorist act of 9-11.
[00:40:12.497 --> 00:40:18.082]  Alright, I'm going to put you on hold because I hear the growling in your voice, John.
[00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:27.570]  John calls in every few months and he basically, I could have a tape recording of it, he repeats the exact same words.
[00:40:28.757 --> 00:40:53.591]  And he talks about his case three and a half years ago, whatever, where he gets on the radio and talks about General Amoud Ahmed, the head of Pakistani intelligence, who wired $100,000 to Mohammed Hanna, and who for the week before 9-11, the second trip in his life to the U.S., was meeting with the heads of the CIA and the FBI and at the White House, and on the morning of 9-11, he was having breakfast
[00:40:54.615 --> 00:41:04.440]  With Porter Goss and Senator Graham, Bob Graham of Florida, and the staffer walks in and says the towers have been attacked and they say, we know.
[00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:06.882]  I mean, that's a big news story.
[00:41:07.562 --> 00:41:19.829]  And then he calls in and he says, I reported on this, I talked about the news articles, and I talked about MSNBC, which is a real article, it's in my films, about 9-11,
[00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:30.009]  And I talked about MSNBC where Bush had the launch orders to attack Afghanistan on his desk two days before 9-11 and our troops were massing.
[00:41:30.669 --> 00:41:35.851]  And so I say, okay sir, tell us your name, tell us about your case so we can try to help you.
[00:41:37.012 --> 00:41:38.492]  And he says, no, I'm not going to tell you my name.
[00:41:38.512 --> 00:41:41.614]  And then he calls back a few months later and tells the same story.
[00:41:43.094 --> 00:41:46.476]  And then I just talked about Canada where if you say that 5,999,000 Jews died
[00:41:51.627 --> 00:41:54.108]  You were arrested and will spend decades in prison.
[00:41:55.289 --> 00:41:56.229]  They have the hate laws.
[00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:01.552]  David Icke lands saying space aliens control everything and they say that's code.
[00:42:01.932 --> 00:42:02.493]  Which it's not.
[00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:04.014]  David Icke really thinks it's space aliens.
[00:42:04.494 --> 00:42:14.299]  But if we're talking about UFOs, they came and detained him and wouldn't let him go give speeches and then people harassed him and pied him and radio stations cancelled interviews with him.
[00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.500]  I mean, that's how crazy it is, folks.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.042]  Even people that believe UFOs are in control of things can't go to Canada.
[00:42:21.357 --> 00:42:30.662]  And there's just been hundreds of articles, so it's kind of a... You got your liberal jackboot, you got your neocon jackboot, and the caller goes, that criminal George Bush!
[00:42:31.242 --> 00:42:33.103]  You know, he's doing it all!
[00:42:33.243 --> 00:42:35.184]  And that's a disservice, folks.
[00:42:35.244 --> 00:42:36.085]  It's a disservice.
[00:42:36.745 --> 00:42:42.188]  The last two years of Bill Clinton's administration, I said, he's a puppet, he's nothing.
[00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:48.731]  They're going to put Bush in, and then he's going to continue the agenda, and conservatives aren't going to care.
[00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:57.435]  Just like Bush will leave office and they'll put a Democrat in and suddenly the Democrats aren't going to care about checkpoints and FEMA camps and secret arrest.
[00:43:00.156 --> 00:43:01.958]  So it's just the same thing.
[00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.920]  And Canada is very draconian.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.882]  Canada did register the guns and now they're banning them.
[00:43:10.684 --> 00:43:14.827]  Canada does viciously raid gun owners' homes and put false charges on them.
[00:43:14.847 --> 00:43:15.927]  Let me tell you about Canada.
[00:43:16.087 --> 00:43:16.908]  Let me tell you about Canada.
[00:43:18.311 --> 00:43:19.771]  I can ship my videos.
[00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:22.692]  We get orders from Communist China.
[00:43:23.492 --> 00:43:24.212]  No problem.
[00:43:24.512 --> 00:43:25.433]  Videos go in.
[00:43:26.113 --> 00:43:29.774]  We get orders from Australia with all its police state.
[00:43:29.894 --> 00:43:30.794]  Orders go right in.
[00:43:31.174 --> 00:43:33.074]  We get video orders from Spain.
[00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:34.075]  Videos go right in.
[00:43:34.395 --> 00:43:36.335]  We get video orders from Germany, Russia.
[00:43:36.575 --> 00:43:37.355]  They go right in.
[00:43:37.495 --> 00:43:38.576]  Mexico, right in.
[00:43:38.796 --> 00:43:39.956]  Venezuela, right in.
[00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:52.171]  Guess where half our videos get stopped and smashed and mailed back to us, or we actually get letters back saying this is deemed to be terrorist propaganda.
[00:43:52.211 --> 00:44:02.837]  I mean, I have gotten the customs forms back with confiscated videos, or without the videos, or with broken videos, or with the package.
[00:44:03.097 --> 00:44:04.558]  They will send the package back.
[00:44:05.279 --> 00:44:06.139]  It's a big joke.
[00:44:06.999 --> 00:44:09.641]  To the point of, I almost don't ship videos to Canada.
[00:44:10.702 --> 00:44:13.004]  We may have to ship them two or three times to get them there.
[00:44:15.526 --> 00:44:20.870]  And we've done experiments before and stuck the videos in unlabeled packages and sent them from other addresses.
[00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.552]  Zero problems.
[00:44:23.592 --> 00:44:24.053]  Zero.
[00:44:24.893 --> 00:44:29.157]  So don't tell me your country is an assess pool of police state.
[00:44:29.517 --> 00:44:30.458]  John, go ahead.
[00:44:30.898 --> 00:44:32.299]  Hey, well, gee, there's a lot of points there.
[00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:33.080]  Okay, first of all,
[00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:37.114]  You're the one who encouraged me the other day to get angry, so I'm just taking your advice.
[00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.657]  Two, don't give up on Canada.
[00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:43.247]  But the primary thing about you saying, just like Clinton and on and on and on...
[00:44:43.743 --> 00:44:45.304]  You, well, you're a good guy.
[00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:46.966]  Don't get me wrong here, okay?
[00:44:47.486 --> 00:44:55.793]  The main point I'm getting at is all of America, American men, will not stand up as men to say Bush said Saddam didn't let the inspectors in.
[00:44:55.873 --> 00:44:56.694]  That was a lie.
[00:44:56.714 --> 00:44:58.736]  He took us to war and killed ourselves.
[00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:01.999]  Well, I mean... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:45:02.039 --> 00:45:04.881]  Now he says he never said there were WMDs.
[00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:05.682]  Well, yeah, okay.
[00:45:05.742 --> 00:45:11.347]  But, okay, just so... But the primary discussion that's missing in America today
[00:45:11.827 --> 00:45:13.748]  Is that the Iraq War has no cause.
[00:45:13.968 --> 00:45:21.352]  You had complete, unrestricted access to do anything Bush pleased without delay prior to the conflict beginning.
[00:45:21.712 --> 00:45:28.416]  So every act of murder is taking you further down a road of death and destruction that provides no better good.
[00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:29.777]  Well I agree.
[00:45:29.817 --> 00:45:33.719]  John, John, John, John, I'll say this and I appreciate your call.
[00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:36.180]  You can call back in a few days and have some more time.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.662]  I gotta be fair to the other callers and got news to cover and a guest coming up.
[00:45:39.682 --> 00:45:40.042]  But look,
[00:45:41.744 --> 00:46:01.399]  When I got up here and said that Bush has fallen on his sword and taken responsibility for the hurricane, when I make the statement that he too was a puppet, just like the head of FEMA Brown was, I'm not absolving Bush of guilt.
[00:46:01.439 --> 00:46:02.920]  I'm not saying he's not guilty.
[00:46:03.741 --> 00:46:11.627]  I mean, when the police bust a major murder gang, the low-level people go to jail just as much as the high-level ones.
[00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:14.899]  And obviously, Bush is high-level, but he's still a puppet.
[00:46:15.279 --> 00:46:19.860]  He's a high-level functionary, a high-level puppet or figurehead.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:29.182]  And so, Bush falling on his sword is just like Brown doing it.
[00:46:29.522 --> 00:46:32.543]  And Brown didn't really apologize, and Bush didn't really apologize.
[00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:39.445]  He said, well, you know, in the final equation, things could have been better, and I'm the boss, so that's my fault.
[00:46:40.453 --> 00:46:43.094]  But, you know, we did a pretty darn good job, blah blah blah.
[00:46:44.754 --> 00:46:53.856]  I mean, that is a desperate attempt to just shut blame away from this criminal system itself.
[00:46:56.256 --> 00:47:09.219]  Alright, this next clip, this clip is an AP video report concerning FEMA drills and FEMA studies
[00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:12.711]  That had been done, where 60,000 people die.
[00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:17.615]  If a Category 3 hurricane hit the New Orleans coastline.
[00:47:19.056 --> 00:47:22.658]  Also, there was another FEMA study where 500,000 died.
[00:47:23.059 --> 00:47:26.721]  That was in the Houston Chronicle during hurricane season last year.
[00:47:28.703 --> 00:47:31.325]  And so they knew this, and they did not build up the levees.
[00:47:31.345 --> 00:47:33.206]  They did not expand them.
[00:47:33.226 --> 00:47:34.267]  They did not repair them.
[00:47:34.327 --> 00:47:35.308]  That's part of the record.
[00:47:35.788 --> 00:47:37.169]  So here is this short report.
[00:47:37.907 --> 00:47:39.148]  And then we'll get into some other news.
[00:47:39.288 --> 00:47:40.048]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:47:41.428 --> 00:47:45.090]  Nobody knows exactly how many have died because of Hurricane Katrina.
[00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.591]  As of Friday, the five-state death toll was 337.
[00:47:49.492 --> 00:47:55.994]  Officials expect that number to soar as toxic water drains from New Orleans, revealing submerged corpses.
[00:47:56.514 --> 00:48:00.156]  But what about an estimate of 61,290 people?
[00:48:00.536 --> 00:48:05.218]  That's the number of dead projected by a chilling government simulation called Hurricane Pam.
[00:48:05.962 --> 00:48:12.951]  The year-long project on the fictitious storm was meant to prepare federal and state officials for a Category 3 hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast.
[00:48:13.607 --> 00:48:22.349]  Completed just days before the Category 4 Hurricane Katrina, the 412-page report eerily foresaw the devastation and the aftermath.
[00:48:22.789 --> 00:48:34.611]  The Associated Press obtained a copy of the plan, which predicted 10 feet of flooding in New Orleans, a catastrophic mass evacuation, and more than 60,000 dead, nearly 400,000 injured or ill, and 500,000 people homeless.
[00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:35.671]  The report also anticipated
[00:48:40.852 --> 00:48:44.753]  All 40 medical facilities in the area would be isolated and useless.
[00:48:45.173 --> 00:48:53.236]  Local officials would be quickly overwhelmed with the casualties, and large sections of Louisiana would be left uninhabitable for more than a year.
[00:48:53.656 --> 00:49:02.499]  Under the direction of FEMA, federal and state officials began working on the Hurricane Pam project in July 2004, and reported their initial findings last December.
[00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:08.843]  FEMA Director Michael Brown said a lack of money prohibited his agency from following up on the report before Katrina.
[00:49:09.144 --> 00:49:13.667]  But officials in New Orleans say they are now implementing some of the things they learned from the process.
[00:49:13.967 --> 00:49:26.035]  We have practiced with the Hurricane Pam scenario that they asked us to work with and over the past two years all the officials in Louisiana and Mississippi have used that as a model.
[00:49:26.376 --> 00:49:29.598]  Hurricane Pam planners got a lot right in their predictions.
[00:49:30.499 --> 00:49:32.380]  They hope they're wrong about the death toll.
[00:49:33.436 --> 00:49:33.856]  Steve Knight.
[00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:38.199]  Alright, so that's the clip and it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.302]  But the moral of this story is FEMA did know.
[00:49:43.003 --> 00:49:47.406]  They had reports in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004.
[00:49:47.686 --> 00:49:52.829]  A completion of a report started two years ago, just a few months ago.
[00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:58.733]  So they've had a whole bunch of different detailed analysis that have shown this.
[00:49:59.013 --> 00:49:59.574]  And they knew.
[00:50:01.475 --> 00:50:02.536]  And they have spent
[00:50:03.203 --> 00:50:11.925]  Now, almost four hundred million dollars in the invasion and the two plus years of occupation of Iraq.
[00:50:13.005 --> 00:50:18.446]  And it would have cost just a few billion dollars to secure the city of New Orleans.
[00:50:18.706 --> 00:50:19.506]  Totally secure.
[00:50:20.866 --> 00:50:23.827]  And now it's very suspicious why those dikes did fail.
[00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.067]  Why those levees did fail.
[00:50:26.047 --> 00:50:28.767]  And we'll get into some of those reports later after Michael Meacher leaves us.
[00:50:29.308 --> 00:50:31.328]  We'll try to jam a few calls in on the other side of this break.
[00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:39.455]  Hit a few news items concerning the hurricane, but... See, even when the government screws up, they're going to get more funds, more police state control.
[00:50:39.935 --> 00:50:42.017]  So it looks like on the surface they're getting the black eye.
[00:50:42.097 --> 00:50:43.198]  Oh no, they're going to town!
[00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:54.127]  This is a police state implementation, shopping spree, hay day bonanza, as they make hay while the police state sun shines.
[00:50:54.908 --> 00:50:55.989]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.953 --> 00:51:04.780]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.482]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:06.682 --> 00:51:08.884]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:11.126]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:11.407 --> 00:51:16.332]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.

[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.480]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:34.777]  I think so.
[00:54:05.805 --> 00:54:13.588]  Well, FEMA requested only 455 buses to rescue 2,000 people, then they cancelled the order.
[00:54:13.608 --> 00:54:27.253]  The Wall Street Journal is reporting, and as bodies are recovered, despite the order of a federal judge, the black ski mask police are still telling reporters, no photos, no stories.
[00:54:29.193 --> 00:54:30.974]  All part of living in the new free society.
[00:54:31.494 --> 00:54:33.975]  And we've dug up the Times-Picayune report,
[00:54:35.342 --> 00:54:40.908]  From February 11, 2003, where the city was officially federalized.
[00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:49.536]  So if there's any questions of this being federal, state, or local, those questions are over.

[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:59.266]  Now, before I get more into this news and your calls, and of course Michael Meacher coming up in the next hour, a member of the British Parliament,

[00:56:45.852 --> 00:56:49.855]  And on top of it, there's my weekly TV reports that are pretty good.
[00:56:50.715 --> 00:56:53.537]  So, $0.15 a day, PrisonPlanet.TV.

[00:56:58.675 --> 00:57:04.740]  FEMA requested only 455 buses to rescue 20,000 people, then canceled the order altogether.
[00:57:06.321 --> 00:57:24.455]  As the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency stepped down yesterday, government documents surfaced showing that vital resources, such as buses and environmental health specialists, weren't deployed to the Gulf region for several days, even after federal officials seized control of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.
[00:57:25.894 --> 00:57:26.995]  They were always in control.
[00:57:27.455 --> 00:57:45.868]  In addition, FEMA's official request, known as Tasking Assignments, and used by the Agency to Demand Help from other government agencies, Demand, you notice, showed that it first asked the Department of Transportation to look for buses to help evacuate the more than 20,000 people who had taken refuge in the Superdome.
[00:57:47.189 --> 00:57:50.551]  But then, within hours, that request was cancelled.
[00:57:53.439 --> 00:57:58.280]  That's because good people in FEMA tried to do the right thing and they got told, no, you didn't get the memo, don't do that.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:06.681]  FEMA folks cut communications lines, cut police lines, blocked aid, blocked the police bringing in food and water.
[00:58:07.662 --> 00:58:12.562]  This was all done by design because if they have a horrible spectacle, they'll get more funds.
[00:58:14.243 --> 00:58:18.344]  This is another example of catching them red-handed.
[00:58:20.224 --> 00:58:20.804]  Red-handed.
[00:58:22.651 --> 00:58:27.234]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour with Michael Meacher.
[00:58:27.274 --> 00:58:29.316]  We're really excited to have on with us.
[00:58:29.456 --> 00:58:33.799]  And of course, your phone calls and a ton of news from around the world.

[00:58:55.255 --> 00:58:56.335]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:57.036 --> 00:58:58.156]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.797 --> 00:58:59.617]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.358 --> 00:59:01.358]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:05.921]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.121 --> 00:59:10.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:10.423 --> 00:59:11.404]  It's well known
[00:59:22.668 --> 00:59:26.311]  That I don't gush over guests.
[00:59:27.692 --> 00:59:41.403]  But I gotta tell ya, being over in England a month and a half ago covering the tragic London bombings, I had a chance to interview a former MI5 agent, and of course his partner, David Shaler.
[00:59:42.644 --> 00:59:47.068]  And I had a chance to interview, you know, hundreds of Londoners on the street.
[00:59:48.189 --> 00:59:49.450]  But getting to go to the home
[00:59:50.709 --> 00:59:59.773]  of Member of Parliament Michael Meacher, who was a member of the Blair Cabinet, and who resigned on the eve of the Second Gulf War in 1993.
[01:00:00.153 --> 01:00:03.795]  He was just such a gentleman, and it was an amazing interview.
[01:00:04.195 --> 01:00:16.921]  Because it was so important, we put excerpts of it on the website, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and that's going to be in an upcoming documentary that we're going to be airing in different areas of the United States.
[01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:20.002]  But we are joined by Michael Meacher,
[01:00:20.786 --> 01:00:22.706]  I'm very pleased indeed to be with you.
[01:00:44.517 --> 01:00:46.138]  What is near and dear to your heart?
[01:00:46.198 --> 01:00:51.600]  What do you think the most important thing currently happening is that we should discuss?
[01:00:53.921 --> 01:01:05.005]  I think the consequences of 9-11 continue to resonate across the world and for those of us who believe that the attack on Iraq
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:34.999]  Was done, it was unprovoked, it was illegal, and it was done on the back of 9-11, on the grounds that there was a connection between 9-11 and Iraq, which there certainly is not, never been proven, and in view of what has happened in Iraq ever since, the geopolitical effects of this, of course a massive impact in Britain as well, much talk about whether it could affect the tenure of Prime Minister Blair,
[01:01:35.772 --> 01:01:36.252]  I don't know.
[01:01:47.372 --> 01:01:48.233]  Climate change.
[01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:50.834]  I mean, these are massive issues.
[01:01:51.855 --> 01:02:01.681]  And I am one of those who believe passionately that we need a very different kind of world order, other than the one which has been put forward by Western leaders at the present time.
[01:02:01.881 --> 01:02:07.605]  And I think the way events are shaping are increasingly pushing the world in that direction.
[01:02:09.099 --> 01:02:16.527]  When you talk about a world order, Bush and his neocon cronies and his corporate controllers, they want a new world order.
[01:02:16.547 --> 01:02:21.953]  And then you have people in the EU and others that talk about another type of world order.
[01:02:23.045 --> 01:02:28.528]  And of course, later we can debate whether the same individuals control both of those world orders.
[01:02:28.608 --> 01:02:32.751]  But in a nutshell, what is the world order that George Bush wants?
[01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:38.994]  Well, I think the world order that he is seeking has been made very clear.
[01:02:39.194 --> 01:02:44.037]  It is in the document called Project for the New America Century.
[01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:54.561]  Which was published in the September 2000 presidential election that brought President Bush into office.
[01:02:54.922 --> 01:03:04.286]  It was supported by, of course, all the leading neocons, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Jeb Bush, Louis Libby, and all the others.
[01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:11.529]  Now what it says, very clearly, and this is their sort of manifesto, I think, for the Bush presidency,
[01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:26.239]  It refers to the fact that the US must discourage advanced industrial nations, for that I presume one means Japan and the EU, from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:33.307]  Uh, it says even, and this is very significant, even should Saddam pass from the scene, U.S.
[01:03:33.407 --> 01:03:37.571]  bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain permanently.
[01:03:38.112 --> 01:03:42.176]  And this is the reason given, because Iran may well prove to be a larger threat to U.S.
[01:03:42.257 --> 01:03:43.177]  interests than Iraq.
[01:03:43.198 --> 01:03:45.920]  Michael Meacher, stay right there, we've got a break, we'll be right back.
[01:03:50.737 --> 01:03:53.600]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.421]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.782 --> 01:04:00.466]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:00.786 --> 01:04:05.250]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:09.814]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:12.876]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:12.976 --> 01:04:17.639]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:17.839 --> 01:04:22.283]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:29.708]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:29.968 --> 01:04:32.390]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:58.598]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:04:58.798 --> 01:05:10.068]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:10.308 --> 01:05:12.950]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:17.394]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:05:17.594 --> 01:05:19.756]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:19.896 --> 01:05:21.778]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:21.978 --> 01:05:27.983]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:28.243 --> 01:05:33.888]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.763]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:53.003 --> 01:05:56.846]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:57.167 --> 01:05:57.968]  Read the labels.
[01:05:58.408 --> 01:06:02.532]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:02.752 --> 01:06:06.936]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:07.316 --> 01:06:12.201]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:12.561 --> 01:06:16.164]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:16.344 --> 01:06:21.688]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:24.690]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.891]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:49.444 --> 01:06:54.486]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:54.846 --> 01:06:57.107]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:08.215 --> 01:07:31.928]  Alright, for stations that just joined us, Michael Meacher was a senior member of Blair's cabinet, his environment minister, and I had a chance to sit down with Michael Meacher for about an hour in a video interview I did for a documentary I'm making when I was in England just a few months ago.
[01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:40.552]  But we are extremely honored to have him here on air with us today to talk about a whole host of issues.
[01:07:40.572 --> 01:07:57.337]  You know, he wrote an article a couple years ago for the London Guardian, The War on Terror is Bogus, where he went over the PNAC plans, and where he talked about General Amoud Ahmed meeting with the heads of intelligence, and basically all the suspicious goings-on that developed there.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:11.287]  But of course he's better known for resigning from the Blair government on the eve of the invasion of Iraq simply because on its face it was a manifestly illegal war.
[01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:24.695]  Now in hindsight we know just how incredibly illegal it was and how intelligence was manufactured at the White House, at the Pentagon, at 10 Downing Street,
[01:08:25.496 --> 01:08:34.089]  And even Colin Powell has had to apologize and said that his speech at the United Nations is a black mark on his record.
[01:08:34.469 --> 01:08:41.680]  And I agree with George Galloway, who we had on last Friday, also a Member of Parliament, when he said it's a big, bloody mark.
[01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:43.887]  It is not a black mark.
[01:08:44.267 --> 01:08:48.989]  And so for the next 15 minutes, roughly, we are joined by Michael Meacher.
[01:08:49.929 --> 01:09:00.053]  Michael, if we can, let's go back to the eve of the Gulf War, why you gave up this incredibly powerful position with all of the esteem that came with it.
[01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:04.357]  To resign out of Blair's government.
[01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:05.457]  Why did you do that?
[01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:09.681]  And now, you may think that the public all knows the tales of the Iraq War.
[01:09:10.162 --> 01:09:17.028]  A lot of them don't, especially from your unique position from the Catbird seat in British government.
[01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:30.242]  You know, give us the climate that caused you to resign, and then, in hindsight, your comments on Iraq, and now, where you see us going in the future with Iran and Syria.
[01:09:30.262 --> 01:09:32.245]  You know, the neocons aren't done yet.
[01:09:32.985 --> 01:09:42.068]  Well, first of all, the war started on, I think, the 19th of March 2003, as you said, just over two years ago.
[01:09:42.168 --> 01:09:47.490]  We did not have any debate in the British Parliament until, I think, the night before.
[01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:54.453]  There had been enormous resistance building up in the Labour Party, the governing party in Britain.
[01:09:55.053 --> 01:09:57.734]  There had been demands for an explanation, there had been
[01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:14.461]  Continuous demands to Tony Blair as the Prime Minister at question time in Parliament every Wednesday to explain whether a decision had been taken, why we were going to war when there wasn't a second resolution in the UN which justified it.
[01:10:14.801 --> 01:10:17.362]  The lawyers were clearly very dubious about it.
[01:10:18.223 --> 01:10:26.126]  We now know that the Foreign Office senior lawyers have later resigned on the grounds that they believe that there was not the justification.
[01:10:26.566 --> 01:10:27.547]  Now on the day
[01:10:28.688 --> 01:10:35.630]  Of the actual debate, just before war started, 139 Labour MPs voted against a three-line whip.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:44.652]  A three-line whip is a requirement laid down by the leaders of the party that you have to obey the vote and support the government.
[01:10:45.012 --> 01:10:46.873]  So this was an enormous revolt.
[01:10:47.917 --> 01:11:06.677]  And, of course, there were several people from the government who resigned, but there was a huge number of people in the Parliamentary Labour Party, well over a third, who believed that this was a wrongful war, that it was unprovoked and it was illegal, and it was in those circumstances that many of us acted.
[01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:11.245]  And have you been vindicated?
[01:11:12.046 --> 01:11:19.794]  Well, I think we have been totally vindicated to a degree to which at that time I think most of us were not aware.
[01:11:20.887 --> 01:11:40.059]  I have to say, and I'll be honest about this, I believed what was said by the US and the UK government about weapons of mass destruction at that time, when of course we now know that neither the US government nor the UK government actually believed at that time what they were saying.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:48.864]  We know that Richard Perle, one of the neocons, has let the cat out of the bag by saying that, of course, it never was about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:11:49.224 --> 01:11:50.864]  The US government never believed this.
[01:11:51.445 --> 01:12:04.930]  And in the case of the UK, we know that MI5, which is our secret intelligence agency, was warning the Prime Minister that the evidence on which he was basing his case was weak and fragmentary.
[01:12:07.109 --> 01:12:15.937]  The civil servants and the scientists who were most knowledgeable in the area were very uncertain as to what weaponry Saddam Hussein had.
[01:12:17.321 --> 01:12:30.490]  And indeed MI6 was warning the Prime Minister that to go to war, if one was worried about terror in the world, it would actually increase the prospects of Islamic terror rather than reduce it.
[01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:36.694]  Now this is what they were being told privately and secretly, but that's not what they were saying publicly.
[01:12:37.034 --> 01:12:40.216]  And I think we have been totally and utterly vindicated.
[01:12:40.576 --> 01:12:44.319]  I think Iraq has turned out to be a complete disaster.
[01:12:45.055 --> 01:12:50.096]  I think it's going to be incredibly difficult to get out of it, but I think this is an unwinnable war.
[01:12:50.256 --> 01:13:10.701]  I think the insurgency is probably actually steadily increasing, and I think in the end there is going to have to be a withdrawal, but I hope that is on the basis of a government which is able to keep some law and order within the country, but given the divisions between the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds,
[01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:21.025]  And the way enormous efforts are being made by the American authorities to bring them together, and of course I support those efforts, but they are clearly, up to now, wholly unsuccessful.
[01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:36.488]  And I think it has unleashed an attitude amongst the Muslim population around the world, and many of the Arab countries, which has severely damaged the image of America and of Britain.
[01:13:37.469 --> 01:13:38.909]  I think we need to be very careful
[01:13:39.933 --> 01:13:44.394]  About saying exactly what lay behind the Madrid bombings or the London bombings.
[01:13:45.435 --> 01:13:58.819]  I think it's very facile to say it was for this reason or that, but I don't think there is any doubt at all that the slaughter in Iraq and the television pictures and all the newscasts that we've heard in this country and Europe
[01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:05.167]  Undoubtedly we're one of the factors, and perhaps a key factor, which lay behind the bombings.
[01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:12.676]  It is terrible that this has happened, but of course the real problem is there is not necessarily any end of it.
[01:14:13.456 --> 01:14:18.482]  Whether I trust God there are going to be no further bombings in the UK, but of course none of us knows.
[01:14:18.862 --> 01:14:21.165]  And exactly the same must be true in the US.
[01:14:22.794 --> 01:14:29.238]  Again, we're talking to Michael Meacher, who was at the highest levels of the Blair government and resigned on the eve of the war.
[01:14:31.439 --> 01:14:40.445]  Michael, is it fair to say that you and the third of the Labor Party, and even some conservatives and Tories who were against it, were against it because Saddam
[01:14:43.121 --> 01:14:53.568]  It clearly wasn't a threat, but at the same time you say that you were believing the government, Blair's government, when he said that they knew they had the weapons.
[01:14:54.149 --> 01:15:00.033]  I mean, why specifically were you against the war if you were believing their line about WMDs?
[01:15:01.218 --> 01:15:07.000]  Well, I believe what the Prime Minister said in statements he made at the House of Commons.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:20.966]  One always assumes that the leader of a country has received the top intelligence briefings, rather like the PDB, President's Daily Briefing in the United States, that the leader is
[01:15:22.238 --> 01:15:30.124]  Giving the very best information which is available and that it is as accurate as it is possible to be.
[01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:41.852]  I just assumed that that was true and when we have lists of the alleged weaponry that Saddam Hussein had, I believed that he must have it and there could be some threat involved.
[01:15:42.112 --> 01:15:47.976]  What we now know is that those were lists of munitions which were unaccounted for.
[01:15:48.596 --> 01:15:57.239]  In other words, lists of weapons that he was thought to have had at the end of the First Gulf War in 1991, but which are unaccounted for since.
[01:15:57.559 --> 01:16:00.020]  And of course, as we now know, they were all destroyed.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:08.863]  We were told that by the son-in-law of Saddam Hussein, who reneged to the West, and who made that absolutely clear, although it was denied at the time.
[01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:09.463]  We know that now.
[01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:17.906]  Well, the incredible thing is, is that Camel said in the interviews, we destroyed them, but then our news media said, Camel says he has them.
[01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:19.695]  Well, that's right.
[01:16:20.336 --> 01:16:21.857]  So we even have a lying there.
[01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:27.163]  So folks, this is an inside look into the highest levels of the British government.
[01:16:27.223 --> 01:16:28.765]  Michael Meacher and his colleagues
[01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:35.819]  They literally thought that the intelligence agencies MI6 and Blair were telling them the truth.
[01:16:35.899 --> 01:16:41.922]  They were still against invading because they didn't think that he'd, you know, violated the agreements or that it was a big enough threat.
[01:16:42.342 --> 01:16:43.843]  But still, they believed it.
[01:16:44.283 --> 01:16:48.845]  And now, has this been a learning process, Mr. Meacher, for yourself and others?
[01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:55.849]  I know it's been a learning process for us here, but the government would knowingly, because we've got our own memos, we've got our own documents,
[01:16:56.309 --> 01:17:08.974]  Not just the Downing Street memos, where they premeditatedly... I mean, we've got Rumsfeld memos where he says even if Saddam's out, even if there's no weapons, we need to go ahead and invade to use that as a launch base.
[01:17:09.274 --> 01:17:13.856]  We have the PNAC documents, September 2000, where they say even if Saddam isn't there,
[01:17:14.276 --> 01:17:19.698]  As you mentioned earlier, we need to go ahead and invade that country to dominate the region.
[01:17:20.038 --> 01:17:24.899]  So we have the PMAC boys admitting, before the fact, what it was all about.
[01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:34.962]  Then we have their own documents conferring between 10 Downing Street and the White House on the eve of the war about, we gotta manufacture some evidence so this isn't illegal.
[01:17:35.363 --> 01:17:37.043]  I mean, we have got them.
[01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:38.944]  We have caught them red-handed.
[01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:41.224]  Why is Blair still in power?
[01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:43.025]  Why hasn't Bush been impeached?
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.262]  Well, those are absolutely central questions.
[01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:57.265]  We do know now that the decision to go to war was taken at the Crawford Ranch in April 2002 when Blair came across and saw Bush
[01:18:00.927 --> 01:18:11.515]  And at least an informal understanding was made between them that the United States intended to go to war against Iraq and that Britain would give support.
[01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:14.096]  I think that that is not now challengeable.
[01:18:14.537 --> 01:18:21.902]  Both sides, both in the US and the UK, denied that the decision had been taken until virtually on the eve of the war.
[01:18:21.922 --> 01:18:23.924]  So they were not honest.
[01:18:24.464 --> 01:18:26.445]  Move it right back, right back!
[01:18:49.798 --> 01:18:51.780]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.722]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:18:54.902 --> 01:19:00.287]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:19:00.547 --> 01:19:02.069]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:19:02.109 --> 01:19:04.351]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:08.074]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:19:08.414 --> 01:19:10.435]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:17.418]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:19:17.598 --> 01:19:23.321]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.

[01:19:51.764 --> 01:19:52.804]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:53.124 --> 01:19:55.905]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:56.185 --> 01:20:00.327]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:00.767 --> 01:20:01.587]  So what do you do?
[01:20:01.907 --> 01:20:06.469]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.090]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:21:53.895 --> 01:21:56.577]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:57.297 --> 01:22:13.449]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:19.614]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:22:20.425 --> 01:22:28.369]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[01:22:50.814 --> 01:22:55.978]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:56.639 --> 01:22:59.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:05.185]  We're talking to Michael Meacher, Member of Parliament, formerly with the Blair Government.
[01:23:06.086 --> 01:23:08.508]  We're going to be taking your calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:14.472]  For Mr. Meacher, who's been kind enough to join us today, this hour is going to blast past.
[01:23:14.492 --> 01:23:16.794]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:23:22.975 --> 01:23:30.416]  Before we slimmed into that last break, Mr. Meacher, I posed the question, why isn't Blair out of government?
[01:23:30.536 --> 01:23:32.317]  Why hasn't Bush been impeached?
[01:23:32.377 --> 01:23:49.620]  I mean, if they'll lie to us, premeditatedly, folks, I mean, we have the documents where, you know, we got a lot of the people, they're talking about it, planning it like criminals, and I guess you can answer the question for England, I don't know if I can answer the question here, but can you please elaborate on that for us?
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:24:16.939]  Well, after these facts began to come out in the month after the end of the war, and when the insurgency was getting worse, and when clearly there was very little planning for the reorganization of Iraq, there were intense questions asked in the British Parliament, because we do have question time when we can question ministers, including the Prime Minister, but we did not have a debate
[01:24:18.133 --> 01:24:30.917]  Because it is the government that controls the agenda in the House of Commons, and they frankly decline demands to have a debate to discuss the matter formally in the Parliament.
[01:24:31.497 --> 01:24:42.921]  In the end, the only debate that has taken place since the end of the war in April 2003, more than two years ago, occurred in July 2004, that is 15 months after the end of the war,
[01:24:46.192 --> 01:25:15.025]  It was just before Parliament went into recess for the summer and it was a very short debate which ended at seven in the evening not as normally at ten o'clock and above all under a particular part of the parliamentary procedure it wasn't a debate on a resolution namely that the government stands condemned for this and that or the government has acted well on behalf of this and that
[01:25:15.305 --> 01:25:16.026]  So what message?
[01:25:37.023 --> 01:25:38.864]  Well, over here it's worse.
[01:25:39.325 --> 01:25:46.449]  They have debates about funding every six months, and only increase the funding for this illegal, immoral war.
[01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:54.894]  And I don't know if you're aware of Pentagon documents like P2OG, but Rumsfeld actually talks about wanting things to be bad, wanting to balkanize.
[01:25:54.914 --> 01:25:58.236]  I mean, all empires try to seek to divide and conquer,
[01:25:59.293 --> 01:26:02.936]  And they want Iraq to be a miserable failure.
[01:26:02.976 --> 01:26:09.561]  That's actually a big win for the Anglo-American establishment led by the neocons.
[01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:14.185]  But here we've had them continually for two years plus.
[01:26:14.765 --> 01:26:22.470]  Reauthorize the funding for this, and now there's really no discussion of how we were lied to about WMDs.
[01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:30.916]  And Bush and members of his cabinet, Rumsfeld, have gotten up on TV and said it was never about WMDs.
[01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.697]  You know, you mentioned Richard Perle.
[01:26:33.238 --> 01:26:37.701]  I mean, how stupid do they think we are to say Rumsfeld says it's an urban legend?
[01:26:38.923 --> 01:26:43.746]  That he never said that, and then we've got hundreds of clips of him saying it.
[01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:50.370]  I mean, this really seems to be a new level of just cavalier, arrogant lying.
[01:26:51.731 --> 01:26:57.795]  Well, these are very powerful words you use, but it is very difficult to deny them.
[01:26:58.415 --> 01:27:07.221]  I think both in the US, I really cannot speak, of course, about the US, but in the UK, there has been a centralization of power
[01:27:07.759 --> 01:27:08.059]  I don't
[01:27:29.921 --> 01:27:33.265]  The capacity to appoint committees of inquiry.
[01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:38.691]  There were, of course, committees of inquiry in this country about the Iraq War.
[01:27:39.152 --> 01:27:46.381]  The first involved a committee led by someone called Lord Hutton, which was widely regarded as a whitewash.
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:28:09.634]  Uh, the second, uh, was run by the former head of the Civil Service, Lord Butler, but of course all the membership was actually chosen by the Prime Minister, uh, and it clearly, although it was a very rigorous analysis of what was wrong with the war, uh, there were virtually no recommendations, uh, for accountability about who should be responsible or who should be stood down because of it.
[01:28:10.354 --> 01:28:22.259]  And when we have the select committee for the House of Commons, which are the most powerful committee investigating it, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, of course, does not have access to the secret intelligence data.
[01:28:22.819 --> 01:28:29.042]  The one committee that does have access to the secret intelligence data is, again, personally chosen by the Prime Minister.
[01:28:29.062 --> 01:28:30.183]  We've got a break again?
[01:28:30.683 --> 01:28:35.805]  It reports to him, and he has a right to edit the document before it's made public.
[01:28:36.165 --> 01:28:36.765]  Unbelievable!
[01:28:36.805 --> 01:28:38.006]  We've got a break, we'll be right back.
[01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:41.010]  We're on the march.
[01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.112]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.032 --> 01:28:46.795]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:26.751]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.

[01:29:49.739 --> 01:29:52.761]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:53.081 --> 01:29:58.004]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:58.245 --> 01:30:02.627]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:02.908 --> 01:30:11.833]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:12.034 --> 01:30:15.636]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:30:15.936 --> 01:30:20.965]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:21.265 --> 01:30:27.977]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.111]  What about you?

[01:30:56.699 --> 01:31:01.701]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:09.944]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:10.084 --> 01:31:17.127]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:18.548]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:18.708 --> 01:31:22.090]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:31:44.022 --> 01:31:44.923]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:05.339 --> 01:32:14.861]  That I could ask, and I know there's so many that you could bring up, and we've only got about 25 minutes left, so we'll have to kind of limit the length or the detail of the answers.
[01:32:15.581 --> 01:32:32.245]  But Mr. Meachur, I mean, reading your The War on Terror is Bogus article, you basically spell out all the connections between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and the PNAC group, and, you know, these top generals and NORAD standing down,
[01:32:33.018 --> 01:32:39.348]  And then now we have Paul Craig Roberts, who was the number two at the Department of the Treasury, going public.
[01:32:39.408 --> 01:32:47.821]  We have Morgan Reynolds, who was number two at the Department of Labor, their chief economist, going public.
[01:32:48.573 --> 01:32:51.214]  And saying the way the towers fell is impossible.
[01:32:51.955 --> 01:33:02.099]  You have Blair and all this political trouble over Iraq, and the tragic London bombings happen, and then his approval ratings get a boost, and he says, see, this is why we're in Iraq.
[01:33:02.579 --> 01:33:06.261]  Meanwhile, it turns out that a MI6-controlled minion
[01:33:07.041 --> 01:33:23.275]  Uh, was, uh, this Aswat guy was protected, and is being protected by MI6, and then when they finally grab him, they say, oh, this is over immigration, we're not going to question him about the bombings, even though he made phone calls to both groups of supposed bombers.
[01:33:23.295 --> 01:33:24.917]  I mean, we just, uh...
[01:33:25.504 --> 01:33:27.706]  I mean, they're at your house after we did that interview.
[01:33:27.726 --> 01:33:31.569]  You started talking a little bit more about 9-11.
[01:33:32.269 --> 01:33:36.052]  Tell us from all the evidence what Michael Meecher really thinks about 9-11.
[01:33:36.072 --> 01:33:40.475]  Well, I think there are three questions about 9-11.
[01:33:42.136 --> 01:33:49.038]  Which I can raise, but I cannot fully answer and of course it is for the Bush administration to provide the answers.
[01:33:49.078 --> 01:34:01.361]  The first is, how is it that the Bush administration so completely failed to take account of the enormous amount of evidence before 9-11?
[01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:09.823]  No one said that there was going to be an attack with planes on the towers that morning, but the, well let me just quote,
[01:34:11.082 --> 01:34:35.793]  What was actually said by John Loftus that the information, John Loftus being the former US Federal Crimes Prosecutor, and this is what he said, the information provided by European Intelligent Services prior to 9-11 was so extensive that it is no longer possible for either the CIA or FBI to assert a defense of incompetence.
[01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:46.798]  We know that Mossad has produced evidence about 200 extremists, Islamic persons in the United States who were clearly for watching.
[01:34:46.818 --> 01:34:54.284]  That included actually the names of four of the hijackers who were among the 20 or the 19 on the day.
[01:34:54.744 --> 01:34:56.886]  None of them were arrested, none of them were found.
[01:34:57.807 --> 01:35:01.049]  There was the evidence of the 20th hijacker, Mosawi,
[01:35:02.589 --> 01:35:09.492]  Who was captured because he was asking questions about flying heavy airliners which were very suspicious.
[01:35:09.512 --> 01:35:12.713]  The FBI said that they didn't want his computer examined.
[01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:17.895]  It is known now that it did contain some evidence which might have given leads to 9-11.
[01:35:18.395 --> 01:35:21.856]  Why is it that none of that was sufficiently followed up?
[01:35:21.896 --> 01:35:22.637]  That's point one.
[01:35:22.697 --> 01:35:29.379]  Point two is, how on the day when the hijack was first suspected between 8-10 and 8-20 a.m.
[01:35:32.749 --> 01:35:39.095]  And the last hijacked aircraft crashed into, in Pennsylvania at about just after 10 o'clock.
[01:35:39.456 --> 01:35:41.258]  That's an hour and 40 minutes.
[01:35:42.599 --> 01:35:47.424]  No single fighter plane was scrambled to investigate from the U.S.
[01:35:47.664 --> 01:35:55.031]  Andrews Air Force Base, which is only 10 miles away from Washington, D.C., until after the third plane had hit the Pentagon at 9.38.
[01:35:56.644 --> 01:35:58.425]  I just have to ask a question, why not?
[01:35:58.505 --> 01:36:02.007]  America is the most advanced military technological society in the world.
[01:36:02.347 --> 01:36:04.828]  For an hour and 20 minutes, no plane was put into the air.
[01:36:05.128 --> 01:36:09.571]  When you have F-16s, world-class fighter planes, only 10 miles away.
[01:36:10.111 --> 01:36:12.412]  I cannot answer that question, but it does need to be answered.
[01:36:12.432 --> 01:36:18.977]  Well another question is why did the White House call Mayor Willie Brown the night before and say don't flood in New York?
[01:36:19.358 --> 01:36:23.741]  Why did they call some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the night before and tell them don't flood in New York?
[01:36:24.162 --> 01:36:31.848]  Why did CIA link companies to insider trading put options specifically on United and American at record levels?
[01:36:32.448 --> 01:36:38.794]  Why was the head of Pakistani intelligence who wired $100,000 to the supposedly hijacker Mohammed Anna?
[01:36:39.454 --> 01:36:43.018]  Why was he having breakfast with the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee?
[01:36:43.418 --> 01:36:48.783]  Why did Bush have the orders on his desk to launch attacks on Afghanistan two days before 9-11?
[01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:53.807]  There are hundreds and hundreds of these points, and you hit the nail on the head.
[01:36:54.568 --> 01:36:56.790]  Bush said they had never heard of a plan
[01:36:57.612 --> 01:37:05.480]  to fly planes into buildings when they had specific reports on their desk weeks before and everybody knew about it.
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.741]  So again, they moved planes.
[01:37:07.762 --> 01:37:15.329]  It was known as early as 1996, which is five years before that there were plans to hit Washington targets with airplanes.
[01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:18.933]  In 1999, a US National Intelligence Council report
[01:37:19.526 --> 01:37:29.249]  noted, and I quote, Al-Qaeda suicide bombers could crash land an aircraft packed with high explosives into the Pentagon, the CIA, or the White House.
[01:37:29.649 --> 01:37:31.330]  That was written by the U.S.
[01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:32.971]  National Intelligence Council in 1999.
[01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:44.875]  I mean, there was such overwhelming evidence, and the key point, the key point, I think, is that, of course, 9-11 provided a pretext.
[01:37:45.075 --> 01:37:48.676]  It provided a pretext for what they wanted to do all along.
[01:37:49.578 --> 01:38:03.407]  Paul O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary, indicated that from the first few days of the Bush Administration, in January 2001, the argument was not whether they were going to attack Afghanistan, particularly Iraq, but when, and how to do it.
[01:38:03.427 --> 01:38:07.490]  Well, Dick Cheney said, Dick Cheney said, find me links.
[01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:08.410]  That's right.
[01:38:08.771 --> 01:38:10.372]  I want to link Iraq to
[01:38:11.931 --> 01:38:19.116]  To these attacks when patently there were absolutely no connections in anybody's political lexicon.
[01:38:19.496 --> 01:38:34.886]  Absolutely, and the PNAC document, Project for a New America Century, which you commented on, written September 2000, just before Bush came into office, written by the neocons, says that the process of transforming the U.S.
[01:38:35.047 --> 01:38:40.090]  into tomorrow's dominant force, which is their phrase, is likely to be a long one,
[01:38:40.732 --> 01:38:51.940]  In the absence of, and I quote this phrase which is chilling, in the absence of some catastrophic and catalyzing event, dash like a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:57.224]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski... The 9-11 attacks allowed the U.S.
[01:38:57.304 --> 01:39:06.010]  to press the go button for a strategy in accordance with that PNAC agenda which it would otherwise have been politically impossible to implement.
[01:39:06.351 --> 01:39:09.433]  It gave them the pretext to do what they want.
[01:39:09.973 --> 01:39:11.755]  That's why it's so significant.
[01:39:11.775 --> 01:39:25.170]  There's no connection at all between 9-11 and Iraq, but they wanted to take control of Middle East oil, and they wanted the pretext to do it, and that's what 9-11 gave them.
[01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:41.689]  And the incredible thing is, is that they admit it's about oil and weapon sales, and Bush also told his biographer, if I'm a war president, nobody can question me, so it's about dictatorial powers here in America and across the world.
[01:39:41.729 --> 01:39:42.991]  But for those that just joined us,
[01:39:43.551 --> 01:40:01.465]  It's important to understand, these guys aren't through by a long shot, but before we get into what their future plans may be, with Michael Meacher, British Member of Parliament, and former cabinet member with Blair, before we go there, Bush says arrest anybody who's got connections to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda.
[01:40:01.966 --> 01:40:04.988]  Well, Saddam had no connections to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda.
[01:40:05.609 --> 01:40:24.616]  But Osama Bin Laden literally had hundreds of connections back into the seventies to the bushes and airports and oil companies and into 2000 and 2001 and Bush flying 161 Bin Ladens out of the country two days after 9-11 when all air traffic is grounded.
[01:40:24.716 --> 01:40:30.878]  I mean, Michael Meacher, can I get a quote from you on the connections between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens?
[01:40:31.338 --> 01:40:32.839]  Well, you've said it all.
[01:40:32.879 --> 01:40:33.719]  There are very close
[01:40:34.259 --> 01:40:38.701]  Connections which have been spelt out in many documents, spelt out in books.
[01:40:38.761 --> 01:40:47.704]  The Bush family, the Bush father, grandfather and the Bin Ladens are very close.
[01:40:48.764 --> 01:40:53.186]  There is absolutely masses of documentary evidence to indicate that.
[01:40:53.986 --> 01:41:00.929]  And as you say, how in those circumstances, immediately after the atrocity on 9-11,
[01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:16.413]  All the members of his family, I'm sure the vast majority or nearly all of them knew nothing about it, but they may well have had evidence which was crucial to the American authorities in tracking down those who were responsible, but they weren't questioned.
[01:41:16.573 --> 01:41:16.994]  Why?
[01:41:17.474 --> 01:41:21.595]  Because the Bush administration did not want 9-11 investigated.
[01:41:23.155 --> 01:41:40.546]  It had happened, it gave them politically, militarily what they wanted, and they didn't want anyone investigating their errors, their failures in the period leading up to it, or the quite extraordinary disorganization failure on the day.
[01:41:40.827 --> 01:41:43.668]  They just wanted to take advantage of what had happened.
[01:41:44.809 --> 01:41:50.653]  But, I mean, if you fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, and then mathematically it's many times
[01:41:52.088 --> 01:41:59.234]  Well, that, of course, is when you get into the whole question of conspiracy theory versus cock-up.
[01:41:59.254 --> 01:42:03.658]  I have to tell you, from my long political experience, I'm a great believer in cock-up.
[01:42:18.811 --> 01:42:20.153]  It nearly always is cock-up.
[01:42:20.513 --> 01:42:27.779]  However, having said that, it is certainly true in history that conspiracies do occur.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:37.387]  Now, whether in this particular case there was a degree of facilitation of this is not something I'm going to comment on.
[01:42:37.788 --> 01:42:45.975]  Many people believe that that is true and I absolutely agree that the evidence is quite comprehensive
[01:42:46.623 --> 01:42:53.704]  It is pointing in a particular direction, but it is basically for the Bush administration to answer these central questions.
[01:42:54.084 --> 01:43:04.386]  What really angers me is the Keene Commission, which is the national approved body for investigating this, is, in my opinion, very largely a complete whitewash.
[01:43:05.166 --> 01:43:06.346]  Well, it's appointed by Bush.
[01:43:06.406 --> 01:43:09.907]  I mean, how is it independent if it's appointed by Bush?
[01:43:09.927 --> 01:43:16.028]  Well, that's true, but also, for those who've read it, as I have, it is only the first chapter
[01:43:16.621 --> 01:43:17.161]  I don't know.
[01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.890]  We're good to go.
[01:44:01.113 --> 01:44:06.794]  Even though the American authorities, the FBI and Pearl's Widow, don't believe that he was responsible.
[01:44:07.254 --> 01:44:23.898]  But the key point is that he is the person who is allegedly the one who was told by the head of the Pakistani Secret Intelligence Service to wire $100,000 to Mohammed Atta, the leading 9-11 hijacker, just before the attacks.
[01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:30.119]  That's been confirmed by Dennis Lorimel, who is the director of the FBI's Financial Crimes Unit,
[01:44:30.754 --> 01:44:37.885]  But the astonishing thing is that Omar Sheikh has never been brought to trial for what he knows about 9-11.
[01:44:38.166 --> 01:44:42.313]  I mean, why is it that Sybil Edmonds, who is this
[01:44:44.373 --> 01:44:50.237]  Translator in the FBI, who has a great deal of relevant information.
[01:44:50.277 --> 01:44:52.479]  She says she's now under two gag orders.
[01:44:52.839 --> 01:45:03.187]  That Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who's supposed to be the leading organizer for Bin Laden, who was arrested in Rawalpindi two years ago, never been brought to trial.
[01:45:03.507 --> 01:45:06.409]  I mean, he must know a great deal about 9-11.
[01:45:06.469 --> 01:45:08.191]  Why isn't he brought into public trial?
[01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:09.712]  Why isn't Omar Sheikh
[01:45:12.153 --> 01:45:27.562]  Well, they can't because they're intelligence agency bag men for the West who are funding and orchestrating attacks that would then be able to bring in this one world government that the neocons are trying to set up.
[01:45:27.643 --> 01:45:30.884]  I mean, that's where all the evidence points for me, Mr. Meacher.
[01:45:31.185 --> 01:45:35.127]  Let me digress for a second.
[01:45:36.249 --> 01:45:37.330]  Into the bigger picture.
[01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:43.895]  Where are these neocons going from the writings that you've read, that they've put out, from their own statements?
[01:45:43.955 --> 01:45:45.517]  I mean, I don't think they're done.
[01:45:45.897 --> 01:45:47.178]  I don't think they're quitters.
[01:45:47.578 --> 01:45:52.982]  Just because they've been caught lying and stealing and insider trading, they're not going to stop.
[01:45:53.083 --> 01:45:56.465]  I mean, I see them trying to go into Iran by hook or crook.
[01:45:56.725 --> 01:45:57.306]  What do you say?
[01:45:58.479 --> 01:46:14.834]  I think you're absolutely right that the neocons are utterly ruthless and despite all the reverses that have happened in Iraq, I certainly think they have their eyes on a further vision and it may well involve Iran.
[01:46:15.884 --> 01:46:28.975]  I did quote the PENAC document, which says that the US bases are necessary in the Middle East, quote, because Iran may well prove as large a threat to US interests as Iraq has.
[01:46:30.233 --> 01:46:41.379]  Now, that certainly suggests that Iran may well be in their sights, and I'm quite sure that both for military, political, and above all energy, i.e.
[01:46:41.499 --> 01:46:50.684]  hydrocarbon oil reasons, the neocons intend to have permanent control, or at least for a very long period ahead, in the Middle East.
[01:46:50.924 --> 01:46:54.086]  And once again, we are looking for a pretext.
[01:46:55.371 --> 01:46:55.611]  I think?
[01:47:09.474 --> 01:47:20.104]  But the attempt to destabilize what is seen as the authoritarian rule of the Mullahs is going to be replaced by a more pro-democratic and pro-U.S.
[01:47:20.144 --> 01:47:22.586]  government in Iran.
[01:47:23.467 --> 01:47:24.708]  But if Israel or the U.S.
[01:47:24.748 --> 01:47:27.411]  strikes Iran, and they strike back,
[01:47:27.951 --> 01:47:35.698]  That is then going to be used as the pretext to have a full-out invasion, and the globalists are beating the drum here.
[01:47:35.738 --> 01:47:47.869]  The neocons are beating the drum here, saying that they do want to invade Iran, and laying out all of their different reasons of why this is going to be just so wonderful.
[01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:49.451]  But look, I look at Mosaddegh.
[01:47:49.992 --> 01:47:53.214]  I mean, it's now declassified, publicly admitted, no debate.
[01:47:53.574 --> 01:47:54.114]  The U.S.
[01:47:54.154 --> 01:48:03.719]  government, at the request of British Petroleum, formerly Anglo-American Oil, openly blew up Mosque and shot people and blamed it on Mosaddegh to take him out of power.
[01:48:04.179 --> 01:48:06.100]  Our government openly attacked the U.S.'
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.721]  's liberty with Israel to blame it on Egypt.
[01:48:08.902 --> 01:48:12.083]  I've had the admirals on, the former Chairman Joint Chiefs on.
[01:48:12.123 --> 01:48:19.547]  I mean, this is all... I mean, I've talked to the people on air when LBJ said, I want that ship going to the GD bottom.
[01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:33.625]  Michael, I've caught them over and over again pulling stuff, and I think they'll either finance some terrorists who don't even know who's financing them, like Gladio and other operations, or I think they'll carry out operations.
[01:48:33.906 --> 01:48:34.507]  Your comments?
[01:48:36.170 --> 01:49:03.713]  I think the degree to which the US government uses proxies, for example getting Islamic Jihadists to fight in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, then using again another Jihadi core against the Bosnian Muslims, to fight for the Bosnian Muslims and to weaken the third government's hold on Yugoslavia,
[01:49:04.694 --> 01:49:13.242]  I think that is a major reason why we have seen this push by many of the Islamic Jihadists into Western Europe.
[01:49:13.362 --> 01:49:29.857]  But I entirely agree with you that if you look at the PNAC document and other published documents which are in the public domain, I would see the PNAC document as being frankly a manifesto for US world domination.
[01:49:30.738 --> 01:49:33.119]  Uh, it is really extraordinary.
[01:49:33.159 --> 01:49:39.221]  It talks about, uh, spotlighting China for regime change, saying it's time to increase the presence of U.S.
[01:49:39.341 --> 01:49:41.362]  American forces in Southeast Asia.
[01:49:41.922 --> 01:49:43.623]  It talks about creating U.S.
[01:49:43.803 --> 01:49:45.964]  Space Forces to dominate space.
[01:49:46.084 --> 01:49:46.984]  Gotta break again.
[01:49:47.044 --> 01:49:47.745]  Gotta break again.

[01:53:10.764 --> 01:53:22.672]  We need to be clear here that when we talk about an American empire, we mean these big globalist private interests that are actually de-industrializing our country, that are actually setting up a police state.
[01:53:23.013 --> 01:53:25.895]  So many Americans I talk to think that they're going to be part of the empire.
[01:53:26.761 --> 01:53:28.182]  They think, oh yeah, it's an empire.
[01:53:28.222 --> 01:53:29.422]  Yeah, we need that oil.
[01:53:29.803 --> 01:53:33.024]  I mean, now on Neocon Radio, it's just like a pack of criminals.
[01:53:33.805 --> 01:53:39.388]  And we need to be clear that, you know, empires, you can't always blame their populations.
[01:53:40.068 --> 01:53:41.989]  Because these empires manufacture consent.
[01:53:42.309 --> 01:53:45.571]  It's like in 1775, 1776, when the King of England, George III, went to Parliament.
[01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:48.112]  And about 40% of Parliament voted against him.
[01:53:54.838 --> 01:53:58.983]  But the other 60% said, yeah, let's go to war, and they had a disastrous eight-year war.
[01:53:59.464 --> 01:54:00.525]  Well, it's the same thing today.
[01:54:00.585 --> 01:54:09.436]  We have an imperial group that thinks that America's energies and England's energies are here for their own private financial gains.
[01:54:10.397 --> 01:54:13.361]  And they're ruthless, they're dangerous, they've got to be stopped.
[01:54:13.926 --> 01:54:17.009]  Michael Meacher has agreed to stay five minutes in the next hour so we can take calls.
[01:54:17.409 --> 01:54:18.850]  Really appreciate it.
[01:54:18.930 --> 01:54:22.013]  Skyler, Wayne, and others, we're about to go to your calls.
[01:54:22.473 --> 01:54:25.535]  But just briefly, I've got to ask this question, Michael Meacher.
[01:54:25.916 --> 01:54:30.759]  When you were about to resign, did Tony Blair try to stop you from leaving his government?
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.622]  Or after you resigned, did he say something to you?
[01:54:34.924 --> 01:54:55.699]  No, there was of course intense concern before the debate as to what members of the government would do and indeed whether the Labour Party would actually have a majority in the House of Commons because of course the government was actually backed by the Conservative opposition.
[01:54:55.839 --> 01:55:00.662]  If the Conservative opposition had voted against the government on that night
[01:55:01.383 --> 01:55:04.405]  Then actually the government would not have had a majority at all.
[01:55:04.826 --> 01:55:14.315]  But there was very great concern that we were winning a vote on the basis of the support from the opposition and not on the basis of support within our own party.
[01:55:14.375 --> 01:55:23.464]  So there was an enormous amount of discussion and clearly pressure which was put through the wits
[01:55:24.392 --> 01:55:28.757]  Uh, who are the party managers in the House to make sure that everyone supported the government.
[01:55:29.278 --> 01:55:33.904]  Uh, but I have to say, I was not personally approached, um, by, uh, Tony Blair.
[01:55:34.445 --> 01:55:38.631]  Um, and indeed immediately afterwards, uh, these things, uh, had happened.
[01:55:38.651 --> 01:55:41.034]  Have you ever talked to Blair since then?
[01:55:43.538 --> 01:55:46.359]  Yes, I have.
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:56:02.007]  I've had quite a lengthy conversation, I suppose, which was about a whole variety of issues, including Britain's, what I would say, a fairly sycophantic attitude towards the United States.
[01:56:03.368 --> 01:56:06.529]  Well, the argument is, we bailed you out from Hitler so you better do what we say.
[01:56:06.549 --> 01:56:07.469]  This is completely different.
[01:56:28.969 --> 01:56:30.250]  Well, it is absolutely.
[01:56:30.691 --> 01:56:33.573]  As you say, first of all, that was 50 years ago.
[01:56:33.593 --> 01:56:38.337]  We were all fighting the menace of Nazism in Europe.
[01:56:38.777 --> 01:56:51.588]  But I think the idea that because the Americans who lend, the Americans who lend, lease the forces and a great deal of money and support at that time, which, of course, all of Europe remains deeply grateful for.
[01:56:51.688 --> 01:56:55.511]  Nevertheless, that cannot be a reason for supporting the United States if
[01:56:56.011 --> 01:57:01.057]  That administration takes upon itself to act illegally and to cause an unresolved war.
[01:57:01.137 --> 01:57:06.302]  Well the point is, Hitler was invading countries, Hitler was attacking and bombing London.
[01:57:06.622 --> 01:57:07.724]  This is totally different.
[01:57:07.764 --> 01:57:10.687]  Saddam had his hands up, begging and groveling.
[01:57:11.307 --> 01:57:14.150]  That's exactly correct.
[01:57:14.651 --> 01:57:17.434]  So to compare Saddam Hussein to Hitler is a joke.
[01:57:18.215 --> 01:57:26.797]  I know, but I don't think this argument that you may not like going to war over Iraq, but we helped you against Hitler, so you've got to help us in Iraq.
[01:57:26.857 --> 01:57:28.578]  I don't think it was ever put in those terms.
[01:57:28.678 --> 01:57:34.479]  It's much more... This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:45.939 --> 01:57:46.579]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.239 --> 01:57:48.320]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.140]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.781 --> 01:57:51.601]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.361 --> 01:57:53.302]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.562 --> 01:57:57.883]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.083 --> 01:58:02.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:02.405 --> 01:58:09.307]  America was born in a fight against an empire that had never been defeated.
[01:58:10.027 --> 01:58:15.269]  And to see America turned into an imperial tool of private interest
[01:58:15.848 --> 01:58:16.288]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[01:58:16.348 --> 01:58:17.589]  I've got a question.
[01:58:17.609 --> 01:58:19.951]  Do you guys think that they're going to be using
[01:58:29.369 --> 01:58:33.772]  this war and other disasters like Katrina to push for a draft anytime soon?
[01:58:34.093 --> 01:58:35.634]  Well, they've introduced the legislation.
[01:58:35.754 --> 01:58:36.935]  They've introduced the legislation.
[01:58:37.235 --> 01:58:42.119]  What about national conscription or bringing back the old press games, Mr. Major?
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:50.745]  Well, that's a question which I'm aware has been raised in the United States as to whether there is an intention to bring back conscription.
[01:58:50.765 --> 01:58:55.269]  Of course, it's been denied, but you're saying that the legislation is already being prepared.
[01:58:56.229 --> 01:59:00.852]  Obviously, I think that that is possible, but you know more about it in the States, of course, than we do here.
[01:59:01.253 --> 01:59:04.195]  How long has it been since you had a national service in your country?
[01:59:04.215 --> 01:59:04.195]  1957.
[01:59:04.635 --> 01:59:09.018]  I don't think that would be too popular over there, would it?
[01:59:10.999 --> 01:59:14.802]  I think it is inconceivable that it could happen in Europe now.
[01:59:15.826 --> 01:59:24.551]  Um, I certainly think in Britain it would be political suicide for any government or political party, even to murmur the word.
[01:59:24.692 --> 01:59:27.873]  But what if a suitcase nuke went off in America?
[01:59:27.913 --> 01:59:29.775]  I bet we'd see it real fast.
[01:59:29.815 --> 01:59:30.915]  Go ahead and finish up, Skyler.
[01:59:30.935 --> 01:59:43.623]  Uh, yeah, well, I was just concerned because I'm of draft age and, you know, I don't really want to fight for the empire, but, hey, they do have really good free training, so... I don't know.
[01:59:44.392 --> 01:59:47.154]  Alright Scott, thank you for the call.
[01:59:47.294 --> 01:59:49.837]  Wayne in Kansas, go ahead Wayne, you're on the air.
[01:59:50.197 --> 01:59:59.244]  Hey, I'm a retired Army officer, 22 years, and I was pretty conservative until Bush got into office, then I became a Democrat and started protesting the war and all that stuff.
[02:00:01.026 --> 02:00:01.927]  One quick question.
[02:00:02.347 --> 02:00:06.090]  Well then I guess you're protesting Bill Clinton and Hillary and all them.
[02:00:06.410 --> 02:00:08.392]  They're all for the war, but sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:08.412 --> 02:00:13.216]  No, no, this whole thing about Team Bush scares the hell out of me.
[02:00:14.079 --> 02:00:17.061]  And W stands for the President.
[02:00:17.762 --> 02:00:19.923]  It's like fascist accoutrements.
[02:00:20.003 --> 02:00:21.404]  Michael Meecher, you want to comment on that?
[02:00:21.724 --> 02:00:24.066]  Sorry, what is the point you're making?
[02:00:24.366 --> 02:00:28.229]  People are almost wearing Bush armbands.
[02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:32.272]  Weird bumper stickers, W is the President.
[02:00:32.812 --> 02:00:40.638]  Well of course, we've read here in Europe about those who've gone down to the Bush ranch
[02:00:41.939 --> 02:00:46.343]  Cindy Sheehan on one side, and of course the Bush supporters on the other.
[02:00:46.683 --> 02:00:52.249]  And it clearly seems to us that opinion is rapidly polarizing in the United States.
[02:00:53.129 --> 02:01:02.939]  As happens, as the situation gets more extreme, as the political pressures build up, the people on both sides become more strident, more extreme in their attitudes.
[02:01:02.999 --> 02:01:05.261]  And that may well be what is actually happening in the States.
[02:01:06.283 --> 02:01:07.303]  I think you're pretty worrying.
[02:01:07.704 --> 02:01:08.604]  Uh, one question?
[02:01:09.024 --> 02:01:09.724]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:01:09.845 --> 02:01:11.285]  Who was the bad guy at 9-11?
[02:01:11.425 --> 02:01:17.108]  I mean, I'm not trying to ask a loaded question.
[02:01:17.208 --> 02:01:18.368]  I just do not know.
[02:01:19.789 --> 02:01:20.969]  And it's bugged me ever since.
[02:01:21.489 --> 02:01:24.791]  Well, I'll guarantee you, that didn't happen by accident.
[02:01:24.811 --> 02:01:27.852]  9-11 was an inside job, as Don Henley says.
[02:01:28.932 --> 02:01:30.093]  Any way you look at it,
[02:01:30.749 --> 02:01:32.310]  Okay, the government knew.
[02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:35.012]  The government just accidentally funded the people that attacked.
[02:01:35.272 --> 02:01:39.215]  They accidentally had FBI people living in the houses with the hijackers.
[02:01:39.255 --> 02:01:40.956]  They accidentally gave them money.
[02:01:40.996 --> 02:01:42.937]  They accidentally had NORAD stand down.
[02:01:43.238 --> 02:01:44.018]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:01:45.119 --> 02:01:46.620]  Let's get Michael Meacher's comment, Michael.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.684]  Well, obviously the bad guy of 9-11 are those who actually committed the atrocity.
[02:01:51.744 --> 02:01:53.546]  I mean, let's be absolutely clear about that.
[02:01:53.646 --> 02:02:07.937]  But I do think that where something happens like this, the same happened with the London bombings, questions have got to be asked of the government of whether they had prior information sufficient to be able to try and prevent this happening.
[02:02:08.258 --> 02:02:12.241]  And I do think in the case of 9-11, the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:02:13.022 --> 02:02:17.225]  Uh, that the government knew an awful lot more than they have admitted to.
[02:02:17.245 --> 02:02:23.408]  Uh, whether they knew enough actually to stop it on the day, uh, well, that's not a question for me to answer.
[02:02:23.628 --> 02:02:28.131]  But they failed to follow up any of the data, any of the trail.
[02:02:28.231 --> 02:02:34.374]  And had they done so, I think there is a very reasonable possibility that 9-11 wouldn't have happened.
[02:02:34.514 --> 02:02:36.716]  Michael Major, let me say bye to you on the other side.
[02:02:36.736 --> 02:02:37.036]  Stay there.
[02:02:42.682 --> 02:02:45.564]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:45.805 --> 02:02:47.386]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.726 --> 02:02:52.390]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:59.456]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:02:59.796 --> 02:03:01.778]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:01.978 --> 02:03:04.820]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:09.584]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:09.784 --> 02:03:14.207]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:14.428 --> 02:03:21.653]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:21.914 --> 02:03:24.335]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:48.733]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:04:48.953 --> 02:04:52.996]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:04:53.236 --> 02:04:55.417]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:04:55.758 --> 02:04:57.739]  All natural Non-X clears out the soil
[02:04:57.739 --> 02:04:58.039]  I think so.
[02:05:23.573 --> 02:05:31.700]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.482]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:34.882 --> 02:05:40.266]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:42.228 --> 02:05:44.450]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:47.772]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:49.136 --> 02:06:06.112]  I want all the listeners out there in radio land and on the internet and cyberspace to know that we beat our brains out, working, digging, snooping, scrabbling around, fighting the New World Order.
[02:06:07.333 --> 02:06:09.054]  I mean, we're here, folks, for you.
[02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:13.699]  I'm constantly kicking myself and squeezing my crew
[02:06:14.443 --> 02:06:18.426]  To do more, and find more, and dig out more, and resist more.
[02:06:18.966 --> 02:06:21.628]  I'm constantly kicking myself that I'm not doing enough.
[02:06:24.631 --> 02:06:42.184]  The folks out there, you do so much emailing us stories and telling us what you saw on television and sending us video clips and calling local AM and FM stations that don't carry our show and telling them to carry the broadcast or thanking existing affiliates that we've had in many cases for years and years.
[02:06:42.884 --> 02:06:45.386]  I am so honored and humbled to be your host.
[02:06:46.046 --> 02:06:50.810]  I'm just an average person that understands how the elites operate, that understands their paradigm.
[02:06:52.538 --> 02:06:57.901]  If they screw up and do a horrible job on purpose in New Orleans, they get more funding, more power.
[02:06:59.062 --> 02:07:06.767]  If they allow terrorists to attack us, or fund the terrorists, or orchestrate the entire operation, as we know they did, they get more power and control.
[02:07:07.387 --> 02:07:19.214]  When they ship in heroin and cocaine, they get to make the money off it at the top, they get to militarize the police, they get to bust down your door looking for it, they get to put your teenager in prison, a private prison they own.
[02:07:20.387 --> 02:07:27.111]  Again, when they get to go into Iraq and the mission fails and they're there for 10 years, that's a big win!
[02:07:28.012 --> 02:07:30.073]  Because they make more money off weapon sales.
[02:07:31.174 --> 02:07:33.235]  They get to build permanent bases there.
[02:07:33.655 --> 02:07:36.117]  People aren't looking at this from the proper angle.
[02:07:36.677 --> 02:07:39.899]  Once you look at things from the right angle, you see the whole thing.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:47.464]  Really, the world we're given, the establishment line we're given, is an illusion.
[02:07:48.564 --> 02:07:49.445]  Is a mirage.
[02:07:51.722 --> 02:08:01.149]  And if you just simply step over a few feet to another angle, you can actually see the creature we're dealing with.
[02:08:01.649 --> 02:08:03.951]  The type of animal we're grappling with.
[02:08:05.952 --> 02:08:11.096]  And I'll be honest with the listeners, I made a mistake a few weeks ago.
[02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:20.323]  I had not had a vacation longer than two days in over ten years.
[02:08:21.238 --> 02:08:23.400]  And I took an entire week off.
[02:08:25.801 --> 02:08:45.435]  And I'd always read and heard that people that exerted themselves mentally or physically to an incredible extent that the body would go into an emergency mode and that when you finally had R&R that that is when that that that that is when you would have problems.
[02:08:49.197 --> 02:08:50.078]  And I know that
[02:08:50.959 --> 02:08:52.600]  I mean, I feel punch drunk right now.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:58.003]  I mean, a lot of it is I got back to town and I've had allergies ever since, which I can't seem to get rid of.
[02:08:58.383 --> 02:09:00.144]  I don't know why I'm whining about this on air.
[02:09:00.724 --> 02:09:03.526]  I just feel like my thoughts are going through a couple feet of water.
[02:09:04.506 --> 02:09:11.890]  Whereas normally I can remember everything and basically know all the documents by heart and all the facts and the info.
[02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:15.812]  I mean, my brain's still working, but it's like somewhat of a labor.
[02:09:15.832 --> 02:09:16.913]  I don't know how to explain it.
[02:09:17.353 --> 02:09:19.194]  I don't know why I'm talking about this on air.
[02:09:20.467 --> 02:09:22.168]  But I know what it is, really.
[02:09:22.248 --> 02:09:24.549]  I mean, it's called burnout.
[02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:30.751]  And it's not even the work that burns me out.
[02:09:31.972 --> 02:09:40.015]  It's the anger that I can't do enough, or that I can't track all the lies, or that I can't articulate the picture I see.
[02:09:40.115 --> 02:09:45.758]  I cannot impress upon you how serious all of this is.
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:56.327]  I mean, I'm up late at night video editing, and I have had no rest from relaxation, and I just ask myself, why am I doing this?
[02:09:57.549 --> 02:10:10.161]  At a certain point, I mean, I'm driven to fight the new world order, but at a certain point, I just, I caught myself the last year, kind of the creeping first stages of this,
[02:10:11.011 --> 02:10:22.897]  Used to I'd have a big giant stack of horrible news, horrible things the New World Order was doing, horrible things they're doing to people, the abuse they're doing, just total evidence of lies and criminality.
[02:10:26.039 --> 02:10:33.622]  And I would almost relish exposing them and here's more evidence and there's more evidence and just piling it on top of pile.
[02:10:34.743 --> 02:10:38.765]  And I think at a certain point I'm like a prosecutor that's put on a prosecution
[02:10:39.548 --> 02:10:45.332]  I mean, I have the accused on video, you know, chopping up their victims before they eat them.
[02:10:46.033 --> 02:10:53.699]  I mean, why should I keep having to put on a prosecution when it's totally documented?
[02:10:53.739 --> 02:11:08.250]  I mean, now obviously, there's new listeners, most people don't know the truth, most people are in self-denial, they are in willful ignorance, they consciously decide to denial this, and maybe
[02:11:09.355 --> 02:11:10.978]  You know, maybe they know something I don't know.
[02:11:11.018 --> 02:11:12.821]  Maybe something's wrong with me.
[02:11:13.482 --> 02:11:17.509]  Maybe Tommy Thompson going around saying every child needs a microchip is good.
[02:11:17.549 --> 02:11:20.093]  Maybe the Supreme Court saying there's no private property is good.
[02:11:20.694 --> 02:11:23.179]  Maybe police wearing skulls on their hats.
[02:11:24.028 --> 02:11:29.851]  You know, stomping around, grabbing old ladies' guns, and dragging old men out of houses by their hair.
[02:11:30.411 --> 02:11:31.291]  Maybe it's good.
[02:11:31.711 --> 02:11:33.872]  Maybe cancer viruses are good.
[02:11:34.092 --> 02:11:35.113]  Maybe cancer is good.
[02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.713]  Maybe the government giving it to us is good.
[02:11:37.214 --> 02:11:40.455]  Maybe DynCorp murdering people and kidnapping is good.
[02:11:41.315 --> 02:11:43.616]  Maybe bombing and slaughtering Iraqis is good.
[02:11:43.656 --> 02:11:45.457]  Maybe using DU is good.
[02:11:45.517 --> 02:11:47.718]  Maybe all of this is good.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.842]  I mean, seriously folks, I've got a giant stack.
[02:11:52.882 --> 02:11:58.627]  I spent hours last night researching this and reading this and printing this off, and it's a phenomenon.
[02:11:59.187 --> 02:12:02.490]  I read it, I research it, I get on air, I don't cover most of it.
[02:12:06.914 --> 02:12:10.216]  Because I just get sick of looking at it.
[02:12:13.599 --> 02:12:17.962]  It's basically like inspecting a rotten corpse with maggots coming out of it.
[02:12:19.289 --> 02:12:22.512]  I gotta tell you, I don't know how some of you out there are still in denial.
[02:12:23.212 --> 02:12:33.241]  I mean, there are actual people who will walk up to me at the grocery store and aggressively slap their hand down on my shoulder and go, where are the black helicopters, Alex?
[02:12:34.282 --> 02:12:35.843]  And you know, used to I'd want to punch them.
[02:12:36.184 --> 02:12:37.065]  And I'd argue with them.
[02:12:37.085 --> 02:12:39.547]  Now I just shuffle off, literally.
[02:12:39.847 --> 02:12:40.988]  I'm kind of hunched over.
[02:12:41.048 --> 02:12:43.290]  I just shuffle off away from them.
[02:12:44.246 --> 02:12:46.548]  I mean, I see the propaganda clearer than ever.
[02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:47.810]  It's just all over the place.
[02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:50.372]  It's like too much information, folks.
[02:12:50.392 --> 02:12:52.615]  It's like my brain is just blasted with it.
[02:12:54.577 --> 02:12:59.382]  And, uh... Now, I'm not going to lie to you, I get nauseated.
[02:13:00.263 --> 02:13:06.790]  When I start thinking about the New World Order, when I start focusing on it, I just... I just want to cry.
[02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.334]  Well, none of us are safe.
[02:13:10.655 --> 02:13:11.735]  I can't stop fighting them.
[02:13:12.176 --> 02:13:12.856]  None of us can.
[02:13:12.896 --> 02:13:15.458]  I mean, they're going to do horrible things to us.
[02:13:15.779 --> 02:13:18.941]  And the sick thing is, we feel bad fighting them.
[02:13:19.001 --> 02:13:20.262]  We get burnt out fighting them.
[02:13:20.282 --> 02:13:22.684]  You know, they say the devil will wear out the saints.
[02:13:23.779 --> 02:13:25.320]  And the globalists just love it.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.981]  They love doing evil.
[02:13:27.021 --> 02:13:29.242]  They love killing innocent people.
[02:13:29.602 --> 02:13:35.185]  They love having genetic engineered clones in their subterranean bases that have no rights.
[02:13:35.606 --> 02:13:38.587]  And then putting articles about it in the newspaper and saying it's good.
[02:13:39.128 --> 02:13:46.212]  They love knowing that Prozac and Ritalin cause brain shrinkage and heart palpitations and are killing people.
[02:13:46.652 --> 02:13:47.692]  They just love it.
[02:13:47.932 --> 02:13:48.693]  I don't understand
[02:13:50.024 --> 02:13:51.465]  It's one of the mysteries of the world.
[02:13:52.305 --> 02:13:54.506]  Why does God let evil get away with this?
[02:13:55.146 --> 02:13:57.847]  And how does evil enjoy it so much?
[02:13:58.507 --> 02:14:00.548]  Just looking at the evil makes me sick.
[02:14:02.369 --> 02:14:03.609]  And I'm not a wimp, folks.
[02:14:04.730 --> 02:14:10.952]  I've been a pretty hard, worldly person before I started fighting the New World Order.
[02:14:10.992 --> 02:14:14.993]  And even over the years I was fighting it, it was kind of a process of becoming more
[02:14:19.150 --> 02:14:20.311]  I don't know what the term is.
[02:14:25.074 --> 02:14:28.776]  I'm totally dedicated to this fight and I cannot stop what I'm doing.
[02:14:29.717 --> 02:14:33.980]  But at the same time, I don't know if I'm doing the best job anymore.
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:35.921]  To be frank with people.
[02:14:39.203 --> 02:14:39.623]  I don't know.
[02:14:41.064 --> 02:14:41.705]  I just don't know.
[02:14:43.626 --> 02:14:46.488]  And I know it's not all up to me and I know you're out there doing great things.
[02:14:48.459 --> 02:14:50.360]  I guess it's the fallen nature of man.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:51.780]  I just am saddened by it.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.181]  And I mean, folks, we really are fallen.
[02:14:54.221 --> 02:14:58.382]  That isn't... People like to joke about it and go, oh, that's those idiots in the Bible saying that.
[02:14:58.422 --> 02:14:59.983]  But it's true.
[02:15:00.063 --> 02:15:03.704]  I mean, we are a despicable species.
[02:15:04.544 --> 02:15:06.685]  We do despicable things.
[02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:09.846]  We just are perverted.
[02:15:10.946 --> 02:15:15.188]  And by perverted, I don't even mean in the classical sense you think of as, you know, i.e.
[02:15:15.268 --> 02:15:15.668]  sexual.
[02:15:16.306 --> 02:15:20.389]  Perverted just means sticking your hand in a blender, folks, is perverted.
[02:15:21.150 --> 02:15:25.093]  Chopping your arms and legs off because it's a form of body art is perverted.
[02:15:25.454 --> 02:15:27.795]  It's perverted against what the species is supposed to be.
[02:15:29.857 --> 02:15:36.923]  Revelling in lies, being a coward, lying down to corruption, being stupid is perverted.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:42.948]  And I've seen the destroyers of nations.
[02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:46.556]  And it is sloth and arrogance and self-centered.
[02:15:47.356 --> 02:15:47.997]  Greed.
[02:15:49.777 --> 02:15:52.338]  And again, greed isn't liking things, folks.
[02:15:52.419 --> 02:15:53.699]  Greed is putting it first.
[02:15:54.139 --> 02:15:56.240]  Greed is doing anything for things.
[02:15:57.381 --> 02:15:59.661]  Greed is having our priorities screwed up.
[02:16:00.922 --> 02:16:04.123]  And again, we've all lost the meaning of language, so how do we even communicate?
[02:16:04.563 --> 02:16:08.705]  I'm like a gibbering idiot compared to some of our forefathers.
[02:16:11.626 --> 02:16:12.887]  And I know we've got loaded phones.
[02:16:14.153 --> 02:16:16.334]  Daryl's been holding from Louisiana for eons.
[02:16:16.354 --> 02:16:22.037]  We'll go to you after the break and we'll go to Tim and Mike and many others.
[02:16:22.257 --> 02:16:30.862]  I just... I just can't believe how fathomless the New World Order is.
[02:16:30.902 --> 02:16:38.026]  They are so dark and so deep in their evil and their hatred of freedom.
[02:16:38.626 --> 02:16:39.667]  They hate love.
[02:16:39.727 --> 02:16:40.627]  They hate beauty.
[02:16:41.068 --> 02:16:41.968]  They hate you.
[02:16:42.048 --> 02:16:43.209]  They want to kill you.
[02:16:44.366 --> 02:17:02.753]  I have total evidence of it and then it's considered to be upright and mainstream and progressive and cool to be cloistered and small minded and to go along to get along and to basically be a compliant sheep.
[02:17:04.854 --> 02:17:07.175]  And I mean if that makes you happy then so be it.
[02:17:08.556 --> 02:17:15.162]  But I mean, it doesn't, just because you deny reality doesn't mean reality isn't still there staring back at you.
[02:17:16.483 --> 02:17:30.696]  And I am just awed by the dark majesty, that's what Tex Mars calls it, dark majesty of the New World Order.
[02:17:30.776 --> 02:17:33.819]  I mean, it is just, it is a machine.
[02:17:34.565 --> 02:17:36.247]  Meant to chew your guts out!
[02:17:36.727 --> 02:17:38.909]  And you're sitting around giggling and laughing about it?
[02:17:42.673 --> 02:17:45.016]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[02:17:45.536 --> 02:17:47.999]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[02:17:48.739 --> 02:17:52.403]  Moedis Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[02:17:53.144 --> 02:17:54.645]  It includes the history of U.S.
[02:17:54.705 --> 02:17:55.106]  coins.
[02:17:55.814 --> 02:17:57.115]  The actual mintages.
[02:17:57.615 --> 02:17:58.796]  The grading standards.
[02:17:59.396 --> 02:18:01.078]  Learn the stability of real money.
[02:18:01.498 --> 02:18:03.539]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[02:18:03.939 --> 02:18:05.460]  They are instruments of debt.
[02:18:05.721 --> 02:18:07.802]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[02:18:08.362 --> 02:18:12.405]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.
[02:18:12.425 --> 02:18:13.646]  Call Midas today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:21.838 --> 02:18:22.499]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:28.046]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[02:18:28.607 --> 02:18:30.389]  Get the 2006 Red Buck.
[02:18:30.970 --> 02:18:32.852]  Help steer your own financial ship.
[02:18:33.453 --> 02:18:34.254]  Call Midas now.
[02:18:34.274 --> 02:18:34.334]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.841 --> 02:18:45.123]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:49.346]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:49.606 --> 02:18:52.408]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:52.588 --> 02:18:54.989]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:55.189 --> 02:19:03.834]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:04.015 --> 02:19:05.355]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:19:05.555 --> 02:19:09.718]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:09.778 --> 02:19:10.479]  We're good to go!
[02:19:29.062 --> 02:19:29.643]  We're good to go.
[02:19:42.494 --> 02:19:44.996]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.516 --> 02:19:52.601]  Did you know that Bible Prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[02:19:53.462 --> 02:19:59.106]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[02:19:59.806 --> 02:20:03.249]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible Prophecy.
[02:20:03.929 --> 02:20:13.613]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:46.677]  Janet from JLS Research has been preparing a revolutionary new product.
[02:20:46.797 --> 02:20:49.919]  Listeners have been having tremendous success with No B.O.
[02:20:50.039 --> 02:20:55.103]  Now Janet would like to introduce to you her new product, like the Sweet Smell of Success Lotion Bar.
[02:20:55.203 --> 02:20:58.906]  Lotion bars are simply a lotion made into a solid bar rather than a liquid.
[02:20:58.946 --> 02:21:02.289]  You guys that are opposed to lotion bottles, this handmade bar is just for you.
[02:21:02.449 --> 02:21:02.749]  I think so.
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:26.041]  We're good to go.
[02:21:44.665 --> 02:21:45.125]  Don't worry.
[02:21:45.625 --> 02:21:47.145]  This show is documented.
[02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:50.426]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:50.826 --> 02:21:54.347]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:54.787 --> 02:21:58.928]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:21:59.388 --> 02:22:04.309]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:22:04.589 --> 02:22:05.909]  The ring of fire.
[02:22:05.949 --> 02:22:10.530]  I mean, one example of all this is Dimecore in 2000.
[02:22:12.239 --> 02:22:14.060]  They got a big base officer in Austin.
[02:22:14.381 --> 02:22:15.221]  They changed the name.
[02:22:16.002 --> 02:22:18.003]  Kidnapped 200,000 women and children.
[02:22:19.625 --> 02:22:22.767]  And sold them to slave brothels all over the Middle East and Asia.
[02:22:23.528 --> 02:22:25.109]  And it came out in the foreign news.
[02:22:25.189 --> 02:22:25.909]  It was admitted.
[02:22:26.410 --> 02:22:27.571]  They were convicted in court.
[02:22:27.711 --> 02:22:28.731]  Nobody got in trouble.
[02:22:30.032 --> 02:22:33.975]  But then the news will tear their hair out talking about one child who's been kidnapped.
[02:22:34.376 --> 02:22:37.318]  Meanwhile, we have a company that gets all the big Iraq contracts.
[02:22:38.279 --> 02:22:40.760]  Who's one of their main jobs is kidnapping children.
[02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:41.421]  I mean, you know,
[02:22:42.521 --> 02:22:43.601]  That type of evil!
[02:22:43.741 --> 02:22:45.002]  Something that big!
[02:22:45.022 --> 02:22:49.063]  I mean, you trust a government that's involved with people that do stuff like this?
[02:22:49.143 --> 02:22:56.025]  I mean... We're gonna go to Tim and Mike and Jesse and Russell and everybody else.
[02:22:56.105 --> 02:22:58.766]  First up is Elizabeth from Maryland, then we'll go to Tim.
[02:22:59.206 --> 02:23:00.247]  Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[02:23:00.287 --> 02:23:00.687]  Go ahead.
[02:23:01.392 --> 02:23:01.933]  Hi, Alex.
[02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:04.194]  Great interview with Michael Meacher.
[02:23:04.614 --> 02:23:12.280]  I only wonder why he doesn't perceive that the other possible outcome, the other order, will be the UN.
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:20.125]  And today I heard on the Genesis Network that the Blackwater Group, the mercenaries down in New Orleans, are really an NGO.
[02:23:20.165 --> 02:23:23.428]  They're connected with a non-governmental organization under the UN.
[02:23:24.108 --> 02:23:29.552]  And so we can see this comes out of, I believe, Democracy Now!
[02:23:30.132 --> 02:23:48.976]  Anyway, in addition to that, your point that you've been making about all this, the preparation for it, there was another caller today on Genesis, and you'll want to look into this to see if this clip can be found, whether anyone else heard it, that our Vice President said of Katrina, quote, we're still working through that exercise.
[02:23:49.196 --> 02:23:50.336]  Isn't that interesting, Alex?
[02:23:51.137 --> 02:23:52.017]  Oh, he did say that.
[02:23:52.357 --> 02:23:52.997]  Did he say that?
[02:23:54.252 --> 02:23:55.733]  Wow, that's what we heard.
[02:23:55.813 --> 02:24:01.215]  Now the other point that I wanted to make was from my book, Patriots Warning One, America Attacked.
[02:24:01.535 --> 02:24:13.940]  When I was hearing Michael Meacher, Margaret Atwood, the noted author, said that Animal Farm and all of the books like George Orwell's 1984, they had really made an effect on her.
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:16.161]  And this is what she said about 1984, quote,
[02:24:18.226 --> 02:24:21.430]  The government of Airstrip One, Winston's country, is brutal.
[02:24:21.490 --> 02:24:33.083]  The constant surveillance, the impossibility of speaking frankly to anyone, the looming ominous figure of Big Brother, the regime's need for enemies and wars to terrify the people and unite them.
[02:24:33.423 --> 02:24:38.409]  And Alex, I think your destiny is a very great one, to keep warning people.
[02:24:39.049 --> 02:24:41.031]  And God will not be mocked.
[02:24:41.392 --> 02:24:42.513]  He knows what we're doing.
[02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:51.823]  And I want to leave your listeners with a story that Colonel Craig Roberts told very quickly when he was going to Vietnam, down in the Ozarks, talking to his grandfather.
[02:24:51.843 --> 02:24:55.747]  And his grandfather said, son, I know you're worried that you might get killed over there.
[02:24:56.067 --> 02:25:00.630]  But I want you to know that the Lord will not take you until He's ready for you.
[02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:09.977]  And Al Cuppett, my relative, he may not be as incisive as you were on the USS Liberty, but his book, America Sold Out, is pretty fantastic.
[02:25:10.537 --> 02:25:12.919]  Al wrote to me when I was initially afraid.
[02:25:12.939 --> 02:25:17.902]  I am ashamed to admit I was afraid, but he wrote, Fear only complicates things.
[02:25:18.222 --> 02:25:21.244]  Be found doing what the Lord has asked you to do.
[02:25:21.364 --> 02:25:21.925]  Absolutely.
[02:25:21.985 --> 02:25:23.145]  Thanks for the call, Elizabeth.
[02:25:23.546 --> 02:25:24.506]  Very eloquent words.
[02:25:25.527 --> 02:25:26.727]  I don't whine on air.
[02:25:27.468 --> 02:25:32.770]  I was mainly just trying to describe a phenomenon.
[02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:48.235]  A phenomenon of just, at a certain point, I mean, describing every wart and scale on this New World Order crocodile just... But no, I know we've got to continue describing it.
[02:25:48.275 --> 02:25:49.776]  We've got to continue documenting it.
[02:25:49.816 --> 02:25:52.057]  Because a lot of people are still in denial.
[02:25:52.077 --> 02:25:52.837]  But I say to them,
[02:25:54.013 --> 02:25:57.054]  That is some incredible mental gymnastics to be in denial.
[02:25:58.035 --> 02:26:00.596]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Florida.
[02:26:00.616 --> 02:26:01.276]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:26:02.996 --> 02:26:05.057]  Alex, you're doing a great job.
[02:26:05.357 --> 02:26:06.558]  My prayers are with you.
[02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:14.861]  And when you lay down at night to sleep, I pray that you sleep in Green Pastures.
[02:26:15.421 --> 02:26:16.662]  Like the Lord's Prayer says.
[02:26:18.642 --> 02:26:22.644]  I want to comment about this Cherkov dude.
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:31.402]  I believe he's a Bolshevik Communist.
[02:26:31.582 --> 02:26:32.683]  He's really bad news.
[02:26:32.763 --> 02:26:34.723]  I mean, to cover all the stuff he's involved in.
[02:26:35.083 --> 02:26:40.526]  Well, he's also been involved in defending and helping SNL swindlers.
[02:26:40.926 --> 02:26:42.847]  That's why he's near and dear to the Bush's heart.
[02:26:44.287 --> 02:26:45.388]  I have a document.
[02:26:46.188 --> 02:26:47.368]  I think it's March 9, 1935.
[02:26:47.649 --> 02:26:48.409]  A newspaper.
[02:26:54.309 --> 02:27:20.622]  million people died of starvation by the Bolshevik government well the example to that would be FEMA turning away the food and water from the people in New Orleans run by Chertoff who is orchestrated by Bush who is orchestrated by the Queen of England
[02:27:21.109 --> 02:27:23.831]  Who is orchestrated also by David Rockefeller.
[02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:25.052]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:27:25.072 --> 02:27:26.573]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:27:27.073 --> 02:27:28.454]  Tons of news in your call.
[02:27:28.514 --> 02:27:28.995]  Stay with us.
[02:27:32.097 --> 02:27:32.998]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.498 --> 02:27:35.099]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:38.702]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.781 --> 02:27:45.144]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[02:29:41.707 --> 02:29:44.750]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:46.771]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[02:29:46.991 --> 02:29:50.634]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:29:50.934 --> 02:29:56.799]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:29:56.919 --> 02:30:02.904]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:30:03.204 --> 02:30:06.906]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:30:07.066 --> 02:30:11.889]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:17.053]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.

[02:30:19.834 --> 02:30:22.716]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[02:30:22.936 --> 02:30:23.737]  For those that don't know,
[02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:57.193]  Michael Chertoff is a truly evil creature.
[02:30:57.733 --> 02:31:01.196]  And I've spent hour after hour researching him.
[02:31:01.816 --> 02:31:04.218]  The rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.
[02:31:05.598 --> 02:31:13.403]  But yeah, he's been involved in all sorts of scams and real estate manipulations and that's why the globalists love him is they got plenty of dirt on him.
[02:31:15.164 --> 02:31:20.608]  But since he became the Chief Deputy of the Justice Department in the first Bush administration,
[02:31:21.707 --> 02:31:35.450]  Under John Ashcroft, he's the guy that continued to try to put patriots and Christians and conservatives on these FBI lists and on these training manuals and he's anti-gun.
[02:31:35.470 --> 02:31:37.931]  I mean, he's just a horrible individual.
[02:31:38.811 --> 02:31:46.153]  And then his cousin, Benjamin Chertoff, wrote this horrible hit piece on myself and others for Popular Mechanics.
[02:31:48.453 --> 02:31:50.494]  And literally, when I first talked to Chertoff,
[02:31:52.397 --> 02:31:55.979]  He sounded like such a blithering idiot, that is his cousin.
[02:31:56.459 --> 02:32:01.521]  I called the editor at the Popular Mechanics and I said, are you really doing a cover story?
[02:32:01.541 --> 02:32:11.285]  Because, by the way, I've never called a radio station, never called a TV station, never called, say, the Washington Post and said, is this really one of your reporters I talked to?
[02:32:11.985 --> 02:32:14.606]  But they were so unprofessional, so pathetic.
[02:32:15.607 --> 02:32:16.367]  Chertoff was.
[02:32:17.176 --> 02:32:21.300]  That I actually called Popular Mechanics and I said, is this real?
[02:32:22.261 --> 02:32:24.323]  And they said, oh yes, this is a real cover story.
[02:32:26.565 --> 02:32:28.047]  And oh no, it's not a hit piece.
[02:32:28.207 --> 02:32:29.288]  Oh no, Mr. Jones.
[02:32:29.828 --> 02:32:30.949]  Very friendly piece.
[02:32:33.172 --> 02:32:37.536]  And every time I document something for them, they would just move on to something else.
[02:32:38.729 --> 02:32:47.314]  Then they would use people that I've never interviewed or I've never talked to and use what they've said and then they call someone up and say, were you interviewed by this person?
[02:32:47.894 --> 02:32:50.895]  They go, well of course I wasn't when they were interviewed by somebody else.
[02:32:50.915 --> 02:33:00.200]  I mean it was just... You talk about a con job folks, but the average person reads that and I guess some of them believe it.
[02:33:01.881 --> 02:33:03.562]  You know that's the thing about hit pieces.
[02:33:03.782 --> 02:33:05.283]  I mean somebody can say
[02:33:07.236 --> 02:33:09.337]  It's like the ADL's lost a bunch of lawsuits.
[02:33:09.377 --> 02:33:10.557]  Not a bunch, a couple of them.
[02:33:11.217 --> 02:33:16.298]  Because... But now they're in a bunch of lawsuits after they lost these two.
[02:33:17.538 --> 02:33:23.920]  If it's big business and they want to demonize somebody for an interest, they will just say they're anti-Semitic.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:24.820]  No evidence of it.
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:27.941]  Because that hurts their market share.
[02:33:28.041 --> 02:33:29.081]  That hurts them in business.
[02:33:29.841 --> 02:33:32.222]  Now, popular mechanics didn't say that about me.
[02:33:33.055 --> 02:33:40.599]  You know, they just basically fabricated a straw man of things that I had never said or done and then attacked that straw man.
[02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:42.740]  And that's what they do.
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.021]  And it's despicable.
[02:33:46.922 --> 02:34:01.449]  But really, anybody who's got a brain cell left in their head has gotten to where when they hear the mainstream media attacking somebody, they automatically think, wait a minute, what's the agenda here?
[02:34:02.339 --> 02:34:04.059]  I digress off into Chertoff.
[02:34:04.579 --> 02:34:06.340]  You know, you talk about all the dead there.
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:25.183]  I mean, it's totally provable, and has been proven, manifestly, as Ann Coulter likes to say, that they did a horrible job in New Orleans, by design.
[02:34:26.283 --> 02:34:27.323]  They didn't screw up.
[02:34:28.704 --> 02:34:30.744]  And as the bodies are recovered, reports
[02:34:31.801 --> 02:34:38.866]  are now coming out that reporters are being told no photos, no stories, despite a federal judge saying they can't do that.
[02:34:39.907 --> 02:34:49.593]  A long caravan of white vans led by the Army Humvee rolled Monday through New Orleans Bywater District, the poor, mostly black neighborhood northeast of the French Quarter.
[02:34:50.254 --> 02:34:57.519]  And because it makes the government look bad, no video, no photos, recovery team members wearing white protective suits and black boots
[02:34:58.366 --> 02:35:05.288]  Stopped at the houses with spray-painted markings on the doors designating where dead bodies laid.
[02:35:06.689 --> 02:35:24.254]  Outside one house, on Kentucky Street, a member of the Army 82nd Airborne Division summoned a reporter and photographer standing nearby and told them that if they took pictures or wrote a story about the body recovery process, he would take away their press credentials and kick them out of the state.
[02:35:25.914 --> 02:35:29.497]  That's what we fought for in all these wars so the troops could order us around.
[02:35:29.517 --> 02:35:34.660]  This is all a dress rehearsal for martial law and it makes me so sad.
[02:35:36.481 --> 02:35:41.125]  No photos, no stories, said the man wearing camouflage fatigues and a red beret.
[02:35:42.165 --> 02:35:44.107]  You see, you heard that they backed off of this.
[02:35:44.147 --> 02:35:44.947]  They haven't backed off.
[02:35:45.408 --> 02:35:47.369]  I have a stack of articles here today.
[02:35:48.030 --> 02:35:51.512]  A stack of dirty, painful articles.
[02:35:51.612 --> 02:35:52.913]  I don't even want to get mad about it.
[02:35:53.553 --> 02:35:54.214]  It makes me sick.
[02:35:56.044 --> 02:36:02.068]  Where they're taking the guns, and man, the FBI, the BATF, the troops, it is a hay day.
[02:36:02.128 --> 02:36:03.568]  They are getting off on it.
[02:36:05.610 --> 02:36:07.591]  They are demon possessed, folks.
[02:36:08.491 --> 02:36:15.055]  And in the final equation, it just... You're scum!
[02:36:15.115 --> 02:36:17.036]  I mean, our government is scum!
[02:36:19.338 --> 02:36:22.840]  And maybe some of the troops aren't bad, some of the cops aren't bad, but they're still scum!
[02:36:24.435 --> 02:36:28.678]  I mean, you know, you've heard the example of something bad in a punch bowl.
[02:36:28.738 --> 02:36:30.720]  I mean, the punch is ruined.
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:33.802]  There's so many bad apples in the barrel.
[02:36:35.403 --> 02:36:37.084]  Let me give you a less gross analogy.
[02:36:37.124 --> 02:36:40.346]  Let's say you had a barrel full of 100 apples.
[02:36:41.187 --> 02:36:43.369]  And 80 of them had maggots coming out of them.
[02:36:44.810 --> 02:36:48.592]  And a bunch of rotten pig blood had been dumped on it.
[02:36:49.173 --> 02:36:52.295]  Now, if you're not starving to death, you're not going to eat the 20 apples that are good.
[02:36:53.795 --> 02:36:54.675]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:36:54.696 --> 02:36:56.336]  I mean, yeah, a few bad apples?
[02:36:56.416 --> 02:36:57.297]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:36:57.517 --> 02:37:00.358]  You've got a bunch of rotten apples and a bunch of rotten poison.
[02:37:00.899 --> 02:37:02.620]  And yeah, are there some good apples in there?
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:02.960]  Yeah.
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:04.420]  But they're ineffectual.
[02:37:04.521 --> 02:37:05.961]  They're just in there.
[02:37:08.082 --> 02:37:12.385]  And the sick thing about all these evil people is that they think they're good, most of them.
[02:37:13.025 --> 02:37:18.768]  They think that it's all about shoving us around and screaming at us and stomping on us.
[02:37:18.848 --> 02:37:20.249]  It's just sick.
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:25.721]  I mean, how safe do you think you are, cops, when you bring forward a world like this?
[02:37:26.101 --> 02:37:28.062]  What do you think you're leaving your children, you idiots?
[02:37:28.922 --> 02:37:34.744]  The government you work for is openly passing laws to take your pension funds, to take your private property.
[02:37:35.744 --> 02:37:37.725]  We're going to be dispossessed.
[02:37:37.845 --> 02:37:40.106]  We're going to be really brought down.
[02:37:40.126 --> 02:37:40.706]  Okay?
[02:37:41.166 --> 02:37:42.726]  This is all just set in the table.
[02:37:43.167 --> 02:37:45.007]  They haven't started having the main feast.
[02:37:45.307 --> 02:37:46.748]  They haven't even had hors d'oeuvres yet.
[02:37:46.968 --> 02:37:48.548]  They haven't even had the appetizer.
[02:37:49.729 --> 02:37:51.069]  They haven't had the antipasta.
[02:37:52.273 --> 02:37:54.054]  They haven't even had a glass of wine yet.
[02:37:55.475 --> 02:38:05.801]  And yes, the people that set the table for Hitler, the people that set the table for Mao, the social engineers that set the table for Stalin, they are setting the table now.
[02:38:06.121 --> 02:38:08.842]  And it makes me sick.
[02:38:10.843 --> 02:38:12.064]  And it makes me angry.
[02:38:13.925 --> 02:38:18.408]  And I got reports here where they're making money off of
[02:38:22.685 --> 02:38:23.606]  Off of the dead bodies.
[02:38:27.169 --> 02:38:33.514]  FEMA, Louisiana, outsourced Katrina body count to a firm implicated in body dumping scandals.
[02:38:33.534 --> 02:38:34.695]  Let's settle the raw story.
[02:38:35.496 --> 02:38:49.248]  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has hired Kenton International to set up a mobile morgue for handling bodies in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, following Hurricane Katrina.
[02:38:51.289 --> 02:38:58.831]  And the company is a subsidiary of Service Corporation International, a scandal-ridden Texas-based company operated by a friend of the Bush family.
[02:38:59.311 --> 02:39:07.073]  Recently, SCI subsidiaries have been implicated in illegally discarding and dealing with corpses.
[02:39:08.493 --> 02:39:10.094]  Desecrating corpses is what it says.
[02:39:10.494 --> 02:39:18.256]  Louisiana Governor Katrina says Katrina, you know, victims subsequently
[02:39:19.505 --> 02:39:23.748]  I've been irked by a contract, and it goes on and on.
[02:39:27.191 --> 02:39:32.855]  Here's another one out of the Times-Picayune, and every time I say that, ten people call up and say I'm mispronouncing it.
[02:39:33.256 --> 02:39:34.877]  Look, I don't speak French, alright?
[02:39:38.159 --> 02:39:42.423]  Around here, we call men Chaka, an Indian named Street Manshak.
[02:39:44.104 --> 02:39:44.444]  Alright?
[02:39:45.805 --> 02:39:46.766]  I went to public school.
[02:39:46.826 --> 02:39:47.807]  I'm lucky I can talk.
[02:39:51.485 --> 02:40:07.516]  Mystery surrounds flood wall breaches, and it goes on to talk about how it's a big mystery, and people don't know why they broke, and shouldn't have broken, and some people think it was blown up.
[02:40:08.877 --> 02:40:17.442]  There's a bunch of others, but Tim, if you're still there, you brought up this whole thing about this ghoul.
[02:40:17.543 --> 02:40:19.544]  I mean, he just looks like a ghoul.
[02:40:21.118 --> 02:40:27.920]  And I don't go off how people look, but I mean, you know, when the cover of the book fits, the inside, you know, let the shoe fits wear it.
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:29.701]  By the way, you had more you wanted to say.
[02:40:29.721 --> 02:40:30.101]  Go ahead.
[02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:33.942]  Well, there's demons around us everywhere.
[02:40:34.703 --> 02:40:40.905]  And when we expose the truth, the demons attack more and more and more.
[02:40:41.885 --> 02:40:47.687]  That prayer, like the walls of Jericho, when they marched around the walls of Jericho,
[02:40:48.593 --> 02:40:53.336]  And they sang, and they praised the Lord Jesus, Lord God.
[02:40:54.037 --> 02:40:54.937]  The walls fell.
[02:40:55.658 --> 02:40:57.199]  One by one, they fell.
[02:40:57.739 --> 02:40:59.860]  We have to have faith.
[02:41:00.461 --> 02:41:01.461]  1000% faith.
[02:41:01.862 --> 02:41:07.645]  You know, the evil ones, they have 1000% faith in Lucifer.
[02:41:08.386 --> 02:41:09.306]  That is their God.
[02:41:09.827 --> 02:41:13.489]  Albert Pike stated it in 1889 in Paris, France.
[02:41:13.989 --> 02:41:15.310]  Yes, Lucifer is God.
[02:41:16.231 --> 02:41:17.632]  And the Scottish Rite
[02:41:18.442 --> 02:41:19.303]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:41:47.449 --> 02:41:55.593]  David Rockefeller, the United Nations, 777, street address, United Nations, the genocide in Rwanda.
[02:41:57.113 --> 02:42:00.915]  David Rockefeller, he returned 88 years old that year.
[02:42:00.935 --> 02:42:07.038]  In the movie, Lawn Mower Man, how that dude was dyslexic.
[02:42:08.098 --> 02:42:10.199]  David Rockefeller is dyslexic.
[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:16.882]  Well, I think David Rockefeller has something to do with what is happening
[02:42:18.989 --> 02:42:20.329]  Listen, I appreciate the call.
[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:22.590]  I gotta move on to other callers.
[02:42:25.151 --> 02:42:27.172]  You think David Rockefeller has something to do with it?
[02:42:27.632 --> 02:42:29.393]  Well, I mean, you can just go to his own book.
[02:42:30.214 --> 02:42:31.534]  What's the last book he put out?
[02:42:31.574 --> 02:42:32.375]  I forget the name.
[02:42:32.415 --> 02:42:33.975]  It's his autobiography.
[02:42:35.696 --> 02:42:36.797]  I've actually got a copy.
[02:42:36.817 --> 02:42:37.597]  Somebody sent it to me.
[02:42:37.617 --> 02:42:42.039]  But I saw him on C-SPAN about two years ago when it came out.
[02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:44.400]  And he said, yeah, world government's real.
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:45.481]  We're setting up a world government.
[02:42:47.179 --> 02:42:57.823]  In this book, he says, there are some conspiracy theorists who believe that I have been in and around a movement to set up a world government for most of my adult life, and that we are near building this world government.
[02:42:58.203 --> 02:43:00.704]  And I would say that, essentially, they are correct.
[02:43:01.464 --> 02:43:02.225]  That's a paraphrase.
[02:43:02.285 --> 02:43:03.365]  It's almost word for word.
[02:43:04.606 --> 02:43:05.446]  But, yeah.
[02:43:06.426 --> 02:43:08.987]  And then people... It's like Albert Pike.
[02:43:09.707 --> 02:43:13.669]  Almost every Masonic hall has a picture of Albert Pike in it.
[02:43:15.149 --> 02:43:16.709]  And you ask Masons, who is that?
[02:43:16.729 --> 02:43:17.610]  That's Albert Pike.
[02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:18.870]  Well, you worship Lucifer.
[02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:19.610]  Well, no we don't.
[02:43:19.650 --> 02:43:20.630]  We worship God.
[02:43:21.170 --> 02:43:22.591]  I go, oh, what degree are you?
[02:43:23.491 --> 02:43:27.132]  You know, you're a mid-level Mason, but you haven't even read the big book.
[02:43:27.712 --> 02:43:31.533]  You don't even know why you got a picture of Albert Pike hanging up.
[02:43:32.793 --> 02:43:33.853]  The Supreme Grand Mason.
[02:43:35.193 --> 02:43:36.974]  I mean, his published book.
[02:43:38.814 --> 02:43:39.434]  His book.
[02:43:39.554 --> 02:43:40.134]  You can buy it.
[02:43:40.154 --> 02:43:42.335]  It's like a hundred bucks on
[02:43:43.664 --> 02:43:48.486]  Amazon for some reason to buy a new one, but you can find used ones in old bookstores for like five dollars.
[02:43:48.506 --> 02:43:49.286]  They don't know what they got.
[02:43:49.787 --> 02:43:51.967]  Or at estate sales, all these old Masons dying.
[02:43:52.207 --> 02:43:54.228]  There'll be rules and dogma everywhere.
[02:43:54.648 --> 02:43:57.330]  I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[02:43:57.770 --> 02:43:58.930]  Oh, there's only one God.
[02:43:58.970 --> 02:43:59.690]  It is Lucifer.
[02:44:00.331 --> 02:44:05.573]  And I don't want to get emails from Masons saying, you know, just put your own founder
[02:44:06.295 --> 02:44:12.637]  You know, one of your current founders, one of your icons, says it's Lucifer, and your own books say it's Lucifer.
[02:44:13.017 --> 02:44:14.657]  I'm not going to sit here and argue with you.
[02:44:15.418 --> 02:44:19.259]  And David Rockefeller says, we're building a one world government.
[02:44:20.259 --> 02:44:22.059]  We're going to take your rights away.
[02:44:22.359 --> 02:44:23.640]  You're going to be slaves.
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:25.920]  And I have to argue with people about it?
[02:44:29.782 --> 02:44:31.742]  The UN runs around saying they're going to kill us.
[02:44:31.802 --> 02:44:34.763]  I mean, I've got Henry Kissinger documents, but they talk about how they want to kill us.
[02:44:38.064 --> 02:44:40.826]  It's like debating whether Saddam was a threat.
[02:44:41.366 --> 02:44:44.388]  Bush's own people said he wasn't a threat in their own documents.
[02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:48.731]  And these are documents they publish.
[02:44:48.771 --> 02:44:50.212]  Understand, they write books.
[02:44:50.953 --> 02:44:55.476]  It isn't like I say I've got a document, and, well, you could fix that document.
[02:44:55.556 --> 02:44:56.076]  No, no, no.
[02:44:56.116 --> 02:44:58.818]  These are documents they put out.
[02:44:58.898 --> 02:45:00.159]  They will stand by them.
[02:45:02.975 --> 02:45:06.417]  Look, we are in trouble because we have had so much for so long.
[02:45:06.457 --> 02:45:15.824]  We have gotten decadent, we have gotten bloated, we have gotten lazy, we have become mesmerized by this situation, and it's going to be hell to pay.
[02:45:18.186 --> 02:45:23.449]  And the good news is people's eyes are opening up.
[02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:27.312]  The good news is people are aware of what's going on now.
[02:45:27.907 --> 02:45:31.658]  The good news is there is an awakening taking place.
[02:45:31.819 --> 02:45:33.083]  It is happening.
[02:45:35.054 --> 02:45:36.595]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:45:36.615 --> 02:45:37.095]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:45:37.115 --> 02:45:37.615]  Thanks for holding.
[02:45:37.895 --> 02:45:38.636]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:45:38.676 --> 02:45:39.556]  Great show, as always.
[02:45:39.676 --> 02:45:40.837]  I wanted to talk to you.
[02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:42.017]  Is it really a great show?
[02:45:42.337 --> 02:45:42.838]  Yeah, it's fabulous.
[02:45:42.858 --> 02:45:46.159]  Because I don't like... I mean, I don't think I'm doing anything special.
[02:45:46.179 --> 02:45:47.400]  I think you're doing something special.
[02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:49.120]  So please don't tell me great... You know what?
[02:45:49.521 --> 02:45:51.522]  You did a great job calling into this show, Mike.
[02:45:51.582 --> 02:45:51.942]  How's that?
[02:45:52.142 --> 02:45:52.902]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:45:52.942 --> 02:45:53.983]  But, you know, you are.
[02:45:54.003 --> 02:45:55.363]  You've just got to take two steps back.
[02:45:55.403 --> 02:45:58.825]  And I know you're a busy man, but you don't realize the work you've done and what you've put into it.
[02:45:58.865 --> 02:46:01.326]  The videos I've gotten from you and the response I've gotten from people.
[02:46:01.966 --> 02:46:03.047]  You are doing a great job.
[02:46:03.948 --> 02:46:12.094]  I wanted to talk to you mostly about what Louis Farrakhan said about that 25-foot crater that was on the local news here in Chicago.
[02:46:12.554 --> 02:46:13.414]  I'm sure you've heard about it.
[02:46:13.655 --> 02:46:17.357]  I just tuned into your show around 1 o'clock so you'll have to excuse me if I didn't know you already touched on it.
[02:46:18.478 --> 02:46:23.361]  Louis Farrakhan said there was a 25-foot crater by one of the levees, that there was an explosion.
[02:46:25.205 --> 02:46:35.074]  But the other thing I want to talk about, you said about allergies, Alex, and I was talking to a ton of people at my children's school, and everybody that I've talked to, including myself, and I've had allergies for about five years.
[02:46:35.254 --> 02:46:36.756]  No, nobody used to have them.
[02:46:36.776 --> 02:46:38.677]  A hundred years ago they didn't exist.
[02:46:38.737 --> 02:46:44.122]  Now everybody's got them, and I live in the capital of allergies, and they get worse and worse and worse.
[02:46:44.202 --> 02:46:46.845]  Worse and worse, and this is the worst I've ever had it this summer.
[02:46:47.505 --> 02:46:50.966]  I haven't slept for probably four weeks, and we've had a drought here.
[02:46:51.366 --> 02:46:52.627]  It rained really good last night.
[02:46:52.647 --> 02:46:55.808]  We got about an inch of rain here in the Chicago area, and it hasn't lightened up one bit.
[02:46:56.068 --> 02:46:56.988]  That's the thing.
[02:46:57.108 --> 02:47:02.250]  Always in the past, it flooded here three days ago, and it didn't get better.
[02:47:02.290 --> 02:47:03.050]  I've gotten worse.
[02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:05.291]  It's debilitating.
[02:47:05.851 --> 02:47:07.691]  I don't know what they're doing to us, but they're doing something.
[02:47:07.711 --> 02:47:08.692]  But they're doing something.
[02:47:08.732 --> 02:47:11.612]  In fact, all these studies are coming out going, it isn't the pollen.
[02:47:11.953 --> 02:47:13.233]  We don't know what's causing it.
[02:47:14.033 --> 02:47:16.254]  Yeah, it's pretty scary Alex, but you're doing a great job.
[02:47:16.454 --> 02:47:18.495]  But did you hear about this Lewis Farrakhan?
[02:47:19.636 --> 02:47:21.556]  Yes, I did hear about Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:47:21.657 --> 02:47:22.517]  I don't have the clip.
[02:47:22.577 --> 02:47:23.898]  If somebody's got it, send it to me.
[02:47:24.558 --> 02:47:26.779]  But, I mean, I don't need Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:47:26.799 --> 02:47:29.160]  We have police that said explosions went off.
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:30.040]  No, but here it is Alex.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:32.502]  I'm just saying, you have a guy saying it publicly.
[02:47:32.582 --> 02:47:35.903]  I had told a woman I work with a couple days ago about this explosion.
[02:47:35.923 --> 02:47:36.743]  She goes, you're cracked.
[02:47:36.763 --> 02:47:40.025]  And then she heard the Lewis Farrakhan thing on the local news, and all of a sudden she said,
[02:47:40.563 --> 02:47:41.663]  Wow, I've got to look into that.
[02:47:41.923 --> 02:47:43.244]  You know, my word wasn't good enough.
[02:47:43.504 --> 02:47:44.224]  But you're right, Alex.
[02:47:44.244 --> 02:47:45.624]  There is an awakening taking place.
[02:47:45.804 --> 02:47:48.845]  I'm not saying I'm a hero of Louis Farrakhan.
[02:47:48.865 --> 02:47:49.785]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:47:49.905 --> 02:47:50.826]  Was she a black lady?
[02:47:51.146 --> 02:47:52.526]  No, she was a white woman.
[02:47:52.666 --> 02:47:55.947]  So a white woman won't listen to you, but she'll listen to Louis Farrakhan.
[02:47:56.027 --> 02:47:59.848]  Oh no, she's got Rush Limbaugh on her radio all day from 11 to 2 o'clock.
[02:47:59.928 --> 02:48:01.208]  She loves Rush Limbaugh.
[02:48:02.489 --> 02:48:03.609]  She's a Rush Limbaugh lover.
[02:48:03.909 --> 02:48:05.709]  She's a communist who doesn't even know it.
[02:48:05.789 --> 02:48:06.309]  That's right.
[02:48:06.970 --> 02:48:07.750]  He's a socialist.
[02:48:09.252 --> 02:48:10.573]  Horrible creature.
[02:48:10.753 --> 02:48:12.574]  And I, you know, I tried to witness it.
[02:48:12.594 --> 02:48:14.215]  Socialist, horrible creature.
[02:48:14.275 --> 02:48:14.715]  I like it.
[02:48:15.976 --> 02:48:17.277]  They are horrible creatures.
[02:48:17.337 --> 02:48:19.078]  I mean, they're just giggling, gibbering.
[02:48:19.618 --> 02:48:21.839]  Oh, by the way, I know this group of pro-Bush people.
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:27.643]  Last night, they were saying, oh, let them take the guns.
[02:48:27.703 --> 02:48:28.783]  It's for security.
[02:48:28.803 --> 02:48:33.586]  I mean, it's just, these people, there's no end to you.
[02:48:35.067 --> 02:48:36.628]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:36.648 --> 02:48:37.128]  Stay with us.

[02:48:50.175 --> 02:48:54.918]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:55.138 --> 02:49:00.781]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:01.021 --> 02:49:01.742]  We're good to go.
[02:49:16.664 --> 02:49:17.464]  Much, much more.
[02:49:17.644 --> 02:49:20.145]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:20.385 --> 02:49:27.128]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:50:57.925 --> 02:50:58.526]  I think so.
[02:51:18.148 --> 02:51:18.388]  I think so.
[02:51:50.363 --> 02:51:53.385]  So, Bush takes responsibility, but he doesn't get in trouble.
[02:51:55.327 --> 02:51:57.188]  And again, Bush himself is just a puppet.
[02:51:57.988 --> 02:52:00.550]  This illusion that the buck stops with the President.
[02:52:01.331 --> 02:52:02.291]  The globalists love it.
[02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.553]  They'll just replace him like birdcage liner.
[02:52:05.553 --> 02:52:09.096]  And then we start the whole cycle over again and no change ever happens.
[02:52:09.696 --> 02:52:10.977]  No change ever takes place.
[02:52:13.041 --> 02:52:21.143]  Folks, there's so many people who consciously know the government's evil and know the system's corrupt, so they make a decision to join it out of fear.
[02:52:22.823 --> 02:52:30.204]  Still others are just completely ignorant, and then still others actually like the evil and decide to join it.
[02:52:31.544 --> 02:52:34.785]  And so it's up to us to stand up against all this scum.
[02:52:37.245 --> 02:52:38.546]  All these egomaniacs.
[02:52:38.826 --> 02:52:39.906]  And a great way to do it
[02:52:40.726 --> 02:53:10.082]  If you want to put a nail in the coffin of the New World Order, if you want to stand up against these murderers, if you want to fight them, if you want to resist them, if you want to put them in their place and put evil, you know, back in the closet or back in the cave instead of running around wildly, you know, doing whatever it wants, in charge, a great way to do that is to get my documentary
[02:53:10.652 --> 02:53:11.032]  Films.
[02:53:12.712 --> 02:53:14.413]  And I have made 12 films.
[02:53:14.733 --> 02:53:15.973]  The newest is Martial Law.
[02:53:16.013 --> 02:53:16.673]  It's excellent.
[02:53:17.474 --> 02:53:21.474]  I put a lot of work into it and it proves the globalists carried out 9-11.
[02:53:21.794 --> 02:53:26.656]  And it proves just how evil they are and what their master plan is.
[02:53:27.216 --> 02:53:33.017]  So I hope you'll call and get a copy of Martial Law or American Dictators or any of the documentaries that I've made.
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:35.241]  Or any of the other videos I carry.

[02:54:08.766 --> 02:54:09.466]  Jesse, welcome.
[02:54:10.026 --> 02:54:10.667]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:10.947 --> 02:54:11.667]  Hi.
[02:54:11.747 --> 02:54:21.470]  I'm wanting to know if you can tell me about... Several days ago I heard about... I heard about on local news that they had developed a sound wave gun that...
[02:54:24.730 --> 02:54:30.931]  And that they were planning on testing it out on criminals in the New Orleans area.
[02:54:31.212 --> 02:54:37.333]  Yeah, they're going to test it on families that won't leave their high and dry homes and move to a shelter where they can be raped.
[02:54:38.193 --> 02:54:39.934]  And they have two different things.
[02:54:39.954 --> 02:54:45.855]  They have the sound cannons that they used in New York and in Iraq, because we're evil terrorists.
[02:54:46.776 --> 02:54:57.022]  Uh, and they also have a microwave beam that'll fry your skin if turned on high, but just burn your skin from a mile and a half away on low.
[02:54:57.642 --> 02:55:01.004]  And all these years, we told you, they have these ready in every major U.S.
[02:55:01.044 --> 02:55:01.365]  city.
[02:55:02.125 --> 02:55:06.908]  So the, the, I understand how the microwave thing works, but how does it, what does the sound, uh, adjust?
[02:55:06.968 --> 02:55:14.212]  It's just a focus sound cannon, and, uh, it, uh, focuses deafening sound on you.
[02:55:15.666 --> 02:55:17.608]  And so it basically just blows your drum.
[02:55:18.348 --> 02:55:25.634]  It's part of the pleasure of the government, just like our troops gathered around and killed all those kids at Waco, they're going to get to do it on a wider scale now.
[02:55:25.654 --> 02:55:26.675]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:26.815 --> 02:55:27.215]  Thank you.
[02:55:27.516 --> 02:55:30.598]  The gun confiscation is going on, the average person has no idea.
[02:55:31.259 --> 02:55:33.280]  Russell in Florida, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:36.363]  Alex, I'll have to make this quick, thanks for taking my call.
[02:55:37.003 --> 02:55:41.167]  You know, I watched that 9-11 inside job little video, that compilation, which
[02:55:42.108 --> 02:55:45.689]  It has a lot of your video material in it, including the cremation of terror.
[02:55:45.709 --> 02:55:47.150]  I think we can sum all this up.
[02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:50.131]  You broke in and brought it out, Alex.
[02:55:50.871 --> 02:55:56.593]  These devil worshippers get together and they worship Satan and you caught it on film.
[02:55:57.273 --> 02:56:00.574]  I can't tell you how important that is that you were able to prove that, Alex.
[02:56:00.734 --> 02:56:02.855]  Well, I appreciate your kind comments.
[02:56:03.535 --> 02:56:06.116]  It's a big joke to them that we're so naive.
[02:56:07.497 --> 02:56:08.637]  I mean, it's a big joke to them.
[02:56:10.615 --> 02:56:11.556]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:11.596 --> 02:56:13.078]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:13.118 --> 02:56:14.540]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:15.541 --> 02:56:17.544]  We'll be here fighting the New World Order.
[02:56:17.884 --> 02:56:18.705]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.989 --> 02:56:26.234]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
