[00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:01.949]  Is that Goose?
[00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.090]  A lot of interesting names today, a lot of interesting callers.
[00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.411]  Goose in Ohio, must be related to Skunk who called earlier.
[00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:10.712]  Hey Goose, how you doing?
[00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:11.552]  How you doing brother?
[00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.273]  Out here trying to wake up people in Ohio.
[00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:22.094]  I just, I had to say that you do Randy Savage better than Randy Savage does Randy Savage.
[00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:23.675]  Who is Randy Savage?
[00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:24.575]  The wrestler.
[00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:27.057]  Oh, Macho Man Randy.
[00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.438]  Macho Man, yeah.
[00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.640]  Steppin' to a Slim Jim, ooh baby, you're gonna get it, yeah!
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.141]  You're goin' down!
[00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.082]  I get a kick out of it.
[00:00:35.142 --> 00:00:37.684]  I'm gonna defeat, I'm gonna defeat Hulk Hogan today!
[00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:42.567]  Wrestling's real, and I'll kick your tail if you say it isn't, oh yeah!
[00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:48.612]  And the point is, is wrestling isn't real, but millions of adults think it is, just like they think the elections are real.
[00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:49.492]  Exactly.
[00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.235]  Well, one thing I did want to mention, and I don't know if you know this or not,
[00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.344]  Uh, our constitution is like only... The constitution's going down!
[00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:03.690]  Get this republic safe from terrorists!
[00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:05.074]  It only governs...
