[00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:06.200]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.901]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.722]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.203]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:17.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.891]  It's funny how this stuff works.
[00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:38.709]  On Monday, I talked about how school districts across the country put video cameras actually in the showers and videotape your children and then they also share the files.
[00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.332]  And it's just done right out in the open.
[00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:43.754]  And they pass them out around the country.
[00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.595]  That's been in mainstream newspapers.
[00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:47.938]  But the paper actually reports it like it's good and normal.
[00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.342]  From Sacramento, California, to areas of Tennessee.
[00:00:53.467 --> 00:01:02.513]  Got an article here today out of Georgia, where some of the young boys found the camera in the bathroom stall area.
[00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:09.397]  They thought it was interesting, alerted people, and so got in trouble and been suspended.
[00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:13.520]  And the principal just says, I don't care if you found the camera, it's staying up there.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.261]  And, of course, the local thug police are saying, oh, this is absolutely constitutional.
[00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:20.901]  Hey, yeah, everything's constitutional.
[00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:26.003]  I mean, feeding us into a meat grinder while dressed up in a devil suit would be unconstitutional.
[00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:33.425]  You know, lining up 4,000 children and pouring gasoline on them and dancing around on their burning bodies would be constitutional, according to this government.
[00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:38.746]  I mean, it's totally on its face, ridiculously criminal and unconstitutional.
[00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:43.107]  And nine times out of ten, these principals doing this are perverts.
[00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:48.615]  And it just makes me absolutely sick.
[00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:52.037]  And they're just setting the precedent.
[00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.898]  Hey, it's the government's privilege.
[00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.359]  You're a civilian.
[00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.800]  We're your military government.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.701]  Shut up!
[00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:09.467]  And I had the article yesterday where they just came out and said, yeah, the feds are going to pay to put biometrics in all the schools and face scan you and totally control you and it's for control.
[00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.020]  We're all being trained how to be slaves.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:24.627]  And of course, I got an email because I mentioned some story from a few years ago, the Tennessee story, with cameras in the showers and a visiting basketball team that wasn't totally brainwashed.
[00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:29.370]  It was a middle school basketball team, freaked out, were screaming and running and acting like normal people.
[00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.150]  My God, there's a camera right here!
[00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:32.931]  And that's how you're supposed to behave.
[00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:37.314]  And the principal just said, well, everyone knows it's part of being a body snatcher.
[00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:46.259]  I mean, literally, it's like one of those science fiction movies we always talk about where the evil people take over and it's like, what's wrong?
[00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.360]  Join us, everything's okay.
[00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:51.142]  Everyone knows cameras in the shower is normal.
[00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:59.948]  Then the principal did get in some trouble when it was found that the video feeds were being shared around the country to some select individuals.
[00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.130]  It isn't really about security, is it?
[00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:12.459]  Oh, but then simultaneously they're always catching a janitor or some pervert doing it for their own private sick kicks and oh, they spend hard prison time.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.241]  But when the cops and the government do it, oh, it's good.
[00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:19.962]  So we're about one step away from them being in your home.
[00:03:20.923 --> 00:03:21.983]  This is actual 1984.
[00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:30.024]  And the news and the cops and the government just say, it's normal, what's wrong with you?
[00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.485]  I actually have the newscast, we're going to play it here coming up.
[00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.306]  What's wrong with you?
[00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:37.427]  Cameras in the party are good.
[00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:43.329]  You just, what, you, you, you think you, no this doesn't violate your rights.
[00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.150]  You don't have any.
[00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.751]  It's so sick.
[00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.252]  It's so unbelievably evil.
[00:03:55.234 --> 00:04:00.577]  And we're working on getting this mother and her son on the show.
[00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:03.359]  So you'll hear them either today or tomorrow.
[00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.341]  We have two big guests today already.
[00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:09.122]  I live in the twilight zone.
[00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:09.923]  I really do.
[00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:12.824]  Remember this Times of London article, also from Monday?
[00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:16.166]  It's actually the Sunday Times of London, but I saw it on Monday.
[00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:20.049]  Fifty babies a year are alive after abortion.
[00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:22.534]  I'll tell you what's behind that.
[00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.115]  Of course, here in America, they just kill them on the table.
[00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.096]  But in England, they go to prison for that, as they should.
[00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:35.818]  And so, we've got a doctor, Professor Stuart Campbell, joining us from England to discuss this.
[00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:44.300]  And then we have another guest, coming up later, who was with the Royal Marines, having a lot of britties on today.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.781]  Giving us some of the stuff happening with the Royal Marines over there.
[00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:50.889]  But, uh, I'm the radical, folks.
[00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:58.673]  I don't want to take a microchip anywhere, and he says I should be forced to, and I don't want the cameras in the bathroom when I... when I, uh, excuse myself.
[00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:02.754]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:06.037]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:10.080]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.344]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:18.468]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.510]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.954]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.055]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:28.656]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.816 --> 00:05:31.857]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:34.918]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:41.500]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.843]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:47.604]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:49.025]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:08.077]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:15.441]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:27.087]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:34.852]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:13.665]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults, or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:18.428]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:23.791]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:34.437]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care, whose safety and effectiveness in supporting healthy joints has been established in over 50 clinical trials and research studies.
[00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:41.799]  Joint care facilitates freedom of movement by promoting circulation and enhancing the overall functioning of the musculoskeletal system.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.641]  Don't let arthritis stop you from doing the things you enjoy or leading a normal, healthy and active life.
[00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:50.602]  Visit us online today at researchedherbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to learn more.
[00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:50.943]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:07.601]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:15.366]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:19.348]  It is Thursday, the first day of December 2005.
[00:08:19.768 --> 00:08:20.389]  Can you believe it?
[00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.390]  The twelfth month of 05.
[00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.251]  Seems like 05 just started.
[00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:26.693]  And life accelerates.
[00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.354]  Very transitory.
[00:08:29.094 --> 00:08:30.095]  Sunday Times.
[00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:34.437]  Fifty babies a year are alive after abortion in England alone.
[00:08:34.477 --> 00:08:36.317]  It's hundreds and hundreds here in the U.S.
[00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:40.278]  We've had guests on in the past about how they actually just kill the babies.
[00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:45.979]  And there are scores of individuals in their own speaking tours.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.120]  You name it.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.741]  One of them is a very lovely, a very intelligent young lady.
[00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.341]  I forget her name.
[00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:53.261]  We had her on a few years ago.
[00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:54.101]  She's got blonde hair.
[00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:56.982]  Figures somebody will call in and remind me of her name.
[00:08:58.334 --> 00:09:05.256]  I want to get her back on as a guest, but she does limp, where they almost severed her leg when she was at eight months inside her mother.
[00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:11.518]  And then that was before they sold the babies for body parts, and so they just threw her in the dumpster.
[00:09:12.478 --> 00:09:23.662]  And the Christians, those evil Christians, would go dig in the dumpster and get babies out to save their lives, and were able to save her.
[00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:37.272]  It's just absolutely horrible, ladies and gentlemen, that Christians have to loiter month after month outside and dig through dumpsters of dead babies to find the one that's occasionally alive.
[00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:45.555]  Of course, they now quietly kill them, even though it's illegal, it's just something that's done and kept very quiet, and then they cremate the baby or sell it.
[00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:48.096]  They've gotten a little bit slickered about it now.
[00:09:48.496 --> 00:09:52.558]  Remember the big article, what was it, out of Missouri just a few months ago?
[00:09:53.923 --> 00:10:04.792]  Where the abortionist openly in front of his employees was eating parts of babies and leaving dead babies laying around and laughing about it and the police finally did raid the guy.
[00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:11.297]  I mean, look, I don't want to get off into a big abortion debate with people.
[00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:17.122]  A lot of you out there are pro-abortion and you think it's some wonderful right because the media and the government told you.
[00:10:17.743 --> 00:10:20.285]  If we can't get ourselves together enough to
[00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:32.560]  Let the government engineer us to stop producing and to stop reproducing and to kill our own children and then to lie to ourselves about it.
[00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:37.262]  Of course we're going to have tyranny.
[00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:38.562]  Of course we're going to have Big Brother.
[00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:43.244]  Of course we're going to have wars and depleted uranium and poison the water and the air.
[00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:47.165]  It's just all part and parcel of the same thing.
[00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:55.524]  There are a few billboards up around Austin and I've seen them in a few other areas of the country.
[00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:57.604]  I want to thank the groups that are doing it.
[00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:58.505]  There are several different ones.
[00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:04.247]  But a woman gets her expenses paid for between $50,000 and $200,000 in some cases paid to them.
[00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:11.084]  To bring a baby to term and then to adopt it.
[00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:19.109]  In fact, there are a little bit higher level of people that want to adopt each year, of men and women that want to adopt each year.
[00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.512]  It's a little bit above the level of actual abortions.
[00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:27.575]  A million, two million abortions depending on what year it is.
[00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:29.036]  Some years it's as high as three million abortions.
[00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:32.698]  There are that many people looking for babies ready to pay.
[00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:34.980]  That's why you see so many
[00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:46.666]  Hispanic families and black families and white families with Asian children because Korea and Vietnam and China are ready to supply.
[00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:56.234]  There are young women who get pregnant and over there, they predominantly, especially in South Korea, don't have abortions because they're not really into that.
[00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:57.495]  Thank God.
[00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.798]  They will adopt the baby and they get paid a sizable sum.
[00:12:02.046 --> 00:12:11.633]  But believe me, Hispanic families want Hispanic children, white families want white children, black families want black children, or any children, period.
[00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:24.021]  They love children so much, they've normally had a child and can't have another child and know the joys of children, just how wonderful and magical they are, and just how great it is, or they've never had children and want them.
[00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.372]  So there's a whole other market, too, a whole other evil that comes out of abortion.
[00:12:28.772 --> 00:12:36.396]  CPS gets hundreds of thousands through these private adoption agencies, and they fence the money back and forth between each other for grabbing children.
[00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:40.858]  And it's publicly known, blond-haired, blue-eyed children of poor parents, they're gone.
[00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.880]  I mean, you go in for assistance.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.401]  You think you're going to get help here in Austin.
[00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:49.844]  Nine times out of ten, you're poor and no record, no criminal problems.
[00:12:50.324 --> 00:12:53.486]  You know, the daddy works at an auto parts store, but mama's on welfare.
[00:12:53.746 --> 00:12:55.026]  Oh, go get your baby paid for.
[00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:55.867]  Boom, they take them.
[00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:57.328]  Ninety percent of the time.
[00:12:57.688 --> 00:12:58.969]  They got special goon cops.
[00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:00.029]  I mean, I've been there at the hospital.
[00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:00.830]  I've gone and covered this.
[00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.330]  I mean, it's made me cry.
[00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:06.513]  And the cops grab one by the arms and jerk the baby away from him.
[00:13:06.813 --> 00:13:07.713]  I put it on TV.
[00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:10.195]  I was marching around the hospital showing this.
[00:13:11.013 --> 00:13:12.254]  Then we even get why they hit the kid.
[00:13:12.314 --> 00:13:13.035]  It's just no reason.
[00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:14.296]  We just took them.
[00:13:14.716 --> 00:13:16.357]  Then they go get $200,000 for the kid.
[00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:22.582]  So I'm off diatribing on this now, but it is just pure evil.
[00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:24.803]  So you know why I dislike the police and the government.
[00:13:24.863 --> 00:13:27.365]  I mean, I watch you guys do this stuff all the time.
[00:13:28.586 --> 00:13:29.907]  And don't try to say it isn't true.
[00:13:29.947 --> 00:13:30.648]  You know it's true.
[00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:32.369]  There's so much evidence of it, it's ridiculous.
[00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:34.831]  You're five times more likely to abuse children.
[00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:40.293]  And you're many times more likely to just do horrible things and engage in criminal activities.
[00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:41.074]  Period.
[00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:45.478]  I'm not saying you're all criminals, but statistically, you're as evil as any group.
[00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:46.879]  You are the worst.
[00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:48.240]  You are the scum of the earth.
[00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:49.421]  Statistically.
[00:13:50.182 --> 00:13:52.845]  That does not mean there are not wonderful men and women in this system.
[00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:55.187]  But you want to treat us all like we're criminals and scum?
[00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:58.289]  Well, boy, you better get the beam out of your eye.
[00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.012]  I mean, that is the pot calling the kettle black.
[00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:08.347]  I mean, if we're gray, you're as black as a city at night.
[00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:20.555]  I mean, I'm not saying our society isn't evil and there isn't crime, people aren't corrupt, and cops do stop a lot of crime, do help a lot of people, do change a lot of tires, do get people out of burning buildings.
[00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:25.118]  But I'm telling you, statistically, you want to look for dirt, look in the mirror.
[00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:28.321]  When you're in your locker room, I want you to look around in there.
[00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:33.384]  And I want you to see the most criminal, most dangerous people on Earth.
[00:14:34.969 --> 00:14:36.090]  And you know those statistics.
[00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:43.096]  Drug abuse, violence, murder, drug dealing, racketeering, whore running.
[00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:44.156]  It's you!
[00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:45.918]  It's you!
[00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:46.718]  It ain't me!
[00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:46.779]  No!
[00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:48.820]  No, it ain't me!
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:58.168]  Alright, now I really am off on a jag here, but... 50 babies a year are alive after abortion.
[00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:01.871]  The point is, government is the most criminal thing out there in history.
[00:15:01.931 --> 00:15:02.651]  Everybody knows that.
[00:15:02.711 --> 00:15:03.392]  It's common sense.
[00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:08.814]  And so that's why we've got to limit its size and its scope and its circumference.
[00:15:09.695 --> 00:15:15.719]  That's why we've got to go after it and tackle it and stop letting them sit up there and tell us what to do and talk about how good they are!
[00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:18.040]  You just have no place doing it!
[00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:22.750]  But we'll get into this, 50 babies a year are alive for abortion.
[00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:33.659]  That's the ones that are getting reported, where it's good doctors that go, well, baby came out, we're unable to kill it before it left the womb, and if it, and if it leaves, the woman stops, well, normally what they do under U.S.
[00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:41.385]  law and regulations is they hold the baby up to the woman if it comes out, and then they just sanguinate it, suck its brains out.
[00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:42.506]  I'm sorry you don't want to hear this.
[00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:44.408]  Okay, this is real, people.
[00:15:44.648 --> 00:15:45.409]  This is going on.
[00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:48.111]  And they kill the baby right there on the spot.
[00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:53.547]  And I'm sorry if you don't want to hear about this.
[00:15:55.909 --> 00:15:57.510]  Somebody's got to stand up for these children.
[00:15:58.151 --> 00:16:00.633]  If you don't like it, just tune out of the show.
[00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:03.955]  This is the real world.
[00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:05.376]  This is the real deal.
[00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:07.137]  This is why I'm so upset.
[00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:10.360]  So that's coming up.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.582]  But look, I'm angry today.
[00:16:13.602 --> 00:16:14.703]  I'm not going to deny it.
[00:16:15.484 --> 00:16:18.406]  I'm so angry that my blood is boiling.
[00:16:20.573 --> 00:16:33.539]  Outrage after outrage on the heels of Denver and now Miami where the police say, oh we're going to surround you and put you under siege and let you know that we're the boss and we're going to search you and demand your papers.
[00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:36.701]  Now that's the police chief and deputy police chief on the record.
[00:16:37.301 --> 00:16:41.643]  AP, Miami Herald, local Miami TV stations, I've watched them online, we've played them.
[00:16:42.364 --> 00:16:45.447]  They're openly, arrogantly saying this.
[00:16:46.107 --> 00:16:49.530]  Just imagine, you're walking with your family and they're just going to randomly go search everybody.
[00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:51.352]  As if that keeps anybody safe.
[00:16:52.893 --> 00:16:57.037]  Just randomly picking a shopping mall, or randomly to look, quote, for terrorists.
[00:16:57.057 --> 00:16:58.598]  Of course they're not looking for terrorists, folks.
[00:16:58.938 --> 00:17:00.400]  They're looking for people to shake down.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.162]  They're training you to accept this is all under federal grants.
[00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:11.245]  I read an article yesterday, mainstream news, about federal grants to put biometrics in, federal grants to control us, federal grants to turn the schools into prisons.
[00:17:11.285 --> 00:17:20.207]  They even say they're turning them into these organizations to train us for the new economy, the new society, which is a prison, folks.
[00:17:20.787 --> 00:17:26.629]  The whole country is a prison in a police state if the cops are going to randomly just block a street off and start searching everyone.
[00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:42.321]  And it started with the National Guard, and Alabama Defense Forces, and Texas Defense Forces, and you go to the football game, and there's troops there searching your bags, and you bought your tickets, and you got your cooler, and you're going in, and oh, we got the photos and the video on the website.
[00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.083]  It's in the film Martial Law, and there are the troops to search you.
[00:17:45.384 --> 00:17:48.306]  Then it's at the Bay Fest in Alabama.
[00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:49.927]  I'm just using Alabama as an example.
[00:17:50.627 --> 00:18:11.928]  And they, real case, and they just set up troops with local defense forces, with Humvees, and they search little four-year-olds, we have photos and video, just little four-year-olds, with troops searching them, training them, troops, troops are going to search you, with families, and they're just going into the downtown of that particular town.
[00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:16.586]  Just all the major roads blocked with troops searching you.
[00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:20.707]  Again, all federally paid for, all federally funded, total martial law.
[00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.728]  It's slow motion Red Dawn.
[00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:24.989]  It's slow motion martial law.
[00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.572]  And on the heels of all of that, look at this, camera in school bathroom.
[00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:39.654]  Now folks, every time I mention this, I get emails going, I can't find it, I don't believe it, I know you're in denial.
[00:18:39.714 --> 00:18:40.895]  That's actually almost healthy.
[00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:45.018]  I don't want to believe this either, but it's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:48.620]  Paul Wass is going to write an article at PrisonPlanet.com about it later in the day.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.901]  And we're going to play an audio clip when we get back.
[00:18:52.841 --> 00:19:01.624]  A Jasper, this is Georgia, a Jasper County mother says her 8th grade son found a video camera taping in the school bathroom this week, but now he's the one in trouble.
[00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.605]  Cindy Champion.
[00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:14.369]  Champion says her son, Mark Medorb, and a few of his friends took the camera out of the ceiling because they felt it violated their privacy.
[00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:15.889]  Absolutely!
[00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.211]  Champion says her son brought the camera home to show her that afternoon.
[00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:32.075]  She says that she contacted the Jasper County Comprehensive School and found out that the high school principal, Howard Fore, put the camera there
[00:19:33.027 --> 00:19:33.787]  Listen to this quote.
[00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:40.269]  I had told the high school principal, Mr. Ford, that he needed to come up with another solution, but this wasn't appropriate.
[00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:43.270]  His response to me was that he was going to continue to film.
[00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.511]  Listen, this guy needs to be arrested.
[00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:49.531]  How do they arrest janitors when they do it?
[00:19:49.551 --> 00:19:50.552]  Because they're pervs.
[00:19:51.292 --> 00:19:52.692]  Well, this guy needs to be arrested.
[00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:54.933]  That makes me sick.
[00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:58.594]  When we get back, we'll give you the full details of this blasphemy.
[00:20:02.253 --> 00:20:07.595]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.

[00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:05.862]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:22:06.302 --> 00:22:08.984]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:12.065]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:22:39.843 --> 00:22:41.284]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:22:41.464 --> 00:22:41.804]  Have you?
[00:22:42.384 --> 00:22:43.885]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:11.000]  It's just like everything else.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.526]  They were the straight face from Sean Hannity to Andy Rooney.
[00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:17.470]  We need to arrest every militia member.
[00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.074]  We all need to take microchips to prove who the good people are.
[00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:22.599]  These are quotes.
[00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:23.821]  World government's good.
[00:24:25.706 --> 00:24:27.928]  You'll never hear a word about Miami in the checkpoints.
[00:24:27.948 --> 00:24:31.470]  You'll never hear him come out and support the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.
[00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.992]  They'll tell you how Bush is fighting the illegal aliens.
[00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:35.973]  Meanwhile, his plan is for total amnesty.
[00:24:36.393 --> 00:24:39.175]  Everything is either complete lying or complete bravado.
[00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:40.636]  Listen to this newscast.
[00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:42.837]  The principal is just going to continue filming.
[00:24:43.198 --> 00:24:44.859]  He doesn't think he'll talk to the press.
[00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:50.983]  And the district attorney says he thinks it's probably okay because, you know, you really don't have the same rights once you're in a school.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:25:01.743]  Oh, because they're claiming that they have jurisdiction and that they are then the charges, or that they have custody of your children.
[00:25:01.863 --> 00:25:15.648]  Just like the Feds and the FDA are trying to change the law right now, where if they've got a kid they've grabbed, or it's a child in government custody as their guardian, they can test lethal pesticides and chemicals on them.
[00:25:15.688 --> 00:25:17.889]  Had Ron Paul on about that last Monday.
[00:25:18.928 --> 00:25:19.809]  Or was it last Wednesday?
[00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.751]  This is really what's happening.
[00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:25.414]  They just, in your face, yeah, we're going to put cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:35.724]  Now remember that up in Tennessee, one of the most flagrant cases was a visiting a basketball team of middle school girls between, what, 11 and 12.
[00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:39.588]  They're there from 7th and 8th grade.
[00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:43.532]  This was in, the Associated Press was in local Tennessee papers.
[00:25:44.315 --> 00:25:47.276]  And then the local team was taking a shower after the basketball game.
[00:25:47.336 --> 00:25:48.537]  They weren't brainwashed.
[00:25:48.857 --> 00:25:50.578]  They were still normal people.
[00:25:50.858 --> 00:25:53.279]  They weren't the new Orwellian, you know, humanoid.
[00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.320]  They weren't Soviet citizens.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.581]  And they saw the cameras and literally ran out screaming.
[00:25:58.621 --> 00:25:59.701]  And there was a big panic.
[00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:02.082]  And parents were freaking out in their cars to pick them up.
[00:26:02.122 --> 00:26:03.243]  And, what's going on?
[00:26:03.303 --> 00:26:05.084]  It was almost a riot, folks.
[00:26:05.584 --> 00:26:06.484]  Normal behavior.
[00:26:06.584 --> 00:26:08.205]  Screaming, freaking out.
[00:26:08.885 --> 00:26:10.966]  I mean, that's how you're supposed to behave.
[00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.442]  And the principal says, we'll do whatever we want!
[00:26:14.462 --> 00:26:17.186]  It's completely normal to videotape your naked children!
[00:26:18.234 --> 00:26:23.595]  I mean, this is the new America, so go ahead and roll this latest outrage out of Jasper County, Georgia.
[00:26:23.635 --> 00:26:24.095]  Here it is.
[00:26:24.775 --> 00:26:26.836]  It's a question of privacy and public schools.
[00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:33.517]  One Jasper County mother is speaking out tonight about the camera she says her 13-year-old son found in the school bathroom Monday.
[00:26:33.697 --> 00:26:38.078]  What's more, the mother says the principal at Jasper County High School put it in the ceiling.
[00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:41.399]  Laura Lynch talked with the mother and her 8th grade son this afternoon.
[00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:46.000]  Now Laura, I understand the boy is now suspended from school because he took the camera down.
[00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:53.816]  That's right Frank, Cindy Champion says her son Mac and three of his friends took down the camera because they felt their privacy was being violated.
[00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:57.220]  Now she says Mac is suspended for the next five school days.
[00:26:57.581 --> 00:27:02.507]  A punishment she believes is unfair because she says her son was just standing up for what is right.
[00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:13.969]  Eighth grader at Jasper County Middle School, Mac Better, would normally be at school with friends, but instead he's doing computer work with mom.
[00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.251]  He's got a five-day unwanted vacation.
[00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:23.317]  What Mac did is take a camera out of the ceiling of a bathroom shared by both Jasper County Middle and High School students.
[00:27:23.597 --> 00:27:26.340]  There's tiles up there and it was cut out in a little circle.
[00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:30.164]  Max says he and a few friends spotted it Monday morning.
[00:27:30.424 --> 00:27:33.548]  But that afternoon, they decided it had to come down.
[00:27:33.888 --> 00:27:35.550]  It felt like the right thing to do.
[00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:43.018]  It felt like we were being violated in every way in the bathroom.
[00:27:45.743 --> 00:27:48.964]  I just knew that I could trust my mom and she would do something about it.
[00:27:49.324 --> 00:27:53.566]  Max says he took the camera home to his mom, who in turn called the school.
[00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.227]  That was an interesting thing.
[00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:57.708]  I think that surprised me is Ms.
[00:27:57.748 --> 00:28:01.629]  Massingale, the middle school principal, nor the teachers were aware.
[00:28:02.249 --> 00:28:06.651]  No one was or seemed to be aware other than the principal of the high school.
[00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:13.293]  Champion says high school principal Howard Foer told her the camera was meant to catch students vandalizing the bathroom.
[00:28:13.673 --> 00:28:16.074]  She says Foer also showed her the video.
[00:28:16.414 --> 00:28:17.674]  I saw part of the stalls.
[00:28:17.754 --> 00:28:18.975]  I could not see the toilet.
[00:28:19.195 --> 00:28:30.318]  So, you know, technically if the children were sitting on the toilet, you would not have been able to see, you know, to have seen that aspect.
[00:28:30.538 --> 00:28:35.840]  Still Champion says it's a violation of not only her sons, but other children's privacy.
[00:28:37.347 --> 00:28:43.289]  Even though Mac is at mom's work instead of doing schoolwork, both believe he did the right thing.
[00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.151]  I did get in touch with both the Jasper County middle and high school principals today.
[00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:51.353]  Both had no comment and referred me to the school superintendent.
[00:28:51.733 --> 00:28:55.574]  I called superintendent Jay Brinson numerous times and stopped by his office.
[00:28:55.915 --> 00:29:00.236]  Business manager for the district, Kathy Thomason, told me Brinson said he would not be available.
[00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:01.217]  They've commented.
[00:29:01.357 --> 00:29:01.577]  Frank?
[00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:02.657]  Thank you, Laura.
[00:29:02.677 --> 00:29:07.338]  Cathy Champion says Principal Howard Ford told her he planned to continue using the camera in the school.
[00:29:07.758 --> 00:29:11.259]  Champion says Ford told her there was only one camera in use at the time.
[00:29:11.659 --> 00:29:17.440]  We tried to contact the Okmulgee Circuit District Attorney about the legality of placing hidden cameras in public school restrooms.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.620]  He covers that area.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.020]  We were not able to get in touch with him.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.701]  But we did talk with Bibb County District Attorney Howard Sims.
[00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:28.122]  He says cameras in public school bathrooms are probably legal because schools have more leeway on privacy issues.
[00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:36.734]  And folks, I mean, we know of hundreds of cases of this, but in some of the more egregious, we're talking about cameras actually in the showers.
[00:29:37.274 --> 00:29:38.375]  In the showers.
[00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:46.581]  And then they caught to the particular school district, for some reason, people were, it was on the internet being downloaded, hooked into an internet system.
[00:29:47.962 --> 00:29:51.084]  And see, they're just, they're reporting it like it's normal.
[00:29:51.104 --> 00:29:51.644]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:52.785]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:54.846]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:58.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.437 --> 00:30:03.398]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:06.339]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:11.920]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.661]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:13.721 --> 00:30:15.962]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.142 --> 00:30:19.623]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:22.043]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:30:22.123 --> 00:30:29.045]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[00:30:29.225 --> 00:30:34.926]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[00:30:35.206 --> 00:30:42.688]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[00:30:42.728 --> 00:30:43.428]  We're good to go.

[00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.532]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[00:32:05.873 --> 00:32:11.177]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[00:32:11.417 --> 00:32:13.298]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[00:33:06.224 --> 00:33:08.125]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:11.587]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:31.218]  Well, for those who just joined us, we played the local news clip out of Jasper County and they find this camera that looks down into the stalls
[00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.293]  But not onto the toilets, just into the stalls.
[00:33:36.493 --> 00:33:40.976]  Oh, don't worry, it just looks into the stalls, but not over the toilet itself.
[00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:46.180]  And the local district attorney says, I don't think it's a problem.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.844]  You don't have the same rights when you're in a school, when you're our prisoner, when you're in our custody.
[00:33:51.864 --> 00:33:53.405]  And that's what it is.
[00:33:55.046 --> 00:33:59.730]  But I am, I've actually instructed my webmasters to dig up all the old articles.
[00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.060]  Quite a few over the years.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.761]  I know last time somebody didn't believe it, I went in the archives and found it and dug it up.
[00:34:08.341 --> 00:34:21.066]  The problem with search engines is after something stops getting a lot of hits, you know, two, three years after we cover something and link to it, and after it's blown over, it then just gets deep, deep, deep in the search engine.
[00:34:21.106 --> 00:34:28.268]  So I can go on Google and spend 20 minutes, you know, going back deep into the search.
[00:34:28.288 --> 00:34:29.849]  You know, they have option one to option 5,000.
[00:34:31.977 --> 00:34:38.561]  I might have to go into option 100 to then find the article even on my own website.
[00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:52.289]  Because we've got a Google search engine, another great search engine that a listener wrote a script for us on, searchinfowars.com, and they're pretty good if you remember the headline, or almost remember the headline.
[00:34:54.293 --> 00:34:57.434]  But I do want to create a whole section on this.
[00:34:57.454 --> 00:35:02.176]  We have a Big Brother section every day, but just a section on cameras.
[00:35:03.037 --> 00:35:09.099]  Because I'll see an article out of Ohio, or out of Missouri, or out of Texas, or out of Michigan.
[00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:13.841]  I remember the articles where they're actually putting the cameras over the stalls.
[00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:18.363]  Actually film you relieving yourself.
[00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:23.725]  But it said, don't worry, only if there's vandalism or a problem do we then go pull the tapes
[00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:26.544]  Uh, at a remote system and watch them.
[00:35:27.244 --> 00:35:29.244]  And now it's all on server, so it's all on the internet.
[00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.005]  You know, we need to write an article about this.
[00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:35.486]  Hey, did you know there's hidden cameras when you go into that rest stop and you sit down on the commode?
[00:35:36.107 --> 00:35:37.387]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[00:35:37.767 --> 00:35:41.828]  Well, we gotta stop vandals and crumb and stuff going on in these.
[00:35:41.868 --> 00:35:44.289]  That's why they've been putting in all the rest stops in Michigan.
[00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:48.610]  I mean, that was like in 99, I remember seeing that already five, six years ago.
[00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.591]  And I've since seen it in a lot of other states.
[00:35:52.552 --> 00:35:53.573]  Of course, it's ridiculous.
[00:35:53.613 --> 00:35:55.614]  Well, there could be a crime in the woods.
[00:35:55.754 --> 00:36:04.118]  So the city of Austin is now putting up wireless cameras in parks and city property to stop illegal dumping.
[00:36:04.278 --> 00:36:14.703]  I read an article where Colorado and some of the national parks and state parks are putting these long cables that have little mobile cameras that just zip around in the trees.
[00:36:15.504 --> 00:36:17.985]  Just a total control grid is going in.
[00:36:18.005 --> 00:36:21.387]  A total control grid.
[00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:25.312]  I've actually videotaped this before and put it on the local cable show many years ago.
[00:36:25.752 --> 00:36:33.638]  They put up all these federal cameras on the highways and we videotaped them moving around and aiming and aiming at houses and moving around.
[00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:36.020]  And now they're going into the neighborhoods.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.361]  Now they're going into four-way stops.
[00:36:37.401 --> 00:36:38.762]  Now they're going into the middle of nowhere.
[00:36:39.983 --> 00:36:40.784]  I'm sick of it!
[00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:56.580]  But don't put cameras on the border, don't put a fence down there, don't search people, have catch and release, where when they catch an illegal alien they actually give them a piece of paper to show up in court later, and the piece of paper has their name, whatever fake name they gave them, without even having documentation.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.161]  Did you know this?
[00:36:58.001 --> 00:36:58.762]  This is on the record.
[00:36:59.625 --> 00:37:10.576]  And then that can be used for six months to get IDs, to get jobs, and by the way, after Katrina Bush took all the restrictions off, you don't even have to have proof of citizenship or green card to get a job now.
[00:37:10.657 --> 00:37:12.518]  He hasn't taken that restriction off.
[00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:14.981]  I mean, he took it off and hasn't placed it back.
[00:37:16.082 --> 00:37:17.524]  But no, your child
[00:37:18.985 --> 00:37:30.553]  Instead of having hall monitors, instead of getting together with the male teachers and the female teachers and saying, listen, this is what they did back when we were in school, there was problems in the bathroom, smoking in the boys room or whatever.
[00:37:31.314 --> 00:37:40.981]  They would just say, we want you to start for two minutes randomly every day, once you've given the children their assignment, to duck out and go check the restroom.
[00:37:41.838 --> 00:37:57.548]  And you do this on Mondays and Wednesdays, and Mr. Smith does it on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then you go to the female teachers and you're going to check the women's bathroom, the girls' bathroom, and then it just stops immediately.
[00:37:57.608 --> 00:38:00.069]  Whatever happened to the good old-fashioned thing that really works?
[00:38:00.169 --> 00:38:00.489]  No.
[00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.752]  Because something might happen, we've just got to stick cameras in there.
[00:38:04.772 --> 00:38:06.333]  Well, there might be family violence.
[00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:07.474]  There might be crime in your home.
[00:38:07.774 --> 00:38:09.495]  We better put cameras up in your house.
[00:38:10.586 --> 00:38:12.768]  And a lot of people are already doing this to themselves.
[00:38:12.788 --> 00:38:20.736]  They're putting in these wireless cameras that they can access over the internet when they're at work to watch the nanny or to see what their husband's doing.
[00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:25.141]  What you don't know is the government and the NSA admits they tap into those on a routine basis.
[00:38:26.897 --> 00:38:29.279]  They've even got computers that don't just pick up keywords now.
[00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:36.604]  They have computers that actually can recognize video and recognize human shapes and activities and vocal tones.
[00:38:36.884 --> 00:38:43.408]  And so NSA is running around, hooking into different nodes and different plug-ins on your computers at your house, looking at you.
[00:38:43.428 --> 00:38:47.711]  So don't... If you're going to have a camera, let's say you've got a business, I think it's fine.
[00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:51.714]  Where, you know, you're in a high crime area, put cameras back by your loading dock.
[00:38:52.489 --> 00:38:53.350]  I think it's smart.
[00:38:53.770 --> 00:39:06.236]  When I had stalkers really bad, I installed some cameras on the house and let them know, just so there'd be a record if I had to, you know, they assaulted me and I had to deal with them with a .357 Magnum.
[00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:16.822]  I just wanted to have that video record of it and you can get yourself a videotape that records where it takes a shot every four or five seconds or so and I can get 24 hours on one tape and it just recycles.
[00:39:17.702 --> 00:39:19.123]  I'm not even saying that's bad, but you
[00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:21.395]  But you choose to do it.
[00:39:21.815 --> 00:39:24.516]  You choose to do it because you want to protect yourself.
[00:39:25.937 --> 00:39:31.699]  But just everywhere, every four-way stop, bathrooms, cameras, cameras, you can't do that.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.220]  Again, I'm not against cameras.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.821]  They're a great tool.
[00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:35.661]  They're just like a gun.
[00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:36.961]  They're just like a machete.
[00:39:37.502 --> 00:39:38.822]  I gave that speech yesterday.
[00:39:44.065 --> 00:39:47.066]  Meanwhile, the mind control has gotten so bad in schools,
[00:39:47.797 --> 00:39:53.580]  That children that draw pictures of their father, who's a captain in the Marines, with a picture of a gun, are arrested.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:40:05.125]  Or valedictorians who, at the last day of school, bringing cake to have a party with their speech club, is kicked out of school and has their diploma taken.
[00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:16.155]  Or a young girl graduates from homeschooling at 12 and is in college at 13 and the New York School District City calls it abusive.
[00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:16.795]  Remember that?
[00:40:16.835 --> 00:40:19.737]  And tries to arrest her and her father and they have to basically flee.
[00:40:19.777 --> 00:40:20.318]  We had them on.
[00:40:20.738 --> 00:40:22.019]  It was all over the New York Papers.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.701]  See, this is the insanity.
[00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:25.741]  We're all bad.
[00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:26.682]  They're all good.
[00:40:26.722 --> 00:40:27.442]  The government's good.
[00:40:27.943 --> 00:40:29.364]  Look at this fatigue flap.
[00:40:29.624 --> 00:40:33.006]  LHS student was sent home for wearing camouflage outfit.
[00:40:35.868 --> 00:40:38.210]  Shiloh Lewis just wanted to blend in with the crowd.
[00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.452]  Yeah, the camo's been in style for two years.
[00:40:41.513 --> 00:40:45.996]  She's seen camouflage clothing in fashion magazines on the streets of the city and even in Lowell High School.
[00:40:46.737 --> 00:40:54.403]  But a head-to-toe camouflage ensemble got the high school juniors sent home school yesterday.
[00:40:54.463 --> 00:40:57.846]  They took one look at me and said, you've got to get picked up.
[00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:04.351]  Lewis said about school officials, Lewis 16 was wearing a camouflage banana.
[00:41:06.335 --> 00:41:06.595]  I don't
[00:41:29.194 --> 00:41:31.940]  A dress code that needs to be universally enforced.
[00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:37.514]  Not, yeah, wear whatever you want unless we arbitrarily decide we don't like it.
[00:41:39.938 --> 00:41:42.119]  Well, this just shows the micromanaging.
[00:41:42.139 --> 00:41:54.325]  I mean, this is nothing compared to you in your essay write a story about shooting zombies when there's literally five zombie movies a year and probably ten, fifteen TV shows about zombies.
[00:41:54.625 --> 00:41:55.745]  It's in the popular culture.
[00:41:56.205 --> 00:41:59.487]  A third of the video games I've seen on the shelves are about killing zombies.
[00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:03.450]  And a young man, wow I forget it was six months ago, remember?
[00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:14.258]  Really good student, no problem, and he wrote a story about zombies and how the zombies were attacking the town and the zombies actually attacked the school.
[00:42:14.318 --> 00:42:19.502]  It was another school, different name, and the character in the book shoots the zombies.
[00:42:20.003 --> 00:42:20.423]  Boom!
[00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:21.244]  Arrested!
[00:42:22.168 --> 00:42:23.809]  Charged with terrorism.
[00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.191]  And last time I heard, man, he's going down.
[00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:30.674]  And then the book got released, the little essay got released, and it was just a different town, different place.
[00:42:31.035 --> 00:42:32.856]  Zombies attacking the police station, the school.
[00:42:33.837 --> 00:42:35.458]  Folks, I wrote zombie stories.
[00:42:35.498 --> 00:42:36.919]  I remember writing a zombie story.
[00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:42.611]  In the sixth grade, I remember they said, write a fiction story.
[00:42:43.412 --> 00:42:48.116]  And I remember because then two or three other students began copying me, what's yours about Alex?
[00:42:48.156 --> 00:42:48.917]  It's about zombies.
[00:42:49.297 --> 00:42:55.243]  And I remember the teacher going, well, these are pretty good stories, a little violent, but so we've got, you know, three or four stories about zombies here.
[00:42:56.164 --> 00:42:57.585]  Boy, they're similar to each other.
[00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:01.030]  Who, you know, who's looking at whose paper?
[00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:05.614]  I remember Cori, my friend, Cori Strange, was his last name.
[00:43:06.575 --> 00:43:09.657]  Actually, she didn't take it much off, but he'd been looking at mine.
[00:43:09.677 --> 00:43:11.119]  I kind of follow the same storyline.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.043]  We wrote the story and then, well, she started it in class and it turned in a few days later.
[00:43:16.143 --> 00:43:17.083]  I still remember that.
[00:43:17.544 --> 00:43:21.447]  Crystal clear in that little classroom.
[00:43:21.467 --> 00:43:24.129]  But nowadays, I'd be in prison, folks!
[00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:37.474]  That essay, uh, you know, we're in the pickup truck, and my friend's driving the pickup truck, and zombies are trying to climb in the back of the truck because we can't get it started, and I shoot the zombie with a shotgun.
[00:43:38.455 --> 00:43:39.436]  No, you're going to prison.
[00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:43.079]  Again, mind control, thought crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:45.481 --> 00:43:47.002]  Massive total chilling effect.
[00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:52.064]  But give the children all the message that it's okay.
[00:43:52.565 --> 00:43:53.906]  The video games are violent.
[00:43:53.946 --> 00:43:54.987]  The TV is violent.
[00:43:55.007 --> 00:43:56.048]  The movies are violent.
[00:43:56.328 --> 00:43:57.629]  The literature is violent.
[00:43:58.129 --> 00:44:00.791]  Violence has doubled on TV in the last 10 years.
[00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:01.932]  That just came out last week.
[00:44:03.293 --> 00:44:06.856]  Double the number of homicides and rapes and beatings and killings.
[00:44:08.598 --> 00:44:14.583]  And then the level of just overall macabreness, cannibalism and all that's up even higher than a doubling.
[00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:17.365]  They actually had in the study all the stuff broken down.
[00:44:18.792 --> 00:44:19.753]  So we have a doubling.
[00:44:20.453 --> 00:44:34.361]  So send this message and have ultimate fighting on TV and have people actually beating each other to death just on now when you go into a normal restaurant there's people beating each other in some cases to death bare knuckles on TV like it's no big deal.
[00:44:36.723 --> 00:44:45.588]  But then if the children want to play tag and they run down in the woods behind the school to play it, they're going to be arrested.
[00:44:46.573 --> 00:44:48.554]  Well, they're going to be kicked out of school for five days.
[00:44:48.974 --> 00:45:00.619]  Or, if they try to play dodgeball, and they're banned nationwide, and they hide the dodgeballs in a backpack, the kids go behind the school and sneak and play dodgeball, and here comes the cops.
[00:45:01.039 --> 00:45:01.839]  Up against the wall.
[00:45:01.879 --> 00:45:02.599]  I got a taser.
[00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:03.140]  Move back.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.680]  Move back.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.441]  You've been told that's a violent sport.
[00:45:05.501 --> 00:45:06.101]  That's assault.
[00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:07.101]  Up against the wall.
[00:45:07.281 --> 00:45:09.342]  Folks, if you don't believe me, just type it into Google.
[00:45:09.762 --> 00:45:11.023]  You'll read it around the country.
[00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:16.125]  Arrest, being detained, being kicked out, being taken to the principal's office.
[00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:18.066]  It runs the gamut of mental illness.
[00:45:18.707 --> 00:45:19.747]  You played tag.
[00:45:20.087 --> 00:45:21.508]  You played dodgeball.
[00:45:21.668 --> 00:45:22.269]  It's banned.
[00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.909]  It's violent.
[00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:23.349]  It's mean.
[00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:25.590]  But you go home and you watch Ultimate Fighting.
[00:45:28.812 --> 00:45:33.254]  Oh, you took the camera down and went and reported it to your mother.
[00:45:33.915 --> 00:45:35.655]  You're out of school for five days.
[00:45:35.695 --> 00:45:37.556]  And no, we're not going to talk to the media or anybody.
[00:45:37.817 --> 00:45:38.597]  We're just going to do it.
[00:45:40.438 --> 00:45:41.939]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.601]  If I can find my list of callers here.
[00:45:47.562 --> 00:45:50.803]  But, ah, it just makes me angry.
[00:45:51.724 --> 00:45:53.845]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:56.686]  All of this is a no-brainer.
[00:45:59.327 --> 00:46:05.670]  I mean, there's even talk about trying to restrict and ban football, and I wouldn't even, I wouldn't put it past them to implement it.
[00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:07.511]  You're like, they'd never do that.
[00:46:07.551 --> 00:46:08.632]  Well, they're certainly trying.
[00:46:09.685 --> 00:46:11.025]  It's just insane.
[00:46:12.486 --> 00:46:15.347]  Oh, you haven't heard about the moves to ban football in high school?
[00:46:15.387 --> 00:46:18.608]  Because two other people die a year playing it?
[00:46:20.408 --> 00:46:21.669]  Oh yeah, there is a move, folks.
[00:46:22.409 --> 00:46:32.152]  There's actually more injuries, life-threatening broken backs and injuries, these numbers came out a few years ago, than there are children being shot in school from football.
[00:46:32.512 --> 00:46:33.552]  I'm not saying ban football.
[00:46:34.538 --> 00:46:50.050]  But the zero tolerance, see now we have a zero tolerance for terrorists, so we're going to just set up random checkpoints at the malls and the banks on the side of the road and we're going to demand to see your papers and ask you where you're going and give you some flyers because we want you to be aware of the terrorist threat!
[00:46:54.094 --> 00:46:59.698]  It's just bullying in your face folks, training you how to be a slave, just a cowardly little creature.
[00:47:01.295 --> 00:47:04.819]  My new film, The Order of Death, is out, and I'm really proud of it.
[00:47:05.399 --> 00:47:07.081]  It is such an amazing documentary.
[00:47:07.121 --> 00:47:12.226]  We have new footage inside Bohemian Grove, shot by a listener who worked there.
[00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:17.991]  Inside the owl, the effigy, more about the mockument sacrifice, the history of the grove.
[00:47:18.272 --> 00:47:25.679]  We go inside the chalet where the Star Wars project and the Manhattan Project were hatched and operated, according to the Grove Zone annals.
[00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:30.387]  We have a membership list and who was there this year.
[00:47:31.107 --> 00:47:36.529]  And then we go into the history of the Illuminati and the New World War and the time of Skull and Bones and the Ku Klux Klan and all of it.
[00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:37.790]  It's 45 minutes long.
[00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:38.951]  It's THE Order of Death.
[00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:42.232]  Great to put friends and family down in front of and educate.
[00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:43.272]  It's excellent.
[00:47:45.874 --> 00:47:46.854]  THE Order of Death.
[00:47:46.914 --> 00:47:52.536]  But folks, you get that video and my original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove brought up to speed, the 2005 edition
[00:47:55.012 --> 00:48:01.742]  With new video, new clips, new information and cut down from over two hours to an hour and a half together on one DVD.
[00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:03.284]  Two hours, fifteen minutes.
[00:48:04.145 --> 00:48:09.212]  Two separate films together on one DVD or one VHS.
[00:48:09.272 --> 00:48:10.974]  Go to InfoWars.com
[00:48:12.811 --> 00:48:24.435]  And they're $24.95 each additional copy $9.95 because I want you to be able to get three or four copies of this at an affordable price and give them this holiday season, this Christmas.
[00:48:24.515 --> 00:48:26.055]  Give them to your friends and family.
[00:48:27.235 --> 00:48:27.816]  Educate them.
[00:48:27.836 --> 00:48:31.057]  Give them to your pastor, your rabbi, your whatever.
[00:48:32.677 --> 00:48:34.057]  Show it at your local college.
[00:48:34.138 --> 00:48:38.819]  Show it if you're a student of theology.
[00:48:40.372 --> 00:48:41.433]  Put it on AXS TV.
[00:48:41.453 --> 00:48:45.816]  The Order of Death is just hard-hitting, fast-paced 45 minutes.
[00:48:46.296 --> 00:48:49.058]  It's something great to just put people down in front of the TV and educate them.
[00:48:49.078 --> 00:48:54.521]  And then there's part two, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, our whole infiltration, how we did it, and a lot more.
[00:48:55.729 --> 00:48:58.410]  The old video, the original Dark Secrets, is no longer available.
[00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:02.452]  It's this double header, two videos on one tape, one DVD.
[00:49:02.933 --> 00:49:05.014]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:05.634 --> 00:49:07.475]  Infowars.com.

[00:49:11.957 --> 00:49:13.018]  Read about the films.
[00:49:13.558 --> 00:49:15.579]  Order them via the safe, secure shopping cart.
[00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.180]  Look at all the different specials.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.841]  We've got a 4 DVD special.
[00:49:19.401 --> 00:49:20.562]  Where you save, what is it? $45.
[00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:26.447]  Off the regular price, the 4 DVD special.
[00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:31.669]  American Dictators and the New Dark Secrets Order of Death DVD together.
[00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:35.791]  So really it's 5 films, not 4 films, but that doesn't matter.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:38.713]  Martial Law, which is a mini-series, really 3 films in and of itself.
[00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:39.273]  You get that.
[00:49:39.293 --> 00:49:42.835]  9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, almost 3 hours, a mini-series itself.
[00:49:43.175 --> 00:49:44.996]  So you get 2 films that are really mini-series.
[00:49:45.676 --> 00:49:47.017]  Another film that's 2 films.
[00:49:47.577 --> 00:49:49.398]  And then another film, American Dictators.
[00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:50.418]  What is that?
[00:49:50.558 --> 00:49:51.919]  Over 10 hours of footage.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.481]  It's $45 off.

[00:50:09.231 --> 00:50:10.192]  That is the goal.
[00:50:10.312 --> 00:50:16.256]  And you don't have to go fight the crowds and buy all the junk and the fruitcakes and the nose hair trimmers and the

[00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:47.271]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:48.612]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.

[00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:54.916]  What is it?
[00:50:55.016 --> 00:50:55.957]  Six months free or something?
[00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:56.498]  It's ridiculous.
[00:50:56.798 --> 00:50:57.338]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.515 --> 00:51:05.357]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.617 --> 00:51:07.199]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.539 --> 00:51:12.222]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.563 --> 00:51:19.308]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.628 --> 00:51:21.590]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.652]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.732 --> 00:51:29.396]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.616 --> 00:51:33.999]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:41.465]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:52:14.737 --> 00:52:21.183]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:22.985 --> 00:52:26.928]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:27.148 --> 00:52:33.675]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.895 --> 00:52:39.380]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:46.544]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:54:01.497 --> 00:54:12.624]  A prison is openly being built for all of us.
[00:54:12.744 --> 00:54:16.687]  Will we put up with it or will we spread the word about the tyranny and resist it?
[00:54:18.468 --> 00:54:23.271]  Again, we're really good at living in denial, denying what's happening, but you can't deny it anymore.
[00:54:23.331 --> 00:54:25.653]  It's too obvious, it's too in your face, it's overt.
[00:54:25.873 --> 00:54:27.374]  The battle plans are public.
[00:54:28.157 --> 00:54:32.259]  Let's go to Jeff in Ohio, then Jeff, Chris, Joe, Frank, and others.
[00:54:32.339 --> 00:54:33.520]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Jeff.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.660]  Afternoon, Alex.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.861]  Two quick points.
[00:54:36.782 --> 00:54:49.408]  Before, when you said that when you go to schools or these different places that you lose your rights when you walk into these buildings, I submit to you and America that we don't go there.
[00:54:50.429 --> 00:54:52.630]  If that's a place where we lose our civil liberties,
[00:54:53.407 --> 00:54:57.170]  And that's the place where they... Well, understand, sir, you never lose your God-given rights.
[00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.671]  You never lose any of your freedoms.
[00:54:58.731 --> 00:54:59.792]  They just claim it.
[00:54:59.852 --> 00:55:04.295]  Look, the government, again, has claimed that black people weren't human and didn't have rights.
[00:55:04.335 --> 00:55:05.136]  It was pure baloney.
[00:55:05.456 --> 00:55:07.818]  The government can claim that traveling is a privilege.
[00:55:07.858 --> 00:55:10.200]  Everybody knows and the code shows.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.962]  The president shows that that's a fraud.
[00:55:13.603 --> 00:55:18.028]  They just tell you they're allowed to put cameras in the bathroom, and you go, okay.
[00:55:19.169 --> 00:55:20.851]  So all of that's a fraud to begin with.
[00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:21.832]  But yes, I agree.
[00:55:22.192 --> 00:55:24.154]  No one should be in a government training camp.
[00:55:24.835 --> 00:55:25.295]  Exactly.
[00:55:25.415 --> 00:55:28.799]  And these people who are willing to give up, you know,
[00:55:29.412 --> 00:55:33.974]  Other constitutional rights to walk into a sports stadium to watch a stupid game.
[00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:37.996]  I mean, when they started patting people down, I don't go no more.
[00:55:38.356 --> 00:55:39.176]  Well, exactly.
[00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:44.618]  But Andy Rooney says because he can't go to his Giants game, we all need to take microchips to prove we're good.
[00:55:44.638 --> 00:55:45.278]  Did you ever see that?
[00:55:45.579 --> 00:55:45.839]  Yeah.
[00:55:45.999 --> 00:55:46.359]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:46.479 --> 00:55:48.080]  I follow you quite regularly.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.461]  I didn't want to lose my time on this, though.
[00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:54.862]  I'm sure you may have heard of it because your discovery is amazing.
[00:55:55.322 --> 00:55:55.983]  Oh, come on.
[00:55:56.923 --> 00:55:58.824]  Don't trust Teenscreen.
[00:55:59.349 --> 00:56:06.952]  There was an opinion pointed in a Cincinnati newspaper here, that a lady wrote in from Medina, Ohio.
[00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:12.194]  Yeah, that's where they face scan your thumb, print you in.
[00:56:12.334 --> 00:56:20.497]  This is George Vladimir the Impaler Bush's new... But that's also part of New Freedom.
[00:56:20.697 --> 00:56:24.699]  Well, this is where the New Freedom initiative comes in.
[00:56:24.759 --> 00:56:27.320]  They're putting it under the guise
[00:56:30.445 --> 00:56:35.027]  No, they're doing the same thing here at UT with the local public schools.
[00:56:35.428 --> 00:56:38.929]  They're saying they're going to come into the elementary and middle schools and say, do you ever get anxious?
[00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.970]  Oh, that's it.
[00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:41.871]  She's 10, she gets anxious.
[00:56:42.631 --> 00:56:44.032]  We're going to put her on Prozac.
[00:56:45.292 --> 00:56:46.333]  It's diabolical.
[00:56:46.633 --> 00:56:49.354]  Well, I think that we finally got a name to put on it.
[00:56:49.414 --> 00:56:51.155]  You know, I was wondering how it was going to manifest itself.
[00:56:51.175 --> 00:56:52.856]  Well, they have multiple teen screens.
[00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:57.338]  One of the teen screens is putting your kid in a database, fingerprinting them and doing all that.
[00:56:57.758 --> 00:57:05.602]  Ah, well this one is a suicide prevention, and it's a passive consent.
[00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:08.523]  If you don't send in your notice to the school,
[00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.551]  You don't want them to be involved in this.
[00:57:11.671 --> 00:57:12.592]  They get tested.
[00:57:12.992 --> 00:57:16.514]  Well, I'll never, and that gets them into the psychiatric system and will ruin your life, folks.
[00:57:16.554 --> 00:57:18.595]  And it gets them all talking about suicide.
[00:57:18.875 --> 00:57:29.081]  And all the studies show introducing that idea and having everyone talk about it makes it trendy and has actually, since they instituted all these anti-suicide programs,
[00:57:29.833 --> 00:57:32.774]  It has radically increased, and there's an article I've got to write.
[00:57:32.814 --> 00:57:33.935]  I've got those statistics.
[00:57:34.135 --> 00:57:35.355]  They're killing our kids!
[00:57:35.555 --> 00:57:37.236]  You know, suicide isn't good.
[00:57:37.536 --> 00:57:38.837]  Let's talk about it.
[00:57:39.137 --> 00:57:43.599]  Let's have death education, where we lie in coffins, federally funded.
[00:57:44.619 --> 00:57:46.340]  Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, don't believe me?
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:51.082]  Just type in, type in lying in coffins, death education, you'll get it nationwide.
[00:57:51.662 --> 00:57:56.144]  And then your little 12-year-old girl thinks, ooh, that's the cool thing to do.
[00:57:56.664 --> 00:57:59.325]  Romeo and Juliet did it, and she goes and hangs herself.
[00:58:00.151 --> 00:58:02.032]  Oh, she's so stylish.
[00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:06.314]  Then all the other kids run in fear, and the parents all jack them up on Prozac.
[00:58:06.915 --> 00:58:08.675]  It's mind control, sir.
[00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:10.776]  It's Soviet-style mind control.
[00:58:11.117 --> 00:58:18.040]  I just wanted to let you know that we are fighting the New World Order here in Cincinnati, Ohio, and that we will not give up.
[00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:20.101]  We will not relent.
[00:58:20.321 --> 00:58:21.482]  Well, we can't.
[00:58:21.802 --> 00:58:22.522]  We can't do it.
[00:58:22.602 --> 00:58:23.403]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:26.292]  Look, I mean, this is not a joke, folks.
[00:58:26.312 --> 00:58:27.073]  This is not a game.
[00:58:27.533 --> 00:58:29.913]  New Freedom, Team Map, Team Screen.
[00:58:30.693 --> 00:58:32.854]  Forget the UT name of it.
[00:58:32.914 --> 00:58:34.794]  And the drug companies, the documents are public.
[00:58:34.854 --> 00:58:38.014]  It's openly to put half the kids on drugs.
[00:58:41.475 --> 00:58:45.376]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.716 --> 00:58:46.516]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.536 --> 00:58:46.676]  Hello?
[00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:57.990]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.671 --> 00:58:59.711]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:01.532]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.193 --> 00:59:03.013]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:04.674]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.334 --> 00:59:08.996]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.517 --> 00:59:13.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.412 --> 00:59:48.307]  Basically elite corporations controlled by old money families have seized control of western governments and are directing those governments to force the population to buy their products, their Prozac, their Ritalin, to force you to take it, to force you to hand over your land, to force you to accept basically total enslavement by these individuals.
[00:59:49.448 --> 00:59:50.509]  That's all that's happening here.
[00:59:51.508 --> 01:00:00.570]  We've got a guest coming up to talk, it'll only be about 20 minutes, about how all these poor babies are being killed, and they're surviving in many cases.
[01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.211]  Yeah, a lot of babies survive abortion.
[01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:04.911]  If you didn't know about that, you're going to find out about it.
[01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:06.732]  Jeff in Colorado.
[01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:07.592]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:00:07.612 --> 01:00:08.052]  Go ahead.
[01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.112]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:09.132 --> 01:00:10.972]  Yeah, I just wanted to make a real quick comment.
[01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.013]  Well, one quick thing first.
[01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:17.494]  Everybody's talking about the mind control, and you know, a lot of people
[01:00:17.927 --> 01:00:18.947]  I really don't understand.
[01:00:19.168 --> 01:00:23.129]  The CIA has been using mind control as something they call MK-Ultra.
[01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.771]  And this has been going on for decades.
[01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:30.773]  And of course, they've implemented this throughout the country.
[01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:35.215]  And I wanted to say that real quick in case people are not aware of what's going on.
[01:00:35.275 --> 01:00:37.736]  It's CIA MK-Ultra.
[01:00:38.196 --> 01:00:40.838]  And you can type that in on the internet and find out all about that.
[01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:47.601]  But anyways, I just wanted to bring everybody back to reality on the Bush 50-minute speech yesterday.
[01:00:48.254 --> 01:00:50.195]  On justifying the Iraq War, Alex.
[01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:53.196]  Now, he's selling dreams to the American people.
[01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:57.558]  First of all, bragging about his 35-page Iraq Reform Report.
[01:00:58.178 --> 01:01:02.940]  And, of course, thanking all the people for the Iraq War, when actually he's committed a federal offense.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.861]  And, uh, I wanted to also say this.
[01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:12.044]  There's a former government agent named John Gary Peeler, who used to work for the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[01:01:12.634 --> 01:01:30.042]  And John actually did a 30-minute tape or a movie with the BBC, which is the British broadcasting channel, the largest channel in the world, and, you know, a piece about the Oklahoma City bombing, and he even stated that basically he's a former government agent saying that Bush is practicing Nazi terrorism.
[01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:39.866]  And of course, as far as the Iraq War, you know, this was facilitated by an extreme president, the village idiot,
[01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:47.099]  A Dr. Kevorkian Vice President, lusting for war and all, and dumb-dumb Rumsfeld.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:55.625]  You know, basically, the neocons and a cowardly Congress that violated its most basic responsibility to the nation.
[01:01:56.145 --> 01:02:01.989]  You know, it's all of these people, the politicians, the Pentagon, the CIA-controlled media, who misled the U.S.
[01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:08.233]  No, I hear you, and I thank you for all those points, and it's all accurate from my lexicon, but look,
[01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.340]  We have been tipping the balance.
[01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:15.271]  Only 28% approval now, and it's plunging.
[01:02:16.005 --> 01:02:25.828]  And so you see Hillary jump on the other side of the saw, Clinton jumps on it, Chuckie Schumer jumps on it, Lieberman jumps on it, Bush starts jumping up and down on it.
[01:02:26.168 --> 01:02:32.050]  If you don't support the war, you hate the troops, you're Al-Qaeda, we're winning, it's wonderful, I'm going to declare victory.
[01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.351]  I thought you did that on the aircraft carrier strutting around two years ago, Bush.
[01:02:35.891 --> 01:02:36.411]  Exactly.
[01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:44.694]  And, you know, basically I don't think anybody realizes the, you know, the catastrophic, you know, what this has cost them over 2,000 American lives.
[01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:52.893]  Alex, if you go to FreeWebs.com forward slash Bush Crimes, it tells you all about the Iraq War and the destruction.
[01:02:52.953 --> 01:02:55.556]  I mean, it has some graphic pictures about what's really going on.
[01:02:55.616 --> 01:02:57.838]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:02:57.878 --> 01:02:59.479]  I want to thank you for that call.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.241]  We've got to go to break here.
[01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:05.385]  And when we get back, we've got a guest coming up.
[01:03:05.445 --> 01:03:06.966]  And don't worry, we'll get to your other calls.
[01:03:06.986 --> 01:03:07.647]  I know you're holding.
[01:03:08.473 --> 01:03:12.695]  But, uh, we've got this guest coming up concerning all these babies that survive abortions.
[01:03:12.795 --> 01:03:16.696]  It's pretty serious information just to bring it home to everybody how real this is.
[01:03:16.796 --> 01:03:23.119]  But, um, no, I heard Rumsfeld on the radio yesterday, uh, saying how wonderful it is and all the troops love it.
[01:03:23.379 --> 01:03:24.580]  Of course, that's a complete lie.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.741]  And, uh, remember, they lied to bring us to war.
[01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:33.943]  And, uh, now they're trying to get us to go into Iran and Syria.
[01:03:35.184 --> 01:03:36.964]  And they're just congenital liars.
[01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:38.165]  Period.
[01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:39.294]  Period.
[01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.197]  And they want to stay in Iraq as long as possible.
[01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:43.678]  They do not want to win in Iraq.
[01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:45.400]  By losing, they win.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.841]  That's their official plan.
[01:03:48.082 --> 01:03:50.665]  And... It just blows me away.
[01:03:53.087 --> 01:03:57.451]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.631 --> 01:04:02.055]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:03.016]  There is a chance
[01:04:04.636 --> 01:04:05.757]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.471 --> 01:04:33.853]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.073 --> 01:04:39.454]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:54.645]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.785 --> 01:04:58.888]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:01.890]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:08.675]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.879]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:14.462]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:24.755]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptozene, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:25.695]  MTBE.
[01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:26.235]  Radon 222.
[01:05:26.836 --> 01:05:28.816]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[01:05:28.976 --> 01:05:34.078]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:34.218 --> 01:05:41.981]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.001 --> 01:05:42.421]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.501 --> 01:05:44.202]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:56.170]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:05:56.290 --> 01:06:01.333]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:06:01.573 --> 01:06:07.756]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:06:08.017 --> 01:06:13.620]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:19.446]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:06:19.686 --> 01:06:23.530]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:28.816]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:06:29.016 --> 01:06:29.217]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:06:31.619 --> 01:06:35.662]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:06:35.822 --> 01:06:40.005]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?

[01:06:57.746 --> 01:06:58.387]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.047 --> 01:07:00.108]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:01.928]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:03.389]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.010]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:09.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:13.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.758 --> 01:07:27.923]  Well, here in just a few moments we're going to be talking to Dr. Stuart Campbell, joining us from the United Kingdom.
[01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.364]  We're honored to have him.
[01:07:30.345 --> 01:07:34.308]  And yes, Chris and Joe and Frank and others, we're going to be getting your calls as well.
[01:07:34.328 --> 01:07:37.910]  We're just going to keep the doctor for about 25 minutes or so.
[01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:40.012]  Very busy.
[01:07:41.853 --> 01:07:43.334]  I was aware of this in the U.S.
[01:07:43.374 --> 01:07:47.417]  I mean, I've interviewed people who were dug out of dipsty dumpsters, out of dumpsters.
[01:07:48.742 --> 01:07:49.502]  And saved.
[01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:54.663]  And who are out, you know, with families and living great lives today and giving speeches against abortion.
[01:07:55.684 --> 01:08:00.505]  Hundreds of babies a year that we know of are, but here in the U.S.
[01:08:00.525 --> 01:08:01.525]  they just quietly kill them.
[01:08:03.605 --> 01:08:08.506]  Now, in England, this is the Sunday Times of London, 50 babies a year are alive after abortion.
[01:08:08.546 --> 01:08:16.768]  A government agency is launching an inquiry and the doctors report that 50 babies a year are born alive after botched National Health Service abortions.
[01:08:17.418 --> 01:08:21.119]  See, they go by the book and are reporting it over there, over here, and it's just termination time.
[01:08:21.559 --> 01:08:23.900]  And they throw them live in trash cans and buckets of water.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.341]  It's a nightmare, folks.
[01:08:25.681 --> 01:08:37.144]  The investigation by the Confidential Inquiry into Mental and Child Health comes with growing unease among clinicians over a legal ambiguity that could see them being charged with infanticide.
[01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:45.227]  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which regulates methods of abortion, has also mounted its own investigation.
[01:08:46.696 --> 01:09:05.187]  and uh... it just goes into what's happening in the guidelines for the babies born after more than twenty one weeks and six days of gestation should have their heart stopped by an injection of potassium chloride before being delivered in practice few doctors are willing or able to perform the delicate procedure.
[01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.367]  Couldn't I get into the woman?
[01:09:07.168 --> 01:09:15.693]  uh... for the abortion of younger babies fetuses labor is induced by drugs in the expectation that the infant will not survive the birth process
[01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:23.424]  Guidelines say that doctors should ensure the drugs they use prevent such babies being born alive at all.
[01:09:24.165 --> 01:09:37.977]  But we now go to an individual who is involved in this by researching and investigating it and that's Dr. Stuart Campbell.
[01:09:38.317 --> 01:09:39.578]  Doctor, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:40.139 --> 01:09:41.580]  Yes, hello.
[01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:50.935]  Tell us just a little bit about yourself and exactly, you're here in the Sunday Times article, but why don't you describe your involvement in this for the listeners?
[01:09:51.995 --> 01:09:57.220]  Okay, well, I'm a doctor, obstetrician-gynecologist.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.584]  I've retired from the National Health Service, so I'm just in private practice now.
[01:10:02.844 --> 01:10:09.289]  But I've spent all my life really in the National Health Service as a professor and carrying out research.
[01:10:11.169 --> 01:10:12.070]  I'm teaching of course.
[01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:27.786]  I began to take an interest in the subject of late termination of pregnancy a few years ago when I studied the behavior of fetuses inside the uterus with 3D, 4D ultrasound.
[01:10:28.146 --> 01:10:29.788]  You're a pioneer of studying that, sorry.
[01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:30.609]  Yes, yes.
[01:10:35.794 --> 01:10:46.685]  I began to actually change my view on abortion, even as early as 12 weeks, because at 12 weeks you can see such advanced behavioral patterns in the fetus.
[01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:49.588]  You know, it makes stepping movements, it holds its toes.
[01:10:50.089 --> 01:10:56.115]  They're very, very complex movements, you know, and it will yawn and it will suck the fingers.
[01:10:58.147 --> 01:11:06.032]  And as you move after 12 weeks you begin to see sort of emotional expressions on the fetal face.
[01:11:06.453 --> 01:11:25.585]  You will see the baby crying and by 20 weeks you'll see little smiles and you know so you know the fetuses are quite clearly responsive and in an emotional way and I began to think this is ridiculous to be terminating fetuses as developed as this.
[01:11:26.345 --> 01:11:27.126]  Now we have
[01:11:27.734 --> 01:11:33.277]  There's a limit for termination of pregnancy in the United Kingdom of 24 weeks.
[01:11:34.117 --> 01:11:48.724]  For severe fetal abnormality you can even do it later, but for social terminations, which is 99% of all terminations are done for what they call social reasons, 24 weeks is the limit and I think that's much too late.
[01:11:50.204 --> 01:11:53.826]  Ultimately I'd like to see it reduced to 12 weeks, but
[01:11:55.302 --> 01:12:02.146]  At least for a first step, I've been writing articles and pleading with the government to reduce it at least to 18 weeks.
[01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:14.612]  Because there are over 7,000 terminations done in the United Kingdom after 18 weeks, and I think that's just way too much.
[01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:22.697]  I mean, the babies that survive, these 50 babies that survive, probably is underreporting, actually.
[01:12:24.063 --> 01:12:31.371]  Let's be clear, generally isn't only about 1-10% are actually reported?
[01:12:32.893 --> 01:12:38.659]  Well, I'm not sure how many are underreported, but it could be.
[01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:45.306]  I just know generally with medicine that only a fraction of instances of anything get reported.
[01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:52.676]  Well, we do have very strict abortion regulations, and they require detailed documentation.
[01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:58.679]  Every abortion that's done, you know, there has to be very, very detailed documentation that goes to the government.
[01:12:58.859 --> 01:13:03.860]  Well, specifically, how are these babies surviving, and then what happens once they survive?
[01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:13.364]  Well, what happens... I mean, the college, which is the regulatory authority, says any fetus over 21 weeks
[01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:17.270]  That we should do an injection into the fetal heart.
[01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:19.592]  You know, I think this is ridiculous.
[01:13:19.652 --> 01:13:26.639]  I don't think we should be doing them at 21 weeks, but what they say is we should put an injection of potassium chloride into the fetal heart.
[01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:27.960]  Now that requires skill.
[01:13:28.421 --> 01:13:38.691]  You mentioned that does it get into the mother, but it doesn't if you do it skillfully and put it into the fetal heart and then the fetal heart stops and the fetus then is not born alive.
[01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:41.454]  But of course, very few people do that.
[01:13:41.494 --> 01:13:42.915]  They don't have the skill to do that.
[01:13:43.175 --> 01:13:48.859]  You know, we're just here talking about killing babies, like we're talking about buying a pound of cheese or something.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:49.620]  Wow.
[01:13:50.661 --> 01:13:57.626]  Yeah, I mean, but you know, the pro-life and pro-choice lobbies are very virulent.
[01:13:57.946 --> 01:14:08.153]  And whenever I say we should reduce the limit to 18 weeks, I'm attacked by the pro-choice lobby as if I was, you know,
[01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:09.344]  I'm going to
[01:14:28.107 --> 01:14:29.147]  Totally formed in there.
[01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:38.669]  So the FDA has been trying to ban it, been trying to prosecute even a prominent Austin doctor for simply allowing women to see their babies even though there's no health risk.
[01:14:39.029 --> 01:14:44.430]  And clearly, I'm sure you're aware, some of the memos came out that it's because they don't want it to hurt the abortion industry.
[01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:45.050]  Were you aware of that?
[01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:54.372]  I knew there were some statements from the... I think it was the FDA made a statement saying that they didn't encourage
[01:14:55.491 --> 01:15:03.436]  Uh, these scans for what they call entertainment purposes, or... Yeah, and then they went after an Austin doctor for it.
[01:15:03.557 --> 01:15:05.358]  But these are not entertaining scans.
[01:15:05.378 --> 01:15:06.458]  They're bonding scans.
[01:15:06.498 --> 01:15:09.140]  These are allowing the parents to love their child.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.823]  You know, I'm really... This is allowing them to decide if they want to chop him up!
[01:15:13.283 --> 01:15:13.543]  Yeah.
[01:15:13.883 --> 01:15:17.886]  Well, then, yes, I agree, and I think we should encourage
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.344]  You know that anybody wanting a termination of pregnancy should see the fetus in 3D.
[01:15:23.684 --> 01:15:23.945]  Yeah.
[01:15:24.545 --> 01:15:42.601]  But, anyway, you know, I think this is, there's a lot of, it's tough as well, because a lot of sonographers, not doctors, are doing this, they're setting up the 4D scans in shopping malls, and the doctors don't like this, because it's not under their control.
[01:15:43.397 --> 01:15:52.142]  So, there's a lot of reasons why these statements come out about, you know, that they don't want 4D scanning.
[01:15:53.143 --> 01:15:53.763]  Absolutely.
[01:15:53.823 --> 01:15:59.387]  So, specifically, 50 babies we know of in the UK a year, what happens?
[01:15:59.427 --> 01:16:00.727]  The baby survives the birth?
[01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:06.551]  And, I mean, what happens here quietly in the U.S., this has been in our news, is they just throw them in a bucket of water or throw them in the trash can?
[01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:09.993]  Are you familiar with the babies that have been dug out of dumpsters?
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:33.475]  No, I don't know that story, but I mean, you know, in the UK, generally these late terminations are done in hospitals where there are pediatricians, and what we find is the pediatricians rush down, of course, they're called by the nurses who are distressed to see the baby moving, and then the pediatrician tries to resuscitate the child.
[01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:45.548]  Of course, 50, they say, survive this, but there are hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands, who don't survive this, but still undergo tremendous distress.
[01:16:45.788 --> 01:16:56.516]  Well, this shows the schizophrenia, though, Doctor, Professor, is that, oh, let's kill the baby, oh, we're upset it's alive, and oh, God, now it's alive, we've got to take care of it, oh, look at the poor little baby!
[01:16:56.756 --> 01:16:58.838]  I mean, this is total schizophrenia!
[01:16:58.998 --> 01:17:00.999]  I mean, this is split personality!
[01:17:01.559 --> 01:17:01.760]  Yeah.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.022]  No, there was one case recorded in this article where
[01:17:05.656 --> 01:17:09.016]  A woman had three attempts at termination and eventually...
[01:17:10.381 --> 01:17:22.090]  Uh, you know, the termination succeeded, the baby was alive, and then she said, I want to keep the child, don't kill it, you know, I want to resuscitate it, but now it's handicapped.
[01:17:22.531 --> 01:17:24.672]  So they're torturing it.
[01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:25.693]  Doctor, I want to repeat that.
[01:17:25.853 --> 01:17:33.219]  They try to kill it three times, they finally kill the baby, and then she finally has her soul re-enter her body, and she says, no, I want my baby.
[01:17:33.659 --> 01:17:35.521]  Yeah, but they didn't actually kill it.
[01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:38.363]  I mean, it survived all these attempts, and then
[01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:43.028]  She said, listen, I want to keep this baby when she saw it.
[01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:48.569]  And so they, they put it in a ventilator, et cetera, but it's, it's got problems.
[01:17:49.009 --> 01:17:50.329]  Yeah.
[01:17:51.129 --> 01:18:06.552]  So, you know, we, we've got an ongoing problem here and, and I think the only solution really is strict regulation and absolutely none that, well, I mean, it would cause a bit of a crisis if re-registered to 12 weeks at the present time.
[01:18:07.415 --> 01:18:13.538]  Because our health system couldn't cope with the large numbers of terminations.
[01:18:14.239 --> 01:18:20.422]  But I think we should reduce it to 18 weeks.
[01:18:20.942 --> 01:18:21.142]  Yeah.
[01:18:21.802 --> 01:18:24.904]  But at 18 weeks, I mean, we've already got a developed baby right there.
[01:18:26.185 --> 01:18:27.445]  Yeah, why not?
[01:18:27.465 --> 01:18:34.309]  At 12 weeks, I mean, you would just be amazed at the complexity of the behavior of these babies.
[01:18:34.349 --> 01:18:35.289]  They're just beautiful.
[01:18:35.509 --> 01:18:36.410]  They're beautiful babies.
[01:18:37.743 --> 01:18:46.455]  But see, we like to just claim they're little balls of tissue, but when we see the human there, it's really causing a shake-up.
[01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.918]  Doctor, please stay with us a little bit longer.
[01:18:48.938 --> 01:18:49.920]  We're so honored to have you.
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:50.721]  Please stay with us.
[01:18:53.775 --> 01:19:00.657]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:19:00.797 --> 01:19:13.661]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:19:14.261 --> 01:19:15.702]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:19:15.862 --> 01:19:19.343]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:19:19.603 --> 01:19:23.385]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:19:23.645 --> 01:19:28.627]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:19:28.887 --> 01:19:30.588]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:19:30.768 --> 01:19:31.309]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:04.552]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.732 --> 01:20:12.301]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.705]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.966 --> 01:20:21.733]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:22.014 --> 01:20:28.162]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:20:28.502 --> 01:20:32.405]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:34.346]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:34.526 --> 01:20:40.490]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:20:53.699 --> 01:20:54.160]  Gold.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.781]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:56.041 --> 01:21:02.126]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:02.306 --> 01:21:06.149]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:06.489 --> 01:21:08.390]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.712]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:10.872 --> 01:21:15.856]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat currency.
[01:21:15.896 --> 01:21:16.456]  We're good to go.
[01:21:31.803 --> 01:21:32.384]  I don't know.
[01:21:55.097 --> 01:22:01.740]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?

[01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:48.944]  of the TriVortex Technology products, wishing you and yours a joyous holiday season!
[01:23:09.991 --> 01:23:14.014]  You can read the Times of London story up on infowars.com right now.
[01:23:16.937 --> 01:23:22.461]  We're talking to doctor, also professor, Stuart Campbell, former professor at St.
[01:23:22.481 --> 01:23:23.723]  George Hospital, London.
[01:23:25.004 --> 01:23:38.395]  And he's joining us here to talk about the large group, I mean, 50, and he's saying that's probably unreported, children, babies, who survived the abortions.
[01:23:39.284 --> 01:23:54.071]  So I guess with the regulations there in England, that if the baby leaves the vaginal canal still with a heart rate and still with respiration, then the hospital isn't allowed to kill.
[01:23:55.612 --> 01:24:08.960]  When you talk about them trying to kill the baby three times, do they do what they do here in the U.S., basically just keep the baby in contact with the mother touching her, claiming that the baby is still not delivered?
[01:24:09.501 --> 01:24:10.942]  How specifically does that work, Doctor?
[01:24:12.563 --> 01:24:20.808]  They give prostaglandins, these substances that contract the uterus, they give pessaries and it makes the uterus contract.
[01:24:21.288 --> 01:24:23.830]  But as soon as the fetus is born,
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.782]  Then, if it's over 18 weeks, then it's usually moving.
[01:24:27.802 --> 01:24:38.367]  I mean, a lot of people think that going through the birth canal will kill the baby, but most of the babies will survive.
[01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.468]  So they're usually moving.
[01:24:40.328 --> 01:24:45.591]  And by the time you're over 20 weeks, they're trying to breathe and they're moving their limbs.
[01:24:46.329 --> 01:24:50.433]  Now, by the time a pediatrician gets there, of course, most of them have died.
[01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:51.053]  Okay.
[01:24:51.573 --> 01:25:03.103]  But, when you get to maybe 22 or 23 weeks, the babies are surviving for a longer period of time and then the pediatrician will try and resuscitate the child.
[01:25:03.163 --> 01:25:06.526]  He's got to... He'd be accused of infanticide if he didn't do it.
[01:25:07.386 --> 01:25:09.648]  So, he's trained to
[01:25:10.914 --> 01:25:12.435]  Resuscitate babies.
[01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:15.517]  Not here in the U.S., Doctor, and I know you're an expert on abortion.
[01:25:15.537 --> 01:25:17.578]  It's been all over our news over the years.
[01:25:17.598 --> 01:25:19.019]  They throw them right in buckets of water.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.120]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.862]  I honestly don't think that would happen in the U.K.
[01:25:24.122 --> 01:25:27.044]  I think the nurses are very sensitive to this.
[01:25:27.484 --> 01:25:31.446]  I think the nurses in our hospital actually are upset by these late terminations.
[01:25:31.606 --> 01:25:32.527]  No, I'm sure they are.
[01:25:33.371 --> 01:25:38.435]  And a lot of them, in fact, just don't go for gynecological nursing because of this.
[01:25:39.275 --> 01:25:40.056]  That's right.
[01:25:40.076 --> 01:25:43.478]  You've got a big shortage in the gynecological nursing because of this, don't you?
[01:25:43.898 --> 01:25:44.278]  Oh, yes.
[01:25:44.358 --> 01:25:45.239]  Huge, huge.
[01:25:45.259 --> 01:25:49.322]  Well, a huge shortage of nurses altogether, but in gynecological nursing, very severe.
[01:25:49.542 --> 01:25:53.565]  And I think a lot of it is to do with these late terminations of pregnancy.
[01:25:53.585 --> 01:25:55.546]  And I know some hospitals don't do them at all.
[01:25:56.707 --> 01:25:58.048]  I mean, they've just stopped doing them.
[01:25:58.168 --> 01:26:01.470]  So it's just very few hospitals who specialize in this.
[01:26:02.477 --> 01:26:06.520]  Well, Doctor, you've pioneered looking and studying these 3D systems.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:09.181]  We're putting some images up on my website of them right now for people.
[01:26:09.862 --> 01:26:14.164]  It seems that that really is starting to turn the tide and that poll numbers here in the U.S.
[01:26:14.204 --> 01:26:18.647]  are now showing that abortion is more unpopular by far than it is popular.
[01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:24.931]  Are you seeing a sea change against abortion and this denial that these are human beings we're terminating?
[01:26:26.086 --> 01:26:38.253]  Yes, I think in public opinion, most of the polls done show overwhelming opinion among people that they should reduce it drastically.
[01:26:38.773 --> 01:26:41.495]  I think most people feel it should be reduced.
[01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:45.524]  You know, perhaps to 12 weeks, but certainly a big reduction.
[01:26:46.004 --> 01:26:53.005]  The only people opposing this are the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Obstetricians.
[01:26:53.525 --> 01:27:05.028]  So these organizations, which I suppose are responding to, you know, pressure groups, there are a lot of women pressure groups, the pro-choice pressure groups who are
[01:27:06.068 --> 01:27:16.373]  You know, trying to influence the official bodies, you know, to... You know, they ought to make those people go in and watch these babies fighting for their lives on those tables if they love death so much.
[01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:17.408]  Hmm.
[01:27:18.168 --> 01:27:18.668]  Yeah, I know.
[01:27:18.949 --> 01:27:23.010]  I think you're absolutely right that they don't watch this process.
[01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:24.770]  It's only the nurses or the doctors.
[01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.731]  And it's usually the nurses, actually.
[01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:33.372]  The doctor puts in there, the pessary goes away, and the woman delivers several hours later.
[01:27:33.452 --> 01:27:36.053]  And it's the nurses left to decide, what do I do?
[01:27:36.653 --> 01:27:38.074]  Should we call the pediatrician?
[01:27:38.114 --> 01:27:39.334]  Should we just let it wriggle?
[01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:40.751]  I think so.
[01:28:08.047 --> 01:28:17.673]  My website, but it's not a viral version, but you can see moving images on info at createhealth.org.
[01:28:18.034 --> 01:28:26.379]  Info at createhealth, all one word, dot org, and you'll see the moving images of babies.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:32.704]  Okay sir, we're going to link to that and I'd like to be able to get you back up in the future as there are more developments.
[01:28:33.383 --> 01:28:34.524]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:28:34.965 --> 01:28:35.345]  Take care.
[01:28:35.705 --> 01:28:39.288]  We'll be right back to take your calls and cover more news.
[01:28:43.572 --> 01:28:44.473]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:46.574]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.475 --> 01:28:50.257]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.721 --> 01:28:56.303]  Government is best what governs least.
[01:28:56.883 --> 01:28:58.164]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:01.267]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:01.733 --> 01:29:04.355]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:33.574]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:29:33.754 --> 01:29:34.074]  Have you?
[01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:36.176]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:29:36.656 --> 01:29:40.398]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:29:41.559 --> 01:29:44.401]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:29:44.861 --> 01:29:45.901]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:29:46.462 --> 01:29:47.642]  Osama Bin Forgotten.

[01:29:53.467 --> 01:29:59.691]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:05.995]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.295 --> 01:30:14.720]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.981 --> 01:30:21.985]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.305 --> 01:30:27.108]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.328 --> 01:30:32.732]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.072 --> 01:30:36.154]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[01:30:53.486 --> 01:30:55.869]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:59.933]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:01.074]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.515 --> 01:31:05.639]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.859 --> 01:31:10.043]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:15.309]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:19.271]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:31:54.632 --> 01:31:59.774]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.455 --> 01:32:02.816]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.396 --> 01:32:07.578]  Coming up, I want to put a little clip off the Colbert Report that follows the Daily Show.
[01:32:08.886 --> 01:32:10.306]  We have another guest as well.
[01:32:10.346 --> 01:32:11.987]  It'll be with us another 20-30 minutes.
[01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:13.827]  In the next hour, we'll also have open phones then.
[01:32:13.847 --> 01:32:20.669]  I'm about to go to Chris and Joe and Frank and Radkin and many others.
[01:32:21.289 --> 01:32:23.170]  Radkin and others that are holding patiently.
[01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:31.792]  Before I do that, and before I go to Debbie for a few minutes that's in the wings, and Debbie Morrow, let me just say this about abortion.
[01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:36.473]  It's really been on my heart, on my soul to expose it, to talk more about it.
[01:32:37.913 --> 01:32:51.967]  For so many leftist listeners that we have, who like the show because I expose George Bush, and I talk about the New World Order, and I expose the corporations, we really are, we look at things from justice, and from decency, and from common sense.
[01:32:53.168 --> 01:32:56.532]  We don't look at things as ideological litmus tests.
[01:32:58.542 --> 01:32:59.542]  And we're winning this fight.
[01:32:59.582 --> 01:33:04.963]  We've gone from 15 years ago, 70 plus percent of people were pro-abortion.
[01:33:04.983 --> 01:33:08.444]  The vast majority of people polled had been convinced it was a good thing.
[01:33:09.204 --> 01:33:16.406]  That propaganda has now been reversed and upwards of 70 percent are against it and the numbers are even higher in young people right now.
[01:33:17.606 --> 01:33:20.587]  So I know it's a religious sacrament for some of you out there.
[01:33:20.607 --> 01:33:22.968]  You think it's real special and sweet and cute and you're right.
[01:33:24.288 --> 01:33:24.428]  And
[01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:29.705]  You think it's just so wonderful and woman's got a right to do this, blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:30.025 --> 01:33:31.087]  What about the health of the woman?
[01:33:31.127 --> 01:33:31.847]  That's all baloney.
[01:33:32.068 --> 01:33:36.092]  They've always terminated pregnancies if the woman's life was in danger.
[01:33:36.733 --> 01:33:41.238]  It's just, oh, we went in, we were unable to save the baby during the surgery, it didn't live.
[01:33:41.278 --> 01:33:42.359]  It wasn't called abortion.
[01:33:42.439 --> 01:33:44.782]  It was an emergency procedure to save your life.
[01:33:45.042 --> 01:33:47.545]  They tried to save both lives, but the mother came first.
[01:33:49.472 --> 01:33:58.355]  And this business of birth control, because people are too lazy to use birth control, or they don't take it right, or they're doing all this, and they're out there, and they kill these babies.
[01:33:58.375 --> 01:34:13.860]  You know, I am just... I repent that I haven't done enough to stop this, or speak out against this, or resist this, and... Look, folks, there's... You heard them.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.721]  They sit there and just hope the baby will die.
[01:34:15.741 --> 01:34:17.982]  They just sit there, and these are human beings.
[01:34:19.267 --> 01:34:29.855]  And listen, if you don't have respect for the human form, and the human soul, and the human seed, and that little creature, then you don't have respect for yourself.
[01:34:29.895 --> 01:34:30.515]  Give me a break.
[01:34:30.555 --> 01:34:35.119]  I mean, abortion is part and parcel of all these other evils that we've been taught are good.
[01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:37.586]  And you've hardened your heart.
[01:34:37.626 --> 01:34:44.492]  A lot of these women out there that have had abortions, all these men that have paid for them, you could repent and your heart would be soft again and God would forgive you.
[01:34:44.993 --> 01:34:51.418]  And then you could fight against this, but instead you decide to vehemently fight for it, and to push it, and to drive it.
[01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:59.586]  Number one, cervical cancer, and uterine cancer, and fallopian cancer,
[01:35:02.896 --> 01:35:09.942]  All those forms of cancer massively, I mean in some cases it's a quadrupling or even more, when you've had an abortion.
[01:35:09.962 --> 01:35:12.243]  When you've had multiple abortions, they skyrocket.
[01:35:12.884 --> 01:35:14.745]  Because the body is not designed to do this.
[01:35:14.765 --> 01:35:18.028]  If there's a problem with that pregnancy, your body is designed where it will terminate it itself.
[01:35:18.048 --> 01:35:19.069]  99% of the time.
[01:35:24.449 --> 01:35:27.051]  Again, this is just part of this culture of death.
[01:35:27.111 --> 01:35:29.813]  The elite doesn't want to pay for disabled kids.
[01:35:29.833 --> 01:35:32.655]  The elite doesn't want to have to pay for poor people's kids.
[01:35:32.675 --> 01:35:46.744]  The elite, you know, these Margaret Singer, Nazi sinners are on all the black and poor white and Hispanic areas and they hail them as some loving liberal thing when she calls you weeds and worthless scum and, you know, we love you Margaret Singer, you call us worthless scum.
[01:35:48.085 --> 01:35:49.766]  It's so, it's eugenics.
[01:35:51.929 --> 01:35:56.632]  And women don't know that there are groups that will put them up in a house, pay them.
[01:35:57.853 --> 01:36:02.056]  You'll leave after having a child with a brand new car and 50 grand in the bank, on average.
[01:36:05.739 --> 01:36:10.222]  Well, if everybody starts having abortions, or stops having abortions, then that thing will go down.
[01:36:10.242 --> 01:36:10.742]  No, it won't.
[01:36:10.762 --> 01:36:16.186]  There's actually more people wanting children each year to adopt them than there are abortions.
[01:36:17.467 --> 01:36:19.288]  These are the actual numbers.
[01:36:20.094 --> 01:36:21.175]  You don't have to be scarred.
[01:36:21.195 --> 01:36:22.156]  You don't have to feel bad.
[01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:30.504]  You don't have to massively tear your womb up and really end up having to have a hysterectomy later when you get cancer, which you most assuredly are going to get.
[01:36:30.524 --> 01:36:41.634]  I mean, everything, look, if you just understood, all the problems in our society come from thinking that we're not connected to everything else.
[01:36:42.955 --> 01:36:44.777]  From not understanding you reap what you sow.
[01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:45.878]  What comes around goes around.
[01:36:47.179 --> 01:36:48.820]  I don't agree with the Buddhists and the Hindus.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.662]  They make it more complex as reincarnation and they say karma.
[01:36:55.002 --> 01:36:57.322]  But you can boil karma down to what comes around, goes around.
[01:36:57.903 --> 01:37:01.764]  Everybody knows in their guts that what you do comes back on you.
[01:37:02.704 --> 01:37:04.625]  Everything I've done, I'm going to pay for.
[01:37:05.385 --> 01:37:06.325]  In this life and the next.
[01:37:06.646 --> 01:37:07.946]  Folks, you're going to pay for it.
[01:37:09.391 --> 01:37:11.252]  And we've just got to stop it.
[01:37:11.312 --> 01:37:12.853]  We've got to stop it now.
[01:37:13.533 --> 01:37:18.156]  And don't send me emails, oh, you just don't know it's a right and all this stuff, because I'll vomit all over it.
[01:37:18.256 --> 01:37:19.376]  I'm not even going to hear it.
[01:37:20.117 --> 01:37:26.600]  You know, if you in your heart know it's wrong, in your heart you're sad, in your heart you know this is horrible,
[01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:38.878]  It tears my heart out to think about all these babies that have been killed, they're dying right now, and all the people that were told by the society, it was okay, it's a ball of tissue, it's no big deal, who later in their lives feel so bad over it.
[01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:41.199]  I've read and heard their testimonies.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:54.547]  And, uh, thank God, thank Jesus, thank, thank all that's good in the universe, that, that the soul of humanity, despite all the propaganda and all of it, is turning against abortion.
[01:37:55.007 --> 01:37:56.848]  And abortion numbers are down in this country.
[01:37:57.503 --> 01:38:05.528]  Despite the fact that the churches won't speak out against it anymore, because it's politically incorrect, despite the fact that the media pushes it and says it's good, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:05.568 --> 01:38:07.189]  We're not buying your New World Order.
[01:38:07.489 --> 01:38:09.450]  We're not buying any of it you filth.
[01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:20.436]  And it is very encouraging that all of these forces of good are manifesting themselves and turning the tide.
[01:38:21.357 --> 01:38:23.518]  There are good things happening.
[01:38:24.439 --> 01:38:26.620]  And there are a lot of young women out there listening to me
[01:38:27.464 --> 01:38:38.029]  That there is no shame in, if you get pregnant when you're 17 with your boyfriend, there is no shame in getting married and having that child.
[01:38:38.069 --> 01:38:39.970]  They're telling you you're going to miss out on the rest of your life.
[01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:41.450]  No, you're going to live.
[01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:55.136]  All these 30 and 35 and 40 and 45-year-old women who've made millions of dollars to care less about any of it, they literally look like pincushions who go through hundreds of thousands of dollars of all sorts of surgeries and you name it to try to have children.
[01:38:57.649 --> 01:39:00.491]  I've talked to so many of them, they finally realize what it's all about.
[01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:07.015]  We are not breeding anymore, we are not living anymore, we are not doing what we're supposed to do anymore, and you're unhappy.
[01:39:07.456 --> 01:39:12.739]  No amount of Passats and fancy apartments and designer boots are going to give you what you want.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.963]  Going into some dirty abortuary and having them rip a baby out of you is HELL ON EARTH!
[01:39:19.464 --> 01:39:21.045]  And it imperils your soul!
[01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:25.657]  And if you don't even believe in the soul, it imperils who you are here.
[01:39:25.898 --> 01:39:27.198]  You're going to destroy yourself.
[01:39:27.238 --> 01:39:29.319]  Your brain is going to hate you.
[01:39:29.979 --> 01:39:32.620]  We're designed to self-destruct when we do bad, folks.
[01:39:33.081 --> 01:39:37.022]  Our encoding will go, I'm a bad person, and will start to kill you.
[01:39:37.062 --> 01:39:38.483]  Did you know that?
[01:39:38.503 --> 01:39:39.663]  That's God's system.
[01:39:40.324 --> 01:39:41.684]  You don't want this on you.
[01:39:41.824 --> 01:39:43.385]  In this life, you're going to pay for it.
[01:39:43.665 --> 01:39:45.506]  We're all going to pay for the things we've done.
[01:39:45.526 --> 01:39:48.127]  I know the callers are holding.
[01:39:49.275 --> 01:39:55.239]  The listeners are holding and everybody's sitting there while I'm ranting and raving about this.
[01:39:55.339 --> 01:40:00.382]  It's just I do want to thank God for turning the tide against this.
[01:40:01.002 --> 01:40:06.986]  That we are getting progress on this and I want to commend all those who have been fighting this.
[01:40:08.327 --> 01:40:11.469]  And it's a political football they use and they toss back and forth.
[01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:16.552]  And we need to stop abortion.
[01:40:18.203 --> 01:40:19.304]  We need to do it.
[01:40:20.365 --> 01:40:23.407]  Because I've seen the videos, I've researched, I've looked at it.
[01:40:24.047 --> 01:40:25.969]  You just heard this doctor from the UK.
[01:40:25.989 --> 01:40:29.351]  I mean, you go look at it, it's just, it's just, my God.
[01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:33.654]  I mean, you couldn't take a little baby Chihuahua and chop it up, could you?
[01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:35.616]  You'd call that person a Jeffrey Dahmer psychopath.
[01:40:35.856 --> 01:40:39.859]  Well, how do you do it to your own flesh and blood?
[01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:46.251]  The greatest gift God ever gave anybody.
[01:40:46.271 --> 01:40:51.933]  And again, if you don't even believe in God, but you've got children still, you know that you love them more than anything.
[01:40:51.973 --> 01:40:52.933]  Or at least you should.
[01:40:52.953 --> 01:40:54.774]  Or something's wrong with you.
[01:40:56.795 --> 01:40:58.155]  These are angels!
[01:41:00.076 --> 01:41:03.738]  I watch TV and movies and they always denigrate children how horrible it is to have them.
[01:41:03.998 --> 01:41:06.739]  And you talk to people that have them, it's the most wonderful thing there is.
[01:41:10.373 --> 01:41:11.895]  I'm going to keep Debbie on for just a few minutes.
[01:41:11.915 --> 01:41:13.436]  I know she's been holding and she's busy.
[01:41:13.937 --> 01:41:17.321]  Debbie, I'm sorry, I just had to say that after I had that last guest on.
[01:41:18.001 --> 01:41:21.225]  Oh, Alex, I was really interested in listening to what you had to say.
[01:41:22.065 --> 01:41:24.246]  So, I'm glad I was sitting on hold listening.
[01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:41.357]  Well, it's just how in the UK they sit there and don't give the babies medical aid for a while hoping they'll die and the nurses get so upset and basically demand that the pediatrician come in and then they save the baby or they try to kill a baby three times on the table and then the mother goes, oh no, don't kill it after they've already had to resuscitate it once.
[01:41:41.377 --> 01:41:42.417]  It makes me sick.
[01:41:42.878 --> 01:41:43.518]  Yeah, me too.
[01:41:43.538 --> 01:41:45.319]  I mean, how do these people do this?
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.480]  I don't know.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:51.783]  I can see why people wouldn't want to be nurses in these hospitals.
[01:41:52.335 --> 01:41:57.216]  You know, because I don't think there's enough money in the world to pay me to do something like that.
[01:41:57.236 --> 01:42:01.638]  I mean, I can hardly kill a bug, let alone anything.
[01:42:01.658 --> 01:42:05.639]  You know, my daughter, my middle daughter, was a 7-month preemie.
[01:42:07.619 --> 01:42:13.701]  And, you know, I understand that they actually will do abortions almost to 7 months now.
[01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:16.422]  It's terrible.
[01:42:16.782 --> 01:42:19.423]  Oh, they'll do them well past 7 months.
[01:42:19.443 --> 01:42:19.803]  Really?
[01:42:21.781 --> 01:42:27.934]  Well, the thing is, they just buy the propaganda of, oh no, that's nothing in there, don't worry about it.
[01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:30.659]  Plus, women aren't told the medical risk of abortion.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:31.441]  Right.
[01:42:33.163 --> 01:42:34.443]  I mean, it screws you up.
[01:42:34.804 --> 01:42:35.924]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.004 --> 01:42:39.705]  Let's tell folks, you know, the water is full of poison.
[01:42:39.745 --> 01:42:46.427]  The same government that promotes abortion puts every manner of stuff in there on purpose, and there's all the other stuff in there, all the runoff.
[01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:53.309]  Why would people feed their children and their families, you know, food cooked in this, or why would you give your child a glass of water?
[01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:56.650]  Alex, where'd you go?
[01:42:59.391 --> 01:42:59.831]  Hello?
[01:43:02.799 --> 01:43:03.059]  Debbie?
[01:43:03.279 --> 01:43:04.240]  Yeah, where'd you go?
[01:43:05.181 --> 01:43:07.343]  Oh, you know, we've got a bad connection.
[01:43:07.363 --> 01:43:09.224]  We've got one that works, but we use this one.
[01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:14.128]  And so it's been cut down a little bit lately.
[01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:23.175]  Just tell people about some of the New Millennium Made in America water filters and specials so they can get them and give them those gifts or get them in their own home.
[01:43:23.415 --> 01:43:32.542]  Well, the Berkey water filters are a gravity water filter that takes out the pathogenic bacteria
[01:43:33.243 --> 01:43:38.086]  The chemicals, huge chemicals are in your water every day.
[01:43:38.106 --> 01:43:48.213]  If you're drinking tap water, even, you know, well water, cistern water has different chemicals that they've gotten from the ground or from the air.
[01:43:48.293 --> 01:43:50.834]  Even rainwater has things in it.
[01:43:51.495 --> 01:43:58.459]  And so what we have is the Berkey gravity water filters that don't require any electricity.
[01:43:58.619 --> 01:44:02.462]  They work in any environment.
[01:44:03.223 --> 01:44:12.107]  So that you can have healthy drinking water and get rid of things like lead, bacteria, chlorine.
[01:44:12.127 --> 01:44:18.009]  You know, we're drinking chlorine every day if you're drinking your tap water.
[01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:20.670]  And yet, then you don't feel good.
[01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:22.071]  You wonder, why don't I feel good?
[01:44:22.091 --> 01:44:23.611]  Because you're poisoning yourself.
[01:44:23.651 --> 01:44:26.072]  Well, fish don't live in tap water.
[01:44:26.673 --> 01:44:26.893]  Right.
[01:44:27.253 --> 01:44:27.733]  That's right.
[01:44:27.813 --> 01:44:32.255]  Fish do not live in tap water, yet we drink it, introduce it into our system.
[01:44:33.107 --> 01:44:40.475]  It's like taking a bottle of chlorine bleach and pouring a few drops.
[01:44:40.495 --> 01:44:42.057]  It's like everything else.
[01:44:42.077 --> 01:44:43.378]  They just do it right in your face.
[01:44:44.671 --> 01:44:48.633]  And, uh, this is a product I really believe in.
[01:44:48.653 --> 01:44:51.475]  $1.99 for the murky light without the lights.
[01:44:51.695 --> 01:44:52.955]  And you get a free gift with that.
[01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:56.217]  Supports modeler, potassium iodide, or sheltering in place DVD video.
[01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.678]  Again, an indented Chinese knockoff is usually about $2.75, $3.10.
[01:44:59.058 --> 01:45:01.500]  I've seen them in stores.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.981]  Just pieces of junk compared to these made in America systems.
[01:45:05.822 --> 01:45:11.845]  And, uh... And we really do, um, think you cut out again, Alex.
[01:45:12.879 --> 01:45:13.619]  I'm sorry Debbie.
[01:45:13.639 --> 01:45:15.400]  Can you hear me when it cuts out like that?
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.360]  No, I can't.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.320]  Are you hearing a cut out?
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.501]  Yeah, suddenly you just go away.
[01:45:19.821 --> 01:45:20.281]  Yeah.
[01:45:21.201 --> 01:45:23.242]  That's the way we do things now.
[01:45:23.982 --> 01:45:30.583]  But continuing though, give folks the phone number so they can get some of these fine filters.
[01:45:30.884 --> 01:45:32.044]  They can call in to 1-888-803-4438.
[01:45:32.124 --> 01:45:32.344]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:45:40.973 --> 01:45:44.756]  Be sure to let me know that you're an Alex Jones listener and we'll go over the specials.
[01:45:45.476 --> 01:45:49.219]  And we want to get the presents for people out before Christmas.
[01:45:49.279 --> 01:45:54.723]  I know there's a lot of people out there who are contemplating what they want to get people for Christmas.
[01:45:54.743 --> 01:45:57.485]  So give us a call and we'll go over those specials.
[01:45:58.286 --> 01:46:02.369]  And if you get the recording, please leave your name and your number.
[01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:05.031]  Leave your number two times so we can get back with you.
[01:46:05.872 --> 01:46:08.574]  And there's a bunch of other specials you're running right now as well.
[01:46:09.224 --> 01:46:17.910]  Yes, we've got the Berkey Sport Bottles, $5 for $99 for the generic labeled, or $5 for $155 for the regular labeled.
[01:46:19.311 --> 01:46:21.512]  We have Potassium Iodide.
[01:46:21.892 --> 01:46:25.194]  KDF Shower Filters make great stocking stuffers.
[01:46:25.555 --> 01:46:27.416]  They're on sale for $35.
[01:46:28.637 --> 01:46:32.579]  So, there's that line ringing in.
[01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:34.260]  Good hearing from you and God bless.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.881]  Thank you, God bless you too.
[01:46:35.921 --> 01:46:37.082]  You better take care.
[01:46:37.282 --> 01:46:38.563]  Seriously, give her a call.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:51.649]  And Made in America folks, high quality systems and Debbie works for New Millennium just handling the radio calls from this show and a handful of other programs.
[01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:57.400]  And she does a great job, and she's been with us as a sponsor with Jim Shepard, I don't know, for five years or so.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.482]  The toll free number is 1-888-803-4438.
[01:47:00.642 --> 01:47:05.146]  It's time to stop drinking the stuff that's in the water, folks.
[01:47:05.506 --> 01:47:06.627]  Again, it's real simple.
[01:47:06.747 --> 01:47:07.728]  Fish don't live in it.
[01:47:08.128 --> 01:47:08.769]  But we drink it.
[01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:09.449]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:10.770]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls here.
[01:47:10.810 --> 01:47:11.331]  Let's talk to Chris.
[01:47:18.949 --> 01:47:21.431]  In Arkansas, Chris, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:47:21.471 --> 01:47:21.832]  Go ahead.
[01:47:22.412 --> 01:47:22.812]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:23.113 --> 01:47:23.433]  Hi.
[01:47:23.553 --> 01:47:32.941]  I just wanted to say, I love it when people say, you know, if a woman gets raped, well, you should have an abortion.
[01:47:33.721 --> 01:47:36.824]  No, what happens is you don't kill the baby, you kill the rape.
[01:47:37.764 --> 01:47:38.865]  That's the way it should work.
[01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:40.387]  That's justice.
[01:47:43.052 --> 01:47:48.694]  Twisted stick thinking to say that, well, if a woman gets raped, you know, let's abort the baby.
[01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:51.716]  No, let's abort the person that raped the woman.
[01:47:51.756 --> 01:47:53.997]  Let's do that, because that is the just thing to do.
[01:47:54.017 --> 01:47:57.879]  Well, the very same crowd that wants to kill the baby doesn't want to kill the killer.
[01:47:58.459 --> 01:47:59.699]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:00.640]  Because they love death.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:07.963]  And the second thing that I wanted to say, Alex, is that abortion, it's unconstitutional, okay?
[01:48:08.183 --> 01:48:10.164]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.661]  No, they're violating somebody's right.
[01:48:12.961 --> 01:48:15.643]  Babies have a different blood type, they're in their own little area.
[01:48:16.584 --> 01:48:25.869]  You have decided to engage in something that causes this, and that's a red herring, the whole rape thing, that's one out of a million cases on average.
[01:48:26.169 --> 01:48:28.991]  They just try to bring that in to confuse the whole issue.
[01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:32.714]  You know, you can then say, okay, you can in the case of rape.
[01:48:32.734 --> 01:48:34.616]  They'll go, no, no, no, we don't want to do that.
[01:48:35.777 --> 01:48:39.120]  Again, it's because they're committed to it, they can't admit they're wrong.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.662]  And a lot of them are just Satanists.
[01:48:40.762 --> 01:48:48.529]  It's come out in the news that a lot of these abortionists, this came out just a few months ago, are eating the babies, are throwing them around, are making fun of them.
[01:48:49.190 --> 01:48:51.692]  Because you have to be evil to be able to do this and keep doing it.
[01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.192]  Well, you're right, Alex.
[01:48:53.292 --> 01:48:54.273]  It's a smoke screen.
[01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:55.913]  It's probably way less than 1%.
[01:48:56.193 --> 01:49:02.796]  Well, did you hear about the case of the doctor who had the dead bodies everywhere and was eating the babies?
[01:49:02.816 --> 01:49:03.696]  That was just a few months ago.
[01:49:03.716 --> 01:49:12.479]  The way our culture's gone, no, Alex, I haven't heard of it, but I wouldn't doubt it, just the way that our culture's gone, because it's a culture of death.
[01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.700]  I wanted to say one other thing.
[01:49:15.509 --> 01:49:24.393]  Yeah, I know it's not physically possible, but I wish that I could just, you know, I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I'm a single, handsome, attractive young man.
[01:49:24.533 --> 01:49:29.655]  And what I'm getting at is that, you know, a lot of people think it's like sexy to have an abortion.
[01:49:29.835 --> 01:49:35.678]  And I'm telling you, as a woman, you know, I look at a woman that had an abortion and is unrepentant.
[01:49:36.038 --> 01:49:38.179]  That is the most unattractive thing in the world.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.300]  That's all I want to say.
[01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:41.408]  It is.
[01:49:41.528 --> 01:49:43.029]  It's a killer.
[01:49:43.329 --> 01:49:45.191]  It's very, very unattractive.
[01:49:45.431 --> 01:49:49.313]  I don't want to marry... I don't want to be with Charlie Manson.
[01:49:49.853 --> 01:49:51.454]  He performed an abortion.
[01:49:54.511 --> 01:49:57.353]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.614 --> 01:49:59.195]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.535 --> 01:50:04.219]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.559 --> 01:50:11.305]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.625 --> 01:50:13.587]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:16.649]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:21.394]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.594 --> 01:50:26.018]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.258 --> 01:50:33.464]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds with their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.724 --> 01:50:36.146]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.326 --> 01:50:38.048]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:53.502 --> 01:51:01.012]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.292 --> 01:51:12.226]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.366 --> 01:51:12.786]  We're good to go!
[01:51:28.954 --> 01:51:29.454]  That's right!
[01:51:29.634 --> 01:51:36.737]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.037 --> 01:51:41.159]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:51:41.319 --> 01:51:45.401]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.461 --> 01:51:46.001]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.247 --> 01:51:55.547]  I think so.
[01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:11.249]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.114 --> 01:52:43.216]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.376 --> 01:52:49.440]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:53.142 --> 01:53:03.128]  Alright, I've hooked up on the alternate backup system.
[01:53:12.233 --> 01:53:16.895]  The funny thing is, you know, I don't get off into conspiracy theories and say, this group's cutting us off, that group's doing it.
[01:53:18.055 --> 01:53:35.943]  I've been told that a local government-front mercenary company based in Austin, one of their main hubs, we have a lot of listeners here, somebody that works there, and this is high-level government, through another government source of mine, that they were going to start knocking my show off, messing with it, playing games with it, just to show me who the boss is.
[01:53:36.363 --> 01:53:38.844]  I hadn't talked about it in a week or two, and I'd learned of it.
[01:53:39.884 --> 01:53:41.225]  Then I had Colonel Craig Roberts on,
[01:53:42.156 --> 01:53:46.602]  And I started talking about it with him and, uh, let's just say in a roundabout way, he was connected to it.
[01:53:46.943 --> 01:53:50.588]  And right when I said it, they told me they're going to cut me off, take me down.
[01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:52.351]  Then it happened.
[01:53:53.155 --> 01:53:54.537]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:53:54.577 --> 01:53:55.898]  And I've talked to Coast to Coast AM.
[01:53:55.918 --> 01:54:09.891]  They say whenever they've got some government official coming on and they're covering some serious issue that's not a, quote, fun issue, you know, as they call some of the other stuff they do, that satellites cut out that never do, lines all go dead.
[01:54:09.911 --> 01:54:12.193]  And I mean, I've actually talked to their producers.
[01:54:12.253 --> 01:54:14.235]  I've actually talked to people running it.
[01:54:14.295 --> 01:54:17.078]  I mean, it isn't even like it's some big thing they talk about on the radio.
[01:54:18.138 --> 01:54:24.282]  And you've got to know that all the major telecommunications systems in the mid-nineties had the digital hubs put in by the government.
[01:54:24.302 --> 01:54:37.512]  The government paid around nine million dollars to have all the satellites and telecommunications connections and hubs, that is the links with the satellites in space, having all of their wiring put in where they have a kill switch on all of it.
[01:54:38.592 --> 01:54:46.418]  And it's pretty obnoxious and there's no way in Sam Hill that
[01:54:47.162 --> 01:55:03.169]  That I could be on air, and that... I mean, we've even had Voice of America before jam us on shortwave, and when I moved, they actually moved their broadcast to right one click away from us and splattered over on us, because it upsets them!
[01:55:04.009 --> 01:55:05.169]  And because we're winning!
[01:55:05.230 --> 01:55:06.070]  We're hurting you!
[01:55:07.050 --> 01:55:08.571]  The people are waking up to abortion?
[01:55:09.542 --> 01:55:10.723]  They're waking up to open borders.
[01:55:10.743 --> 01:55:12.063]  They're waking up to gun control.
[01:55:12.343 --> 01:55:13.644]  We're deprogramming people.
[01:55:14.004 --> 01:55:15.825]  Bush's approval rating is at 28%.
[01:55:16.205 --> 01:55:18.506]  We're destroying the left-right paradigm.
[01:55:19.627 --> 01:55:21.848]  Our websites get more hits than your major newspapers.
[01:55:21.888 --> 01:55:25.490]  That is the whole, you know, conglomerate of alternative news out there.
[01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:32.573]  We're now bigger than you are in many respects, though we're fragmented, which is even a good thing because it makes us very redundant.
[01:55:33.214 --> 01:55:35.515]  And so you must feel bad about yourself.
[01:55:36.235 --> 01:55:37.596]  I mean, you're aborting America.
[01:55:39.571 --> 01:55:41.993]  Your conscience knows what you're doing, and you don't want to feel bad about it.
[01:55:42.453 --> 01:55:50.699]  We're going to start the next hour, and I'm going to go to Frank and Radkin before this next little five-minute segment ends, and we'll go to both of you.
[01:55:51.239 --> 01:55:52.840]  Give you both about two minutes a piece.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:53.881]  I appreciate you holding them.
[01:55:54.442 --> 01:55:56.903]  We've got another guest coming on that my producer set up.
[01:55:56.943 --> 01:56:01.086]  It's this Marine, and just to talk about kind of the culture of the Marines.
[01:56:02.407 --> 01:56:07.311]  The Royal Marines, because we've all seen the pictures of them, naked, bashing each other in the face, bare knuckles.
[01:56:09.475 --> 01:56:10.876]  Rolling around on each other naked.
[01:56:10.917 --> 01:56:12.138]  It's all pretty homoerotic.
[01:56:12.158 --> 01:56:13.319]  There's a lot of that in the military.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.382]  And it's just sick.
[01:56:17.122 --> 01:56:18.463]  People get killed doing this.
[01:56:19.084 --> 01:56:20.505]  The troops didn't do this in the past.
[01:56:20.545 --> 01:56:24.289]  This is getting more and more popular and more and more out of control.
[01:56:24.869 --> 01:56:26.911]  And it's not good for the military and it needs to stop.
[01:56:28.373 --> 01:56:32.937]  But we'll get a view from this officer coming up for about 15-20 minutes.
[01:56:32.977 --> 01:56:34.078]  I'm not going to have him on long.

[01:58:05.859 --> 01:58:11.442]  Alright, we're back live.
[01:58:11.462 --> 01:58:19.868]  We got this Marine coming on who just thinks all the stuff going on over there with the British Royal Marines is just funny and it's all big laughs.
[01:58:21.789 --> 01:58:22.890]  That's coming up.
[01:58:24.331 --> 01:58:25.492]  C'est la vie as they say.
[01:58:25.512 --> 01:58:26.012]  We'll finish the
[01:58:26.787 --> 01:58:28.990]  How are you doing there, Alex?
[01:58:42.543 --> 01:58:43.023]  Good.
[01:58:43.263 --> 01:58:47.786]  Yeah, I really got into that spider routine you were doing a while back.
[01:58:47.846 --> 01:58:51.568]  I thought you should have that spider make more appearances on the program.
[01:58:51.648 --> 01:58:54.309]  Okay, hey, hey, go stalk somebody else, buddy.
[01:58:54.349 --> 01:58:55.290]  I recognize your voice.
[01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:56.290]  Stop posing as me.
[01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:57.271]  That's actually criminal.
[01:58:57.971 --> 01:58:58.912]  Thanks for the call, punk.
[01:58:59.632 --> 01:59:02.734]  Let's go ahead and talk to Reardon in Hawaii.
[01:59:02.774 --> 01:59:03.734]  Reardon, you're on the air.
[01:59:04.054 --> 01:59:04.414]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:04.454 --> 01:59:05.455]  Can you hear me on this connection?
[01:59:05.835 --> 01:59:06.375]  Yes, I can.
[01:59:06.435 --> 01:59:06.736]  Welcome.
[01:59:07.096 --> 01:59:07.336]  Thanks.
[01:59:08.176 --> 01:59:09.197]  I have an ethical dilemma.
[01:59:09.827 --> 01:59:12.450]  I'm pretty much sure of how I want to handle it, but I wanted to ask your opinion.
[01:59:13.151 --> 01:59:19.036]  When I started learning about abortion, I found out that most abortions were done after 8 and sometimes after 12 weeks.
[01:59:19.777 --> 01:59:24.462]  And the reason that was is because the fetuses are larger and easier to yank out piece by piece than when they're small.
[01:59:24.861 --> 01:59:25.702]  That's absolutely true.
[01:59:25.722 --> 01:59:33.487]  I've talked to women who want to go in and have an abortion, who wanted to and went in, and they said, sorry, we'd really like to wait until it's 12 weeks.
[01:59:33.527 --> 01:59:36.510]  And then they'd schedule you at 12 and like to do it at 14 to 16.
[01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:39.692]  Yeah, and here's the situation.
[01:59:40.132 --> 01:59:43.555]  I looked up and started researching at what point I felt life began.
[01:59:44.215 --> 01:59:46.237]  And as far as I could tell, six to eight weeks.
[01:59:46.877 --> 01:59:47.938]  Really, it's alive.
[01:59:47.998 --> 01:59:52.141]  I mean, you could say even earlier from a spiritual standpoint, but from a physical standpoint,
[01:59:52.645 --> 01:59:55.287]  It's got brain waves, it can respond, it can feel pain in eight weeks.
[01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.028]  I would even push it down to six.
[01:59:57.609 --> 01:59:59.130]  And so here's my dilemma, okay?
[01:59:59.691 --> 02:00:08.758]  As a scientist, I came up with a technology, I'm not going to discuss it because I don't want to give people ideas on how to do it, on how to cause a painless abortion before six weeks.
[02:00:09.238 --> 02:00:11.280]  I thought to myself, it's sort of like inventing a guillotine.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:20.607]  If there are going to be abortions done, can I do it in a way that is instant for the child and can be done at an earlier point for the fetus and would be painless?
[02:00:20.927 --> 02:00:21.868]  So here's my dilemma.
[02:00:22.777 --> 02:00:26.218]  As a scientist, because it's scientists that have been bringing out all these horrors.
[02:00:26.858 --> 02:00:28.319]  RFID chips, all the weapons.
[02:00:28.659 --> 02:00:33.141]  There's an absence of ethical questioning in the scientific community that needs to be addressed.
[02:00:33.681 --> 02:00:35.642]  What is your thought on the matter?
[02:00:36.242 --> 02:00:43.744]  If I work in moving this forward, and getting investing in it, it will surely cause more abortions.
[02:00:44.205 --> 02:00:45.665]  Because it'll be so much easier to do.
[02:00:45.685 --> 02:00:50.767]  Of course it has new world order applications that they're going to do mass sterilization, or mass abortions in China with it.
[02:00:51.383 --> 02:00:55.167]  But it would also cause the abortions that are going to happen to be less painful.
[02:00:55.287 --> 02:01:02.935]  It would be done at a much earlier point where hopefully the fetus could be argued that it's incapable of pain.
[02:01:02.975 --> 02:01:03.696]  What are your thoughts, Alex?
[02:01:06.231 --> 02:01:07.993]  You know, I've got to ponder that.
[02:01:08.513 --> 02:01:10.895]  You know, you have this whole lesser of two evils argument.
[02:01:10.936 --> 02:01:19.683]  I think obviously this Dr. Stuart Campbell is against abortion, and he's using his arguments to reduce, to save millions of lives.
[02:01:20.704 --> 02:01:25.829]  And so that argument, that incremental argument, will be effective than just the frontal banning
[02:01:26.749 --> 02:01:40.293]  But I think it really should be banned, but I don't think it would be bad, you know, if they're going to be having these abortions, to have a way to do it when they are just a clump of cells, but still the entire human being right there, folks, with the soul.
[02:01:41.493 --> 02:01:45.115]  And to, you know, do it in a more painless way.
[02:01:45.155 --> 02:01:49.856]  I mean, I'm against abortion, but if they said, should we burn them with salts?
[02:01:50.516 --> 02:01:53.397]  And will they die over an hour and a half, or should we kill the baby instantly?
[02:01:53.417 --> 02:01:55.758]  I'd say, well, if you're going to kill them, kill them instantly.
[02:01:56.198 --> 02:02:07.083]  So I think right there, but again, perhaps we should argue that later in the show after this guest is on, because it's a very serious ethical question.
[02:02:07.223 --> 02:02:12.465]  I'd have to ponder that, I would think, for a long time to really, I mean, that is a tough question.
[02:02:13.165 --> 02:02:14.706]  You know, it's like inventing the guillotine.
[02:02:15.026 --> 02:02:19.288]  Certainly it caused the death of the incident of Payless, but look how many people died in France because of it.
[02:02:19.932 --> 02:02:24.096]  I mean, the nuclear bomb in the Manhattan Project ended the war, theoretically.
[02:02:24.436 --> 02:02:26.599]  But, should the scientists have done that at all?
[02:02:28.861 --> 02:02:29.381]  I just don't know.
[02:02:29.641 --> 02:02:30.863]  Yeah, interesting point.
[02:02:30.903 --> 02:02:33.385]  Why don't you, you ought to write an article about that, and I'd post it.
[02:02:33.425 --> 02:02:33.986]  Ask the question.
[02:02:34.006 --> 02:02:35.327]  We can get people's posts on it.
[02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:36.468]  It's important.
[02:02:36.488 --> 02:02:37.369]  It's an important debate.
[02:02:37.849 --> 02:02:39.751]  You've called before, and you're always welcome to call again.
[02:02:39.771 --> 02:02:41.053]  I appreciate your fine points, sir.
[02:02:45.177 --> 02:02:51.999]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.319 --> 02:02:53.679]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:56.100]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:58.340]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.621 --> 02:03:03.542]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:03.882 --> 02:03:07.923]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[02:03:10.024 --> 02:03:20.672]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.832 --> 02:03:22.713]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:04:48.035 --> 02:04:49.336]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:49.776 --> 02:04:52.498]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:52.938 --> 02:04:55.580]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:05:02.484]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:46.423 --> 02:05:52.450]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.071 --> 02:05:56.054]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.588 --> 02:06:02.591]  Jan and Joe and many others, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:04.332]  There's a ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:06:04.352 --> 02:06:06.914]  I want to also get back into this latest news.
[02:06:06.954 --> 02:06:09.136]  Cameras in the bathrooms at public schools.
[02:06:10.217 --> 02:06:15.801]  If you don't like it and you try to take them down, well they just suspend you from school and they're going to keep the cameras in there.
[02:06:15.821 --> 02:06:18.683]  I want to go back into that more and take your calls on that subject.
[02:06:18.703 --> 02:06:19.924]  But don't forget to join us at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:19.944 --> 02:06:20.385]  We saw the images
[02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:44.868]  Starting Monday it was in several of the big British newspapers of naked British Royal Marines running around bashing each other in the head with these large boxing gloves on and they take those off and then one of the officers runs over and punches a guy and then kicks him in the head and knocks him out cold.
[02:06:46.756 --> 02:06:48.858]  And basically all of this is just going on.
[02:06:48.879 --> 02:06:53.283]  I know they've always had rites of passage and stuff like that, but I mean it just gets more and more extreme.
[02:06:53.563 --> 02:06:57.648]  But our guest says it's not as extreme as it was back in the 1980s.
[02:06:58.989 --> 02:07:01.532]  And of course a lot of the same stuff goes on here.
[02:07:02.635 --> 02:07:04.635]  And I personally think it's like mind control.
[02:07:04.675 --> 02:07:06.576]  I mean, it follows the same parameters as that.
[02:07:07.396 --> 02:07:10.877]  Author of Amongst the Marines, The Untold Story, and Always a Marine.
[02:07:11.297 --> 02:07:12.037]  Written in two books.
[02:07:12.097 --> 02:07:13.557]  They're available on Amazon.com.
[02:07:14.117 --> 02:07:19.959]  Amongst the Marines is Stephen Preece's first-hand account of life as an elite Royal Marine Commando.
[02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:31.541]  Delivers a direct and unflinching depiction of the excesses and often shocking lifestyle of the Marines and explains the impact this had on his own personality and behavior.
[02:07:32.922 --> 02:07:41.924]  And his fulfilled childhood ambition of earning the coveted Green Beret from the Commando Training Center at Lempstone when he was 18.
[02:07:43.424 --> 02:07:52.606]  He was unaware at that time of the brutal rite of passage that awaited him and all the other pieces of skin and recruits at his first Marine Commando Unit.
[02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:57.387]  And I don't know what it is to make you fight your friends.
[02:07:57.807 --> 02:08:00.028]  I had no problem fighting somebody I didn't like.
[02:08:00.048 --> 02:08:01.788]  Somebody was trying to attack me, but watching that video
[02:08:03.203 --> 02:08:10.368]  I mean, I can see putting on the pads and fighting in combat training, but trying to bash each other in the face, I don't know.
[02:08:11.409 --> 02:08:15.672]  It seems to me sick, but I'm sure I don't know about the culture.
[02:08:16.472 --> 02:08:18.313]  And of course, the Marines here do similar things.
[02:08:19.014 --> 02:08:24.457]  But joining us is Stephen Priest.
[02:08:25.058 --> 02:08:26.198]  Stephen, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:08:27.925 --> 02:08:32.088]  Tell us about, in a nutshell, how you got in, what rank you went to.
[02:08:32.108 --> 02:08:35.030]  You ended up getting court-martialed, but were found not guilty.
[02:08:36.411 --> 02:08:45.717]  I mean, go through that for us, and then tell us about those brutal rites of passages, which earlier I was talking to you, you were saying that things are less extreme now.
[02:08:46.537 --> 02:08:47.198]  Yes, they are.
[02:08:47.218 --> 02:08:47.798]  They are now.
[02:08:47.838 --> 02:08:56.284]  I will tell you about back in the 80s, the video I'll come on to after that, because I think the videos have been blown out in proportion.
[02:08:57.199 --> 02:09:00.820]  But back in the 80s, just after the Falklands War, was when I joined up.
[02:09:02.221 --> 02:09:05.222]  And the culture at the time was quite violent.
[02:09:05.882 --> 02:09:08.683]  There was a lot of bullies at that time.
[02:09:09.943 --> 02:09:15.105]  And it was very difficult, sort of, joining your first commando unit and actually becoming one of the guys.
[02:09:17.105 --> 02:09:26.128]  For quite some time, you had to learn to toe the line and stay quiet until you got to know everybody.
[02:09:27.763 --> 02:09:31.025]  Until eventually you'll be accepted as one of the other guys.
[02:09:32.406 --> 02:09:39.169]  And basically after that, it's sort of, you watch each other's backs on active service, so you need to trust each other.
[02:09:40.150 --> 02:09:42.711]  So it's quite important that bullying doesn't happen anymore.
[02:09:43.512 --> 02:09:51.996]  Quite frankly, after the early years of the Falklands War, the aftermath, which lasted about two or three years, they started to stamp bullying out.
[02:09:53.391 --> 02:09:57.213]  Um, and didn't tolerate bullying anymore, which more so in the 90s.
[02:09:57.874 --> 02:10:13.583]  But at that time, I think after, um, I'd had the inception, the violent inception at the beginning, I think my path was set in that, um, I just didn't tolerate anybody who offered to be violent after that and practically took on all oncomers.
[02:10:14.887 --> 02:10:15.948]  In all kinds of situations.
[02:10:15.968 --> 02:10:19.870]  Well, I mean, describe the bullying, and then, of course, you kind of embraced it in a way, sort of beating them up.
[02:10:20.150 --> 02:10:21.972]  But, I mean, break it down for us.
[02:10:22.032 --> 02:10:26.314]  I mean, you're saying a lot more extreme than someone being savagely kicked in the head and knocked out.
[02:10:26.775 --> 02:10:32.658]  Yeah, well, back in the 80s, I was dragged out of bed and kicked around on the floor and beaten with a stick.
[02:10:33.239 --> 02:10:34.459]  But people die like that.
[02:10:34.479 --> 02:10:38.182]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but personally, I've hit somebody four or five times and they almost die.
[02:10:38.202 --> 02:10:41.484]  I mean, how do you sit there and just bash people in the head and they don't die?
[02:10:42.347 --> 02:10:45.128]  I think it's a case of how you do it.
[02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:47.470]  You're professional enough to be sure.
[02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:49.251]  Actually, some Royal Marines have died, though.
[02:10:49.271 --> 02:10:49.931]  That's been in the news.
[02:10:50.511 --> 02:10:51.372]  Yeah, that's true, yeah.
[02:10:51.392 --> 02:10:57.935]  But that's been because of the dangers and depths of their physical basic training.
[02:10:59.856 --> 02:11:02.697]  Quite often, as opposed to violent amongst the ranks.
[02:11:03.097 --> 02:11:04.918]  Okay, but I'll shut up.
[02:11:04.958 --> 02:11:06.359]  Tell us specifically what they do.
[02:11:06.399 --> 02:11:07.920]  So they drag you out of bed, beat you with a stick.
[02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:11.890]  Yeah, quite frankly, it was just a lesson.
[02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:21.273]  Somebody had told this guy who just came back from the Falklands War that I'd been mouthing off, which was the wrong message, but it wasn't the message that he was told.
[02:11:22.113 --> 02:11:23.274]  And he punished me in that way.
[02:11:23.834 --> 02:11:27.615]  And I just kept my mouth shut and got on with it.
[02:11:29.476 --> 02:11:33.057]  So basically it's like corporal punishment just for anything being beaten savagely?
[02:11:34.097 --> 02:11:36.178]  It was at that time, back in the 80s.
[02:11:38.157 --> 02:11:42.140]  But after that, Amongst the Marines is quite a story.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:49.185]  It's a story that covers the seven years and I focus directly on the private life I experienced.
[02:11:49.345 --> 02:11:58.511]  It wasn't just during my service with the Marines, it was home leave and situations I got myself into and a lot of the trouble I caused.
[02:11:59.352 --> 02:12:03.515]  Fights with the locals and pubs when I'd come back from tours abroad.
[02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:08.371]  And the antics that the Marines used to get up to when they drank excessively.
[02:12:09.812 --> 02:12:11.713]  Exactly, in fact you couldn't turn it off.
[02:12:11.933 --> 02:12:13.594]  What happened once you got court-martialed though?
[02:12:13.614 --> 02:12:16.295]  They found you not guilty.
[02:12:16.315 --> 02:12:26.220]  Yeah, by the late 80's they brought out a new policy where they would not tolerate levels of violence amongst the ranks.
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:28.481]  And certainly not bullying.
[02:12:29.421 --> 02:12:32.002]  And eventually it caught up with me and I was court-martialed in 1989.
[02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:37.610]  Was this because you were beating a recruiter or fighting with another Marine?
[02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:38.970]  Fighting with another Marine.
[02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:42.692]  So you guys just routinely would start savaging each other?
[02:12:42.712 --> 02:12:44.312]  More or less, yes.
[02:12:45.072 --> 02:12:46.673]  Tommy, can you describe how this would start?
[02:12:46.693 --> 02:12:47.253]  What would happen?
[02:12:47.393 --> 02:12:57.196]  Yeah, well basically this guy just hit me on the back of the head as we were walking down the street together because I was quite a handful and renowned for it at that time.
[02:12:57.216 --> 02:13:01.777]  He hit me on the back of the head so I turned around and a fight ensued.
[02:13:02.785 --> 02:13:03.185]  I don't think so.
[02:13:27.395 --> 02:13:28.395]  King of the Hill, yeah.
[02:13:28.836 --> 02:13:34.978]  Yeah, I think, well, I think there was other guys who were quite tough, too, but I was just a handful.
[02:13:35.338 --> 02:13:37.218]  However, I don't really blame the Marines for that.
[02:13:37.258 --> 02:13:39.299]  I think maybe me childhood I'd have lucked with it, too.
[02:13:39.979 --> 02:13:40.660]  I understand.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.540]  Certain people go really wild in that culture.
[02:13:43.481 --> 02:13:46.322]  But you were found not guilty.
[02:13:46.342 --> 02:13:47.702]  What happened in the tribunal?
[02:13:48.322 --> 02:13:52.744]  Okay, I lasted for two days, but I actually
[02:13:54.375 --> 02:13:54.875]  I don't know.
[02:14:13.354 --> 02:14:20.036]  And although it might sound bad because I hung this guy over the wall, he was actually the person who caused the issue by.
[02:14:20.176 --> 02:14:21.176]  Oh yeah, he hit you first.
[02:14:21.236 --> 02:14:22.156]  I fully understand that.
[02:14:22.536 --> 02:14:23.336]  Yeah.
[02:14:23.416 --> 02:14:25.617]  It was just the extreme image that he had to do something.
[02:14:25.957 --> 02:14:30.438]  So give us, and of course you cover this all in these two books, which are available on Amazon.com.
[02:14:30.758 --> 02:14:39.480]  Tell us, sir, about, I mean, you don't think it's any big deal, you were saying, what we saw with these images of the guy getting kicked in the face and everybody running around naked?
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:48.925]  No, I think the problem we have here is that the Marines of today are very different from the 80s in that they have more control of their aggression.
[02:14:49.585 --> 02:14:59.130]  Now I know we saw the guy who, I mean really these guys are just guys who have come back from Iraq and were letting off steam and drinking lots of beer, having some fun together.
[02:14:59.150 --> 02:15:01.171]  A bit of harmless fun really.
[02:15:01.191 --> 02:15:03.853]  Getting naked is having fun?
[02:15:04.816 --> 02:15:06.257]  Running around naked drinking beer?
[02:15:06.597 --> 02:15:09.598]  Yes, because no one gets hurt and it's just good fun.
[02:15:10.599 --> 02:15:12.220]  It's obviously a rough game.
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:15.541]  If it had been a rugby football team then it wouldn't have even made the press.
[02:15:15.962 --> 02:15:18.523]  Now I understand, but why are they naked?
[02:15:18.603 --> 02:15:20.284]  I'm trying to understand.
[02:15:20.584 --> 02:15:23.765]  I don't know, maybe it's just become, they don't think they do.
[02:15:24.045 --> 02:15:25.886]  Maybe it's like Roman wrestling or something?
[02:15:26.467 --> 02:15:27.787]  Yeah, sort of.
[02:15:27.827 --> 02:15:29.768]  It's sort of like boxing, but we're all matched up.
[02:15:29.788 --> 02:15:33.090]  They didn't do that in the 80s, but it's obviously something they do now.
[02:15:33.809 --> 02:15:35.330]  It's just their way of letting off steam.
[02:15:35.651 --> 02:15:37.932]  Well, why does the officer kick him in the head then?
[02:15:38.573 --> 02:15:43.557]  The guy who kicked him in the head was actually a corporal, a non-commissioned officer.
[02:15:44.337 --> 02:15:51.163]  And I have no doubt that he will be disciplined because the Royal Marines will not tolerate violence amongst the ranks.
[02:15:53.005 --> 02:15:58.130]  I mean, it's one thing to have them having a boxing match on their knees, but the other guy didn't look like he did anything.
[02:15:58.170 --> 02:15:59.991]  Why run up and just savagely kick him in the head?
[02:16:00.192 --> 02:16:01.293]  You can kill somebody like that.
[02:16:01.693 --> 02:16:04.675]  Well, the guy actually said something to him, but nobody knows what he said.
[02:16:05.136 --> 02:16:10.380]  In that moment of time, he must have just flashed saw red and lashed out without thinking.
[02:16:11.902 --> 02:16:13.163]  Yeah, it was just one of those things.
[02:16:14.084 --> 02:16:17.647]  Quite honestly, I have no doubt that he would be severely disciplined for that.
[02:16:19.494 --> 02:16:21.895]  Now, I've been kicked in the head like that, it doesn't feel good.
[02:16:22.255 --> 02:16:28.838]  No, the guy who assaulted the guy on his knees would probably be court-martialed, I would guess.
[02:16:30.238 --> 02:16:32.659]  Alright, well, tell us about the two books again, sir.
[02:16:33.159 --> 02:16:48.625]  Okay, my first book's an expose of my life amongst the Marines, and basically the type of guy I was, and what I did, and a lot of the funny antics I got up to, and a lot of violence that went on in my life.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:57.385]  And the culture of the type of people I started with, but by the late 80s, I was one of the few at that time.
[02:16:58.025 --> 02:17:04.750]  The second book, Always a Marine, is quite a different story really, and it will appeal to a lot of people across the world, I would imagine.
[02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:10.393]  Because it's a story of a soldier who leaves the armed forces, but is still mentally a soldier.
[02:17:11.194 --> 02:17:14.136]  And who thinks and reacts as a soldier in given situations.
[02:17:15.316 --> 02:17:17.618]  And that can be a lot of things, but quite frankly,
[02:17:18.291 --> 02:17:25.176]  Because I was a man of few words, I found it hard to get work, because every time somebody upset me, I used to beat the hell out of them.
[02:17:25.736 --> 02:17:26.236]  Alright.
[02:17:26.737 --> 02:17:28.258]  Alright, well thank you for joining us.
[02:17:28.338 --> 02:17:29.939]  I appreciate you spending the time, sir.
[02:17:30.299 --> 02:17:31.500]  Okay, can I just tell you one last thing?
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:33.561]  It's what actually started my fight.
[02:17:33.581 --> 02:17:38.325]  Of course, the fire that burned inside me in the end was the ninjas.
[02:17:39.405 --> 02:17:40.126]  Oh, stay there.
[02:17:40.206 --> 02:17:40.586]  Stay there.
[02:17:41.007 --> 02:17:41.547]  We've got a break.
[02:17:41.567 --> 02:17:43.228]  We'll come back and finish up with you.
[02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:47.071]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:17:48.078 --> 02:17:49.459]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:18:00.891]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:18:01.451 --> 02:18:03.994]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:18:04.894 --> 02:18:09.439]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:18:10.051 --> 02:18:14.754]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:18:15.294 --> 02:18:33.925]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:18:34.485 --> 02:18:39.268]  That's www.LibertyDollar.org or call toll-free
[02:18:39.933 --> 02:18:41.814]  888-421-6181.
[02:18:41.834 --> 02:18:53.480]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:19:04.966]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:19:05.186 --> 02:19:07.807]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:08.167 --> 02:19:14.633]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:19:14.773 --> 02:19:16.654]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:19:16.855 --> 02:19:22.880]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:28.785]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:19:29.125 --> 02:19:33.048]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:44.867 --> 02:19:49.330]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:53.173]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:19:53.333 --> 02:20:01.459]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:20:01.719 --> 02:20:07.343]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:20:07.643 --> 02:20:12.907]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:20:13.147 --> 02:20:15.249]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:20:15.489 --> 02:20:27.638]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:20:27.878 --> 02:20:32.301]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:20:32.521 --> 02:20:33.482]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:20:33.642 --> 02:20:35.283]  Go to FilterMag.com.

[02:21:55.268 --> 02:22:08.311]  Uh-oh, Stephen Priest got a song talking about the crown playing right now.
[02:22:08.832 --> 02:22:09.812]  Don't come beat me up.
[02:22:10.192 --> 02:22:11.392]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:22:11.893 --> 02:22:13.033]  It's funny that song's playing.
[02:22:13.593 --> 02:22:14.373]  Talking about 1776.
[02:22:14.513 --> 02:22:20.355]  But, no, the culture of the military, much of our military culture in the U.S.
[02:22:20.495 --> 02:22:23.076]  is British or German in nature.
[02:22:23.789 --> 02:22:35.274]  Yes, I had a problem after I finished my career in the Royal Marines curbing my aggression which was an issue during my service which eventually led to me having to leave the Marines and eventually I actually
[02:22:53.078 --> 02:22:55.280]  Purely by fate, I ended up training with the ninjas.
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:02.645]  And it was the ninjas who took the aggression away from me to calm the fire that once burned inside me.
[02:23:03.546 --> 02:23:04.647]  And then you could focus it?
[02:23:05.568 --> 02:23:06.588]  Yes, I could focus it, yes.
[02:23:06.649 --> 02:23:10.952]  I could see things a lot more clearly and now I have a lot more control.
[02:23:11.946 --> 02:23:13.488]  Well, you know, that's good.
[02:23:13.929 --> 02:23:30.128]  I worry about all this killer training and switching off the thought process and being all gung-ho because so many times when a cop shoots an old lady in the back or some young kid in the back or beats somebody up or blows up at somebody for no reason, well, officer, why do you want to search my car?
[02:23:30.448 --> 02:23:31.970]  Get out of the bleeding vehicle, lady!
[02:23:32.430 --> 02:23:35.772]  I mean, I've had a friend who's in a wheelchair paralyzed because he's like, what's this?
[02:23:35.792 --> 02:23:36.933]  Well, those are my hand controls.
[02:23:36.993 --> 02:23:37.453]  Get out!
[02:23:37.753 --> 02:23:39.034]  Well, I can't get out quick enough.
[02:23:39.054 --> 02:23:44.637]  The guy was obviously on roids, blew up, drug him out of the vehicle, and the guy's paralyzed, chest down.
[02:23:45.358 --> 02:23:53.902]  And every time I check, they're former Special Forces, they're former Marine Force Recon, they're former... I mean, it's just they cannot control themselves.
[02:23:54.483 --> 02:23:56.124]  Do you think that's dangerous to have
[02:23:57.336 --> 02:24:04.641]  So many of our military who don't have impulse control and who have had their killer instinct honed, they can turn loose on the public as police?
[02:24:06.423 --> 02:24:07.624]  Not on the exchanges at all.
[02:24:07.664 --> 02:24:12.287]  I think basically the focus goes on those who get it wrong instead of those who get it right.
[02:24:14.395 --> 02:24:22.578]  Former service people do get it right, and they're the ones who make the police or any other forces for saving a success.
[02:24:22.978 --> 02:24:28.200]  No, no, I agree with you, but at the same time then, in the past they wouldn't put up with bad cops.
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:34.102]  Now it seems, at least in our country, they try to protect them, and they just are like these monsters stalking the countryside.
[02:24:35.643 --> 02:24:37.323]  Well, that's just the perception, truthfully.
[02:24:38.884 --> 02:24:40.744]  Alright, well I appreciate you joining us, and take care.
[02:24:41.265 --> 02:24:41.745]  Great, thanks.
[02:24:42.205 --> 02:24:42.405]  Bye.
[02:24:43.697 --> 02:24:44.878]  No, it is a problem, folks.
[02:24:44.898 --> 02:24:49.200]  You see these steroided head cops that just got out of the military, and they are just looking for a fight.
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:50.020]  And great!
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:52.361]  Go join the military again and go fight in Fallujah!
[02:24:52.381 --> 02:24:56.063]  I mean, don't fight me when you pull me over in the minivan.
[02:24:56.903 --> 02:24:57.784]  I don't want to fight with you.
[02:24:57.804 --> 02:24:58.884]  I'm not into fighting anymore.
[02:24:58.924 --> 02:25:02.566]  I got over that when I was about 18, 19 years old.
[02:25:03.726 --> 02:25:05.787]  And I see fighting as losing.
[02:25:06.187 --> 02:25:09.809]  I mean, I'll fight if I have to, but I'm just not like running around having to prove I'm a man.
[02:25:10.999 --> 02:25:16.642]  And I think this culture of just strutting around bugging your eyes out all day is really a big problem.
[02:25:17.703 --> 02:25:21.224]  Why don't you be real men and fight for this country with the pen?
[02:25:21.945 --> 02:25:25.527]  Or fight for this country by learning the Constitution and how you're violating it?
[02:25:25.847 --> 02:25:33.951]  Why don't you be men enough to actually morally have courage, which takes a lot more than just physical courage, to go against peer pressure?
[02:25:35.252 --> 02:25:39.934]  I mean, I'm not tooting my horn, but it was hard on the morning of 9-11 to get on the air and say it's the government op.
[02:25:40.755 --> 02:25:47.960]  And I laid out more info that first morning than most of the so-called 9-1-1 leaders have even figured out today.
[02:25:49.401 --> 02:25:51.842]  And it took moral courage to do that.
[02:25:53.183 --> 02:25:54.764]  And I hold that type of courage.
[02:25:54.884 --> 02:26:05.631]  I hold the courage of that woman saying no to those goon cops in Denver, and letting them arrest her, and letting them put her in handcuffs, and letting them throw the ticket down in front of her, and saying don't ever come back here again.
[02:26:07.256 --> 02:26:18.880]  I hold in esteem the people, you know, who would face down Billy Club wielding police when they were demanding their voting rights, or demanding that they be able to go in and use anybody's bathroom, you know, at the shopping mall.
[02:26:19.741 --> 02:26:24.663]  That takes courage, folks, to peaceably, frankly, let people walk up and hit you in the head with Billy Clubs.
[02:26:26.143 --> 02:26:29.124]  Now understand, I'm not saying let people walk up and hit you in the head with Billy Clubs.
[02:26:29.144 --> 02:26:33.586]  You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run, know when to fight.
[02:26:34.315 --> 02:26:37.597]  You know, there's a time to live, a time to die, a time for this, a time for that.
[02:26:39.337 --> 02:26:40.538]  You have to know when to fight.
[02:26:40.638 --> 02:26:49.962]  I mean, if you're sitting there with cameras rolling, and the cops are going to... Plus, you know, if you hit them back when they hit you, which is a natural, normal thing to do, you're going to spend time in prison.
[02:26:50.462 --> 02:26:56.205]  Let them crack you on the head, and then sue them, and own their house, and attack them that way.
[02:26:56.965 --> 02:26:57.366]  You see?
[02:26:58.006 --> 02:26:58.366]  You see?
[02:26:58.846 --> 02:27:02.408]  And then it'll be a lesson to all the rest of them not to behave like that and not to do that.
[02:27:05.893 --> 02:27:11.414]  But if a SWAT team is coming to put you in a paddy wagon and take you to a FEMA camp, well then you know what you've got to do.
[02:27:12.795 --> 02:27:20.836]  You see, there's all these different... There isn't one solution, one set thing for each little node.
[02:27:21.957 --> 02:27:24.377]  There's a multifaceted, multivariate situation.
[02:27:24.817 --> 02:27:29.058]  We're going to go to your calls as soon as we get back.
[02:27:30.018 --> 02:27:30.798]  So stay with us.
[02:27:32.139 --> 02:27:32.679]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:35.658 --> 02:27:38.641]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.582 --> 02:27:42.265]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.598 --> 02:27:47.959]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.219 --> 02:27:52.060]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:53.180]  Read the labels.
[02:27:53.621 --> 02:27:57.742]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:57.962 --> 02:28:02.163]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.523 --> 02:28:07.405]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:07.785 --> 02:28:11.347]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.567 --> 02:28:16.889]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.169 --> 02:28:19.910]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:21.090]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:28:45.214 --> 02:28:47.195]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:47.275 --> 02:28:57.980]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.882]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.942 --> 02:29:14.288]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.868 --> 02:29:21.713]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.113 --> 02:29:24.254]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:24.755 --> 02:29:29.718]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:29:30.018 --> 02:29:36.182]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:52.712 --> 02:29:57.734]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.055 --> 02:30:05.958]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.119 --> 02:30:13.162]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:13.362 --> 02:30:14.583]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:14.743 --> 02:30:18.126]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:18.186 --> 02:30:19.307]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:19.587 --> 02:30:20.868]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:21.068 --> 02:30:27.893]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:30:48.487 --> 02:30:48.987]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.448 --> 02:30:50.969]  This show is documented.
[02:30:51.489 --> 02:30:54.252]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.632 --> 02:30:58.175]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:58.595 --> 02:31:02.678]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:03.239 --> 02:31:07.462]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:31:08.443 --> 02:31:09.684]  The ring of fire.
[02:31:09.724 --> 02:31:13.407]  The taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[02:31:14.228 --> 02:31:15.429]  The ring of fire.
[02:31:16.683 --> 02:31:18.725]  Alright, we're going to rapid fire.
[02:31:18.805 --> 02:31:24.229]  Go to Joe, and Sonny, and Pat, and James, and Dave, and others.
[02:31:25.390 --> 02:31:27.672]  And just remember, we have another big article up today.
[02:31:27.732 --> 02:31:28.812]  We played the audio earlier.
[02:31:28.852 --> 02:31:34.697]  Maybe I should play that again, where kids find cameras in the bathrooms watching them.
[02:31:34.737 --> 02:31:35.538]  Secret cameras.
[02:31:36.318 --> 02:31:39.841]  In Georgia.
[02:31:39.941 --> 02:31:41.682]  And the principal just says, I don't care.
[02:31:43.263 --> 02:31:43.904]  In the middle school.
[02:31:45.097 --> 02:31:49.541]  And it's the high school principal who's put them there, and he's just like, I don't care, we're going to keep the cameras there.
[02:31:49.561 --> 02:32:00.550]  And there's all the other cases of where they even put cameras in the girls' showers at the middle schools, and then act like it's normal, and act like the parents are all crazy when they complain about it.
[02:32:02.171 --> 02:32:03.152]  I mean, that's total 1984.
[02:32:03.252 --> 02:32:06.375]  Let's go back to the calls now.
[02:32:06.395 --> 02:32:07.395]  I'm going to move quickly here.
[02:32:07.495 --> 02:32:08.616]  Joe in Wisconsin.
[02:32:08.636 --> 02:32:09.137]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:32:09.477 --> 02:32:09.877]  Hey, Alex.
[02:32:10.238 --> 02:32:13.020]  I got some feedback for you, and a cell phone update.
[02:32:14.078 --> 02:32:17.819]  First, you were talking about how the police are clamping down on everything.
[02:32:17.919 --> 02:32:21.520]  I don't think we're supposed to have any creative outlets for stress anymore.
[02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:25.601]  It has to be, watch the TV, be mesmerized, or whatever.
[02:32:25.921 --> 02:32:32.203]  After you did your expose on the medical procedures, I just felt morally sucker punched.
[02:32:33.563 --> 02:32:38.345]  You know it's good to get the gangrene of the soul out, because if you don't, it's going to fester.
[02:32:40.643 --> 02:33:00.730]  Because you asked about the current state of affairs in Wisconsin and I did a search and the Badger Herald, they had a March 3rd, 2005 article about all cell phones are mandatorily being sold with GPS systems in them.
[02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:04.832]  And there's only two counties in Wisconsin.
[02:33:05.012 --> 02:33:07.613]  One's Waukesha and the other's Dane County.
[02:33:08.231 --> 02:33:14.135]  that actually have 9-1-1 plus services, they call it, because it's just too expensive.
[02:33:14.155 --> 02:33:16.036]  And again, it tracks you, it tracks you.
[02:33:16.076 --> 02:33:24.281]  The cell phones are already all being tracked by the feds, but with the federal money, and your governor wants to put this in statewide two years ago, you went and looked it up, now only two counties are doing it.
[02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:31.986]  I don't know how many counties are in Wisconsin, but so two counties are doing the thing where they track you and watch you in real time.
[02:33:32.347 --> 02:33:33.948]  Well, the thing that concerns me is
[02:33:35.089 --> 02:33:38.292]  Number one, why are cell phone sales jumping through the roof?
[02:33:38.572 --> 02:33:39.833]  Why are they so cheap?
[02:33:40.134 --> 02:33:46.820]  And if you go to a call-in show about investments, Motorola is making these cell phones.
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:49.122]  Their stock is just jumping.
[02:33:49.863 --> 02:33:54.707]  And I'm pretty sure that they're going to make mandatory cell phone carrying.
[02:33:55.578 --> 02:33:57.579]  Or, of course, 9-1-1 service.
[02:33:57.979 --> 02:34:05.762]  You know, you're going to be... Well, already they're trying, they're on the verge, they said a year ago they're going to make it standard on all GM products, where you don't have a choice.
[02:34:06.282 --> 02:34:13.285]  The OnStar is on, and even if you don't activate it, and I've warned people in the worst cases, the FBI uses it to eavesdrop.
[02:34:13.345 --> 02:34:17.727]  It's just a cell phone with a speaker and a microphone, and it tracks you.
[02:34:17.867 --> 02:34:18.207]  Why?
[02:34:18.307 --> 02:34:19.928]  Why do we, again, it's going to be used.
[02:34:19.988 --> 02:34:23.549]  If you want to go get a service and use this yourself, fine.
[02:34:24.318 --> 02:34:29.761]  But the problem is... If you think that you're nuts, the cell phone must be on in order to receive a call.
[02:34:30.141 --> 02:34:32.302]  That means that it's electronically active.
[02:34:32.883 --> 02:34:40.147]  Try sticking it in a metal object like a metal shield for like a locker or something.
[02:34:40.347 --> 02:34:42.908]  Then have somebody call that cell phone and see if it works.
[02:34:43.348 --> 02:34:45.630]  Then as soon as you open the thing up, it's active.
[02:34:46.470 --> 02:34:48.091]  So you'll know when you're getting a signal.
[02:34:49.309 --> 02:34:50.110]  Anyway, that's all I got.
[02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:51.510]  Well, you bet.
[02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:53.171]  Plus, we all do it.
[02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:53.972]  Everybody does it.
[02:34:53.992 --> 02:34:55.112]  We're these social creatures.
[02:34:55.152 --> 02:34:56.053]  We think it's normal.
[02:34:57.133 --> 02:34:58.954]  Everybody just keeps putting it off on their head.
[02:34:59.695 --> 02:35:02.997]  Now, if you've got a radio wireless earpiece, that's not bad for you at all.
[02:35:03.477 --> 02:35:06.959]  Super low-powered radio transmitting up to your earpiece.
[02:35:06.979 --> 02:35:08.820]  If you've got the little wire, it's a little bit better.
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:13.002]  Some of that stuff transmits over and hits you.
[02:35:13.523 --> 02:35:17.605]  But there's like Swiss, Dutch, British, American studies in triplicate.
[02:35:18.394 --> 02:35:24.900]  The brain raises one degree in a certain area, you know, a certain circumference around the phone.
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:26.381]  It's a microwave.
[02:35:26.701 --> 02:35:28.363]  Holes in the brain, frying it.
[02:35:29.203 --> 02:35:31.866]  And we're so weak, we all just keep using them.
[02:35:32.506 --> 02:35:40.733]  I mean, I'll plug my little wireless thing in when I'm doing a radio interview or something, when I'm on the road for 30 minutes on a cell phone, or I'll do whatever.
[02:35:41.034 --> 02:35:42.515]  And I don't use mine hardly any now.
[02:35:42.955 --> 02:35:44.497]  But still, I'll just, it's convenient.
[02:35:44.537 --> 02:35:45.958]  Oh, just take the call, just take the call.
[02:35:46.727 --> 02:35:48.168]  And then we'll just give them to our kids.
[02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:50.110]  Oh yeah, you're 8 years old, honey.
[02:35:50.370 --> 02:35:51.632]  So I can keep track of you.
[02:35:51.712 --> 02:35:53.013]  Here's your new cell phone.
[02:35:53.413 --> 02:35:55.135]  And they're on it 10 hours a day with their friends.
[02:35:55.195 --> 02:35:58.878]  And you'll wonder why she gets a brain tumor when she's 18 years old.
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:03.943]  And it's just, it's not our opinion.
[02:36:04.924 --> 02:36:06.485]  It's just, it's not our opinion.
[02:36:06.565 --> 02:36:08.127]  It's absolute documented fact.
[02:36:10.749 --> 02:36:11.510]  It's just insane.
[02:36:12.142 --> 02:36:14.824]  It's going to make smoking a camel.
[02:36:14.864 --> 02:36:17.706]  If you've got a cold and having trouble breathing, smoke an extra camel.
[02:36:18.607 --> 02:36:20.509]  Doctor approved for helping respiration.
[02:36:21.089 --> 02:36:21.489]  Bull.
[02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:23.971]  Well, think about cell phones are good for you.
[02:36:24.052 --> 02:36:25.012]  Mercury is good for you.
[02:36:25.072 --> 02:36:25.753]  It's just not true.
[02:36:25.773 --> 02:36:30.176]  And these new ones are so crummy.
[02:36:31.417 --> 02:36:32.979]  I mean, I've tried my friend's cell phones.
[02:36:32.999 --> 02:36:34.120]  I've tried my parents' cell phones.
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:35.241]  I've tried my wife's cell phone.
[02:36:35.281 --> 02:36:36.101]  I've tried neighbors.
[02:36:36.482 --> 02:36:37.342]  They all break up.
[02:36:37.382 --> 02:36:38.583]  They're all total crud.
[02:36:39.084 --> 02:36:40.665]  I've got an old cell phone system.
[02:36:42.806 --> 02:36:44.827]  Which you can't even buy anymore for the last year or two.
[02:36:45.847 --> 02:36:46.968]  And it's not even that big of a phone.
[02:36:46.988 --> 02:36:48.708]  It's about twice the size a lot of people use.
[02:36:49.548 --> 02:36:52.109]  And it just works like a charm everywhere.
[02:36:52.129 --> 02:36:54.530]  And it doesn't cut out.
[02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:56.771]  And it's not satellite tracked or GPS enabled.
[02:36:58.411 --> 02:37:00.832]  So, there you go folks.
[02:37:01.973 --> 02:37:06.314]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sunny in Idaho.
[02:37:06.374 --> 02:37:08.035]  Sunny, is it sunny in Idaho today?
[02:37:08.475 --> 02:37:09.975]  It sure is, but we've got a lot of snow.
[02:37:09.995 --> 02:37:10.956]  How are you doing?
[02:37:12.186 --> 02:37:13.846]  Try this one on Alex.
[02:37:14.527 --> 02:37:21.348]  Everybody is absolutely horrified when they hear about the actions of somebody like Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:37:22.548 --> 02:37:28.410]  And yet, they have no connection to what goes on with an abortion.
[02:37:28.930 --> 02:37:33.291]  And I think that's because everybody subconsciously knows it could never happen to them.
[02:37:35.531 --> 02:37:37.772]  If abortion could be made retroactive,
[02:37:38.627 --> 02:37:40.088]  No, that's a good point.
[02:37:40.168 --> 02:37:40.789]  It's the weak.
[02:37:40.869 --> 02:37:41.909]  It's the small.
[02:37:41.969 --> 02:37:43.290]  We don't talk about that.
[02:37:43.851 --> 02:37:44.291]  Exactly.
[02:37:44.311 --> 02:37:45.612]  Let's just not go there.
[02:37:46.152 --> 02:37:46.693]  Exactly.
[02:37:46.713 --> 02:37:52.197]  I think everybody would think a little bit more about it, but I don't think there would be so many people pro-abortion.
[02:37:53.818 --> 02:37:55.379]  Well, there's not as many as there were.
[02:37:55.399 --> 02:37:58.921]  They've lost half their support in the last ten years.
[02:38:00.162 --> 02:38:01.083]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:38:02.084 --> 02:38:02.484]  Thank you.
[02:38:02.524 --> 02:38:03.104]  God bless you.
[02:38:03.144 --> 02:38:03.765]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:04.873 --> 02:38:08.214]  No, I actually feel pain.
[02:38:11.075 --> 02:38:11.915]  I feel empathy.
[02:38:12.675 --> 02:38:15.196]  And I think that's the beginning of strength, folks, having empathy.
[02:38:16.756 --> 02:38:30.360]  I even try to have empathy for some of the psychopathic people that are always trying to bring me down and lying about me and doing horrible things, and university professors and the newspapers and the TV shows that attack me, and the government operatives, the fake patriots with their websites that attack me.
[02:38:31.152 --> 02:38:35.816]  Really, it gives you great peace when you realize they're just sending listeners to you who will find out the truth.
[02:38:36.576 --> 02:38:40.520]  But it even brings a greater peace when you just forgive them and go, man, how miserable must they be?
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:43.502]  Because my life is so fulfilled.
[02:38:43.782 --> 02:38:44.783]  It is so good.
[02:38:45.323 --> 02:38:46.644]  Even the bad things that happen.
[02:38:49.227 --> 02:38:50.608]  I just see good in everything now.
[02:38:52.549 --> 02:38:53.990]  So many good things are happening.
[02:38:55.271 --> 02:38:59.495]  I hear people who have given up or say, it's all over, we can't defeat the New World Order, there's nothing we can do.
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:03.895]  So much of that has been sold to us by Tim LaHaye and the Left Behind series.
[02:39:03.935 --> 02:39:04.955]  I mean, have you read some of that?
[02:39:05.315 --> 02:39:06.476]  We've got to kill all the Muslims.
[02:39:06.516 --> 02:39:07.236]  They're the devil.
[02:39:07.276 --> 02:39:07.776]  Kill them all.
[02:39:07.796 --> 02:39:08.657]  Let God sort them out.
[02:39:09.057 --> 02:39:11.658]  Don't get involved in politics because the end of the world is coming anyways.
[02:39:12.018 --> 02:39:13.318]  That's not what the scriptures teach.
[02:39:13.338 --> 02:39:14.679]  That's not what history shows.
[02:39:14.699 --> 02:39:16.300]  That's not what the founding fathers did.
[02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:18.281]  That's not what the prophets did.
[02:39:19.181 --> 02:39:22.942]  And it's just a giant... People want to read that propaganda.
[02:39:22.963 --> 02:39:26.424]  They want to buy 50 million books and somebody makes billions of dollars off of it.
[02:39:27.296 --> 02:39:29.917]  They want to hear, everything's alright, go on and get along.
[02:39:29.937 --> 02:39:35.618]  They want Pat Robertson to say, go ahead and biometrically scan, go ahead and take the chip, and then make the sign of Satan.
[02:39:35.918 --> 02:39:37.658]  They, oh, it's okay, see?
[02:39:37.678 --> 02:39:40.979]  I don't have to do anything, but that way is death!
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:48.580]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pat, in Ohio.
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.221]  Go ahead, Pat.
[02:39:49.441 --> 02:39:50.601]  Hello, Alex.
[02:39:51.601 --> 02:39:56.342]  I'm planning on sending a lot of copies of your tapes to different ministries.
[02:39:57.493 --> 02:40:11.420]  And, well, but out of curiosity, I need to know, where can I get a copy of that, a hard copy of the memo that President, no, Vice President Dick Cheney used to take away the powers of NORAD?
[02:40:12.381 --> 02:40:13.741]  Where can I go get a copy of that?
[02:40:14.182 --> 02:40:17.403]  Okay, that's a memorandum, uh... Okay, but I've seen it on your tape!
[02:40:17.503 --> 02:40:22.226]  No, I know, I'm telling you, it's not a, it's a, I'm telling you what it is, it's a memorandum
[02:40:23.926 --> 02:40:34.236]  uh... order from rumsfeld who has then been directed he says by the vice president and there's no list of a document will how he was directed there should be and then he's ordering
[02:40:35.218 --> 02:40:42.821]  Uh, NORAD and the military no longer have shoot down powers that they've had since 1957 when it was formed and it's given unto himself or the Vice President.
[02:40:43.201 --> 02:40:44.421]  I don't have that memorandum in front of me.
[02:40:44.441 --> 02:40:46.322]  I don't know the exact name or number of it.
[02:40:46.362 --> 02:40:48.302]  It's on the, it's in the film.
[02:40:48.762 --> 02:40:51.943]  If you write down the name of the memorandum, if you hit pause on your DVD.
[02:40:51.963 --> 02:40:52.804]  Right, that's what I did.
[02:40:52.864 --> 02:40:58.806]  I used the pause button and I was trying to read it, the clause, the purpose clause and the application clause.
[02:40:58.846 --> 02:40:59.466]  You don't have to do that.
[02:40:59.506 --> 02:41:02.787]  You just got to type into a search engine the headline.
[02:41:04.628 --> 02:41:10.512]  And you'll get a hundred different websites that have got it posted, and you'll get the Pentagon website.
[02:41:11.452 --> 02:41:13.794]  We got that directly out of a PDF file on the Pentagon.
[02:41:14.274 --> 02:41:15.815]  Oh, but get that number.
[02:41:16.935 --> 02:41:19.497]  No, with a search engine you just need the name.
[02:41:21.778 --> 02:41:30.323]  Like, up at the top it's like Joint Forces Memorandum Order or something, 9X42, and I forget what it is, but it's something like that.
[02:41:31.156 --> 02:41:40.909]  Or you can type into Google, Donald Rumsfeld's order taking shoot down powers from the brass.
[02:41:41.229 --> 02:41:44.253]  Right, now does he still have that power as the Vice President?
[02:41:44.333 --> 02:41:45.334]  Or has it been taken?
[02:41:45.394 --> 02:41:49.820]  Well they always had that power, they just restricted it only unto themselves.
[02:41:52.814 --> 02:41:56.698]  So they always had that power, they were just taking it away from the admirals and generals.
[02:41:57.058 --> 02:41:58.920]  Oh, so now they have it all by themselves.
[02:41:59.020 --> 02:42:01.002]  Yes, they were not letting people shoot things down.
[02:42:01.542 --> 02:42:07.428]  Okay, and my second question was, a friend of mine, we might go up there next July to a bohemian grove.
[02:42:08.369 --> 02:42:19.037]  And I don't know if, because I love President Bush, so-called Christians, but I'd like to see if he... Well, he was in California for five days this year during it, and is sneaking around.
[02:42:19.077 --> 02:42:20.018]  We don't know if he was there.
[02:42:20.038 --> 02:42:20.839]  We know Bush Sr.
[02:42:20.879 --> 02:42:21.199]  is there.
[02:42:21.219 --> 02:42:24.241]  Normally, Presidents don't go while they're in office.
[02:42:24.942 --> 02:42:27.944]  But listen, I'm sorry, what was your question about?
[02:42:28.004 --> 02:42:33.368]  I was going to say, because he has the right Christians at heart.
[02:42:36.983 --> 02:42:40.964]  He is very influential.
[02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:44.485]  The people that follow Bush think Moloch is basically Jesus, and he's not.
[02:42:44.505 --> 02:42:45.185]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:45.745 --> 02:42:50.167]  I mean, seriously, I've had national Christian talk shows call me a wicked devil.
[02:42:51.267 --> 02:42:52.067]  Call me evil.
[02:42:52.547 --> 02:42:53.648]  Say I'm a liar.
[02:42:54.308 --> 02:42:55.848]  Skull and Bones isn't bad.
[02:42:55.948 --> 02:42:56.688]  It's no big deal.
[02:42:56.748 --> 02:42:58.129]  Bohemian Grove doesn't exist.
[02:42:58.209 --> 02:42:59.089]  I'm of the devil.
[02:42:59.109 --> 02:43:02.810]  I mean, how could... And people want to believe that lie.
[02:43:02.930 --> 02:43:04.010]  Oh yeah, Alex is bad.
[02:43:04.050 --> 02:43:04.450]  No, no.
[02:43:04.891 --> 02:43:06.171]  Bush, he's of the Lord.
[02:43:07.641 --> 02:43:10.042]  And you just don't talk bad about him, you're going to hell.
[02:43:10.482 --> 02:43:13.283]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in New York.
[02:43:13.303 --> 02:43:14.023]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:15.704]  Thanks, how you doing Alex?
[02:43:15.764 --> 02:43:17.245]  Good sir, good to hear from you.
[02:43:17.365 --> 02:43:24.587]  I love your work, I want to thank you for providing us with some of the greatest tools I've had in my personal experience trying to talk to people.
[02:43:26.488 --> 02:43:34.211]  This Thanksgiving, the day before, my mother and my stepfather, both very active volunteers, they're with the Democrats, they work for Maurice Hinchey.
[02:43:35.427 --> 02:43:43.994]  Um, so, I handed them a brand new copy of The Road to Tyranny, and my stepfather hand-delivered it to, uh, my congressman, Maurice Inge, for the holiday.
[02:43:44.134 --> 02:43:47.777]  I haven't gotten any feedback from him yet, but at least I went as far as I could with that.
[02:43:47.938 --> 02:43:48.898]  Well, that's exciting!
[02:43:49.839 --> 02:43:54.103]  Uh, also, uh, we had a problem with the GCN server being down two days ago.
[02:43:55.265 --> 02:43:56.526]  Yeah, that was GCN.
[02:43:57.086 --> 02:44:15.477]  It wasn't a government thing, it's just, you know, we're up for every six months or so, there's a problem, or hard drives burn out, and stuff happens, and then magically you can't get a hold of a guy that's supposed to fix it, and so we're in the process of moving that, upgrading it to a more redundant system.
[02:44:15.577 --> 02:44:18.239]  I don't run the GCN servers, that's the Genesis Network.
[02:44:19.009 --> 02:44:25.931]  I did take the time to call up at the time my broadband provider explained that it had been done before on October 5th.
[02:44:26.471 --> 02:44:27.711]  He said it had been blocked before.
[02:44:27.731 --> 02:44:28.452]  Yeah, that was different.
[02:44:29.072 --> 02:44:30.572]  And they explained it was different.
[02:44:30.592 --> 02:44:32.453]  I wanted them to know not to piss on my parade.
[02:44:33.273 --> 02:44:34.713]  I'm Graham.
[02:44:35.273 --> 02:44:35.773]  Great work.
[02:44:36.374 --> 02:44:37.854]  I've got a brother-in-law.
[02:44:37.894 --> 02:44:39.634]  He's a mechanical engineer for Lockheed Martin.
[02:44:39.654 --> 02:44:41.755]  He's a 4.0 RPI student.
[02:44:42.255 --> 02:44:45.716]  I've been presenting him with the Galileo's Law of Free Falling Bodies.
[02:44:46.545 --> 02:44:52.009]  And you've given us enough tools to convince educated people that will listen for us.
[02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:54.532]  Yeah, how do buildings fall faster than gravity?
[02:44:54.772 --> 02:44:57.054]  Only if they're aerosolized and totally demolished.
[02:44:57.094 --> 02:44:57.594]  Can I do that?
[02:44:58.174 --> 02:44:58.715]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:59.736 --> 02:45:03.899]  You're also my favorite source for Miami, because I can't seem to find a lot of coverage on that.
[02:45:03.919 --> 02:45:04.960]  I hear you.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.841]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:45:08.243 --> 02:45:09.824]  I really do appreciate that.
[02:45:09.984 --> 02:45:11.085]  What a nice call from you.
[02:45:11.684 --> 02:45:12.884]  There's James in New York.
[02:45:13.765 --> 02:45:16.425]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Georgia.
[02:45:16.485 --> 02:45:17.365]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:45:17.385 --> 02:45:17.805]  Go ahead.
[02:45:18.246 --> 02:45:18.646]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:18.686 --> 02:45:19.746]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:45:19.826 --> 02:45:20.026]  You bet.
[02:45:20.046 --> 02:45:20.506]  Thank you.
[02:45:20.746 --> 02:45:23.387]  I'm going to make this quick because I'm on a poor quality cordless phone.
[02:45:23.407 --> 02:45:23.887]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:24.827 --> 02:45:30.428]  Two days ago, I was unable to hear most of your interview with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:45:31.209 --> 02:45:32.109]  Yes, the Internet was down.
[02:45:32.409 --> 02:45:33.169]  Yes, that's true.
[02:45:33.249 --> 02:45:35.670]  And I did catch a snippet of it, but not very much.
[02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:36.870]  And I was very intrigued.
[02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:41.251]  And I wanted to request a podcast for that interview, if that's possible.
[02:45:41.890 --> 02:45:44.733]  Yeah, just email it to Paul over there.
[02:45:45.073 --> 02:45:47.275]  I believe it's been put out on podcast, or it should be.
[02:45:47.295 --> 02:45:51.339]  I've subscribed to the podcast, and it's not up yet.
[02:45:51.439 --> 02:45:53.480]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:45:53.821 --> 02:45:54.842]  Yeah, and I'm not a member yet.
[02:45:55.062 --> 02:45:57.304]  If I had high speed, I would be there in a second.
[02:45:57.724 --> 02:45:58.805]  It's got slow speed.
[02:45:59.125 --> 02:46:00.346]  Everything's put up in two speeds.
[02:46:01.525 --> 02:46:04.728]  Okay, well then since you're having a holiday special, I guess I should do that now.
[02:46:05.108 --> 02:46:08.652]  Yeah, well you can also get a membership from the network, and then you get everything.
[02:46:09.072 --> 02:46:09.252]  Right.
[02:46:09.393 --> 02:46:15.138]  You get higher quality streams that aren't a little 8-bit, and you get all the archives and a bunch of other stuff, so you can get it from them too.
[02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:15.759]  Wonderful.
[02:46:16.119 --> 02:46:17.360]  Thank you very much for all you do.
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:20.023]  Thank you sir, I really do appreciate your call.
[02:46:21.044 --> 02:46:26.549]  Look, if I sound bummed out today, I'm not bummed out, I'm just calm.
[02:46:28.547 --> 02:46:33.829]  And I'm calm because I know in the end, good always overcomes evil.
[02:46:36.491 --> 02:46:48.196]  And I know that people are waking up faster than they've ever woken up before, but at the same time, there is a literal invasion of the truth movement, the patriot movement,
[02:46:49.051 --> 02:46:59.279]  The resistance by disinfo agents, by kooks, by people that tell you there's no hope, by people that tell you it's all over, there's nothing you can do, you don't have any power, you can't affect change.
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:13.330]  And you know, whether they're fellow travelers with the New World Order, just because they buy into the same propaganda, or whether they're actually paid, or whether they're COINTELPRO, it runs the gamut.
[02:47:15.172 --> 02:47:18.074]  But from the bottom of my heart, from real study,
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:23.781]  From really crunching the numbers, from really looking at history, I'm not putting a good face on it.
[02:47:23.821 --> 02:47:25.142]  I'm not cheerleading up here.
[02:47:26.622 --> 02:47:28.142]  We really are having an effect.
[02:47:28.222 --> 02:47:30.283]  We really are getting the word out to people.
[02:47:30.323 --> 02:47:32.463]  We really are changing minds.
[02:47:32.503 --> 02:47:34.124]  We really have defeated a lot of evil.
[02:47:34.764 --> 02:47:39.665]  Good things are happening on so many fronts and we need to remember that and know that.
[02:47:40.285 --> 02:47:42.226]  And know that resistance is not futile.
[02:47:44.088 --> 02:47:45.789]  At the same time, we've got to be wary.
[02:47:46.130 --> 02:47:54.296]  People ask me why I get frustrated and talk about some of the other groups that are out there with networks or radio shows and, you know, why I think they're disgusting.
[02:47:54.336 --> 02:47:55.877]  And it's because they pose as us.
[02:47:57.358 --> 02:48:06.405]  They imply that support us, that supports, you know, these shows and trying to blur the lines to where people think that it's my show.
[02:48:07.466 --> 02:48:10.989]  And then people associate my broadcast with some of the other broadcasts that are out there.
[02:48:11.704 --> 02:48:17.769]  So, you really should have discernment when you're listening to these programs and these shows.
[02:48:17.809 --> 02:48:20.471]  And think about the track records of the individuals you're listening to.
[02:48:20.831 --> 02:48:22.393]  What they've promised in the past.
[02:48:22.453 --> 02:48:23.553]  What they haven't delivered on.
[02:48:23.874 --> 02:48:24.834]  The things they've done.
[02:48:25.815 --> 02:48:31.640]  Now, I think if you start thinking about that a little bit, you can separate the wheat from the chaff rather quickly.
[02:48:32.717 --> 02:48:37.205]  We'll come back at a few final news items and take a call or two.
[02:48:37.826 --> 02:48:39.048]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:48:39.389 --> 02:48:40.791]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:40.851 --> 02:48:41.553]  Check it out today.
[02:48:46.596 --> 02:48:49.438]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.698 --> 02:48:51.259]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.619 --> 02:48:56.302]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.643 --> 02:49:03.367]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.687 --> 02:49:05.669]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:05.889 --> 02:49:08.711]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.811 --> 02:49:13.474]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.695 --> 02:49:18.098]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.338 --> 02:49:25.543]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.804 --> 02:49:28.225]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:50:19.373 --> 02:50:25.738]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as leads, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:51:53.763 --> 02:52:14.607]  Just a plug for Ryan Slickheisen, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Violet Jones, my webmasters, the main writers, the people that write the comments, the lawyers for the site, all of you that have been sending us listener comments, we're posting those in prominent areas of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com every day where potentially millions of people
[02:52:15.287 --> 02:52:18.630]  I don't like to toot our horn, but it is a ridiculous amount of visitors.
[02:52:19.690 --> 02:52:20.191]  Thank God.
[02:52:21.331 --> 02:52:29.498]  We'll read your comments if they're not just total plugs or totally commercialistic.
[02:52:30.298 --> 02:52:31.299]  We even allow some of that.
[02:52:32.260 --> 02:52:34.041]  Even people we disagree with, we've been posting them.
[02:52:34.081 --> 02:52:37.784]  In fact, I forgot to tell Paul, I think it went to my mailbox instead of his.
[02:52:38.264 --> 02:52:44.869]  I want that thing up there where the guy said I was evil because we had an ad for tasers from a self-defense website.
[02:52:45.603 --> 02:52:47.204]  No, no, I'm not against guns and tasers.
[02:52:47.224 --> 02:52:48.544]  I'm against their misuse, sir.
[02:52:49.805 --> 02:52:51.986]  Against the people that are wielding them improperly.
[02:52:52.846 --> 02:52:54.007]  I need to write an article about that.
[02:52:54.047 --> 02:52:54.527]  It's important.
[02:52:54.567 --> 02:53:02.210]  But death toll from road accidents, 390 times that from terrorism study shows.
[02:53:03.711 --> 02:53:11.694]  And the body count from road accidents in developed economies is 390 times higher than the death toll in these countries from international terrorism.
[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:15.862]  And the numbers are even higher in the United States.
[02:53:16.782 --> 02:53:21.807]  So, you're 390 times, this is the point I always make, this is out of the French News Agency, AFP.
[02:53:22.707 --> 02:53:24.268]  You get in your car because that's freedom.
[02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:28.372]  You get in your car knowing it's the number one cause of death.
[02:53:28.412 --> 02:53:34.216]  You put your babies in the car knowing, I guess you don't know, but you should, that's the number one cause of death.
[02:53:34.276 --> 02:53:35.978]  It dwarfs everything else.
[02:53:36.118 --> 02:53:38.320]  Then is drowning in mop buckets.
[02:53:39.325 --> 02:53:41.267]  Uh, bathtubs you don't let the water out of.
[02:53:41.827 --> 02:53:43.308]  Pails of water in the backyard.
[02:53:43.328 --> 02:53:45.350]  Tens of thousands a year.
[02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:48.773]  And number, what was it last time I checked on the World Almanac?
[02:53:48.813 --> 02:53:51.034]  It was number 14 a few years ago.
[02:53:51.054 --> 02:53:51.935]  I haven't checked it lately.
[02:53:51.955 --> 02:53:53.716]  Uh, that, uh, guns.
[02:53:54.357 --> 02:53:56.138]  Guns are like the number 14 cause of death.
[02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:02.143]  So you tell the gun grabbers that when they try to go, the children, the children are dying.
[02:54:02.163 --> 02:54:08.788]  Of course, 80 plus percent of those that say they're children are really gang members that died while being shot coming in the back of your house.
[02:54:10.012 --> 02:54:11.392]  So, I just thought I'd mention that.
[02:54:11.412 --> 02:54:27.476]  So we're going to give up our whole way of life, all our freedoms, lick the boots of police in black uniforms and a ski mask, and I guarantee you cops kill more Americans than terrorists do in a ten year period, to keep us safe from imaginary boogeymen that are just behind everything.
[02:54:27.516 --> 02:54:32.397]  We've got to randomly search you on the side of the road and at the shopping mall because Al Zakari might get you.
[02:54:35.609 --> 02:54:37.370]  Total and complete fraud.
[02:54:38.431 --> 02:54:41.413]  In some bad news here, there is a new tropical storm.
[02:54:41.973 --> 02:54:46.116]  They have never recorded this in this time of the year, and it looks like others may keep developing.
[02:54:46.136 --> 02:54:50.779]  We've already had the busiest and most severe hurricane season ever recorded.
[02:54:50.819 --> 02:54:57.284]  Typhoons are at record levels, and we have Tropical Storm Epsilon, public advisory, and
[02:54:59.009 --> 02:55:01.292]  Major changes taking place.
[02:55:01.813 --> 02:55:07.700]  A really scary article here on the London Guardian, it's up on Infowars.com, about the jet strength slowing.
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:17.411]  And they say it could cause, this is a decades long study, from 1957 to now, shows that actually we're going to probably go into another ice age.
[02:55:18.408 --> 02:55:22.670]  What you've been hearing... There are changes afoot, but are they natural or are they man-made?
[02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:29.513]  A volcano ejects more fossil fuels and more gases than all of human activity in the last hundred years.
[02:55:29.833 --> 02:55:31.354]  One major event with a volcano.
[02:55:32.214 --> 02:55:34.095]  We're out of time here.
[02:55:34.115 --> 02:55:36.476]  The new film, Order of Death, is out.
[02:55:36.977 --> 02:55:41.158]  And when you get it, you also get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:55:41.519 --> 02:55:44.320]  Comes with it for $24.95 each additional copy.
[02:55:45.778 --> 02:55:49.520]  Both the films together is $9.95 so you can give them as gifts.
[02:55:50.141 --> 02:55:50.801]  No excuse.
[02:55:50.841 --> 02:55:51.622]  Get them out to people.
[02:55:51.962 --> 02:55:54.923]  InfoWars.com or give them a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:55:55.284 --> 02:55:55.964]  Just go sign up.
[02:55:55.984 --> 02:55:57.305]  It's so easy for a month or a year.
[02:55:57.805 --> 02:56:01.107]  And give it as a gift inside that card or email.
[02:56:02.448 --> 02:56:03.568]  Or give them your own passcode.
[02:56:03.588 --> 02:56:07.831]  Just don't spread it around too much or it degrades service and I've got to add more servers.
[02:56:08.935 --> 02:56:10.817]  The object is getting the word out, so c'est la vie.
[02:56:11.257 --> 02:56:17.202]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:18.042 --> 02:56:18.723]  We're out of time.
[02:56:18.783 --> 02:56:19.744]  God bless you all.
[02:56:19.784 --> 02:56:21.345]  We're going to win this thing with God's help.
[02:56:21.385 --> 02:56:23.287]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:25.068 --> 02:56:29.952]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
