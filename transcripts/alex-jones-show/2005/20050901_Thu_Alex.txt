[00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:08.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:09.964]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:11.385]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.106]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:17.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:22.010]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:33.356]  Well, there are about a thousand different very important facets to Hurricane Katrina's aftermath.
[00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:36.077]  As gas prices in some areas of the country
[00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.822]  Go above $6.
[00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:43.004]  Last night it was getting near $6.
[00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:47.526]  Now it's above $6 in some areas of Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:52.888]  And day one when the hurricane hit, gas prices went up.
[00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:01.572]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is, part of it at least, price gouging by some of the sellers.
[00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.353]  At least it was the first few days.
[00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:04.854]  The retail sellers.
[00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:15.712]  But now it's predominantly gouging by the oil companies themselves, who have been raping the living daylights out of us for the last two years.
[00:01:15.812 --> 00:01:23.798]  I mean, oil prices had already doubled in the last two years from what their price was.
[00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:28.461]  And now we may even see a doubling of that doubling.
[00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:42.739]  Overnight because of Katrina, and you watch, long after they get things stabilized and the bottlenecks repaired, long after that happens, it'll never drop down to even the all-time high of a week ago.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.243]  Training us that we've got to pay exorbitant prices for fuel.
[00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:51.465]  Incrementally ratcheting it up.
[00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:54.547]  You know, for many years, ten years now,
[00:01:55.632 --> 00:02:09.885]  Every year I interview Jim Tucker from American Free Press, who for 26 years has been sneaking into the Bilderberg Group that holds its different elitist meetings in different areas of Europe each year.
[00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.387]  Every once in a while here in the U.S.
[00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:19.013]  And royalty and the heads of all the big banks and prime ministers go.
[00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.936]  It's a who's who of the elite getting together.
[00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:30.257]  And a year before the wall fell and East and West Germany merged, Tucker said, oh, they're planning to bring down the wall.
[00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:31.377]  It's going to be staged.
[00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:33.939]  And that indeed happened a year later.
[00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:45.165]  I mean, he's made literally dozens and dozens and dozens of predictions off of what his spies or the documents he's able to steal, in his own words, show.
[00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:49.467]  And we had him on about four or five months ago.
[00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:55.531]  Fresh back from the Bilderberg Group meeting over in Europe, and he said, Henry Kissinger was quite pleased.
[00:02:56.552 --> 00:03:05.578]  We will be paying $150 a barrel for oil.
[00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.961]  $150 a barrel for oil within a year.
[00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:18.488]  And I said, Jim, I sure hope that Kissinger's wrong, but since these are the people that actually run the planet, we'll probably be paying
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.481]  150 bucks a barrel.
[00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:31.365]  And 150 bucks a barrel will be about $9 to $10 when it's translated down at the pump.
[00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.567]  So enjoy your $10 a gallon fuel.
[00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:39.168]  And of course they will tell you that there's no inflation.
[00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.010]  Anyone that says it is probably trying to aid Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.752]  You know, we've had the State Department just absolutely savage us
[00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:50.677]  Savage the conspiracy websites.
[00:03:51.617 --> 00:03:53.738]  They say that we're out of control.
[00:03:53.758 --> 00:04:03.601]  We say that China kills dissidents and harvests their organs and that there's no WMDs and just insane stuff on their website.
[00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:09.463]  Meanwhile, the State Department's own website says that China kills dissidents and sells their organs.
[00:04:09.503 --> 00:04:14.485]  So, they're even contradicting their own website now in their fervor to try to discredit us.
[00:04:15.145 --> 00:04:17.866]  And we have a detailed article on that up on
[00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:22.696]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:34.678]  When we get back, we will go over just the deteriorating, the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gulf.
[00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.319]  We got the blues down in the Gulf, my friends.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:45.921]  Talk about that muddy river.
[00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.215]  That has now become New Orleans.
[00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:52.299]  Under many feet of water.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.001]  Like Atlantis.
[00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:02.910]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.173]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:10.197]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.257 --> 00:05:14.481]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:18.625]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.607]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:24.050]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.172]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:28.815]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:31.998]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.178 --> 00:05:35.060]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:41.646]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:45.949]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:47.730]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.131]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.472]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.492 --> 00:05:52.733]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:09.537]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.757 --> 00:06:21.025]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:23.907]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:28.350]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.691]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:32.711]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:38.933]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:44.795]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:49.120]  Get the Bricky Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.561]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:03.838]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:07.921]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:09.063]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.483 --> 00:07:13.627]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:18.031]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:23.276]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:27.178]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.418 --> 00:07:32.762]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:35.763]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:36.964]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:07.777]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:16.219]  Alright my friends, 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this first hour of broadcast.
[00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:22.621]  I'm about to go over the latest developments in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:23.582]  Devastated.
[00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:30.987]  Just absolutely destroyed in many cases there on the Gulf Coast.
[00:08:31.047 --> 00:08:41.234]  A lot of new big developments that I'm sure most of you are aware of but we've got some news behind the news and some observations that need to be made.
[00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:46.137]  Also coming up here in about 25 minutes we have a meteorologist coming on
[00:08:47.465 --> 00:08:52.648]  Who has done some of the most revealing work concerning weather wars.
[00:08:53.869 --> 00:09:06.117]  And the government's own admission that they do have weather modification and weather generating systems that are both controlled from the ground and via the air.
[00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:30.616]  And I'm not saying the hurricane was a government action, though it happened near the September 11th anniversary, right when Bush's approval ratings were incredibly low, and Bush blocked the specific funds for repairing the dikes and levees, and this tropical depression suddenly got strengthened out of nowhere and raced towards the Gulf Coast,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.646]  But really, with all the evidence out there on the table, I don't want to believe and I don't believe this was a government action.
[00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:46.835]  Now, the general public, most people in America today, are not aware that weather modification is at least 50 years old.
[00:09:48.477 --> 00:09:53.603]  And that a few years ago we had massive floods in South Texas that killed 35 people in one night.
[00:09:54.424 --> 00:10:04.414]  And it was in the newspaper that the Navy was doing weather modification with aircraft in those very storms that went from being large to being record size.
[00:10:05.895 --> 00:10:10.079]  And again, over 10 inches of rain was dumped in just a few hours, and it was horrible.
[00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:15.243]  And again, I have History Channel documentaries that listeners have mailed me.
[00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:31.430]  I have one from the Weather Channel, the Atmosphere Show, had one on weather modification and admitted that our government could create massive storms and floods to drown the enemy supply lines in Vietnam.
[00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:40.173]  And so, when we mention weather control, we get emails going, you people are complete lunatics, it doesn't exist.
[00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:49.799]  Folks, on InfoWars.com, right now, we have legislative bills at the congressional level in D.C.
[00:10:49.859 --> 00:11:00.262]  introduced, calling for blocking not just weather weapons, not just meteorological weapons, but tectonic, seismic weapons, volcanic weapons.
[00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:02.723]  These things do exist.
[00:11:03.443 --> 00:11:05.944]  It's not just the Hollywood movie, The Corps.
[00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:13.253]  The San Francisco Chronicle reported on something that I'd only seen in a few scientific journals.
[00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:17.136]  Then I saw reports that the government considered it to be classified.
[00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:21.299]  Those articles were removed, retroactively, that the U.S.
[00:11:21.359 --> 00:11:25.061]  government has developed antimatter bombs.
[00:11:26.062 --> 00:11:28.823]  And they've never been able to test them, though they know that they're operational.
[00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:37.349]  They can't test them because they could deploy one on Mars, and it could potentially destroy the entire solar system.
[00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:42.249]  So they can't test them, they've just built them.
[00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.290]  That's wonderful.
[00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.492]  You've built anti-matter bombs.
[00:11:47.532 --> 00:12:00.159]  So it's 2005, folks, and in 1944, our government had the Fat Boy, which could blow up a major, destroy a major city.
[00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:04.306]  So, believe me, that's not the height of advancement.
[00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:18.489]  When they tell you the SR-71 Blackbird, in service in 1955, is the fastest plane in 2005, 50 years later, folks, I'm telling you that's not the case.
[00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.231]  They have aircraft that can go from New York to Tokyo in less than an hour.
[00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:27.091]  Alright, so,
[00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:41.007]  Can the criminals that run the global system, our overlords, our owners, our masters, can they create earthquakes?
[00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.070]  Can they create tsunamis?
[00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.392]  Can they create hurricanes?
[00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:47.252]  Yes.
[00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:57.842]  But the latest science on it shows, with mathematical calculations, looking at the different systems our government has, shows they cannot control them.
[00:12:59.938 --> 00:13:04.781]  They cannot control them, especially large formations.
[00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:13.806]  Yes, they can take a tropical depression by ionizing the atmosphere with giant antenna farms on the ground or on ships.
[00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:14.987]  This is the published stuff.
[00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:22.812]  Then using jets to spray and seed with chemicals in an existing storm, they can create a hurricane.
[00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:26.684]  With the proper sea temperatures and proper things.
[00:13:26.704 --> 00:13:32.228]  You know, it's like I can't make a chocolate cake without the chocolate and without the eggs and without the flour.
[00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:33.469]  Without the sugar.
[00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.091]  Well, it's the same thing with the globalists.
[00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:38.192]  They can't just make hurricanes out of nothing.
[00:13:38.572 --> 00:13:42.495]  They take existing jet streams and gulf streams.
[00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:44.476]  They take existing El Nino effects.
[00:13:44.837 --> 00:13:48.679]  They take existing weather patterns and then manipulate them.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.663]  That's why I don't believe that this is a government action.
[00:13:54.508 --> 00:14:24.001]  Because whereas, even with the advanced technologies they've got, and folks, I've even interviewed generals who are over the HART program, here on the program, here on the show, and they will tell you that whereas these type of things can be created or accentuated, they call it weather modification, it's not really creation, to make one sit there off the Gulf Coast of Florida for a few days and then race up and
[00:14:24.787 --> 00:14:31.488]  You know, just be 50 miles off from a T-bone hit of New Orleans, it's just the technology is not there.
[00:14:32.628 --> 00:14:35.529]  And I mean, I'm being criticized by different parties right now.
[00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.609]  Alex Jones, see, he's evil!
[00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.929]  Why?
[00:14:39.049 --> 00:14:40.650]  He won't say it's the government.
[00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.850]  We go off what we can prove.
[00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:51.132]  I mean, already most of the audience is having probably troubles dealing with what I have posted on my website.
[00:14:51.812 --> 00:14:53.552]  I mean, Secretary of Defense Cohen
[00:14:54.834 --> 00:15:01.096]  In 97, saying whether weapons are here and are real and are more dangerous than nuclear weapons.
[00:15:03.196 --> 00:15:04.857]  I mean, I have the legislation.
[00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:14.499]  I have the articles where, well, just a few months ago they had the 50th anniversary or 60th whatever of the Russians' victory over the Nazis.
[00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:15.999]  It'd be 60th.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.181]  And it was horrible thunderstorms and the Russians went out and set up their antennas and
[00:15:22.944 --> 00:15:25.126]  Had some jets flying by and it was clear sky.
[00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:28.629]  And it was all over the news.
[00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:36.036]  Folks, this stuff is real, but just because it's real doesn't mean that the government created this hurricane.
[00:15:36.396 --> 00:15:38.157]  Now, let's look at what the government really did do.
[00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.721]  On average, the federal government doubled in size.
[00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:45.043]  The average federal agency doubled.
[00:15:45.164 --> 00:15:49.027]  Some quadrupled, some got smaller, but on average we had a doubling.
[00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:53.779]  And I remember a year ago seeing people complaining, man, Houston Chronicle!
[00:15:54.479 --> 00:16:03.047]  Hundreds of thousands could die if Houston Chronicle reported if New Orleans is hit by a Category 4 Greater Hurricane.
[00:16:04.489 --> 00:16:09.553]  And the hydrologists, the meteorologists, they were all saying this.
[00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:11.275]  The people looking at the topography.
[00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:23.956]  They took that funding after 9-11 and they cut it almost to nothing for flood retention to hold back the floods.
[00:16:24.836 --> 00:16:26.677]  And they cut it each successive year.
[00:16:29.097 --> 00:16:31.498]  And no one was reporting on this the last few days.
[00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:40.801]  Now finally Salon and a few other major publications, I even saw a Yahoo story, it is now being reported on.
[00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:51.652]  And then now it's coming out that Bush was playing guitar and partying and Lisa Rice was joking and laughing, you know, just a day and a half ago.
[00:16:51.852 --> 00:16:53.494]  I mean, they don't care.
[00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.476]  Bill Clinton doesn't care.
[00:16:56.536 --> 00:16:58.297]  I mean, they love these disasters.
[00:16:58.337 --> 00:17:03.442]  They get to grandstand and go basically suck off of all of the contributions that are given.
[00:17:05.263 --> 00:17:07.104]  And so it's the same thing happening again.
[00:17:08.245 --> 00:17:10.067]  And here's the government, unable,
[00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:19.001]  Outside the Superdome, where tens of thousands of people are trapped now for three days, outside the Superdome today, somebody fired a gunshot.
[00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:31.285]  So the police and the military retreat in cowering fear and say, we've got to stop the evacuation because somebody fired a gun.
[00:17:34.026 --> 00:17:35.926]  I mean, what do we pay the police?
[00:17:36.687 --> 00:17:40.528]  What do we pay the National Guardsmen for?
[00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:52.033]  I mean, for all their black masks and all their little outfits and all their armored vehicles... 30 years ago, folks, if we had a bunch of looters running around, they would have been dealt with.
[00:17:53.294 --> 00:17:55.955]  And the media... and the looters are horrible.
[00:17:57.096 --> 00:18:04.241]  But at the same time, the media will point cameras at some mother with a bag and her two children with her and go, oh, look, looters!
[00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:06.002]  Most of those people are not looters.
[00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:08.924]  Though there are a bunch of unsavory, out-of-control looters.
[00:18:09.966 --> 00:18:11.887]  And now they're trying to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:18:11.927 --> 00:18:12.287]  Why?
[00:18:13.028 --> 00:18:14.789]  Why will Walmart be liable?
[00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:17.411]  People broke into Walmart and got guns.
[00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.911]  Look how bad guns are!
[00:18:20.612 --> 00:18:21.373]  Well, look at the L.A.
[00:18:21.453 --> 00:18:28.257]  riots with the Korean shopkeepers holding back the rioters and containing it when the police basically said, we're not going to go in there.
[00:18:28.757 --> 00:18:30.839]  It was citizens who stopped a lot of the rioting.
[00:18:32.219 --> 00:18:37.002]  And there are scum that were shooting at the firemen in the riots in L.A.
[00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:37.763]  in the early 90s.
[00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:39.444]  I mean, it's just scum of the earth, folks.
[00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:42.953]  But who are the heroes of the day?
[00:18:43.073 --> 00:18:46.434]  It's not the government, regardless of how much the media says that.
[00:18:46.494 --> 00:18:49.456]  It isn't the government that didn't repair the levees and dikes.
[00:18:51.697 --> 00:19:04.242]  No, it's the citizens of Louisiana and Texas and Mississippi who are taking in by the millions now, millions of people who are homeless, taking them in, feeding them, donating.
[00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:14.810]  And again, the government cannot protect you, is not going to protect you, is never going to take care of you, whether it's Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid.
[00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.372]  They only got you addicted to government to get you under their control.
[00:19:18.472 --> 00:19:20.113]  Now they're removing all of that.
[00:19:21.074 --> 00:19:31.000]  And so for everybody out there that's counting on the government to take care of them, whether it's a terrorist attack, or an asteroid, or a giant earthquake, or a tsunami,
[00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:33.442]  They're not going to protect you.
[00:19:33.542 --> 00:19:38.586]  You've got to make preparations to take care of yourself!
[00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.133]  And I mean, I saw Chris Matthews last night just going, oh, the federal government, aren't they just wonderful?
[00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:51.897]  Oh, a lot of people don't like the feds, states' rights, but man, aren't they doing a great job?
[00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.039]  That's not what the mayor of New Orleans says.
[00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.380]  They're screwing it all up!
[00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:58.082]  Chertoff and the rest of them.
[00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:05.890]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:04.187]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:07.310]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.734]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.154 --> 00:21:12.995]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.296 --> 00:21:17.860]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.482]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:35.673]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.713 --> 00:21:42.778]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:21:52.286 --> 00:21:53.266]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:53.587]  Inflation.
[00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:54.087]  One and the same.
[00:22:07.478 --> 00:22:12.549]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:19.531 --> 00:22:22.734]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:25.777]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:25.837 --> 00:22:30.181]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:32.323]  Here is reality.
[00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:36.266]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:40.951]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:45.616]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:08.044]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:08.364 --> 00:23:13.649]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:17.072]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:24:14.425 --> 00:24:26.191]  We're going to go to Charles in Louisiana in just a minute or so, but more Navy ships headed to the Gulf Coast.
[00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:37.518]  The aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Freeman, was headed to the Gulf Coast Thursday to serve as a floating command center for Hurricane Katrina relief operations.
[00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.771]  Meanwhile, Bush says he can't spare any troops from Iraq, though.
[00:24:44.491 --> 00:24:49.692]  He's just got to have, well, a doubling of the National Guard now that are going to be sent there, up to 28,000.
[00:24:51.972 --> 00:25:09.396]  And I've just got to say this, and for those that aren't informed on it, just put on your thinking caps, remember, back in 1995, the Red Cross, which is actually a globalist intelligence agency, a lot of well-meaning people that serve it, but the leadership is absolutely criminal,
[00:25:10.294 --> 00:25:15.818]  Went into the Oklahoma City area after the bombing and said, we'll deliver all the mail from the post office to the families.
[00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:22.142]  Because people would see a widow or somebody who'd lost their children and they would write them ten, twenty thousand dollar checks.
[00:25:23.302 --> 00:25:30.607]  And the Red Cross was caught, and convicted, and civilly had to settle for actually signing over checks for themselves.
[00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:33.549]  And this was done on an industrial scale.
[00:25:33.849 --> 00:25:35.450]  It wasn't like a few employees did this.
[00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.592]  The Red Cross is flagrantly criminal.
[00:25:40.012 --> 00:25:41.272]  And they were convicted of that.
[00:25:41.653 --> 00:25:43.053]  And they stole millions of dollars.
[00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:50.796]  And then, of course, you know on 9-11, I got on air, the day after 9-11, and I said, don't give money to the Red Cross or the United Way.
[00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.296]  They steal the money.
[00:25:53.176 --> 00:25:58.798]  I said, give it to other charities that actually are just taking food or medicine or clothes.
[00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:01.959]  And you can do searches on them online.
[00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:03.040]  You can do research on them.
[00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:08.725]  The bad charities have all been caught and engaged in corruption many times.
[00:26:08.765 --> 00:26:10.326]  There are a lot of good charities.
[00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:17.991]  And so we said, send breathing apparatus so the rescue workers don't breathe the asbestos.
[00:26:18.851 --> 00:26:28.978]  And we did get, just this show alone, hundreds of those mailed to a nearby church that was giving breathing apparatus to the firemen and others.
[00:26:30.063 --> 00:26:34.504]  Even though the government said that it was nutritious debris they were breathing, we knew it wasn't.
[00:26:35.784 --> 00:26:43.946]  And so it may feel good to you, it may be easy, because the media all points the way towards the Red Cross to give money to them.
[00:26:44.366 --> 00:26:49.207]  But we also talked about how they've been caught giving money to gun control groups, as well as the United Way.
[00:26:49.767 --> 00:26:51.687]  And sure enough, it became a big scandal.
[00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:54.888]  Tens of millions of dollars given to gun control groups.
[00:26:56.869 --> 00:26:59.069]  And other socialistic organizations.
[00:26:59.873 --> 00:27:00.453]  And movements.
[00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:03.074]  And I actually got some heat for that.
[00:27:03.614 --> 00:27:07.475]  Of course, I was totally exonerated as it became a national scandal.
[00:27:08.415 --> 00:27:17.298]  But you've got to ask yourself, why are almost all the mainstream media outlets promoting predominantly, if not exclusively, the Red Cross and the United Way and others?
[00:27:18.478 --> 00:27:20.158]  Why aren't they promoting local charities?
[00:27:20.178 --> 00:27:21.979]  Why aren't they promoting charities around the country?
[00:27:22.199 --> 00:27:26.080]  I know the Austin Food Bank is saying, give us canned food and we're going to deliver it.
[00:27:27.378 --> 00:27:29.079]  They have no history of running scams.
[00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:32.180]  You really can't run a scam just gathering the food.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.000]  They're going to bring it there.
[00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:37.362]  You need to give it to the local food banks that are getting trucks ready to drive it in.
[00:27:38.182 --> 00:27:39.583]  And the government's got plenty of food.
[00:27:39.623 --> 00:27:41.264]  FEMA's got whole warehouses full of it.
[00:27:41.884 --> 00:27:43.185]  They've got the troops to deliver it.
[00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:45.766]  I mean, I'm not saying that you shouldn't give.
[00:27:45.786 --> 00:27:46.606]  That'll certainly help.
[00:27:47.487 --> 00:27:57.217]  But if too much gets given, it'll actually cause a problem and pile up and take most of the rescue workers' time and energy up controlling it.
[00:27:57.397 --> 00:27:58.938]  And that's happened in past disasters.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.582]  But meanwhile, a couple shots get fired.
[00:28:02.602 --> 00:28:09.148]  Excuse me, one shot gets fired outside of the dome, and so the police and the military fall back.
[00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:09.849]  Oh no!
[00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:11.090]  Someone shot at us!
[00:28:13.297 --> 00:28:20.023]  But, again, the big question is, why on earth is the media promoting the Red Cross?
[00:28:20.063 --> 00:28:25.829]  I mean, folks, they are a criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.
[00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:34.777]  Remember they were all over national TV, give us money, don't give us food, don't give us, give us money, and we're going to give every red cent of it to the victims and their families.
[00:28:36.534 --> 00:28:41.775]  And then over half the money, they kept it and said, we've decided not to.
[00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:43.435]  The $3 billion, we're going to keep it.
[00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:48.496]  And then meanwhile, they're back on TV saying they're broke.
[00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:51.197]  They don't have any money.
[00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.597]  They need you to send them money.
[00:28:53.637 --> 00:28:57.798]  Well, folks, you might as well give your money to Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:28:58.758 --> 00:29:02.359]  I mean, you might as well give your money to George Bush.
[00:29:03.357 --> 00:29:04.558]  It's like Bush Sr.
[00:29:04.598 --> 00:29:07.679]  and Clinton running over there and divvying up the money there.
[00:29:07.699 --> 00:29:10.660]  And even those governments that got hit by the tsunami said, we're not getting anything.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.041]  Their own aid agencies are just keeping it.
[00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:20.364]  I mean, they've caught United Way, I don't know, like ten times that I've heard of over the last few decades that I've been watching them.
[00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:25.486]  And I mean, they just... The director of United Way was caught stealing $35 million.
[00:29:26.087 --> 00:29:28.408]  The director of United Way was caught stealing $5 million again.
[00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:29.348]  Well, no big deal.
[00:29:31.357 --> 00:29:35.058]  Don't give a red cent to them or it's going to Handgun Control Incorporated!
[00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:37.799]  And if you want to get mad at me about that, fine!
[00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:41.320]  Of course, you won't now, because you... Everybody knows about it.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.741]  Or do you know about it?
[00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.441]  I mean, it's public knowledge!
[00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:46.502]  They're criminals!
[00:29:46.682 --> 00:29:47.782]  Do not give them money!
[00:29:48.923 --> 00:29:49.923]  Come back and take your calls.
[00:29:49.943 --> 00:29:50.723]  Got a guest coming up, too.
[00:29:51.764 --> 00:29:52.684]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.144 --> 00:29:54.745]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.645 --> 00:29:58.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.348 --> 00:30:08.075]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:08.095 --> 00:30:10.899]  Store prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[00:30:11.159 --> 00:30:11.960]  Featuring the Ms.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.190]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for health, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.972]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[00:30:24.992 --> 00:30:26.132]  See a fashion show.
[00:30:26.392 --> 00:30:28.973]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Man.
[00:30:29.213 --> 00:30:30.794]  There's something new every hour.
[00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:34.355]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:38.456]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[00:30:38.757 --> 00:30:41.598]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[00:30:43.018 --> 00:30:48.180]  For discount tickets visit 101expos.com or call 612-798-7256.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:56.482]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[00:30:56.762 --> 00:30:59.883]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[00:31:01.585 --> 00:31:07.826]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.946 --> 00:31:14.107]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:22.829]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:30.090]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:35.233]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:40.857]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.197 --> 00:31:44.279]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.585]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:53.185]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.433 --> 00:32:10.298]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.558 --> 00:32:12.920]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:15.142]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.462 --> 00:32:20.827]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.207 --> 00:32:25.489]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:33.833]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:32:34.013 --> 00:32:39.056]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[00:32:39.096 --> 00:32:41.097]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:32:41.617 --> 00:32:44.758]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:47.460]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.060]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:54.042]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:54.263 --> 00:32:56.604]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:57.204]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:10.986]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:33:11.547 --> 00:33:14.208]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:17.210]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.152]  Alright, coming up here in a few minutes, I'm going to be talking to Scott Stevens.
[00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:24.575]  And of course his website is weatherwars.info.
[00:33:25.215 --> 00:33:26.816]  And he, you know, he's an acting, um,
[00:33:27.995 --> 00:33:29.456]  He works at many different TV stations.
[00:33:29.496 --> 00:33:36.243]  He is an active nightly weatherman and meteorologist for a major TV station.
[00:33:36.323 --> 00:33:41.088]  And of course he's been on Coast to Coast AM and many other radio shows around the country.
[00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:48.415]  And just looking at the weather patterns and looking at the different evidence, he's convinced that there
[00:33:49.122 --> 00:33:49.782]  We're good to go.
[00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:16.717]  Others, terrorists, are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism, whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes, remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[00:34:17.317 --> 00:34:30.004]  So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations, and it's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify
[00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:47.969]  Our counter-terrorism efforts, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, April 1997, counter-terrorism conference, sponsored by former Senator Sam Nunn, quoted from the DOD news briefing, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, at a conference on terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and the U.S.
[00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:49.030]  strategy, U.S.
[00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:53.051]  of, University of Georgia, Athens, and that was April 28, 1997.
[00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:54.051]  Then I have a bill here, of course,
[00:34:58.261 --> 00:35:03.204]  2977 introduced, dealing with electromagnetic weather weapons, tectonic weapons.
[00:35:03.224 --> 00:35:05.265]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:35:05.665 --> 00:35:06.946]  They use these in Vietnam.
[00:35:06.966 --> 00:35:08.147]  I mean, it's on the Weather Channel.
[00:35:09.247 --> 00:35:16.171]  And I'm not saying the hurricane was caused by the Martians or the Ruskies or the Easter Bunny or our own government.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.342]  But it is an important topic.
[00:35:19.402 --> 00:35:20.743]  It is a real technology.
[00:35:21.143 --> 00:35:22.084]  It has to be looked at.
[00:35:22.144 --> 00:35:34.252]  What I do know is, while everything else got bloated and doubled in size, the government systematically in the last four years slashed the funding for flood control around New Orleans.
[00:35:35.292 --> 00:35:39.315]  Not to other areas of the country.
[00:35:39.355 --> 00:35:45.079]  The main cuts were there, despite the fact that the meteorologists, the hydrographers, and others said
[00:35:46.189 --> 00:35:52.955]  If there was a direct hit, the actual headline is, 500,000 could die, and that is, of course, the Houston Chronicle last year.
[00:35:53.615 --> 00:35:59.981]  So FEMA was saying it was in the top three of most dangerous disasters that could take place.
[00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.062]  They said that two years ago.
[00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:05.085]  In the top three of the most looming disasters just waiting.
[00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:06.386]  And so what's the answer?
[00:36:06.406 --> 00:36:09.348]  150 million bucks, they could have made that impregnable.
[00:36:09.769 --> 00:36:10.650]  They just didn't do it.
[00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:13.412]  I mean, this is insane, folks.
[00:36:14.324 --> 00:36:16.084]  And it's very, very suspicious.
[00:36:17.085 --> 00:36:20.905]  And now, we're talking six bucks a gallon in some areas of the country.
[00:36:21.366 --> 00:36:22.546]  It could go up even higher.
[00:36:22.586 --> 00:36:25.486]  The national average they're talking about could be six bucks a gallon.
[00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:28.207]  And it's just more of the same.
[00:36:28.227 --> 00:36:30.267]  There's always an excuse, always a reason.
[00:36:30.928 --> 00:36:34.228]  By the way, there was that show, what was it, Oil Storm?
[00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:38.969]  Oil Storm that aired a few months ago on TV were the exact same scenario.
[00:36:39.269 --> 00:36:41.830]  A hurricane hits, disrupts things, there's a depression.
[00:36:43.815 --> 00:36:46.820]  In fact, Scott, do you have that Oil Storm clip?
[00:36:48.262 --> 00:36:49.324]  We're about to bring our guest up.
[00:36:49.344 --> 00:36:51.107]  We'll get to the crawlers here in just a few minutes.
[00:36:51.127 --> 00:36:54.773]  I'm going to go ahead and go to the guest, but first let's play this Oil Storm piece.
[00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:55.234]  Here it is.
[00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:58.099]  It has already begun.
[00:36:59.199 --> 00:36:59.679]  Collided.
[00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:03.101]  Hundreds are feared dead with emergency services unable to call.
[00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.161]  A chain of events.
[00:37:04.241 --> 00:37:06.162]  Million barrels of oil gone.
[00:37:06.322 --> 00:37:07.443]  That will spark fear.
[00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:09.203]  A killer blow to the economy.
[00:37:09.304 --> 00:37:14.606]  Create panic and result in a catastrophe that will change our lives forever.
[00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:18.187]  Americans didn't realize how fragile their existence was.
[00:37:18.227 --> 00:37:19.068]  Oil Storm.
[00:37:19.388 --> 00:37:20.889]  An FX original event.
[00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:22.329]  Sunday June 5th.
[00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.111]  America's lifeline has been severed.
[00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:30.054]  And again, this creates all this psychological fear that's going to happen.
[00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:39.502]  Remember when the lone gunman, the pilot of the X-Files, a few months before 9-11, the government runs a drill to make the rest of the government stand down.
[00:37:41.123 --> 00:37:46.228]  Again, exactly as happened on 9-11, they're going to fly a jet into the World Trade Center,
[00:37:47.256 --> 00:37:50.619]  To create martial law on a pretext to invade Afghanistan.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.382]  And he asked, well, how's the government going to stand down?
[00:37:54.923 --> 00:37:57.064]  Well, they're going to think it's part of the drill.
[00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:59.326]  But those running the drill are the terrorists.
[00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:02.449]  And we'll just blame some Arab Nazis.
[00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:04.150]  And then that exactly happens.
[00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:13.038]  And I didn't see Oil Storm, but reading the synopsis on the FX website, it's a hurricane stops the oil, makes some ships wreck, and then everything starts breaking down.
[00:38:13.238 --> 00:38:15.320]  And folks, that's just not true.
[00:38:16.952 --> 00:38:25.314]  What you've got is a bunch of people gouging at the pumps, and the oil companies gouging, and they've got the petroleum reserves.
[00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:35.717]  You do have a lot of these boutique oils, boutique oils, boutique oils, these little special gasolines that have to be made for each region of the country.
[00:38:35.737 --> 00:38:36.877]  It does nothing for the environment.
[00:38:37.117 --> 00:38:38.278]  That is causing a problem.
[00:38:38.298 --> 00:38:41.898]  But the oil companies have not built new refineries on purpose.
[00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:43.719]  They want to create artificial scarcity.
[00:38:44.478 --> 00:38:46.299]  And, uh, we're going to our guest in just a second.
[00:38:46.319 --> 00:38:48.460]  There's just so much, so much news here.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.141]  More Navy ships are headed to the Gulf Coast, including aircraft carriers.
[00:38:52.502 --> 00:38:57.184]  National Guard doubling its deployment to 28,000 troops.
[00:38:58.044 --> 00:39:03.766]  And at the same time, Superdome evacuation suspended because of fires and gunshots.
[00:39:03.846 --> 00:39:06.287]  More National Guardsmen are sent in.
[00:39:06.327 --> 00:39:07.348]  This is out of the Associated
[00:39:07.995 --> 00:39:14.699]  Press, and then somebody shot a gun, fired their firearm near the dome, so they're pulling back the rescue.
[00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:17.861]  Since when do we stop rescues because somebody is shooting?
[00:39:20.203 --> 00:39:22.144]  Isn't that what they're paid to do, is get shot at?
[00:39:22.184 --> 00:39:31.350]  I mean, it's a bad thing they're getting shot at, but... Mired in misery, death and disease, thousands fear killed, water fetid.
[00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:43.567]  And nowhere on the national news, because they're talking about more hurricanes coming now, do all these doctors and experts tell their people, if you're in a coastal area that's ravaged by hurricanes, better get a water filter.
[00:39:43.927 --> 00:39:52.894]  They have little portable filters that are easy to carry, the size of a sports bottle, and yeah, we sponsor them and push them here, that would protect all these people.
[00:39:52.914 --> 00:39:58.137]  But instead, this is like escape from New York or something.
[00:39:58.177 --> 00:39:59.018]  I mean, this is just...
[00:40:00.323 --> 00:40:02.125]  This is just totally out of control.
[00:40:02.185 --> 00:40:08.831]  Meanwhile, Fats Domino, who found his thrill on Blueberry Hill, who I'm a fan of, is missing since Monday.
[00:40:09.992 --> 00:40:13.695]  Elderly Fats Domino, no one can say that they didn't see it coming.
[00:40:13.755 --> 00:40:19.400]  Salon is now reporting on what we reported on days ago, that Bush did specifically block the funding.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.984]  NBC is sending in armed guards to Lawless Gulf Coast.
[00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:29.802]  NBC is sending in armed guards to protect their reporters.
[00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:31.943]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:40:32.903 --> 00:40:40.225]  Alright, I am honored to be joined by meteorologist and obviously expert on the weather, Scott Stevens.
[00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:43.045]  And he has a website, weatherwars.com.
[00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:45.926]  We have a link to it on infowars.com.
[00:40:46.586 --> 00:40:49.227]  Scott, thank you for coming on with us today.
[00:40:49.507 --> 00:40:50.387]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[00:40:50.807 --> 00:40:53.028]  There's a lot to talk about, as you've alluded to.
[00:40:53.854 --> 00:40:54.815]  Well, there certainly is.
[00:40:54.835 --> 00:41:03.523]  I mean, I'm sure you heard me earlier say that I, in my guts, don't think this is some government or some terrorist.
[00:41:04.024 --> 00:41:11.010]  You may disagree, but I just read Secretary of Defense Cohen talking about what a real threat this was.
[00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.572]  I mean, this is an old technology.
[00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:18.017]  At the 60 year anniversary of World War II, the Russians cleared the stormy skies.
[00:41:18.732 --> 00:41:48.181]  A few months ago, and that was Associated Press, this is a real technology, but first off, tell us about yourself, how you learned about it, what you think's going on, do you think somebody's involved with strengthening this hurricane, or directing it, or... Well, initially I began to become interested in these topics by just reading alternative news sites, and I kept coming up with weather modification, weather altering technologies, and terms that, like scalar, and longitudinally, and waves, and
[00:41:49.525 --> 00:41:55.968]  At EM Burst and so forth, these are not topics that were discussed or taught when we go to classical school.
[00:41:56.008 --> 00:41:57.229]  It just is not there.
[00:41:58.049 --> 00:42:04.312]  The atmosphere is driven by heat from the sun, which then results in convective clouds and the movement of the jet stream and so forth.
[00:42:04.472 --> 00:42:08.054]  All of that stuff we regurgitate daily on the news.
[00:42:08.694 --> 00:42:16.637]  What began to catch my interest was the application or how electricity plays a role within the atmosphere.
[00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:45.218]  I came across some research on a retired Air Force Colonel, Tom Bearden's site, and indeed his staff eventually briefed Reagan's NSA staff in the mid-1980s on a whole slew of observational events that were happening across Siberia, massive chimneys dumping heat into the atmosphere, glowing domes, cold explosions that mimicked nuclear weapons, glowing plasma balls, all of these things
[00:42:46.383 --> 00:42:50.525]  Our current intelligence community did not know how to categorize what were they.
[00:42:51.386 --> 00:42:57.488]  And Bearden's staff presented to Reagan a cohesive theory about what was going on.
[00:42:57.788 --> 00:43:03.271]  And that needed to basically rewrite our physics that we teach in Western schools.
[00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.512]  It needed to redo laws of thermodynamics.
[00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:10.414]  We had access to quantum potential or energy from space-time.
[00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:16.733]  And that these weapons were the subject of what the Soviets called their Energetics Program.
[00:43:16.893 --> 00:43:21.616]  And that received funding equal to seven of our Manhattan Projects.
[00:43:22.196 --> 00:43:30.161]  And that research began in the middle 40s and continued up until initial deployment in the 60s and continued to be perfected until this day.
[00:43:31.001 --> 00:43:36.865]  And that enables them to basically take down ICBMs or fry their electronics at great distances.
[00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:48.834]  Well, they admit that that's what our harp is for, is seeing over the horizon radar, but I mean, you don't think just the Soviets were developing this, do you?
[00:43:48.854 --> 00:43:50.435]  I mean, certainly our government developed it.
[00:43:50.575 --> 00:43:51.115]  Exactly.
[00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.356]  But we were behind the curve.
[00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:53.997]  Decidedly behind the curve.
[00:43:54.037 --> 00:43:55.558]  And after the earthquake wars of the 80s,
[00:43:56.468 --> 00:44:03.190]  Then they certainly got shaken up and decided we need, this is a valid area of research that we're behind.
[00:44:03.731 --> 00:44:06.492]  Now you just said earthquake wars of the eighties.
[00:44:06.912 --> 00:44:10.693]  I mean do you think that the big earthquake in Iran last year was a government op or?
[00:44:11.353 --> 00:44:12.714]  Oh the BAM Iran quake?
[00:44:13.094 --> 00:44:13.354]  Yes.
[00:44:14.514 --> 00:44:24.518]  Well let's just say the coincidence between the timing of that quake on 26 December and then the Banda Aceh tsunami also on 26 December does
[00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:27.984]  Bring, let's just say, you have to question.
[00:44:28.244 --> 00:44:41.753]  Well, I mean, I have the Australian newspapers, mainstream, saying that in the 1940s our government was developing tsunami bombs, that they would detonate on the ocean floor and cause tsunamis, so, but I mean... But that's conventional weaponry.
[00:44:42.093 --> 00:44:47.436]  Exactly, so... What this does is amplify the energy going into the system.
[00:44:49.392 --> 00:44:58.202]  A megawatt, and you can amplify that by one, two, three orders of magnitude when you have this wave interference amplified as you cross these antennas.
[00:44:58.923 --> 00:45:04.590]  As we know, you can take two wave signals and have them either cancel each other out or amplify them.
[00:45:05.163 --> 00:45:12.705]  And if you have multiple antennas depositing energy in a specific location for a set amount of time, you're going to get some kind of response.
[00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:19.766]  You're going to heat the crust, it'll slip, it'll be jarred, depending on how you pulse that portion of the Earth's crust.
[00:45:20.327 --> 00:45:22.047]  Or you can do the same with the atmosphere.
[00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.428]  What happens when a parcel of the atmosphere is heated?
[00:45:25.008 --> 00:45:30.269]  It expands, and that thereby exerts pressure on the nearby parcels of the atmosphere.
[00:45:30.825 --> 00:45:40.230]  And if you then overlay the entire Earth's atmosphere with this grid and selectively heat and cool to your design, you can manufacture weather.
[00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:45.533]  And this began with the initiation of the Woodpecker Grid by Centennial Weekend 1976.
[00:45:47.273 --> 00:45:50.037]  That puts it 29 years in operation.
[00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:52.540]  For those who don't know, tell them what the Woodpecker Grid is.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:46:02.112]  The Woodpecker Grid began to be heard by ham radio operators and those doing surveillance in that portion of the EM spectrum just as pulsing.
[00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:06.503]  It was constant, beginning on Bicentennial Weekend.
[00:46:06.843 --> 00:46:11.446]  And there were two great uproar across the scientists around the world, but the pulsing never stopped.
[00:46:11.466 --> 00:46:14.168]  What they did do is then add spread spectrum.
[00:46:14.328 --> 00:46:22.853]  So it begins to shift frequency a little bit, but still that pulsing is there and is readily hearable from 3 to about 30 megahertz on a shortwave frequency.
[00:46:23.554 --> 00:46:30.758]  And then that energy establishes standing waves, or this reservoir of energy contained within the planet herself.
[00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:39.416]  And then we use pulses above the planet to then draw that energy up and then enhance local effects.
[00:46:39.816 --> 00:46:44.039]  So basically it energizes the planet and then they can steer and manipulate it.
[00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:44.679]  Exactly.
[00:46:45.079 --> 00:46:49.142]  I mean it's incredibly complex and far above the science of the average American.
[00:46:49.742 --> 00:46:51.803]  Truly far above the science that we're taught.
[00:46:51.863 --> 00:46:56.286]  But I mean the Russians can openly, and so can our own government, wheel out antennas and clear the sky.
[00:46:56.326 --> 00:46:58.307]  They do that on national TV.
[00:46:58.547 --> 00:46:59.628]  Is that a similar system?
[00:46:59.828 --> 00:47:00.148]  Similar.
[00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.889]  Similar.
[00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:03.951]  But not nearly as precise, and not nearly as well-tuned.
[00:47:04.191 --> 00:47:10.034]  So I mean, one of these antenna trucks, with the electricity going into the atmosphere, how do they clear the sky?
[00:47:10.815 --> 00:47:12.616]  By changing the ionization.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.621]  You change how the water molecules can hold together.
[00:47:16.641 --> 00:47:20.702]  They can remain bonded to create that updraft and hence the cloud.
[00:47:21.263 --> 00:47:24.003]  And I've got a couple of pages on my side called Holes.
[00:47:24.323 --> 00:47:34.387]  And you can clearly see these holes as visible from many of the readers who have sent in these phenomena where there's just a cloud deck and it's simply there's a hole punched out.
[00:47:34.767 --> 00:47:38.688]  And then often there's a plane flying through because these guys are curious about these
[00:47:39.308 --> 00:47:44.812]  Well, I mean, here's a basic question for the average person.
[00:47:45.072 --> 00:47:52.697]  Seven, eight years ago, my whole life before that, a jet would fly over, it'd leave a trail, it'd disappear in five seconds to a minute.
[00:47:53.157 --> 00:48:01.462]  Now, a plane flies over at 4,000 feet, where you're not even supposed to have condensation trails, it's the middle of summer, it's hot, and the trail is there three hours later.
[00:48:01.943 --> 00:48:02.823]  What changed?
[00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:03.764]  What has changed?
[00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:06.526]  What changed is that those are not natural contrails.
[00:48:06.586 --> 00:48:08.267]  Those are not commercial flights.
[00:48:08.897 --> 00:48:22.951]  By any stretch of the imagination, there is a secondary fleet of planes painting the sky with barium and aluminum, which conduct electricity, or absorb moisture, or and absorb moisture, and they're painting the sky looking for these electromagnetic signatures.
[00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:23.932]  They're looking for drift,
[00:48:24.477 --> 00:48:28.698]  Dispersion, ionization, moisture content, and ultimately targeting.
[00:48:28.718 --> 00:48:36.161]  So basically what you're saying is our government's trying to fight this and trying to learn what it is, and it's the Russians doing it.
[00:48:36.421 --> 00:48:37.461]  And hence the contrails.
[00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:43.003]  Yep, they're surveying the sky, looking for this activity in action.
[00:48:43.423 --> 00:48:46.906]  So that they can understand and do short-term forecasting.
[00:48:47.187 --> 00:48:50.270]  And that data is not getting into the public's domain.
[00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.492]  It is not getting into our public forecast models.
[00:48:52.552 --> 00:48:55.835]  And that's why... Well, you know, I talk to some pilots and they go, yeah, it's crazy.
[00:48:55.855 --> 00:48:57.216]  These trails do sit there for hours.
[00:48:57.276 --> 00:49:01.100]  But how can I, like, be doing work in the yard and literally...
[00:49:01.952 --> 00:49:06.637]  The sky is clear and then later it's totally full of trails and literally, folks, I videotaped it.
[00:49:06.917 --> 00:49:08.178]  They sit there for hours.
[00:49:08.418 --> 00:49:09.039]  Ice crystals.
[00:49:09.459 --> 00:49:10.160]  Never did that.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.641]  Something did change.
[00:49:12.022 --> 00:49:15.024]  Something changed and the atmosphere is constantly seeded.
[00:49:15.104 --> 00:49:16.546]  So you'll see these sun dogs.
[00:49:16.606 --> 00:49:18.588]  You'll see these rainbows around the sun.
[00:49:19.068 --> 00:49:23.570]  Because, I mean, these phenomena used to be more generally restricted to the colder seasons.
[00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:26.110]  And now it's 12 months of the year.
[00:49:26.491 --> 00:49:32.733]  And it truly doesn't matter whether you're in the Philippines or at the North Pole, you're going to see this constant feeding of the atmosphere.
[00:49:32.773 --> 00:49:36.574]  But Bush says that Pootie Poot is our friend and wouldn't want to hurt us.
[00:49:36.734 --> 00:49:37.714]  And you believe what he says?
[00:49:37.734 --> 00:49:38.875]  I do.
[00:49:38.915 --> 00:49:40.895]  I think the President never lies.
[00:49:40.915 --> 00:49:43.276]  Hey, I'm with you there, buddy.
[00:49:43.796 --> 00:49:44.437]  I'm with you there.
[00:49:44.557 --> 00:49:45.477]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:49:47.138 --> 00:49:48.318]  No, it was just dripping.
[00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:55.501]  Yeah, the problem is that there's so little integrity coming out of Washington on so many topics.
[00:49:55.962 --> 00:49:57.763]  There just is no integrity.
[00:49:58.223 --> 00:50:05.707]  And they'll trot out people to say, no, this doesn't happen, but all you have to do is sit in your backyard or your front yard and watch the skies for a short time.
[00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:10.147]  Hurricane Katrina with you.
[00:50:10.367 --> 00:50:10.807]  We'll get there.
[00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:24.157]  And when we get back, because I haven't, you know, I don't conduct pre-interviews, so I don't know what your view on this is, but I want to find out if you think it could be created, it could be steered, it could be controlled.
[00:50:24.217 --> 00:50:34.424]  Some of the scientists I've talked to on and off record think they can't control things, they can make things, but they can't completely steer them like you would steer a Volkswagen bug.
[00:50:34.444 --> 00:50:37.326]  Ask the people in Biloxi about that last-minute dodge.
[00:50:37.825 --> 00:50:39.486]  Do what they say.
[00:50:39.626 --> 00:50:44.450]  Alright, well, we'll be right back and we'll talk about the hurricane.
[00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:47.312]  But I mean, I got the Secretary of Defense talking about it.
[00:50:47.332 --> 00:50:49.374]  I got legislation talking about it.
[00:50:49.414 --> 00:50:51.796]  I've got Discovery Channel shows.
[00:50:51.856 --> 00:50:53.697]  I've got shows on the Weather Channel.
[00:50:53.757 --> 00:50:56.039]  I mean, weather control is real.
[00:50:56.139 --> 00:50:57.740]  It's just, who's in control?
[00:51:02.705 --> 00:51:05.568]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:07.390]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:12.416]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.756 --> 00:51:17.181]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:21.766]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.986 --> 00:51:24.847]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.927 --> 00:51:29.589]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:34.210]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:41.652]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.913 --> 00:51:44.333]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:54:20.734 --> 00:54:28.420]  But before we go back to our guest, I have made 12 full-length feature documentary films.
[00:54:29.648 --> 00:54:44.643]  I have also written a book, published another book, and I carry a bunch of other wonderful videos and books on our online bookstore at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and these are great books, great videos, the best stuff out there, bar none.
[00:54:44.663 --> 00:54:45.844]  That's what we carry.
[00:54:46.704 --> 00:54:52.447]  And at the same time, your purchase also makes this broadcast possible, and the websites possible, and our work possible.
[00:54:52.467 --> 00:54:57.410]  So I want to thank those that have gotten the films, and I want to encourage those that haven't gotten the videos to get them.
[00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:02.493]  I authorize you, for non-profit educational purposes, to make copies of my videos.
[00:55:03.874 --> 00:55:07.015]  It is so important to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:55:07.716 --> 00:55:15.300]  How governments carry out terror attacks and crises to then have the people rallying around them as their saviors and give up their liberties.
[00:55:16.383 --> 00:55:24.545]  A lot of big discounts that we're running right now, and we're very soon going to change these discounts for some new discounts.
[00:55:25.266 --> 00:55:27.846]  They'll be as good as these discounts, but different.
[00:55:28.287 --> 00:55:31.928]  So be sure and take advantage of the sales we've got going on right now.

[00:55:40.642 --> 00:55:46.486]  Or whether it's my book, Descent into Tyranny, or JPFO's Innocence Betrayed, their excellent Second Amendment video.
[00:55:46.966 --> 00:55:49.928]  These are all very, very, very important.
[00:55:50.648 --> 00:55:51.649]  And you need to have them.
[00:55:51.669 --> 00:55:54.691]  We're also carrying some new videos and books, so be sure and check it out.

[00:56:24.143 --> 00:56:26.325]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:26.725 --> 00:56:32.609]  Going back to Meteorologist, worked for many major TV stations, worked for a major TV station.
[00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.851]  Right now, he of course has
[00:56:37.788 --> 00:56:38.989]  We're good to go.
[00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:54.643]  This is real, this is happening, and he may disagree with me.
[00:56:54.723 --> 00:56:56.124]  We're going to find out right now.
[00:56:56.745 --> 00:57:08.633]  So you think the evidence points towards, or you don't think the evidence points towards, some type of governmental manipulation or institutional manipulation of the hurricane?
[00:57:09.213 --> 00:57:11.734]  I think the institutional manipulation is a good way of putting it.
[00:57:12.294 --> 00:57:13.174]  I really do.
[00:57:13.534 --> 00:57:30.637]  We know that the technology is most advanced, that the ones that the Soviets developed through the 70s and 80s, and then as the collapse of the Soviet Union financially occurred in the late 80s, then they had this incredible tool that they simply leased out to the highest bidder for gold bullion.
[00:57:31.177 --> 00:57:34.478]  And that happened in the late 80s and early 90s and continues to be leased by
[00:57:35.228 --> 00:57:47.033]  The Japanese Mafia with the stated goal because they're the remnants of the samurai and who are really annoyed about how we westernized Japan and how we humiliated them.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.741]  And nuked them at the end of World War II.
[00:57:49.761 --> 00:57:56.504]  Now, now, now, again, we know weather control's real, we know this stuff's going on, but you're not saying our own government could be doing anything.
[00:57:56.944 --> 00:57:59.325]  It's not the Russians, it's the Japanese Mafia.
[00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:05.068]  They have, they at least have set up a school to teach scientists how to use this technology.
[00:58:05.388 --> 00:58:07.929]  Now, the question is... Now, now, wait, where did you learn of this?
[00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:10.310]  We're about to break, and we'll come back and talk about it, but I mean, where did you learn of this?
[00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.831]  This is Colonel Burden's intelligence.
[00:58:12.668 --> 00:58:13.748]  That's where this has come from.
[00:58:13.808 --> 00:58:18.710]  But the problem is identifying who is actually controlling it from day to day to day.
[00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.370]  Well, I mean, where are the nodes?
[00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:24.291]  I mean, can they, from antenna arrays in Japan, make a hurricane pop up?
[00:58:24.451 --> 00:58:25.252]  Or in Siberia?
[00:58:25.292 --> 00:58:26.492]  You betcha.
[00:58:26.572 --> 00:58:28.293]  It doesn't matter where you are on this planet.
[00:58:28.333 --> 00:58:29.033]  It's possible.
[00:58:29.053 --> 00:58:30.413]  It's possible.
[00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:33.394]  Well, I mean, I know other controls are real.
[00:58:33.474 --> 00:58:36.675]  I just don't know if it's this advance or if the Japanese Mafia is doing it.
[00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:38.315]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:38.355 --> 00:58:40.076]  We'll talk about it with the meteorologists.
[00:58:41.508 --> 00:58:46.601]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.779 --> 00:59:02.002]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:03.422]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.203 --> 00:59:05.083]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.744 --> 00:59:09.546]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.926 --> 00:59:14.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:19.552]  We're talking to a meteorologist, TV weatherman,
[00:59:20.632 --> 00:59:23.013]  Very interesting individual, Scott Stephens.
[00:59:23.554 --> 00:59:26.596]  I certainly agree with him that weather modification and control is real.
[00:59:26.656 --> 00:59:28.397]  I mean, Secretary of Defense Cohen admits it.
[00:59:28.797 --> 00:59:29.877]  Legislation admits it.
[00:59:29.898 --> 00:59:31.078]  The Weather Channel admits it.
[00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:35.721]  But they limit how powerful it is and what it can actually do.
[00:59:38.385 --> 00:59:46.449]  Again, I'm no scientist, but some scientists out there say that you could take an existing tropical depression and turn it into a hurricane with these systems.
[00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.310]  Even with cloud seeding, you can do that.
[00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:52.171]  You know, 50, 60 year old technology, but can you steer it?
[00:59:52.231 --> 00:59:53.232]  Can you manipulate it?
[00:59:54.292 --> 00:59:58.813]  So I'm sold on ground antennas charging the atmosphere.
[00:59:58.893 --> 00:59:59.553]  They admit that.
[00:59:59.593 --> 01:00:02.214]  I'm sold on cloud spraying and seeding.
[01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:05.314]  But am I sold on global mafias?
[01:00:06.154 --> 01:00:07.635]  The New World Order is a global mafia.
[01:00:07.655 --> 01:00:08.695]  It's just not Japanese.
[01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:13.556]  Scott, we've got a few minutes here before we break.
[01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.776]  We've come back with a long segment.
[01:00:14.796 --> 01:00:15.516]  Plenty of time to talk.
[01:00:15.536 --> 01:00:16.616]  I want to take some calls then.
[01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:19.817]  Specifically, what are the indicators
[01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:25.601]  Uh, you know, with this new type of weather, looking at Katrina, that made you think it was being manipulated.
[01:00:25.882 --> 01:00:26.782]  The tops of the clouds.
[01:00:26.962 --> 01:00:36.028]  Looking at the higher resolution satellite imagery, there is simply unmistakable geometry that would not be there under fully natural circumstances.
[01:00:36.609 --> 01:00:38.130]  Squares tipped on sides.
[01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:45.535]  Grills, where you see a rack of lines bounded by other straight lines perpendicular to these lines.
[01:00:46.215 --> 01:00:51.179]  Simply stars, pentagonal stars showing up in one portion of the outer band.
[01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:58.204]  The geometry is what gives it away, and it's this geometry we find in the formation of just your everyday cumulus cloud
[01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:05.725]  That you turn up the intensity on this electrical geometry that happens around the planet and you juice these storms.
[01:01:06.105 --> 01:01:07.606]  Why does it manifest?
[01:01:07.766 --> 01:01:11.107]  Because I've seen the photos with the lines and the symbols and stuff around it.
[01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:12.948]  Why does it manifest?
[01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:25.452]  That's a really good question because then what we find or what we're beginning to suppose is that we're resting our visible universe on the next dimension.
[01:01:26.258 --> 01:01:32.403]  And it's that dimension that begins to give us these unusual shapes, these harmonies found within nature.
[01:01:32.864 --> 01:01:38.828]  And that's where the energy comes from, is from space-time, from that quantum vacuum, that quantum realm.
[01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:44.013]  And that's the extra energy is just drawn through that realm to enhance what is there.
[01:01:44.093 --> 01:01:49.277]  Now, see, I've seen the science where, you know, they wheel out some trucks and charge the atmosphere and drive clouds back.
[01:01:49.297 --> 01:01:55.022]  I mean, that's admitted, but, you know, you're, I mean, you as a meteorologist are getting off into, I mean, you're getting off into
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:12.801]  But see, that's why they've been able to get away with it for so long, is because Western scientists have their heads in the sand, and don't realize that the Russians pulled boatloads of documents and scientific paper, not looking for a peer review process to boast up their own flaws,
[01:02:13.141 --> 01:02:16.263]  But to tear down the mistakes within Western science and research.
[01:02:16.323 --> 01:02:18.205]  And they found them and exploited them.
[01:02:18.565 --> 01:02:25.650]  And until science begins to get its act together, and instead of patting each other on the back, we're going to be susceptible to these issues.
[01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:27.812]  We're going to be susceptible to this technology.
[01:02:28.573 --> 01:02:34.377]  And I know our government guys have found the flaws and realized their mistakes, but they just haven't shared it publicly.
[01:02:35.026 --> 01:02:38.787]  Our government's good, it's those evil Russians and Japanese.
[01:02:38.907 --> 01:02:44.989]  I don't know that, because there should have been additional countermeasures deployed against Katrina.
[01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:50.931]  We have that capability, we have seen it with other... Well, I mean, look, forget the other dimensions.
[01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:56.233]  We know that they knew that when it got even a glancing blow, that place was going to be underwater.
[01:02:57.113 --> 01:03:00.974]  That it was going to become like Pontchartrain and they actually cut the existing funding.
[01:03:01.355 --> 01:03:02.295]  Very suspicious.
[01:03:02.355 --> 01:03:07.477]  Well, and then our Director of Homeland Security saying that they were aware this disaster was coming.
[01:03:07.697 --> 01:03:09.777]  For weeks they have been planning for this.
[01:03:10.658 --> 01:03:12.158]  That was on CNN yesterday.
[01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:13.759]  Yeah, I did see that quote.
[01:03:13.799 --> 01:03:15.499]  I mean, it's just in our face.
[01:03:15.639 --> 01:03:15.939]  It is.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.301]  And I have not... It's simply time.
[01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.121]  They know it's time for this to come out.
[01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:23.622]  And they're not going to stop it.
[01:03:24.224 --> 01:03:27.046]  No, they'll be quiet, because if they confirm it, then it's truly out.
[01:03:27.126 --> 01:03:34.470]  And if they refute it, then that adds to the debate, which then they still can't refute, because anybody can look up in the sky and see what the heck is happening.
[01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:36.831]  So it's still going to be met with stony silence.
[01:03:37.352 --> 01:03:42.655]  And it's all we're trying to do is get people to think that this is a possibility, and to do your own research.
[01:03:43.035 --> 01:03:43.435]  Okay.
[01:03:43.636 --> 01:03:46.317]  Alright, we'll come back and talk more about it and take calls on the other side.
[01:03:47.017 --> 01:03:47.578]  Stay with us.
[01:03:47.898 --> 01:03:50.820]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are my sites.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.541]  This site's WeatherWars.info.
[01:03:53.493 --> 01:03:57.819]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.019 --> 01:04:02.465]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:06.951]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.012 --> 01:04:08.353]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.135 --> 01:04:14.358]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:21.362]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.462 --> 01:04:23.564]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.844 --> 01:04:24.845]  Homeland Security.
[01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:25.825]  Executive orders.
[01:04:25.845 --> 01:04:26.886]  Force vaccination.
[01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:34.292]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.472 --> 01:04:39.837]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:56.886]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:02.069]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:08.471]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:14.394]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:06:14.634 --> 01:06:20.140]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.244]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:06:24.264 --> 01:06:29.549]  A one month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.

[01:06:57.919 --> 01:06:58.559]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.219 --> 01:07:00.280]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.101]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.761 --> 01:07:03.561]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.362]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.902 --> 01:07:09.704]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.064 --> 01:07:14.146]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.548 --> 01:07:28.391]  The number of National Guard troops is expected to double to roughly 21,000 by today from a total military force of 28,000 including active duty forces from the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
[01:07:29.872 --> 01:07:37.794]  The initial focus will be on rescue operations and bringing food and medicine before military units start working on clearing roads, supplying safe water.
[01:07:38.573 --> 01:07:41.655]  We gotta have the military bring us safe water instead of having water filters, folks.
[01:07:42.175 --> 01:07:42.976]  And other tasks.
[01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:48.159]  Guard units are expected to play a key role in restoring order in areas affected by looting.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:08:05.691]  I talked to the folks at New Millennium Concepts, our sponsor with the portable sports bottles and the big filters, and they've donated filters to the war, to the troops two years ago because they had bad water, but there's no real way to donate these because there's no way to get them into the people.
[01:08:06.408 --> 01:08:10.751]  Because they're not even really, at this point, able to get the food and water filters into them.
[01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:14.293]  Unbelievable.
[01:08:14.373 --> 01:08:15.213]  So that's going on.
[01:08:15.233 --> 01:08:21.717]  Meanwhile, they have suspended rescue operations because they're getting a few gunshots.
[01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:32.824]  And the reports are that they're not shooting at the troops or at the firefighters or police like they did, you know, in the riots in LA, but just people shooting guns off.
[01:08:32.884 --> 01:08:35.926]  And so the troops and the police have to withdraw.
[01:08:37.065 --> 01:08:39.307]  I thought that's, again, why they're cops.
[01:08:39.367 --> 01:08:40.949]  I mean, they're paid to be in danger.
[01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:47.115]  A Superdome evacuation suspended because of fires and gunshots.
[01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:50.647]  It's totally descending into anarchy.
[01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:53.048]  More National Guardsmen are sent in.
[01:08:53.068 --> 01:09:00.131]  The evacuations of the Superdome was suspended Thursday because of fires and gunshots outside the arena.
[01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:08.615]  Authorities said as National Guardsmen in armored vehicles pour into New Orleans to help restore order across the increasingly lawless and desperate city.
[01:09:08.915 --> 01:09:13.617]  Lots of video of police in black uniforms and black armored vehicles.
[01:09:13.657 --> 01:09:14.718]  Yes, that'll keep you safe.
[01:09:15.433 --> 01:09:17.815]  An additional 10,000 guardsmen again have been deployed.
[01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:22.477]  The truth is, a terrible tragedy like this brings out the best in people, brings out the worst in some people.
[01:09:22.878 --> 01:09:26.980]  To Mississippi Governor Haley Barber of NBC's Today Show.
[01:09:28.781 --> 01:09:31.723]  Good old Haley Barber, who didn't care about Bush cutting the funding.
[01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:36.526]  Again, folks, you can say what you want about what caused the hurricane or
[01:09:37.196 --> 01:09:39.998]  Why the hurricane cycle strengthening, or all this weird weather?
[01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:42.700]  What we do know is, they knew.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.901]  The FEMA had said, total devastation.
[01:09:45.462 --> 01:09:47.603]  Half a million dead, if we ever get a direct hit.
[01:09:48.964 --> 01:09:50.545]  You know, the dikes are falling apart.
[01:09:50.585 --> 01:09:52.006]  They haven't been repaired in decades.
[01:09:52.486 --> 01:09:53.987]  And the federal government cut the funding.
[01:09:54.007 --> 01:09:57.210]  And again, the Fed shouldn't be funding that in the first place.
[01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:02.013]  You know, again, I saw Chris Matthews last night say that
[01:10:02.702 --> 01:10:05.345]  People don't like the Feds.
[01:10:05.685 --> 01:10:06.807]  State's rights are dumb.
[01:10:07.247 --> 01:10:08.168]  Aren't the Feds great?
[01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:09.069]  Oh, they're so good.
[01:10:09.429 --> 01:10:11.231]  They've got the resources and the money.
[01:10:11.251 --> 01:10:16.137]  Yeah, they took a dollar from us and sent 30 cents back on average with strings attached.
[01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:21.823]  I mean, five or six big high schools cost $150 million.
[01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:25.827]  For 150 million dollars, they could have fixed all those dikes.
[01:10:25.867 --> 01:10:26.948]  They just didn't do it.
[01:10:27.268 --> 01:10:30.770]  They just couldn't believe something bad would happen when all the science showed it would.
[01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:34.172]  And I see that as a microcosm of our entire society.
[01:10:35.452 --> 01:10:37.353]  I mean, they admit cell phones give you cancer?
[01:10:37.393 --> 01:10:39.374]  I mean, yeah, it's a microwave.
[01:10:39.414 --> 01:10:41.615]  They admit sodium fluoride's really bad in the water?
[01:10:42.036 --> 01:10:44.157]  They admit that mercury's really bad in the vaccines?
[01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:44.837]  Do they stop?
[01:10:44.857 --> 01:10:47.178]  No, they increase it.
[01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:49.579]  It's genetic engineering, folks.
[01:10:49.619 --> 01:10:51.961]  They just openly... I mean, I've had the father
[01:10:53.372 --> 01:10:55.834]  of DNA, you know, recombination on.
[01:10:55.914 --> 01:11:00.578]  I've had the father of, you know, DNA protein splicing on, you know.
[01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:20.474]  I mean, I've had the heads of the fields on, and they're saying, yes, this random genetic engineering, these chimera cross-species creations could give rise to super viruses that would kill whole species, cause a total breakdown of the biosphere, or, you know, a thousand other catastrophes, and these companies are just randomly open-air doing it!
[01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:22.556]  I mean,
[01:11:23.599 --> 01:11:26.662]  It's like a self-destructive insanity.
[01:11:27.663 --> 01:11:32.707]  So I'm a thousand times more worried about all this GM splicing than I am about hurricanes.
[01:11:33.868 --> 01:11:46.919]  I mean, these hurricanes are out of control, but, uh, you know, when I said on air Tuesday, I said, you know, if I lived in New Orleans years ago and I had family there and they wouldn't fix the dikes and the levees, I would just leave.
[01:11:48.556 --> 01:11:51.498]  And I got emails going, well how dare you say they should just leave, it's their home.
[01:11:52.139 --> 01:11:59.463]  All I'm saying is, let's say I lived, let's say that the dam was having problems on Lake Austin.
[01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:02.926]  Against the big Colorado River.
[01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:04.587]  And I knew it was going to break.
[01:12:05.207 --> 01:12:08.810]  And I knew it was going to flood me and kill me and my family and they wouldn't fix it, I'd move.
[01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:13.213]  I mean it's no criticism of the people, I'm just stating the facts.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.742]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[01:12:16.182 --> 01:12:16.983]  I want to take your calls.
[01:12:17.003 --> 01:12:21.589]  We're talking to a meteorologist here who works for a major TV station, works for a lot of other stations.
[01:12:21.609 --> 01:12:25.994]  You can go to his website, weatherwars.info, for all of his info and his bio.
[01:12:26.014 --> 01:12:26.614]  Great guy.
[01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:31.100]  And I don't know if I totally agree with the intelligence of Colonel Bearden and others,
[01:12:31.812 --> 01:12:35.637]  You know, that it's some foreign mafia manipulating the weather.
[01:12:35.677 --> 01:12:38.381]  And again, we've had hurricanes hit before.
[01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:40.805]  We had tens of thousands die in Galveston.
[01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:43.629]  The whole city submerged in what, 1909?
[01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:47.334]  And that wasn't some weather control group doing it.
[01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.953]  But what we do know is these technologies exist.
[01:12:51.133 --> 01:13:00.180]  But getting back to, as you watched that tropical depression last week turn into a hurricane, I mean, you're a trained meteorologist.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.543]  What tell-tale signs did you see of manipulation?
[01:13:04.444 --> 01:13:12.451]  Well, Alex, the big thing that really caught my attention, I pointed out to my audience, was that the eye of Katrina passed over the National Hurricane Center.
[01:13:13.186 --> 01:13:14.247]  Last Thursday.
[01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:18.649]  And that was a wake-up call saying, listen, see what we can do.
[01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:25.734]  We're driving this storm over the top of your nation's premier research institution into hurricane study.
[01:13:26.254 --> 01:13:26.614]  And boom!
[01:13:26.674 --> 01:13:29.956]  Right over the top of the Tropical Prediction Center and our National Hurricane Center.
[01:13:30.096 --> 01:13:30.616]  Over it went.
[01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:32.898]  And they had gusts of 92 miles an hour.
[01:13:32.938 --> 01:13:35.619]  The guys went outside, looked up, and yep, yep, there's Katrina.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.703]  And she continued, I mean, for a Category 1 storm, the damage was impressive.
[01:13:42.259 --> 01:13:42.479]  I think?
[01:13:55.470 --> 01:14:07.576]  From what we have seen since 1995, and indeed going back a little bit farther than that, is just the number of intense storms versus the total number of storms that develop over the course of a year is out of whack.
[01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.217]  It's just simply out of whack.
[01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:11.698]  Well, there are more storms and they're more intense.
[01:14:11.998 --> 01:14:15.520]  And the clustering of their landfall at some point
[01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:23.017]  The unusualness of the intensity, the movement, begins to lead to that there's some kind of intent.
[01:14:23.437 --> 01:14:26.297]  And they keep hitting the same populated areas.
[01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:30.478]  Ivan and Katrina are just mirror images of one another.
[01:14:30.819 --> 01:14:33.719]  Ivan just spun down two categories before landfall.
[01:14:33.899 --> 01:14:35.120]  Katrina did not.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.660]  And there's the difference.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.761]  Ivan was a dress rehearsal, and Katrina was the final act.
[01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:42.994]  Just that simple.
[01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:49.918]  And we saw what could happen with the oil infrastructure with a Cat 2, with Ivan, and now we saw a Cat 4, Cat 5, what is possible.
[01:14:50.038 --> 01:14:53.500]  And the tsunami, we don't need an earthquake underneath the ocean.
[01:14:54.493 --> 01:14:55.494]  to give us a tsunami.
[01:14:55.614 --> 01:15:15.863]  I mean, just look at the coast of Mississippi and that jog that the storm made was just sufficient to pile, I mean, incredible amounts of water into Lake Pontchartrain and then that jog kept, I mean, the intense, ferocious wind on the strong side of the hurricane headed towards the Gulf of Mississippi, you know, that coast layers of Mississippi and Alabama.
[01:15:16.383 --> 01:15:21.365]  So they got two agendas accomplished with that last minute jog.
[01:15:21.765 --> 01:15:24.086]  That was quote-unquote a puff of dry air.
[01:15:24.966 --> 01:15:25.767]  And it was a puff.
[01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:28.748]  But it accomplished what it set out to do.
[01:15:29.631 --> 01:15:35.776]  Which would damage the infrastructure and with this economy, I mean, teetering on a mountain of debt.
[01:15:35.936 --> 01:15:39.218]  And so, what do these antenna arrays look like?
[01:15:39.238 --> 01:15:40.779]  I mean, where do they control this from?
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.781]  That's really a good question.
[01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:48.785]  And I know the ones that are doing this are likely underground and are just not visible from above.
[01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:55.110]  A HAARP, I don't know if you know what a HAARP looks like, but it's a series of hundreds of antennas
[01:15:55.772 --> 01:15:58.693]  And there's just copper wire strung along the top of it.
[01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:10.078]  So you increase the size of the antenna to dozens and dozens of acres, and you begin to get a steerable, focusable energy beam.
[01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:15.400]  And then, if you have two energy beams, you can cross their paths at some point.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.400]  It's an interference zone.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.881]  And the antenna becomes an interferometer.
[01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.842]  Well, I mean, we know what HAARP does.
[01:16:20.902 --> 01:16:22.883]  It ionizes the atmosphere and then literally
[01:16:24.272 --> 01:16:26.053]  It shoots it around the entire globe.
[01:16:26.073 --> 01:16:31.395]  And it's this flow of ions that drags the moisture of these storms around.
[01:16:31.775 --> 01:16:38.618]  And so if you can disrupt the flow of ions, disrupt the flow of electricity, you can disrupt the flow of these hurricanes.
[01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:40.299]  They're rapidly spinning tops.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.360]  Like, you know, a child's top.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.541]  You pump it up and it spins.
[01:16:43.881 --> 01:16:46.322]  And it doesn't take too much to unbalance them.
[01:16:46.738 --> 01:16:53.320]  So you fire up thunderstorms on one side, that changes the center of the mass, and then it begins to veer in another direction.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:58.462]  Or you can directly target the eyewall, in which we see unusual geometry.
[01:16:58.502 --> 01:17:06.724]  And we have, especially in Ivan, there's very unusual geometry manifest within Ivan, especially as he got over the Category 5 status.
[01:17:07.084 --> 01:17:08.565]  That begins to reveal
[01:17:09.185 --> 01:17:12.707]  The basic energy patterns that are holding these storms together.
[01:17:12.947 --> 01:17:15.849]  And let me tell you, it's not heat coming off the ocean.
[01:17:16.329 --> 01:17:16.970]  It just isn't.
[01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.711]  There's just, the budgets are all out of whack.
[01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:24.134]  The heat and energy... Well now the ocean was at record temperatures this year in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:38.663]  But then does that still allow and account for the erratic movement and retargeting or, I mean, the continuation of hitting Florida and this specific portion of the Gulf Coast that cannot be blamed on warm ocean temperatures.
[01:17:39.082 --> 01:17:39.742]  Simply cannot.
[01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:45.864]  So they're grasping for a reason to justify things that they can't explain.
[01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:49.765]  And just hope that somebody else doesn't have a more plausible explanation.
[01:17:50.345 --> 01:17:50.945]  And it's out there.
[01:17:51.725 --> 01:18:03.429]  Well, for those that just joined us in the first of the interview last hour, I read the quote by Secretary of Defense William Cohen back in 1997.
[01:18:03.509 --> 01:18:08.330]  I mean, this was a public press conference, and let me just read that as we go to break.
[01:18:09.406 --> 01:18:19.895]  Others, terrorists, are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes, remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[01:18:20.215 --> 01:18:29.483]  So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations, and it's real.
[01:18:30.383 --> 01:18:34.867]  And that's the reason why we have to intensify our counter-terrorism efforts.
[01:18:35.407 --> 01:18:37.029]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen
[01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:43.728]  And that was April 28, 1997, before the Department of Defense in a news briefing.
[01:18:43.748 --> 01:18:47.751]  Alright, we'll be right back and we'll take a few of your phone calls.
[01:18:47.831 --> 01:18:49.333]  Charles is up first, stay with us.
[01:18:54.278 --> 01:18:57.401]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[01:19:18.597 --> 01:19:22.340]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:30.862]  Including those for cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, cirrhosis, and hepatitis, among others, is extremely well documented.

[01:19:53.564 --> 01:19:56.846]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.906 --> 01:20:01.088]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.328 --> 01:20:04.110]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:06.711]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:15.556]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.736 --> 01:20:17.097]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.277 --> 01:20:21.459]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.759 --> 01:20:21.959]  I think?
[01:20:40.785 --> 01:20:45.008]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.

[01:22:00.814 --> 01:22:04.837]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:22:05.077 --> 01:22:14.385]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:22:14.665 --> 01:22:19.568]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:22:19.848 --> 01:22:23.790]  Loaded with Xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:31.794]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:38.098]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[01:22:43.962 --> 01:22:44.602]  Call now 800-625-2890.
[01:22:57.979 --> 01:23:01.940]  Well, we're talking to meteorologist Scott Stevens with your weather report.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:07.221]  We've got Dr. Doom at the controls of the weather control beam.
[01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:10.082]  It's like a Fantastic Four cartoon.
[01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:14.843]  Haha, Super Skrull will use his weather control system to destroy you.
[01:23:14.863 --> 01:23:18.884]  But, uh, I mean, we do know they have weather control systems.
[01:23:19.731 --> 01:23:21.935]  Uh, how advanced they are, you know, I don't know.
[01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:28.784]  And I'm aware of Army reports and Navy reports, and I'm aware of our government developing it, and I'm aware of this ionizing the atmosphere.
[01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:34.553]  I don't know about pulling this other energy, this zero point out of the nether reaches of Valhalla.
[01:23:35.422 --> 01:23:36.223]  But it's scary.
[01:23:36.423 --> 01:23:38.284]  Let's go to calls.
[01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:39.845]  I appreciate our guest coming on with us today.
[01:23:40.305 --> 01:23:41.706]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:23:41.806 --> 01:23:42.926]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:23:43.147 --> 01:23:43.887]  Are you there?
[01:23:43.907 --> 01:23:45.368]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:47.749]  Will you turn your radio off?
[01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:48.330]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:50.111]  It's off.
[01:23:50.131 --> 01:23:52.412]  Tell us what's going on there in New Orleans.
[01:23:52.512 --> 01:23:53.833]  There's an evacuation.
[01:23:54.413 --> 01:23:55.814]  They said they fired a shot.
[01:23:56.434 --> 01:23:59.956]  You can check this out on Channel 2, Baton Rouge News, and Channel 9.
[01:24:00.837 --> 01:24:04.399]  The reason the evacuation stopped is because they
[01:24:04.827 --> 01:24:08.110]  When they loaded the people up, they wouldn't tell them the destination they were taking them.
[01:24:08.991 --> 01:24:10.432]  And they'd like it to have been a ride there.
[01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:13.394]  They were just going to move them and not tell them where they were going.
[01:24:14.155 --> 01:24:17.398]  That's the real reason the evacuation stopped.
[01:24:18.399 --> 01:24:22.502]  They had school buses up there, lots of school buses, and they wouldn't tell the people where they were taking them.
[01:24:22.863 --> 01:24:24.104]  And they'd like it to have been a ride.
[01:24:24.424 --> 01:24:26.726]  So they canceled the evacuation.
[01:24:28.092 --> 01:24:29.253]  Very interesting.
[01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:30.653]  Channel 2 News.
[01:24:30.713 --> 01:24:31.534]  I'm not saying this.
[01:24:31.774 --> 01:24:33.215]  What's the call letters of Channel 2?
[01:24:33.355 --> 01:24:34.275]  I don't know.
[01:24:34.315 --> 01:24:37.877]  Just Channel 2 News, Baton Rouge.
[01:24:37.917 --> 01:24:39.618]  Channel 2 News, Baton Rouge.
[01:24:39.818 --> 01:24:41.359]  Channel 9 News.
[01:24:41.399 --> 01:24:41.959]  Channel 9.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.940]  I'm sorry, I don't know the call.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.661]  That's okay.
[01:24:44.741 --> 01:24:47.042]  Any comments to what he's saying, Scott?
[01:24:47.822 --> 01:24:50.924]  I wouldn't want to jump on a bus if I didn't know what was going either.
[01:24:51.514 --> 01:24:52.194]  I mean, seriously.
[01:24:52.394 --> 01:24:54.015]  I'm sure FEMA's got a nice place.
[01:24:54.075 --> 01:24:56.015]  Maybe the Chinese need some organs or something.
[01:24:57.176 --> 01:25:00.157]  Okay, Mr. Jones, there's so much military around here.
[01:25:00.177 --> 01:25:00.797]  They're not scared.
[01:25:00.817 --> 01:25:02.858]  They've got army vehicles and all that.
[01:25:03.358 --> 01:25:10.220]  Now, they're trying to declare martial law, but the Louisiana Constitution won't let them do that.
[01:25:11.243 --> 01:25:11.943]  Well, that's wise.
[01:25:12.244 --> 01:25:13.484]  You know, that's interesting.
[01:25:13.545 --> 01:25:15.126]  First we heard it was martial law.
[01:25:15.386 --> 01:25:19.068]  Then the governor said, oh no, that's a rumor, when the governor said it.
[01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:21.450]  I was wondering what was behind that.
[01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:26.293]  They tried to declare it, but the Constitution of Louisiana says they cannot declare martial law.
[01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:30.075]  Now, it's not what you're saying.
[01:25:30.636 --> 01:25:32.457]  I've been down there three times trying to get in.
[01:25:33.021 --> 01:25:34.222]  We'll put boats down there.
[01:25:34.482 --> 01:25:42.605]  If you don't have food and water, lots of it, I mean toilet paper, they will not let you in, even for volunteers.
[01:25:43.446 --> 01:25:43.926]  You understand?
[01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:45.167]  I've been down there.
[01:25:45.187 --> 01:25:46.727]  Well, you said it's not what I'm saying.
[01:25:46.747 --> 01:25:47.988]  It's not what you're saying.
[01:25:48.048 --> 01:25:48.648]  They understand.
[01:25:48.668 --> 01:25:49.489]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:25:49.509 --> 01:25:49.829]  Sorry.
[01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:52.050]  No, no, if I'm saying something wrong, which I sure am.
[01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:53.130]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:53.330]  Okay.
[01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:54.751]  You get a report from the news.
[01:25:55.333 --> 01:26:00.578]  Now, I did mention this last hour, the Red Cross has been caught stealing money and not supplying every time.
[01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:02.319]  Do not give the Red Cross money.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.444]  Any ideas of local charities that you know are trying to deliver food that we can give to, Charles?
[01:26:08.185 --> 01:26:08.725]  No, sir.
[01:26:08.765 --> 01:26:10.146]  Right now, everything's confused.
[01:26:10.507 --> 01:26:12.148]  But you're saying it right, what they're saying.
[01:26:12.168 --> 01:26:17.573]  But if you go on the news last night, they're saying in the 1940s, people were brought to
[01:26:19.389 --> 01:26:22.993]  A concentration camp, and I don't think it's going to happen in Louisiana.
[01:26:23.293 --> 01:26:23.994]  That's what he stated.
[01:26:24.294 --> 01:26:27.958]  And the people started... Wait a minute, they're talking about concentration camps in the local news?
[01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:28.278]  No.
[01:26:29.239 --> 01:26:33.744]  He said people were scared to get on a bus because they wouldn't tell them where they were bringing them.
[01:26:34.085 --> 01:26:35.346]  He said this happened in 1940.
[01:26:35.426 --> 01:26:38.169]  But I don't think it would happen here.
[01:26:38.509 --> 01:26:39.851]  The local news said that?
[01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:40.832]  Yes, I checked.
[01:26:41.584 --> 01:26:44.165]  This is Joe Chik-Temp, Fat News Channel, Mountain News.
[01:26:44.646 --> 01:26:46.047]  Unbelievable, wow!
[01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:49.188]  I'm not saying this, this is on their website from last night.
[01:26:49.428 --> 01:26:52.290]  Wow, we're not getting the same news as the local news is.
[01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:56.793]  And the other thing is, they've got SWAT teams all up there.
[01:26:57.093 --> 01:26:59.994]  They were ready to try to pull martial law and they couldn't pull it.
[01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:02.156]  They've got SWAT teams from Texas.
[01:27:02.476 --> 01:27:03.656]  They've got heavy artillery.
[01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:07.378]  And they did shoot at the cops and all that, on helicopters.
[01:27:08.119 --> 01:27:09.960]  But it's not what they're saying.
[01:27:10.407 --> 01:27:15.570]  There's areas they won't go in because the police say, I can't danger my men, they might get shot.
[01:27:16.771 --> 01:27:19.112]  Well, who are these people shooting at the police?
[01:27:19.352 --> 01:27:21.373]  Well, that's probably in the 9th Ward.
[01:27:22.134 --> 01:27:24.855]  The 9th Ward is gangs there, you know, gangs.
[01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:29.338]  I mean, what idiot in their right mind is in the city under water shooting?
[01:27:29.358 --> 01:27:29.998]  I don't believe it.
[01:27:30.438 --> 01:27:31.019]  I don't believe it.
[01:27:31.039 --> 01:27:32.139]  They want to get out of there.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:32.880]  Do you understand?
[01:27:34.289 --> 01:27:38.092]  It sounds to me like some of these gang members want to stay because they can loot.
[01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:42.936]  You know, I saw images of gang members with huge plasma TVs dragging them out.
[01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:46.018]  What good do they think a plasma TV is going to be without power?
[01:27:47.279 --> 01:27:52.843]  In small sections, Mr. Jones, they're blowing us up there because they tried to get martial law.
[01:27:52.863 --> 01:27:53.804]  They wanted martial law.
[01:27:54.124 --> 01:27:59.348]  Now they're telling the people, don't make, the blank was not to be fooled with.
[01:28:00.236 --> 01:28:01.577]  Let me tell you what they're doing to convicts.
[01:28:01.897 --> 01:28:04.218]  The convicts haven't ate since the storm come.
[01:28:04.598 --> 01:28:06.438]  They got them sitting in water, chained together.
[01:28:06.679 --> 01:28:10.320]  I'm not taking the convict's side, but they haven't eaten, Mr. Jones.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.901]  No, I've seen the video of it.
[01:28:11.941 --> 01:28:12.701]  They haven't eaten.
[01:28:13.374 --> 01:28:18.258]  And, Mr. Jones, it's all together different than what they put in the paper.
[01:28:18.698 --> 01:28:23.622]  All they're doing is praising... Well, I'll tell you what, let me just, to our guests, can you do a few more minutes with us?
[01:28:23.642 --> 01:28:24.062]  Sure thing.
[01:28:24.323 --> 01:28:24.643]  Sure thing.
[01:28:24.723 --> 01:28:25.884]  Okay, Scott Stephens is with us.
[01:28:25.904 --> 01:28:31.328]  We'll come back and let Charles finish up, then take four or five more calls, and then get into some other really important news.
[01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:40.315]  Regardless of what caused this, the hand of God, bad weather, you know, it's bad news.
[01:28:40.355 --> 01:28:41.316]  We ought to pray for everybody.
[01:28:43.859 --> 01:28:46.880]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:50.522]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.064 --> 01:29:00.366]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:00.686 --> 01:29:05.968]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:09.410]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:29:55.790 --> 01:30:06.494]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:30.227]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:32:08.002 --> 01:32:14.523]  Another great guest coming up in the next hour, and actually two guests, and your calls, so let's hurry through these calls.
[01:32:14.983 --> 01:32:18.564]  Charles, finish up what you were saying, then I'm going to go to Clive in Louisiana.
[01:32:18.984 --> 01:32:22.345]  The number... The town's new is WBRZ.
[01:32:22.605 --> 01:32:22.745]  WBRZ.
[01:32:25.376 --> 01:32:27.818]  I'm not saying that you're saying it wrong, Mr. Jones.
[01:32:27.878 --> 01:32:29.559]  I'm saying you're not getting the right information.
[01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:30.800]  They're covering it up.
[01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.442]  They're not in control of this.
[01:32:34.103 --> 01:32:38.826]  I mean, the evacuation stopped because they would not tell them where they're going.
[01:32:38.926 --> 01:32:40.367]  I just wanted to make that very clear.
[01:32:41.288 --> 01:32:43.770]  And that's on the local news, but not on the national news.
[01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:45.451]  I just gave it to them last night.
[01:32:46.071 --> 01:32:49.814]  One of them, I'm looking at it right now, WBRZ Channel 2.
[01:32:50.895 --> 01:32:53.037]  And one of the people talking was Donna Briss.
[01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.836]  Uh, you want me to get the other call-in numbers?
[01:32:56.216 --> 01:32:57.176]  I'll do it in a second.
[01:32:57.576 --> 01:32:58.397]  No, no, that's okay.
[01:32:58.417 --> 01:32:59.697]  I'll figure it out.
[01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:08.280]  But anyway, uh, as they said, 1940, it happened, the people wanted, uh, wouldn't tell them where they were going, and they brought them to, uh, concentration camps.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.521]  And they said, I don't think that would ever happen here.
[01:33:11.121 --> 01:33:12.182]  That's what they said on the news.
[01:33:12.222 --> 01:33:14.023]  So help me God, my wife is sitting right there.
[01:33:14.583 --> 01:33:20.705]  But, uh, they're saying right now that, uh, the death toll's gonna be, uh, in the four-digit numbers.
[01:33:21.325 --> 01:33:22.906]  And, uh, they're not picking up the bodies.
[01:33:23.447 --> 01:33:24.747]  The bodies are still floating.
[01:33:25.108 --> 01:33:26.048]  It's going to be a disease.
[01:33:27.588 --> 01:33:29.049]  But how many bodies are there?
[01:33:29.069 --> 01:33:30.309]  Because the news isn't showing.
[01:33:30.349 --> 01:33:33.110]  Well, it's different news at different times.
[01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:35.471]  They don't know because the bodies are floating.
[01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:38.592]  They won't stop and pick them up because they say they want to get to the people.
[01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:41.333]  Well, what about even Fats Domino's missing?
[01:33:42.673 --> 01:33:44.174]  I know Fats Domino's from New Orleans.
[01:33:44.234 --> 01:33:44.994]  I'm from New Orleans.
[01:33:45.134 --> 01:33:46.174]  I was born and raised there.
[01:33:46.555 --> 01:33:47.555]  I know Fats Domino's.
[01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:49.135]  But I mean, that's Domino's 8-1-0 show.
[01:33:52.276 --> 01:33:53.337]  20,000 people need to be rescued.
[01:33:53.537 --> 01:33:54.838]  No, no, I understand that.
[01:33:54.858 --> 01:33:57.399]  I'm just mentioning how, you know, the scope of this.
[01:33:57.479 --> 01:33:58.960]  Even Fast Domino's missing.
[01:33:59.961 --> 01:34:00.761]  I know, I know.
[01:34:00.841 --> 01:34:03.443]  I've got my two aunts, my cousin, and a little baby.
[01:34:03.723 --> 01:34:04.563]  I can't find them.
[01:34:04.584 --> 01:34:05.464]  A little baby?
[01:34:05.544 --> 01:34:06.725]  Oh, I didn't know that, Charles.
[01:34:06.785 --> 01:34:08.406]  Two babies, I think.
[01:34:08.506 --> 01:34:10.507]  One's a father and one's, I think, seven now.
[01:34:11.027 --> 01:34:11.467]  Oh, okay.
[01:34:11.568 --> 01:34:12.588]  I've got my two aunts.
[01:34:12.608 --> 01:34:13.549]  She needs oxygen.
[01:34:14.069 --> 01:34:14.889]  I can't get through.
[01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:16.670]  I've been brought boats up there.
[01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:17.451]  We've brought food.
[01:34:17.856 --> 01:34:19.377]  I can't get no cooperation.
[01:34:19.417 --> 01:34:27.283]  They won't even... I ask them just to pass... Well, I mean, even the mainstream media admits that it's the citizens bringing food, the citizens housing the people, the government.
[01:34:27.764 --> 01:34:34.629]  The mayor of New Orleans threw a fit and actually started using some mild profanities and said, the feds are screwing everything up.
[01:34:34.649 --> 01:34:36.110]  Why don't they just let the people in?
[01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.651]  They asked the guy from FEMA that.
[01:34:37.711 --> 01:34:38.452]  Everything's messed up.
[01:34:38.492 --> 01:34:40.073]  How come we don't have the support?
[01:34:40.373 --> 01:34:42.114]  You said you're going to give us the help you're going to give us.
[01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:44.336]  You're going to be able to take the time we're trying to organize.
[01:34:44.616 --> 01:34:58.365]  So if they don't have it organized... Well people are going to start really dying after four or five days and drinking, you know, sewer-tainted, fetid water, and out in the mosquitoes, and you're going to have major problems.
[01:34:58.445 --> 01:35:02.627]  Is the water still equalized with Ponchartrain?
[01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:03.308]  Yes.
[01:35:04.589 --> 01:35:06.470]  Well, that water leveled off, too.
[01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:12.452]  I don't know, but anyway, that levee, it kind of leveled off, but they're trying to shove a barge into it.
[01:35:12.872 --> 01:35:15.853]  It's a 300 foot hole, but some people say it's 500 feet.
[01:35:16.353 --> 01:35:20.454]  What they're saying on one news is 300, some people are saying it's 500.
[01:35:20.554 --> 01:35:21.294]  It's a total mess.
[01:35:21.574 --> 01:35:24.875]  If there's rain up there, anything happens, the rest of the people are finished.
[01:35:25.355 --> 01:35:29.016]  The water was supposed to go up to 9 feet higher, but I don't know if it's rising.
[01:35:29.036 --> 01:35:30.777]  They say in Jefferson Parish it dropped.
[01:35:31.717 --> 01:35:33.478]  But it's total chaos.
[01:35:34.781 --> 01:35:36.803]  And I mean, they wanted to declare martial law.
[01:35:36.823 --> 01:35:39.185]  Do you have any comments on this?
[01:35:39.245 --> 01:35:42.468]  Do you have any comments, Scott Stevens?
[01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:47.233]  Glad that they've enjoyed relatively calm weather since the storm has left.
[01:35:47.633 --> 01:35:54.499]  And that massive storm surge should continue to drain out of the lake until they find a normal equalization.
[01:35:54.539 --> 01:36:00.565]  But still, we're coming up on new moon here, so we're going to see tides continue to be higher than normal.
[01:36:01.132 --> 01:36:04.853]  And then again, the risk of additional rainfall has got to be there.
[01:36:04.873 --> 01:36:07.173]  Well, we've got two months left in the hurricane season.
[01:36:07.613 --> 01:36:09.814]  The peak, the median date, is September 10th.
[01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:13.894]  So we have even ten days before we complete the first half of this storm season.
[01:36:14.795 --> 01:36:15.615]  Ten days to go.
[01:36:16.275 --> 01:36:21.856]  Gratefully, all we've got is Tropical Depression lead that is way out in the Atlantic, and there isn't anything looming immediately.
[01:36:22.416 --> 01:36:23.456]  But that can change.
[01:36:23.696 --> 01:36:25.337]  But Katrina came out of nowhere.
[01:36:25.657 --> 01:36:25.997]  Truly.
[01:36:26.497 --> 01:36:26.817]  Truly.
[01:36:27.512 --> 01:36:27.832]  Truly.
[01:36:28.433 --> 01:36:29.434]  She truly did.
[01:36:29.615 --> 01:36:31.677]  And in the southwestern Bahamas, she just spun up.
[01:36:35.117 --> 01:36:35.617]  There she is.
[01:36:36.978 --> 01:36:41.862]  Again, the control of this process, Alex, is so precise.
[01:36:42.362 --> 01:36:43.943]  They're so good at it right now.
[01:36:44.463 --> 01:36:45.084]  So very good.
[01:36:45.104 --> 01:36:48.506]  So you're convinced this is institutionally manufactured?
[01:36:48.786 --> 01:36:50.367]  They chose the names ahead of time.
[01:36:50.968 --> 01:36:52.549]  I mean, there's a list of names.
[01:36:52.689 --> 01:36:58.533]  Why do you think that Chertop is out saying, oh yeah, weeks ago we were preparing for just this.
[01:36:59.338 --> 01:37:01.025]  A lot of really suspicious comments.
[01:37:01.366 --> 01:37:01.727]  There are.
[01:37:01.747 --> 01:37:04.899]  And these are clues that whether they're intentionally delivered or...
[01:37:05.845 --> 01:37:08.187]  Or not intentionally delivered their clues, nonetheless.
[01:37:08.227 --> 01:37:10.929]  And they're just a portion of this very big picture.
[01:37:11.289 --> 01:37:14.131]  Far, far more grand than people realize.
[01:37:14.271 --> 01:37:15.372]  Charles, what do you think?
[01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:19.155]  I mean, we know that they do have weather control, but... I'll tell you the truth.
[01:37:19.315 --> 01:37:20.176]  I don't know what to think.
[01:37:20.416 --> 01:37:21.617]  But we've got another problem.
[01:37:21.657 --> 01:37:24.519]  People trying to get back to Baton Rouge are running out of gas.
[01:37:24.759 --> 01:37:25.620]  They stopped this morning.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.921]  A woman had two kids.
[01:37:26.981 --> 01:37:27.822]  Dirty diapers.
[01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:29.423]  Don't know money for gas.
[01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.124]  The gas price jumped up.
[01:37:31.184 --> 01:37:32.185]  I mean, they can't get back.
[01:37:32.445 --> 01:37:33.446]  They're stuck down here.
[01:37:34.293 --> 01:37:38.434]  And then, Sam, they're telling the people that Air Force One went over to Dome Stadium.
[01:37:38.654 --> 01:37:40.555]  This gave the people encouragement.
[01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.075]  A push pass.
[01:37:42.975 --> 01:37:44.215]  This encouraged the people.
[01:37:44.596 --> 01:37:45.576]  It helps on its way.
[01:37:45.916 --> 01:37:54.458]  Now, are people there in New Orleans and surrounding areas, are they aware that the federal government cut the funding almost down to nothing to fix the levees?
[01:37:54.478 --> 01:37:56.118]  Yeah, I went to stories today.
[01:37:56.338 --> 01:37:56.999]  Some people were there.
[01:37:57.019 --> 01:37:58.759]  I said, y'all realize that Moon Landrieu
[01:37:59.491 --> 01:38:01.612]  Cut the fun in this if we know about that, yes.
[01:38:01.972 --> 01:38:04.914]  But right now we've got a medium problem on hand.
[01:38:05.034 --> 01:38:06.075]  People are robbing around here.
[01:38:06.095 --> 01:38:07.075]  They're stopping your car.
[01:38:07.115 --> 01:38:08.436]  They're coming in your house, robbing you.
[01:38:08.836 --> 01:38:10.317]  There ain't nothing to report about that.
[01:38:10.457 --> 01:38:10.977]  Oh, really?
[01:38:10.997 --> 01:38:13.659]  So there's also roving gangs just in other areas?
[01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:17.040]  Yeah, well, they're coming back, you see, from like Texas and all that.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.641]  They're running out of gas money.
[01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.743]  And, you know, the gas prices jumped up.
[01:38:22.163 --> 01:38:23.884]  And people don't have the money to try to get back.
[01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:25.625]  There's hundreds and hundreds of people
[01:38:26.509 --> 01:38:29.772]  Trying to get back to see if their family is alright.
[01:38:29.972 --> 01:38:35.035]  Alex, one of the things we've got to do is stop unnecessary travel across the whole country.
[01:38:35.475 --> 01:38:42.320]  Because we're using fuel, and this nation has only about a 20-25 day reserve of distilled fuel.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.983]  Whether that's heating oil, or jet fuel, or gasoline.
[01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:49.285]  25 days is it, and we're still using it at the typical pace.
[01:38:49.765 --> 01:38:54.330]  And you watch, they're not going to build more refineries after this because they make more money off scarcity.
[01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:55.051]  No, no, no.
[01:38:55.171 --> 01:39:01.778]  What they're doing is, what we're going to have are literally hundreds of thousands of acres of abandoned SUVs.
[01:39:02.419 --> 01:39:05.783]  Because people can't afford the payments on them, and can't afford to put gas in them.
[01:39:06.123 --> 01:39:09.467]  I mean, they'll just simply walk away from those employee-priced vehicles.
[01:39:10.225 --> 01:39:11.446]  They'll just walk away from them.
[01:39:11.966 --> 01:39:13.407]  Yeah, the employee price vehicles.
[01:39:13.627 --> 01:39:16.028]  If they're walking away now, they don't have gas to get back.
[01:39:16.048 --> 01:39:16.789]  They're running out of gas.
[01:39:16.809 --> 01:39:17.629]  They don't have no money.
[01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:18.470]  That's the point.
[01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:24.193]  And Ben, remember, this natural gas has been firing more and more of this nation's power plants.
[01:39:24.373 --> 01:39:33.619]  And we're going to have interruptions as we get into this cold season if we don't get these refineries back up and the pipelines working very, very soon.
[01:39:33.699 --> 01:39:35.179]  Let me ask Charles a question.
[01:39:35.239 --> 01:39:37.661]  Charles, how much is gas in Louisiana right now?
[01:39:38.902 --> 01:39:39.382]  We're ready?
[01:39:39.482 --> 01:39:39.983]  We are, honey.
[01:39:43.446 --> 01:39:44.306]  Charles, are you still there?
[01:39:44.326 --> 01:39:46.368]  Yeah, my wife, she's just shooting on the road here.
[01:39:46.408 --> 01:39:48.690]  She just came back from the show.
[01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:49.851]  They're shooting on the road here.
[01:39:51.132 --> 01:39:52.834]  That sounds like total bedlam.
[01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:57.798]  I mean, they took a car, and they ran out of gas and shot a woman in the head.
[01:39:58.298 --> 01:40:00.940]  I mean, is that bad, Mr. Jones?
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.882]  So, you're in... Where are you again?
[01:40:03.262 --> 01:40:04.163]  I'm 50 miles from there.
[01:40:04.679 --> 01:40:05.740]  But in what town are you in?
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.501]  I'm in Walker, Louisiana, sir.
[01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:09.862]  But are you saying in Walker there was just a shooting?
[01:40:10.263 --> 01:40:11.143]  What was that, Walker, honey?
[01:40:11.784 --> 01:40:12.584]  Honey, Walker?
[01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:15.206]  Walker Walmart.
[01:40:16.388 --> 01:40:18.369]  So in your town there's shootings going on?
[01:40:18.409 --> 01:40:18.769]  Yes, yes.
[01:40:18.829 --> 01:40:19.449]  Oh, they rob you.
[01:40:19.509 --> 01:40:20.510]  They'll come up in your driveway.
[01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:22.331]  They'll get directors and rob you.
[01:40:22.731 --> 01:40:29.894]  Is this the event that Henry Kissinger talked about that would allow those blue cap UN people in to restore order?
[01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:33.136]  He said if there was a big enough disaster we'd accept foreign troops.
[01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:34.276]  The people would demand it.
[01:40:34.316 --> 01:40:43.060]  Well, I know that five years ago, in the last year of Bill Clinton's administration, they had UN soldiers helping fight the fires in twelve western states.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:43.520]  Remember that?
[01:40:43.721 --> 01:40:43.921]  Yep.
[01:40:44.201 --> 01:40:44.521]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:52.004]  See, I'm in Idaho, and we have greater than 70% of our National Guard troops overseas.
[01:40:52.184 --> 01:40:53.104]  My brother's one of them.
[01:40:53.124 --> 01:40:55.606]  What are your oil prices right now?
[01:40:55.646 --> 01:40:57.767]  I mean, what's the gas prices at the pump there right now?
[01:40:57.927 --> 01:40:59.868]  I filled up last night premium for $2.81.
[01:40:59.928 --> 01:41:02.790]  That's cheap!
[01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:03.470]  It is cheap!
[01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:04.771]  That's why I filled up!
[01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:07.051]  Because it's only going up.
[01:41:07.391 --> 01:41:11.413]  Did you hear about Atlanta for six bucks?
[01:41:11.893 --> 01:41:12.533]  Is that what it is?
[01:41:12.813 --> 01:41:13.053]  No.
[01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:13.933]  That's the shock.
[01:41:14.374 --> 01:41:18.535]  That's the shock, and that's why you must protect your wealth with gold and silver.
[01:41:19.095 --> 01:41:22.716]  You've got to do that, because those will be the blow-off points economically.
[01:41:23.056 --> 01:41:28.978]  That's where all of the liquid, the slushy money that's looking for a return will flood into precious metals.
[01:41:29.318 --> 01:41:34.820]  If you haven't secured physical silver, physical gold, you must do so very, very soon.
[01:41:35.638 --> 01:41:36.138]  Very still.
[01:41:36.619 --> 01:41:40.061]  Well, speaking of the devil, we'll be talking about that a little bit coming up in the next hour.
[01:41:40.441 --> 01:41:48.086]  You know, Charles, I mean, your wife, and I've got a picture of you and your wife with your dog that you sent me many years ago for Christmas.
[01:41:49.307 --> 01:41:51.729]  Charles has been a listener for, I don't know, like eight, seven, eight years.
[01:41:52.209 --> 01:41:58.533]  Charles, you're telling me that your wife tried to go to the store, and they're roving gangs, blowing people's heads off.
[01:41:58.553 --> 01:41:59.494]  Well, just one woman.
[01:42:00.274 --> 01:42:05.297]  But I mean, all over the state, though, we know that that's going on, but you're saying that this happened again where you're at.
[01:42:05.457 --> 01:42:05.857]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:06.358 --> 01:42:08.079]  And, uh, we didn't hear nothing on the news about it.
[01:42:08.119 --> 01:42:08.999]  My wife just come back.
[01:42:09.059 --> 01:42:11.161]  Well, I've never heard a better reason for the 2nd Amendment.
[01:42:11.181 --> 01:42:13.282]  Well, they take the call for the gas and all, they got kicked.
[01:42:13.682 --> 01:42:16.624]  I'm telling you, Mr. Jones, it's chaos all over Louisiana.
[01:42:16.844 --> 01:42:18.025]  How much is gas there?
[01:42:18.185 --> 01:42:18.825]  About $3.10, $3.20.
[01:42:20.786 --> 01:42:21.707]  It's delayed.
[01:42:21.847 --> 01:42:23.668]  When people realize they can't get it.
[01:42:24.252 --> 01:42:36.758]  Well, that's why I said it's gouging in Atlanta, because they already have their tanks filled that are now getting low that they've already paid for, and so they're ripping people off.
[01:42:36.798 --> 01:42:37.798]  That is gouging.
[01:42:37.838 --> 01:42:39.439]  That's $6 a gallon.
[01:42:39.519 --> 01:42:48.603]  And there's this surge of demand of people anticipating shortages, so they're going to get what they can now, and that's why we must institute travel.
[01:42:48.703 --> 01:42:51.344]  I mean, unnecessary travel has got to be reined in.
[01:42:51.744 --> 01:42:55.006]  Yeah, but you can't have the government come in and call for that.
[01:42:55.246 --> 01:42:56.487]  Who else is going to?
[01:42:57.027 --> 01:42:58.108]  We need some leadership.
[01:42:59.008 --> 01:43:00.789]  We have to have leadership.
[01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:02.350]  And that's not happening now.
[01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:06.092]  Because they don't want people to realize... They'll make more money off a crisis.
[01:43:06.472 --> 01:43:08.633]  Well, yes they will.
[01:43:09.174 --> 01:43:11.095]  They will.
[01:43:12.275 --> 01:43:13.456]  It's all the petroleum.
[01:43:13.596 --> 01:43:15.497]  And we've got an oil man in the White House.
[01:43:16.667 --> 01:43:22.675]  And that money is just going to flow back into the explorations, back into the repair, and back into these oil companies.
[01:43:22.735 --> 01:43:25.739]  And it's only with the disruption of about 13% of supply.
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:31.026]  That means the other 87%, I mean, the return on that money is going to be huge.
[01:43:31.716 --> 01:43:32.157]  Huge!
[01:43:32.537 --> 01:43:36.301]  Well, it's time to build more refineries and open more fields.
[01:43:36.361 --> 01:43:39.043]  It's time to quit using petroleum as an energy source.
[01:43:39.324 --> 01:43:42.407]  Well, there are a lot of new systems they haven't allowed to come online.
[01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:43.448]  Charles, anything else?
[01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:51.976]  Just one thing, Mr. You know, I love you to death, and I'm not saying that you've seen it wrong, it's the news giving the false information about the evacuation.
[01:43:51.996 --> 01:43:54.619]  So you're saying the mainstream media is making it look better than it is?
[01:43:54.639 --> 01:43:54.879]  Yes, yes.
[01:43:56.227 --> 01:44:02.130]  The mainstream media says shots were fired so they've ceased the evacuation of the Superdome.
[01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:10.253]  You're saying it's because, on local news... My wife's right here, she said, honey, they said that they wouldn't tell the people where they were taking them.
[01:44:10.293 --> 01:44:11.294]  And it was a riot, right?
[01:44:11.854 --> 01:44:12.434]  It was a riot.
[01:44:12.474 --> 01:44:13.315]  My wife's right here.
[01:44:13.355 --> 01:44:14.135]  No, I believe you.
[01:44:14.155 --> 01:44:15.996]  I'm already checking it out right now.
[01:44:17.457 --> 01:44:20.358]  They wasn't telling them where they were taking them, and so it started a riot.
[01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:21.831]  All right, Charles.
[01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:23.232]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:44:23.252 --> 01:44:24.233]  God bless you, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:24.553 --> 01:44:24.853]  Pardon me?
[01:44:26.774 --> 01:44:27.835]  God bless you, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:28.136 --> 01:44:29.116]  Okay, thank you, Charles.
[01:44:29.136 --> 01:44:30.237]  I appreciate it.
[01:44:30.257 --> 01:44:31.798]  Let's take another call from Louisiana.
[01:44:31.838 --> 01:44:33.520]  Clive in Louisiana.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:34.180]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:34.941]  Go ahead, Clive.
[01:44:35.781 --> 01:44:36.602]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:36.662 --> 01:44:37.423]  I was calling.
[01:44:37.463 --> 01:44:40.305]  I wanted to kind of add on to what Charles was just saying.
[01:44:40.325 --> 01:44:46.970]  I have several friends who are law enforcement officers, and they just informed me this morning
[01:44:47.662 --> 01:44:48.022]  Thank you for
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:12.522]  They contacted him and they told the guys from the 9th Ward where he was staying and they killed him.
[01:45:12.542 --> 01:45:18.063]  They have him in custody right now and the media has pretty much kept a tight lip on that.
[01:45:18.103 --> 01:45:19.483]  What kind of people would kill?
[01:45:19.523 --> 01:45:25.025]  Because again, the Red Cross at the top is very corrupt but all the well-meaning, low-level volunteers do a great job.
[01:45:25.545 --> 01:45:28.145]  This little guy wants to help them so they come killing?
[01:45:28.165 --> 01:45:29.206]  Yes.
[01:45:29.566 --> 01:45:30.286]  That's insane!
[01:45:30.686 --> 01:45:40.068]  Yeah, but the reason why I really called was because I came across this news article that's in our local papers and it says long-term shelter still in air.
[01:45:40.588 --> 01:45:54.351]  Now Dean Dozier, who's head of Washington Parish Office of Homeland Security, Washington Parish is northeast Louisiana of Homeland Security, he and the mayor are now contemplating, several other people are now contemplating
[01:45:54.955 --> 01:45:55.958]  We're good to go.
[01:46:02.614 --> 01:46:04.755]  Dean Dozier was actually on radio.
[01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.956]  I heard him on the radio on my way to work.
[01:46:07.056 --> 01:46:11.618]  They're having to make permanent ones because New Orleans, for the next year at least, is gone.
[01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:24.583]  Yes, right now I've been up there to our Civic Center, to our arena, and we have about 2,000 evacuees there, and we're supposed to be getting roughly upwards to 3,000 more people coming here.
[01:46:24.603 --> 01:46:28.944]  How many people were really in the city of New Orleans?
[01:46:31.945 --> 01:46:32.866]  Before this happened?
[01:46:33.326 --> 01:46:34.287]  I couldn't really tell you.
[01:46:34.307 --> 01:46:36.048]  I don't have the estimate number.
[01:46:36.068 --> 01:46:37.649]  Wasn't it like a city of over 3 million?
[01:46:39.571 --> 01:46:39.911]  It was about 1.2.
[01:46:39.991 --> 01:46:42.773]  Yeah, I don't think it was that many.
[01:46:42.793 --> 01:46:45.474]  But I'm counting all the surrounding towns.
[01:46:46.015 --> 01:46:48.316]  The whole metro area, how many people?
[01:46:49.797 --> 01:46:51.118]  I think I read over 3 million.
[01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:57.983]  The question is how many were bound by the levy and cannot go home for great deals of time.
[01:46:58.796 --> 01:47:04.584]  And indeed, are those structures even salvageable because of all of the contamination?
[01:47:05.084 --> 01:47:08.469]  And the days upon days it's going to sit there in that toxic soup.
[01:47:09.232 --> 01:47:14.373]  I mean, the question is, will they actually rebuild it, even once it's pumped out, and will it be insurable?
[01:47:14.613 --> 01:47:16.154]  Well, see, here's the interesting thing.
[01:47:16.194 --> 01:47:24.956]  Now, this guy that I was just telling you about, who's the head of our parish homeland security, every time he referred to the evacuees, he referred to them as refugees.
[01:47:25.136 --> 01:47:25.936]  That's a better term.
[01:47:26.176 --> 01:47:26.876]  That's a better term.
[01:47:26.896 --> 01:47:29.217]  That's a United Nations term.
[01:47:29.497 --> 01:47:36.378]  Right, and that kind of tells you that, okay, they're saying pretty much that New Orleans is gone.
[01:47:36.398 --> 01:47:38.759]  Yeah, a refugee is permanent.
[01:47:39.159 --> 01:47:59.920]  Right, exactly, and that's why it's still up in the air that they were going to try to make, take abandoned buildings, not abandoned, but vacant buildings, and use the Coliseum, he said this, in Shreveport, and they're contemplating making it permanent shelters, and I've been to the ones that we have here in Monroe, and I mean, it's
[01:48:00.464 --> 01:48:02.527]  What about the crime?
[01:48:02.567 --> 01:48:08.295]  We just heard Charles say that in towns, I mean, his wife goes to the store and somebody gets their head blown off.
[01:48:16.606 --> 01:48:37.248]  Well, one of my friends, I used to be a probation officer, and I know a lot of the marshals there, and I was talking to a guy friend of mine this morning, and he said that we're getting some more people from, you know, the ninth wards, these different wards from New Orleans, and that they're expecting the crime to kind of go up because, I mean, these people have nothing.
[01:48:37.968 --> 01:48:42.933]  And, you know, they'll shoot at police, so just imagine what they'll do to regular folks.
[01:48:44.274 --> 01:48:44.814]  Exactly!
[01:48:44.894 --> 01:48:47.176]  I mean, it just seems like craziness.
[01:48:47.476 --> 01:48:51.160]  I mean, New Orleans was the murder capital of the country at one point.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:49:02.189]  I don't know if it was prior to this, but we're expecting about 3,000, maybe 4,000 more people coming this way, and Monroe is not that big of a city.
[01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:04.071]  It's not near the size of
[01:49:04.731 --> 01:49:06.692]  We're good to go.
[01:49:31.159 --> 01:49:32.241]  It is.
[01:49:32.641 --> 01:49:37.005]  The level of the disaster, the depths of it, just gets worse and worse.
[01:49:37.045 --> 01:49:37.846]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:37.866 --> 01:49:41.550]  Will you call us back throughout the week and give us updates, Clive?
[01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:42.391]  Okay, good.
[01:49:42.991 --> 01:49:43.792]  God bless you, sir.
[01:49:43.852 --> 01:49:44.213]  Thank you.
[01:49:44.353 --> 01:49:49.698]  We'll be right back and have some final comments from our guest, who's got the great website, weatherwars.info.
[01:49:54.702 --> 01:49:57.564]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.804 --> 01:49:59.385]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:50:09.592 --> 01:50:13.635]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.995 --> 01:50:16.837]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.937 --> 01:50:21.601]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[01:52:30.981 --> 01:52:31.361]  I think so.
[01:52:54.226 --> 01:53:11.070]  Folks, I had a professor, a scientist from England joining us in the next hour and I just cancelled him because we need to take your phone calls.
[01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:18.071]  We need to get your take on what's happening in New Orleans and in surrounding areas of Louisiana and Mississippi.
[01:53:19.582 --> 01:53:29.451]  And the economic effects this is going to have on the economy, and then just the unbelievably pathetic response of the vacationing neocon Bush.
[01:53:31.492 --> 01:53:37.618]  I want to thank our guests for spending so much time with us today, a really incredible website, a lot of amazing research.
[01:53:38.286 --> 01:53:39.866]  Things are happening with our weather.
[01:53:40.327 --> 01:53:41.547]  It is being manipulated.
[01:53:41.587 --> 01:53:42.207]  That's admitted.
[01:53:42.247 --> 01:53:42.987]  That's mainstream.
[01:53:43.747 --> 01:53:48.769]  I don't know if I agree with the conclusions of our meteorologist friend, but you know, he's got a degree and I don't.
[01:53:49.409 --> 01:53:51.569]  But Scott Stevens, I appreciate you.
[01:53:52.070 --> 01:54:01.032]  I appreciate you coming on with us and I hope folks will visit weatherwars.info because definitely there's a lot to take away from your site that is very important.
[01:54:01.333 --> 01:54:03.960]  There's still a lot of research yet to be done.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.031]  I just haven't had the time to dig through and basically do a post-mortem on this storm.
[01:54:08.092 --> 01:54:09.135]  That will get done.
[01:54:10.050 --> 01:54:15.456]  But it's just more important that people realize that this is possible, and look at the skies.
[01:54:15.756 --> 01:54:20.021]  Look and notice the odd things happening in the skies, and then your eyes will change.
[01:54:20.041 --> 01:54:21.923]  And you get into all this scientifically on your side.
[01:54:21.943 --> 01:54:25.567]  I mean, you show radar photos, and you show satellite.
[01:54:25.587 --> 01:54:27.409]  I mean, you show just this incredible stuff.
[01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.510]  It's there.
[01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:32.354]  It's just truly all there, and I put it together so other weathermen
[01:54:32.714 --> 01:54:38.417]  ...can see what I see, and so what's written at that level, it's not, it's not... What response?
[01:54:38.437 --> 01:54:42.419]  I mean, you've got some of these posted, but what response have you gotten from other meteorologists?
[01:54:42.519 --> 01:54:43.160]  They're intrigued.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.621]  They're very intrigued.
[01:54:45.261 --> 01:54:46.421]  And I was the same way.
[01:54:46.482 --> 01:54:50.664]  It took me six years to get that sinking feeling in my gut.
[01:54:50.684 --> 01:54:52.905]  Well, I've talked to a local weatherman who won't go public.
[01:54:52.985 --> 01:54:54.846]  Obviously, you've had some pressure at your TV station.
[01:54:55.066 --> 01:54:58.888]  But I've talked to a local weatherman who goes, yeah, we know something's going on, but we can't talk about it.
[01:54:59.829 --> 01:55:00.449]  That's too bad.
[01:55:00.729 --> 01:55:02.110]  He just needs to find the courage to do it.
[01:55:02.972 --> 01:55:04.713]  You know, and then just deal with the consequences.
[01:55:04.813 --> 01:55:07.555]  It's like, yeah, we think Galileo's right.
[01:55:07.575 --> 01:55:09.557]  The world may be round, but we can't say it.
[01:55:09.777 --> 01:55:11.118]  Yep, and that's too bad.
[01:55:11.358 --> 01:55:13.339]  I mean, that courage will be found by a few more.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:13.940]  All right.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.282]  Thank you, Scott Stevens, for coming on with us.
[01:55:16.702 --> 01:55:17.502]  Talk to you again soon.
[01:55:18.043 --> 01:55:19.003]  Take care, my friend.
[01:55:20.164 --> 01:55:26.569]  Look, I don't think I agree with who he says politically could be behind this, but weather modification is admitted.
[01:55:27.888 --> 01:55:33.211]  And don't think for a minute that our government doesn't have much more advanced systems than the precious little Rooskies.
[01:55:38.193 --> 01:55:42.095]  Again, folks, hurricanes have been hitting New Orleans forever and killing people forever.
[01:55:42.555 --> 01:55:44.136]  And they didn't fix those levees.
[01:55:45.157 --> 01:55:47.538]  And it just shows you the government isn't going to protect you.
[01:55:47.598 --> 01:55:53.301]  And the people that are trying to help, that are really helping the refugees right now predominantly, are the citizens.
[01:55:54.955 --> 01:55:57.155]  So in the next hour we'll talk about that.
[01:55:58.076 --> 01:56:00.556]  I personally have given money to charities, but I check them out first.
[01:56:00.616 --> 01:56:02.236]  It's like meals on wheels.
[01:56:02.296 --> 01:56:06.517]  We've probably given them $1,000, which is a lot of money for us in the last year.
[01:56:06.537 --> 01:56:08.217]  $250 here, $500 there.
[01:56:08.237 --> 01:56:14.879]  Because I know, I've gone out and volunteered, I know that's really helping people.
[01:56:15.639 --> 01:56:17.399]  I wouldn't give five cents to the Red Cross.
[01:56:17.459 --> 01:56:18.639]  Okay, side issue.
[01:56:18.659 --> 01:56:21.440]  You need to research who you support.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:22.280]  You need to research us.
[01:56:23.184 --> 01:56:32.672]  We do need your support in the fight against the Globalists, and they could carry out a nuclear attack any day, a bio-attack, blame it on firing enemies, as a way to really mobilize us for World War III.
[01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:36.575]  The Globalists, we have our own game plans to do this.
[01:56:37.756 --> 01:56:43.321]  And I hope you'll get Martial Law, my newest and most powerful film, a three-hour miniseries, three films in one.
[01:56:44.828 --> 01:56:48.791]  $25.95.
[01:56:45.008 --> 01:56:48.791]  Get multiple copies, it drops down to $14 apiece.
[01:56:49.412 --> 01:56:55.036]  You can get the last film I made that's excellent for $5.95 when you buy one copy at the regular price.
[01:56:55.476 --> 01:56:57.858]  And that's American Dictators, an excellent video.
[01:56:58.339 --> 01:57:02.462]  And your support is vital to the continual operation of this operation.

[01:57:49.915 --> 01:57:50.556]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.216 --> 01:57:52.297]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.977 --> 01:57:54.118]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.138 --> 01:57:55.559]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.319 --> 01:57:57.360]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.881 --> 01:58:01.803]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.063 --> 01:58:06.186]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:12.010]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, we're here.
[01:58:12.170 --> 01:58:14.092]  Look, I know Bob's been holding it for over an hour.
[01:58:14.632 --> 01:58:15.853]  Tim and John and others.
[01:58:16.513 --> 01:58:18.955]  But we continue to get calls from Louisiana.
[01:58:19.733 --> 01:58:27.379]  People that are eyewitnesses, not just to what local news is reporting, which is very different than national news, but also to what they're actually seeing physically.
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:46.174]  You know, people getting their heads blown off, you know, in small towns by the looters, who, again, you had a large portion of the city that left, ran out of money, staying in Houston and other areas, and Texas, now they're coming back in, and families run out of gas, kids on the side of the street,
[01:58:46.858 --> 01:58:48.379]  A total breakdown of society.
[01:58:48.419 --> 01:58:55.084]  I mean, where are the authorities, the public servants, giving money to these women with children to get fuel back in their car?
[01:58:56.085 --> 01:58:59.428]  I mean, where's the Red Cross doling out money for fuel?
[01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:04.471]  We know they got $3 billion they didn't spend that they kept from 9-11.
[01:59:05.632 --> 01:59:06.473]  Breaking their promise.
[01:59:07.697 --> 01:59:10.798]  So, it is just, it is amazing.
[01:59:11.118 --> 01:59:15.720]  I'm going to move quickly through your calls, no matter how good your call is, because I need to get to the next person.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.440]  JW in Louisiana, you're up first.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:18.941]  Go ahead.
[01:59:19.221 --> 01:59:21.501]  Yes, Alex, I'm in Baton Rouge.
[01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:23.102]  Actually, I'm in Livingston, Paris.
[01:59:23.142 --> 01:59:25.403]  It's a bedroom suburb of Baton Rouge.
[01:59:25.443 --> 01:59:25.743]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:26.203 --> 01:59:27.623]  We have doubled the population.
[01:59:27.723 --> 01:59:29.804]  I don't know what's been said this morning already.
[01:59:29.824 --> 01:59:34.985]  I've only just caught brief segments of your show, but Baton Rouge has doubled its population overnight.
[01:59:35.886 --> 01:59:36.586]  What is it like?
[01:59:37.256 --> 01:59:48.886]  Well, downtown Baton Rouge, where the governmental building and the river center is, where the housing quote-unquote refugees is, uh, it's under pretty much heavy lockdown.
[01:59:48.966 --> 01:59:53.250]  I hate to use the word lockdown, but the police is really in math down there.
[01:59:54.211 --> 02:00:03.339]  And, uh, there's been, I don't, I don't know how much of it's erroneous report or we getting a lot of actual stuff, but I don't know how much the news media is playing it down.
[02:00:03.399 --> 02:00:04.920]  And I don't know how much of it's rumor.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:20.565]  But I know for a fact that the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office, which is located adjacent to the governmental building, my understanding is, and I had it from a reliable source, actually a deputy says that they have actually, they have locked down the building at the Sheriff's Office.
[02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:22.025]  Employees are locked in.
[02:00:22.918 --> 02:00:30.864]  I understand that the governmental employees... Why on earth would they lock themselves in like 14-foot goblins were on the outside of it?
[02:00:31.545 --> 02:00:34.007]  Are they thinking there's going to be a tunnel breakdown in the state?
[02:00:34.227 --> 02:00:40.812]  Well, it's just all the refugees, and that's the only word I can use at this point, it's just all adjacent to where they're at.
[02:00:40.832 --> 02:00:42.834]  They're just mingling in and out of the buildings.
[02:00:44.033 --> 02:00:44.873]  In my understanding.
[02:00:44.893 --> 02:00:48.135]  I would tend to agree with that because I'm getting reports from
[02:01:02.702 --> 02:01:09.065]  Listen, I'm against tyranny and I'm against out of control behavior.
[02:01:09.465 --> 02:01:13.027]  But once you get a breakdown, then it's going to be even worse, folks.
[02:01:13.068 --> 02:01:15.469]  And then they're going to institute it nationwide.
[02:01:15.749 --> 02:01:19.191]  The police need to get in there and there's some problems and start cracking some heads.
[02:01:19.451 --> 02:01:23.974]  But if you don't have problems yet in your town, and the police are all locked up doing nothing,
[02:01:24.774 --> 02:01:32.976]  That sounds like the LA riots where the police wouldn't even contain 10 rioters in the first hour and then it turned into half the city burning down.
[02:01:33.297 --> 02:01:35.057]  I mean, it's going to be their fault.
[02:01:35.137 --> 02:01:36.397]  They've got a job to do.
[02:01:36.678 --> 02:01:37.538]  What are they doing?
[02:01:37.558 --> 02:01:39.858]  I mean, it's like with Columbine.
[02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:44.900]  It's like with Columbine where they sat there for 4 hours and 15 minutes outside the building.
[02:01:45.495 --> 02:01:49.657]  Bond, I understand that, and I do exactly understand what you're saying.
[02:01:49.677 --> 02:01:50.717]  Well, what did the deputy say?
[02:01:50.757 --> 02:01:52.958]  I mean, the deputy's telling you we're all locked down in there.
[02:01:53.038 --> 02:01:54.178]  Why are they locked down?
[02:01:54.399 --> 02:01:59.661]  Well, this is actually, in their defense, it is the administrative end of the sheriff's office.
[02:01:59.721 --> 02:01:59.961]  Oh, no.
[02:02:00.061 --> 02:02:01.161]  I mean, that makes sense then.
[02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:01.501]  Okay.
[02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:01.901]  Right.
[02:02:01.981 --> 02:02:02.822]  I was thinking that they'd...
[02:02:03.422 --> 02:02:03.742]  All right.
[02:02:03.923 --> 02:02:06.084]  No, this is the administrative end.
[02:02:06.104 --> 02:02:07.606]  This is where the sheriff's office is.
[02:02:07.626 --> 02:02:07.886]  Oh, thank God.
[02:02:07.926 --> 02:02:10.008]  I thought the police had locked themselves in the building.
[02:02:10.028 --> 02:02:10.908]  We'd really be in trouble.
[02:02:11.009 --> 02:02:13.010]  And that, I didn't want to mislead you.
[02:02:13.391 --> 02:02:16.473]  I'm trying to be as actual and factual as I possibly can.
[02:02:16.513 --> 02:02:19.916]  But you're saying that the city has doubled in size?
[02:02:19.956 --> 02:02:22.518]  That has been on the news several nights in a row.
[02:02:22.558 --> 02:02:24.540]  We have doubled the population of Baton Rouge.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.622]  I have some New Orleans information for you.
[02:02:26.642 --> 02:02:26.982]  Stay there.
[02:02:29.292 --> 02:02:33.537]  J.W., and we'll get to you when we get back, and then we'll talk to Bob and Tim and John, everybody.
[02:02:33.818 --> 02:02:38.984]  But I'm sure callers will understand that people from Louisiana go to the head of the line because they've got information.
[02:02:39.364 --> 02:02:40.606]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:02:40.626 --> 02:02:42.147]  There is so much more coming up.
[02:02:42.428 --> 02:02:43.769]  55 minutes left in the broadcast.
[02:02:43.809 --> 02:02:44.230]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:52.507]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.788 --> 02:02:54.189]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.369 --> 02:02:56.572]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.732 --> 02:02:58.814]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.094 --> 02:03:04.039]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.404]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.624 --> 02:03:10.406]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.486 --> 02:03:21.134]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.294 --> 02:03:23.196]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.396 --> 02:03:27.239]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[02:03:27.359 --> 02:03:28.921]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[02:03:45.899 --> 02:03:54.964]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.224 --> 02:04:06.451]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.791 --> 02:04:12.494]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.734 --> 02:04:19.376]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.596 --> 02:04:26.417]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:26.697 --> 02:04:28.478]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[02:04:28.718 --> 02:04:30.778]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:04:30.999 --> 02:04:33.079]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:04:33.119 --> 02:04:34.019]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.610]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:44.937 --> 02:04:51.439]  I love the new sandal style, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:04:51.659 --> 02:04:55.701]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:04:55.941 --> 02:04:58.101]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:04:58.462 --> 02:05:05.484]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:05.804 --> 02:05:08.405]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:05:08.665 --> 02:05:12.146]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:05:12.446 --> 02:05:20.334]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:20.715 --> 02:05:22.216]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:22.496 --> 02:05:30.725]  You'll find Non-X gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks,
[02:05:31.065 --> 02:05:35.748]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:35.888 --> 02:05:37.929]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.734 --> 02:06:01.638]  Well, on PresidentGlennon.com we have photos of Bush yesterday.
[02:06:01.658 --> 02:06:13.829]  President George W. Bush showing the nation that the notion that not even a major city being entirely submerged can prevent him from getting on with his life.
[02:06:13.949 --> 02:06:16.171]  And yes, this photo was taken just yesterday.
[02:06:16.781 --> 02:06:22.463]  The only image of President Bush I can think of that's more egregiously wrong is this one.
[02:06:23.023 --> 02:06:31.667]  And it's the photo of Bush sitting there for 18 minutes after he got the news of the second plane smashing in to the World Trade Center complex.
[02:06:32.127 --> 02:06:34.748]  And again, it is not a bash Bush theft.
[02:06:35.408 --> 02:06:36.989]  Bush is nothing but a puppet.
[02:06:38.409 --> 02:06:42.951]  And that's why it took him two days to respond to the hurricane.
[02:06:42.971 --> 02:06:43.791]  Really, three days.
[02:06:45.092 --> 02:06:45.732]  That's why it
[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:50.833]  He had to wait to get orders and what to say on 9-11, because he is a puppet.
[02:06:50.874 --> 02:06:52.195]  He's not in control of anything.
[02:06:53.055 --> 02:06:58.160]  I mean, Bill Clinton was a puppet of policy, but he at least got to execute it.
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:00.101]  Same thing with Bush's father.
[02:07:00.962 --> 02:07:08.268]  I mean, he's a puppet of the people that pay him and put him in power and installed him, but he actually got to execute it.
[02:07:09.129 --> 02:07:09.869]  Not with Bush.
[02:07:09.929 --> 02:07:15.414]  I mean, he just takes two naps a day, goes and lifts weights, and rides a bicycle, and plays tennis.
[02:07:16.798 --> 02:07:18.339]  His life is a vacation.
[02:07:19.059 --> 02:07:26.782]  And folks, I feel like I have a responsibility to fight corruption, to inform people, to be informed, to do research, to make films.
[02:07:27.422 --> 02:07:28.843]  I mean, I have no exaggeration.
[02:07:28.903 --> 02:07:31.544]  I've been working about 17 hours a day the last few years.
[02:07:32.264 --> 02:07:33.484]  I feel extremely guilty.
[02:07:33.544 --> 02:07:37.306]  I took off five full days to be with my family last week.
[02:07:37.686 --> 02:07:38.786]  But it was wonderful.
[02:07:39.867 --> 02:07:42.628]  But I'm not a president.
[02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:45.329]  I'm just a radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker.
[02:07:46.701 --> 02:07:57.773]  Imagine, I mean, and just 75, even 50 years ago, you know, when the British went to war, the king, the prince, would have to go be in the front lines.
[02:07:58.633 --> 02:08:00.716]  But a few British nobility were killed in war.
[02:08:00.836 --> 02:08:02.397]  Same thing with the French and the Spanish.
[02:08:03.238 --> 02:08:04.840]  I mean, Santa Ana led his troops.
[02:08:06.127 --> 02:08:06.888]  With the Mexicans.
[02:08:07.108 --> 02:08:08.589]  You don't see that anymore.
[02:08:08.869 --> 02:08:10.911]  I mean, it's just this little cheerleader.
[02:08:11.212 --> 02:08:12.713]  He was a cheerleader, folks.
[02:08:13.313 --> 02:08:17.597]  Who has all these gay porn stars and gay madams in his office.
[02:08:18.578 --> 02:08:20.760]  Prancing around with his little buddies.
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.082]  He's just totally phony, folks.
[02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:25.164]  He's just totally...
[02:08:26.013 --> 02:08:27.394]  He's a tough conservative.
[02:08:27.474 --> 02:08:28.435]  Shut up, Alex!
[02:08:28.795 --> 02:08:30.656]  You must be for them Democrats.
[02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:36.059]  No, I'm against the Democrats who are for the war and for open borders and for all the things Bush is for.
[02:08:38.061 --> 02:08:39.041]  And I'm sick of it!
[02:08:39.722 --> 02:08:43.204]  But just don't tell me everything's okay because George Bush is in there.
[02:08:43.224 --> 02:08:44.665]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and go to your calls.
[02:08:44.685 --> 02:08:44.765]  Just...
[02:08:46.815 --> 02:08:47.296]  J.W.
[02:08:47.336 --> 02:08:54.465]  in Louisiana, you told us about your town that's doubled in size in the last few days, and basically what you called it was lockdown or martial law.
[02:08:54.966 --> 02:09:04.178]  Now tell us about what you've got for us on New Orleans itself, or what I should call New Atlantis, and I mean that seriously.
[02:09:04.705 --> 02:09:09.289]  Okay, uh, my first cousin is involved in the, uh, rescue in New Orleans.
[02:09:09.329 --> 02:09:13.152]  Has been down there, uh, from basically, initially from day one.
[02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:14.013]  Well, God bless him.
[02:09:14.273 --> 02:09:17.616]  He has a, uh, his own personal satellite phone with him.
[02:09:18.536 --> 02:09:21.859]  And, uh, I get a report sometimes twice a day.
[02:09:22.359 --> 02:09:26.763]  He says multiply it times 10, what you're seeing on the national news media.
[02:09:26.803 --> 02:09:30.786]  He said there are pockets of New Orleans that it's only about 80% underwater.
[02:09:32.526 --> 02:09:34.427]  You have areas that are hills.
[02:09:34.587 --> 02:09:35.207]  That's correct.
[02:09:35.227 --> 02:09:47.751]  You have some areas that are high and dry, but you do have people that hold up in the high and dry areas without food, without water, and the looters are trying to overtake the high and dry people.
[02:09:48.271 --> 02:09:51.232]  I'm going to say it again.
[02:09:51.312 --> 02:09:52.773]  Multiply it times ten.
[02:09:53.633 --> 02:09:58.535]  They have been shooting at the helicopters down there a lot longer than it was ever released nationally.
[02:09:59.249 --> 02:10:04.091]  The rescuers... Why on earth would the looters be shooting at helicopters?
[02:10:05.012 --> 02:10:06.412]  I can't answer that question.
[02:10:06.632 --> 02:10:07.413]  I do not know.
[02:10:07.453 --> 02:10:09.274]  Well, look, it's real simple.
[02:10:09.334 --> 02:10:11.014]  They need to go in there and kill those people.
[02:10:11.254 --> 02:10:16.697]  Well, sir, they actually are arming and have been armed
[02:10:17.199 --> 02:10:17.279]  The
[02:10:32.927 --> 02:10:34.828]  You're exactly correct, and that's what's happening.
[02:10:34.908 --> 02:10:42.994]  The Superdome, to my understanding, he hasn't been there personally, because that's not the area he's working in, but he's getting it from the people that he's working with, is that the Superdome is
[02:11:02.606 --> 02:11:06.649]  Indescribably, horribly nasty.
[02:11:06.689 --> 02:11:11.573]  Well, if you've got three days of people defecating and urinating in a small area, it's going to be horrible.
[02:11:11.853 --> 02:11:17.857]  It's my understanding, and there again, I'm not repeating anything that is pretty much not 100% verifiable.
[02:11:18.177 --> 02:11:21.420]  They have been raped in the Superdome, and I'm talking of children.
[02:11:22.561 --> 02:11:26.443]  When they say at night, it was out of control.
[02:11:27.304 --> 02:11:28.805]  I can't emphasize it enough.
[02:11:29.246 --> 02:11:29.806]  He is
[02:11:30.461 --> 02:11:32.743]  Well, they admit there's been a whole bunch of deaths in there.
[02:11:32.863 --> 02:11:34.084]  That is correct.
[02:11:34.184 --> 02:11:40.288]  He's at the point, he's with an agency and I'm not going to name the agency because I don't want to put him in bad light.
[02:11:40.708 --> 02:11:43.610]  But he is to the point that he's going to pull himself out.
[02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:48.233]  It's worse than you can imagine.
[02:11:48.253 --> 02:11:51.495]  But what it sounds like is this could break down the whole state and the whole region.
[02:11:51.716 --> 02:11:57.459]  Well, and I want to give you a heads up on something and I certainly appreciate you folks in Texas.
[02:11:58.652 --> 02:12:16.717]  The mayor of Houston taking on, you know, opening the Superdome to, I'm sorry, the Alaska Dome to our residents, but I don't mean to be, say this in a negative way, but the mayor of Houston, I honestly believe he does not know what he's done.
[02:12:19.423 --> 02:12:20.764]  By that, what do you think it's going to do?
[02:12:20.784 --> 02:12:26.167]  I'm going to tell you, it's going to be an absolute out of control mess.
[02:12:26.247 --> 02:12:28.089]  I don't know how many people... No, no, I agree with you.
[02:12:29.029 --> 02:12:36.154]  I don't know how long you've been listening, JW, but how many times have I said that in the Great Depression, millions of people were homeless.
[02:12:36.835 --> 02:12:44.484]  The bankers engineered it, but you had very little rioting, very little raping and killing, but you still had an increase, and people knew trades.
[02:12:44.544 --> 02:12:46.166]  People, you know, were hardworking.
[02:12:46.686 --> 02:12:53.574]  Now, I've said, imagine these Lexus-driving women, and imagine these inner-city populations, and imagine these yuppies.
[02:12:54.324 --> 02:12:56.045]  They don't know how to do anything.
[02:12:56.085 --> 02:12:58.527]  I mean, you know, it's like the Hank Williams Jr.
[02:12:58.928 --> 02:13:00.789]  song, a country boy can survive.
[02:13:00.849 --> 02:13:01.710]  I can skin a buck.
[02:13:01.770 --> 02:13:02.931]  I can run a trot line.
[02:13:03.291 --> 02:13:05.793]  I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye.
[02:13:07.234 --> 02:13:18.042]  I mean, it's... and I can't hold a candle to my dad that can fix cars and fix machines and, you know, plant a row of corn and, you know, dredge a whatever.
[02:13:18.482 --> 02:13:26.667]  I mean, we're losing these skills, and folks, if we ever have real crises, FEMA isn't going to help you, the government isn't going to help you, you're going to have to help yourself.
[02:13:26.707 --> 02:13:28.288]  And I've already got plans with my family.
[02:13:28.508 --> 02:13:32.451]  The instant there's an emergency or a crisis, we will exit the city.
[02:13:33.658 --> 02:13:37.959]  We will escape from New York, you know, from Austin, Texas, and we're not coming back, folks.
[02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:44.981]  And you better have... I've got maps with side roads and routes, and woe to the people that try to stop me from leaving.
[02:13:45.341 --> 02:13:48.181]  And I've got food, and I've got gold, and I've got guns.
[02:13:48.241 --> 02:13:50.002]  Not a lot of it, but what I need.
[02:13:50.422 --> 02:13:55.483]  And I just can't imagine... I mean, folks, just the... I mean, let's face it.
[02:13:57.927 --> 02:14:03.732]  I mean, if New Orleans would have flooded 50 years ago, this type of thing wouldn't have happened.
[02:14:03.772 --> 02:14:05.414]  We have turned into evil people.
[02:14:05.434 --> 02:14:07.055]  Do you agree with that statement, JW?
[02:14:07.276 --> 02:14:11.199]  Absolutely, and I am one of the be prepared people.
[02:14:11.259 --> 02:14:13.421]  I'm sitting here with everything I need.
[02:14:13.822 --> 02:14:18.066]  I have electricity, thank God, and I had it within 10 hours after the storm.
[02:14:18.406 --> 02:14:20.147]  But it didn't matter.
[02:14:20.348 --> 02:14:21.809]  I can do without air conditioning.
[02:14:22.259 --> 02:14:25.180]  I don't, we're going to survive, but I have what it takes.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:40.945]  And my point, and I'm backing up exactly what you just said, the people who chose to stay in New Orleans had enough advance notice to get something to live for X number of days or a week.
[02:14:41.465 --> 02:14:50.808]  If they chose not to prepare, I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be crude, but you've got to take responsibility for yourself.
[02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:54.793]  Mass hordes of people down there.
[02:14:55.754 --> 02:15:00.358]  Wait till they start finding out how many people are dead in New Orleans from gunshot wounds.
[02:15:00.899 --> 02:15:02.120]  That didn't die in the storm.
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:03.201]  I'm telling you.
[02:15:03.221 --> 02:15:09.647]  They're going to try to demonize the Second Amendment when imagine if you didn't have people with guns in their homes protecting themselves.
[02:15:10.393 --> 02:15:12.074]  But the looters are shooting each other.
[02:15:12.394 --> 02:15:22.941]  I'm telling you, I don't want to take your show over and I know you've got other callers, but I won't call back in the next day or two unless I have verifiable information.
[02:15:22.961 --> 02:15:24.502]  No, I want you to call back and stuff develops.
[02:15:24.542 --> 02:15:25.763]  Thank you for the call, JW.
[02:15:26.364 --> 02:15:27.344]  Go ahead.
[02:15:27.424 --> 02:15:28.045]  I do want it.
[02:15:28.305 --> 02:15:33.468]  If I do choose to call back, I want to have 100% verifiable information.
[02:15:33.508 --> 02:15:36.190]  So if you hear from me again, you know I have some good stuff for you.
[02:15:36.370 --> 02:15:37.011]  Alright, thank you, JW.
[02:15:38.403 --> 02:15:42.646]  Oh man, they're already... I said wait until they start demonizing.
[02:15:42.666 --> 02:15:44.667]  I watched about an hour of TV yesterday.
[02:15:44.687 --> 02:15:48.129]  I was flipping around and every channel was, look what these guns are causing!
[02:15:48.169 --> 02:15:52.792]  Look what these guns are... Huh.
[02:15:52.952 --> 02:15:55.073]  It's always a reason to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:15:55.093 --> 02:16:00.957]  Let me tell you, the Second Amendment is to protect you from corrupt government and from corrupt hordes.
[02:16:02.563 --> 02:16:05.586]  And let me tell you, I was stuck in my house and a bunch of scum wanted to come in it.
[02:16:06.187 --> 02:16:07.488]  I could kill hundreds of them.
[02:16:07.688 --> 02:16:08.809]  I mean, just keep them coming.
[02:16:08.829 --> 02:16:10.411]  I got the ammunition and the guns right here.
[02:16:10.431 --> 02:16:11.893]  Just keep coming through the door.
[02:16:12.253 --> 02:16:13.534]  We'll pile you up out front.
[02:16:13.554 --> 02:16:16.778]  But you kill one or two of these people, they're going to move on to easier targets.
[02:16:17.398 --> 02:16:21.102]  And yeah, they're raping women and just, it's disgusting!
[02:16:22.984 --> 02:16:25.226]  I tell you folks, Americans didn't used to be like this.
[02:16:25.306 --> 02:16:25.967]  I mean, we were just...
[02:16:27.205 --> 02:16:28.466]  We are really evil, folks.
[02:16:28.966 --> 02:16:34.130]  I'm not saying all of us, but I mean there's a big portion of society that are just pretty worse than animals.
[02:16:34.791 --> 02:16:36.492]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[02:16:36.532 --> 02:16:37.273]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:16:37.893 --> 02:16:38.874]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:39.154 --> 02:16:43.337]  I want to congratulate you for bringing on such an excellent guest as Mr. Stevens.
[02:16:44.038 --> 02:16:55.266]  And I was a little distressed yesterday at your kind of terse dismissal that fell at the end of your program, but you came back in great style bringing on Mr. Stevens.
[02:16:55.286 --> 02:16:56.347]  Oh, I don't have any style.
[02:16:56.721 --> 02:17:00.722]  Well anyway, keep your powder dry before this hurricane season is over.
[02:17:01.242 --> 02:17:05.344]  I'm going to wager that the next city that's going to be hit is going to be Houston, Texas.
[02:17:06.344 --> 02:17:12.166]  New Orleans is the opening salvo of the New World Order.
[02:17:12.611 --> 02:17:14.091]  They have started their campaign.
[02:17:14.231 --> 02:17:16.652]  I have studied Mr. Bearden for over 20 years.
[02:17:17.652 --> 02:17:20.073]  It's coming down the road like gangbusters.
[02:17:20.753 --> 02:17:21.053]  I know!
[02:17:22.453 --> 02:17:22.893]  Exactly.
[02:17:22.953 --> 02:17:26.394]  Bearden is really the one that has had a lot of predictions that have come true, unfortunately.
[02:17:26.714 --> 02:17:32.776]  Stay there and I'll let you finish up on the other side briefly, Bob, and then we'll get to Tim and John and Paul and many others.
[02:17:35.636 --> 02:17:37.437]  But, see, Houston isn't under sea level.
[02:17:38.317 --> 02:17:38.517]  So...
[02:17:40.034 --> 02:17:42.196]  It's gonna have to be a hurricane that sits there for a couple weeks.
[02:17:42.516 --> 02:17:43.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.118 --> 02:17:50.482]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of different medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:17:50.722 --> 02:17:52.403]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:17:52.563 --> 02:17:55.245]  Yes, I said drinking water, but not just any water.
[02:17:55.425 --> 02:17:59.728]  You need Electrolyzed Oxidized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[02:17:59.828 --> 02:18:08.995]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:18:09.355 --> 02:18:15.282]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[02:18:15.522 --> 02:18:23.331]  They are also safe and effective for topical treatments of acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burns, skin rashes, and more.

[02:18:45.501 --> 02:18:50.802]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:18:51.002 --> 02:18:53.083]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:18:53.323 --> 02:19:00.425]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:19:00.565 --> 02:19:12.108]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:19:12.488 --> 02:19:13.968]  It's multi-voltage capability
[02:19:13.968 --> 02:19:19.871]  These multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:19:20.132 --> 02:19:25.134]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:19:25.255 --> 02:19:30.277]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:19:30.558 --> 02:19:36.641]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:36.661 --> 02:19:40.704]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:40.984 --> 02:19:41.864]  That's toll free.
[02:19:46.336 --> 02:19:47.576]  Currency devaluation.
[02:19:47.596 --> 02:19:48.197]  Inflation.
[02:19:48.257 --> 02:19:48.777]  One and the same.
[02:19:48.817 --> 02:19:53.219]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:53.259 --> 02:19:55.500]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:56.301]  The bank pays you 1%.
[02:19:56.341 --> 02:19:57.802]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:16.471]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:20.392]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:21.493 --> 02:20:25.174]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:25.915 --> 02:20:30.537]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:20:30.597 --> 02:20:34.859]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:20:34.899 --> 02:20:36.360]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:36.660]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.803 --> 02:20:48.845]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[02:20:49.086 --> 02:20:50.867]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[02:20:51.087 --> 02:20:54.710]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[02:20:55.030 --> 02:21:00.874]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:21:01.014 --> 02:21:06.999]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:21:07.299 --> 02:21:10.980]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:15.962]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[02:21:16.122 --> 02:21:21.123]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[02:21:21.303 --> 02:21:23.684]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[02:21:23.924 --> 02:21:26.805]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[02:21:27.065 --> 02:21:30.309]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.
[02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:31.892]  Try Gano Cafe today.

[02:21:53.504 --> 02:21:54.765]  It shows us anything.
[02:21:54.865 --> 02:22:03.508]  It's the general public, the average citizen that's taking people into their homes and feeding and helping and supporting the rescuers.
[02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:14.512]  And FEMA, even according to the New Orleans Mayor, is screwing everything up, trying to order everyone around with that snake Benjamin Turtoff over Homeland Security.
[02:22:14.532 --> 02:22:16.373]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:22:17.825 --> 02:22:23.709]  You watch, they're going to have all these draconian controls that come out of this, and we can't have another New Orleans.
[02:22:25.410 --> 02:22:30.193]  And Bush will get a boost in his approval rating out of it, even though he ordered the cutting of the funding.
[02:22:31.394 --> 02:22:36.717]  And Houston does flood, and is very low on sea level, just a few feet.
[02:22:37.998 --> 02:22:40.399]  But hurricane season isn't over.
[02:22:40.419 --> 02:22:44.202]  This is an unusually active season, even this new active trend.
[02:22:46.269 --> 02:22:48.150]  But let me ask you a question, Bob.
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:51.372]  I mean, couldn't this just be a real hurricane?
[02:22:51.612 --> 02:23:02.218]  I mean, we had the meteorologist on the last hour who thinks that it's some group, and I have the Secretary of Defense, you know, Cohen, back under Clinton, saying they do have these weapons.
[02:23:03.138 --> 02:23:06.740]  But, I mean, how do we know that this could be some type of organized event?
[02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:09.322]  I mean, I follow your same train of thought.
[02:23:09.582 --> 02:23:11.663]  I am very skeptical and I want to see proof.
[02:23:12.223 --> 02:23:14.925]  But you have to remember, too, Alex, and you know this,
[02:23:15.669 --> 02:23:20.672]  No detective solves a crime by the perpetrator just admitting to it.
[02:23:20.712 --> 02:23:29.298]  He has to chase down clues and evidence and then if he's lucky he will be successful and he will be correct and he will find the person who committed the crime.
[02:23:29.318 --> 02:23:32.300]  Well, I know that the thing can't be ignored out of hand.
[02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:33.761]  No, but you're right.
[02:23:33.801 --> 02:23:40.085]  The patterns are similar and I could see how anybody would believe that these storms are perfectly natural.
[02:23:40.465 --> 02:23:44.368]  But the genesis of Katrina and the other storms
[02:23:46.204 --> 02:23:51.046]  Ivan and these other storms have characteristically different patterns of their genesis.
[02:23:51.847 --> 02:24:10.217]  And one thing that Mr. Stevens may not have had a chance to tell you was that Mr. Bearden disclosed that there were two friendly nations, he didn't name them, that have these devices, that they have used them before to assist us, and I'm not talking about the neocon America,
[02:24:10.922 --> 02:24:12.643]  The upper crust, plutocratic America.
[02:24:12.663 --> 02:24:15.225]  I'm talking about the American middle class, the heart of America.
[02:24:15.946 --> 02:24:20.329]  And I think I saw a battle going on on that storm.
[02:24:20.609 --> 02:24:31.777]  You remember, you were talking about it yesterday, how they were building up the disaster that this storm was going to bring, and then it seemed like an anticlimactic thing, and it didn't seem like it was going to be all that bad.
[02:24:32.117 --> 02:24:36.240]  And then after the fact, then they said, well, it's worse than we even thought.
[02:24:38.556 --> 02:24:44.299]  Did you know that the chemtrail patterns have moderated in Texas, especially over Austin?
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:46.481]  I live out in Wembley to the west of you.
[02:24:46.501 --> 02:24:47.841]  Yeah, there haven't been as much.
[02:24:48.041 --> 02:24:49.342]  Well, let me tell you what they're doing.
[02:24:49.382 --> 02:24:50.343]  I watch them every night.
[02:24:50.583 --> 02:24:51.683]  There's a dozen planes.
[02:24:52.364 --> 02:24:54.405]  And they lay the trails down where I live.
[02:24:54.965 --> 02:24:56.326]  And they're doing it at night now.
[02:24:56.646 --> 02:25:00.648]  Because I know all the traffic patterns for San Antonio and Austin and this whole general area.
[02:25:00.989 --> 02:25:03.290]  And I watch them every night laying down their trails.
[02:25:04.249 --> 02:25:09.150]  So, another thing about New Orleans, what's going to happen when these people can't pay their property taxes?
[02:25:09.511 --> 02:25:11.151]  Who's going to scoop up that property?
[02:25:12.151 --> 02:25:20.774]  And maybe that's when they'll pump it out and say, well, we can salvage the city after all, after they've scooped up everybody's property, because they can't pay their property taxes.
[02:25:20.814 --> 02:25:21.574]  There's no job.
[02:25:21.854 --> 02:25:23.495]  There's no way for them to recover.
[02:25:23.615 --> 02:25:26.276]  Oh, I bet you in a year they're not going to forgive property tax.
[02:25:26.296 --> 02:25:27.456]  They're not going to forgive anything.
[02:25:28.156 --> 02:25:31.077]  Well, I'm making a wager that Houston's going to be next.
[02:25:33.656 --> 02:25:34.677]  We'll see if you're right, Bob.
[02:25:34.697 --> 02:25:35.538]  Thanks for calling.
[02:25:35.858 --> 02:25:36.559]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:38.440]  Who's up next here?
[02:25:39.702 --> 02:25:41.203]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:25:41.283 --> 02:25:41.743]  Go ahead.
[02:25:42.824 --> 02:25:43.465]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:25:43.765 --> 02:25:44.146]  Hi, buddy.
[02:25:44.406 --> 02:25:52.293]  You said something earlier when you were talking to Scott Stevens that really got me to thinking about when you said they were like totally descending into anarchism.
[02:25:53.214 --> 02:25:57.838]  Now, it almost seems like they are intentionally
[02:25:58.464 --> 02:26:02.967]  The difference is they had time to plan it, and execute it, and
[02:26:24.099 --> 02:26:27.200]  That's a very corrupt city, a large criminal element.
[02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:28.341]  I mean, you heard the caller earlier.
[02:26:28.381 --> 02:26:43.186]  It's true that routinely, you know, Chicago and New Orleans vie for the murder capital, for the crown, and there is a very large criminal element that just as soon kill you as look at you.
[02:26:44.007 --> 02:26:48.528]  And the police are very corrupt, you know, predominantly, and only seem to care about themselves.
[02:26:49.109 --> 02:26:50.409]  I mean, that's not a stretch, folks.
[02:26:50.449 --> 02:26:52.710]  Everybody knows New Orleans is about as corrupt as it gets.
[02:26:53.656 --> 02:26:56.477]  And, uh, I mean, it's just a disaster.
[02:26:56.537 --> 02:26:58.758]  I mean, government cannot deal with something this big.
[02:26:58.778 --> 02:26:59.698]  They never can.
[02:26:59.718 --> 02:27:00.479]  They never will.
[02:27:00.499 --> 02:27:10.922]  Uh, only, the only time governments can deal with this is if they've got a trained citizen, uh, civil emergency militia.
[02:27:11.183 --> 02:27:17.265]  One more thing that's interesting, they're taking them to Texas where they openly said yesterday they'll bring them into the education system.
[02:27:17.665 --> 02:27:22.847]  And isn't that a good place to have a bunch of stressed kids in the T-MAP system where they can get them all on these SSRIs?
[02:27:24.295 --> 02:27:27.138]  Oh yeah, the globalists will have a field day because that's what they are.
[02:27:27.178 --> 02:27:28.379]  They're carrion eaters.
[02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:34.506]  The globalists are opportunistic parasites and they eat rotten societies.
[02:27:36.108 --> 02:27:36.989]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.489 --> 02:27:39.091]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.012 --> 02:27:42.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:52.702]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.922 --> 02:27:57.944]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.264 --> 02:28:06.167]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.307 --> 02:28:13.350]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:14.791]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.931 --> 02:28:18.332]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.392 --> 02:28:19.513]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.793 --> 02:28:21.073]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.273 --> 02:28:28.096]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:28.216 --> 02:28:30.718]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:34.139 --> 02:28:35.202]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:45.962 --> 02:28:47.583]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.703 --> 02:28:51.826]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.946 --> 02:28:54.827]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.907 --> 02:29:01.632]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.812 --> 02:29:04.814]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.014 --> 02:29:07.415]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.535 --> 02:29:15.440]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:27.003]  Capazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.163 --> 02:29:34.785]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:34.825 --> 02:29:35.126]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.146 --> 02:29:37.126]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:47.777 --> 02:29:54.646]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:54.906 --> 02:29:57.289]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:57.529 --> 02:29:59.472]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:29:59.812 --> 02:30:05.179]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:05.559 --> 02:30:09.842]  The keychain-attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:30:10.282 --> 02:30:18.187]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day, with its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:30:18.367 --> 02:30:23.411]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:30:23.451 --> 02:30:25.452]  military and numerous other government agencies.

[02:30:47.194 --> 02:30:52.358]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:53.019 --> 02:30:55.361]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.182 --> 02:31:01.566]  There's a certain morbid fascination that I think a lot of people are showing.
[02:31:02.026 --> 02:31:03.447]  Almost like it's an entertainment.
[02:31:05.209 --> 02:31:13.736]  This spectacle we're seeing, this spectacle of calamity that we're witnessing unfold in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[02:31:15.339 --> 02:31:16.599]  I have nothing but foreboding.
[02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:21.880]  Everything's an atmosphere of martial law the last six months.
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:22.881]  Martial law's coming.
[02:31:22.921 --> 02:31:23.581]  It's good.
[02:31:23.621 --> 02:31:24.741]  It's for your own good.
[02:31:27.021 --> 02:31:29.882]  Like clockwork, the crises that are needed come along.
[02:31:30.362 --> 02:31:34.383]  The 7-7 bombings, which the evidence totally documents was an inside job.
[02:31:34.403 --> 02:31:36.863]  9-11 and just all of it.
[02:31:38.584 --> 02:31:39.764]  All the things that are happening.
[02:31:41.144 --> 02:31:46.347]  We're not talking about the Iraq War and the roadside bombings and the thousands of dead troops now.
[02:31:49.628 --> 02:32:02.074]  We've got to look at all the other things that are happening while we're busy, focused, and I think we should be focused, on the tragic events that are taking place in Louisiana and Mississippi.
[02:32:02.814 --> 02:32:10.218]  But a city underwater, predominantly underwater, 80% of it underwater, dead bodies floating around, sharks feeding on them,
[02:32:11.181 --> 02:32:13.542]  Armed bands of criminals running around.
[02:32:13.562 --> 02:32:16.143]  It's just horrible.
[02:32:16.543 --> 02:32:23.105]  And there's your precious government that didn't repair the dikes.
[02:32:23.725 --> 02:32:26.346]  Their own FEMA report said it would devastate the city.
[02:32:26.766 --> 02:32:27.886]  Some reports were even worse.
[02:32:28.106 --> 02:32:28.967]  500,000 dead.
[02:32:30.967 --> 02:32:32.308]  And the government cut the funding.
[02:32:33.688 --> 02:32:34.568]  Down to almost nothing.
[02:32:35.329 --> 02:32:36.729]  And Bush won't get in trouble for that.
[02:32:37.631 --> 02:32:42.937]  People keep saying terrorists are coming across the border with suitcase nukes and we're going to get nuked.
[02:32:42.977 --> 02:32:44.018]  Chertoff has been saying it.
[02:32:47.771 --> 02:33:03.738]  People like Dick Cheney saying it, and then Pabbie Cannon comes out and others come out and go, well, if there is a terrorist attack or if a bunch of terrorists that came across the southern border take over the school and kill a bunch of kids, which the FBI is saying they've got intelligence on, Black Bush will be impeached!
[02:33:03.778 --> 02:33:04.598]  It'll be his fault!
[02:33:04.939 --> 02:33:05.219]  No!
[02:33:05.279 --> 02:33:06.159]  He won't be impeached!
[02:33:06.179 --> 02:33:14.903]  He'll be there on the scene and you'll worship him and his approval rating will go up and thank God we've got George Bush on the job, leaving the border wide open.
[02:33:16.502 --> 02:33:20.464]  There is a disconnect with reality, with so many people out there.
[02:33:22.504 --> 02:33:34.568]  And, you know, gas prices at $6 a gallon in Atlanta, Georgia, and going over $3 on average in the rest of the country, and oil at $75 a barrel.
[02:33:34.628 --> 02:33:37.329]  I mean, this is serious business.
[02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:43.651]  Alright, we're going to go to somebody who's been holding for eons, John in Ohio, and then
[02:33:44.685 --> 02:34:10.521]  Paul and Ron and a few others and I've got some other a few little news items I haven't hit on yet in the last 25 minutes we've got left here but a few months ago I had Ted Anderson on the show and he's the owner of Midas Resources but also is the owner of the GCN Radio Network and he has poured his heart, his soul, his treasure into this network that has really become successful in the last few years.
[02:34:10.581 --> 02:34:13.623]  I mean we are reaching so many people, we have so many new affiliates
[02:34:14.715 --> 02:34:24.883]  It's nothing less than miraculous, I mean, that so many stations will put us on the air and let us tell the truth, but we've proven that we've got a good track record and that we're not just shooting our mouths off.
[02:34:25.443 --> 02:34:32.748]  The truth is stranger than fiction, but I had him on a few months ago and, you know, he was saying, gold is kind of low right now, you might want to buy some.
[02:34:32.768 --> 02:34:36.671]  You know, inflation's out of control, the housing bubble's in trouble.
[02:34:37.752 --> 02:34:43.316]  You know, now is the time to buy a commodity that isn't fiat, that cannot be devalued down to nothing.
[02:34:45.393 --> 02:34:52.418]  And, uh, Ted has gold that was purchased last week by Midas at last week's prices.
[02:34:53.238 --> 02:34:55.700]  Yes, he's selling it at last week's prices.
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.462]  I mean, I challenge you to find it lower.
[02:34:59.262 --> 02:35:06.267]  And, uh, this is it for now, because gold is up by, what, $10 an ounce, which is a huge move in just the last few days.
[02:35:06.967 --> 02:35:11.750]  And so we're going to spend a few minutes with Ted Anderson, and he's got $5 gold pieces, which are very affordable.
[02:35:12.491 --> 02:35:14.052]  You know, half ounces of gold.
[02:35:15.021 --> 02:35:18.164]  Hey Alex, it's great to be back up again and you're talking about the gold.
[02:35:18.184 --> 02:35:20.146]  I was talking to a farmer here just earlier.
[02:35:20.186 --> 02:35:22.748]  Up in the Midwest, how is this
[02:35:43.163 --> 02:35:44.863]  But the media says there's no inflation!
[02:36:06.629 --> 02:36:21.185]  Well, they can say what they want, and the Consumer Price Index right now, they're trying to keep that down, because that keeps a cap on all the retirees that are drawn from Social Security, and all the pension plans for the government, working employees, the military, and so on.
[02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:22.627]  And that thing is a complete fraud!
[02:36:23.007 --> 02:36:29.351]  Oh, the whole thing is just all smoke and mirrors, but you're talking about the gold coins, and we do.
[02:36:29.711 --> 02:36:34.174]  We've got $5 gold pieces right now that are just at a fabulous buying opportunity.
[02:36:34.774 --> 02:36:46.261]  Obviously, I feel very sad about the people that are getting hurt down there with the hurricane, but it's affecting the United States and it's moving like a rash through the entire nation.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.603]  You need to have insurance on your portfolio at this time.
[02:36:51.643 --> 02:36:54.245]  You need to have monetary insurance.
[02:36:54.285 --> 02:36:55.306]  And that's what gold is.
[02:36:55.967 --> 02:36:59.710]  And the $5 gold pieces are so nice because they're smaller, they're portable.
[02:37:00.490 --> 02:37:01.791]  It's a great way to have gold.
[02:37:01.851 --> 02:37:05.774]  Right now, currently we have them for $165 a coin.
[02:37:06.475 --> 02:37:09.537]  And if you take them up to the roll, that's $3,300 per roll.
[02:37:10.678 --> 02:37:12.700]  Obviously the prices are increasing in gold.
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:15.562]  When the supply gets sold out, these prices will increase as well.
[02:37:16.184 --> 02:37:20.105]  But the thing about it right now is that you can see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:37:20.405 --> 02:37:21.666]  We have inflation here.
[02:37:21.686 --> 02:37:25.987]  This fiat currency is being tested to the furthest extent.
[02:37:26.107 --> 02:37:27.607]  Foreigners don't like to have U.S.
[02:37:27.647 --> 02:37:28.428]  dollars anymore.
[02:37:28.448 --> 02:37:29.348]  They're dumping it.
[02:37:29.868 --> 02:37:35.650]  Major publications are saying we could have an economic September 11th if the dollar continues to get dumped, which it is.
[02:37:37.881 --> 02:37:42.004]  Folks, I feel really good about promoting high quality water filters made in America.
[02:37:42.525 --> 02:37:46.147]  I feel really good about promoting what supports my show, my documentary films.
[02:37:46.688 --> 02:37:52.192]  I feel really good about promoting high quality gold at a very good price.
[02:37:52.572 --> 02:37:54.033]  Well, that's the point Alex.
[02:37:54.093 --> 02:38:10.541]  I mean, a lot of people really appreciate what's being done here with your show, the entire Genesis Communications Network, and there is no way that you can support this network better than to be supporting Midas Resources, because Midas Resources has been the backbone of this network.
[02:38:10.642 --> 02:38:20.867]  One of the reasons why we've been successful is because Midas Resources has stood behind this network 100% through the thick and the thin, and it's been pretty thin sometimes.
[02:38:21.684 --> 02:38:28.370]  So, yeah, if you have the ability to do something at this point, it makes perfect economic sense to be getting in gold at this particular moment.
[02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:29.952]  Now, what are these $5 pieces?
[02:38:30.032 --> 02:38:30.773]  Are they American?
[02:38:31.053 --> 02:38:32.554]  Yeah, these are U.S.
[02:38:32.854 --> 02:38:34.256]  $5 American gold pieces.
[02:38:34.296 --> 02:38:41.102]  They're made right here in the good ol' USA, and it's a perfect way to get something that's private, portable.
[02:38:41.442 --> 02:38:47.368]  Like I said, they're encapsulated in the United States government holders that they originally made them in.
[02:38:47.728 --> 02:38:49.931]  They're all in really perfect shape.
[02:38:49.971 --> 02:38:53.354]  It's a great way to get involved with the precious metals.
[02:38:53.615 --> 02:38:54.335]  $165 a coin.
[02:38:54.656 --> 02:38:57.018]  Most anybody out there can afford to pick up one of those.
[02:38:57.098 --> 02:39:00.001]  It's like filling your tank with gas nowadays.
[02:39:00.562 --> 02:39:01.263]  Absolutely.
[02:39:01.643 --> 02:39:05.687]  And it's $3300 for a roll of what?
[02:39:05.708 --> 02:39:05.687]  $20?
[02:39:05.808 --> 02:39:06.629]  For a roll of $20.
[02:39:07.149 --> 02:39:08.310]  And here's how you get them.
[02:39:08.350 --> 02:39:08.791]  You call 1-800
[02:39:10.927 --> 02:39:22.234]  686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237 I know that everybody out there right now is thinking about what's going to happen to my financial situation
[02:39:23.418 --> 02:39:26.540]  If you've been thinking about precious metals and you sure certainly should be.
[02:39:27.001 --> 02:39:28.962]  Right now is the time.
[02:39:28.982 --> 02:39:29.542]  Absolutely.
[02:39:29.582 --> 02:39:33.165]  Folks, give Ted a call.
[02:39:33.185 --> 02:39:33.345]  800-686-2237.
[02:39:34.065 --> 02:39:35.987]  So the brokers know what special it is.
[02:39:36.027 --> 02:39:37.327]  Tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:39:37.347 --> 02:39:41.290]  Yeah, just say, mention the Alex Jones special that you'd like to have those $5 gold pieces at $165 or $3,300 a roll.
[02:39:44.532 --> 02:39:45.553]  What are the supplies, Ted?
[02:40:05.114 --> 02:40:07.355]  You know, you're having trouble getting gold right now.
[02:40:07.395 --> 02:40:08.556]  You've got this in stock.
[02:40:08.916 --> 02:40:12.658]  Folks, you need to take advantage of this 800-686-2237.
[02:40:12.698 --> 02:40:14.539]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[02:40:14.719 --> 02:40:15.800]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:16.340]  You bet.
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:20.862]  Or you can go to MyersResources.com or GCMLive.com and all those phone numbers are right there.
[02:40:21.282 --> 02:40:28.306]  And I mean, look, folks, Ted supports the network, I mean, for the last six years since he started the network.
[02:40:32.216 --> 02:40:38.381]  This is a great price on the gold, and that's why I asked her to come on, because it's pre-hurricane crisis.
[02:40:39.301 --> 02:40:42.464]  And look, when gold goes up, I don't sell my gold.
[02:40:44.525 --> 02:40:48.088]  I don't go get it out of the safety deposit box and sell it.
[02:40:48.868 --> 02:40:51.730]  And when it goes down, I don't go, ooh, it's gone down, I'm going to sell it.
[02:40:52.651 --> 02:40:57.475]  Because it only fluctuates so much, and it's only been trending upwards the last few years.
[02:40:59.196 --> 02:41:00.557]  It's just an insurance policy.
[02:41:01.681 --> 02:41:04.563]  Frankly, I should put more in the limited cash I've got in the bank.
[02:41:06.385 --> 02:41:08.907]  I've got a little bit of money, you know, for college for my children.
[02:41:09.427 --> 02:41:12.329]  And I thought, you know, why do I even have that in the bank?
[02:41:12.369 --> 02:41:14.851]  I mean, I'm just so busy, I don't call Ted up and buy gold.
[02:41:16.273 --> 02:41:16.713]  I need to.
[02:41:16.793 --> 02:41:17.694]  I need to do that today.
[02:41:17.914 --> 02:41:20.116]  I need to, you know, take advantage of it.
[02:41:23.744 --> 02:41:26.046]  Gold may go down next week or it may go up next week.
[02:41:26.066 --> 02:41:26.807]  It doesn't matter.
[02:41:26.887 --> 02:41:28.128]  Gold is real, folks.
[02:41:28.488 --> 02:41:31.771]  They can devalue those Federal Reserve notes to nothing overnight.
[02:41:32.131 --> 02:41:33.372]  Give them a call 800-686-2237.
[02:41:36.775 --> 02:41:37.255]  Don't wait.
[02:41:37.275 --> 02:41:38.216]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:41:38.316 --> 02:41:40.218]  Get prepared.
[02:41:40.238 --> 02:41:40.278]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:44.061]  Okay, let's go to John in Ohio.
[02:41:44.101 --> 02:41:44.961]  Thanks for holding, John.
[02:41:45.021 --> 02:41:45.382]  Go ahead.
[02:41:47.844 --> 02:41:48.124]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:48.144 --> 02:41:48.484]  Go ahead.
[02:41:48.504 --> 02:41:49.725]  Can you hear me?
[02:41:49.905 --> 02:41:50.306]  Yes, I can.
[02:41:50.805 --> 02:41:52.326]  Well, it's a pleasure talking to you.
[02:41:52.627 --> 02:41:53.727]  Nice to talk to you, my friend.
[02:41:53.747 --> 02:41:54.288]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:54.308 --> 02:41:54.648]  Go ahead.
[02:41:54.808 --> 02:41:55.589]  Good.
[02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:56.570]  You know what they're doing?
[02:41:56.610 --> 02:42:00.953]  They're setting a good stage here for foreign troops to come into this country, don't you?
[02:42:02.194 --> 02:42:05.217]  Well, I know a few more things like this, or there could be a chain reaction.
[02:42:05.257 --> 02:42:08.199]  I mean, look, they're openly on TV talking about foreign asses.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:16.225]  For one, they do not want to send any foreign troops over here with helmets searching my streets, because we're all going to be dead.
[02:42:16.926 --> 02:42:18.808]  That's my opinion, okay?
[02:42:19.388 --> 02:42:20.489]  But what you're doing, you're
[02:42:20.922 --> 02:42:29.069]  Well, what this country is doing is they're letting a president with the mind of an 8 or 10 year old kid with his hands on a nuke.
[02:42:29.129 --> 02:42:29.510]  Period.
[02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:30.350]  That's what he's doing.
[02:42:30.991 --> 02:42:33.573]  And he's not worried about the people down here in Louisiana.
[02:42:34.053 --> 02:42:37.837]  He's more worried about his oil over there in Iraq.
[02:42:38.778 --> 02:42:39.098]  Comment?
[02:42:39.884 --> 02:42:40.604]  No, I agree.
[02:42:40.644 --> 02:42:42.665]  Securing those trillions of dollars of oil.
[02:42:42.705 --> 02:42:45.165]  I mean, Dick Cheney said so in his own PMAG document.
[02:42:45.745 --> 02:42:49.386]  He's too busy wanting blanket amnesty and telling the Border Patrol to stand down.
[02:42:49.406 --> 02:42:53.427]  He's too busy trying to get the assault weapons ban passed and reauthorized.
[02:42:53.807 --> 02:42:55.667]  He's too busy signing on to UNESCO.
[02:42:55.707 --> 02:42:59.588]  He's too busy signing the New Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing and drugging.
[02:42:59.968 --> 02:43:03.469]  He's too busy passing the National ID Card.
[02:43:04.129 --> 02:43:06.930]  He's too busy militarizing and federalizing our police.
[02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:08.911]  Well, I don't think he's doing all that.
[02:43:08.971 --> 02:43:13.094]  I think he's got to have somebody do all the sign and form because I don't think he's intelligent enough to do it.
[02:43:13.174 --> 02:43:14.395]  Oh, obviously, sir.
[02:43:14.415 --> 02:43:18.758]  When we talk about... I appreciate you saying... When we talk about Bush, we're talking about the figurehead.
[02:43:19.839 --> 02:43:23.621]  I mean, obviously, Bush literally has trouble wiping his own nose.
[02:43:24.261 --> 02:43:28.004]  Well, I think his father's wiping it for him.
[02:43:28.024 --> 02:43:29.845]  That's a very intelligent individual, yes.
[02:43:31.066 --> 02:43:35.229]  Bush really is close... You know, I've said before that he's not really retarded.
[02:43:35.994 --> 02:43:41.556]  I mean, I've seen him give speeches in Texas where, at a certain sneaky, spontaneous level, he's smart.
[02:43:42.276 --> 02:43:47.478]  But when he's being handled, when they're telling him everything he's got to say, he's not a good actor.
[02:43:49.178 --> 02:43:50.599]  And he just doesn't have the skills.
[02:43:50.819 --> 02:43:51.419]  Definitely not.
[02:43:52.519 --> 02:43:57.221]  And I know you're busy down there in Louisiana, and they've got a lot more information for you.
[02:43:58.161 --> 02:44:00.542]  So I'm going to get off quick, but I've got a lot more for you.
[02:44:00.582 --> 02:44:02.442]  Maybe tomorrow or the next day I'll call you back.
[02:44:02.642 --> 02:44:03.823]  Okay, well God bless you, John.
[02:44:03.843 --> 02:44:04.743]  I appreciate the call.
[02:44:05.430 --> 02:44:06.690]  Thank you for holding patiently.
[02:44:06.851 --> 02:44:08.011]  Paul in Indiana.
[02:44:08.031 --> 02:44:08.651]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:44:08.951 --> 02:44:09.351]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:09.371 --> 02:44:10.072]  How are you doing?
[02:44:10.372 --> 02:44:10.552]  Good.
[02:44:11.032 --> 02:44:12.993]  A couple questions for you quickly.
[02:44:13.433 --> 02:44:19.135]  You talked about the funding for the levy system in Louisiana being lashed.
[02:44:19.835 --> 02:44:21.135]  How do I get that information?
[02:44:21.195 --> 02:44:23.916]  Because people don't believe you until you can show them something.
[02:44:23.936 --> 02:44:26.037]  Well, I mean, have you been to prisonplanet.com?
[02:44:27.051 --> 02:44:28.712]  I've been on InfoWars.
[02:44:28.732 --> 02:44:29.813]  I haven't been on Prison Planet.
[02:44:29.833 --> 02:44:31.033]  Well, it should be on InfoWars.
[02:44:31.114 --> 02:44:32.474]  I saw it being updated.
[02:44:33.335 --> 02:44:35.736]  Let me dig it out.
[02:44:35.796 --> 02:44:37.577]  Who opened the floodgates is the headline.
[02:44:37.978 --> 02:44:40.319]  And the whole article is linked to FEMA statements.
[02:44:40.919 --> 02:44:46.243]  The whole article is linked to statements a year or two years ago by New Orleans newspapers.
[02:44:47.343 --> 02:44:48.804]  But, I mean, it's all right there.
[02:44:48.824 --> 02:44:51.906]  FEMA complained in 2002 and said, what are you doing?
[02:44:52.626 --> 02:44:54.047]  The local FEMA people aren't bad.
[02:44:54.087 --> 02:44:54.928]  It's the higher-ups.
[02:44:55.635 --> 02:44:56.796]  We've got to repair these.
[02:44:57.056 --> 02:45:00.819]  If there's even a glancing blow, the city will be underwater.
[02:45:00.859 --> 02:45:05.083]  I mean, we'll equalize with Pontchartrain, the lake.
[02:45:05.103 --> 02:45:08.485]  People need to know about that, that's for sure.
[02:45:08.826 --> 02:45:16.472]  Well, finally, it has been picked up by Salon, which is pretty mainstream, Salon.com.
[02:45:16.512 --> 02:45:23.337]  It has been picked up by Yahoo, and I did see a mention of it on CNN's website with a mayor complaining.
[02:45:24.525 --> 02:45:28.970]  Second question is the martial law in New Orleans.
[02:45:29.710 --> 02:45:31.773]  Is that just for New Orleans or was that for the whole state?
[02:45:31.793 --> 02:45:32.794]  No, that was the whole state.
[02:45:32.834 --> 02:45:36.437]  They announced that Tuesday on CBS News, we have that headline.
[02:45:36.778 --> 02:45:38.580]  Then they said, oh no, that's a rumor.
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:40.421]  Well, they declared it.
[02:45:40.642 --> 02:45:41.463]  How is that a rumor?
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:43.720]  That's pretty funny.
[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:46.022]  And I think that's because that term scared people.
[02:45:46.222 --> 02:45:46.542]  Yeah.
[02:45:46.702 --> 02:45:48.283]  They were trying to test that term.
[02:45:48.623 --> 02:45:50.564]  So what does martial law exactly mean?
[02:45:50.604 --> 02:46:00.710]  I mean, you lose basically all your... Martial law means the military is in executive control and local government is removed and basically troops on the streets shooting whoever they want.
[02:46:00.730 --> 02:46:01.811]  And, uh...
[02:46:04.989 --> 02:46:06.410]  Again, there's a science to this.
[02:46:06.470 --> 02:46:13.233]  If the police would have been rolled in instantly, if they would have dealt harshly with looters immediately, I mean, they have handbooks on this.
[02:46:13.294 --> 02:46:14.174]  They know what they're doing.
[02:46:14.634 --> 02:46:15.615]  None of this would have happened.
[02:46:15.635 --> 02:46:26.661]  But instead, they held back, they drew back, they let the looters do what they want, and now it is spiraling out of control, which is good for the globalists, problem-reaction solution, they get to bring in even more firepower.
[02:46:26.681 --> 02:46:30.483]  Yeah, I mean, common sense is they should have had people in there right away.
[02:46:31.603 --> 02:46:32.684]  But they didn't do that.
[02:46:33.624 --> 02:46:43.728]  Well, my experience is when there's a crisis, the firefighters run out to face it, and the police all get called into briefing rooms and cower in fear with their knees knocking.
[02:46:44.348 --> 02:46:46.949]  And I'm sorry, I mean, I'm talking over and over again.
[02:46:47.469 --> 02:46:49.170]  We saw that, and we've seen that.
[02:46:49.290 --> 02:46:53.491]  I mean, you know, the riots, you know, the riots going back into the 60s.
[02:46:54.352 --> 02:46:57.653]  We've seen that with, remember Columbine?
[02:46:57.733 --> 02:47:01.795]  Four hours, 15 minutes, sitting outside, so afraid.
[02:47:04.662 --> 02:47:07.423]  Because now the whole culture is about protecting themselves.
[02:47:07.463 --> 02:47:09.264]  See, they're numero uno.
[02:47:10.884 --> 02:47:12.205]  And I'm not bashing the police.
[02:47:12.325 --> 02:47:22.528]  It shifted from, they're protectors of life, they are the real men, they're macho, they're tough, to they're hiding in black masks and black helmets shaking in the corner.
[02:47:22.568 --> 02:47:23.189]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.569]  Yep.
[02:47:23.929 --> 02:47:26.290]  I mean, it's just all about, you know, protecting themselves.
[02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:27.670]  Ron in Missouri.
[02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:28.671]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:28.731 --> 02:47:29.051]  Welcome.
[02:47:31.612 --> 02:47:32.172]  Ron hung up?
[02:47:33.749 --> 02:47:34.529]  Who's up next then?
[02:47:38.590 --> 02:47:40.391]  Rick in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:41.051 --> 02:47:42.131]  This is Rick from Texas.
[02:47:42.371 --> 02:47:42.992]  Uh-huh, go ahead.
[02:47:44.032 --> 02:47:47.793]  Did you see the picture of Bush playing a guitar in the paper?
[02:47:49.233 --> 02:47:51.614]  He was playing an acoustic guitar.
[02:47:51.814 --> 02:47:54.515]  Yeah, he said, why should I let this get in the way of my life?
[02:47:54.535 --> 02:47:57.135]  That's what he said to Sonny Sheehan.
[02:47:57.155 --> 02:48:02.257]  The guy literally just dilly-dallies and works out all day so his boyfriends think he's handsome.
[02:48:03.533 --> 02:48:12.137]  Doesn't that remind you of someone that... a Roman dictator named Nero who played... You know, I didn't put the two and two together.
[02:48:12.157 --> 02:48:14.478]  And we've got to put a blurb up there.
[02:48:14.598 --> 02:48:16.779]  Is Nero fiddled while Rome flooded?
[02:48:18.039 --> 02:48:18.680]  Yeah, you should.
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:21.601]  Anything else, that's a good point you just made.
[02:48:21.621 --> 02:48:23.542]  This is just judgment, I'm telling you.
[02:48:24.482 --> 02:48:30.745]  That we have such a stupid man, such an evil man that the church grovels over while God himself is punishing us.
[02:48:30.765 --> 02:48:32.926]  But aren't people who have boyfriends of the Lord?
[02:48:34.466 --> 02:48:35.267]  Uh, not if they're men.
[02:48:36.047 --> 02:48:36.207]  Oh.
[02:48:38.188 --> 02:48:38.309]  Oh.
[02:48:39.109 --> 02:48:41.170]  What's wrong with male porn stars in the White House?
[02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:43.452]  Anyway, stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[02:48:46.934 --> 02:48:49.816]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.056 --> 02:48:51.637]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.977 --> 02:48:56.660]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.001 --> 02:49:03.705]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.045 --> 02:49:06.027]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.227 --> 02:49:09.070]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.170 --> 02:49:13.814]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.034 --> 02:49:18.458]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.678 --> 02:49:25.905]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.165 --> 02:49:28.587]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.747 --> 02:49:30.489]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.244 --> 02:49:51.467]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.627 --> 02:49:59.712]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.973 --> 02:50:08.478]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.558 --> 02:50:14.460]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:19.722]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:28.725]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.985 --> 02:50:35.848]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[02:50:44.015 --> 02:50:53.243]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.464 --> 02:50:55.726]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.906 --> 02:51:02.272]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.632 --> 02:51:03.012]  I think so.
[02:51:22.927 --> 02:51:23.307]  I think so.
[02:51:49.472 --> 02:52:02.221]  Alright, we'll take a few final calls here, let Rick and James have their say.
[02:52:04.723 --> 02:52:15.651]  And we'll continue here on the network, on the GCN Radio Network, and of course on our other fine affiliates out there, to cover what's happening with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
[02:52:16.502 --> 02:52:23.864]  But remember, we've got to also keep our eyes out for all the other things that are happening while we're busy being distracted by this event.
[02:52:25.525 --> 02:52:35.688]  Because, what, four days after 9-11, Bush moved to let the Communist Chinese join permanent member status in the World Trade Organization.
[02:52:36.348 --> 02:52:37.749]  Just a bunch of other stuff happened.
[02:52:38.489 --> 02:52:42.910]  And there is a lot going on right now that we need to be aware of.
[02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:45.551]  Rick in Texas, finish up what you were saying, my friend.
[02:52:46.658 --> 02:52:56.003]  Well, I think this hurricane, I understand the government could do probably some weather modification, but I think something like this hurricane was a judgment from the Lord.
[02:52:57.083 --> 02:52:57.704]  You know what I think?
[02:52:57.764 --> 02:53:08.589]  I think we've got to stick to what we know, and we know that big hurricanes have hit there before, and that's why I'm saying that I don't have evidence that it's some group.
[02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:11.411]  Is there weather modification and weather control?
[02:53:11.491 --> 02:53:11.811]  Yes.
[02:53:12.475 --> 02:53:15.997]  Is it as powerful as the meteorologist says that we had on earlier?
[02:53:16.117 --> 02:53:16.577]  I don't know.
[02:53:16.677 --> 02:53:17.117]  I doubt it.
[02:53:17.598 --> 02:53:19.218]  But again, I'm not a meteorologist.
[02:53:20.859 --> 02:53:22.120]  I think we're under judgment.
[02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:23.941]  I think the church is asleep and dead.
[02:53:24.281 --> 02:53:27.282]  I think God is trying to wake people up.
[02:53:27.402 --> 02:53:29.023]  You've got to find Jesus personally.
[02:53:29.383 --> 02:53:30.364]  No, I agree with you.
[02:53:30.764 --> 02:53:32.925]  I mean, certainly we are a corrupt, evil country.
[02:53:33.385 --> 02:53:36.387]  That doesn't mean we're all bad and the country is bad itself.
[02:53:36.427 --> 02:53:39.548]  It's just that we have become very, very evil predominantly.
[02:53:40.329 --> 02:53:40.449]  Yeah.
[02:53:41.207 --> 02:53:42.168]  Okay, well, thanks a lot.
[02:53:42.608 --> 02:53:43.709]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:43.749 --> 02:53:45.871]  I mean, really, folks, we do a lot of evil stuff.
[02:53:47.252 --> 02:53:49.313]  We're very decadent, very self-centered.
[02:53:50.294 --> 02:53:51.615]  I mean, look at this looting.
[02:53:51.655 --> 02:53:53.457]  You wouldn't have seen that back in the 20s.
[02:53:55.358 --> 02:53:55.658]  No.
[02:53:55.839 --> 02:53:57.460]  I mean, people just didn't behave like that.
[02:53:57.500 --> 02:53:58.080]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:58.701 --> 02:53:59.602]  Let's talk to James.
[02:53:59.682 --> 02:54:00.803]  James, where are you calling us from?
[02:54:00.823 --> 02:54:03.805]  Hey, I'm here in Virginia.
[02:54:04.611 --> 02:54:05.211]  Welcome, sir.
[02:54:05.271 --> 02:54:06.071]  What's on your mind?
[02:54:06.472 --> 02:54:08.652]  Well, I'm just very suspicious, too.
[02:54:08.712 --> 02:54:14.034]  You've been... I noticed you put a couple articles from my website, Total411.info, up on your site.
[02:54:14.494 --> 02:54:15.354]  Yeah, you got a good sign.
[02:54:15.514 --> 02:54:16.074]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:54:16.114 --> 02:54:16.594]  Thank you for that.
[02:54:16.694 --> 02:54:22.796]  And I just want to lay out the timeline and why I'm so suspicious about this, because... Well, first we know... You've got about a minute and a half.
[02:54:22.836 --> 02:54:23.016]  Tell us.
[02:54:23.036 --> 02:54:23.516]  Okay, great.
[02:54:23.856 --> 02:54:33.219]  Came off as a tropical storm out of Florida, and it went to Category 5 very quickly, and then headed for New Orleans, and by some miracle it got
[02:54:34.265 --> 02:54:36.027]  Diverted to the east slightly.
[02:54:36.047 --> 02:54:42.592]  And it was only Category 3 when it hit New Orleans, which is what the levees were designed for.
[02:54:43.093 --> 02:54:48.517]  But then at about 10.30 at night on Monday, apparently, these levees, this levee broke.
[02:54:49.197 --> 02:54:52.380]  That's what I think is suspicious, is how those levees broke.
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:55.202]  Yeah, you look at the pictures, it's a clean break.
[02:54:55.242 --> 02:55:01.968]  You had Begich on yesterday, and the Philadelphia News said some contractor
[02:55:02.492 --> 02:55:06.494]  I don't know who yet had just finished reinforcing that part of the levee.
[02:55:06.534 --> 02:55:09.736]  Just like the Pentagon's having repairs done on the plane that's there.
[02:55:09.936 --> 02:55:10.397]  Exactly.
[02:55:10.437 --> 02:55:12.718]  I'm trying to find out who this contractor was.
[02:55:13.198 --> 02:55:16.460]  I wonder if it'll be Marvin Bush like it was on 9-11.
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:17.100]  I don't know.
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:19.702]  The company that reinforced the Pentagon called Amec.
[02:55:20.302 --> 02:55:21.123]  It's a British firm.
[02:55:21.183 --> 02:55:25.385]  It's heavily into doing levees and hydraulics and stuff like that.
[02:55:25.465 --> 02:55:27.707]  But, yeah, I don't know if it was ever someone else.
[02:55:27.747 --> 02:55:28.627]  Well, I just can't believe that.
[02:55:28.687 --> 02:55:31.689]  And then they waited hours and hours to plug the levees.
[02:55:33.018 --> 02:55:34.179]  And the mayor is going crazy.
[02:55:34.239 --> 02:55:35.119]  Ask him what's going on.
[02:55:35.159 --> 02:55:36.040]  Where are the helicopters?
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.680]  They weren't there.
[02:55:39.401 --> 02:55:41.002]  No, I mean, I know, I remember.
[02:55:42.103 --> 02:55:46.225]  Well, I mean, regardless, Bush is going to grandstand and be our great leader.
[02:55:46.245 --> 02:55:47.446]  I mean, don't you want to worship him?
[02:55:47.806 --> 02:55:48.326]  No, I don't.
[02:55:48.366 --> 02:55:49.246]  I'm very upset.
[02:55:49.286 --> 02:55:51.488]  I'm from New Orleans and this is breaking my heart.
[02:55:51.588 --> 02:55:54.969]  Thank God my family's okay, but I don't know.
[02:55:55.029 --> 02:55:55.790]  I'm freaking out.
[02:55:55.810 --> 02:55:56.770]  Well, call us back tomorrow.
[02:55:56.810 --> 02:55:57.571]  Is your family, uh,
[02:55:59.271 --> 02:56:01.913]  They're in Baton Rouge in Tennessee and they're scattered out.
[02:56:02.233 --> 02:56:03.214]  They're out of hand.
[02:56:04.095 --> 02:56:04.935]  Well, that's good news.
[02:56:04.975 --> 02:56:05.736]  Thanks for the call.
