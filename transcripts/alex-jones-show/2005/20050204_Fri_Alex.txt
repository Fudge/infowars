[00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.170]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:07.911]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:09.732]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:11.193]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:12.854]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:17.176]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:20.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:21.825]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:22.105]  Whoa!
[00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:25.466]  This week has just blasted past us.
[00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.707]  It is Friday, the fourth day
[00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:52.107]  Of February 2005, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:57.091]  We'll be live for the next three hours, wide open phones, a ton of vital news and information.
[00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:14.165]  Steve Quayle, syndicated radio broadcaster, author, researcher, preparedness expert, really intelligent individual, will be joining us to talk about a whole plethora of issues in the second hour and to take your calls.
[00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.864]  So you do not want to miss Steve Coyle in the next hour.
[00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:21.066]  Senate OKs Gonzalez as Attorney General.
[00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:25.470]  Democrats register significant protest with 35 no votes.
[00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:35.757]  And some Republicans voted no as well because, well, this guy says the government's above the law and that torture is a good thing.
[00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:42.723]  Interesting article out of a mainstream newspaper in Canada where they have foreign police
[00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:51.026]  As part of international treaties arresting their citizens and violating Canada's laws.
[00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:54.687]  And the foreign police are American.
[00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:57.567]  All part of the New World Order.
[00:01:57.607 --> 00:01:58.808]  Another article here.
[00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:04.168]  Metric system set to rule US under EU rules.
[00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.929]  Starting next month you're gonna have to use the metric system.
[00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.630]  Shows
[00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:15.105]  How much control we're going under.
[00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.406]  We're already in the global union.
[00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:21.647]  The average person has no idea even what the global union is.
[00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:26.149]  And Condoleezza Rice was quoted making fun of the American people.
[00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.030]  The sound of Reuters.
[00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:42.275]  Rice thinks it's real funny that the average American cannot find Iraq on a map or that the average high school senior cannot find Canada on a map.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.363]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we've gone from the most educated, the most informed, to gibbering idiots.
[00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:53.224]  Mindless fools.
[00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:55.625]  And it's very funny.
[00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.486]  Condoleezza Rice.
[00:02:58.447 --> 00:02:59.707]  It's a big joke.
[00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:02.869]  Basically, we're blind and they can see.
[00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.650]  They gouged our eyes out as a society.
[00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.291]  They barged our eardrums.
[00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:10.272]  They seared
[00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.211]  Our fingertips so we lose our touch.
[00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:15.453]  They've destroyed our senses.
[00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:24.140]  A bunch of deaf, dumb, and blind, I mean societally, sociologically, historically, people.
[00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:26.883]  It's unbelievable.
[00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:30.345]  No so blind as those that have eyes but still cannot see.
[00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:37.411]  And so we will go over this travesty as they crow and laugh at us.
[00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:41.833]  Very, very funny how stupid we are.
[00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:43.174]  Thanks a lot.
[00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.816]  You've done a really good job.
[00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:49.919]  And you think we're all your slaves and you think you've got us.
[00:03:49.959 --> 00:04:00.426]  It's like a slave master, you know, out in the slave barn laughing at the slaves because the slaves are so uneducated they don't even know they're being made fun of.
[00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:11.654]  But we're even more uneducated than slaves in a barn 170 years ago because they knew they were slaves.
[00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:13.055]  We don't even know we're slaves.
[00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:14.757]  It's sick.
[00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:19.500]  And they laugh at us and they make fun of us and I get very angry about it.
[00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:27.807]  My goal is to get you to realize what they're doing to you and to stop going along with their very sophisticated propaganda.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.520]  All right, we're going to break and we'll come back.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.721]  And there's just so much news internationally, nationally.
[00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.042]  The fight against the New World Order shall continue on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:40.922]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:41.923]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:45.683]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.622]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.885]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:09.908]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:14.211]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:18.334]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:20.256]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:23.739]  Riot police attack people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:28.523]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:31.725]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.768]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.248 --> 00:05:41.373]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:45.697]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:03.033]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:06.137]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:10.563]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:11.825]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:16.691]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:19.312]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:34.499]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:02.225]  Are you paying too much for term life insurance?
[00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:07.228]  There is a tremendous price for among the major term life companies and you may be paying too much.
[00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:08.808]  Consider these possible rates.
[00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:14.031]  A man, age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1,000,000 of coverage is only $75 per month.
[00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:17.252]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:45.960]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We're here 24 hours a day.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.241]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748
[00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:06.318]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:08.039]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:09.860]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.320]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.601]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:17.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.843 --> 00:08:21.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:37.568]  Very quietly, America is going into the night.
[00:08:38.629 --> 00:09:02.038]  I remember last year I got a local newscast from News 8, and it was a little piece about, oh, dozens of Austin police officers are being sworn in as federal deputies so they can be part of an international treaty and go arrest people into foreign countries as far away as Russia and Japan.
[00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:12.767]  And they mentioned also, it's an exchange program, foreign officers are going to be coming here and arresting American citizens.
[00:09:14.548 --> 00:09:20.752]  And under these treaties, we've seen people like, oh I guess about four years ago, a white supremacist.
[00:09:21.732 --> 00:09:23.893]  And that's his business, you know, he's allowed to do that.
[00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:27.055]  I don't agree with it, but that's his First Amendment.
[00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:28.416]  This is America.
[00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:30.497]  He'd written a book about
[00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:33.325]  How the Holocaust didn't happen.
[00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:37.187]  And that's his right to do that as well.
[00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:42.050]  And, well, he lived in Nebraska.
[00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:47.253]  And under German law, some of his books had been sold in Germany, and that's illegal.
[00:09:47.594 --> 00:09:48.834]  There's no free speech there.
[00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:54.538]  And so, the FBI came and arrested him because they convicted him in absentia.
[00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:58.968]  That is, without him even knowing, there was a trial in Germany.
[00:09:58.988 --> 00:09:59.948]  It was in their newspapers.
[00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:10.072]  And our government came and arrested him and shipped him to Germany to spend a 10-year prison term because he wrote a book in America saying that less than 6 million Jews died.
[00:10:12.453 --> 00:10:18.136]  Now, again, whether you think 600 trillion Jews died or a million Jews died,
[00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:22.896]  A lot of Jews did die, and a lot of Jewish groups admit it.
[00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.037]  It's under 6 million.
[00:10:24.077 --> 00:10:26.859]  At first they said 6 million died at Auschwitz alone.
[00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:30.542]  Well, 6 million people didn't go through Auschwitz, and now the plaque at Auschwitz says 400,000.
[00:10:30.582 --> 00:10:36.386]  Hey folks, 400,000, 6 million, you know, one camp, 400,000, whatever.
[00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:37.507]  The Nazis were bad.
[00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:38.547]  They killed a lot of people.
[00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:40.709]  The point is, that's not part of the debate.
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.030]  Okay?
[00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.412]  And the guy on top of it, you know, was an admitted white supremacist.
[00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:46.213]  That's his business.
[00:10:47.202 --> 00:10:54.044]  You know, you can be a black supremacist, you can be a Mexican supremacist, you can be a Mexican supremacist and be Attorney General in America.
[00:10:54.164 --> 00:11:00.967]  I have a problem with that, I have a problem with this white supremacist being an Attorney General, but you know, he's not Alberto Gonzales, so he's in prison.
[00:11:02.367 --> 00:11:04.968]  So they came and arrested him.
[00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:15.272]  And then we have Mr. Zundel, who I would not call a white supremacist, who is really a historian and has written books about
[00:11:16.116 --> 00:11:33.731]  uh... the uh... holocaust the numbers being inflated and arts is on gold is on a canadian president allowed to see visitors is allowed to get his mail and uh... they're about to extradite him to germany he's a canadian citizen and uh... had moved the u.s.
[00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:43.640]  married american woman there many years with the tennessee and they uh... what came and grabbed him and have been holding him for several years in solitary confinement are getting ready to ship him to germany
[00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:46.567]  So, this is globalism.
[00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:53.834]  But you're thinking, well, you know, extradite that white supremacist, or extradite that, you know, they won't extradite me.
[00:11:53.854 --> 00:11:54.895]  Oh, really?
[00:11:56.456 --> 00:12:08.827]  Well, under other free speech laws, people in England that have criticized the EU have been arrested, or have lost their jobs, or have been extradited across the channel to be tried by the EU.
[00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:20.726]  So, see, they always started on somebody like the white supremacist or the child molesters or some group that's, you know, out of favor and obviously we know why.
[00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:24.288]  But then, see, it's for everybody else.
[00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:28.090]  The left loved it back during the 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s.
[00:12:30.293 --> 00:12:49.079]  Right up until 2000, abortion protesters getting their arms broken, and patriots being tortured, and losing their rights, and it was all fun and a neat thing, and now it's happening to the left, as well as conservatives, it's happening to everybody now at a greater rate every week, and so they're squealing bloody murder.
[00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.200]  And rightfully so.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.822]  The Tony Blakeleys of the world, the Washington Times are calling for killing people that, you know, criticize the government or do news reports, and
[00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:02.726]  The Republicans are calling for it.
[00:13:03.687 --> 00:13:05.127]  The Michael Wieners are calling for it.
[00:13:05.147 --> 00:13:06.428]  We talked about this yesterday.
[00:13:07.408 --> 00:13:09.669]  The Malkins are calling for it.
[00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.650]  Individuals like that, the Coulters are calling for it.
[00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.952]  But there I am watching local news.
[00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:20.093]  Actually, a listener sent me the tape.
[00:13:21.617 --> 00:13:30.984]  And, uh, locally, you know, just, oh, our police are going to be international, your police are going to be international, we're going to have foreign police here arresting us, and we're going to be under their laws!
[00:13:33.386 --> 00:13:35.407]  That's what globalism means!
[00:13:36.688 --> 00:13:40.071]  That's what's in the executive orders and in Homeland Security and in the Patriot Act.
[00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:49.177]  Extraditing Americans for mere suspicion of any crime to, quote, third-party countries where torture is legal and where CIA officers oversee the torture.
[00:13:49.197 --> 00:13:50.278]  You know, that's the Washington Post.
[00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:51.917]  Telling us how great it is.
[00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:55.319]  And then I see two articles like this today.
[00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.900]  And I see these articles every day.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.963]  And most of the time I don't cover them because I've been conditioned, you know, like we all have.
[00:14:01.483 --> 00:14:03.024]  But I wanted to cover these two articles.
[00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:04.625]  Number one, something real simple.
[00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:06.966]  It sounds innocuous, but it's a big deal.
[00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.809]  Metric system set to rule U.S.
[00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.210]  This is out of the news and star.
[00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.232]  If you like your beer in a pint glass,
[00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:22.080]  Estimate your car's performance in miles per gallon, or reckon your baby's weight in pounds and ounces.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.540]  Look out!
[00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:30.627]  Before 2005 is over, we are expected to conform to Big Brother's European Union metric system.
[00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:34.670]  By the way, type in British man arrested for using pounds.
[00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:37.172]  They've arrested hundreds of people in England.
[00:14:38.033 --> 00:14:44.098]  They literally have police that go into the little farmers markets, and if they catch them with their old scales, they arrest them on the spot.
[00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:47.716]  Just type it in, you'll get BBC, but continuing.
[00:14:48.796 --> 00:15:02.839]  Whether road signing will be altered to show kilometers is conjectural, since very few would trust Tony Mafouse's not-to-do-anything Brussels bids, but must expect the worst.
[00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:05.460]  Don't give them the chance to get away with it.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.500]  They are spoiling our lovely country.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.901]  Vote for anyone, and it goes on into this.
[00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:18.035]  So, all over the world, from England to the U.S., they're trying to shift over to this.
[00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.918]  Now, here's one concerning the United States and Canada.
[00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:24.560]  Okay?
[00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:34.066]  Cop wins RCMP settlement after search by U.S.
[00:15:34.106 --> 00:15:34.587]  troopers.
[00:15:35.548 --> 00:15:36.568]  This guy was a cop!
[00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:41.732]  This is from CBC News, the Canadian broadcasting company.
[00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:50.669]  A Vancouver man has won an out-of-court settlement from the RCMP after an incident in which he says he was illegally searched.
[00:15:52.090 --> 00:16:04.675]  David Lang says police overstepped the law when they stopped his car, decided he was driving under the influence of marijuana, and searched his vehicle and his two-year-old son.
[00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:06.796]  Now, he's a cop, so he knew his rights.
[00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:10.420]  Under Canadian law, the kind of search is illegal.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.902]  It's illegal under the Fourth Amendment, too, here, but they still do it.
[00:16:14.383 --> 00:16:22.968]  What upset Lange even more is that some of the officers he tangled with were actually American police officers.
[00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:27.591]  Last spring, Lange was driving on a highway near Hope in Canada.
[00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:32.755]  He turned a corner and a man in an orange traffic vest in the middle of the road motioned him to pull over.
[00:16:33.436 --> 00:16:37.037]  In a heavy Texas accent, the man asked Ling's identification.
[00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:38.877]  Ling asked if the man was an American.
[00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:42.878]  The man answered that he was, and that he was performing a BC road check.
[00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:44.378]  British Columbia road check.
[00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:47.459]  I said, Are you a police officer?
[00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:50.620]  Who are you to be detaining me?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.160]  SNP.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:02.302]  SNP, RCMP spokesman Cox John Ward, possible John Ward, says the Texas Troopers profiling program provides great help to the Mounties.
[00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.976]  The Americans do a lot of this and have been doing it for quite some time.
[00:17:07.016 --> 00:17:09.840]  Yes, they've been violating all our freedoms for a long time.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.986]  So there's a lot of opportunity on both sides of the border to become closer.
[00:17:14.838 --> 00:17:16.319]  Lange and his lawyers disagree.
[00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:24.842]  They say that when it comes to narcotics, America's attitudes and Canadian laws are quite different, but have different freedoms than they have.
[00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:26.382]  Well, we have different freedoms than they have.
[00:17:26.622 --> 00:17:27.803]  No, you have the same freedoms.
[00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:29.583]  In fact, less, but they just violate ours.
[00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.704]  Lange said, you don't want to mesh too much.
[00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:39.947]  You don't want your police meshing to the point where we start taking on police jurisdiction policies.
[00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:46.282]  And then it gets into how he won a large settlement because of this.
[00:17:47.723 --> 00:17:50.024]  And he's a police officer again himself.
[00:17:51.164 --> 00:17:54.365]  And it gets into what happened.
[00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:58.506]  Then I've got other articles here.
[00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:03.628]  RCMP pulls over Texas Motorists near Crawford, Brooks.
[00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:06.956]  Give the young child, her young child.
[00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:14.260]  Postcards of the bulletin, bullet-ridden carcass dangling from the local tree are available in the lobby.
[00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:20.704]  And it goes into just a bunch of different bizarre things the police said to him.
[00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:30.309]  You can read this Canadian broadcasting story at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:18:32.318 --> 00:18:34.619]  Folks, the point is, this is globalism.
[00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.480]  And I see these articles every single day.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.241]  We're in America, in England, and all over the western world.
[00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:45.682]  We're all going under international law.
[00:18:45.742 --> 00:18:46.722]  Same thing in Canada.
[00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:53.064]  And they have foreign police here in almost every major jurisdiction on these exchange programs.
[00:18:53.584 --> 00:18:57.445]  And now they're signing all these treaties, merging the two systems.
[00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.286]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:04.489]  When we get back, I want to go into Condoleezza Rice.
[00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:06.330]  Don't get lost!
[00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.671]  Globetrotter Rice tells U.S.
[00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:09.131]  Press.
[00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:16.135]  And she laughs about how Americans don't know much about the outside world.
[00:19:16.195 --> 00:19:27.442]  So, on a flight, on a diplomatic mission, she handed out a bunch of copies, 18 copies, of world almanacs to them.
[00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:29.265]  Pocket atlases.
[00:19:29.285 --> 00:19:32.167]  Of course, I would tell Rice that's a terrorist document.
[00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:40.131]  Last year, the government said that if you have these in your car, that's a good reason to question you or even arrest you, because you may be a terrorist.
[00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:47.714]  So, I guess we better arrest Rice, because... See, this all sounds completely insane, but it's really going on.
[00:19:48.695 --> 00:19:51.236]  We'll come back and cover that and much, much more

[00:22:00.842 --> 00:22:02.423]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.803 --> 00:22:08.545]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:08.806 --> 00:22:13.928]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:23.552]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:23.912 --> 00:22:28.855]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:33.218]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:33.398 --> 00:22:38.121]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:44.445]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:46.226]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:46.246 --> 00:22:53.069]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:23:14.466 --> 00:23:21.271]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:23.613]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:23:23.853 --> 00:23:26.896]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[00:23:27.862 --> 00:23:36.387]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:39.148]  That's 1-800...
[00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:51.897]  5168736.
[00:23:51.277 --> 00:23:51.897]  Call now.
[00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:58.679]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:09.742]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.362 --> 00:24:13.303]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.473 --> 00:24:23.113]  You know, I was talking a little fast trying to cover news in the last segment.
[00:24:23.153 --> 00:24:24.314]  Might have confused people.
[00:24:25.534 --> 00:24:39.817]  The first article was concerning England forcing them to go into the metric system and they've already been arresting people for years who have been attempting to still use it for produce sales and in other forms of commerce.
[00:24:40.557 --> 00:24:43.358]  And they've signed international treaties the US government has
[00:24:44.133 --> 00:24:50.979]  to start merging its international weights and measures and the measures they use for trade on the metric system.
[00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:55.604]  You've probably noticed your car, a lot of the readouts in your car also now have the metric system.
[00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.967]  They're shifting over to that here as well, just a little bit slower.
[00:24:59.527 --> 00:25:06.534]  The second article was out of Canada concerning Americans, troops,
[00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:26.530]  And I say troops because our police have become militarized, that is state troopers from Texas up there with their federal troopers or royal mounted police or Mounties running checkpoints when Canadian law says you can't randomly stop people in search of them.
[00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:33.394]  So if that got confusing, then I was reading the CBC News reports, reading into the
[00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:38.377]  Some of the posted emails and comments on the news website.
[00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:53.812]  They were talking about other cases of the police at these checkpoints doing just all sorts of horrible things to people, much like the airports, that if somebody runs or doesn't submit, well, they just get blown away or tasered.
[00:25:54.372 --> 00:25:55.994]  Look, it's really simple.
[00:25:56.494 --> 00:25:59.956]  In a free society, you don't get stopped at checkpoints.
[00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:07.120]  And they tell you, oh it's to stop terrorists, oh it's to... Folks, the border has less border patrol than it had before 9-11.
[00:26:08.081 --> 00:26:21.088]  And then when they passed that 9-11 bill in December, they put some money in there to hire 2,000 more border patrol that would just replace those that quit and left to become air marshals, where they start with an increase in salary of $24,000.
[00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:28.573]  Well, then Ridge came out and said, yeah, we did pass the money for that, but we're going to spend it on something else.
[00:26:30.374 --> 00:26:34.075]  So it's quite a minefield of propaganda to navigate.
[00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:35.396]  And look, it's simple.
[00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:39.497]  Take the Iraq elections, then we're going to go to break and come back and take your calls.
[00:26:40.117 --> 00:26:41.078]  Take the Iraq elections.
[00:26:41.098 --> 00:26:42.518]  You know, they go, oh, it's freedom.
[00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:45.759]  And oh, this proves that we should have gone to Iraq.
[00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:47.580]  And boy, everybody's got egg on their face.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.921]  It was against the war.
[00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:52.462]  What the media and the government's done is frame the debate.
[00:26:53.525 --> 00:26:57.087]  Oh, well, if this election goes well, this proves the war was good.
[00:26:57.608 --> 00:26:59.649]  We've put democracy in Iraq.
[00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:01.890]  Well, again, they framed the debate.
[00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:06.113]  Number one, they went into Iraq supposedly for weapons of mass destruction.
[00:27:06.813 --> 00:27:08.814]  Number two, our government put Saddam in.
[00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:20.341]  And now, you look at this election, it was installed candidates, candidates who were already appointed to leadership positions a year and a half ago when they consolidated power after the takeover.
[00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:22.863]  When the coalition forces went in.
[00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:31.755]  And then we go through the whole litany of how the polling places were secret, you couldn't know who the opposition candidates were until the day of the election.
[00:27:32.556 --> 00:27:33.517]  Just all of this.
[00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:35.698]  It's a staged election.
[00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:40.762]  But even if you believe it was a real election, I mean, take America, for instance.
[00:27:41.242 --> 00:27:48.287]  If we don't have property rights, if we don't own our land, try not paying your property tax for a year and see what happens.
[00:27:49.031 --> 00:27:49.952]  See, you don't really own it.
[00:27:49.992 --> 00:27:51.093]  You pay a rent on it.
[00:27:51.413 --> 00:27:53.234]  Property tax is totally unconstitutional.
[00:27:53.555 --> 00:27:54.535]  It is feudalism.
[00:27:55.416 --> 00:28:00.980]  It is what they had, you know, in France 300 years ago, in England 300 years ago, and they still have it today, and now we have it.
[00:28:02.542 --> 00:28:10.328]  So if you don't own your property, that, number one, is the hallmark of freedom, and if your politicians
[00:28:11.598 --> 00:28:36.777]  can tax you out of existence you don't have freedom and if your juries have been turned into rubber stamps and your grand juries have been turned into rubber stamps those are other big forms of freedom and voting then does it matter if you can vote for what figurehead is going to be over your government but then it doesn't matter what the people's will or what the constitution says I mean look they admit
[00:28:38.402 --> 00:28:43.785]  That here in Austin, Texas, no one, I mean, 90 plus percent of people are against the toll roads.
[00:28:44.446 --> 00:28:45.486]  It's a big scam.
[00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:52.731]  No one's for it, but an unelected board put in by the federal government and the state government just says we're going to have it.
[00:28:53.451 --> 00:28:54.392]  I mean, is that freedom?
[00:28:56.673 --> 00:28:57.614]  You see, that's what they're doing.
[00:28:57.634 --> 00:29:07.060]  They're also creating all these unelected regional governments that are above even our elected governments that have all the authority, and then we can elect people who basically decide
[00:29:08.004 --> 00:29:10.325]  You know, I guess, what color to paint City Hall?
[00:29:11.626 --> 00:29:17.868]  So, all of our real freedoms are being decimated, or being terminated, or being annihilated.
[00:29:19.409 --> 00:29:24.051]  Meanwhile, the general public doesn't even know the basis of what America is founded on.
[00:29:25.011 --> 00:29:27.672]  And so, it's hard to even communicate with them.
[00:29:27.692 --> 00:29:29.533]  I don't know, it makes my head spin sometimes.
[00:29:29.773 --> 00:29:32.294]  We'll come back to what Condoleezza Rice said about how dumb we are.
[00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:36.296]  And we'll get to your calls.
[00:29:38.448 --> 00:29:40.229]  And just a bunch of other key information.
[00:29:40.309 --> 00:29:42.451]  And Steve Quayle's going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.691]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:43.711 --> 00:29:45.453]  The website's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:45.973 --> 00:29:46.954]  Please, stay with us.
[00:29:51.617 --> 00:29:52.497]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.997 --> 00:29:54.578]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:58.201]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:05.272]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:30:05.453 --> 00:30:08.174]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:30:08.354 --> 00:30:09.735]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:19.839]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:21.800]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.924]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:30:26.185 --> 00:30:30.590]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.634]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:30:34.894 --> 00:30:41.001]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:44.062]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:30:44.222 --> 00:30:47.563]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[00:30:47.663 --> 00:30:51.524]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on a compost twin.
[00:30:51.644 --> 00:30:52.845]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:30:52.865 --> 00:30:53.425]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:31:01.483 --> 00:31:05.045]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.085 --> 00:31:05.606]  are located?
[00:31:05.806 --> 00:31:09.188]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:14.131]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.391 --> 00:31:19.394]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:19.654 --> 00:31:25.698]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:31:25.958 --> 00:31:40.386]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[00:31:40.486 --> 00:31:43.527]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[00:31:43.627 --> 00:31:44.767]  In business and socially,
[00:32:07.532 --> 00:32:13.935]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:16.256]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:17.597]  Why you listen.
[00:32:18.217 --> 00:32:22.939]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:25.140]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.821]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:30.442]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:32:31.003 --> 00:32:32.723]  And it's so easy.
[00:32:32.823 --> 00:32:34.804]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:32:35.665 --> 00:32:36.225]  When you want.
[00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.650]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:38.811]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:39.111]  That's 419-WORD.
[00:32:39.131 --> 00:32:39.291]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:25.151]  I've got a bunch of articles here about the new robotic forces that are going to be replacing our troops in Iraq and replacing much of the Air Force by 2010.
[00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:27.632]  I've got reports about U.S.
[00:33:27.692 --> 00:33:30.693]  invoked secret privileges in torture lawsuit.
[00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:36.273]  And the media admits in almost every other case now of government corruption.
[00:33:36.373 --> 00:33:39.013]  Oh, you want to investigate trillions of missing dollars?
[00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:40.754]  Sorry, national security.
[00:33:41.314 --> 00:33:43.014]  We're allowed to steal everything blind.
[00:33:43.314 --> 00:33:45.835]  We're about to go to John and Jeffrey and Tim and Linda and Ken and others.
[00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:49.155]  Before I do that, don't get lost.
[00:33:49.315 --> 00:33:50.976]  Globetrotter Rice tells U.S.
[00:33:51.076 --> 00:33:57.337]  Press, this out of Reuters, with Americans suffering a reputation as geographically challenged,
[00:33:58.914 --> 00:34:02.359]  Donna Lisa Rice handed out pocket atlases to U.S.
[00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:05.943]  Press Corps on her first trip abroad as Secretary of State.
[00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.166]  I would not want anybody to feel lost.
[00:34:08.186 --> 00:34:09.268]  She making fun of them.
[00:34:09.668 --> 00:34:16.097]  The former university pro host quipped as she handed out 18 copies of the books on the plane.
[00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:22.934]  Americans are often mocked abroad for their perceived lack of knowledge of the outside world.
[00:34:23.475 --> 00:34:24.956]  Surveys sometimes show U.S.
[00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:29.038]  kids cannot even locate neighbors like Canada and Mexico.
[00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:30.339]  Try high school seniors.
[00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:43.167]  The souvenir for journalists on her inaugural 8-day, 10-stop trip to Europe and the Middle East was also Rice's way to show she will travel widely to fulfill her pledge at the time her diplomacy is now.
[00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:52.813]  Our predecessor, Colin Powell, was criticized for traveling too little when some more face-to-face diplomacy might have helped win over allies to radical U.S.
[00:34:52.853 --> 00:34:53.434]  policies.
[00:34:54.234 --> 00:35:02.136]  Asked by reporters whether the presence were a portent of heavy travel schedules for the new top U.S.
[00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:05.877]  diplomat, Rice smiled and replied, You will see!
[00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:09.318]  So ha ha ha!
[00:35:10.538 --> 00:35:13.199]  I wouldn't want anybody to feel lost.
[00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:18.096]  You know, they act like knowing about the world is boring.
[00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.758]  It's taught in such a dry fashion.
[00:35:21.779 --> 00:35:25.921]  But you look at how, say, a hundred years ago, history and geography was taught in schools.
[00:35:25.961 --> 00:35:26.701]  I've read the curriculum.
[00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:27.782]  It was exciting.
[00:35:27.822 --> 00:35:28.482]  It was fun.
[00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:30.303]  There were contests.
[00:35:33.405 --> 00:35:34.766]  I talked to my grandparents.
[00:35:36.162 --> 00:35:37.163]  I talked to my dad.
[00:35:37.203 --> 00:35:39.484]  I mean, I talked to so many people from older generations.
[00:35:39.844 --> 00:35:44.447]  They would read the encyclopedia, those world books, for fun!
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.581]  My dad encouraged me to growing up, and I did to a certain extent.
[00:35:48.601 --> 00:36:00.187]  I mean, it's fun to, on a Saturday morning, sit in at the kitchen table with the sun shining through the window, drink a big glass of lemonade for an hour or two, flipping around, reading about history.
[00:36:00.407 --> 00:36:07.691]  Maybe I'm weird, but imaging all these interesting places and famous things that have happened and all the amazing things that have gone on.
[00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:10.172]  But no, the children just go watch some
[00:36:10.914 --> 00:36:38.811]  TV show where, you know, the UN is saving us from most of the children's cartoons, or they're giving blood to buy and sell, that's on a lot of the cartoons, you're being retina scanned, you know, turning in your parents is good, or going and playing violent video games where you rip people's intestines out and you're a demon who kidnaps children and kills them, or, you know, this is what most of the games are like now, where you rape and kill a woman and get bonus points, or run over old ladies with your car, these are all the most popular, you know, that's what the kids are doing today.
[00:36:40.436 --> 00:36:52.663]  And so they can tell you all about how to be cool, or about some punk band, or about some country band, or, you know, or whatever, or how people should be arrested for criticizing the government, or how there shouldn't be any free speech.
[00:36:53.224 --> 00:37:04.331]  Over half the high school students questioned that that was, on Monday, that big survey of 118,000 students and 7,000-something teachers and 600-something principals.
[00:37:06.652 --> 00:37:09.874]  But, so, it's just amazing!
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.643]  And you try to talk to people, but the really sad thing is they'll argue with you.
[00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:19.004]  And then if you say, OK, where is Syria?
[00:37:20.565 --> 00:37:21.926]  Who was the last leader of Syria?
[00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:23.307]  They'll never get that.
[00:37:23.627 --> 00:37:27.069]  OK, who's the current leader of Syria?
[00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:35.513]  Give me, in a 60-second summation, the last six governments since 1900 that were in Iraq.
[00:37:39.645 --> 00:37:41.747]  I mean, you know, that's somewhat complex stuff.
[00:37:42.748 --> 00:37:43.108]  Okay?
[00:37:43.768 --> 00:37:49.793]  But, I mean, the point is, is that adults, they cannot find Iraq on a map, folks.
[00:37:50.193 --> 00:37:50.514]  Literally.
[00:37:52.055 --> 00:37:53.776]  They have no idea.
[00:37:55.998 --> 00:37:58.780]  I mean, I remember talking to Democrats during the election.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.905]  They didn't even know who John Kerry's running mate was.
[00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:25.131]  Republicans see themselves a little bit smarter, but it's, again, they created the phony Republican revolution, the neocon Fox News revolution, because they knew that a lot of people were a little more informed, and read a little bit more, and so they knew there was some type of bias, and they go, yes, you've caught us.
[00:38:25.412 --> 00:38:29.534]  There's a liberal bias, and we'll create a counter-revolution to counter the liberals.
[00:38:29.955 --> 00:38:31.896]  And then that's just another level of propaganda.
[00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:37.380]  You read the Wall Street Journal, that's a little bit higher level of propaganda for those that are a little bit more informed.
[00:38:39.326 --> 00:38:47.548]  And then you've got the real journals for the elite that are printed by the thousands every month that globalists only read.
[00:38:48.008 --> 00:38:50.549]  And I guess a few professors, and I go and I read those.
[00:38:51.029 --> 00:38:58.591]  Or it's just openly, we're going to take all your rights, we're going to take everything you got, we're going to enslave you, you're going to be satellite tracked and taxed everywhere you go.
[00:38:58.611 --> 00:39:01.452]  I mean, this is what they say they're going to do.
[00:39:02.378 --> 00:39:03.359]  But I'll sit there.
[00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:06.401]  I'm not being sardonic either, like, ooh, I'm smart and you're dumb.
[00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:10.203]  I wouldn't begin to try to tell you who won the World Series in 1975.
[00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:15.306]  I wouldn't begin to tell you, you know, if it was the American League or the whatever.
[00:39:15.866 --> 00:39:18.628]  I wouldn't begin to try to tell you how to dress cool.
[00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:22.250]  And how to act cool when I walk in the shopping mall.
[00:39:22.911 --> 00:39:24.532]  Or what purse is the coolest.
[00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:28.654]  Or, you know, what soft drink is the coolest.
[00:39:28.774 --> 00:39:31.456]  I know you're... It's not that you're even stupid.
[00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:36.112]  You're just totally focused on things that don't amount to a hell of beans.
[00:39:37.193 --> 00:39:38.614]  And let me tell you something about Americans.
[00:39:38.654 --> 00:39:48.304]  The reason we had all the inventions, the reason 4% of the population had half the wealth, and most of that was in the middle class's hands, that's all being taken right now, it was because
[00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.350]  Everything was science.
[00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:51.571]  Everything was mathematics.
[00:39:51.711 --> 00:39:52.631]  Everything was history.
[00:39:52.771 --> 00:39:53.932]  Everything was being informed.
[00:39:54.152 --> 00:40:13.219]  The rock stars of a hundred years ago, even seventy, even sixty, fifty years ago, were people who could fly around the world in a balloon, or in an airplane, or who could scale the Matterhorn the fastest, or who
[00:40:16.545 --> 00:40:18.466]  In the Spelling Bee, you know, the biggest word.
[00:40:18.486 --> 00:40:20.706]  I mean, these were like rock concerts.
[00:40:21.447 --> 00:40:24.487]  Now, it's almost unknown.
[00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:28.529]  You know, a few thousand people maybe show up at the big international Spelling Bee.
[00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:33.350]  I mean, it was people greedily, hungrily gobbled up information.
[00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.411]  I am an idiot compared to people a hundred years ago.
[00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:41.972]  Folks, go to the library, read a hundred and fifty year old newspaper.
[00:40:42.593 --> 00:40:43.793]  The words are so huge.
[00:40:44.782 --> 00:40:45.904]  So complex.
[00:40:46.164 --> 00:40:47.747]  And this is just what the general public was reading.
[00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:49.530]  Read a newspaper 225 years old.
[00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.990]  Even more complex.
[00:40:50.211 --> 00:40:50.511]  But again,
[00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:11.005]  I'll sit there on the exercise bike at the gym and somebody, you know, happens about once a month, used to happen all the time, will swagger over and go, how are the black helicopters doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:41:11.606 --> 00:41:15.527]  And I go, does laughing at me make you feel good?
[00:41:16.427 --> 00:41:21.029]  I mean, does it make you feel like everything's okay and that what I'm saying isn't true because you can laugh at me?
[00:41:21.269 --> 00:41:23.450]  I go, because laughing at me means absolutely nothing.
[00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:26.231]  I mean, it doesn't affect me.
[00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:28.512]  My ego isn't tied to what you think about me.
[00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:30.465]  My ego is actually quite small.
[00:41:32.086 --> 00:41:34.147]  And I know your life is run by your ego.
[00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:35.907]  And they'll go, hey, I'm just joking.
[00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:37.508]  Don't get... No, no, no, this is serious.
[00:41:37.868 --> 00:41:41.429]  You're making jokes about things, and you need to back up what you're saying.
[00:41:43.249 --> 00:41:47.311]  Do you know what two countries on the east and west border Iraq?
[00:41:50.272 --> 00:41:51.252]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:41:52.212 --> 00:41:53.553]  Well, you know more than most people.
[00:41:53.593 --> 00:41:54.813]  No, that's south of Iraq.
[00:41:55.793 --> 00:41:57.914]  And look, sir, you should know this, okay?
[00:41:59.223 --> 00:42:01.484]  A seven-year-old, a hundred years ago, would know this.
[00:42:01.824 --> 00:42:02.985]  But you don't know this!
[00:42:03.225 --> 00:42:08.287]  But you're going to sit here and you're going to tell me how the world works when you don't know anything!
[00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:11.228]  You're not qualified to be a toilet attendant!
[00:42:11.388 --> 00:42:12.248]  You're an idiot!
[00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:19.671]  Don't play at geopolitical systems if you have no idea about anything!
[00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:28.555]  Stop playing like you're some type of grand poobah when all you do is watch Fox News for 30 minutes at night, which is a bunch of
[00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:36.486]  Glad-handing, sophomoric, junior high, pecking order, uh, mindlessness.
[00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:42.110]  And the same thing goes for these supposed leftists out there that watch, you know, CNN and all this.
[00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.911]  I mean, you guys are really in trouble.
[00:42:47.314 --> 00:42:48.715]  I mean, I don't understand this.
[00:42:48.835 --> 00:42:50.436]  I just, I just don't understand it.
[00:42:52.658 --> 00:42:52.778]  Ugh.
[00:42:55.179 --> 00:42:58.722]  Alright, I said I'd go to calls and I'm ranting, I'm preaching, I'm
[00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:01.417]  And again, I'm not perfect, folks.
[00:43:01.498 --> 00:43:02.158]  I make mistakes.
[00:43:02.238 --> 00:43:03.358]  I'm not right about everything.
[00:43:03.718 --> 00:43:05.259]  You know, I'm learning more all the time.
[00:43:05.319 --> 00:43:11.921]  I learn more in a month now, geometrically, exponentially, than what I learned in all the years before that.
[00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:14.662]  I mean, I'm just learning more and more.
[00:43:14.742 --> 00:43:16.503]  And the more I learn, the more I know I don't know.
[00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:26.766]  But what I do know is, you guys, some of you out there, all you know is those people are brown over there, and they're foreigners, and let's kill them.
[00:43:27.879 --> 00:43:30.460]  And, folks, it's a fraud.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:44.926]  I mean, do you know that our government puts the criminal regimes in, and when good, pro-free market people get in that want freedom for their people and want to industrialize their nations, the globalists go in there and have coup d'etats and put radical Muslims in?
[00:43:45.106 --> 00:43:46.326]  See, you didn't know that, did you?
[00:43:46.466 --> 00:43:47.547]  And you don't want to know that.
[00:43:47.847 --> 00:43:51.488]  You don't want to know Donald Rumsfeld gave the nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:43:51.828 --> 00:43:53.029]  You go, but that was Bill Clinton!
[00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.569]  Exactly!
[00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:54.229]  They're all together.
[00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:56.270]  Bill Clinton opens the door for his bosses.
[00:43:57.086 --> 00:43:58.487]  There's no party difference.
[00:43:59.127 --> 00:44:00.047]  You don't want to know that.
[00:44:00.247 --> 00:44:03.588]  You don't want to know that Pakistan, our little buddy, is handing out nukes.
[00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:08.470]  That Ukraine is proliferating them.
[00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.150]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:12.751]  You want security, folks.
[00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:14.712]  You're not going to get security with a new world order.
[00:44:14.872 --> 00:44:18.733]  You understand your security ends when their tyranny begins.
[00:44:19.955 --> 00:44:27.457]  You have been sold that up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black, left is right, right is left, the 2 plus 2 equals 55!
[00:44:28.018 --> 00:44:29.598]  And I'm sorry, it doesn't!
[00:44:30.678 --> 00:44:32.519]  You can say all day it does, it doesn't!
[00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:35.580]  Alright, I'm out of control here.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.561]  John and Mass, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:40.582]  Hi Alex, good to talk to you again, how are ya?
[00:44:41.162 --> 00:44:44.003]  I guess I'm okay, I stayed up too late last night trying to finish this film.
[00:44:45.063 --> 00:44:47.724]  Well, I know all your fans can't wait to see it, but uh...
[00:44:48.137 --> 00:44:50.018]  You know, a couple things I wanted to talk to you about today.
[00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:54.521]  One is, you just mentioned how people see, oh they're brown and good, kill them all.
[00:44:54.662 --> 00:44:57.944]  I was looking at a website at my old job where I used to work.
[00:44:58.724 --> 00:45:01.947]  I was looking at the pictures of a dead kid making my stomach turn.
[00:45:02.007 --> 00:45:06.710]  A couple people came over and said, oh good, they were responsible for 9-11 and they were Iraqis.
[00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:15.696]  And you know that's some soft, weak, stupid, beady-eyed bastard.
[00:45:16.374 --> 00:45:26.279]  Walk over, I know, they walk over, I've posted pictures of like two year olds, blown in half, and I get the emails, good, kill all their people, they're roaches!
[00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:36.764]  Don't you know folks, that comes back on us, you reap what you sow, what comes around goes around, my god, I don't want these sins on me.
[00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:38.705]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:39.355 --> 00:45:42.477]  That's okay, but I had to leave the job because I couldn't deal with the people.
[00:45:43.098 --> 00:45:43.398]  Really?
[00:45:44.759 --> 00:45:45.359]  Describe this.
[00:45:45.379 --> 00:45:49.602]  You're looking at dead children, and what did this Ted Bundy say to you?
[00:45:50.803 --> 00:45:52.764]  He was like, what am I supposed to be upset about this?
[00:45:53.345 --> 00:45:53.945]  Who cares?
[00:45:55.006 --> 00:45:56.847]  They're responsible for 9-11.
[00:45:57.267 --> 00:46:04.052]  Only someone who hasn't really lived, only someone who has never been through hardship could have that decadent attitude.
[00:46:04.853 --> 00:46:06.794]  I absolutely agree, and that was the case.
[00:46:07.554 --> 00:46:08.974]  Believe it or not.
[00:46:08.994 --> 00:46:11.355]  So, I want to hear more about this psychopath.
[00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:12.475]  Okay.
[00:46:13.435 --> 00:46:14.556]  I mean, tell me.
[00:46:14.596 --> 00:46:15.676]  This might help.
[00:46:15.716 --> 00:46:17.096]  He was in the army, too.
[00:46:17.917 --> 00:46:20.577]  He was all bitter that he wasn't over there in Iraq at the time.
[00:46:21.477 --> 00:46:28.219]  And his neighbor who worked in there, too, he was pumping his arms, saying, good, we're getting them all.
[00:46:28.979 --> 00:46:31.280]  And it made me sick.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.540]  It truly, I wanted to throw up.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.381]  And I had to leave the job.
[00:46:37.959 --> 00:46:39.020]  It wasn't a big business.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.600]  It was a realtor's office.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.683]  You know, that guy will cry like a little baby if anything ever happens to one of his children.
[00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:48.204]  Of course he would.
[00:46:48.524 --> 00:46:49.764]  I mean, these are schizophrenics.
[00:46:49.804 --> 00:46:51.165]  These people are like mind-controlled.
[00:46:51.425 --> 00:46:53.626]  They have different personalities for every event.
[00:46:55.007 --> 00:46:56.808]  Folks, that is the height of decadence.
[00:46:57.308 --> 00:46:58.548]  The height of decadence.
[00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.449]  Cheering on dead babies.
[00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.591]  You know, Alex, I got a child of my own.
[00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:04.651]  I got another one on the way.
[00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:06.532]  And after you have a kid,
[00:47:07.783 --> 00:47:14.187]  I mean, the innocence with these children, I mean, they're so innocent, they can't do anything evil.
[00:47:14.627 --> 00:47:18.970]  I know people who have children who talk about how they want to kill all the Iraqi children.
[00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:22.652]  I know, look, they're demon possessed.
[00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.514]  It's really, truly disgusting.
[00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:31.277]  I'm sorry I keep belaboring it, but finish up, John.
[00:47:31.937 --> 00:47:36.020]  Alright, the other thing I wanted to talk about was I got a letter back from my
[00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:46.178]  Congressman, after I called to say that I didn't want them to pass the bill that passed on December 17th, that the President signed on December 17th with the National ID Cards.
[00:47:46.318 --> 00:47:47.559]  Yeah.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:56.988]  Yeah, I got a letter here from him saying that, oh, this had nothing to do with the National ID Cards, but it does dovetail into the 9-11 Commissioner Report and the Homeland Security
[00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:07.791]  Which noted the rising problem of identification fraud and recommended that the federal government... Look, look, look, look, this is what they do.
[00:48:08.091 --> 00:48:18.479]  They say, Rice says, Gonzales says, it's not torture because we say it isn't torture, and it's not a national ID card, you'll have to have a job, it'll be federalized, already happening, and U.S.
[00:48:18.499 --> 00:48:23.423]  Independence Day says it's a national ID card, and Ron Paul says it is, but when you call and complain, they just say it isn't.
[00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:25.425]  So I guess if I walk up and...
[00:48:26.432 --> 00:48:31.995]  Listen, I guess if I walk over and hit you in the head with a hammer and kill you, I'll just say, I didn't kill you because I don't call this death.
[00:48:34.316 --> 00:48:34.796]  Incredible.
[00:48:35.436 --> 00:48:37.417]  Look, you've got to learn to double speak, okay?
[00:48:39.518 --> 00:48:44.560]  So they sent you a letter telling you it wasn't, but then double speak it again and say, but it is to stop on any front.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.903]  Yeah, and then they want to thank me for my support, for my inquiry into the bill that this guy helped co-author.
[00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:55.064]  It's just the arrogance.
[00:48:55.084 --> 00:48:59.906]  That's like calling a machine gun a fire hydrant.
[00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:02.327]  Just because they changed the name doesn't mean it's so.
[00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.188]  But that'll fool these people, man.
[00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.428]  That'll fool the general public.
[00:49:06.468 --> 00:49:06.929]  Are you kidding?
[00:49:06.949 --> 00:49:11.950]  It'll make them feel like they're being active in the whole Democratic-Republican process.
[00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:13.271]  I hear you.
[00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:14.091]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:49:14.671 --> 00:49:15.172]  It's sick.
[00:49:15.832 --> 00:49:20.594]  It's like Ashcroft for six months after he introduced Patriot Act II said it didn't exist.
[00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:24.110]  Well, they said they make reality.
[00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.392]  You know, the White House has said we control reality.
[00:49:26.472 --> 00:49:27.793]  Jeffrey in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:28.213]  Go ahead.
[00:49:28.873 --> 00:49:29.894]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:49:30.014 --> 00:49:31.555]  Long time fan and listener.
[00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:32.576]  Well, good to have you on board.
[00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:32.936]  What's up?
[00:49:33.416 --> 00:49:33.857]  Thank you.
[00:49:34.297 --> 00:49:39.520]  I'd like to take a quick hop, skip, and a jump over to the subject of Social Security.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.802]  And if you covered this on a very recent show, I apologize.
[00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:43.303]  That's alright.
[00:49:43.343 --> 00:49:43.823]  Go ahead.
[00:49:45.004 --> 00:49:48.046]  Well, we're talking about privatizing Social Security, but
[00:49:48.795 --> 00:49:57.262]  What they really seem to be doing is saying, okay, we're going to stop making it a government program, and that may or may not be a good thing.
[00:49:57.823 --> 00:50:01.085]  But what they're saying is, we're going to give you a limited palette of choices.
[00:50:02.066 --> 00:50:06.330]  You can invest it in these stocks, or you can invest it in these stocks.
[00:50:08.978 --> 00:50:15.602]  Nowhere does it say you can take your Social Security, you know, your retirement account and invest in gold.
[00:50:15.622 --> 00:50:16.982]  I don't want you to do that.
[00:50:17.483 --> 00:50:32.991]  And the other question I have is, once this is, quote, privatized, unquote, doesn't this mean the government will have all the power to take away your retirement account if you are discovered to be an enemy of the state?
[00:50:35.063 --> 00:50:39.627]  It certainly will, and all they're doing is the corporations are now becoming the government.
[00:50:40.147 --> 00:50:44.691]  It isn't that we're going into some free market, you know, Chilean pension system.
[00:50:45.612 --> 00:50:51.336]  This is, I think they have a word for it, it begins with an F. Anything else, Jeffrey?
[00:50:52.597 --> 00:50:55.319]  No, just keep up the good fight, I'm on you, I got your back.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.201]  Alright, got my six.
[00:50:57.801 --> 00:50:58.262]  We'll be back.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.826]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.986 --> 00:51:10.452]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.572 --> 00:51:14.958]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[00:51:31.731 --> 00:51:42.299]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.479 --> 00:51:44.621]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,

[00:54:27.837 --> 00:54:30.579]  We're going to get to Tim and Linda and Ken and Howard and everybody else and Russ.
[00:54:31.199 --> 00:54:36.683]  We've got Steve Quill coming up in about ten minutes at the next hour, but I'll try to get some more calls in this segment than in the next segment.
[00:54:37.523 --> 00:54:42.607]  We'll continue with calls throughout the next hour and just a whole mass of other important news items here.
[00:54:44.764 --> 00:54:48.786]  You know, I'm trying to finish this film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:54:49.106 --> 00:54:56.248]  And by the end of the month, it will be at PrisonPlanet.tv and then it'll take a while to get them printed up on DVD and be able to offer it by next month.
[00:54:57.289 --> 00:55:02.671]  I mean, I've just had stuff happen like one hard drive failed and another hard drive failed that was the backup hard drive.
[00:55:02.711 --> 00:55:06.532]  There's nothing more frustrating than, say, losing two weeks of work.
[00:55:06.832 --> 00:55:08.713]  It just drives me up the wall.
[00:55:10.534 --> 00:55:13.375]  And it's the most elaborate film I've ever made.
[00:55:14.842 --> 00:55:21.566]  It's, I mean, there's thousands of edits, thousands of cuts, probably 500 news articles.
[00:55:21.626 --> 00:55:22.266]  It's insane.
[00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:24.107]  I mean, it just, and it covers so much.
[00:55:24.227 --> 00:55:25.268]  And it's not available yet.
[00:55:26.568 --> 00:55:27.909]  And I'm in a really bad mood today.
[00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:38.574]  I don't know if you could notice that because I was up until about three in the morning last night trying to retrieve work that got lost.
[00:55:39.755 --> 00:55:41.116]  We did retrieve most of it.
[00:55:43.685 --> 00:55:46.586]  Boy, I tell you, I feel like the top of my head was going to blow off.
[00:55:47.706 --> 00:55:50.287]  But, you know what?
[00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.267]  I've gone way over budget on this film.
[00:55:52.888 --> 00:55:58.609]  I've already spent, I don't know, like $15,000 on this film.
[00:55:58.809 --> 00:56:05.871]  More than that, by the time it's done, it'll be $22,000 probably.
[00:56:07.852 --> 00:56:09.012]  We need people's support.
[00:56:09.392 --> 00:56:11.933]  I've got three webmasters I pay, another employee,
[00:56:12.895 --> 00:56:17.338]  Another part-time employee, and I tell you, get my videos, make copies of them.
[00:56:19.199 --> 00:56:20.700]  And I need your support.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.162]  I need you to buy the videos I've made so I can make more videos.
[00:56:25.543 --> 00:56:29.466]  And I need you to call and get my videos.
[00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.226]  They're great films.
[00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:38.452]  Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Masters of Terror, Exposed, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:39.492 --> 00:56:40.273]  They're all excellent.
[00:56:41.036 --> 00:56:43.897]  Our newest film is American Dictators, documented in the state's election of 2004.
[00:56:44.577 --> 00:56:48.998]  And it gets into 9-11 and Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones and the fake left-right paradigm.
[00:56:49.278 --> 00:56:52.999]  Get one copy for $19.95, each additional copy for $5.95.
[00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:56.420]  Get as many copies as you want for $5.95 when you buy one.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:03.202]  The regular price I'm offering, my best 9-11 film, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, for $24.95, almost three hours long.
[00:57:03.782 --> 00:57:05.623]  Each additional copy $5.95 on DVD.
[00:57:05.643 --> 00:57:07.143]  Get as many copies as you want.
[00:57:07.808 --> 00:57:08.469]  Please call.
[00:57:08.529 --> 00:57:09.390]  Please get the films.
[00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.511]  Take advantage of the specials.
[00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:14.274]  The specials are on Infowars.com or presentplanet.com.
[00:57:14.294 --> 00:57:17.077]  The Secure Shopping Cart are by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:34.292]  Or you can write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:57:35.873 --> 00:57:36.374]  Don't wait.
[00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:37.374]  Get a bunch of the films.
[00:57:37.735 --> 00:57:38.575]  They're having an effect.
[00:57:38.635 --> 00:57:39.956]  I want to commend those that have gotten them.
[00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:44.199]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.000]  Tim in Ohio.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:46.601]  You're on the air.
[00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:47.021]  Go ahead.
[00:57:47.478 --> 00:57:47.998]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:57:48.018 --> 00:57:48.898]  How are you doing?
[00:57:49.339 --> 00:57:52.680]  I hope I'm sending you some positive energy that you'll get in a better mood.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.740]  You know, I woke up in a bad mood today, too, and you know what I did?
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.801]  I played back last week, Coast to Coast, when you did the Mike Myers.
[00:57:57.821 --> 00:57:59.262]  It did me out of heat.
[00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:00.702]  Could you do that real quick?
[00:58:00.882 --> 00:58:02.523]  Look at the size of that head!
[00:58:02.543 --> 00:58:04.583]  It's got its own weather systems!
[00:58:04.883 --> 00:58:09.585]  It's... What's the group that secretly runs things?
[00:58:10.993 --> 00:58:11.914]  The trifecta?
[00:58:11.934 --> 00:58:12.915]  No, it's not the trifecta.
[00:58:12.935 --> 00:58:15.017]  He says the, uh... It's the Pope!
[00:58:15.498 --> 00:58:16.178]  The Queen!
[00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:17.319]  The Gettys!
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.603]  And Colonel Sanders, with his wee, bitty eyes!
[00:58:22.084 --> 00:58:22.625]  That's good.
[00:58:23.365 --> 00:58:26.629]  Socrates said, you know, wisdom is knowing how little we know.
[00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:37.525]  And you were talking about that earlier, you know, what we need to do as we investigate this and push forward is to always have our reach exceed our grasp, and never stop reaching.
[00:58:37.966 --> 00:58:49.833]  And after the break, if I can come back, I'd like to talk to you about Scarborough last night and how they attacked this doctor from the U of T. Alright, we'll come back in 70 seconds with the second hour of transmission.
[00:58:57.748 --> 00:58:58.408]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:00.149]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:01.971]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.611 --> 00:59:03.411]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.172 --> 00:59:05.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.072 --> 00:59:09.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.915 --> 00:59:14.058]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.238 --> 00:59:16.739]  Alright, folks.
[00:59:16.919 --> 00:59:21.162]  We're back live into the second hour.
[00:59:22.574 --> 00:59:24.615]  We've got a great guest coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:59:24.975 --> 00:59:29.077]  Steve Quayle will talk about the geopolitical scene and the New World Order.
[00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:30.978]  Continuing with your phone calls.
[00:59:31.538 --> 00:59:38.941]  For those that just joined us or heard the last few minutes of the last hour, I don't believe Colonel Sanders runs the New World Order of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:41.542]  That was a joke, and I can't remember the name of the film.
[00:59:42.702 --> 00:59:48.665]  I was on Coast to Coast AM and a caller called in, razzing me, going, uh, yeah, it's the, uh,
[00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:55.943]  You know, the trifecta, the secret group that runs the New World Order, and he was joking, and I go, oh yeah, you mean the Mike Myers movie?
[00:59:56.183 --> 01:00:03.348]  I forget the name, he's like a crazy Scot, living in New York, and he's making fun of his grandkids, and he goes, look at the size of that head!
[01:00:03.928 --> 01:00:07.350]  And, you know, the kid's got this giant head, and he goes, it's own weather systems!
[01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:18.477]  And then he, uh, he goes, he talks about who runs the New World Order, and he makes the, you know, the Pope, the Queen, the Gettys, and Colonel Sanders with his wee-bitty eyes, so.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.502]  It's a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:23.865]  Maybe somebody will call in and tell me the name of that movie.
[01:00:23.885 --> 01:00:25.808]  We can find that clip online and play it.
[01:00:26.409 --> 01:00:27.310]  It's pretty funny.
[01:00:27.731 --> 01:00:29.614]  But real quick, Tim, finish up what you were saying.
[01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:34.121]  Oh yeah, last night, I know you were busy working, but old Ferret Bay, Scarborough.
[01:00:35.044 --> 01:00:36.705]  Talk about beady eyes!
[01:00:36.725 --> 01:00:41.186]  Yeah, maybe you could put his pictures to that audio.
[01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:54.371]  Anyway, Scarborough and this guy, I think his name is Len Horowitz, were just grilling this doctor, I can't remember his name, he was from the University of Texas, and it was another total assault on the First Amendment.
[01:00:54.751 --> 01:01:00.794]  Apparently some college professor out in Colorado somewhere was being charged... Were they grilling Robert Jensen?
[01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:02.474]  Robert Jensen, yeah, that's him.
[01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.095]  Oh, that guy's a real piece of work.
[01:01:05.313 --> 01:01:06.575]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:01:06.615 --> 01:01:15.464]  The globalists will set two pieces of garbage next to each other, and then have a debate, and then make you choose which piece of garbage you want to listen to.
[01:01:16.185 --> 01:01:17.787]  Robert, I mean, I knew who they'd have on.
[01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:18.988]  That guy's a globalist.
[01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:21.411]  I mean, see, I guessed who they had on.
[01:01:22.552 --> 01:01:24.935]  And then Ward Churchill is a little better.
[01:01:28.004 --> 01:01:29.725]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:01:29.745 --> 01:01:34.626]  I'm aware of the Ward Churchill comments about 9-11 happened because we oppress indigenous peoples.
[01:01:34.906 --> 01:01:36.146]  No, Mr. Churchill!
[01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:38.247]  You're playing into the phony socialist garbage!
[01:01:38.427 --> 01:01:41.528]  It happened because the military-industrial complex engineered it!
[01:01:42.148 --> 01:01:44.769]  And don't say the people deserved to die in the towers!
[01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:46.029]  They were good people!
[01:01:46.749 --> 01:01:48.250]  And those firemen were heroes!
[01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:51.074]  So, see that's what they do.
[01:01:51.114 --> 01:01:53.275]  That's how the left-right paradigm works.
[01:01:53.315 --> 01:01:58.217]  They set a piece of garbage up against another piece of garbage, and then you choose one of the pieces of garbage.
[01:01:58.477 --> 01:02:05.340]  No, I don't choose Robert Jensen, and I don't choose Churchill, Ward Churchill, and I do not choose BDI either.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.081]  Or ask me, BDI is the worst.
[01:02:10.762 --> 01:02:18.586]  You were talking before about the civilian casualties, and I remember I heard Colin Powell do this thing where they ask him about the civilian casualties, and his response was,
[01:02:18.925 --> 01:02:20.646]  Well, we don't even count them.
[01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:21.327]  No, they don't.
[01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:22.728]  That's the first thing they did.
[01:02:22.748 --> 01:02:23.749]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:24.729 --> 01:02:27.371]  Let's go ahead, and I'm just going to talk about that later.
[01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:28.172]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:02:28.572 --> 01:02:30.994]  Let's go ahead and talk to Linda in Missouri.
[01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:31.795]  Alex?
[01:02:32.075 --> 01:02:32.555]  Hello.
[01:02:32.795 --> 01:02:35.197]  I'd like to put out two national red alerts.
[01:02:36.038 --> 01:02:36.738]  Red alerts?
[01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:37.959]  Red alerts.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.501]  Okay.
[01:02:40.161 --> 01:02:40.641]  Okay.
[01:02:40.982 --> 01:02:42.883]  Rob and Paul's free phone number first.
[01:02:42.903 --> 01:02:42.923]  1-888.
[01:02:48.303 --> 01:02:48.343]  322-1414.
[01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:52.925]  That's his legislative update.
[01:02:53.566 --> 01:02:53.826]  Right.
[01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:56.127]  And it's about the children.
[01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:57.968]  You know, our new freedom initiative.
[01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.629]  Yeah, I read part of his alert two days ago.
[01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.850]  That's a good idea.
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.930]  Give me that number again.
[01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:07.352]  The network used to error those once a day or twice a day.
[01:03:07.372 --> 01:03:11.934]  Well, you've got to get this out today and any day before it goes off the air.
[01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.155]  Okay, just give me the phone number again.
[01:03:13.175 --> 01:03:13.235]  1-888-414-1414.
[01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:26.371]  3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4.
[01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:26.371]  Yeah, maybe we'll call that and play that on air, but finish up what you were saying.
[01:03:26.831 --> 01:03:32.997]  Okay, the other alert has to do with... It does.
[01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:33.698]  It has to do with that?
[01:03:34.159 --> 01:03:37.061]  It has to do with Senate Bill 3.
[01:03:39.184 --> 01:03:39.585]  You know what?
[01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:41.207]  I'm going to calls later with Steve Quayle.
[01:03:41.227 --> 01:03:42.329]  You want to hold and talk about it then?
[01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:43.811]  That'd be great, because I want to hear this from you.
[01:03:44.512 --> 01:03:46.054]  I don't want to shortchange you.
[01:03:46.535 --> 01:03:47.657]  Linda, I appreciate you.
[01:03:48.278 --> 01:03:50.201]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:53.149 --> 01:04:00.014]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:01.696]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.876 --> 01:04:04.098]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.238 --> 01:04:06.319]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.543]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:15.907]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.147 --> 01:04:17.928]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.009 --> 01:04:28.657]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:30.698]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.899 --> 01:04:34.761]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:04:34.862 --> 01:04:36.443]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:04:36.463 --> 01:04:36.983]  That's 888-2533139.

[01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.235]  Terrorism!
[01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:54.136]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.216 --> 01:05:00.277]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:00.537 --> 01:05:02.138]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:02.378 --> 01:05:04.859]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.239 --> 01:05:19.803]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:19.843 --> 01:05:20.143]  government.

[01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:55.075]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:55.315 --> 01:05:55.655]  Why?
[01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.617]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:05:58.697 --> 01:06:03.639]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:06:03.779 --> 01:06:08.942]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle.
[01:06:10.159 --> 01:06:21.767]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:06:39.326 --> 01:06:42.709]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:43.270]  Why?
[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.252]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:06:46.313 --> 01:06:51.277]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:06:51.397 --> 01:07:00.406]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite... From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.006 --> 01:07:03.989]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:16.933]  All right, folks, here we are.
[01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:21.236]  Eight minutes, 30 seconds, roughly, into the second hour.
[01:07:21.256 --> 01:07:23.657]  It is Friday, the fourth day of February 2005.
[01:07:24.618 --> 01:07:30.882]  And we've got a lot of news to talk about in the next hour and a half or so.
[01:07:30.902 --> 01:07:33.243]  We're going to have our guest, Steve Quayle, with us.
[01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:37.106]  And, of course, we're also going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:07:37.666 --> 01:07:40.108]  Steve Quayle is an expert on the New World Order.
[01:07:40.128 --> 01:07:44.811]  He's been broadcasting for the decade, written best-selling books on survival,
[01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:53.685]  And he's well-versed on the perils of the New World Order, as well as the occult aspects of the globalist hierarchy.
[01:07:54.105 --> 01:07:56.167]  And Steve, it's great to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:07:56.407 --> 01:07:57.247]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:07:57.527 --> 01:08:00.709]  It's a delight and joy to be on with you at this time of day.
[01:08:03.723 --> 01:08:14.992]  For people that just joined us, that for the first time ever tuned in, say listening to us in Chicago right now, or listening to us in Austin, Texas, and they're saying, what are these guys talking about?
[01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:16.873]  What is the New World Order?
[01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:19.115]  What are we societally facing?
[01:08:19.793 --> 01:08:38.119]  What we're facing, Alex, is an occult-based, world-governing body that seeks to destroy five and a half billion people off the planet and to insert a new creation of their own making called transhumanists, or a transhumanistic creation.
[01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:50.168]  What it is, it's some of the most evil, wicked, supernaturally determined and funded entities that control the politics, the finances, and the entire religious system of the world at this point.
[01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:54.055]  It's basically the book of Revelation unfolding right before our very eyes.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:05.167]  And at the very same time, a lot of the so-called big establishment Christian churches are saying, microchips aren't bad, and the big national talk show hosts are saying, take the microchip!
[01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:07.688]  And they're saying, world government's good!
[01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:08.549]  Let's accept it!
[01:09:09.284 --> 01:09:34.810]  Well, you know, you and I have been on the radio for over a decade, warning people of all this stuff, and Alex, don't you find it interesting that right now, everything we've talked about a decade ago is right in our lap, and now you've got people making excuses, especially mainstream Christians, that, oh, this can't be the mark of the beast, this can't be the world government of the Antichrist, because we're supposed to be gone before that all comes, and I submit to you that
[01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:45.938]  The pre-tribulation rapture has pretty much isolated reality-based Christianity, but it's also put the entire church at large to sleep.
[01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:51.582]  That's why we see all these things going on, the freedoms that we once enjoyed as Christian America.
[01:09:51.922 --> 01:09:54.344]  You detail all of the different assaults on
[01:09:55.064 --> 01:09:59.266]  On America, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, daily on your website.
[01:09:59.646 --> 01:10:00.607]  And talk about them too.
[01:10:00.627 --> 01:10:06.770]  But again, Alex, right now what people have got to understand is we're not approaching the midnight hour.
[01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.250]  We're in the midnight hour.
[01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:17.655]  And it is a future that is so horrid, so wicked, so dangerous, so deadly, so frustratingly freakish.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:32.389]  That most people simply can only grasp the things that you talk about, or I talk about, and we talk about together in tablespoonfuls because, you know, again, we've tried for a decade to tell people, look out folks, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
[01:10:32.489 --> 01:10:34.590]  Now all we have is one statement, it's here.
[01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:45.397]  Well, you know, you talk about the rapture movement, and I'm not going to get into debates with people about whether it's pre, post, you know, whatever.
[01:10:46.265 --> 01:10:48.191]  My only point is this.
[01:10:49.978 --> 01:10:51.844]  When Hitler was slaughtering Christians,
[01:10:52.719 --> 01:10:53.659]  They weren't raptured.
[01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:56.580]  When they're killing Christians in Sudan, they're not being raptured.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.242]  When the Romans killed thousands of Christians, hundreds of thousands of Christians, when eleven of the twelve disciples were killed, they weren't raptured.
[01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:13.864]  We're told how we go through trials and tribulations, but then I know so many good Christian people who just say, oh, I'm glad they're talking about the ship.
[01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:17.565]  That means we'll soon be out of here, teleported out of here.
[01:11:19.577 --> 01:11:25.762]  Bottom line, regardless of what's going on, I have a responsibility to warn people to fight this evil.
[01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:35.630]  And let's say even if there was this pre-tribulation rapture, still, if I don't warn people about the New World Order, they're not going to wake up to it.
[01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.032]  They're going to be deceived!
[01:11:37.685 --> 01:11:59.521]  Well, absolutely, and again, the issue isn't really, and I'm glad you point that out, isn't really the rapture issue per se, but what has happened, Alex, in response to your question to me, is why are 51 million Americans who profess to be evangelical Christians pretty much sitting idly by or at astonishingly silent
[01:12:00.269 --> 01:12:00.950]  I don't think so.
[01:12:16.883 --> 01:12:19.444]  I'll be aware of the information we provide.
[01:12:19.484 --> 01:12:22.424]  And I find that when people, you know, I challenge them.
[01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:24.025]  I say, look, listen to what we're doing.
[01:12:24.405 --> 01:12:32.667]  Look at what, for instance, in your case, the videos you produce, and then tell me logically, based on all the evidence out there, if you buy the whole lie.
[01:12:32.727 --> 01:12:36.928]  And look, Alex, we know the Bible itself talks about incredible delusion.
[01:12:37.308 --> 01:12:41.769]  It talks about a time when men are going to be lovers of themselves more than God.
[01:12:41.789 --> 01:12:43.870]  And what we're seeing right now, in my opinion,
[01:12:44.230 --> 01:13:13.267]  We've gone from fourth gear into hypersonic overdrive, and I'm astonished at how quickly people forget the words of our founding fathers, how quickly people don't get that if you're being stopped for random traffic stops, and being thumbprinted, etc., and that chips and all of the technologically decadent plans that these guys have for us, it becomes obvious to me, and at least I think it should be to everyone else,
[01:13:13.647 --> 01:13:17.470]  That their freedoms are being curtailed, and that's something that people have got to understand.
[01:13:17.751 --> 01:13:28.199]  Not only are their freedoms going to be curtailed, but in their mind, anybody who resists the New World Order, or Lucifer's reign on Earth, are to be basically annihilated.
[01:13:28.299 --> 01:13:33.904]  And that's the thing that's amazing to me, because let's say the guys who believe they're out of here before trouble
[01:13:34.604 --> 01:13:40.248]  Let's say it turns out to be mid, the issue isn't when it happens, it's are they ready?
[01:13:40.609 --> 01:13:44.211]  And are the people armed with enough knowledge to realize what's coming upon them?
[01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:46.833]  And my answer to that is, I don't think so, the majority.
[01:13:47.754 --> 01:14:00.363]  Well, David Spangler in the 1990 publication, Director of Planetary Initiatives, official UN document, no one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer.
[01:14:01.033 --> 01:14:05.516]  No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.
[01:14:05.756 --> 01:14:09.399]  And for those who just joined us, I have a news broadcast, so do you.
[01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.140]  We're reporting on the news.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:22.308]  Understand, folks, even if you don't believe in God, which I think is very foolish, every time I study the New World Order, I study global government, it leads back to the devil.
[01:14:22.969 --> 01:14:24.049]  This is what they believe.
[01:14:24.109 --> 01:14:27.772]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, numerology, the occult.
[01:14:28.683 --> 01:14:32.352]  A few weeks ago I was on your radio show, front page of the Austin American-Statesman.
[01:14:32.372 --> 01:14:34.297]  We posted it on Infowars.com.
[01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.651]  As well as at your website, SteveQuell.com.
[01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:58.376]  They're at the Q-Files, and there were witches, Wiccan witches, with Christian leaders from seven denominations of Christians, linking hands, walking in a circle, doing a chant, christening the new three six-story buildings that are made of bronze, the new, again, it's all numerology, downtown.
[01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:01.797]  And folks, this is what they're calling for, world religion.
[01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:05.507]  Folks, even if you don't believe in God, the globalists do.
[01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.570]  They just think the devil is God.
[01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:12.693]  Can you speak to the admitted fact that we're dealing with devil worshippers?
[01:15:12.713 --> 01:15:37.667]  Well, absolutely, because when you're dealing with the mystery religions, Alex, from the beginning of history, whether it was Mystery Babylon, the Egyptian secret societies, even within Pharaoh's court, there have always been a group of very wealthy and very initiated individuals all the way into Freemasonry and all the way into all of the New Age offshoots that have believed that they are possessors of hidden or arcane knowledge.
[01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:56.431]  When you look at the very base of this, and as you understand, you've studied it, the worship of Lucifer and the invocation of evil spirits, supernatural, demonic entities, and I would say outside of the normal realm of knowledge is always invoked, or it's always projected that they possess this.
[01:15:56.471 --> 01:16:06.714]  And if you become a member of the group, you will be imparted with this supernatural knowledge, which brings you to what David Spangler is calling an initiation, or a Luciferic initiation.
[01:16:07.174 --> 01:16:10.379]  So one doesn't have to, you know, take your word or my word.
[01:16:10.419 --> 01:16:17.228]  We just go and quote the guys that are the forerunners of this whole movement and pretty much tell people, this is what it says.
[01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:20.272]  And then when the actions follow the 100, 200, or 300 to 5,000 year old plan,
[01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:28.718]  The plan is, the great one, as they refer to Lucifer, is coming on the scene.
[01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:48.353]  You know what's amazing to me, Alex, is that every time we hear of the skull and bones, when it was both Bonesman 1, Kerry Bonesman 2, Bush, why, you know, I mean, the press skirted it, and you know, you dealt with it, but the mainstream just passed off and accepted a stupid statement, well, it's secret, well, we can't talk about it.
[01:16:48.373 --> 01:16:52.897]  Well, the questions are, what is secret, what you can't talk about, and is it a good thing?
[01:16:53.297 --> 01:16:58.711]  To have people who practice secrecy of an occult nature running the government.
[01:16:58.731 --> 01:17:01.538]  The answer to that is they have been in charge, they are in charge.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.001]  Every single one of their dates they use has a mystical or a supernatural reference point.
[01:17:07.642 --> 01:17:17.044]  All of their ceremonies, all of their initiations or inaugurations are all timed to send an occultic message to the brethren around the world.
[01:17:17.465 --> 01:17:18.105]  Well, you're right.
[01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:24.887]  You know, I'm doing a film exposing the occult nature of the New World Order integrated with the police state in 9-11.
[01:17:26.527 --> 01:17:29.208]  And in that, I've been doing massive research on the Nazis.
[01:17:30.289 --> 01:17:30.690]  Absolutely.
[01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:36.333]  And in World War I, they didn't wear the little skull and crossbones on their caps.
[01:17:36.373 --> 01:17:37.414]  You know, Hitler didn't invent that.
[01:17:37.734 --> 01:17:40.756]  I have the field marshals with horns on their heads.
[01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:44.598]  Not one point, but horns with huge skulls.
[01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:46.139]  Skull and crossbones.
[01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:47.780]  You know, fool society.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.163]  And this is the Germanic death cult that is skull and bones.
[01:17:52.183 --> 01:17:53.104]  This is all admitted.
[01:17:53.124 --> 01:17:55.165]  And I don't think people understand this.
[01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:57.306]  This is a cult of murder and death.
[01:17:57.386 --> 01:17:58.367]  Of black magic.
[01:17:59.128 --> 01:18:03.852]  These are people who worship the very crock of doom, death itself!
[01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:12.259]  Well, and you know, Nietzsche played a very important part and role in Germany, and these people have a love affair with death.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.366]  When you're dealing with Hitler, you've got to understand that the men who were behind the scenes of Adolf Hitler were deep into the occult.
[01:18:21.406 --> 01:18:26.831]  You talk about the Thule Society, there was a group within the SS called the Ahnenerbe,
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:36.019]  And they sent their agents all over the world, Alex, to find every kind of occult or religious relic that was believed to have supernatural power.
[01:18:36.319 --> 01:18:44.681]  Just last year, they found a graveyard, I think, in the Ukraine, where they found a bunch of guys with holes drilled in their skull where the third eye was.
[01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:47.002]  And people have thought, oh, that was not real.
[01:18:47.082 --> 01:18:48.002]  Well, it was very real.
[01:18:48.042 --> 01:18:48.862]  They found the skull.
[01:18:49.322 --> 01:18:50.543]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:18:50.823 --> 01:18:51.443]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.784 --> 01:18:55.244]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:18:55.777 --> 01:19:00.078]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:19:00.478 --> 01:19:01.338]  It still is!
[01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:05.459]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:19:05.779 --> 01:19:07.579]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:19:08.139 --> 01:19:10.219]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.780]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:20.801]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:24.942]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:59.333]  Hey, I have lost over 40 pounds now with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and I'll tell you, it has made a huge difference in my life.
[01:19:59.593 --> 01:20:01.555]  Carla Jarrett's with me from Vim and Vigor.
[01:20:01.655 --> 01:20:05.677]  One of the things I wanted to mention was a few months ago, my doctor had been concerned about my blood pressure.
[01:20:05.857 --> 01:20:14.322]  I went back, you know, and this was like 40 pounds later, and my blood pressure was the lowest I could ever remember it being, and they just looked at it and went, oh, that's good.
[01:20:14.562 --> 01:20:15.563]  We actually find that a lot.
[01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:17.744]  I mean, obviously, there's no drug in Collagenate.
[01:20:18.044 --> 01:20:26.153]  But as people take it and they're losing weight, of course, things like blood pressure improve, cholesterol improve, diabetics do very well because it's a protein supplement.
[01:20:26.274 --> 01:20:30.859]  The nice thing with collagenate is it's safe to take and then of course those conditions tend to improve.
[01:20:31.219 --> 01:20:32.180]  Right, because of the weight loss.
[01:20:32.841 --> 01:20:34.683]  So call and order Vim and Vickers Collagenate.
[01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:38.688]  I've lost 40 pounds, my blood pressure is lower, my energy level is through the roof.
[01:20:39.088 --> 01:20:40.450]  Call 1-800-622-8446 to order Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.611]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:20:40.671 --> 01:20:42.734]  You'll get $25 off your first 3-month order.
[01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:42.814]  1-800-622-8446.
[01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:58.967]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.327 --> 01:21:03.410]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:04.251]  We listened.
[01:21:04.571 --> 01:21:09.555]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:09.815 --> 01:21:10.316]  We listened.
[01:21:10.696 --> 01:21:13.738]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.159 --> 01:21:14.699]  We listened.
[01:21:15.159 --> 01:21:18.302]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:21:18.422 --> 01:21:18.682]  I think?
[01:21:45.235 --> 01:21:56.002]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.643 --> 01:22:03.307]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:22:04.468 --> 01:22:06.769]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:13.654]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crime.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:22.802]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:22:23.822 --> 01:22:31.664]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:32.525 --> 01:22:34.065]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:34.085 --> 01:22:34.445]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:42.142 --> 01:22:42.182]  516-8736.
[01:22:42.302 --> 01:22:42.883]  Call now.
[01:22:43.023 --> 01:22:46.949]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:22:56.289 --> 01:22:56.710]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.772]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.272 --> 01:23:02.035]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.456 --> 01:23:05.939]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:05.979 --> 01:23:10.484]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:11.025 --> 01:23:12.967]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.949]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:23:19.009 --> 01:23:21.030]  I mean, it's mainstream.
[01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:24.471]  We're talking rise and fall of the Third Reich type stuff.
[01:23:25.011 --> 01:23:27.652]  That the Nazis were totally obsessed with the occult.
[01:23:28.392 --> 01:23:36.215]  They would go take blond-haired, blue-eyed men and cut their heads off and then try to use them to see into the future.
[01:23:36.715 --> 01:23:38.756]  Or as Steve was just saying, drill holes in their head.
[01:23:39.136 --> 01:23:42.297]  Well, that's the Thule Society and the Thule Society and others
[01:23:42.953 --> 01:23:44.850]  And Madame Blavatsky and the rest of it.
[01:23:45.998 --> 01:23:47.619]  And this is the Order of Death.
[01:23:47.699 --> 01:23:54.523]  This is the Germanic Death Society that is dominant now in this country that George Bush and John Kerry are both members of.
[01:23:55.444 --> 01:24:00.087]  And how do the so-called mainstream Christians get around the skull and bones, Steve?
[01:24:00.127 --> 01:24:02.248]  I guess they say, oh, well, that was just when they were young men.
[01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:14.315]  But as old men, they go to Bohemian Grove and worship Moloch, and so they merge the Canaanite deity with the Germanic Death Deities.
[01:24:14.355 --> 01:24:15.036]  Comments on that?
[01:24:15.956 --> 01:24:33.267]  First of all, the word occult means hidden from view and concealed, and Alex, right from the beginning of the current administration, the secrecy that has surrounded everything that has been associated with the last four years and will be with the next four years is all based on that key bit, hidden from view.
[01:24:33.427 --> 01:24:37.149]  Well, they've reported on Bush having a fetish for secrecy.
[01:24:37.309 --> 01:24:38.150]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.611]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.292]  The Bible is very clear in 1 Corinthians.
[01:24:42.312 --> 01:24:47.934]  You cannot partake of the Lord's cup, I mean the communion cup of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the cup of devils.
[01:24:48.314 --> 01:25:02.480]  What you've documented in your whole series of videos is, in relationship to the bohemian grove and especially the skull and bones, is that these guys absolutely are partakers of a cup of devils.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.942]  They can call it what they want, but Paul had to deal with that very same
[01:25:07.538 --> 01:25:13.402]  Mentality of the very same evil spirits when he was physically alive on earth before his martyrdom.
[01:25:13.582 --> 01:25:24.328]  And you know, the thing that I think people got to understand is that Christians, in my opinion, okay, are woefully and by the act of their free will
[01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:32.731]  choosing to be ignorant, because again, we're a product, as you and I both know, we're a product of continual mind control.
[01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:38.353]  There is nothing that we have that's presented to us in the mainstream.
[01:25:38.473 --> 01:25:41.414]  In my opinion, that's reality-based, okay?
[01:25:41.975 --> 01:25:44.536]  And here's a quote that one of your listeners just sent me.
[01:25:44.696 --> 01:25:46.396]  Eric from Austin said this.
[01:25:46.936 --> 01:25:50.898]  We are, and he's quoting one of, I guess, Bush administration senior advisors.
[01:25:51.249 --> 01:25:55.333]  We are an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
[01:25:55.793 --> 01:26:01.378]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, we'll act again, creating other new realities.
[01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:04.336]  Which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
[01:26:04.716 --> 01:26:09.657]  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.
[01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:17.439]  Yeah, that was in the New York Times, and that was purported to be Karl Rove telling him, hey, we'll change reality today, tomorrow, next week.
[01:26:17.819 --> 01:26:23.981]  And so, Ben, I want to give that quote specifically to answer your question, Alex, because this is what's happened.
[01:26:24.401 --> 01:26:28.722]  The gospel of Jesus Christ, the good news of Jesus, is secondary, you know.
[01:26:29.062 --> 01:26:31.506]  You and I spoke about that on my show a couple of weeks ago.
[01:26:31.846 --> 01:26:42.161]  You can talk about anybody, anything, no matter how gross, perverted, disgusting, wicked, hateful, pornographic, but if you talk about Jesus, you're automatically censored.
[01:26:42.221 --> 01:26:43.904]  As we're finding out, you saw that the judge
[01:26:44.284 --> 01:26:55.929]  ruled against those Christians in Pittsburgh, or as it was in Pittsburgh, the ones that were preaching on the street corner, and now the judge has ruled against them that it's a hate crime to quote biblical scriptures concerning alternative life.
[01:26:55.949 --> 01:26:56.209]  Yeah, I know.
[01:26:56.269 --> 01:26:56.850]  I interviewed them.
[01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.051]  It was in the Associated Press in Philadelphia.
[01:26:59.071 --> 01:27:00.611]  They had video of all of it.
[01:27:00.631 --> 01:27:01.372]  The police had video.
[01:27:01.412 --> 01:27:12.817]  They had a permitted area in their own little free speech zone, and then the people from the, quote, Outfest came and got around them and screamed at them, and the police said, you made them scream at you by
[01:27:13.757 --> 01:27:19.822]  Praying aloud, that could have caused violence, and now they're going to get 47 years in prison apiece.
[01:27:20.363 --> 01:27:22.725]  And where is the outrage of the Christian Church?
[01:27:22.745 --> 01:27:24.787]  You know, anymore I don't even use that word.
[01:27:24.827 --> 01:27:32.594]  I try and use a... Well, it's like Bush promoting to a federal judgeship the Attorney General of Alabama, the one after Judge Roy Moore.
[01:27:32.894 --> 01:27:34.695]  Absolutely, and remember when that was happening?
[01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:39.800]  I think you and I were the two guys saying, look at who's calling the shots and pulling the strings.
[01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:44.998]  You know, and outside of what, whether it may be two or three hundred Christians, the entire Christian Church.
[01:27:45.038 --> 01:27:52.102]  Look, Jesus talks about a time of such great deception, except the days would be shortened, even the elect would be deceived.
[01:27:52.522 --> 01:27:55.263]  And Alex, I know you must sense the same frustration I do.
[01:27:55.603 --> 01:28:02.587]  You know, you know how much effort you put into this and how many times you're on the radio, your show, my show, other shows.
[01:28:03.087 --> 01:28:10.150]  Uh, coast to coast, and we tell everybody, look, this is what's happening, and now and then, a few people, and in many cases, quite a few people, get it.
[01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:13.272]  But the bottom line is, this is a steamroller, everyone.
[01:28:13.312 --> 01:28:22.376]  This is a steamroller that's got, it's a supercharged steamroller, and basically that last quote I just said means, uh, you know, if you don't get out of our way, we'll just bowl you over.
[01:28:22.476 --> 01:28:25.758]  And as Hitler started to terminate his enemies,
[01:28:26.358 --> 01:28:30.422]  So will the fourth and the fifth and the final right terminate their enemies.
[01:28:30.502 --> 01:28:38.088]  And remember, an enemy of the New World Order is to be put to death in the prison camps and everything else that you and I have talked about all these years, Alex.
[01:28:38.489 --> 01:28:39.249]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:39.269 --> 01:28:41.391]  We'll talk about some politics and take calls.
[01:28:43.893 --> 01:28:44.774]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.254 --> 01:28:46.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.776 --> 01:28:50.479]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.479 --> 01:28:57.682]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:28:58.442 --> 01:29:06.708]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:09.029]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:15.714]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:29:16.354 --> 01:29:17.915]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:29:18.456 --> 01:29:20.617]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:29:21.218 --> 01:29:23.179]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:29:23.769 --> 01:29:24.870]  And it's so easy.
[01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:27.631]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:29:28.431 --> 01:29:29.071]  When you want.
[01:29:29.591 --> 01:29:30.252]  Where you want.
[01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:36.074]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[01:29:36.895 --> 01:29:39.736]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[01:29:39.756 --> 01:29:40.556]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:29:40.676 --> 01:29:40.996]  That's 419-WORD.
[01:29:41.016 --> 01:29:41.156]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:56.272]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.572 --> 01:30:01.513]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.753 --> 01:30:06.114]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:15.317]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.537 --> 01:30:19.158]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.438 --> 01:30:24.481]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.761 --> 01:30:31.464]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:31.989 --> 01:30:32.630]  What about you?
[01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:38.635]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:55.166 --> 01:31:00.650]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:05.314]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:05.534 --> 01:31:12.539]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.939 --> 01:31:19.041]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.181 --> 01:31:20.441]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.761 --> 01:31:23.702]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.862 --> 01:31:24.762]  Eliminate the cost.
[01:31:24.822 --> 01:31:25.843]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:26.183 --> 01:31:33.425]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.725 --> 01:31:37.106]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.208]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[01:31:42.228 --> 01:31:46.290]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:48.171]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:20.242]  Alright folks, we're back live talking to Steve Quayle.
[01:32:21.643 --> 01:32:23.284]  And we're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:32:23.344 --> 01:32:25.585]  Steve, tell folks about your website and what you do.
[01:32:26.471 --> 01:32:36.576]  Well, for the last ten years, I've been trying to get people's attention as to the role of technology and the control of technology, Alex, by the occultists.
[01:32:36.616 --> 01:32:50.122]  My new book, Genetic Armageddon, is probably the scariest thing I think has ever been written because I basically deal everything from the ancient secret societies all the way forward to the Nazis, to the currents, and to what I call the transhumanists.
[01:32:50.142 --> 01:32:55.585]  You know, in the last 24 to 48 hours, many of the foremost scientists in this realm
[01:32:55.965 --> 01:33:08.733]  have basically declared, God is dead, they're God, they're going to create a new uberman or superman, just like Nietzsche talked about, and you Christians had better take note because your days are numbered.
[01:33:09.133 --> 01:33:19.160]  So what I've tried to do over the years is basically talk about the things that I saw on the horizon, whether it was bacteriological, chemical, nuclear terrorism,
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:31.564]  Man, Alex, I was a lone voice for a lot of years, and, you know, just with the contempt and everyone not wanting to believe it, then things changed in the Tokyo subway attack by the Aomishinrikyo.
[01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:35.585]  Now, again, for pretty much that same amount of years,
[01:33:36.101 --> 01:33:48.947]  I would interview, as you have, some of the foremost minds in the world, guys who invented the neutron bomb, guys who were perfecting red mercury, only to be told by three-letter agencies, oh, this stuff doesn't exist.
[01:33:49.007 --> 01:33:56.450]  And it was interesting, as you know, there are certain shows that you do when you're quoted on Coast to Coast, or as a guest on Coast to Coast, or I am.
[01:33:56.490 --> 01:34:04.974]  The minute we talk about some of this stuff, immediately within 24 to 48 hours, there are stories, you know, trying to feed the sheep the antidote for the truth.
[01:34:05.393 --> 01:34:16.895]  So I guess my whole goal and quest in life has been to inform people, to prepare them physically and spiritually to recognize, look, this is a real time period.
[01:34:17.155 --> 01:34:22.916]  Whether you call it the end time, the end of days, whatever, the bottom line is, is tribulation.
[01:34:22.996 --> 01:34:30.858]  We're dealing with a group of individuals that have had thousands of years with a supernatural general whose name is Satan,
[01:34:31.328 --> 01:34:43.743]  To place their men, their money, and their thought processes into the world's ruling elite to set up, ultimately, the destruction camps or the destroying camps.
[01:34:44.064 --> 01:34:45.525]  Some people call them prison camps.
[01:34:45.726 --> 01:34:46.106]  I don't.
[01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:47.568]  I call them execution centers.
[01:34:48.055 --> 01:35:01.138]  You know, when we were talking about all the foreign troops in the country, all the foreign troops in Canada, in China, excuse me, in Canada, the Chinese, the Russians, Mexico, all this stuff, it was all poo-pooed, well, where would you put all those people?
[01:35:01.478 --> 01:35:15.061]  Then we came to the orchestrated necessity of having Al-Qaeda, and for the record, when most people didn't know who bin Laden was, I was on record stating, we're going into a new crusade, because that's exactly
[01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:26.190]  What Albert Pike stated in Morals and Dogma about the Third World War being orchestrated to kill off the Jews, get the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims fighting each other.
[01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:40.642]  And I think people have got to understand, Alex, you know, I get emails like you do, everybody wants to blame the Jews, everybody wants to blame the Hispanics, everybody wants to blame, everybody wants to blame the wrong guys, not that there aren't evil men in all those groups.
[01:35:41.022 --> 01:35:51.288]  But the bottom line is, is we've got a real important situation brewing right now, where we've got, you know, we don't, again, we're right at
[01:35:52.301 --> 01:35:57.225]  The events that have been orchestrated, whether it's weather engineering, the chemtrails.
[01:35:58.065 --> 01:36:02.648]  I remember talking about seismic weapons, weather warfare, Alex, nine years ago.
[01:36:02.988 --> 01:36:08.992]  Everybody said I was crazy until I pointed out the 1972 and 76 Treaty of the UN.
[01:36:09.132 --> 01:36:15.096]  And you know, you and I have heard Brent Scowcroft and others make statements by consent or by conquest.
[01:36:15.444 --> 01:36:16.665]  There will be a new world order.
[01:36:17.025 --> 01:36:33.299]  You've done a marvelous job of detailing the intricacies, and now we're faced with a manipulated world war, and we need a manipulated world war so that the guy that comes on the scene will be heralded as the Christ, the Messiah.
[01:36:33.359 --> 01:36:44.248]  Not Jesus Christ, not Jesus of Nazareth, but they need this because they need to have an Armageddon, and they've designed an Armageddon to basically thrust us into what I would call the rule and reign of Antichrist.
[01:36:45.359 --> 01:36:51.241]  Well, Steve, I think the passion you have is that you hate seeing people get conned.
[01:36:51.901 --> 01:37:00.264]  There's nothing more painful than seeing someone buying a fraud, and then when you try to warn them, they laugh at you about it.
[01:37:00.304 --> 01:37:13.748]  But when you talk about bioweapons, and you talk about Ubermen and Superman, we were talking about chimeras five, six, seven, eight years ago, these cross-species abominations,
[01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:39.082]  And then now they just come out on the news and go, oh yeah, there's hundreds of human-animal cross-species already created, and we're going to accelerate all of this, and we're planting live pharmacological crops with live AIDS virus in them in 96 locations in America, and they're just wildly racing ahead with this.
[01:37:41.013 --> 01:37:47.614]  36 level 4 bioweapons labs being built all over the country for offensive and defensive systems.
[01:37:47.694 --> 01:37:57.556]  Dick Cheney in the 2000 September Rebuilding America's Defense's PNAG document says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[01:37:58.916 --> 01:38:09.398]  All of this is happening and then meanwhile you see the global elite arming all of these, quote, rogue nations, the Pakistan's, the North Korea's, the Iran's,
[01:38:10.466 --> 01:38:12.207]  Escalating this New World Order.
[01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:18.209]  And it just makes my head spin to see how we're being set up for destruction.
[01:38:18.989 --> 01:38:23.910]  And how this death cult that is the New World Order is having their way with us.
[01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:26.351]  I wanted to bring up a few news items and then get the calls.
[01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:37.341]  Of course you know about the Carlisle Group now is sending dozens and dozens of combat robots to Iraq.
[01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:42.543]  They say that by 2010 half the Air Force is going to be drone operated, remote control.
[01:38:43.163 --> 01:38:44.424]  I see the problem with this
[01:38:45.064 --> 01:38:50.290]  is that the globalists, this allows them to not even have humans who would disobey orders.
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:39:08.848]  Everything is going to shift to this command and control system where a tiny technocracy will have their own mechanized armies and everything is having chips and tracker systems embedded in it from our homes to our cars to our businesses to our water systems to our power grids for a tiny elite
[01:39:09.697 --> 01:39:21.025]  can now get past the compartmentalization of their own people not following orders, where they can really pull off grand control, grand destruction, and then blame it on somebody else.
[01:39:21.519 --> 01:39:22.519]  Well, absolutely.
[01:39:22.859 --> 01:39:32.483]  And the thing that, you know, the consciousness killing, that's the super soldier that is a top secret Pentagon plan right now.
[01:39:32.543 --> 01:39:34.983]  You remember Universal Soldier with Van Damme?
[01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:36.244]  There actually is one of those.
[01:39:36.264 --> 01:39:42.726]  I think, Alex, the hardest thing I have to try and communicate is that technology is at least 50 years ahead.
[01:39:43.166 --> 01:39:46.347]  When we're hearing about Dolly being cloned, I've had grown men
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:51.904]  Who had stopped by my office in Bozeman, Montana, crying from the defense establishment.
[01:39:51.984 --> 01:39:52.685]  I've never met them.
[01:39:52.705 --> 01:39:53.345]  I don't know them.
[01:39:53.585 --> 01:39:55.447]  I mean, they won't tell me their names, obviously.
[01:39:55.747 --> 01:39:59.770]  But they said, you need to tell the people the horror of the future.
[01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:06.796]  And what they're talking about is, you know, chimeras that would make Dr. Moreau's island look like, you know, a bunch of G.I.
[01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:07.576]  Joe people.
[01:40:07.816 --> 01:40:12.300]  I mean, seriously, we're talking about a group of sinisterly wicked,
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:19.650]  Supernaturally empowered and financed individuals that are attacking the very creation of God.
[01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:22.574]  Look, in the beginning God created man and woman.
[01:40:22.995 --> 01:40:28.122]  The problem now is that these entities that have been infused from the power of hell itself
[01:40:28.613 --> 01:40:31.956]  are going to destroy the last vestiges of humanity.
[01:40:32.017 --> 01:40:33.378]  And look, Jesus said it.
[01:40:33.438 --> 01:40:36.101]  If the days weren't short, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:43.248]  Yeah, they're chewing directly into the genetic code of the global biosphere and the human genome.
[01:40:43.648 --> 01:40:45.510]  They are systematically wrecking it.
[01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:46.671]  And look, now they admit it.
[01:40:47.172 --> 01:40:52.517]  I remember seven, eight years ago, they said, oh, two years ago, we cloned embryos in England.
[01:40:53.044 --> 01:40:56.125]  Then I found public documents where they were cloning embryos in the 60s.
[01:40:56.446 --> 01:40:59.267]  And as you said, now they're revealing more and more.
[01:40:59.307 --> 01:41:02.528]  And oh, we've got chimpanzee-human mixes in Argentina.
[01:41:02.949 --> 01:41:10.012]  And oh, we've got, you know, not just spider goats, but goat humans and spider humans.
[01:41:10.612 --> 01:41:14.075]  And oh, most of the varieties of tomatoes have cockroach in them.
[01:41:14.475 --> 01:41:19.038]  And just all this wild, pell-mell, not worrying about what it does.
[01:41:19.418 --> 01:41:29.145]  I mean, I had a top scientist on two weeks ago and he said, oh Alex, yeah, sure, all these cross-species meshes, yeah, this could give rise to super viruses and bacteria.
[01:41:29.486 --> 01:41:31.047]  But no one is stopping it.
[01:41:31.107 --> 01:41:33.889]  It's just a death wish.
[01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:35.350]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:38.012]  And you know, this is something, Alex, that I tell people.
[01:41:38.032 --> 01:41:38.432]  I say, look,
[01:41:38.934 --> 01:41:54.974]  Everything that we've ever told you, everything that we've ever formulated for you to understand, meaning you, meaning all of the radio listening audience, those who see your videos and hear me and read my books, is to show you that we're not where they were headed.
[01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:55.975]  We are at
[01:41:56.635 --> 01:42:03.020]  Yeah, there's a reason they're so arrogant, flaunting all of this in our face now.
[01:42:26.455 --> 01:42:29.358]  And, you know, this is something that people don't understand.
[01:42:29.458 --> 01:42:37.204]  This wasn't just, quote, some guy taking an illustrative license because he just graduated from prehistoric cave art school.
[01:42:37.544 --> 01:42:39.526]  These entities have been here before.
[01:42:39.626 --> 01:42:45.610]  And Jesus said, just as in the days of Noah, so would it be in the time of the coming of the Son of Man, which we're in right now.
[01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:52.656]  So these people out there, and I use the word people as, you know, they're a discredit to their own creation.
[01:42:52.984 --> 01:43:07.393]  But they're literally doing everything they can to find the ancient sites to reanimate, Alex, the genetic DNA from these entities that God judged and in many cases sealed in the depths of the earth.
[01:43:07.453 --> 01:43:09.854]  And now you've got people going out trying to release all this stuff.
[01:43:09.874 --> 01:43:14.056]  And I'm talking the Russians are doing it, the Chinese are doing it, the Brazilians are doing it.
[01:43:14.077 --> 01:43:15.317]  I mean, I've got to tell you something.
[01:43:15.697 --> 01:43:21.521]  No one would have ever thought that the fascination with fallen angels and all this stuff
[01:43:21.861 --> 01:43:25.702]  ...would be taken into a whole new dimension because they all want the DNA.
[01:43:25.742 --> 01:43:34.384]  And see, the thing is, is you and I can't exist because they want this new hyper-sexual, super-sexual, eternal being.
[01:43:34.424 --> 01:43:44.526]  And they have actually found the Methuselah gene, which the Methuselah gene is the thing that the great patriots in the Old Testament, like Methuselah, literally lived to be 969 years old.
[01:43:44.546 --> 01:43:45.127]  Now they're going to
[01:43:46.954 --> 01:44:02.371]  Promise a person, excuse me, they're going to promise a person eternal life, eternal sex, no ever having to face judgment because if you don't die obviously you can't go to hell, and the rubbing out, this is what people have got to understand, the rubbing out
[01:44:02.791 --> 01:44:05.073]  Alright, let me go over some news here.
[01:44:28.164 --> 01:44:44.635]  And by the way, when you read what Bill Joy is saying, when you read The Age of Spiritual Machines, when you read these top globalist, you know, billionaires, they're saying the elite wants the life extension technology for themselves, they don't want to give it to the general public, that's why they want this mass culling.
[01:44:45.115 --> 01:44:53.461]  And the God of this world, this is what they say, has told them that before they can have all this, they've got to destroy 80-95% of us.
[01:44:53.902 --> 01:44:55.243]  And so that's the grand illusion.
[01:44:55.283 --> 01:44:58.705]  So regardless if you believe this or not, folks, this is what the elite believes.
[01:44:58.765 --> 01:45:02.488]  Now, let me cover this article out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:45:03.129 --> 01:45:05.270]  Armed robo-soldiers set for Iraq.
[01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:08.553]  The rain is turning to snow on a blistering January morning.
[01:45:08.753 --> 01:45:14.357]  And all the men gathered in a parking lot here surely would prefer to be inside.
[01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:23.973]  But the weather couldn't matter less than the robotic sharpshooter they are here to watch as it splashes through puddles, the barrel of its machine gun pointing that way.
[01:45:24.493 --> 01:45:30.976]  The Army is preparing to send 18 of these remote-controlled robotic warriors to fight in Iraq beginning in March or April.
[01:45:32.196 --> 01:45:41.881]  And then it talks about how it's made by a company owned by the Carlisle Group and the armored robots are called Swords.
[01:45:43.095 --> 01:45:45.956]  And again, people, they're telling you about Swords now.
[01:45:46.717 --> 01:45:58.022]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, made three years ago, I show Swords in Central Texas, operating in downtown Belton.
[01:45:58.382 --> 01:45:59.643]  They have a, quote, drill.
[01:45:59.723 --> 01:46:04.225]  The police, with the special forces troops, blow up cars in downtown.
[01:46:04.921 --> 01:46:14.485]  There's children in the drill with fake blood on them, and now they have drills where homeschoolers are attacking, and we've got, again, traumatizing the children that all homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:46:14.745 --> 01:46:17.946]  You talk about re-education camps or brainwashing, this is it.
[01:46:18.566 --> 01:46:22.688]  And here are the swords with their guns rolling around.
[01:46:24.369 --> 01:46:25.929]  Again, we mentioned robots.
[01:46:26.429 --> 01:46:27.530]  Sounds like science fiction.
[01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:28.050]  It's 2005, people!
[01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.210]  Steve?
[01:46:30.971 --> 01:46:37.214]  Well, let me give you one better than that, because what you're talking about, I would call that first-level robotics.
[01:46:37.254 --> 01:46:41.636]  Let me take you to tenth-level robotics, and this is in the Guardian today, Alex, okay?
[01:46:42.096 --> 01:46:51.321]  Scientists have made them walk and talk, there are even robots that can run, but a South Korean professor is poised to take their developmental steps further and give cybersex a new meaning.
[01:46:51.801 --> 01:47:03.391]  Kim Jong Won, the director of the ITRC Intelligent Robot Research Center, has developed a series of artificial chromosomes that he says will allow robots to feel lusty and could eventually lead to them reproducing.
[01:47:03.771 --> 01:47:10.597]  He says the software which will be installed in a robot within the next three months will give the machines the ability to feel reason and desire.
[01:47:10.697 --> 01:47:13.259]  I'm already told by guys in that world they already exist.
[01:47:13.635 --> 01:47:14.315]  Now listen to this.
[01:47:14.555 --> 01:47:23.640]  Kim, a leading authority on technology and ethics of robotics said, quote, Christians may not like it, but we must consider this the origin of an artificial species.
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:27.922]  Until now, most researchers in this field have focused only on the functionality of the machine.
[01:47:28.302 --> 01:47:31.063]  But we think in terms of essence of the creatures.
[01:47:31.463 --> 01:47:37.846]  That essence is a computer code which determines a robot's propensity to feel happy, sad, angry, sleepy, hungry, or afraid.
[01:47:38.127 --> 01:47:40.948]  Kim says this software is modeled on human DNA,
[01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:46.646]  Though equivalent to a single strand of genetic code rather than the complex double helix of a real chromosome.
[01:47:46.666 --> 01:47:47.888]  Now let me stop right there.
[01:47:47.908 --> 01:47:53.914]  The point is, is that they are trying to give the machines free will.
[01:47:54.014 --> 01:47:56.757]  Anything you're hearing about is at least 20 years old.
[01:47:57.958 --> 01:48:04.245]  And they're now calling biotech, they're claiming that this is really robotic.
[01:48:05.767 --> 01:48:14.451]  And the new big field, of course, is this merger of biotech and robotics, and they're saying, oh, the new creature is going to be a cyborg.
[01:48:14.932 --> 01:48:20.654]  That's why they want all these clone parts, so they can create these abominations and then claim it's a new life form.
[01:48:21.234 --> 01:48:28.838]  Absolutely, Alex, and when you were quoting Bill Joy, why the future doesn't need us anymore, I think everybody that's listening to your broadcast must
[01:48:29.611 --> 01:48:30.551]  Read that essay.
[01:48:30.952 --> 01:48:33.813]  Or Ray Kurzweil's, uh, Spiritual Machines.
[01:48:33.853 --> 01:48:44.277]  Because, see, ultimately, let me share with people one thing that no one has said that I know, and this is what I draw in my book, Genetic Armageddon, which I believe is the scariest book ever written, okay?
[01:48:44.737 --> 01:48:50.059]  That these entities, these, uh, cyborgs, will then become demon-possessed.
[01:48:50.419 --> 01:48:56.322]  Just like when Jesus cast the demons out of the gathering demoniac and they besought him to go into the pig.
[01:48:56.402 --> 01:48:56.863]  Guess what?
[01:48:57.143 --> 01:49:06.128]  There are a lot of disembodied spirits that will become embodied and when you get the willing dupes of Satan,
[01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:06.727]  Well,
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.061]  Again, the elite believe in the devil, folks.
[01:49:34.081 --> 01:49:36.622]  And this is what they believe they're bringing forward.
[01:49:36.702 --> 01:49:39.424]  It sounds crazy, but it's what they believe.
[01:49:39.484 --> 01:49:40.865]  It's what they're pushing for.
[01:49:40.905 --> 01:49:44.186]  They're completely psychopathic and totally delusional.
[01:49:44.326 --> 01:49:45.087]  And we'll be back.
[01:49:45.107 --> 01:49:46.307]  We've got a lot of your phone calls.
[01:49:46.327 --> 01:49:47.028]  We'll get to you.
[01:49:47.568 --> 01:49:49.349]  Have Steve Krell with us into the next hour.
[01:49:49.389 --> 01:49:50.369]  A bunch of other news.
[01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:51.350]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.658 --> 01:49:57.980]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.622]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:07.124]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.164 --> 01:50:08.545]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:14.552]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.592 --> 01:50:21.541]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.661 --> 01:50:23.784]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.004 --> 01:50:25.045]  Homeland Security.
[01:50:25.226 --> 01:50:26.027]  Executive orders.
[01:50:26.207 --> 01:50:27.068]  Force vaccinations.
[01:50:27.168 --> 01:50:27.628]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.792 --> 01:50:56.774]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.134 --> 01:51:05.958]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.279 --> 01:51:10.961]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.421 --> 01:51:18.144]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.544 --> 01:51:30.349]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:35.273]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:53.919 --> 01:53:04.546]  Alright, Linda and Ken and Howard and Ian and Lenny and everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:05.807 --> 01:53:11.891]  I want to make it clear, you know, I focus on the real things I can prove, on the things that are demonstrated to admit it.
[01:53:12.805 --> 01:53:14.907]  And the elite are saying they're God now.
[01:53:15.427 --> 01:53:17.749]  They are saying that, quote, it's totally normal.
[01:53:17.769 --> 01:53:19.850]  We're going to take control of human, quote, evolution.
[01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:22.733]  We're going to merge you forcibly with the machines by 2025.
[01:53:23.013 --> 01:53:26.235]  That's the Pentagon's own document from 2000.
[01:53:28.437 --> 01:53:29.918]  They really believe all of this.
[01:53:30.759 --> 01:53:38.124]  Now again, I don't know if the full extent of what they're saying, if it's feasible, or how advanced it is, but they're saying it.
[01:53:38.224 --> 01:53:38.845]  They're doing it.
[01:53:39.525 --> 01:53:43.526]  They're completely out of control, and Steve covers that and documents it.
[01:53:45.207 --> 01:53:46.327]  Linda's been holding forever.
[01:53:46.347 --> 01:53:49.228]  She wanted to give us some legislative update about a bill.
[01:53:49.948 --> 01:53:51.509]  Linda in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:52.009]  Go ahead.
[01:53:52.449 --> 01:53:53.249]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:53:53.269 --> 01:53:59.151]  You just told me the secrecy and the agenda against our bodies is going on.
[01:54:00.651 --> 01:54:01.572]  This is Senate Bill 3, F3?
[01:54:01.632 --> 01:54:01.952]  Uh-huh.
[01:54:02.952 --> 01:54:03.192]  Okay.
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:22.343]  It gives, it's a long bill, over a hundred pages, and it gives the drug companies that produce pills, vaccines, etc., kits and plants, what have you, coal, car flash, no liability.
[01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:32.124]  Well yeah, they already passed that a few years ago and then it got repealed to give them vaccine liability immunity.
[01:54:32.384 --> 01:54:34.045]  Thanks for the call, no pun intended.
[01:54:34.585 --> 01:54:35.405]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:35.445 --> 01:54:36.165]  Steve comments.
[01:54:36.795 --> 01:54:51.056]  Well, I think that what the scariest thing is, again, you know, one of the key signs of mystery Babylon that God judges it for, and I believe the United States is spiritual Babylon, is the fact that we wouldn't repent of our sorcery.
[01:54:51.097 --> 01:54:52.599]  And that word is pharmakia.
[01:54:53.106 --> 01:55:00.553]  You know, it's interesting, Alex, because when you look at, and people say, well, why do you do the stuff you do on ancient stuff?
[01:55:00.573 --> 01:55:05.138]  Because everything that's been done in the ancient times, there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:09.262]  And as Solomon, the wisest guy, said, that which has been will be again.
[01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:13.306]  The pharmaceutical companies are absolutely a key.
[01:55:16.148 --> 01:55:26.875]  Well, I mean, we've caught Big Pharma putting cancer viruses in the vaccines on purpose.
[01:55:27.215 --> 01:55:36.041]  We've got Henry Kissinger's documents from 73 declassified in 92 ordering the third world to forcibly sterilize half their women or no IMF or World Bank money.
[01:55:36.101 --> 01:55:38.383]  I mean, that's how controlling they are.
[01:55:38.423 --> 01:55:42.825]  We've got Prince Philip saying he wants to come back as a particularly deadly virus to kill 80% of us.
[01:55:44.387 --> 01:55:44.988]  Absolutely.
[01:55:45.328 --> 01:55:46.490]  And let me share this, Alex.
[01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:50.955]  When I broke the news, and again, look, when I say this, I want to share this for people.
[01:55:51.416 --> 01:55:52.257]  I'm on record.
[01:55:52.377 --> 01:55:56.202]  Everything I've said, just like everything you've said, is a matter of record, okay?
[01:55:56.422 --> 01:56:02.490]  So when I say ten years ago, I was warning about these points and saying, this is what it will mean
[01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:04.331]  That is true.
[01:56:04.351 --> 01:56:06.792]  That is what, you know, is going on.
[01:56:06.892 --> 01:56:10.534]  And again, when I talked about mousepox, now let me share this with you.
[01:56:10.554 --> 01:56:22.801]  In the last three days, as you know, four days, when the National Geographic article came out about putting human brain cells into mice, I jokingly said, great, you can shoot at them and they can laugh at you and say, you missed me.
[01:56:23.081 --> 01:56:26.443]  But what people don't understand is the ultimate doomsday weapon
[01:56:27.037 --> 01:56:28.118]  It does exist.
[01:56:28.198 --> 01:56:29.659]  It's a form of mouse pox.
[01:56:29.699 --> 01:56:30.360]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:42.989]  Two years ago, the Australian government released the recipe to make a 98% fatal super bio-weapon, super super bio-weapon, and it can be done with any mammal.
[01:56:43.309 --> 01:56:46.372]  And when we start the next hour, we'll talk about mouse pox, then we'll go to
[01:56:46.972 --> 01:56:50.113]  Ken and Howard and Ian and everybody else is patiently holding.
[01:56:50.413 --> 01:56:56.656]  My website is Infowars.com and of course PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for all my films and books and materials.
[01:56:57.056 --> 01:56:59.317]  And Steve, your website for folks that want to check it out.
[01:56:59.657 --> 01:57:02.218]  It is www.stevequayle.com
[01:57:05.939 --> 01:57:10.023]  And Alex, they can order all my books on my website and they can read the first chapter.
[01:57:10.323 --> 01:57:20.191]  And I challenge everybody that's sitting there listening to us to go who's on the internet and read the first chapter of Genetic Armageddon because this is the stuff that I'm pulling out of nowhere.
[01:57:20.251 --> 01:57:22.974]  This is the guys who are the most respective in their field.
[01:57:23.174 --> 01:57:24.355]  They're saying, look, we're gonna do it.
[01:57:24.375 --> 01:57:25.896]  We're gonna do it right in front of your faces.
[01:57:27.437 --> 01:57:28.478]  They're out of control.
[01:57:28.498 --> 01:57:30.240]  They think they're God.
[01:57:31.309 --> 01:57:32.752]  And I say they've gone quite mad.
[01:57:33.293 --> 01:57:37.301]  We'll be right back with a third hour, your calls, a ton of news and information.
[01:57:37.321 --> 01:57:40.487]  I want to throw some of the topical news stories out.
[01:57:40.687 --> 01:57:41.629]  Steve, get his take on it.
[01:57:50.013 --> 01:57:50.654]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.314 --> 01:57:52.354]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.074 --> 01:57:54.195]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.855 --> 01:57:55.655]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.416 --> 01:57:57.316]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.976 --> 01:58:01.917]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.157 --> 01:58:06.239]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:14.681]  All right, we're now into the third and final hour of this Friday edition.
[01:58:15.122 --> 01:58:16.262]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:16.282 --> 01:58:18.263]  We've got Steve Quayle riding a shotgun with us.
[01:58:18.763 --> 01:58:19.723]  Your call's coming up.
[01:58:19.743 --> 01:58:21.043]  A lot of calls in this hour.
[01:58:21.063 --> 01:58:32.407]  And I want to get into other stories with Steve, like the one out of Reuters where the 25-year-old computer programmer engineer graduate loses her job.
[01:58:32.847 --> 01:58:33.947]  She goes for unemployment.
[01:58:34.948 --> 01:58:35.488]  And they say,
[01:58:36.232 --> 01:58:42.201]  If you don't take a job as a prostitute, which is now legal in Germany, we're going to take you off your unemployment.
[01:58:44.304 --> 01:58:48.771]  So many facets to that story alone to give you an idea of where this world's going.
[01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:53.072]  We'll be discussing that and just a dozen other important issues.
[01:58:54.453 --> 01:58:55.733]  We're about to go to your calls.
[01:58:55.773 --> 01:59:03.777]  In fact, Steve, I want to ask you to hold off on the mouse pox because I want to get into mouse pox and what it is and why it's so serious after we take some calls.
[01:59:04.518 --> 01:59:06.879]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in New York.
[01:59:06.919 --> 01:59:08.220]  Ken, you're on the air.
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:08.620]  Welcome.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.041]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:59:10.621 --> 01:59:15.884]  Steve, you talked about on your show one night this week that Vice President Cheney
[01:59:17.231 --> 01:59:32.578]  said that they can't be responsible if Israel attacks Iran and I heard Tantliza Rice a couple of hours ago on the CNN radio report and she said that her master Lord Bush has not ruled out military action against Iran.
[01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:39.561]  So it seems like Iran is in their cortez and Russia has a defense treaty with Iran
[01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:44.154]  Do you think that this might be the beginning of some Asia Armageddon?
[01:59:44.254 --> 01:59:56.166]  And I would add the addendum or caveat to that, that our government and others have been caught arming Iran, so they give them the weapon and then meanwhile Pakistan's giving nukes to North Korea and others, but that's okay.
[01:59:56.726 --> 01:59:59.009]  And that's a teetering regime.
[01:59:59.609 --> 01:59:59.930]  Steve?
[02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:03.111]  Well, I think that the caller is bringing out a good point now.
[02:00:03.511 --> 02:00:18.537]  One of the strangest things that people have got to understand is there are reports coming out of Russia as of yesterday that a lot of the Russian high command has been flown out of Moscow and the surrounding cities and flown to their doomsday bunkers in the Ural.
[02:00:18.557 --> 02:00:22.438]  Now, that's coming from a Russian source, Alex, and so it's not just gossip.
[02:00:22.818 --> 02:00:27.980]  I think given the fact that the double talk in Iran, I mean, on Drudge they're talking about Iran,
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.081]  Condoleezza Rice is saying there are diplomatic ways to take on Iran.
[02:00:32.101 --> 02:00:33.181]  Let me share this with you.
[02:00:33.201 --> 02:00:37.882]  This is, in my opinion, the start of World War III, and I don't believe anything they say.
[02:00:38.222 --> 02:00:40.763]  They're arming Russia, will come to the aid of Iran.
[02:00:41.143 --> 02:00:43.263]  China's already encircled the United States.
[02:00:44.463 --> 02:00:46.764]  One of their prime ministers has been going through the Caribbean.
[02:00:46.784 --> 02:00:53.805]  So, I can say this, that when it starts, this is what I tell people, I don't care what they think of Israel, I don't care what they think of anything.
[02:00:53.905 --> 02:00:56.666]  What they've got to understand is when the shooting starts with Iran,
[02:00:57.467 --> 02:00:58.934]  I mean, it's World War III time!
[02:01:00.194 --> 02:01:01.654]  And Russia will come to the aid.
[02:01:01.674 --> 02:01:08.416]  Listen, Russia has determined in their weapons proliferation and all their weapons plans.
[02:01:08.476 --> 02:01:18.999]  Look, Alex, you and I were talking about this whole thing that was set up in the Middle East when the Russians were in there pulling out their advisors and pulling out all their secret files and everything out of the Iraqi intelligence.
[02:01:19.019 --> 02:01:20.340]  I mean, this whole thing is set up.
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:28.842]  It's set up by the New World Order, the Illuminists, to basically destroy the Phoenix and then bring up the resurrected Phoenix out of the ashes.
[02:01:29.142 --> 02:01:29.982]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:01:30.223 --> 02:01:31.203]  You put it all together.
[02:01:31.463 --> 02:01:32.724]  And I gotta tell you something.
[02:01:32.744 --> 02:01:37.866]  I think, Alex, it's not chance that you and I have been doing so many shows together.
[02:01:37.926 --> 02:01:42.168]  And thank you so much for coming on my show and allowing me the ability to come on your show.
[02:01:42.448 --> 02:01:46.530]  But it's because it's like God wants to give people, I believe, a double dose of reality.
[02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:49.011]  Because maybe a single dose isn't getting it done.
[02:01:50.188 --> 02:01:52.689]  Well, I appreciate those kind words.
[02:01:52.749 --> 02:01:54.230]  Anything else quickly, Ken?
[02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:57.951]  So, Steve, you really think Russia will confront the U.S.
[02:01:57.991 --> 02:01:59.752]  directly if an attack on Atlanta occurs?
[02:02:00.132 --> 02:02:00.872]  Absolutely.
[02:02:00.932 --> 02:02:04.914]  I can tell you point-blank they're going to do it, and they're going to do it on multi-fronts.
[02:02:05.274 --> 02:02:14.238]  And the deal is, is they will use the cover of a lot of the natural disasters, which I believe are being attenuated, so, you know, as the
[02:02:14.918 --> 02:02:22.120]  Volcanoes on the coast start to go off, meaning the north coast of California, the big earthquake's coming that, you know, I'm talking about.
[02:02:22.461 --> 02:02:23.421]  I think that's the time.
[02:02:23.521 --> 02:02:25.041]  I see this as very, very close.
[02:02:25.222 --> 02:02:25.742]  Thanks, guys.
[02:02:26.202 --> 02:02:27.282]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:02:27.882 --> 02:02:31.404]  And Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 said they've got these seismic weapons.
[02:02:32.124 --> 02:02:34.305]  I mean, it's hard to believe, but they say they've got them.
[02:02:34.845 --> 02:02:41.367]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, get into a whole area of information we haven't covered yet.
[02:02:45.436 --> 02:02:46.957]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.157 --> 02:02:50.238]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.358 --> 02:02:54.280]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.561]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.902 --> 02:03:02.663]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.743 --> 02:03:04.604]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.824 --> 02:03:08.107]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:12.872]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.032 --> 02:03:16.075]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:19.118]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.598 --> 02:03:25.724]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.244 --> 02:03:30.047]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:03:44.697 --> 02:03:47.958]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.018 --> 02:03:52.220]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:55.241]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.421 --> 02:03:57.822]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.022 --> 02:04:06.666]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:06.866 --> 02:04:08.206]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:08.386 --> 02:04:12.568]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:12.608 --> 02:04:13.329]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.568 --> 02:04:43.277]  Yep, I am.
[02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:51.339]  Hi, this is Tasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the peps back in your step.
[02:04:51.539 --> 02:04:56.521]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:04:56.741 --> 02:05:10.005]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:05:10.245 --> 02:05:13.486]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[02:05:13.766 --> 02:05:16.108]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:20.151]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[02:05:20.352 --> 02:05:23.414]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[02:05:23.654 --> 02:05:27.157]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[02:05:27.438 --> 02:05:31.521]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[02:05:31.821 --> 02:05:34.043]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[02:05:34.223 --> 02:05:37.586]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[02:05:37.846 --> 02:05:41.810]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[02:05:45.673 --> 02:05:51.316]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:03.583 --> 02:06:07.025]  Please stay
[02:06:15.143 --> 02:06:37.258]  Steve, a few weeks ago I was on your program and we were reading an AP article out of California where they paid thousands of dollars to have a career specialist come to the middle school and teach them how to be psychics to make money and to teach them how to be topless bar dancers and
[02:06:38.012 --> 02:06:39.113]  Basically prostitutes.
[02:06:39.513 --> 02:06:41.115]  That's what a lot of those women do on the side.
[02:06:41.815 --> 02:06:45.338]  And then when the school got caught doing it, the whole school district, they didn't apologize.
[02:06:45.359 --> 02:06:47.020]  They said, yeah, we're doing this.
[02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:47.821]  It's a good job.
[02:06:48.741 --> 02:07:02.914]  Well, now in Germany, if you're a computer programmer, an automaker, you know, whatever, auto factory worker, you lose your job and you go into the unemployment office, you say, I'll take any job.
[02:07:04.376 --> 02:07:11.201]  They come back and say, well, you've got to take a job as a prostitute, having sex with ten men a day, or you don't get any welfare.
[02:07:11.762 --> 02:07:13.042]  You don't get any unemployment.
[02:07:13.443 --> 02:07:15.064]  We're going to take you off your unemployment.
[02:07:16.625 --> 02:07:18.907]  And that's similar, you know, to our workers' compensation.
[02:07:18.927 --> 02:07:22.249]  But now, they're saying, well, there is no morals.
[02:07:22.769 --> 02:07:27.133]  And so, because there is no morals, we dictate you've got to go have sex with ten men a day.
[02:07:27.153 --> 02:07:29.334]  I mean, that was in the mainstream news.
[02:07:29.374 --> 02:07:30.275]  Like, it's normal.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:47.553]  And that's where, that's where all of this goes, where people that go protest in Philadelphia in a designated protest zone, praying, are going to get 47 years in prison, and at the same time, women are told, you've got to go be a prostitute, and that's feminism!
[02:07:48.413 --> 02:07:49.294]  That's the new freedom.
[02:07:49.354 --> 02:07:55.639]  I mean, when it's totally unnatural, when it's very destructive to women, where they could catch a disease that could kill them,
[02:07:56.576 --> 02:08:02.338]  I mean, just imagine the military's going to these bathrooms where the men and women are in the same bathrooms.
[02:08:02.618 --> 02:08:07.700]  They're making us do all these unnatural, destructive things.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.660]  Talk about social engineering.
[02:08:10.301 --> 02:08:11.421]  It's getting to be amazing.
[02:08:12.228 --> 02:08:14.209]  So it's the ultimate affront on God.
[02:08:14.249 --> 02:08:27.957]  See, here's what it ultimately boils down to, is that with what we're seeing in the United States, what you're reporting in Germany, the bottom line is the state is saying, we own you, and if you're going to take our benefits, you're going to basically sing the song we want you to sing.
[02:08:28.657 --> 02:08:35.141]  And they can engineer the economy however they want, where people are going to have to, quote, go into these service jobs.
[02:08:35.481 --> 02:08:41.084]  And for most young women today, good-looking ones, they'll tell you, you know, that the job opportunity is a topless dancer.
[02:08:41.305 --> 02:08:43.066]  Well, next is you've got to be a whore!
[02:08:43.466 --> 02:08:47.448]  Well, absolutely, and if that's applied to women, what do they do with men?
[02:08:47.548 --> 02:08:49.029]  Turn them into, you know, what?
[02:08:49.049 --> 02:08:50.190]  Chip and Dale dancers?
[02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:53.311]  You know, Alex, there is no end to this, and that's something.
[02:08:53.772 --> 02:08:57.534]  The Apostle Paul talked about men who are inventors of evil things.
[02:08:58.012 --> 02:09:07.042]  And this is the thing, just when you think you've become astonished enough, that nothing would surprise you, there's a whole new level of astonishment.
[02:09:07.402 --> 02:09:14.530]  And this is official, the German government taxes it and regulates it, and basically they've become the pimp, forcing women into prostitution.
[02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:19.135]  We're talking college degreed, she's actually a software engineer, real good looking,
[02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:20.441]  And they told her.
[02:09:20.702 --> 02:09:21.682]  They said, you're good looking.
[02:09:21.882 --> 02:09:23.343]  She said, look, I'll take a job as a wafer.
[02:09:23.383 --> 02:09:24.904]  I'll take a job doing anything.
[02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:27.025]  I'll take a job, you know, cleaning stuff up at the park.
[02:09:27.386 --> 02:09:28.026]  They said, no.
[02:09:28.566 --> 02:09:30.187]  They said, our database has been hit.
[02:09:30.407 --> 02:09:32.289]  People look at their photo, everything on the government database.
[02:09:32.649 --> 02:09:34.650]  And this local pimp wants you for his brothel.
[02:09:35.190 --> 02:09:37.592]  And we're taking you off your unemployment right now.
[02:09:38.713 --> 02:09:42.460]  You've got to take the job as a prostitute, and you've got to serve ten men a day.
[02:09:42.961 --> 02:09:47.228]  Well, and what's different than that from the Nazi regime when Hitler would do the same thing?
[02:09:47.549 --> 02:09:49.492]  He'd take the young, good-looking girls, wouldn't he?
[02:09:49.533 --> 02:09:51.316]  He'd mix them up with the young, good-looking men.
[02:09:51.741 --> 02:10:01.811]  To produce the new race, and obviously so many of the young German maidens were basically put into servicing the different military officials.
[02:10:01.831 --> 02:10:09.298]  See, what it is, and you called it right, what happens, it's one thing when an individual's a pimp, it's another thing when the whole country becomes a pimp.
[02:10:09.919 --> 02:10:13.022]  And this is exactly the spirit of the age.
[02:10:14.246 --> 02:10:27.235]  The whoredom that's out there, when I say whoredom, it's going to become so bad that Alex, there was a story I'm sure you saw the other day, where now they're trying to get little 10 to 12 year olds to dress like whores.
[02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:30.872]  I mean, you know, this is such a sad, sad thing.
[02:10:30.912 --> 02:10:32.733]  Well, yeah, that's the style.
[02:10:32.914 --> 02:10:40.819]  And I've read articles, mainstream news, where the big industries say, we're targeting, we're trying to sexualize your 9 and 10 and 11 year olds.
[02:10:41.219 --> 02:10:42.040]  Absolutely.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:45.802]  Again, again, that obsession with destroying innocence.
[02:10:46.623 --> 02:10:49.085]  Well, and see, that's the thing the devil hates.
[02:10:49.125 --> 02:10:54.669]  That's why children are sacrificed in the womb and are being sacrificed outside the womb.
[02:10:54.929 --> 02:10:56.070]  And this is something that you've
[02:10:56.934 --> 02:11:10.425]  You've, and I use this, you have pointed out continually over and over that people have got to understand that all the children that disappear, all of the rise in the dark, occultic sacrifices, they want the blood of innocence.
[02:11:10.445 --> 02:11:12.247]  You see, this is what we're seeing, folks.
[02:11:12.567 --> 02:11:20.654]  When you won't speak out about it, you know, ten years ago, now you're going to deal with it and God forbid that it's someone's grandson or granddaughter
[02:11:21.014 --> 02:11:26.656]  Or worse, son or daughter, they have sacrificed on the altar of the occult New World Order.
[02:11:26.736 --> 02:11:29.697]  And listen, Alex, these guys are bloodthirsty.
[02:11:29.937 --> 02:11:31.057]  They're not happy.
[02:11:31.297 --> 02:11:37.139]  Look, they're thrilled when, you know, multiple hundreds of thousands of people die.
[02:11:37.219 --> 02:11:47.042]  And behind the scenes, this is something that most people don't understand, World War III is being offered to Satan as the ultimate blood sacrifice.
[02:11:47.203 --> 02:11:48.463]  And people don't see it.
[02:11:49.369 --> 02:11:51.750]  Well, a lot of abortionists have gone public.
[02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:58.012]  I mean, imagine somebody who could sit there butchering eight-month-old babies all day long.
[02:11:58.292 --> 02:12:01.953]  Many of them will tell you, and it's been on record, that these are really sacrifices.
[02:12:02.473 --> 02:12:03.033]  Absolutely.
[02:12:03.213 --> 02:12:05.394]  There was a book written called The Sacrament of Abortion.
[02:12:05.914 --> 02:12:09.539]  And I'm paraphrasing now, but basically he said the Christians just don't get it.
[02:12:09.959 --> 02:12:14.505]  This is our sacrifice to our God of their children.
[02:12:14.865 --> 02:12:16.067]  And they were talking about Satan.
[02:12:16.087 --> 02:12:18.790]  And then what do our leaders worship when they go to the Bohemian Grove?
[02:12:18.850 --> 02:12:24.157]  They have re-inaugurated, brought back in, Moloch.
[02:12:24.717 --> 02:12:25.478]  Absolutely!
[02:12:25.898 --> 02:12:46.094]  And you did such a great job, and I mean that, of telling people, look, there's no... it doesn't take a time machine to jump from Moloch worship in the Old Testament and the sacrifice of children by the hands of the Philistines to the Bohemian Grove, and the illustration that they're getting across is it's coming back again, folks.
[02:12:46.374 --> 02:12:51.438]  So when, you know, we talk about, Alex, the prison camps, the termination camps, the execution centers,
[02:12:51.846 --> 02:12:53.448]  They don't just take the little kids.
[02:12:53.508 --> 02:12:56.891]  Oh, they'll use the one sexually they want to use, but then they kill them too.
[02:12:56.951 --> 02:12:58.312]  And this is why my heart breaks.
[02:12:58.372 --> 02:13:04.557]  Look, my heart breaks because of wanton denial, stupidity, apathy, and indifference.
[02:13:04.578 --> 02:13:05.658]  Not at the world.
[02:13:05.678 --> 02:13:11.043]  Hey, you've got guys that listen to you and I that know we're telling the truth that absolutely are not Christians.
[02:13:11.163 --> 02:13:15.868]  Meanwhile, the Christians are the ones that send me the email, oh, we're out of here, don't worry about it.
[02:13:15.908 --> 02:13:17.889]  And my answer is, what have you ever done to stop one
[02:13:19.050 --> 02:13:42.635]  I want to go to calls for Howard and Ian and everybody else that's patiently holding, but before we do that, just briefly, Schwarzenegger, the prototype Nietzsche beast man, all of his films, The Running Man, Predator, The Terminator, it's all this image
[02:13:43.445 --> 02:13:50.567]  And now they admit the Kennedy biographer's coming out with a book authorized by Arnold, his quote, secret plan to get into the White House, Bush Sr.
[02:13:50.607 --> 02:13:51.427]  saying, accept it.
[02:13:51.848 --> 02:13:57.309]  You know, they want him because of that figurehead image that he brings to the table.
[02:13:57.849 --> 02:13:59.330]  Your comments about Schwarzenegger?
[02:13:59.650 --> 02:14:06.612]  Well, first of all, to my knowledge, you and I were the only two guys when he was running for governor that stated, even before he was elected,
[02:14:07.116 --> 02:14:14.439]  That he was going to run for the president when he was seen with Barron Rothschild with Warren Buffett in the garden at Rothschild's private estate.
[02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:18.521]  I went on the record, Alex, and stated, they're not grooming him for the governorship.
[02:14:18.541 --> 02:14:20.242]  They're grooming him for the presidency.
[02:14:20.282 --> 02:14:22.923]  And I said, isn't it interesting that the man who played
[02:14:23.534 --> 02:14:28.420]  In the movie, the end of days and the Terminator, in my opinion, pay very well out there.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:31.224]  And the sixth day about life extension and cloning.
[02:14:31.524 --> 02:14:32.125]  Absolutely.
[02:14:32.445 --> 02:14:33.306]  And what was it?
[02:14:33.647 --> 02:14:38.152]  One of the movies, the science fiction movies, even said that Arnold Schwarzenegger had become president.
[02:14:38.252 --> 02:14:38.653]  What was it?
[02:14:38.733 --> 02:14:40.215]  The Running Man or something, you know?
[02:14:41.155 --> 02:14:43.776]  There was a movie, a science fiction... Demolition Man!
[02:14:43.796 --> 02:14:46.337]  Demolition, forgive me, I stand corrected.
[02:14:46.637 --> 02:14:47.317]  Demolition Man.
[02:14:47.337 --> 02:14:49.598]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is all planned.
[02:14:49.638 --> 02:15:02.022]  And when you read some of Arnold's writing, understanding who his father was, understanding all this stuff, look, the man is an amazing orator, as most people that watch the Republican convention would attest.
[02:15:02.382 --> 02:15:05.323]  But the point is, there is a sinister aspect
[02:15:05.683 --> 02:15:12.749]  Behind him, and again Alex, to my knowledge, you and I were the only two guys that claimed, and you know, people say, oh you're never right.
[02:15:12.809 --> 02:15:14.070]  They say that to me all the time.
[02:15:14.130 --> 02:15:17.212]  I said, oh yeah, well who else said it before it happened, you know?
[02:15:17.552 --> 02:15:22.016]  So the point that I'm trying to get across is that, look, he embodies
[02:15:22.276 --> 02:15:22.956]  Absolutely!
[02:15:23.376 --> 02:15:30.658]  And so, you know, the deal is that you really think it's going to be too tough when the devil comes along and you can have all the power you've ever
[02:15:43.303 --> 02:15:43.763]  Wanted?
[02:15:43.783 --> 02:15:47.365]  You could have everything you've ever... Well, people don't believe that they're going to do this.
[02:15:47.385 --> 02:15:48.786]  They're going to pull some scam.
[02:15:49.066 --> 02:15:51.247]  He's going to save people from a terrorist attack.
[02:15:51.647 --> 02:15:53.848]  You watch, and that's how this is going to go down.
[02:15:54.428 --> 02:15:55.949]  Let's take another call here.
[02:15:55.969 --> 02:15:56.649]  Who's up next?
[02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:59.811]  Howard, you're on the air.
[02:15:59.831 --> 02:16:00.791]  Where are you calling from?
[02:16:01.431 --> 02:16:02.432]  California.
[02:16:02.472 --> 02:16:02.812]  Welcome.
[02:16:02.852 --> 02:16:03.232]  Go ahead.
[02:16:03.993 --> 02:16:06.214]  I have a question for your guest.
[02:16:06.734 --> 02:16:11.436]  Do you think the rapture will actually take place before all this goes down, or do you think that's just a
[02:16:12.014 --> 02:16:16.637]  They try to sell that rapture as a myth of the Christians that it's not really going to happen.
[02:16:16.917 --> 02:16:20.159]  Well, first of all, I don't believe in a pre-tribulation rapture.
[02:16:20.219 --> 02:16:23.661]  I don't make it, you know, the point of fellowship with other Christians.
[02:16:23.721 --> 02:16:31.526]  But I believe, and you know, that's a multi-hour argument, I believe that... Regardless, we've got to stand up and fight evil.
[02:16:31.886 --> 02:16:32.727]  Absolutely.
[02:16:32.767 --> 02:16:34.368]  And I believe because
[02:16:39.751 --> 02:16:47.474]  Well, no matter how long we're here, Rapture or not, we still have to stand up against it.
[02:16:47.855 --> 02:16:49.796]  Absolutely!
[02:16:50.396 --> 02:16:58.920]  Listen to the whole time you're on, and this whole subject matter reminds me of a song lyric, and it goes, When they said repent, I wonder what they meant.
[02:17:00.181 --> 02:17:02.662]  And, you know, it's kind of like that ignorance
[02:17:03.921 --> 02:17:04.902]  Well, it's simple.
[02:17:05.002 --> 02:17:07.644]  God gave us rules to have a healthy, happy society.
[02:17:07.684 --> 02:17:11.508]  We're going in the opposite direction, and hell on earth is manifesting itself.
[02:17:12.029 --> 02:17:12.649]  Absolutely.
[02:17:12.789 --> 02:17:21.358]  And what your guest, the caller, is saying right now, Alex, is that the word repent doesn't have any meaning, because most Christians don't believe they need to repent of anything.
[02:17:22.808 --> 02:17:25.491]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:30.015]  We'll talk to Ian and everybody else when we get back, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:31.396 --> 02:17:41.465]  We'll get into genetically engineered super weapons, the stuff that's admitted out there that makes Ebola look like some nutritious butter spread.
[02:17:41.966 --> 02:17:43.147]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.989]  Gold.
[02:17:46.329 --> 02:17:47.610]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:53.973]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:54.134 --> 02:17:57.976]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:58.336 --> 02:18:00.217]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:00.277 --> 02:18:02.578]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:02.698 --> 02:18:10.282]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:18:10.282 --> 02:18:11.043]  We're good to
[02:18:27.858 --> 02:18:28.138]  We're good.
[02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:47.530]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:51.611]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:18:51.931 --> 02:18:52.751]  Read the labels.
[02:18:53.192 --> 02:18:57.313]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:57.533 --> 02:19:01.714]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:02.094 --> 02:19:06.956]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:19:07.356 --> 02:19:10.940]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:16.467]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:19:16.747 --> 02:19:19.470]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:19:19.770 --> 02:19:20.671]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:19:20.972 --> 02:19:21.452]  Call now!
[02:19:22.213 --> 02:19:23.114]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:48.203]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:48.583 --> 02:19:57.390]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:57.730 --> 02:20:02.394]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:02.854 --> 02:20:09.576]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:09.976 --> 02:20:21.800]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:26.702]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:20:26.862 --> 02:20:29.324]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:29.344 --> 02:20:31.164]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:31.204 --> 02:20:32.405]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:32.465 --> 02:20:33.926]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:33.946 --> 02:20:35.006]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:50.223 --> 02:20:55.426]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:20:56.386 --> 02:21:00.468]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:21:00.928 --> 02:21:09.612]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:21:10.393 --> 02:21:15.735]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:21:15.755 --> 02:21:18.937]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms,
[02:21:22.265 --> 02:21:23.166]  Thanks for watching.
[02:21:55.572 --> 02:21:59.214]  Society is changing, and it's not changing for the better.
[02:22:00.374 --> 02:22:04.116]  A new dark age, a technocracy of control is enveloping us.
[02:22:04.176 --> 02:22:12.580]  An iron curtain of propaganda and scientifically crafted mass mind control is being engaged in against the population.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.901]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ian in Canada.
[02:22:15.921 --> 02:22:17.582]  Ian, you're on the air with Steve Coyle.
[02:22:17.622 --> 02:22:18.022]  Go ahead.
[02:22:19.003 --> 02:22:20.023]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:20.063 --> 02:22:24.305]  This is Ian from Ontario, and I corresponded with, or at least sent
[02:22:25.324 --> 02:22:26.806]  I know we have a lot of
[02:22:45.603 --> 02:22:49.204]  People who don't believe in God who are listening, but are concerned about the New World Order.
[02:22:49.544 --> 02:22:52.365]  And I'll just tell them again, the elite do believe in this.
[02:22:52.425 --> 02:22:53.725]  This is real.
[02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:56.365]  This is a real area of study, even if you don't believe in God.
[02:22:56.506 --> 02:22:56.826]  I do.
[02:22:57.386 --> 02:22:59.826]  But even if you don't, the elite believe in this.
[02:22:59.846 --> 02:23:01.647]  They're following this template.
[02:23:01.687 --> 02:23:02.087]  Go ahead.
[02:23:02.667 --> 02:23:05.208]  Well, of course, I phoned you about this before.
[02:23:05.428 --> 02:23:11.029]  We're going crazy up here with this gas giant Jupiter of the great big lies in
[02:23:12.082 --> 02:23:25.166]  The Celestial Big Lie Heaven, and that's same-sex marriage, which is, from the occult point of view, I think it's the unwilling recruitment of the whole population in satanic sexual ritual.
[02:23:26.126 --> 02:23:30.568]  But, um... Well, the elite don't want us producing.
[02:23:31.028 --> 02:23:36.990]  They want to stop the population from reproducing, so that's one of their big reasons for promoting it.
[02:23:37.050 --> 02:23:37.370]  Steve?
[02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:38.470]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:39.671]  That's the point I was going to bring up.
[02:23:39.731 --> 02:23:40.971]  If you're going to do away
[02:23:41.556 --> 02:23:51.985]  With everything that relates to human kind and humanity and male and female producing in the image of God and likeness of God are children.
[02:23:52.045 --> 02:23:53.247]  They have to stop that.
[02:23:53.307 --> 02:24:01.494]  And interestingly enough, Alex, for what it's worth, that whole homosexuality thing started with fallen angels, whether people believe it or not.
[02:24:01.894 --> 02:24:05.938]  It's things that I try and tell people, if you understand the root of evil,
[02:24:06.298 --> 02:24:09.665]  Then you can figure out the fruit of evil, but the bottom line is what you just said.
[02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:12.490]  Also, as you know, it's the way to test.
[02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:17.900]  I wish the gay people in this country would realize they're being used as guinea pigs.
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:25.086]  To introduce some of these new biological... Well, the first place they introduced AIDS was blacks in Africa and gay men in New York.
[02:24:25.386 --> 02:24:25.987]  Absolutely!
[02:24:26.347 --> 02:24:33.413]  So, they're the guinea pigs, but they become the guinea pig executioners, and that's exactly... It's all about population control.
[02:24:33.773 --> 02:24:40.119]  Everything that is going on in Canada, obviously Canada, is the test for that, and that doesn't bode well for Canada.
[02:24:40.139 --> 02:24:44.463]  You look at Canada's total population, you understand it's easier to get rid of the
[02:24:45.083 --> 02:24:50.866]  Few millions that are in Canada, as opposed to ultimately getting ready... Well, and the West is dying.
[02:24:50.926 --> 02:24:58.989]  The West is dying at about 3% a year, and the third world populations, despite all the globalist extermination programs, are exploding.
[02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:00.270]  Thanks for the call, Alex.
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:01.671]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:25:01.931 --> 02:25:07.373]  May I just say one thing in closing to Steve, who I talk to my neighbors about like he's a brother.
[02:25:08.574 --> 02:25:13.276]  But Steve, last week you said we've got to stop arguing about eschatological
[02:25:13.849 --> 02:25:14.109]  I think?
[02:25:44.352 --> 02:25:44.912]  How you doing?
[02:25:45.333 --> 02:25:47.934]  Yeah, I got a couple of things real quick and then I'll drop the phone.
[02:25:47.975 --> 02:25:55.099]  I was listening to one of the callers earlier and it reminded me of something that happened back when the whole Abu Ghraib thing broke.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.282]  I was in a lecture and it was a genetics class.
[02:25:59.903 --> 02:26:08.328]  And before the class started, a professor showed us like a bunch of the photos, you know, the torture photos, some of the ones you did see and then a lot of the ones you didn't see.
[02:26:09.229 --> 02:26:13.452]  And like, I'm not trying to imply any racial thing here, but there's only
[02:26:13.939 --> 02:26:21.607]  Black person in class, I found it weird when most of the, almost all of the students were like, oh why'd you show us that?
[02:26:21.727 --> 02:26:23.088]  That was stupid, that was pointless.
[02:26:23.689 --> 02:26:31.197]  But he told us that we should contact a local human rights organization or whatever and complain about what they were doing to the Iraqis over there.
[02:26:32.136 --> 02:26:41.020]  We were talking about the caller in the first hour who was at his job and they were looking at dead pictures of Iraqi children, one and a half, and the people were like, good, kill those animals.
[02:26:41.601 --> 02:26:46.523]  And see, this is part of the searing of the conscience, or the hardening of the heart.
[02:26:47.904 --> 02:26:51.585]  That's why they create these wars, is to harden our hearts.
[02:26:51.965 --> 02:26:52.746]  Steve comments.
[02:26:53.166 --> 02:26:53.866]  Well, absolutely.
[02:26:53.886 --> 02:27:00.730]  I can't say it better than you did, Alex, and the deal is that not only do they harden our hearts, but they get us used to this stuff.
[02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:07.513]  See, again, it's all psychological profiling and conditioning, and the bottom line is it's just like torture.
[02:27:07.553 --> 02:27:10.375]  When you were on my show, again, three weeks ago, whatever it was,
[02:27:10.755 --> 02:27:12.676]  You nailed the essence of torture.
[02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:13.597]  Now what do we have?
[02:27:13.677 --> 02:27:25.285]  We've got a new Attorney General that is the one that wrote the memorandum on it, and now we've got a Department of Homeland Security who also wrote... I mean, people better get realizing what they're stating.
[02:27:25.485 --> 02:27:28.908]  They're not saying it's going to be for torture over there, it's going to be for torture over here.
[02:27:30.048 --> 02:27:33.111]  Alright, we'll be back with more of your calls, more news, more info.
[02:27:33.131 --> 02:27:33.591]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.949 --> 02:27:38.970]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.871 --> 02:27:42.672]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.713 --> 02:27:49.934]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:58.938]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:27:59.538 --> 02:28:01.278]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[02:28:01.999 --> 02:28:02.599]  While you listen,
[02:28:03.251 --> 02:28:07.933]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:28:08.574 --> 02:28:10.155]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:28:10.695 --> 02:28:12.856]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:28:13.436 --> 02:28:15.457]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:28:16.038 --> 02:28:17.118]  And it's so easy.
[02:28:17.839 --> 02:28:20.120]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:21.300]  When you want.
[02:28:21.861 --> 02:28:22.481]  Where you want.
[02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:28.264]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[02:28:29.139 --> 02:28:31.701]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[02:28:31.721 --> 02:28:31.821]  1-800-4419-W.
[02:28:31.841 --> 02:28:32.782]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:28:32.802 --> 02:28:32.882]  1-800-419-W.
[02:28:45.857 --> 02:28:50.822]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:56.567]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.607 --> 02:29:00.891]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.231 --> 02:29:04.254]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.574 --> 02:29:07.997]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:08.317 --> 02:29:17.684]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:17.945 --> 02:29:21.447]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:47.384 --> 02:29:52.888]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.308 --> 02:29:57.531]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.771 --> 02:30:04.796]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.177 --> 02:30:11.301]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.441 --> 02:30:12.642]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.982 --> 02:30:15.926]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.087 --> 02:30:18.089]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.430 --> 02:30:25.660]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:29.345]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:39.831 --> 02:30:44.074]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[02:30:48.396 --> 02:30:54.460]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.060 --> 02:30:58.022]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.828 --> 02:31:04.130]  Alright, we're about to go back to your calls and to talk more with Steve Coyle and cover some other news.
[02:31:04.170 --> 02:31:07.211]  Before we do that, I have made 11 documentary films.
[02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:09.972]  I do a weekly TV program.
[02:31:10.512 --> 02:31:12.372]  I have written a book, published another book.
[02:31:12.853 --> 02:31:15.433]  I carry a bunch of other great books and videos.
[02:31:16.174 --> 02:31:20.515]  And if you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, it's 15 cents a day.
[02:31:21.175 --> 02:31:24.156]  If you get a yearly subscription, 19 cents a day.

[02:31:33.287 --> 02:31:34.749]  We've been authorized to post there.
[02:31:35.290 --> 02:31:36.872]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:36.932 --> 02:31:37.973]  It's all documented.
[02:31:38.013 --> 02:31:39.876]  It's all publicly admitted.
[02:31:40.256 --> 02:31:42.619]  But it's all put there in one place for you.
[02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:44.602]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:47.806]  Of course at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com we've got
[02:31:48.366 --> 02:31:53.852]  Hours and hours and hours of free video and audio clips and news articles and government documents.
[02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:59.457]  But for exclusive access to all of it, PrisonPlanet.tv, check it out today.
[02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:10.989]  Also, if you want hard copies of the 11 films I've made or any of the other great books and videos that I carry, they're available through InfoWars.com on the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[02:32:12.347 --> 02:32:18.253]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139-888-253-3139.
[02:32:18.273 --> 02:32:27.782]  And, uh, I, uh, just take three or four minutes from Rotaterry.
[02:32:29.283 --> 02:32:32.106]  We show how the government bombed the First World Trade Center.
[02:32:32.126 --> 02:32:33.247]  Cooked the bomb, framed the driver.
[02:32:33.931 --> 02:32:38.893]  Another three or four minutes of the two and a half hour on VHS, three hour on DVD.
[02:32:39.353 --> 02:32:40.273]  Just under three hours.
[02:32:41.033 --> 02:32:54.598]  We spend three minutes with a fireman shooting video of a FEMA director, sub-director, trying to get them to know that all Christians and all founding fathers are bad and gun owners are all enemies and homeschoolers are all terrorists.
[02:32:55.404 --> 02:32:56.945]  You know, that's just a few minutes from that film.
[02:32:57.005 --> 02:32:59.005]  Now it's been in mainstream news.
[02:32:59.065 --> 02:33:08.128]  They do these drills that are basically mind control with hundreds of elementary students where they pour fake blood on them and have men in guns run around and scream at them.
[02:33:08.428 --> 02:33:10.969]  Then they tell them, this is what the homeschoolers are going to do to you.
[02:33:10.989 --> 02:33:13.250]  I mean, folks, that's Soviet mind control.
[02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:14.070]  That's even worse.
[02:33:14.431 --> 02:33:16.611]  Well, we show the documents, the video, and this film.
[02:33:16.891 --> 02:33:18.332]  Now it's been in the news a lot more.
[02:33:18.932 --> 02:33:21.113]  I mean, just the craziness of these videos.
[02:33:21.153 --> 02:33:22.734]  Just the thing after thing.
[02:33:23.135 --> 02:33:24.375]  All this incredible stuff.
[02:33:24.996 --> 02:33:26.196]  One punch after another.
[02:33:26.216 --> 02:33:27.457]  A left, right, left, right.
[02:33:27.797 --> 02:33:31.900]  People see these videos and they wake up in droves.
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:35.542]  90% of those that will sit down and watch the films like Road to Tyranny are waking up.
[02:33:35.582 --> 02:33:36.482]  So call and get them.
[02:33:36.502 --> 02:33:36.562]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:41.685 --> 02:33:47.828]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:48.868 --> 02:33:54.311]  Or as I said for those online, instantaccessatprisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:54.351 --> 02:34:02.934]  You can download copies, burn copies right there, print off copies of my book, Paul Watson's book, share them with people, just get it out to the population.
[02:34:03.295 --> 02:34:04.995]  The globalists know their time is short.
[02:34:05.415 --> 02:34:06.356]  They're moving fast.
[02:34:06.976 --> 02:34:13.360]  Our time is short to warn people about their system coming to full-born global fruition.
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:22.385]  I want to take just a few more calls and then I want to get into mousepox, super weaponized smallpox with Steve Quayle and cover some other news.
[02:34:23.366 --> 02:34:24.066]  Finishing up,
[02:34:25.231 --> 02:34:31.857]  What you were saying, what Lenny from Texas, you're in class and what, people just didn't want to hear about the torture?
[02:34:32.217 --> 02:34:34.339]  They just wanted to kind of stick their heads in the sand?
[02:34:34.519 --> 02:34:41.985]  Well that's better than saying it's a great thing, let's torture more of them, as Lord Limbaugh has said.
[02:34:42.405 --> 02:34:43.186]  Final comments.
[02:34:44.247 --> 02:34:52.013]  Yeah, the last thing I wanted to say was about, there's one thing I was on your site and something really brought this whole New World Order thing home to me.
[02:34:52.594 --> 02:34:54.175]  I'm not exactly sure if this is true, but
[02:34:54.611 --> 02:34:55.031]  I don't know.
[02:35:13.742 --> 02:35:18.529]  Stuff from like Ebola, the SARS, even West Nile was possibly man-made.
[02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:19.831]  Absolutely.
[02:35:19.851 --> 02:35:20.992]  Let me and Steve comment on that.
[02:35:21.012 --> 02:35:22.935]  That's a great segue into mouse pox.
[02:35:23.436 --> 02:35:30.906]  We have the late 1970s, 79, congressional funding to create an autoimmune virus.
[02:35:31.676 --> 02:35:41.581]  We have the documents from the fifties, from fifty-six, where the Australians had already made it, and we're talking about putting it in free food shipments to Asia.
[02:35:42.062 --> 02:35:52.508]  We caught the UN adding female hormones to tetanus shots in programs just for Latin American, African, and Asian women, because it wouldn't hurt a man.
[02:35:52.968 --> 02:35:54.349]  It then sterilizes them.
[02:35:54.629 --> 02:35:55.469]  We've caught them.
[02:35:55.549 --> 02:35:56.830]  We have the documents.
[02:35:56.910 --> 02:35:57.951]  It's not debatable.
[02:35:57.971 --> 02:35:58.531]  Steve Quayle?
[02:35:59.091 --> 02:36:10.639]  Well, yeah, and one of the things that people have got to understand, Alex, is that the race-specific or genetic marker-specific bioweapons have been developed for literally 30 years.
[02:36:10.659 --> 02:36:13.521]  Well, our government protected Joseph Mengele to get all his secrets.
[02:36:13.801 --> 02:36:14.402]  Absolutely.
[02:36:14.422 --> 02:36:16.083]  That just came out in Reuters yesterday.
[02:36:16.103 --> 02:36:19.165]  Of course, we told them 10 years ago, Steve, but Reuters yesterday.
[02:36:19.605 --> 02:36:44.658]  Well, you know, and again, I said the other day, Alex, that the boys from Brazil are active, and I mean, you know, Hitler's children are out there, and I think that when you're dealing with mousepox real quick, and by the way, everyone, Alex is going to be on with me tonight on my radio show, so we can carry on anything we can't get to during this show, and Alex, it's your call whether you want to do one or two hours tonight, but the point I'm trying to get across is if we run out of time,
[02:36:45.058 --> 02:36:45.719]  Mousepox.
[02:36:45.739 --> 02:36:46.679]  I want to get back to this.
[02:36:46.759 --> 02:37:08.133]  The reason why the story came out in National Geographic about putting human brain, actually neurons, into mice is because they are working right now, and I'm told they have achieved it, that once they've got the last wall torn down, then they've got their biological weapon that the New World Order has
[02:37:08.826 --> 02:37:11.287]  We spent trillions of dollars to develop that thing.
[02:37:11.307 --> 02:37:13.047]  We're talking a hundred percent kill rate.
[02:37:13.107 --> 02:37:30.732]  Yes, and see that's why Jesus, you know, everybody wants to quote everybody else, but Jesus said if the days weren't shortened, that means literally, if he didn't move supernaturally, there wouldn't be anybody left on earth except these technologically decadent, devil-worshipping, New World Order people.
[02:37:31.692 --> 02:37:35.013]  Let's go over the mousepox, and this feeds into the
[02:37:35.928 --> 02:37:39.551]  It's over a hundred, but confirm murders 48 microbiologists.
[02:37:39.631 --> 02:37:42.474]  I want to go over this for people that just joined us.
[02:37:42.494 --> 02:37:44.396]  Now this is fact, okay?
[02:37:45.216 --> 02:38:01.471]  Two and a half years ago, Sydney Morning Herald, all the big papers in Australia, the Australian government released online the recipe of how to take what mousepox did, they found was 98% lethal in rodents,
[02:38:05.217 --> 02:38:14.024]  How to take it and how to introduce it into any mammal and then create the bioweapon from that that kills 98% with tweaking.
[02:38:14.424 --> 02:38:17.666]  We're talking 100% but there's always a few who are immune to anything.
[02:38:18.367 --> 02:38:19.788]  So we're talking high 90s.
[02:38:20.549 --> 02:38:25.472]  They then released how to do it through the university government website.
[02:38:25.512 --> 02:38:28.715]  Now, they do this over and over again.
[02:38:29.235 --> 02:38:32.097]  You know, it's like Russia letting these nukes go.
[02:38:32.157 --> 02:38:34.479]  That way when the government, the global government itself does it,
[02:38:35.109 --> 02:38:39.274]  The 48 microbiologists that are dying, they're experts in treating this, or they were experts in detecting it, or they were the experts who helped develop it.
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:54.463]  And, again, you can type this in, Washington Post, folks.
[02:38:55.004 --> 02:38:59.748]  A lot of the microbiologists that are being killed are being killed by, in a satanic ritual.
[02:39:00.109 --> 02:39:01.910]  One of the first, what, four years ago?
[02:39:02.371 --> 02:39:05.174]  Had his heart and guts cut out and a pentagram carved on his back?
[02:39:06.975 --> 02:39:07.816]  Yes, Dr. Schwartz.
[02:39:08.136 --> 02:39:09.417]  Top bioweapons experts.
[02:39:09.758 --> 02:39:10.058]  Others.
[02:39:11.099 --> 02:39:17.925]  Most of them are being stabbed to death, and then the police like to keep this secret, but later it leaks out, having weird symbols carved on them.
[02:39:18.425 --> 02:39:27.734]  Or, in the case of Houston a few months ago, a car jumps the curb in the university in a 50 mile an hour zone, runs over them, backs back over the body,
[02:39:28.754 --> 02:39:35.958]  People were being in Missouri a few weeks ago, top bioweapons guy, stabbed to death, put in his car, the car burned.
[02:39:36.698 --> 02:39:37.899]  What's going on here, Steve?
[02:39:38.239 --> 02:39:41.761]  Well, first of all, again, you've laid it out, Alex, very correctly.
[02:39:41.781 --> 02:39:45.363]  By the way, it's up to 55 and the list will be updated on my website.
[02:39:46.082 --> 02:39:53.071]  Fifty-five now, counting the young genius level student that was just murdered, a Vietnamese microbiologist.
[02:39:53.211 --> 02:39:59.339]  I was contacted, Alex, by one of the widows of one of these scientists who said, my husband did not commit suicide.
[02:39:59.359 --> 02:40:01.261]  You know Dr. David Kelly, the head of the...
[02:40:03.672 --> 02:40:05.213]  Yeah, Ministry of Defense.
[02:40:05.233 --> 02:40:09.956]  In other words, head of Great Britain's bio-development, bio-weapons development.
[02:40:10.036 --> 02:40:15.980]  He said, he told colleagues, they're going to kill me, and then they kill him, and they go, oh, it's suicide.
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:17.101]  Yeah, the Hutton Report.
[02:40:17.141 --> 02:40:18.182]  Well, let me share this with you.
[02:40:18.522 --> 02:40:21.264]  The minute he disappeared, I said he was murdered, okay?
[02:40:21.484 --> 02:40:24.166]  The minute he disappeared, and the minute they came out with that,
[02:40:24.506 --> 02:40:25.848]  I said, look, they're covering up.
[02:40:25.928 --> 02:40:31.833]  It's just like Vladimir Pashnik, the guy that defected to Britain, who, by the way, was friends with Dr. David Kelly.
[02:40:32.154 --> 02:40:39.841]  He's the one that succeeded in micro-pulverizing some of the things like anthrax.
[02:40:39.902 --> 02:40:41.203]  And, I mean, he gets whacked, too.
[02:40:41.323 --> 02:40:41.984]  All these people.
[02:40:42.204 --> 02:40:44.066]  You know, this is something I get hundreds of emails.
[02:40:44.106 --> 02:40:46.248]  People say, well, why would anybody kill all these guys?
[02:40:46.568 --> 02:40:53.992]  Because they're either associated with bioweapons development, they either knew their colleagues who were, they either worked on it in the past, or they haven't.
[02:40:54.012 --> 02:40:55.732]  The key is they can identify who did it.
[02:40:55.873 --> 02:40:56.453]  You got it.
[02:40:56.613 --> 02:40:57.533]  That's it in a nutshell.
[02:40:57.713 --> 02:41:02.336]  Anybody that can say this was made at XYZ Laboratory is being killed.
[02:41:02.656 --> 02:41:03.136]  You got it.
[02:41:03.396 --> 02:41:04.637]  And it's not going to stop.
[02:41:05.297 --> 02:41:06.278]  And I tell people this.
[02:41:06.338 --> 02:41:10.461]  I said, look, when I first broke this story, okay, people just poo-pooed it.
[02:41:10.521 --> 02:41:14.463]  They said, well, in any given population of 6 billion people, 44 biologists.
[02:41:14.623 --> 02:41:16.244]  These aren't 44 biologists.
[02:41:16.284 --> 02:41:20.027]  These are the world's premier, preeminent,
[02:41:20.467 --> 02:41:25.129]  Biological weapons designers, or the guys that... Well, they're being murdered, mafia style!
[02:41:25.489 --> 02:41:26.449]  Absolutely!
[02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:34.652]  And Alex, it's astonishing, you know, guys with their hands tied behind their back, and they're hung, and they said, yeah, they kill themselves, you know?
[02:41:34.732 --> 02:41:37.093]  Or people run over, like the gentleman in Texas.
[02:41:37.113 --> 02:41:40.394]  He was one of the lead researchers on Norwalk-like viruses.
[02:41:40.414 --> 02:41:44.735]  Do you know why all the cruise ships are breaking out in a Norwalk-like virus?
[02:41:44.775 --> 02:41:46.416]  When everybody sees Norwalk-like
[02:41:46.796 --> 02:41:48.037]  Or any anthrax-like.
[02:41:48.097 --> 02:41:49.579]  The word like is a giveaway.
[02:41:49.899 --> 02:41:53.803]  That's a genetically altered and created pathogen.
[02:41:53.863 --> 02:41:58.427]  The reason they put them on ships at sea, because if some of their experiments go wacky, guess what?
[02:41:58.467 --> 02:42:00.268]  They can sink or incinerate the ship.
[02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.890]  Now!
[02:42:02.708 --> 02:42:04.710]  Norwalk is coming onto the continent.
[02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:15.779]  It's breaking out now, not just on ships, it's on... I mean... And people all over are dying of infections in hospitals that were just fine, flesh-eating bacteria everywhere, and they keep it real quiet.
[02:42:16.079 --> 02:42:20.223]  Absolutely, necrotizing pathiitis, you know, staphylococcus aureus, all these...
[02:42:20.663 --> 02:42:28.571]  Big words are basically saying they have contempt for humanity, and God loves humanity, and therein lies the battle.
[02:42:28.611 --> 02:42:39.661]  The devil's out to destroy every last woman and child, man, woman, and child, and he's using his political and religious organization, New World Order, so when these people are out worshipping Moloch,
[02:42:40.021 --> 02:42:42.122]  And all the other things that your film is detailed.
[02:42:42.142 --> 02:42:46.724]  They've got to understand, the end product of all this stuff is utter destruction.
[02:42:47.004 --> 02:42:48.305]  And I gotta tell you something, Alex.
[02:42:48.365 --> 02:42:52.627]  It's astonishing to me that people let this mousepox thing just ride.
[02:42:52.947 --> 02:42:53.547]  You understand?
[02:42:53.587 --> 02:42:57.269]  This is the ultimate Pandora's box.
[02:42:57.649 --> 02:43:04.512]  Now it's loose, now it's... I mean, people are making... It's a formula to make a almost total kill rate
[02:43:05.332 --> 02:43:08.753]  virus with any mammal.
[02:43:08.773 --> 02:43:13.474]  Let's talk to Dr. William Deagle, who just called in, who worked in some of these programs.
[02:43:13.554 --> 02:43:14.815]  Dr. Deagle, how are you doing?
[02:43:15.655 --> 02:43:19.916]  Excellent, especially after hearing the amazing dialogue between Steve and yourself.
[02:43:20.916 --> 02:43:22.297]  I want to make a couple of comments.
[02:43:22.417 --> 02:43:26.518]  As a medical doctor, I was trained actually in infectious disease before I went into medicine.
[02:43:27.458 --> 02:43:29.979]  And the guy that I trained under, Dr. Roger Brown, was actually
[02:43:30.563 --> 02:43:34.726]  Working at the Rutgers Campus Class 4 installation for the U.S.
[02:43:34.766 --> 02:43:36.848]  Government.
[02:43:37.068 --> 02:43:41.392]  In 71, they actually had a recombinant T-virus that could paralyze you and make you suffocate.
[02:43:42.213 --> 02:43:46.796]  And the virus got out of the containment on the one day in 10 years he was sick, and it killed all his colleagues.
[02:43:46.856 --> 02:43:50.139]  They locked the building down and incinerated all of his colleagues.
[02:43:50.159 --> 02:43:54.743]  They just had a bio-release in a Boston bio-lab and kept that real quiet.
[02:43:55.705 --> 02:44:00.086]  They keep on saying they're doing defensive testing, but they've developed unbelievable weapons.
[02:44:00.146 --> 02:44:24.271]  In March of 1997, I spoke about genetic engineering and Zurich, Switzerland at Human Life International, and after two hours of me speaking, the board asked me to sit down in front of their panel of experts, and they gave me six inches of documents of the World Health Organization and the United Nations secret laboratories to release plagues to kill 85 to 90 percent of the world population, and that's a fact.
[02:44:24.898 --> 02:44:25.218]  Wow!
[02:44:26.019 --> 02:44:28.080]  Thank you so much, Dr. Tuber, for sharing that.
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:30.762]  I wanted to share one other thing, and this goes back to scripture.
[02:44:30.782 --> 02:44:32.103]  It's Daniel chapter 3, verse 43.
[02:44:32.143 --> 02:44:48.714]  And it says, and I'm going to read to King James, And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
[02:44:49.315 --> 02:44:52.477]  The genetic engineering went on before Noah, and it's going on right now.
[02:44:53.106 --> 02:45:02.836]  And the abominations in labs like underground in Colorado were moved from Area 51, I know, because I took care of people who actually worked in these facilities and saw the abomination.
[02:45:04.518 --> 02:45:13.607]  And Doctor, let me just add to this, because some of those individuals that saw the abominations, and literally they were abominations, I've seen grown men cry.
[02:45:13.627 --> 02:45:14.308]  Oh they did, they did.
[02:45:14.961 --> 02:45:17.446]  I think they break down because... This is a Herne Delta.
[02:45:17.606 --> 02:45:21.954]  Delta Force gentleman who actually was a computer engineer, went to one of these facilities underground.
[02:45:22.255 --> 02:45:22.395]  Yep.
[02:45:22.495 --> 02:45:26.302]  And he came back, and literally for months, all he could do when he talked about it was start crying.
[02:45:26.643 --> 02:45:26.863]  Right.
[02:45:27.424 --> 02:45:27.565]  Yeah.
[02:45:27.967 --> 02:45:36.949]  And then, you know, the stories that are out there from Delta Force and from the guys who go in and fight these entities, you know, when they get out of hands.
[02:45:37.089 --> 02:45:44.671]  Alex, that's a fascinating story because anything that is out of control is always sanitized and it doesn't matter.
[02:45:44.711 --> 02:45:48.451]  They kill everybody to cover it up, just like the Biolab incidents.
[02:45:48.811 --> 02:45:56.453]  Well, everything I've been told in last year, this so-called SARS that was released, I have a friend that worked at Fort Detrick and just last year he told me.
[02:45:56.977 --> 02:45:59.520]  That this was a race specific virus to kill Asians.
[02:46:00.501 --> 02:46:04.425]  And he said that they're about to release something that's going to kill hundreds of millions.
[02:46:05.034 --> 02:46:05.795]  This year or next?
[02:46:06.035 --> 02:46:12.420]  Well, one of the top Russian bioweapons specialists said he's worried about this weaponized flu, that what he's thinking could kill a billion.
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:14.061]  That was in Reuters.
[02:46:14.582 --> 02:46:15.082]  And then what?
[02:46:15.262 --> 02:46:25.730]  Four years ago, Steve, they went and dug up a dead whaler, an obese whaler, who was frozen in the permafrost and got the Spanish flu out of his lungs.
[02:46:25.971 --> 02:46:28.713]  And then now the alert comes out, this could reemerge.
[02:46:29.033 --> 02:46:37.178]  They're actually recombining it with other viruses to see if they can weaponize it by looking at what's called the changes in the receptor, locking mechanism onto the human cells.
[02:46:37.799 --> 02:46:42.282]  And they're actually doing these experiments against a lot of scientists saying, don't do this, it's dangerous.
[02:46:42.642 --> 02:46:44.663]  Just like they're doing experiments on smallpox.
[02:46:45.384 --> 02:46:53.109]  And they've actually tried to recombine a form of smallpox, these scientists, and in the first half of the 20th century alone it killed 300 million.
[02:46:53.509 --> 02:46:55.210]  That's a fact, that's a historical fact.
[02:46:55.410 --> 02:46:56.231]  Well for those that
[02:46:57.276 --> 02:47:07.245]  For those that don't know, I've had the CEO on from upstate New York, where we're on the radio, who owns the company guarded by the military with the spider goats.
[02:47:07.946 --> 02:47:09.107]  I mean, this stuff's real!
[02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:13.871]  People are in such denial.
[02:47:13.911 --> 02:47:14.952]  Thanks for the call, Leonard Eagle.
[02:47:15.693 --> 02:47:17.254]  A great guy we've had on as a guest before.
[02:47:17.314 --> 02:47:19.336]  Steve, I've had people walk up to me
[02:47:20.288 --> 02:47:25.532]  One guy, when I was getting a pizza, I was picking a pizza up and he walked up to me and he said, you're a liar, there's no such thing as cross-species.
[02:47:26.132 --> 02:47:30.255]  And I said, man, the type of spider that goes into a search engine, AP, Reuters, CBS News.
[02:47:30.655 --> 02:47:33.157]  I said, yeah, it's real, it's old, it's a decade old.
[02:47:33.818 --> 02:47:35.779]  And he said, no, I had biology.
[02:47:35.799 --> 02:47:37.040]  And I said, when did you have biology?
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:37.040]  1973.
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:37.320]  Right.
[02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:42.744]  It's just that they're in denial with stuff that's already admitted.
[02:47:43.144 --> 02:47:49.729]  When people deny that and they say there is no cross-species, I tell them they're suffering from intellectual feces.
[02:47:50.239 --> 02:47:51.640]  Because they don't do their homework.
[02:47:51.660 --> 02:47:55.622]  You know, Alex, I don't, I don't, I'm obviously, as you know, not a pacifist.
[02:47:55.982 --> 02:48:05.207]  And the thing is, is that it's like even when I deal with some, you know, PhDs in molecular biology, look, if they're not prominent in their field,
[02:48:05.734 --> 02:48:09.917]  They either will, if they are prominent, they'll either lie or say they can't talk about it.
[02:48:10.217 --> 02:48:20.865]  But when we're talking about the 55, and now the number's 55 Alex, 55 dead scientists, world class, we're talking the premier, the creme de la creme.
[02:48:22.366 --> 02:48:23.807]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:24.147 --> 02:48:28.190]  We'll take a few more calls on the other side of this quick break with our guest, Steve Quayle.
[02:48:28.671 --> 02:48:30.032]  His website, stevequayle.com.
[02:48:31.087 --> 02:48:33.208]  We'll spell that out for you on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:33.809 --> 02:48:34.929]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:48:34.949 --> 02:48:37.451]  Don't forget the website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:37.571 --> 02:48:42.494]  They're building the Prison Planet so they can have an orderly extermination.
[02:48:45.993 --> 02:48:50.355]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.535 --> 02:48:54.997]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.117 --> 02:48:59.479]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.519 --> 02:49:00.880]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:06.882]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.942 --> 02:49:13.884]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.984 --> 02:49:16.045]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.245 --> 02:49:26.749]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.009 --> 02:49:27.429]  If you want
[02:49:27.449 --> 02:49:28.170]  We're good to go.
[02:49:47.126 --> 02:49:58.375]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:58.595 --> 02:50:02.098]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:02.358 --> 02:50:02.778]  We're good to go!
[02:50:23.493 --> 02:50:30.417]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:30.637 --> 02:50:34.539]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.659 --> 02:50:37.300]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:38.501]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.246 --> 02:50:52.195]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.435 --> 02:50:54.678]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.879 --> 02:51:01.228]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.608 --> 02:51:02.208]  I think so.
[02:51:21.974 --> 02:51:22.415]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.459 --> 02:51:52.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.841 --> 02:51:55.662]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.843 --> 02:52:14.834]  You know, Joseph Kennedy Jr., the big brother of JFK, died over Germany flying a fighter aircraft piloting two separate remote control B-7 teams loaded with explosives.
[02:52:15.495 --> 02:52:17.076]  We had our own Kriz missiles.
[02:52:18.276 --> 02:52:19.237]  It wasn't just the Germans.
[02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:29.287]  But still, and since 1958, NORAD has been remote controlling aircraft for target practice, but still people call me and email me and say it doesn't exist, you can't remote control planes.
[02:52:29.727 --> 02:52:32.549]  Well, by 2010, half the Air Force is going to be drone.
[02:52:33.550 --> 02:52:41.476]  By 2010, they plan to have over 5,000 combat mechs, or robots, in combat.
[02:52:42.603 --> 02:52:47.370]  And they're already sending a bunch to Iraq and, you know, this is out of Associated Press.
[02:52:48.912 --> 02:52:54.100]  People are, like, behind the curve for where we are, the things that are happening.
[02:52:55.141 --> 02:52:56.783]  And I've got an article here out of the CBC.
[02:52:58.387 --> 02:52:59.768]  Where they pulled over the wrong guy.
[02:52:59.808 --> 02:53:06.954]  They pulled over a cop and it was American State Police from Austin in Canada as part of quote an exchange program.
[02:53:06.974 --> 02:53:07.875]  Well, yeah, this is happening.
[02:53:08.195 --> 02:53:10.637]  It's put on local news that foreign police are coming to Austin.
[02:53:10.677 --> 02:53:12.798]  Our police are going to... This is world government.
[02:53:13.499 --> 02:53:14.379]  This is happening.
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:17.442]  And just, you know, all of this stuff.
[02:53:17.462 --> 02:53:23.026]  We're about to talk to Stanford, New Jersey, the last caller we have time to take, but comments on what I was just talking about, Steve.
[02:53:23.908 --> 02:53:27.710]  Well, the bottom line is that I tell people if they deny, they die.
[02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:38.934]  And, you know, contrary to evidence, I think I finally figured it out, Alex, after a decade of this stuff, is people don't want to admit what you're saying is true or what I'm telling them is true because it's too painful.
[02:53:39.014 --> 02:53:42.195]  And also, they've gotten accustomed to the Matrix.
[02:53:42.215 --> 02:53:45.236]  They've gotten accustomed to living in the world of denial.
[02:53:45.336 --> 02:53:47.517]  So I say, fine, I won't argue anymore.
[02:53:47.737 --> 02:53:49.038]  You want to deny it, you'll die.
[02:53:50.788 --> 02:53:56.353]  Well, the elite won't have a problem when they've got robotic remote control forces to do their dirty work.
[02:53:56.393 --> 02:54:00.457]  Just a few people will be able to wage war, something new in history.
[02:54:01.378 --> 02:54:05.922]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Stanford in New Jersey.
[02:54:05.962 --> 02:54:06.543]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:07.364 --> 02:54:08.044]  How's everybody doing?
[02:54:08.565 --> 02:54:08.805]  Good.
[02:54:09.185 --> 02:54:09.386]  Good.
[02:54:09.966 --> 02:54:13.089]  First of all, I want you to know that you're right about everything you're saying.
[02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:14.951]  All these things are going on.
[02:54:15.757 --> 02:54:21.200]  Unfortunately for the church, they've been lulled into thinking that there's something going to happen called a rapture.
[02:54:22.041 --> 02:54:24.663]  Which actually is something a lie from the devil.
[02:54:25.303 --> 02:54:33.288]  Who's getting us to, while Christians just lay around not doing anything, they've got their bags packed like they're going somewhere when they should be preparing for battle.
[02:54:33.308 --> 02:54:34.929]  That's what's really going on.
[02:54:35.791 --> 02:54:40.075]  Well, regardless, we've got a job to fight evil and stand up and fight corruption.
[02:54:40.135 --> 02:54:40.575]  I've heard this.
[02:54:40.855 --> 02:54:42.817]  Praise God they're pushing microchips.
[02:54:43.097 --> 02:54:44.699]  That means we'll be out of here soon.
[02:54:45.239 --> 02:54:47.781]  They're not even out warning people not to take it.
[02:54:47.901 --> 02:54:48.322]  That's right.
[02:54:48.402 --> 02:54:50.644]  Listen, brother, let me give you some good encourage.
[02:54:51.124 --> 02:54:53.006]  And the Lord loves you, and I love you.
[02:54:53.086 --> 02:54:55.007]  I just started listening to you a couple weeks ago.
[02:54:55.107 --> 02:54:55.408]  Listen.
[02:54:56.068 --> 02:54:59.071]  And you've confirmed things that I've seen in a vision for 30 years.
[02:54:59.291 --> 02:54:59.851]  Let me tell you.
[02:55:00.252 --> 02:55:04.175]  What you're forgetting, this nation, if you read the Bible close,
[02:55:05.043 --> 02:55:08.384]  Is that place prepared in the desert for that woman?
[02:55:08.604 --> 02:55:09.445]  Now who are the women?
[02:55:09.985 --> 02:55:10.725]  There are two women.
[02:55:11.365 --> 02:55:15.707]  The one that's riding on the beast is not the Catholic Church.
[02:55:15.887 --> 02:55:16.668]  It's Israel.
[02:55:17.348 --> 02:55:18.848]  The other one is the church.
[02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:24.491]  And what everybody keeps messing up is that man child is not Jesus either.
[02:55:24.971 --> 02:55:27.252]  That's one of God's two end time prophets.
[02:55:27.652 --> 02:55:30.793]  I'm telling you the next event will be they'll be anointed
[02:55:31.141 --> 02:55:42.108]  For the first half of the 70th week, they're gonna take this nation back, and I'm telling you right now, they'll die in Israel, you'll see them, and God's spirit will be in you, and you...
[02:55:44.531 --> 02:55:46.473]  Well, I appreciate your call, so we're flat out of time.
[02:55:46.493 --> 02:55:47.715]  Steve Quayle, final comments?
[02:55:48.095 --> 02:55:48.355]  Yeah.
[02:55:48.495 --> 02:55:49.937]  Join us tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:50.017 --> 02:55:52.180]  Alex will be my guest.
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:53.861]  3.210 on Shortwave or on the Internet.
[02:55:54.182 --> 02:55:55.143]  SteveQuayle.com.
[02:55:55.183 --> 02:55:55.723]  Listen live.
[02:55:55.763 --> 02:55:57.926]  And Alex, again, decide if you want to do one hour or two.
[02:55:58.046 --> 02:56:00.208]  Thank you for having me on with you tonight.
[02:56:00.308 --> 02:56:02.391]  It's, you know, it's just been wonderful.
[02:56:03.058 --> 02:56:05.840]  Well, it's been great talking to you, Steve, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:06.260]  Take care.
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:06.821]  Thank you.
[02:56:07.261 --> 02:56:07.982]  We're out of time.
[02:56:08.002 --> 02:56:13.866]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, and rebroadcast throughout the weekend to all our affiliates, all our sponsors.
[02:56:14.206 --> 02:56:21.952]  You, the listeners, the great folks running the broadcast, to my webmasters, to my wife, to everybody, thank you for the great job you do.
[02:56:22.712 --> 02:56:24.514]  And truth is stranger than fiction.
