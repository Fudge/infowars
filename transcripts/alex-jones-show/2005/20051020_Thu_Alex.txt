[00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:05.932]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:07.673]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:09.475]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:10.936]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:12.658]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:16.941]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:21.545]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:38.265]  It's already Thursday, the 20th day of October 2005.
[00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:44.167]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:54.051]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz, just expert on the poisonous vaccines, expert on military-industrial complex-produced plagues.
[00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:59.514]  He will be joining us to discuss the fraud that is the bird flu.
[00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:14.275]  And then coming up in the middle of the next hour or an hour and a half from now, Colonel Craig Roberts, my good buddy, he's written a two-part series, Martial Law, coming to a neighborhood near you.
[00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:24.717]  He'll be joining us to talk about Ron Paul's little discussion he had with us last week about impending martial law here in the United States.
[00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:29.398]  More and more people are just coming right out with the facts.
[00:01:32.102 --> 00:01:41.048]  The New World Order plan is taking shape around us right now, but we have a good chance of stopping it if we all take action.
[00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.332]  Wilma may hit Florida by Sunday night.
[00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:53.497]  Storm off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula could intensify.
[00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:56.839]  It's already got winds of 150 to 175 gyrating between those speeds.
[00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.534]  And if it goes much faster, the wins, than 175, we could have a Category 6 on our hands.
[00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:13.558]  A whole new level in the scale, never before recorded.
[00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:17.820]  Rumsfeld's over in China having a fabulous time with them, we'll tell you about that.
[00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.782]  Cheney Cabal is hijacking U.S.
[00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:21.703]  foreign policy.
[00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.393]  And that is what we're being told by one of the chief deputies of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
[00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.675]  This is more good cop, bad cop positioning that is going on.
[00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:34.736]  The U.S.
[00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:39.779]  may have to stay in Iraq until 2016.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.282]  That's what Condi Rice has told the Associated Press.
[00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:49.345]  Well, that's the same thing that Cheney said last year.
[00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:50.386]  He said 12 more years.
[00:02:51.272 --> 00:03:01.840]  So that would be 11 more on his clock, and Bush has said it's a 100 year war and told Tony Blair, we're going to attack Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, and maybe even North Korea.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.041]  Just attack everyone!
[00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:04.642]  Start attacking!
[00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:08.726]  Meanwhile, all his buddies have been arming those countries, but we'll just ignore that.
[00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:15.671]  And a lot of new reports coming out that just confirm the old reports of sexual torture.
[00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.562]  And a lot of these we can't read on air, it's just too graphic.
[00:03:19.943 --> 00:03:27.246]  We can't even read passages of the Army's admissions in their own report of two years ago, the General Togumba report, a year and a half ago.
[00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:33.328]  The three-star general report, but it's what we, some of it we already knew about.
[00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:45.614]  Basically they would have, they would rape the detainees and they think they go to hell if they, Muslims do, if they have sex with a woman who's in her menstrual cycle or
[00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.896]  And it's basically, it's all satanic.
[00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:52.077]  It's what the globals do, it's what they always do.
[00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:57.578]  I mean, the admission is beating people to death, raping women in front of their husbands, raping children in front of the parents.
[00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.260]  So, this really is just part of the course, and there's a bunch of new developments here.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.762]  On this, and of course now it's come out what we told you about two and a half years ago, General Rick Baucus quit refusing to torture.
[00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:15.185]  That's now been in a frontline documentary and in another UPI article yesterday.
[00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:18.426]  They also are torturing people the way the Communist Chinese do.
[00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:26.209]  If you refuse to eat the poison food they're giving you, they will just continually cram the tube down your nose into your gut until you start bleeding.
[00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:27.830]  They just do it over and over again.
[00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.812]  They cram the hose in, rip the hose out, cram the hose in, rip the hose out.
[00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:35.003]  A lot of Mingala type stuff.
[00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:36.044]  Very Mingalish.
[00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:39.107]  But again, if you're against Mingala, you're a Nazi.
[00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:40.448]  If you're for Mingala, you're good.
[00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.090]  And will receive ADL awards.
[00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:48.575]  How can a civilized society allow torture?
[00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.236]  Is a big question.
[00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.717]  A good editorial here that we'll be going over.
[00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.660]  And just so much more.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.141]  Two huge guests today.
[00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:57.222]  Your call.
[00:04:57.522 --> 00:04:58.723]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.964 --> 00:04:59.504]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:05.089]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:06.910]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.911]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:16.693]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:21.315]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:22.255]  The Constitution has
[00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:24.356]  It's been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:29.097]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:33.718]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:41.161]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.841]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:03.123]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:07.366]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:10.388]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:17.133]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:17.353]  Yes.
[00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:20.376]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.958]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:33.166]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:42.570]  More MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:50.493]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:04.515]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:05.075]  Why?
[00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:08.037]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:07:08.138 --> 00:07:13.061]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:07:13.201 --> 00:07:22.909]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:03.939]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:07.379]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:24.763]  8 minutes, 17 seconds into this first hour of worldwide transmission on this 20th day of October 2005.
[00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:27.564]  I'm your host, Alejandro Jones.
[00:08:29.523 --> 00:08:30.824]  And I'm very excited about it.
[00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:33.505]  We've got Dr. Len Horowitz joining us.
[00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:43.130]  He is coming on in about 25 minutes for a full hour to discuss the bird flu fraud and what it's a cover story for.
[00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:51.975]  And without ever reading what Dr. Horowitz had to say about the bird flu, without ever reading now what the Spanish scientist and the Spanish
[00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:58.852]  Agriculture Minister had to say about it without ever reading what all these other individuals have to say about it.
[00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:11.814]  I came to the same conclusions because it's the classic MO of the New World Order, but it was good to see Dr. Horowitz's amazing research on it that even sheds new light on this, so brace yourselves and get ready.
[00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:19.936]  We're going to get into vaccines and the full magnitude of what we can document designed to kill you and your family.
[00:09:20.757 --> 00:09:22.318]  I'm sorry, it's just a fact.
[00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.299]  The evidence, we have it in triplicate.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.881]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:34.325]  Alright, in fact, Dr. Horowitz on his own website has posted many of the declassified documents, you name it, for free.
[00:09:34.546 --> 00:09:35.826]  So we'll tell you about that coming up.
[00:09:36.147 --> 00:09:46.193]  And then of course, my good buddy, Colonel Craig Roberts, will be joining us to talk about his two-part series, Martial Law, coming to a neighborhood near you.
[00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:50.300]  Wilma may hit Florida by Sunday night.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.282]  Hurricane Wilma weakens slightly to a Category 4.
[00:09:53.862 --> 00:09:59.385]  Early Thursday, as forecasters predicted, the storm could make landfall in Florida on Sunday night.
[00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:11.089]  Turning slowly towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Wilma has top winds of 145 mph, but the storm may intensify later in the day as it crosses warmer waters.
[00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:22.199]  On Wednesday, the hurricane was a powerful Category 5 storm on the Simpson Intensity Scale with sustained winds peaking at 175 mph.
[00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.085]  Five miles an hour faster, it'll be a new category, a category six.
[00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:38.878]  Hundreds of miles away along Florida's southwestern coast, authorities, not public servants, but officials and authorities, God, humans, we always, whenever they use those terms, we have to
[00:10:39.398 --> 00:10:40.599]  Point out how powerful they are.
[00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:47.705]  Hundreds of miles away along Florida's southwest coast, God leaders, were already monitoring the storm closely.
[00:10:48.146 --> 00:11:00.636]  We're going to meet this afternoon with our County Emergency Management Director, Chuck Reinhart, Police Chief in Puta Gorda, a southwestern coastal community hit hard by Hurricane Charlie in 2004.
[00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:09.277]  They're saying they're mainly monitoring phase now to determine the direction that the storm is going to take.
[00:11:10.158 --> 00:11:14.520]  A decision whether to evacuate will be made later this afternoon or maybe tomorrow.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.002]  He said Thursday morning, just a few hours ago.
[00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:28.347]  And this ties the all-time record for the number of hurricanes, but the severity of these hurricanes literally dwarfs
[00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:34.507]  The previous hurricanes in that record year, 75 years ago.
[00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:38.929]  And they're not following patterns that hurricanes have ever followed.
[00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:42.770]  They're coming out of regions of the Atlantic and the Caribbean.
[00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.551]  They're taking paths that have never been seen before.
[00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:57.134]  And we have had, on this broadcast, we're going to be having him back on, the individual who literally headed up the Pentagon's weather weapons program.
[00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:02.768]  We interviewed him last week.
[00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:06.430]  We put up a transcript of the interview and it's gotten a lot of attention around the web.
[00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:15.895]  It's funny though to hear other Patriots on the air and other neocon talk shows on other networks talking about the story but not telling anybody where it came from.
[00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:26.921]  It's always... I personally don't care but they might tell you where you can go get the actual story and the actual transcript of it in key quotes
[00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:36.473]  By the meteorologist instead of just saying they heard a meteorologist who worked for the government saying it on another show.
[00:12:37.353 --> 00:12:40.313]  I never figured that out, but interesting.
[00:12:41.493 --> 00:12:48.495]  Because we give credit to everybody else, I mean, because we want you to be able to go get it from the source where it came from.
[00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:52.355]  So you can actually source it and look at it for yourself, but a side issue.
[00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:55.576]  What we do know is that with ancient
[00:12:56.235 --> 00:13:00.116]  And by ancient, every two and a half years, we double the level of our technology.
[00:13:00.637 --> 00:13:10.140]  So stuff developed in the 1950s and tested and proven in the 1950s, with very primitive technologies, is ancient in the scale of modern technology.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:25.645]  Stuff developed in the 50s, tested in the mid-50s, tested in the 60s, proven to shut down hurricanes, to substantively weaken them, to direct them, to move them, to modify them, with just a couple of aircraft.
[00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:34.828]  In the 1950s, now the aircraft can carry 800 times more of the chemicals, and they can just basically knock them out.
[00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:43.231]  It's safe to say, he said, with the evidence just from the 50s, that they can stop hurricanes, shut them down, change their direction.
[00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:51.333]  But in the 50s, they could slow them down and reduce them by upwards of 25% or more, just with one plane of chemicals.
[00:13:53.614 --> 00:13:54.674]  So, we know
[00:13:55.416 --> 00:14:07.124]  That as this hurricane, as Wilma nears Florida and prepares to devastate the coast, we know that we could stop it.
[00:14:07.184 --> 00:14:09.505]  We know that something could be done.
[00:14:11.087 --> 00:14:12.147]  In fact, do me a favor.
[00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:14.849]  I don't know why I didn't think to do this.
[00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:19.692]  Call my producer.
[00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.554]  We don't have time to waste on this.
[00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.535]  And see if we can get
[00:14:24.252 --> 00:14:30.216]  The government meteorologist, really the father of modern weather warfare, ran the operations in Vietnam.
[00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:51.150]  See if we can get him on, maybe the last 30 minutes of today's show, or tomorrow, so he can talk about the fact of how right now they could send planes into this hurricane, and they could start weakening it, they could stop it out there in the Gulf, or they could wait until it neared Florida, and they could fly in and bring it down from a Category 4 down to a Category 1.
[00:14:52.213 --> 00:14:55.760]  And cause the hurricane to dump most of its moisture in the Gulf.
[00:14:56.141 --> 00:14:59.206]  And save lives and billions of dollars of property.
[00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.033]  But don't hold your breath for that to happen.
[00:15:03.354 --> 00:15:04.917]  And again, there's no debating this.
[00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:12.850]  Scientifically proven, major universities and government institutions studied the findings from the 50s and 60s.
[00:15:13.211 --> 00:15:23.877]  Conclusively, they can substantively weaken and control and direct and turn hurricanes away from land back in the 1950s and 60s.
[00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:32.062]  And the technology we have today is light years, literally light years ahead of what they had back then.
[00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:40.166]  Okay, I've just spent five minutes on that, and we have got about fifty stories here, as usual, to go through.
[00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:54.973]  Rumsfeld is over in Beijing, he's openly being threatened by them that you better not give weapons to Taiwan, or we'll spank you, and he's been one of the main people, even during the Clinton administration, ensuring that supercomputers, missile components, MIRV technology, got transferred.
[00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:03.978]  It's like he helped arm Saddam, it's like he gave the nuclear reactors to North Korea, I mean, aspartame, Terminator genes,
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.801]  You name it.
[00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:07.461]  Prozac.
[00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:09.242]  He's always the guy that gets it approved.
[00:16:09.462 --> 00:16:10.603]  He heads the company that does it.
[00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:16.187]  I mean, he is literally the most evil person that we... I mean, he just is always there.
[00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:21.030]  He's like, you know, the devil showing up in lore when you sign your soul over to him.
[00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.111]  He'll make a brief appearance in lore.
[00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:25.713]  It's like Rumsfeld makes an appearance.
[00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:29.155]  He's just involved in every super evil thing we can imagine.
[00:16:31.108 --> 00:16:36.490]  Unbelievable, but he's over in Beijing worshipping right now at the feet of their model country.
[00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.831]  They just love China.
[00:16:37.891 --> 00:16:52.396]  Mass murder of their population, forced sterilizations, murdering already born babies, killing political dissidents for petty issues, harvesting their organs, melting down their fat for greedy housewives in the West to have it injected into their faces and lips.
[00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:58.819]  Cheney Cabal hijacking US foreign policy, Financial Times of London,
[00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:10.119]  Vice President Lord Cheney and a handful of others had hijacked the government's foreign policy apparatus, deciding in secret to carry out policies that had left the U.S.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.583]  weaker and more isolated in the world, the top aide the former Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed on Wednesday.
[00:17:17.824 --> 00:17:23.728]  In a scathing attack on the record of President George W. Bush, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who I'm going to get on,
[00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:41.379]  Chief of Staff to Mr. Powell until last January said, what I saw was a cabal between Vice President of the United States Richard Cheney and the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on critical issues that made decisions that the bureaucracy did not know were being made.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.880]  That's pure bull.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.222]  They would make the decisions and the bureaucracy would implement.
[00:17:46.642 --> 00:17:54.786]  Now it's paying the consequences of making those decisions in secret, but far more telling to me is that America is paying the consequences.
[00:17:55.945 --> 00:18:05.611]  Mr. Wilkerson said that such secret decision making was responsible for mistakes such as the long refusal to engage with North Korea or to back European efforts on Iran.
[00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:11.375]  It also resulted in bitter battles in the administration among those excluded from the decisions.
[00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:13.276]  Okay, let's stop right here.
[00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:22.078]  Powell came out when he had been in the meetings, when they admitted it was all fraud about WNDs.
[00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:22.898]  He was in those meetings.
[00:18:23.198 --> 00:18:25.199]  He comes out and says, we're going to be attacked.
[00:18:25.219 --> 00:18:26.119]  45 minutes.
[00:18:26.179 --> 00:18:27.240]  Here's the anthrax.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.940]  You know, it's all over.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.101]  War is the only thing.
[00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:32.081]  First he acted like he was against the war.
[00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:34.362]  Then, oh, even Powell's for it.
[00:18:34.742 --> 00:18:35.783]  Oh, it must be good.
[00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:36.843]  Again, this is theater.
[00:18:38.764 --> 00:18:42.165]  I mean, he's been there since the Vietnam War in Operation Phoenix.
[00:18:42.465 --> 00:18:43.686]  He's always been there, boy.
[00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:44.906]  He'll always be there, boy.
[00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:49.602]  It's like all these people are minions and lapdogs of the New World Order.
[00:18:51.443 --> 00:19:00.325]  Then he comes out a few months ago to salvage his political career and he says, uh, oh, I'm very embarrassed about what I did and I was just wrong and I was lied to.
[00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:05.806]  But we know from the witnesses that were in there, O'Neal and Clark and many others, that you knew all about it!
[00:19:06.887 --> 00:19:07.607]  So shut up!
[00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:16.649]  And now your little minions out there doing damage control, because if they are going to bring down the Bush administration, again, they're going to get blamed for the war.
[00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:18.350]  They're going to get blamed for everything.
[00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.533]  But you notice, it's just going to continue after they're gone.
[00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:23.615]  John Kerry wanted to invade Iran.
[00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:26.998]  Hillary wants to invade.
[00:19:27.118 --> 00:19:27.498]  Schumer.
[00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:28.339]  All of them.
[00:19:29.364 --> 00:19:31.825]  So, see, they always do this with Nixon, Clinton, anybody.
[00:19:32.246 --> 00:19:35.247]  They demonize them, they bring them down, they act like, oh, you did it.
[00:19:35.287 --> 00:19:37.049]  It's more good cop, bad cop.
[00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.729]  And I predicted years ago this would happen.
[00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.930]  It always happens.
[00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.831]  It never changes.
[00:19:41.091 --> 00:19:47.595]  And now there's all this positioning where they act like this whole thing was run by two people in the White House, two cabinet members.
[00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:48.715]  They did it all!
[00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:53.378]  Total propaganda.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:03.367]  The President is a puppet, and if you don't understand that, you understand nothing!
[00:20:03.407 --> 00:20:05.609]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:07.411]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:16.458]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:19.341]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'
[00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:20.723]  's patented methodology.

[00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:19.702]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:23.064]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.344 --> 00:22:29.026]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:23:01.093 --> 00:23:04.737]  Attention drivers, poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[00:23:05.037 --> 00:23:08.340]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[00:23:08.661 --> 00:23:13.526]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:17.570]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.031]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.333]  Poor mileage and reduced performance at a time of record fuel prices.
[00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:23.294]  There is an answer.
[00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:29.698]  Protekta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.

[00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:06.701]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:11.702]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.922 --> 00:24:24.945]  Coming up in the next segment, Dr. Leonard Horowitz joining us over the bird flu and what's really behind it.
[00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.565]  Believe me, you don't want to miss this information.
[00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:29.966]  Also, Condoleezza Rice, U.S.
[00:24:30.026 --> 00:24:32.166]  may still be in Iraq in 10 years.
[00:24:33.192 --> 00:24:34.373]  Sex torture claim.
[00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:50.524]  More and more of the people, the detainees that have been freed from Guantanamo Bay say that they were raped and forced to watch sex and had blood put on them and just more satanic activities and this stuff's admitted out of Abu Ghraib and other camps in Iraq.
[00:24:50.584 --> 00:24:53.946]  It's just par for the course right out of this evil manual.
[00:24:54.427 --> 00:24:57.769]  Guantanamo hunger strikers say feeding tubes employed as torture.
[00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:59.530]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.152]  The communist Chinese do this to the Falun Gong.
[00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:15.431]  They sit there and just stick the hose down their nose, down their esophagus, over and over and over and over and over again until you start having internal bleeding.
[00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:21.814]  Or they'll overfeed you water and food until it becomes excruciatingly painful.
[00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:27.457]  And the AP reports that's exactly what's going on, classic Chinese torture.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.762]  Also, how can a civilized society allow torture?
[00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.784]  I've got to spend some time today to read part of this editorial.
[00:25:34.844 --> 00:25:37.206]  It really, really boils it down.
[00:25:37.226 --> 00:25:46.552]  And for people that have trouble dealing with evil in the world or insanity in the world, who don't want to believe it exists, there's this article, Mother Accused of Throwing Kids into the Bay.
[00:25:47.773 --> 00:25:55.238]  She threw her children, ages 6, 3, and 1, off of the bridge there in San Francisco into the bay.
[00:25:57.103 --> 00:26:01.348]  And this was witnessed, but by the time the Coast Guard got there, the children were dead.
[00:26:01.388 --> 00:26:03.991]  And she said voices were telling her to do it.
[00:26:04.612 --> 00:26:06.594]  How much money you want to bet she was on Prozac?
[00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:09.498]  That's the type of psychotic stuff people do on that stuff.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.841]  And just so much more, Dr. Horowitz is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:26:14.201 --> 00:26:21.423]  Bird flu sparking human epidemic is science fiction, says Spain's agriculture minister.
[00:26:21.443 --> 00:26:31.705]  This missing fears bird flu is sparking a global epidemic among humans as science fiction saying the virus currently only poses a threat to birds.
[00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:49.202]  But here in the next three minutes, before we go to Dr. Horowitz, I'm honored to have Debbie Morrow on with us, from New Millennium Concepts, with the big Berkey water filters, made in America, the best gravity filters out there, bar none.
[00:26:49.282 --> 00:26:51.344]  I was buying these before they were a sponsor, folks.
[00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:54.767]  And the current crisis is what's already in your water.
[00:26:55.248 --> 00:26:58.711]  The mercury, the lead, the toxins, the herbicides, the pesticides,
[00:26:59.306 --> 00:27:02.108]  What the EPA allows in the water is a crisis.
[00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:07.452]  And Debbie, you guys have got systems made right here in America that will protect people, don't you?
[00:27:07.953 --> 00:27:08.713]  Yes, we do.
[00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:16.319]  We have our Berkey water filters with the black Berkey purification elements and they'll actually take out
[00:27:16.877 --> 00:27:38.896]  The volatile organic compounds, which are things like your chlorbenzamine, chloroform, chlorine, diobicromate, you know, all these different chemicals that they're allowing in the water, we take them out to a non-detectable level.
[00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:40.758]  And, you know,
[00:27:42.048 --> 00:27:50.884]  A lot of things, even if that lady that you were just talking about turns out not to have been on Prozac, there's no telling what she's been having put into her system.
[00:27:51.707 --> 00:27:54.068]  Just from drinking regular tap water.
[00:27:54.088 --> 00:27:56.148]  Well, lead and mercury makes you go crazy.
[00:27:56.328 --> 00:27:56.568]  Yep.
[00:27:57.129 --> 00:28:02.110]  Well, and all the pills and everything that are being recycled into the water system.
[00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:02.590]  That's right.
[00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.111]  I mean, every week I see an article.
[00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:06.471]  Denver, Prozac, an entire water supply.
[00:28:06.491 --> 00:28:09.012]  Dallas, Prozac, an entire water supply.
[00:28:09.452 --> 00:28:12.153]  Austin, high levels of Prozac found in water supply.
[00:28:12.453 --> 00:28:13.513]  And that's just the Prozac.
[00:28:13.673 --> 00:28:15.554]  Then they have articles every couple days about
[00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:16.975]  We're good to go.
[00:28:34.949 --> 00:28:36.990]  Put in the food and things in the water.
[00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:43.172]  So, you know, if you get a Berkey water filter, you're taking control of what you're putting in your body.
[00:28:43.192 --> 00:28:45.473]  75% of your body, roughly, is water.
[00:28:45.493 --> 00:28:47.514]  So you're already, you know, cutting out that much.
[00:28:47.774 --> 00:28:48.855]  Folks, give Debbie a call.
[00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:50.455]  We've got some huge specials right now.
[00:28:50.816 --> 00:28:52.336]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:54.717]  You save massive amounts of money.
[00:28:54.757 --> 00:28:55.838]  They are the manufacturer.
[00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:57.098]  They are the distributor.
[00:28:57.138 --> 00:28:58.559]  You're getting these at the price.
[00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:09.828]  Uh, the people who buy hundreds of these as distributors get it, because as this audience buys so many of these, you get a low price, basically, is what's happening.
[00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:18.976]  Give Debbie a call right now, 1-888-803-4438, and they'll give you a couple different free gifts depending on the package you get.
[00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:19.036]  1-888-8838.

[00:29:35.181 --> 00:29:38.301]  That number, 888-803-4438.
[00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:39.981]  Debbie, we're out of time.
[00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:40.962]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:29:41.362 --> 00:29:41.562]  Bye.
[00:29:41.922 --> 00:29:42.462]  Thanks a lot.
[00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:44.182]  Folks, give her a call right now.
[00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:44.242]  888-803-4438.
[00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.323]  Protect yourselves and your family.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.527]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.449 --> 00:29:58.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:10.358]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[00:30:10.378 --> 00:30:14.981]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:19.264]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:30:19.625 --> 00:30:24.648]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:30:25.068 --> 00:30:28.851]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:29.752]  We're good to go!
[00:30:53.567 --> 00:30:56.669]  Call 1-800-845-3841 to learn more.
[00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.731]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:04.996]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.356 --> 00:31:14.182]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.482 --> 00:31:19.166]  That's because it can purify raw untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.626 --> 00:31:26.350]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:38.557]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:39.017 --> 00:31:43.461]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:43.641 --> 00:31:46.103]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:47.964 --> 00:31:49.225]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.245 --> 00:31:50.706]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:51.787]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:02.597]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:02.758 --> 00:32:03.878]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:07.481]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:08.002]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.342 --> 00:32:15.468]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:19.871]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:20.412]  Fragrance?
[00:32:20.792 --> 00:32:25.535]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:30.359]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:33.141]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:36.823]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:36.963 --> 00:32:40.466]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:40.706 --> 00:32:43.088]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:44.109]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:53.977]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:33:19.846 --> 00:33:32.496]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight blasting out on the AM and FM dial a growing list of wonderful, brave, powerful, freedom-loving AM and FM affiliates.
[00:33:33.687 --> 00:33:40.949]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave on WWCR, three hours during the day and three hours at night from nine to midnight.
[00:33:41.449 --> 00:33:48.731]  Going out on dozens and dozens and dozens of micro-FMs known as Evil Pirates by some of the mainstream media outfits.
[00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:56.553]  And also on the internet at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:07.001]  We're going to be going to Dr. Lynn Horowitz here in just about 60 seconds, but I do want to encourage all of you out there.
[00:34:07.061 --> 00:34:08.602]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:34:08.942 --> 00:34:19.564]  To get my new documentary film, a mini-series, three films in one, Martial Law is part one, then there's 9-11, Rise of the Police State, three different parts.
[00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:22.664]  It is the most comprehensive 9-11 film out there.
[00:34:22.684 --> 00:34:27.445]  It proves the globalists carried it out, documents how they did it and why they did it.
[00:34:28.263 --> 00:34:35.906]  We show the police state, they're setting up to enslave us, and we also show them the literal Nazi death cult that controls it.
[00:34:36.246 --> 00:34:44.989]  We go back to Hitler, and show the connection with the Bushes, and then to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and just all of it, the Thule Society, the Fool Society.
[00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:49.490]  It is such an important film, it needs to be seen.
[00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:54.612]  It's $25.95, get a second copy for $19.95, down to $14 when you buy a couple more copies apiece.
[00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.713]  Then you have my film, American Dictators.
[00:34:56.753 --> 00:34:57.933]  Get one copy of that for $19.95.
[00:34:58.773 --> 00:35:02.075]  Each additional copy $5.95 on DVD.
[00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:03.075]  Why is that?
[00:35:03.135 --> 00:35:04.675]  Because I want people to see it.
[00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.176]  Give it as a birthday gift.
[00:35:06.216 --> 00:35:06.956]  Give it at Christmas.
[00:35:07.256 --> 00:35:08.057]  Give it at Hanukkah.
[00:35:08.097 --> 00:35:09.097]  Give it whenever.
[00:35:09.397 --> 00:35:10.538]  Just give it to people.
[00:35:11.198 --> 00:35:17.400]  And, you know, you're authorized to make copies of my films, but a lot of folks who give them a copy of a VHS or a DVD, they won't watch it.
[00:35:18.248 --> 00:35:25.254]  If it's got a nice color cover, and shrink-wrapped, and you know, got the imprint and color on top of the DVD, they're more apt to watch it.
[00:35:26.335 --> 00:35:28.437]  We've got a bunch of new deals we've launched today.
[00:35:28.457 --> 00:35:33.581]  You can get every film I've made, and my book, for basically about half off.
[00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:34.742]  Just go check it out.
[00:35:35.062 --> 00:35:37.544]  We have a 3 DVD special for $45.
[00:35:37.745 --> 00:35:43.910]  I mean, they're normally $25.95, so you're literally looking at, I don't know, how much is that?
[00:35:44.394 --> 00:35:45.535]  30-40 bucks off.
[00:35:46.055 --> 00:35:48.076]  A bunch of new specials we launched today.
[00:35:48.116 --> 00:35:51.938]  The lowest prices ever, because I want to get this information out to people.
[00:35:52.178 --> 00:35:53.879]  Here's the toll-free number to call and order.
[00:35:53.899 --> 00:35:53.959]  1-888-253-3139
[00:36:00.342 --> 00:36:05.184]  Or go to InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:36:05.224 --> 00:36:06.704]  That's InfoWars.com.
[00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:10.106]  Or simply go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:10.466 --> 00:36:11.466]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:36:11.506 --> 00:36:13.647]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:36:13.667 --> 00:36:17.268]  You get three months free if you get a yearly subscription, but it's $5.95 a month.
[00:36:17.688 --> 00:36:18.869]  All twelve of my films.
[00:36:19.449 --> 00:36:30.291]  Hundreds of special weekly TV reports, classic TV shows I did years ago, all of my best audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, and the films we've been authorized to post.
[00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:31.691]  It's a ridiculous deal.
[00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.512]  You can download and burn copies.
[00:36:33.672 --> 00:36:35.852]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:36.212 --> 00:36:37.592]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:37.892 --> 00:36:44.593]  Please take action and support us because we're on the front lines of the fight against this New World Order, Antichrist beast system.
[00:36:44.633 --> 00:36:47.334]  Now, the individual you're about to hear,
[00:36:48.402 --> 00:36:48.662]  Yes.
[00:36:49.003 --> 00:36:50.264]  I consider him a really good friend of mine.
[00:36:50.304 --> 00:36:52.907]  I've met him at a few expos years and years ago.
[00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:55.910]  We're talking six, seven, eight years ago, but I've talked to him many times on air.
[00:36:56.951 --> 00:37:01.736]  He, of course, has a very important medical clinic out in Hawaii.
[00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:05.039]  He also has a home and an operation up in Idaho.
[00:37:06.161 --> 00:37:09.524]  He is just, everything he's talked about is so well documented.
[00:37:09.784 --> 00:37:14.968]  He's been a trailblazer exposing AIDS as a bio-weapon, a trailblazer digging up these documents.
[00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:21.154]  He backs up everything he says, and he has literally saved millions of lives.
[00:37:21.634 --> 00:37:24.597]  I mean, 10 years ago, you told people not to take vaccines, they'd laugh at you.
[00:37:24.897 --> 00:37:38.008]  Now I talk to medical doctors here in Austin, mainly at the upscale hospitals and clinics, at the lower class areas, unfortunately they don't know and 90% of them are still taking the shots, but at the more upscale hospitals,
[00:37:38.448 --> 00:37:50.313]  Over half the parents aren't giving their kids vaccines, over half the adults refuse them now, and those numbers are radically going in that direction where we're going to see 60, 70, 80 percent very soon.
[00:37:50.753 --> 00:37:52.934]  We've already hit that tipping point.
[00:37:53.174 --> 00:37:59.596]  And so for the next hour we're joined by Dr. Lynn Horowitz to talk about what's really behind this bird flu, but first the history of this
[00:38:00.076 --> 00:38:03.259]  He's got a bunch of different websites that cover different topics.
[00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:07.142]  He's a best-selling author, and you need to support him and get his materials.
[00:38:07.662 --> 00:38:09.504]  Dr. Horowitz, honored to have you on with us.
[00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:11.205]  Always a pleasure to join you, Alex.
[00:38:12.246 --> 00:38:16.429]  So much has happened, so much of what you warned is now unfolding.
[00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:28.759]  Tell us, in a nutshell, for those that don't know who you are, a lot of new affiliates out there, about yourself, how you woke up, and then what these vaccines really are, and how that ties in to this bird flu hysteria.
[00:38:29.796 --> 00:38:31.437]  Well, just a brief background.
[00:38:31.757 --> 00:38:36.919]  I have a Harvard Master's in Public Health degree and I have a doctorate in medical dentistry.
[00:38:36.959 --> 00:38:43.662]  I was a clinician in dental practice overseeing a multidisciplinary health center for 16 years.
[00:38:45.743 --> 00:38:48.064]  In 1990, I fell into my first government cover-up.
[00:38:48.084 --> 00:38:51.626]  There was a case of a Florida dentist that infected his patients with the AIDS virus.
[00:38:52.347 --> 00:39:07.917]  And I became the chief investigator of the murder theory in the case and ultimately came out with my ninth book which was called Deadly Innocence and the scientific reports showing that the government was covering up the truth about that dentist and the way he injected his patients with the AIDS virus.
[00:39:08.618 --> 00:39:21.987]  Subsequent to that I spent three years investigating the man-made thesis on the origin of AIDS and found the United States government contracts and reprinted the contracts under which numerous AIDS-like and Ebola-like viruses were bioengineered
[00:39:22.507 --> 00:39:45.677]  By the Army's sixth top biological weapons contracting lab, and then I determined scientifically that the hepatitis B vaccine given to gay men in New York City and blacks in Central Africa that was prepared in contaminated chimpanzees shipped from Africa to the Merck Pharmaceutical Company was what triggered the international AIDS pandemic.
[00:39:46.098 --> 00:39:51.160]  And that became my national best-selling book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola, along with the contracts.
[00:39:51.943 --> 00:40:06.696]  So, with regard to the emerging diseases, I've tried to do my best to keep up with what's really going on behind the closed doors and the revolving doors between Central Intelligence and the White House and the pharmaceutical cartel.
[00:40:07.396 --> 00:40:30.874]  And that everything from the anthrax mailings to the West Nile virus scam, we've been on top of it, and helping people to realize that they need not get vaccinated, that there are alternatives, and the basic propaganda manipulation, the fright campaigns, is really a psychological operation that, like you, have been telling folks about for many, many years, Alex.
[00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:36.478]  Well, Dr. Horowitz, let's go over some of the history of vaccines.
[00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:43.207]  And your discoveries, and what's in them, and why they want to push it on us so badly.
[00:40:43.227 --> 00:40:49.452]  You know, what the world view is of these social Darwinist, Malthusian individuals.
[00:40:49.612 --> 00:40:55.376]  And then, I want to connect it in, as I heard you do on another broadcast with Jack McClam a few weeks ago.
[00:40:55.396 --> 00:40:58.959]  I want to connect it in with this current bird flu hysteria.
[00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:06.985]  And of course, the same characters, Donald Rumsfeld, set to make about $5 billion off of this flu pill they're selling out of Canada.
[00:41:08.105 --> 00:41:10.028]  Okay, that's a great agenda.
[00:41:10.608 --> 00:41:12.050]  Very, very helpful to the public.
[00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:14.008]  Genocidal weapon.
[00:41:14.048 --> 00:41:15.788]  That's exactly what vaccines are.
[00:41:15.968 --> 00:41:18.269]  It is the principal genocidal weapon.
[00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:27.133]  Genocide is defined in Webster's as the mass killing, enslaving, or poisoning of populations for economics, politics, and or ideology.
[00:41:27.714 --> 00:41:40.099]  The people that are in charge of the petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel that we call actually the military medical petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel have a desire to reduce at least half of the world's population.
[00:41:40.694 --> 00:41:54.823]  The best way to accomplish that is slowly by lethal injection and contaminated blood supplies which cause chronic diseases for which pharmaceuticals enslave people economically and physically.
[00:41:55.583 --> 00:42:05.169]  So the vaccines, what is in them that causes that to be the premier genocidal weapon is that the
[00:42:06.284 --> 00:42:09.046]  Mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde and formalin.
[00:42:09.066 --> 00:42:10.747]  These are not the active ingredients.
[00:42:10.907 --> 00:42:13.849]  These are the stabilizers and sterilizers.
[00:42:14.249 --> 00:42:16.230]  They wreak havoc with the immune system.
[00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:26.316]  They also wreak havoc with the neurological nervous system that is associated with the autistic spectrum disorders, the skyrocketing rates in our children.
[00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:27.729]  We've seen that.
[00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:30.231]  We've seen Alzheimer's linked to aluminum.
[00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:32.272]  Now, skyrocketing rates of this.
[00:42:32.832 --> 00:42:39.195]  Of course, there's other exposures to aluminum, but the primary source to our children is in the vaccinations with mercury.
[00:42:39.796 --> 00:42:43.738]  You have formaldehyde, formalin, things you preserve corpses with.
[00:42:44.198 --> 00:42:53.443]  Now, the active ingredients are the foreign proteins, proteins from bacteria, viruses, fungus, yeast.
[00:42:54.485 --> 00:43:02.119]  Chicken embryo, bovine fetal serum, monkey kidney tissues, and with smallpox vaccine, you're really looking at cow pus.
[00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:07.571]  You know, you might as well add Eye of Newt, because that's essentially what these vaccines are.
[00:43:07.591 --> 00:43:08.512]  It's a witch's brew.
[00:43:09.032 --> 00:43:17.014]  And that, in fact, the scientists themselves, and the physicians certainly, don't know what all the contaminants are.
[00:43:17.454 --> 00:43:24.916]  What we do know, science has proven, is that when you get injected with these foreign proteins from various other sources and species,
[00:43:25.792 --> 00:43:30.055]  It causes what's called an antigenic complex to form in your own body.
[00:43:30.495 --> 00:43:42.843]  That is, let's say, half of your own protein particle connected to a foreign protein particle, that now your immune system recognizes the entire complex, including your own body parts, as foreign.
[00:43:43.243 --> 00:43:47.906]  And it mounts an autoimmune reaction against your own body that we call autoimmunity.
[00:43:48.426 --> 00:44:01.245]  So now what you've got is a whole new array of plagues brought on by the vaccinations that have induced economic and physical slavery to pharmaceuticals through chronic diseases.
[00:44:01.345 --> 00:44:02.988]  Well, let's boil this down for people.
[00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:06.314]  And we have the documents.
[00:44:06.334 --> 00:44:06.954]  This is stated.
[00:44:07.174 --> 00:44:09.956]  They want to reduce the world population conservatively by half.
[00:44:09.976 --> 00:44:11.257]  But Prince Philip says 80.
[00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:14.419]  Ted Turner says 95% in major publications.
[00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:21.363]  Every time I talk about this, sickos send me emails, usually professors, going, well, what are we going to do, Alex?
[00:44:21.383 --> 00:44:22.483]  We've got to get rid of people.
[00:44:22.523 --> 00:44:24.905]  So there's this academic admission.
[00:44:25.385 --> 00:44:28.847]  The Peter Singer at Princeton
[00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:38.290]  Dehumanization model, and really it's just the excuse for total consolidation, total enslavement, so they can act like they're doing this for humanitarian purposes.
[00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:47.536]  But while they're busy killing us, when they kill us, they transfer most of the person's lifelong savings and wealth into their hands.
[00:44:47.576 --> 00:44:57.923]  So it's not like they're just killing you, they're also robbing you of all of your wealth while they do it through a treatment system designed to not deal with the root cause, but to just treat the illness.
[00:44:58.363 --> 00:45:00.025]  Is that an accurate statement?
[00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:01.386]  Absolutely.
[00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:24.446]  And the diseases that your friends and family and mine are dying from now, slowly but surely, these include chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, lupus, MS, ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, chronic crippling rheumatoid arthritis, adult and juvenile type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, Guillain-Barre, Stephen Johnson syndrome, Bell's palsy, all of these are vaccine-linked.
[00:45:25.186 --> 00:45:46.918]  Well, Dr. Horowitz, I have a friend who just had a large portion of his intestine removed with Crohn's, and then months after the surgery, he's having problems again.
[00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:53.842]  And I have read, not just from what you have documented, but even in mainstream literature that never gets newspaper coverage,
[00:45:54.938 --> 00:45:55.638]  Absolutely.
[00:45:55.658 --> 00:45:56.259]  That's accurate, Alex.
[00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:13.188]  I think so.
[00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:34.656]  We're good to go!
[00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:54.541]  That's a good question.
[00:47:16.528 --> 00:47:17.229]  I think so, yes.
[00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.889]  Thank you!
[00:47:55.147 --> 00:47:55.788]  We're good to go.
[00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:21.348]  We recommend the Devil's Club and the two Rosacea plants, along with the Black Elderberry.
[00:48:21.749 --> 00:48:22.950]  It's really powerful.
[00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.853]  We've been seeing a lot of excellent success with this flu.
[00:48:25.873 --> 00:48:29.498]  Well, even medical doctors have been listing some of the things you just listed, Doctor.
[00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:46.666]  I mean, you come from the whole MD grouping yourself, but even other doctors who are with Western Medicine are admitting that some of the things you just mentioned have the exact co-factors that are in this $7 a pill junk Rumsfeld's pushing.
[00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:49.728]  Yeah, well, I would not take any medicines.
[00:48:49.788 --> 00:48:56.671]  I'll tell you, popping magic pills to cure every ill that they throw at us is not my way of living.
[00:48:56.711 --> 00:48:57.772]  That's my way of dying.
[00:48:57.792 --> 00:49:01.674]  Tell us, before we go any further, Dr. Horowitz, about some of your websites.
[00:49:02.528 --> 00:49:06.531]  Well, DrLen Horowitz.com is my official website.
[00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:16.638]  There is HealthyWorldDistributing.com, which has all the books and tapes and the health care products and equipment that I've been recommending.
[00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:23.883]  There is HealingCelebrations.com, which gives you the five-step approach and summary that I just gave you.
[00:49:23.903 --> 00:49:25.064]  There's also Tetrahedron.
[00:49:25.684 --> 00:49:25.964]  Right.
[00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:34.067]  The tetrahedron.org is a great website for looking at the old archives and infectious diseases.
[00:49:34.787 --> 00:49:36.168]  I was on there a couple weeks ago.
[00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:41.969]  You've got all the actual documents and just incredible research for folks that want to really see the proof in the pudding.
[00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.190]  That's the place to go.
[00:49:44.012 --> 00:49:44.753]  Well, thanks Alex.
[00:49:45.173 --> 00:49:55.480]  And then the Origin of AIDS, if you want the slam-dunk science proving that this is a man-made, hepatitis B-induced tragedy, go to OriginofAIDS.com.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.304]  OriginofAIDS.com and then Petrohedron.org and just a lot of others.
[00:50:00.344 --> 00:50:03.506]  And we'll tell folks about that before you leave us here in about 40 minutes.
[00:50:03.946 --> 00:50:10.069]  And we will take a few calls in the next hour if they're directly for Dr. Horowitz on the bird flu situation.
[00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:10.329]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:18.394]  Dr. Horowitz, I want to talk about their master plan and how they're carrying this out, but let's get into the bird flu.
[00:50:18.414 --> 00:50:22.876]  You know, we have a lot of scientists and doctors saying it's a fraud, but they don't get the attention.
[00:50:23.276 --> 00:50:30.400]  Meanwhile, we've got these people out there fear-mongering, saying it's the end of the world, martial law will save you, government will save you.
[00:50:31.357 --> 00:50:35.899]  They tried this with a smallpox, but nobody bought it, so they had to suspend that program.
[00:50:35.939 --> 00:50:38.380]  Now they've moved on to SARS and avian flu.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.802]  So we'll talk about it with Dr. Len Horowitz on the other side of this quick break.
[00:50:42.862 --> 00:50:48.484]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and you do not want to miss this information that's coming up.
[00:50:48.904 --> 00:50:51.285]  And we're going to talk more about vaccines as well.
[00:50:51.786 --> 00:50:52.186]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.306 --> 00:51:02.807]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.007 --> 00:51:06.089]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:10.132]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:14.414]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.754 --> 00:51:18.537]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.657 --> 00:51:20.398]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.638 --> 00:51:23.961]  Riot police attack people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.161 --> 00:51:28.704]  Medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:31.927]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.107 --> 00:51:34.969]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.449 --> 00:51:41.574]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.094 --> 00:51:45.896]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:19.724 --> 00:52:23.168]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:52:23.488 --> 00:52:32.832]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:52:33.092 --> 00:52:36.593]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:52:36.834 --> 00:52:43.956]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:19.702]  We're going to get into the avian flu, and what a giant fraud it is, and how these problem reaction solution scans work with Dr. Horowitz.
[00:54:21.043 --> 00:54:22.845]  But there's two points I want to bring up that are blaring.
[00:54:23.586 --> 00:54:28.751]  All over the country, because I've seen the reports online from the TV stations,
[00:54:29.617 --> 00:54:35.180]  And I watch it on TV here locally in Austin, right before school, a month before the drumbeat begins.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.823]  Exact same article, exact same statements, all over the country, just different talking heads.
[00:54:40.163 --> 00:54:42.464]  ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:43.084 --> 00:54:43.865]  It's the law.
[00:54:43.965 --> 00:54:46.806]  Vaccinate your children or they'll be truant and you'll be arrested.
[00:54:47.266 --> 00:54:48.767]  Vaccines keep your children safe.
[00:54:48.847 --> 00:54:49.908]  Vaccines are good.
[00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:54.142]  There's a mass clinic at Joker Park tomorrow.
[00:54:54.422 --> 00:54:55.103]  It's the law.
[00:54:55.143 --> 00:54:55.783]  You'll be arrested.
[00:54:56.063 --> 00:54:57.163]  There is no law.
[00:54:57.183 --> 00:55:04.066]  We had to get a law passed two years ago in Texas saying that CPS can't take kids for not taking it because there is no law.
[00:55:04.326 --> 00:55:06.647]  We have to get laws passed saying you're breaking the law.
[00:55:07.608 --> 00:55:08.008]  They are.
[00:55:08.068 --> 00:55:08.688]  The government is.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:22.544]  And then they'll also get on the news and say, we've taken the mercury out, we've taken the mercury out, but then I have AP articles admitting that in most of the major vaccines, they've gone from 50 times unsafe levels to 250 times in the flu shot and hepatitis and MMR.
[00:55:22.824 --> 00:55:23.965]  They've actually increased it.
[00:55:23.985 --> 00:55:34.128]  What they've done is made a few vaccines available that cost three or four times the price, that if clinics want to special order them, you might be able to get them.
[00:55:34.988 --> 00:55:48.296]  Now, I want to get Dr. Horowitz's take on this blasphemy of lying and saying you've got to do something that isn't a law, just to show the magnitude of the lies, and then on top of that, how they've actually increased the mercury.
[00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:50.842]  You're absolutely right.
[00:55:50.902 --> 00:55:57.768]  Again, Alex, it's unfortunate that you cannot trust your government at all to tell you the truth, particularly in life-saving issues such as this.
[00:55:58.428 --> 00:56:01.571]  Vaccinations, their exemptions are available.
[00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:02.712]  They don't tell you.
[00:56:02.812 --> 00:56:10.419]  Legislatively, in virtually every state, you have the ability to opt out for religious reasons.
[00:56:11.059 --> 00:56:11.939]  I think so, yes.
[00:56:26.805 --> 00:56:43.220]  And most states have their own statutes which require the public health officials, if you demand, you've got to be assertive, you've got to demand your religious exemption, and then they have to give you, by law, an exemption form to fill out.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.122]  Now that's what we've been recommending for years.
[00:56:45.142 --> 00:56:48.685]  Well, most states now have a conscientious or just an objection form.
[00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:50.386]  Like California has.
[00:56:50.446 --> 00:56:57.608]  Philosophical exemptions are available in some states, but across the board, just about everywhere, you have a religious exemption.
[00:56:58.429 --> 00:57:02.891]  Now, you know, Leviticus 19.19 says to keep the blood pure is to keep the seed from being mixed.
[00:57:03.291 --> 00:57:09.933]  That's not what you do when you inject your cells with foreign RNA, foreign DNA, from bacteria, virus, fungus, and so on.
[00:57:11.654 --> 00:57:14.555]  So you've got to follow the religious exemption.
[00:57:14.575 --> 00:57:16.216]  You've got to assertively demand it.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:24.744]  If the public health professionals and the school administrators say to you, no, your children have to get this, you say to them, listen, I know you're lying.
[00:57:25.264 --> 00:57:31.667]  The fact is that you should have in your desk drawn, if you don't have it, you're in violation of state statutes.
[00:57:31.687 --> 00:57:37.490]  You better go to the public health department and get me the vaccine waiver exemption form because I want to sign it right now.
[00:57:39.093 --> 00:57:44.979]  And back ten years ago when you were telling people that, I mean, you even at the hospital had to deal with this yourself with your children.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:50.265]  Now, because of trailblazers like yourself, at most hospitals and most schools, they back off.
[00:57:50.285 --> 00:57:52.908]  You want to, briefly in the next minute, tell the story of what happened to you?
[00:57:53.732 --> 00:57:55.413]  Oh, well, I learned the hard way.
[00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:59.854]  We lost custody of our little baby girl, Aria, for three days.
[00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:02.175]  We lived in absolute nightmarish hell.
[00:58:02.735 --> 00:58:18.181]  You know, because Social Services Department of New York alleged that even though I was a public health professional, we had abused our child by having brought her into the hospital for a broken arm and neglected our children for lacking their vaccinations.
[00:58:18.782 --> 00:58:22.143]  So, that's how I learned the lessons the hard way.
[00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:25.285]  Well, I mean, this is the modern America.
[00:58:25.305 --> 00:58:30.346]  It's like my mother fell out of a tree and broke her arm, and when she went to the hospital, they didn't try to grab her.
[00:58:31.006 --> 00:58:32.187]  It's just sick, folks.
[00:58:32.367 --> 00:58:32.767]  Totally.
[00:58:33.007 --> 00:58:34.267]  It's totally sick.
[00:58:35.028 --> 00:58:38.029]  We'll be right back with Dr. Len Horowitz to detail the bird flu.
[00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:46.391]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:57.969]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:59.710]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:01.530]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.970]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.751 --> 00:59:05.651]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:08.952]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.472 --> 00:59:13.613]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.193 --> 00:59:22.194]  Already into hour number two, Colonel Greg Roberts will be joining us to talk about impending martial law in America.
[00:59:22.214 --> 00:59:25.355]  We had Ron Paul on last week.
[00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:29.829]  And he said that the government is preparing for gun confiscation and martial law.
[00:59:30.509 --> 00:59:41.916]  That's Ron Paul, Congressman, and we had, of course, Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Analyst for Ronald Reagan and Bush 41, saying the government's gearing up for that and may carry out terror attacks.
[00:59:42.616 --> 00:59:47.419]  I tell you, Dr. Lynn Horowitz, you helped expose government involvement.
[00:59:47.439 --> 00:59:53.562]  I mean, you just do so much original research in the anthrax attacks, and you got harassed by the FBI for that.
[00:59:54.163 --> 00:59:54.783]  But, uh,
[00:59:55.979 --> 01:00:03.703]  But now it seems like what we've been warning people about for so many years, really, I think the worm has turned and is becoming mainstream.
[01:00:03.723 --> 01:00:04.383]  Have you seen that?
[01:00:04.803 --> 01:00:05.444]  Yes, indeed.
[01:00:05.484 --> 01:00:15.709]  People are really awake and aware now that something's missing and they're searching for the information and that's why it's, you know, we've been doing this for years and now finally it's being respected.
[01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:22.012]  Well, I mean, look, you're more of a trailblazer than I. You've been doing this for many years longer than I have.
[01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.032]  I got involved in the mid-1990s, but
[01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:28.763]  Dr. Horowitz, we're still out of the woods, yet these guys aren't backing off.
[01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:30.964]  They're talking about taking Bush out of office right now.
[01:00:31.004 --> 01:00:41.187]  Well, the globalists always remove their minions when a revolution is brewing to kind of salve it so the public thinks that everything's okay and, oh see, the right has been done.
[01:00:41.467 --> 01:00:50.670]  Let's talk about the powerful individuals and families, the Rockefellers and others, that are behind this big complex that you talk about and what this bird flu really is.
[01:00:51.807 --> 01:00:53.369]  Well, the bird flu is a scam.
[01:00:53.409 --> 01:00:59.277]  It's a psychological operation intended to move people into the slaughterhouses, the vaccine lines.
[01:00:59.975 --> 01:01:02.016]  And the quarantine concentration camps.
[01:01:02.656 --> 01:01:07.357]  And that the Rockefeller family has been at the forefront of American medicine, American public health.
[01:01:07.377 --> 01:01:09.657]  They monopolized both by the early 1920s.
[01:01:09.717 --> 01:01:16.499]  The cancer industry, the cartel, pharmaceutical in America is directed by the Rockefellers.
[01:01:16.859 --> 01:01:25.741]  They're the reason why we have had all of the alternative healthcare professionals ostracized, alienated, the chiropractors, the homeopaths.
[01:01:26.301 --> 01:01:29.382]  All of that is because of primarily the Rockefeller family.
[01:01:31.648 --> 01:01:34.069]  And, I mean, you've written books about this.
[01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:37.071]  They slowly but surely bought up all the industries.
[01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.792]  They bought up the newspapers.
[01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:43.695]  They bought up, with endowments, the hospitals and the universities, the medical schools.
[01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:47.977]  How does something like the bird flu tie into their larger plan?
[01:01:48.947 --> 01:01:54.972]  Well, they've been looking for an excuse to vaccinate people to induce the genocide.
[01:01:55.412 --> 01:02:04.078]  Again, we've talked about how varying levels of population reduction from 50 to 80% have been articulated.
[01:02:04.378 --> 01:02:16.490]  The premier organization that has been advancing the depopulation agenda is the Population Council of the City of New York, put together by the Rockefellers, the Rockefeller Brothers, decades ago.
[01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:21.916]  And they have been publishing even in the mainstream press in recent years.
[01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:29.698]  I remember Harper's a couple years ago had a full-page ad that originally ran in the Council of Foreign Relations Directed Foreign Affairs Journal.
[01:02:30.098 --> 01:02:40.662]  The most esteemed political periodical in the world published a full-page ad to call for the United States population to be reduced from 275 million down to about 125 to 145 million.
[01:02:40.682 --> 01:02:41.462]  So that's more than half.
[01:02:46.104 --> 01:02:47.446]  And it was urgent, they said.
[01:02:48.027 --> 01:02:57.921]  You know, but the truth of the matter is that the only urgencies in the environmental degradation concerned with population explosion, it's all by manipulation.
[01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:01.546]  The petrochemical energy industrialists.
[01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:12.931]  These people have been directing everything from the suppression of alternative energy resources, free energy, to the... Well, it's all designed to be predatory to wreak havoc.
[01:03:13.191 --> 01:03:14.232]  Exactly right.
[01:03:14.352 --> 01:03:23.796]  And that the population is being controlled every which way possible, and now these folks have decided to kill one out of every two of you people listening to this conversation.
[01:03:23.996 --> 01:03:26.458]  They run full... I mean, that's the incredible thing, Dr. Horowitz.
[01:03:26.798 --> 01:03:28.178]  They run full-page ads.
[01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:29.239]  They have periodicals.
[01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:30.760]  They tell people this.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.021]  You post it on your site.
[01:03:32.321 --> 01:03:33.322]  I make films about it.
[01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:35.904]  And the average person still can't believe it.
[01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.926]  They're saying, we're going to kill you!
[01:03:37.946 --> 01:03:40.228]  And people are going, I love the government.
[01:03:40.428 --> 01:03:43.591]  We'll be right back, Dr. Horowitz.
[01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.413]  We'll specifically get into your incredible article.
[01:03:46.834 --> 01:03:51.118]  Dr. Glenn Horowitz debunks avian flu hysteria campaign and much more.
[01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:51.658]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:57.083]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.343 --> 01:03:58.904]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:10.992]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.332 --> 01:04:13.313]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:16.354]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:21.115]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:25.737]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:25.957 --> 01:04:33.179]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:06:03.934 --> 01:06:05.454]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:06:05.514 --> 01:06:07.755]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:06:07.935 --> 01:06:11.416]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?

[01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:03.187]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.928 --> 01:07:05.468]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.508 --> 01:07:09.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:13.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:20.872]  Eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into this second hour, second segment.
[01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:24.473]  Dr. Horowitz with us for about another twenty-two minutes or so.
[01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:31.086]  We're going to take a few calls for the doctor on the avian flu issue or the vaccine issue.
[01:07:31.106 --> 01:07:31.386]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:31.406 --> 01:07:37.648]  We'll take a few of your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:38.769 --> 01:07:41.870]  Dr. Horowitz, you've got a detailed essay here you've written.
[01:07:43.011 --> 01:07:46.012]  Dr. Lynn Horowitz debunks avian flu hysteria campaign.
[01:07:46.412 --> 01:07:47.613]  You go into the abstract.
[01:07:48.214 --> 01:07:54.962]  What we've seen them do in the past, the background with SARS as a social experiment, how they may even poison us through the vaccine itself.
[01:07:55.542 --> 01:08:08.878]  But I remember you decrying when they tried to order 14 million first responders, doctors, nurses, cops, firemen, school teachers, everybody basically in the bureaucracy to take the
[01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:17.171]  Smallpox vaccine, but then all these epidemiologists and virologists came out, mainstream people, and said, look, this will actually spread smallpox.
[01:08:17.351 --> 01:08:19.053]  This doesn't protect us from smallpox.
[01:08:19.253 --> 01:08:21.094]  This doesn't protect us from weaponized smallpox.
[01:08:21.775 --> 01:08:24.436]  This is only in a lab in Russia and the U.S.
[01:08:24.597 --> 01:08:26.018]  Why are you wanting us to do this?
[01:08:26.838 --> 01:08:34.541]  They were going to release it, and then of course the federal documents show it, and then force us into compact cities, and use it as a model of martial law.
[01:08:34.581 --> 01:08:35.182]  We know that.
[01:08:35.222 --> 01:08:37.783]  You documented that, and many others have documented that.
[01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:39.304]  So that failed.
[01:08:39.344 --> 01:08:40.384]  Then they had SARS.
[01:08:40.844 --> 01:08:42.265]  That didn't work like they wanted it to.
[01:08:42.305 --> 01:08:45.426]  So now they've moved on to this, and they're saying it will happen.
[01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:48.788]  Meanwhile, we've got things like this out of the French news agency.
[01:08:48.828 --> 01:08:51.849]  Bird flu sparking human epidemic is science fiction.
[01:08:51.909 --> 01:08:53.750]  Spain's agriculture minister dismissed
[01:08:54.270 --> 01:09:07.109]  Fears bird flu sparking a global epidemic among humans is science fiction saying the virus currently only poses a threat to birds and then they admit that they haven't even proven these 65 people have died from this specific virus.
[01:09:07.129 --> 01:09:08.832]  They just say that they might have.
[01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:09.533]  Dr. Horowitz?
[01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.170]  Well, that's exactly it.
[01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:26.397]  The flights are being used to drive economic agendas, and that ultimately, if they're telling you a bird flu is coming, and it's obvious that it's not, there's got to be another political agenda that's unfolding before our eyes that we're not seeing because we're distracted.
[01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:28.398]  And that's precisely what they're doing.
[01:09:29.777 --> 01:09:40.646]  Fried has been pushing not only recently a $10 billion purchase of vaccines by the Bush camp that of course they're on the payoff inside between the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:09:40.906 --> 01:09:58.841]  They even tell you right now there's a BioShield 2 that just passed committee in Senate that they're pushing for by the end of the year the Senate to pass the legislation that virtually has the same effect as the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act on a national basis.
[01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:10.910]  Again, the ability to arrest the Constitution of the United States, as well as the states, and demand people get injected, infected, intoxicated by the will of a public health authority.
[01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:16.655]  Again, it's exactly what it is that you've been telling people, Alex, on your program consistently.
[01:10:16.715 --> 01:10:24.421]  There is an agenda to enslave the American people, to intoxicate them, and to kill at least half of them off.
[01:10:25.061 --> 01:10:36.024]  And every maneuver, every government-sponsored terror attack, every new program is about getting us straitjacketed, getting us in compact cities so they can have their way with us.
[01:10:36.084 --> 01:10:38.484]  This is their stated agenda.
[01:10:38.504 --> 01:10:51.387]  As Dr. Horowitz said in the last segment, they run full-page ads and articles in Harper's and in Foreign Affairs, the most prestigious political journal, saying they're going to do this to you, laughing at you.
[01:10:52.287 --> 01:10:54.248]  And look, I had Ron Paul on last week and I said,
[01:10:55.197 --> 01:10:56.138]  You know, there's a hurricane.
[01:10:56.158 --> 01:10:57.200]  We need martial law.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.682]  There's a threat of terrorism.
[01:10:58.722 --> 01:10:59.543]  We need martial law.
[01:10:59.863 --> 01:11:00.984]  Oh, bird flu's gonna get you.
[01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:01.886]  We need martial law.
[01:11:02.506 --> 01:11:03.708]  Everything's martial law.
[01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:12.379]  What is it they've got planned here with the signpost up ahead, Dr. Horowitz, that they know they're gonna need to have as condition to accept total martial law?
[01:11:13.139 --> 01:11:15.100]  Well, again, it's the Nazi America.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.761]  It's the same old, same old.
[01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:21.423]  You know, you tell a lie long enough eventually to be believed as truth, and the greater the lie, the more people believe it.
[01:11:21.603 --> 01:11:33.409]  They believe that the bird flu is going to come get them, so they line up in the concentration camps, the hospitals, and the health care centers, get their injection, and then they will get sick, and then they will die.
[01:11:34.085 --> 01:11:38.046]  And so people, if you're listening out there, simply tell everyone you know.
[01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:40.987]  And then it's all kept, then it's all kept real quiet.
[01:11:41.327 --> 01:11:43.628]  Oh, autism's up by a couple thousand percent.
[01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:45.889]  Oh, cancer's up by five hundred percent.
[01:11:46.289 --> 01:11:51.211]  Oh, suddenly all these, and oh, it's always correlated to the vaccines, but let's just ignore that.
[01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:51.851]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:52.871]  Yeah, right.
[01:11:53.151 --> 01:12:20.897]  Let's turn our focus up on the herbs and the botanicals that are helping a massive amount of people, but if somebody overdoses, I mean, even water, you can overdose on water, but they, you know, suddenly say that we have to regulate all of the herbal industry with Codex Elementaris and other legislation, and that this is, again, it's a total manipulation intended to take out of our reach the things that are free, that are low-cost, highly effective alternatives to the
[01:12:23.781 --> 01:12:35.519]  Well, the Congressional Budget Office a few years ago, and I don't draw up the exact number, but they show the number of people that are killed each year by malpractice, and I want to go from memory and say it was 200 plus thousand.
[01:12:37.285 --> 01:12:53.218]  And then compared to guns you know of 13,000 or something I mean totally different numbers and meanwhile they can a year maybe find four or five instances of alternative herbs killing somebody and then they
[01:12:53.798 --> 01:12:56.400]  Do giant Dateline NBC shows on it.
[01:12:56.681 --> 01:12:57.601]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:58.122 --> 01:13:14.996]  And you know the risk again with going back to the avian flu, that the Tamiflu contains live viruses, that if you're thinking about how it is that you can get an avian flu, a bird flu to jump species, you gotta do some work, or you gotta do something stupid, like give a human virus
[01:13:15.556 --> 01:13:24.108]  That has a link and can mutate with the avian bird flu to ultimately cause that avian flu to jump species from birds to humans.
[01:13:24.508 --> 01:13:29.876]  And now you've got your declared, you know, prophesied Grand Klang.
[01:13:31.525 --> 01:13:36.729]  So you're saying, not just through the vaccine, but through the antivirals they could do something?
[01:13:37.049 --> 01:13:45.715]  Through the nasal sprays that contain live viruses, through the vaccines that contain live viruses, or simply proteins that have already been mutated.
[01:13:46.016 --> 01:13:49.358]  See, to get a virus to jump species, you've got to culture it, typically.
[01:13:49.718 --> 01:13:55.903]  In human white blood cells in studies, some studies, or human fetal tissues, that's where the fetal tissue is used.
[01:13:56.523 --> 01:14:01.006]  Now they've got even more advanced technologies, but you have to do laboratory operations.
[01:14:01.466 --> 01:14:24.220]  But if you take a human being, and you inject into that human being a portion of a virus that can be, that is designed for human transmission, and then that recombines with an avian virus that would not cause a problem in humans, suddenly now you've got an incubation chamber for new mutants.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.701]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:47.927]  Well, the big Tokyo papers, several of them reported a month ago that the top scientists in Japan have been looking at the birds and that all over the world, simultaneously, they're finding this virus in birds that haven't been traveling, that haven't been migrating, and that they've looked at the virus and it looks like it's been manufactured and altered in a lab.
[01:14:47.987 --> 01:14:50.608]  I mean, that's mainstream Japanese newspapers.
[01:14:51.188 --> 01:14:58.236]  You know, if you read, I think it's page 453 in the book Emerging Viruses, you see what these lunatics have been doing.
[01:14:58.556 --> 01:15:13.312]  They took avian flu and influenza and parainfluenza viruses and recombined them with leukemia, that is acute lymphocytic leukemia, quick-acting leukemia, so that you could spread cancer by sneezing.
[01:15:13.772 --> 01:15:15.693]  This is what they've done in the laboratories.
[01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:18.955]  And the risk of these things getting out is very real.
[01:15:19.235 --> 01:15:20.956]  In fact, they have gotten out.
[01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:33.543]  Well, they admit that they've got a virus up there they've squirreled with that's 39,000 times stronger than the 1918 influenza that broke out and killed 50 million people.
[01:15:34.143 --> 01:15:36.665]  And, I mean, this is admitted, and it's in a Level 3 lab.
[01:15:37.885 --> 01:15:45.249]  And under Bioshield Part 1, what, $6 billion for 36 level 4 biolabs in almost every major city?
[01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:53.974]  And then even the Baltimore Sun reported that they're producing, quote, thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[01:15:55.735 --> 01:15:58.337]  Folks, I've had Nobel Prize winning scientists on.
[01:15:59.277 --> 01:16:04.181]  I've had the father of protein recombinant DNA on from England, who worked for these people.
[01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:11.085]  Just with a genetically engineered potato, it creates enzymes that we can't absorb.
[01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:12.706]  It actually acts as poison in the body.
[01:16:12.966 --> 01:16:18.910]  But he said that they're constantly just splicing chimeras, four or five species in one thing, animal and plant.
[01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.612]  And I'll add one point to all those facts.
[01:16:32.034 --> 01:16:46.757]  They are currently operating in space, in the labs up in space, growing tobacco mosaic virus, which some indications are that it's linked to the mycoplasma and some of the worst flu-like respiratory ailment types of viruses.
[01:16:47.097 --> 01:16:55.939]  Growing them in space, they are, because in space they grow about 30 to 50 times the size and strength of these types of viruses.
[01:16:56.239 --> 01:17:01.400]  Now, then, of course, they bring them back from space and study them in the labs here on Earth.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.765]  So, you've got an extraterrestrial threat from viruses that are created by our own lunatics in government.
[01:17:07.945 --> 01:17:14.811]  Well, Dr. Horowitz, these people own, you know, hundreds of, I mean, like the Queen of England literally has over a hundred palaces.
[01:17:15.092 --> 01:17:20.176]  Juan Carlos is putting in, literally, his company is going to put toll roads on all the major Texas roads.
[01:17:20.216 --> 01:17:21.577]  They own the big oil companies.
[01:17:21.798 --> 01:17:22.919]  They have all this power.
[01:17:23.599 --> 01:17:26.481]  And then, don't they know they're threatening their own lives?
[01:17:26.521 --> 01:17:30.884]  Just wildly running around, randomly, thousands of laboratories.
[01:17:30.924 --> 01:17:32.846]  I mean, this is Noble Prize winners on the show, folks.
[01:17:33.166 --> 01:17:35.067]  Randomly just throwing things together.
[01:17:35.087 --> 01:17:37.669]  Well, you know what?
[01:17:37.829 --> 01:17:39.891]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.933]  And so now you enter into the realm of spiritual warfare.
[01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:46.435]  These people are evil to the max.
[01:17:46.856 --> 01:17:53.060]  And they are literally undoing what our great creator has created here that's so magnificent.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:18:08.895]  Life on Earth is awesome, and what these people have in their evil minds is literally to undo it all as much as possible and recreate this planet, not in the image of the Creator, but into their lunatic, insane,
[01:18:09.535 --> 01:18:11.737]  Horrifically satanic image.
[01:18:12.197 --> 01:18:14.579]  Well, I read what a lot of these scientists that are doing.
[01:18:14.699 --> 01:18:17.061]  I mean, IBM says there's no such thing as a mutation.
[01:18:17.321 --> 01:18:18.482]  We're going to change everything.
[01:18:18.502 --> 01:18:20.283]  You know, they're behind hundreds of these companies.
[01:18:20.924 --> 01:18:21.664]  They run around.
[01:18:21.725 --> 01:18:23.426]  I hear them going, we're now gods.
[01:18:23.806 --> 01:18:25.147]  I mean, they literally are lunatics.
[01:18:25.327 --> 01:18:26.108]  That's what they are.
[01:18:27.665 --> 01:18:34.751]  Well, if they're a god then, I mean, then they would know what that random recombinant system is going to create.
[01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:35.852]  Dr. Horowitz, stay there.
[01:18:35.872 --> 01:18:40.615]  I want to come back and take a few calls and also tell folks how to get some of your books and materials.
[01:18:41.176 --> 01:18:43.097]  Just amazing interview, folks.
[01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.438]  Please check out what he's saying.
[01:18:44.478 --> 01:18:45.079]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:57.501]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:18:57.642 --> 01:18:59.383]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:00.703]  But not just any water.
[01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:05.006]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:19:05.066 --> 01:19:14.772]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.

[01:19:45.134 --> 01:19:45.674]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:59.713]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.174 --> 01:20:07.958]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.298 --> 01:20:16.162]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.462 --> 01:20:21.205]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.545 --> 01:20:26.248]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.769 --> 01:20:30.631]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:32.132]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:32.192 --> 01:20:36.275]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:20:52.970 --> 01:21:01.578]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:21:01.799 --> 01:21:13.089]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:21:13.309 --> 01:21:15.952]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:22.736]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:21:22.896 --> 01:21:24.777]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:21:24.978 --> 01:21:31.001]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:21:31.241 --> 01:21:36.905]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:21:41.908 --> 01:21:42.608]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:56.016]  Government is best what governs least.
[01:21:56.577 --> 01:21:57.878]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:58.318 --> 01:22:01.040]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:04.123]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:11.028]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:11.349 --> 01:22:19.055]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at LibertyStickers.com.

[01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:33.306]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:33.486 --> 01:22:33.827]  Have you?
[01:22:34.407 --> 01:22:35.928]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:37.870]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:39.451]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.252]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:46.272 --> 01:22:47.852]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:47.872 --> 01:22:49.833]  Understand, folks, they can't just release some killer flu.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.085]  And not hype it up and make you get all scared beforehand, basically drilling you on how to respond.
[01:23:12.685 --> 01:23:13.706]  It's like Jim Jones.
[01:23:13.726 --> 01:23:18.610]  Hey, when I tell you to drink the Kool-Aid, he'd have them drink the Kool-Aid, you know, ten times a day, thousands of times.
[01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:25.335]  And so when it was time to drink the real Kool-Aid, they did it with the, uh, with the poison in it, with the cyanide.
[01:23:26.642 --> 01:23:28.643]  And so it won't be this flu.
[01:23:28.663 --> 01:23:29.163]  It won't be.
[01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:31.284]  It'll be something out of left field.
[01:23:31.604 --> 01:23:35.866]  But again, martial law, quarantines, roundups, forced injections.
[01:23:35.906 --> 01:23:39.867]  It's always the same story, year after year, bathing you in this.
[01:23:40.308 --> 01:23:43.609]  But the good news is, people last year, record levels, didn't take the flu shot.
[01:23:44.736 --> 01:23:47.999]  So they're having to increase the fear because they're losing control.
[01:23:48.019 --> 01:23:49.481]  Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Horowitz?
[01:23:49.561 --> 01:23:50.202]  Yes, indeed.
[01:23:50.242 --> 01:23:52.644]  And it's very, very wise to understand what you said.
[01:23:52.704 --> 01:23:54.106]  It's never what they tell you.
[01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:55.287]  It's always something else.
[01:23:55.327 --> 01:24:03.435]  And right now, I'm looking at upper respiratory flu illnesses nationwide that are a combination of not simply the mycoplasma, but other viruses.
[01:24:03.475 --> 01:24:05.758]  So there's secondary infections right now.
[01:24:06.278 --> 01:24:11.000]  Well, we'll tell folks about some information you've got on that coming up in the next break.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.802]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois, then Kim, Cheryl, and Bob.
[01:24:14.822 --> 01:24:16.403]  That'll be it for calls.
[01:24:16.463 --> 01:24:17.224]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:24:17.264 --> 01:24:19.345]  Yeah, Dr. Horwitz, thanks for all your work.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:41.463]  I just want to ask, my father, and I've tried to tell him not to do this, and a few weeks ago he went and got the flu shot.
[01:24:42.003 --> 01:24:45.864]  He was in the hospital extremely sick and ill after he got that flu shot.
[01:24:46.205 --> 01:24:47.165]  He thought he was going to die.
[01:24:47.185 --> 01:24:48.025]  He's 86 years old.
[01:24:48.105 --> 01:24:54.488]  My mother was a triathlete and she never gets sick and she took a flu shot and she was deathly ill for a month.
[01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:57.249]  Yeah, and Dr. Horwitz, I wanted to ask you about that.
[01:24:57.269 --> 01:25:02.111]  Another quick question would be, my mom's sister's in a nursing home and
[01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:10.755]  He said that probably 70-80% of all these people have been really, really sick with just aches and pains and coughing and stuff like that of something that's going around.
[01:25:11.255 --> 01:25:12.316]  And it's pretty scary, I think.
[01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:14.177]  Yeah, soft kill weapons go out for the weak.
[01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:15.097]  Dr. Horowitz?
[01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:19.880]  Yeah, well, number one, please, please, please, folks, do whatever you can.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:26.344]  Get in the face of all your family and friends who have no eyes to see the documents we publish and the ears to hear this truth.
[01:25:26.744 --> 01:25:27.905]  Get in their face.
[01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:30.807]  Say, do not get vaccinated with anything.
[01:25:31.267 --> 01:25:33.729]  Brother, I lost my mom to a flu vaccine.
[01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:36.071]  Your dad is 86 years old.
[01:25:36.391 --> 01:25:37.993]  It's a miracle he's still alive.
[01:25:38.413 --> 01:25:46.880]  It's Russian roulette every time you get a vaccine and it is, I'm telling you, the number one genocidal weapon to enslave people to chronic disease.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:55.047]  Dr. Horowitz, I can't tell you how many people I personally know who are as strong as horses who will not listen and go get this and then are deathly ill from it.
[01:25:55.467 --> 01:25:55.888]  You bet.
[01:25:56.408 --> 01:26:07.200]  And then the respiratory ailments that are going around, the best thing that I know to do, honestly, is the pneumonia factor with the Lomatium, Devil's Club, and the Black Elderberry combination now.
[01:26:07.601 --> 01:26:12.226]  Because if you don't get rid of the viruses that are in your system and the mycoplasma beast that's there,
[01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:16.747]  Then you're at high susceptibility to anything else that's going to come along.
[01:26:17.087 --> 01:26:23.689]  And people are already hacking and spitting up this like goo that's not anything like normal mucus in a cold.
[01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:28.530]  It is already an indication, a symptom of a man-made plague.
[01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:34.291]  And now this is the next step is what will cause this horrific plague.
[01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:36.342]  A reduction in population.
[01:26:36.843 --> 01:26:38.224]  And it will be something else.
[01:26:38.304 --> 01:26:39.084]  It won't be the avian flu.
[01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:39.945]  It's just ongoing.
[01:26:39.985 --> 01:26:41.026]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:41.106 --> 01:26:42.067]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:26:42.367 --> 01:26:45.169]  We're going to fire up that phone number to get that from Dr. Horowitz after the break.
[01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:48.572]  It's a cocktail of all the things they openly admit do help you with this.
[01:26:49.052 --> 01:26:50.413]  Let's talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:26:50.473 --> 01:26:51.194]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:26:51.214 --> 01:26:56.037]  I was calling about the lupus epidemic in the black women community.
[01:26:56.618 --> 01:26:57.278]  I'm not understanding.
[01:26:57.318 --> 01:26:59.400]  I've already had a cousin.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.341]  She's had it for like 15 years.
[01:27:01.421 --> 01:27:04.704]  And now we have a younger relative who just had five kids.
[01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:13.654]  It's genocide, my sister.
[01:27:13.734 --> 01:27:15.436]  It's genocide, complete, total.
[01:27:15.696 --> 01:27:20.579]  I mean, the blacks have been under the eugenics gun for the last century.
[01:27:20.619 --> 01:27:22.241]  The elimination of the black people.
[01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:30.727]  The principal reason the black people are being eliminated, like today, the Native North American women, they're 35% sterile.
[01:27:31.067 --> 01:27:33.429]  Black women in the United States, in urban America,
[01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:35.511]  25% are sterile.
[01:27:35.771 --> 01:27:36.092]  Why?
[01:27:36.352 --> 01:27:39.135]  Because there's a depopulation agenda in the black community.
[01:27:39.195 --> 01:27:39.515]  Why?
[01:27:39.816 --> 01:27:55.713]  Because if you look at the report from Iron Mountain, the enslavement, the depopulation, if you look at the Denver Airport murals where black women and Native North American women and Jews and Christians combined lie in a coffin,
[01:27:56.153 --> 01:27:57.314]  Well, it's like the BBs.
[01:28:20.769 --> 01:28:22.631]  It's like the BBC report had to admit it.
[01:28:22.651 --> 01:28:28.295]  People who've never had sex, never had anything, have HIV in Africa, all they've had is the injection.
[01:28:28.575 --> 01:28:28.915]  Right.
[01:28:29.256 --> 01:28:31.698]  So how are we getting it, though, if you're not getting it?
[01:28:31.718 --> 01:28:38.122]  They're getting it for the vaccinations primarily, the contaminated blood supply, and everything else that they're doing in the black community.
[01:28:38.403 --> 01:28:39.323]  Yeah, we'll be right back.
[01:28:39.343 --> 01:28:39.784]  Stay with us.
[01:28:39.804 --> 01:28:40.865]  Take a few more calls.
[01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:44.567]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.068 --> 01:28:46.649]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:50.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.089 --> 01:28:58.753]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[01:28:58.893 --> 01:29:04.937]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[01:29:05.017 --> 01:29:08.659]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder product.
[01:29:08.699 --> 01:29:09.860]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.881]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[01:29:12.921 --> 01:29:15.721]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[01:29:15.821 --> 01:29:21.963]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expense and hassle of juicing.
[01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:32.165]  Using biblical farming standards and 21st century technology, URI grows, harvests, and prepares God's whole foods in pure powder form to protect and lock in their nutrients.

[01:30:06.259 --> 01:30:09.743]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:30:10.003 --> 01:30:14.226]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to the low detectable levels.
[01:30:14.506 --> 01:30:18.429]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:25.194]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:30:25.414 --> 01:30:30.898]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:31.138 --> 01:30:38.060]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:30:44.962 --> 01:30:46.142]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.092 --> 01:30:59.456]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:59.676 --> 01:31:04.678]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:05.019 --> 01:31:12.923]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.063 --> 01:31:20.107]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.327 --> 01:31:21.548]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:25.090]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:25.150 --> 01:31:26.250]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:26.551 --> 01:31:27.811]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:31:28.032 --> 01:31:34.855]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:34.976 --> 01:31:37.417]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:40.582]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.602 --> 01:31:41.564]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:03.087 --> 01:32:04.547]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:04.867 --> 01:32:07.248]  We've reached the waypoint.
[01:32:07.268 --> 01:32:08.428]  It's only Barbara Walters.
[01:32:08.728 --> 01:32:09.328]  We've reached.
[01:32:09.789 --> 01:32:10.829]  Mawaskalee Wabbit.
[01:32:10.869 --> 01:32:15.190]  We have reached the midwaypoint in this live Thursday edition.
[01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:19.311]  We're going to have Colonel Craig Roberts on here with us in just a few minutes.
[01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:27.813]  For the rest of the broadcast, always honored to have him on to talk about his great two-part series, Martial Law, coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:32:31.019 --> 01:32:36.741]  But I'm going to take two final calls for Dr. Horowitz right now and give you his websites and a toll-free number.
[01:32:37.741 --> 01:32:38.842]  And I want to be specific.
[01:32:39.082 --> 01:32:45.484]  See, I believe in these powdered vitamins and superfoods and things that have been tested and admitted.
[01:32:45.504 --> 01:32:54.007]  I mean, there are hundreds of major studies on elderberry and the things that Dr. Horowitz has mentioned and he's put them all into one big cocktail to get that super effect.
[01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.548]  I believe in things like that.
[01:32:56.258 --> 01:33:03.422]  It's just what I don't believe in is somebody who gets on the air and says, we have a 100% total cure for cancer and this magic machine will do it.
[01:33:03.883 --> 01:33:09.846]  That then discredits all of the serious things that are out there that are treatments and are cures.
[01:33:10.106 --> 01:33:11.847]  And I believe in what Dr. Horowitz says.
[01:33:11.867 --> 01:33:12.628]  I've done my research.
[01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:14.729]  His five-step plan
[01:33:15.369 --> 01:33:16.730]  It's multi-faceted.
[01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:17.751]  It's multi-variant.
[01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:18.811]  You've got to get your head straight.
[01:33:19.071 --> 01:33:19.992]  You've got to exercise.
[01:33:20.012 --> 01:33:21.213]  You've got to get the proper nutrients.
[01:33:21.413 --> 01:33:23.034]  You've got to get the toxins out of your body.
[01:33:23.274 --> 01:33:25.175]  You've got to lower that acid level.
[01:33:25.736 --> 01:33:30.298]  All of those things, and I know in our daily lifestyle it's hard to do, all of that has to be done.
[01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.400]  And these genetically engineered foods are killing us.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.601]  We've had top scientists on and talk about that.
[01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:37.623]  In fact, Dr. Horowitz, fire out your phone number and websites for us.
[01:33:37.983 --> 01:33:38.343]  Certainly.
[01:33:38.423 --> 01:33:40.024]  The toll-free line is 888-508-7000.
[01:33:43.755 --> 01:33:47.037]  That's 888-508-4787 and the website is HealthyWorldDistributing.com.
[01:33:47.817 --> 01:33:50.018]  That's HealthyWorldDistributing.com.
[01:34:04.827 --> 01:34:13.321]  And you've put out this new cocktail of things that have been proven to be just incredible immune system boosters and virus suppressors.
[01:34:13.461 --> 01:34:14.683]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:15.003 --> 01:34:18.409]  My recommendation is it's the same way that I treated my family.
[01:34:18.911 --> 01:34:19.732]  Thank you for having me.
[01:34:36.187 --> 01:34:36.507]  Really?
[01:34:36.527 --> 01:34:37.347]  That's easy to get.
[01:34:37.727 --> 01:34:40.528]  The amylosia alnifolia, that's serviceberry.
[01:34:40.548 --> 01:34:42.428]  That's virtually impossible to get.
[01:34:42.768 --> 01:34:45.429]  Those are great against coronavirus attacks.
[01:34:45.829 --> 01:34:56.771]  And then, the most important one now, because of the new types of mutants that's going around, when we added the black elderberry, that's when we suddenly saw the efficacy of this combination go way back up again.
[01:34:57.231 --> 01:34:58.832]  So, three days is what we expect.
[01:34:58.892 --> 01:35:05.733]  Most people who have been hacking and coughing for weeks, if not months, they take this combination, and in three days, they should be back to normal.
[01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.056]  Alright, knock out those chronic problems.
[01:35:09.176 --> 01:35:10.417]  Let's take two final calls.
[01:35:10.437 --> 01:35:12.718]  We're going to let Dr. Horowitz get back to his important work.
[01:35:13.399 --> 01:35:15.180]  Let's talk to Cheryl in California.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.981]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:17.902]  Hi, my name is Cheryl.
[01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:21.304]  I've been having some serious problems with medication.
[01:35:21.485 --> 01:35:28.910]  I have a constant chronic cough where I cough up stuff that's not cool and nobody can find out what it is and I vomit constantly.
[01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:35.014]  I have aches and pains to the point where there are Charlie horses in my fingertips and nobody can determine what's wrong with me.
[01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:44.149]  And they gave me a shot to stop, a Rostetin or something, to stop vomiting, because I was vomiting for over 42 hours of blood from ulcers and stuff.
[01:35:44.249 --> 01:35:45.410]  How long has this been going on?
[01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:47.612]  About 11 months.
[01:35:48.012 --> 01:35:51.755]  And they don't know what it is because they don't even look for... They don't look for anything.
[01:35:51.915 --> 01:35:56.098]  And Medi-Cal won't cover anything to cover it, and I'm coming out of my pocket.
[01:35:56.118 --> 01:35:58.080]  Okay, well let's get Dr. Warner to comment on it.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.961]  Yeah, you've got drug reactions.
[01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:01.782]  It's the drugs that are causing that.
[01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:03.844]  The drugs cause acidity, it causes the...
[01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:11.348]  The types of bleeding that you're talking about, the vomiting, the nausea, the water, you're heavily, heavily dehydrated.
[01:36:11.408 --> 01:36:12.669]  I can tell you that right now.
[01:36:12.849 --> 01:36:15.871]  Yeah, I go almost every week for IV for dehydration.
[01:36:16.111 --> 01:36:23.995]  You're very dehydrated and your minerals, the reason why you have the neurological symptoms is you're not only dehydrated, you're demineralized too.
[01:36:24.516 --> 01:36:32.300]  So I would highly recommend that you get on a heavy water diet with minerals, pH of 8, adjusted water only.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.601]  Nothing else.
[01:36:33.641 --> 01:36:34.381]  Could you repeat that?
[01:36:34.801 --> 01:36:35.942]  pH of wet water?
[01:36:36.182 --> 01:36:36.562]  Yes.
[01:36:36.622 --> 01:36:42.345]  Go to, just basically go to the Healthy Healing Celebrations dot com.
[01:36:42.865 --> 01:36:44.406]  Healing Celebrations dot com.
[01:36:44.606 --> 01:36:45.786]  He said pH, pH 8.
[01:36:46.707 --> 01:36:47.487]  Nothing lower.
[01:36:47.587 --> 01:36:55.031]  And he's saying you're mineral deficient because there's almost no minerals in the food you get at the store or from the restaurant.
[01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:58.292]  Ma'am, start taking a good organic multivitamin.
[01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:01.374]  Start drinking a ton of water and you're going to see, and again,
[01:37:02.134 --> 01:37:04.755]  I'm going off what Dr. Horowitz said, but what we've experienced.
[01:37:04.795 --> 01:37:07.097]  Thanks for the call, and I'm sorry to hear you're in so much trouble.
[01:37:07.117 --> 01:37:13.260]  And it could be something else, but probably it's the direction that Dr. Horowitz was just talking about.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.641]  And we're so unhealthy, folks.
[01:37:15.701 --> 01:37:16.561]  I was reading a study.
[01:37:16.962 --> 01:37:23.425]  Americans don't eat more per calorie than they did 30 years ago, but we're fatter than ever.
[01:37:23.725 --> 01:37:25.346]  It's because of what's in the food.
[01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:26.746]  It's totally screwing us up.
[01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:27.647]  Dr. Horowitz?
[01:37:28.227 --> 01:37:28.908]  Absolutely.
[01:37:29.749 --> 01:37:32.852]  People have got to start to take responsibility for their own lives.
[01:37:32.912 --> 01:37:36.034]  Otherwise, you know, they might as well take a shotgun to their heads and pull the trigger.
[01:37:36.075 --> 01:37:37.316]  They'll save themselves a lot of grief.
[01:37:37.676 --> 01:37:40.719]  One last call, because we're going to go to our next guest, and I don't want to keep after Horowitz.
[01:37:41.039 --> 01:37:41.900]  Bob in Oklahoma.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:42.380]  Last call.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.001]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:37:46.164 --> 01:37:47.585]  Bob, you're on the air, sir.
[01:37:47.605 --> 01:37:51.649]  I can hear him bustling about in the background.
[01:37:53.328 --> 01:37:54.409]  Yeah, we're going to let him go.
[01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:56.169]  That's it for calls right now.
[01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:59.751]  I know we've got other callers for Dr. Horowitz, but that's all we can take right now.
[01:38:00.131 --> 01:38:01.992]  Dr. Horowitz, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:38:02.432 --> 01:38:03.493]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:38:03.533 --> 01:38:04.954]  Keep up the great work, my brother.
[01:38:05.154 --> 01:38:06.014]  God bless and take care.
[01:38:06.054 --> 01:38:06.234]  You too.
[01:38:06.574 --> 01:38:06.855]  Thanks.
[01:38:06.915 --> 01:38:07.175]  Bye.
[01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:07.635]  See ya.
[01:38:08.075 --> 01:38:08.535]  Alright.
[01:38:09.236 --> 01:38:12.798]  Kept him over a little bit so we could take some of those calls that have been holding the longest.
[01:38:13.038 --> 01:38:15.659]  And I'm sorry for Bob, but you know, if you're not there, you're not there.
[01:38:16.758 --> 01:38:19.162]  Shifting gears, but it's along the exact same line.
[01:38:19.182 --> 01:38:24.893]  In fact, the articles that he's written, Part 1 and 2, martial law coming to a neighborhood near you, question mark,
[01:38:26.539 --> 01:38:32.383]  cover this and Ron Paul last week said the government wants martial law on the takeover of the U.S.
[01:38:32.823 --> 01:38:35.145]  It will probably happen, if not this year, next year.
[01:38:36.505 --> 01:38:39.267]  They're constantly promoting it, Tommy Franks, the rest of them.
[01:38:39.808 --> 01:38:46.032]  We now have had foreign Mexican and Dutch and British troops in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[01:38:46.392 --> 01:38:48.473]  We now have open gun confiscation.
[01:38:48.853 --> 01:38:52.576]  We have reached new benchmarks in the road to hell.
[01:38:53.613 --> 01:39:00.099]  The road to enslavement, the road to slavery, the road to feudalism, the road to serfdom.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:09.728]  And Colonel Craig Roberts, a Colonel, worked in Army Intelligence, also was a Marine Corps Sniper in Vietnam, best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill.
[01:39:09.788 --> 01:39:12.471]  His website's excellent, RifleWarrior.com.
[01:39:14.013 --> 01:39:18.775]  He also worked the Oklahoma City bombing case, been a SWAT team man, helicopter pilot.
[01:39:19.215 --> 01:39:20.996]  He's done it all, and he's a good buddy of mine.
[01:39:21.316 --> 01:39:23.757]  Thanks for holding while we took a few calls there, Colonel.
[01:39:24.437 --> 01:39:27.118]  Hey Alex, give me time to go out and fire a couple more magazines off.
[01:39:27.578 --> 01:39:28.659]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:39:29.739 --> 01:39:32.320]  I tell you, this uh... In fact, I haven't asked you.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.621]  What do you think of this whole bird flu thing?
[01:39:34.661 --> 01:39:35.361]  What's your view on it?
[01:39:35.942 --> 01:39:38.723]  Well, you know, I got a real problem with that because
[01:39:39.818 --> 01:39:41.400]  We can trace some things back in history.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:46.004]  And you know me, I like to take all the pieces of the puzzle and put them on the wall and just see what kind of picture it forms.
[01:39:46.304 --> 01:39:49.287]  You know, that's the policeman, military intel type in me.
[01:39:49.828 --> 01:39:52.731]  And when I look at this, I know this just didn't just crop up overnight.
[01:39:53.291 --> 01:39:56.895]  And I want to give you some information today that I don't think any of your listeners have heard before.
[01:39:57.515 --> 01:40:02.420]  And they've heard bits and pieces, but they haven't heard the whole influenza story.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.482]  Because we found out some
[01:40:04.944 --> 01:40:11.305]  Some things back in the 80s when we were working on intelligence against the Russians just before the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[01:40:11.325 --> 01:40:15.326]  It has to do with influence in this country, so don't let me forget to tell you about that.
[01:40:16.066 --> 01:40:29.349]  But if we go back, the only, or the nearest strain to the H5N1 or N2, whatever this virus is, the latest, or the one strain, as you well know, and I'm sure you've talked about it on the show, is the 1918 influenza epidemic.
[01:40:31.914 --> 01:40:36.118]  And we know what parts of the population it killed and we know how many millions of people it killed and all that.
[01:40:36.518 --> 01:40:47.528]  But why in the world would the government then sign us to Alaska and dig up a frozen corpse to retrieve this virus?
[01:40:47.984 --> 01:40:50.086]  Well, they could study it again, number one.
[01:40:50.226 --> 01:40:51.587]  I mean, if it's gone, leave it alone.
[01:40:51.707 --> 01:40:55.089]  And then magically, it just pops up again under a new name.
[01:40:55.570 --> 01:40:56.070]  Exactly.
[01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:56.971]  Slightly modified.
[01:40:56.991 --> 01:40:59.072]  And what have we been experimenting with for the last 20 years?
[01:40:59.152 --> 01:41:01.594]  Gene modification, DNA modification, and so on.
[01:41:02.014 --> 01:41:05.056]  Well, I mean, earlier, before you got on, exactly the same thing.
[01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:12.502]  The Tokyo Times and other big papers have come out, and their scientists have looked at it, and they say, this thing is manufactured.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.582]  Well, you know, we did a lot of research trying to figure out where HIV came from.
[01:41:18.862 --> 01:41:20.602]  We tried to figure out where Ebola came from.
[01:41:20.642 --> 01:41:28.645]  We've got diseases now that they say came from the middle of an ancient tree in the Amazon forest, or the liver from a green monkey, or, you know, all these excuses.
[01:41:28.685 --> 01:41:33.306]  But when you go try to chase that down, you run into dead ends, and that's not where that stuff came from.
[01:41:33.366 --> 01:41:41.249]  But if we look at places like some of the Russian biological laboratories, some of the Chinese biological laboratories, stuff goes back to the Japanese, actually, in World War II.
[01:41:43.002 --> 01:41:59.036]  Manchuria, when Unit 733 was experimenting with biologicals on our POWs, which our government did absolutely nothing about at the end of the war when it came to war crimes, we can go back that far and bring it all the way forward into what's gone on since then.
[01:41:59.056 --> 01:42:06.663]  But if we look at our test stations, our biological development centers from World War II on, we talk about Fort Detrick,
[01:42:07.202 --> 01:42:20.808]  But we also forget sometimes about Plum Island, off the coast of Long Island in New York State, where it's supposed to be a veterinary type biological thing, but try to get ashore there and you're going to get intercepted by security.
[01:42:20.828 --> 01:42:22.308]  You're not going to see what this place is all about.
[01:42:22.989 --> 01:42:26.110]  Now, where did West Nile virus start?
[01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:27.131]  New York City.
[01:42:27.511 --> 01:42:28.011]  Why there?
[01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:34.348]  I mean, well, that's where Lyme disease began and it's even mainstream news that deer swam across.
[01:42:34.788 --> 01:42:36.770]  Well, and here you've got Plum Island right there.
[01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:38.772]  Did something escape or was something taken ashore?
[01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:39.293]  We don't know.
[01:42:39.914 --> 01:42:47.862]  But we start following these things up and we run into a group of people who really boost this.
[01:42:47.922 --> 01:42:49.243]  They want to see this happen.
[01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:54.628]  And it's the Gorbachev Foundation, which met in San Francisco back, you know, about a decade ago.
[01:42:55.088 --> 01:42:58.991]  And they stood there and they said, look, we have to reduce the world's population by 80%.
[01:42:59.031 --> 01:42:58.991]  80%!
[01:42:59.571 --> 01:43:02.694]  Now that's, you know, 8 out of 10 people, folks.
[01:43:03.494 --> 01:43:08.038]  And we have the means to do it, because we are the riders of the pale horse.
[01:43:08.738 --> 01:43:14.143]  Now, if you know how to decode that statement, if you go to the pale horse in the Book of Revelation, it's green.
[01:43:14.203 --> 01:43:15.524]  And green means pestilence.
[01:43:15.584 --> 01:43:18.586]  That means germs, germ warfare, sickness, disease.
[01:43:19.509 --> 01:43:22.892]  And now, they said, we have the means to do it.
[01:43:22.932 --> 01:43:24.914]  That means they didn't have the means to do it before.
[01:43:25.494 --> 01:43:42.709]  This is something that was developed, or captured, or both, and was put into arsenal form, militarized, and we go back to the CIA, go back to Stan Gottlieb in the 70s, and they were experimenting with 30 different types of viruses and
[01:43:44.491 --> 01:43:44.992]  We're good to go.
[01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:09.962]  And they also experimented with poisons and different things like that.
[01:44:09.982 --> 01:44:11.042]  Well, here's another example.
[01:44:11.103 --> 01:44:24.046]  In the September 2000 PNAG document, one of hundreds, Rebuilding America's Defenses, Dick Cheney says, we need to use the media to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons to kill certain races.
[01:44:25.154 --> 01:44:36.802]  Well, that goes right back to the same... I mean, Gorbachev, as you said, Gorbachev Foundation, Population Council of New York with the Rockefellers, not just Ted Turner, the Prince Phillips, but the Russians.
[01:44:37.282 --> 01:44:44.628]  I mean, this is all any of these people, Dick Cheney, ever talk about, and then you tell the general public this and they're laughing about it.
[01:44:44.888 --> 01:44:49.311]  Well, these people believe in something, and I'll give you a new term, filtering the population.
[01:44:50.131 --> 01:44:51.332]  That's a good one, yeah.
[01:44:51.372 --> 01:44:53.714]  Filtering the population means getting rid of the undesirables.
[01:44:54.093 --> 01:44:56.094]  The useless eaters, the people who don't do any good.
[01:44:56.334 --> 01:44:57.394]  Social Darwinism!
[01:44:57.794 --> 01:44:59.955]  Exactly, and the people who could be problems.
[01:45:00.075 --> 01:45:03.896]  People who would create resistance to the New World Order.
[01:45:03.936 --> 01:45:08.117]  Whatever their agenda is, they want to get rid of whatever stands in the way or whatever doesn't add to it.
[01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:10.158]  That's called genetic filtering.
[01:45:10.538 --> 01:45:12.838]  And genetic filtering can be done several ways.
[01:45:12.998 --> 01:45:16.439]  You can have a war and send the people you want to get rid of off in the first line troops.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.521]  You can introduce race-specific viruses and other biological weapons and chemical weapons.
[01:45:22.294 --> 01:45:25.877]  You know, they do the experiments with syphilis on the blacks during the Tuskegee experiments.
[01:45:26.558 --> 01:45:27.579]  And they just use blacks.
[01:45:27.719 --> 01:45:27.939]  Why?
[01:45:27.959 --> 01:45:32.623]  You know, if you want to learn about syphilis, you're going to need to do a laboratory experiment.
[01:45:32.643 --> 01:45:36.627]  You would get volunteers, which I don't think you would find any if they knew what they were getting involved in.
[01:45:36.947 --> 01:45:41.551]  But it would be every race to find out, you know, who's the wink-link, who's the... Well, let me stop you again.
[01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:48.337]  You know, we have the ringworm children, and that's just a term because any kid that had any fungus on their head, they'd say, oh, you're going to get that treated.
[01:45:48.377 --> 01:45:49.678]  They also tell them they're going to the dentist.
[01:45:50.669 --> 01:45:52.831]  They took 100,000 Jewish children, the U.S.
[01:45:52.871 --> 01:45:53.572]  government paid for.
[01:45:53.612 --> 01:45:55.293]  This is in Harat's newspaper, folks.
[01:45:56.274 --> 01:45:58.676]  And they would take them and they would hit them with enough radiation.
[01:45:58.716 --> 01:46:00.438]  Most of them died that day or in a week.
[01:46:00.798 --> 01:46:02.659]  A few survived who got lower doses.
[01:46:02.699 --> 01:46:05.322]  It was between 3,000 and 5,000 safe levels.
[01:46:05.662 --> 01:46:09.846]  Again, just another example of how cold-blooded these governments are.
[01:46:09.866 --> 01:46:13.309]  I mean, their own Jewish children just killing them!
[01:46:13.949 --> 01:46:18.233]  It's incredible when you start running across these things in history, then they get no play in the media.
[01:46:19.009 --> 01:46:22.031]  And people, when you tell it to them, they don't believe it to begin with.
[01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:30.155]  So, you know, let me jump to the Russian intelligence that we've got on the influenza, because I think it's important that we understand something here.
[01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:38.259]  Because right now you're looking at avian influenza that's escaped China, it's escaped Manchuria, it's worked its way across Russia, it's into Eastern Europe today.
[01:46:39.099 --> 01:46:42.381]  England's preparing for, what, 750,000 deaths if it crosses over into humans.
[01:46:44.952 --> 01:46:49.753]  Okay, let's just back up in history and touch on something that most people don't know about.
[01:46:50.674 --> 01:47:05.858]  We were reading Intel coming out of Russia back in the early 80s and we came across some information I found extremely interesting because I was working on my book The Medusophile at the time and I was working on Unit 733 which is the Japanese biological warfare test station under Shiro Ishii in Manchuria.
[01:47:12.319 --> 01:47:19.922]  The Russians, at the end of World War II, captured the two POW camps, one at Ping Fan and one at Hung Nam, or something like that.
[01:47:19.962 --> 01:47:23.004]  Anyway, they captured both the camps, but they captured half the scientists.
[01:47:23.464 --> 01:47:32.828]  And they took them back to Russia, and instead of, you know, the same thing we did when we took them to Japan and started milking them for all the information they had, because they'd experimented on live human beings.
[01:47:33.348 --> 01:47:36.009]  And the Russians wanted that information because of the Cold War and so on.
[01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:41.612]  Well, one of the things they wanted to do besides develop biological weapons for the battlefield,
[01:47:42.076 --> 01:47:44.817]  Because they also wanted to be able to do weapons of mass destruction.
[01:47:45.097 --> 01:47:50.038]  They wanted to be able to find out how it could vector from one person to another, how fast it could vector.
[01:47:50.058 --> 01:47:52.378]  Because if it's a slow vector, that means getting from me to you.
[01:47:52.658 --> 01:47:54.738]  If it's a slow vector, it's no good for military purposes.
[01:47:54.798 --> 01:47:56.979]  It is good for other things like population control.
[01:47:57.619 --> 01:48:03.860]  But they also wanted to find out if they could create delivery systems, which is the Japanese had a real hard time doing that.
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.260]  They developed the biologicals.
[01:48:05.301 --> 01:48:07.721]  They developed the different bacterias and viruses.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:17.604]  But they were using balloons, launched from highlands and submarines into the jet stream, trying to, uh... Yeah, they'd already been attacking us with, uh... Yeah, they had launched, and the American people don't realize this.
[01:48:17.644 --> 01:48:22.346]  Read my book, The Medusa File, and you're going to find out the whole experiment, uh, was successful in this.
[01:48:22.366 --> 01:48:26.788]  Well, there were whole fire teams of, uh, whole groups of U.S.
[01:48:26.948 --> 01:48:28.789]  Rangers that were stationed secretly.
[01:48:29.129 --> 01:48:29.849]  I've read about this.
[01:48:29.869 --> 01:48:33.270]  They had to fly out and jump out and put these fires out and contain it.
[01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:36.732]  Well, the fire balloons that landed in the Pacific Northwest,
[01:48:37.182 --> 01:48:37.782]  We're scouts.
[01:48:38.063 --> 01:48:39.424]  They weren't to start a test.
[01:48:39.564 --> 01:48:47.910]  They were a test to find out where the air currents went because the real deal was to launch everything from bubonic plague to influenza to whatever they could create.
[01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:49.111]  And they were creating a lot of stuff.
[01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:51.253]  Well, the Russians captured all this.
[01:48:51.293 --> 01:48:51.933]  They took it back.
[01:48:51.993 --> 01:48:55.616]  Now, we've heard about our biological tests and things like that at Fort Detrick.
[01:48:55.656 --> 01:48:57.557]  We've heard very little about the Russians.
[01:48:57.657 --> 01:49:01.900]  One of their main biological test stations was on an island in the middle of the Aral Sea.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.862]  Now, that island no longer exists because
[01:49:04.417 --> 01:49:09.421]  The way the Russians slashed and burned everything, they've ended up emptying half of the Aral Sea, and it's now all dry land there.
[01:49:09.461 --> 01:49:12.963]  But in the 70s and 80s, that island was right in the middle of the Aral Sea.
[01:49:12.983 --> 01:49:14.204]  This was before Russia fell.
[01:49:14.585 --> 01:49:15.746]  Yeah, now it's a peninsula.
[01:49:15.886 --> 01:49:16.626]  Now it's a peninsula.
[01:49:16.846 --> 01:49:23.311]  But at that time, it was an island, and that's where they were experimenting on our POWs, including POWs they'd captured in Vietnam.
[01:49:23.932 --> 01:49:26.534]  They were experimenting on other human beings, monkeys, and so on.
[01:49:26.614 --> 01:49:32.118]  Well, let's connect the dots when we get back and finish this, and then get into your article.
[01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:35.281]  Marshall Law, coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:49:35.301 --> 01:49:41.064]  On the other side of this quick break with Colonel Craig Roberts, RifleWarrior.com is the website.
[01:49:41.084 --> 01:49:47.387]  Don't forget our websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net.
[01:49:47.408 --> 01:49:48.148]  They're all excellent.
[01:49:48.168 --> 01:49:48.948]  Check them out today.
[01:49:49.269 --> 01:49:49.889]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.263 --> 01:49:57.606]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.806 --> 01:50:02.228]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.368 --> 01:50:06.731]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:08.152]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.932 --> 01:50:09.893]  Hammers!
[01:50:09.933 --> 01:50:14.135]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.195 --> 01:50:21.138]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.258 --> 01:50:23.339]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:24.640]  Homeland Security!
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.620]  Executive orders!
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.641]  Force vaccination!
[01:50:26.901 --> 01:50:34.043]  The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.263 --> 01:50:39.625]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:59.172]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.312 --> 01:51:05.474]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:05.754 --> 01:51:14.196]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.436 --> 01:51:21.438]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:26.581]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:26.801 --> 01:51:32.205]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.545 --> 01:51:35.627]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:35.968 --> 01:51:43.953]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.973 --> 01:51:44.533]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.879 --> 01:51:54.279]  I think so.
[01:52:09.546 --> 01:52:10.147]  I think so.
[01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:30.210]  I think so.
[01:53:04.242 --> 01:53:10.128]  Okay, we're continuing to talk about Russian bio-weapons developments, and then we're going to talk about martial law.
[01:53:10.889 --> 01:53:13.532]  Because the government, they corrupt illegitimate government.
[01:53:14.474 --> 01:53:20.679]  That's taken over our federal government, really is trying to prepare the public, the gallite, to prepare the ground.
[01:53:21.099 --> 01:53:22.080]  It's not working though.
[01:53:22.721 --> 01:53:25.183]  Not with American troops, and we'll tell you the reports.
[01:53:25.663 --> 01:53:31.868]  Colonel Roberts is getting from special forces and others that are in Afghanistan and Iraq and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg.
[01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:37.653]  He'll be with us the entire next hour, and we'll take calls next hour as well and cover some other news, get his take on that.
[01:53:37.713 --> 01:53:39.114]  But, Craig,
[01:53:40.174 --> 01:53:42.236]  But let me just plug this before this hour ends.
[01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:47.040]  Next Thursday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:53:48.101 --> 01:53:52.905]  Next Thursday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, 7 o'clock.
[01:53:52.925 --> 01:53:59.090]  I'll be showing my new film, The Order of Death, about 45 minutes long, about the occult activities of the elite.
[01:53:59.370 --> 01:54:01.772]  It's very well produced, very professional.
[01:54:01.992 --> 01:54:04.154]  PrisonPlanet.tv members can already see it right now.
[01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:12.075]  And then I'm going to show Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the new cut we've done, a shorter version with more information.
[01:54:13.316 --> 01:54:17.238]  South Lamar Alamo Draft House, 7 o'clock next Thursday the 27th.
[01:54:17.879 --> 01:54:24.103]  Go to Infowars.com, link through, and get your tickets online now before it sells out.
[01:54:24.243 --> 01:54:28.366]  So many people wait until the last couple days, they always sell out and you don't get to go.
[01:54:28.886 --> 01:54:33.770]  Get your tickets now while there's plenty of tickets left, or you can buy them at the door right now in South Lamar.
[01:54:34.411 --> 01:54:36.012]  Going back to Colonel Roberts, please continue.
[01:54:36.412 --> 01:54:57.870]  Okay, so we were working on this intel, trying to track down where it was going on this Russian biological test station, this island, and I was trying to put together some stuff on POWs and MIAs that had gone to Russia and found out that some of them had ended up, not only from Vietnam, but Korea, in World War II, had ended up as guinea pigs, human guinea pigs, at this island.
[01:55:00.105 --> 01:55:11.611]  The Intel report that I stumbled on, totally by accident, was the one that said that Russia had just fallen, and the place was in chaos, and the scientists hadn't been paid, so they just all left.
[01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:13.312]  And they left everything there intact.
[01:55:13.352 --> 01:55:16.434]  They left the test monkeys, they left the vials of stuff.
[01:55:16.974 --> 01:55:21.917]  Everything that was in a biological test lab, they just walked off and left because they hadn't been paid in two or three months.
[01:55:22.357 --> 01:55:23.978]  Well, the fishermen on the East Bank were
[01:55:25.252 --> 01:55:28.534]  There just happens to be a small Cosmodrome for launching rockets.
[01:55:29.314 --> 01:55:49.368]  Went over to the island, and they raided the place, and they took the microscopes, and the filing cabinets, and the typewriters, and chairs, and desks, and the monkeys that were all infected, and all the other animals, and they just stripped the place, and they took it over to the mainland, and they took it down to places like Turkestan, and Uzbekistan, and things like that, put them in the marketplace, and they were selling these infected monkeys to tourists as pets.
[01:55:49.824 --> 01:55:50.965]  They were selling all these other things.
[01:55:50.985 --> 01:55:53.227]  So that stuff was escaping out right there at that time.
[01:55:53.487 --> 01:55:54.668]  But let me back up before that.
[01:55:54.688 --> 01:55:56.169]  This is the story that we were following.
[01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:58.591]  We were worried about, okay, what got out and where could it be?
[01:55:58.971 --> 01:56:00.352]  But what I saw was something else.
[01:56:00.693 --> 01:56:18.927]  Because during the research on this place, I found out that what they were doing back in the 50s and 60s, and into the 70s, what they were doing is they were taking the things that they developed, and they were trying to create the biological weapons, but at the same time they were creating a new strain of influenza every year.
[01:56:19.491 --> 01:56:30.716]  And they would take it over to the Cosmodrome, they'd put it in the nose cone of a missile, or two or three or four, and they would shoot these things off and they would go off over the Pacific in the jet stream which blows toward the United States.
[01:56:31.437 --> 01:56:42.842]  And this was used as a method of tracking how fast a biological disease would go through the American population if it started at the West Coast or if it started, you know, wherever the jet stream took it.
[01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:44.563]  It could be Texas, wherever it came down.
[01:56:44.603 --> 01:56:48.085]  But wherever it was, it was an influenza virus that was developed by man
[01:56:48.642 --> 01:56:54.067]  And normally not fatal, except for a small portion of the population, because they wanted to see how far they could go.
[01:56:54.087 --> 01:56:56.088]  But how did they keep the virus from dying in the air?
[01:56:56.108 --> 01:57:05.796]  I mean, I know that's public, and there's been books written by scientists that work there, like biohazard and things, but I mean, how did they think it was going to... Was it crystallized, or...?
[01:57:05.836 --> 01:57:07.758]  Well, it was in a heated compartment in a vacuum.
[01:57:08.438 --> 01:57:15.464]  And I don't know exactly how they did it, but they had delivery capsules that these things would actually fall to a smaller altitude, go off, and then drift in the air.
[01:57:16.866 --> 01:57:22.891]  And that's why we were able to come up with a vaccine for that particular virus and advances, because they told us what they were going to do.
[01:57:24.832 --> 01:57:25.793]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:57:26.253 --> 01:57:26.854]  Stay there.
[01:57:26.874 --> 01:57:29.836]  We're going to be right back with the third hour with Colonel Roberts.
[01:57:29.856 --> 01:57:32.138]  We'll get into all the martial law preparations.
[01:57:33.038 --> 01:57:37.702]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.632 --> 01:57:50.293]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.954 --> 01:57:51.994]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.715 --> 01:57:53.816]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.477 --> 01:57:55.297]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.058 --> 01:57:56.979]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.619 --> 01:58:01.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.803 --> 01:58:05.907]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.468 --> 01:58:11.472]  Well, we've already got callers lining up to talk to Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:58:13.116 --> 01:58:18.443]  As far away as the United Kingdom, so Moogies, you'll be up first for Colonel Roberts.
[01:58:19.404 --> 01:58:23.789]  The toll-free number to join us on air in this hour is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:24.250 --> 01:58:30.838]  We've got a lot to talk about, but I'll try to start sprinkling some of your calls in by the end of the next segment.
[01:58:31.463 --> 01:58:34.426]  About 15 minutes or so, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:36.688 --> 01:58:40.752]  Colonel Roberts, you're right up my alley with this two-part series you wrote for NewsWithViews.com.
[01:58:40.772 --> 01:58:43.315]  We have it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:58:44.804 --> 01:58:47.226]  And that's martial law coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:58:47.266 --> 01:58:52.090]  I mean, we've heard all these years of the foreign troops and all these years of martial law.
[01:58:52.130 --> 01:58:54.392]  It's going to happen because we went to the urban warfare drills.
[01:58:54.692 --> 01:58:56.614]  We had sources like yourself in the military.
[01:58:56.954 --> 01:58:58.255]  We knew this was being prepared.
[01:58:58.695 --> 01:59:02.879]  But now they're really announcing it every night on the news to try to get us ready.
[01:59:03.319 --> 01:59:04.820]  But I've talked to the police and the military.
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.121]  They're not about to go along with it.
[01:59:06.161 --> 01:59:08.443]  And more people than ever are waking up.
[01:59:09.104 --> 01:59:10.244]  What do you see happening?
[01:59:10.264 --> 01:59:12.366]  Kind of condense and boil down those articles.
[01:59:13.823 --> 01:59:18.385]  We've had several things that we call intelligence indicators pop up in the last few years.
[01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:32.190]  And one, of course, and we've talked about this before, one of the biggest concerns that does not make any sense whatsoever, should be the big flag in the sky, is we're supposed to be in this war on terrorism, yet we do nothing to block our borders or our seaports.
[01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:37.252]  At the same time, we've got China, who's basically moved into our hemisphere,
[01:59:37.765 --> 01:59:49.848]  We've given him, basically, through the Panamanian government, the Panama Canal, and I can guarantee, in my opinion, I guarantee that Jimmy Carter knew where this thing was going when he signed the legislation.
[01:59:49.908 --> 01:59:54.228]  Well, in 2000, the Republicans had a chance to block it and get it, and they didn't lift a finger.
[01:59:54.769 --> 01:59:55.869]  Well, those are Washington, D.C.
[01:59:55.909 --> 01:59:56.449]  Republicans.
[01:59:56.469 --> 01:59:57.709]  That's a whole different breed of cat.
[01:59:57.729 --> 01:59:59.009]  They're no different than the Democrats.
[01:59:59.089 --> 02:00:00.130]  They just work slower.
[02:00:02.249 --> 02:00:09.473]  We've got the Chinese who set up the biggest ocean transshipment place in the world in Freeport, in the Bahamas, 80 miles off the coast of Florida.
[02:00:10.053 --> 02:00:16.916]  And they've got the biggest cranes there that there is for moving sea lift containers on and off these container ships.
[02:00:16.956 --> 02:00:18.857]  They've got stacks of these things every place.
[02:00:19.337 --> 02:00:25.120]  Costco, which is the China Ocean Shipping Company, is now the biggest maritime transshipment organization in the world.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.341]  They've got the biggest fleet with the biggest boats.
[02:00:28.402 --> 02:00:29.302]  China is building
[02:00:30.101 --> 02:00:31.884]  Amphibious assault craft.
[02:00:32.805 --> 02:00:33.526]  Landing craft.
[02:00:33.906 --> 02:00:34.407]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:37.251]  It just came out that they're not spending 30 billion a year on weapons.
[02:00:37.411 --> 02:00:39.193]  They're spending at least 100 billion.
[02:00:39.213 --> 02:00:42.418]  Secret, secret arms race.
[02:00:42.838 --> 02:00:43.940]  That's what it is and what they're doing.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:47.104]  They're buying everything that the Russians are getting rid of.
[02:00:47.625 --> 02:00:52.190]  And they're not only equipping themselves, they're equipping the North Koreans and, I guess, probably some other allies.
[02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:54.633]  But let's be clear, the globalists are all behind this and love it.
[02:00:54.893 --> 02:00:56.254]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[02:00:56.415 --> 02:01:02.701]  You know, you've got to have an army from someplace and you've got to get it supplied, so we use Walmart to fund these guys so they can build stuff they can use against us.
[02:01:02.942 --> 02:01:06.846]  So it's not going to happen like Red Dawn, it's going to be, come in, we love you, they're the saviors.
[02:01:07.106 --> 02:01:07.847]  Henry Kissinger.
[02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:09.910]  Back during the L.A.
[02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:17.213]  riots, I mentioned who could help out in that situation when we tried to get National Guard troops and they pulled Marines up from Camp Pendleton.
[02:01:17.233 --> 02:01:19.773]  He said, right now we couldn't use foreign troops.
[02:01:20.134 --> 02:01:20.914]  And I'm paraphrasing.
[02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:29.076]  He says, Americans would not welcome foreign troops on our soil right now, but the day will come when they will welcome foreign troops with open arms.
[02:01:29.776 --> 02:01:32.357]  Now that's kind of a chilling thought.
[02:01:32.397 --> 02:01:34.118]  Back then we'd say, no way, it's not going to happen.
[02:01:35.143 --> 02:01:36.004]  Look what's happening now.
[02:01:36.044 --> 02:01:43.468]  We've got Barry McCaffrey, who went to the CASCU course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, gave a speech and he said, he came from, you know, he came out of... You had family at that speech!
[02:01:43.748 --> 02:01:44.308]  Yes, I did.
[02:01:44.569 --> 02:01:52.553]  And my young nephew, who's a captain, called me and he said, this guy was introduced as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and so I started taking notes, because he'd been raised right.
[02:01:53.434 --> 02:02:02.039]  And he said, he told us that with the build-down of the military being what it is today, and I love that word, build-down, that's when the Clintons were destroying the military, he said,
[02:02:02.492 --> 02:02:16.624]  Should we get committed on a two-ocean war, or on two fronts overseas, or more, we will have, and should a national emergency occur at home, we will have no one to handle it, and we'll be forced to call upon foreign assets to patrol our streets.
[02:02:16.924 --> 02:02:24.311]  UN General McKenzie said that exact statement, exact statement, on Nightline, seven days after 9-11.
[02:02:24.671 --> 02:02:27.053]  I saw it.
[02:02:27.694 --> 02:02:28.114]  It's coming.
[02:02:30.134 --> 02:02:31.315]  Well, we're going to come back.
[02:02:31.335 --> 02:02:38.760]  I want to recap this, get into more detail and take some calls and talk about a host of issues with my good buddy, a great expert on the New World Order, Colonel Craig Roberts.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.340]  Stay with us.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.801 --> 02:02:43.183]  PrisonPlanet.tv, RivalWarrior.com.
[02:02:46.337 --> 02:02:49.219]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.041]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.381 --> 02:02:56.045]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.385 --> 02:03:03.131]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.451 --> 02:03:05.433]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.633 --> 02:03:08.475]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.576 --> 02:03:13.240]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.844]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.084 --> 02:03:25.290]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.570 --> 02:03:28.072]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:51.213]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.553 --> 02:03:55.656]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.936 --> 02:03:56.496]  We listened.
[02:03:56.796 --> 02:04:01.780]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:02.540]  We listened.
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:05.962]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.383 --> 02:04:06.943]  We listened.
[02:04:07.383 --> 02:04:11.426]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.886 --> 02:04:12.286]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.647 --> 02:04:38.269]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.289 --> 02:04:39.710]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.273 --> 02:04:48.194]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[02:04:48.334 --> 02:04:50.555]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[02:04:50.915 --> 02:04:52.916]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[02:04:53.076 --> 02:04:55.537]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[02:04:55.617 --> 02:04:58.638]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[02:04:58.818 --> 02:05:00.059]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:05.681]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[02:05:05.761 --> 02:05:10.363]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease, as well as undue emotional stress.
[02:05:10.683 --> 02:05:16.847]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[02:05:16.867 --> 02:05:23.310]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:29.093]  The Un-Medical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[02:05:40.941 --> 02:05:43.663]  That's 888-224-7416.
[02:05:46.386 --> 02:05:52.431]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.031 --> 02:05:56.014]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:03.851]  We got 51 and a half minutes left in this transmission.
[02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:05.032]  A ton of news to cover.
[02:06:05.052 --> 02:06:05.792]  We're going to get Col.
[02:06:06.152 --> 02:06:07.653]  Greg Roberts' take on a lot of it.
[02:06:08.054 --> 02:06:09.515]  We're talking about martial law.
[02:06:09.535 --> 02:06:11.136]  He was paraphrasing a quote earlier.
[02:06:12.137 --> 02:06:15.539]  This quote, I have this in my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:06:16.298 --> 02:06:20.359]  On page 7, today America would be outraged if U.N.
[02:06:20.379 --> 02:06:23.180]  troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:25.021]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful.
[02:06:25.121 --> 02:06:33.204]  This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[02:06:33.304 --> 02:06:36.025]  It is then that all peoples of the world will plead
[02:06:36.693 --> 02:06:38.494]  to deliver them from this evil.
[02:06:38.954 --> 02:06:41.094]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[02:06:41.434 --> 02:06:51.898]  When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the world government.
[02:06:52.318 --> 02:06:56.119]  Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberg Conference, Evian, France, 1991.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:00.801]  Don't forget this George Bush quote on December 18, 2000, CNN.
[02:07:03.524 --> 02:07:07.790]  If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:10.132]  In fact, why don't you find that clip, Scott?
[02:07:10.152 --> 02:07:11.254]  I want to play that in a few minutes.
[02:07:11.875 --> 02:07:13.497]  Find the dictator quote of Bush, if you can.
[02:07:15.219 --> 02:07:17.562]  I've got about 50 of these quotes here in my book.
[02:07:18.152 --> 02:07:18.913]  Here's Prince Philip.
[02:07:19.313 --> 02:07:28.698]  I must confess that I am tempted to ask for reincarnation as a particularly deadly virus to adjust the cull for the size of the surplus human population.
[02:07:29.139 --> 02:07:31.520]  That's his own book and it just goes on and on.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:39.265]  It is the sacred principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter in which the American people will henceforth pledge their allegiance.
[02:07:39.605 --> 02:07:43.387]  President George Herbert Walker Bush addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations 1992.
[02:07:46.044 --> 02:07:48.164]  Yeah, go ahead and play our esteemed president.
[02:07:48.184 --> 02:07:48.605]  Here he is.
[02:07:49.405 --> 02:07:50.125]  But that's okay.
[02:07:50.145 --> 02:07:53.606]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:07:55.126 --> 02:07:56.446]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:07:58.727 --> 02:08:01.767]  But then he came out and actually proposed it.
[02:08:03.468 --> 02:08:05.428]  Then again, folks, I'm not getting partisan on this.
[02:08:05.548 --> 02:08:09.709]  Bush, Clinton, they're all frontman puppets with a big financial interest behind them.
[02:08:10.474 --> 02:08:17.552]  And they'll remove Bush like birdcage liner, put somebody in new, and everybody'll go, oh, it's okay, but the martial law will roll forward.
[02:08:17.633 --> 02:08:18.695]  This is a process.
[02:08:20.183 --> 02:08:22.624]  And America is the big prize by the globalists.
[02:08:22.924 --> 02:08:26.065]  They want to get rid of the middle class, but they can bring this country down.
[02:08:26.085 --> 02:08:28.846]  They will have the engine to take over the planet.
[02:08:29.466 --> 02:08:32.367]  Only America stands in their way, and this is not a joke.
[02:08:32.847 --> 02:08:36.128]  Foreign troops were brought in to police America.
[02:08:36.668 --> 02:08:37.849]  Foreign troops.
[02:08:38.369 --> 02:08:39.009]  Mexican.
[02:08:39.429 --> 02:08:39.890]  Dutch.
[02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:47.272]  The exact people I've videoed at urban warfare training drills, practicing to take your guns and admitting it's for America.
[02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:51.812]  That's why it's so important to get my film, Martial Law, made a pretty timely title.
[02:08:52.292 --> 02:08:55.233]  Martial Law is a mini-series, three hours long.
[02:08:56.513 --> 02:09:02.076]  It details the takeover plan, the Martial Law plan, how they carried out 9-11, why they carried out 9-11.
[02:09:03.445 --> 02:09:06.926]  And then it gets into the ideology that drives it all and how to stop them.
[02:09:07.326 --> 02:09:08.186]  Please get it.
[02:09:08.266 --> 02:09:11.447]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:09:45.039 --> 02:09:49.700]  Going back to Colonel Roberts, Craig, there was your quote right there.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:55.662]  Well, you know, it looks like Kissinger must have had a report of Iron Mountain stuck in his back pocket.
[02:09:56.357 --> 02:10:00.539]  And today it's the bird flu, or it's the hurricanes, you know I had Ben Livingston
[02:10:17.228 --> 02:10:27.614]  The father of, you know, when you were down in the bush in Vietnam, he was the guy directing the planes, creating, you know, huge storms and flooding the Viet Cong on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[02:10:27.654 --> 02:10:33.217]  They conclusively controlled and weakened hurricanes with that technology.
[02:10:34.278 --> 02:10:39.561]  Stanford did studies, it was documented, but they won't let them deal with the hurricanes today.
[02:10:40.001 --> 02:10:44.464]  Well, you know, now that you mention that, if you look at the Sante raid,
[02:10:45.032 --> 02:10:59.519]  Where the Air Force was going to fly in and rescue American POWs in North Vietnam at Son Tay and they went through a giant preparation stage, training, buying equipment, keeping it top secret, practicing the raid in Florida, doing the whole bit.
[02:11:00.259 --> 02:11:08.503]  A good friend of mine flew the lead helicopter on that raid and when they got there what happened was all the POWs had been evacuated out of that prison
[02:11:08.979 --> 02:11:18.246]  Because the water had come up, and the reason the water had come up is because the CIA had been seeding the clouds with all kinds of stuff and creating such a monsoon that it flooded the whole area and didn't tell anybody.
[02:11:18.266 --> 02:11:22.769]  So, you know, yeah, that weather control happened in Vietnam.
[02:11:22.809 --> 02:11:28.453]  They were experimenting with all kinds of stuff along that line, and that was just using chemicals and, you know, iodide and all that kind of stuff.
[02:11:28.853 --> 02:11:35.338]  Where now, you know, you get into the atmospheric heating and the redirection of wind currents and so on.
[02:11:35.798 --> 02:11:38.580]  I've never in my life seen this many hurricanes in a two-year period.
[02:11:39.201 --> 02:11:42.303]  Well, the other day they came on television and said, well, this is a normal cycle.
[02:11:42.343 --> 02:11:46.225]  We've looked back at our records and we're just back into a high hurricane season cycle.
[02:11:46.245 --> 02:11:49.827]  And I'm going, well, in the last 50 years that I can remember, I've never seen a cyclone.
[02:11:49.867 --> 02:11:53.149]  No, this has broken the record, this new hurricane.
[02:11:53.169 --> 02:11:57.971]  75 years ago they had this many hurricanes, but none of them were this strong.
[02:11:58.391 --> 02:12:01.133]  And these things are not taking paths they've ever taken before.
[02:12:01.453 --> 02:12:04.375]  They're not behaving in ways, they're forming second eyes.
[02:12:05.075 --> 02:12:06.696]  Very, but listen, we know
[02:12:07.276 --> 02:12:19.065]  By the guy that ran the operations for the Naval Weapons Lab, we know, by the guy that ran the operations in Vietnam, that they can stop these hurricanes right now with the old technology, Colonel.
[02:12:19.785 --> 02:12:25.730]  Well, whether they can or can't, the issue is, if one comes ashore, how can they capitalize on it?
[02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:28.872]  Not, not, how can they, you know, fix it afterwards?
[02:12:28.952 --> 02:12:33.336]  Well, Mr. Livingston openly said they're going to make more money and get more control off of letting them come ashore.
[02:12:33.856 --> 02:12:36.498]  Well, absolutely, and, and, and, well, not only the economy,
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:37.460]  It's a boost.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.381]  It's like going to war.
[02:12:38.421 --> 02:12:39.881]  You lose a lot, but you gain more.
[02:12:40.662 --> 02:12:41.542]  You gain more in technology.
[02:12:41.562 --> 02:12:42.322]  You gain more in sales.
[02:12:42.342 --> 02:12:43.583]  You gain more in production.
[02:12:43.603 --> 02:12:44.683]  You gain more in manufacturing.
[02:12:44.703 --> 02:12:47.724]  You gain more in moving products around with transportation.
[02:12:48.124 --> 02:12:50.385]  That stuff happens anytime you have an emergency like this.
[02:12:50.585 --> 02:12:52.166]  Not only here, but anywhere in the world.
[02:12:52.206 --> 02:12:55.968]  You know, we send all this help to tsunami victims and earthquake victims and stuff like that.
[02:12:56.008 --> 02:12:57.308]  Well, money's got to change hands.
[02:12:58.008 --> 02:12:59.689]  And somebody is going to make a profit off of it.
[02:12:59.709 --> 02:13:00.850]  And that's how that stuff works.
[02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:06.692]  But what scares me is we, as a nation right now, are no longer this
[02:13:07.316 --> 02:13:08.116]  You know, superpower.
[02:13:08.276 --> 02:13:09.497]  We are so vulnerable.
[02:13:09.597 --> 02:13:10.577]  We're down on our knees.
[02:13:11.177 --> 02:13:12.777]  We are wide open.
[02:13:13.037 --> 02:13:16.998]  And the terrorism was the perfect trap to get us to overextend.
[02:13:17.018 --> 02:13:18.659]  And again, it's all being run out of Washington.
[02:13:20.239 --> 02:13:20.559]  It is.
[02:13:20.579 --> 02:13:22.680]  And we've got Washington.
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:28.701]  When you go to them, you go to the White House and you say, Hey, George, what are you doing to stop the Southwest border incursion?
[02:13:28.721 --> 02:13:33.262]  What are you doing to round up these, not only the illegal aliens, but the Islamic terrorists?
[02:13:33.915 --> 02:13:49.066]  and and these these uh... you know salvador street gang members with with automatic weapons and bombs and who are killing cops who are you know this is a clear present danger this is a threat this is an imagined this is not tom clancy here it's happening today george what are you going to do about it and you get no answer
[02:13:49.597 --> 02:13:50.998]  But it shows out of sight, out of mind.
[02:13:51.018 --> 02:13:53.860]  There have been 600 plus deaths in the first eight months of this year.
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:55.020]  I quit counting two months ago.
[02:13:55.361 --> 02:13:56.341]  They've shot down the U.S.
[02:13:56.401 --> 02:14:09.930]  Embassy, rocket attacks, car bombings in Dallas, MS-13 in Las Vectas, admittedly CIA-controlled, running around controlling the drug trade, and cops I've talked to aren't even worried about it because the news didn't tell them to worry about it.
[02:14:10.130 --> 02:14:14.513]  Can you imagine if Al Qaeda had killed 600 people, including over 15 police?
[02:14:16.054 --> 02:14:16.394]  Well, it's...
[02:14:17.913 --> 02:14:21.414]  You know, we sit here and we work on the information we've got.
[02:14:22.014 --> 02:14:26.675]  And if the 6 o'clock news doesn't tell us what the problem is, then obviously there is not a problem.
[02:14:27.296 --> 02:14:30.376]  And, you know, you and I both know that a man is never a prophet in his own village.
[02:14:30.416 --> 02:14:35.738]  We can talk to our family and our friends and our neighbors and they think we're wackos, but we can travel halfway across the country and we're experts.
[02:14:36.498 --> 02:14:45.360]  And that's... One of the questions that I get when I write these articles like this last one, News with Views, I get email all the time that say, well, yes, but what do we do about it?
[02:14:45.819 --> 02:14:47.240]  And I know you get that question, too.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:49.441]  Well, there's a lot of things that we can do about it.
[02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:50.102]  Is it effective?
[02:14:50.202 --> 02:14:50.682]  I don't know.
[02:14:51.102 --> 02:14:53.444]  But you can't just sit around and put your head in the sand.
[02:14:53.464 --> 02:14:55.625]  You can't sit on the couch and just go, oh my, my.
[02:14:55.965 --> 02:14:59.447]  You've got to do something, even if it's educate one or two other people on what's going on.
[02:14:59.467 --> 02:15:05.651]  Well, it's a process, but I mean, tell us what these special forces you talk to, I mean, they know about the gun confiscation plans.
[02:15:05.691 --> 02:15:06.512]  They know about it now.
[02:15:06.752 --> 02:15:07.472]  What are they saying?
[02:15:07.833 --> 02:15:13.176]  Well, you know, there were different questions asked very subtly through the years.
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:27.685]  over the last, well, since 1990, that, you know, if things really got bad in this country and turned into anarchy and we had a national emergency and things broke down and we had to go disarm the civilians before they hurt themselves, would you go help us disarm the civilians?
[02:15:28.425 --> 02:15:30.245]  And, of course, the question was put in different ways.
[02:15:30.285 --> 02:15:32.746]  We had the Cunningham Survey that happened out in California.
[02:15:32.846 --> 02:15:35.007]  And that acts as conditioning.
[02:15:35.907 --> 02:15:40.889]  Well, it does to a point, but it also gives them a lot of feedback on these surveys
[02:15:41.574 --> 02:15:51.438]  As to, would our troops obey orders that were given to go and basically violate posse comitatus, if we establish martial law, go house to house and do search and seizure and so on.
[02:15:51.718 --> 02:15:57.780]  And the resounding answer of over 90% of the people was simply, no, that's our families.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.781]  And besides, I've got guns at home.
[02:16:00.061 --> 02:16:02.142]  And I know what's going on, and I'm not going to do that.
[02:16:02.162 --> 02:16:05.163]  This country was built on the right to bear arms.
[02:16:05.183 --> 02:16:06.383]  It was built on guns!
[02:16:06.403 --> 02:16:07.304]  And we're not going to do it.
[02:16:07.384 --> 02:16:09.765]  So, with that information, I said, okay, no problem.
[02:16:09.805 --> 02:16:10.585]  Forget we even asked.
[02:16:11.198 --> 02:16:15.401]  Because what that told the globalist was, we can't use the American troops at home.
[02:16:15.562 --> 02:16:18.284]  And see now we've had Mexican, we've had Dutch, we've had British.
[02:16:18.724 --> 02:16:20.626]  Now the deals have been signed two years ago.
[02:16:20.946 --> 02:16:25.009]  Now, oh yeah, they've been here before, and then they'll be here again, a little more, a little more.
[02:16:25.209 --> 02:16:30.354]  And now we've got foreign cops here in these exchange programs who are openly going around helping to arrest.
[02:16:30.414 --> 02:16:32.015]  And, oh, we've done that all week.
[02:16:32.195 --> 02:16:32.976]  See the conditioning?
[02:16:33.316 --> 02:16:39.121]  Well, I was talking to Marina Oswald Porter, who was Lee Harvey Oswald's widow.
[02:16:40.081 --> 02:16:40.742]  Really nice lady.
[02:16:41.095 --> 02:16:42.536]  Listen, Texas is not too far from you.
[02:16:43.376 --> 02:16:48.638]  And I was talking to her a few years ago, and she says, Mr. Roberts, I am seeing in this country now what I saw in Russia.
[02:16:48.938 --> 02:16:49.579]  I said, what's that?
[02:16:49.599 --> 02:16:59.003]  She said, when it came time to disarm the people, what happened was they took the troops from the north and they sent them to the very south of the country, which is like, you might as well go to a different country.
[02:16:59.603 --> 02:17:02.024]  And they took the troops from the south and they sent them to the north.
[02:17:02.484 --> 02:17:04.945]  And they had them go to village and village and disarm everybody.
[02:17:04.965 --> 02:17:06.606]  She says, because they knew
[02:17:07.133 --> 02:17:11.797]  That they could not have the troops in the North disarm the people of the North because they wouldn't do it.
[02:17:11.997 --> 02:17:12.938]  That's their own people.
[02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:15.179]  And she said, now it's happening in this country.
[02:17:15.199 --> 02:17:16.240]  It's being said for that.
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.902]  They will bring in other troops to do it, not yours.
[02:17:19.182 --> 02:17:20.544]  She told me that 15 years ago.
[02:17:23.366 --> 02:17:27.389]  All the old timers, 30 years ago, they were just going off the documents, though.
[02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:29.250]  This has always been the plan.
[02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:30.992]  People ask us, how did you know this would happen?
[02:17:31.012 --> 02:17:31.552]  How did you know?
[02:17:31.572 --> 02:17:33.714]  Now, Ron Paul's now talking about it.
[02:17:34.014 --> 02:17:36.336]  Because we had their own documents, didn't we, Colonel?
[02:17:37.972 --> 02:17:40.595]  We had everything we needed, but no one wanted to believe anything.
[02:17:40.615 --> 02:17:41.736]  They said, well, it couldn't happen here.
[02:17:41.756 --> 02:17:42.357]  This is America.
[02:17:42.677 --> 02:17:44.659]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.881 --> 02:17:52.207]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:17:52.527 --> 02:17:57.813]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:17:58.233 --> 02:18:01.196]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:20:45.959 --> 02:20:52.007]  With the rising gasoline prices, war and inflation on the horizon, you should be concerned about the purchasing power of your money.
[02:20:52.327 --> 02:20:53.649]  Since 1960, the U.S.
[02:20:53.689 --> 02:20:56.613]  dollars lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[02:20:56.953 --> 02:20:58.856]  What can you do to protect your hard-earned money?
[02:20:59.176 --> 02:21:01.239]  Genesis Radio is proud to bring you the solution.
[02:21:01.479 --> 02:21:02.659]  The Silver Liberty Dollar.
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.940]  It's different from the U.S.
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:04.320]  dollar.
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:08.942]  It's 100% inflation proof because it's 100% backed by real silver.
[02:21:09.342 --> 02:21:11.983]  It's already the second most popular currency in the U.S.
[02:21:12.183 --> 02:21:15.904]  with 100,000 people using it to protect their purchasing power.
[02:21:16.284 --> 02:21:24.107]  G. Edward Griffin, the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, endorses and urges all Americans to get Silver Liberty Dollars and beat inflation today.

[02:21:41.415 --> 02:21:51.079]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:54.041]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:59.176 --> 02:22:01.859]  The globalists are in control because they're ruthless.
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:03.661]  Because they see us as cattle.
[02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:06.364]  Because they're willing to exercise their authority on us.
[02:22:06.704 --> 02:22:09.507]  Because we are too weak-minded to admit the full hire.
[02:22:09.968 --> 02:22:15.574]  It's time to grow up and face what we're looking at here and turn it around before it's too late.
[02:22:16.555 --> 02:22:19.058]  I believe it's Mungus in England.
[02:22:19.238 --> 02:22:19.859]  You're on the air.
[02:22:19.939 --> 02:22:20.599]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:20.639 --> 02:22:21.040]  Go ahead.
[02:22:21.812 --> 02:22:22.393]  Yeah, hello.
[02:22:22.753 --> 02:22:24.274]  My question is for the Colonel.
[02:22:24.514 --> 02:22:36.664]  The first question is, do you have any specific information, any specific information regarding Bush being in the MKULTRA program, through your connections, etc.?
[02:22:38.165 --> 02:22:48.353]  My second question is... Well, to be specific, do you mean that family, Bush Sr., CIA Director, involved in MKULTRA, or do you mean under MKULTRA?
[02:22:49.159 --> 02:22:57.766]  Under MTL, I'm sure the Colonel must have seen the movie, The Manchurian Candidate, where soldiers were like under this program or something like that.
[02:22:57.786 --> 02:22:59.768]  Yeah, okay, that's your first question, what's your second?
[02:23:00.328 --> 02:23:04.391]  Yes, the second question is about cell phone calls in 9-1-1.
[02:23:05.993 --> 02:23:14.760]  Well, they have a show about the cell phone calls, I've just got to say this, on Discovery Channel, where they use the same cell phone calls for both planes.
[02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:17.522]  My specific question is,
[02:23:18.166 --> 02:23:21.489]  What's the max distance where the cell phone will work?
[02:23:21.709 --> 02:23:33.778]  My third and last question is, like more and more people are talking about the next terrorist attack, etc.
[02:23:34.339 --> 02:23:43.926]  So, do you think, in your opinion, that these globalists are shifting their focus on hurricanes, now that more and more people are talking about
[02:23:46.868 --> 02:23:47.429]  Oh, certainly.
[02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:52.154]  We know they issued fake terror alerts and those didn't work anymore, so they backed off on the new things.
[02:23:52.935 --> 02:23:54.696]  Craig, you want to answer those three questions?
[02:23:55.057 --> 02:23:56.679]  Okay, I couldn't hardly hear him, Alex.
[02:23:57.079 --> 02:23:57.559]  Can you hear me?
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:00.162]  Yeah, number one, we can hear you fine.
[02:24:01.123 --> 02:24:03.466]  Okay, I lost your volume when they switched my line.
[02:24:05.029 --> 02:24:06.530]  Okay, can you hear me now?
[02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:07.011]  Yeah, I got you.
[02:24:07.031 --> 02:24:07.511]  I turned you up.
[02:24:07.531 --> 02:24:07.791]  Go ahead.
[02:24:08.792 --> 02:24:11.795]  No, it's just, do you think Bush is under some type of mind control?
[02:24:12.295 --> 02:24:17.159]  And then number two, how ridiculous is it saying cell phones work at 30,000 feet?
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:24.786]  And then the third question was about, since the terror isn't scaring us anymore, they've shifted into hurricanes.
[02:24:25.446 --> 02:24:27.368]  Well, the first question
[02:24:27.836 --> 02:24:35.958]  Yes, but it doesn't have to be any part of any of the mind control programs, whether it's MKUltra or any of the follow-on programs.
[02:24:36.018 --> 02:24:41.140]  Ultra is supposed to have ended in 1970-something, but that stuff's all been replaced with others.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.202]  No, you don't have to at that level because they believe in what they're doing and they're going to use those as tools.
[02:24:47.422 --> 02:24:48.522]  You don't have to worry about that.
[02:24:48.542 --> 02:24:49.583]  This guy's skull and bones.
[02:24:49.843 --> 02:24:52.143]  I mean, he's involved in all kinds of weird stuff.
[02:24:52.183 --> 02:24:54.044]  Yeah, that's cultural mind control.
[02:24:54.324 --> 02:24:57.405]  Yeah, because they're raised up that way in their families.
[02:24:59.095 --> 02:25:05.834]  They've got this superiority deal of us and them, and their education, their upbringing, their background is a mindset.
[02:25:06.551 --> 02:25:09.532]  And it's the value system that's taught to them.
[02:25:09.672 --> 02:25:11.013]  Just the same thing, you know, you go to L.A.
[02:25:11.073 --> 02:25:17.015]  and you run into a street gang, they've got a different mindset and a different value system, and they believe in doing things the way that they want to.
[02:25:17.035 --> 02:25:18.156]  Well, that's like the mafia.
[02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:20.477]  They all live with each other, go on vacation together.
[02:25:21.217 --> 02:25:22.457]  What they do seems normal.
[02:25:22.597 --> 02:25:23.318]  Right, right.
[02:25:23.358 --> 02:25:29.140]  But it's not brought to them by others on the outside trying to control them because they're in positions of power and authority.
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.742]  They are in control, and this is the way they were brought up.
[02:25:31.762 --> 02:25:34.204]  Yeah, what about the other questions about cell phones?
[02:25:34.244 --> 02:25:37.046]  The cell phones, you know, you're getting into an area I really don't know anything about.
[02:25:37.106 --> 02:25:38.247]  Well, I looked at the studies.
[02:25:39.548 --> 02:25:43.090]  With a normal cell phone, you can't make calls from 30,000 feet.
[02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:44.151]  It's totally ridiculous.
[02:25:44.311 --> 02:25:46.493]  Well, not the kind you carry on your hip.
[02:25:46.553 --> 02:25:49.255]  That's why they've got the earphones on the airplane, because they've got a special antenna.
[02:25:49.395 --> 02:25:51.237]  But it wasn't earphones that made the calls.
[02:25:51.357 --> 02:25:52.418]  No, I realize.
[02:25:52.518 --> 02:25:55.500]  In a regular cell phone, I'm lucky to hit a cell phone tower a mile away.
[02:25:57.005 --> 02:26:01.968]  I don't know how they could have done that, as far as answering that one.
[02:26:02.008 --> 02:26:07.972]  Yeah, and then what about the terror isn't working for them as well anymore, so now they're moving on to other fear-mongering?
[02:26:08.292 --> 02:26:13.215]  Well, I think what it is, the terror works fine, it just has to be reinforced every once in a while.
[02:26:13.275 --> 02:26:15.176]  It says, yeah, see, we told you so, they're back.
[02:26:16.363 --> 02:26:21.287]  These globalists have a huge organization that's compartmentalized.
[02:26:21.628 --> 02:26:24.290]  They've got different tentacles of the octopus that do different things.
[02:26:24.390 --> 02:26:33.919]  One of it deals with terrorism, one of it deals with the economy, one of it deals with banks and money, one of it deals with biological stuff and population control.
[02:26:33.959 --> 02:26:40.025]  You get everything from the Builder Burgers have their thing, the Trilateralists have their thing, but they're all tentacles on the same octopus.
[02:26:40.549 --> 02:26:43.011]  So they don't run out of assets and change their focus.
[02:26:43.071 --> 02:26:48.816]  What they'll do is they'll use something that's working, and then when that doesn't work, because we become numb to it.
[02:26:48.836 --> 02:26:50.097]  Well, it's like a symphony.
[02:26:50.378 --> 02:26:51.118]  Yeah, they just switch.
[02:26:51.679 --> 02:26:55.102]  And you've got a director, but they're just adding more and more instruments.
[02:26:55.322 --> 02:26:55.522]  Right.
[02:26:55.562 --> 02:26:58.104]  Every time we turn around, there's a different barbarian at the gate.
[02:26:58.184 --> 02:27:01.647]  And you have to have fear to get people off dead center to buy your program.
[02:27:01.667 --> 02:27:03.609]  You know, the old Hegelian effect.
[02:27:04.301 --> 02:27:08.443]  And so, if the terrorism deal gets to the point where, okay, we'll take that in stride.
[02:27:08.763 --> 02:27:10.484]  And see, people get numb to things.
[02:27:10.504 --> 02:27:13.445]  When I was in Vietnam, we took combat in stride after a while.
[02:27:13.485 --> 02:27:17.486]  We figured, well, we're here, and we're probably not going to make it home anyway, so why worry about it?
[02:27:17.907 --> 02:27:22.268]  Well, when you get rid of the worry factor, or the fear factor, then it's no longer relevant.
[02:27:22.288 --> 02:27:23.109]  It's just another day.
[02:27:23.169 --> 02:27:23.969]  And they're aware of this.
[02:27:23.989 --> 02:27:25.450]  They call it issue fatigue.
[02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.950]  Right.
[02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:27.871]  They even go, hey, don't have issue fatigue.
[02:27:27.891 --> 02:27:29.091]  Terror is still a threat.
[02:27:29.471 --> 02:27:30.232]  Be scared.
[02:27:30.292 --> 02:27:31.392]  Give us all your freedom.
[02:27:31.632 --> 02:27:32.853]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:27:32.873 --> 02:27:33.313]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.729 --> 02:27:38.737]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:42.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.953 --> 02:27:49.454]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:27:49.614 --> 02:27:53.557]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:27:53.837 --> 02:28:01.161]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste-fill, is something we all face every day.
[02:28:01.421 --> 02:28:03.363]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:28:03.663 --> 02:28:10.427]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:28:10.747 --> 02:28:13.629]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:28:13.909 --> 02:28:19.352]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[02:28:19.612 --> 02:28:20.993]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:21.833 --> 02:28:26.535]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[02:28:26.835 --> 02:28:30.037]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:28:30.397 --> 02:28:34.919]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:35.400]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:38.201 --> 02:28:42.143]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nucalert today.
[02:28:42.323 --> 02:28:42.763]  Nucalert.
[02:28:43.043 --> 02:28:44.123]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:28:45.524 --> 02:28:47.425]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter.
[02:28:47.545 --> 02:28:53.047]  An inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.307 --> 02:29:04.211]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:06.294]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.574 --> 02:29:09.879]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.219 --> 02:29:20.674]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:20.974 --> 02:29:21.475]  That's right!
[02:29:21.655 --> 02:29:28.762]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.062 --> 02:29:33.186]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:29:33.346 --> 02:29:37.811]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.831 --> 02:29:38.311]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.542 --> 02:29:49.343]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:29:49.463 --> 02:29:54.526]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:29:54.766 --> 02:30:00.928]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:30:01.208 --> 02:30:06.851]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:30:07.111 --> 02:30:12.612]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:30:12.852 --> 02:30:16.713]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:30:16.733 --> 02:30:21.994]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:30:22.194 --> 02:30:22.375]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:22.395 --> 02:30:23.355]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[02:30:28.996 --> 02:30:33.199]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[02:30:33.399 --> 02:30:36.301]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:41.404]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[02:30:41.624 --> 02:30:43.946]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!
[02:30:47.299 --> 02:30:52.323]  We're going to go quickly to your calls.
[02:30:52.784 --> 02:30:56.146]  I've got to keep you to one or two questions, folks, because it takes five minutes to answer one.
[02:30:56.186 --> 02:31:00.750]  We're going to run out of time here, and I've got some other questions for Colonel Roberts myself.
[02:31:01.832 --> 02:31:03.793]  Well, we'll be going back to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:03.834 --> 02:31:07.836]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:31:07.876 --> 02:31:16.883]  Before we go back to Colonel Roberts, and we'll tell you how to get some of his excellent books that I've learned a lot from, I'm carrying a new book in our video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:18.324 --> 02:31:19.665]  And I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:31:19.685 --> 02:31:24.448]  You can also call the toll-free number and get it, or send $24.95 in the mail and get a copy of it.
[02:31:24.829 --> 02:31:30.613]  It's Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, full of documents, photos, graphs,
[02:31:32.688 --> 02:31:36.090]  I mean, he's been covering Bilderberg Group for almost 30 years.
[02:31:36.470 --> 02:31:38.852]  What is Bilderberg and why does it matter?
[02:31:39.052 --> 02:31:42.994]  If you've ever heard the word Bilderberg, don't feel as though you're uninformed.
[02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:52.980]  Some of the best-read, most widely-traveled folks on the planet have no knowledge of the organization formerly known by its leadership and members as the Bilderberg Meetings.
[02:31:53.590 --> 02:32:05.578]  For more than 50 years, acting as a global ruling elite, Golderberg's very name and activities remain largely hidden in the shadows, despite its immense clout in directing world affairs, and that most of the heads of media go to it.
[02:32:06.318 --> 02:32:09.100]  And then, for decades, they would deny it exists and say you were a kook.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:10.941]  Now you're a kook if you say it's bad.
[02:32:12.316 --> 02:32:28.864]  Although in 92, Larry Pope, the executive editor of the Asheville, North Carolina Citizen Times newspaper, told one of his readers in a letter that, to my knowledge, such an organization does not exist, and the media conspiracy to keep its existence a secret would be ludicrous.
[02:32:29.617 --> 02:32:31.320]  The evidence shows otherwise.
[02:32:31.801 --> 02:32:42.098]  Now with the release of the Bilderberg Diary by veteran journalist James P. Tucker, Jr., those who never known of Bilderberg will get a first-hand account of its history and its misdeeds.
[02:32:43.570 --> 02:32:50.795]  From the one journalist who has doggedly tailed the Bilderbergs all over the United States and Europe for the last quarter century plus.
[02:32:50.935 --> 02:33:08.707]  Although the mass media in the United States, both print and broadcast, have determinedly suppressed news information about, and the very existence of, Bilderberg, Tucker has established himself as the world's foremost authority on Bilderberg reporting on their intrigues in the pages of the DC-based American Free Press.
[02:33:09.087 --> 02:33:09.807]  And it goes on.
[02:33:10.088 --> 02:33:10.648]  This is just a
[02:33:11.810 --> 02:33:12.671]  A great book.
[02:33:12.711 --> 02:33:14.613]  I read about half of it last week.
[02:33:14.633 --> 02:33:15.293]  We had him on.
[02:33:15.594 --> 02:33:16.374]  We were carrying it.
[02:33:16.775 --> 02:33:18.256]  I finally finished it last night.
[02:33:18.336 --> 02:33:22.740]  And it is an easy read, though it's a thick book.
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:23.621]  I mean, not too thick.
[02:33:24.402 --> 02:33:25.743]  And it's just full.
[02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:27.244]  It's exciting.
[02:33:27.745 --> 02:33:28.726]  You need to have this book.
[02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:30.948]  Go to InfoWars.com to order it.
[02:33:31.028 --> 02:33:33.330]  Take advantage of some of the other deals we've got on videos and books.
[02:33:34.525 --> 02:33:35.486]  Call toll free to get it.
[02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:35.826]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:35.866 --> 02:33:36.606]  Here's that number.
[02:33:36.626 --> 02:33:36.666]  888-253-3139.
[02:33:45.763 --> 02:33:55.350]  Or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:56.831 --> 02:34:10.160]  And while you're at it, get JPFO's, Innocence Betrayed, a video that will deprogram any pro-gun person that thinks that Bush is good, and a video that will deprogram any anti-gun individual
[02:34:11.321 --> 02:34:15.666]  Who doesn't realize what the Second Amendment's really all about.
[02:34:16.247 --> 02:34:26.318]  Or the USS Liberty video that we carry on DVD and VHS documenting how the globalists carry out terror attacks with Israel on our own ship trying to blame Egypt.
[02:34:26.338 --> 02:34:28.861]  I mean, these are the type of videos and books we carry.
[02:34:29.181 --> 02:34:30.403]  You need to have them.
[02:34:31.747 --> 02:34:36.289]  So again, 888-253-3139 or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:44.192]  You can see all my videos online, my weekly TV reports, all my best audio interviews, and so much more at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:44.612 --> 02:34:45.653]  Going back to Colonel Roberts.
[02:34:45.693 --> 02:34:49.594]  Colonel, tell us about RifleWarrior.com and some of your amazing books.
[02:34:50.154 --> 02:34:56.217]  Well, we started out with a small website several years ago and it's grown into some kind of a monster now that's
[02:34:57.335 --> 02:35:00.456]  We've got all of our books listed there.
[02:35:00.476 --> 02:35:04.358]  I've got the Medusa File, which I think is the number one book that everybody ought to have.
[02:35:04.418 --> 02:35:05.958]  Every congressman ought to have it in his library.
[02:35:06.758 --> 02:35:08.999]  It covers crimes and cover-ups of the U.S.
[02:35:09.039 --> 02:35:09.399]  government.
[02:35:09.419 --> 02:35:12.020]  It goes back from World War II all the way up to the T.W.
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:12.020]  800.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:16.602]  It's all cases that I've investigated or worked or been involved with or at least written about.
[02:35:16.782 --> 02:35:19.503]  It's a whole compendium of stuff that's interesting.
[02:35:19.543 --> 02:35:20.283]  We have Killzone.
[02:35:20.791 --> 02:35:35.761]  A sniper looks at Billy Plaza that starts with the Kennedy assassination, and then goes back in time to the 1700s, and follows the power structures up through the ages, all the way through the Vietnam War, and tells you pretty much, you know, follow the money, follow the power, and find out where they're taking us.
[02:35:36.421 --> 02:35:50.190]  And all the other books I've written, the mainstream books, One Shot One Kill, about American combat snipers, the new follow-on book that came out this last year was Killzone, they wanted to use the same title, but this is Killzone, America's Combat Snipers, from Vietnam to Iraq.
[02:35:50.905 --> 02:35:55.507]  And then I've got several other books there that you can scroll down and look through at www.riflewarrior.com.
[02:35:55.807 --> 02:36:07.052]  And I've converted some of these into e-books, so you can buy them with PayPal right there on the site, and it gets emailed to you in a PDF form, and you can read it, print it out, do whatever you want to do with it.
[02:36:07.632 --> 02:36:09.233]  Just don't change it and say, I wrote it.
[02:36:10.933 --> 02:36:12.054]  So all that stuff's there.
[02:36:12.114 --> 02:36:13.714]  I've got a lot of interesting articles there.
[02:36:14.655 --> 02:36:15.555]  A lot of free stuff.
[02:36:16.135 --> 02:36:16.976]  My bio's there.
[02:36:17.576 --> 02:36:18.096]  Check me out.
[02:36:18.136 --> 02:36:19.837]  Find out who I am, where I've been, and where I'm going.
[02:36:20.457 --> 02:36:22.629]  And it's just altogether an interesting, fun site to go to.
[02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:25.630]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:35.237]  And, I mean, again, you've written several best-selling books that weren't about the New World Order, and then you wrote books that were even better than, I would say, your previous books.
[02:36:35.277 --> 02:36:37.179]  But, oh, the big publishers wouldn't touch it.
[02:36:37.219 --> 02:36:40.221]  So, these books deserve to be read, deserve to be seen.
[02:36:40.441 --> 02:36:41.002]  They're excellent.
[02:36:41.022 --> 02:36:41.562]  You need to have them.
[02:36:41.762 --> 02:36:42.903]  Just like my videos, folks.
[02:36:42.923 --> 02:36:45.065]  We don't have David Rockefeller out promoting them.
[02:36:45.325 --> 02:36:53.952]  By the way, David Rockefeller, in his book that came out two years ago, said that he loves Communist China, that he wants a world government, that they are going to take our standard of living.
[02:36:54.452 --> 02:36:58.235]  I was just reading that a few weeks ago, because I've read the quotes online, but I actually bought the book.
[02:36:58.675 --> 02:37:00.636]  I mean, Colonel, I'm sick of it.
[02:37:00.996 --> 02:37:05.159]  They say they want to kill us, they call us slaves, Brzezinski calls us slaves.
[02:37:05.719 --> 02:37:07.080]  I mean, these are best-selling books.
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:08.521]  I'm sick of these people.
[02:37:09.121 --> 02:37:12.123]  I mean, what do you want to say to cops and folks out there that still don't get it?
[02:37:14.272 --> 02:37:16.473]  Folks, cops, you're under attack, too.
[02:37:16.534 --> 02:37:17.674]  You want to say something to them, Craig?
[02:37:18.054 --> 02:37:19.916]  Well, yeah, to everybody in general.
[02:37:19.956 --> 02:37:25.139]  People have to realize that when you climb the pyramid and get to the top, what you find out is there's two powers there.
[02:37:25.159 --> 02:37:26.700]  There's good and evil, God and Satan.
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:28.421]  These people are satanic.
[02:37:28.481 --> 02:37:29.182]  They're occultic.
[02:37:29.262 --> 02:37:30.322]  They're evil.
[02:37:30.923 --> 02:37:35.546]  And they want to destroy the planet and rebuild it in the way they want it to be.
[02:37:36.526 --> 02:37:42.070]  You know, throw God out, throw good out, throw us out, do whatever they have to do to rebuild it to where they get to be the king.
[02:37:42.478 --> 02:37:46.121]  And they get to have their little slaves below them, and everything becomes the second world.
[02:37:46.441 --> 02:37:48.443]  The first world is reduced to the second world status.
[02:37:48.463 --> 02:37:52.185]  The third world, by redistribution of the wealth and education, is brought up to second world status.
[02:37:52.205 --> 02:37:53.847]  And they get to run the whole shoot match.
[02:37:54.187 --> 02:37:55.788]  And you and I are dinosaurs.
[02:37:56.349 --> 02:38:07.557]  And unless we just stand firm, know where our power comes from, and fight against this evil as it sits, they're going to get to the point to where they are able to do that until the second coming.
[02:38:08.575 --> 02:38:12.859]  You know, the Valley of Armageddon could be the Mississippi River Valley.
[02:38:13.179 --> 02:38:14.020]  But it's going to happen.
[02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:15.121]  It's going to happen sooner or later.
[02:38:15.261 --> 02:38:22.987]  And these people, you know, when they go to the military, when they go to law enforcement and they tell you, here's your marching orders, this is what we've got to do.
[02:38:24.128 --> 02:38:26.930]  Go out there and arrest these people who are dissidents.
[02:38:26.970 --> 02:38:29.192]  Go out there and kick their doors in and take their guns.
[02:38:29.252 --> 02:38:30.213]  You do this and you do that.
[02:38:30.793 --> 02:38:34.256]  We, who wear the uniforms, have to turn around and say, no, it's not going to happen.
[02:38:34.676 --> 02:38:35.277]  You want to try it?
[02:38:35.337 --> 02:38:36.598]  You go try it and see what happens.
[02:38:37.265 --> 02:38:46.970]  The one thing, folks, the one thing that terrifies the globalists and the entire world in their whole scheme of plans is one thing, and that's called the Second Amendment to the Constitution in the United States.
[02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:48.851]  We are the last domino.
[02:38:49.231 --> 02:38:51.812]  We are the last ones with a civilian population.
[02:38:51.833 --> 02:38:53.473]  The Earth has already fallen.
[02:38:53.854 --> 02:38:54.874]  The rest of the countries are gone.
[02:38:55.654 --> 02:38:56.035]  They're gone.
[02:38:56.175 --> 02:38:56.615]  They're history.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:38:57.598]  I think?
[02:39:13.044 --> 02:39:14.526]  But they're going to chip away at it.
[02:39:14.646 --> 02:39:17.368]  They are threatened by liberty and freedom and decency.
[02:39:17.408 --> 02:39:22.033]  And Craig, I don't want to get off into a big discussion of this, but people say, well, if I do this, I'll be in danger.
[02:39:22.413 --> 02:39:24.776]  You're in greater danger not fighting this.
[02:39:25.396 --> 02:39:26.978]  People tell me how much courage I've got.
[02:39:27.038 --> 02:39:27.859]  I don't have courage.
[02:39:28.159 --> 02:39:37.108]  I mean, knowing about this evil and not fighting it, I'd really have to be blindly and dumbly have courage to just stupidly sit here and
[02:39:38.926 --> 02:39:39.607]  Let this happen.
[02:39:39.627 --> 02:39:40.507]  You know, I've gotten threats.
[02:39:40.527 --> 02:39:41.127]  You've gotten threats.
[02:39:41.167 --> 02:39:43.109]  I've been physically attacked before and told to shut up.
[02:39:43.289 --> 02:39:46.210]  But, you know, I just stood back up to them and it seemed to freak them out.
[02:39:46.671 --> 02:39:55.456]  But, uh, and you know, lately, uh, we've gotten intel about, we even know the names of the people high up in private corporations saying they got to shut me down.
[02:40:08.936 --> 02:40:10.518]  I don't know.
[02:40:58.747 --> 02:41:00.188]  Alright, folks, we're back live.
[02:41:00.788 --> 02:41:03.989]  I don't know exactly when I got cut out, but I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:41:04.009 --> 02:41:04.829]  They're up in Minnesota.
[02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:13.352]  And the exact thing I was bringing up is something we don't want to get into too much details on, but the threats, the rest of it, and every time I talk about this, this happens.
[02:41:14.153 --> 02:41:23.736]  And we have moles inside their own organizations, and a very high-level group involved in this whole infrastructure, kind of a Merck group, was saying that I've got to be, quote, taken down.
[02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:29.591]  And the intel we got was that was both technical and could be physical.
[02:41:29.771 --> 02:41:32.412]  And Craig Roberts, you want to... Boy, that is really weird.
[02:41:32.512 --> 02:41:35.053]  I started talking about that and we got cut out, Craig.
[02:41:35.333 --> 02:41:38.814]  As soon as you said, they're trying to take me down, we went to squelch.
[02:41:38.834 --> 02:41:41.175]  So, yeah.
[02:41:42.035 --> 02:41:43.595]  They're just letting us know, aren't they?
[02:41:43.635 --> 02:41:47.997]  Yeah, I think that was a little subtle hint that we're here, we're listening, and yes, it's true.
[02:41:49.146 --> 02:41:49.867]  I think that's great.
[02:41:49.887 --> 02:41:51.687]  That doesn't intimidate us, does it?
[02:41:51.767 --> 02:41:54.929]  Well, I think I've got to do it again, because it makes a point, you know.
[02:41:55.189 --> 02:42:09.856]  When I wrote the book, JFK, The Dead Witnesses, I tried to... I was working on my book, Killzone, and I wanted to interview people who were around the assassination of JFK, and when I started trying to track these people down for primary source interviews, I found out that most of them were dead.
[02:42:09.896 --> 02:42:15.698]  Well, then I got curious as to how many, and how did they die, and did it have anything to do with the assassination?
[02:42:15.738 --> 02:42:17.039]  It turned out a lot of them did.
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:28.967]  And they died just before they were to testify at one of the three major investigations in the assassination, whether it was the Senate, whether it was the Warren, or the other one.
[02:42:29.867 --> 02:42:40.013]  Just before, they would commit suicide, or they would have a one-car accident, or they'd fall off the roof of a building, or get hacked up by a machete, or whatever, and they could declare it suicide.
[02:42:40.374 --> 02:42:42.695]  Bottom line was, the people who lived
[02:42:43.194 --> 02:42:44.575]  Were the ones who talked.
[02:42:44.936 --> 02:42:46.357]  The ones who went public.
[02:42:46.417 --> 02:42:47.518]  The ones who stood up.
[02:42:47.578 --> 02:42:49.399]  The ones who got their name in the paper.
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:51.801]  Because they became too high profile then.
[02:42:52.042 --> 02:42:57.586]  You couldn't go around knocking these people off because it reinforced whatever it was that they had to say.
[02:42:57.606 --> 02:42:58.227]  Well let me stop.
[02:42:58.547 --> 02:42:59.828]  So the answer is have courage.
[02:42:59.868 --> 02:43:00.649]  That's what protects you.
[02:43:00.669 --> 02:43:01.770]  But let's be specific.
[02:43:02.170 --> 02:43:03.591]  Let's talk to these guys out there.
[02:43:03.651 --> 02:43:06.113]  And by the way dummies, we even know your names, okay?
[02:43:06.534 --> 02:43:08.075]  So you really need to watch it.
[02:43:08.095 --> 02:43:08.956]  You need to look around you.
[02:43:09.216 --> 02:43:11.238]  Because we've got people right there next to you right now.
[02:43:11.818 --> 02:43:12.458]  Understand that.
[02:43:12.478 --> 02:43:15.400]  And Craig, I don't even know... Well, you don't want to get... Craig's one of them.
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:16.120]  I won't get into it.
[02:43:16.341 --> 02:43:21.163]  The point is, is that's not some stunt, folks, with the network just cutting off right there.
[02:43:21.183 --> 02:43:24.225]  I mean, this deals with ISDN lines, satellites.
[02:43:24.245 --> 02:43:27.166]  I mean, this is massive, and we know this is going on.
[02:43:27.947 --> 02:43:33.970]  But, I mean, Craig, you want to talk directly to these psychopaths, guaranteed to be some type of weirdo New Agers?
[02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:36.071]  I mean, you want to talk to them about what's wrong with them?
[02:43:37.532 --> 02:43:39.594]  The issue is... Go ahead, talk directly to him.
[02:43:39.634 --> 02:43:40.034]  Go ahead.
[02:43:40.094 --> 02:43:56.205]  The issue is, you know, when you sit there and you work for a cell someplace that has the marching orders to shut down somebody who's exercising the rights under the First Amendment because they're getting too close to the truth or because you don't want anybody to hear what they have to say, you're just committing treason.
[02:43:56.866 --> 02:44:01.829]  You might as well just roll over and say, I'm the enemy, I'm the bad guy, but that's okay, devil take me away.
[02:44:02.169 --> 02:44:03.110]  That's what's happening.
[02:44:03.430 --> 02:44:07.073]  And until you stand up against that and say, I'm not going to be part of this, this is scary,
[02:44:07.549 --> 02:44:18.898]  If you want to be a little, you know, mind-controlled robot and push buttons and take people off the air and threaten them, or like me, put dead animals in my mailbox and leave bullets on my front door and, you know, I mean, just stupid things like that.
[02:44:18.918 --> 02:44:21.681]  They're too cowardly to come out and face me up front.
[02:44:21.761 --> 02:44:25.924]  But I mean, they're masters cold-blooded animals and are horrible!
[02:44:26.044 --> 02:44:28.266]  It's not even... Don't they love their children?
[02:44:28.306 --> 02:44:29.387]  I guess they don't have children.
[02:44:29.607 --> 02:44:32.730]  Well, you know, there are people out there who have no souls.
[02:44:33.210 --> 02:44:35.693]  And that's what Marina Oswald said, by the way, in Russia.
[02:44:35.733 --> 02:44:39.476]  The reason they got away with a lot of the things they did, they simply had no souls.
[02:44:39.516 --> 02:44:40.437]  They were just robots.
[02:44:41.498 --> 02:44:44.661]  And you mentioned something earlier, and I want to go back to that.
[02:44:44.722 --> 02:44:45.943]  You said, how can these people
[02:44:46.761 --> 02:44:50.402]  Sit there and do nothing because they're afraid that something's going to happen to them.
[02:44:50.742 --> 02:45:05.346]  And I go back and I look in the 1950s when I can remember seeing my first concentration camp black and white footage of all these Jews that were lined up at Buchenwald and Treblinka and Auschwitz marching up to be executed in line.
[02:45:06.749 --> 02:45:09.211]  I mean, I would fight those sons of bitches!
[02:45:09.271 --> 02:45:10.612]  Yeah, I mean, what's the deal here?
[02:45:10.692 --> 02:45:15.056]  I mean, I was sitting there looking at that going, why is not one of these guys jumping a guard?
[02:45:15.136 --> 02:45:17.538]  Why isn't he at least going down first?
[02:45:17.798 --> 02:45:18.819]  They should all rush!
[02:45:18.899 --> 02:45:20.320]  Oh, it's incredible.
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.824]  I know, but that's what we call the cowherd mentality.
[02:45:25.124 --> 02:45:31.970]  Follow the person in front, do as you're told, don't make any waves, and maybe, just maybe, you'll get out of it.
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:38.102]  Or, they've absolutely given up, and they say, I'm gonna die, that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:45:38.222 --> 02:45:44.584]  I just, you know, but the incredible thing is I know some of these globalist minions, and they go get the vaccines, they drink Diet Coke with aspartame.
[02:45:44.604 --> 02:45:49.366]  I mean, they just, it's like they just love it.
[02:45:49.726 --> 02:45:50.486]  I don't understand it.
[02:45:52.103 --> 02:45:53.505]  I mean, they even hurt themselves.
[02:45:53.585 --> 02:45:54.606]  I don't understand these people.
[02:45:54.766 --> 02:45:58.391]  Well, a lot of them don't understand what the issue is.
[02:45:58.971 --> 02:46:00.012]  They haven't been... What do they do?
[02:46:00.053 --> 02:46:03.897]  Just feed them ADL garbage and then just tell them to... I don't understand it.
[02:46:04.117 --> 02:46:10.605]  Well, it's impossible to understand because it makes no rhyme or reason or logic, but they're just out there and they're doing the devil's bidding.
[02:46:11.155 --> 02:46:16.038]  And sometimes they wake up and figure it out, but most of the time they don't.
[02:46:16.358 --> 02:46:19.019]  Doesn't it at certain levels just boil down to criminality?
[02:46:19.179 --> 02:46:20.000]  They're mercenaries?
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:20.820]  Absolutely.
[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:22.601]  It's evil, it's satanic, it's criminal.
[02:46:23.121 --> 02:46:23.982]  And they're involved in it.
[02:46:24.382 --> 02:46:27.543]  And they're trying to do what the Bible told us is going to happen.
[02:46:29.244 --> 02:46:30.345]  That it's the bad guy doing it.
[02:46:30.625 --> 02:46:31.586]  It's the dragon doing it.
[02:46:31.686 --> 02:46:32.386]  And they're helping him.
[02:46:33.786 --> 02:46:37.549]  But you couldn't take these people and open a Bible and show it to them.
[02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:39.051]  You couldn't show them Bible prophecy.
[02:46:39.371 --> 02:46:40.152]  They don't believe in it.
[02:46:40.232 --> 02:46:42.193]  They say, well, you know, that's all garbage.
[02:46:42.213 --> 02:46:42.954]  That's just a bunch of people.
[02:46:42.974 --> 02:46:44.015]  Well, that's a big part of it.
[02:46:44.055 --> 02:46:52.802]  They think this life is it, and they think they've got to get as much as they can now, and Katie barred the door, and they're just pathetic, and they're so unhappy, too, Greg.
[02:46:52.882 --> 02:46:53.382]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:53.882 --> 02:46:55.704]  They have no personal accountability.
[02:46:56.124 --> 02:46:56.985]  You know, when I was a kid,
[02:46:57.569 --> 02:46:58.329]  They would scare us.
[02:46:58.469 --> 02:47:02.230]  If they caught you running in the hall or chewing gum at school, they'd tell you you're going to go burn in hell.
[02:47:02.290 --> 02:47:05.451]  Well, that would scare me, and I'd quit chewing gum, and I would quit running in the hall.
[02:47:05.731 --> 02:47:09.492]  To that, today, that doesn't seem to bother anybody anymore because they don't think it exists.
[02:47:10.112 --> 02:47:11.373]  So, you know, what do you do?
[02:47:12.193 --> 02:47:13.053]  Let's take a call.
[02:47:13.133 --> 02:47:13.913]  Dave in Michigan.
[02:47:13.933 --> 02:47:16.634]  Thanks for holding, and then we'll talk to Carol and Ian and Tom.
[02:47:16.814 --> 02:47:17.354]  Gotta hurry.
[02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:17.915]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:47:17.935 --> 02:47:18.755]  Yeah, what's up, Colonel?
[02:47:19.275 --> 02:47:23.176]  Hey, they've got a new form of terror they're marketing up here in Alpena, Michigan next week.
[02:47:23.816 --> 02:47:26.677]  They've got an emergency drive-thru vaccination
[02:47:27.310 --> 02:47:28.150]  Demonstration.
[02:47:29.211 --> 02:47:39.076]  Where you call up, you make an appointment, and drive up in your car, and you can't leave your automobile, you have to stick your arm out the window while they stick a needle in it and give you a flu shot.
[02:47:40.496 --> 02:47:43.958]  Now is this going to be real vaccine, or is this a practice emergency management deal?
[02:47:44.298 --> 02:47:47.520]  I guess it's real vaccine, but who knows what's in those vials?
[02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:50.881]  And they admit that the current flu shot doesn't even cover the new avian flu.
[02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:54.063]  They admit that on the news, but these idiots still run out to get it.
[02:47:54.617 --> 02:48:00.282]  I'll tell you, the best way to get the flu just like your mother there is to take the shot, stand in line with a bunch of sick people.
[02:48:01.863 --> 02:48:03.765]  That's just absolutely incredible.
[02:48:04.246 --> 02:48:05.926]  But you know, they're doing this all over the country.
[02:48:05.986 --> 02:48:12.048]  They're having emergency management exercises where they have what they call mass inoculation exercises.
[02:48:12.068 --> 02:48:13.188]  They have them at Walmarts.
[02:48:13.609 --> 02:48:24.252]  And they had one here, and what they did is they ran everybody in the local high school through and gave them a piece of candy instead of a pill, and then they wrote it up as statistics, but it worked.
[02:48:24.412 --> 02:48:24.992]  Everybody came.
[02:48:25.152 --> 02:48:26.552]  Yeah, that's what they do at Walmarts.
[02:48:26.592 --> 02:48:28.333]  In the parking lot, they give you jelly beans.
[02:48:28.953 --> 02:48:29.413]  Oh, boy.
[02:48:30.971 --> 02:48:32.333]  Anything else, uh, there, Dave?
[02:48:32.473 --> 02:48:36.378]  Well, this deal we're talking about, you know, setting up the military to stop the flu from coming in here?
[02:48:36.799 --> 02:48:42.066]  How come they let 300 truckloads of garbage come in here from Canada every day to be dumped in Michigan?
[02:48:42.086 --> 02:48:42.707]  I hear ya.
[02:48:45.487 --> 02:48:52.314]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.634 --> 02:48:54.016]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.216 --> 02:48:56.418]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.558 --> 02:48:58.660]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.921 --> 02:49:03.886]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.206 --> 02:49:08.230]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.470 --> 02:49:10.251]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.331 --> 02:49:20.977]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.118 --> 02:49:23.019]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:02.503]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:02.583 --> 02:50:13.909]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:14.489 --> 02:50:21.352]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:21.732 --> 02:50:23.872]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:24.373 --> 02:50:29.334]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[02:52:03.138 --> 02:52:03.878]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:52:03.898 --> 02:52:05.379]  Let's jam a few final calls in here.
[02:52:05.419 --> 02:52:07.339]  I apologize for making you wait forever.
[02:52:07.359 --> 02:52:08.680]  We're running out of time.
[02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:10.141]  Carol in Ohio.
[02:52:10.181 --> 02:52:10.861]  Go ahead, Carol.
[02:52:12.887 --> 02:52:14.208]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:14.268 --> 02:52:16.929]  Yeah, I'm glad the New World Order punks are listening.
[02:52:17.029 --> 02:52:21.591]  If we have to, if we run out of guns, we'll use our skillets and our rolling pins.
[02:52:21.651 --> 02:52:29.095]  And Craig, your articles on newswithviews.com are a masterful, concise overview of what's happening.
[02:52:29.235 --> 02:52:35.298]  And I just finished printing off a thousand copies for gun shows and distributions.
[02:52:35.338 --> 02:52:37.399]  There are things that people can do out there.
[02:52:37.939 --> 02:52:38.960]  And I made
[02:52:40.447 --> 02:52:47.052]  Also, Alex, on your good videos, information to get those and stuff.
[02:52:47.432 --> 02:52:49.653]  And this is what Americans can do.
[02:52:49.733 --> 02:52:53.976]  We don't have Rockefeller behind us, but we've got John Q. Public.
[02:52:54.036 --> 02:52:56.298]  And I just want to thank both you and Craig.
[02:52:56.318 --> 02:52:58.039]  You're both my favorite people.
[02:52:58.747 --> 02:52:59.768]  And God bless you.
[02:53:00.168 --> 02:53:01.068]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:53:01.088 --> 02:53:05.190]  Now, thank you, and no, no, I'd rather have John Q. Buhami than Rockefeller.
[02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:08.391]  Look, I mean, you know the Special Forces model better than I do, Craig.
[02:53:08.631 --> 02:53:10.052]  It's that force multiplication.
[02:53:10.092 --> 02:53:15.654]  It's the indigenous population is a dynamo that once it gets turned on, it can't be stopped.
[02:53:16.294 --> 02:53:25.858]  Well, you know, the New World Order crowd are a bunch of elitists who live behind walls, inside big fancy houses, and they worry about their bank accounts and who's going to be more powerful tomorrow.
[02:53:26.408 --> 02:53:27.548]  And they feel surrounded.
[02:53:27.588 --> 02:53:28.969]  They feel threatened by us.
[02:53:30.149 --> 02:53:30.990]  That's the whole thing.
[02:53:31.530 --> 02:53:39.813]  The whole power gig is not because they want to control everything so much as they feel that they are threatened by the rest of the world because we don't want to go along with what they want.
[02:53:39.913 --> 02:53:42.194]  They're a bunch of control freaks, you're right.
[02:53:42.614 --> 02:53:43.915]  Ian and Ontario, then Tom.
[02:53:43.995 --> 02:53:44.575]  Ian, go ahead.
[02:53:46.833 --> 02:53:47.114]  Alex?
[02:53:47.374 --> 02:53:48.375]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:48.495 --> 02:54:00.605]  Earlier this week a woman called describing her opportunity to question Rumsfeld about 70,000 M113 armored personnel carriers pre-positioned in the U.S.
[02:54:00.925 --> 02:54:03.527]  I guess for foreign troops in that future crisis event.
[02:54:04.007 --> 02:54:08.451]  Would Colonel Craig Roberts please comment on these pre-positioned assets?
[02:54:09.372 --> 02:54:10.873]  Well, actually they're not pre-positioned.
[02:54:10.913 --> 02:54:11.754]  They're in storage.
[02:54:11.814 --> 02:54:13.675]  They're left over from the 80s.
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:18.902]  And actually they're scheduled to be destroyed because they're scrapped out.
[02:54:18.942 --> 02:54:27.765]  The problem is, you know, in the real world, switching horses, those things should be in Baghdad now instead of up-armored Humvees.
[02:54:28.025 --> 02:54:30.586]  Those things ought to be going overseas to protect the troops, and they're not.
[02:54:30.626 --> 02:54:31.547]  They're sitting over here.
[02:54:31.567 --> 02:54:35.788]  A lot of them could be used, you know, in a heartbeat.
[02:54:35.828 --> 02:54:37.609]  All you've got to do is take them out of mothballs.
[02:54:37.969 --> 02:54:39.210]  But they weren't pre-positioned here.
[02:54:39.270 --> 02:54:40.210]  They've always been here.
[02:54:40.774 --> 02:54:41.014]  Right.
[02:54:42.155 --> 02:54:47.500]  Are the Chinese using their Costco shipping network to ship?
[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:51.523]  Sir, they were caught in 97 shipping in rockets and machine guns.
[02:54:51.563 --> 02:54:52.223]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:52.504 --> 02:54:52.704]  Right.
[02:54:52.984 --> 02:54:54.225]  Shannon, West Virginia.
[02:54:54.265 --> 02:54:54.725]  Last caller.
[02:54:54.765 --> 02:54:55.426]  Go ahead, Sam.
[02:54:56.487 --> 02:54:56.887]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:57.127 --> 02:54:58.929]  It's a privilege to speak to you, too.
[02:55:00.030 --> 02:55:03.673]  Most of what I want to say was I encourage everybody to get Craig's book, Medusafile.
[02:55:03.693 --> 02:55:04.633]  That book is incredible.
[02:55:05.934 --> 02:55:06.595]  It is a good book.
[02:55:06.615 --> 02:55:07.135]  Yeah, I've got it.
[02:55:07.336 --> 02:55:08.076]  It's a great book.
[02:55:08.556 --> 02:55:10.218]  And I really appreciate what the two of you are doing.
[02:55:11.144 --> 02:55:14.870]  Also, I went to the Info Wars and looked for some videos.
[02:55:14.890 --> 02:55:18.216]  There's a video that Craig's on that I went to a seminar with him in West Virginia here.
[02:55:18.236 --> 02:55:20.560]  It's put up by Butch Paul called Exposing the Beast.
[02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:22.143]  I was wondering if you carried that or not?
[02:55:22.904 --> 02:55:24.545]  You know, I mean to carry a lot of other stuff.
[02:55:24.565 --> 02:55:30.287]  There's hundreds of things I want to cover, and I'm just so busy working all the time, I never get a chance to end up carrying them on the site.
[02:55:30.327 --> 02:55:36.930]  But Craig is in my video, Matrix of Evil, in a speech, part of a speech he gave in Kansas City that we put on.
[02:55:36.970 --> 02:55:37.891]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:37.911 --> 02:55:38.771]  We're out of time, Sam.
[02:55:39.451 --> 02:55:41.372]  Craig Roberts, thank you for coming on with us today.
[02:55:41.712 --> 02:55:44.814]  Well, let's see everybody over at RifleWarrior.com and Prism Plant TV.
[02:55:45.876 --> 02:55:46.716]  You bet, my friend.
[02:55:46.996 --> 02:55:47.376]  You know what?
[02:55:47.456 --> 02:55:49.337]  I think we're winning this fight with God's help.
[02:55:49.637 --> 02:55:51.657]  I think we really do have them on the run.
[02:55:51.917 --> 02:55:53.278]  Well, I think we've taken first blood.
[02:55:53.298 --> 02:55:55.758]  Now we're going to see what they do once we beard the tiger and he's thin.
[02:55:55.778 --> 02:55:56.938]  All right.
[02:55:56.978 --> 02:55:57.738]  Take care, my friend.
[02:55:59.039 --> 02:56:01.779]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:01.859 --> 02:56:05.100]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:07.700]  Lots of great guests coming on tomorrow.
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:08.681]  More guests next week.
[02:56:09.081 --> 02:56:12.161]  My producer's going hog wild, lining up all these great guests.
[02:56:12.181 --> 02:56:15.062]  I want to thank all the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners.
[02:56:16.347 --> 02:56:21.071]  Folks at the network running things and our friends over there that have been threatening us.
[02:56:21.231 --> 02:56:22.072]  God bless you too.
[02:56:22.412 --> 02:56:24.574]  Take care.
[02:56:25.214 --> 02:56:30.098]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
