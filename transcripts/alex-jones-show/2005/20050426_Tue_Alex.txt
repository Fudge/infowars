[00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:06.397]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.098]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:09.919]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.420]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.021]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:17.624]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.988]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:25.738]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:30.722]  It is Tuesday, the 26th day of April, 2005.
[00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:32.943]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:37.466]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout this transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:44.211]  No matter if you're in Mexico, Canada, England, right here in the United States, you're all welcome to call us.
[00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:50.576]  We've even gotten calls before from McMurtle Weather Station in Antarctica.
[00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:51.495]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:58.618]  1-800-259-9231 is the total free number to join us.
[00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:04.360]  We'll go to your calls early in this first hour, probably near the end of the next segment.
[00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.361]  Where to start?
[00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:09.722]  I mean, there is just so much.
[00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.583]  There's a bunch of news that because I had a
[00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:21.990]  A couple guests on yesterday I didn't get to that I'd like to go over that we never spent any time on, like abortion staff ignores baby born alive!
[00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:29.238]  But it's okay, I mean... The government and the police say it's alright.
[00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:30.099]  That's okay.
[00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:42.919]  Bush urges Saudis to boost oil production, but that's only on the surface, and then there he was at Crawford yesterday, gripping hands and walking like the Crown Prince was his boyfriend or something.
[00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:53.125]  I mean, it never ends, how quackish it looks, just how transparent this is.
[00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:00.229]  So meeting his longtime Saudi ally, his little
[00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:01.868]  His little buddy.
[00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:14.894]  Consumer confidence drops for the third month in a row as inflation begins to boil out of control, but the media tells you that there's really no problem with inflation, that it's a good thing.
[00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.116]  Some fear law would create National ID Card.
[00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:20.436]  Here is the Boston Globe.
[00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:29.180]  They're still trying to pass the expansion of the National ID Card through the Senate right now and pushing it as a way to stop illegal aliens.
[00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:50.568]  Three months ago, Ron Paul analyzed the Senate and House bills, and we posted the bills and his analysis, and clearly it makes it easier for illegal aliens, and creates just the most horrible facets of an ID card, creates the mechanisms to implement that.
[00:02:51.914 --> 00:03:01.324]  But here are the neocon publications like the Washington Times telling us how great it is and how it will stop the illegal aliens.
[00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:07.210]  And meanwhile, Clear Channel is putting up billboards that say that California is Mexico.
[00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.275]  Of course, Clear Channel also puts up billboards saying that Bush is our dear leader.
[00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:15.739]  I mean, it's like we're North Korea or something now.
[00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.180]  Why is Clear Channel doing this?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.142]  Because they're following the orders of the New York banks.
[00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:31.709]  Bringing America down is the job of the New World Order, and the controlled media, the neocon media, is there ensuring that that job is implemented.
[00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:40.435]  Also, Taiwan's nationalist leader, Lin, becomes first to visit mainland China since 1949.
[00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:51.983]  Republican leadership seeks to ensconce judicial tyranny, this is by Chuck Baldwin, and they're trying to restrict filibusters.
[00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:57.005]  So you can't have your free speech, so you can't block legislation.
[00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:07.010]  The Founding Fathers put that in so that tyranny could be blocked, so that honorable people with courage could be obstructionists.
[00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.950]  That's a good thing.
[00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.011]  Riblock is good.
[00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.432]  That's why we have separation of powers.
[00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:13.293]  You don't want
[00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.041]  The central government or a group of senators setting up their own tyranny.
[00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:20.622]  That's happening now.
[00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:27.544]  A police chief has taken the microchip and he thinks his police officer should take it.
[00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:32.026]  This time it's not the Mexican Attorney General ordering his employees to do it.
[00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.267]  No, it's right here in America.
[00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:37.368]  Ender with Al Qaeda if you're against taking the chip.
[00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:41.639]  Florida planning son of the Matrix program.
[00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:45.722]  Yes, it's really called the Matrix and they never canceled it.
[00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:47.504]  The Matrix.
[00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:49.105]  It's a big joke.
[00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.027]  There is so much more coming up.
[00:04:52.148 --> 00:04:54.690]  I will jump into all the news on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.112]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[00:04:58.433 --> 00:04:58.873]  Check them out.
[00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:07.948]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:09.630]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.033]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:14.275]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:19.500]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.865]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:25.887]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:36.619]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.642]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:42.725]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:44.386]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:44.786]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:47.208]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:48.269]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.290]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.553]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.673 --> 00:06:09.555]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:16.360]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.542]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:22.143]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:30.169]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:41.738]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:41.898 --> 00:06:48.544]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.564 --> 00:06:48.764]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:50.145]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.731]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:06.832]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.152 --> 00:07:07.953]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:12.494]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.734 --> 00:07:16.936]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:22.178]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:26.142]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:31.667]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:34.690]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.871]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:46.922]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:57.206]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:05.970]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.591]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:30.672]  Alright, second segment, eight minutes, twenty-seven seconds into broadcast.
[00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:32.593]  Wide open phones today.
[00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:40.835]  Any issue, any news item, any topic, any question, comment, you've got zero censorship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:43.243]  You're welcome to join us.
[00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.564]  I love all the different directions the callers take us.
[00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:54.546]  All the different news reports that they bring up that the general public is not aware of.
[00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:56.846]  I mean, here's one.
[00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:10.129]  I've got a little AP report here about how Ford is moving quite a bit of its production plants for parts for engines
[00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:16.570]  and other areas of other components of vehicles to China!
[00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.090]  Communist China!
[00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.931]  Command and Control China!
[00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:32.673]  I mean already most the parts you get for your Ford or Chevy or Dodge are made in Japan or Taiwan or Mexico but even those countries are going to lose their jobs!
[00:09:32.713 --> 00:09:40.995]  It's all going to China with a billion three hundred plus million slave population
[00:09:41.952 --> 00:09:51.799]  And the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, in their public statements, in their own white papers, have said that America is going to be basically shut down economically.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.462]  Using environmental laws, they're going to take basically all the middle classes' private property.
[00:09:57.623 --> 00:10:06.029]  We are going to be basically a servant class of the New World Order, and a larger part of Latin America, a huge serf population.
[00:10:07.154 --> 00:10:09.855]  Europe is going to be predominantly de-industrialized.
[00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:15.997]  They're going to bring in the populations from the Middle East and other areas, Africa, Asia there as well.
[00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:18.938]  They'll be brought down to second world status.
[00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:20.198]  That's their term for it.
[00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:29.882]  And China will be the capital of the world with forced abortion, infanticide, genetic engineering, and implanted microchip population.
[00:10:31.302 --> 00:10:33.443]  The deal was made decades ago.
[00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:39.663]  That's why they've been given the Panama Canal and many of our old military bases in the Caribbean.
[00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:42.344]  This is the stated program.
[00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:44.884]  And you're going to have your guns taken.
[00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.725]  Most of you will not be able to afford driving a car.
[00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:50.046]  You're going to be transpondered and taxed.
[00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:54.147]  And most of us will be forcibly psychologically tested.
[00:10:54.207 --> 00:10:55.607]  Many of us forcibly drugged.
[00:10:55.927 --> 00:10:57.007]  Official federal plan.
[00:10:57.988 --> 00:11:04.049]  And there will be national drafts that they call, of course, conscription.
[00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:07.092]  And this is what we're looking forward to.
[00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:11.393]  Oh, before I forget, before I get into all the news, I've just got to say this.
[00:11:11.913 --> 00:11:25.658]  I was driving to the office to do my radio show, and this is just about 30 minutes ago, and an Austin Police Department police car, 4380.
[00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:29.979]  Because I know Internal Affairs won't do anything about it, and
[00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:37.009]  You guys could basically do whatever you wanted to and be worshipped for it, so I'm just going to say this on air.
[00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:37.009]  $43.80.
[00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.853]  And we defend police when we do the right thing, and we defended them here on this broadcast locally, but $43.80.
[00:11:44.014 --> 00:11:48.337]  You know, you deserve a $500 ticket.
[00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:59.845]  I'm driving, and on William Cannon, you go over a little hill and up a bigger hill, and there's like a grassy
[00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:11.407]  A grassy area there behind some trees that most mornings the police are there, most evenings, about 24 hours a day, running a speed trap.
[00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:17.269]  It's a major thoroughfare, so a lot of people who aren't on the road often drive down it and don't know the police are there.
[00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:19.089]  And I've watched them.
[00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:23.910]  If you're going about 6-7 miles over the speed limit, the speed limit's 40, they pull you over.
[00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:36.127]  And I'm tired of watching the motorcycles and the squad cars pull out in front of people, because the trees come to within about six, seven feet of the sidewalk.
[00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.690]  And then there's grass on the other side, so you can't see the police cars.
[00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.211]  And they just jump out into traffic.
[00:12:42.832 --> 00:12:54.701]  So every time I see this, from now on, just at this one spot, just kind of a little test to see if we can get the word to them to stop endangering people's lives, including their own, I'm going to report the police that are driving recklessly.
[00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:57.861]  So, I got two cars in front of me.
[00:12:58.662 --> 00:13:03.465]  I've got about five car lengths, so I'm about 40, 50 yards back.
[00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.747]  And here comes this police car.
[00:13:06.127 --> 00:13:08.589]  And I was expecting to see it, because you normally do.
[00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:11.011]  Jump out in front of cars.
[00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:18.376]  I mean, just flies out, literally, no more than 15, maybe 10 feet in front of these cars.
[00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:19.737]  These cars swam on their brakes.
[00:13:20.954 --> 00:13:46.783]  Almost come together, one of the cars tries to go into the other lane, comes within an inch, going about 40 miles an hour, of smashing into a pickup truck, the little Honda Civic in front of me, and the cop goes flying down the road, swerving in front of the, he didn't just come into one lane, the left lane, he jumps across into the right lane, almost hitting the pickup truck, and then speeds towards the pickup truck that he pulled over and gave a ticket.
[00:13:48.164 --> 00:13:48.945]  I'm tired of it!
[00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.067]  If I did that, I'd get a reckless driving charge, and I should.
[00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:58.953]  You, 4380, of course, are God, according to the government and the media, so you can do no wrong.
[00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:00.234]  I'm sick of it!
[00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:02.456]  I don't want to have wrecks!
[00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:06.099]  I'm tired of dodging you people almost every morning!
[00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:09.262]  I see it every morning.
[00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:09.982]  Maybe that's not true.
[00:14:10.002 --> 00:14:14.866]  Maybe every two weeks they pull out in front of me, or pull out in front of cars, and the cars all swerve.
[00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:15.987]  I mean, you've got a cop.
[00:14:16.327 --> 00:14:16.768]  Cops.
[00:14:17.412 --> 00:14:27.794]  Parking literally right behind trees and bushes where no one can see them, with the tip of their car obscured, and then just jumping out!
[00:14:29.055 --> 00:14:34.556]  There was no reason you could have waited, pulled out behind other cars, gone and gotten the person that was speeding.
[00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.177]  Stop jumping out in front of us!
[00:14:37.317 --> 00:14:39.997]  I'm tired of it!
[00:14:40.017 --> 00:14:40.858]  43.80 this morning did it. 43.80!
[00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:47.444]  And I'm going to encourage you, when you see police driving recklessly, call.
[00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.664]  And call the newspaper, too.
[00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:51.005]  And write down their numbers.
[00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:51.525]  And you know what?
[00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:57.928]  I think I'm going to get video cameras, and I think I'm going to go stakeout, and I think I'm going to do a TV show.
[00:14:57.968 --> 00:14:58.788]  I wish I had time.
[00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:03.731]  I want to do a show about how 90% of the buses have almost no one on them.
[00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:07.672]  I mean, usually, probably 80% of the time, you don't even see but one person on a bus.
[00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:09.833]  I want to do a show on that.
[00:15:10.374 --> 00:15:11.174]  I've never had time.
[00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:20.362]  Well, actually, one time we went out for like 30 minutes and showed about 15 buses with one or two people on each one of them, a few of them were empty, during rush hour, by the way.
[00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:26.425]  So, actually, I have done one of those shows, but I want to do a big program on it, you know, for the TV show.
[00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.988]  But perhaps I'll go stake you out.
[00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:34.090]  Perhaps I'll go hide in the bushes and videotape you driving recklessly.
[00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.533]  And I will zoom in on your tags, I will zoom in on your numbers, and I will put it on TV!
[00:15:39.682 --> 00:15:41.023]  Now you... I'm serious!
[00:15:41.123 --> 00:15:42.823]  Stop driving recklessly!
[00:15:43.204 --> 00:15:44.164]  I'm tired of it!
[00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.986]  I got better things to do than to deal with this!
[00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:50.827]  But I'm sick of it!
[00:15:51.547 --> 00:15:54.369]  I'm tired of police cars jumping out in front of me!
[00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.390]  You are not God!
[00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.010]  And here's the deal.
[00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:03.613]  In Europe, even in some of the western states in this country, you can drive as fast as you want.
[00:16:04.353 --> 00:16:07.775]  Unless it's reckless and then it's pretty serious fines or charges.
[00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.617]  And that's the way it should be.
[00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:17.383]  You shouldn't be out there slinking around on a road designed to drive 60 on giving people tickets if they go 47 miles an hour.
[00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:19.865]  But I've never complained about that.
[00:16:20.886 --> 00:16:22.067]  But what's the greater evil?
[00:16:22.908 --> 00:16:31.655]  The police like great white sharks feeding on tuna with their motorcycles and cars up and down William Cannon every day and night?
[00:16:32.876 --> 00:16:36.239]  Pulling out in front of people perpetually endangering themselves and us?
[00:16:37.074 --> 00:16:40.977]  Or is it more dangerous to have somebody driving 47 miles an hour?
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.723]  So please, and I, you know, who knows, this officer might even be a fan of the show.
[00:16:47.743 --> 00:16:49.344]  You know, I'm sorry if that's the case.
[00:16:49.484 --> 00:16:52.267]  I get pulled over speeding and the police continue to let me go.
[00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:54.849]  Which, uh, I think is very nice.
[00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:59.212]  I don't know why, but I guess I might have been what they call lucky or blessed.
[00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:00.974]  I mean, I'm not here even bashing the police.
[00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:04.457]  But you know full well you're driving like a bunch of psychopaths.
[00:17:05.177 --> 00:17:06.038]  And I'm tired of it!
[00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:24.421]  I would expect if somebody was driving like that knowingly, pulling out in front of 40 mile an hour traffic, doing bat turns basically, I would expect that if I drove like that, that I would be arrested for reckless driving.
[00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:24.421]  43.80.
[00:17:27.163 --> 00:17:28.525]  I don't know what your problem is.
[00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:35.153]  And I'm sure your friends are radioing you now telling you to tune to this channel so you can hear this.
[00:17:35.193 --> 00:17:35.673]  That's fine.
[00:17:35.933 --> 00:17:36.873]  You're probably listening now.
[00:17:37.354 --> 00:17:37.914]  Stop it!
[00:17:38.334 --> 00:17:41.295]  Maybe you're not aware of the fact that you pulled out in front of people.
[00:17:41.615 --> 00:17:44.036]  But I see cops do it all the time and I'm sick of it!
[00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.458]  Alright, now see I've wasted five, six minutes on this.
[00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:53.340]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment and then I will get into
[00:17:54.952 --> 00:17:57.554]  Consumer confidence drops for third month.
[00:17:58.014 --> 00:17:59.195]  What's happening with inflation?
[00:17:59.775 --> 00:18:02.997]  Some fear law would create a national ID card, Boston Globe.
[00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:04.798]  That's exactly what the bill does.
[00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:12.462]  Meanwhile, the neocon publications and radio shows are out there manipulating their audiences, claiming it's to stop illegal aliens, when it isn't.
[00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:18.406]  And I want to dovetail that with this World Net Daily article, Los Angeles, Mexico.
[00:18:19.153 --> 00:18:24.955]  And they crossed out California and put Mexico up, saying California is Mexico, and guess who paid for this?
[00:18:26.115 --> 00:18:28.216]  Neocon Flair Channel!
[00:18:29.257 --> 00:18:30.757]  As usual!
[00:18:33.418 --> 00:18:38.820]  Taiwan's nationalist leader, Lin becomes first to visit mainland China since 1949.
[00:18:40.961 --> 00:18:47.883]  We've got this article I never got to yesterday, it's 14 pages long, I can't cover the whole thing, but, abortion staff ignores baby born alive,
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.861]  Unbelievable, folks.
[00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:51.062]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:51.603 --> 00:18:53.524]  Bush urges Saudis to boost oil production.
[00:18:53.544 --> 00:18:54.465]  That's only on the surface.
[00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:55.226]  That's not true.
[00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:58.829]  And we'll also get into law states.
[00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:01.851]  Utility employees can enter your home without permission.
[00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.695]  Federal agents, prosecutors are targeting guns.
[00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:08.217]  Bush has expanded funding to target gun owners.
[00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:10.539]  This is out of Pittsburgh Live.
[00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:13.682]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:19:13.722 --> 00:19:21.267]  Newspapers struggle to avoid their own obituary, Christian Science Monitor, as the mainstream media and mainstream newspapers again plunge even further.
[00:19:21.607 --> 00:19:23.448]  More reports of this as we explode.
[00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:25.469]  And U.S.
[00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:27.911]  clears soldiers and Italian agents' death.
[00:19:28.431 --> 00:19:33.875]  The government's also cleared our troops for killing and murdering and torturing innocent Iraqis.
[00:19:35.211 --> 00:19:35.952]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:36.452 --> 00:19:40.114]  Oh, and our government won't even help American POWs tortured in Gulf War detention.
[00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:41.895]  We'll not get compensation, see?
[00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:43.256]  They hate our own troops.
[00:19:45.557 --> 00:19:46.378]  Folks, there's so much.
[00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:49.340]  First, we'll take your calls from John in Texas and others.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.881]  When we get back, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:56.804]  Don't forget another great website we've got, InfoWars.net!
[00:19:57.345 --> 00:19:58.726]  InfoWars.net!
[00:19:59.146 --> 00:19:59.606]  Stay with us!
[00:20:02.523 --> 00:20:03.684]  All water isn't the same.
[00:20:03.944 --> 00:20:08.947]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:11.809]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:20:12.009 --> 00:20:20.554]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:20:20.914 --> 00:20:29.361]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:32.944]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[00:20:33.184 --> 00:20:40.630]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.912]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.353]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:49.277]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:50.419]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:50.760]  That's 888-727-8269.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.822]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:01.718]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:06.582]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:14.569]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:20.194]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:27.400]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.004]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:37.987]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.347 --> 00:21:45.972]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.293 --> 00:21:51.756]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.837 --> 00:21:54.498]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.779 --> 00:21:57.099]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.219 --> 00:22:11.007]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:22:11.167 --> 00:22:18.771]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:22.133]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:22.393 --> 00:22:28.180]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:34.608]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:38.853]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:22:38.894 --> 00:22:40.776]  The water level is always visible.
[00:22:40.956 --> 00:22:46.921]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:22:47.142 --> 00:22:51.085]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:51.866]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:07.849]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:12.491]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:19.734]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:20.134 --> 00:23:26.240]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.641]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.904]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:23:31.064 --> 00:23:33.046]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:23:33.387 --> 00:23:40.613]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:23:40.914 --> 00:23:44.317]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:23:44.717 --> 00:23:47.820]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:49.441]  Call today.
[00:23:49.501 --> 00:23:50.943]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:52.684]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:24:13.197 --> 00:24:28.109]  We've got this amazing mind joining us in the middle of the next hour for 30 minutes, Pastor Chuck Baldwin, who does a great job every week illustrating that George Bush makes Bill Clinton look like a right-wing extremist.
[00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.670]  I'm serious.
[00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:42.601]  And then we're also going to talk about the de-industrialization and the destruction of even our local service economies in the third hour with Saving Main Street.
[00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:46.193]  We're going to take calls and cover other news items right now.
[00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:47.034]  Let's go to calls.
[00:24:47.534 --> 00:24:53.019]  John in Texas and Kurt Vandrick, what a cool name, or Vandrake, Brett Elma and others.
[00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:54.340]  John, go ahead.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.200]  Hi Alex.
[00:24:55.621 --> 00:24:55.901]  Hello.
[00:24:56.942 --> 00:25:11.353]  About a week ago, I was going outside to get my car and it was a cloudless day over Houston and I happened to look up in the sky and there was one cloud up there and I said, gee that's a funny looking cloud and I looked up there and there was a jet plane up there leaving a vapor trail.
[00:25:12.062 --> 00:25:16.605]  But I looked closer and I seen about four other jet planes up there leaving the same type of vapor trails.
[00:25:17.345 --> 00:25:21.988]  And so since I listened to your program, I've heard other people calling about this, but I kept an eye on them through the day.
[00:25:22.848 --> 00:25:27.911]  And they were done towards the afternoon and they had like a tic-tac-toe pattern over Houston.
[00:25:28.812 --> 00:25:29.732]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:25:30.573 --> 00:25:37.337]  You remember six, seven years ago, our whole lives, a jet would be flying, you know, 30,000 feet, 20,000 feet.
[00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.873]  And it would leave a condensation trail that would disappear within seconds or minutes.
[00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:45.054]  Yeah.
[00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:59.163]  About six, seven years ago, these magic jets started showing up that leave them at 3,000 feet, and they stay there for four hours, and they get bigger, and other jets fly right next to them in the same atmospheric conditions and don't leave trails.
[00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:02.583]  And, uh, boy, I don't know what's going on.
[00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:10.209]  Well, I, uh, my next door neighbor, her boyfriend's on the Sheriff's Department, and I said, well, I told her about it, and I said, ask Bob if he can find out what's going on.
[00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:14.413]  She said, well, he has a friend in the Air Force he's good friends with, he might be able to find out something.
[00:26:14.433 --> 00:26:20.237]  So I, I got word back the other day that he was told that the Air Force was testing a new weapon over there, up there.
[00:26:21.598 --> 00:26:23.059]  Thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:28.964]  All I know is there were over, for some reason on the statistic,
[00:26:29.952 --> 00:26:31.073]  I get the numbers confused.
[00:26:32.534 --> 00:26:38.117]  They tested 1,300 times chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals on our troops.
[00:26:39.118 --> 00:26:40.219]  This came out in the 70's.
[00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:43.101]  From the 40's to the 70's this happened.
[00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.041]  This came out in 77.
[00:26:45.462 --> 00:26:48.924]  And it was over 3,000 times it was tested on the American people.
[00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:52.787]  Over 1,000 times on the British people.
[00:26:53.979 --> 00:27:00.904]  I mean, just type plague bombs tested on Scotland, bioweapons released in London, bioweapon released in New York subway, 1968.
[00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:03.867]  Those are some of the more famous cases.
[00:27:04.367 --> 00:27:07.489]  But I mean, I have the congressional reports where they admit all this.
[00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:18.698]  And so I don't put anything past them, but I don't know why one jet flying at the same altitude as another leaves a giant trail that's there two hours later, and one right beside it's gone in 30 seconds.
[00:27:19.118 --> 00:27:20.519]  I don't know why my whole life
[00:27:23.852 --> 00:27:27.173]  I never saw jets leave trails that lasted more than a minute or two.
[00:27:27.493 --> 00:27:29.834]  And now, they stay there for hours.
[00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:32.075]  It's a big discussion.
[00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:33.795]  Kurt in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:33.835 --> 00:27:34.415]  Go ahead, Kurt.
[00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:35.856]  Yes, Alex.
[00:27:36.656 --> 00:27:37.456]  I called today.
[00:27:37.896 --> 00:27:44.058]  Basically, I just got Martial Law, your new documentary.
[00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:46.599]  And I was just so impressed by it.
[00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:49.260]  And it just opened my eyes up.
[00:27:50.237 --> 00:27:51.918]  And I appreciate the work you're doing.
[00:27:51.938 --> 00:28:10.088]  I'm an ex-Divinity School student and basically left it because of my political beliefs and, you know, only good little Christians are Republicans and I wasn't a Republican.
[00:28:10.828 --> 00:28:16.491]  And so I just kind of... Well then your soul may be in danger, according to you.
[00:28:17.032 --> 00:28:17.212]  Yes.
[00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:18.993]  You don't kneel before Moloch.
[00:28:20.026 --> 00:28:20.246]  Right.
[00:28:20.746 --> 00:28:22.267]  But I'm just so impressed.
[00:28:22.787 --> 00:28:24.328]  It just really opened my eyes.
[00:28:24.488 --> 00:28:27.969]  I also purchased Bohemian Grove and they're just excellent.
[00:28:28.009 --> 00:28:34.992]  I appreciate the work you're doing and I just thank God that we have Americans like you.
[00:28:35.572 --> 00:28:36.712]  And that's really all I had to say.
[00:28:36.752 --> 00:28:38.913]  I'm sorry to take up someone else's time.
[00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:38.973]  No!
[00:28:39.053 --> 00:28:39.593]  Are you kidding?
[00:28:39.613 --> 00:28:40.874]  You're calling in to plug the videos.
[00:28:40.914 --> 00:28:41.874]  I really appreciate that.
[00:28:42.735 --> 00:28:46.356]  I don't do that enough because it's the most important thing I do is the films.
[00:28:47.245 --> 00:28:55.071]  They're much more well-documented than the radio show because I can show people what I'm claiming and show them the globalists admitting it.
[00:28:55.371 --> 00:29:00.996]  What did you think about the occult section, probably 45 minutes to the last hour?
[00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:14.866]  I had read things before in books and you did an excellent job of covering it for someone who wasn't aware of it at all.
[00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:16.748]  The thing that I was
[00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:21.317]  Most impressed by is your sincerity.
[00:29:21.758 --> 00:29:29.181]  I know that like, you know, Hitler was sincere and all this, but it's just the way that you come off when you're on, in your documentaries.
[00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:35.043]  It's like, I go, this is a man who positively believes everything that he's saying.
[00:29:35.963 --> 00:29:38.184]  And I know that I can trust you.
[00:29:38.224 --> 00:29:40.565]  My father was a newspaper reporter for a short time.
[00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:44.447]  He was like one of the old newspaper reporters, you know, you know, he was,
[00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.311]  He was a good guy.
[00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:47.834]  Finish your thought on the other shot.
[00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:48.494]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:52.660]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:54.763]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.665 --> 00:29:58.368]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:07.436]  Do you have $10, $20, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[00:30:07.556 --> 00:30:12.481]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention, because relief is on the way!
[00:30:12.682 --> 00:30:14.103]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201.
[00:30:16.866 --> 00:30:22.430]  We'll negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.
[00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:27.033]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:30.275]  In most cases you can be debt free in less than 36 months.
[00:30:30.536 --> 00:30:34.198]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:37.280]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:39.142]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:43.326]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[00:30:43.566 --> 00:30:47.229]  I'm back in control of my life and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[00:30:47.329 --> 00:30:50.612]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:50.732]  800-509-3201.

[00:30:52.174 --> 00:30:52.594]  Call now.

[00:30:52.714 --> 00:30:52.754]  800-509-3201.
[00:31:01.062 --> 00:31:03.043]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.123 --> 00:31:13.850]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.733]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:30.140]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.565]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:40.107]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:45.551]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:52.180]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:57.507 --> 00:31:57.547]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:08.634]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[00:32:08.774 --> 00:32:12.955]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[00:32:25.017 --> 00:32:26.638]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[00:32:30.572 --> 00:32:32.273]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:32:32.473 --> 00:32:34.474]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:34.674 --> 00:32:35.354]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:35.534 --> 00:32:39.216]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.061]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:32:51.281 --> 00:32:54.142]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll free 888-211-1715.
[00:32:54.202 --> 00:32:54.923]  Again that's 888-211-1715.
[00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:16.540]  Curt in Pennsylvania, you're correct that I am sincere.
[00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:20.963]  And I'm somewhat confident that telegraphs to people.
[00:33:21.643 --> 00:33:31.350]  But I would encourage you and warn you not to go with your feelings and to go off the documents and the history, which obviously you've done, you say you've researched this.
[00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:42.607]  But please check out what I'm saying, not just the way it comes off when I say it, but you were talking about your father working for a newspaper.
[00:33:42.767 --> 00:33:43.627]  Finish up what you were saying.
[00:33:44.967 --> 00:33:50.889]  He told me things when I was a child that I found out, you know, twenty years later.
[00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.229]  Oh yeah, he knew what he was talking about, you know.
[00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:58.030]  And so I've always, my father passed away five years ago and we always
[00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:01.237]  We always had something to talk about.
[00:34:01.297 --> 00:34:06.159]  He was an intellectual, very intelligent.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.321]  I'm just kind of sorry he's not here.
[00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:12.382]  Did he talk about controlled media?
[00:34:12.582 --> 00:34:16.824]  Yeah, he felt it was not like it was when he was a newspaper reporter.
[00:34:18.894 --> 00:34:20.934]  Of course, he didn't like Bush.
[00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:25.495]  He was a fundamentalist, but he was a Democrat.
[00:34:25.955 --> 00:34:27.956]  He did not like Bush.
[00:34:28.056 --> 00:34:30.836]  He was very offended that Billy Graham got involved.
[00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:39.198]  Again, when he said he'd never get involved with a president after the fiasco with Nixon.
[00:34:39.678 --> 00:34:43.799]  I wondered if you could shed any light on... I'd heard that Billy Graham
[00:34:45.806 --> 00:34:47.427]  He was a Mason.
[00:34:47.848 --> 00:34:50.829]  I wanted to know if you knew anything about that.
[00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.670]  Sure.
[00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.731]  That's my only question.
[00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:53.811]  Okay, thanks Kurt.
[00:34:53.851 --> 00:34:54.592]  I appreciate it.
[00:34:55.232 --> 00:34:58.034]  I have heard from good sources that Billy Graham is a Mason.
[00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:00.396]  I have seen some of the documentation.
[00:35:02.377 --> 00:35:07.540]  But again, I don't think Billy Graham is bad.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.103]  I've watched him give some of his speeches.
[00:35:11.123 --> 00:35:11.603]  I'm not here to bash
[00:35:14.126 --> 00:35:14.846]  Billy Graham.
[00:35:15.367 --> 00:35:21.449]  The entire Christian system, Christendom, has been infiltrated and taken over.
[00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.091]  The Protestants are promoting the New World Order.
[00:35:24.151 --> 00:35:25.811]  The Catholics are promoting the New World Order.
[00:35:26.732 --> 00:35:29.633]  Almost every denomination is promoting the New World Order.
[00:35:30.954 --> 00:35:40.598]  I mean, I've got an article here about Senator Frisk is going around the country to churches, telling the churches to get behind the faith-based initiative.
[00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:43.079]  The federalization of the churches is what it is.
[00:35:44.531 --> 00:35:49.652]  He's going around the country saying, support President Bush and his Social Security reform, which it is not.
[00:35:50.213 --> 00:35:51.293]  It's just more of the same.
[00:35:52.213 --> 00:36:05.037]  He's going around the country saying, support the President in basically banning filler busters in the Senate, which is restricting the way the Founding Fathers set it up with the separation of powers, so a dictatorship could be held back.
[00:36:05.657 --> 00:36:08.998]  That's one of the separation of powers built into the system.
[00:36:10.038 --> 00:36:17.161]  And they go directly to the churches, and if you're of the Lord, you support whatever Bush is doing.
[00:36:17.181 --> 00:36:24.183]  Whether that's gun control, open borders, whether it's endless wars, it's all of this.
[00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:27.884]  And that drives people away from the faith.
[00:36:28.404 --> 00:36:32.906]  People out there, liberals especially, think that Christians are George Bush.
[00:36:32.946 --> 00:36:34.386]  And they go, well I'm not one of those!
[00:36:34.406 --> 00:36:36.827]  Please don't put me in that group!
[00:36:40.173 --> 00:36:51.303]  But when you explain to people who aren't Christians about the New World Order, explain to them about the phony left-right paradigm, then they wake up and do see what's happening.
[00:36:51.903 --> 00:36:54.085]  So it's all very sophisticated.
[00:36:54.125 --> 00:36:55.546]  I mean, it's like the Democrats.
[00:36:55.586 --> 00:37:02.872]  Look, the Democrats and the Republicans are two different treads on the New World Order tank that's running over humanity.
[00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:07.096]  I've got to move quick now here because I want to cover something else before this hour ends.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.201]  That's a cool name, by the way, in Texas.
[00:37:11.282 --> 00:37:12.142]  Vanderrick, welcome.
[00:37:12.782 --> 00:37:13.183]  Thanks, sir.
[00:37:13.663 --> 00:37:14.603]  No, I got a couple points.
[00:37:14.643 --> 00:37:32.334]  I heard last week on your network about the leftgatekeepers.org, and I did some more research, and I was surprised to find that I found some documents that were pointing to Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer in the 1970s and 80s, infamous, as funding Jennifer Communications.
[00:37:32.354 --> 00:37:33.754]  Do you know anything about that, sir?
[00:37:33.995 --> 00:37:36.236]  That is totally and completely false.
[00:37:36.775 --> 00:37:39.539]  So that's just some disinfo that's out there on the net that I've heard.
[00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:44.487]  I mean, I think I heard the show you're talking about Jack Blott had a guest on.
[00:37:45.439 --> 00:37:57.328]  That was a good guess, talking about how big foundations like Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller, brothers foundations, I heard about 30 minutes of them driving in my car and I was aware of all that.
[00:37:57.348 --> 00:38:05.194]  It's true, we've done shows on that, fund the phony left-wing anti-war movement and the conservative movement to control things.
[00:38:05.475 --> 00:38:08.417]  And I would guess that you saw a link or something
[00:38:08.877 --> 00:38:13.781]  No, I did independent research on that, and I found out... Oh, so that wasn't on that site?
[00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:32.474]  No, I started researching that on my own, and in the course of finding it on my own... Yeah, because everything I heard that guest saying was spot on from the documents, and then you come in and add what you just said, which I've had to respond to twice before, and I guess I'll respond to that now, Vandrick, if you'd like me to.
[00:38:32.494 --> 00:38:33.535]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:35.484 --> 00:38:38.926]  We had the guy with the Mad Cow News or whatever.
[00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:40.367]  Mad Cow Morning News.
[00:38:40.607 --> 00:38:41.168]  That's one of them.
[00:38:41.328 --> 00:38:43.189]  Yeah, let me just talk about it.
[00:38:43.409 --> 00:38:45.631]  Let me just finish this and move on, okay?
[00:38:45.651 --> 00:38:47.872]  Since you're bringing this up.
[00:38:48.973 --> 00:38:49.934]  And we've had him on.
[00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:51.235]  I think he's done good work.
[00:38:51.715 --> 00:38:52.856]  We don't agree on everything.
[00:38:52.996 --> 00:39:05.304]  And a couple months ago, I guess about four months ago, this thing pops up that this Khashoggi guy is funding and involved and connected to groups with Michael Rupert.
[00:39:06.443 --> 00:39:10.086]  And quite frankly, I've looked at it and I have found that to be somewhat accurate.
[00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:12.668]  Rupert is for the peak oil.
[00:39:12.948 --> 00:39:14.890]  He is talking about population reductions.
[00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:15.711]  It's scary.
[00:39:16.611 --> 00:39:19.053]  And I'm not in a bash-fest on Rupert.
[00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:20.034]  It's a distraction.
[00:39:20.474 --> 00:39:22.776]  Even though he's savaged me many times for no reason.
[00:39:23.657 --> 00:39:24.678]  But I'm not going to get into that.
[00:39:24.718 --> 00:39:25.418]  It's a distraction.
[00:39:25.779 --> 00:39:33.645]  But then, the gentleman with that website goes and says, because there is some group called Genesis
[00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:37.672]  that is connected to some other group funding something.
[00:39:38.452 --> 00:39:40.493]  He says in the article, is it connected?
[00:39:40.553 --> 00:39:43.253]  I mean, there's a porno magazine called Genesis.
[00:39:43.773 --> 00:39:47.314]  There's a bunch of different... I'm going to be serious here now, sir.
[00:39:49.175 --> 00:39:52.916]  The first book of the Bible is called Genesis.
[00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.936]  There's no connection.
[00:39:55.096 --> 00:39:58.097]  Zero, nada, one hundred and ten percent zero.
[00:39:58.117 --> 00:39:58.617]  Thank you for the call.
[00:39:59.137 --> 00:39:59.417]  Okay?
[00:40:00.077 --> 00:40:02.098]  And so, total
[00:40:02.893 --> 00:40:04.454]  Total distraction.
[00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:05.394]  Totally false.
[00:40:05.454 --> 00:40:12.076]  And I have no idea why in that article it says, well, this group's called that, and so is this group.
[00:40:12.156 --> 00:40:12.957]  Is there a connection?
[00:40:13.417 --> 00:40:13.777]  Okay?
[00:40:14.157 --> 00:40:15.558]  I mean, let's talk about real issues.
[00:40:16.098 --> 00:40:26.022]  And regardless, ladies and gentlemen, okay, let's say George Bush had his hand inside me as a puppet, and he was controlling Alex Jones, which is not the case.
[00:40:27.102 --> 00:40:29.923]  Or let's say the Keebler Elves were controlling me.
[00:40:30.915 --> 00:40:33.837]  Regardless, are cameras in school bathrooms?
[00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:36.939]  Are thumb scanners going in schools to get lunches?
[00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:46.085]  Are transponder legislation going through different state houses to put transponders in all cars to tax you by the mile?
[00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:46.465]  Yes.
[00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:54.230]  Does New Freedom, now passed, set up a system to transponder track and tax and control?
[00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:55.971]  Yes.
[00:40:57.038 --> 00:40:58.399]  Are our borders wide open?
[00:40:58.879 --> 00:40:59.219]  Yes.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.020]  Are we losing our sovereignty?
[00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:01.661]  Yes.
[00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:04.963]  Is the free trade area of the Americas coming in?
[00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.904]  Setting up the Pan-American Union?
[00:41:07.944 --> 00:41:09.165]  Getting rid of our sovereignty?
[00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:10.826]  Dwarfing NAFTA and GAAP?
[00:41:11.226 --> 00:41:11.546]  Yes.
[00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:14.728]  There's a hundred issues.
[00:41:14.748 --> 00:41:16.229]  Is the Federal Reserve private?
[00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:17.950]  Is inflation exploding?
[00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.172]  Are the globalists manipulating oil prices by design?
[00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:23.053]  Has the dollar imploded in value 45%?
[00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:23.233]  Yes.
[00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:30.067]  Is the government preparing to carry out more terror attacks?
[00:41:30.307 --> 00:41:30.727]  Yes.
[00:41:31.728 --> 00:41:35.469]  Are they passing expansions of national ID card legislation?
[00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:36.229]  Yes.
[00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:42.931]  Have you noticed that on my broadcast, I don't spend my time... This is what happens.
[00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:54.795]  Other patriots, alternative news people, whatever you want to call them, alternative news spends about half its time on average, literally, half its time fighting with each other.
[00:41:55.313 --> 00:42:03.675]  Because a lot of people are egomaniacs who are envious of anyone out there who is having an effect and changing things.
[00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.976]  And so they spend all their time fighting with each other.
[00:42:08.236 --> 00:42:24.660]  And then other good people, who aren't egomaniacs, spend their time fighting with those people, and then they get into the habit of going after other alternative media people, and then it just turns into a giant cluster of mini-battles.
[00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:28.352]  It doesn't do anything for anybody.
[00:42:29.852 --> 00:42:30.313]  It doesn't.
[00:42:31.173 --> 00:42:32.193]  It goes nowhere.
[00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:40.436]  You shouldn't spend your time, just like I told the caller before you, Vanderrick, just like I told Kurt, do not believe what I'm saying.
[00:42:40.856 --> 00:42:42.436]  Do not say you just trust me.
[00:42:43.377 --> 00:42:45.457]  Go out and check the information out.
[00:42:45.557 --> 00:42:47.478]  But it isn't about the personality.
[00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.659]  People call in and tell me how great I am.
[00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:50.099]  No.
[00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:51.720]  I'm just an average person.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.020]  At about midnight last night,
[00:42:53.934 --> 00:43:06.055]  I sat in my backyard under the stars, a beautiful, almost full moon, and the stars, and I was sitting there looking at Jupiter, and I was sitting there just thinking.
[00:43:07.108 --> 00:43:09.770]  And I was just thinking about ways to fight the New World Order.
[00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:15.675]  I was thinking about how much I love life, and how beautiful life is, and how sad it is that there's so much evil.
[00:43:16.176 --> 00:43:25.864]  I was thinking about all the ideas and information, and I was thinking how to express myself, how to properly articulate what the New World Order is, this slave grid that they've been
[00:43:26.324 --> 00:43:32.506]  Carefully building and crafting for the last hundred years, and now their plans are coming to fruition.
[00:43:32.866 --> 00:43:39.748]  There's a lot of snags in their program, and things aren't going smoothly for them, and we really can stand up for humanity.
[00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:43.390]  But, you know, you gotta have more discernment.
[00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:49.312]  I mean, even the very article that you refer to says, is there a connection?
[00:43:49.332 --> 00:43:50.692]  And I ask, why would someone go?
[00:43:50.712 --> 00:43:53.353]  I mean, are we connected to the Genesis porn mag?
[00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:55.981]  Are we?
[00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:58.262]  Is Genesis directly controlled by God?
[00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:01.385]  Because God's first book is called Genesis.
[00:44:03.327 --> 00:44:04.928]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.850]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:44:08.831 --> 00:44:10.693]  And it gives me a headache.
[00:44:11.293 --> 00:44:13.315]  I'm going to take a few more calls and I've got to cover some news.
[00:44:13.655 --> 00:44:14.636]  Brett in Kansas City.
[00:44:14.676 --> 00:44:15.276]  Go ahead, Brett.
[00:44:15.877 --> 00:44:16.498]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:16.518 --> 00:44:17.618]  Thanks for taking my call again.
[00:44:17.819 --> 00:44:18.159]  Hello.
[00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:22.154]  I just wanted to say, first of all, listeners out there, Get Martial Law.
[00:44:22.174 --> 00:44:23.135]  It is waking people up.
[00:44:23.235 --> 00:44:28.739]  I've shown it to quite a few of my friends, and they've woken up to Alex's book, because it's also waking people up.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:38.848]  My question was in regards to a person that a lot of people think out there gives them a third choice, and that's Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel.
[00:44:38.888 --> 00:44:44.393]  I just wanted to know what you thought of him and some of the issues he covers, what you thought of that, too.
[00:44:44.453 --> 00:44:44.773]  Thank you.
[00:44:45.213 --> 00:44:46.314]  Oh, thank you for the call.
[00:44:48.968 --> 00:44:52.790]  I've heard him out of his mouth say that all militia members should be arrested.
[00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:59.333]  I've heard his counterparts, the neocon ultra-leftists, going to use their paradigm.
[00:44:59.953 --> 00:45:02.755]  They're command and controllers, they're not leftists, they're not right-wingers.
[00:45:02.795 --> 00:45:04.976]  There's no such thing, folks.
[00:45:05.676 --> 00:45:07.417]  Left and right didn't exist a hundred years ago.
[00:45:07.697 --> 00:45:09.078]  It was tyranny versus freedom.
[00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:10.639]  Slavery versus liberty.
[00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:14.361]  Dignity and independence versus control.
[00:45:16.302 --> 00:45:16.542]  I mean,
[00:45:18.712 --> 00:45:23.415]  Sean Hannity, Every Child Needs a Microchip, I'm Buying Stock Now, Arrest All Militia Members.
[00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.738]  O'Reilly, Ban SUVs.
[00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:31.641]  I mean, I don't even watch the guy, but maybe twice a year, every time I tune in, it's a similar thing.
[00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:37.945]  I mean, he'll do something good like, don't give money to the Red Cross and United Way, they're ripping you off.
[00:45:38.005 --> 00:45:38.986]  Get money to the people.
[00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:40.687]  He'll pick a few good issues.
[00:45:40.747 --> 00:45:47.672]  I mean, I agree with Michael Savage on about 90% of what he says, but then he says Bush is fighting the New World Order,
[00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:50.820]  Uh, arrest anyone that disagrees with him.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.181]  I mean, Bush is not fighting the New World Order, and you shouldn't arrest people that disagree with him.
[00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:58.782]  And put him, quote, in forced labor camps.
[00:46:00.563 --> 00:46:07.505]  I mean, that's, so see, they tell you the truth about a lot of problems, but then give you false solutions.
[00:46:07.985 --> 00:46:09.986]  They twist at the key point.
[00:46:11.926 --> 00:46:13.987]  And people aren't sophisticated enough to see it.
[00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:19.102]  I mean, I don't know what I can say about Bill O'Reilly.
[00:46:19.463 --> 00:46:29.271]  I mean, he said illegal immigration is a problem, right up until where we were about to pass a bill to control it, and suddenly he came out and said, I'm for open borders, I'm for Bush, I'm for amnesty.
[00:46:29.471 --> 00:46:33.514]  And then after the election, when it didn't matter anymore, now he's against illegal immigration again.
[00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:35.275]  It's just like Lou Dobbs.
[00:46:35.576 --> 00:46:38.378]  Talks about illegal immigration, calls for a national ID card.
[00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:40.439]  That doesn't do anything about it.
[00:46:40.459 --> 00:46:43.342]  In fact, let me just cover that now since you raised that question.
[00:46:44.743 --> 00:46:45.784]  And I have the articles.
[00:46:47.062 --> 00:46:47.523]  None of me?
[00:46:48.944 --> 00:46:49.905]  I can't find them.
[00:46:49.925 --> 00:46:51.727]  It's giving me a headache.
[00:46:51.747 --> 00:46:52.969]  I've got so many articles here.
[00:46:53.729 --> 00:46:54.671]  Let me find it.
[00:46:54.951 --> 00:46:55.411]  Okay, here it is.
[00:46:55.471 --> 00:46:55.832]  I found it.
[00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:56.893]  Okay.
[00:46:58.254 --> 00:46:59.496]  Boston Globe today.
[00:46:59.696 --> 00:47:03.080]  Some fear law would create national ID cards.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:25.329]  Congress is poised to pass a law that would make sweeping changes to the nation's system for issuing driver's licenses by imposing stringent requirements on states to verify the authenticity of birth certificates, social security cards, legal residency visas, the operative word, and bank and utility records used to obtain licenses.
[00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:30.987]  And the House Republicans attached the bill to a must-pass supplemental spending package.
[00:47:31.368 --> 00:47:33.408]  It was going to pass last week, but we've been fighting it.
[00:47:33.428 --> 00:47:35.649]  It's on the verge of passing today or tomorrow.
[00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:40.491]  Now, they passed a national ID card to federally standardized driver's license.
[00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:41.731]  Bush signed it December 26th.
[00:47:42.652 --> 00:47:45.673]  Now they're expanding it, and it makes a Pan-American ID card.
[00:47:46.253 --> 00:47:52.355]  Merges our computer systems, not just with the feds and the states, with biometrics, but with the Mexicans and Canadians.
[00:47:52.795 --> 00:47:55.076]  And then from there it expands out, two years later.
[00:47:56.769 --> 00:47:57.589]  It does so much.
[00:47:57.629 --> 00:48:00.331]  You're going to have to have this to have millions of different types of jobs.
[00:48:01.733 --> 00:48:02.673]  It just goes on and on.
[00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:03.934]  We've covered this.
[00:48:04.735 --> 00:48:12.200]  But Ron Paul, three months ago, analyzed the House and Senate versions and put out a report giving a subsection saying it does not stop illegal aliens.
[00:48:14.462 --> 00:48:20.487]  It says to restrict illegal immigration, but then it says we will accept consular matriculus for IDs.
[00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:25.080]  So 30, I keep saying 30, it's now 70 countries.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.261]  I'm using last year's numbers.
[00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.182]  Now 70, what is it, 76 countries.
[00:48:29.883 --> 00:48:33.625]  See it's expanding from 30 something to 70 something in the last year.
[00:48:34.085 --> 00:48:36.727]  Issue these consular cards, which they'll give their citizens.
[00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:41.910]  And if their citizens can get here, our government will issue an ID card.
[00:48:43.951 --> 00:48:49.314]  You can get a bank account, apartment, driver's license, everything.
[00:48:51.268 --> 00:48:54.171]  But the bill says to restrict illegal immigration, we'll accept these.
[00:48:54.511 --> 00:48:56.372]  That doesn't restrict it, it legalizes it.
[00:48:58.434 --> 00:49:00.055]  So this is the spin we're fighting.
[00:49:00.696 --> 00:49:09.122]  It actually, it's like the last national ID card bill they passed actually did a lot to expand the amnesty piecemeal.
[00:49:10.203 --> 00:49:11.024]  And we covered all that.
[00:49:11.765 --> 00:49:15.047]  But the average good conservative reads this.
[00:49:15.427 --> 00:49:16.448]  Here's the Washington Times.
[00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:19.791]  War Bill, Shields ID Act,
[00:49:20.347 --> 00:49:20.607]  From Axe.
[00:49:21.127 --> 00:49:29.051]  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday that Democrats will have to accept the Real ID Act written by House Republicans to limit asylum claims.
[00:49:29.191 --> 00:49:29.752]  It doesn't.
[00:49:30.132 --> 00:49:36.035]  And crack down on illegal immigrants obtaining driver's licenses as part of the final emergency war spending bill.
[00:49:36.715 --> 00:49:43.318]  Negotiators are trying to hammer out a compromise between the Senate's $81 billion supplemental spending bill and the House's $81.4 billion.
[00:49:43.518 --> 00:49:43.698]  Okay.
[00:49:44.679 --> 00:49:46.640]  So see, and they go on to say it stops illegals.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.041]  The average person reads this and is for it.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:50:05.352]  The only thing you could claim really stops illegals is it gives the executive branch total power to veto not legislation but any already existing law or action for border security.
[00:50:06.052 --> 00:50:08.875]  It isn't just for one California Mexi-Cal fence.
[00:50:10.055 --> 00:50:11.056]  Lawyers have looked at it.
[00:50:11.256 --> 00:50:12.237]  Congress has looked at it.
[00:50:12.678 --> 00:50:16.581]  It is actually a dictatorship clause right in there.
[00:50:18.027 --> 00:50:26.053]  That could be claimed could stop illegals, but it doesn't, because Bush, when we pass 2,000 more Border Patrol, he says, no, I'm going to take the money and give it to something else.
[00:50:26.714 --> 00:50:28.195]  So we know he won't use it for that.
[00:50:29.836 --> 00:50:30.637]  So now you see.
[00:50:32.218 --> 00:50:33.179]  This is what we're fighting.
[00:50:33.199 --> 00:50:34.640]  This is the level of deception.
[00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:47.430]  That it's being billed by the liberal Boston Globe and the so-called conservative, uh, Mooney Washington Times, that it's to stop illegals, when it doesn't do that.
[00:50:49.375 --> 00:50:52.496]  And if you think that's bad when we get back, L.A.
[00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.797]  is now Mexico, Clear Channel announces.
[00:50:56.338 --> 00:50:56.938]  I'm not kidding.
[00:50:57.258 --> 00:50:58.819]  They're now announcing that it is Mexico.
[00:50:58.839 --> 00:50:59.399]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.141 --> 00:51:05.002]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:07.036]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.236 --> 00:51:12.958]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.239 --> 00:51:18.501]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:22.903]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.103 --> 00:51:26.887]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.147 --> 00:51:31.791]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:31.891 --> 00:51:34.654]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:34.954 --> 00:51:38.157]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.197 --> 00:51:40.019]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.343]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:05.236]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:10.897]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:21.560]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:26.041]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria and cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:27.042]  We're good to go.
[00:52:41.152 --> 00:52:41.673]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.021]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.882 --> 00:53:18.542]  We're good to go.

[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:07.202]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.605 --> 00:54:22.729]  Coming up in a minute, I'm going to tell you how to get my new video, Martial Laws, get your pens and paper ready, but we've got the Neocon Talk Radio, I've heard them for months.
[00:54:23.489 --> 00:54:28.091]  All the so-called conservative newspapers, the liberal newspapers, they're all the same group.
[00:54:28.775 --> 00:54:37.659]  They're out there saying, man, we're really going to stop the illegal aliens with these national ID card bills that really are an electronic straitjacket on you and your family and the states.
[00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:39.599]  Total federalization.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.561]  Meanwhile, World Net Daily reports, LA now is Mexico.
[00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:57.547]  And huge billboards have gone up that say Los Angeles Television, and talks about news in Spanish, Channel 62,
[00:54:59.272 --> 00:55:03.258]  And it's got Los Angeles with California crossed out and it says Mexico.
[00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:05.822]  And who's done this?
[00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:10.789]  The same people that put up the sign saying our leader with the giant face of George Bush.
[00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.655]  Shades of North Korea or Iraq under Saddam or Hitler.
[00:55:15.936 --> 00:55:22.501]  An immigration activist group is drawing attention to a photograph showing a billboard ad for Spanish-language TV newscasts in L.A.
[00:55:23.121 --> 00:55:29.826]  on which Californium, abbreviation for Los Angeles, has been crossed out and the word Mexico has been added in its place.
[00:55:31.607 --> 00:55:41.874]  And it's just amazing and it goes on to say that Clear Channel is part of an ad campaign that they have to promote their Spanish stations they own.
[00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:48.770]  Again, this is the Fortune 500 fund, the La Rica Inquista, all of it.
[00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:57.596]  And the poor La Rica Inquista people, you know that means take over the Southwest, think that they're fighting the evil, you know, whitey and the big rich white men.
[00:55:58.036 --> 00:56:00.218]  No, you're owned and run by the big rich white men.
[00:56:00.578 --> 00:56:01.459]  In your country, too!
[00:56:02.039 --> 00:56:09.424]  But what about half of your Congress is guys with blonde hair and blue eyes with names like Schmidt and Johnson and Brown?
[00:56:10.805 --> 00:56:12.046]  It's amazing, folks.
[00:56:12.086 --> 00:56:12.627]  And Fox.
[00:56:13.655 --> 00:56:14.795]  Who isn't even Mexican?
[00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:16.816]  Oh yeah, you didn't know that?
[00:56:17.436 --> 00:56:18.636]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[00:56:19.737 --> 00:56:22.397]  They want to break this country up and they're using you!
[00:56:23.138 --> 00:56:32.100]  And again, this is the same group that brings you all these neocons who are telling you right now, pass this national ID card bill to stop the illegals.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.521]  Meanwhile, they've got signs up saying this is Mexico!
[00:56:34.761 --> 00:56:35.581]  Ha ha ha!
[00:56:37.462 --> 00:56:41.663]  And I bet your bottom dollar you're not going to hear Lord Limbaugh or anybody else talk about this.
[00:56:42.358 --> 00:56:44.378]  Try to get through their call screeners and see what happens.
[00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:47.299]  No, they'll tell you to pass the National I.D.
[00:56:47.319 --> 00:56:47.979]  card to stop them.
[00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:50.880]  Me and my mother putting up billboards saying that California is Mexico.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:57:07.103]  And all the LaRicanquistas out there, I mean, I was bike riding over in East Austin Sunday, about two hours, and they got these big idols up with Aztecs taking over Texas, you know, these LaRicanquista
[00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:12.176]  Carvings, pretty carvings, very nice in the limestone.
[00:57:12.636 --> 00:57:15.818]  You know, big official City Works projects over by the Hollis Street Power Plant.
[00:57:16.378 --> 00:57:17.819]  I mean, this is how sick it is.
[00:57:17.899 --> 00:57:19.440]  Why is the city paying for that?
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.260]  Well, that's the plan!
[00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:23.802]  Aztecs were never in Texas.
[00:57:23.822 --> 00:57:24.882]  This doesn't belong to you.
[00:57:24.922 --> 00:57:25.602]  It belongs to anybody.
[00:57:25.622 --> 00:57:28.104]  It belongs to some of the native tribes that were here.
[00:57:28.524 --> 00:57:30.745]  You see, but this is how they want to turn us against each other.
[00:57:31.385 --> 00:57:33.406]  So Clear Channel is funding this.
[00:57:33.926 --> 00:57:34.647]  Don't be fools.
[00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:35.267]  Don't follow it.
[00:57:36.184 --> 00:57:38.525]  My new film, Martial Law, is out on DVD.
[00:57:38.565 --> 00:57:39.705]  Three hours on DVD.
[00:57:39.785 --> 00:57:41.646]  Two and a half plus hours on VHS.
[00:57:41.666 --> 00:57:42.426]  You gotta get it.
[00:57:42.846 --> 00:57:43.707]  It's waking people up.
[00:57:43.767 --> 00:57:44.347]  It's excellent.
[00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:45.167]  It's powerful.
[00:57:45.687 --> 00:57:46.588]  And it won't be seen.
[00:57:46.628 --> 00:57:49.969]  It won't have an effect unless you get it and make copies and get it out to people.
[00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:52.730]  So please call now and get Martial Law.
[00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.590]  Don't wait any longer.
[00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:53.670]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:39.232]  Make the copies.
[00:58:39.313 --> 00:58:40.213]  Have the effect.
[00:58:40.713 --> 00:58:41.954]  Stand up against the tyranny.
[00:58:42.435 --> 00:58:44.316]  That's it for this hour of transmission.
[00:58:44.876 --> 00:58:46.157]  Stay tuned for another hour.
[00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:47.638]  We shall return.
[00:58:58.047 --> 00:58:58.688]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.348 --> 00:59:00.409]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.231]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:03.692]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.453 --> 00:59:05.434]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.034 --> 00:59:09.678]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.198 --> 00:59:14.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.805 --> 00:59:27.609]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, now we're into our number two.
[00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:35.334]  I just finished up talking about how the neocon publications are claiming this national ID card bill about to pass the Senate.
[00:59:36.315 --> 00:59:42.519]  Stops illegal aliens, it does the exact opposite according to the bill and Ron Paul's analysis that anybody could do.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:51.806]  And of course now Clear Channel has been caught putting up billboards in LA that say that LA is part of Mexico and La Reconquista basically.
[00:59:52.739 --> 00:59:53.560]  Again, why is that?
[00:59:55.061 --> 01:00:01.685]  And again, the neocons will rail against illegal immigration, but tell you that Bush is fighting it, and that his amnesty plan will save you from it.
[01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.506]  Yes, by legalizing all illegals.
[01:00:03.887 --> 01:00:07.909]  Meanwhile, Bush wants the free trade area of the Americas, which creates the Pan-American Union.
[01:00:08.269 --> 01:00:10.451]  And they claim that'll fight illegal aliens.
[01:00:10.631 --> 01:00:12.632]  Oh yeah, it'll actually legalize everything.
[01:00:13.313 --> 01:00:15.895]  And further decimate their jobs and our jobs.
[01:00:17.936 --> 01:00:19.277]  It's just incredible!
[01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:20.538]  What they do!
[01:00:22.242 --> 01:00:23.723]  It's incredible how they operate.
[01:00:24.364 --> 01:00:30.809]  I mean, you take a Washington Times article, a Boston Globe article, a liberal conservative listen to a diatribe of Limbaugh, it's identical.
[01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.891]  It's a bunch of propaganda.
[01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.294]  Bottom line, it's all the same group.
[01:00:37.395 --> 01:00:38.476]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:00:39.216 --> 01:00:40.177]  I'm tired of it!
[01:00:41.278 --> 01:00:42.900]  They're there to pacify you.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.703]  They know 80 plus percent of Americans are against open borders.
[01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:54.689]  But they're there to make you think they're trying to stop it, while they continue to deliver us into the hands of the New World Order.
[01:00:56.449 --> 01:00:57.850]  There's so much other news here.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:59.310]  It's just out of control.
[01:01:02.071 --> 01:01:04.392]  I want to get into more into this National ID Card Bill.
[01:01:04.472 --> 01:01:05.553]  It's such a big deal.
[01:01:06.153 --> 01:01:07.434]  A police chief in the U.S.
[01:01:07.494 --> 01:01:11.535]  is taking a microchip and wants his employees, his other officers, to do it.
[01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:16.277]  I never got to this abortion staff ignores baby boy, born alive, woman pleads for help with
[01:01:17.959 --> 01:01:22.443]  I heard a story last night that World Night Daily put out, supposedly the Soviet Union
[01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:43.411]  Thank you.
[01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:44.192]  It's more than just that.
[01:01:44.212 --> 01:01:46.012]  But I'll try to elaborate on that after the break.
[01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:16.308]  But, uh, no, it's an economic war.
[01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:17.749]  I'll explain.
[01:02:18.209 --> 01:02:24.191]  People never finish the equation when it comes to globalization and what the endgame is.
[01:02:24.812 --> 01:02:26.392]  So I'll try to spend a few minutes on that.
[01:02:27.313 --> 01:02:29.714]  But I haven't read the particular article you're talking about.
[01:02:29.734 --> 01:02:37.017]  You're probably talking about pulse magnetic weapons or EMP, electromagnetic pulse weapons.
[01:02:38.037 --> 01:02:40.078]  And, I mean, the Russians didn't invent that.
[01:02:40.738 --> 01:02:41.779]  A hydrogen bomb
[01:02:42.415 --> 01:02:47.479]  Detonated in the upper atmosphere will cause that on a global level.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.405]  Detonated at a few thousand feet will do it on a regional level because of the energy being transferred to the atmosphere.
[01:02:55.425 --> 01:03:03.470]  Electronics will pick it up and magnify it and blow out some of their transistors, some of their components.
[01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:11.791]  I didn't see the particular article.
[01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:15.693]  What I did see yesterday is Putin bemoaning the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:21.976]  I mean, two years ago they put the hammer and sickle back on their tanks and the red stars back up.
[01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:24.677]  Or they're putting statues of Lenin back up.
[01:03:25.578 --> 01:03:27.479]  Our media tells us communism doesn't exist.
[01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:29.340]  Well, it really doesn't in a way.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.821]  It's just command and control.
[01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:36.203]  So in a lawyerly twist, they're really telling the truth.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:38.921]  It doesn't exist.
[01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:40.264]  It's just another form of control.
[01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:43.109]  That's all it is, command and control.
[01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:48.940]  They give you different choices of what form of slavery you wish to be under, which is no choice at all.
[01:03:49.461 --> 01:03:49.942]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.537 --> 01:03:57.880]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.502]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.622 --> 01:04:07.004]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.405]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:10.146]  Panama.
[01:04:10.186 --> 01:04:14.410]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:06:59.476 --> 01:07:00.517]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.237 --> 01:07:02.338]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:03.859]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:06.481]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.501 --> 01:07:09.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.323 --> 01:07:14.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.486 --> 01:07:21.811]  Alright, I'm gonna get into a police chief that's taking a microchip and wants his employees to take it.
[01:07:24.068 --> 01:07:28.250]  Just like the Mexican Attorney General making his employees take it, this time right here in the U.S.
[01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:32.473]  I want to get into what's happening with the economy, consumer confidence.
[01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:38.776]  We've also got a great American coming on the broadcast, Chuck Baldwin, to talk about the fake conservatives.
[01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:51.043]  And then later in the third hour, Saving Main Street and its retailers getting into, well, globalism and how to fight back against it before it's economically too late.
[01:07:51.798 --> 01:08:00.164]  Number one, NAFTA, GATT, all these trade deals, the free trade area, the Americas, we hear that it's all just simply about trade.
[01:08:02.306 --> 01:08:15.255]  Just like the European Union supposedly began being set up 40 years ago as the economic union, or as the economic community, but then they merged their laws and their law enforcement and
[01:08:16.272 --> 01:08:27.697]  Their environmental laws, and then their roads, and then it's one big government, and oh, by the way, we're taking your right to vote against the EU Parliament Commission.
[01:08:28.598 --> 01:08:29.518]  Fifteen governors.
[01:08:30.879 --> 01:08:32.099]  It's the same thing in America.
[01:08:32.219 --> 01:08:44.004]  I mean, Bush goes to Canada for the months after he got elected, and they have the big Pan-American Union meeting, and they're openly saying, Pan-American Union, and it's in Canadian newspapers, but not in American newspapers.
[01:08:44.044 --> 01:08:45.045]  It's on C-SPAN.
[01:08:47.006 --> 01:08:52.089]  They're calling for a New World Order, but then you hear Rush Limbaugh saying the New World Order doesn't exist, don't talk about it.
[01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:53.791]  This is how it works.
[01:08:54.111 --> 01:09:09.261]  So, the caller, the last caller, Elma, was talking about why are all our jobs, you know, Ford factories and everything else, even to make the cars, now moving to Communist China?
[01:09:10.682 --> 01:09:11.502]  Why are they doing this?
[01:09:11.562 --> 01:09:15.325]  Why did they celebrate 50 years of Communism three or four years ago?
[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:24.656]  In Tiananmen Square with the Fortune 500 CEOs there in attendance for a party with Jiang Zemin at the time.
[01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:26.618]  I mean, they were there to celebrate!
[01:09:27.498 --> 01:09:29.340]  Because it's command and control.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.561]  Because left and right means nothing.
[01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:35.984]  Because China has a billion, three hundred million souls.
[01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:39.547]  In just a few years, it'll be a billion and a half people.
[01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:48.711]  Because they've got the forced abortion, the forced infanticide, they're pushing for the implantable chips, they're handing out the national ID cards, they're putting the cameras up.
[01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.873]  Their people do what they're told predominantly.
[01:09:52.994 --> 01:09:57.457]  Some of their farmers have been rioting lately over toxic waste killing their families.
[01:09:57.838 --> 01:09:58.858]  It's really bad over there.
[01:09:59.519 --> 01:10:09.206]  And so what the globals do is they create all these environmental laws, and the rest of it here, that ensure, and workers comp, and the taxes, and all of it,
[01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:17.118]  To where, you know, you've got to make it 15, 20 bucks an hour if you're going to have a family and only have one person working, and then you're going to be living at a subsistence level.
[01:10:18.879 --> 01:10:23.423]  And then you're competing against China, where, you know, the top factory worker gets two bucks an hour.
[01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:24.023]  Maybe.
[01:10:24.444 --> 01:10:25.865]  Most people get about 20 cents an hour.
[01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:39.496]  You've got the American citizen competing against millions and millions of people in private prisons in this country, building everything, doing telemarketing, working at the private factories built onto the prisons, working for an average of 20 cents an hour.
[01:10:41.258 --> 01:10:43.799]  So it ensures that wages will plunge.
[01:10:43.879 --> 01:10:52.003]  Then you bring in 30 million illegal aliens who work for 2-3 bucks an hour, and that drives the wages down even more.
[01:10:52.663 --> 01:10:56.325]  The illegal aliens will live 10 to a house, 5 to an apartment.
[01:10:56.905 --> 01:10:59.006]  They're not paying for insurance for their car or house.
[01:10:59.306 --> 01:11:00.927]  They're not paying for medical care.
[01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:02.968]  They're not paying taxes in most cases.
[01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.429]  So they can survive and even send money home.
[01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:10.864]  Whereas the rest of society struggles, and the middle class is evaporating.
[01:11:11.284 --> 01:11:12.824]  People fall into poverty.
[01:11:13.604 --> 01:11:16.165]  Their children get involved in crime.
[01:11:17.285 --> 01:11:19.025]  Family structures break down.
[01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:22.046]  Both family members, both adults, have to work.
[01:11:22.386 --> 01:11:24.326]  The state then gets to raise the children.
[01:11:24.966 --> 01:11:33.468]  This is all by design, but if you want to simplify it down to an economic model, the best economic model, true economic term,
[01:11:34.884 --> 01:11:37.125]  describing a system is mercantilism.
[01:11:38.205 --> 01:11:41.587]  And mercantilism was one of the major reasons for the Revolutionary War.
[01:11:42.287 --> 01:11:47.169]  We were not allowed to produce value-added items in the colonies.
[01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:51.211]  France didn't allow it in its colonies.
[01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:53.212]  England didn't allow it for its colonies.
[01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:55.533]  Spain didn't allow it in its colonies.
[01:11:57.353 --> 01:11:59.294]  The Dutch didn't allow it in their colonies.
[01:12:00.535 --> 01:12:03.776]  No value-added products
[01:12:05.271 --> 01:12:09.412]  Under mercantilism, things were, quote, free market to a limited extent.
[01:12:09.952 --> 01:12:12.553]  This was capitalism, not truly free market.
[01:12:12.793 --> 01:12:13.913]  Again, they confused the terms.
[01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:33.759]  The Queen would issue a private corporation that paid her a direct tax, and normally, of course, related to her, or he, would pay them a large portion of their earnings, and then the Queen would decide who got the license to do business.
[01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:39.338]  Mercantilism is the true term to describe what fascism really is.
[01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:40.779]  Okay?
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:50.608]  And in the new world, you could not build a metal shovel, pickaxe, you could not even legally forge firearms because, quote, it was value-added.
[01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:55.972]  People, of course, ignored this and there were a lot of confiscations and fights and arrests over it.
[01:12:56.913 --> 01:13:01.157]  You could only produce raw material, tobacco, cotton,
[01:13:02.955 --> 01:13:11.420]  Things of this nature, corn, wheat, maize, coal, whale oil.
[01:13:12.681 --> 01:13:14.121]  It was raw material.
[01:13:14.201 --> 01:13:20.545]  By law, we only issue licenses for these colonies for you to produce raw material.
[01:13:21.425 --> 01:13:26.268]  And then it must be shipped back to England.
[01:13:27.689 --> 01:13:30.230]  And of course, a large component of mercantilism was also slavery.
[01:13:32.065 --> 01:13:40.729]  Take the slaves, to go cut the cane, to make the sugar, to make the rum, to ship it back to buy more slaves.
[01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.110]  That's what they teach in school about mercantilism.
[01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:47.032]  That's one small facet of one example of how mercantilism worked.
[01:13:49.293 --> 01:13:53.035]  One small caveat of the larger system.
[01:13:54.175 --> 01:13:58.277]  Mercantilism, according to the French documents who invented it, and I've read
[01:14:00.814 --> 01:14:03.276]  Read the books by the people that invented the term economist.
[01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:09.882]  Okay, they set up mercantilism, I don't know, 300-something years ago, as a way to get control of the growing Renaissance.
[01:14:12.545 --> 01:14:17.409]  And so they would license you, and they would decide what you could do, and they said, it is about control.
[01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:22.014]  We can't have the colonies becoming independent, having their own infrastructure.
[01:14:22.034 --> 01:14:25.377]  They've got to be dependent on us for the value-added items.
[01:14:27.279 --> 01:14:30.680]  So you look at globalism today, and that's all it is.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.621]  All the mystery can now end.
[01:14:33.601 --> 01:14:34.462]  It's mercantilism.
[01:14:34.942 --> 01:14:38.303]  And the Trilateral Commission and others say this, quote, interdependent.
[01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:40.404]  You know, all these little code words they use.
[01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.825]  And I don't know why no one else is really pointing this out.
[01:14:46.086 --> 01:14:47.426]  People are calling it fascism.
[01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:51.607]  Well, fascism is a limited term that doesn't describe this system properly.
[01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:55.869]  Some economists try to describe it as a merger of fascism and socialism,
[01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:59.753]  And some of the globalist documents say that, but again, that's simplifying.
[01:15:00.694 --> 01:15:14.006]  Yes, they socialize our wealth to get control of us, and then through government conduits, transfer our wealth through a fascist pipeline into private institutions' coffers, but at the same time, they have now become government.
[01:15:14.666 --> 01:15:17.649]  So it isn't even purely fascism, it is mercantilism.
[01:15:19.511 --> 01:15:21.813]  And mercantilism is the system we face.
[01:15:23.749 --> 01:15:30.695]  And so they told you that NAFTA and GATT and the deals with China and all of it would give you milk and honey in the streets.
[01:15:30.755 --> 01:15:31.976]  Has it delivered prosperity?
[01:15:32.837 --> 01:15:35.219]  Record trade deficit every month it gets bigger.
[01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:38.141]  Record private and public and corporate debt.
[01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:40.243]  The family breaking down.
[01:15:40.643 --> 01:15:42.665]  Illegitimacy spiraling out of control.
[01:15:43.265 --> 01:15:46.928]  The highways and infrastructure is falling apart despite the fact they've got more money than ever.
[01:15:48.129 --> 01:15:49.931]  They're not even putting money into the infrastructure now.
[01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:56.288]  Across the board, we're being pirated, we're being looted, we're being shut down.
[01:15:56.628 --> 01:16:08.857]  The globalists, like a bird in an embryonic egg, are using us as the food supply.
[01:16:09.637 --> 01:16:17.262]  The yolk is using the white area of the egg, that's America, to feed itself, to grow.
[01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:18.423]  And so,
[01:16:19.767 --> 01:16:22.829]  The sustenance is being transferred to China.
[01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.991]  All the factories, all the industries.
[01:16:25.011 --> 01:16:26.332]  It's now even leaving Mexico.
[01:16:26.572 --> 01:16:28.554]  It's even leaving India.
[01:16:28.594 --> 01:16:29.595]  They're going to more service.
[01:16:29.955 --> 01:16:31.036]  It's all going to China.
[01:16:31.636 --> 01:16:34.799]  Because a select group of globalists have gone into China.
[01:16:35.139 --> 01:16:36.640]  They get the best slave wages.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.641]  They get the best deals.
[01:16:38.062 --> 01:16:40.563]  They then leverage out all their competition here.
[01:16:41.144 --> 01:16:46.128]  Use that as a form of economic mercantilism to shut down all industry in this country.
[01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:52.287]  And then the globalists will have total control.
[01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:56.789]  And that is the plan, getting rid of the middle class.
[01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:58.891]  That's what mercantilism is designed to do.
[01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:00.772]  Making us totally dependent.
[01:17:01.192 --> 01:17:14.840]  I mean, folks, they threw it in your face with the movie Rollerball, where Houston is the energy city and Tokyo is the information city and there's all these countries and regions that are run by a city and
[01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:24.625]  It's this corporate board that runs the planet, and it's about controlling and have interdependence, and the government pushes drugs on the population and tries to drug everyone.
[01:17:26.086 --> 01:17:32.428]  But then you look at the real world today, that's really happening, because you could read Trilateral Commission documents in the early seventies, and that's what they were saying!
[01:17:33.808 --> 01:17:35.829]  I mean, this is what they're doing!
[01:17:36.689 --> 01:17:37.690]  And they flaunt it!
[01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:40.351]  They flaunt their operation against us!
[01:17:42.852 --> 01:17:43.432]  It's sick!
[01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:52.570]  Alright, so you brought up an important question, Elma, and now I haven't gotten to a lot of the callers, and I've got guests coming up, but uh... It's so sad.
[01:17:54.031 --> 01:17:54.671]  It's so sad.
[01:17:55.692 --> 01:17:58.013]  And their answer to globalism shutting down our economy?
[01:17:58.093 --> 01:17:59.033]  More globalism!
[01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:03.496]  And they're setting up a global tax, and global regulation, and global control.
[01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:11.720]  And so once they've got our industry, once they've brought America down to second world status, we enter into the new world order completely,
[01:18:12.341 --> 01:18:19.324]  We're used as the military arm to take over different, quote, rogue states, third world countries that haven't played ball.
[01:18:19.724 --> 01:18:22.805]  We're then blamed for the atrocities that are committed.
[01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:27.527]  The EU and the UN comes out looking like the good guys on the global stage.
[01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:30.148]  But America was only one component of this.
[01:18:30.868 --> 01:18:40.792]  We're being used as the energy source for the next cycle in the life cycle, in the phase
[01:18:41.693 --> 01:18:42.475]  of this creature.
[01:18:43.116 --> 01:18:44.699]  It's in its cocoon right now.
[01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:48.465]  And when it pops out, it's not going to be a pretty butterfly.
[01:18:49.006 --> 01:18:52.553]  It's chewing a hole in the end of the cocoon to exit right now.
[01:18:53.999 --> 01:18:55.139]  Why do you wear watches?
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.021]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[01:18:58.481 --> 01:19:06.043]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.

[01:19:53.829 --> 01:20:02.434]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:20:02.654 --> 01:20:13.941]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:16.783]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:17.143 --> 01:20:23.587]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:20:23.747 --> 01:20:25.628]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:20:25.828 --> 01:20:31.852]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:20:32.112 --> 01:20:37.755]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:20:53.777 --> 01:20:54.757]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:54.837 --> 01:20:59.618]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:59.778 --> 01:21:07.580]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:13.221]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:13.421 --> 01:21:20.403]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:20.703 --> 01:21:26.027]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:26.287 --> 01:21:31.030]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:38.996]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:21:39.316 --> 01:21:44.799]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.403]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.723 --> 01:21:52.005]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.006 --> 01:21:59.631]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:21:59.991 --> 01:22:10.079]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, and particularly the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.240]  With a 100% kill.

[01:22:44.316 --> 01:22:45.977]  Herbs and spices, or doctors and drugs.

[01:22:59.261 --> 01:23:01.621]  Mary just hung up from Oklahoma and was about to go to hers.
[01:23:01.661 --> 01:23:02.462]  Let's go to Ruben.
[01:23:02.602 --> 01:23:03.482]  Ruben in Ohio.
[01:23:03.522 --> 01:23:04.182]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[01:23:05.703 --> 01:23:06.123]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:07.242 --> 01:23:08.723]  Enjoy, listen to your show, you're rocking.
[01:23:09.804 --> 01:23:12.046]  Are you familiar with Judicial Watch?
[01:23:12.707 --> 01:23:13.007]  Yes.
[01:23:13.707 --> 01:23:26.098]  The reason why I ask is because I'm a breakfast cook in a fancy restaurant here in Aurora and a guy who used to be on Judicial Watch comes in there and eats breakfast and I serve and I started talking politics with him.
[01:23:26.618 --> 01:23:28.780]  Can you give me a real brief education?
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.082]  The man's name is Larry Klayman with a K.
[01:23:31.917 --> 01:23:33.977]  Yeah, ran for Senate in Florida.
[01:23:34.197 --> 01:23:35.138]  Yeah, I know Larry Klayman.
[01:23:35.158 --> 01:23:37.538]  We've had him on probably ten times over the years.
[01:23:38.058 --> 01:23:38.998]  He was the head of it.
[01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:41.839]  And now he's handed it over to somebody else.
[01:23:41.899 --> 01:23:42.999]  I mean, they do a lot of good work.
[01:23:43.079 --> 01:23:47.320]  They've brought out information about government involvement, 9-11, FBI agents.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:57.682]  It was a Judicial Watch press conference on the National Press Club where FBI agent Robert Wright and Larry Klayman got up and shared the Bush's vacation with the Bin Laden's.
[01:23:58.182 --> 01:23:59.642]  So that was Larry Klayman who
[01:24:00.655 --> 01:24:01.976]  I always hear you say that quote.
[01:24:03.056 --> 01:24:04.237]  I can't tell you what I know.
[01:24:04.317 --> 01:24:08.779]  They both talk about it and then they both hold up the letter and say, we've been threatened with arrest.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:09.600]  Wow.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.700]  If we tell you what we know.
[01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:11.841]  Wow.
[01:24:12.021 --> 01:24:12.401]  Okay.
[01:24:12.441 --> 01:24:14.462]  So obviously he's on the up and up then.
[01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:16.443]  I guess I don't have to give him one of your videos.
[01:24:17.504 --> 01:24:18.705]  No, go ahead and give it to Larry.
[01:24:19.065 --> 01:24:20.005]  Okay.
[01:24:20.065 --> 01:24:20.306]  Cool.
[01:24:21.006 --> 01:24:24.528]  And, um, uh, I forget what else I was going to ask.
[01:24:24.588 --> 01:24:25.108]  I'll let you go.
[01:24:25.969 --> 01:24:26.749]  Thanks for, uh,
[01:24:27.168 --> 01:24:30.153]  Looking at the big picture and letting us see what's going on.
[01:24:36.957 --> 01:24:38.298]  See what you see with your own eyes.
[01:24:38.839 --> 01:24:39.800]  Rob in Wyoming.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:40.641]  Rob, go ahead.
[01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:45.205]  Hey Alex, I wanted to talk about Mr. Sanders' interview yesterday a little bit.
[01:24:45.646 --> 01:24:48.008]  He kept invoking Occam's Razor, you remember?
[01:24:48.028 --> 01:24:49.670]  Yeah, well let me just say this.
[01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:55.255]  The more I thought about that interview, it was so ridiculous, I didn't even know really how to respond.
[01:24:55.956 --> 01:24:57.257]  I mean, he had no facts.
[01:24:57.317 --> 01:24:59.940]  His whole article was just a joke.
[01:25:00.635 --> 01:25:03.917]  And then every time I'd heard him bring up facts, he just said, well, I just don't want to believe that.
[01:25:03.997 --> 01:25:05.158]  I just can't believe that.
[01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:09.561]  And I would bring up real issues, and I would sit there, I'm not a betting man, folks.
[01:25:09.601 --> 01:25:13.123]  I've never even bought my wife a lottery ticket one time as a joke.
[01:25:13.644 --> 01:25:15.004]  I'm not a gambler, is my point.
[01:25:15.245 --> 01:25:19.187]  But I mean, I make the point, okay, $10,000, this is a real document.
[01:25:19.567 --> 01:25:21.429]  And you'd notice he wouldn't bet me, but go ahead.
[01:25:21.869 --> 01:25:22.810]  Well, yeah, that's just it.
[01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:25.471]  Same with Chertoff of Propaganda Mechanics.
[01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:29.414]  They kept saying, I'm not programmed to respond in that area every time a point was raised.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.426]  And this guy kept saying, Occam's Razor, Occam's Razor over and over.
[01:25:34.371 --> 01:25:37.272]  The idea being that the simplest explanation is the best.
[01:25:37.552 --> 01:25:47.616]  Yeah, and Occam's Razor says guys in a cave didn't make NORAD stand down and run a CIA drill of flying hijacked jets into those same buildings at the very same time it was happening.
[01:25:47.856 --> 01:25:49.417]  Right, William of Ockham did not say that.
[01:25:49.437 --> 01:25:52.258]  The drill was in case the globalists got caught doing it.
[01:25:52.278 --> 01:25:53.238]  They could say it was a drill.
[01:25:53.258 --> 01:25:53.678]  Go ahead.
[01:25:53.978 --> 01:25:56.839]  Well, it doesn't say the simplest explanation is the best.
[01:25:56.859 --> 01:25:57.940]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.602]  For example, if you had two philosophers 3,000 years ago trying to explain the phenomenon of thunder,
[01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:06.184]  One guy says it's God-cracking walnuts.
[01:26:06.685 --> 01:26:11.549]  The other guy says it's electric ionization and displacement of air molecules hitting the eardrum.
[01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:14.732]  Second explanation is much more complex than the first one.
[01:26:15.073 --> 01:26:20.278]  Does William Ockham of Ockham say that God-cracking walnuts is the better explanation because it's simpler?
[01:26:21.506 --> 01:26:22.127]  I like that.
[01:26:22.207 --> 01:26:23.528]  God-cracking walnuts.
[01:26:24.049 --> 01:26:25.210]  It has to fit the facts.
[01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:26.191]  It can't just be simpler.
[01:26:26.251 --> 01:26:28.853]  And even then, that doesn't mean it is the right explanation.
[01:26:28.893 --> 01:26:30.755]  It just means it's more likely to be the right one.
[01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:33.497]  Besides, Occam's Razor supports our side.
[01:26:33.557 --> 01:26:42.165]  It's not the simpler explanation to say that guys in a cave engineered this and just happened to do it on the right day when the CIA was running drills and all that stuff.
[01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:45.849]  So I get tired of these guys keeping on invoking Occam's Razor.
[01:26:46.508 --> 01:26:48.368]  When that is the opposite of what it says.
[01:26:48.549 --> 01:26:49.669]  Everything's fine.
[01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:50.429]  Look around you.
[01:26:50.449 --> 01:26:52.289]  Don't you feel like everything's fine?
[01:26:52.309 --> 01:26:52.930]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:54.250]  Rob, excellent points.
[01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:57.191]  Is it Stavos or Stavos in Canada?
[01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:57.611]  Go ahead.
[01:26:57.631 --> 01:26:59.031]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:02.952]  I just want to say, yesterday's show, I had a good laugh.
[01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:03.792]  That was awesome.
[01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:05.713]  You guys tag-teamed that fool so good.
[01:27:06.113 --> 01:27:08.373]  Yeah, but he was so pathetic, though.
[01:27:08.413 --> 01:27:14.695]  It almost felt like I just beat up a defenseless, mind-numbed robot at the end of it.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.163]  The other thing I want to call you about is up here in Canada.
[01:27:22.824 --> 01:27:25.666]  I just got this from the Real Estate News, an article.
[01:27:26.386 --> 01:27:34.671]  It says that we here in Canada do not have any property rights whatsoever and it explains that if the government wants to take away your house,
[01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:40.220]  They can take it away without giving any, you know, reason or even compensation.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.562]  But, I mean, notice it's the Real Estate Council telling you you don't have any rights.
[01:27:45.102 --> 01:27:46.062]  You don't have any rights?
[01:27:46.082 --> 01:27:46.923]  Submit to us.
[01:27:47.023 --> 01:27:50.304]  We are going to pay off the politician to take your property so we can have it.
[01:27:50.844 --> 01:27:51.905]  Resistance is futile.
[01:27:53.409 --> 01:27:57.292]  And just to give one example to people... I know, I hear similar rants from our real estate groups.
[01:27:57.753 --> 01:27:59.514]  Submit to your leaders!
[01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:05.018]  Report on your neighbors brought to you by the... And I'm like, what are they doing involved in politics?
[01:28:05.058 --> 01:28:06.239]  Because they are politics!
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:14.606]  Exactly, and every time you go and you try to say something against them, because I went and I tried to talk to these people and they're like, no, it's a Semitic, no!
[01:28:14.926 --> 01:28:16.927]  Oh, I know, you can say, government wants something wrong.
[01:28:16.947 --> 01:28:17.868]  Oh, I'm a Semitic!
[01:28:18.388 --> 01:28:20.270]  And listen, it's worse than that, okay?
[01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:22.632]  I mean, there's so much of this.
[01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:24.727]  But I just want to give one example.
[01:28:24.747 --> 01:28:32.729]  Even, like, former NHL player, uh, Louis Fontenato, uh, who's in British Columbia, he lost his farm.
[01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:38.090]  The government demolished his house and flooded the whole thing because they needed it for conservation.
[01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:40.870]  It's all part of the new freedom, sir.
[01:28:44.071 --> 01:28:44.991]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.471 --> 01:28:47.071]  The empire's on the run.

[01:29:53.897 --> 01:29:55.518]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.638 --> 01:29:59.741]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.881 --> 01:30:02.762]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.842 --> 01:30:09.567]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:12.748]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.350]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:20.193]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:34.956]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:41.737]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[01:30:45.578 --> 01:30:46.018]  803-4438.
[01:30:46.078 --> 01:30:47.399]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:47.839 --> 01:30:51.740]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:30:53.241 --> 01:31:01.204]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:31:01.604 --> 01:31:02.864]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:31:03.084 --> 01:31:03.725]  Now check this out.
[01:31:04.105 --> 01:31:07.526]  The average American consumes 2-3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:31:07.846 --> 01:31:08.927]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:13.169]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:31:13.429 --> 01:31:14.209]  Your health suffers.
[01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:15.090]  It's that simple.
[01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:19.393]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[01:31:19.813 --> 01:31:27.738]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:31:35.744 --> 01:31:36.264]  A Garicus Bio.

[01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.566]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:57.333]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.353 --> 01:32:01.235]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.218 --> 01:32:16.245]  I've actually heard ads run on radio and seen a few print ads run a few years ago by the National Bar Association based up in Chicago.
[01:32:17.828 --> 01:32:21.870]  And they actually came out and said, oh, we just want to advise you, the public, for your own rights.
[01:32:22.431 --> 01:32:23.671]  Juries are not needed.
[01:32:23.751 --> 01:32:24.852]  Juries are not good.
[01:32:26.413 --> 01:32:28.054]  America needs to get rid of juries.
[01:32:28.094 --> 01:32:28.854]  Juries are bad.
[01:32:29.495 --> 01:32:31.456]  Then you hear neocon talk show hosts call for it.
[01:32:32.336 --> 01:32:34.397]  Now, why would lawyers be against juries?
[01:32:34.417 --> 01:32:38.840]  Especially these evil trial lawyers that want to win all these judgments.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.781]  Well, no, it's the leaders of the lawyers.
[01:32:41.994 --> 01:32:44.237]  And you've got the feds wanting to get rid of juries.
[01:32:44.337 --> 01:32:47.581]  I mean, and your little public service announcements.
[01:32:48.354 --> 01:32:50.076]  Oh, this is, it's propaganda.
[01:32:50.396 --> 01:32:55.521]  Hi, this is the Real Estate Council, and we wanted to remind you that you don't really own your property.
[01:32:55.541 --> 01:33:06.171]  I remember seeing the Land Commissioner a few years ago on TV with a little paid-for public service announcement with your money going, contrary to what wearing a cowboy hat, so it's alright.
[01:33:06.751 --> 01:33:11.776]  Contrary to what many Texans believe, many of you don't really own your property as you thought you did.
[01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:13.017]  We're going to be doing some
[01:33:13.536 --> 01:33:15.657]  Special assessments of that?
[01:33:16.198 --> 01:33:18.039]  Whereas we believe in property rights.
[01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:19.500]  Some of you don't really own your land.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.722]  We're going to be... It's everywhere.
[01:33:23.022 --> 01:33:24.223]  I mean, they're just telling you.
[01:33:24.423 --> 01:33:25.724]  Well, it must be true.
[01:33:25.904 --> 01:33:26.725]  I heard.
[01:33:26.745 --> 01:33:28.866]  I heard.
[01:33:28.946 --> 01:33:30.147]  I mean, it's the government.
[01:33:31.127 --> 01:33:32.548]  He's wearing a cowboy hat.
[01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:33.429]  I can trust him.
[01:33:34.355 --> 01:33:40.077]  We're about to go to Chuck Baldwin for the next 25 minutes to talk about the phony conservatives and just go over the plethora of examples.
[01:33:40.097 --> 01:33:41.558]  He's an expert on exposing that.
[01:33:41.578 --> 01:33:43.679]  We really appreciate him.
[01:33:43.879 --> 01:33:55.784]  But before we go to Chuck, my friends, I have, and of course he was a vice presidential candidate with Michael Perutka, who I voted for, Constitution Party.
[01:33:56.641 --> 01:34:00.022]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[01:34:00.483 --> 01:34:07.445]  Spends 35 minutes on the police state, the sound cannons, the surveillance blimps, the media being arrested, the FEMA camp in New York.
[01:34:07.826 --> 01:34:12.027]  Spends an hour then on 9-11 and how the Global has orchestrated it and executed it.
[01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:17.670]  Down to the finest detail, the latest information, Building 7, NORAD stand down.
[01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:21.111]  All of it, it's blowing people away, it's waking folks up.
[01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:28.387]  The third hour is on Schwarzenegger, the Bush-Nazi connection, 50 years ago and today.
[01:34:28.987 --> 01:34:34.453]  It gets into the occult, Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, shows you they're driving ideology and philosophy.
[01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:37.576]  And the last 10 minutes, the last 10 minutes,
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:48.184]  We show Bush giving his swearing-in speech, and of course his swearing-in oath, and then show how he's dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution in a rapid-fire presentation.
[01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:48.944]  That's how it ends.
[01:34:49.384 --> 01:34:53.205]  And the DVD's got 25 minutes of extras, so it's three hours long.
[01:34:53.505 --> 01:34:55.486]  Three hours and something long.
[01:34:56.106 --> 01:34:59.728]  The VHS is two and a half, two hours, thirty-five minutes long.
[01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.569]  The film is all there, just not the extras.
[01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:05.891]  You need to get this.
[01:35:06.491 --> 01:35:08.173]  One copy is $25.95.
[01:35:08.273 --> 01:35:09.154]  Three films in one.
[01:35:09.214 --> 01:35:10.655]  Second copy, $19.95.
[01:35:10.695 --> 01:35:13.017]  And it goes down to $14 the more copies you get.
[01:35:13.598 --> 01:35:17.881]  Some of my other films, while everything else is going up in price with inflation, we're lowering prices.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:25.645]  The second, the last film I made is only $5.95 when you get one copy for $19.95.
[01:35:25.745 --> 01:35:26.645]  American Dictators.
[01:35:27.046 --> 01:35:28.086]  I mean, it's a good film.
[01:35:28.387 --> 01:35:29.307]  You cannot beat that.
[01:35:29.668 --> 01:35:30.448]  Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:30.488 --> 01:35:32.570]  You can get it for very low prices.
[01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:33.911]  One of my best films.
[01:35:34.391 --> 01:35:35.452]  Almost three hours long.

[01:35:55.829 --> 01:35:56.430]  Air them again.
[01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:58.312]  If you haven't aired the new one, get it and air it.
[01:35:58.332 --> 01:36:00.033]  I want to commend those that have made copies.
[01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:01.615]  Make copies of this new one.
[01:36:01.675 --> 01:36:03.337]  It has such a powerful effect.
[01:36:03.877 --> 01:36:04.758]  A big effect.

[01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:34.855]  It's an insane deal.
[01:36:34.875 --> 01:36:35.395]  15 cents a day.
[01:36:35.735 --> 01:36:36.756]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:36.796 --> 01:36:37.497]  Please take action.
[01:36:37.897 --> 01:36:38.918]  Alright, Chuck Baldwin.
[01:36:39.219 --> 01:36:41.721]  I mean, every week he writes these amazing columns.
[01:36:42.121 --> 01:36:43.282]  There's a lot of research.
[01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:45.964]  Points out that Bush isn't a conservative.
[01:36:46.325 --> 01:36:48.066]  Exposes the control left as well.
[01:36:48.587 --> 01:36:52.110]  He was the VP running mate of Michael Perutka, who I supported for president.
[01:36:53.585 --> 01:36:59.707]  I couldn't fully support the Libertarians because of the abortion position, even though I do support third parties, period.
[01:37:00.567 --> 01:37:05.388]  But he's there in Pensacola, where I'm on the radio every day, and he has his own little radio broadcast.
[01:37:06.108 --> 01:37:08.329]  Chuck, it's a great honor to have you on with us.
[01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:09.749]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:37:09.769 --> 01:37:10.549]  Glad to be with you.
[01:37:10.689 --> 01:37:11.010]  You bet.
[01:37:11.050 --> 01:37:13.190]  Thanks for sitting through my diatribe over the film.
[01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:16.751]  Tell us a little bit about your website, Chuck Boland Live.
[01:37:17.523 --> 01:37:26.285]  And then tell us about how you woke up to the phony left-right paradigm, and then let's just plunge for the next 21 minutes into Bush's real record.
[01:37:27.085 --> 01:37:27.785]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[01:37:27.805 --> 01:37:38.807]  Well, the website is www.chuckbaldwinlive.com, all one word, chuckbaldwinlive.com, and people can go there and like your website, it has a lot of information.
[01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:46.288]  What woke me up to the phoniness of the so-called conservatives within the establishment Republican Party
[01:37:46.972 --> 01:37:50.273]  I think I would have to go back to the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:37:51.553 --> 01:38:05.497]  On my show, I interviewed David Shippers at least twice, and I read his book, and he was absolutely... His presentation was life-changing to me.
[01:38:05.517 --> 01:38:09.238]  It helped me to understand what was going on in Washington, D.C.
[01:38:09.278 --> 01:38:10.758]  and how... He was blocked!
[01:38:11.639 --> 01:38:11.939]  Pardon?
[01:38:12.199 --> 01:38:14.739]  He was blocked by the Republican leadership.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.640]  The Republican leadership?
[01:38:17.732 --> 01:38:21.697]  It kept Bill Clinton in office intentionally.
[01:38:23.019 --> 01:38:28.626]  This idea that the Republicans wanted Bill Clinton out of office is a hoax.
[01:38:29.955 --> 01:38:31.836]  Well, people can believe this now.
[01:38:31.876 --> 01:38:34.398]  They couldn't believe it at the time when I was pointing it out, and others were.
[01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:35.819]  But, I mean, look at it, Chuck.
[01:38:35.839 --> 01:38:37.160]  I mean, this is a great point you bring up.
[01:38:38.101 --> 01:38:38.922]  Bush Jr.
[01:38:38.942 --> 01:38:42.664]  gets in office, says, hands off, Congressman Burton, leave Clinton alone.
[01:38:42.964 --> 01:38:48.148]  Now, they're reporting that he's, quote, a surrogate member of the family, that they love each other.
[01:38:48.408 --> 01:38:50.290]  Well, yeah, they're crime partners from MENA.
[01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.670]  Go ahead.
[01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:53.752]  Well, and you're right about that.
[01:38:53.812 --> 01:38:58.696]  I mean, I'm not at liberty to quote sources on this, and that's okay.
[01:38:59.698 --> 01:39:01.680]  I know people close to Bill Clinton.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:23.296]  My family is from Arkansas, and I have a lot of contacts there, and they have told me face-to-face, this is not hearsay, that the Bushes and the Clintons have been close friends for many, many years, going back to the Clinton years in the White House, and even before that.
[01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:25.298]  Well, it's admitted that Bush Sr.
[01:39:25.318 --> 01:39:28.080]  and Clinton met 11 times before the election.
[01:39:29.033 --> 01:39:34.256]  Yeah, and they've also met informally and, uh, taken vacations together and things of that nature.
[01:39:34.576 --> 01:39:35.976]  Well, there's no more debating it!
[01:39:35.996 --> 01:39:39.538]  I mean, it says he's a surrogate member of the family, stays at their house, they love him.
[01:39:39.618 --> 01:39:39.878]  Yeah.
[01:39:40.399 --> 01:39:42.580]  Yeah, so they've been close for years.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.860]  Volka who Bush is appointing.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.921]  Abortionist almost all the post.
[01:39:46.121 --> 01:39:48.563]  People that go after Judge Roy Moore, they get promoted.
[01:39:48.623 --> 01:39:48.823]  Right.
[01:39:49.223 --> 01:39:53.905]  Alberto Gonzalez wants 12-year-olds not to tell their parents when they have... I mean, let's go over it.
[01:39:54.946 --> 01:39:57.307]  Well, yeah, everything you just said there is true.
[01:39:58.194 --> 01:40:05.755]  You know, this idea that there's two parties in Washington that are ideologically opposite is just not so.
[01:40:06.396 --> 01:40:09.096]  The same power brokers are supporting both parties.
[01:40:09.876 --> 01:40:24.479]  And with that kind of money that's up there, and we're talking not millions, but billions of dollars, the leadership of both parties is in the hip pocket of these multinational corporations, as you point out on your program all the time.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.502]  And because of that, there is really no difference between the two parties at the national level.
[01:40:30.542 --> 01:40:34.443]  And I want to make that emphasis, because when you get into the state and the local level... Big difference.
[01:40:34.583 --> 01:40:35.423]  Yeah, big difference.
[01:40:35.844 --> 01:40:39.065]  But in Washington, D.C., the power brokers control both parties.
[01:40:41.025 --> 01:40:41.806]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:41.866 --> 01:40:42.806]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:40:42.926 --> 01:40:48.788]  Bill Clinton took some restrictions off supercomputers that were perfect for building nuclear weapons and MIRV technology.
[01:40:49.715 --> 01:40:52.216]  That way the missile has 20 warheads instead of one, folks.
[01:40:52.256 --> 01:40:52.996]  Thank you, Bill Clinton.
[01:40:53.236 --> 01:41:03.960]  But it was Republican companies, Rumsfeld and others, that were actually doing the transfers, and then Bush takes all restrictions off, and the neocons won't talk about it.
[01:41:05.301 --> 01:41:07.382]  No, well, the neocons are part of the problem.
[01:41:07.462 --> 01:41:09.963]  I mean, they got their hands out along with everybody else.
[01:41:10.023 --> 01:41:16.285]  I mean, everybody wants a piece of the kitty, and you know, it's just such an entrenched
[01:41:16.912 --> 01:41:22.334]  Monopoly now that I think really only a miracle of God is going to help us overcome it.
[01:41:23.095 --> 01:41:28.657]  People like you are doing Yeoman's work and bringing the awareness to the American people and helping people understand.
[01:41:29.257 --> 01:41:40.082]  But I really think until people begin to do some personal research and read on their own, study on their own, get informed on their own, then and only then are they going to be able to, I think, the blinders come off.
[01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:45.822]  Until then, they're just going to be subject to the propaganda media, which is going to continue to sedate them.
[01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:48.744]  Well, Sean Hannity says every child needs a microchip.
[01:41:48.784 --> 01:41:49.745]  How is that conservative?
[01:41:49.785 --> 01:41:51.046]  I mean... Sean said that?
[01:41:51.386 --> 01:41:51.606]  Yes.
[01:41:52.467 --> 01:41:53.067]  Good grief.
[01:41:53.508 --> 01:41:56.210]  I saw him on Fox News about two and a half years ago say it.
[01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:57.531]  This is great.
[01:41:57.631 --> 01:41:58.572]  Every child needs one.
[01:41:59.372 --> 01:42:00.193]  That's unbelievable.
[01:42:00.653 --> 01:42:03.415]  Well, you know, it just goes back to the same old thing.
[01:42:03.455 --> 01:42:05.577]  I mean, you know, the Rush Limbaugh's, the Sean Hannity's,
[01:42:06.061 --> 01:42:09.224]  You know, they're nothing but puppet spokesmen for the Republican Party.
[01:42:09.244 --> 01:42:09.865]  Well, here's one.
[01:42:09.945 --> 01:42:17.992]  Clear Channel is putting up a billboard that says Los Angeles, Mexico, crossing out California, saying that it's La Ricanquista.
[01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:20.174]  Now, why is Clear Channel saying that?
[01:42:21.115 --> 01:42:25.779]  Well, there's a big effort, as you know, to erase not only the southern border, but
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.940]  All the borders in the Northern Hemisphere.
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:34.922]  Bush wants total amnesty, but then they call his national ID card bill something to fight that, when it actually opens the border.
[01:42:35.142 --> 01:42:36.202]  Yeah, yeah it does.
[01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:46.524]  And the idea of creating not only that, but a common currency similar to the Euro, that may be called the Amero, or something of that nature, where that there would be a common currency here in this country.
[01:42:47.164 --> 01:42:52.605]  And the economic unity of Canada, Mexico, and the United States would be achieved.
[01:42:52.645 --> 01:42:54.465]  That's Bush's ultimate objective.
[01:42:55.865 --> 01:42:56.986]  And he's openly said it.
[01:42:57.366 --> 01:42:58.486]  He's openly pushing it.
[01:42:59.307 --> 01:43:02.749]  But they're telling us that global government doesn't exist.
[01:43:03.449 --> 01:43:06.751]  I should also add, Chuck Baldwin's also a pastor there in the Pensacola area.
[01:43:08.612 --> 01:43:10.613]  Look, the faith-based initiative.
[01:43:11.513 --> 01:43:13.114]  They're saying this is of the Lord.
[01:43:13.174 --> 01:43:21.859]  We should have the feds paying the churches billions and they admit that churches will have to hire Buddhists, Satanists, agnostics, you name it.
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:38.994]  Yeah, this is one of the things that really, really concerns me more than anything we've talked about so far, and that is the way that the churches have been duped by the Bush administration, almost becoming parrot spokesmen for the administration.
[01:43:39.034 --> 01:43:41.856]  You know, our history is rich with
[01:43:43.492 --> 01:43:47.613]  The spirit of distrust for the federal government.
[01:43:47.653 --> 01:43:49.194]  I mean, that's a healthy thing.
[01:43:49.654 --> 01:43:50.754]  That's not anarchy.
[01:43:51.114 --> 01:43:53.995]  That's the Declaration of Independence.
[01:43:54.135 --> 01:43:57.756]  It was the Black Brigade, the pastors and priests that led the war.
[01:43:57.956 --> 01:43:58.856]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:59.016 --> 01:44:01.697]  Without it, there would have been no war for independence.
[01:44:02.397 --> 01:44:08.279]  But I mean, we have always historically been, as Christian pastors, we have been courageous men of God.
[01:44:08.959 --> 01:44:22.008]  that have been willing to speak the truth regardless of fear favor or or party affiliation you know we have called the spade a spade regardless of you know of who's in the crosshairs nowadays you know we have become
[01:44:23.428 --> 01:44:24.869]  robots for the party.
[01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:27.471]  We've actually been co-opted.
[01:44:28.691 --> 01:44:29.372]  Here's an example.
[01:44:29.532 --> 01:44:33.894]  A big conservative Baptist church about two years ago, one of my friends brought me a flyer they didn't even remember.
[01:44:34.355 --> 01:44:38.857]  They said, don't even discuss politics in the pews or at lunch after church.
[01:44:39.758 --> 01:44:41.319]  I mean, that's mind control!
[01:44:42.019 --> 01:44:49.704]  But you know, it's even worse than that because they are discussing, that may be true in that church, but what most of them are doing is they're discussing politics very blatantly, but it's
[01:44:50.194 --> 01:44:52.054]  It's a biased politics.
[01:44:52.074 --> 01:44:55.595]  In other words, they are propagandists for the Republican Party.
[01:44:55.715 --> 01:45:02.696]  I have had national so-called Christian talk show hosts say that I am of the devil because I talk about bohemian robe and skull and bones.
[01:45:03.496 --> 01:45:06.177]  I have been called a liar when it's admitted they go there.
[01:45:08.317 --> 01:45:09.837]  Well, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:45:10.358 --> 01:45:16.059]  Most of the criticism I receive comes from fellow Christians and preachers in particular.
[01:45:16.939 --> 01:45:17.759]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:45:17.939 --> 01:45:18.739]  They have been
[01:45:19.361 --> 01:45:22.662]  Literally co-opted by the Republican Party.
[01:45:22.682 --> 01:45:23.462]  Well, you're a pastor.
[01:45:23.522 --> 01:45:25.223]  It seems to me like it's a spirit.
[01:45:25.283 --> 01:45:26.743]  It's like they all speak the same.
[01:45:26.963 --> 01:45:27.904]  They act the same.
[01:45:28.884 --> 01:45:30.204]  Would you agree it's almost a spirit?
[01:45:30.844 --> 01:45:31.765]  I think it is a spirit.
[01:45:32.525 --> 01:45:35.886]  And I think it is a supernatural delusion.
[01:45:36.046 --> 01:45:36.566]  I really do.
[01:45:37.146 --> 01:45:43.148]  I think this battle, as the scripture said, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:45.683]  I really think this is a supernatural battle.
[01:45:45.963 --> 01:46:06.299]  I think this is between the forces of good and evil, God and Satan, and unfortunately many Christians have been, I think, co-opted, been blinded by power and by all the trappings of opulence and success, orientation, etc., etc., and everybody wants to sit at the king's table.
[01:46:08.368 --> 01:46:11.889]  It's amazing to see this happen, but there's so many other things.
[01:46:11.929 --> 01:46:13.029]  I mean, the gun control.
[01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:22.992]  Bush comes out and pushes for the assault weapons ban, passes all this federal funding to go after people locally for guns, and I don't hear a neocon talk about it.
[01:46:23.692 --> 01:46:29.513]  No, and they not only do they not talk about it, they don't even want to admit that he spoke out in favor of it.
[01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:37.135]  And as he said at the Congress, and thankfully the Congress didn't pass it, we need to thank the Republicans in Congress for that.
[01:46:38.363 --> 01:46:39.143]  He would have signed it.
[01:46:39.403 --> 01:46:41.305]  But, you know, people don't even want to think that.
[01:46:42.486 --> 01:46:44.527]  Again, this guy can do no wrong.
[01:46:44.547 --> 01:46:45.908]  It's amazing.
[01:46:45.928 --> 01:46:47.349]  You know, we used to stand on principle.
[01:46:47.369 --> 01:46:47.750]  I say we.
[01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:49.531]  I mean, come on, conservative Christian pastors.
[01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:51.232]  We used to stand on principle.
[01:46:51.272 --> 01:46:53.174]  And I go back to the moral majority days, Alex.
[01:46:53.214 --> 01:46:55.095]  I mean, I was there with Jerry Falwell.
[01:46:55.656 --> 01:46:59.839]  I mean, you could go down the list of all these guys that we talk about at the national level.
[01:46:59.879 --> 01:47:00.980]  I've been there, done that.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.180]  I've sat at the table.
[01:47:02.241 --> 01:47:03.501]  I've been on the same podium.
[01:47:04.182 --> 01:47:05.263]  I've been the whole nine yards.
[01:47:05.894 --> 01:47:07.475]  And we used to be about principle.
[01:47:07.535 --> 01:47:12.897]  We used to be about taking a stand for righteousness and what was right for the country, regardless of the consequences.
[01:47:12.977 --> 01:47:13.877]  Nowadays we're not.
[01:47:13.917 --> 01:47:16.458]  We are as partisan in general.
[01:47:16.538 --> 01:47:18.319]  We are as partisan as the left.
[01:47:18.919 --> 01:47:22.060]  And I think as... But being partisan is only on the surface.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.941]  Being partisan is only on the surface.
[01:47:24.181 --> 01:47:28.263]  The two sides are really, as you said, one unit, and they just play us off against each other.
[01:47:28.283 --> 01:47:28.763]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:47:28.783 --> 01:47:29.943]  But the Christians don't see that.
[01:47:30.384 --> 01:47:31.464]  And the pastors don't see that.
[01:47:31.897 --> 01:47:37.278]  To them, you know, they are promoting righteousness by promoting the Republican Party.
[01:47:37.558 --> 01:47:38.959]  They really believe that.
[01:47:39.339 --> 01:47:44.620]  They really believe that they are doing God's service by supporting the Republican Party.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:50.761]  The Republican Party and God's will have now merged to being one and the same.
[01:47:51.142 --> 01:47:53.302]  And that is a very dangerous philosophy.
[01:47:54.382 --> 01:47:56.363]  Well, that's the philosophy Adolf Hitler said.
[01:47:56.383 --> 01:47:57.783]  He loved to quote Romans 13.
[01:47:58.163 --> 01:47:59.263]  Yes, absolutely right.
[01:47:59.664 --> 01:48:01.504]  And I think there's a definite parallel here.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:16.043]  Between what happened in Hitler's Germany, as he rose to power, and the churches of Germany gave him their unyielding support, just gave it to him without reservation, and we're doing the same thing in this country today.
[01:48:16.103 --> 01:48:19.183]  And it really is, I think, a scary situation for us.
[01:48:20.763 --> 01:48:25.024]  Well, a lot of conservatives, finally, Chuck, though, are waking up on the immigration issue.
[01:48:25.044 --> 01:48:28.985]  When Bush calls the Minutemen evil vigilantes,
[01:48:29.972 --> 01:48:32.814]  When all they're doing is reporting the illegals pouring across.
[01:48:32.934 --> 01:48:35.476]  That did finally wake a lot of concern in the South.
[01:48:35.576 --> 01:48:36.537]  Well I'm glad to hear that.
[01:48:36.557 --> 01:48:44.162]  Of course you're closer to that than I am being Texas and I'm sure that you would hear that first before anybody else would being on the border state.
[01:48:44.682 --> 01:48:52.787]  You know it's interesting here in Florida we have the same problems that you do there but most of the people don't want to address those problems.
[01:48:53.248 --> 01:48:54.889]  It's still one of those hands-off
[01:48:55.501 --> 01:48:56.161]  Situations.
[01:48:56.362 --> 01:48:58.083]  Again, because Bush is promoting it.
[01:48:58.363 --> 01:49:05.767]  If Clinton were promoting it, or Gore, or any Democrat, Bob Kerr, if they were promoting it, or John Kerry, if they were promoting it, they would be against it.
[01:49:05.787 --> 01:49:08.169]  But because Bush is promoting it, they just don't say anything.
[01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:11.951]  Meanwhile, they're vacationing with Bill Clinton.
[01:49:13.252 --> 01:49:13.632]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:13.772 --> 01:49:17.414]  Well, again, that goes back to the fact that they've been friends for years.
[01:49:17.674 --> 01:49:18.635]  But my concern is
[01:49:19.855 --> 01:49:24.979]  Is that as pastors, we should be willing to face the truth regardless of the consequences.
[01:49:25.039 --> 01:49:26.880]  Regardless of who likes it, who doesn't.
[01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:29.342]  Which party it favors or which party doesn't.
[01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:31.504]  You know, we should not be about politics.
[01:49:32.004 --> 01:49:33.986]  We should not be about partisanship.
[01:49:34.286 --> 01:49:36.908]  We should be about speaking the truth, plain and simple.
[01:49:37.749 --> 01:49:38.930]  Well, it's about the issues.
[01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:39.991]  It isn't about labels.
[01:49:40.571 --> 01:49:40.971]  Exactly.
[01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:41.932]  It isn't about rhetoric.
[01:49:41.952 --> 01:49:42.873]  It's about actions.
[01:49:43.813 --> 01:49:44.894]  I agree.
[01:49:44.914 --> 01:49:47.076]  2.6 trillion dollar budget.
[01:49:47.717 --> 01:49:49.519]  Bill Clinton's biggest was 1.8 trillion?
[01:49:49.539 --> 01:49:50.680]  I mean, how is that conservative?
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.562]  We'll be right back with some other examples of this.
[01:49:53.783 --> 01:49:55.264]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.484 --> 01:49:58.567]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.707 --> 01:50:02.610]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.651 --> 01:50:06.934]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.235 --> 01:50:10.998]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.138 --> 01:50:12.940]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.422]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.462 --> 01:50:21.205]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.345 --> 01:50:24.386]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.566 --> 01:50:27.428]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.928 --> 01:50:34.052]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.572 --> 01:50:38.355]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.775 --> 01:50:40.136]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.476 --> 01:50:41.517]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.577 --> 01:50:43.558]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.578 --> 01:50:45.119]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:53.334 --> 01:50:58.556]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.716 --> 01:51:06.799]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.059 --> 01:51:14.101]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.281 --> 01:51:15.562]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.642 --> 01:51:21.546]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.726 --> 01:51:26.830]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:35.816]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.076 --> 01:51:39.379]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:00.411]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:03.692]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.153 --> 01:53:07.994]  Coming up, we got Carl E. Pearson in your calls.
[01:53:08.675 --> 01:53:10.656]  Saving Main Street and its retailers.
[01:53:11.356 --> 01:53:12.296]  I mean, it's Walmart.
[01:53:12.576 --> 01:53:13.537]  It's design.
[01:53:14.597 --> 01:53:17.779]  To come in and totally shut down your local infrastructure.
[01:53:17.799 --> 01:53:20.181]  That's very bad for the communities that it comes into.
[01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:22.182]  People are now starting to figure that out.
[01:53:22.202 --> 01:53:27.646]  But I want to get into this global system and describe how Walmart is an integral part.
[01:53:28.106 --> 01:53:28.847]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:53:28.887 --> 01:53:32.329]  Walmart has big American flags hanging up all over saying, Made in America.
[01:53:32.869 --> 01:53:36.111]  You really can't find anything made in America in a Walmart.
[01:53:36.672 --> 01:53:37.172]  Literally.
[01:53:37.192 --> 01:53:39.294]  I haven't been able to in years.
[01:53:39.374 --> 01:53:40.054]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:41.755]  They have American flags.
[01:53:42.316 --> 01:53:43.016]  Made in China.
[01:53:43.476 --> 01:53:44.277]  And that's what matters.
[01:53:45.006 --> 01:53:47.827]  That's kind of a good parallel with Bush.
[01:53:48.347 --> 01:53:59.431]  Totally phony, as a $3 bill, but because of the rhetoric, or the big American flag hanging, like Walmart, it must be good, Pastor Baldwin.
[01:54:00.851 --> 01:54:04.432]  Well, I think it goes back to the lesser of two evils philosophy.
[01:54:04.492 --> 01:54:07.833]  That's what I sense that drives so much of this.
[01:54:07.853 --> 01:54:12.935]  You know, so many times whenever I write these columns and point out these facts,
[01:54:14.196 --> 01:54:25.466]  And get on the air and say these things, and I'll hear people come back and say, well, you know, he's better than the Democrat, you know, he's better than John Kerry, you know, what do you want, Al Gore?
[01:54:25.586 --> 01:54:28.589]  It's always the monster syndrome, the boogeyman syndrome.
[01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:32.452]  But it's actually the fake conservative that's able to run the ball and get all this done.
[01:54:32.512 --> 01:54:35.435]  Again, if we had Al Gore, none of this would be happening!
[01:54:35.455 --> 01:54:36.256]  But that's the point.
[01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:37.817]  That's the point that I try to make.
[01:54:38.698 --> 01:54:40.059]  We were actually better off
[01:54:40.943 --> 01:54:58.969]  When Bill Clinton was in office, and I hate to say this because I had such a revulsion towards his administration, but with the Republicans in control of Congress and with Bill Clinton in the White House, we were actually better off because we had gridlock.
[01:54:59.853 --> 01:55:01.093]  And gridlock is not bad.
[01:55:01.253 --> 01:55:03.094]  In Washington, D.C., gridlock is great.
[01:55:03.214 --> 01:55:06.575]  We need more gridlock in Washington, D.C.
[01:55:06.815 --> 01:55:15.957]  Your latest column is about Frist going to the church and trying to get them to lobby to stop filibustering, which the Founding Fathers put in their two-block dictatorship.
[01:55:15.977 --> 01:55:16.197]  Right.
[01:55:16.718 --> 01:55:22.919]  It's unbelievable that they would be trying to change those rules in the Senate, because they're the only deliberative body in Washington, D.C.
[01:55:22.959 --> 01:55:25.400]  that has the power to filibuster, and I certainly do not.
[01:55:25.939 --> 01:55:26.179]  Sure.
[01:55:36.431 --> 01:55:41.513]  It is going to bespeak many, many... You don't remove another check and balance?
[01:55:41.633 --> 01:55:45.074]  Oh no, and that's exactly what it's designed to be.
[01:55:45.234 --> 01:56:01.660]  It's designed to create gridlock, because our founding fathers recognized that the government had the propensity to take our liberties, that the stronger it got, that the easier it was... You set up, I mean, the Federalist Papers said, in case somebody's trying to have a dictator, if we've got one good senator, they can stand up and expose it.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.660]  Exactly right.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.041]  And you know, the old
[01:56:05.347 --> 01:56:08.948]  You know, the old black and white movie, Jimmy Stewart and Mr. Smith goes to Washington.
[01:56:08.968 --> 01:56:15.030]  I mean, that's such a classic example of what one man with conviction can do in the U.S.
[01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:15.350]  Senate.
[01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:20.231]  But we take that away, and this is going to open the floodgates for all kinds of bad stuff.
[01:56:20.812 --> 01:56:28.374]  And again, it's hard to believe, but the so-called conservatives who are supposed to believe in the Constitution, they're the ones that are pushing for it.
[01:56:28.494 --> 01:56:29.034]  It's unreal.
[01:56:29.294 --> 01:56:31.535]  ChuckBowmanLive.com, last question.
[01:56:31.595 --> 01:56:32.675]  What about deception?
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:40.304]  I mean, Bush one day is praying at a Shinto shrine, the next day at a mosque to Allah, and then on his real vacation time he's worshipping Moloch.
[01:56:40.624 --> 01:56:41.704]  He's not really a Christian.
[01:56:41.724 --> 01:56:46.807]  And then secondarily, in closing, he lied about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:56:47.087 --> 01:56:52.610]  He lies worse than Bill Clinton, but why is the occultism and the lies good when it's Bush?
[01:56:53.447 --> 01:56:53.647]  Yeah.
[01:56:54.387 --> 01:57:00.868]  If I had the answer to that, you know, we could, I think, have a big impact to change the direction of the country.
[01:57:01.008 --> 01:57:02.569]  But is lying good?
[01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:04.529]  I don't know what the answer is to that, Alex.
[01:57:05.009 --> 01:57:07.849]  You know, I've been trying to alert... Is Jesus a liar?
[01:57:07.869 --> 01:57:09.290]  Is Jesus the father of lies?
[01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:10.190]  No, of course not.
[01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.810]  Of course not.
[01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:22.272]  Again, somehow, someway, the churches and pastors and Christians and conservatives in general have been duped by Bush and
[01:57:24.512 --> 01:57:28.593]  I really don't have an answer as to how it happened, but it has happened.
[01:57:29.393 --> 01:57:36.155]  And unless we awaken from this dream world we're in, it's going to become an American nightmare.
[01:57:36.495 --> 01:57:37.516]  It already has.
[01:57:37.596 --> 01:57:38.356]  Great columns.
[01:57:38.396 --> 01:57:39.216]  I appreciate you, Chuck.
[01:57:39.236 --> 01:57:40.656]  We've got to get you back up for a full hour.
[01:57:40.696 --> 01:57:41.016]  Take care.
[01:57:41.197 --> 01:57:44.377]  Thanks a lot.
[01:57:50.059 --> 01:57:50.639]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.349 --> 01:57:52.410]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.111 --> 01:57:54.211]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.872 --> 01:57:55.713]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.453 --> 01:57:57.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.034 --> 01:58:01.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.198 --> 01:58:06.361]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.521 --> 01:58:12.405]  Alright, my friends, now into hour number three on this Live Tuesday edition.
[01:58:13.526 --> 01:58:15.208]  Thank you so much again for joining us.
[01:58:15.228 --> 01:58:19.211]  I want to talk about what Walmart does to local communities.
[01:58:21.036 --> 01:58:23.217]  And places like Target as well, not just Walmart.
[01:58:23.897 --> 01:58:28.898]  What's happened in the last few decades when they build a Walmart in your town or in your area?
[01:58:29.158 --> 01:58:31.159]  It turns entire areas into ghost towns.
[01:58:32.979 --> 01:58:38.961]  For these tiny little discounts you get, you are literally destroying your local economy.
[01:58:40.422 --> 01:58:46.523]  Very, very serious in how it ties into the slave labor in China and what's happening with consumer confidence, all of it.
[01:58:47.004 --> 01:58:48.284]  That's coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:58:49.503 --> 01:58:52.004]  Also, don't want to get into some other news about Taiwan and China.
[01:58:52.965 --> 01:58:54.645]  Police chief has taken the microchip.
[01:58:54.685 --> 01:58:56.506]  He wants his other cops to as well.
[01:58:57.426 --> 01:59:01.148]  But let's go to Tim in Ohio, then Dave, Fred, and Roger and others.
[01:59:01.188 --> 01:59:01.788]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:59:02.188 --> 01:59:02.609]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:59:03.089 --> 01:59:03.369]  Hello.
[01:59:03.389 --> 01:59:16.194]  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit and help educate the people on the, I don't know if it's a correlation or if they're fighting each other, the House Joint Resolution 192 as it equates to President Kennedy's Executive Order 11110.
[01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:22.072]  It's interesting, too, that one was passed on June 4th and the other was passed on June 5th.
[01:59:22.172 --> 01:59:23.973]  You know, 50, 30, I'm sorry, 33 and 63.
[01:59:24.313 --> 01:59:31.898]  You know, I'm familiar with Kennedy's executive order abolishing the Federal Reserve and beginning to issue Lincoln Greenbacks.
[01:59:32.878 --> 01:59:36.780]  I am, uh, the particular resolution, though, you're raising, can you refresh my memory?
[01:59:37.381 --> 01:59:39.262]  Uh, that was back in, um,
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.302]  1933, which suspended the gold standard and alloyed property.
[01:59:44.322 --> 01:59:50.065]  Yeah, right after Roosevelt was elected, confiscating the gold and martial law and the Trading with the Enemy Act.
[01:59:50.426 --> 01:59:52.647]  Yeah, and it also dealt with the alloyed land titles.
[01:59:52.687 --> 01:59:55.709]  I heard you talking about, you know, personal or private property ownership.
[01:59:55.729 --> 02:00:04.815]  I don't know how I missed, of course, that particular order of Roosevelt was taking the country into receivership at the time.
[02:00:04.835 --> 02:00:07.236]  I mean, people think we can't have tyranny in the 30s.
[02:00:08.524 --> 02:00:14.967]  They took a World War I law and basically made all the citizens terrorists, the enemies of the states, and said, you've got to turn your gold in.
[02:00:14.987 --> 02:00:18.088]  We're going to give you printed, you know, paper money.
[02:00:18.648 --> 02:00:20.028]  To be accurate, it's made out of cotton.
[02:00:20.048 --> 02:00:20.869]  It's actually cloth.
[02:00:21.269 --> 02:00:21.909]  Cloth money.
[02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:24.910]  And the people just marched up and turned their gold in.
[02:00:26.591 --> 02:00:29.112]  Which was really just basically one of the biggest thefts.
[02:00:30.307 --> 02:00:33.468]  Of the wealth of the hard-working, you know, our grandfathers and parents.
[02:00:33.548 --> 02:00:39.809]  And it was openly shipped to Europe, and then a couple months after people turned their gold in, the prices then doubled on the gold.
[02:00:40.749 --> 02:00:45.811]  If I recall correctly, I think they made like three billion dollars off of that little transaction there.
[02:00:45.891 --> 02:00:49.331]  But imagine the government says, turn your gold in, no more gold is allowed.
[02:00:49.631 --> 02:00:50.852]  And we'll give you some monopoly money.
[02:00:51.632 --> 02:00:52.712]  It's a great trade.
[02:00:52.772 --> 02:00:54.412]  Here's some paper money.
[02:00:54.592 --> 02:00:57.073]  And we're going to give ourselves gold certificates so we can turn in your gold.
[02:00:57.515 --> 02:01:04.160]  And then he set up the state police, which are really federally chartered, and all... I mean, it was just amazing.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:09.203]  I still truly believe that the Fed is the primary source of most of the problems here in this country.
[02:01:09.243 --> 02:01:11.645]  And isn't it according to their charter it can be bought and out?
[02:01:13.126 --> 02:01:13.526]  Uh, yes.
[02:01:13.886 --> 02:01:15.387]  The Federal Reserve is admittedly private.
[02:01:15.407 --> 02:01:16.768]  I mean, everybody admits that now.
[02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:19.350]  It's all about getting rid of the middle class.
[02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:20.991]  It's all about centralizing control.
[02:01:21.031 --> 02:01:21.992]  It is not free market.
[02:01:22.252 --> 02:01:22.852]  Tim, thanks.
[02:01:23.032 --> 02:01:23.292]  Dave!
[02:01:23.733 --> 02:01:25.534]  Dave, where are you calling us from?
[02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:29.712]  Uh, this is Dave from, uh, Illinois.
[02:01:29.912 --> 02:01:30.772]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[02:01:31.233 --> 02:01:32.594]  Um, I got some blimp news.
[02:01:33.174 --> 02:01:37.198]  Um, the, the Navy, they just spent, uh, $64 million.
[02:01:37.218 --> 02:01:46.165]  Well, it came out Monday in their new contracts that, uh, they're putting over $64 million into, uh, blimps with, uh, you know, surveillance stuff on it.
[02:01:47.827 --> 02:01:54.112]  And, uh, they're gonna have, uh, infrared, hyperspatial, electro-optics cameras to provide all-weather, day-night surveillance.
[02:01:56.349 --> 02:02:03.531]  Well, I mean, I just read the article about all the transponders and things going in the cars of whole towns being controlled by Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon.
[02:02:03.551 --> 02:02:07.312]  They're going to have homeland security blimps over every U.S.
[02:02:07.332 --> 02:02:07.572]  city.
[02:02:07.592 --> 02:02:10.673]  They've now been seen in Dallas, D.C., New York.
[02:02:10.713 --> 02:02:12.393]  I videotaped it.
[02:02:12.533 --> 02:02:13.453]  It's going to be everywhere.
[02:02:13.994 --> 02:02:19.615]  Yeah, so when they say, well, that's just another conspiracy theory, yeah, it's a conspiracy theory from the military.
[02:02:20.538 --> 02:02:23.280]  And, uh, another great movie is, uh, Meet John Doe.
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:25.861]  It's a Frank Capra independent movie.
[02:02:26.582 --> 02:02:31.725]  And, uh, it basically, uh, he comes out and really says that Standard Oil is, uh, basically bad.
[02:02:32.485 --> 02:02:33.566]  Uh, it's a really good movie.
[02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:34.006]  Um...
[02:02:34.648 --> 02:02:41.910]  It's basically about an oil man who has his own private military, and he tries to start a third party to take over the government.
[02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.851]  That really happened!
[02:02:43.291 --> 02:02:45.071]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.451 --> 02:02:49.813]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.993 --> 02:02:54.414]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.554 --> 02:02:58.915]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.975 --> 02:03:00.336]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.096 --> 02:03:02.056]  Panama!
[02:03:02.117 --> 02:03:06.338]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.398 --> 02:03:13.341]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.441 --> 02:03:15.522]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.802 --> 02:03:26.206]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.446 --> 02:03:27.446]  If you want to understand
[02:03:27.546 --> 02:03:27.866]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:27.926 --> 02:03:29.627]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:03:46.255 --> 02:03:50.737]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.097 --> 02:03:55.179]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.479 --> 02:03:56.019]  We listened.
[02:03:56.339 --> 02:04:01.342]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.602 --> 02:04:02.082]  We listened.
[02:04:02.462 --> 02:04:05.503]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.924 --> 02:04:06.444]  We listened.
[02:04:06.904 --> 02:04:10.986]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.366 --> 02:04:11.847]  We listened.
[02:04:12.207 --> 02:04:17.430]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.211]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:19.571 --> 02:04:26.955]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.335 --> 02:04:31.777]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[02:04:35.654 --> 02:04:36.495]  That's toll free 808-803-4438.
[02:04:36.535 --> 02:04:37.457]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.590 --> 02:04:51.092]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:51.252 --> 02:04:52.313]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:52.433 --> 02:04:53.313]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:53.433 --> 02:04:56.274]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.454 --> 02:05:01.336]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.576 --> 02:05:02.676]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:02.816 --> 02:05:05.717]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:06.097 --> 02:05:09.759]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:05:09.779 --> 02:05:09.859]  Look.
[02:05:10.319 --> 02:05:12.622]  The creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:05:12.702 --> 02:05:17.548]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:05:17.808 --> 02:05:20.932]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:05:21.052 --> 02:05:26.458]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:05:26.558 --> 02:05:27.299]  Try No-B-O.
[02:05:27.439 --> 02:05:28.421]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:05:29.582 --> 02:05:32.463]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:05:32.664 --> 02:05:35.545]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[02:05:35.725 --> 02:05:38.247]  Check out their website at no-b-o.com.
[02:05:38.347 --> 02:05:43.429]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O at no-b-o.com.
[02:05:46.631 --> 02:05:52.674]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.274 --> 02:05:56.256]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.992 --> 02:05:59.032]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:05:59.393 --> 02:06:01.834]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:13.719]  We have a guest with us today, who's written a book that I read about a year ago, Saving Main Street and its Retailers.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.721]  And this is a book that the GCN Radio Network actually carries.
[02:06:19.341 --> 02:06:22.083]  I don't sell it, though I should, but you can get it through the network.
[02:06:23.663 --> 02:06:27.485]  I know a lot of other folks carry it as well, because it really breaks down what's happening.
[02:06:28.348 --> 02:06:36.090]  But I want to try to give people the big picture of how Walmart and Target and others play in to the deindustrialization.
[02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:43.052]  But not just the deindustrialization, the shutdown of the local service economy, turning whole regions of the country into ghost towns.
[02:06:44.533 --> 02:06:45.333]  And how they do it.
[02:06:46.373 --> 02:06:48.894]  But just morally, we shouldn't buy from Walmart.
[02:06:48.914 --> 02:06:50.735]  I probably go to Walmart about once a year.
[02:06:53.316 --> 02:06:57.797]  If it's 24 hours and I've got to buy some digital videotape or something, then I might go in there.
[02:06:58.576 --> 02:07:01.977]  Or if I run out of gas, this has happened.
[02:07:01.997 --> 02:07:03.758]  There's a Walmart down there, I'll go get a gas tank.
[02:07:04.738 --> 02:07:05.779]  I don't carry one in my car.
[02:07:07.059 --> 02:07:11.581]  But it's the same with Target and all of them, where we do shop a lot and we shouldn't.
[02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:14.182]  Slave labor, folks.
[02:07:14.942 --> 02:07:20.924]  I talked about it last hour, Walmart has these giant American flags everywhere saying, Made in America, American Pride.
[02:07:22.728 --> 02:07:23.768]  And I've been in a Walmart.
[02:07:23.908 --> 02:07:27.469]  You are pressed to find anything made in America.
[02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:32.571]  You're pressed to find anything that's not made in China or India or Singapore.
[02:07:32.631 --> 02:07:34.312]  Most of it isn't even made in Mexico now.
[02:07:34.632 --> 02:07:35.872]  They're even losing their jobs.
[02:07:37.453 --> 02:07:39.693]  So why are the corporations still doing this?
[02:07:39.733 --> 02:07:41.954]  It's part of a larger plan of consolidation.
[02:07:42.794 --> 02:07:48.336]  A few global corporations moved to China, including Ford now and others, Dell Computers, you name it.
[02:07:49.255 --> 02:07:50.035]  The Mad Dash.
[02:07:50.516 --> 02:07:53.036]  They use the cheap goods to leverage out their competition.
[02:07:53.657 --> 02:07:57.858]  And it won't matter down the road when we can't buy the goods, because they'll just sell the people internally in China.
[02:07:58.719 --> 02:08:02.500]  And they'll use the money they made off of all of this to leverage out and buy up all their competition.
[02:08:03.841 --> 02:08:05.601]  It's all about sweetheart deals in China.
[02:08:05.921 --> 02:08:09.243]  You're not a good New World Order globalist if you don't get your slave factory over there.
[02:08:10.343 --> 02:08:15.045]  And of course we're competing against the millions of prisoners in America who work in these private prisons.
[02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:19.584]  And the good old boy out there listening says, good, make them criminals work.
[02:08:20.544 --> 02:08:24.147]  I'd like to remind you listening, have you ever thought about this in a more complex fashion?
[02:08:24.587 --> 02:08:27.289]  You're now competing against that person who's working for 20 cents an hour.
[02:08:28.130 --> 02:08:28.790]  It is not good.
[02:08:29.391 --> 02:08:33.454]  And it creates an incentive to put more and more people into the criminal justice system.
[02:08:33.834 --> 02:08:35.095]  We have the Fed's own documents.
[02:08:35.135 --> 02:08:37.076]  The schools are being designed to do this.
[02:08:37.557 --> 02:08:44.462]  Now you see five-year-olds being arrested and charged as felons for spatting a teacher and throwing a book off a chair.
[02:08:45.276 --> 02:08:49.198]  Joining us is Carl E. Pearson, attorney-in-law, who's written this powerful book.
[02:08:49.218 --> 02:09:04.766]  You can go to GCNlive.com, click on the bookstore shopping cart there and get it at a discount price, or we'll give you a number a little bit later where you can call and get the book.
[02:09:05.636 --> 02:09:07.138]  Good to have you on with us, Mr. Pearson.
[02:09:07.338 --> 02:09:08.239]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:09:08.299 --> 02:09:09.780]  I'm very pleased to be on your show.
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:11.101]  Well, thank you for coming on.
[02:09:12.082 --> 02:09:16.906]  Sorry, last time you were going to come on, I was actually under the weather that day, but it's good to get you on with us.
[02:09:17.366 --> 02:09:21.450]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and why you decided to write this book and what your findings are.
[02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:32.880]  Well, I'm a high school dropout and I went to college, got through in two and a half to three years, became the president of the student body, went to Harvard Law School,
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:40.763]  And then went dutifully to Wall Street, where I served my penal servitude on Wall Street and knew that that wasn't for me.
[02:09:41.643 --> 02:09:47.385]  And since 1968, I've been out on my own, basically as an antitrust and civil rights lawyer.
[02:09:48.866 --> 02:10:01.150]  So I've had more than 40 years of experience in trying to enforce the nation's antitrust laws against the largest corporations in the country, and the civil rights laws against the governments.
[02:10:01.631 --> 02:10:02.391]  And I find that
[02:10:02.992 --> 02:10:06.455]  Really, it's the same coin, but just two different sides.
[02:10:06.956 --> 02:10:15.083]  So you can be, and should be, a civil rights lawyer to handle the governmental monopoly, and an antitrust lawyer to handle the private enterprise monopoly.
[02:10:15.403 --> 02:10:16.144]  And they're merging.
[02:10:17.385 --> 02:10:17.945]  They are.
[02:10:18.806 --> 02:10:20.688]  I call it neo-mercantilism.
[02:10:21.969 --> 02:10:28.495]  It's certainly, and that's correct, and what's happening here is that we've had the largest
[02:10:29.401 --> 02:10:38.928]  Organized theft of property that has ever taken place in the world and it is approximately a thousand or ten thousand times larger than Enron.
[02:10:39.968 --> 02:10:41.109]  Just to give you a size.
[02:10:41.369 --> 02:10:43.191]  That's a rough estimate on my part.
[02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:43.731]  Very rough.
[02:10:44.577 --> 02:10:47.018]  But it's the largest theft that's ever taken place.
[02:10:47.058 --> 02:10:48.519]  You couldn't have a larger theft.
[02:10:48.559 --> 02:10:50.759]  We were the wealthiest country, and they're stealing it.
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:51.960]  They're getting away with it.
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:58.662]  4% of the world's population had over half the wealth, and now that wealth is disappearing rather rapidly.
[02:10:59.103 --> 02:11:01.403]  But they tell us, never mind the man behind the curtain.
[02:11:01.464 --> 02:11:02.304]  Everything's fine.
[02:11:02.644 --> 02:11:03.464]  Just go to sleep.
[02:11:03.544 --> 02:11:05.425]  Don't mind the police state we're setting up.
[02:11:05.865 --> 02:11:09.847]  Because the IMF's own documents say they know we're going to riot when we finally learn what's happened.
[02:11:10.027 --> 02:11:13.048]  But go over what Walmart is and why you focus on Walmart.
[02:11:13.248 --> 02:11:16.971]  Well, first of all, the wealth is not disappearing.
[02:11:17.031 --> 02:11:20.053]  It's just going into other people's hands.
[02:11:20.233 --> 02:11:20.993]  And that's the problem.
[02:11:21.053 --> 02:11:22.454]  It's going into Walmart's hands.
[02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:24.316]  And it's not free market?
[02:11:24.956 --> 02:11:25.657]  No, it's not.
[02:11:26.217 --> 02:11:29.459]  The free market... Well, what happens is this.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:36.204]  When Walmart goes into a town, they convince the town often to pay for the construction of the building.
[02:11:36.844 --> 02:11:42.408]  And to give Walmart all the sales tax that could be paid to the town for a long period of time.
[02:11:43.061 --> 02:11:46.362]  So that we have the community financing its own destruction.
[02:11:46.642 --> 02:11:51.764]  And the community knows it's not a good deal, but big contributions get given to the mayor.
[02:11:52.464 --> 02:11:56.186]  Well, here's what happens when any major retailer goes in.
[02:11:56.266 --> 02:11:59.567]  They see a town line, and they go to one side of the town line.
[02:12:00.074 --> 02:12:03.835]  And say, if you put up our store, we're going to give you all the sales tax revenues.
[02:12:04.295 --> 02:12:05.996]  But we insist that you do the following.
[02:12:06.236 --> 02:12:10.657]  We want new streets, we want this and we want that, and buy and put up money.
[02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:12.617]  Give us the sales tax for a while.
[02:12:13.177 --> 02:12:15.618]  And then the town may say, well, to hell with you!
[02:12:15.738 --> 02:12:18.359]  I mean, you're going to throw your costs on us and everything else.
[02:12:19.019 --> 02:12:23.480]  Then Walmart and the other major retailers say, well, then we'll go to the other side of the line.
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:26.441]  We'll go one foot over the other side of the line and you get nothing.
[02:12:28.132 --> 02:12:30.914]  So you see the kind of competition they create for towns?
[02:12:30.935 --> 02:12:32.576]  The towns don't know what to do.
[02:12:33.096 --> 02:12:35.659]  If they don't get Walmart, they lose all that business.
[02:12:35.719 --> 02:12:39.502]  And if they do get Walmart, they commit suicide more slowly.
[02:12:39.602 --> 02:12:43.425]  Now when I say it's not free market, this is a racket like the mafia would run.
[02:12:43.445 --> 02:12:45.187]  A classical racket.
[02:12:47.249 --> 02:12:50.091]  Here's the legal basis that has to be attacked.
[02:12:50.151 --> 02:12:52.273]  And it's not the labor rate.
[02:12:53.054 --> 02:12:55.736]  The unions are wrong when they think that it's the labor rate.
[02:12:56.929 --> 02:13:04.755]  Walmart and the other major retailers are forcing, inducing the nation's manufacturers to sell below cost to them.
[02:13:06.356 --> 02:13:10.719]  They don't sell below cost to the competitor across the street, the locally owned business.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.662]  That guy has to pay twice as much for his goods.
[02:13:14.182 --> 02:13:24.410]  And I would add just at the lower level, at the very same time, Walmart's been caught forcing its employees to work extra hours as slaves.
[02:13:25.598 --> 02:13:32.264]  Unpaid, that's true and without the kind of benefits they need to be able to enjoy a minimum life.
[02:13:45.743 --> 02:13:51.145]  I remember he said, go clock out, but then move in these three pallets of batteries, which would take about an hour and a half.
[02:13:52.046 --> 02:13:52.786]  And I was like, no!
[02:13:52.826 --> 02:13:54.667]  And he got mad at me, and I basically quit over it.
[02:13:54.987 --> 02:13:56.488]  I mean, they wanted me to be their slave!
[02:13:57.448 --> 02:14:01.330]  Well, they have the power when they're the only employer around.
[02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:02.570]  What do people do?
[02:14:03.090 --> 02:14:07.732]  Because what happens is this, that the major retailer gets low prices.
[02:14:08.172 --> 02:14:10.994]  They demand and get much lower prices than anyone else.
[02:14:11.054 --> 02:14:13.955]  And it's illegal under the Robinson-Patman Act from the very beginning.
[02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:22.781]  Then they open up stores surrounding the legitimate businesses and they drive the small legitimate business that pays taxes out of business.
[02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:25.763]  And once there's no competition, they're free.
[02:14:25.823 --> 02:14:28.466]  The major retailer is free to increase its prices.
[02:14:28.766 --> 02:14:29.667]  Now that's a good point!
[02:14:30.416 --> 02:14:31.156]  That's a good point.
[02:14:31.236 --> 02:14:51.286]  They not only get them to build the roads and give them the land for free in many cases and let them be tax-free for 10 years on sales tax and local property tax, but they also then make the people that are selling them the goods sell it to them at incredibly low prices because of their bulk purchasing and other things.
[02:14:51.646 --> 02:14:54.507]  And they even own 700 factories, correct, in China?
[02:14:54.827 --> 02:14:58.609]  Right, but the people that sell below cost to Walmart
[02:14:59.808 --> 02:15:02.590]  And the other major retailers are in a bind themselves.
[02:15:02.630 --> 02:15:03.651]  They don't know what to do.
[02:15:04.351 --> 02:15:07.554]  They're selling below cost and it's ruining their own business.
[02:15:07.874 --> 02:15:08.995]  It's driving them under.
[02:15:09.615 --> 02:15:13.458]  And they don't know what to do because if they stop selling below cost, someone else will.
[02:15:14.319 --> 02:15:15.760]  They don't want to lose the market share.
[02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:19.723]  They really deem that they're renting market share until the thing blows over.
[02:15:19.923 --> 02:15:25.968]  So instead they stop testing the stuff and that's why cell phones and cordless phones and everything we buy now breaks.
[02:15:27.153 --> 02:15:29.696]  Well, because they're going for the lowest price.
[02:15:29.816 --> 02:15:32.839]  It's a race to the bottom and that quality is affected.
[02:15:33.219 --> 02:15:42.208]  Take the customer service lines, the quality of how it's deteriorated over the years where you can no longer speak to a human being.
[02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:48.315]  You spend an hour or two waiting and finally you get somebody, you're dropped off the line, the person you get doesn't know.
[02:15:49.075 --> 02:15:51.096]  Those are costs imposed on you and me.
[02:15:51.136 --> 02:15:54.518]  You and I, and others listening, have a value to our time.
[02:15:55.058 --> 02:16:03.443]  So the people we buy from force us into wasting our time instead of having them staff the phone properly.
[02:16:03.983 --> 02:16:08.885]  They make us spend our time and money wasting it, and they have a cheaper price as a result.
[02:16:09.326 --> 02:16:13.808]  But the Attorney General concept, as I view it, can attack that, and should.
[02:16:15.425 --> 02:16:23.998]  The person as an Attorney General for a small town should really start looking at the things that are hurting the town and address it in court.
[02:16:24.079 --> 02:16:28.185]  Go into court and collect money for the wrongdoing.
[02:16:28.624 --> 02:16:32.087]  And then use that money to give the town free health care.
[02:16:32.247 --> 02:16:34.089]  Well, you've got a law degree from Harvard.
[02:16:34.109 --> 02:16:38.252]  I mean, isn't this really the classical definition of racketeering that Walmart does?
[02:16:38.472 --> 02:16:45.698]  Well, I'll tell you this, that I have been in the courts for a long period of time, longer than 99.9% of the country.
[02:16:46.619 --> 02:16:50.522]  And the courts will not generally allow you to allege that.
[02:16:51.183 --> 02:16:55.266]  They will protect people from accusations of racketeering.
[02:16:55.406 --> 02:16:55.807]  It's been
[02:16:57.024 --> 02:17:01.266]  Something that the major corporations don't like to be called racketeers.
[02:17:01.426 --> 02:17:03.907]  The politicians don't like to be called racketeers.
[02:17:04.407 --> 02:17:18.073]  A lot of people don't like to be called that, so rather than trying to go in and say that this is racketeering, because even if it is, and there's a great argument for it, the courts won't allow you to accuse them of racketeering.
[02:17:18.533 --> 02:17:24.655]  So you have to go in where it's politically acceptable, and the violation of the anti-cust laws is doable.
[02:17:24.915 --> 02:17:25.656]  You can go in and
[02:17:26.756 --> 02:17:29.897]  Correct the condition by enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.
[02:17:30.297 --> 02:17:40.781]  For those who don't know what racketeering is, it's getting with a bunch of different officials and different people in the chain and in a concerted effort manipulating an environment to carry out your operations.
[02:17:40.921 --> 02:17:41.301]  Right.
[02:17:41.481 --> 02:17:43.942]  It's organized use of... Stay there.
[02:17:43.962 --> 02:17:44.422]  We got a break.
[02:17:44.442 --> 02:17:44.862]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:45.896 --> 02:17:47.017]  Why do you wear watches?
[02:17:47.318 --> 02:17:49.900]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[02:17:50.361 --> 02:17:57.928]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[02:17:58.308 --> 02:18:02.052]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.

[02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:36.527]  Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[02:19:36.547 --> 02:19:37.708]  The real money folks.
[02:19:54.002 --> 02:19:55.922]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:19:56.402 --> 02:19:57.403]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:57.463 --> 02:19:58.863]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[02:19:58.903 --> 02:19:59.323]  A 5% increase.
[02:19:59.923 --> 02:20:02.984]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[02:20:03.524 --> 02:20:06.044]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:07.525]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:08.565]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.521]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:20:25.082 --> 02:20:32.064]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[02:20:47.722 --> 02:20:53.207]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:53.647 --> 02:20:57.870]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:58.111 --> 02:21:05.156]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:05.517 --> 02:21:11.642]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:11.782 --> 02:21:12.983]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:13.323 --> 02:21:16.267]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:16.428 --> 02:21:18.430]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:18.751 --> 02:21:26.001]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:21:26.301 --> 02:21:29.686]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:21:33.368 --> 02:21:33.548]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:33.568 --> 02:21:34.568]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:34.588 --> 02:21:34.808]  Call today.
[02:21:34.868 --> 02:21:36.069]  Grab a pen and paper!
[02:21:53.445 --> 02:21:55.328]  Saving Main Street and its retailers.
[02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:58.272]  Again, the network is carrying this book.
[02:21:58.292 --> 02:22:04.199]  That's how much they believe in it, and I've interviewed Mr. Pearson before, but I'm having him back up again.
[02:22:04.219 --> 02:22:05.261]  I hope you'll get a copy.
[02:22:05.982 --> 02:22:10.468]  There's 30 chapters, but it's full of an appendix that's
[02:22:11.391 --> 02:22:14.072]  Got a lot of key websites where you can find out more information.
[02:22:14.633 --> 02:22:18.815]  I mean, here's Chapter 1, How to Stop Destruction of Your Town or Village and its Small Businesses.
[02:22:19.375 --> 02:22:27.379]  Chapter 22, How a Community Plan Can Recreate Itself, Revitalize Main Street, and Restore Local Retail Businesses to Profitability.
[02:22:28.619 --> 02:22:30.760]  Here's Number 27, I'm just randomly picking chapters.
[02:22:31.501 --> 02:22:33.662]  Part 2 in the plan, How to Make Your Community
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:39.262]  Unattractive to major retailers, which would threaten your town and its employment and business opportunities.
[02:22:39.683 --> 02:22:49.148]  I mean, you go into these little towns that are great tourist areas, that are beautiful, that invest locally, that have all these local businesses with arts and crafts and restaurants and hotels.
[02:22:49.688 --> 02:22:50.609]  That's where you want to go.
[02:22:50.649 --> 02:22:55.491]  You don't want to go to a little pitted out town with a Walmart with all the towns around it dead.
[02:22:55.531 --> 02:22:56.572]  These are like cancers.
[02:22:57.415 --> 02:23:00.917]  No, but you want the cell phones, or you want the cordless phones that break in a week.
[02:23:00.957 --> 02:23:05.119]  You want the junk garbage, the duffel bag that breaks the first time you use it.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.940]  I mean, it's a sick joke!
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:09.702]  It's destroying quality!
[02:23:11.963 --> 02:23:12.844]  Folks, please call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:12.864 --> 02:23:12.904]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:12.944 --> 02:23:15.105]  Or go to GCNlive.com and it's there on the shopping cart.
[02:23:15.125 --> 02:23:16.946]  You can get a copy right there.
[02:23:16.966 --> 02:23:18.687]  It's an excellent book.
[02:23:18.707 --> 02:23:19.367]  I recommend it.
[02:23:19.387 --> 02:23:19.427]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:27.077 --> 02:23:30.761]  Or you can go to Mr. Pearson's website, lawmall.com.
[02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:32.163]  We'll plug that again later.
[02:23:32.763 --> 02:23:42.493]  Mr. Pearson, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, and I want to get more into this and take calls, but we were talking about racketeering and you were giving us the actual scholarly definition.
[02:23:43.474 --> 02:23:47.499]  The scholarly definition is that they're using
[02:23:49.586 --> 02:23:55.071]  You have to have a conspiracy to violate certain types of laws.
[02:23:55.611 --> 02:23:59.675]  And basically you find that, but the courts don't like to enforce it.
[02:23:59.955 --> 02:24:06.361]  They are tougher on racketeering charges than they are on antitrust.
[02:24:07.001 --> 02:24:11.145]  So the easier way is to show that they're violating the antitrust laws.
[02:24:11.796 --> 02:24:13.878]  And explain what those laws do.
[02:24:13.918 --> 02:24:32.412]  The one law that the courts are always enforcing is the Robinson-Patman Act that prohibits a manufacturer from selling to a major retailer at lower per unit prices than they're selling to the competitor, except to the extent that the difference in price is cost justified by the size of the order.
[02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:37.587]  Walmart sell a DVD player for $25.
[02:24:38.127 --> 02:24:42.309]  They buy it at a much lower price, and it's really bought below cost.
[02:24:42.450 --> 02:24:44.811]  I mean, even other big chains are selling them for $40.
[02:24:45.671 --> 02:24:50.954]  They buy goods below cost by demanding that the manufacturers sell below cost.
[02:24:51.135 --> 02:24:52.355]  You know, Walmart does other things.
[02:24:52.375 --> 02:24:53.456]  You talk about trust.
[02:24:53.976 --> 02:25:02.101]  They joined with the Pentagon last year to demand that all retailers put RFID in all of their products, radio frequency tracking,
[02:25:02.761 --> 02:25:06.963]  Forcing a shift from the barcode, which they helped push in 86, to RFID.
[02:25:07.463 --> 02:25:09.824]  I mean, you talk about merger with the government.
[02:25:09.864 --> 02:25:11.564]  This is scary.
[02:25:12.044 --> 02:25:15.266]  I've sued Walmart for the RFID.
[02:25:17.026 --> 02:25:18.867]  The radio frequency identification chip.
[02:25:18.947 --> 02:25:20.187]  I've sued them because of that.
[02:25:20.267 --> 02:25:20.747]  I didn't know that.
[02:25:20.788 --> 02:25:21.368]  I'm impressed.
[02:25:21.388 --> 02:25:21.748]  Tell us about it.
[02:25:21.768 --> 02:25:28.210]  And the reason I've done that is that the kind of money that the manufacturer is giving to Walmart at Walmart's insistence
[02:25:31.112 --> 02:25:31.472]  I think so.
[02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:43.850]  And they don't need the development.
[02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:52.094]  They're forcing the companies that supply them to put in an infrastructure that they will have first for at least five years before anybody else.
[02:25:52.114 --> 02:25:52.414]  Right.
[02:25:52.434 --> 02:25:54.575]  That only benefits Walmart in its size.
[02:25:54.615 --> 02:25:56.897]  There's no other person of a comparable size.
[02:25:56.917 --> 02:26:00.018]  Even Home Depot is only one-fourth the size of Walmart.
[02:26:00.619 --> 02:26:02.039]  And it's already bigger than General Motors.
[02:26:02.139 --> 02:26:02.560]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.282]  I mean, Walmart is taking over gradually everything in the country, and it's not right.
[02:26:07.642 --> 02:26:10.844]  They're doing it on their own time schedule, but they can take anything they want.
[02:26:11.542 --> 02:26:13.204]  Because they have the power to do that.
[02:26:14.005 --> 02:26:16.428]  So where'd your lawsuit go suing over RFID?
[02:26:16.488 --> 02:26:28.423]  Well, I just gave them 90 days notice that they have to answer my complaint within 90 days and then they will probably move to dismiss it and the court will have to decide whether there is a valid claim.
[02:26:29.133 --> 02:26:32.915]  What about this command center up in Arkansas?
[02:26:32.935 --> 02:26:33.815]  That's been in the news.
[02:26:33.895 --> 02:26:34.696]  Bentonville?
[02:26:35.036 --> 02:26:38.878]  Yeah, with FBI agents guarding it and weird command centers.
[02:26:39.398 --> 02:26:41.820]  I think Walmart's basically a government front.
[02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:45.582]  Well, they certainly have all the wealth.
[02:26:45.702 --> 02:26:47.943]  I mean, most of the wealth is tied up.
[02:26:48.423 --> 02:26:50.264]  There's so much wealth tied up in Walmart.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:27:01.128]  And the power to take the rest of it away, that you can constructively give them all the wealth of the nation, because they have the power to take it, and they're exercising that power gradually.
[02:27:01.188 --> 02:27:05.391]  It's not happening every day, where you see... They're engaging in social engineering!
[02:27:05.732 --> 02:27:06.392]  Yeah.
[02:27:06.512 --> 02:27:10.095]  And the only way of attacking it is to do it, as I'm saying, I think.
[02:27:10.115 --> 02:27:13.638]  Because politically, you can't go to your congressman and complain.
[02:27:13.678 --> 02:27:16.180]  They use money from big companies to get re-elected.
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:17.801]  Well, let's talk about how to stop them.
[02:27:18.516 --> 02:27:21.137]  At the local level when we get back, and then take some calls.
[02:27:21.197 --> 02:27:21.597]  Okay, sir?
[02:27:22.478 --> 02:27:29.400]  Again, folks, you gotta get this book, Saving Main Street and its retailers, GCNlive.com, at the mall there, or by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:27:31.121 --> 02:27:33.302]  My website's prisonplanet.tv.
[02:27:36.163 --> 02:27:37.064]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.564 --> 02:27:39.164]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.085 --> 02:27:42.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.609 --> 02:27:51.713]  Do you have $10, $20, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[02:27:51.853 --> 02:27:56.776]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way!
[02:27:56.977 --> 02:28:06.703]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201 will negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.

[02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:51.728]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.408 --> 02:30:54.770]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.972 --> 02:31:06.359]  Slave Mart or Death Mart, Newel Order Mart, is one of the prime movers in the control grid infrastructure.
[02:31:06.989 --> 02:31:15.176]  They have the drills where the police have the town practice turning themselves into the FEMA Center and getting their medicines and for martial law drills.
[02:31:15.356 --> 02:31:16.137]  Folks, I've been to them.
[02:31:16.878 --> 02:31:22.903]  They're involved in the RFID, forcing all of their suppliers to put it in with the Pentagon.
[02:31:23.984 --> 02:31:33.472]  They're involved, I mean, just any stone you turn over, any septic tank you open, it's Walmart looking back at you.
[02:31:35.211 --> 02:31:36.851]  And there's so much more.
[02:31:36.891 --> 02:31:39.692]  You won't believe the stuff they turn up being involved in.
[02:31:39.712 --> 02:31:42.153]  They're the biggest corporation in the world.
[02:31:43.373 --> 02:31:50.514]  And they've got the deals where they even own hundreds and hundreds of their own facilities.
[02:31:50.554 --> 02:31:52.375]  And they buy directly from other facilities.
[02:31:52.975 --> 02:31:56.756]  And they come in and take over your town and pay off your politicians and lobby.
[02:31:57.296 --> 02:32:01.577]  The good news is around the country people are starting to stand up and fight them and towns are throwing them out.
[02:32:02.623 --> 02:32:05.465]  Stopping them before they even build their atrocities.
[02:32:06.106 --> 02:32:07.367]  I don't go to Walmart anymore.
[02:32:08.047 --> 02:32:08.848]  You shouldn't either.
[02:32:09.669 --> 02:32:11.390]  You don't need all this junk to begin with.
[02:32:11.410 --> 02:32:13.391]  This consumer society is an addiction.
[02:32:14.432 --> 02:32:15.833]  And all this garbage.
[02:32:17.074 --> 02:32:19.076]  And look at all the junk in your house.
[02:32:19.136 --> 02:32:21.458]  You just don't need to go buy stuff.
[02:32:25.194 --> 02:32:30.058]  Look at our economic numbers, the consumer confidence, the public, private debt, corporate debt.
[02:32:30.858 --> 02:32:35.582]  Look at the trade deficit, sixty-something, sixty-eight billion a month now with China.
[02:32:35.622 --> 02:32:38.064]  I mean, just China alone, it's getting insane!
[02:32:39.145 --> 02:32:44.108]  And the Republicans and Democrats tell us, just go further down the road, get deeper into it.
[02:32:44.148 --> 02:32:45.089]  Oh, this is great!
[02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:47.531]  We've got to go all the way with globalization!
[02:32:48.431 --> 02:32:51.614]  It's about putting all the wealth in tiny elites' hands,
[02:32:52.461 --> 02:32:56.844]  And they do it with Walmart to leverage out their competition.
[02:32:58.625 --> 02:33:04.228]  Number one, Attorney at Law, Burleigh Pearson, antitrust expert.
[02:33:06.089 --> 02:33:08.450]  The book, Saving Main Street and its Retailers.
[02:33:10.691 --> 02:33:14.914]  Number one, the little 70 second diatribe I just did, comments on that.
[02:33:14.934 --> 02:33:18.116]  Number two, how do local towns fight this monster?
[02:33:18.156 --> 02:33:19.316]  What are some of the different tactics?
[02:33:21.016 --> 02:33:30.023]  You have to realize, and I don't think anyone knows this, but classically, Walmart is operating at about a $60 billion loss per year.
[02:33:31.444 --> 02:33:32.465]  But it's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:33:32.525 --> 02:33:33.245]  I keep expanding.
[02:33:33.446 --> 02:33:40.491]  The reason is that they recognize as income items that are illegal under law that they shouldn't be getting.
[02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:51.185]  They're getting excessive discounts from manufacturers that they shouldn't be getting, and they're including that when they compute their financial operations, but they shouldn't do that.
[02:33:51.325 --> 02:33:53.208]  And they're getting tax exemption and all that?
[02:33:53.448 --> 02:33:57.254]  Yes, but if they had to reserve the money they get illegally,
[02:33:57.754 --> 02:34:01.416]  Then they would be operating at about a $50 billion a year loss.
[02:34:01.436 --> 02:34:05.438]  But they don't care because they're creating a monopoly running their competition out of business.
[02:34:05.719 --> 02:34:09.861]  Well, the government officials are not calling them on what they're doing.
[02:34:09.901 --> 02:34:11.522]  There isn't any enforcement of law.
[02:34:11.562 --> 02:34:15.164]  So I'm saying let the town attorney general of a small town
[02:34:15.914 --> 02:34:22.797]  Start attacking the illegalities that are out there and collecting money for the town.
[02:34:23.238 --> 02:34:25.419]  By attorney general you mean the district attorney?
[02:34:25.539 --> 02:34:29.941]  No, I would have a new person, a civil prosecutor appointed, who I would call.
[02:34:29.961 --> 02:34:31.222]  Oh, you would create that office?
[02:34:31.242 --> 02:34:32.622]  Yes, a town attorney general.
[02:34:32.642 --> 02:34:34.503]  See, towns are used to defending suits.
[02:34:34.523 --> 02:34:35.864]  They're not really used to suing.
[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:38.741]  Except for criminal prosecutions.
[02:34:38.801 --> 02:34:42.602]  But what they need are civil prosecutions against the invisible corporation.
[02:34:42.902 --> 02:34:46.523]  And that would be extremely popular with the city members.
[02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:51.565]  Oh sure, they get all that money which they can distribute like a reverse tax every year.
[02:34:52.086 --> 02:34:58.848]  I can see five or ten thousand a year per family for a small town coming back to them as a result of litigation.
[02:34:59.986 --> 02:35:00.786]  That's a lot of money.
[02:35:00.846 --> 02:35:03.327]  Now, there are other tactics to keep Walmart out though.
[02:35:03.467 --> 02:35:06.688]  I mean, there's a big movement, as you obviously know, being the grand poobah of this.
[02:35:08.008 --> 02:35:09.749]  We've kept Walmarts out of areas of Austin.
[02:35:10.109 --> 02:35:17.491]  Well, the zoning keeps them out, but they open up across the way in another county or town, and that drains off businesses.
[02:35:17.631 --> 02:35:22.952]  It's somewhat short-sighted to allow them to come in somewhere near you.
[02:35:23.472 --> 02:35:27.033]  The antitrust laws would allow you to stop them 50 miles around.
[02:35:29.831 --> 02:35:31.452]  How is Target able to compete with them?
[02:35:31.792 --> 02:35:34.553]  Well, their competition is not as strong.
[02:35:34.633 --> 02:35:40.555]  Like Kmart, for example, can't compete with them, and Target will have its own difficulties.
[02:35:40.815 --> 02:35:46.856]  But I heard Walmart's having to shift into a little bit more quality goods, just because Target has a little bit more quality.
[02:35:47.037 --> 02:35:48.497]  Well, with Kmart,
[02:35:49.217 --> 02:35:55.539]  For example, Kmart has Land's End through Sears and it has Martha Stewart through Kmart.
[02:35:55.899 --> 02:36:03.321]  Those are both exclusive to Sears and Kmart so they can charge a higher price and have a higher markup.
[02:36:03.661 --> 02:36:17.104]  So anyone that uses that approach of selling something that Walmart doesn't have, I tell people the best way to compete with Walmart is to open up across the street and sell camels and lions and elephants and that's the best way.
[02:36:17.944 --> 02:36:20.604]  In other words, don't sell what Wal-Mart is selling.
[02:36:20.644 --> 02:36:21.465]  Sell something else.
[02:36:22.245 --> 02:36:28.026]  Well, that's why I said the arts and crafts and, you know, glassblowing or chocolate factories.
[02:36:28.306 --> 02:36:38.168]  I mean, you know, because people go after perceived value, and these are the type of things we need to invest in going after that value-added individualistic product.
[02:36:38.268 --> 02:36:45.489]  Right, but we have to ensure that people can compete against Wal-Mart by being able to buy at the same price with
[02:36:46.582 --> 02:36:48.623]  A fair differential for volume.
[02:36:49.263 --> 02:36:56.326]  And the illegality now that needs to be enforced in law is that Walmart is buying even below cost.
[02:36:56.766 --> 02:36:58.467]  There's no legality involved.
[02:36:58.487 --> 02:37:00.188]  How do they get their manufacturers to do that?
[02:37:00.228 --> 02:37:06.991]  Because the manufacturers use that to build up the factory and build even more and then overcharge other people?
[02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:14.374]  Well, they overcharge my clients and they undercharge the major retailer because the major retailer tells them, frankly, if you don't
[02:37:15.206 --> 02:37:15.646]  No, I don't.
[02:37:31.173 --> 02:37:32.374]  Manufacturers are hurting.
[02:37:32.834 --> 02:37:39.156]  And that forces everything even out of cheap labor pools like Mexico to China, as you said, race to the bottom.
[02:37:39.796 --> 02:37:47.539]  It's a race to the bottom where everyone is now forced to look to China for their labor because the major retailers are
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:49.261]  Requiring that.
[02:37:49.681 --> 02:37:52.763]  They're saying the China price, you have to meet the China price.
[02:37:52.783 --> 02:37:55.105]  The only way to meet a nickel an hour is to go to China.
[02:37:55.646 --> 02:38:01.850]  So we're losing jobs in America, and as you've said, you've got to have jobs in America to buy these products.
[02:38:01.890 --> 02:38:05.053]  No matter what the price of the product, if you don't have jobs, what good is it?
[02:38:05.113 --> 02:38:09.396]  Well, the media keeps telling us how great this globalization is, but people know it's not good.
[02:38:09.436 --> 02:38:10.377]  It's not good for anybody.
[02:38:10.697 --> 02:38:17.042]  The major media is bought off, and a lot of us know that, and they have to parrot the party line.
[02:38:17.563 --> 02:38:24.245]  And thank God for your show and others like you, because you're telling people something that they instinctively know, but no one articulates.
[02:38:24.385 --> 02:38:26.226]  And you're doing it, and that's great for the country.
[02:38:26.246 --> 02:38:27.966]  Well, you're doing it, Carl Pearson.
[02:38:28.006 --> 02:38:29.147]  I mean, I salute you.
[02:38:29.207 --> 02:38:29.827]  I commend you.
[02:38:29.907 --> 02:38:31.888]  But, I mean, what do you see?
[02:38:31.908 --> 02:38:33.568]  Give us your long-term prognosis.
[02:38:33.588 --> 02:38:35.329]  What do you see happening at Walmart?
[02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:37.309]  Because I do see resistance building to it.
[02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:41.892]  As an oppressed group is to go into court.
[02:38:42.012 --> 02:38:51.198]  That's the nature of the constitutional system in America, is that those who are being cheated, that are by the majority, those in power, have to go into court.
[02:38:51.318 --> 02:38:53.780]  But the higher courts are bought and paid for, too.
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.481]  You still have an opportunity.
[02:38:55.641 --> 02:39:02.886]  For example, if 500 different towns brought suit against a manufacturer that sells to Walmart below cost,
[02:39:03.346 --> 02:39:07.067]  That manufacturer will stop selling to Walmart or go out of business.
[02:39:07.087 --> 02:39:07.747]  No, I got you.
[02:39:07.767 --> 02:39:11.909]  You've got the illegitimate lawsuits against gun manufacturers, but still that's hurting them.
[02:39:12.249 --> 02:39:15.970]  This would be legitimate and have real findings and real teeth.
[02:39:16.270 --> 02:39:18.651]  Oh, it'll be impact of an antitrust suit.
[02:39:18.711 --> 02:39:20.692]  Just one antitrust suit is devastating.
[02:39:21.432 --> 02:39:29.274]  500 or even 10 antitrust suits against a manufacturer that no longer has any income because they're selling to the major retailers will break them.
[02:39:29.634 --> 02:39:31.595]  How many antitrust suits have been filed against them?
[02:39:32.461 --> 02:39:34.343]  Well, you could file as many as you want.
[02:39:34.403 --> 02:39:35.544]  Every town should file one.
[02:39:35.564 --> 02:39:36.945]  But I mean, how many are out there right now?
[02:39:37.846 --> 02:39:38.427]  Only a few.
[02:39:38.447 --> 02:39:43.832]  I basically know of my own lawsuits, but I don't know of anyone else doing this.
[02:39:44.432 --> 02:39:56.924]  And this is where you need to be, is to have towns protect themselves by the appointment of a little Elliot Spitzer, a town attorney general who will look to recover money for the town, money that was stolen from the town.
[02:39:57.444 --> 02:39:58.585]  And then pay it back.
[02:39:58.625 --> 02:39:59.686]  Give them a check every month.
[02:39:59.726 --> 02:40:01.128]  How do the citizens put up with this?
[02:40:01.188 --> 02:40:03.430]  Yes, we'll pay for you to move here, Wal-Mart.
[02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:04.391]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:40:04.551 --> 02:40:13.399]  Well, you know, Wal-Mart out in Crystal City, California, promised to give the sales tax back to Crystal City at the end of so many years.
[02:40:13.479 --> 02:40:19.024]  The minute that year period was up, Wal-Mart moved out of town and closed the store.
[02:40:20.621 --> 02:40:21.622]  Well, that's what they do, too.
[02:40:21.662 --> 02:40:28.286]  They build these little Walmarts to build up their capital, and then they break the deal and move ten blocks away and build a super slave mart.
[02:40:28.766 --> 02:40:38.973]  Well, it's a march towards monopoly and domination, and the way of counteracting that under law, and with good legal precedent, is just to go into court.
[02:40:39.233 --> 02:40:41.174]  What about the good old-fashioned boycott?
[02:40:41.614 --> 02:40:45.757]  Well, it's illegal for you and I to reach an agreement to boycott.
[02:40:46.177 --> 02:40:48.679]  Basically, you have to be very careful for a town
[02:40:49.292 --> 02:40:53.853]  You can give information to people and let them conclude individually who they should boycott.
[02:40:53.873 --> 02:40:56.834]  Well, can't I start a website and boycott Walmart if I want to?
[02:40:57.074 --> 02:41:05.556]  What I would say is that you should give information that would allow people to boycott individually on their own without an agreement to boycott.
[02:41:05.596 --> 02:41:12.658]  But an agreement to boycott is an antitrust violation and Walmart would be the first to pursue that in their favor against you.
[02:41:12.678 --> 02:41:14.778]  Yeah, but I have my free speech to say I'm boycotting.
[02:41:15.018 --> 02:41:16.218]  Well, that's true.
[02:41:17.519 --> 02:41:18.859]  You can announce information
[02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:21.733]  But you can't enter into a conspiracy.
[02:41:21.753 --> 02:41:23.594]  You have to let everyone choose his own.
[02:41:24.034 --> 02:41:30.038]  I would have a database showing who's buying from foreign countries and how much are they making here?
[02:41:30.118 --> 02:41:31.199]  Who are they employing here?
[02:41:31.239 --> 02:41:42.847]  And I would let that information be disseminated and let people choose for themselves if they're going to support the people that don't support them or whether they're going to support their community.
[02:41:43.508 --> 02:41:45.349]  And that kind of a boycott
[02:41:46.351 --> 02:41:49.998]  Doesn't Walmart already have like 35% of all retail sales?
[02:41:50.739 --> 02:41:57.672]  In the food industry, they're close to 35% of all food sales in the country, up from about 5 or 7% of about 8 years ago.
[02:41:59.235 --> 02:42:01.817]  So that is an exponential growth.
[02:42:02.118 --> 02:42:16.730]  Oh yeah, and the biggest retailers in the nation, the Kroger, Albertsons, First National stores, they're all up in arms claiming they can't compete with Walmart, but they're talking about the labor rate.
[02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:19.032]  They're complaining that Walmart is not unionized.
[02:42:19.433 --> 02:42:20.694]  I don't think that's the problem.
[02:42:20.754 --> 02:42:26.299]  I think that the cost of goods is so much lower with Walmart that the labor rate doesn't make any difference.
[02:42:26.969 --> 02:42:29.390]  You've got to enforce the nation's antitrust laws.
[02:42:29.610 --> 02:42:34.812]  Well, think about a company that makes its employees work extra hours without paying.
[02:42:35.952 --> 02:42:38.493]  You have redress, and the courts will redress that.
[02:42:38.773 --> 02:42:40.714]  That's something that you can get redressed.
[02:42:40.734 --> 02:42:42.355]  But to them, that's the cost of doing business.
[02:42:42.555 --> 02:42:43.495]  Yeah, they don't mind.
[02:42:43.515 --> 02:42:46.316]  Well, they get caught with illegal aliens working there instead.
[02:42:46.356 --> 02:42:50.378]  Well, that's the cost of doing business, and they'll pay here and pay there for their
[02:42:51.730 --> 02:42:54.411]  But I know a lot of these small towns, that's really the only job.
[02:42:54.831 --> 02:42:57.952]  Imagine a boarded up town with a dirty Walmart down the street.
[02:42:58.172 --> 02:42:58.912]  Let's take a call.
[02:42:59.552 --> 02:43:02.894]  Let's talk to, up first, Fred in Philadelphia, then Eric and others.
[02:43:02.914 --> 02:43:03.454]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:43:03.914 --> 02:43:04.414]  Okay.
[02:43:05.174 --> 02:43:11.436]  I wanted to say that you have a lot of political racketeering going on.
[02:43:11.976 --> 02:43:15.998]  It's not just conspiracy on an economic level.
[02:43:16.038 --> 02:43:17.118]  You have bribery.
[02:43:17.778 --> 02:43:18.658]  I don't care what this
[02:43:20.828 --> 02:43:25.029]  American law against bribery says, there's bribery going on.
[02:43:25.129 --> 02:43:32.391]  Is that an avenue to pursue legal... Yeah, what about when Walmart lobbies and pays for politicians?
[02:43:32.451 --> 02:43:37.252]  Okay, interestingly enough, commercial bribery is outlawed by the Robinson-Patman Act.
[02:43:37.312 --> 02:43:41.993]  It's just a weird construction of the Robinson-Patman Act, but when you have commercial bribery,
[02:43:43.071 --> 02:43:45.694]  You can actually get them under that section as well.
[02:43:46.114 --> 02:44:00.305]  Bribing a congressman is something else, and sometimes a congressman gets caught, but people... But I mean, what is it called when Walmart comes and gives money to a mayor, who then comes out and says, let's give Walmart tax-free?
[02:44:00.345 --> 02:44:02.287]  I mean, that is a clear 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:44:03.167 --> 02:44:07.551]  It's a conflict of interest, and it's something that is a criminal violation.
[02:44:08.254 --> 02:44:09.936]  I would say it's a criminal violation.
[02:44:09.956 --> 02:44:11.697]  But I never heard of Walmart getting in trouble for that.
[02:44:11.958 --> 02:44:13.359]  Well, people are reluctant.
[02:44:13.439 --> 02:44:14.740]  First of all, it's hard to prove.
[02:44:16.082 --> 02:44:16.842]  It's hard to prove.
[02:44:16.903 --> 02:44:20.746]  People will deny it, and then there are political interests against trying to pursue it.
[02:44:20.766 --> 02:44:20.906]  Alex?
[02:44:21.307 --> 02:44:21.527]  Alex?
[02:44:21.727 --> 02:44:21.947]  Yes?
[02:44:22.268 --> 02:44:23.068]  I have another question.
[02:44:24.212 --> 02:44:29.757]  When a company gets this big, first of all, Walmart is not really an American company.
[02:44:30.137 --> 02:44:33.980]  Walmart is a world company, a global giant company.
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:35.962]  It's mainly invested in China.
[02:44:36.002 --> 02:44:37.283]  I'd call it a Chinese company.
[02:44:37.343 --> 02:44:44.408]  When it gets this big, I think that it has special abilities that other large companies can't do.
[02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:49.770]  And I think... No, it's a super predator!
[02:44:49.971 --> 02:45:01.553]  They've hidden these gigantic subsidies and even treaties can't seem to outlaw on... That's a subsidy when we have a zero or two percent tariff on China and they've got a forty percent tariff on us.
[02:45:01.593 --> 02:45:02.173]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:03.214 --> 02:45:04.654]  Comments on that, Mr. Pearson?
[02:45:05.114 --> 02:45:07.655]  Yes.
[02:45:07.735 --> 02:45:14.456]  When a company gets to a certain size, they no longer look at America as being their benefactor exclusively.
[02:45:14.516 --> 02:45:17.457]  They have benefactors all over the world and they deal with them
[02:45:18.081 --> 02:45:21.183]  To maximize their profits, and they don't care who they hurt.
[02:45:22.104 --> 02:45:28.129]  So that wherever you can go to maximize your profit is where you head if you're a major corporation.
[02:45:28.169 --> 02:45:30.290]  And again, folks, they do it through leveraging.
[02:45:30.811 --> 02:45:34.313]  They do it through monopoly and oligopoly practices.
[02:45:34.333 --> 02:45:35.994]  They do it for getting tax exemption.
[02:45:36.395 --> 02:45:40.658]  It is not free market, and you're slitting your own throat when you buy stuff from these people.
[02:45:40.978 --> 02:45:44.020]  But the cure is just to have private enforcement of law.
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:47.243]  The law allows you to do that, and a town is the best one
[02:45:47.743 --> 02:45:56.286]  To bring suit like that, because the individual residents of the town will get a payback every year of five or ten thousand per family.
[02:45:56.806 --> 02:45:57.987]  Eric in California.
[02:45:58.167 --> 02:45:58.947]  Eric, you're on the air.
[02:45:59.007 --> 02:45:59.407]  Go ahead.
[02:45:59.567 --> 02:46:00.528]  Thank you for having me on again.
[02:46:01.148 --> 02:46:06.390]  Now, a thing about like with Walmart, how is it that Walmart can thrive in these ghost towns when there's no one there?
[02:46:06.450 --> 02:46:07.370]  That's one thing that's bothering me.
[02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:12.092]  Because people from all over, it kills a bunch of towns around it, they all then come into Walmart
[02:46:13.425 --> 02:46:19.047]  And when Mr. Pearson talks about $5,000 to $10,000 a year, money you spend locally predominantly stays there.
[02:46:19.067 --> 02:46:26.589]  When it goes to Walmart, it shoots to New York and D.C., it shoots to China, it, you know, goes to build Walmarts in Russia and Mexico.
[02:46:27.689 --> 02:46:28.369]  That's what's happening.
[02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.669]  Go ahead.
[02:46:29.249 --> 02:46:31.330]  I mean, it's absolutely, it's just so strange.
[02:46:31.350 --> 02:46:33.931]  It's like, you know, how the heck could this survive and stuff like that?
[02:46:33.971 --> 02:46:39.212]  Now, I think the good news is that, and I hope, I know this isn't the news you really want to hear, but eventually they're going to run out of slaves.
[02:46:39.847 --> 02:46:46.049]  I mean, the idea that over and out slaves are being paid... But then Walmart will move into law enforcement and private prisons.
[02:46:46.729 --> 02:46:48.069]  See, it's all about control.
[02:46:48.610 --> 02:46:49.930]  It isn't even about free market.
[02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:51.030]  So it's just a fun group.
[02:46:51.850 --> 02:46:53.851]  Let me get a comment from Mr. Pearson.
[02:46:53.871 --> 02:46:55.892]  We're not going to run out of people.
[02:46:55.992 --> 02:46:58.452]  There's 3 billion Indians and Chinese.
[02:46:59.012 --> 02:47:04.434]  And you compare that to 100 million Americans that may be available for work, or 136 million.
[02:47:04.694 --> 02:47:06.355]  Yeah, that's going to be their new market.
[02:47:06.375 --> 02:47:07.595]  They're going to use America
[02:47:08.694 --> 02:47:13.736]  To build up their market share, to buy up other industries here, and then their main sales base.
[02:47:13.756 --> 02:47:17.978]  This is their argument after we're totally shut down here, is that they're going to sell to Chinese, right?
[02:47:18.578 --> 02:47:27.602]  Yeah, they're going to make their money wherever they can, and it's not here because it supports mortgages and new cars and stuff, and they've got to get rid of that.
[02:47:27.642 --> 02:47:30.483]  They've got to get rid of the pension fund legacy of it.
[02:47:30.503 --> 02:47:32.644]  Yeah, they say you don't deserve that, folks!
[02:47:33.724 --> 02:47:35.525]  So you're going to have to... Oh, it's incredible.
[02:47:35.979 --> 02:47:37.660]  But a lawsuit can do it.
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:41.341]  A lawsuit by many towns can start correcting the problem.
[02:47:41.361 --> 02:47:42.342]  That's all that you need.
[02:47:42.362 --> 02:47:45.703]  Yeah, Enron was much smaller, as you said, but they thought they were invincible.
[02:47:46.144 --> 02:47:51.426]  But they did get them on something small over projecting their profits and cooking the books.
[02:47:51.686 --> 02:47:53.327]  Just like you get Al Capone for income tax.
[02:47:53.347 --> 02:48:00.930]  But, you know, if you see anyone else doing that, an attorney general for the town can bring suit on behalf of the people in town that are being hurt.
[02:48:01.810 --> 02:48:02.831]  You can get a redress.
[02:48:03.519 --> 02:48:04.900]  Through a town attorney general.
[02:48:04.921 --> 02:48:05.661]  That's what we need.
[02:48:05.681 --> 02:48:07.063]  Well, you've been out there preaching this.
[02:48:07.103 --> 02:48:08.184]  Are you getting any feedback?
[02:48:08.344 --> 02:48:13.309]  Well, I'm negotiating with Woodstock, New York to be appointed and several other towns.
[02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:17.033]  And as soon as I have one town that appoints me as town attorney general,
[02:48:17.498 --> 02:48:23.061]  I'm going to give free health care and reduce real estate taxes, or eliminate them, for the whole town.
[02:48:23.522 --> 02:48:30.866]  And every other town in the nation will start demanding that, and that's the grassroots approach we need to change the existing situation.
[02:48:31.246 --> 02:48:33.327]  I want to understand how you're going to do that when we get back.
[02:48:33.928 --> 02:48:34.728]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[02:48:34.768 --> 02:48:35.249]  Good point.
[02:48:35.849 --> 02:48:36.990]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:37.010 --> 02:48:38.430]  We're entering into the final segment.
[02:48:38.771 --> 02:48:42.613]  You can get the book, Saving Main Street, at GCNlive.com right now.

[02:49:21.525 --> 02:49:23.425]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:52.040 --> 02:52:00.210]  I'm sorry I don't have time to take any more calls.
[02:52:00.270 --> 02:52:04.515]  We covered a lot of news, but some of it we didn't.
[02:52:04.575 --> 02:52:08.319]  It's all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:11.062]  Why is the website called PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:52:12.958 --> 02:52:14.239]  Because they're building a prison planet.
[02:52:14.279 --> 02:52:15.940]  It's all about control, control, control.
[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:18.062]  These corporations have become bigger than governments.
[02:52:18.702 --> 02:52:25.827]  Of the 100 biggest economies in the world, what, 45 of them are corporations.
[02:52:27.068 --> 02:52:28.068]  They act like governments.
[02:52:28.108 --> 02:52:28.949]  They are governments.
[02:52:29.009 --> 02:52:32.091]  Everything's shifting, quote, to privatization, but that's not privatization at all.
[02:52:32.751 --> 02:52:42.118]  That's giving government power and monopoly of the control of the roads, the prisons, you name it, the private entities that go in and out of government as a revolving door.
[02:52:43.450 --> 02:52:47.533]  You've got to get my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.

[02:53:10.117 --> 02:53:11.118]  It's having a big effect.
[02:53:11.158 --> 02:53:12.218]  Expose the Globalist.
[02:53:12.378 --> 02:53:14.499]  Please get the film.
[02:53:14.519 --> 02:53:33.229]  1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 Or go watch free clips of all my films and free chapters of my book and Paul Watson's book and all of it at InfoWars.com and then order a hard copy via the SafeSecure online shopping cart.
[02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:34.890]  Please get the new film.
[02:53:34.930 --> 02:53:36.491]  You will not be disappointed.
[02:53:36.511 --> 02:53:39.593]  You've heard the rave reviews from the listeners that have gotten the new film.
[02:53:40.473 --> 02:53:41.534]  It's really three films in one.
[02:53:42.014 --> 02:53:43.456]  But all the other films are great as well.
[02:53:43.536 --> 02:53:44.636]  Triple 8, 253-3139.
[02:53:44.937 --> 02:53:54.945]  If you want to get Saving Main Street and its retailers, it's really an excellent book, you can go to GCNlive.com and get it from the mall right there.
[02:53:55.505 --> 02:53:56.046]  Or you can call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:56.066 --> 02:53:56.106]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:56.126 --> 02:53:57.887]  And Carl E. Pearson's website is lawmall.com.
[02:54:06.966 --> 02:54:22.949]  Mr. Pearson, the last minute or two we've got left here, are you saying that the added, from the statistics that are out there, the added, the money staying in the town will be an extra $5,000, $10,000 a year and that's health care and a lot of other key things to people?
[02:54:22.989 --> 02:54:25.530]  Is that your point about free health care or what are you saying?
[02:54:25.810 --> 02:54:36.012]  I'm saying sue the wrongdoers that hurt the town and you can collect damages and they will settle and you can use the settlements to give back to the people some of the money that's being stolen from them.
[02:54:37.313 --> 02:54:40.355]  Not just the economic benefits of getting rid of this monstrosity.
[02:54:41.216 --> 02:54:46.199]  There's a lot of ways that towns are being hurt, and they don't have anyone in the town addressing that.
[02:54:46.799 --> 02:54:50.082]  A little Elliot Spitzer will bring suit against the wrongdoers.
[02:54:50.622 --> 02:54:52.243]  Some will settle, some will go to trial.
[02:54:52.283 --> 02:54:54.364]  There'll be plenty of money to distribute every year.
[02:54:54.705 --> 02:54:57.046]  You know the boardrooms have talked about you and others.
[02:54:57.066 --> 02:54:58.287]  What do you think they're saying about you?
[02:54:58.627 --> 02:55:02.711]  Well, I think the manufacturers of the nation look upon me as their only help.
[02:55:03.171 --> 02:55:06.914]  That even though I may be painful, that I'm the only way they're going to survive.
[02:55:07.015 --> 02:55:10.538]  So that they tolerate me knowing that I'm trying to save them.
[02:55:10.558 --> 02:55:12.039]  Why don't they fight Walmart?
[02:55:12.699 --> 02:55:13.600]  They lose the business.
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:14.341]  They're afraid to.
[02:55:14.381 --> 02:55:16.243]  The officers will never get another job.
[02:55:16.283 --> 02:55:21.267]  They'll never be invited to a party again if they announce that they can't compete.
[02:55:21.968 --> 02:55:24.630]  So everyone is looking for me to do the work.
[02:55:25.754 --> 02:55:26.854]  But it's a rigged game.
[02:55:26.895 --> 02:55:31.456]  I mean, when somebody goes out there with a corked bat, they get in trouble in baseball.
[02:55:31.556 --> 02:55:34.818]  When people lay down in a boxing match, it isn't a real boxing match.
[02:55:34.838 --> 02:55:38.399]  They go into bankruptcy and they emerge as Kmart No.
[02:55:38.419 --> 02:55:39.200]  5, Kmart No.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:40.180]  6, Kmart No.
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:40.180]  7.
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:41.221]  When does it end?
[02:55:42.241 --> 02:55:42.481]  Right?
[02:55:42.641 --> 02:55:43.922]  You see how it goes in and out?
[02:55:44.562 --> 02:55:45.922]  Well, the others will do that too.
[02:55:46.003 --> 02:55:47.183]  Kmart was No.
[02:55:47.203 --> 02:55:47.863]  2 at one time.
[02:55:48.704 --> 02:55:50.885]  The second largest retailer in the nation.
[02:55:52.325 --> 02:55:54.126]  And it can't compete against Walmart.
[02:55:55.347 --> 02:56:06.272]  The answer is to sue the various manufacturers and retailers causing the problem and it'll stop it because the manufacturers can't afford the price.
[02:56:06.332 --> 02:56:07.553]  They will stop the practice.
[02:56:08.517 --> 02:56:19.746]  Well, I'll tell you, Walmart's evil, just plain and simple, with this RFID garbage, and I commend you for suing them.
[02:56:20.066 --> 02:56:24.089]  All right, Carly E. Pearson, thank you for joining us, and your great book, Saving Main Street.
[02:56:24.129 --> 02:56:24.469]  Take care.
[02:56:24.509 --> 02:56:24.869]  Thank you.
[02:56:24.909 --> 02:56:25.350]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:25.770 --> 02:56:29.293]  All right, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:56:29.313 --> 02:56:31.414]  More guests, more calls, and more vital news.
[02:56:31.454 --> 02:56:32.395]  God bless you all!
