[00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.108]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:07.849]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:11.152]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:12.733]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.076]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:21.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:31.266]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:35.148]  It is the 14th day of November 2005.
[00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:36.568]  It is Monday.
[00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:44.250]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson will be joining us in studio coming up in about an hour and a half.
[00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:53.373]  We're also going to have wide open phones today and be taking your phone calls on any issue or news item that you wish to discuss here on air.
[00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:58.915]  And we have a ton of really important news and information that we'll be covering as well.
[00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:04.518]  Bird flu out of control in Chinese province.
[00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.683]  Ah yes, the bird flu is completely and totally out of control.
[00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:17.228]  It's spread into another province and it's attacking chickens and ducks everywhere.
[00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:18.929]  So we better give up all of our freedoms.
[00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:23.833]  China just loves using this to crack down on their population and show them who's boss.
[00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:28.057]  Mammals at greater risk as bird flu strain begins to mutate.
[00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:31.179]  And then we continue on with this article.
[00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.904]  Out of Japan, the Associated Press, Tamiflu is cited in two teen deaths, report says.
[00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:50.034]  In Japan, it is listed on the bottle, the government advisory, warning that it can cause you to have hallucinations, kind of like Prozac.
[00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:54.678]  So, we'll tell you about Tamiflu before you start gobbling it for the common flu.
[00:01:57.074 --> 00:02:03.677]  And shifting gears, White House declines to rule out torture to thwart attack.
[00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:10.860]  They say if it'll stop Al-Qaeda from getting us, then torture is a good thing.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.861]  As if you can trust intel from torture.
[00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:15.523]  As if you can trust a government that will torture.
[00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:16.523]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:20.645]  White House declines to rule out torture to thwart attack.
[00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.671]  And a little article here out of Drudge, drones to fly over U.S.
[00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:36.935]  cities, as well as blimps, and many different companies like Lockheed Martin and Honeywell have developed or are developing these, and they're getting smaller and smaller.
[00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:47.939]  In fact, the LAPD has bought, what, 14 of these earlier this year, and they're just going to be flying around everywhere with the hundreds of Cessnas and other aircraft the government owns, watching and
[00:02:48.599 --> 00:03:01.330]  Surveilling us, and they're also moving into armed combat vehicles that are remote controlled to quote, deal with the terrorists, microwave guns and sound cannons are being delivered to major metropolitan departments around the country.
[00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.951]  They've got to suppress us.
[00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:04.232]  They've got to dominate us.
[00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:12.679]  It's, as we enter into this new age of New World Order tyranny, and there's just so much more here.
[00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:13.520]  There's some good news.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.422]  Of course, we already knew this.
[00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:29.735]  I remember five, six, seven, even longer than that, years ago, reading about people who had had HIV for decades, but were taking vitamins and living healthy lifestyles and weren't dying.
[00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.535]  But every time you get on the medication, you do die.
[00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:38.057]  And then almost everyone who was dying from it either had already had autoimmune disease or was a hemophiliac.
[00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:46.307]  Or they use a lot of methamphetamine or other street drugs that have been cut or produced with deadly chemicals.
[00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:52.575]  And you start taking a bunch of mercury and lead and other toxins that are associated with the production.
[00:03:53.314 --> 00:04:02.037]  Of these illegal drugs, that is what literally kills you, and there are actually treatments for that, but they don't tell you about that.
[00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:12.400]  They've got more deadly drugs to kill you, and then they find this virus in you, they claim that that's what's killing you, and then they indeed kill you.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.401]  And by the way, I heard doctors talking about this.
[00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.760]  Fifteen years ago, and I didn't believe them.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:31.627]  I had to read the papers, read the government documents, read the Nobel Prize winner reports on this, but now it's in the BBC, it's in the London Independent, it's just all over the place.
[00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:41.692]  That man who might hold the secret to defeating AIDS, Jeb Bush, leaves open White House, barely promised he wouldn't, but
[00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.776]  Again, promises are made to be broken by these people.
[00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:49.221]  GOP memo touts new terror attack as way to reverse party's decline.
[00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:52.064]  We talked about this on Friday, but this is big news.
[00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:52.665]  I want to get into it.
[00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:58.852]  And more about our groundbreaking interview with the Professor Jones on Friday.
[00:04:58.872 --> 00:04:59.292]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.242]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:07.063]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.086]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise, The Police State.
[00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:19.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.470]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.511]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:29.272]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:33.874]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.114 --> 00:05:41.336]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:43.997]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.754 --> 00:06:07.257]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:11.679]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.540]  We listened.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.823]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:18.584]  We listened.
[00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:22.006]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:22.966]  We listened.
[00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:25.808]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:26.828]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.321]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:55.883]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:04.326]  Government is best what governs least.
[00:07:04.907 --> 00:07:06.207]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:06.648 --> 00:07:09.290]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.452]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:19.356]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:42.149]  Have you?
[00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.250]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.772]  If only our president would listen to his God.

[00:07:59.853 --> 00:08:03.657]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:13.939]  We're good.
[00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:30.213]  We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up.
[00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:33.714]  Ginger and Robert and Jeff and Bob and John and many others.
[00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:38.916]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:43.738]  Any issue, any news item, anything you wish to discuss, you're welcome to do it here.
[00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:48.440]  And as soon as you hear us move on from a particular caller, that's your chance to call in.
[00:08:50.035 --> 00:09:03.058]  I have a lot of people complaining they can never get through to the show, and that's just a little trick to at least try to get in, because we always do love to hear from new callers, as well as a lot of our classic callers.
[00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:14.620]  Look, I could spend all day on this, but China, Russia, the U.S., all these countries are using the bird flu as a way to consolidate power and control
[00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:21.473]  The big drug companies are making billions and billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars off of this.
[00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:25.181]  There are bird flus every year.
[00:09:26.155 --> 00:09:43.451]  As far back as anybody can remember, in Asia, because they breed the different types of fowl right in amongst pigs and cows and other animals, different species of animals, in these big feedlots.
[00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:48.096]  And the excrement runs together in these giant slurries.
[00:09:49.108 --> 00:10:01.179]  And the mutations, that is a prime breeding ground for these flu viruses to mix in amongst each other in this primordial, this primordial type of ooze.
[00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:04.222]  And this is what's causing it.
[00:10:06.024 --> 00:10:10.508]  And that is where most flus originate from that humans get.
[00:10:10.608 --> 00:10:12.610]  And so now they're looking at this particular flu
[00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:20.505]  And telling the world, as you know, that if it mutates, we're basically all dead and only world government and martial law can save us.
[00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:23.147]  And that just isn't the case.
[00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:36.273]  And we have top scientists around the globe saying that it's total hype, total fraud, but that doesn't stop the media and the corporations and our president and the drug makers from making money hand over fist, fear-mongering this.
[00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:40.752]  And look, I'm not saying the government isn't going to release some bioweapon.
[00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:41.513]  That's their plan.
[00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:44.854]  I don't know if it's going to happen this year, or five years from now, or ten years from now.
[00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:49.596]  But I know that all this fear-mongering just plays into their paradigm of control.
[00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:59.980]  In the last five years in a row, the government admits that the flu shot the public has taken isn't even the right flu vaccine for the dominant flu of the year.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.662]  In the last two years in a row, they've admitted this months before, but people say, I don't care, I want it!
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.262]  So that's just mindlessness, and the flu shot itself has just been proven to have massive side effects and problems.
[00:11:13.843 --> 00:11:22.566]  And if an individual over 60 has taken more than four flu shots, there is over a doubling in the chances that they're going to end up having very serious Alzheimer's.
[00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:34.711]  And Alzheimer's has the exact same list of symptoms and problems the disease does that mercury poisoning has.
[00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:45.632]  And you'd be interested to know that the flu shot, for some reason, and there's not even a regulation on this, just magically, the scores of companies that make it, predominantly in the U.S.
[00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:54.601]  and France and England, they just magically put many, many times higher levels of mercury than in what is in most vaccines.
[00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.951]  And you could just go read AP articles about it.
[00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.473]  Oh, they went from 50 timesave levels to 250.
[00:12:00.573 --> 00:12:02.214]  No one knows why.
[00:12:02.234 --> 00:12:06.297]  And then magically, you take a bunch of this and you get brain damage from it.
[00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:08.118]  You see, that's how it works.
[00:12:08.218 --> 00:12:10.079]  Over your normal life, you're going to eat mercury.
[00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:11.941]  You're going to absorb dioxin.
[00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.422]  You're going to have these poisons in you.
[00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:15.523]  Lead, arsenic.
[00:12:16.344 --> 00:12:24.109]  And that's one of the dominant things that kills us, is the toxin buildup in our joints and bones and our brain and our organs.
[00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.972]  That's what increases cancer.
[00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:31.279]  But you massively supercharge that, it's going to kill you a lot earlier.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.062]  I mean, this is not my opinion.
[00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:36.928]  Okay, you see I've already spent four minutes on this, and that's one article.
[00:12:38.112 --> 00:12:40.893]  But bird flu out of control in Chinese province.
[00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:51.757]  The Chinese government says the spread of the deadly H5N1 bird flu is one of its provinces is not under control and has warned of a potential disaster there.
[00:12:51.917 --> 00:13:02.061]  There have been three fresh outbreaks of the avian virus in the northern eastern province of Lanying in 24 hours and a new suspected human infection.
[00:13:02.822 --> 00:13:08.309]  And the Middle East has now seen its first definite case of H5N1 bird flu.
[00:13:08.369 --> 00:13:15.217]  The authorities in Kuwait have confirmed that a migratory flamingo found on a beach dead of the lethal strain.
[00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:19.702]  They say another bird suspected of having the virus had the milder H5N2 strain.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.184]  There have been six outbreaks in the past month in China and the government has responded by mass culls of poultry.
[00:13:27.484 --> 00:13:31.206]  The most recent outbreaks which killed 1,100 chickens.
[00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.347]  It's the end of the world folks.
[00:13:32.727 --> 00:13:40.012]  Prompted the authorities to cull 670,000 poultry in the areas affected and place 116 people in quarantine.
[00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:46.236]  But they don't place the millions of people with drug immune and drug resistant TB in quarantine.
[00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:50.619]  They don't put all the wet lepers 7,000 a year.
[00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:51.760]  That's the cases they know of.
[00:13:52.461 --> 00:14:01.233]  They don't put, and I see people walking around, obviously aliens who got stuff that looks suspiciously like leprosy, dripping things on their faces, but it's fine!
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.061]  It's delicious.
[00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:06.323]  But oh, but they're so worried about this.
[00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:11.827]  All these wonderful third world strains of spinal meningitis popping up, killing people.
[00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:13.428]  That's okay.
[00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:15.249]  You're not supposed to be afraid of that.
[00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.133]  By the way, I now have the video clip and I need to play it on air.
[00:14:20.513 --> 00:14:21.754]  We'll try to do it today or tomorrow.
[00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:24.252]  I have the video clip.
[00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:32.222]  Finally Fox News, gotta commend them here locally, admitted the rocket attacks, the mass murders, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:14:32.582 --> 00:14:35.445]  That's right, we're upwards close to a thousand now this year.
[00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:43.495]  I checked, last time I checked was three months ago, it was over six hundred, now it's getting close to a thousand dead on our side of the border and their side just here in Texas.
[00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:53.099]  In northern Mexico, all out war, dead cops everywhere, car bombs going off, machine gun attacks from San Antonio to Dallas, U.S.
[00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.241]  embassies closing, more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:59.463]  That's an official State Department report.
[00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:01.564]  And no one knows!
[00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:09.328]  Cops don't know, the public doesn't know, we see these articles and put them all together about the open border war three months ago when we first reported it.
[00:15:11.152 --> 00:15:15.635]  Fox News locally is calling it a war, and reporting on the mass carnage and death.
[00:15:16.075 --> 00:15:22.399]  Whole towns, giant cities, my giant 100,000 person towns are bigger, are ghost towns.
[00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:23.840]  People are moving out in mass.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.621]  The industry is shutting down.
[00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.922]  People are afraid to go out on the street at night.
[00:15:28.563 --> 00:15:32.065]  I mean, folks, we're talking about all out, just bedlam.
[00:15:33.305 --> 00:15:35.847]  Mass murder, burning, machine gunning.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.181]  And because the news didn't make a big deal out of it?
[00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:39.762]  Nobody cares.
[00:15:39.782 --> 00:15:46.446]  Can you imagine how they'd hype it if Al-Ciada actually existed outside of the CIA and outside of Mossad and MI6?
[00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:52.050]  If some Arab was actually down there and had shot five cops, much less upwards of 20 now?
[00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:59.395]  Can you imagine the shutdowns, the checkpoints, the helicopters, the army being called in, red alerts, sirens,
[00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:04.917]  Alert!
[00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:05.258]  Alert!
[00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:05.638]  Homeland!
[00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:06.018]  Homeland!
[00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:06.438]  Homeland!
[00:16:06.618 --> 00:16:07.678]  Give up all your freedoms!
[00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:08.219]  We've got you!
[00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.139]  But oh no!
[00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:09.879]  Rocket attacks!
[00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:10.480]  Machine guns!
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.580]  Truck bombs going off!
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.260]  Total death!
[00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:15.762]  And people are like, what's this guy even talking about?
[00:16:15.782 --> 00:16:17.182]  The news doesn't tell me to worry about it!
[00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:19.143]  If they don't tell me about it, it's not a problem!
[00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:27.692]  Just like the dripping leprosy and the oozing TB deaths every day in this town from deadly TB.
[00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:28.712]  Just stop!
[00:16:28.732 --> 00:16:29.732]  The media doesn't talk about it.
[00:16:29.752 --> 00:16:30.512]  It's no problem.
[00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.492]  Put your kids in school.
[00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:35.933]  All these illegal alien kids, hack on them with the drug-resistant TB, drug-immune TB.
[00:16:36.633 --> 00:16:37.594]  And what's the government's number?
[00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:41.514]  They say in a year, somebody with TB will give 45 people the disease.
[00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:48.636]  Okay, see, now I've covered three articles here and I have not even gotten moving yet.
[00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:54.372]  But you should be aware of this little tidbit.
[00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:57.253]  You really should be aware of this.
[00:16:57.353 --> 00:17:07.199]  Tamiflu cited in two teen deaths reports says two teenage boys who took the antiviral drug Tamiflu exhibited abnormal behavior that led to their deaths.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.983]  One jumped in front of an oncoming truck and the other apparently fell from a building.
[00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:29.276]  The Associated Press is reporting, and major Japanese papers are reporting, following the first incidents which took place last year, the prescription drug in Japan began carrying a warning that says possible side effects include abnormal behavior and hallucinations, the major Japanese paper reported.
[00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:42.584]  And then it goes into how there have been a bunch of other strange behaviors and bizarreness going on associated with Tamiflu, which a lot of experts are reporting doesn't even protect you from the flu.
[00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.052]  Continuing, where do I start?
[00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:51.593]  Number one, when we get back from break, I'm just going to go straight to your goals.
[00:17:52.794 --> 00:17:56.456]  But coming up, I'm going to spend some time on this.
[00:17:57.316 --> 00:18:01.418]  White House declines to rule out torture to thwart attack.
[00:18:01.438 --> 00:18:03.519]  I mean, we need to talk about this.
[00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.980]  Meanwhile, denying that they torture people and saying it's an urban legend.
[00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:12.263]  And Shalabi was here last week and he said it's an urban legend and he lied to us with WMD information.
[00:18:13.044 --> 00:18:14.745]  The same thing that Rumsfeld said.
[00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:16.286]  He said, I never said there were WMDs.
[00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:17.667]  That's a total urban legend.
[00:18:17.687 --> 00:18:19.108]  That's just a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:20.068 --> 00:18:21.349]  But we'll get into that also.
[00:18:21.389 --> 00:18:23.570]  These drones to be over all our major cities.
[00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:25.852]  Watching this, you know, it's freedom.
[00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.994]  And more on the man who might hold the secret to defeating AIDS.
[00:18:30.334 --> 00:18:39.340]  Admittedly, people who take masses of vitamins and take care of themselves and stop snorting methamphetamine, they stop dying of it because it isn't the virus that does it.
[00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:43.415]  And again, be afraid, be very afraid.
[00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:48.979]  It's probably going to end up being... Arnold looks like he's out of the running in 08, but probably still in 012.
[00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:51.441]  He's still got to expose this monster.
[00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:52.742]  But it's shaping up.
[00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:55.864]  He swore he had no plans for President, said he would not do it.
[00:18:56.184 --> 00:18:58.126]  Repeat, it was a total lie.
[00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.708]  Jeb Bush leaves open a White House bid.
[00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:01.128]  Reuters?
[00:19:02.812 --> 00:19:05.173]  It'll be Jeb and Hillary, two crime partners.
[00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:06.453]  I mean, it's actual theater.
[00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:07.354]  It's totally staged.
[00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:09.855]  Running, and you'll just have to vote for Bush.
[00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:11.936]  Can't have an evil Hillary in there.
[00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:13.496]  And it'll be the same program.
[00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:15.557]  This is how they stage it.
[00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:20.519]  GOP memo touts new terror attack as way to reverse party's decline.
[00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:26.321]  And this is confirmed in Capitol Hill Blue as the highest record of integrity.
[00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:29.302]  And they got this from inside their multiple White House sources.
[00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:34.563]  And it fits in with other PNAC statements.
[00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:40.605]  How wonderful it'd be if a whole bunch of us got killed and just how they hope it happens real soon.
[00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:42.665]  Oh, I'm sure you'll probably make it happen.
[00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.046]  So, we'll learn to worship you one way or the other, huh?
[00:19:47.147 --> 00:19:51.588]  And there have been some new developments with Professor Jones that we had on last Friday.
[00:19:52.848 --> 00:19:55.749]  Proud of my radio producer getting him first before any other show did.
[00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:58.210]  Even if other shows claim credit for it, that's okay.
[00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:07.111]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:20:07.391 --> 00:20:10.976]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:19.246]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:20:19.506 --> 00:20:25.148]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:30.691]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:20:30.951 --> 00:20:33.032]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:20:33.292 --> 00:20:45.437]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:50.100]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.261]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:51.441 --> 00:20:53.083]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:54.984]  That's FilterMag.com.

[00:22:02.968 --> 00:22:06.891]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:19.381]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:19.801 --> 00:22:20.201]  The U.S.
[00:22:20.242 --> 00:22:25.826]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:26.226 --> 00:22:28.428]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:31.349]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:31.389 --> 00:22:34.230]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:40.372]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:44.154]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:55.782]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:03.163 --> 00:23:10.051]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:23.065]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:23.966 --> 00:23:28.728]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:32.790]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?

[00:24:14.097 --> 00:24:22.659]  Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.
[00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:26.419]  Coming out this Friday, I'd like you to come see my new movie, I Walk the Line.
[00:24:26.439 --> 00:24:29.080]  Alright, just a gratuitous plug for that movie.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.900]  I can't wait to go see it.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.161]  Alright, a total mindless, uh, diversionary idiocy.
[00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:38.982]  Excuse me for opening the segment that way.
[00:24:39.002 --> 00:24:40.062]  I was talking to
[00:24:41.245 --> 00:24:45.207]  John, who runs the show during the break, he was talking about that movie coming out Friday, how he wanted to go see it.
[00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:47.108]  So I thought I would just remind people.
[00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:48.308]  I think that is coming out Friday.
[00:24:48.348 --> 00:24:49.329]  John, are you right about that?
[00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:51.770]  I haven't really been following it, quite frankly.
[00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:58.472]  Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson, both in studio here in the United States, joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:08.797]  And we could probably get them to tell you the story about how I led them over the wrong way at Enchanted Rock yesterday, and we had to do some impromptu rock climbing, hanging on by our fingertips.
[00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.967]  We only fell a couple times.
[00:25:13.067 --> 00:25:13.627]  That was fun.
[00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:14.207]  Okay.
[00:25:14.588 --> 00:25:17.509]  Got a lot of serious news coming up, but let's go to all your calls.
[00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:22.730]  Let's start just hammering through them in this short segment and coming up in the long segment after the break.
[00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.391]  Let's talk to Ginger in Georgia.
[00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:26.572]  Ginger, good to hear from you.
[00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:26.892]  Welcome.
[00:25:27.132 --> 00:25:27.732]  Yes, hi.
[00:25:28.132 --> 00:25:30.973]  We saw something this morning that is going to blow your mind.
[00:25:31.153 --> 00:25:36.335]  A gentleman that was one of the CI analysts came on CNN and told the truth about everything.
[00:25:37.195 --> 00:25:39.376]  People were calling in about the new world order.
[00:25:39.876 --> 00:25:42.018]  And all this, I mean, it was just awesome.
[00:25:42.698 --> 00:25:47.662]  So I got in touch with all the reps and I said... Did Ray McGovern or somebody get on to you?
[00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:48.283]  Yes.
[00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:50.124]  Unbelievable!
[00:25:50.164 --> 00:25:53.207]  They let Ray McGovern on C-SPAN.
[00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:54.968]  Who was conducting Washington Journal?
[00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:56.269]  I don't remember.
[00:25:56.349 --> 00:25:58.671]  I just listened to what he was saying.
[00:25:58.972 --> 00:26:01.373]  But I mean, everybody was calling in, going crazy.
[00:26:01.774 --> 00:26:03.175]  And I called the reps about it.
[00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:05.557]  I said, we need to call a 9-1-1 commission meeting right now.
[00:26:05.997 --> 00:26:08.219]  I said, this administration is gone.
[00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:10.772]  I mean, after what he told, it's gone.
[00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:12.532]  Well, I know this.
[00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:22.815]  I mean, we had one of the high-level Reagan administration officials, public servant's son, Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Roberts, and this is, you know, editor for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:23.675]  I know.
[00:26:23.736 --> 00:26:27.737]  He's on saying the government's terrorists, you know, they'll carry out terror attacks.
[00:26:28.177 --> 00:26:30.217]  I mean, listen, the facts are the facts.
[00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:34.919]  We now have White House memos where they're saying, we need another one, and right now,
[00:26:35.259 --> 00:26:36.939]  Okay, now the refs are aware of this.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.140]  There are some group of guys I'm working with up there in Washington, okay?
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.801]  They're fighting the new world order.
[00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:45.502]  And I'm going to tell you one of them, isn't it, is Nancy Pelosi.
[00:26:46.802 --> 00:26:49.903]  She got up there and told them off to their face the other day for the second time.
[00:26:50.063 --> 00:26:52.144]  Well, Ginger, that's good news and thanks for the call.
[00:26:52.424 --> 00:26:55.585]  Did anybody else see Ray McGovern on C-SPAN today?
[00:26:55.685 --> 00:26:57.185]  I've got to get that on tape.
[00:26:58.165 --> 00:26:59.786]  I always say I'm going to do that and then I forget.
[00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:02.406]  The only time we seem to get it is if you send it to us.
[00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:04.507]  Won't they re-air Washington Journal tonight?
[00:27:06.332 --> 00:27:10.795]  But I'd like to go online and find that, maybe play some clips of Ray McGovern.
[00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:18.960]  You know, you've heard Ray McGovern here for years, and look, two years ago, Ray wasn't this radical.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:25.884]  But now he comes right out and says, oh yeah, there's a criminal element running the government, they may carry out terror attacks, they've carried out terror attacks in the past.
[00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:34.589]  He was number five at the CIA during the Reagan administration, and then he was even higher than that, the chief briefer for
[00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:36.666]  George H.W.
[00:27:36.706 --> 00:27:37.046]  Bush.
[00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:44.469]  And, you know, we have NSA officers on, we've had so many people on.
[00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:48.710]  I mean, German defense ministers on, high-level members of British Parliament on.
[00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.611]  So many prominent people.
[00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:54.652]  It's just the facts are the facts are the facts.
[00:27:55.192 --> 00:27:57.072]  And I'm glad to hear that you're excited about this.
[00:27:57.752 --> 00:27:59.493]  They really can't hold back the truth any longer.
[00:28:01.187 --> 00:28:04.250]  Unless they carry out a terror attack, which is what they're probably going to do, folks.
[00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:09.754]  There's probably going to be a bio-attack, and they're going to tell you it's bird flu, and it's going to be bad.
[00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:14.318]  I mean, I don't know if they're going to do that this year or next year or the next, but it's in the cards.
[00:28:14.338 --> 00:28:15.799]  They're really making preparations for it.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.821]  Robert in Texas.
[00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:18.701]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:19.142]  Go ahead.
[00:28:19.422 --> 00:28:19.982]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:20.863]  How you doing, man?
[00:28:21.063 --> 00:28:21.304]  Good.
[00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:23.365]  Hey, just real quick.
[00:28:24.625 --> 00:28:32.991]  Something happened this morning here in Austin about 10 o'clock this morning just a real quick flash and just a confirmation of your police state it's happening.
[00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:37.475]  I live over here near 51st and Guadalupe about a block from the intramural fields.
[00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:48.343]  Well the Travis County Sheriff's came this morning to arrest one of my neighbors this little bitty girl and I don't know what she did but I didn't see I saw I looked out my window and I saw two
[00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:50.919]  Look, marine looking guys.
[00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:56.324]  They were wearing these olive drab BDUs with sheriff embroidered across the back with combat boots.
[00:28:56.804 --> 00:28:58.706]  These two big shaved head marines.
[00:28:59.106 --> 00:29:12.838]  I thought, I wanted to go outside and ask them, hey, why are y'all dressed like soldiers, you know, to come arrest somebody, you know, and it was just real bizarre, but I was real angry and I know better than to
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.203]  You know, to say anything to them, because then they'd probably take me in too.
[00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:19.544]  Well, I'll tell you what the police state is, brother.
[00:29:19.584 --> 00:29:20.685]  It's the armored vehicles.
[00:29:20.765 --> 00:29:22.866]  It's the face scanning software and the cameras.
[00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:25.668]  It's the cell phones tracking your every movement.
[00:29:26.469 --> 00:29:31.432]  And then the militarized police with the skull tattoos, that's just part and parcel of it.
[00:29:31.832 --> 00:29:32.893]  Now they're dressing the part.
[00:29:32.933 --> 00:29:35.414]  I mean, it's a total intimidation factor.
[00:29:35.995 --> 00:29:38.957]  Plus, they don't even have exempt plates on their cars anymore.
[00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:43.303]  Using regular Texas license plates on the unmarked cars so you can't tell.
[00:29:44.845 --> 00:29:45.705]  Anything else, Robert?
[00:29:46.606 --> 00:29:50.110]  Uh, no, but that war is heading this way on the border and people... I hear you.
[00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:50.731]  I hear you.
[00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:52.433]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.933 --> 00:29:54.555]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:58.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:08.423]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.643 --> 00:30:13.645]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:13.965 --> 00:30:21.869]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:29.072]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:30.493]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:30.653 --> 00:30:34.034]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:34.094 --> 00:30:35.214]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:36.775]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:30:36.975 --> 00:30:43.798]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:46.379]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:49.484]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.504 --> 00:30:49.544]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:50.526]  One more time that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:01.388 --> 00:31:03.369]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.449 --> 00:31:14.155]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.536 --> 00:31:19.058]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:30.465]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.045 --> 00:31:37.912]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:40.434]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.935 --> 00:31:45.900]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Post-Filter Elements.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:52.366]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[00:31:54.488 --> 00:32:03.713]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:32:03.753 --> 00:32:06.654]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:12.238]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:13.979]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:16.280]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.942]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:32:20.322 --> 00:32:22.363]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:32:22.423 --> 00:32:29.347]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[00:32:29.527 --> 00:32:35.251]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:42.995]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:43.335]  Thank you.
[00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:12.299]  We're going to go back to your calls, Jeff and Bob and John and Rodney and others.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.321]  Let me get into some news.
[00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:20.383]  You know, it feels really good to have been a trailblazer.
[00:33:20.783 --> 00:33:21.503]  I am blessed.
[00:33:21.543 --> 00:33:27.045]  I am so thankful to God Almighty that my eyes were open to government-sponsored terrorism many years ago.
[00:33:27.945 --> 00:33:34.328]  I mean, I understood that governments carried out terror attacks routinely to blame it on their enemies or to crack down on their populations or both.
[00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:39.086]  But Oklahoma City was a major, major, major wake-up call.
[00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:41.868]  Clearly a government op.
[00:33:41.908 --> 00:33:54.957]  We know the names of the people, how they did it, how they got the bombs in, what they did, the diversionary blast, everything from A to Z. And then Bill Clinton, a year later, on Air Force One, he had about a 30% approval rating, 32% approval rating.
[00:33:56.676 --> 00:34:01.618]  And then a year later he had a 68% approval rating, and they said, what do you owe the revival of your presidency to in your re-election?
[00:34:02.118 --> 00:34:03.538]  And he said, the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:06.800]  Oklahoma City bombing brought us together as a nation.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.742]  And in my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, really the definitive film on government-sponsored terror, the classic.
[00:34:15.923 --> 00:34:21.765]  I mean, I had that sucker out just four months after 9-11, and it's frankly one of my best films, if not my best.
[00:34:22.365 --> 00:34:25.266]  It covers a brief history of government-sponsored terror,
[00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:39.839]  From the Reichstag, right through to Gulf of Tonkin, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, then it gets into what happened at the first World Trade Center bombing, where the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers, publicly admitted.
[00:34:39.939 --> 00:34:42.841]  See, that stuff's just public, but no one gets in trouble.
[00:34:43.886 --> 00:34:46.008]  And then we get into Oklahoma City.
[00:34:46.048 --> 00:34:47.889]  We spend 40 minutes in Oklahoma City.
[00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.612]  Then we spend another 40 minutes on 9-11.
[00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:54.034]  Then we spend a bunch of time on the police state they're going to set up.
[00:34:54.074 --> 00:34:56.016]  The thumb scanners in the grocery stores.
[00:34:56.076 --> 00:35:00.680]  The arresting people for their political speech or owning firearms.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.441]  All Christians are terrorists.
[00:35:02.461 --> 00:35:03.422]  The training manuals.
[00:35:03.482 --> 00:35:05.844]  FEMA actually teaching from the manuals.
[00:35:05.884 --> 00:35:07.145]  We don't just have the manuals.
[00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:09.507]  And mainstream news articles about the manuals.
[00:35:10.226 --> 00:35:12.187]  We actually have them teaching it.
[00:35:12.487 --> 00:35:14.848]  I mean, there's no debating it, little boys and girls.
[00:35:16.188 --> 00:35:18.289]  And see, it's almost a three hour film.
[00:35:19.249 --> 00:35:23.190]  Then you got my new film, Marshall Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.051]  So well produced, so much information, show shocking.
[00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:29.112]  The latest 9-11 info, it's a compendium.
[00:35:29.572 --> 00:35:32.033]  It's exactly three hours and 45 seconds long.
[00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:35.790]  You really need that mini-series.
[00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:40.332]  And then, of course, American Dictator is documenting how the left and right are owned by the very same people.
[00:35:40.592 --> 00:35:42.153]  And that's right at two hours.
[00:35:42.794 --> 00:35:44.414]  Actually, the DVD is more than two hours.
[00:35:45.275 --> 00:35:47.636]  All three of those for $44.95.
[00:35:47.776 --> 00:35:50.477]  That is over a $30 discount.
[00:35:51.038 --> 00:35:53.499]  That's the three DVD special right now.
[00:35:53.899 --> 00:35:55.080]  And I hope you'll get them.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.581]  It thrills me to no end to know that you're getting them.
[00:35:57.601 --> 00:35:58.361]  You're making copies.
[00:35:58.381 --> 00:35:59.402]  You're getting them out to people.
[00:36:00.302 --> 00:36:04.683]  If we do not expose who's behind the terror, the government's going to carry more terror out.
[00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:07.303]  They're going to set up concentration camps that are already built.
[00:36:07.743 --> 00:36:09.444]  They're going to start arresting and torturing people.
[00:36:09.464 --> 00:36:10.784]  They're going to take your private property.
[00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:12.404]  We're going to live in a total hellhole.
[00:36:12.944 --> 00:36:15.045]  Retina scanning to buy and sell and live our lives.
[00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:19.765]  Now, I mean, again, I was a weirdo to say that five, six years ago because I was reading their own documents.
[00:36:20.085 --> 00:36:21.966]  Now it's on the news as they get you ready for it.
[00:36:22.266 --> 00:36:23.086]  Torture is good.
[00:36:23.126 --> 00:36:24.086]  Secret arrest is good.
[00:36:24.146 --> 00:36:25.326]  Breaking up families is good.
[00:36:25.606 --> 00:36:26.887]  Forced inoculations is good.
[00:36:26.907 --> 00:36:27.907]  Forced drugging is good.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.021]  All of this classical tyranny is good.
[00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:34.041]  No, it isn't!
[00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:36.941]  No, it isn't!
[00:36:38.722 --> 00:36:41.222]  And we're talking about the end of America here.
[00:36:41.822 --> 00:36:55.365]  Again, the very people that say, give up your rights or the terrorists will get you and America will die, they're the very ones signing deals dismantling our liberties, dismantling our border, dismantling our sovereignty, dismantling our industry, and openly bragging and snickering about it.
[00:36:56.845 --> 00:36:59.766]  They openly call you slaves in position papers.
[00:37:02.228 --> 00:37:15.363]  You know, this is nothing new, this White House memo, but it's just another statement, and it should scare us, where they say, well, terrorist attacks would be really great, big ones that kill a whole bunch of people, that we could use their sorrow to then get our agenda through.
[00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:22.403]  I mean, they stopped one razor's hair from saying, we're going to do it.
[00:37:22.923 --> 00:37:24.203]  And believe me, those memos are there.
[00:37:24.623 --> 00:37:26.424]  And they got all sorts of horrible stuff.
[00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:38.347]  They hired us, what, five years ago, a Hollywood script writing firm, $40 million a year, $44 million, excuse me, to write fake scripts of terrorist attacks.
[00:37:39.053 --> 00:37:39.554]  And guess what?
[00:37:39.614 --> 00:37:42.516]  One of those scripts was hijacked jets flying over the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:37:42.556 --> 00:37:43.096]  The whole script.
[00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:44.478]  See, they need a script.
[00:37:44.658 --> 00:37:50.202]  And then if they get caught with a script, they say they're simply studying a possible scenario for a terror attack.
[00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:56.607]  And they even float the scripts and produce TV shows off of them months before.
[00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:58.429]  It's like a big joke to them.
[00:38:00.433 --> 00:38:02.674]  These are sick people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:03.115 --> 00:38:04.135]  Very, very sick.
[00:38:04.455 --> 00:38:13.020]  And when Brzezinski calls you and I a slave and talks about how they've got to enslave us for world government, I mean, this isn't a joke, people.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.642]  That's the former National Security Advisor.
[00:38:16.202 --> 00:38:18.323]  That's the founder of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:38:18.924 --> 00:38:21.005]  That's the guy that advises the neocons.
[00:38:23.326 --> 00:38:24.207]  I said I'd take your calls.
[00:38:25.353 --> 00:38:28.655]  It's just... I'm not radical.
[00:38:29.055 --> 00:38:40.702]  I'm just a normal good old boy who's got some street smarts, who's willing to read when somebody says I'm their slave and they're going to take all my rights and they're going to destroy my family's liberty and enforce drug me.
[00:38:42.263 --> 00:38:44.004]  I'll get on the radio and say it's wrong.
[00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:49.427]  I'm simply willing to repeat what these creatures have said.
[00:38:52.071 --> 00:39:01.697]  So, so, there's nothing really special about this broadcast, other than we also steer away from disinfo, we steer away from things that can't be proven, which so much of our community, the truth community, is obsessed with.
[00:39:01.977 --> 00:39:03.498]  And folks, most of that's COINTELPRO.
[00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:16.325]  If somebody wants you to just fight with each other all day, and if somebody tells you, you can't move forward, and you don't have power, and you can't affect change, they're of the devil, to use the term they're so fond of.
[00:39:16.365 --> 00:39:20.548]  I was listening to one of the other so-called Patriot Networks this weekend, and they have these two yahoos on there.
[00:39:22.483 --> 00:39:40.920]  And they were going, listen, we've never had a victory that's real, it's all the New World Order letting us have victories, and we can't do anything against this system, and there's nothing we can do, and they're just all-powerful, and it's just, there's nothing we can do, and there's these people on the air saying we're having victories, and it's just, it's just not true, and I knew exactly who they were talking about!
[00:39:42.102 --> 00:39:44.504]  It was the most sniveling garbage I've ever heard!
[00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:47.464]  Let me tell you something.
[00:39:47.504 --> 00:39:49.505]  We've had so many victories, it's ridiculous.
[00:39:49.985 --> 00:39:50.666]  Thank God.
[00:39:50.906 --> 00:40:02.992]  If we weren't on the front lines fighting, if we weren't engaging the enemy, if we weren't standing up against them and putting our full weight against them, we would already be in a brave new world matrix-like system.
[00:40:03.032 --> 00:40:04.974]  I mean, that's what the government openly wants.
[00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:12.638]  An 85 plus reduction in population, 85 plus percent, compact to cities, total enslavement, one-child policies,
[00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:17.041]  Shaved heads, grey uniforms, literally worshipping world government.
[00:40:17.061 --> 00:40:18.722]  Now that's their plan, people!
[00:40:22.225 --> 00:40:25.127]  You know, we've got the number of abortions down, so it's not perfect.
[00:40:25.167 --> 00:40:25.947]  It's better than nothing.
[00:40:25.987 --> 00:40:31.031]  We've gone from 70-some percent for abortion 20 years ago to 70-plus percent against it.
[00:40:32.312 --> 00:40:34.433]  And states moving all over the place to restrict it.
[00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:39.757]  Believe me, we would have had total amnesty if we wouldn't have beaten it three times.
[00:40:40.498 --> 00:40:42.780]  We would have had all these hate crimes laws, we wouldn't have beaten it.
[00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:49.044]  And if you can, well, you know, the end's coming, there's nothing we can do, and it's up to the devil if you try to stop it.
[00:40:49.324 --> 00:40:50.445]  That is a fraud!
[00:40:51.105 --> 00:41:04.034]  All the prophets did, and what the founding fathers did, and what good people have done throughout history, is go and warn them, and fight them, and try to stop it, and sometimes they did, and sometimes they didn't, and sometimes some listened, and were saved, and the rest were destroyed.
[00:41:04.314 --> 00:41:05.435]  But that's the point here!
[00:41:05.475 --> 00:41:06.436]  We, it, look,
[00:41:09.344 --> 00:41:11.205]  Consequences belong to God.
[00:41:11.225 --> 00:41:13.346]  I forget which founding father said it.
[00:41:13.406 --> 00:41:14.626]  Consequences up to God.
[00:41:14.986 --> 00:41:16.047]  Duty is ours.
[00:41:18.028 --> 00:41:20.509]  Well, there's no reason to help that old lady get mugged.
[00:41:20.529 --> 00:41:21.329]  There's four of them.
[00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:23.090]  You're gonna lose for sure.
[00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.771]  I don't have to do a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:41:25.891 --> 00:41:26.812]  I don't think about it.
[00:41:27.152 --> 00:41:34.475]  You can call me stupid and weak and dumb, and I guess a lot of people who think, oh, I look out for number one, I guess that type of individual would look at me as a fool.
[00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:37.860]  That I wouldn't even need!
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.461]  I wouldn't even think about it.
[00:41:40.261 --> 00:41:49.665]  If I saw them mugging some young woman out that window right now in that alley I'm looking at, there wouldn't be any discussion, there wouldn't be any thought about it.
[00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:52.526]  There wouldn't be any debate.
[00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:56.128]  I would only think about how to sneak up on them and attack them.
[00:41:56.588 --> 00:41:59.389]  As quickly as possible or I'd probably just charge right in.
[00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.951]  You can call me a dumb ox if you want, but I'm just a human being.
[00:42:04.176 --> 00:42:06.197]  I've got my basic instincts intact!
[00:42:08.797 --> 00:42:10.518]  That's how normal people behave.
[00:42:11.038 --> 00:42:12.739]  And they've driven this instinct from us.
[00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:15.199]  They've driven the instinct from us to protect our children.
[00:42:15.419 --> 00:42:18.620]  They've driven the instinct from us to protect our societies.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:26.863]  They've driven these basic instincts out of us or they're misdirecting them into false tribal simulated warfare sports and all the rest of it.
[00:42:26.903 --> 00:42:28.203]  I mean, it's a sick joke!
[00:42:30.244 --> 00:42:31.324]  And let me just say this.
[00:42:33.627 --> 00:42:36.269]  We are blessed to have the GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:38.491]  We are blessed to have the websites out there.
[00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:41.393]  We're blessed to have the alternative news we've got.
[00:42:42.414 --> 00:42:43.254]  I am thankful.
[00:42:44.455 --> 00:42:46.517]  I am incredibly honored.
[00:42:47.758 --> 00:42:50.280]  I am just completely blown away.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.565]  You know, nobody is in the office right now, and I'm looking at the waddy wads at the window.
[00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:58.166]  My staff are both at the store.
[00:42:58.186 --> 00:42:59.507]  One of them's an electronics store.
[00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:01.663]  You know, they're just off getting this lunch.
[00:43:02.284 --> 00:43:03.945]  And they're out there locked out.
[00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:09.229]  So I wonder if I can yell at them through this inner room out through the other windows and they'll hear me.
[00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:09.929]  I know they see me.
[00:43:12.612 --> 00:43:15.434]  There's this key point I always want to make, and I always get distracted before I say it.
[00:43:15.774 --> 00:43:17.355]  We are blessed to have these venues.
[00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:18.756]  I am very thankful for them.
[00:43:18.977 --> 00:43:21.999]  And I think all the listeners should be thankful for them and should support them.
[00:43:23.627 --> 00:43:29.391]  And it's just this loser mentality of, we can't fight City Hall, we can't get involved, there's nothing we can do.
[00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:34.995]  It's that attitude that got us in the position we're in today, and now we're trying to dig out of it.
[00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:40.019]  And I know this, even if we fail, digging out of it's going to save a lot of people.
[00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:42.120]  It's going to lessen the blow of the New World Order.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.443]  It's going to hold back just how sick and horrible it actually gets.
[00:43:47.084 --> 00:43:51.507]  Just the jellyfish mentality is unspeakable.
[00:43:53.268 --> 00:43:59.311]  I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and play this little newscast piece, and literally I get emailed about ten of these a day, but keep them coming.
[00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:14.159]  All over the country they're announcing how great thumb scanning is, and how wonderful thumb scanning is, and how soon we'll all be thumb scanned to buy and sell, and how it keeps you safe from identity fraud, and how it's the next best thing to slice bread.
[00:44:14.179 --> 00:44:20.482]  So let's go ahead and roll that little piece, and then we'll be right back and take your calls.
[00:44:21.292 --> 00:44:29.755]  At the Cup Food Store in Bridgeview, while other customers stand in line to pay cash, check, or credit, Anthony Bozinskas pulls out his finger.
[00:44:29.775 --> 00:44:31.356]  You don't have to go here.
[00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:32.596]  You don't have to do this.
[00:44:32.616 --> 00:44:33.796]  You don't have to do that.
[00:44:34.457 --> 00:44:36.737]  And here's a bing-bang-boom and you're out.
[00:44:37.058 --> 00:44:44.400]  In the snap of a finger, or in this case, the point of a finger, you can pay your bill with the store's new pay-by-touch technology.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.641]  Very simple.
[00:44:46.721 --> 00:44:48.923]  At this point, you simply insert your check.
[00:45:02.978 --> 00:45:05.920]  Cub installed the new system to shorten the checkout line.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:13.906]  They want to come in, shop, and then get through the checkout lane as fast as possible, and Pay By Touch allows us to speed up that process for them.
[00:45:14.186 --> 00:45:18.509]  You don't have to carry the cash or the, you know, credit cards, bulky credit cards, whatever.
[00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:20.050]  I just think it's a great idea.
[00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:20.970]  It's so futuristic.
[00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:28.255]  Cub stores are the first in the Chicago area to offer Pay By Touch, but this fingertip payment is expected to catch on.
[00:45:28.756 --> 00:45:29.916]  Dorothy Tucker, CBS2 News.
[00:45:32.228 --> 00:45:43.093]  Now they've done national studies and polls and the biometric consortiums have meetings and they've got whole websites and whole magazines that track it and they say you all basically hate it.
[00:45:43.133 --> 00:45:50.396]  90 plus percent of you can't stand it, you think it's evil and they just laugh at you and they tell the retailers how to make you take it.
[00:45:51.276 --> 00:45:54.678]  Now notice it makes it so quick, it's so easy, it's so fast.
[00:45:55.822 --> 00:46:03.229]  They've already got self-checkout lanes, boys and girls, and adding another identification system to it only increases all of that.
[00:46:03.269 --> 00:46:07.193]  This is for the national sales tax period, because it's going to be graduated.
[00:46:08.094 --> 00:46:12.658]  And you've got Borts and all the rest of them out pushing the fair tax, but see, they're going to keep the income tax with it.
[00:46:13.279 --> 00:46:21.006]  And then you're going to have to thumb scan so that, oh, we can't have people who are in the lower sales tax bracket off buying for rich people.
[00:46:22.556 --> 00:46:29.159]  And, you know, discounting those that are in the 28% sales tax bracket for those that, you know, don't have any sales tax costs.
[00:46:29.459 --> 00:46:36.762]  If you make under $18,000, there's not going to be any tax on you for some key items, like groceries and food and things like that.
[00:46:36.802 --> 00:46:39.043]  But it's going to be very low for other items as well.
[00:46:39.423 --> 00:46:42.605]  And it's going to bring federal control into all terminals, all sales.
[00:46:43.025 --> 00:46:43.725]  No more cash!
[00:46:43.805 --> 00:46:47.186]  Even if you pay cash, you will have to thumbprint to do it.
[00:46:47.267 --> 00:46:50.668]  It is the most hellish development you can imagine.
[00:46:52.173 --> 00:47:02.116]  But it's just like the thumb scanning a decade ago began to go into place and the average person just didn't want to believe this is happening.
[00:47:02.676 --> 00:47:06.557]  And then we go back six years ago when they passed the law that in 2001, and this is years before 2001,
[00:47:10.976 --> 00:47:13.138]  Well, actually, let me count up the years.
[00:47:13.198 --> 00:47:26.307]  It was 1996 when they passed the federal law that all cell phones would track you down to 15 feet and listen to you with the audio system as a bugging device, even when the phone's off.
[00:47:26.888 --> 00:47:33.713]  And they paid the phone companies to put it in, so that's four years, and then it's 2005, so it's actually almost nine years ago.
[00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:41.933]  But the law went into effect five years later, in 2001, October 1st.
[00:47:43.134 --> 00:47:47.157]  And you still tell the average person that their every movement is tracked by the cell phone.
[00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:50.840]  You tell the average person that it can be used as a bug to listen to them.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.401]  They just roll their eyes and giggle.
[00:47:53.282 --> 00:47:58.727]  Well, if you think that's bad, folks, this new system... Oh, now they're announcing they're going to use cell phones to give you tickets.
[00:47:58.767 --> 00:48:03.671]  When you speed, the cell phone will show that you sped from point A to point B. That's already beginning.
[00:48:04.978 --> 00:48:06.579]  They're going to use it to administer tolls.
[00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:12.340]  It'll just be added onto your phone bill because they're having trouble in some states getting the transponder laws passed.
[00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:14.621]  And they're going to track you and control you.
[00:48:14.641 --> 00:48:19.122]  And the way they're announcing it publicly, it's in the industry publications, what they're really going to do.
[00:48:19.983 --> 00:48:27.545]  But the way they're announcing it publicly is that, oh, it's just going to be used for the traffic systems to judge how fast traffic's moving.
[00:48:27.765 --> 00:48:33.347]  But don't worry, it's total anonymity while they're scanning your cell phone and tracking you.
[00:48:35.948 --> 00:48:41.071]  So... I mean, what am I supposed to say?
[00:48:41.091 --> 00:48:42.171]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:44.653]  I'm actually flabbergasted right now.
[00:48:45.473 --> 00:48:46.434]  I'm dumbfuddled.
[00:48:46.554 --> 00:48:48.635]  I mean, I can't even talk right now.
[00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:49.775]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:48:50.196 --> 00:48:51.376]  It's so obvious.
[00:48:51.416 --> 00:48:52.737]  It's so disgusting.
[00:48:53.157 --> 00:48:54.758]  It's so all-encompassing.
[00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:56.439]  It's so controlling.
[00:48:56.839 --> 00:48:58.360]  It's so un-American.
[00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:02.962]  And all over the nation, they pull out the self-service.
[00:49:03.002 --> 00:49:03.683]  They put in the
[00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:12.842]  I'm actually speechless right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:13.622 --> 00:49:14.062]  Actually, yeah.
[00:49:14.082 --> 00:49:17.163]  I don't even have anything to say anymore about it.
[00:49:18.643 --> 00:49:26.325]  They pull out the service lanes, they put in self-service, then they put in thumb scanners and tell you if you want food, if you want the products, do it.
[00:49:27.405 --> 00:49:31.246]  And we're about a year from almost every major chain putting in the thumb scanners.
[00:49:31.506 --> 00:49:31.946]  About a year.
[00:49:32.946 --> 00:49:35.127]  And then about a year after that, they're going to say you've got to do it.
[00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:39.152]  Because they're simply going to remove the service checkout lanes.
[00:49:39.973 --> 00:49:44.934]  And you've already been in the grocery store at 10 o'clock at night when there's no one there to check you out.
[00:49:44.974 --> 00:49:45.995]  You've got to use self-serve.
[00:49:46.315 --> 00:49:48.216]  You've already been in the Home Depot when it happens.
[00:49:48.276 --> 00:49:48.916]  It's happened to me.
[00:49:50.637 --> 00:49:53.638]  And chances are, if you're in a good-sized city, it's already happened to you.
[00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.339]  And this is domestication.
[00:49:56.939 --> 00:49:57.899]  This is enslavement.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.820]  This is the end of the country.
[00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.491]  And if you're going to let them do this to your children, c'est la vie.
[00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:05.232]  I mean, we cannot put up with it.
[00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.153]  But notice how they act like everybody's doing it.
[00:50:07.513 --> 00:50:08.433]  Everybody loves it.
[00:50:08.753 --> 00:50:09.353]  It's fun.
[00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:10.654]  Oh, it's so futuristic.
[00:50:10.794 --> 00:50:11.834]  Oh, it's so neat.
[00:50:12.255 --> 00:50:25.500]  And it's that same exact script, those same exact comments with just different reporters on ABC, CBS, NBC, you name it, across the board.
[00:50:26.503 --> 00:50:29.005]  It doesn't matter what station it is, where it is.
[00:50:29.205 --> 00:50:31.267]  That shows you the control!
[00:50:31.287 --> 00:50:40.034]  This is like, again, a late-night science-picture-horror movie, and I'm the guy breaking in, you know, over the Matrix lines to warn you.
[00:50:40.094 --> 00:50:43.857]  I mean, it's literally at that level, and it's so obvious!
[00:50:43.877 --> 00:50:46.279]  All right, we'll come back.
[00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:48.500]  It's 40 minutes till our guest runs.
[00:50:48.521 --> 00:50:49.401]  We have plenty of time to go to your calls.
[00:50:49.441 --> 00:50:51.343]  I'll go to Jeff, I'll go to Bob, I'll go to John, I'll go to Rodney.
[00:50:51.823 --> 00:50:52.684]  I'll get to everybody.
[00:50:52.744 --> 00:50:55.366]  It's just... It's such a nightmare, what's happening.
[00:50:56.024 --> 00:50:57.044]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:08.347]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:10.047]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.248 --> 00:51:12.448]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.588 --> 00:51:14.689]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.969 --> 00:51:19.890]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.271]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:26.292]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:37.020]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.061]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:53:18.078 --> 00:53:18.458]  I think so.
[00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:38.733]  I think so.
[00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:08.068]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.548 --> 00:54:11.369]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:24.135]  Folks, we have the White House with memos to Republican leaders about how great terrorist attacks would be to get their agenda going.
[00:54:26.356 --> 00:54:29.097]  We have different cities banning guns around the country.
[00:54:29.137 --> 00:54:33.319]  We have just a whole cornucopia of tyranny.
[00:54:34.525 --> 00:54:35.865]  Taking place against us.
[00:54:37.046 --> 00:54:39.227]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:54:39.287 --> 00:54:40.587]  Let's talk to Jeff and Mass.
[00:54:40.647 --> 00:54:41.447]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[00:54:41.887 --> 00:54:42.168]  Welcome.
[00:54:45.969 --> 00:54:49.150]  I guess he's listening on the computer or there's a delay on the station.
[00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:49.930]  He doesn't hear me.
[00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.331]  Let's go ahead and move on then.
[00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:54.872]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[00:54:54.932 --> 00:54:55.592]  Bob, go ahead.
[00:54:55.632 --> 00:54:56.152]  You're on the air.
[00:54:56.532 --> 00:54:57.072]  Hello, Alex.
[00:54:57.333 --> 00:54:57.613]  Hi.
[00:54:58.033 --> 00:54:58.793]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:54:59.473 --> 00:55:01.634]  I understand you went up to Enchanted Rock yesterday?
[00:55:02.614 --> 00:55:02.954]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:03.495 --> 00:55:08.097]  Oh, you must have been able to write Trump, because you weren't much around the back way, so you had to do some climbing.
[00:55:08.778 --> 00:55:09.038]  Yeah.
[00:55:09.458 --> 00:55:09.718]  Yeah.
[00:55:09.958 --> 00:55:11.219]  And also, Washington Town?
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.200]  Yes.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.540]  Oh, interesting.
[00:55:13.821 --> 00:55:23.666]  And one more thing, before I really get started, I guess they're talking about, on, I guess, the Washington Journal, how about the CIA, some guys from the CIA were on TV talking about everything?
[00:55:24.807 --> 00:55:31.191]  Yes, I've gotten a lot of calls that Ray McGovern was talking about, I guess, government-sponsored terrorism and other things like that, yeah.
[00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:34.039]  Okay, well, I'll throw my two cents in.
[00:55:34.359 --> 00:55:36.921]  I guess the way you have to see it, Alex, is that you're definitely rising.
[00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:40.824]  I remember a time, maybe like two, three years ago, where I didn't hear too many people talk about you.
[00:55:41.124 --> 00:55:43.686]  And if they did talk about you, they'd say conspiracy theorists.
[00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.128]  Well, I've been keeping my ears to the streets.
[00:55:46.669 --> 00:55:48.450]  And I've been hearing a lot of different people talking about you.
[00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.912]  It's like a catch-22 the way I'm looking at it.
[00:55:51.072 --> 00:55:53.074]  GCN's rising, RBN's rising.
[00:55:53.394 --> 00:55:54.335]  You're self-rising.
[00:55:54.695 --> 00:56:02.582]  As you rise, you have to see society coming down because of the level, because of where we are in the country, and because of the information that you know.
[00:56:02.842 --> 00:56:06.685]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call, but, you know, it isn't about Alex Jones rising.
[00:56:06.705 --> 00:56:09.207]  I mean, there's nothing rising.
[00:56:09.928 --> 00:56:13.651]  The numbers of readers of the website is rising, but it's not about that.
[00:56:14.792 --> 00:56:18.555]  It's about exposing government corruption and saving our society.
[00:56:19.916 --> 00:56:21.217]  This is about survival.
[00:56:23.022 --> 00:56:27.305]  This isn't about being a big shot and people thinking I'm cool.
[00:56:28.546 --> 00:56:29.367]  I can care less.
[00:56:31.968 --> 00:56:33.570]  The show isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.051]  I try to explain that to people.
[00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:38.313]  Earlier I was being self-deprecating.
[00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.154]  I mean, this is obvious.
[00:56:40.194 --> 00:56:41.335]  They're calling us slaves.
[00:56:41.355 --> 00:56:46.879]  They're putting in slave grids to track everything we do and to control us and to tax us and to abuse us.
[00:56:48.923 --> 00:56:49.683]  Case closed.
[00:56:50.443 --> 00:56:52.784]  But thank you so much for the kind words, Bob.
[00:56:53.724 --> 00:57:06.347]  It is good news that using Alex Jones as a figurehead, or as a sounding board, or as an indicator, that if you look at the individual Alex Jones, five, six, seven, eight years ago, I was really a kook.
[00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:10.568]  And then yeah, on 9-11 saying it was a government op, man, that guy's out there.
[00:57:11.408 --> 00:57:14.430]  I had so-called patriots walk up to me and go, you piece of garbage.
[00:57:14.971 --> 00:57:17.373]  And then lots of exposés exposing me.
[00:57:17.813 --> 00:57:27.781]  People were writing exposés a year after 9-11 saying, and I was, you know, just absolutely full of it, you know, full of baloney concerning 9-11.
[00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:35.947]  And now those very people claim they broke all the 9-11 stories and they're to watch people who criticize me for telling the truth.
[00:57:36.307 --> 00:57:41.151]  And then now they claim that they are just the grand hoobahs of it.
[00:57:41.838 --> 00:57:46.681]  Anybody who says that the Grand Poobah don't walk or run the other direction.
[00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:48.983]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Boston.
[00:57:49.023 --> 00:57:49.743]  John, go ahead.
[00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:51.305]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:51.325 --> 00:57:52.165]  How are you doing today?
[00:57:52.265 --> 00:57:52.645]  Good, sir.
[00:57:53.366 --> 00:57:53.626]  Great.
[00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:54.827]  Hey, I just wanted to call up.
[00:57:55.027 --> 00:58:03.333]  I'm feeling good out here because I've been noticing the effect of making copies of your videos and spreading them around.
[00:58:03.393 --> 00:58:04.974]  What difference it makes.
[00:58:07.313 --> 00:58:12.094]  Well, you know, I have a good friend who served in Vietnam, I'm sorry, in the Iraq War.
[00:58:13.035 --> 00:58:15.935]  And I just got back and I showed him your videos.
[00:58:16.776 --> 00:58:19.676]  Started making copies, distributing them at his gun club.
[00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:20.957]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:20.977 --> 00:58:23.417]  When we come right back after this break, I want to hear about it.
[00:58:24.598 --> 00:58:33.480]  And then coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson, who obviously are a lot of the
[00:58:34.793 --> 00:58:37.556]  EnergyBehindPrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:37.776 --> 00:58:38.517]  They'll be joining us.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.964]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.472 --> 00:58:58.112]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.773 --> 00:58:59.853]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.553 --> 00:59:01.654]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.314 --> 00:59:03.134]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.895 --> 00:59:04.735]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.455 --> 00:59:09.077]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.637 --> 00:59:13.739]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.879 --> 00:59:18.480]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.881]  The 14th day of November 2005.
[00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:24.723]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, now into the second hour.
[00:59:27.168 --> 00:59:38.833]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Paul Watson and Steve Watson from England will be in studio with us to talk about a whole host of issues, including White House declines to rule out torture if it keeps us safe.
[00:59:38.893 --> 00:59:40.234]  Torture is good.
[00:59:41.694 --> 00:59:51.679]  Also, internal Bush administration documents talking about how wonderful a terrorist attack would be, how helpful that would be to get their agenda through.
[00:59:54.489 --> 00:59:58.832]  Shades of 9-11 all over again, and it's the same thing everybody else is starting to say.
[01:00:00.294 --> 01:00:15.245]  Including, I'm told, and we have confirmed, that Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, former CIA analyst, advisor to Reagan and Bush Sr., was on C-SPAN talking about this this morning, and I'm told that Rodney, coming up in a couple calls, actually saw this.
[01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:16.746]  Maybe Rodney can tell us more about it.
[01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:21.193]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to John in Boston.
[01:00:21.793 --> 01:00:28.059]  John got cut off right before the last segment ended.
[01:00:28.479 --> 01:00:30.461]  We wanted him to be able to finish what he was talking about.
[01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.042]  Go ahead, John.
[01:00:31.682 --> 01:00:32.283]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:32.643 --> 01:00:42.792]  I just wanted to say that, you know, right after 9-11, you know, having listened to you and knowing what was going on and buying your videos and handing them out, I mean, people looked at me like I had three heads.
[01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:45.655]  People come to me and they want your videos.
[01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.477]  They want to know more about your website.
[01:00:47.637 --> 01:00:50.279]  And I've made a lot of copies.
[01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:51.880]  I've handed them out to a lot of people.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:57.204]  And now I have this Iraq war vet who fought in Iraq on the invasion.
[01:00:58.945 --> 01:01:03.929]  He took 9-11, rise of the police state, and police state 3.
[01:01:04.669 --> 01:01:05.530]  He's made copies.
[01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.291]  He's given them out to people in his unit.
[01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:08.752]  He's given them out at his gun club.
[01:01:10.484 --> 01:01:11.645]  And I just think it's amazing.
[01:01:11.665 --> 01:01:17.352]  I think we're really making a difference by just handing out these videos and talking about it and getting out there and engaging people.
[01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:19.474]  I mean, I used to be called a kook.
[01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:24.880]  I was thrown out of a couple bars here or there because I wouldn't shut up about it being an inside job.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.962]  And now people want to know even more.
[01:01:27.222 --> 01:01:30.446]  So I would just encourage everyone to really get out there, really stand up now.
[01:01:31.696 --> 01:01:43.761]  Well, you know that I love to repeat that Mark Twain quote of, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared, but in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:45.901]  You are that patriot.
[01:01:46.782 --> 01:01:48.162]  You are to be commended.
[01:01:48.842 --> 01:01:57.186]  And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for my children and all the children of America's future, because people like you are out there.
[01:01:57.646 --> 01:02:00.907]  We have a chance of beating this thing, and God bless you, my friend.
[01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:02.008]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:02.068 --> 01:02:02.608]  God bless you.
[01:02:03.009 --> 01:02:03.369]  You bet.
[01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.229]  Calls like that make it all worth it.
[01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.571]  We have to tell the truth.
[01:02:08.731 --> 01:02:12.352]  So much of propaganda is getting you to lie to yourself.
[01:02:13.112 --> 01:02:14.813]  Getting you to take the easy path.
[01:02:14.853 --> 01:02:16.073]  Getting you to be naive.
[01:02:16.173 --> 01:02:17.294]  Oh, they wouldn't do that.
[01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:18.294]  Everything's alright.
[01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:21.816]  Oh, I believe the government's bad, but not that bad.
[01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:25.497]  If you look at all the admitted things they've done,
[01:02:26.664 --> 01:02:32.347]  The atomic soldiers, the atomic children, radiating little babies in this country and in Israel.
[01:02:33.028 --> 01:02:38.311]  I mean, killing little toddlers, murdering our own troops, spraying nerve gas on them.
[01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:41.773]  Men were going out to train today, just flying over and killing them.
[01:02:41.813 --> 01:02:43.574]  Well, you've got to do that to be tough.
[01:02:45.455 --> 01:02:48.257]  We've got to get Saddam because he's torturing, but let's torture.
[01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:51.839]  All of this stuff's going on.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.302]  And I'll say it again, none of us are safe.
[01:02:57.461 --> 01:02:58.721]  While we sit idle by.
[01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:05.443]  While we sit idly by and let this New World Order put this program into place.
[01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:08.844]  They're putting in their electronic voting machines that are fraud driven.
[01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:11.285]  They're putting in their biometrics for the control grid.
[01:03:11.525 --> 01:03:13.806]  They're putting in their entire program.
[01:03:14.066 --> 01:03:18.787]  Their entire electronic straitjacket is going into place right now.
[01:03:19.468 --> 01:03:20.688]  No one is for it!
[01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:23.669]  We're the majority.
[01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:24.449]  We're the people.
[01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:25.870]  We're supposedly the consumer.
[01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.950]  We don't want it.
[01:03:28.331 --> 01:03:30.132]  It doesn't protect you from identity fraud.
[01:03:30.852 --> 01:03:31.412]  Identity theft?
[01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:32.472]  Don't put up with it!
[01:03:32.512 --> 01:03:33.112]  Boycott it!
[01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:33.553]  Fight it!
[01:03:35.153 --> 01:03:35.993]  Say no to it!
[01:03:38.274 --> 01:03:44.996]  Because if we let them put this in, and we're very close now with the RFID and all of it, it's gonna be really, really bad.
[01:03:46.136 --> 01:03:47.617]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:47.977 --> 01:03:49.877]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.429 --> 01:03:57.290]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.551 --> 01:03:59.131]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.471 --> 01:04:04.134]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:11.217]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:13.539]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.739 --> 01:04:16.581]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.682 --> 01:04:21.346]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.546 --> 01:04:25.950]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:33.416]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.656 --> 01:04:36.078]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:54.213 --> 01:04:57.196]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.556 --> 01:05:06.403]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:11.387]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.847 --> 01:05:18.572]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:18.973 --> 01:05:30.742]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:31.222 --> 01:05:35.685]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:05:42.929 --> 01:05:43.970]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.257 --> 01:05:54.799]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:05:54.959 --> 01:05:56.081]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:59.686]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:05:59.786 --> 01:06:00.227]  Phenol!
[01:06:00.547 --> 01:06:07.636]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:06:08.117 --> 01:06:12.060]  ETA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:12.601]  Fragrance?
[01:06:12.981 --> 01:06:17.745]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:17.885 --> 01:06:22.570]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.212]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:06:25.592 --> 01:06:29.014]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:06:29.154 --> 01:06:32.737]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:06:32.897 --> 01:06:35.238]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:06:35.439 --> 01:06:36.319]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:58.052]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:00.733]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.753 --> 01:07:10.096]  The social engineers think that we're all a bunch of idiot slaves.
[01:07:10.396 --> 01:07:12.317]  They think that we're not going to wake up to what they're doing.
[01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:15.838]  It's up to you out there to prove them wrong.
[01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:18.652]  Let's get back to your calls.
[01:07:18.672 --> 01:07:19.992]  They're coming up in about 20 minutes.
[01:07:20.012 --> 01:07:23.494]  We'll be joined by Steve Watson and Paul Watson in studio.
[01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:26.815]  We're actually hooking up some more microphones and things right now.
[01:07:26.855 --> 01:07:28.176]  I have this set up for one guest.
[01:07:29.056 --> 01:07:36.280]  But so if you hear any popping or buzzing or anything like that, it was caused by Al Qaeda gremlins.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.021]  I'm looking at one right now crawling around on the floor.
[01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.084]  No, seriously, let's get back to your phone calls.
[01:07:43.584 --> 01:07:45.125]  Let's go to Rodney in Texas.
[01:07:45.185 --> 01:07:45.945]  Rodney, go ahead.
[01:07:46.346 --> 01:07:48.046]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:07:48.126 --> 01:07:48.366]  Hi.
[01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:50.327]  I sure appreciate you taking my call.
[01:07:50.947 --> 01:07:57.690]  I wanted to briefly comment on a couple of points that Ray McGovern covered this morning on C-SPAN.
[01:07:59.191 --> 01:08:09.415]  The moderator, her name was Connie, and she did ask him about an article that appeared in the Baltimore Sun this morning regarding the Vice President's push
[01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:38.579]  on this torture and I found it rather interesting and his response was that he was highly trained in the military and interrogation and one of the first rules that he learned in interrogation is that torture, torturing an individual, any information that you would get out of an individual that way could not be trusted and you could tell by her reaction on the TV
[01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:45.207]  Well, that's the same thing that came up last Friday with Paul Craig Roberts, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
[01:08:58.914 --> 01:09:10.782]  And of course, editor at National Review and Wall Street Journal of all places saying the Bushes are worse than the Nazis, they're taking over, they're probably going to want to torture us, they may carry out terror attacks.
[01:09:10.802 --> 01:09:12.684]  I mean, that's Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:09:12.704 --> 01:09:16.506]  He's been on the show many times in the last year and never talked like that.
[01:09:16.847 --> 01:09:22.811]  People are really starting to get it across the board, and we know why they did this.
[01:09:23.639 --> 01:09:28.483]  We know why they have them bulldoze people's cars for no reason with tanks when they're caught with a piece of firewood.
[01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:32.647]  We know why they capture thousands of innocent people and torture them and then release them.
[01:09:34.006 --> 01:09:36.849]  It is to create hatred by the Arabs.
[01:09:36.869 --> 01:09:38.710]  I don't mean to interrupt, but I thought you were asking a question, Rodney.
[01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:39.151]  Go ahead.
[01:09:39.671 --> 01:09:42.134]  They want to generate hatred and anger.
[01:09:42.194 --> 01:09:49.200]  They want to demonize America internationally to then build up the supposed counter to the United States.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.981]  It's the same thing they did with the Soviet Union.
[01:09:51.242 --> 01:09:53.404]  They create these false enemies and play them up.
[01:09:53.844 --> 01:09:56.947]  Our own government is running propaganda, and they admit this.
[01:09:57.467 --> 01:10:04.270]  To make Europe and Asia and the Middle East hate us while domestically running propaganda that makes the public love it.
[01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:08.672]  And then internationally, it's meant to actually generate resistance.
[01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:09.492]  I'll say it again.
[01:10:10.053 --> 01:10:14.915]  Do the defense contractors make more money if we were in Iraq a year and fixed all the problems and left?
[01:10:15.475 --> 01:10:17.015]  Or if we're there a decade?
[01:10:17.976 --> 01:10:18.496]  A decade.
[01:10:18.516 --> 01:10:22.098]  If we're there long term, they make more money.
[01:10:22.558 --> 01:10:24.359]  So through failing, they win?
[01:10:24.379 --> 01:10:24.439]  Yes.
[01:10:26.103 --> 01:10:38.227]  So she also asked him about this czar that's over at the CIA and he immediately told her, the guy started off making all kinds of mistakes.
[01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:41.768]  He was referring to Porter Goss.
[01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:48.350]  I just thought that his interview this morning, just the little bit that I caught,
[01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.240]  It was very, very good.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.741]  So you didn't catch all of it?
[01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:57.586]  We've gotten calls on and off air and emails about it saying he talked about 9-11 or talked about government-sponsored terror.
[01:10:57.946 --> 01:11:04.131]  Because, you know, he said on the show a few weeks ago, he said, if there's a terrorist attack, don't look at Al-Qaeda first, look at our own government.
[01:11:04.372 --> 01:11:05.112]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:11:05.452 --> 01:11:17.042]  See, what he was saying actually was essentially the same things that he said on your show, but I've caught him in some other interviews on Air America and some other programs.
[01:11:17.526 --> 01:11:33.517]  But he also made a statement that was similar to Paul Craig Robertson, that he said, all your mid-level and high-level CIA people have been ran off, and that's similar to what Paul Craig Robertson was saying about true conservatives.
[01:11:33.597 --> 01:11:41.242]  Last Friday in his interview with you, he had made the statement, he says, I don't recognize any of the conservatives that are in the White House right now.
[01:11:42.455 --> 01:11:45.617]  So, it was a great interview and he brought out a lot of great points.
[01:11:46.078 --> 01:11:47.479]  I didn't catch the entire thing.
[01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:54.504]  Like I said, most of what he said I have heard on your show, but I thought I'd just call in.
[01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:59.247]  Real quickly, I want to ask you about a couple of articles I've seen at your website.
[01:11:59.507 --> 01:12:05.932]  I found very interesting the article on the stun guns.
[01:12:06.012 --> 01:12:11.296]  This is never going to go away, but there was a story about a situation that took place in Georgia.
[01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:20.532]  Where two guys were executed, and the statement by the police chief was, uh, well, we think stun guns are saving lives.
[01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:22.853]  How idiotic is that?
[01:12:22.873 --> 01:12:31.159]  I mean, all of these people are dying every day from, uh, stun guns, and this guy says it's actually saving lives.
[01:12:31.699 --> 01:12:32.500]  What do you think, Alex?
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.064]  Well, their argument is that they would shoot you with an actual firearm, with an actual bullet,
[01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:54.992]  If they didn't have the option of using the stun gun, and if the police were properly trained, and if they weren't trained to just point and shoot, then I think tasers would be fine.
[01:12:55.032 --> 01:13:04.840]  The problem is, is that actually it's increasing the number of police shootings the studies show, and it's increasing the number of deaths from the tasers themselves,
[01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:08.259]  Because it's training them to shoot.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.441]  It's like a training aid with an attack dog.
[01:13:13.002 --> 01:13:16.423]  You don't start out training them to actually kill somebody, you do it with dummies.
[01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:21.706]  And so all the riot gear, the rubber bullets, the bean bags,
[01:13:22.854 --> 01:13:25.675]  Well, they don't use them when it's a life-and-death situation.
[01:13:25.695 --> 01:13:26.875]  They use them for any reason.
[01:13:26.975 --> 01:13:28.195]  Oh, you talked back to me.
[01:13:28.615 --> 01:13:30.236]  Oh, you didn't get out of the car quick enough.
[01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:32.016]  Or, you asked me why.
[01:13:32.056 --> 01:13:33.317]  Well, I'm going to taser you now.
[01:13:33.337 --> 01:13:34.957]  I'm going to shoot you right in your pregnant belly.
[01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:40.938]  Or, I'm going to shoot this 95-year-old woman and I'm going to knock her prosthetic eye out of her head.
[01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:42.359]  You don't question me.
[01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:43.619]  Boy, I'm the official.
[01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:44.599]  I'm the authority.
[01:13:45.099 --> 01:13:48.000]  It's this arrogant attitude that's actually encouraged.
[01:13:48.852 --> 01:13:54.639]  And they do this point-and-shoot training with the police to, quote, switch off the thinking process, this instinctive shooting.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:05.971]  It's very, very dangerous because they will just instinctively pull and shoot just because they get an adrenaline rush or because a car backfires on the road driving past them.
[01:14:06.231 --> 01:14:10.476]  You know, they'll shoot the guy in handcuffs in the back three times and then the cops don't get in trouble.
[01:14:11.257 --> 01:14:19.870]  So clearly these are all training aides to train them to attack the public and to train the public to accept the images of us being attacked.
[01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.115]  Thanks for the call Rodney and I would also add this caveat to what I just said.
[01:14:24.697 --> 01:14:25.599]  These cop shows
[01:14:26.292 --> 01:14:30.037]  They're there to condition us to accept checkpoints, to accept people being pulled over.
[01:14:30.638 --> 01:14:32.000]  And it sells you the image.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.383]  You only see guilty people on these shows.
[01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.106]  You only see trash.
[01:14:36.486 --> 01:14:42.735]  Toothless, white trash, stumbling around, drunk, going... literally.
[01:14:43.659 --> 01:14:44.540]  We've all seen cops.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.261]  We've all seen stories of the highway patrol.
[01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.002]  We've all seen police chases.
[01:14:48.082 --> 01:14:49.983]  It's all scum.
[01:14:50.003 --> 01:14:53.065]  You know, whether it's gang members, scum from East L.A.
[01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:58.288]  or whether it's white trash literally stumbling around, wife beating trash.
[01:14:58.608 --> 01:14:59.388]  They go in the house.
[01:14:59.408 --> 01:15:01.049]  There's diapers all over the floor.
[01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:03.731]  This sells the image of the public.
[01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:08.601]  As that, in the police minds, in the people's minds, in everyone's minds.
[01:15:09.262 --> 01:15:24.714]  And then the cops are the serious professional guys with the short haircuts, the nice crisp uniforms, just trying to protect us, and just trying to... And we already have enough trouble with the police seeing the public as a bunch of criminals, as the police seeing us as perpetrators, or potential perpetrators.
[01:15:24.734 --> 01:15:29.078]  We already have enough trouble with them thinking that we're all out to get them, when that just isn't the truth.
[01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:34.525]  And you also see these cop shows filmed in New York or wherever, where there's gun bans.
[01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:36.446]  You got a gun, you're going down, boy!
[01:15:36.686 --> 01:15:40.489]  Well, people all over the country see that and think, my gosh, I've got a gun, I'm going down.
[01:15:40.789 --> 01:15:43.051]  It creates the perception that guns are illegal.
[01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:55.099]  Because people watch shows produced in Chicago or New York or Detroit, and then the carpet cleaner's in your house and sees a gun case of guns and says, are those legal?
[01:15:55.743 --> 01:15:58.664]  And then runs outside to call the police, and you're like, you're a fool!
[01:15:59.144 --> 01:16:01.465]  This is what it's come to.
[01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:05.627]  It's just people are not consciously watching television.
[01:16:05.647 --> 01:16:08.048]  They're not consciously looking at the propaganda.
[01:16:09.768 --> 01:16:11.189]  And I just feel sorry for the police.
[01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:15.451]  I mean, the system that's being put in that's raping the people is going to rape them just as much or more.
[01:16:16.351 --> 01:16:20.512]  They're going to be asked to do all these horrible things, and no amount of propaganda is going to make it okay again.
[01:16:21.573 --> 01:16:23.414]  There's not going to be any salve here, folks.
[01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:24.274]  It's just going to get worse.
[01:16:25.943 --> 01:16:28.744]  And the good news is most special forces are waking up.
[01:16:29.044 --> 01:16:31.325]  The good news is most CIA people are waking up.
[01:16:31.585 --> 01:16:35.146]  The good news is a lot of FBI's waking up and they're quitting or they're being run out.
[01:16:35.406 --> 01:16:37.087]  There have been purges under Clinton.
[01:16:37.367 --> 01:16:38.448]  Purges under Bush.
[01:16:38.968 --> 01:16:40.428]  And they're putting their people in.
[01:16:40.448 --> 01:16:44.870]  But the good news is their people are a bunch of crook dilettantes who don't really want to work that hard.
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:53.913]  And they're busy off with their mistresses or off with their boyfriends and they're busy off at the Swiss Alps on their skiing vacations and they're giving orders now and people just aren't following them.
[01:16:55.675 --> 01:16:56.416]  It's like Hitler.
[01:16:56.476 --> 01:17:03.302]  I mean, he had all these people going along with him for so long until people really started starting to see what was really happening.
[01:17:03.822 --> 01:17:06.465]  And then a lot of his biggest supporters were trying to get him.
[01:17:07.966 --> 01:17:11.589]  And what we've got to realize, though, with Hitler, he was actually running things.
[01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:13.611]  With Bush, he's not running anything.
[01:17:13.831 --> 01:17:14.612]  He's a puppet.
[01:17:15.292 --> 01:17:16.153]  He's like a front man.
[01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:20.077]  It's like when the mafia owns a business and they're using it to launder money.
[01:17:20.097 --> 01:17:22.259]  They'll have some guy in the front office who's supposedly the CEO.
[01:17:23.422 --> 01:17:27.086]  Okay, but really, uh, you know, Mr. Carloni has called.
[01:17:27.126 --> 01:17:29.208]  He's got a message for you, so do it.
[01:17:29.769 --> 01:17:32.712]  You know, we gotta bring the stuff around back there.
[01:17:33.213 --> 01:17:35.776]  I mean, that's who's really running things, okay?
[01:17:36.336 --> 01:17:37.137]  It's that simple.
[01:17:38.378 --> 01:17:38.759]  Alright.
[01:17:40.242 --> 01:17:45.467]  Let's go ahead and, I mean going back to the old western town, I won't just pick on the Yanks up north.
[01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:59.862]  The old western town, you'd have some corrupt sheriff who really worked for the local mine owner and the sheriff had his ten thugs and anybody that didn't put up with the mine owner stealing people's property or pushing people around or maybe the mine owner's son wanting somebody's daughter.
[01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:04.633]  So, you know, his son beats up Billy Bob's son because he was a boyfriend with her.
[01:18:04.653 --> 01:18:09.497]  And then, finally, the town just gets mad and there's a big shootout with the sheriff and his men!
[01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:10.898]  And they run them out of town!
[01:18:12.399 --> 01:18:13.600]  The four or five that make it out.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.580]  The rest get gunned down.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.282]  I mean, there were hundreds of cases of that in the Old West.
[01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:19.184]  Finally, either a town would die.
[01:18:19.204 --> 01:18:20.464]  It'd be called a bad town.
[01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:23.146]  The parasites kept feeding and feeding and feeding.
[01:18:23.186 --> 01:18:24.968]  Certain people just move out.
[01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.351]  Or, in other cases, they would run them out.
[01:18:29.989 --> 01:18:31.330]  And it would go back to being a good town.
[01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:37.694]  Or, in some cases, there were so many resources in the town that people would stay and put up with it.
[01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:45.039]  And that's a Chicago, that's a Houston, that's a... And people just... I mean, a lot of these towns have been corrupt since there were a hundred people in them.
[01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:46.520]  You understand that, folks?
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.662]  And it just passed from one fat mafia don to the next.
[01:18:50.962 --> 01:18:51.483]  I'm sick of it.
[01:18:55.715 --> 01:18:57.381]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.004 --> 01:18:59.750]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.925 --> 01:19:08.793]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.034 --> 01:19:11.676]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:55.510]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:55.930 --> 01:21:01.411]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:01.971 --> 01:21:05.432]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:06.472 --> 01:21:12.553]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:13.115 --> 01:21:20.821]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:26.104]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:26.745 --> 01:21:29.747]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:32.529 --> 01:21:36.674]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:52.800]  I'm good.

[01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:59.646]  Coming up, the White House memo.
[01:23:00.106 --> 01:23:02.648]  Terrorism would be such a big help for us right now.
[01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:04.530]  Sure hope Al Qaeda attacks.
[01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:05.431]  Wink wink.
[01:23:05.871 --> 01:23:07.292]  I'll get that done, Commander.
[01:23:08.253 --> 01:23:10.195]  So that's coming up right now.
[01:23:11.158 --> 01:23:12.658]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:23:12.838 --> 01:23:16.419]  Charles in Louisiana, then J.J., James, Jeff and others.
[01:23:16.439 --> 01:23:17.119]  A lot of J's.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.360]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Charles.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.600]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:21.200]  Good, my friend.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.881]  I just wanted you to tell me to call back.
[01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:24.201]  That's right.
[01:23:24.361 --> 01:23:26.362]  You got cut short last week when we had a guest on.
[01:23:26.522 --> 01:23:26.842]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:27.182 --> 01:23:28.322]  I want to tell you what's happening.
[01:23:29.402 --> 01:23:36.504]  In New Orleans, there's bodies of God with soldiers that nobody, they won't let nobody look at.
[01:23:37.074 --> 01:23:38.694]  I figure that's the ones the police shot.
[01:23:39.334 --> 01:23:49.877]  Oh, yeah, there are a bunch of different mainstream AP articles, Times, Picayune, about there's all these houses with dead bodies and they won't let anyone get in and get them and they won't bring them out.
[01:23:50.397 --> 01:23:53.377]  And then now they're trying to bring trucks in to sneak off with them.
[01:23:53.757 --> 01:24:02.119]  And, you know, I thought that last week and it's something I never mentioned on air because so much of what I put in the stack I never cover because I'm a long-winded, horrid creature.
[01:24:02.739 --> 01:24:03.799]  And you brought it up.
[01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:06.820]  Well, they admit that there was just endless machine gunning going on.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.561]  Well, I got the number.
[01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:09.601]  I got the actual number.
[01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:11.222]  It's a little over 1,600.
[01:24:11.862 --> 01:24:13.924]  That's not including the ones that drowned.
[01:24:14.604 --> 01:24:15.844]  These were guarded with soldiers.
[01:24:16.005 --> 01:24:16.745]  Oh, I would imagine.
[01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:19.927]  They probably killed 500 of them.
[01:24:20.207 --> 01:24:28.611]  Okay, now, there's a rumor with the police that the levees had to be blown to relieve the pressure off of New Orleans.
[01:24:29.349 --> 01:24:32.191]  There's rumors within the police department.
[01:24:32.251 --> 01:24:35.774]  That's like saying blow a dam to stop it from hitting your house right below it.
[01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:38.256]  I mean, if you blow it anywhere, it floods the whole area.
[01:24:38.276 --> 01:24:38.957]  It's ridiculous.
[01:24:39.077 --> 01:24:42.319]  Well, I've been passing the tapes out in the medical department.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:47.684]  Now, in New Orleans, all the foreigners, they got all Mexicans down there.
[01:24:47.984 --> 01:24:48.725]  Now listen to this.
[01:24:49.165 --> 01:24:53.188]  They all in City Park, they're charging $300 for a tent.
[01:24:53.769 --> 01:24:55.150]  Just to put a small tent there.
[01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:55.150]  $300.
[01:24:56.371 --> 01:24:56.671]  Who is?
[01:24:56.711 --> 01:24:57.051]  The city.
[01:25:00.991 --> 01:25:04.734]  So they're literally ripping everyone off and feeding on the displacement?
[01:25:04.774 --> 01:25:05.514]  Yes sir.
[01:25:06.595 --> 01:25:10.358]  Now, I'm telling you Mr. Jones, you don't have time for me to tell you what's going on.
[01:25:10.378 --> 01:25:19.986]  Well Paul Craig Roberts, former Reagan administration public servant, not official public servant, he said, and I've seen it in the press, but he was really mad about that.
[01:25:20.066 --> 01:25:23.449]  Bush promised all the contracts for people that live in Mississippi, Louisiana.
[01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:31.274]  The locals are almost getting nothing, and then they're literally bringing in illegal aliens to do the work, and then even ripping them off and not paying them.
[01:25:31.374 --> 01:25:32.775]  Yes, now listen to this.
[01:25:32.855 --> 01:25:37.799]  All the people that bought the homes, they want to charge them taxes on the homes like the homes were still there.
[01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:41.482]  They don't have no house there, but they still want to charge them the original tax.
[01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:45.504]  Well, see that's how they're going to rip them off and then claim they own the property because you didn't pay the back tax.
[01:25:45.605 --> 01:25:47.426]  Yes, because they don't have the money to pay the taxes.
[01:25:47.506 --> 01:25:48.647]  I saw that too, Charles.
[01:25:48.687 --> 01:25:51.389]  This is now the mass raping will begin.
[01:25:52.049 --> 01:25:53.850]  Now, let me tell you what's happening up here.
[01:25:54.811 --> 01:25:55.712]  Uh, I'll give you an example.
[01:25:55.732 --> 01:25:57.653]  My wife went to buy a wig for her mother.
[01:25:57.673 --> 01:25:58.514]  Her mother's up there.
[01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:02.037]  They threw rocks in the window and broke the window like it hit my mother-in-law and wife.
[01:26:02.097 --> 01:26:04.498]  New Orleans, they're causing racial tension.
[01:26:05.139 --> 01:26:05.959]  They're selling guns.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.342]  You can't even buy a gun down here, but you have to order a gun.
[01:26:10.343 --> 01:26:12.524]  And shells are very hard to get right now.
[01:26:12.925 --> 01:26:18.589]  Walmart, only one Walmart selling them out of all the Walmarts across Louisiana here.
[01:26:19.604 --> 01:26:22.165]  They're trying to destroy us within.
[01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:23.525]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:26:23.585 --> 01:26:29.506]  There have been something like 800 and something, it was 600 months ago, the new number is 800 dead on the U.S.
[01:26:30.466 --> 01:26:32.727]  Mexico side in the Texas sector.
[01:26:33.707 --> 01:26:41.689]  And rocket attacks, mass murder, 2,000 troops, it's more than that, but the government says 2,100 and something troops have died in Iraq.
[01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:53.379]  I mean, in one year in Texas, it's approaching 1,000 in this war zone, but because they decide to not tell us about it on the news, it supposedly doesn't exist.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.323]  And yes, I know it's the same thing there in the Louisiana area.
[01:26:57.363 --> 01:27:01.086]  You guys are just one step above what's been happening in France.
[01:27:01.386 --> 01:27:01.687]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:01.747 --> 01:27:02.207]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:27:02.728 --> 01:27:03.488]  It's very bad.
[01:27:03.608 --> 01:27:05.190]  It's really terrible.
[01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:09.874]  Uh, they just shut the mall down with two guys with AK-47s they found in a car.
[01:27:10.134 --> 01:27:11.915]  Sitting in a car with the AK-47s.
[01:27:12.175 --> 01:27:13.436]  They shut the whole mall down.
[01:27:14.137 --> 01:27:15.058]  Uh, Mr. Jones, you know what?
[01:27:15.098 --> 01:27:17.059]  I wish I could talk to you over there and prove some of this stuff.
[01:27:17.359 --> 01:27:19.001]  I got a guy that rides a limousine.
[01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:20.402]  He's got a limousine service.
[01:27:20.422 --> 01:27:23.004]  He's been getting a lot of information going back and forth New Orleans.
[01:27:23.584 --> 01:27:24.185]  But there's 1,600 bodies.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:43.154]  That is a prime article that we should write and write right now because we have the news articles about how they won't let people in to get the bodies and they guard them and act all suspicious and a lot of these are in high and dry areas.
[01:27:43.855 --> 01:27:45.256]  We know they did shoot people.
[01:27:46.778 --> 01:27:49.000]  And then I said we'd find out later how many they killed.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.101]  I guess they won't let us know.
[01:27:50.381 --> 01:27:51.062]  Oh no, no sir.
[01:27:51.262 --> 01:27:57.969]  But the other thing is, if somebody was to come out, this comes from the police department at the hospitals, come out and get a little excited, they would just shoot them.
[01:27:58.209 --> 01:27:59.310]  They wouldn't take no chances.
[01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:02.093]  They would shoot, they had their own discretion to shoot.
[01:28:02.373 --> 01:28:03.455]  Now that comes from the police.
[01:28:04.335 --> 01:28:04.596]  You know?
[01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.918]  Their own discretion to shoot who?
[01:28:06.978 --> 01:28:09.721]  Anybody that come out to give them any kind of trouble whatsoever.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.061]  They're on the Ninth Ward.
[01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:16.444]  They didn't go into the Ninth Ward, but around there, people were excited and trying to, you know, get their cars open.
[01:28:16.464 --> 01:28:22.128]  No, I remember when in the images of police handing machine guns at people who were trying to walk out, saying, no, you can't walk out.
[01:28:22.488 --> 01:28:23.128]  Right, that's right.
[01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:24.589]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:27.111]  And they threatened them and said, if you don't leave, we're going to shoot you.
[01:28:27.391 --> 01:28:31.714]  That's how they, uh, but, uh, Mr. Jones, it's, you just don't have the, it's crazy.
[01:28:31.814 --> 01:28:32.735]  It's crazy down here.
[01:28:33.135 --> 01:28:34.496]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[01:28:34.516 --> 01:28:35.217]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:35.337 --> 01:28:36.678]  I mean, look, it's the order of the day.
[01:28:36.738 --> 01:28:39.700]  This country is collapsing by design.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:40.861]  It's collapsing.
[01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:46.577]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.499 --> 01:28:50.185]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.773 --> 01:28:56.355]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:58.236]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:58.677 --> 01:29:01.380]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.483]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:11.389]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:29:32.228 --> 01:29:33.649]  I never voted for a war cologne.
[01:29:33.829 --> 01:29:34.189]  Have you?
[01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.271]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:39.754]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:29:44.918 --> 01:29:45.980]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.722]  Osama Bin Forgotten?

[01:29:53.809 --> 01:29:55.410]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:59.674]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.814 --> 01:30:02.676]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.776 --> 01:30:09.481]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.662 --> 01:30:12.684]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.884 --> 01:30:15.266]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.406 --> 01:30:17.608]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[01:30:17.708 --> 01:30:18.268]  We're good to go!
[01:30:44.616 --> 01:30:45.037]  803-4438.
[01:30:45.097 --> 01:30:45.478]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.558 --> 01:30:47.843]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:30:54.972 --> 01:31:00.297]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:00.597 --> 01:31:05.902]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:31:06.302 --> 01:31:09.305]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:32:09.386 --> 01:32:15.248]  Alright, I want to cover some of the top news stories, and then we're going to go straight back to your phone calls.
[01:32:15.308 --> 01:32:19.970]  Some of the people that are patiently holding, like JJ, James, Jeff, and many others.
[01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:26.592]  Again, this broadcast comes to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:32:27.152 --> 01:32:27.953]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:28.353 --> 01:32:32.334]  Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:32:32.374 --> 01:32:34.075]  The websites are InfoWars.com,
[01:32:35.095 --> 01:32:39.476]  Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:39.997 --> 01:32:51.040]  And coming up in a few minutes I have in studio with me Paul Watson and his brother Steve Watson all the way over here from Sheffield and London respectively.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:33:04.484]  And we're going to be going through the White House openly talking about how torture is good and they're going to keep torture because it keeps us safe from Al-Qaeda, I mean Al-Qaeda.
[01:33:05.017 --> 01:33:09.060]  I think I've overworn that little joke, but it's okay, we're going to continue to do it.
[01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:14.985]  Because it makes the point, and it's not really a joke at certain levels, it's the reality of what's happening.
[01:33:15.245 --> 01:33:30.298]  We also have a White House that has been passing around high-level memos with Republican leadership about how wonderful and wondrous a terrorist attack would be to get their entire agenda back on line.
[01:33:32.503 --> 01:33:39.273]  Now, before we go to my two guests, last hour I mentioned my documentary films, but I didn't tell you how to get them.
[01:33:39.794 --> 01:33:45.042]  And only until the end of this year, the next month and a half roughly,
[01:33:46.613 --> 01:33:54.564]  Well, we have these discounts available, and we're talking about as low as $5.95 per film when you get multiple copies.
[01:33:54.584 --> 01:34:03.796]  We're talking about all three of my DVDs, my best DVDs, American Dictators, Martial Law, and 9-11 Road to Tyranny, for only.
[01:34:05.371 --> 01:34:07.432]  $44.95, that's over a $30 discount.
[01:34:07.953 --> 01:34:11.296]  We have discounts on all the books and videos we carry.
[01:34:11.316 --> 01:34:14.859]  We're carrying a lot of new books and a lot of new films.
[01:34:14.879 --> 01:34:22.006]  We're really expanding what we offer at the book and video store online at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:22.026 --> 01:34:30.594]  So go to the Secure Online Shopping Cart, watch clips of the films, read about the films, order them via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart, and know that your support
[01:34:31.656 --> 01:34:34.698]  100% goes to this fight.
[01:34:34.718 --> 01:34:36.899]  100% goes to the fight against the New World Order.
[01:34:37.279 --> 01:34:39.800]  Goes to resisting the globalists.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.341]  We understand their paradigm.
[01:34:41.981 --> 01:34:43.782]  We know how to defeat the New World Order.
[01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:51.180]  And that starts with you getting involved and exposing who's behind the terror and who was behind problem, reaction, solution.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:35:05.104]  That is the foundational dogma and the foundational philosophy of our entire society and the criminally insane, sadistic, Malthusian, social Darwinistic elite that is in control.
[01:35:05.344 --> 01:35:08.525]  So I want you to get the videos right now.
[01:35:08.645 --> 01:35:11.766]  Get them and make copies and literally envision
[01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.147]  We're good to go.
[01:35:39.358 --> 01:35:42.540]  Can defeat this new world order with God's help if you get involved.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.402]  So here's the toll free number to get the films as well.
[01:35:44.422 --> 01:35:55.170]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 Now, in studio I have my good buddies and also the fellows that write a lot of the articles and do the daily updates and try to read and respond to all your email.
[01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:57.251]  I have Paul Watson and I have
[01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:09.608]  I have Steve Watson with us.
[01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:12.810]  Respectively, they are known as the Waddy Watt Clan.
[01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:17.611]  The Watsons are, of course, Scotties.
[01:36:17.651 --> 01:36:19.512]  That's the tribe that the Scots come from.
[01:36:19.952 --> 01:36:24.754]  So we have two wild Scotties in the studio with us today.
[01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:27.530]  And Paul is on video right now.
[01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:28.850]  We're putting this on the TV show.
[01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:30.530]  He's very sneaky looking.
[01:36:31.251 --> 01:36:33.491]  And I'm just having some fun with you guys.
[01:36:34.011 --> 01:36:36.612]  I didn't have time to set up another microphone, so you guys have to share that microphone.
[01:36:36.672 --> 01:36:37.112]  It's pretty good.
[01:36:37.132 --> 01:36:38.753]  Just make sure you get close to it.
[01:36:39.013 --> 01:36:39.853]  Don't be scared of it.
[01:36:39.893 --> 01:36:41.293]  It's like a pretty girl.
[01:36:41.333 --> 01:36:43.134]  You can even give the microphone a kiss if you want.
[01:36:43.154 --> 01:36:45.774]  Alright, enough of my attempts at humor.
[01:36:47.055 --> 01:36:47.875]  It's not a snake.
[01:36:47.915 --> 01:36:48.815]  It's not a cobra.
[01:36:48.835 --> 01:36:50.076]  It's not an al-Qaeda.
[01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:51.316]  It's not going to get you.
[01:36:52.266 --> 01:36:54.668]  But I'll be serious now.
[01:36:54.888 --> 01:36:56.009]  Let's shift gears and get into this.
[01:36:56.049 --> 01:36:57.871]  Gentlemen, thanks for joining us here in studio.
[01:36:57.891 --> 01:36:59.412]  Good to be on the air, Alex.
[01:37:02.586 --> 01:37:03.506]  Let's start over again.
[01:37:03.627 --> 01:37:04.967]  Good to have you here with us, gentlemen.
[01:37:05.007 --> 01:37:06.088]  I didn't have your microphone on.
[01:37:06.528 --> 01:37:07.548]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:37:07.909 --> 01:37:08.489]  Hello, Alex.
[01:37:08.749 --> 01:37:09.249]  Nice to be here.
[01:37:09.369 --> 01:37:10.710]  It's good to have you guys here with us.
[01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:12.291]  So much has happened.
[01:37:12.331 --> 01:37:15.572]  I mean, the day you guys flew over here, Friday, so much news broke.
[01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:19.634]  We have this professor of physics coming out and saying he's looked at all the evidence.
[01:37:19.714 --> 01:37:21.275]  Clearly, only bombs could do this.
[01:37:21.695 --> 01:37:22.835]  There's a total cover-up.
[01:37:22.855 --> 01:37:28.298]  We have the White House memo that they just really want some wonderful terrorist attacks.
[01:37:32.399 --> 01:37:50.925]  Well, the first thing I noticed after arriving in Texas, the big story, and I believe it's still the big story, is the hotel bombing in Jordan, which is now being used on the media as a justification to stay in Iraq by connecting terror to Iraq.
[01:37:51.645 --> 01:37:57.627]  And we've posted the images on PrisonPlanet.com of the result of the bombing, the aftermath,
[01:37:58.234 --> 01:38:07.566]  And it shows basically that, um, the ceiling was bombed as if the bombers had crawled in the rafters of the roof and detonated the bombs from there.
[01:38:08.207 --> 01:38:16.398]  Which is interesting because, um, the initial story was that, that the ceiling had been blown out, but then it was changed to suicide bombers.
[01:38:17.179 --> 01:38:34.507]  And then we have this media showcase of this female suicide bomber with the bomb still strapped to her chest being paraded and then being linked by family to al-Zarqawi, therefore providing the Iraq connection that justifies continued presence in Iraq.
[01:38:35.047 --> 01:38:38.890]  This is just amazingly obvious and glaring.
[01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:42.912]  I mean, we've caught them dead to rights in England on 7-7 and 7-21.
[01:38:43.753 --> 01:38:45.694]  Red-handed, that's a government operation.
[01:38:46.034 --> 01:38:53.699]  That's an encyclopedia of information that we've covered here many times and have that archived on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:53.939 --> 01:38:57.921]  But right at the key time this happens, then no one was buying the official story.
[01:38:57.941 --> 01:38:59.702]  It's like bombs under the trains.
[01:38:59.722 --> 01:39:01.804]  We're hearing bombs in the ceiling.
[01:39:02.684 --> 01:39:03.485]  Israel admits.
[01:39:04.265 --> 01:39:06.948]  Haratz reported that they were warned and did evacuate.
[01:39:07.228 --> 01:39:10.551]  Just like in the Bali bombing, the FBI was there and evacuated.
[01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:12.032]  It's just always magical.
[01:39:12.793 --> 01:39:17.937]  And we had Benjamin Netanyahu getting a warning on 7-7 not to leave.
[01:39:18.477 --> 01:39:19.899]  And that was never retracted.
[01:39:19.999 --> 01:39:25.603]  And then the head of Mossad confirmed that they did give Netanyahu a warning.
[01:39:26.024 --> 01:39:29.687]  So just over and over again, it's just so convenient for the establishment.
[01:39:31.269 --> 01:39:56.256]  Well, yeah, I mean, the actual physical evidence at the site of the bombing, in the case of this hotel bombing in Jordan, dovetails with what happened in London, because we have two separate credible eyewitnesses, one a Guardian journalist, saying that two separate sites in London on the day of 7-7, the bombs actually came up from underneath the train, and the eyewitnesses don't report any guys with large backpacks.
[01:39:56.836 --> 01:40:03.742]  So you've got a similar situation in Jordan where the actual physical evidence doesn't jibe with the official story.
[01:40:03.982 --> 01:40:07.224]  Then we have the Bali bomber, supposedly.
[01:40:07.765 --> 01:40:08.806]  They never went to trial.
[01:40:08.826 --> 01:40:09.867]  They never had any evidence.
[01:40:09.887 --> 01:40:10.967]  They just say it's him.
[01:40:11.308 --> 01:40:15.971]  The police surround the building, they say, and then the building blows up.
[01:40:16.272 --> 01:40:17.733]  Well, that happened in Madrid.
[01:40:18.353 --> 01:40:22.817]  Kurt Nemo wrote an article where he just listed example after example after example after example.
[01:40:23.658 --> 01:40:37.171]  Well, yeah, I mean, in the case of Bali, we had the articles, it was back in October 2002, where the Taiwanese government were warned by the U.S.
[01:40:37.211 --> 01:40:39.293]  government, but that warning wasn't passed on.
[01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:45.920]  You had top officials from the different embassies pull out of the area in the days and hours before.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.702]  And then the actual bombing itself didn't jibe again with the physical evidence on the ground.
[01:40:51.722 --> 01:40:58.886]  You had Australian, British, CIA swooping immediately after to clean up the scene, literally hours after the bombing.
[01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:02.967]  And the reason we bring this up is they've been caught over and over and over again.
[01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:04.288]  It's been declassified.
[01:41:05.327 --> 01:41:06.548]  We're good to go!
[01:41:35.368 --> 01:41:38.010]  That really gets the public to go along with our aims.
[01:41:39.251 --> 01:41:48.620]  Steve Watson, you've been doing this almost as long as your brother has, and you also, of course, went and studied politics and political science and got a master's degree in it.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:55.046]  Why don't you give us your take on the whole state of affairs concerning government-sponsored terrorism?
[01:41:56.487 --> 01:42:00.070]  Well, if we go back to, say, let's go back to the Madrid bombings, firstly.
[01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:15.100]  I mean, these people that get cornered and tend to conveniently blow themselves up continually, over and over again, always seem to have shady links with either security services or government agencies.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:21.825]  Um, in Dreadbomb, as it turned out, we're connected to the Spanish, uh, secret security services.
[01:42:21.845 --> 01:42:27.149]  Um, the London bombers, the mastermind of the London bombings was, as we know, um,
[01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:32.192]  This Aswap character who was working for MI6 previously.
[01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:35.895]  I mean, it's just the same.
[01:42:36.475 --> 01:42:38.436]  It's the same operation over and over again.
[01:42:38.496 --> 01:42:42.098]  These people are always connected to the inside sources here.
[01:42:42.378 --> 01:42:44.459]  And then we have official documents like Northwoods.
[01:42:44.479 --> 01:42:51.563]  Why don't you tell the viewers on television and the radio listeners, Steve, how Northwoods ties into all of this?
[01:42:52.824 --> 01:42:56.806]  Well, I mean, let's say the memo that's just been leaked about how
[01:42:58.450 --> 01:43:00.130]  Terror attacks would be helpful.
[01:43:01.131 --> 01:43:03.611]  It's very reminiscent of Project Northwood.
[01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:08.153]  If I just read a quote... Yeah, read some of the quotes for me.
[01:43:08.193 --> 01:43:13.174]  It says, basically, Bush would be able to unite the country in a time of national shock and sorrow.
[01:43:13.974 --> 01:43:16.735]  Americans would band together in a time of crisis.
[01:43:17.455 --> 01:43:24.837]  Very reminiscent of the text in Northwood which states terror casualties would cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[01:43:25.746 --> 01:43:27.867]  Um, it's basically, it's just the same.
[01:43:27.887 --> 01:43:29.487]  We see these coming out over and over again.
[01:43:29.507 --> 01:43:37.809]  We saw it in the PNAC documents, uh, where Dick Cheney and others, um, said that a new Pearl Harbor would be helpful for them.
[01:43:38.349 --> 01:43:42.150]  Uh, we saw it at Gulf of Tonkin, which we know now is a staged event.
[01:43:43.051 --> 01:43:52.633]  Um, incidentally, Project Northwoods, I was looking in Bookshop, uh, about a month ago, and there's a book, a new book out, an encyclopedia of conspiracy theories.
[01:43:53.568 --> 01:44:00.512]  Um, basically a lot of mumbo-jumbo about aliens and things like that and in between all this they throw in Project Northwoods.
[01:44:01.192 --> 01:44:06.856]  Now Project Northwoods is not a conspiracy theory, it's a declassified US government document.
[01:44:07.756 --> 01:44:16.361]  Um, it's just over and over again these things come up and up and we just continue to cover them and it's the same thing over and over.
[01:44:16.781 --> 01:44:21.404]  Well we knew back in 64 when Galvatron could happen, it was in the San Diego Tribune.
[01:44:22.228 --> 01:44:26.051]  People got off the ships and said we were there attacking them and they were smart enough not to shoot back.
[01:44:26.932 --> 01:44:42.085]  I mean our government sent in attack boats and was attacking the Vietnamese communists and they were, and I'm not defending them folks, I don't agree with their ideology, but the point is this is wrong what our government did and then when they didn't shoot back because they planned to start the war right there, they just announced and they attacked our
[01:44:43.105 --> 01:44:52.091]  Our aircraft carriers and they were vicious and hateful and we were just trying to give them, you know daisies because we love them So we knew back then and then two years ago.
[01:44:52.111 --> 01:44:58.916]  We got the LBJ tapes released from right here in Austin I mean his library released him where he's on the phone with McNamara.
[01:44:59.216 --> 01:45:03.499]  No, I didn't happen So we need to tell them and didn't get the war on this.
[01:45:03.599 --> 01:45:05.480]  It's been very useful McNamara.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:06.081]  That's good.
[01:45:06.101 --> 01:45:06.841]  Mr. President.
[01:45:07.081 --> 01:45:12.345]  Yes, the press is starting to get onto this We've got a release get this out to them and get the story straight with all our people are and I'll take care of it
[01:45:13.166 --> 01:45:16.074]  So our ships were in there attacking them, and that was the plan all along.
[01:45:16.635 --> 01:45:18.179]  Yes, Mr. President, that's the plan all along.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:18.840]  So...
[01:45:19.762 --> 01:45:20.883]  This is what they do.
[01:45:21.604 --> 01:45:22.464]  USS Liberty.
[01:45:22.845 --> 01:45:23.425]  Same story.
[01:45:23.465 --> 01:45:27.989]  Let me read our comments on the Capitol Hill Blues story, and then I want to get into the article itself.
[01:45:28.049 --> 01:45:32.093]  GOP memo touts new terror attack as way to reverse party's decline.
[01:45:32.113 --> 01:45:42.321]  And our comment is, this document adds to the mountainous pile of smoking gun evidence of government complicity and staged terror attacks and other false flag operations.
[01:45:42.421 --> 01:45:45.604]  It has now been declassified, as we already knew.
[01:45:46.064 --> 01:45:47.986]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[01:45:48.426 --> 01:45:50.168]  It was staged to get us into Vietnam.
[01:45:50.208 --> 01:45:52.189]  Operation Northwoods was the official U.S.
[01:45:52.209 --> 01:45:57.874]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks against the American people and blame it on foreign enemies as a pretext for war.
[01:45:59.075 --> 01:46:07.302]  Read below as the government leaders salivate over how wonderful a devastating terror attack would be against the American people for their policies.
[01:46:07.583 --> 01:46:09.684]  It would force us to accept total enslavement.
[01:46:10.245 --> 01:46:12.487]  It goes on to talk about how sorrow and pain
[01:46:13.835 --> 01:46:14.195]  I think so.
[01:46:23.883 --> 01:46:34.671]  publicly published PNAC documents before 9-11 and saliva stains all over them as Dick Cheney and others talked about how a helpful Pearl Harbor attack would be for their agenda.
[01:46:35.072 --> 01:46:48.262]  PrisonPlanet.com recently interviewed conservative leader Paul Craig Roberts and he stated that we're in a real danger of the Bush administration staging terror attacks to defibrillate, that is jumpstart their heart, their agenda.
[01:46:49.218 --> 01:46:56.482]  And now here's the actual news article, GOP memo touts a new terror attack as a way to reverse party's decline.
[01:46:56.823 --> 01:47:02.826]  A confidential memo circulating among senior Republican leaders suggested that a new attack by terrorists on U.S.
[01:47:02.846 --> 01:47:12.152]  soil could reverse the sagging fortunes of President George W. Bush, as well as the GOP, and restore his image as a leader of the American people.
[01:47:13.084 --> 01:47:16.506]  See, oh, if we attack them, they'll ask us to save them.
[01:47:16.966 --> 01:47:17.847]  So sick.
[01:47:17.867 --> 01:47:21.008]  It's like a serial killer comes and rapes you and stabs you five times.
[01:47:21.028 --> 01:47:23.490]  Then he walks out of the room, pulls the rubber mask off.
[01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:26.131]  He walks in wearing the same clothes with your bloodstains on it.
[01:47:26.691 --> 01:47:28.212]  And you go, oh, you saved me.
[01:47:28.592 --> 01:47:31.694]  Oh, I want to marry you.
[01:47:31.714 --> 01:47:33.495]  Oh, I mean, it is sick, folks.
[01:47:35.585 --> 01:47:36.365]  Ugh, so sick.
[01:47:36.565 --> 01:47:52.689]  Continuing, the closely guarded memo lays out a list of scenarios to bring the Republican Party back from the political brink, including a devastating attack by terrorists that could validate the President's war on terror and allow Bush to unite the country in a time of national shock and sorrow.
[01:47:52.889 --> 01:47:59.611]  The memo says such a reversal in the President's fortunes could keep the party from losing control of Congress in six midterm elections.
[01:47:59.631 --> 01:48:00.451]  GOP insiders
[01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:08.575]  Who have seen the memo, admit it's a risky strategy, and point out that such scenarios are blue sky thinking that often occurs in political planning sessions.
[01:48:09.495 --> 01:48:13.517]  And the President's popularity was at all time highs following the 9-11 attacks.
[01:48:13.797 --> 01:48:14.957]  Yeah, like 90%.
[01:48:15.458 --> 01:48:17.759]  Americans band together in a time of crisis.
[01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:22.661]  And it goes into talking about how if we have sorrow, if we have pain,
[01:48:24.282 --> 01:48:25.683]  It can be directed.
[01:48:26.103 --> 01:48:36.306]  The memo outlines other scenarios, including the capture of Osama bin al-Syed al-Aden, a drastic turnaround in the economy, a successful resolution of the Iraq war.
[01:48:36.946 --> 01:48:42.508]  And the GOP memo no longer talks of victory in Iraq, but the use of the term successful resolution.
[01:48:43.311 --> 01:48:49.535]  And he goes on to talk about sorrow and our pain and how to direct it and how to control it and how to do all this.
[01:48:49.935 --> 01:48:54.338]  And Capitol Hill Blue, time and time again, they report on stuff that then later comes out in mainstream news.
[01:48:54.618 --> 01:48:55.519]  They have the sources.
[01:48:56.099 --> 01:49:02.243]  They first reported about Bush throwing fits and screaming at 18-year-old staffers and running around foaming at the mouth and convulsing.
[01:49:02.663 --> 01:49:04.084]  And now that's in New York Daily News.
[01:49:04.124 --> 01:49:06.504]  I mean, with Bill Clinton, they broke so much.
[01:49:06.544 --> 01:49:09.025]  They've really got sources deep inside.
[01:49:10.486 --> 01:49:12.187]  But I don't need this document.
[01:49:12.307 --> 01:49:14.287]  I don't need this article about a memo.
[01:49:14.687 --> 01:49:17.708]  We have PNAC, where they say it even more clearly.
[01:49:19.029 --> 01:49:19.909]  Comments on that, Steve?
[01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:22.290]  And hog that microphone for me.
[01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:22.770]  Get up there.
[01:49:23.431 --> 01:49:24.151]  Take that hill.
[01:49:24.211 --> 01:49:25.131]  Attack that microphone.
[01:49:25.151 --> 01:49:26.011]  I tell you what, we're going to break.
[01:49:26.592 --> 01:49:27.252]  We're going to come back.
[01:49:29.085 --> 01:49:31.728]  And, uh, in studio we have Ryan Slickheisen.
[01:49:31.768 --> 01:49:33.249]  Maybe we'll get him on the microphone later.
[01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:48.224]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, as, uh, the clan of the Watties rides shotgun, and, uh, we have the Slickheisen in here with us as well, and I am... I'm Jones, your host.
[01:49:49.065 --> 01:49:49.586]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.324 --> 01:49:57.248]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.929 --> 01:49:59.230]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:26.858]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.139 --> 01:50:30.321]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:30.381 --> 01:50:32.223]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.415 --> 01:50:52.476]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:59.083]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.223 --> 01:51:07.308]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.569 --> 01:51:16.054]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:16.374 --> 01:51:22.038]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.238 --> 01:51:27.322]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.442 --> 01:51:36.328]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.588 --> 01:51:39.891]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:53:02.913 --> 01:53:18.917]  You've got to understand, folks, when I started out in radio, I was always in a studio with board ops and producers in there, and then I shifted over to doing a radio show for the last eight years or so, or seven years, out of my house, in a little studio, a little cubby hole, by myself, always having guests.
[01:53:20.265 --> 01:53:22.746]  On the phone, but now every week we're going to have guests in studio.
[01:53:22.786 --> 01:53:27.409]  Last week it was Bob Dacey, I want to get Dex Mars, George Humphries in here in studio, a lot of other people.
[01:53:28.169 --> 01:53:35.033]  We might have Frosty Woolbridge here, but I've got British National TV coming in here Thursday, and I'm going to interview the guy on air while they do the interview.
[01:53:35.053 --> 01:53:36.353]  It'll be kind of like a cross interview.
[01:53:36.914 --> 01:53:37.714]  So that'll be fun.
[01:53:37.734 --> 01:53:38.334]  That's coming up.
[01:53:38.354 --> 01:53:44.057]  So if I seem like I'm screwing around a little bit, it's just because I'm normally a pretty jovial guy.
[01:53:44.077 --> 01:53:45.138]  Wouldn't you guys say so?
[01:53:46.278 --> 01:53:46.459]  Yeah.
[01:53:46.499 --> 01:53:46.719]  Of course.
[01:53:47.379 --> 01:53:49.140]  I also am your boss, so tell them how great I am.
[01:53:50.944 --> 01:53:58.667]  No, to be serious, to end the levity, I want to come back in the next hour and go right to JJ, James, Jeff and many others that are holding.
[01:53:58.927 --> 01:54:00.968]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:01.188 --> 01:54:04.189]  I want to talk about the avian flu.
[01:54:04.209 --> 01:54:06.550]  I want to talk about this guy that defeated AIDS with vitamins.
[01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:07.510]  That's mainstream news.
[01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:11.171]  That's BBC, London Telegraph, The Independent.
[01:54:11.691 --> 01:54:19.293]  I want to get more into the schizophrenic answers we're getting about how torture's good, torture's bad.
[01:54:19.533 --> 01:54:20.353]  We're against torture.
[01:54:20.373 --> 01:54:21.633]  You're going to prison for torturing.
[01:54:22.494 --> 01:54:25.074]  Saddam's bad because he tortures, but we torture.
[01:54:25.995 --> 01:54:35.457]  So I want to flesh that out and discuss that more because I think it's a key area that needs to be examined and get more into this memo.
[01:54:37.269 --> 01:54:46.996]  Where the White House is circulating this around to Republican leaders about how wonderful and helpful a terrorist attack would be and how your sorrow and your anger could be channeled.
[01:54:47.056 --> 01:54:49.438]  I mean, again, here's the motive again.
[01:54:50.699 --> 01:54:52.880]  They're explaining why they want to do this.
[01:54:53.281 --> 01:54:55.822]  Good old boys all the time say, Alex, just why would they do that?
[01:54:55.842 --> 01:54:57.023]  I just can't imagine.
[01:54:57.063 --> 01:54:58.364]  Well, how would that help the government?
[01:54:58.384 --> 01:54:59.205]  That's ridiculous.
[01:54:59.545 --> 01:55:02.367]  Well, why did Hitler firebomb his own Reichstag?
[01:55:02.407 --> 01:55:03.708]  To get martial law going.
[01:55:04.748 --> 01:55:07.669]  And if we don't expose this, it's over for this country.
[01:55:08.630 --> 01:55:20.895]  But, side issue, I got home last night, and my wife, I told her the story of what happened yesterday, and she said, that sounds like one of those little corporate bonding trips, but we didn't do it on purpose.
[01:55:23.456 --> 01:55:31.520]  We marched up Enchanted Rock, which is this big batholith, this giant hill, a mountain, small mountain, big hill.
[01:55:32.253 --> 01:55:35.554]  And I said, why doesn't the map show a trail over the backside?
[01:55:35.594 --> 01:55:37.295]  Let's just try to go over the backside.
[01:55:38.075 --> 01:55:39.056]  What was that like, guys?
[01:55:39.096 --> 01:55:39.656]  Was that fun?
[01:55:39.676 --> 01:55:42.997]  Yeah, the Brits came to Texas and we conquered all.
[01:55:45.018 --> 01:55:45.998]  Oh, very funny.
[01:55:46.058 --> 01:55:49.039]  And last night you said something bad about George Washington.
[01:55:49.619 --> 01:55:50.940]  Yeah, I won't be repeating that.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.281]  I had a bit of bad luck last night, maybe it was due to that.
[01:55:55.822 --> 01:55:57.122]  But it was a lot of fun, yeah.
[01:55:57.362 --> 01:55:59.163]  Tiring, but worthwhile.
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:01.141]  Dale the Mountain.
[01:56:01.361 --> 01:56:07.864]  But once we got down the other side, we saw these people with ropes, mountain climbing, where we'd been skittering down the side.
[01:56:07.884 --> 01:56:09.625]  We're lucky to be in one piece.
[01:56:10.246 --> 01:56:15.348]  It was quite steep, especially when you've got some kind of middle ear infection, which affects your balance.
[01:56:15.388 --> 01:56:17.109]  It's quite daunting, but we got through it.
[01:56:17.129 --> 01:56:19.070]  We slid down like seals.
[01:56:20.071 --> 01:56:23.453]  The reason, exactly, the reason I bring this up is
[01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:29.871]  The cops, the park rangers, and we're on the radio out there and I'm going to complain about this again.
[01:56:29.931 --> 01:56:33.451]  Last time I was at Enchanted Rock was about eight years ago, and they were rude to me then.
[01:56:33.651 --> 01:56:39.332]  I'm clean cut, driving a decent vehicle, politely ask for questions, and I'm sick of it.
[01:56:40.033 --> 01:56:46.634]  We saw some police driving about a mile an hour, and I simply asked them where we could get bottled water.
[01:56:48.014 --> 01:56:50.915]  But before I even ask that, tell folks what happened.
[01:56:52.215 --> 01:56:52.975]  Well, they just kind of
[01:56:54.033 --> 01:56:57.154]  were very sardonic in saying hello and saying goodbye.
[01:56:57.194 --> 01:56:58.154]  It was very arrogant.
[01:56:58.914 --> 01:57:00.855]  And it's probably the way they treat everybody.
[01:57:00.915 --> 01:57:06.476]  I mean, the old definition was that, you know, they were there to help the public, but they were very arrogant on that occasion.
[01:57:08.036 --> 01:57:08.676]  Absolutely.
[01:57:08.776 --> 01:57:11.797]  And again, it sounds like a petty issue.
[01:57:12.557 --> 01:57:15.078]  It's that I remember as a child, they were real nice and friendly.
[01:57:15.678 --> 01:57:20.199]  And now you go to a national park or state park, they're usually real like you're a disease or something.
[01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:23.811]  And, uh, they're rolling about a mile an hour.
[01:57:23.851 --> 01:57:25.291]  I was like, hi, hi, how you doing?
[01:57:25.311 --> 01:57:25.991]  I have a question.
[01:57:26.451 --> 01:57:27.931]  And the guy just says, hello, goodbye.
[01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:30.912]  And then he just gave me dirty looks and really wouldn't answer my question.
[01:57:30.992 --> 01:57:31.992]  It was just a friendly question.
[01:57:33.512 --> 01:57:37.413]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.

[01:57:38.573 --> 01:57:38.713]  Hello?
[01:57:49.827 --> 01:57:50.468]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.128 --> 01:57:52.169]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.890 --> 01:57:54.011]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.671 --> 01:57:55.472]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.232 --> 01:57:57.133]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.794 --> 01:58:01.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.977 --> 01:58:06.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.602 --> 01:58:13.090]  Alright boys and girls, we are now into the third and final hour.
[01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:15.113]  This day is just blasting past us.
[01:58:15.193 --> 01:58:16.395]  A lot of news to cover.
[01:58:16.455 --> 01:58:17.476]  A short time to get there.
[01:58:17.997 --> 01:58:19.118]  And yes, wide open phones.
[01:58:19.178 --> 01:58:20.761]  And I am joined, they're here for
[01:58:21.716 --> 01:58:24.497]  This is, I guess, a little bit of pleasure hiking about and stuff.
[01:58:25.217 --> 01:58:30.340]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson, his brother, they both do a great job over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:36.662]  And Steve Watson is the webmaster over at InfoWars.net as well.
[01:58:37.062 --> 01:58:40.003]  Growing up, both of you, did you ever think you'd be doing this?
[01:58:40.023 --> 01:58:43.645]  Did you ever think you'd be fighting the sinister forces of world government?
[01:58:44.475 --> 01:58:50.637]  And globally exposing my major criminal operations and even being credited with that.
[01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:55.198]  Did you ever think you'd be sabotaging the machinery of world governance?
[01:58:56.258 --> 01:59:01.640]  I was always kind of into alternative explanations for things, so it's kind of a slow progression.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:06.361]  I didn't think it'd ever reach this level, but it's come so soon, but I'm grateful to be doing it.
[01:59:06.401 --> 01:59:08.702]  You know, it's the best job in the world as far as I'm concerned.
[01:59:09.602 --> 01:59:09.902]  Steve?
[01:59:10.777 --> 01:59:19.604]  Well, for me, I just basically got into politics, and if you've got the right mind and you can see what's going on, then it's just a natural conclusion, really.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:29.285]  Well that's why they spend so much time trying to discredit people that quote talk about conspiracies and the conspiracy is saying that government ever did anything wrong and the government should be watched and controlled.
[01:59:29.325 --> 01:59:30.445]  That's just insane!
[01:59:30.926 --> 01:59:35.448]  But our founding fathers said, here in America, that's what we had to watch and what we had to do.
[01:59:35.748 --> 01:59:47.054]  The Magna Carta in England, which is what our Bill of Rights and Constitution is predominantly based on, said, you know, don't trust the government, limit its size, people have due process, and all of that is going out the window.
[01:59:47.174 --> 01:59:48.175]  Though Tony Blair
[01:59:49.183 --> 01:59:52.707]  Just had a bunch of his police state provisions shot down last week.
[01:59:53.367 --> 01:59:55.669]  Those provisions are moving forward here in the United States.
[01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:56.050]  Comments?
[01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:57.251]  Well, yes.
[01:59:58.072 --> 02:00:02.816]  The reaction to the London bombings in Britain was more apathetic than I think that they expected.
[02:00:03.417 --> 02:00:09.262]  And Blair tried to pass this 90-day detention law where he could hold suspects without charge for 90 days.
[02:00:10.896 --> 02:00:12.937]  He actually got 28 days.
[02:00:12.997 --> 02:00:16.298]  It was originally set at 14 days, so he said, I want 90.
[02:00:17.278 --> 02:00:19.258]  Commons voted against him for the first time.
[02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:28.821]  And he got 28, so it was basically, he reached so far, but he only took something which was more than what he had anyway, so it was a success for him.
[02:00:28.901 --> 02:00:31.782]  But now there is talk of Blair resigning in the next few months.
[02:00:31.882 --> 02:00:34.102]  Whether that will happen, they've said it before, I don't know.
[02:00:35.823 --> 02:00:36.023]  But...
[02:00:37.407 --> 02:00:44.391]  It is hurting him that it's come out that he wasn't this cool zit-faced guitarist, that he's been MI6 all along.
[02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:53.375]  Yeah, that was David Shaler that came out a few weeks ago, said that when he was working at MI5 and Shaler worked on the Terrorism Desk,
[02:00:54.085 --> 02:01:06.456]  Um, he saw Blair's MI5 file and it turns out that this, um, zip-faced guitar-playing image of Blair as some alternative socialist that was going to infiltrate the system and take it on was the total opposite.
[02:01:06.476 --> 02:01:15.503]  He was working for MI5 all along, spying on, um, subversives within trade unionist, uh, groups and things like that, so it's... Oh, so I'm corrected.
[02:01:15.543 --> 02:01:16.504]  I read that a few weeks ago.
[02:01:16.524 --> 02:01:19.567]  I thought it was... wasn't it also some MI6 stuff or all domestic?
[02:01:21.895 --> 02:01:24.196]  No, you're right, it was MI6 actually, it was Boe.
[02:01:25.697 --> 02:01:41.742]  But again, Bush is Daddy's former CIA director, Putin's former KGB, Blair's this little creepy agent, secret agent spying on people, Kettler was German intelligence, none of these guys just sprout out of a pumpkin patch.
[02:01:42.518 --> 02:01:46.399]  They're set up, they're groomed, they're put into these positions of power.
[02:01:46.659 --> 02:01:52.321]  It's the same thing with Bill Clinton, openly recruited by the CIA in the late 1960s, sent to Moscow.
[02:01:53.002 --> 02:01:53.482]  All of this.
[02:01:53.502 --> 02:01:55.182]  I mean, they're not little trendies.
[02:01:55.702 --> 02:02:02.205]  In fact, we see it over and over again, the big banking monopoly and money power funds socialism.
[02:02:02.625 --> 02:02:03.605]  Why is that, Steve?
[02:02:04.746 --> 02:02:08.927]  Well, it's just another form of control that they can use to forward their agenda.
[02:02:10.825 --> 02:02:12.605]  But speak more about that centralization.
[02:02:14.126 --> 02:02:29.950]  Well, I mean, if we're talking about in terms of Tony Blair and people like that, then these figures are always, they're always compromised figures and they're always chosen because, simply because that's what they are, they're puppets and they can be manipulated and used and power can be gained from that.
[02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:31.790]  But he's a loving liberal!
[02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:33.350]  No, he's not.
[02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:35.011]  He's someone we can trust.
[02:02:35.191 --> 02:02:36.191]  I'm with Tony.
[02:02:36.971 --> 02:02:38.632]  The absolute rabble.
[02:02:39.152 --> 02:02:40.292]  Silence, knave!
[02:02:41.255 --> 02:02:42.036]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:42.076 --> 02:02:45.339]  Stay with us here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:49.483]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.743 --> 02:02:50.444]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.524 --> 02:02:51.325]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.665 --> 02:02:56.350]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.690 --> 02:03:01.114]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.535 --> 02:03:05.699]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.919 --> 02:03:08.761]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.861 --> 02:03:13.525]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.725 --> 02:03:18.148]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.369 --> 02:03:25.594]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:49.205 --> 02:03:52.088]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:52.308 --> 02:03:58.514]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:45.406 --> 02:04:46.186]  Attention Drivers!
[02:04:46.487 --> 02:04:49.028]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[02:04:49.328 --> 02:04:52.630]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:57.833]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[02:04:58.194 --> 02:05:01.856]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[02:05:02.256 --> 02:05:03.317]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[02:05:03.617 --> 02:05:06.618]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[02:05:06.939 --> 02:05:07.599]  There is an answer.
[02:05:07.859 --> 02:05:13.982]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[02:05:14.242 --> 02:05:20.946]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[02:05:21.646 --> 02:05:23.868]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[02:05:24.168 --> 02:05:28.130]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.
[02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:33.891]  Go to www.sfrcorp.com for a free shipping offer.
[02:05:34.191 --> 02:05:39.933]  That's S-F-R-C-O-R-P dot com or call 888-USE-S-F-R-1.
[02:05:40.453 --> 02:05:41.273]  That's 888-873-7371.
[02:05:42.033 --> 02:05:51.735]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.815 --> 02:05:56.357]  Alright, we are going to just accelerate through your calls right now.
[02:05:57.337 --> 02:05:58.017]  And then I want to get
[02:05:59.079 --> 02:06:04.683]  You don't have to consult any notes over that.
[02:06:04.703 --> 02:06:06.284]  I want to get your personal opinions on it.
[02:06:06.944 --> 02:06:10.507]  Right now, let's go to JJ from Florida, who's been holding patiently.
[02:06:10.807 --> 02:06:11.687]  Thank you, JJ.
[02:06:11.707 --> 02:06:12.368]  You're on the air.
[02:06:12.768 --> 02:06:15.890]  Thanks for taking my call, and I just wanted to say, great article, Paul.
[02:06:16.711 --> 02:06:18.372]  It costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:06:19.152 --> 02:06:24.376]  I apologize for being a little off topic, but we had a couple things come up down here in Brevard County.
[02:06:25.522 --> 02:06:26.683]  Apparently the U.N.
[02:06:26.743 --> 02:06:33.107]  is funding these little people speak meetings with the different county commissions all over the country.
[02:06:33.347 --> 02:06:39.731]  Oh, I've gotten videos sent to me of the local county commission meetings where they're openly handing cities over to the U.N.
[02:06:40.131 --> 02:06:48.276]  Oh yeah, they had the FEMA Emergency Director there, the Public Health Preparedness Coordinator, and the Homeland Security guy with the Sheriff's Department.
[02:06:50.083 --> 02:07:02.331]  They basically told us they're going to have little pods where we call them, we would probably call them FEMA camps for forced vaccinations or whatever if a flu pandemic or something hit.
[02:07:04.012 --> 02:07:06.193]  And that's all their cover for centralization.
[02:07:06.373 --> 02:07:10.576]  Once the martial law starts, it's going to be a fog that is never lifted.
[02:07:11.376 --> 02:07:12.637]  Oh, it's unreal.
[02:07:12.697 --> 02:07:14.719]  And they're doing this all over the country.
[02:07:15.359 --> 02:07:16.940]  And also, just to let y'all know,
[02:07:20.288 --> 02:07:34.891]  Well, no, they won't launch that unless they have done their internal test and their focus groups and the minute they think we'll put up with it, they'll launch the bio attack and do it and I'll go to a FEMA camp and then it all goes to physical conflict and that's the end of it.
[02:07:35.151 --> 02:07:36.011]  We're going to win that way.
[02:07:37.071 --> 02:07:37.751]  Either way, you cut it.
[02:07:38.191 --> 02:07:39.411]  But I don't think it's working.
[02:07:39.451 --> 02:07:41.132]  Their smallpox fear mongering didn't work.
[02:07:41.512 --> 02:07:46.593]  This bird flu, which they're hyping the levels never before seen with global coordination, I don't think it's going to work.
[02:07:47.113 --> 02:07:48.413]  I think they're going to fail.
[02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:48.693]  Go ahead.
[02:07:49.433 --> 02:07:54.635]  Also, we had a TV station down here out all the Florida Concealed Weapons license holders.
[02:07:55.255 --> 02:07:56.855]  They basically had it on their site.
[02:07:56.895 --> 02:07:57.815]  They've taken it down.
[02:07:58.015 --> 02:08:00.636]  Oh, I know, and that's happened in other parts of the country.
[02:08:00.756 --> 02:08:06.038]  Degenerate newspapers will publish online every concealed owner's name.
[02:08:06.098 --> 02:08:07.098]  Just, just meanly.
[02:08:07.478 --> 02:08:09.719]  Again, the establishment pulling its hair out.
[02:08:10.059 --> 02:08:11.039]  We're arming ourselves.
[02:08:11.059 --> 02:08:12.859]  The slaves are going to defend themselves?
[02:08:12.879 --> 02:08:14.980]  NOOOOO!
[02:08:17.061 --> 02:08:17.941]  It's, it's unreal.
[02:08:19.289 --> 02:08:23.913]  Anyway, I just wanted to say we're doing a lot of copies of your videos down here, and keep up the good work.
[02:08:24.153 --> 02:08:25.134]  Keep it up, my brother.
[02:08:25.214 --> 02:08:25.695]  Keep it up.
[02:08:25.735 --> 02:08:26.375]  God bless you.
[02:08:26.395 --> 02:08:29.758]  You know, it's exciting to have an audience that's involved, that is engaged.
[02:08:30.499 --> 02:08:45.052]  You know, I'm only on, I don't know, 45 radio stations live, another 30 or so overnight, and I don't know, 10 or 15 that I know of that carry us during the weekend, but all told, it's a little over 80.
[02:08:46.188 --> 02:08:50.030]  80 radio stations, and those are licensed stations.
[02:08:50.230 --> 02:08:58.715]  We don't count the over 100 we know of, micros, that the public knows as pirates doing a great job, including the stations that serve the public here in Austin.
[02:08:59.715 --> 02:09:02.857]  But we'll have a guest on.
[02:09:03.037 --> 02:09:05.238]  Member of Parliament, Congressman, whatever.
[02:09:06.566 --> 02:09:10.030]  And they'll say, you know, I've been on Nightline, and I don't get any response.
[02:09:10.231 --> 02:09:11.852]  I've been on this national show.
[02:09:11.912 --> 02:09:14.836]  I've been on, you know, shows on 600 stations.
[02:09:14.856 --> 02:09:15.617]  I don't get a response.
[02:09:15.977 --> 02:09:17.038]  We come on your show.
[02:09:17.098 --> 02:09:18.720]  Greg Pelliss has said this too, BBC.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.262]  I get the biggest response ever.
[02:09:20.762 --> 02:09:22.384]  And it's not because of Alex Jones!
[02:09:22.444 --> 02:09:23.385]  It's you people!
[02:09:24.146 --> 02:09:25.468]  I absolutely love you!
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:34.182]  I mean, to actually have effective, involved individuals, you are smarter than I am, better than I am in so many respects.
[02:09:34.242 --> 02:09:35.383]  It's you that are the leaders.
[02:09:36.003 --> 02:09:37.443]  I want to comment for both of you on that.
[02:09:37.543 --> 02:09:38.664]  Everybody being a leader.
[02:09:39.024 --> 02:09:41.245]  You know, stopping this nonsense of looking for a leader.
[02:09:41.605 --> 02:09:42.725]  Look in the mirror, folks.
[02:09:43.185 --> 02:09:44.286]  Use the tools God gave you.
[02:09:46.252 --> 02:09:48.253]  Well, yes, many hands make light work.
[02:09:48.353 --> 02:09:58.880]  I mean, for example, if I write an article, and it's only going to be subjected to our website, it's going to be limited to our website, unless we have the army of volunteers which email it out to newsgroups or other websites.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:07.786]  And by the end of that process, we could get millions and millions of hits for one article, and then it becomes the benchmark of an alternative explanation for an event, like,
[02:10:08.206 --> 02:10:30.125]  The London bombings, for example, immediately after which, if you typed London bombings into Google, just that generic term, our article about the staged exercises on the morning of 7-7 was the very first link right at the top of Google, and that's due to the traffic received to that one article from the listeners emailing it out and circulating it amongst their newsgroups, so that's the power you have.
[02:10:32.107 --> 02:10:32.607]  Absolutely.
[02:10:32.627 --> 02:10:49.331]  I mean, when I write an article or Paul writes an article or Steve does and it doesn't get linked, it doesn't get that flashpoint of being linked at rents.com and newsreviews.com and whatreallyhappened.com and countless other sites and it doesn't get linked on your message boards and your groups, a few hundred thousand people read it.
[02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:51.391]  And a few hundred thousand is great.
[02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:52.431]  I'm certainly not complaining.
[02:10:53.051 --> 02:10:56.552]  But when certain articles that really take off,
[02:10:57.170 --> 02:11:00.232]  We're talking about tens of millions in the aggregate.
[02:11:00.652 --> 02:11:04.175]  I mean, Paul, we've had stories that have been listed as number one on the net before.
[02:11:05.196 --> 02:11:05.616]  That's right.
[02:11:05.636 --> 02:11:14.322]  There's a system called Daypop and it ranks the most popular news story or any story about celebrities, anything, for that particular day.
[02:11:14.975 --> 02:11:20.177]  And on one or two occasions in the past, when it gets really hot, we've been at the very top of those rankings.
[02:11:20.238 --> 02:11:25.200]  So that link from our website about that story is the most popular thing on the internet for that day.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:34.984]  And especially when big events happen, we get spikes of interest where the go-to source for the first news of people who are seeking alternative explanations for events.
[02:11:35.004 --> 02:11:35.885]  So that's the way it works.
[02:11:35.985 --> 02:11:37.005]  And it's simple, folks.
[02:11:37.426 --> 02:11:40.007]  In some cases, we are not rivaling.
[02:11:40.047 --> 02:11:42.428]  We are eclipsing enemy transmission ports.
[02:11:43.539 --> 02:11:45.180]  I mean, we're actually taking the hill.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.441]  We're taking the enemy.
[02:11:47.202 --> 02:11:48.263]  Small groups of people.
[02:11:48.303 --> 02:11:49.584]  We're just engaging them.
[02:11:50.344 --> 02:11:58.551]  And I cannot stress enough how important it is to stop bickering and backbiting and, you know, getting into all the little COINTELPRO fights that our enemies start.
[02:11:58.811 --> 02:12:00.232]  Just keep your eyes on the prize.
[02:12:00.292 --> 02:12:01.893]  Keep engaging the New World Order.
[02:12:02.894 --> 02:12:05.356]  And don't think about if you're destroying them or if you're defeating them.
[02:12:05.396 --> 02:12:11.581]  Believe me, you start attacking and you stop worrying about the details, it's over for the enemy.
[02:12:12.121 --> 02:12:13.302]  As long as it's credible.
[02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:20.756]  Again, there is a whole asteroid belt of disinfo we have to navigate every time we try to engage the enemy.
[02:12:20.796 --> 02:12:21.398]  Comments on that?
[02:12:22.924 --> 02:12:24.545]  Well, yeah, and it's so simple to do.
[02:12:24.605 --> 02:12:34.152]  I mean, I started off with a newsletter going out to 30 people, and now here I am helping Alex run his website, which has received millions and millions of hits a day.
[02:12:34.593 --> 02:12:40.077]  So from that one small seed, that's how far it can progress in just an amount of three years.
[02:12:40.557 --> 02:12:48.443]  So anybody can grab that and run with it themselves, and that's why we encourage people to be their own leaders, because it's easily possible to do that today.
[02:12:48.923 --> 02:12:50.204]  Yeah, this is about survival.
[02:12:50.784 --> 02:12:58.309]  One thing holding us back is so many so-called alternative truth leaders or patriots are just complete psychopathic power trip individuals.
[02:12:58.749 --> 02:13:01.191]  You see them at public events, they get off on crowds.
[02:13:01.231 --> 02:13:03.092]  They get off on being told how great they are.
[02:13:03.693 --> 02:13:07.135]  I think there's something wrong with somebody that really gets off on that and likes that.
[02:13:07.755 --> 02:13:08.996]  And that's what they're hungry for.
[02:13:09.036 --> 02:13:09.876]  That's what they're looking for.
[02:13:10.156 --> 02:13:11.077]  We're not doing that, folks.
[02:13:11.157 --> 02:13:13.097]  We are truly disgusted by what's happening.
[02:13:13.538 --> 02:13:14.618]  We are truly upset.
[02:13:15.218 --> 02:13:17.279]  I got my passports in order for my family.
[02:13:17.819 --> 02:13:18.620]  They have to escape.
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:20.901]  I've said I'm going to stay behind and fight this thing to the end.
[02:13:20.941 --> 02:13:22.481]  I'm going down with the ship.
[02:13:24.242 --> 02:13:25.823]  This is not a joke, folks.
[02:13:25.863 --> 02:13:26.563]  This is real.
[02:13:29.412 --> 02:13:31.994]  This is for all the marbles, and we've got a chance.
[02:13:32.515 --> 02:13:37.479]  Look, the globalists may carry out another terror attack, another big one, and they may grab for it and try for it all.
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:48.729]  And right when you think it's all over, and their propaganda is being broadcast, and you don't hear me on the air anymore, and right when you think everything's, you know, over, that's when they're actually losing and falling apart.
[02:13:48.989 --> 02:13:50.170]  Because I've done the analysis.
[02:13:50.230 --> 02:13:54.574]  I've looked at what's happening with their systems, their propaganda, their individuals, their personnel.
[02:13:55.174 --> 02:13:55.955]  They've already lost.
[02:13:57.193 --> 02:13:58.594]  They are completely bankrupt.
[02:13:58.974 --> 02:14:02.296]  That's morally, psychologically, spiritually, financially.
[02:14:02.717 --> 02:14:09.181]  All they can hope on is that things just keep sliding along with its own inertia.
[02:14:09.921 --> 02:14:10.662]  That's not going to happen.
[02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:12.963]  Let's take another call here.
[02:14:13.564 --> 02:14:16.145]  Let's go ahead and talk to James.
[02:14:16.846 --> 02:14:18.267]  And James, where are you calling us from?
[02:14:18.787 --> 02:14:20.028]  I'm calling you from Waco, sir.
[02:14:20.408 --> 02:14:20.788]  Welcome.
[02:14:20.828 --> 02:14:21.449]  Thank you for holding.
[02:14:21.829 --> 02:14:22.409]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:22.469 --> 02:14:24.310]  First of all, thank you for taking my call, Mr. Jones.
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:28.682]  Greetings to Mr. Steve and Paul Watson.
[02:14:28.962 --> 02:14:30.743]  You can just, the acronym is Wadi-Wad.
[02:14:30.943 --> 02:14:31.864]  Oh, Wadi-Wad, okay.
[02:14:31.884 --> 02:14:39.888]  First of all, I just want to give you, I just want to thank you and GCN for what you do, because in a dark country, you're a beacon of light.
[02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:49.414]  Also, I saw you talking about the callers earlier, particularly Rita in Texas, Jeff in Mass, Bob in Texas, a couple of, well, Kevin in Austin, Stu in Austin.
[02:14:50.735 --> 02:14:53.396]  Y'all really know what you're talking about, and you're really on point.
[02:14:55.044 --> 02:14:57.866]  Let's continue on what you're all talking about a little bit.
[02:14:58.347 --> 02:15:01.129]  I hear people in the movement, you talk about revolutions.
[02:15:01.509 --> 02:15:03.591]  Well, something's broken, so I believe something's needed.
[02:15:04.111 --> 02:15:05.933]  But is revolution an answer?
[02:15:06.193 --> 02:15:07.734]  I mean, I personally, I don't know.
[02:15:07.754 --> 02:15:14.780]  But with revolutions, whether it's armed resistance or civil disobedience, will that get you the ends that you desire?
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:22.186]  Mr. Jones, I know you're a student of history, and you should know that it's a racket of spin the wheel, meaning that you have
[02:15:23.761 --> 02:15:25.382]  Well, we could have a revolution.
[02:15:25.422 --> 02:15:30.084]  The Globalists have already got position papers on that.
[02:15:30.124 --> 02:15:34.886]  They've already got scenario papers for every possible thing that could happen.
[02:15:34.906 --> 02:15:35.807]  They've war-gamed it.
[02:15:36.507 --> 02:15:38.708]  And they've got fake leaders to take over.
[02:15:38.728 --> 02:15:40.369]  I mean, that's just as scary.
[02:15:40.409 --> 02:15:43.530]  Some group taking over and then announcing themselves king.
[02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:49.473]  I mean, it was like the Republic of Texas people here in Texas all announcing themselves presidents and lords and
[02:15:50.422 --> 02:15:57.407]  I mean, that's not, you know, announcing themselves as generals, all fighting, I'm the president, I'm the president.
[02:15:57.728 --> 02:15:59.889]  That's not what happened with the Continental Congress.
[02:16:00.249 --> 02:16:05.814]  They got together and said, okay, we're going to get independence, then we're going to have an election, and we're going to have a government.
[02:16:07.235 --> 02:16:08.736]  So that's just as dangerous.
[02:16:09.436 --> 02:16:19.244]  And plus the government then can point at these ridiculous groups and what a bunch of jibbering idiots they are and make all of us look stupid who want legitimate reform.
[02:16:20.144 --> 02:16:23.146]  But yeah, violence is spinning the wheel.
[02:16:23.247 --> 02:16:28.190]  If it's offensive, I think that defensive is the way to go.
[02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:30.812]  I mean, people don't run around looking for rattlesnakes.
[02:16:30.832 --> 02:16:32.914]  They don't look around wanting to stomp on porcupines.
[02:16:33.434 --> 02:16:35.135]  You know, those are defensive creatures.
[02:16:35.516 --> 02:16:37.938]  There's nothing wrong with, you know, striking.
[02:16:37.998 --> 02:16:41.180]  If somebody comes up and has a plan to hurt you, you've got to defend yourself.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:44.062]  And pretty soon the word will be out, hey, don't mess with those.
[02:16:45.183 --> 02:16:47.525]  The globalists are predatory control freaks.
[02:16:47.885 --> 02:16:48.846]  They look for the weak.
[02:16:48.886 --> 02:16:49.806]  They look for the stupid.
[02:16:49.826 --> 02:16:51.368]  They look for the people that believe in their system.
[02:16:51.828 --> 02:17:01.255]  I have seen statistically, and just from personal observation, the people that lick the boots and grovel and serve are the ones that are fed on by the globalists.
[02:17:01.275 --> 02:17:02.576]  Let me get a comment from Steve on that.
[02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:11.763]  Well, going back to the revolution coming, I think we already are in a revolution, but I think it's a different kind of revolution.
[02:17:11.903 --> 02:17:12.664]  It's a peaceful...
[02:17:13.467 --> 02:17:15.408]  Peaceful revolution of information, really.
[02:17:15.448 --> 02:17:16.508]  And they want to make it violent.
[02:17:16.869 --> 02:17:24.652]  Yeah, they're the ones that want to turn it into a violent revolution where they can usurp all the control, but I think we already are in a peaceful revolution.
[02:17:25.373 --> 02:17:26.433]  Yeah, let's talk about that when we get back.
[02:17:26.473 --> 02:17:27.394]  Good hearing from you, caller.
[02:17:27.434 --> 02:17:28.594]  Excellent points there, James.
[02:17:29.034 --> 02:17:30.615]  We'll talk to Jeff and Mark and others.
[02:17:30.635 --> 02:17:31.276]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:31.296 --> 02:17:31.336]  800-259-9231.
[02:17:31.356 --> 02:17:32.596]  And I want some callers to talk about
[02:17:39.113 --> 02:17:43.054]  This White House memo about how they are praying for terrorist attacks.
[02:17:46.215 --> 02:17:50.116]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:17:50.236 --> 02:17:51.996]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:17:52.056 --> 02:17:53.317]  But not just any water.
[02:17:53.397 --> 02:17:57.618]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[02:17:57.678 --> 02:18:07.380]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:13.287]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[02:18:13.487 --> 02:18:18.072]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[02:18:18.252 --> 02:18:22.177]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[02:18:22.877 --> 02:18:24.018]  We're good to go.
[02:18:47.959 --> 02:18:49.021]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:54.908]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.970]  That's right.
[02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:58.573]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.893 --> 02:19:06.063]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.613 --> 02:19:14.319]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.739 --> 02:19:19.603]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:20.244 --> 02:19:23.246]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:26.028 --> 02:19:30.171]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.551 --> 02:19:30.812]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.832 --> 02:19:32.733]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.813 --> 02:19:33.113]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.414 --> 02:19:33.694]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.945 --> 02:19:49.427]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:49.687 --> 02:19:53.209]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:53.289 --> 02:19:57.231]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:57.451 --> 02:20:03.614]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:04.015 --> 02:20:11.919]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:12.339 --> 02:20:17.683]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:17.843 --> 02:20:21.605]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.965 --> 02:20:23.827]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:23.887 --> 02:20:26.048]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:20:26.308 --> 02:20:31.552]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:20:31.592 --> 02:20:36.835]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:39.997 --> 02:20:41.864]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:20:46.224 --> 02:20:47.825]  Government is best what governs least.
[02:20:48.386 --> 02:20:49.686]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:50.127 --> 02:20:52.849]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:53.269 --> 02:20:55.931]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:56.371 --> 02:21:02.835]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:21:03.156 --> 02:21:10.541]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.
[02:21:11.221 --> 02:21:14.742]  LibertyStickers.com can even customize your own bumper stickers.
[02:21:14.902 --> 02:21:16.942]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.
[02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:18.323]  Invest in your freedom.
[02:21:18.543 --> 02:21:23.064]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[02:21:23.664 --> 02:21:25.104]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:21:25.284 --> 02:21:25.624]  Have you?
[02:21:26.205 --> 02:21:27.725]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:28.165 --> 02:21:29.665]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:29.725 --> 02:21:31.206]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:36.383 --> 02:21:41.786]  We're going to go to Mark and John and Walt and others' calls here in a moment.
[02:21:41.866 --> 02:21:46.789]  I'm told John disagrees with me, so we're going to have to go to him first.
[02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:48.229]  That's the rule.
[02:21:48.329 --> 02:21:51.551]  We'll see if it's legitimate disagreement.
[02:22:04.855 --> 02:22:06.017]  So we don't screen our calls here.
[02:22:06.037 --> 02:22:17.911]  We don't have to do what Lord Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Michael Weiner, Savage, Beatniks, oily Beatniks such as themselves have to do because we can defend our ideas here.
[02:22:19.009 --> 02:22:22.991]  Unless it's one of the three or four stalkers I have that call up with this info every time repeating the same thing.
[02:22:23.351 --> 02:22:28.313]  I'll let you get a few words out and then get you off because it's just so boring and diversionary.
[02:22:28.333 --> 02:22:32.875]  But if you want to debate the real issues, you want to talk about real substantive issues, you're welcome to.
[02:22:33.415 --> 02:22:35.816]  Did you lose your audio just now?
[02:22:35.836 --> 02:22:37.376]  I think it's still there.
[02:22:37.937 --> 02:22:38.957]  Baron, come on.
[02:22:38.977 --> 02:22:40.618]  Get out from underneath the studio table.
[02:22:41.598 --> 02:22:46.120]  I was going to joke here earlier that we have most of the crew in this one little room right now.
[02:22:47.581 --> 02:22:48.902]  Barron's daddy is in here.
[02:22:48.982 --> 02:22:50.784]  Ryan's dog is named Barron.
[02:22:51.424 --> 02:22:53.426]  Barron's daddy, that's Ryan, is in here.
[02:22:53.446 --> 02:22:54.507]  He wanted to be in here.
[02:22:55.388 --> 02:22:55.888]  It's fine.
[02:22:55.948 --> 02:22:56.469]  I like him.
[02:22:56.489 --> 02:22:58.591]  He's actually going to be my dog.
[02:22:59.872 --> 02:23:01.914]  Other than that, he is causing problems.
[02:23:01.954 --> 02:23:02.715]  The Basset Hound.
[02:23:03.595 --> 02:23:04.156]  Let's be serious.
[02:23:04.176 --> 02:23:05.777]  You guys couldn't keep your hands off the Basset Hound.
[02:23:05.817 --> 02:23:06.878]  I know the Brits love dogs.
[02:23:07.179 --> 02:23:08.180]  That's admirable of you.
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.722]  What do you think of Barron?
[02:23:10.742 --> 02:23:11.683]  I want a true assessment.
[02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:14.602]  The name Byron was very impressive.
[02:23:14.642 --> 02:23:15.583]  It made us feel at home.
[02:23:19.665 --> 02:23:20.746]  That's an inside joke, folks.
[02:23:20.806 --> 02:23:21.986]  I call them little names.
[02:23:22.647 --> 02:23:23.788]  No, seriously, what do you think of the dog?
[02:23:23.808 --> 02:23:26.069]  You can admit, earlier you said he was very nice.
[02:23:26.329 --> 02:23:27.210]  He's very cute.
[02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:29.711]  He's got droopy eyes.
[02:23:30.732 --> 02:23:31.592]  Big ears, too.
[02:23:31.732 --> 02:23:32.853]  Alright, folks, I'm sorry.
[02:23:32.873 --> 02:23:34.194]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:34.554 --> 02:23:39.237]  Literally, though, he was running around underneath the equipment here, about to pull wires out.
[02:23:41.667 --> 02:23:42.748]  Go to John in Ohio.
[02:23:42.808 --> 02:23:43.569]  John, go ahead.
[02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:55.517]  Yes, Alex, you know that I think you're doing a great job in opposing the police state measures, the war in Iraq, and the obvious cover-up of the 9-11 conspiracy.
[02:23:55.758 --> 02:23:57.699]  And we have an anti-communist Basset home.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:05.645]  Well, yeah, that sort of touches on what I wanted to get into, because I think in a way you've just revealed
[02:24:06.212 --> 02:24:28.562]  What the real nature of these fake socialists are, who are really agents of MI6, like Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, posing as a liberal, but actually working for the anti-communist CIA, or people like Oswald, posing as a pro-catscrite, actually headquartered out of the headquarters of the FBI, the CIA, and the anti-cats were there.
[02:24:28.582 --> 02:24:29.642]  Yes, that's all true!
[02:24:30.182 --> 02:24:31.343]  So what I'm getting at is,
[02:24:32.493 --> 02:24:37.257]  I think these people that you called Trotskyists are in that same category.
[02:24:37.857 --> 02:24:56.830]  I read some of the Trotskyists and others like WSWS.org and they completely condemn this gang of neocon warmongers and I think that these neocons were probably in that same capacity as agents working for the FBI at that time and I think it's destructive in the sense that
[02:24:58.484 --> 02:25:06.753]  The second phase of PNAC is to go after North Korea and China in an even more horrible war, and they'll do it in the name of anti-communism.
[02:25:07.073 --> 02:25:08.995]  Why do you disagree with what I've been saying?
[02:25:09.495 --> 02:25:17.043]  Well, the idea that the elite are somehow behind the communists, when in fact during the 30s,
[02:25:18.203 --> 02:25:25.466]  The top elite actually called Roosevelt a communist because of his mild social safety net programs.
[02:25:25.926 --> 02:25:28.247]  And I don't think... The elite helped put Roosevelt into power.
[02:25:28.287 --> 02:25:29.327]  Listen, I'm going to stop you right there.
[02:25:30.007 --> 02:25:31.088]  I know how human...
[02:25:32.956 --> 02:25:33.837]  Nature works.
[02:25:33.857 --> 02:25:44.901]  Anytime you start forcing people to pay their substance into some big pot, and then that's going to be distributed by somebody up above them, you're going to have massive abuse.
[02:25:45.281 --> 02:25:50.263]  The way you cut that abuse out is by not allowing that to develop in the first place.
[02:25:50.783 --> 02:25:55.425]  Socialism and communism doesn't work, and you've got to admit, John, you're being totally
[02:25:56.145 --> 02:25:56.545]  We're good to go.
[02:26:24.691 --> 02:26:29.673]  I really think it's dangerous to mix these things up, because as you point out, Chavez is a leading opponent of the FDA and the global
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:49.121]  Well, he's not doing things that socialists do.
[02:26:50.022 --> 02:26:52.163]  He's giving people their property with deed.
[02:26:52.183 --> 02:26:53.484]  These aren't communes.
[02:26:53.844 --> 02:26:55.084]  He's cut the taxes.
[02:26:55.385 --> 02:26:58.866]  He is selling the oil at a small profit.
[02:26:59.047 --> 02:27:01.028]  If he's going to have state-owned, that's the way it should be.
[02:27:01.328 --> 02:27:04.650]  He's not creating artificial scarcity to rape the people.
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:08.932]  He's actually created what I call a free-market populist society.
[02:27:09.272 --> 02:27:15.257]  The same thing that Cuba has done for decades and has opposed the globalists, even predating Chavez's opposition.
[02:27:15.277 --> 02:27:17.539]  Venezuela is a engine of commerce.
[02:27:18.199 --> 02:27:23.443]  Cuba, I mean, they're in the 1955, technologically.
[02:27:23.784 --> 02:27:27.046]  They've been strangled and terrorized by massive wars of embargoes.
[02:27:27.066 --> 02:27:30.769]  Chavez doesn't have giant prisons full of people they're torturing.
[02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:32.050]  You see there?
[02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:33.391]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.813 --> 02:27:36.714]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:38.716]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.714 --> 02:27:42.495]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.836 --> 02:27:47.876]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:27:48.456 --> 02:27:49.856]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:27:50.737 --> 02:28:01.259]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:28:01.819 --> 02:28:04.320]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:28:05.242 --> 02:28:09.843]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:28:10.423 --> 02:28:15.124]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:28:15.664 --> 02:28:30.327]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[02:28:49.109 --> 02:28:49.609]  are located?
[02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:53.213]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:29:45.572 --> 02:29:48.395]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:29:48.495 --> 02:29:53.561]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:29:53.801 --> 02:29:59.968]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:30:00.249 --> 02:30:05.895]  That's why Garicus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.

[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:00.724]  By the way, about an hour ago I introduced my guests as the Wadiwads, and that's really the tribe from Scotland they come from.
[02:31:00.744 --> 02:31:02.325]  It's like the Wadiwaddle Wadis.
[02:31:03.065 --> 02:31:05.087]  So we just abbreviate it down to Wadiwad.
[02:31:06.227 --> 02:31:08.048]  And so that's how we'll now refer to both of them.
[02:31:08.849 --> 02:31:10.570]  Because they asked me to do that on air.
[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:16.573]  They said, please, please refer before we leave the show to us as Watties.
[02:31:16.973 --> 02:31:18.935]  You know, just trying to have some fun in here, folks.
[02:31:20.868 --> 02:31:22.549]  Because we can't get depressed about it.
[02:31:22.569 --> 02:31:23.969]  I mean, I get depressed sometimes.
[02:31:24.029 --> 02:31:25.109]  Bad things do happen.
[02:31:25.149 --> 02:31:25.849]  They can happen.
[02:31:26.169 --> 02:31:26.810]  They will happen.
[02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:28.530]  There's also so much beauty in the world.
[02:31:28.970 --> 02:31:30.370]  So many good things that are happening.
[02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:32.151]  There's so many good people that are involved.
[02:31:32.711 --> 02:31:38.072]  But so many good people have been conned by the New World Order and actually are involved in New World Order programs.
[02:31:38.732 --> 02:31:43.254]  And that's what the New World Order really counts on, is having you go along with that.
[02:31:43.274 --> 02:31:48.895]  But before we hit that last segment, and I got off on this argument with John about socialism,
[02:31:49.807 --> 02:31:57.894]  We were talking about solutions and revolutions, and there are lots of different revolutions.
[02:31:58.054 --> 02:31:59.555]  There was the Industrial Revolution.
[02:31:59.575 --> 02:32:01.096]  There was the Renaissance Revolution.
[02:32:01.476 --> 02:32:04.319]  Before that, there have been so many revolutions.
[02:32:04.759 --> 02:32:09.643]  We think of a revolution as guillotines and the French Revolution or things like that, which are horrible.
[02:32:10.143 --> 02:32:13.106]  No, no, we're talking about a revolution of saying no to Big Brother.
[02:32:13.486 --> 02:32:15.688]  And see, they're trying to have their own revolution right now.
[02:32:15.728 --> 02:32:17.329]  The globalists are very revolutionary.
[02:32:18.587 --> 02:32:22.030]  They're trying to put the control grid in place right now.
[02:32:23.931 --> 02:32:30.757]  Paul Watson, your comments on the different revolutions that we see going on simultaneously right now, competing revolutions.
[02:32:31.717 --> 02:32:34.039]  Well yeah, we talked about a revolution of information.
[02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:39.784]  I came to Texas expecting there to be Bush Cheney stickers on every car.
[02:32:39.844 --> 02:32:41.465]  I haven't seen one so far.
[02:32:41.885 --> 02:32:46.609]  Bush's approval rating is down to 36% or even lower according to different sources.
[02:32:47.149 --> 02:32:49.532]  But does that mean everybody trusts the Democrats now?
[02:32:49.632 --> 02:32:51.374]  It's the same on that side of the equation.
[02:32:51.414 --> 02:32:54.538]  So people have really stopped buying the propaganda.
[02:32:55.379 --> 02:33:04.410]  And when we talk about a revolution, we really mean a restoration of what America and what Britain used to be with the old Magna Carta of what a country used to be.
[02:33:04.970 --> 02:33:06.091]  Absolutely, I agree with that.
[02:33:06.231 --> 02:33:09.352]  And if I do have any criticism of Chavez, it's that he hasn't rebuked Castro.
[02:33:27.836 --> 02:33:34.939]  And you know he tries to buddy buddy up with all the Latin American countries and I just want to right here repudiate Fidel Castro and the things he's done to his population.
[02:33:35.619 --> 02:33:39.561]  You can criticize Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and he doesn't send police after you.
[02:33:40.421 --> 02:33:44.203]  You can have your own views over there and you can't do that in Cuba.
[02:33:45.063 --> 02:33:46.404]  And so that's my statement on that.
[02:33:46.925 --> 02:33:52.489]  Do you want to comment on the simultaneous revolutions that are competing against each other?
[02:33:52.549 --> 02:33:56.052]  These revolutions of the current events and affairs?
[02:33:56.072 --> 02:33:58.734]  Or any comments on communism itself, Steve?
[02:34:00.015 --> 02:34:05.639]  Well, I think what John was trying to get at was he was saying the elitists are not
[02:34:07.217 --> 02:34:27.965]  They don't invent communism, they're not behind everything, but basically they will find any movement that they can use and they will take it and use it to forward their agenda, whether it's fascism, whether it's communism, any form of control that they can see as becoming successful, they will pick up on and they will take it on and roll with it.
[02:34:28.545 --> 02:34:32.407]  Well that's what Carol Quigley, who was an open globalist insider, the head of the
[02:34:34.088 --> 02:34:42.874]  Politics department, or government department, political science department at Georgetown, very elite political university up in D.C.
[02:34:42.894 --> 02:34:43.454]  and Virginia.
[02:34:44.475 --> 02:34:49.758]  And he said, look, as the conspiracy theorists have said in the right wing, it is true.
[02:34:50.158 --> 02:34:55.722]  We do work with the communists, but we also work with fascists, and with dictators, and with anything centralized.
[02:34:56.813 --> 02:35:01.435]  He said the elite wants centralization, and they'll work with any of it.
[02:35:01.835 --> 02:35:10.558]  And that's why it doesn't matter whether it's Bill Clinton or George Bush, it's the government gets bigger, we lose more liberties, because it's the policies of the globalists that we see being manifest.
[02:35:10.598 --> 02:35:17.721]  I mean, everything that's happening here is happening in England, is happening in Australia, is happening in Canada, is happening all over the Western world.
[02:35:18.982 --> 02:35:22.223]  That's right, and talking about infiltrating movements,
[02:35:23.087 --> 02:35:30.832]  Um, the Black Identity Movement, the environmental movements, seemingly organic movements which, uh, spring from grassroots origins.
[02:35:30.852 --> 02:35:39.097]  Um, the Black Identity Movement, towards its end, they openly admitted that they were being funded by, um, oil money and Rockefeller money.
[02:35:40.238 --> 02:35:46.285]  Malcolm X got out of that apparently and he woke up as Alex was telling us yesterday before he was shot dead.
[02:35:46.325 --> 02:35:59.081]  So by the time these ringleaders of minority movements do wake up, which they do in many cases, it's bye-bye time after that because they're no longer useful to the globalists to use them for their own agendas.
[02:36:00.177 --> 02:36:00.617]  Exactly.
[02:36:00.778 --> 02:36:03.199]  They know the power of controlling revolutionary movements.
[02:36:03.219 --> 02:36:05.701]  That's why it's important that you be leaders out there listening.
[02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:06.901]  That you get involved.
[02:36:06.921 --> 02:36:08.322]  That you don't believe everything we say.
[02:36:08.382 --> 02:36:09.923]  That you research it for yourself.
[02:36:09.943 --> 02:36:12.725]  That if you've got views that differ from ours, so what?
[02:36:12.765 --> 02:36:14.206]  Go out there and get involved.
[02:36:14.806 --> 02:36:19.089]  By not going along with their controlled paradigms, you shatter their control.
[02:36:20.712 --> 02:36:30.346]  Do you think it's going to just accelerate the wake-up that's happening when GOP memos are coming out where they're slathering and slaughtering over wonderful terror attacks?
[02:36:31.427 --> 02:36:33.250]  I think it's going to accelerate it, yeah, but...
[02:36:34.205 --> 02:36:48.540]  Even within that memo there's dissension because the interesting thing to me about it is that there's a debate between whether a terrorist attack will make the population see Bush as incompetent or whether they'll rally behind him, which is why they talk about a devastating attack.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:51.904]  It has to be on such a scale that there's no room... We've always said that.
[02:36:51.944 --> 02:36:53.145]  It has to be bigger each time.
[02:36:53.945 --> 02:37:01.231]  Yeah, because each time they get less gas mileage out of it, like the London bombings, which the London population were basically apathetic to.
[02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:06.957]  So it has to be on a bigger and bigger scale for the American population to rally behind the government.
[02:37:07.057 --> 02:37:10.880]  If not, they're just going to see the government as incompetent, as happened with the hurricanes.
[02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:12.621]  This is something I forgot about.
[02:37:12.882 --> 02:37:20.929]  We need to add this to our comment or the article we've written, or that I wrote last night, about the situation with the memo.
[02:37:23.473 --> 02:37:33.480]  We need to go and dig up, what was it about, it was about 8 months ago from memory, and memory serves, and I'm pretty sure it is serving.
[02:37:34.561 --> 02:37:51.413]  It was about 8 months ago, remember when the White House and the GOP, it was the White House or GOP, I want to say White House, they funded a focus group on whether a terrorist attack would help the presidency or not, and then they found that 60-something percent said it would help their agenda.
[02:37:52.063 --> 02:37:54.466]  No, obviously that's eroded seriously since then.
[02:37:55.127 --> 02:37:56.929]  But I mean, there's another smoking gun.
[02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:59.792]  These guys are having focus groups.
[02:38:00.493 --> 02:38:04.557]  That's where they get a random group of people they're going to poll into like a little auditorium.
[02:38:05.018 --> 02:38:07.580]  Between 50 and in some cases 200 of them.
[02:38:08.181 --> 02:38:09.883]  Sometimes they're smaller, sometimes they're even bigger.
[02:38:10.323 --> 02:38:13.307]  And then they have big debates and discussions and then poll them.
[02:38:14.368 --> 02:38:16.890]  Uh, that is just scary, and that is sick!
[02:38:17.310 --> 02:38:30.120]  There's also, if you remember the betting syndicate, where all these politicians, industrial heads, were taking, um, cross-spread bets on the next target of terror, and what kind of terror it would be in which location of the world.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.584]  That came out, apparently, was shut down, but again, it just gives an insight into their motivations.
[02:38:35.604 --> 02:38:37.765]  Then they just had a private company do it as a business.
[02:38:38.406 --> 02:38:38.566]  Yep.
[02:38:39.315 --> 02:38:41.556]  Oh, but what's wrong with betting on where the next terror attack is?
[02:38:41.576 --> 02:38:48.237]  Because, folks, then the globalists who are carrying out the attacks will even make money off of it in that theater.
[02:38:48.257 --> 02:38:50.558]  I mean, how arrogant is that, Steve?
[02:38:51.458 --> 02:38:55.959]  Well, it's incredibly arrogant, and we see it over and over again.
[02:38:55.979 --> 02:39:00.461]  9-11, what was it, which state lottery came up with 9-11?
[02:39:00.501 --> 02:39:00.901]  New York.
[02:39:01.761 --> 02:39:05.542]  It's just, sometimes it appears to be a game to them, and they have to
[02:39:06.458 --> 02:39:11.381]  What about Al-Zaqqari and the other Al-Qaeda leader?
[02:39:12.322 --> 02:39:18.025]  Even UPI says it's an invention of Western intelligence.
[02:39:18.225 --> 02:39:20.447]  Why don't they have more fake leaders?
[02:39:21.107 --> 02:39:26.470]  How did they not retract the 10 times they've killed him and the 12 times they've captured him or his top lieutenants?
[02:39:29.393 --> 02:39:31.599]  It's so obvious it's sophomoric.
[02:39:31.639 --> 02:39:36.232]  It's like claiming he's some vapor that appears on Halloween to steal pumpkins.
[02:39:37.154 --> 02:39:37.535]  Well, I think...
[02:39:38.186 --> 02:39:44.392]  They're sticking with Al-Zarqawi because he was the foundation of the Hussein-Al-Qaeda link before the war.
[02:39:44.912 --> 02:39:52.019]  They decided to set him up as the connection even though Al-Zarqawi's aims were different entirely to those of Bin Laden.
[02:39:52.059 --> 02:39:53.701]  We knew Hussein hated Bin Laden.
[02:39:54.101 --> 02:40:01.488]  So they decided to use Al-Zarqawi as the focal point between that fake Al-Qaeda-Saddam-Hussein connection by the invasion.
[02:40:01.688 --> 02:40:03.170]  But I mean this individual
[02:40:05.786 --> 02:40:10.467]  They announced on the news it was done by Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:40:10.487 --> 02:40:11.988]  It's even a western name for us.
[02:40:12.468 --> 02:40:13.768]  Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:40:14.829 --> 02:40:16.569]  But the source is incredible.
[02:40:17.129 --> 02:40:18.970]  And then again, now they trot out this woman.
[02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.950]  It's just so obvious.
[02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:22.751]  She's just spreading open her dress and there's bombs.
[02:40:23.211 --> 02:40:24.091]  I'm gonna get you.
[02:40:24.171 --> 02:40:27.352]  I mean, it's just... Go ahead.
[02:40:27.472 --> 02:40:32.893]  I mean, the image of this woman revealing a bomb is just... it's class A propaganda.
[02:40:32.913 --> 02:40:34.814]  Are we really supposed to believe that
[02:40:35.552 --> 02:40:38.175]  They've taken this woman in with a bomb strapped to her.
[02:40:38.195 --> 02:40:38.996]  And they just leave it on her?
[02:40:39.016 --> 02:40:42.301]  They just left it there and let her reveal it to the world.
[02:40:42.641 --> 02:40:44.463]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:40:45.064 --> 02:40:47.487]  Sometimes it just seems like they're doing this on purpose.
[02:40:47.908 --> 02:40:49.349]  Exactly, but remember the...
[02:40:50.848 --> 02:40:59.415]  The TV show that's number one in Iraq, where they like torture 25 people a day and openly bring them out all bloody with their teeth knocked out, and they go, I am a terrorist killer!
[02:40:59.495 --> 02:41:00.816]  I deserve to be executed!
[02:41:01.176 --> 02:41:07.181]  And there's no trial, no nothing, it's like cops over there, but they have everything right there on the spot at some admitted torture camp.
[02:41:08.722 --> 02:41:11.444]  I mean, it's just over the top now.
[02:41:12.125 --> 02:41:15.627]  As well with these protests in Jordan that the news is endlessly replaying.
[02:41:16.128 --> 02:41:19.610]  Supposedly, you know, anti-Al-Zarqawi, pro-government protest.
[02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:22.112]  The fact is that Jordan's a dictatorship.
[02:41:22.632 --> 02:41:28.296]  For people to be out on the streets protesting, they need government permission and organization of the protest itself.
[02:41:28.716 --> 02:41:32.178]  So even at that level, you can see that that protest is staged.
[02:41:32.378 --> 02:41:33.999]  Al-Zarqawi, burn in hell!
[02:41:34.059 --> 02:41:36.361]  And it's like all the Royal Guard's children are out doing it.
[02:41:36.841 --> 02:41:44.807]  Yeah, and I mean attacking the hotel doesn't even benefit Al-Zarqawi if he's trying to get people, if you believe this resistance is organic and that Al-Zarqawi is the leader of it.
[02:41:45.348 --> 02:41:51.072]  It's reversing support from the sunny Jordanians so they don't support the resistance anymore.
[02:41:51.132 --> 02:41:52.954]  How does that benefit Al-Zarqawi?
[02:41:53.254 --> 02:41:54.715]  Why would he be behind an attack?
[02:41:54.735 --> 02:42:09.751]  No, and I heard on another one of those little fake networks, this guy this weekend up there for hours explaining how Al-Zakari is evil and going to get us, and how Bush made him, and our government created this resistance, and almost like he's some kind of freedom fighter or something.
[02:42:10.372 --> 02:42:15.718]  And that's, again, the left opposing his libertarians buying into all of this.
[02:42:16.641 --> 02:42:18.784]  Yeah, they always buy into a certain segment of it.
[02:42:18.824 --> 02:42:26.252]  I mean, you had, two days ago, the terror expert UPI did a big story out of it, saying al-Zarqawi was a US-created myth.
[02:42:26.693 --> 02:42:29.956]  You had another professor a couple of weeks before that who said the same thing.
[02:42:30.337 --> 02:42:37.265]  Because there's no evidence that he's directing anything in Iraq, and the only evidence about him is that he's been killed at least three times, and captured.
[02:42:37.845 --> 02:42:38.445]  Doesn't matter.
[02:42:38.465 --> 02:42:46.429]  But now they have joke stuff in the newspaper where it says captured 12, killed 9, you know, his lieutenants killed 14 times.
[02:42:47.029 --> 02:42:49.451]  Every day it's number 2 killed, number 3 killed.
[02:42:49.951 --> 02:42:51.351]  Every day for years.
[02:42:51.552 --> 02:42:56.574]  Yeah, the number 3 guy, Al-Qaeda leader, Al-Libi,
[02:42:57.276 --> 02:43:02.939]  They said they'd captured him and then it turned out a couple of days later that it was a different guy with a similar sounding name.
[02:43:03.299 --> 02:43:04.720]  It was never picked up again.
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:05.200]  Al Libby?
[02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:06.521]  Is he related to Scooter Libby?
[02:43:06.921 --> 02:43:07.381]  Could be.
[02:43:07.961 --> 02:43:10.203]  But it was never picked up on again after that.
[02:43:10.223 --> 02:43:12.384]  It was just dropped and everybody just moved on.
[02:43:12.404 --> 02:43:16.186]  Well what about S. Watt?
[02:43:16.326 --> 02:43:18.507]  The admitted MI6 guy who they kept protecting.
[02:43:19.808 --> 02:43:21.929]  Well they brought him back to Britain.
[02:43:22.409 --> 02:43:24.370]  After letting him leave Britain they brought him back in.
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:31.203]  Um, Scotland Yard basically said, oh, no, not really interested in, um, in talking to him.
[02:43:31.223 --> 02:43:32.744]  We know he's the mastermind of the bombings.
[02:43:32.784 --> 02:43:38.007]  He spoke to the, uh, several different London bombers on both 7-7 and 21-7.
[02:43:38.267 --> 02:43:43.590]  Um, he spoke to them hours before the attacks were carried out, yet not interested in talking to them.
[02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:49.773]  And he was on the terror watch list, but they kept letting him in and out, and then it goes back to him being MI6, uh, back a decade ago.
[02:43:50.093 --> 02:43:52.735]  But you guys, you had fun getting over here, didn't you?
[02:43:54.076 --> 02:43:57.037]  Oh yeah, we got hassled all along the way when we got to Gatwick.
[02:43:57.617 --> 02:44:03.378]  Um, we went into the departure lounge, and they rifled through our bags, gave us full body searches.
[02:44:03.919 --> 02:44:11.720]  Um, one guy, I had a flashing mouse for my laptop computer, which flashed red because it's infrared, and he got quite paranoid about that.
[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:13.061]  I mean, what mice don't?
[02:44:13.081 --> 02:44:15.361]  I think every mouse we've got shoots red out the bottom.
[02:44:15.501 --> 02:44:18.942]  And it says Microsoft on the front of it, but... Oh, that's obviously Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:19.142 --> 02:44:21.483]  Could've been a bomb, and he got quite paranoid then.
[02:44:22.173 --> 02:44:23.194]  We got into the U.S.
[02:44:23.254 --> 02:44:25.076]  Do you want to tell them what happened when we got into the U.S.?
[02:44:25.116 --> 02:44:27.317]  Well, I mean, what about the face scanning?
[02:44:27.357 --> 02:44:29.059]  That was... That was when we got into the U.S.
[02:44:29.079 --> 02:44:37.006]  Yeah, when we came in, basically we had around 15 minutes to reach the connecting flight, so very hard push of time anyway.
[02:44:37.046 --> 02:44:41.930]  We get to the immigration desk, there's a guy there working for the Homeland Security
[02:44:43.011 --> 02:44:45.614]  From what I could tell, he could barely speak English.
[02:44:45.674 --> 02:44:48.036]  I couldn't... No, I've actually seen guys with huge turbans.
[02:44:48.496 --> 02:44:50.077]  Giant turbans.
[02:44:50.258 --> 02:44:51.679]  Huge Muslim headdresses.
[02:44:52.039 --> 02:45:01.968]  And literally, they'll have a World War II vet like Colonel Robertson with an oxygen tank going... And the guy's... I mean, I'm not trying to be mean here, folks, but it gets a little old.
[02:45:02.628 --> 02:45:08.093]  Well, he was basically... He was saying things to us, but I couldn't tell what he was saying because he was basically muttering...
[02:45:08.843 --> 02:45:10.244]  Through his nose, looking down on us.
[02:45:10.264 --> 02:45:14.386]  It was either like a gang member type, or a foreigner, or like some shaved head Nazi type.
[02:45:14.426 --> 02:45:26.231]  I mean, literally, sometimes I was in California, they were like in commando outfits, with like dark blue berets, going, what's it called, Wolverine security or something, like jabbing old ladies.
[02:45:26.871 --> 02:45:32.254]  I mean, literally, imagine hearing foreigners going, that's who's going to serve this whole New World Order.
[02:45:33.274 --> 02:45:37.416]  I mean, certainly I felt like a criminal.
[02:45:39.136 --> 02:45:42.899]  We blurted out left finger on the finger scanner.
[02:45:43.199 --> 02:45:43.799]  Right finger.
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:54.507]  And then scanned our faces and... Basically we nearly missed the connecting flight purely because he kept us there for around ten minutes just inspecting us and assessing us.
[02:45:55.586 --> 02:45:56.647]  And they ask you questions.
[02:45:56.687 --> 02:45:57.688]  What's your intention?
[02:45:57.748 --> 02:45:58.488]  Why are you here?
[02:45:58.508 --> 02:46:00.490]  I mean, what do they expect you to say?
[02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:01.771]  International terrorism?
[02:46:02.271 --> 02:46:03.792]  How can they gauge from that question?
[02:46:03.812 --> 02:46:12.159]  Well, it's like, down at that very Houston airport, they had the guy who wrote songs about how he wanted to blow up towers and stuff, called, like, L. Arabic Assassin or something.
[02:46:12.179 --> 02:46:13.280]  Did you hear about that a few months ago?
[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:16.022]  And he was down in Houston doing the bags training.
[02:46:17.083 --> 02:46:24.749]  I mean, we're not saying that, you know, you can just walk straight in, but surely, you know, a bit of courtesy
[02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:28.452]  Well, it's like yesterday out at Enchanted Rock, rock climbing.
[02:46:29.213 --> 02:46:30.614]  I mean, just, hi, hello, sir.
[02:46:30.874 --> 02:46:32.255]  What do you want?
[02:46:33.176 --> 02:46:39.260]  And then I'm looking into the cab of the cop car and I say, well, I wanted to ask where the nearest place we can buy water is.
[02:46:39.401 --> 02:46:41.582]  And they just look at me like, what?
[02:46:41.602 --> 02:46:44.564]  You're asking a god a question, scum?
[02:46:45.305 --> 02:46:50.229]  When they put on the uniform, that's it, they're your ruler and you must obey their every command.
[02:46:50.249 --> 02:46:51.930]  Sounds kind of lordly.
[02:46:52.831 --> 02:46:53.532]  They get off on it.
[02:46:53.572 --> 02:46:55.413]  It's like these bag searchers in New York.
[02:46:56.034 --> 02:46:58.696]  The people do that because it boosts their own ego.
[02:46:58.736 --> 02:46:59.917]  They're an authority figure.
[02:46:59.937 --> 02:47:06.603]  They've been given a little bit of power, and they get off on exercising that power, which is why they can get loads of people to search your bags in New York.
[02:47:06.724 --> 02:47:07.024]  I agree.
[02:47:07.044 --> 02:47:08.625]  Did we talk to Jeff yet?
[02:47:09.686 --> 02:47:10.587]  Been holding for eons.
[02:47:10.647 --> 02:47:11.168]  Is Jeff there?
[02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:12.889]  Jeff in Denver?
[02:47:13.329 --> 02:47:14.470]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:47:14.511 --> 02:47:14.891]  Go ahead.
[02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:16.012]  Yeah, hey, uh...
[02:47:16.852 --> 02:47:20.595]  Alex, Paul, and Steve, I think you guys, I support what you're doing and agree with what you're doing.
[02:47:20.895 --> 02:47:21.455]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:21.855 --> 02:47:40.648]  And, well, first of all, I wanted to say that I appreciate what you guys are saying, how the government tries to discredit people, and Alex, first of all, I'm going to send you a 50 to 100 page report about, well, how they've tried to discredit me, document, reporting after I was on one of your shows,
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:43.522]  I was surrounded by three Colorado State Police.
[02:47:43.722 --> 02:47:48.265]  You know, you ended the show with this on Friday, and I'm getting confused.
[02:47:48.865 --> 02:47:49.125]  Right?
[02:47:50.146 --> 02:47:51.947]  You said you called into one of my shows.
[02:47:52.027 --> 02:48:00.853]  Yeah, I called into one of your shows talking about a child sex ring that was supposed to be aired on the Discovery Channel called Conspiracy of Silence.
[02:48:01.334 --> 02:48:01.834]  Yeah, I know.
[02:48:01.874 --> 02:48:02.414]  It was blocked.
[02:48:02.474 --> 02:48:04.576]  I'm going to send you 50 pages to 100 documents documenting
[02:48:08.533 --> 02:48:14.034]  That all of these incidents that have happened... Okay, and then instantly they all popped up at your house?
[02:48:14.214 --> 02:48:19.095]  Well, no, I was on the way... I left and was on the way somewhere, and I looked around.
[02:48:19.135 --> 02:48:27.857]  In any event, everybody should take a look at the Bush Crime Family, which is FreeWebs.com forward slash Bush Crime Family.
[02:48:28.337 --> 02:48:30.358]  Again, it's FreeWebs.com
[02:48:31.701 --> 02:48:35.105]  Alright, thanks for the call, Sarah.
[02:48:35.565 --> 02:48:40.651]  Like I said on Friday, when I get the documents of the police surrounding you, I'll try to give you a call back.
[02:48:46.557 --> 02:48:53.923]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.203 --> 02:48:58.946]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.

[02:49:16.977 --> 02:49:17.758]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:17.798 --> 02:49:21.500]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:24.181]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.401 --> 02:49:31.125]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:51:48.658 --> 02:51:49.178]  Don't worry.
[02:51:49.639 --> 02:51:51.140]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:54.402]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.162 --> 02:51:58.565]  Well, Chris, I'm going to try to jam all three at the end.
[02:51:58.585 --> 02:52:01.887]  We're going to have Paul and Steve back in studio.
[02:52:02.822 --> 02:52:03.843]  Later at the end of the week.
[02:52:04.183 --> 02:52:06.725]  And we're going to have a British TV crew here later this week as well.
[02:52:06.765 --> 02:52:12.529]  I don't know if I have time that very same day to have Frosty Woldridge on, but we'd like to, but I just don't know if I can do it.
[02:52:12.969 --> 02:52:14.770]  But a lot of people are going to be in studio.
[02:52:15.571 --> 02:52:22.916]  In case we run out of time, guys, before I take these three calls real fast, I want to thank you for coming on, and I'm glad you're here in the United States giving us a visit.
[02:52:23.496 --> 02:52:25.357]  It's on my budget.
[02:52:25.438 --> 02:52:25.938]  Is the U.S.
[02:52:25.958 --> 02:52:26.818]  what you thought it would be like?
[02:52:26.879 --> 02:52:29.240]  I mean, obviously, Texas is one area.
[02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:31.862]  It's not indicative of the entire country, but do you like it?
[02:52:32.455 --> 02:52:35.055]  Yeah, it's a lot like home, but everything's bigger.
[02:52:36.476 --> 02:52:37.396]  Including the burgers.
[02:52:40.396 --> 02:52:43.777]  I took you guys to Fredericksburg yesterday and you didn't like the wiener schnitzel though.
[02:52:44.737 --> 02:52:47.298]  Alright, you said you want eggs and chips.
[02:52:47.898 --> 02:52:50.158]  That's all I eat, yeah.
[02:52:50.278 --> 02:52:53.919]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Las Vegas.
[02:52:54.379 --> 02:52:55.039]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:52:55.859 --> 02:52:56.879]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:52:57.039 --> 02:52:57.459]  Good, sir.
[02:52:57.919 --> 02:53:01.220]  I have an article here, this came out yesterday, the Sunday Times.
[02:53:01.909 --> 02:53:12.477]  TimesOnline.co.uk, and it's called, the title says, Jordanian soldiers seduced by Al-Qaeda-aided suicide attacks.
[02:53:13.498 --> 02:53:24.146]  And then it's what it says, just in the first paragraph, a nationwide hunt for the accomplices of suicide bombers who blew up three hotels in Amman, killing 57 people, has led to the arrest of at least 10 members of the Jordanian Armed Forces.
[02:53:24.642 --> 02:53:27.385]  We're hearing worries that Al-Qaeda, i.e.
[02:53:27.606 --> 02:53:31.871]  Al-Qaeda, has infiltrated the Arab army most closely allied to the West.
[02:53:33.519 --> 02:53:36.400]  You know, I heard about that in an email, but nobody sent me that.
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:39.301]  Why don't you send that to... I've been giving it out wrong for years.
[02:53:39.361 --> 02:53:40.322]  Paul, what's your email address?
[02:53:40.782 --> 02:53:50.166]  PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com We'll get that posted with a comment on it.
[02:53:50.206 --> 02:53:52.226]  But yeah, it's always the same email.
[02:53:52.386 --> 02:53:54.707]  We saw soldiers and then the boom started.
[02:53:55.708 --> 02:53:57.668]  It was obviously that small child.
[02:53:57.728 --> 02:53:58.149]  He did it.
[02:53:58.709 --> 02:54:01.450]  Every time there's a terror attack, it always leads back to some government.
[02:54:02.739 --> 02:54:03.760]  Well, who has the motive?
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:04.821]  Surprise, surprise!
[02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:06.902]  I mean, that's the thing for Arab terrorists.
[02:54:06.922 --> 02:54:08.924]  Blowing everything up actually hurts the Arabs.
[02:54:10.625 --> 02:54:20.453]  Yeah, and of course now their government will be able to set up a police state and... Well, we should just ignore the Pentagon's own plans to carry out terror attacks where they explain why they want to do it.
[02:54:20.773 --> 02:54:21.334]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:22.014 --> 02:54:23.135]  Walt in Michigan.
[02:54:23.175 --> 02:54:23.696]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:24.537 --> 02:54:25.057]  Hello Alex.
[02:54:25.377 --> 02:54:25.678]  Hi.
[02:54:25.698 --> 02:54:30.420]  I wanted to recommend two guys on your show for a guest if you ever get a chance to get them on.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:31.140]  Okay.
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:34.722]  And that would be Jack Otto, concerning Zionism.
[02:54:35.622 --> 02:54:41.105]  And the second guy would be Darrell Eberhardt, concerning the Catholic Church's involvement with the New World Order.
[02:54:42.248 --> 02:54:58.679]  Uh, as, uh, discussing all aspects, not just the Queen of England and the Rothschild bankers and all the guys that are involved in that part of it as well as the government officials, but the historical connection with world control, world domination by the Catholic Church.
[02:54:59.557 --> 02:55:04.619]  As well as the Zionists in their quest for being part of a one world government as well.
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.441]  All of them have been at it for a long time.
[02:55:07.461 --> 02:55:09.001]  I hear ya, and I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:09.081 --> 02:55:10.522]  Send me some info on that wall.
[02:55:11.042 --> 02:55:12.363]  I might want to get some of those guests on.
[02:55:12.403 --> 02:55:15.304]  Look, every big organization we've looked at is controlled by these people.
[02:55:15.645 --> 02:55:17.826]  I mean, the Vatican's called for one world government.
[02:55:18.326 --> 02:55:19.346]  John Paul II did.
[02:55:19.386 --> 02:55:20.627]  You don't have to convince me of that.
[02:55:21.387 --> 02:55:23.949]  And I know full well Israel's run by the same people.
[02:55:25.330 --> 02:55:28.312]  It's just that all these groups want to argue about who the one group is.
[02:55:28.752 --> 02:55:31.694]  And I just disagree and say it's the globalists controlling all of them.
[02:55:32.239 --> 02:55:35.881]  You know, when people say Russia is controlling America, it's all Russia.
[02:55:36.241 --> 02:55:37.262]  They're the ones behind it.
[02:55:37.322 --> 02:55:37.602]  Well, no.
[02:55:37.662 --> 02:55:39.203]  It's the globalists controlling Russia.
[02:55:39.223 --> 02:55:40.403]  It's international.
[02:55:40.923 --> 02:55:45.346]  That's why they want to bring down all the nation states and all the separate empires into this one system.
[02:55:45.666 --> 02:55:47.807]  I apologize to Chris in Texas.
[02:55:47.847 --> 02:55:49.028]  Call me back tomorrow, Chris.
[02:55:49.428 --> 02:55:50.868]  We've got four more shows this week.
[02:55:50.908 --> 02:55:51.789]  A lot of big guests.
[02:55:51.809 --> 02:55:52.629]  A lot of key info.
[02:55:53.130 --> 02:55:57.592]  And you guys are going to be back in here with us probably on Friday.
[02:55:58.593 --> 02:56:00.394]  And I really appreciate you coming in.
[02:56:00.414 --> 02:56:00.894]  It was fun.
[02:56:01.234 --> 02:56:01.814]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:01.974 --> 02:56:02.614]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:56:03.074 --> 02:56:03.795]  You bet, gentlemen.
[02:56:03.815 --> 02:56:05.635]  We're going to be getting a lot of new articles out this week.
[02:56:05.675 --> 02:56:07.756]  It's a working holiday, as we say.
[02:56:08.796 --> 02:56:12.797]  And we are going to... You guys didn't like Mexican food, though.
[02:56:12.817 --> 02:56:14.338]  That's an important point we need to add here.
[02:56:15.098 --> 02:56:16.098]  You didn't like that, did you?
[02:56:16.178 --> 02:56:16.358]  No.
[02:56:17.079 --> 02:56:18.339]  You just have... It's an acquired taste.
[02:56:18.399 --> 02:56:18.719]  I like it.
[02:56:19.519 --> 02:56:21.680]  And we'll end the show on that very important note.
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:22.600]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:23.981]  I've got a bashing hound up, Pat.
[02:56:25.572 --> 02:56:30.236]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
