[00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:09.550]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.031]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.713]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:21.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:31.746]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.007]  It is Monday.
[00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:41.149]  The 13th day of June 2005 will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.591]  Wide open phones and several important guests coming on as well.
[00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.952]  Second U.S.
[00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.833]  case of mad cow possible.
[00:00:53.314 --> 00:01:00.317]  It's probably been about 50 times they've found cows that supposedly had mad cow or Creutzfeldt Jacobs.
[00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.235]  That had the prions, the preons, whatever you want to call them, in their brains, in their bloodstream.
[00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:15.421]  And every time the FDA swoops in and tells everybody that everything's fine.
[00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:17.082]  We'll see if that happens this time.
[00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:21.066]  That's out of USA Today.
[00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.928]  Today we'll cover that after the break.
[00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:28.853]  G8 wants tax on airline tickets to help the world poor.
[00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.786]  They're trying a bunch of other global taxes right now.
[00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:37.008]  Global money transfer tax, global oil tax at the wellhead.
[00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:38.249]  That's the Bilderberg Group.
[00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.691]  Literally threw fits over this year.
[00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:42.712]  They haven't gotten their world tax yet.
[00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:44.473]  They intended to have one by 2000.
[00:01:44.553 --> 00:01:51.818]  Times of London, disruptive toddlers to be treated as potential criminals, says report.
[00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:55.480]  If you throw a tensor tantrum and the camera picks it up,
[00:01:56.437 --> 00:01:59.441]  You'll be put into the criminal database and tracked and traced.
[00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.423]  Yes, the control grid.
[00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:08.833]  The police last Thursday shot a young Hispanic man in the back.
[00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:14.740]  And witnesses and others are saying that they just simply walked up to him and opened fire on his back.
[00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:16.395]  On his car?
[00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:23.678]  Ah, but the police are saying that's not what happened and they haven't released the video yet out of their own squad car.
[00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:28.339]  You know, if they were innocent, we'd see that video real fast.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.082]  I haven't watched much TV, but I did scan the news wires this morning and I did watch some yesterday and didn't see it on the nightly news.
[00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:42.144]  So, you killed this guy last Thursday, where's the squad car video?
[00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:44.285]  Where is that?
[00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.826]  He supposedly resisted you.
[00:02:48.607 --> 00:02:51.829]  I'll never forget the time that I had a weight belt in my front seat.
[00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.209]  The cop thought it was a gun.
[00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.211]  Pulled the gun out, stuck it to my head, shaking, freaking out.
[00:02:58.192 --> 00:03:00.993]  And if he'd have blown my head off, folks, it would have been I resisted.
[00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:01.914]  Guaranteed.
[00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:03.595]  I didn't resist.
[00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:04.435]  I got out of the car.
[00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:05.536]  He saw it was a weight belt.
[00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:07.817]  He was a nice cop, though living in fear.
[00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.259]  Just seized by fear and weakness.
[00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.020]  And he said, go ahead and go.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:14.960]  Don't, don't speed.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.961]  I was speeding, folks.
[00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:25.909]  But the point is, if he'd have blown my head off, good chances of, I would say 100%, that Mr. Jones desisted.
[00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.831]  Mr. Jones pulled this little derringer.
[00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:30.692]  Yes, yes.
[00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:41.421]  By the way, right here in Austin, in Fort Worth, in Midland, we've caught police killing their own officers, or killing innocent civilians, as they call us.
[00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:44.154]  By the way, you're civilians, too.
[00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:49.657]  And planting guns, and then good cops blow the whistle and expose them.
[00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:53.599]  So, we've seen this before, just in my neck of the woods.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.000]  Alright, that is coming up.
[00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.142]  Where's the videotape?
[00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:01.723]  Hmm, you haven't edited it yet properly?
[00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:05.065]  I mean, there's always tell-tale signs here.
[00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:11.088]  Believe me, folks, if that video showed him struggling, like the cops are saying, they would have already released it.
[00:04:11.992 --> 00:04:17.816]  Unless they're building it up for some type of, you know, big theatrical, see, we're right.
[00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.438]  I mean, I'm not saying that the police aren't sometimes right.
[00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:25.041]  But when you shoot somebody in the back and they're unarmed, it doesn't look good.
[00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:35.447]  Also, we will get into... It's official, we already reported this years ago, but now British government admits it.
[00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:39.250]  British Secret Service did murder SS Chief Heinrich Himmler.
[00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.851]  He didn't take cyanide.
[00:04:41.817 --> 00:04:43.919]  But the important news item is why did they do this?
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.963]  More on the EU beginning to break up, having some major problems.
[00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:53.047]  Ministers told of need for Gulf War excuse.
[00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:55.049]  There's just so much news.
[00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.093]  Plus we got the Patriot Act explosion.
[00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:00.434]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.802]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.623]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:06.963 --> 00:05:11.666]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:16.429]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.012]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:24.074]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:28.838]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:33.442]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:40.908]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:12.325]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:54.293]  Again that's 888-211-1715.
[00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:05.644]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:08.308]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:25.140]  Coming up, we've got an audio clip of the video, the outrage after GOP cuts off microphones at Patriot Act hearing last Friday.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:42.075]  A furor erupted after Republican Judiciary Chairman James F. Simpsonbrenner shut off the microphones during a hearing on the Patriot Act Friday, accusing Democrats of raising issues unrelated to the act, such as treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:43.690]  Well, U.S.
[00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.253]  citizens have been taken there under the Patriot Act.
[00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:48.516]  I mean, what are they talking about?
[00:08:49.117 --> 00:08:55.545]  And again, the left is attacking this according to partisanship, which is the wrong way to go about this.
[00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:02.106]  Ministers were told of need for Gulf War excuse.
[00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.626]  This out of the London Times.
[00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:17.654]  Ministers were warned in July of 02, months before going to war, that Britain was committed to taking part in an American invasion of Iraq and that they had no choice but to find a way of making it legal.
[00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:21.356]  The warning in a leaked cabinet
[00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:35.116]  Office briefing paper said Tony Blair had already agreed to back military action to get rid of Saddam Hussein at a summit at the Texas ranch of President George W. Bush three months earlier.
[00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:50.085]  The briefing paper for participants at a meeting of Blair's inner circle of July 23, 2002 said that since regime change was illegal, it was necessary to create the conditions which would make it legal.
[00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:59.545]  This was required because even if ministers decided Britain should not take part in an invasion, the American military would be using British bases.
[00:09:59.905 --> 00:10:03.486]  This would automatically make Britain complicit in any illegal U.S.
[00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:03.966]  action.
[00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:14.028]  And so they go on with the Downing Street Memo to say that they're going to manufacture evidence, which they did.
[00:10:15.288 --> 00:10:16.048]  Here's another one.
[00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:19.189]  Iraq war planned two years before 9-11.
[00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:23.980]  Now everybody's running around acting like this is a news story.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:34.383]  Because we have witnesses inside the Bush White House and journalists and others saying they heard Bush talk about it to them personally.
[00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:45.386]  And the media is focusing in on this and they'll say, oh that's their opinion, shower grapes just like Richard Clark or just like Treasury Secretary O'Neill, John O'Neill.
[00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:48.165]  Forget all of this!
[00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:54.049]  We have the PENAC documents written by Dick Cheney in September of 2000.
[00:10:54.129 --> 00:11:06.137]  Two and a half, three years before the war, saying Saddam isn't a threat, but he is a pretext to get the oil and to use Iraq as a military launch base.
[00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:07.418]  Ha ha!
[00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.020]  I mean, is Dick Cheney sour grapes against the Bush administration?
[00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:14.185]  But here's the newest.
[00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:17.807]  I mean, it's a string of witnesses all saying the same thing.
[00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:19.188]  I was in the office.
[00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:20.549]  I saw the battle plans.
[00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:35.299]  According to author and journalist Mickey Herskowitz, the presidential candidate, George W. Bush, was already talking privately about the political benefits of attacking Iraq two years before September 11th occurred.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.681]  So this time, it's even before he got into office.
[00:11:38.703 --> 00:11:43.926]  He was thinking about invading Iraq in 1999, said President Bush's former ghost writer.
[00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:47.148]  So this time, it's Bush's ghost writer.
[00:11:48.669 --> 00:11:50.010]  A guy who spent months with Bush.
[00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:58.094]  It was on his mind, he said to me, one of the keys to being seen as a great leader, is to be seen as a commander in chief.
[00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.196]  It's, Bush has said, I'm a war president.
[00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:01.817]  I'm a wartime president.
[00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:03.858]  I mean, how psychopathic is that?
[00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:05.938]  It was on his mind, he said to me.
[00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.660]  By the way, Hitler said he was a war leader.
[00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:10.642]  So did Stalin.
[00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:12.303]  It was on his mind, he said to me.
[00:12:12.423 --> 00:12:17.307]  One of the keys to being seen as a great leader is to be seen as a commander-in-chief.
[00:12:17.847 --> 00:12:25.534]  And he said, my father had all this political capital built up when he drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait and he wasted it.
[00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:26.774]  Wasted it.
[00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:29.697]  If I have a chance to invade,
[00:12:30.871 --> 00:12:33.413]  If I have that much capital, I'm not going to waste it.
[00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:38.677]  I'm going to get everything passed that I want to get passed, and I'm going to have a successful presidency.
[00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:49.706]  So again, you got a war, you're in a war, the government does what you say, the three branches meld into one, and you can set up a dictatorship.
[00:12:51.047 --> 00:12:59.053]  Herskowitz said that Bush expressed frustration at a lifetime as an underachiever in the shadow of an accomplished father.
[00:12:59.073 --> 00:12:59.914]  Uh-oh.
[00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:27.721]  uh... in aggressive military action he saw the opportunity to emerge from his father's shadow the moment Erskine said came in the wake of September 11th attack suddenly he's a 9-11 uh... suddenly after 9-11 he's at ninety one percent in the polls and he's barely crawled out of the bunker and then it goes into Bush and now this is Bush telling him in 99 all of this
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.260]  This is his biographer.
[00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:34.981]  But Bush is telling him this.
[00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:36.662]  There's recordings of this.
[00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:46.985]  And if this isn't some weird Karl Rove manipulation that I haven't seen the final product of, I predict this guy's going to die of a heart attack in the next two months.
[00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:50.045]  Or die in a car wreck or his plane's going to blow up.
[00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:55.927]  And the FBI will be there as the pieces fall out of the sky, telling local police it was all an accident.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.701]  Very, very serious.
[00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:00.482]  Here's another one.
[00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:01.022]  Memo.
[00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:02.083]  U.S.
[00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:05.285]  lacked full post-war Iraq plan.
[00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:16.434]  A briefing paper prepared for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisors eight months before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq concluded that the U.S.
[00:14:16.474 --> 00:14:24.420]  military was not prepared adequately for what the British memo predicted would be a protracted and costly post-war occupation of that country.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.962]  The eight-page memo written in advance of
[00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:48.663]  July 23, 2002 Downing Street meeting in Iraq provides new insights into how senior British officials saw a Bush administration decision to go to war as inevitable and realized more clearly than their American counterparts the potential for the post-invasion instability that continues to plague Iraq.
[00:14:48.683 --> 00:14:50.404]  So let's go over the spin here.
[00:14:52.586 --> 00:14:56.288]  The spin here is that Bush didn't know because he's an idiot.
[00:14:57.412 --> 00:15:00.975]  And the Bush administration didn't know, but those smart Brits, they did.
[00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:04.618]  In the Downing Street Memo, they admit the U.S.
[00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:05.439]  knew they'd fail.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.707]  Fail in the publicly stated agenda of giving Iraq democracy and freedom and pulling out in one year.
[00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:23.535]  The Secretary of the Army, who was a big Enron scammer, crook for the Bushes, they loved Secretary White.
[00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:28.848]  They said, you're out of there when he said 450,000 troops to win this thing.
[00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:45.173]  Their top generals, Quentin Droves, other former senior generals, the guy that ran the air war, the guy that, the Air Force General, the head of the Air Force who ran the air war in the first Gulf War, said this is going to be a complete disaster.
[00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:53.395]  Brent Scowcroft told them, his daddy's top advisor, they all told them, they all knew,
[00:15:54.238 --> 00:15:58.101]  And then Rumsfeld puts out memo P2OG saying that's the plan!
[00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:14.534]  It's going to blow up, it's going to widen the conflict and then we're going to be stuck there for 10 years and to build these giant bases and now a 6,000 person, well it's going to be 3,000 person, gigantic embassy that's not an embassy at all but the real government.
[00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:19.838]  I mean, some gigantic thing in the green zone.
[00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.840]  I mean, they planned this day one, folks.
[00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.746]  You look at the Gulf War II and you think it's a failure.
[00:16:30.287 --> 00:16:31.929]  No, it's a wonderful success.
[00:16:33.691 --> 00:16:36.975]  You look at the drug war and you think it's a failure.
[00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:38.396]  No, it's a wonderful success.
[00:16:38.817 --> 00:16:41.640]  You look at the war against illiteracy and you think it's a failure.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.962]  No, it's a huge success.
[00:16:44.218 --> 00:16:46.119]  You look at the border war.
[00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.120]  Control the borders.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.060]  You think it's a failure?
[00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:48.621]  No!
[00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:56.205]  It's a screaming, raving, ranting, 110% flying colors success!
[00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:59.347]  13 gun salutes success!
[00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:09.433]  You think that 70% illegitimacy in many cities in this country, 90 plus percent in some ethnic groups is a failure?
[00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:11.094]  It's a wonderful success!
[00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:13.696]  You think cancer doubling
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.202]  Every ten years, the rate of cancer is a horrible failure?
[00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:19.523]  It's a wonderful success!
[00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:30.809]  You think genetically engineered crops taking over almost every other major food crop and infecting and causing all sorts of medical problems and endangering the biosphere is a failure?
[00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:31.909]  No!
[00:17:32.249 --> 00:17:33.710]  It's a wonderful success!
[00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:41.054]  And see, because you see it as a failure, oh, we're not quitters, we'll just make the drug war bigger!
[00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:44.074]  We'll just make the war on illiteracy bigger.
[00:17:44.454 --> 00:17:46.375]  We'll just make the war in Iraq bigger.
[00:17:48.176 --> 00:17:52.698]  You think they want to go in there and put a free country in and pull out and let them sell their own oil and have freedom?
[00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.499]  No, they want all those groups at each other's throats.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.461]  They want that place imploding into absolute bedlam.
[00:18:02.642 --> 00:18:03.482]  That's the plan.
[00:18:04.763 --> 00:18:11.666]  Managed by these technological spires, these command bunkers around the country.
[00:18:15.322 --> 00:18:32.383]  Folks, I read a 1983 Israeli planning document for the Middle East and it said by 2000 we'll have the Americans in Iraq, running Iraq, and we want squalor, we want everyone at each other's throats, we don't want people getting together.
[00:18:35.074 --> 00:18:50.260]  Brzezinski, the founder of the Trilateral Commission, wrote a best-selling book saying this, how they want to go into countries and balkanize them and destroy them, and have them being smoking wreckage heaps with people endlessly killing each other.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:19:02.004]  When the top generals and strategists told the globalists that Iraq will go into civil war, it's always been civil war if you do this, they said, of course, that's exactly what we want!
[00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:07.067]  Hundreds of billions in weapons sales every year!
[00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:09.508]  Four trillion in oil!
[00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:14.810]  And an excuse to be there for ten years for the next phase to go into Iran and Syria.
[00:19:18.552 --> 00:19:23.835]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more heroin and cocaine flood our streets, the more young people are in these prisons.
[00:19:25.512 --> 00:19:27.973]  Predominantly owned by major drug cartels.
[00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:33.795]  I mean, you track back who owns the major private prisons, you can directly link them to the drug cartels.
[00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.076]  They've got it coming and going.
[00:19:35.276 --> 00:19:36.156]  They ship it in.
[00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:39.258]  They send the cops in against their competition.
[00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:42.039]  When your dumb kid uses it, they put them in a prison.
[00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:46.480]  Making widgets for 20 cents an ounce.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.601]  Same thing with illiteracy.
[00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.442]  I've got the official Department of Education plan.
[00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:51.342]  Dumb your kids down.
[00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.223]  You wonder why they're getting so stupid.
[00:19:53.923 --> 00:19:54.584]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.604 --> 00:19:54.984]  Stay with us.
[00:19:57.135 --> 00:19:57.639]  I'm good.
[00:20:01.963 --> 00:20:07.487]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:08.688]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:08.828 --> 00:20:09.689]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:12.651]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:17.875]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.055]  Check out this new product.
[00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:22.198]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:20:22.478 --> 00:20:26.161]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:26.501]  Look.
[00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:28.902]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:33.926]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:20:34.186 --> 00:20:37.288]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:20:37.428 --> 00:20:42.811]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:43.672]  Try No-BO.
[00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:44.772]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.855]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:04.516]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:08.736]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:11.777]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:11.977 --> 00:21:14.357]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:23.199]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:24.739]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:29.200]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.141]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:21:31.402 --> 00:21:43.351]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals and nitrates.
[00:21:43.531 --> 00:21:50.096]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:50.316 --> 00:21:53.478]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:58.622 --> 00:21:59.483]  We're good to go.
[00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:25.196]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:25.316 --> 00:22:29.597]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:33.959]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:33.999 --> 00:22:36.380]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.001]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:42.982]  All the bottom-line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:43.502 --> 00:22:49.708]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:51.110]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:51.790]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:51.990]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.475 --> 00:23:03.857]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:23:04.097 --> 00:23:04.437]  Why?
[00:23:04.457 --> 00:23:07.398]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:12.421]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:36.713]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:36.853 --> 00:23:42.215]  Cardivite drops and capsules may help improve your circulation and cardiovascular health, but that's up to you.
[00:23:42.315 --> 00:23:43.736]  Take the first step with Cardivite.
[00:23:43.776 --> 00:23:44.696]  Call toll free 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:46.237 --> 00:23:47.738]  Just in case I didn't make myself clear,
[00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:20.690]  The government, the private interests that own and control it, are lying to you.
[00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:30.398]  You know they've been caught thousands of times lying, but even though you know they're corrupt, you just don't want to think that they would actually hurt the country or want to hurt you.
[00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:32.359]  Oh really?
[00:24:34.121 --> 00:24:42.728]  Under several different legal doctrines that they got rammed through in the 1950s, the government has supposedly given itself immunity.
[00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:43.929]  You know, they didn't have that until
[00:24:45.015 --> 00:25:03.771]  uh... the nineteen uh... fifties and then they started that with the with the atomic soldiers uh... getting the courts to supposedly make law that is set up new doctrines of total liability protection for the government and if they got liability protection for a cop shooting your twelve-year-old in the back
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.561]  They got liability protection of using depleted uranium and the troops being sick and dying.
[00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:10.722]  And that's how this really all began.
[00:25:11.162 --> 00:25:22.425]  In our modern age, the power of the king, the government being the sovereign, was with the atomic soldiers and all the illnesses and lawsuits that were being filed.
[00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:34.149]  And the government just put through several new doctrines and had their courts create this new law and claim that they have no liability.
[00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:35.843]  It's like U.S.
[00:25:35.883 --> 00:25:46.947]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B. It says the government can nerve gas you, use chemical biological weapons on you for any reason.
[00:25:48.688 --> 00:25:53.510]  And you're worried about the Patriot Act, too, and you're worried about, you know, Homeland Security.
[00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.991]  Folks, they've put all this stuff on the books before.
[00:25:56.371 --> 00:25:58.752]  Now they're just building the infrastructure to do it.
[00:25:59.772 --> 00:26:01.313]  Oh, you don't believe me out there listening.
[00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:03.374]  Let's say you're a cop driving along.
[00:26:03.434 --> 00:26:04.054]  Okay, cop.
[00:26:04.764 --> 00:26:06.825]  Just write this out on your little notepad.
[00:26:07.245 --> 00:26:07.525]  U.S.
[00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.165]  Code, Title 50.
[00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:09.266]  Can you do that?
[00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:10.406]  U.S.
[00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:10.986]  Code, Title 50.
[00:26:11.366 --> 00:26:12.247]  Here, let me say it slower.
[00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:12.907]  U.S.
[00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:14.688]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A.
[00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:15.148]  Again, U.S.
[00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:17.268]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B.
[00:26:32.003 --> 00:26:33.364]  Just go in there and read U.S.
[00:26:33.404 --> 00:26:36.706]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A.
[00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:45.892]  Just read that whole section, because it says, oh, we're not allowed to do this unless covertly authorized, and then we have no liability.
[00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.774]  Just go, stop being naive.
[00:26:50.595 --> 00:26:53.357]  A lot of people can't even believe the government would do wrong.
[00:26:53.417 --> 00:26:54.417]  They're infallible.
[00:26:55.398 --> 00:27:01.182]  They don't trust their neighbor, though, to give them the code to their alarm and their front door key when they go out of town.
[00:27:02.216 --> 00:27:03.417]  But they trust their government.
[00:27:03.657 --> 00:27:19.505]  People they don't even know with unlimited power and unlimited funds and all these secret labyrinthine corporations and government institutions who've been exercising power for hundreds of years, unabated, unchallenged.
[00:27:19.825 --> 00:27:20.746]  Power corrupts?
[00:27:20.946 --> 00:27:22.026]  Absolutely, folks.
[00:27:22.727 --> 00:27:26.869]  Oh no, we just trust them.
[00:27:27.189 --> 00:27:31.211]  So you look at the drug war and you think, man, it's failing, better take more of our rights away.
[00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:43.501]  No, the drug war is doing a great job, turning America into a police state, bringing in more drugs, making it fashionable and underground to use drugs, and your idiot young people use it.
[00:27:44.522 --> 00:27:45.623]  And it destroys lives.
[00:27:46.003 --> 00:27:54.072]  And in case you won't use the illegal drugs, we're going to force you to take our government-pushed private big pharma drugs.
[00:27:55.666 --> 00:28:01.772]  So it's the same thing across the board with these wars, with the war on drugs, the war on poverty, the war on terror.
[00:28:02.433 --> 00:28:04.175]  This is simply a new business.
[00:28:06.437 --> 00:28:08.339]  And it's a predatory business.
[00:28:11.062 --> 00:28:13.304]  So a lot of you are going to have childhoods end.
[00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:16.287]  A lot of you are going to give up that foolish, delusional
[00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:32.952]  Childish view that everything's honky-dory and the people in authority wouldn't hurt you and they love you and you want to believe that they're good and they're smarter than you and they know best and they wouldn't hurt a fly.
[00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:36.895]  When folks, it's not just that they're fallible.
[00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:39.260]  It's not just that they're corrupt.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.421]  They're sadistic.
[00:28:40.841 --> 00:28:42.122]  They're the most corrupt.
[00:28:42.162 --> 00:28:46.144]  They're the most evil, the most cunning, the most deceptive.
[00:28:46.405 --> 00:28:48.546]  That's why they're in those positions of power.
[00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:54.730]  And they wouldn't give two cents for you and your family.
[00:28:55.751 --> 00:28:57.832]  You mean absolutely nothing to them.
[00:28:58.232 --> 00:28:59.133]  You are chattel.
[00:28:59.413 --> 00:29:00.474]  You are slaves.
[00:29:03.447 --> 00:29:04.809]  So stop being naive.
[00:29:04.849 --> 00:29:11.256]  So now ministers were told, ahead of Gulf War, to manufacture and excuse official government documents.
[00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:12.678]  In England.
[00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:16.322]  Our own CIA was ordered to create fake documents.
[00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:18.484]  Another one here.
[00:29:18.565 --> 00:29:20.347]  Iraq War planned two years before 9-11.
[00:29:21.007 --> 00:29:22.129]  Bush's own biographer.
[00:29:22.984 --> 00:29:23.404]  Memo!
[00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:24.165]  U.S.
[00:29:24.225 --> 00:29:26.186]  lacked full post-war Iraq plan.
[00:29:26.787 --> 00:29:28.868]  They... This is spin.
[00:29:29.248 --> 00:29:30.189]  They had a plan.
[00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:31.570]  They followed the plan.
[00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.914]  The only danger is it may implode even worse than they planned into ethnic and religious strife.
[00:29:38.675 --> 00:29:40.936]  Different groups of Muslims fighting with each other.
[00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:45.159]  To where they can't even keep control of this tiger by the tail.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.121]  We'll be right back with some gas.
[00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:47.541]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.499 --> 00:29:54.501]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.422 --> 00:29:58.184]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.047 --> 00:30:06.451]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment, ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[00:30:06.591 --> 00:30:14.918]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[00:30:15.118 --> 00:30:16.719]  More than likely, this includes you.
[00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:20.002]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.

[00:31:18.565 --> 00:31:29.913]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.493 --> 00:31:37.358]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:04.309]  You've heard it over and over again.
[00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:06.990]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.012]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[00:32:11.312 --> 00:32:16.174]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[00:32:16.494 --> 00:32:17.195]  Don't wait for when.
[00:32:17.455 --> 00:32:18.535]  It's important to act now.

[00:32:35.426 --> 00:32:37.728]  Joyce cooked up a meal for the office and it tasted delicious.
[00:32:38.048 --> 00:32:45.153]  Ready Reserve Foods has everything for survival, from kits to shortwave radios, storage containers to non-hybrid garden seeds, and so much more.

[00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:53.056]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[00:32:53.076 --> 00:32:54.277]  They railed against the crown.
[00:32:54.297 --> 00:32:54.997]  Another red tag man.
[00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:29.694]  They lay their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty of their descendants.
[00:33:30.334 --> 00:33:32.536]  That's you and I, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:35.138]  Thanks to the renegades.
[00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:37.179]  Patriot Act not catching terrorists.
[00:33:37.199 --> 00:33:37.900]  We'll get into that.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:38.580]  U.S.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.542]  diplomat survives Iraq car bombing.
[00:33:42.082 --> 00:33:45.524]  Republican senators suggest closing Gitmo, but Dick Cheney says no.
[00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:58.393]  We're going to keep that little place of death and torture open, that little gulag, one of the archipelago of islands they've built all over the world, just hundreds of these camps, 32 in Iraq alone.
[00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:06.099]  More security guards firing on peaceful protesters at Tiananmen Square on a weekly basis, and our government endorses it.
[00:34:07.199 --> 00:34:10.482]  Patriot Act angers some on the right as well as the left.
[00:34:11.577 --> 00:34:15.841]  Uh, and uh, more and more job seekers in America being fingerprinted.
[00:34:16.562 --> 00:34:18.623]  And Congress ready to resurrect the draft.
[00:34:19.104 --> 00:34:20.765]  They're now being very official about it.
[00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:23.748]  We have some internal information about the draft boards.
[00:34:23.788 --> 00:34:25.109]  That's coming up as well.
[00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:28.952]  Plus, Hillary's angry about a new book alleging that Bill Clinton raped her.
[00:34:30.093 --> 00:34:32.475]  Well, I mean, I don't know if this is true, and I really don't care.
[00:34:32.535 --> 00:34:33.356]  I'm sick of the Clintons.
[00:34:33.376 --> 00:34:34.117]  They're just puppets.
[00:34:34.677 --> 00:34:36.719]  Again, who are surrogate members of the Bush family.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.042]  They deal narcotics together out of Amino, Arkansas.
[00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:42.337]  That's just a fact.
[00:34:42.357 --> 00:34:44.079]  I've interviewed the people there unloading the cocaine.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.542]  But if the shoe fits, wear it.
[00:34:47.582 --> 00:34:50.385]  I mean, Bill Clinton is not challenged that he likes to rape women.
[00:34:51.086 --> 00:35:00.055]  Bush and his cabinet like men, which is a sin, folks, but I think it's worse to rape.
[00:35:00.976 --> 00:35:03.299]  And so, Clinton's even, he likes to rape women.
[00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:04.211]  I don't know.
[00:35:04.231 --> 00:35:06.471]  We've got a guest coming up here in just a second.
[00:35:07.032 --> 00:35:09.932]  We're going to be going over all of this news after the guest joins us.
[00:35:10.332 --> 00:35:12.093]  Another horrible police shooting.
[00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:14.193]  And again, I've been pulled over.
[00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:18.314]  I had a cop pull a gun out and put it to my head because of a weight belt and the front seat looked like a gun.
[00:35:18.854 --> 00:35:26.255]  He didn't blow my head off, but if he would have blown my head off, I've got a sneaking suspicion that it would have been Alex who resisted.
[00:35:27.555 --> 00:35:30.456]  But this horrible, horrible, horrible case
[00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:53.412]  uh... happened last thursday and uh... they have not released the squad car video now is is in truth daniel roadshow one of resisted police you would have seen this on tv within an hour of a gunning him down every time they shoot you because there's their their they're scared to death the police are of us
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.121]  They ought to be scared of hanging their hind ends out in the middle of traffic.
[00:35:57.181 --> 00:36:03.963]  I'll see them on 35 with their rear ends hanging out as giant multi-ton vehicles fly by.
[00:36:04.283 --> 00:36:06.443]  They're not worried about that, but they're scared.
[00:36:06.603 --> 00:36:10.565]  And that's the number one cause of death, by the way, is being hit.
[00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:12.005]  But they're worried.
[00:36:12.965 --> 00:36:13.966]  They're worried about you.
[00:36:14.626 --> 00:36:21.508]  And so they gunned this poor Hispanic man down, shot him in the back with pleasure, made her bones
[00:36:23.786 --> 00:36:47.838]  and uh... it's disgusting so joining us is uh... spokesperson erica gonzalez for east austin activist group and we'll give you their website as well erica thank you for coming on with us thank you for having me now you guys i've read your press release you're kind of going with the angle that this is a oppression of hispanics and i'm not saying that
[00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:55.054]  Maybe poorer groups, on average, get abused a little more than in some fancy-spancy neighborhood.
[00:36:55.074 --> 00:37:00.337]  But at the same time, I mean, I know white people who've been shot in the back by the police.
[00:37:00.377 --> 00:37:01.197]  Any comments on that?
[00:37:02.738 --> 00:37:06.941]  Well, we don't like people who are racially discriminatory against youth.
[00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:11.964]  Youth of color, especially, because... Oh, no, I do agree that youth get discriminated against, but go ahead.
[00:37:12.544 --> 00:37:17.747]  Yeah, youth of color, especially, because Daniela Drocha did not have a criminal record.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:28.629]  Well, he had a criminal record, but he had never been pulled over for any type of physical abuse or anything, and this was not a non-violent crime.
[00:37:28.709 --> 00:37:33.573]  Well, he did have a warrant out for parking tickets or something, but I mean, the question is, is that a reason to die?
[00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:35.735]  No, it definitely is not.
[00:37:35.815 --> 00:37:39.278]  Nobody should die for no reason at all.
[00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:43.281]  The police officer stopped him and had really no reason to pull him over.
[00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:48.495]  Had no reason to shoot him without him even resisting arrest.
[00:37:48.855 --> 00:37:59.422]  Well, the Austin and Travis County SWAT teams have blown kids in half over the last decade, shot people asleep in bed, shot their own officers and they frame other people.
[00:37:59.982 --> 00:38:04.065]  They caught the Midland Police a few years ago shooting each other.
[00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:09.188]  Then they tried to frame an innocent unarmed man, but luckily a good cop blew the whistle.
[00:38:09.748 --> 00:38:11.289]  I mean, this is scary.
[00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.131]  Yeah, this is scary, especially
[00:38:14.936 --> 00:38:16.857]  There was no pursuit in this incident.
[00:38:16.917 --> 00:38:19.899]  He was a passenger and there were no drugs found on him.
[00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:21.140]  It wasn't even his car.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:29.124]  You know, so we believe that because he was an unarmed youth, he did not deserve to die in the manner that he did.
[00:38:29.624 --> 00:38:41.230]  Well, there was a case two years ago in Houston, and this is just where I interviewed the family, and they went to the wrong apartment, told the guy to get down on his face, it was the apartment across the hall, and shot him 14 times in the back.
[00:38:41.691 --> 00:38:42.791]  Nobody got in trouble!
[00:38:45.174 --> 00:38:55.016]  I mean, folks, I almost had my head blown off by one of these guys because he thought a white belt was a gun, and if he'd have blown my head off, guaranteed nothing would have happened to him.
[00:38:56.316 --> 00:38:58.677]  Okay, well tell us what happened with Mr. Rocha.
[00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.778]  Well, like I said, he was unarmed.
[00:39:02.118 --> 00:39:10.860]  He was a passenger of a car, and for some reason, I don't think the police reports have been out yet, the car was stopped.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.020]  We believe that it's racial profiling.
[00:39:14.003 --> 00:39:21.566]  Um, when the car was stopped, uh, I think one of the, the, the driver ran away and Daniel Georgia was caught again.
[00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:22.406]  He was unarmed.
[00:39:23.346 --> 00:39:29.968]  Um, he did try to run, but, um, Julie Schroeder was the police officer that was trying to hold him down.
[00:39:30.008 --> 00:39:34.530]  There was another male cop that was, um, there at, at the scene.
[00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:40.392]  Um, Julie Schroeder from what witnesses say it looked like.
[00:39:40.914 --> 00:39:44.835]  She was going to handcuff him, but she shot him point blank in the back.
[00:39:45.375 --> 00:39:47.996]  Now again, that's what the witnesses are saying.
[00:39:48.056 --> 00:39:51.037]  Put somebody in handcuffs, struggle a little bit, you die.
[00:39:52.178 --> 00:39:57.159]  The point here is, if their story is true, why haven't they released this video?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.321]  Maybe they're trying to cover up for something that really happened.
[00:40:03.928 --> 00:40:04.848]  That's what I believe.
[00:40:05.068 --> 00:40:11.950]  Well, I talked to police that were involved in a Travis County SWAT team investigation, and they shot their own officer going into this trailer.
[00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:18.873]  And, uh, then, uh, just simply, uh, well, oh, the guy inside, he did it.
[00:40:21.033 --> 00:40:23.574]  Now, again, I'm not against the Travis County SWAT team.
[00:40:23.614 --> 00:40:27.295]  It's been nice to have the commander walk over when I'm at Luby's and sit down and start talking to me.
[00:40:28.455 --> 00:40:31.216]  No, but, I mean, let's go back and get into all this.
[00:40:31.476 --> 00:40:32.537]  So, what happened next?
[00:40:32.577 --> 00:40:33.597]  She shoots him in the back.
[00:40:34.634 --> 00:40:38.358]  Um, I guess what happened next was that they tried to revive him.
[00:40:38.378 --> 00:40:40.119]  They tried to do CPR on him.
[00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:48.367]  After they had, you know, after this woman had shot him, she tried to rescue him, but it was too late.
[00:40:48.447 --> 00:40:52.951]  He died at 11 p.m., I guess, minutes after she had shot him.
[00:40:53.031 --> 00:40:57.795]  And by the way, she may think she's getting away with this, but you reap what you sow.
[00:40:58.536 --> 00:40:59.757]  Vengeance is God's.
[00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:04.283]  Yeah, we want to see Julie Schroeder tried for this murder in criminal and civil court.
[00:41:04.403 --> 00:41:06.484]  There needs to be justice for this.
[00:41:06.524 --> 00:41:11.247]  But regardless, if she's guilty of this, she's not going to escape justice.
[00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:11.867]  She never did.
[00:41:14.008 --> 00:41:23.013]  Well, I think that the civil trial will see to that justice, and I think if the community pulls together, Julia Schroeder will be
[00:41:23.917 --> 00:41:28.900]  I tried for this murder, and the family deserves this trial.
[00:41:29.441 --> 00:41:31.042]  Oh, by the way, we're human beings.
[00:41:31.062 --> 00:41:36.765]  You know, when a cop gets killed, everybody runs around screaming, pulling their hair out, crying, a god has been killed.
[00:41:37.346 --> 00:41:38.847]  And I'm against it when police get killed.
[00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:41.568]  They're just as valuable as Mr. Rocha.
[00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:47.252]  Just as valuable, not one cent more valuable than any other human life.
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:50.374]  And I've seen the cavalier attitude of cops
[00:41:50.954 --> 00:41:54.737]  You know, about past shootings, and I'm sick of it.
[00:41:54.817 --> 00:41:57.018]  It's not like we're wild pigs or something.
[00:41:57.038 --> 00:41:57.819]  You're out hunting.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.745]  I think, yeah, the police department, the Austin Police Department really needs to go through monthly recaps about not using deadly force.
[00:42:06.845 --> 00:42:08.667]  Well, how many people have they shot in the back?
[00:42:08.727 --> 00:42:11.048]  I mean, it seems every few months we hear about this.
[00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.011]  Yeah, and I just think it needs to stop.
[00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:17.853]  We need to stop, especially when victims don't have any weapons.
[00:42:18.133 --> 00:42:19.194]  I mean, there's no need.
[00:42:19.696 --> 00:42:26.038]  To use deadly force when there are no weapons involved and especially when they're not trying to resist the arrest.
[00:42:26.178 --> 00:42:35.021]  Well I've seen the cases around the country when a cop's daughter or son does something and gets blown away and they scream, they cry and nobody helps them.
[00:42:36.842 --> 00:42:44.444]  And an 18 year old person can't possibly have a long criminal history like they say Daniel Rocha had.
[00:42:44.484 --> 00:42:46.065]  I mean his life was just beginning.
[00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:48.242]  He was, uh, 18 years old.
[00:42:48.262 --> 00:42:53.544]  Well, regardless, I don't want people pulling guns and shooting people in the back.
[00:42:53.824 --> 00:42:54.725]  It happens too much.
[00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:57.266]  It was like that retarded kid, what, a year ago?
[00:42:57.286 --> 00:43:00.087]  And, uh, you know, he was a retarded black man.
[00:43:00.107 --> 00:43:04.009]  And he was mumbling and had a little stick.
[00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:08.311]  It showed on the news, like a foot-long little stick he picked up out from, you know, by a tree.
[00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:11.592]  And he was running from the police, so they shot him in the back.
[00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:12.553]  I mean, I'm tired of it!
[00:43:13.053 --> 00:43:13.193]  Yeah.
[00:43:13.233 --> 00:43:14.934]  I'm tired of them shooting people in the back!
[00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:16.991]  Bunch of punks!
[00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:26.355]  I know, and in Austin police, I mean, it's been known that they're twice as likely to use force against blacks and Hispanics than whites.
[00:43:27.215 --> 00:43:33.437]  So, I mean, there needs to be some type of cultural awareness or something.
[00:43:33.457 --> 00:43:37.199]  You know, police have used force on minorities more often than whites.
[00:43:37.219 --> 00:43:38.199]  It is very obvious.
[00:43:38.977 --> 00:43:41.959]  And there's racial discrimination within the police department.
[00:43:42.279 --> 00:43:44.540]  Well, I think a big part of that is socioeconomic.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.062]  I mean, if you look at the numbers in poor, white areas, you have just as many shootings.
[00:43:49.903 --> 00:43:52.524]  I think it's that the police are afraid in these communities.
[00:43:53.084 --> 00:43:55.326]  And I think a lot of that is unwarranted.
[00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:56.206]  Some of it is.
[00:43:56.266 --> 00:44:01.909]  I mean, I go over in East Austin a lot, around 11th Street, even though they've supposedly cleaned it up.
[00:44:01.969 --> 00:44:05.331]  And I've had people come up and bang on my window and try to sell me crack cocaine.
[00:44:05.911 --> 00:44:09.472]  But the answer is to clean that up, not to go around shooting people in the back.
[00:44:10.592 --> 00:44:11.132]  Exactly.
[00:44:11.692 --> 00:44:13.493]  Yeah, there's no need to use that.
[00:44:13.553 --> 00:44:19.794]  I mean, the police, the incident that just happened, she could have called for backup.
[00:44:20.354 --> 00:44:22.355]  You know, she could have used her baton.
[00:44:22.915 --> 00:44:24.435]  She could have even used her taser.
[00:44:25.375 --> 00:44:32.717]  Now all they're saying is that the guy driving ran, and then he was running, and then she basically jumped on him?
[00:44:34.164 --> 00:44:36.145]  And then her gun went off because she had the gun in her hand.
[00:44:36.525 --> 00:44:36.666]  Yes.
[00:44:37.346 --> 00:44:41.048]  So, I mean, that's even what the police are saying, but they call that resisting.
[00:44:41.348 --> 00:44:44.971]  The guy's running, and she jumps on him and shoots him in the butt.
[00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:47.032]  That's not resisting.
[00:44:48.012 --> 00:44:49.193]  No, that's not resisting.
[00:44:49.373 --> 00:44:53.636]  And in the past, folks, you know, you weren't given a death sentence from running for the police.
[00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:55.532]  Well, it's like the L.A.
[00:44:55.572 --> 00:45:05.197]  case two weeks ago where they shoot, you know, 120-something times into all the buildings because the white suburban didn't stop quick enough and they shot him a couple times.
[00:45:05.518 --> 00:45:07.419]  Turned out he wasn't even the guy they were looking for.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.720]  Did you hear about that?
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.721]  No, I didn't, no.
[00:45:13.903 --> 00:45:20.546]  Well, it scares me for my family because... I mean, so...
[00:45:22.091 --> 00:45:26.174]  I looked at articles from Thursday, from Friday, from Saturday, from Sunday, from today.
[00:45:26.694 --> 00:45:36.321]  The demonization of Daniel is really starting to intensify, and the media is trying to change the story now, but all they gotta do is release that videotape.
[00:45:38.783 --> 00:45:40.745]  I think it's more than just a videotape.
[00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:48.210]  I think that there needs to be something bigger that happens within the whole, um, the way that the police department handles
[00:45:49.778 --> 00:45:56.101]  No, I agree with you, but my point is, is if they've done nothing wrong, come on, let's see the tape.
[00:45:57.602 --> 00:45:58.802]  I mean, it's going to look real bad.
[00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:01.784]  The guy tries to run out of the car, you jump on him and shoot him in the butt.
[00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:09.568]  And it's so sad that it takes a case like this to bring attention to the real issue.
[00:46:10.008 --> 00:46:11.909]  Well, I guess people will stop running, though.
[00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:13.560]  If they know that.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:20.584]  Plus the police claim that they have this right of kings, this immunity.
[00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:22.045]  You do not have immunity.
[00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:27.628]  So how is this affecting the community?
[00:46:28.288 --> 00:46:35.413]  Well, it's affecting the community in many ways because first of all, there's a loss.
[00:46:35.813 --> 00:46:36.994]  There's a loss of the youth.
[00:46:38.034 --> 00:46:39.835]  The family, I'm sure, is
[00:46:41.337 --> 00:46:42.919]  I'm struggling with this right now.
[00:46:42.939 --> 00:46:44.801]  There's a lot of youth that I know.
[00:46:44.921 --> 00:46:52.290]  We do have a Young Scholars for Justice program that works on repealing zero tolerance policies in public schools.
[00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:56.735]  And it's not only in the schools, it's also out in the streets.
[00:46:56.755 --> 00:47:01.300]  Zero tolerance is an excuse to pounce on people with maximum force.
[00:47:03.292 --> 00:47:06.694]  Yeah, so you see them going to school, and it's the same thing.
[00:47:06.734 --> 00:47:08.575]  I mean, you see the track to prison.
[00:47:08.975 --> 00:47:12.097]  Schools are starting to look more and more like prisons, so you wonder why.
[00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:12.697]  Oh, I agree.
[00:47:12.877 --> 00:47:15.959]  ID cards, face scanning, being searched every day.
[00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:18.780]  You say one thing wrong, they come arrest you.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:25.944]  Well, the government's own documents, Erica, admit it's about phasing our children into institutionalization.
[00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:33.715]  Because private corporations then own those prisons and lobby our government to create an economic climate to put people in the prisons.
[00:47:35.136 --> 00:47:38.057]  Our new model in America is going to be prisons.
[00:47:39.217 --> 00:47:40.537]  That's going to be our new country.
[00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:41.698]  That's going to be what we do.
[00:47:43.258 --> 00:47:43.818]  Did you know that?
[00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:45.859]  Oh, it's so obvious.
[00:47:46.019 --> 00:47:51.041]  I mean, if you don't know that, you know that just by seeing the way the schools are run.
[00:47:52.868 --> 00:47:56.609]  I mean, we work with youth and we hear the same stories again and again.
[00:47:56.909 --> 00:48:03.591]  Well, here in Austin they give them all the Tattletale cards, the little $200 bonus cards that they turn family members in.
[00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:06.072]  You ever seen that on that local ad they run?
[00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:09.033]  About it's your job to report on everybody.
[00:48:09.093 --> 00:48:10.093]  Here's your card.
[00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:11.593]  We're enrolling you.
[00:48:11.613 --> 00:48:20.276]  Yeah, there's no, there's hardly any better alternative now for youth, I think, for youth of color to
[00:48:21.303 --> 00:48:25.606]  To express themselves, to let out some of the emotions that they have in school.
[00:48:25.787 --> 00:48:32.232]  It's more like if you have a fight, you're automatically, you don't deal with what the real issue is.
[00:48:32.332 --> 00:48:33.272]  Why did you have a fight?
[00:48:33.332 --> 00:48:40.158]  No, it's more like we're going to kick you out for three days and put you back out into the streets with no other alternatives or programs for you.
[00:48:41.538 --> 00:48:51.622]  Well, again, listen, all these social workers and the system, the way the grid was created, Erica, it's designed to make society unravel.
[00:48:52.042 --> 00:48:54.043]  It's designed to pack the prisons.
[00:48:54.763 --> 00:48:58.524]  And I'm just sad that Daniel Rocha was shot in the back.
[00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:05.367]  And again, I hope that you and others put the call out, hey, stop demonizing this young man, show us the videotape.
[00:49:05.627 --> 00:49:10.769]  Believe me, if it had shown him really resisting, that video would have been on TV in one hour, Erica.
[00:49:11.175 --> 00:49:11.675]  Mm-hmm.
[00:49:13.297 --> 00:49:21.783]  Yeah, and I will let you know if that video is out, and hopefully it will, because the community needs to see what really happened.
[00:49:22.103 --> 00:49:23.785]  Yeah, let's see this guy lose his life.
[00:49:24.685 --> 00:49:31.651]  Well... Let's see him like a fish out of water gasping for air, dying, because I want the police to know he was a human being.
[00:49:32.632 --> 00:49:35.574]  I mean, they don't even see us as human beings, Erica.
[00:49:41.491 --> 00:49:43.512]  Are you speechless?
[00:49:44.013 --> 00:49:53.478]  Yeah, it's just a very emotional thing for me because, I mean, I'm originally from Eagle Pass and I see this everywhere that I go.
[00:49:53.558 --> 00:50:02.203]  Every person that I talk to, even from a different city or state, it's terrible what is going on in our communities and this needs to stop.
[00:50:03.181 --> 00:50:09.184]  Hey listen, I've heard hot shop cops at the gym and stuff brag about how tough they are.
[00:50:10.164 --> 00:50:16.187]  It's like a stud thing to have killed somebody with some of these guys.
[00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:22.269]  Statistically, I'm not bashing women police officers, but women police officers seem to be more afraid.
[00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:27.971]  Did you know statistically, women police seem to pull their guns and use them statistically more than men?
[00:50:28.032 --> 00:50:28.972]  You might want to check into that.
[00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:30.727]  Sure.
[00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:31.987]  Female cops.
[00:50:32.007 --> 00:50:32.987]  Yeah, she's scared to death.
[00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:34.208]  Oh, this man's gonna get me.
[00:50:35.168 --> 00:50:41.949]  Well, I don't, I don't, I can't really speak for every woman, and I don't know, I don't want to turn this into a male-female issue.
[00:50:42.089 --> 00:50:42.969]  But what if it is?
[00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:44.370]  Are you afraid to go there?
[00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:54.551]  No, I'm not afraid to go there, but I think what the bottom line is that police in general need to go through training and... Well, I agree with you.
[00:50:54.571 --> 00:50:56.492]  Stay there and give us your website when we get back.
[00:50:56.512 --> 00:50:57.112]  Stay there, my dear.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.605]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.805 --> 00:51:10.210]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:14.736]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.796 --> 00:51:16.117]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.918 --> 00:51:22.120]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:29.122]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.263 --> 00:51:31.303]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.623 --> 00:51:41.967]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:44.388]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,

[00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:25.605]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:52:46.533 --> 00:52:47.033]  I think so.

[00:53:31.805 --> 00:53:34.889]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.629]  I think so.
[00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.611]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:07.131 --> 00:54:09.853]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:25.698 --> 00:54:26.798]  On with us, let's talk about it.
[00:54:27.118 --> 00:54:31.600]  Now, you know, congressmen are notoriously sketchy, but they always come on.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.061]  He might come on in 10 minutes, he might come on in an hour.
[00:54:36.561 --> 00:54:39.002]  But he's scheduled in about 30 minutes.
[00:54:39.982 --> 00:54:44.563]  We're talking to Erica Gonzalez with East Austin Activist Group.
[00:54:45.723 --> 00:54:51.065]  Erica, is there a way for folks to get in contact with you or check out a website or any contact info?
[00:54:52.331 --> 00:55:04.800]  Yes, we're located on Garden Street, but you can reach us through phone 472-9921, area code 512, or you can visit us on the web at www.poder-texas.org.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.601]  How do you spell that out slow for us?
[00:55:06.681 --> 00:55:15.167]  Okay, so www.poder-texas.org.
[00:55:15.727 --> 00:55:17.048]  Okay, and that phone number again?
[00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:17.108]  512-472-9921.
[00:55:21.934 --> 00:55:37.127]  Listen, I know that it's scary to see the cavalier killing of people in East Austin, and I know it does happen there more than anywhere else, but it happens to, you know, 75-year-old retired insurance salesmen when cops go to the wrong house.
[00:55:37.307 --> 00:55:44.973]  It's scary, it's dangerous, and statistically, after automobile accidents, the biggest threat to police is their own officers.
[00:55:45.674 --> 00:55:48.216]  So it's time for them to stop fearing us so much
[00:55:50.014 --> 00:56:03.539]  And to start seeing us as human beings, and my heart goes out to Mr. Roach's family, if you get a chance to talk to them, and we'll try to expose what happened to him, and as this develops, please stay in contact.
[00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:18.904]  Okay, we sure will, and on behalf of COVID, we'd also like to send our sympathies for the family and for the rest of the communities, and we want to let them know that our prayers are with them, and that we are fighting the justice for youth of color and the criminalization of youth of color.
[00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:23.347]  Well, I think it's the criminalization of everyone, but you're right.
[00:56:23.367 --> 00:56:24.948]  You're the beta test, the target group.
[00:56:24.968 --> 00:56:25.629]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.810]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:30.393]  And this is how it works, folks.
[00:56:30.793 --> 00:56:40.562]  First, the red light districts and the gambling and the drugs was only allowed up until the fifties in the minority neighborhoods.
[00:56:42.403 --> 00:56:45.386]  It's like in the Godfather where, you know, the racist mob boss says,
[00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:49.646]  You know, I want to keep the drugs in the colored areas.
[00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:51.047]  They're animals anyways.
[00:56:51.147 --> 00:56:52.907]  Let them lose their souls.
[00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:54.888]  Remember that quote?
[00:56:55.468 --> 00:56:57.209]  Well, that's really how it works.
[00:56:57.329 --> 00:56:59.990]  And so, this is the happy hunting ground.
[00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.491]  This is where they get to beta test everything.
[00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:09.674]  But as Tony Brown has said on this broadcast, they're planning to bring it to all neighborhoods, all communities.
[00:57:10.154 --> 00:57:12.695]  And it is happening, so we've all got to band together against this.
[00:57:13.661 --> 00:57:16.182]  Very scary to see how often this occurs.
[00:57:16.842 --> 00:57:19.303]  A lot of news in the next 20 minutes of the next hour.
[00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:20.123]  Your calls.
[00:57:21.484 --> 00:57:22.544]  Got Rangel coming up.
[00:57:22.584 --> 00:57:27.366]  Before I end this hour, though, my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:57:27.726 --> 00:57:30.147]  Find out why it's sending shockwaves across the country.
[00:57:30.187 --> 00:57:40.951]  Covers 9-11, the latest police state developments, and who the globalists are, their master plan for world domination, and they're driving ideologies and philosophies.
[00:57:42.156 --> 00:57:51.376]  Go to Infowars.com to get a hard copy of this film via the safe secure online shopping cart.

[00:58:01.654 --> 00:58:02.875]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:02.935 --> 00:58:03.655]  Get Martial Law.
[00:58:03.695 --> 00:58:04.856]  It's a powerful video.
[00:58:04.876 --> 00:58:06.156]  Get it out to people.
[00:58:06.196 --> 00:58:06.897]  Start waking folks up.
[00:58:06.917 --> 00:58:08.938]  Get involved in the info war today.
[00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:23.953]  So again, you can order via InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:24.713 --> 00:58:32.296]  This week's showing of Marshall Law at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, was sold out a week ago.
[00:58:33.156 --> 00:58:39.518]  There's one more showing coming up next week, the 23rd, and you can get those tickets online or at the door.
[00:58:39.538 --> 00:58:41.699]  So go ahead and start getting them if you want a chance to come.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:48.322]  Alright, we will start the second hour with your calls and a bunch of news.
[00:58:48.362 --> 00:58:48.782]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.455 --> 00:59:01.636]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.276 --> 00:59:03.096]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.877 --> 00:59:04.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:09.118]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.598 --> 00:59:13.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.760]  Already into hour number two.
[00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:24.722]  Masses of news has come out, their own documents, their own memos, their own eyewitnesses.
[00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:29.233]  Admitting the entire Iraq war was totally staged.
[00:59:31.673 --> 00:59:33.153]  We do this before the war.
[00:59:36.334 --> 00:59:38.314]  But now it's out there for everybody to see.
[00:59:39.394 --> 00:59:44.095]  Bush's approval rating, depending on what poll you look at, is 32 to 41 percent.
[00:59:45.975 --> 00:59:52.817]  So be afraid, be very afraid, of the globalists carrying out another terror attack to legitimize his agenda.
[00:59:53.217 --> 00:59:54.937]  Now again, Bush is just a puppet.
[00:59:57.082 --> 01:00:04.346]  But at the same time, he is a figurehead for their agenda, and so they use him as a benchmark of support.
[01:00:06.447 --> 01:00:16.533]  And they do need our tacit approval of their global empire for the wars to maintain this empire to be able to continue.
[01:00:18.394 --> 01:00:20.955]  We've also got a bunch of news about the national draft.
[01:00:21.055 --> 01:00:23.017]  Now the Democrats are coming out and saying,
[01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:25.818]  We may need one.
[01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:27.959]  We may need to help Bush.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.120]  We may need to get this through.
[01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:34.543]  And they're serious about it, and they've set up the draft boards again.
[01:00:36.144 --> 01:00:38.886]  I've talked to people that have went and volunteered for these draft boards.
[01:00:38.946 --> 01:00:42.167]  They are told under national security to keep their mouths shut.
[01:00:42.688 --> 01:00:44.669]  They're not supposed to tell you what they know.
[01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:47.190]  But that is that a new draft is coming.
[01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:48.811]  They've introduced the bills.
[01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:52.994]  And after the next terror attack, they're going to have a draft in this country.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.580]  It's going to be a devastating attack.
[01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:59.221]  You're going to be an evil traitor if you don't go along with it.
[01:01:02.682 --> 01:01:08.104]  The question is, are the globalists secure enough in their position to go ahead with this program?
[01:01:10.264 --> 01:01:15.126]  We'll be talking to Congressman Rangel, scheduled here in about 15-20 minutes, about this.
[01:01:15.166 --> 01:01:19.487]  He's introduced a bill two years ago to do this, and reintroduced it in this session of Congress.
[01:01:20.715 --> 01:01:24.097]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Denver, Colorado.
[01:01:24.137 --> 01:01:24.857]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:01:25.497 --> 01:01:26.218]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[01:01:26.258 --> 01:01:27.238]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:28.259 --> 01:01:32.261]  By now you probably know that you're going to be on Thursday night in Coast to Coast.
[01:01:32.761 --> 01:01:33.161]  Yes.
[01:01:33.661 --> 01:01:38.424]  Yeah, it's going to be you and Henry Griffin in an interesting format.
[01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:40.104]  It'll be a debate type format.
[01:01:40.245 --> 01:01:45.227]  And the other side of the aisle will be Peter Lance and some guy named Jerome Corsi.
[01:01:45.751 --> 01:01:46.992]  I've heard Peter Lantzberger talk.
[01:01:47.012 --> 01:01:48.013]  He's pretty sharp.
[01:01:48.113 --> 01:01:53.177]  I know nothing about Corsi, but it should be interesting, you and David debating against those two.
[01:01:53.237 --> 01:01:54.418]  I can't wait to hear it.
[01:01:54.998 --> 01:01:57.901]  Be sure and mention that and post something on your website.
[01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.183]  Well, if I get equal time, I'm going to smash them.
[01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:02.664]  Oh, I have no doubt.
[01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:03.525]  I have no doubt.
[01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:05.667]  Because I'll be focused for that broadcast.
[01:02:05.687 --> 01:02:06.387]  You better believe it.
[01:02:06.647 --> 01:02:14.914]  I mean, I've got to show my film this Thursday night, and then I'll go over and stay up until five in the morning doing the debate, but we never stop fighting here, sir.
[01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:15.781]  I hear you.
[01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:16.242]  I hear you.
[01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:18.543]  You kind of stole my thunder.
[01:02:18.623 --> 01:02:21.926]  I was going to mention about Bush's approval rate.
[01:02:22.006 --> 01:02:28.110]  I also heard on the radio this morning locally that a Gallup poll was saying either 59 or 69.
[01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:29.512]  I couldn't quite remember.
[01:02:29.532 --> 01:02:30.252]  I was half asleep.
[01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:38.718]  59 of those, or 59% of those, or 69% of those polls said that they want Bush to pull out of Iraq, which I thought was really interesting.
[01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:44.703]  Yeah, they had a poll a week ago that was like 56% a new poll showing even higher numbers.
[01:02:45.273 --> 01:02:45.513]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:48.675]  You see, we have a very sheep-like population.
[01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:52.916]  So once people see 50%, they all rush over to the other side.
[01:02:54.077 --> 01:02:55.117]  Which I think is sad.
[01:02:55.818 --> 01:02:56.618]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:57.699]  One last thing quickly.
[01:02:57.859 --> 01:03:03.781]  I have also heard that, you know, Toyota's building a big plant near San Antonio.
[01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:09.704]  I've heard there's a big stink about a lot of illegal labors being used and the unions are getting upset about that.
[01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:10.084]  Well, of course.
[01:03:10.564 --> 01:03:14.006]  Yeah, the Maquiladoras basically run right up to Austin now.
[01:03:15.723 --> 01:03:20.066]  That's all it is, is a McKilladoras on this side of the border.
[01:03:20.807 --> 01:03:21.948]  Wow, that's scary.
[01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:24.249]  Okay man, look forward to Thursday night.
[01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:25.490]  Oh yeah, thank you.
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:34.436]  Yeah, it's scary when America's gotten so third world that the factory jobs start coming back because we've got the cheapest labor.
[01:03:37.717 --> 01:03:38.898]  We knew that would happen.
[01:03:42.262 --> 01:03:42.863]  Oh man.
[01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:46.807]  I got this new truck and it's 100% prisoner built.
[01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:48.449]  High quality.
[01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:50.011]  I like it.
[01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:51.913]  My son works in the prison.
[01:03:53.919 --> 01:03:56.800]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.601]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:58.941 --> 01:04:03.644]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:03.964 --> 01:04:08.426]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:08.826 --> 01:04:12.988]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.050]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:20.812]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.013 --> 01:04:25.455]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:25.655 --> 01:04:32.879]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.139 --> 01:04:35.561]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:02.981 --> 01:05:14.208]  Black perky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.548 --> 01:05:19.371]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum
[01:05:19.591 --> 01:05:20.271]  Are no problem.
[01:05:20.491 --> 01:05:27.133]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.353 --> 01:05:34.176]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[01:05:58.719 --> 01:05:59.780]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:00.781]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:06:00.901 --> 01:06:03.723]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:06:03.923 --> 01:06:08.806]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:06:09.047 --> 01:06:10.127]  Check out this new product.

[01:06:25.258 --> 01:06:28.380]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:33.883]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:06:34.003 --> 01:06:34.764]  Try No-BO.
[01:06:34.884 --> 01:06:35.864]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:06:37.045 --> 01:06:37.466]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.780]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:01.601]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:03.082]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:04.742]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.762 --> 01:07:09.104]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.584 --> 01:07:13.646]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:37.297]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Charles Rangel is scheduled in the next segment with us to talk about his bill to reintroduce conscription, better known as the National Draft.
[01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:41.551]  Congress ready to resurrect the draft.
[01:07:41.611 --> 01:07:43.031]  This by Greg Siminski.
[01:07:43.591 --> 01:07:43.892]  U.S.
[01:07:43.952 --> 01:07:46.152]  needs more boots on the grounds as Democrat.
[01:07:46.652 --> 01:07:56.495]  A House bill to reinstate the draft finally made its way to the Armed Services Committee where a vote is expected only after President Bush decides whether he is for or against conscription.
[01:07:58.123 --> 01:08:04.126]  Bush has failed to make clear how he plans to restock the army in light of dwindling recruiting numbers.
[01:08:04.766 --> 01:08:10.609]  Meanwhile, Congress is reluctant to make a decision due to the draft's unpopularity with voters.
[01:08:12.771 --> 01:08:16.132]  And they lowered the numbers for all four branches of the military.
[01:08:16.813 --> 01:08:21.295]  And the only branch that has made its lowered numbers is the Coast Guard.
[01:08:21.995 --> 01:08:22.976]  Even the Marines
[01:08:23.852 --> 01:08:30.436]  After lowering their projections three times in the last two years, have failed miserably, with the Army upwards of 50%.
[01:08:32.657 --> 01:08:43.364]  A White House spokesman said Bush has always firmly opposed the draft, but many insiders believe Bush will have to reassess the issue in light of the Army's failed recruiting efforts.
[01:08:45.365 --> 01:08:48.227]  And they've been gearing up for the war in Iraq
[01:08:51.445 --> 01:08:56.890]  They've been gearing up for a draft, setting up the draft boards, increasing the money for selective service.
[01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:02.434]  Of course, something most people don't know is that the U.S.
[01:09:02.615 --> 01:09:05.557]  Army's biggest recruiting stations aren't in L.A.
[01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:06.158]  or New York.
[01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:12.203]  They are in northern Mexico, and they even have offices in Mexico City.
[01:09:13.874 --> 01:09:27.403]  And down in the South Texas Valley, one of the poorest areas in the country, literally folks, I was just down there a few weeks ago, there are billboards on almost every corner for the four branches.
[01:09:27.664 --> 01:09:30.446]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:34.969]  And 25-30%, depending on what federal report I've seen, it's 25-30%, different federal numbers,
[01:09:39.306 --> 01:09:42.447]  Of the troops in Iraq weren't even citizens to begin with.
[01:09:42.507 --> 01:09:44.168]  They were illegal aliens.
[01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:58.534]  So, if they're able, I mean, they'll have 100% illegal alien military, I guess, or 95% with the officers being American, I guess.
[01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.995]  And we truly will be an empire!
[01:10:02.796 --> 01:10:04.897]  So that's another big part of this illegal immigration.
[01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:07.358]  Because they make good soldiers.
[01:10:07.498 --> 01:10:08.438]  I mean, really good soldiers.
[01:10:11.305 --> 01:10:12.766]  I mean, peasants always do.
[01:10:12.786 --> 01:10:16.308]  I mean, look at, you know, Audie Murphy, the little peasant from the farm.
[01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:19.330]  But Americans aren't farmers anymore.
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:29.256]  We're spoiled, rotten, video game-playing brats who aren't about to lay our lives down for the empire, no matter how high-grade the propaganda is.
[01:10:29.376 --> 01:10:35.880]  So, the globalist-owned dumbing down of the public is working for them at certain levels, but not at others.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.581]  They're having to now go get conscripts
[01:10:39.432 --> 01:10:42.234]  Freebooters out of Latin America.
[01:10:43.135 --> 01:10:45.537]  And Latin America is the predominant force.
[01:10:47.138 --> 01:10:50.942]  And of that force, they're predominantly Mexican.
[01:10:51.482 --> 01:11:03.472]  Though their leaders are predominantly Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, Colombian, and of course, Guatemalan, and I mentioned Panamanian.
[01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:09.350]  And they are the famous Death Squad Commanders of the 1980s.
[01:11:10.591 --> 01:11:21.134]  And now those same Death Squad Commanders are commanding Las Zetas here in Texas, killing police and others, and firebombing and machine-gunning vehicles, hundreds of deaths, and the news keeps it quiet.
[01:11:22.235 --> 01:11:27.337]  Bush is even running a drug war right now against his competition that isn't paying into their coffers.
[01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:31.398]  So, we are REALLY turning into a third world cesspit.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:41.792]  But at least 25% of our new military, that is the globalist new military, is an illegal alien cadre.
[01:11:43.374 --> 01:11:44.595]  You gotta love it, folks.
[01:11:47.579 --> 01:11:51.544]  I'm sorry, it just really gets out of control sometimes.
[01:11:55.149 --> 01:12:04.696]  So, a White House spokesman said Bush has always firmly opposed the draft, but many insiders believe Bush will have to reassess the issue in light of the Army's failed recruiting efforts.
[01:12:05.376 --> 01:12:17.445]  Emily Millen, a spokesman for Representative Charles Rangel, who sponsored the controversial draft bill, said this is the type of bill no one likes to touch without a consensus of all branches of government.
[01:12:18.225 --> 01:12:23.008]  The draft is especially unpopular now because the mounting death toll in Iraq said
[01:12:24.432 --> 01:12:25.393]  is representative.
[01:12:26.233 --> 01:12:33.618]  Rangel is, of course, opposed to the war, but believes if we're going to have to fight it, then the military should have enough soldiers to do the job properly.
[01:12:34.358 --> 01:12:35.359]  Perfect position.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:46.466]  Then he claims that I fought, you know, in Korea, which he did, highly decorated, and we need to make these rich kids go, and women too!
[01:12:47.847 --> 01:12:49.188]  No exceptions!
[01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:51.379]  No!
[01:12:51.399 --> 01:12:55.220]  No exceptions for college or babies or anything!
[01:12:55.241 --> 01:12:56.461]  They need to go!
[01:12:56.481 --> 01:12:58.522]  Well, we'll have him on in just a minute.
[01:13:01.463 --> 01:13:04.724]  I hope he stays on a while, because I've got some serious questions for Mr. Rangel.
[01:13:05.584 --> 01:13:10.065]  And then now we have Biden and other Democrats going, we're going to need one.
[01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.746]  I have the Washington Post today with them saying it.
[01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:16.548]  We're going to need it, and it's good, the war is good.
[01:13:16.588 --> 01:13:20.489]  So see, they've already positioned themselves where the Democratic leaders are for it.
[01:13:21.218 --> 01:13:24.903]  Since the war has become less popular with the American people, the death toll in the U.S.
[01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:26.766]  soldiers in Iraq has risen to 1,680.
[01:13:27.186 --> 01:13:31.973]  The Army is now responding and reporting recruiting levels down as much as 50%.
[01:13:34.396 --> 01:13:35.818]  And so it goes on and on.
[01:13:37.535 --> 01:13:45.642]  At best, Rangel's bill plays into Bush's hands, said Bill Galvin, head of the anti-war group called the Center for Conscience and War.
[01:13:46.162 --> 01:13:51.727]  At worst, it is a stealth measure intended to supply progressive political cover for the pro-draft Democrats.
[01:13:52.248 --> 01:13:53.589]  And that's exactly what it is.
[01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:54.690]  I couldn't say it any better.
[01:13:56.351 --> 01:13:58.293]  No, that's not why I'm doing it!
[01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:01.556]  I'm doing it because it needs to be fair!
[01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:03.938]  Folks, the Silver Spooners
[01:14:05.185 --> 01:14:06.186]  We'll never go to war.
[01:14:06.266 --> 01:14:19.135]  If they do, they'll be strutting around in, you know, ridiculous monkey suits with tons of salad dressing on them, you know, hundreds of medals out on aircraft carriers, commanding forces.
[01:14:19.936 --> 01:14:26.461]  It'll be your children going into the meat grinders of fighting the Persians and fighting the Syrians.
[01:14:26.481 --> 01:14:27.061]  Let Israel go!
[01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:34.184]  Let all these other people who want to go.
[01:14:34.284 --> 01:14:36.765]  Let Bush send his degenerate daughters.
[01:14:38.305 --> 01:14:39.986]  Don't send our families, by the way.
[01:14:41.926 --> 01:14:45.407]  They even admitted in the Houston Chronicle, they're already drafting doctors.
[01:14:45.487 --> 01:14:47.267]  They're already drafting coroners.
[01:14:47.287 --> 01:14:48.867]  They're already drafting embalmers.
[01:14:50.168 --> 01:14:53.148]  That is, people who served 20 years ago, literally.
[01:14:54.088 --> 01:14:55.129]  I'm sorry, that's not true.
[01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:59.549]  35 years ago, there's one 66-year-old guy from Alabama got drafted.
[01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.730]  And they didn't read the fine print when they
[01:15:02.785 --> 01:15:05.326]  You know, volunteered for Vietnam or Korea.
[01:15:05.586 --> 01:15:07.067]  Oh, yeah, there's even some of those.
[01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:08.467]  But they don't have to leave the country.
[01:15:08.487 --> 01:15:10.888]  They're in advisory capacity here in the U.S.
[01:15:10.908 --> 01:15:11.848]  looking at the data.
[01:15:12.689 --> 01:15:15.150]  But they are sending 60-plus-year-old people to Iraq.
[01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.210]  And they go, you didn't read the contract.
[01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.071]  Now we can recall you anytime.
[01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:24.953]  But some of the draft bills, there's been about, I don't know, eight different versions introduced.
[01:15:25.073 --> 01:15:26.834]  Some are 18 to 49.
[01:15:27.514 --> 01:15:29.455]  Ah, they could draft Alex Jones!
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:36.643]  And I'd be the exact type of person they'd come arrest and Mr. Jones is a coward and be on the local news.
[01:15:37.043 --> 01:15:37.564]  Yeah!
[01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:38.424]  Yeah!
[01:15:38.884 --> 01:15:40.225]  He's refusing to go!
[01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:43.027]  So, so he's in jail!
[01:15:44.187 --> 01:15:45.448]  Who knows, maybe I'd just go.
[01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:49.768]  But then I'd be court-martialed because I wouldn't let him give me an experimental shot.
[01:15:49.808 --> 01:15:51.708]  I'd say that that's an experimental injection.
[01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:52.568]  That's illegal.
[01:15:52.608 --> 01:15:53.308]  That's a felony.
[01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.668]  Federal judges already said so.
[01:15:55.109 --> 01:15:55.989]  Shut up, Jones!
[01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:56.849]  Hold him down!
[01:15:58.449 --> 01:16:01.630]  We're going to send you to DU Cleanup, boy!
[01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:04.230]  Let you clean up some wrecked vehicles.
[01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.190]  How's that sound?
[01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:08.471]  You like the sound of it?
[01:16:08.691 --> 01:16:10.411]  Well, that's what you're going to be doing.
[01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:15.152]  No, I think at that point I may just hop a train to New Zealand.
[01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:17.425]  That's a joke, folks.
[01:16:17.445 --> 01:16:18.926]  There are no trains to New Zealand.
[01:16:22.047 --> 01:16:23.387]  I don't think I'll ever evacuate.
[01:16:23.467 --> 01:16:25.107]  I may evacuate my family, though.
[01:16:25.227 --> 01:16:27.548]  Stuff gets much worse in the next couple of years.
[01:16:28.048 --> 01:16:32.870]  I mean, if Bush takes to nuking cities, we've got a few months to get out, I'll probably evacuate my family.
[01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.170]  I really want to know.
[01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:37.891]  The evacuation has already been prepared, by the way.
[01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:41.532]  Because, I mean, there's nothing my wife and small children can do, really.
[01:16:42.132 --> 01:16:44.553]  I will evacuate them and stay here and go down with the ship.
[01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.271]  These arrogant bastards have got it all figured out, folks.
[01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:57.392]  Carry out a government terror attack, blame it on their political enemies, and then just go, you people who were against the Patriot Act, you caused this to happen!
[01:16:57.672 --> 01:16:59.033]  Now 300,000 are dead!
[01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.393]  The nuke went off!
[01:17:02.253 --> 01:17:03.854]  You're the ones that criticized it!
[01:17:03.894 --> 01:17:06.614]  You didn't give us enough troops to take over Iraq!
[01:17:07.034 --> 01:17:09.735]  And we now know the nuke came from Iraq!
[01:17:10.235 --> 01:17:12.496]  We now know Saddam had planted it!
[01:17:12.536 --> 01:17:13.756]  Here's the document!
[01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:18.618]  Arrest everyone that disagrees with us!
[01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.860]  I've heard Michael Savage on the air.
[01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.121]  You just wait.
[01:17:23.521 --> 01:17:25.523]  You just wait till the bigger attack comes.
[01:17:25.703 --> 01:17:27.404]  And then you're all getting arrested.
[01:17:27.704 --> 01:17:30.285]  Everyone of you is going to a forced labor camp.
[01:17:30.666 --> 01:17:31.366]  You just wait.
[01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:32.847]  If you knew what I knew.
[01:17:33.047 --> 01:17:34.348]  And he starts laughing about it.
[01:17:34.928 --> 01:17:39.071]  Yeah, we knew you were a big, fat, dirty, oily, hippie, beatnik, piece of garbage.
[01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:40.912]  You could deep-fry
[01:17:42.082 --> 01:17:44.767]  Broad chicken just by squeezing what's in his hair, folks.
[01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:52.222]  All of them, all the dirty beatniks of the sixties and the fourth international before it.
[01:17:52.602 --> 01:17:53.905]  All dirty Trotskyites.
[01:17:54.723 --> 01:18:05.025]  All dirty oil bags, all gun-grabbing scum, who couldn't take this country over until they posed as conservatives, and you bought it hook, line, and sinker.
[01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:07.025]  And now they're gonna butcher this country.
[01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:11.886]  They're gonna bust the guts of this country wide open, and you're gonna love them for it.
[01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:14.687]  You're gonna thank them for it when you turn your guns in.
[01:18:14.907 --> 01:18:18.067]  Or maybe you'll get one of the little fancy uniforms and armband.
[01:18:18.228 --> 01:18:20.488]  You can keep your guns, because you're a bootlicker.
[01:18:22.426 --> 01:18:28.709]  And then they'll take your pension fund, but you don't want to complain, because at least you've got the armband, and we've all got a sacrifice.
[01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:35.132]  And you'll give your children to them to be cannon fodder, based on lies.
[01:18:37.793 --> 01:18:39.133]  Alright, I'm in rare form today.
[01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:41.734]  Masses of news, masses of guests, masses of calls.
[01:18:44.256 --> 01:18:46.417]  We'll see if Rangel joins us after this break.
[01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.798]  PresentPlanet.tv.
[01:18:49.238 --> 01:18:49.818]  Check it out.
[01:18:50.578 --> 01:18:51.119]  PresentPlanet.tv.
[01:18:52.904 --> 01:18:58.289]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[01:18:58.449 --> 01:19:06.757]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:19:06.977 --> 01:19:08.579]  More than likely, this includes you.

[01:22:54.077 --> 01:22:59.219]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:59.899 --> 01:23:02.200]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:05.572 --> 01:23:07.933]  We have the Honorable Congressman Rangel on.
[01:23:07.953 --> 01:23:12.615]  He'll be with us about 15 minutes unless one of his bells goes off, meaning he has to run back in and vote.
[01:23:13.515 --> 01:23:14.996]  Never had him on before, we're honored to have him.
[01:23:15.036 --> 01:23:18.918]  He's a highly decorated Korean War veteran himself, bronze star, purple heart.
[01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:33.850]  And I've seen him on television saying, you know, we're going to have this war to make all the rich kids go, but we all know the Silver Spooners will be out on aircraft carriers commanding everyone while our children get their guts blown out on a lie.
[01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:38.974]  And he's introduced this bill again, I think this is the third time he's introduced it, and now we have another article here.
[01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.855]  Military draft back on U.S.
[01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:41.275]  agenda.
[01:23:41.295 --> 01:23:43.476]  I have the Associated Press, other articles.
[01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:45.918]  The United States would have to face a painful dilemma
[01:23:47.134 --> 01:23:51.638]  And that's Joseph Biden, top Democrat, saying we need a national draft.
[01:23:51.698 --> 01:23:54.440]  So, Congressman Rangel, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:56.442]  I'm glad to be with you.
[01:23:57.863 --> 01:23:59.424]  Now, what on earth are you up to?
[01:23:59.444 --> 01:24:00.925]  I mean, you've introduced this bill again.
[01:24:02.226 --> 01:24:14.817]  Well, if we have a foreign policy, which the President truly believes, that we have a mandate to bring freedom and liberty throughout the Middle East and the North Korea,
[01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.754]  Then we have to be prepared to fight for it.
[01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:34.545]  And it just seems to me that this fight should not be just relegated to paying $10,000, $20,000, and $30,000 bonuses to kids that are coming from the poorer communities, to rural areas, and then the city.
[01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:43.651]  It seems to me that we shouldn't have our National Guard and our Reservists, most all of whom have served the country,
[01:24:46.589 --> 01:25:12.607]  First of all, if the President really thinks that Americans believe in this as our foreign policy, why is it that we never hear him ask Americans to make sacrifices and to volunteer and to be placed in harm's way unless he truly believes that this sacrifice should be just relegated to those who can't help themselves?
[01:25:13.513 --> 01:25:24.260]  You know... Sir, I would support your bill if it said that both of Bush's snot-nosed daughters had to wear those gowns made by Michael Dell's wife and to send them into combat wearing those gowns.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.200]  Can we do that?
[01:25:26.161 --> 01:25:38.028]  Well, I think your point is that if the President and the Congress and the Pentagon and the CEOs around this country who support the war really thought that their kids
[01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:42.436]  It was possible that they would be involved in making the sacrifice.
[01:25:42.456 --> 01:25:47.779]  There is no question in my mind that we would shift this foreign policy.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.861]  And we're not maintaining our volunteer levels.
[01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:55.743]  We're not maintaining our retention levels in the military.
[01:25:56.184 --> 01:26:01.987]  Is your National Service Act, is it the same version as I read a year ago?
[01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:11.203]  It is, except Rumsfeld said a year ago that two years wasn't enough to train anybody to be effective.
[01:26:11.703 --> 01:26:18.525]  But because they can't get people to join for three years, they've already reduced the recruitment age to 15 months.
[01:26:18.585 --> 01:26:24.147]  So I've changed it just to that extent, which means that everyone between 18 and 26 are eligible.
[01:26:26.795 --> 01:26:32.858]  Not only for the military, but if they're not selected for the military, then for some other two-year national public service.
[01:26:33.818 --> 01:26:36.720]  And there are no exemptions, male or female.
[01:26:38.221 --> 01:26:39.401]  Well, you've been in combat.
[01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:46.585]  I mean, for those who don't know what it's like, I mean, you would feel good about being part of, and you know it's going to be the poor children of America that are going to be drafted.
[01:26:47.025 --> 01:26:50.306]  I mean, despite the gimmick of, oh, it'll make the rich kids go.
[01:26:50.326 --> 01:26:52.908]  I mean, you want to put them in harm's way for a lie?
[01:26:53.548 --> 01:26:55.189]  I really
[01:26:55.976 --> 01:27:06.645]  I want you to know that unlike the previous draft that provided for all of these exemptions, my bill means that everyone does something.
[01:27:07.446 --> 01:27:11.490]  And in answer to your question would I want them in harm's way, let me make it clear.
[01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:18.536]  We would not have this foreign policy if these people thought that their kids were going to be involved.
[01:27:18.956 --> 01:27:22.840]  I can't for the life of me see how anyone can be for this war.
[01:27:25.408 --> 01:27:29.831]  Well, I want to get to what Charles Rangel really wants here.
[01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:35.415]  Is this, as some are saying, a covert action for the Democratic leadership that is pro-draft?
[01:27:36.056 --> 01:27:37.317]  That's in some of the press reports.
[01:27:37.637 --> 01:27:47.405]  Or are you really throwing down the gauntlet and trying to get out ahead of other bills that Bush has had other Republicans introduce that are the old draft
[01:27:47.805 --> 01:27:55.510]  With the exemptions that I think are wrong, are you trying to get out ahead of it to have your bill be the prominent bill, so a draft does get shot down?
[01:27:55.810 --> 01:28:02.053]  No, the Republican bills don't have any provisions for military service, they just have national public service.
[01:28:02.394 --> 01:28:03.134]  But that's the same thing.
[01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:04.535]  Mine would include everything.
[01:28:05.435 --> 01:28:06.916]  Okay, tell us why you're really doing this.
[01:28:07.217 --> 01:28:14.681]  Okay, when, before the President had made the decision that he was going to have a preemptive strike against Iraq,
[01:28:15.663 --> 01:28:30.166]  I have thought, by introducing my bill, that would cause Americans to say, if we're going to go to war and our kids are going to be involved in it, or our grandkids are going to be involved in it, we pretty much damn ought to know that we are being threatened.
[01:28:31.486 --> 01:28:35.687]  And, of course, the President disregarded letting us know the facts.
[01:28:35.707 --> 01:28:36.867]  Congressman, stay there.
[01:28:36.887 --> 01:28:37.427]  A quick break.
[01:28:37.447 --> 01:28:39.948]  We'll be right back with a final segment with you, some key questions.
[01:28:40.228 --> 01:28:40.648]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.342 --> 01:28:46.343]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.263 --> 01:28:50.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:57.825]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[01:28:58.085 --> 01:29:02.846]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[01:29:02.866 --> 01:29:04.647]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:05.127]  No.
[01:29:05.467 --> 01:29:09.208]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[01:29:09.608 --> 01:29:10.970]  Are all covers the same?
[01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:11.450]  No.
[01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:15.415]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:15.816 --> 01:29:17.938]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:20.762]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.844]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:24.987]  Cool weather brings cool cars!
[01:29:25.407 --> 01:29:26.307]  I don't think so!
[01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:30.268]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[01:29:30.648 --> 01:29:31.648]  Here's your to-do.
[01:29:31.868 --> 01:29:34.629]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[01:29:34.849 --> 01:29:40.470]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:45.011]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[01:29:45.231 --> 01:29:50.051]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to BGFindAShop.com.
[01:29:50.292 --> 01:29:51.752]  That's BGFindAShop.com.
[01:29:52.992 --> 01:29:54.613]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:54.753 --> 01:29:58.875]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:58.995 --> 01:30:01.876]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:01.956 --> 01:30:08.680]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:11.861]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.061 --> 01:30:14.463]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:14.583 --> 01:30:19.305]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:19.485 --> 01:30:34.070]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:40.853]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[01:30:44.354 --> 01:30:44.555]  803-4438.

[01:30:52.342 --> 01:31:00.309]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:01.990]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:02.851]  Now check this out.
[01:31:03.211 --> 01:31:06.635]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:31:06.955 --> 01:31:08.016]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:12.258]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:31:12.538 --> 01:31:13.279]  Your health suffers.
[01:31:13.539 --> 01:31:14.179]  It's that simple.
[01:31:14.519 --> 01:31:16.300]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.481]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[01:31:18.921 --> 01:31:26.885]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[01:31:27.285 --> 01:31:31.347]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[01:31:31.707 --> 01:31:32.268]  Congressman Rangel
[01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:06.354]  Charles Rangel was elected with 94% of the vote in the last election.
[01:32:06.834 --> 01:32:11.297]  One of the most popular members of Congress in his district especially.
[01:32:11.838 --> 01:32:14.480]  And again, a highly decorated veteran in his own right.
[01:32:15.361 --> 01:32:23.387]  And I don't like, you know, period, having a bill introduced for national conscription of our little girls, our little boys.
[01:32:24.007 --> 01:32:25.268]  This is for women as well.
[01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:28.791]  But he says, as you just heard him say, that he's doing this to
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:39.802]  Throw down the gauntlet and say, come on, send your daughters, Bush, send your little spoiled brats, those are my words, not his, go ahead and send them to Iraq.
[01:32:39.842 --> 01:32:43.523]  Let's send the Enron chief's children over there.
[01:32:44.023 --> 01:32:47.784]  But I guarantee you, folks, they'll use this bill and then selectively enforce it.
[01:32:48.184 --> 01:32:49.244]  That's why it's dangerous.
[01:32:49.284 --> 01:32:55.045]  But Congressman Rangel, anything else you'd like to say on the draft itself before I throw out three final questions?
[01:32:55.585 --> 01:33:01.046]  We can't, first of all, you don't have a draft unless the people believe in the war.
[01:33:01.106 --> 01:33:09.488]  In other words, if we would have a draft, people would know that the president would shift his responsibility.
[01:33:09.968 --> 01:33:24.431]  The direction we're going, where we pay people to volunteer, it would not surprise, and we do have a lot of non-citizens, especially in my district, we have a large number of Dominicans, and we've got young people who are not citizens, and they know that
[01:33:25.621 --> 01:33:27.305]  Uh, they can improve their quality of life.
[01:33:27.325 --> 01:33:35.582]  So we got non-citizens, poor people fighting the war, and I say a draft brings some equality to it, or causes us to shift our foreign policy.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:43.642]  Because I don't see how you can support the war and think that all we can do is just hold these kids' coats and let them do all of the fighting.
[01:33:43.902 --> 01:33:45.382]  Were you drafted into Korea?
[01:33:45.702 --> 01:33:46.783]  No, I volunteered.
[01:33:47.123 --> 01:33:53.204]  My brother volunteered before World War II because he couldn't get a job.
[01:33:53.324 --> 01:33:58.486]  I saw, when he got out of the army, how much my parents were dependent on the Czech.
[01:33:58.546 --> 01:33:58.926]  And so in 1948,
[01:34:00.598 --> 01:34:06.944]  I joined the Army, I had no idea that I would be surrounded by Chinese in 1950, being wounded.
[01:34:07.584 --> 01:34:13.210]  But, you know, I thank God, even though 90% of the casualties we suffered in the 2nd Infantry Division.
[01:34:13.710 --> 01:34:19.015]  And I might add, the division went over from Fort Lewis, Washington in 1950, and guess what?
[01:34:19.395 --> 01:34:20.156]  They're still there.
[01:34:20.871 --> 01:34:21.752]  But I got the G.I.
[01:34:21.812 --> 01:34:24.214]  Bill and went back to school.
[01:34:24.274 --> 01:34:31.999]  You know, 90%, 90% casualties, the only other place we've seen those numbers were in German U-Boat men, sailors.
[01:34:32.019 --> 01:34:32.940]  No, listen.
[01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:48.472]  If this story was ever told, how MacArthur and Truman, while they're fighting each other over whether or not to go to China, the entire 8th Army, which included my division, which included the Marines, was surrounded by tens of thousands of Chinese.
[01:34:49.361 --> 01:34:51.061]  I mean, how that could happen?
[01:34:51.081 --> 01:34:52.101]  I thought it was two million.
[01:34:53.242 --> 01:34:57.322]  Well, it was two million altogether, but we were surrounded in a mountain pass.
[01:34:57.382 --> 01:35:01.443]  We were sitting on the Yellow River, waiting to go home.
[01:35:02.183 --> 01:35:05.604]  And it was the most massive defeat we've ever had.
[01:35:06.224 --> 01:35:11.825]  And, you know, in Vietnam, it wasn't the president that caused that war to stop.
[01:35:11.885 --> 01:35:14.965]  It was the people, and that's why Johnson quit.
[01:35:15.346 --> 01:35:17.926]  And this draft idea is to get people to know
[01:35:18.516 --> 01:35:31.361]  But, you know, we have tens of thousands, a hundred thousand Iraqis that have been killed over there, and these people, for the most part, just got caught in the battlefield between the so-called terrorists and then the American troops.
[01:35:31.481 --> 01:35:44.806]  And, you know, how do you expect that you can send a trained military person into a country, he has no idea what the enemy looks like, what flag he wears, what uniform he wears, where he's going to be,
[01:35:45.777 --> 01:35:57.775]  And they are on the brink of a civil war, and we've lost 1,600 American lives, 12,000 kids are maimed, and hundreds of marriages completely destroyed.
[01:35:58.288 --> 01:36:04.013]  As middle-aged men and women, I have grandparents that are in the National Guard that just came back from Iraq.
[01:36:04.073 --> 01:36:05.654]  This is immoral!
[01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:06.595]  It's immoral!
[01:36:06.795 --> 01:36:09.117]  And Congressman, my three questions here.
[01:36:09.717 --> 01:36:18.104]  Number one, where do you see the Iraq war going when the armies, all their top experts said it will fail, it will fail unless we have a half a million troops.
[01:36:18.664 --> 01:36:30.766]  Bush said, I don't care and did it, and they knew all along this was going to happen, and I've read policy reports where they want a quagmire as an excuse to play this out over ten years, like Vietnam, to make money off of it.
[01:36:31.427 --> 01:36:43.269]  Well, I hate to believe that anybody would put our kids deliberately in harm's way just for a buck, but the truth of the matter is that we have to be able to convince the world that terrorism is not just
[01:36:44.376 --> 01:36:45.557]  United States problem.
[01:36:45.897 --> 01:36:49.960]  All of the civilized nations of the world face this type of thing.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.904]  And so we're going to have to get them to come in and to train Iraqis how to defend their country.
[01:36:56.204 --> 01:37:04.950]  They cannot depend on our dwindling human resources to bring liberty and freedom to a country that has not done it before.
[01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:09.413]  So now we've played the part of the bad cop, and the good cop, the UN is going to come in and save us.
[01:37:10.515 --> 01:37:12.377]  Well, I think it's saving the world.
[01:37:12.477 --> 01:37:19.083]  You know, we've had a whole lot of decisions made because of oil between Great Britain and the United States.
[01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:19.424]  I know.
[01:37:19.724 --> 01:37:24.508]  And there's no question that... Well, where do you see the Iraq War going then?
[01:37:24.528 --> 01:37:25.930]  You're saying you think it'll be U.N.
[01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:26.410]  takeover?
[01:37:27.391 --> 01:37:30.974]  Not necessarily the U.N., but certainly the international community.
[01:37:30.994 --> 01:37:33.457]  So a multinational I-4 type force?
[01:37:34.122 --> 01:37:41.584]  And we have to make, this morning I had a special meeting with the African leaders because I had a trade bill, I was at the White House with the President.
[01:37:42.185 --> 01:37:44.965]  And a lot of people don't know, a lot of those Africans are Muslims.
[01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:47.526]  They are friends, they are trading partners.
[01:37:48.006 --> 01:37:55.869]  If only we could learn more about the Islamic religion, so that we're not being portrayed against Jews and Christians against Muslims.
[01:37:56.314 --> 01:37:59.636]  But we don't have a sophistication in our foreign policy.
[01:38:00.016 --> 01:38:04.459]  The terrorists tell them here they gotta come here, they gotta kill the young and they gotta blow up your buildings.
[01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:06.920]  Congressman, we're almost out of time with you.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:09.942]  We've got to take an international approach to get out of this.
[01:38:10.142 --> 01:38:13.644]  These two final questions for you, Congressman.
[01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:21.484]  Twenty-five percent of our troops in Iraq were illegal aliens from Latin America and other countries.
[01:38:21.824 --> 01:38:23.366]  That's the federal government's own numbers.
[01:38:23.866 --> 01:38:30.613]  I mean, the last time this happened was the British, with their German Hessian mercs, freebooters, brought in
[01:38:31.727 --> 01:38:35.909]  Uh, to go up against, uh, the American people in 1776 and 1812.
[01:38:35.969 --> 01:38:38.670]  I mean, this is out of control!
[01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:42.672]  Down on the Texas border, in Mexico, they've got recruiting offices.
[01:38:43.052 --> 01:38:50.235]  I mean, what does this mean when our government, uh, is accelerating towards the majority of our military, not even being Americans?
[01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:56.438]  Well, you know when we had the so-called willing coalition, when 95% of the troops there were Americans?
[01:38:56.929 --> 01:39:09.952]  We went to the smallest African countries and Central American countries and Caribbean countries, and actually paid them to send a hundred troops, a thousand troops over, and they call it the Willing Coalition.
[01:39:10.012 --> 01:39:16.633]  So, it would be a sad day in American history when we go to foreigners and ask them to fight our battles.
[01:39:17.193 --> 01:39:26.535]  And I tell you, if this was something... I'm 75 years old, and I'm telling you, if I ever thought my country was threatened, I could volunteer to do something.
[01:39:27.262 --> 01:39:41.087]  And the whole idea that the President cannot make a patriotic appeal for people to join to defend the United States in the free world shows that they have no sensitivity for those that they got right there because of bonuses.
[01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:43.148]  Well, last question, sir.
[01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:45.429]  Where is it going to go?
[01:39:45.449 --> 01:39:47.590]  What is going to happen
[01:39:48.405 --> 01:40:08.669]  When we've got our troops in this radioactive DU wasteland, the Army's own documents admitted, the Army's got 50% plus recruitment losses, even with lowered numbers, the Marines have got 25% with lowered numbers, everything's falling apart, the death toll is rising, and Bush is talking about going into Iran.
[01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:11.369]  I mean, what's going to happen with the draft?
[01:40:11.409 --> 01:40:13.590]  You've introduced the bill for men and women.
[01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:15.710]  It may not be the draft that's going to happen.
[01:40:16.130 --> 01:40:29.100]  But the same way the American people got fed up with our Americans dying in Vietnam, we were told by Johnson and Nixon and all of them that if we didn't win in Vietnam, there'd be a domino theory, the Communists would take over that part of the world.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.882]  The truth is, we got treaties now with Vietnam.
[01:40:32.543 --> 01:40:35.725]  And we're dealing with them, and Communism is not an issue.
[01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:46.088]  The American people are going to get fed up with this war and we're going to find some way to get the international community to train those people and take care of their own country.
[01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:47.309]  What about George Galloway?
[01:40:47.349 --> 01:40:56.478]  Did you hear about how they told those lies about him in the Congress and tried to claim he got money for oil but it turned out that he didn't do anything and he's now winning libel suits?
[01:40:57.366 --> 01:41:02.328]  I can't begin to tell you what the difference between the lies, the misinformation they got.
[01:41:02.748 --> 01:41:09.551]  They have, you know, there was a group, I know you don't have much time, called the Project for a New American... No, we've got time for you, sir.
[01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:09.891]  Go ahead.
[01:41:10.251 --> 01:41:18.995]  Well, you know, two years before this war, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, the guy Bolton that they're trying to get... Jeb Bush.
[01:41:19.475 --> 01:41:19.995]  Jeb Bush.
[01:41:20.055 --> 01:41:21.416]  They all had decided
[01:41:21.929 --> 01:41:25.571]  That they were going to knock off this Saddam Hussein anyway.
[01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:27.812]  Did you hear Bush's biographer just came out?
[01:41:28.413 --> 01:41:30.474]  Yes, with the same type of information.
[01:41:30.534 --> 01:41:36.237]  And so, the 9-1-1 was just an excuse to do what they had already decided to do.
[01:41:36.737 --> 01:41:43.741]  And they thought they could go in this and slam damn thank you ma'am, knock this guy over, and America wouldn't know anything about it.
[01:41:43.801 --> 01:41:50.025]  Well, just like you drive a car by mistake into a rental car agency and those spikes come out of the ground,
[01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:51.909]  And that's what happened to us.
[01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:54.810]  You know, the President said that we had won the war.
[01:41:55.170 --> 01:42:00.432]  Well, we may have won knocking off Saddam Hussein, but we didn't win in terms of how the hell we get out.
[01:42:00.832 --> 01:42:08.334]  And American people now are down to 43% in support of the President's foreign policy, and it's getting lower every day.
[01:42:08.694 --> 01:42:11.635]  When Americans get angry, they get to the Congress.
[01:42:11.675 --> 01:42:12.416]  We're vulnerable.
[01:42:12.456 --> 01:42:13.896]  We've got a two-year contract.
[01:42:14.316 --> 01:42:17.300]  And if we want to be here, we've got to listen to our constituents.
[01:42:29.313 --> 01:42:31.094]  What if there's another terror attack?
[01:42:31.134 --> 01:42:43.477]  What if the military industrial complex either opens the door or even worse is involved in some pretext you know like the RAF got caught bombing Saddam before the Gulf War II beginning to strike back.
[01:42:43.797 --> 01:42:44.577]  What if that happens?
[01:42:44.617 --> 01:42:46.457]  Isn't that the threat for escalation?
[01:42:46.737 --> 01:42:48.778]  He said yes that's a very real threat.
[01:42:48.818 --> 01:42:49.438]  What do you say?
[01:42:49.918 --> 01:42:56.560]  I say it is a threat because there is a common tendency that you have one president and one commander-in-chief and
[01:42:57.176 --> 01:43:00.717]  If you're wrong, you gotta be on the side of the President.
[01:43:00.777 --> 01:43:02.158]  Give him the benefit of the doubt.
[01:43:02.598 --> 01:43:06.420]  I voted against the war, but quite frankly, I was scared to death that I could have been wrong.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:11.442]  I was afraid that maybe there was information they had that they didn't share with the Congress.
[01:43:11.522 --> 01:43:14.743]  But do you think they might bring out more fake evidence again to bolster?
[01:43:14.763 --> 01:43:17.644]  Do you think they might open the door for terrorists?
[01:43:17.664 --> 01:43:19.045]  A lot of evidence shows that happened.
[01:43:19.225 --> 01:43:22.226]  Let me make it clear that if I could find in my heart
[01:43:23.021 --> 01:43:25.242]  That that did happen, it can happen again.
[01:43:25.262 --> 01:43:28.703]  I would not hesitate to file a petition for impeachment.
[01:43:30.064 --> 01:43:32.284]  Well, I'm sure you've heard that from your constituents.
[01:43:32.804 --> 01:43:34.765]  A major zombie poll in New York.
[01:43:34.845 --> 01:43:48.210]  It's evidence that a president would deliberately put American lives in conflict when we have no threat to our national security in order just to accomplish his own agenda that was written before he was president.
[01:43:48.965 --> 01:43:50.326]  That is ground for impeachment.
[01:43:50.366 --> 01:44:02.732]  Well, sir, we have the Downing Street memos, we have all these articles coming out where we have their own memos where they knew he wasn't a threat and they said they had to go to war, so isn't there, are you calling for impeachment?
[01:44:03.512 --> 01:44:11.556]  No, but I am saying this, that the president denies that the FBI papers and the CIA papers say they received bad information.
[01:44:12.016 --> 01:44:16.939]  The only thing they say is that everyone had bad information, but there's no one that is actually
[01:44:17.577 --> 01:44:24.104]  Given evidence that the President acknowledged that this information was bad and deliberately took us to war.
[01:44:24.564 --> 01:44:41.441]  I know the facts point in that direction, but I think impeachment, unlike what the Republicans did to Clinton for his ridiculous sex acts, that impeachment is something that's too serious for us to belittle and just to use it for political purposes.
[01:44:42.324 --> 01:44:47.728]  Well, I mean, what about impeachment for Dick Cheney running the contracts for the war out of the VP's office?
[01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:48.389]  That's admitted.
[01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:53.853]  Well, impeachment is a very serious offense.
[01:44:53.953 --> 01:45:00.338]  But public, the more people know about what occurred with this administration, especially before the re-election,
[01:45:01.115 --> 01:45:05.059]  The more democracy will work and pressure will be put on.
[01:45:05.439 --> 01:45:10.804]  The same way Johnson walked away from Vietnam, he just couldn't face the electorate when they found it out.
[01:45:10.984 --> 01:45:15.468]  So, in a nutshell, if I can get the soundbite from you, Congressman, tell me if this is correct.
[01:45:15.568 --> 01:45:22.254]  You're saying you don't think we'll have a draft because this war has become so unpopular, we're going to be forced to pull out of there.
[01:45:23.175 --> 01:45:27.539]  I think that's exactly what I'm saying, and I think that the silence of our
[01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:28.611]  I don't
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:58.206]  And I think that it's time for people just to say that our president, this administration, and the Congress should be held accountable for every life that's being lost in the Middle East right now.
[01:45:58.226 --> 01:46:11.253]  Congressman Rangel, it's pretty obvious when Pinak says we need a Pearl Harbor event to mobilize the people to attack Saddam, he's not a threat, but he's got the oil, and we'll say he's a threat, and we'll use
[01:46:11.793 --> 01:46:16.297]  I do, but I don't think we find too many people without a keen sense of spelling in this country.
[01:46:31.347 --> 01:46:42.979]  All right, Congressman Rangel, I really appreciate you coming on and spending so much time with us, and I guess if folks want to visit your website or information, they can just go to the House of Representatives website and type in Rangel.
[01:46:43.239 --> 01:46:43.980]  Exactly.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:44.961]  It's a great show.
[01:46:44.981 --> 01:46:45.642]  You're a great host.
[01:46:45.822 --> 01:46:47.143]  Thank you for having me on it.
[01:46:47.404 --> 01:46:48.284]  Thank you, Congressman.
[01:46:48.304 --> 01:46:48.625]  Take care.
[01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:55.393]  Well, I meant to kind of get mad at him, and I did a little bit, but he was honest with us on most issues.
[01:46:55.573 --> 01:46:59.955]  And you notice he said the UN or the international community is going to come save us in Iraq.
[01:47:01.835 --> 01:47:02.936]  I saw that before the war.
[01:47:02.956 --> 01:47:05.577]  I mean, I'm on record two years before the war saying that's what happened.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:14.305]  Folks, Rangel, he smells a big rat, and he said that not many of us have that keen sense of smell.
[01:47:14.926 --> 01:47:18.189]  So he wouldn't go as far as Galloway, but we got some good nuggets out of him.
[01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:21.712]  I know Debbie's been holding for ten minutes because the guests went ten minutes over.
[01:47:21.732 --> 01:47:24.515]  I know we got callers out the...
[01:47:26.181 --> 01:47:27.602]  Wazoo wanting to come on.
[01:47:27.622 --> 01:47:28.782]  We're going to get to you too.
[01:47:28.902 --> 01:47:29.902]  Masses of news.
[01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:31.723]  Jam-packed broadcast today.
[01:47:31.983 --> 01:47:32.763]  Is Debbie still there?
[01:47:33.124 --> 01:47:33.784]  I'm here.
[01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:35.164]  Sweetie Pie, thanks for holding.
[01:47:35.424 --> 01:47:38.906]  I was so interested in listening, I could have held forever.
[01:47:39.086 --> 01:47:41.687]  Well, I tell you, I've been trying to get you on the last week.
[01:47:42.167 --> 01:47:45.948]  We need to get people to stop drinking this poison water and to support this broadcast.
[01:47:46.228 --> 01:47:47.429]  Tell folks about Big Berkey.
[01:47:47.809 --> 01:47:49.629]  Well, first off, how have you been doing?
[01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:52.110]  I'm doing much better, thank you very much.
[01:47:52.451 --> 01:47:53.571]  Been doing great now.
[01:47:54.178 --> 01:47:56.379]  You had a wonderful trip to South Dakota.
[01:47:56.399 --> 01:48:00.101]  I highly recommend everybody to take their family there.
[01:48:00.161 --> 01:48:01.281]  What a wonderful trip.
[01:48:02.001 --> 01:48:04.582]  I know your Papa passed away just a month or two ago.
[01:48:05.083 --> 01:48:06.523]  Yeah, yeah, he did.
[01:48:06.623 --> 01:48:09.164]  And it's been kind of a tough time, you know.
[01:48:09.184 --> 01:48:12.446]  You get through all kinds of adjustments and stuff.
[01:48:12.506 --> 01:48:14.967]  So a vacation was much needed.
[01:48:15.167 --> 01:48:17.668]  So taking the long memorial weekend was real good.
[01:48:20.586 --> 01:48:22.587]  We need to keep drinking tap water.
[01:48:22.667 --> 01:48:23.587]  I think it's nutritious.
[01:48:23.627 --> 01:48:24.767]  Why shouldn't I drink tap water?
[01:48:25.367 --> 01:48:27.648]  Because of the poison they add to it.
[01:48:27.688 --> 01:48:31.809]  You know, water is nutritious, but chlorine certainly isn't.
[01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:41.471]  And all the other additives like carbon tetrachloride, you know, that sounds like a really yummy thing to have added to your water.
[01:48:42.211 --> 01:48:43.972]  Things like that are not good for you.
[01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:48.833]  And, you know, in today's day and time, we're used to being convenient.
[01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:53.002]  And getting water right out of our tap is very convenient.
[01:48:53.682 --> 01:49:01.288]  Buying bottled water at the grocery store is very convenient in a way if you don't mind lugging gallons of water to your house.
[01:49:02.129 --> 01:49:10.476]  But the best thing is to have a Berkey water filter because you can take your tap water, put it right through your Berkey and have good drinking water all the time.
[01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:16.756]  Well, we're going to tell folks real quickly after the break how they can get some of these different units.
[01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:17.597]  It's what I use.
[01:49:17.997 --> 01:49:18.937]  It's what you should use.
[01:49:18.997 --> 01:49:22.479]  But bottom line, take Austin, Texas, known for having better water.
[01:49:23.039 --> 01:49:25.000]  I've talked to pool guys, hot tub guys.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.501]  I've talked to friends that have pools.
[01:49:27.221 --> 01:49:35.145]  They make the joke, because it's true, that when you fill your pool, it needs no chlorine, no nothing.
[01:49:35.625 --> 01:49:40.187]  In fact, sometimes you've got to put stuff in to lessen it because the chlorine is so strong.
[01:49:41.519 --> 01:49:47.823]  And I've actually made a call to a pool supply place, and the guy didn't want to come on air, he says, you know, but he says it's true.
[01:49:48.524 --> 01:49:50.525]  So why are you drinking pool water, folks?
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:50:00.063]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.383 --> 01:50:01.743]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:01.943 --> 01:50:04.144]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.304 --> 01:50:06.385]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.665 --> 01:50:11.607]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:11.927 --> 01:50:15.989]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:17.991]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:28.723]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.883 --> 01:50:30.746]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.206 --> 01:50:31.687]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.585 --> 01:50:52.785]  I think?
[01:51:11.032 --> 01:51:11.372]  I think?
[01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:29.770]  Thanks for watching!
[01:51:52.853 --> 01:51:59.820]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:05.726]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X nail gel.
[01:52:06.127 --> 01:52:16.097]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:52:16.257 --> 01:52:18.678]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:22.019]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost purple.
[01:52:22.099 --> 01:52:23.660]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:31.283]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:52:31.543 --> 01:52:33.264]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:52:33.624 --> 01:52:44.909]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:52:45.869 --> 01:52:50.413]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:52:54.476 --> 01:53:06.005]  I want to play this little three minute clip coming up in the next hour where the head of the Judiciary Committee throws a fit and walks off.
[01:53:07.926 --> 01:53:13.631]  Because real questions were being raised about the Patriot Act that's set to be radically expanded.
[01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:16.401]  And folks, there is so much other news.
[01:53:16.601 --> 01:53:20.703]  World taxation is just an inch away.
[01:53:21.403 --> 01:53:23.544]  They're trying to sneak this through on us right now.
[01:53:23.564 --> 01:53:26.425]  I know we got Jeff and Richard and Patrick and David.
[01:53:27.186 --> 01:53:32.648]  I'm sorry you guys have been holding so long and I haven't gotten to you, but we had Rangel on and now we got Debbie and it's just important info.
[01:53:33.088 --> 01:53:39.331]  Very briefly here, this week's showing of Martial Law has sold out.
[01:53:39.831 --> 01:53:40.992]  It sold out last week.
[01:53:42.099 --> 01:53:43.520]  I'm just now getting around to telling you this.
[01:53:44.521 --> 01:53:47.624]  Next Week's hasn't sold out yet, as of yesterday.
[01:53:48.465 --> 01:53:51.567]  There are about half the tickets left for next Thursday's showing.
[01:53:51.948 --> 01:53:53.349]  But that won't last long.
[01:53:53.729 --> 01:53:59.994]  So go to InfoWars.com, link through, the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, their nicest theater, I love it.
[01:54:00.295 --> 01:54:01.956]  I'll be there speaking all that good stuff.
[01:54:03.097 --> 01:54:05.139]  8 o'clock next Thursday.
[01:54:06.477 --> 01:54:06.697]  The 23rd.
[01:54:06.837 --> 01:54:12.301]  And if you want a hard copy of this film, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:13.601 --> 01:54:20.025]  Or order a copy of Martial Law or any of my films at infowars.com or presentplanet.com.
[01:54:20.806 --> 01:54:21.746]  It is so important.
[01:54:21.766 --> 01:54:23.247]  This is such an effective film.
[01:54:23.687 --> 01:54:25.128]  It's great at waking people up.
[01:54:25.188 --> 01:54:26.709]  It's my best video ever.
[01:54:26.789 --> 01:54:27.510]  You need to have it.
[01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.590]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:41.576]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch all my films and read my book, my weekly TV reports, everything right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:54:42.216 --> 01:54:57.025]  Debbie, here in the last few minutes we've got left in this hour, you've got little sports bottles, you've got big 3 and 4 gallon filters, you've got 2 gallon filters, all easy to put together, take about a minute and a half, made in America, you've got made in England and people want that.
[01:54:57.406 --> 01:54:59.467]  Are you still offering that insane special?
[01:55:00.183 --> 01:55:01.564]  Actually, yes, we are.
[01:55:02.044 --> 01:55:09.788]  You can get five Berkey sport bottles for $99, so the generic labeled ones, instead of the $39 apiece.
[01:55:09.828 --> 01:55:12.610]  So that's a really good special.
[01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:21.034]  And of course, we have our Berkey water bottles, you know, the regular Berkey light special that we like to maintain for your listeners.
[01:55:21.654 --> 01:55:24.396]  Specifically, we have changed it up a little bit.
[01:55:24.816 --> 01:55:27.357]  We've got the Berkey light with the lights for $259.
[01:55:29.153 --> 01:55:42.385]  And you get a generic Berkey Sport bottle, which is the $39 value, and you get an XLR battery adapter, so that's real handy to have in case, you know, power outages and things like that.
[01:55:42.893 --> 01:55:45.595]  And again, the filter itself doesn't have any moving parts.
[01:55:45.635 --> 01:55:54.603]  It has like a hub for cell phones and solar charger and these lights that burn for 14 years built into that unit.
[01:55:54.903 --> 01:55:57.405]  What about that special you were given on the stainless steel unit?
[01:55:57.805 --> 01:56:00.928]  The stainless steel unit, it's our 3-gallon Berkey.
[01:56:01.668 --> 01:56:04.190]  It's a brand new one that we're just coming out with.
[01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:05.371]  Amazing deal!
[01:56:05.411 --> 01:56:06.472]  Tell folks how much that is.
[01:56:07.413 --> 01:56:12.417]  It's $225 and it comes with two of the ceramic interior filters in it.
[01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:15.692]  It is expandable to four filters.
[01:56:16.633 --> 01:56:18.414]  It holds three gallons.
[01:56:18.534 --> 01:56:23.297]  It's a beautiful, embossed, very, very pretty piece of kitchen equipment.
[01:56:23.577 --> 01:56:26.059]  Normally that would be, what, three hundred and something?
[01:56:26.339 --> 01:56:30.762]  It would be, and we're only going to have those available until we run out.
[01:56:30.802 --> 01:56:32.203]  We have about twelve left.
[01:56:33.098 --> 01:56:34.299]  Okay, folks, here's the number.
[01:56:34.859 --> 01:56:37.061]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[01:56:37.081 --> 01:56:39.683]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:56:41.285 --> 01:56:42.005]  Here's the number.
[01:56:42.025 --> 01:56:43.446]  888-803-4438.
[01:56:44.607 --> 01:56:50.712]  These are great for cooking, too, because you'll have, you know, three gallons or more.
[01:56:51.012 --> 01:56:52.794]  This takes a few hours to get three gallons.
[01:56:53.554 --> 01:56:59.738]  888-803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com and tell them what free gifts you want.
[01:57:00.158 --> 01:57:01.419]  They're in the comments section.
[01:57:01.439 --> 01:57:02.459]  888-803-4438.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.322]  And if you call and the phone's busy, leave your name and number, Debbie will call you right back.
[01:57:08.342 --> 01:57:08.382]  888-803-4438.
[01:57:08.482 --> 01:57:10.203]  Debbie, they better give you a call.
[01:57:13.385 --> 01:57:14.986]  Stay better, and I'm here.
[01:57:15.126 --> 01:57:21.507]  And also, if they get my machine, please leave their name and number twice, and I'll be getting back with them as soon as I can.
[01:57:21.708 --> 01:57:22.948]  There's the phone!
[01:57:23.108 --> 01:57:23.988]  Alright, see you Debbie.
[01:57:24.008 --> 01:57:24.368]  Take care.
[01:57:24.448 --> 01:57:24.868]  Take care.
[01:57:24.888 --> 01:57:25.249]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:25.309 --> 01:57:35.031]  She's a great lady, folks, and I feel good supporting this network, supporting this show, by selling the highest quality water filters that I myself use.
[01:57:35.592 --> 01:57:37.772]  You're insane if you don't take advantage of this deal.
[01:57:38.152 --> 01:57:39.573]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:39.593 --> 01:57:39.993]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.151 --> 01:57:50.134]  Hello folks, Alex... Big Brother.
[01:57:50.814 --> 01:57:51.854]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.575 --> 01:57:53.695]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.335 --> 01:57:55.136]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.916 --> 01:57:56.796]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.816 --> 01:58:01.238]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.658 --> 01:58:05.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:12.364]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, into hour number three.
[01:58:12.424 --> 01:58:15.446]  I mean, the last two hours just blasted past.
[01:58:15.806 --> 01:58:18.148]  I think that's the fastest two hours I've ever spent.
[01:58:18.168 --> 01:58:21.070]  I got a long week ahead of me.
[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:22.991]  About 50 radio interviews.
[01:58:24.532 --> 01:58:26.914]  Coast to coast for four hours Thursday night.
[01:58:27.955 --> 01:58:32.097]  After I do a showing of martial law and give a speech and question and answer.
[01:58:33.178 --> 01:58:37.941]  But I got plenty of hours of sleep this weekend and I'm just fired up.
[01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:38.502]  What about you?
[01:58:39.997 --> 01:58:43.560]  Got news here about second case of mad cow possible.
[01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:47.744]  Also, world taxation, a new sneaky way they're trying to get that.
[01:58:48.324 --> 01:58:52.428]  We had a wrangle on, congressman, about the national draft that Bush needs.
[01:58:53.632 --> 01:58:56.255]  But right now, let's go to your calls you've been holding too long.
[01:58:56.275 --> 01:58:58.437]  We'll get these calls out of the way and then go back into the news.
[01:58:58.537 --> 01:59:00.039]  Jeff in Texas, go ahead Jeff.
[01:59:00.439 --> 01:59:04.684]  Hey Alex, how can you dare say that there's going to be a national draft?
[01:59:04.764 --> 01:59:11.031]  President Bush told me less than a year ago on national TV, the talk of the draft was just something out on the internet.
[01:59:12.048 --> 01:59:14.509]  Well, then he said there's going to be a national draft.
[01:59:14.829 --> 01:59:16.409]  We're going to have national conscription.
[01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.389]  I mean, I mean, no draft, no draft!
[01:59:18.690 --> 01:59:20.310]  Did you ever hear that Freudian slip?
[01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:21.130]  Yeah.
[01:59:21.170 --> 01:59:23.491]  Look, they've introduced, they've introduced the bills.
[01:59:24.271 --> 01:59:25.411]  The bills are in there.
[01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:29.492]  And you just heard Rangel, but we're still conspiracy theorists.
[01:59:29.892 --> 01:59:38.074]  I can't believe Rangel was actually that forthcoming, or even that he came on your show, which is a sign to me that things in Washington are very, very volatile right now.
[01:59:39.375 --> 01:59:40.516]  I had a question for you, though.
[01:59:40.556 --> 01:59:42.097]  Yeah, did you hear how nice Rangel was?
[01:59:42.377 --> 01:59:43.657]  Yeah, he was really good.
[01:59:43.898 --> 01:59:45.118]  Did you hear what he said when I brought up 9-11?
[01:59:45.238 --> 01:59:47.379]  Well, I didn't know he was a veteran.
[01:59:47.419 --> 01:59:48.460]  Yeah, I did hear what you said.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.601]  That may be a flip on his part, I don't know.
[01:59:51.421 --> 01:59:52.842]  But I did have a question for you.
[01:59:52.902 --> 01:59:56.424]  I came across an interview from 2001 with a guy named Daniel Sheehan.
[01:59:56.464 --> 01:59:58.965]  I don't know if you know who he is, but... That rings a bell.
[01:59:59.165 --> 02:00:03.347]  Yeah, yeah, he was a legal counsel in some of the Iran counter-proceedings and such.
[02:00:03.812 --> 02:00:14.572]  He basically laid out in this interview the pyramidal power structure of the whole Bush Cabal, and he said it rolls up to a guy named Theodore Shackley, who is, I guess, one of the founding members of the CIA.
[02:00:15.546 --> 02:00:18.907]  Who Bush 41 was basically a student of.
[02:00:19.667 --> 02:00:23.027]  I know who Shackley is, but that's not the top.
[02:00:23.407 --> 02:00:25.988]  These guys are managers for the big money.
[02:00:26.708 --> 02:00:31.569]  The top is the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royal family.
[02:00:31.869 --> 02:00:34.129]  The top really is the Queen of England.
[02:00:35.090 --> 02:00:38.610]  Where did the Bush pyramid structure fit in with Rockefeller then?
[02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:40.531]  Well, I mean, Bush Sr.
[02:00:40.591 --> 02:00:42.251]  said he's a Rockefeller Republican.
[02:00:43.438 --> 02:00:45.139]  And they all work for the same people.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.243]  And then the Queen of England owns the big tabloids that puts out the propaganda that she's a joke.
[02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:52.204]  When she owns half of Canada.
[02:00:52.524 --> 02:00:55.387]  She owns BP, she owns Burger King, she just sold it.
[02:00:55.787 --> 02:00:57.969]  She owns, you name it, she owns it!
[02:00:58.529 --> 02:01:03.973]  Shopping mall chains, apartment chains, oil companies, weapons manufacturers.
[02:01:05.134 --> 02:01:10.258]  Yeah, I've heard different... Look, they're so powerful, their own people don't even know what a real name is.
[02:01:11.481 --> 02:01:16.267]  Where do the European powers who openly come out against Bush?
[02:01:16.507 --> 02:01:18.929]  How do they get hit off against Bush?
[02:01:18.949 --> 02:01:20.331]  Hold on, let me tell you.
[02:01:20.631 --> 02:01:22.974]  We're the bad cop, they play the part of the good cop.
[02:01:22.994 --> 02:01:23.795]  Did you hear Rangel?
[02:01:24.696 --> 02:01:27.358]  The international force will save Iraq!
[02:01:27.779 --> 02:01:29.661]  I said two years before, that's the plan.
[02:01:30.675 --> 02:01:34.277]  So is it the Queens pulling the strings, pitting them off against each other?
[02:01:34.578 --> 02:01:36.099]  They're not even pitting off, sir.
[02:01:36.159 --> 02:01:38.640]  They have to act like there's a good cop and a bad cop.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:40.281]  You know what a good cop and a bad cop is, don't you?
[02:01:40.501 --> 02:01:41.622]  That's nuts.
[02:01:41.642 --> 02:01:43.123]  They're dialecticians, I understand that.
[02:01:43.143 --> 02:01:46.045]  Well, yeah, no, it's where one cop goes, I'm gonna crack your skull, punk.
[02:01:46.345 --> 02:01:48.246]  You don't answer the questions and he punches you.
[02:01:48.266 --> 02:01:50.608]  Then the other cop comes in and he goes, hey, get back, Mac.
[02:01:50.648 --> 02:01:51.769]  You can't abuse this young man.
[02:01:52.009 --> 02:01:54.931]  Listen, I can barely hold him back, but you gotta give me the answers.
[02:01:55.651 --> 02:01:57.412]  Well, whatever they're doing, it's not working.
[02:01:57.672 --> 02:01:59.994]  And to me... It's actually working like a charm.
[02:02:00.734 --> 02:02:02.760]  Yeah, well... I mean, why are you saying it's not working?
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:08.244]  Well, because we were talking about the same thing about the draft and a false flag attack a year ago.
[02:02:08.284 --> 02:02:09.865]  They should have pulled it off by now, Mike.
[02:02:10.025 --> 02:02:10.445]  Oh, no, no.
[02:02:10.525 --> 02:02:11.126]  I'll say this.
[02:02:11.266 --> 02:02:13.448]  I mean, their plans are going well.
[02:02:13.628 --> 02:02:14.548]  A little too well.
[02:02:15.789 --> 02:02:18.411]  I mean, Iraq is totally falling off the face of the earth.
[02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:19.352]  They didn't want that.
[02:02:19.792 --> 02:02:20.773]  They just wanted bedlam.
[02:02:20.813 --> 02:02:22.034]  Controlled hysteria.
[02:02:23.255 --> 02:02:24.155]  Stay there, Jeff.
[02:02:24.175 --> 02:02:25.376]  You're bringing up really good points here.
[02:02:25.777 --> 02:02:27.158]  I don't want to just say you're wrong.
[02:02:27.178 --> 02:02:28.299]  I mean, everything's so complex.
[02:02:28.679 --> 02:02:29.980]  You're right and you're wrong.
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:31.161]  And I'm probably right and wrong, too.
[02:02:32.722 --> 02:02:36.693]  They have lost control, that much is clear, but they want to pick up the pieces.
[02:02:36.893 --> 02:02:39.059]  Again, they're masters at creating crises.
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:39.982]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.072 --> 02:02:48.934]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.174 --> 02:02:50.754]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.095 --> 02:02:55.777]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.097 --> 02:03:00.560]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:05.142]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.362 --> 02:03:08.184]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.304 --> 02:03:12.966]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.166 --> 02:03:17.609]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:17.809 --> 02:03:25.032]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.273 --> 02:03:27.694]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:27.874 --> 02:03:29.615]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.253 --> 02:03:46.875]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.995 --> 02:03:51.119]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.123]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.203 --> 02:04:00.890]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:01.410]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:17.701]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.396 --> 02:04:52.363]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:52.824 --> 02:04:58.269]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X nail gel.
[02:04:58.670 --> 02:05:08.640]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.522]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:11.562 --> 02:05:14.924]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:05:15.044 --> 02:05:16.205]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:16.345 --> 02:05:23.830]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:25.792]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:26.172 --> 02:05:37.840]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.803]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[02:05:46.186 --> 02:05:52.210]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.810 --> 02:05:55.872]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.674 --> 02:06:03.998]  Alright, eight minutes into this third and final hour, and I want to go to your calls quickly, but Jeff in Texas was bringing up
[02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:12.902]  The whole structure of this world government saying it was in deep trouble, and I was simply stating that no, it's good cop, bad cop.
[02:06:13.022 --> 02:06:29.166]  Europe is supposed to come in after saying the Iraq war was wrong, down the road, and send in an international force that then stops bulldozing houses and burning down farms if, you know, one of their troops gets shot at.
[02:06:29.186 --> 02:06:32.766]  I mean, our government's carrying out policies that they know are designed to fail.
[02:06:35.834 --> 02:06:43.359]  I mean, Bush's people knew that this was going to blow up in their face, but it was designed to do that to lengthen the crises.
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:47.622]  And then a normal person looks at this and goes, well, we want to win the war.
[02:06:47.762 --> 02:06:51.284]  I mean, why are they doing things that are causing us to lose it?
[02:06:51.324 --> 02:06:52.245]  Well, it's like Vietnam.
[02:06:52.285 --> 02:06:53.826]  They could have won that thing in six weeks.
[02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:58.869]  The generals knew that, but they were never allowed to carry out the operations that would have done it.
[02:06:58.889 --> 02:07:04.613]  And then the minute Nixon started getting ready to really do that, boy, they shot him down in a second.
[02:07:05.672 --> 02:07:07.314]  So, and he was a globalist.
[02:07:07.955 --> 02:07:09.016]  So it's the same thing.
[02:07:09.136 --> 02:07:11.780]  Would you rather have ten years of war?
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:13.682]  Or one year of war?
[02:07:13.862 --> 02:07:18.748]  If you own companies that sell weapons and feed troops and make the uniforms.
[02:07:20.090 --> 02:07:21.191]  And sell the oil.
[02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.493]  I mean, it's a joke!
[02:07:23.614 --> 02:07:25.156]  And so that's what's really going on here.
[02:07:26.852 --> 02:07:31.478]  But in the end, it's meant to all come out about the lies of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:07:31.518 --> 02:07:32.580]  It's meant to all come out.
[02:07:33.241 --> 02:07:40.991]  We're meant to have Bush biographers going public and saying he bragged about how he planned to invade Iraq two years before he even got elected.
[02:07:41.932 --> 02:07:46.073]  We're meant to hear all this, and then Europe comes as our savior.
[02:07:46.493 --> 02:07:51.395]  Just as Rangel said in the last hour, Rangel, they'll save us.
[02:07:52.015 --> 02:07:53.195]  Jeff, finish up your points.
[02:07:53.575 --> 02:08:02.138]  Yeah, I think my point is, is they're losing the info war, and it's resulting in the fact that there's a huge gallop holding that people do not trust major media anymore.
[02:08:02.631 --> 02:08:06.254]  And they're also losing their bodies for the meat grinder in Iraq.
[02:08:06.495 --> 02:08:18.806]  And as they're losing the info war, and as you clobbered that Robert Pastor guy last week, which was beautiful, they're going to have to do something in order to keep their whole facade going, because it's cracking all around them.
[02:08:20.147 --> 02:08:25.772]  Well, I'm going to be on Coast to Coast AM for three or four hours coming up Thursday night debating two of these guys.
[02:08:27.045 --> 02:08:28.907]  Yeah, so we'll see what happens with that.
[02:08:29.287 --> 02:08:39.878]  Yeah, one side, or backside attack I see coming here is with trusted computing because in a lot of ways our biggest defense is a free and open internet.
[02:08:40.258 --> 02:08:45.383]  And with trusted computing, with all these embedded chips that will make computers trusted or not,
[02:08:46.336 --> 02:08:51.879]  The globalists can block a lot of people out of this light blood of ours, which is the internet.
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:53.200]  No, I agree with you.
[02:08:54.601 --> 02:08:55.442]  And thanks for the call.
[02:08:55.502 --> 02:08:58.924]  They plan to let the internet grow, be used.
[02:08:59.044 --> 02:09:08.849]  They saw it as a taxation grid for all business to go on to it, to where then no one could escape being tracked and traced and taxed by them.
[02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:13.312]  But instead it has, and I mean this is in their own policy reports,
[02:09:14.304 --> 02:09:23.208]  It has grown too fast, gotten too out of control, and they're really losing their monopoly of information via the web.
[02:09:24.168 --> 02:09:25.729]  So they're trying several different things.
[02:09:25.749 --> 02:09:27.670]  They're trying to flood the net with disinfo.
[02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:29.911]  They're trying to tax the net.
[02:09:30.531 --> 02:09:35.033]  But also, Internet 2, as the caller just alluded to,
[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:46.847]  They're building all these new hubs and all these new infrastructures, where if you want any of your traffic to go through it, or to be on it, you've got to have a licensed website through a sub-domain.
[02:09:46.867 --> 02:09:50.889]  There's only going to be about a dozen of them, or a dozen companies or universities.
[02:09:51.389 --> 02:09:53.391]  They decide if you're allowed to have a website.
[02:09:54.992 --> 02:09:56.232]  They decide content.
[02:09:56.953 --> 02:10:01.696]  And any other web data isn't allowed through their gates, through their hubs.
[02:10:01.736 --> 02:10:03.117]  You go, well, I'll just use the old net.
[02:10:03.597 --> 02:10:05.258]  They're not upgrading the old hubs.
[02:10:06.915 --> 02:10:11.797]  Okay, just type in the internet is dead and you'll read their policy reports in Europe and the U.S.
[02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:13.577]  talking about what they're going to do to us.
[02:10:15.858 --> 02:10:16.718]  It's disgusting.
[02:10:17.439 --> 02:10:18.719]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:10:19.119 --> 02:10:20.640]  Richard in Texas, go ahead Richard.
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:23.341]  They're not upgrading the old hub.
[02:10:23.381 --> 02:10:24.001]  Put him on hold.
[02:10:25.341 --> 02:10:30.863]  Sir, you've got the radio up in the background or you're in a big area or something.
[02:10:31.403 --> 02:10:32.384]  Try to go back to him again.
[02:10:33.024 --> 02:10:33.284]  Richard?
[02:10:36.084 --> 02:10:36.504]  Yeah, okay.
[02:10:36.884 --> 02:10:38.085]  Patrick in Texas.
[02:10:38.125 --> 02:10:39.165]  A lot of calls in Texas.
[02:10:39.225 --> 02:10:40.005]  Patrick, go ahead.
[02:10:40.045 --> 02:10:42.966]  Yeah, Alex, you mentioned about drug dealers running to prisons.
[02:10:43.006 --> 02:10:44.126]  Well, I picked up trash.
[02:10:44.166 --> 02:10:46.307]  There's a bale of cocaine outside the prisons.
[02:10:46.427 --> 02:10:47.887]  I heard that on the radio.
[02:10:48.587 --> 02:10:55.689]  And sure enough, they came over the TV, film footage, just cocaine, big pile of cocaine in the prison where the prisoners snorted it.
[02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:58.149]  You get more drugs in prison than you do on the street.
[02:10:59.430 --> 02:11:03.331]  So, you were picking up trash on the side of the road.
[02:11:03.351 --> 02:11:04.311]  Yeah, by prison.
[02:11:04.907 --> 02:11:06.408]  And you found a bale of cocaine?
[02:11:06.428 --> 02:11:08.790]  It was marked by a piece of hay, believe it or not.
[02:11:09.250 --> 02:11:11.992]  I bent down to pick it up, knowing what it was.
[02:11:12.012 --> 02:11:18.456]  Darn hay hit me in the eye, but the darn thing was wrapped up in plastic outside a prison road we were picking up trash on.
[02:11:18.696 --> 02:11:19.697]  What prison was this?
[02:11:19.717 --> 02:11:25.041]  I don't know, I think it was Palestine prison, Palestine State Prison.
[02:11:25.901 --> 02:11:27.382]  Oh, you live out by Palestine?
[02:11:27.722 --> 02:11:32.886]  Well, what I was doing for the mental health people, they can't, you know, they use you for all kinds of things, but
[02:11:33.823 --> 02:11:43.167]  Uh, aired it on the radio and then the TV station comes out with a film footage of this big pot of cocaine this guy was having in prison with his lover.
[02:11:43.708 --> 02:11:47.550]  You know, just all this going on and nothing, you know, just totally normal.
[02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:50.551]  But it's true, these drug dealers do run in prisons.
[02:11:51.031 --> 02:11:52.192]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:52.972 --> 02:11:58.875]  And by drug dealers running the prisons, the major, there's about three big private prison companies.
[02:12:00.785 --> 02:12:05.028]  And there's a dozen or so other smaller ones that are huge themselves, but three big ones.
[02:12:06.068 --> 02:12:21.898]  And all three of those companies, Geocorp, which was formerly Wackenhut, all of them, they are involved in covert actions, goon squads, major connections to the big cartels.
[02:12:21.918 --> 02:12:24.160]  So you've got three different types of drug dealers.
[02:12:25.174 --> 02:12:32.880]  You got the big official, you know, ships and planes that come in that are guarded by the CIA, and that's about 70% of the drugs.
[02:12:33.961 --> 02:12:35.001]  From all of my sources.
[02:12:35.962 --> 02:12:43.087]  I mean, just massive loads of it, directly sold to, directly to police chiefs and others who are the main drug dealers.
[02:12:43.808 --> 02:12:46.390]  And then they deal the drugs that control the entire operation.
[02:12:47.699 --> 02:12:56.942]  Then about 20% are other little cartels that have to pay a license just to grow it in their country of origin.
[02:12:58.663 --> 02:13:09.427]  And then they have to pay all the way up the chain throughout the United States to locals to be able to bring their drugs in.
[02:13:10.587 --> 02:13:15.969]  And then you got the 10% that are total cowboys that are hunted down, killed, their crops sprayed,
[02:13:17.199 --> 02:13:18.080]  That's what's really going on.
[02:13:19.702 --> 02:13:22.325]  And, uh, our government's got hit men.
[02:13:22.365 --> 02:13:32.758]  I mean, they send in Marines, they send in Army, they send in the Green Berets, they just tell them these are evil terrorists growing cocaine, they go into the village, they kill everybody, blow the place up, take off.
[02:13:33.559 --> 02:13:34.899]  Or then it gets even dirtier.
[02:13:34.939 --> 02:13:43.881]  You can't have Green Berets in Dallas, Texas killing some young college kid who's dealing a bunch of cocaine and cutting in on the CIA's deals.
[02:13:44.561 --> 02:13:55.223]  So they just send in Los Zetas and the kid walks out, you know, 21-year-old yuppie, and they kill him or they blow their car up and, you know, that's it.
[02:13:55.263 --> 02:13:56.024]  Los Zetas hits you.
[02:13:56.304 --> 02:13:59.344]  Or some cop's trying to bust your people, kill the cop.
[02:13:59.964 --> 02:14:02.545]  Or the cop's corrupt, not paying his cut, kill the cop.
[02:14:03.314 --> 02:14:05.075]  And the news knows to keep their mouth shut about it.
[02:14:06.937 --> 02:14:15.864]  I mean, I knew it was a government operation off the bat with that, but then I talked to all my sources, Celica Stillo and many others, and they're training Los Vectas at CIA bases in South Texas.
[02:14:16.945 --> 02:14:17.766]  They work for the U.S.
[02:14:17.806 --> 02:14:18.146]  government.
[02:14:18.186 --> 02:14:20.908]  They're out there killing the gangs and the drug dealers who don't pay their cut.
[02:14:22.029 --> 02:14:23.090]  Really simple, folks.
[02:14:25.432 --> 02:14:28.154]  So, uh, that's what the drug dealers are, that's what they do.
[02:14:28.274 --> 02:14:30.096]  John in Ohio, go ahead, John.
[02:14:31.219 --> 02:14:42.531]  Yes, I want to talk about what maybe one of the guests that I heard previously on George Newey that may be up against you, as well as Rangel, if I can.
[02:14:42.771 --> 02:14:49.478]  He had some weeks ago a man on who was just the most blatant and blustery defender of Bush's
[02:14:50.630 --> 02:14:56.952]  Uh, attacks against Iraq, the most simple minded justifications that it was all for freedom and fighting terrorism.
[02:14:57.112 --> 02:15:01.814]  George Norrie was very impressed with him and said, gee, I must try to have you on the program.
[02:15:01.854 --> 02:15:05.195]  He was also defending primarily the Star Wars program.
[02:15:05.822 --> 02:15:10.764]  Which is really the auxiliary of the Project for a New American Century.
[02:15:10.944 --> 02:15:12.585]  Yeah, space dominance.
[02:15:12.705 --> 02:15:13.865]  Yeah, space dominance.
[02:15:13.925 --> 02:15:16.006]  And George Norrie was just all for that.
[02:15:16.146 --> 02:15:17.566]  It's really for a first strike.
[02:15:17.706 --> 02:15:23.389]  It's not for defenses to give the United States a first strike with the... Well, John, I mean, George is just polite to his guest.
[02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:26.370]  He wants to have a real debate, so I don't want to sit here and bash George.
[02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:29.811]  I'm going to be on, you know, arguing with these people Thursday.
[02:15:30.481 --> 02:15:35.444]  Yeah, well I just wanted you to know that when he begins to purr that we have all these enemies abroad.
[02:15:35.504 --> 02:15:38.005]  I know how to deal with him, okay?
[02:15:38.066 --> 02:15:39.827]  Okay, and not with Rangel.
[02:15:40.907 --> 02:15:51.674]  With Rangel, I think you're at a point now that most people, despite all the propaganda from the media, the corporate media, the Democrats, the Republicans, most people want out of there.
[02:15:51.834 --> 02:15:59.058]  And for him now to say, when we've got Bush boxed in right now, and he will be forced to leave, possibly,
[02:16:00.061 --> 02:16:03.063]  To rescue him with a draft is ridiculous.
[02:16:03.204 --> 02:16:04.385]  Don't hold your breath.
[02:16:05.085 --> 02:16:06.507]  Remember what Galloway said.
[02:16:07.087 --> 02:16:09.950]  Very real threat that Bush will carry out a terror attack.
[02:16:10.711 --> 02:16:14.254]  Well that's exactly what I think we've got to talk about.
[02:16:14.394 --> 02:16:20.660]  And realize that I was even reading that they're using CIA sponsored terrorism in Iraq right now.
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:22.582]  Some of the independent journals like Darja Maul
[02:16:23.055 --> 02:16:25.016]  Yes, and of course the media never brings any of that out.
[02:16:25.036 --> 02:16:29.378]  They believe firmly that many of these are designed to divide and rule and incite ethnic violence rather than stop it.
[02:16:44.475 --> 02:16:48.397]  Uh, the plan now is really going to accelerate.
[02:16:48.417 --> 02:17:00.383]  I've noticed that Rumsfeld is over there trying to heat up the same type of propaganda for an even more genocidal confrontation with China now, thousands of miles away from our own shores.
[02:17:00.423 --> 02:17:06.967]  He's accusing them, a sovereign country, that if they want to increase their spending just a tiny fraction of what the huge
[02:17:07.543 --> 02:17:09.266]  Threat of the United States is facing them.
[02:17:11.310 --> 02:17:17.562]  Our military, and it's not ours, it's controlled by the bankers, is 53% of total military spending globally.
[02:17:17.998 --> 02:17:23.442]  Yes, and what the heck is this guy going over to Asia, Asian military ministers conference?
[02:17:23.462 --> 02:17:25.384]  Hey, John, John, don't try it.
[02:17:25.824 --> 02:17:28.586]  Rumsfeld helped arm China and North Korea.
[02:17:28.986 --> 02:17:31.989]  Well, before we start... They're peas in a pod, John!
[02:17:32.049 --> 02:17:41.156]  Well, let's not crave one horrible war for a genocidal war with Korea and China, because the Project for a New American Century has them in phase two.
[02:17:41.556 --> 02:17:43.918]  They are considered the ultimate... Stay there, you can stay there.
[02:17:45.362 --> 02:17:47.704]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:47.965 --> 02:17:51.809]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:17:52.109 --> 02:17:52.930]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.370 --> 02:17:57.474]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:57.715 --> 02:18:01.859]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.259 --> 02:18:07.164]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:07.544 --> 02:18:11.047]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.307 --> 02:18:16.652]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:16.933 --> 02:18:19.655]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:19.955 --> 02:18:20.856]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:19:47.094 --> 02:19:53.178]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:53.378 --> 02:19:57.221]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:57.562 --> 02:19:59.443]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:59.503 --> 02:20:01.785]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:01.925 --> 02:20:08.270]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets

[02:21:47.515 --> 02:21:53.576]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.156 --> 02:21:57.117]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.427 --> 02:22:01.748]  Well, here's the analogy.
[02:22:03.610 --> 02:22:09.755]  John, who's on the line with us from Ohio, is like a heavyweight boxing fan.
[02:22:11.917 --> 02:22:19.284]  And I've tried to explain to John that Don King owns both the fighters, but it's going to be a staged match that isn't real.
[02:22:20.264 --> 02:22:26.410]  And because he doesn't like one of the fighters, he goes, oh yes, it's bad, it's corrupt, it's not real, but the other fighter, they're good.
[02:22:28.576 --> 02:22:31.678]  Communist China uses the exact same tactics of our elite.
[02:22:31.698 --> 02:22:32.878]  They do the same type of stuff.
[02:22:33.078 --> 02:22:34.719]  Rumsfeld was involved arming them.
[02:22:35.059 --> 02:22:36.560]  Then they blame Bill Clinton for it.
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:38.101]  I love that when neocons do that.
[02:22:38.401 --> 02:22:43.463]  Bill Clinton and missile secrets, yes, and he was doing it because he's controlled by the same people.
[02:22:44.104 --> 02:22:51.867]  So is it like the Western where the evil regulator throws the gun down at the 12-year-old's feet and says, pick the gun up, kid.
[02:22:51.947 --> 02:22:52.808]  Pick it up, punk!
[02:22:53.578 --> 02:22:55.519]  And then when he reaches for it, they blow him away?
[02:22:56.039 --> 02:22:57.259]  Are they trying to set that up?
[02:22:57.460 --> 02:22:57.980]  I don't know.
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:10.104]  I mean, it seems like they're putting all the industry over there, and shifting everything over there, and then just saber-rattling for weapons sales, while picking on innocent countries like Iraq, while leaving dangerous countries like Pakistan and North Korea alone.
[02:23:11.645 --> 02:23:14.986]  But, uh, I mean, John, I know this.
[02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.407]  The bankers funded your precious commies.
[02:23:18.868 --> 02:23:19.408]  Go ahead, John.
[02:23:20.137 --> 02:23:22.698]  No, I'm not saying whether they're good, bad, or indifferent.
[02:23:22.758 --> 02:23:39.522]  I'm just saying, in the same case, the motivation for attacking Iraq or China is going to be the same plan described in the Project for a New American Century to eliminate any obstacle, just by their mere existence, just by their independent sovereignty, not any threat to us.
[02:23:40.963 --> 02:23:45.824]  An obstacle to these mad plans of these neocons for world domination described in their own documents.
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:24:07.246]  And I think that it's beginning to show right now with Roosevelt going over there, thousands of miles away from our shores, being the main speaker, the dominant speaker at an Asian Defense Minister's Conference, starting to try to pick a fight with China, when we've got our 7th Fleet prowling into their China Straits and China Sea, thousands of miles away,
[02:24:07.908 --> 02:24:14.918]  From our shores, it looks like some of these Democrats are arguing against Bush by being more Bush than Bush.
[02:24:14.979 --> 02:24:18.604]  On the one hand, they say we should have sent in hundreds of thousands of more troops.
[02:24:18.624 --> 02:24:19.725]  That's not opposing Bush.
[02:24:20.146 --> 02:24:22.810]  That's being more Bush than Bush, and then they counterpose to that.
[02:24:23.211 --> 02:24:27.336]  Well, we should be more concerned with picking a fight with North Korea or China.
[02:24:27.376 --> 02:24:30.019]  That would be even more genocidal and more murderous.
[02:24:30.099 --> 02:24:38.589]  And I think, you know, I was even reading in the official media of North Korea where they said, we want in no way any confrontation or conflict with the United States.
[02:24:39.829 --> 02:24:44.992]  I don't want to defend North Korea purely evil, but you're right.
[02:24:45.912 --> 02:24:50.614]  They're saying peace, peace, but you read our headlines, Kim Jong-il says he's going to kill us.
[02:24:52.515 --> 02:24:56.637]  And so those are lies, but I'll tell you this, John, you could be right.
[02:24:57.646 --> 02:25:01.907]  That the crisis may not be Bush nuking a city or releasing smallpox.
[02:25:02.388 --> 02:25:06.829]  The global crisis to bring in the New World Order may well be World War III.
[02:25:06.929 --> 02:25:07.949]  They may start it.
[02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:11.090]  They may blow up one of our ships and say North Korea did it.
[02:25:11.731 --> 02:25:12.211]  Exactly.
[02:25:12.231 --> 02:25:15.312]  But I think China's in on the game, sir, and I think they'll play along with it.
[02:25:15.352 --> 02:25:17.092]  Same with your precious pootie-poot.
[02:25:17.513 --> 02:25:24.535]  No, they're not anything that I'm, you know, necessarily defending, but I'm just saying that North Korea has said that they looked at the example of
[02:25:25.262 --> 02:25:28.443]  Of a wreck where they got down on their knees and totally disarmed themselves.
[02:25:28.463 --> 02:25:30.803]  Well, I'm telling you, Pootie Poot's in bed with Bush.
[02:25:32.304 --> 02:25:34.004]  Oh, you're talking about, uh, yeah, Putin.
[02:25:34.444 --> 02:25:35.205]  Well, that's Bush.
[02:25:35.285 --> 02:25:38.645]  Our president calls him Pootie Poot, so I'll call him that.
[02:25:38.665 --> 02:25:42.787]  Do you know what President Bush calls, uh, calls Rumsfeld?
[02:25:43.627 --> 02:25:44.567]  Can't say it on the air.
[02:25:44.587 --> 02:25:47.648]  Do you know his nickname, uh, for Karl Rove?
[02:25:48.568 --> 02:25:48.788]  No.
[02:25:49.748 --> 02:25:52.229]  Well, let's just say this shows major mental illness.
[02:25:53.399 --> 02:25:55.961]  Yeah, but I think there's a simpler way to explain it.
[02:25:56.001 --> 02:26:01.846]  I think it's just a matter of inter-imperialist rivalry, and the United States is the top imperialist in the world.
[02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:02.506]  That's all it is.
[02:26:02.606 --> 02:26:05.909]  And they are powerless junior partners.
[02:26:05.969 --> 02:26:13.975]  The European Union just saw that they were being cut out of their, cut the top politicians there, and they will look cave-in and go along as soon as they can.
[02:26:14.015 --> 02:26:15.576]  But that was designed to be done.
[02:26:15.616 --> 02:26:17.998]  I'm talking about the financial interests, not the public's.
[02:26:18.959 --> 02:26:20.180]  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:26:21.701 --> 02:26:22.622]  Those people over there,
[02:26:23.258 --> 02:26:26.359]  And the Iraqi people don't want anybody in there.
[02:26:26.379 --> 02:26:27.199]  John, it's simple.
[02:26:27.239 --> 02:26:33.681]  You've got a multi-headed Hydra that doesn't want you to know it's a Hydra, so it stages fights between its different heads.
[02:26:34.162 --> 02:26:36.762]  The fight is against the people, like George Orwell said.
[02:26:37.483 --> 02:26:45.045]  Well, I think that there are real conflicting differences of interest between the European Union, for instance,
[02:26:45.589 --> 02:26:46.870]  And they are not the aggressors.
[02:26:47.090 --> 02:26:49.111]  China and North Korea are not the aggressors.
[02:26:49.131 --> 02:26:53.893]  The ones that stated that they want to and are carrying out world domination is the U.S.
[02:26:53.933 --> 02:26:56.375]  branch of that military.
[02:26:56.395 --> 02:27:02.678]  But I'm telling you, John, it's the same big banks in Europe are the predominant owners of our media and our government.
[02:27:03.558 --> 02:27:08.701]  Well, I think somehow that's a kind of a diversion to say the foreign enemy, once again, is the one behind us.
[02:27:09.061 --> 02:27:11.763]  They have their own... Sir, it isn't about what you think.
[02:27:12.443 --> 02:27:13.804]  It's about the evidence, sir.
[02:27:14.608 --> 02:27:18.972]  Well, I do know there are connections, but I think there's also conflict.
[02:27:19.252 --> 02:27:24.416]  It's an inter-imperialist rivalry, but we're the bad bully on the block.
[02:27:24.476 --> 02:27:29.140]  We've got all the weapons and we're using them around the world and threatening the world.
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.163]  But, sir, they have to have the false division, the false choice.
[02:27:35.445 --> 02:27:38.468]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.388 --> 02:27:42.071]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:48.352]  You've heard it over and over again.
[02:27:48.592 --> 02:27:51.035]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:55.039]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.225]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[02:28:00.545 --> 02:28:01.226]  Don't wait for when.
[02:28:01.506 --> 02:28:02.587]  It's important to act now.

[02:29:51.005 --> 02:29:52.066]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:52.206 --> 02:29:53.067]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:53.187 --> 02:29:56.029]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:56.209 --> 02:30:01.292]  Well, why mask the odor, when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[02:30:52.427 --> 02:30:55.169]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.687 --> 02:30:59.129]  Alright, I want to get into the latest mad cow news.
[02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:04.334]  Also, this move towards world taxation becoming a lot clearer.
[02:31:05.235 --> 02:31:11.240]  We'll take three final calls here as well from Walt and John and Mike.
[02:31:11.261 --> 02:31:12.402]  That's all I have time for.
[02:31:13.182 --> 02:31:15.464]  But before we do this, this happened last Friday.
[02:31:16.425 --> 02:31:21.170]  Outrage after GOP cuts off microphones at Patriot Act hearing.
[02:31:22.034 --> 02:31:36.702]  A furor erupted after Republican House Judiciary Chairman James F. Sensenbrenner shut off the microphones during a hearing on the Patriot Act Friday, accusing Democrats of raising issues unrelated to the act, such as treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:31:36.722 --> 02:31:43.205]  Well, that shows how the government will ignore people's rights, and how this gives them a blank check.
[02:31:43.245 --> 02:31:45.887]  I mean, just no warrants, period.
[02:31:45.947 --> 02:31:47.107]  Forget just rubber stamps.
[02:31:47.147 --> 02:31:48.148]  Just no warrants, period.
[02:31:49.534 --> 02:32:03.402]  The Democrats' leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the move a shameful attempt today to silence the Democrats at hearings this morning on the impact of the Patriot Act and demanded the Republican leadership force Sensenbrenner to apologize.
[02:32:04.383 --> 02:32:09.286]  Well, most Democrats voted for the Patriot Act, too, and they say they'll vote for this one.
[02:32:09.906 --> 02:32:14.789]  It's just more chicken-fighting, more mindless partisanship to make you think there's a choice.
[02:32:15.169 --> 02:32:17.471]  Meanwhile, the LA Times is telling the truth.
[02:32:18.533 --> 02:32:21.435]  Says Patriot Act push angers some on the right.
[02:32:21.856 --> 02:32:27.180]  A Senate panel vote riles conservatives concerned about the reach of federal power.
[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:43.532]  A closed door vote by the Senate Intelligence Committee last week to expand law enforcement powers under the USA Patriot Act is prompting sharp criticism from some conservative leaders who are otherwise among the most vocal allies of President Bush and the Republican leadership in Congress.
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:57.206]  The conservative leaders who have formed a coalition with critics on the left, including the American Civil Liberties Union, vowed to press their concerns in coming days with public statements, rallies, and radio advertisements in key congressional districts.
[02:32:58.026 --> 02:33:04.649]  By the way, this is all a shill to limit how bad it really is, to make you think we're fighting, to control the movement against it.
[02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:08.051]  Bob Barr voted for the First Patriot Act, by the way.
[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:18.931]  The conservatives included former Representative Bob Barr and political activists who have been long-standing critics of the anti-terrorism law, lashed out at particular forces last week against the White House.
[02:33:18.991 --> 02:33:28.523]  Members of the Congress, Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, they said they had expected a more open review of the Patriot Act in which lawmakers considered some limits in order to safeguard civil liberties.
[02:33:29.847 --> 02:33:39.673]  But in a hearing Friday, they weren't even going to allow any witnesses, so members of the committee wanted to speak out, and Lord Sensenbrenner just said no.
[02:33:41.754 --> 02:33:43.335]  Now, folks, here's the problem.
[02:33:43.355 --> 02:33:47.938]  Whenever Bob Barr gets up, it's like, this could be misused against someone!
[02:33:49.319 --> 02:33:50.479]  What do you mean, could be?
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:57.684]  Pot dealers, topless bar owners, county commissioners, Rubik's Cube sellers, veterans that complain too much?
[02:33:59.631 --> 02:34:04.435]  They're now putting cameras up all over Los Angeles with federal money saying it's infrastructure protection.
[02:34:05.276 --> 02:34:09.600]  You know, every bit of data, everything you buy and do, Patriot Act, tracked and traced.
[02:34:11.241 --> 02:34:16.886]  Drug prosecutors are using it all over the place going, we don't need warrants anymore, we have the Patriot Act.
[02:34:19.208 --> 02:34:21.670]  So they put in these half-hearted fights.
[02:34:22.411 --> 02:34:25.574]  It's like when I saw the head of Amnesty International on Fox a few weeks ago.
[02:34:26.448 --> 02:34:33.190]  Then we go, and show me one piece of evidence, show me one piece of... And he should have said, Alberto Gonzalez's own memos calling for torturing people to death.
[02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:36.351]  Brigadier General Rick Bacchus, quick Guantanamo, refusing to torture.
[02:34:36.691 --> 02:34:41.632]  Two weeks ago, the head interrogator refused to torture anymore and went public.
[02:34:42.032 --> 02:34:48.594]  We have the 15 of the Army's own reports, the Togumbo Report, admitting torturing people to death, raping women.
[02:34:50.291 --> 02:34:51.252]  No, none of that.
[02:34:51.312 --> 02:34:53.012]  You never put up a real fight.
[02:34:53.353 --> 02:34:54.693]  They have stage fights.
[02:34:54.733 --> 02:34:56.074]  These groups are staged.
[02:34:56.454 --> 02:34:57.194]  I'm telling you.
[02:34:59.275 --> 02:35:00.536]  Alright, here's some more theater.
[02:35:02.917 --> 02:35:05.899]  With us, Sensenbrenner, and we'll go to your calls and cover some other news.
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.000]  The Chair now recognizes himself.
[02:35:11.341 --> 02:35:19.185]  First, the Chair would like to thank all of the witnesses for coming and appearing, and particularly in preparing your testimony on short notice.
[02:35:20.531 --> 02:35:32.963]  Let me say that the purpose for which this hearing was called and the scope of the hearing was stated in the letter that was submitted to me, signed by the Democratic members, which was the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act.
[02:35:33.884 --> 02:35:40.431]  I've sat here listening very patiently to the testimony, to the questions, to the answers.
[02:35:41.526 --> 02:35:54.028]  And much of what has been stated is not relevant to the 16 sections of the USA Patriot Act which were sunsetted when the law was enacted in October of 2001.
[02:35:55.249 --> 02:36:08.091]  One of the things that people who are opposed to the Patriot Act have been doing is stating that the Patriot Act was responsible for a whole host of frustrations or objections to administration policy.
[02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:18.667]  This hearing confirmed that fact, that the Patriot Act is being used as a buzzword for people who have very broad brush objections.
[02:36:19.607 --> 02:36:37.039]  I think that when Congress debates the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, we ought to stick to the subject, and that subject is the 16 provisions of the Patriot Act which we must consider and decide whether to reauthorize, whether to lapse, or whether to amend.
[02:36:38.582 --> 02:36:41.524]  The Patriot Act has nothing to do with Guantanamo Bay.
[02:36:42.364 --> 02:36:45.946]  The Patriot Act has nothing to do with enemy combatants.
[02:36:46.547 --> 02:36:50.729]  The Patriot Act has nothing to do with indefinite detentions.
[02:36:51.209 --> 02:36:58.173]  Those were provisions of other sections of the law, many of which occurred prior to the enactment of the Patriot Act.
[02:36:59.013 --> 02:36:59.974]  Now, now, now, notice!
[02:37:00.614 --> 02:37:02.515]  We're not talking about indefinite detentions.
[02:37:02.535 --> 02:37:03.916]  We're not talking about camps.
[02:37:03.956 --> 02:37:07.078]  We're not talking about, you know, enemy combatant designations.
[02:37:08.243 --> 02:37:12.747]  Just all these massive things that they have been using the Patriot Act in.
[02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:25.480]  And Patriot Act II would codify the enemy combatant designation and all that stuff that he just mentioned into law and that's what's being tagged on to this new Patriot Act expansion.
[02:37:26.787 --> 02:37:30.689]  It isn't just past the 16 sections that elapse.
[02:37:30.709 --> 02:37:32.790]  A lot of the key provisions do not elapse, by the way.
[02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:34.771]  See, notice he just says 16 sections.
[02:37:35.111 --> 02:37:37.032]  It's always been the terrorist threat doesn't end.
[02:37:37.052 --> 02:37:42.214]  You know, in 2005, we've got to reauthorize and strengthen.
[02:37:43.514 --> 02:37:45.375]  So, number one, he's a big fat liar.
[02:37:47.056 --> 02:37:47.916]  But they do this.
[02:37:47.936 --> 02:37:50.778]  You know, you'll be having a debate and they'll say, well that's not what we're discussing here.
[02:37:50.818 --> 02:37:52.038]  Now we're going to limit the scope.
[02:37:52.338 --> 02:37:53.819]  This is a lawyer thing they do.
[02:37:55.816 --> 02:38:04.999]  I mean, we got Alberto Gonzales saying he's above the law, and so Sensenbrenner sees the witnesses they want to have, so he just doesn't even allow witnesses.
[02:38:05.319 --> 02:38:06.679]  He just ends the whole debate.
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.001]  Because he's saying that, you know, that none of this has anything to do with it.
[02:38:13.161 --> 02:38:16.402]  So, I mean, it's mind-blowing.
[02:38:16.922 --> 02:38:17.822]  Please go back to it.
[02:38:18.563 --> 02:38:18.943]  Up to 2001.
[02:38:20.828 --> 02:38:36.052]  The so-called CREPI Memorandum, which had a blanket closure of immigration proceedings, was issued before the Patriot Act was enacted, and the Deputy Attorney General testified earlier this week that it's no longer being followed.
[02:38:37.232 --> 02:38:43.594]  And some of the testimony related to provisions of the Patriot Act... It was.
[02:38:45.205 --> 02:38:46.186]  That's another thing they do.
[02:38:46.286 --> 02:38:48.588]  There's nothing in there about stopping illegal aliens.
[02:38:48.608 --> 02:38:49.348]  There's nothing in there.
[02:38:49.368 --> 02:38:51.450]  You've heard Bush order the Border Patrol to stand down.
[02:38:52.891 --> 02:39:01.738]  But they will throw terms around about stopping illegal immigrants and just mention that term to confuse the average person out there.
[02:39:01.818 --> 02:39:03.620]  Please back to this liar.
[02:39:04.893 --> 02:39:23.705]  And this committee put the sunset on provisions of the law which actually increased the powers of law enforcement, but did not put the sunset on those provisions of the law which restated the powers that law enforcement had had prior to October of... There you go!
[02:39:23.785 --> 02:39:27.687]  See, he now admits that most of it isn't even sunsetted to begin with.
[02:39:28.968 --> 02:39:30.309]  And it doesn't restate it.
[02:39:30.689 --> 02:39:32.170]  Oh yeah, it connects in the U.S.
[02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:32.570]  Code
[02:39:33.343 --> 02:39:37.506]  One thing they say that's true is Bush always says, well this is nothing we haven't used against drug dealers.
[02:39:38.286 --> 02:39:39.027]  Yeah, it's true!
[02:39:39.067 --> 02:39:45.771]  You pull a family over, they got five grand, you steal the five grand, no drugs, no pot seeds, no nothing!
[02:39:45.791 --> 02:39:48.173]  You don't even arrest anybody, you just go prove it's yours.
[02:39:49.974 --> 02:39:52.255]  Thousands of cases of asset forfeiture seizure.
[02:39:53.316 --> 02:39:59.120]  Most of the bars, and I mean most folks, in Seattle are owned by cops now, you know why?
[02:40:00.666 --> 02:40:02.267]  They will sell each other crack.
[02:40:02.988 --> 02:40:04.209]  They will stage a drug deal.
[02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:07.111]  Between the informant and a cop.
[02:40:07.992 --> 02:40:08.872]  Between themselves.
[02:40:09.072 --> 02:40:09.853]  In your bathroom.
[02:40:10.193 --> 02:40:11.934]  And take your luxury restaurant and bar.
[02:40:12.635 --> 02:40:13.576]  And keep it themselves.
[02:40:13.596 --> 02:40:14.036]  You didn't know?
[02:40:14.116 --> 02:40:16.598]  Oh yeah, it's been in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:40:18.519 --> 02:40:19.800]  So yeah, it's true.
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:23.383]  A lot of this stuff they're putting into the Patriot Act, they've been doing for a while.
[02:40:23.703 --> 02:40:24.844]  Boy, that's really true!
[02:40:26.685 --> 02:40:27.946]  Now it just affects everybody.
[02:40:27.966 --> 02:40:28.347]  Go ahead. 2001.
[02:40:31.096 --> 02:40:44.187]  I think particularly irresponsible and indicative of the broad-brush accusations of the Patriot Act was what I just heard saying the Patriot Act has resulted in Minutemen being on the border.
[02:40:44.587 --> 02:40:53.054]  That's not true, and that's irresponsible, and I think anybody who knows what is going on... No, I will not yield.
[02:40:54.195 --> 02:40:54.755]  Right there!
[02:40:55.496 --> 02:41:00.340]  See, he brings in something that he knows is wildly popular, the Minutemen.
[02:41:01.644 --> 02:41:04.067]  How dare you say we cousin minute men!
[02:41:05.028 --> 02:41:06.349]  Immigration, immigration!
[02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:08.272]  See, trying to act like that's what it does.
[02:41:09.293 --> 02:41:15.359]  See how this sneaky, sneaky lawyer, like you're the jury out there, a bunch of idiots.
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.302]  Back to this moron.
[02:41:18.143 --> 02:41:20.165]  Uh, uh, we'll see that fact.
[02:41:20.979 --> 02:41:30.448]  You know, let me say that I think this hearing very, very clearly shows what the opponents of the Patriot Act are doing.
[02:41:30.789 --> 02:41:37.195]  They'll talk about practically everything but what's in the Patriot Act and what this committee is considering.
[02:41:37.873 --> 02:41:52.982]  The only really relevant testimony that I heard was from Mr. Pitts, relative to Section 215 of the Patriot Act, that said that librarians have been receiving all kinds of questions from law enforcement.
[02:41:53.563 --> 02:41:56.625]  I'd like to ask you, Mr. Pitts, to submit for the record
[02:41:57.245 --> 02:42:06.170]  The names of the librarians that have received actual section 215 orders from the FISA court to produce business records.
[02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.870]  I've interviewed them!
[02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:09.072]  And we'll give you a week to put that in the record.
[02:42:09.392 --> 02:42:11.213]  So thank you all for coming today.
[02:42:11.293 --> 02:42:19.577]  I thank the members for changing their schedules to participate and the committee is adjourned.
[02:42:20.318 --> 02:42:21.558]  Point of order Mr. Chairman.
[02:42:23.159 --> 02:42:26.521]  He just walked off.
[02:42:28.144 --> 02:42:32.367]  Well, he sounded panicked, didn't he?
[02:42:32.567 --> 02:42:35.550]  He just shut the committee down.
[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:37.051]  I'm going to decide.
[02:42:37.131 --> 02:42:41.174]  I'm going to decide what you're allowed to show.
[02:42:41.694 --> 02:42:44.576]  I'm going to decide what's relevant.
[02:42:44.636 --> 02:42:45.817]  I'm God, and you're me.
[02:42:52.942 --> 02:42:59.885]  Alright, so that's the end of it.
[02:43:00.565 --> 02:43:06.127]  Basically, the chairman, because he controls everything, shut the microphones off and just left.
[02:43:08.108 --> 02:43:09.349]  And that's what they do, folks.
[02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:12.530]  I was about to mention 213, 215.
[02:43:14.631 --> 02:43:20.413]  We have a giant section on PrisonPlanet.com of AP, Reuters, UPI, where
[02:43:21.278 --> 02:43:31.386]  A local topless bar owner gives a county commissioner $4,000 in a campaign contribution to give him zoning for parking.
[02:43:33.648 --> 02:43:40.294]  And you may not like topless bars, folks, but the point is that that's not terrorism.
[02:43:40.314 --> 02:43:43.216]  Or the lady who gets the Homeland Security visit under the Patriot Act.
[02:43:43.296 --> 02:43:45.658]  They said, under the Patriot Act, we are in infrastructure protection.
[02:43:45.958 --> 02:43:49.141]  Take those Rubik's Cubes off the shelves or we're going to charge you with terrorism.
[02:43:50.669 --> 02:43:54.052]  I mean, we got like a hundred articles, it's gotta be more than that, where they use it.
[02:43:54.712 --> 02:43:55.573]  All the time!
[02:43:56.533 --> 02:44:01.897]  And these chairmen will get up and say, I've seen them before, I dare you to show me one place it's been used!
[02:44:02.158 --> 02:44:03.379]  Committee adjourned!
[02:44:03.539 --> 02:44:04.459]  End of discussion!
[02:44:07.061 --> 02:44:10.424]  By the way, it isn't just the librarians, it's the librarians that are complaining.
[02:44:11.284 --> 02:44:12.906]  215 is for every business.
[02:44:13.346 --> 02:44:14.447]  Sole proprietorship.
[02:44:14.827 --> 02:44:15.748]  Corporation.
[02:44:16.869 --> 02:44:17.949]  Used car dealership.
[02:44:18.090 --> 02:44:18.430]  Bank.
[02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:19.811]  Grocery store.
[02:44:21.278 --> 02:44:21.999]  Bookstore.
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:28.665]  Only the librarians and Borders Books, complain about it too, have refused.
[02:44:29.445 --> 02:44:30.566]  That's why you've heard about it.
[02:44:30.646 --> 02:44:31.627]  It's any records.
[02:44:31.707 --> 02:44:38.493]  It's you will give me all your records and you won't tell anybody ever that I took these records or you'll be charged with terrorism.
[02:44:41.636 --> 02:44:45.479]  They told the lady with the Rubik's Cube at Puffer Belly Toys.
[02:44:46.020 --> 02:44:46.860]  We had her on, remember?
[02:44:47.381 --> 02:44:48.762]  They told her keep her mouth shut.
[02:44:49.645 --> 02:44:52.686]  So she called and said, this isn't even an illegal toy I'm selling.
[02:44:53.006 --> 02:44:53.947]  It's not a knockoff.
[02:44:53.967 --> 02:44:54.867]  She called Rubik's Cube.
[02:44:54.887 --> 02:44:56.608]  Well, no, our patent's been up for two years.
[02:44:58.369 --> 02:45:03.170]  They were at that little lady's office thinking she wouldn't do anything to set the precedent.
[02:45:07.072 --> 02:45:09.173]  I mean, folks, there's so many examples of it.
[02:45:12.494 --> 02:45:13.655]  I'm just blown away right now.
[02:45:13.675 --> 02:45:14.195]  I don't even know.
[02:45:14.255 --> 02:45:16.776]  I got a bunch of news I wanted to hit here, but let's just go quickly to calls.
[02:45:18.006 --> 02:45:18.886]  Who's up next here?
[02:45:18.966 --> 02:45:20.007]  Walton, Michigan.
[02:45:20.047 --> 02:45:20.647]  Go ahead, Walt.
[02:45:21.127 --> 02:45:21.727]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:45:21.987 --> 02:45:22.227]  Good.
[02:45:23.027 --> 02:45:23.788]  A couple things.
[02:45:24.368 --> 02:45:27.508]  You stated that you're going to be on Coast to Coast Thursday.
[02:45:27.548 --> 02:45:29.689]  That's this coming Thursday and the 16th?
[02:45:29.769 --> 02:45:29.969]  Yes.
[02:45:30.629 --> 02:45:31.950]  What is the time of that show?
[02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:33.450]  What channel?
[02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:34.630]  It's at Midnight Central.
[02:45:34.750 --> 02:45:37.811]  I don't know the station in your area.
[02:45:38.131 --> 02:45:40.012]  It's on about 500 radio stations.
[02:45:40.072 --> 02:45:40.812]  I'm sure you can find it.
[02:45:41.412 --> 02:45:41.732]  Okay.
[02:45:41.932 --> 02:45:45.673]  The second thing I wanted to make a comment or give you a little history.
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:46.680]  Okay, sir.
[02:46:00.419 --> 02:46:01.860]  And I talked to him personally on the phone.
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:19.671]  He called me and told me that insurgents are going to be coming across our border and coming into the United States and setting up an infrastructure of undermining our power structures, food terrorism, whatever you want to call it, where they go in and poison our foods and cause all kinds of upheaval.
[02:46:20.612 --> 02:46:24.235]  Uh, as a prelude to a foreign invasion.
[02:46:24.855 --> 02:46:30.540]  Now, Lenin said the soft underbelly of the United States, and he said this back when he was alive back in the 20s.
[02:46:31.221 --> 02:46:36.345]  But if there's going to be any invasion, sir, it's going to be by our own government, like Los Zetas.
[02:46:36.445 --> 02:46:38.207]  The CIA controls them.
[02:46:38.247 --> 02:46:39.248]  They're out killing people.
[02:46:39.744 --> 02:46:41.005]  Well, what I wanted to say is this.
[02:46:41.145 --> 02:46:59.996]  I knew back in the 80s, and I was telling a guy at work, I work with a Mexican-American, I shouldn't say he's that slash American, but he's a Mexican-American, and he said, ah, he started laughing and mocking and making fun of me, and all that ain't gonna happen, that's not going on, and it's been going on for a long time.
[02:47:00.756 --> 02:47:07.340]  And a lot of it's legitimate people who are wanting to work and make money, but don't want to go through the green card program to come in here.
[02:47:08.032 --> 02:47:13.215]  Well, sir, what's going on is admitted over a hundred killings last year in Texas alone.
[02:47:13.835 --> 02:47:20.739]  Mexican special forces on the US payroll publicly are running around slaughtering citizens that don't pay them their cut.
[02:47:20.959 --> 02:47:24.561]  Now, you remember that sheriff down there on Border County?
[02:47:25.021 --> 02:47:26.022]  Jim Hogg County.
[02:47:26.302 --> 02:47:28.403]  Yeah, I talked to this guy on the phone.
[02:47:28.723 --> 02:47:29.503]  Personally talked to him.
[02:47:29.523 --> 02:47:31.464]  I think I called your call-in line.
[02:47:32.045 --> 02:47:33.866]  We've had the sheriff on.
[02:47:34.466 --> 02:47:36.748]  Yeah, he's no patriot, he's no American.
[02:47:36.768 --> 02:47:37.368]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:48:02.301 --> 02:48:03.241]  I'm going to have to let you go.
[02:48:03.281 --> 02:48:03.722]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:03.762 --> 02:48:04.522]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:05.202 --> 02:48:07.183]  I'm not doing well with the radio turn way up.
[02:48:07.203 --> 02:48:10.804]  We're going to go on a break now and come back.
[02:48:11.105 --> 02:48:17.627]  And after this break, I may take a call or two if the radios are down.
[02:48:18.948 --> 02:48:27.511]  And then I will hit on this story here about Mad Cow and the story about world taxation and a few others.
[02:48:28.352 --> 02:48:31.393]  And I quickly will fire out the toll free number to get my films.
[02:48:32.594 --> 02:48:34.194]  That I never really seem to plug.
[02:48:34.494 --> 02:48:36.075]  About 30 seconds an hour these days.
[02:48:36.635 --> 02:48:38.495]  The films are such a big part of the solution.
[02:48:38.955 --> 02:48:40.456]  So I'll tell you about those on the other side.
[02:48:40.476 --> 02:48:42.556]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.017 --> 02:48:47.657]  What really happened September 11th?
[02:48:47.797 --> 02:48:48.957]  And who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.597 --> 02:48:50.898]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:49:11.005 --> 02:49:15.668]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:15.748 --> 02:49:18.510]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:22.012]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:49:22.052 --> 02:49:23.893]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:51:53.248 --> 02:51:54.948]  I mean, I'm just looking at these articles.
[02:51:55.188 --> 02:51:57.149]  Police turn to scan of irises?
[02:51:57.870 --> 02:52:00.951]  Police turn to scan of irises to track kids, Associated Press.
[02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:04.293]  They need to make all children retina scans for their safety.
[02:52:04.913 --> 02:52:08.815]  G8 wants tax on airline tickets to help world poor.
[02:52:11.047 --> 02:52:20.769]  Airline groups have condemned plans by the world's richest countries to impose a tax on airline tickets to fund extra money for poor African countries and make a gesture towards fighting climate change.
[02:52:22.410 --> 02:52:24.050]  That's all it is, is world taxation.
[02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:32.572]  They want an oil tax, a money transfer tax, and it's all global and it'll start at one half of one percent and be massive overnight.
[02:52:34.293 --> 02:52:34.973]  Here's another one.
[02:52:35.013 --> 02:52:35.813]  Times of London.
[02:52:35.853 --> 02:52:38.574]  Disruptive toddlers to be treated as potential criminals.
[02:52:38.994 --> 02:52:39.154]  See?
[02:52:39.194 --> 02:52:39.754]  Thought crime.
[02:52:40.751 --> 02:52:51.118]  Children as young as three are to be singled out by nursery staff if they display aggressive behavior or have a family background of criminality according to government report.
[02:52:51.778 --> 02:52:59.564]  The study leaked yesterday proposed nursery staff should note children of three or four who bullied other children as deemed as a risk of growing up to be criminals.
[02:53:00.104 --> 02:53:02.586]  This just starts a report and a dossier on you.
[02:53:03.026 --> 02:53:04.327]  They already do that here in the U.S.
[02:53:04.847 --> 02:53:05.548]  Second U.S.
[02:53:05.568 --> 02:53:07.029]  case of mad cow possible.
[02:53:08.052 --> 02:53:13.777]  There appear to be more questions than answers about a Department of Agriculture's announcement Friday night that the U.S.A.
[02:53:13.837 --> 02:53:15.919]  might have its second case of mad cow disease.
[02:53:18.261 --> 02:53:21.805]  We hear these announcements every week or two, and it's always a false report.
[02:53:21.825 --> 02:53:22.686]  There's no mad cow.
[02:53:23.086 --> 02:53:29.572]  Everybody else has got it, but we have the worst practices of feeding rotten meat to cows that aren't even meant to eat meat.
[02:53:30.192 --> 02:53:31.293]  But there's no problem here.
[02:53:31.353 --> 02:53:32.034]  Everything's fine.
[02:53:32.074 --> 02:53:32.835]  Trust your government.
[02:53:33.912 --> 02:53:38.394]  It's official, British Secret Service did murder SS Chief Heinrich Himmler.
[02:53:39.635 --> 02:53:42.896]  The British government has now released the documents where they ordered his execution.
[02:53:44.137 --> 02:53:52.020]  He tried to turn himself in and did, and wanted to end the war early, but they went ahead and killed him because he had too many connections to the British government.
[02:53:52.220 --> 02:53:53.381]  That would have been embarrassing.
[02:53:53.961 --> 02:53:55.102]  Of course it would have been.
[02:53:55.182 --> 02:53:58.723]  Gotta kill your wind-up toy once you're done with him.
[02:53:59.784 --> 02:54:01.104]  And that's most of the news.
[02:54:01.144 --> 02:54:02.345]  There's some of it I didn't get to.
[02:54:04.059 --> 02:54:07.398]  But before we try to talk to Mike in Texas, just very briefly...
[02:54:09.088 --> 02:54:15.451]  I want to commend all of you that have gotten my videos, that have gotten Martial Law and Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror.
[02:54:15.971 --> 02:54:20.234]  And I want to ask those that have gotten the videos to make copies and to get them out to everybody.
[02:54:20.514 --> 02:54:22.074]  They really are having an effect.
[02:54:22.495 --> 02:54:29.058]  And my one focus, my one goal is to wake people up and to effect change and to fight the New World Order.
[02:54:29.498 --> 02:54:31.319]  And I know my videos are effective.
[02:54:31.619 --> 02:54:34.200]  I've seen the response.
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:35.441]  I've seen the effects.
[02:54:36.041 --> 02:54:37.302]  I've seen what they've done.
[02:54:38.832 --> 02:54:42.033]  And, uh, my new film, Martial Law, is my best.
[02:54:42.053 --> 02:54:43.394]  It's really three films in one.
[02:54:43.754 --> 02:54:44.774]  Three hours long.
[02:54:45.254 --> 02:54:48.856]  Toll-free number to get Martial Law or any of my other videos, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:48.876 --> 02:54:52.817]  And your purchase of these videos also makes this broadcast possible.
[02:54:52.837 --> 02:54:52.897]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:03.701 --> 02:55:17.768]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch all the films, my weekly TV report, everything for 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv or order hard copies of any of the films at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:18.588 --> 02:55:21.230]  And this week's showing of Martial Law here in Austin sold out.
[02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:23.811]  Next Thursday's isn't sold out yet.
[02:55:24.491 --> 02:55:27.693]  So go to InfoWars.com and get your tickets now before it's too late.
[02:55:28.313 --> 02:55:29.894]  Alright, let's go to Mike in Texas.
[02:55:29.954 --> 02:55:31.495]  Mike, thanks for holding your our tail gunner.
[02:55:32.113 --> 02:55:33.173]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[02:55:33.333 --> 02:55:33.734]  Good, sir.
[02:55:34.454 --> 02:55:49.879]  Our Vice President, our Vice Bureau, was on TV on MSNBC an hour ago, and the headliner said, we are obliged to treat them, the prisoners in Guantanamo, as enemy combatants.
[02:55:50.039 --> 02:55:54.621]  And then the words out of Cheney's mouth said, they don't qualify for Geneva Convention
[02:55:57.307 --> 02:56:00.110]  Protection, because they didn't don a uniform.
[02:56:00.490 --> 02:56:01.591]  They didn't play by the rule.
[02:56:02.312 --> 02:56:04.914]  Therefore, if we don't ever don a uniform, we're in big trouble.
[02:56:05.394 --> 02:56:07.616]  Well, our police don't wear uniforms now.
[02:56:07.696 --> 02:56:08.958]  Most our military doesn't.
[02:56:09.918 --> 02:56:13.942]  So, are they, uh, are they gonna be subjected to Guantanamo Bay type tactics?
[02:56:15.063 --> 02:56:17.645]  Well, the point is, it is a crime is a crime.
[02:56:17.685 --> 02:56:19.527]  You can't torture anybody to death.
[02:56:20.027 --> 02:56:20.708]  And that's true.
[02:56:21.088 --> 02:56:21.449]  That's true.
[02:56:21.489 --> 02:56:22.690]  If they just die, it's their fault.
[02:56:24.693 --> 02:56:25.234]  Good points.
[02:56:25.294 --> 02:56:25.815]  Anything else?
[02:56:26.276 --> 02:56:26.737]  No, that's it.
[02:56:26.777 --> 02:56:28.340]  I want to know a lot more.
[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.484]  I know you're out of time, so you go ahead and close out.
[02:56:30.524 --> 02:56:31.326]  We'll have a great day.
[02:56:31.566 --> 02:56:32.609]  Alright, God bless you all.
[02:56:32.629 --> 02:56:33.130]  Take care.
