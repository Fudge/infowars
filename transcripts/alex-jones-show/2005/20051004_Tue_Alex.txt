[00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:06.534]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.255]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.116]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.737 --> 00:00:11.557]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:13.218]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:38.289]  Welcome to another edition, my friends, Real Talk Radio.
[00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:43.453]  Real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.116]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:48.417]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:54.221]  Central Standard Time, back then from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:58.624]  We have some folks coming on in the second hour.
[00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.827]  They're in New London, Connecticut, where the city is moving ahead.
[00:01:02.822 --> 00:01:11.085]  Take people's property by force now and charge them five years of rent since the start of the court cases.
[00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.046]  That's right.
[00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:29.533]  If you challenge them trying to steal your property and give you roughly 25% of the actual value of your home, well, then they simply come out and they condemn your property and start charging you rent
[00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:50.878]  for living in your own home and I'm sure many of you have heard of the woman who tried to go to a city council meeting and the seats were half empty and they said you're not allowed no one else is allowed into the city council meeting the public city council meeting for that week and they had her arrested and she's been sitting in jail for a couple weeks
[00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.831]  And she refuses to talk to anyone, talk to lawyers, talk to the police.
[00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:58.112]  What will they do if we all start doing that?
[00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:03.114]  I guess they'll just build giant slave camps everywhere and maybe lobotomize us.
[00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:03.854]  Who knows?
[00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.615]  I mean, it's our loving government, after all.
[00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:08.836]  They're here to take good care of all our property.
[00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:21.942]  All they force Prozac and Ritalin and mercury-laced injections into us and sodium stannous fluoride into our water supplies because they care so much about us.
[00:02:23.198 --> 00:02:26.721]  Is Israel planning Iran strike?
[00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:36.889]  Saudi paper Sharon presented Bush with satellite photos said Israel would not wait forever before attacking.
[00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.731]  Remember that happened a few months ago?
[00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:43.634]  Well a new report out on it that dovetails with an article we've put together
[00:02:44.304 --> 00:02:47.788]  We mentioned yesterday that I do want to detail more today.
[00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.351]  Will Israel start World War III?
[00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:59.021]  Now whether you love Ariel Sharon and love the Likudniks, or whether you don't like Israel, regardless, it's an important discussion.
[00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:02.525]  Do we really want to have World War III?
[00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:04.146]  I mean, does the
[00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.700]  Nuking of Iran sounds good to people.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.482]  I mean, it's one thing to sit around in your easy chair listening to talk radio and turn that whole Middle East into a parking lot.
[00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:19.983]  Well, could you personally go ban all those little Arab children?
[00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:23.924]  Could you personally maybe stick them all in an oven?
[00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.345]  No, but you will shoot your mouth off about it, though.
[00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:29.486]  You will feel real manly, though.
[00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:34.186]  Do you know the history of the Middle East?
[00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:35.387]  Do you know what our government did?
[00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:37.128]  Do you know how they radicalized the Muslims?
[00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:43.012]  Do you know how they kicked out governments and overthrew governments that were elected and that were good?
[00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:45.153]  No, you don't know about that.
[00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:47.295]  Do you know that Israel and the U.S.
[00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.577]  own war colleges have said that they want tension?
[00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:54.679]  They want the Middle East to be our enemies?
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.021]  They want endless war and death and destruction?
[00:03:58.662 --> 00:04:00.143]  They don't want to be friends?
[00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:02.892]  They don't want to fix problems.
[00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:04.152]  They never did.
[00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:13.155]  They took a bunch of Bedouins literally riding around on camels in Saudi Arabia and made them the big head honchos.
[00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.096]  They overthrew scores of governments.
[00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:19.738]  I mean, do you want the history and the facts and the reality?
[00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:23.299]  Or do you want to just feel good and go, KILL ALL THEM ARABS!
[00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:29.121]  When most of the people saying that can't even find those countries on a map.
[00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:31.054]  They've had national studies.
[00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:38.801]  Most adults out there, as I've said many times, don't know how many continents there are, don't even know what their state capital is.
[00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:44.126]  They can't tell you randomly what ten state capitals are, period.
[00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.110]  Most high school seniors can't tell you who the vice president is.
[00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.333]  But you've got lots of opinions, though!
[00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:53.475]  Lots of opinions!
[00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.849]  Well, your opinion's gonna get a lot of us killed, you idiots!
[00:05:02.613 --> 00:05:05.475]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.716 --> 00:05:07.317]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.637 --> 00:05:12.361]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:17.105]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:21.689]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.751]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:29.494]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:34.117]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:41.582]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.822 --> 00:05:44.244]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.404 --> 00:05:46.145]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:12.654]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:20.355]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:23.796]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:29.737]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:36.240]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.502]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.562 --> 00:06:42.463]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:48.607]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:53.069]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:54.550]  That's toll free, triple 8,
[00:06:59.172 --> 00:06:59.192]  803-4438.
[00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:10.760]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:12.662]  What happened to those prices?
[00:07:13.202 --> 00:07:14.904]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:22.471]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:23.452]  The result?
[00:07:23.892 --> 00:07:25.173]  Inflation was born.
[00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:27.736]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:30.583]  What can you do about it?
[00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:33.335]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:39.506]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:45.111]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.013]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:49.955]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[00:07:49.975 --> 00:07:52.957]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:08.688]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:12.329]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:23.552]  All right, my friends, we are 8 minutes, 20 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:28.534]  It is Tuesday, fourth day already of October.
[00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:41.613]  2005 and we're going to be here of course until the next two hours and 50 plus minutes and we're live Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:48.358]  Then of course back 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:55.363]  A lot happening coming up in the next hour we will get into some of the new developments with the eminent domain
[00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:09.838]  And government saying that if some private interest wants your property and they give us enough campaign contributions, we will take your land and then not even pay you just compensation.
[00:09:10.738 --> 00:09:21.326]  We'll talk about the poor lady who's been laboring in jail for peaceably walking into a city council meeting and they told her, nope, we're not going to have anybody else in the council meeting.
[00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:23.287]  There's always been a public and open meeting.
[00:09:24.017 --> 00:09:26.640]  And they just arrested her and she's being held.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.843]  So, a thought crime America!
[00:09:29.963 --> 00:09:47.860]  They've got some land to steal, a lot of money to be made, a lot of juicy bank accounts to fill, and the New London Development Company openly, as you know, wives and husbands of council members on it, openly committing mass felonies in front of everyone.
[00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.435]  And nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:52.456]  They've got the police.
[00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:53.436]  They've got a SWAT team.
[00:09:53.456 --> 00:09:55.438]  They've got automatic weapons.
[00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:57.500]  They've got huge camps to put people in.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.421]  They've got cells.
[00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:00.462]  They've got cameras.
[00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:03.324]  They're ready to kill us and we will submit.
[00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:07.407]  This is what they call tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:07.427 --> 00:10:10.049]  We're going to take what you've got and we're not even going to pay you.
[00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.631]  We're going to give you 25% of what it's worth.
[00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:15.733]  We're going to make you take drugs to control how you behave.
[00:10:16.174 --> 00:10:17.775]  We're going to put poison in your water.
[00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:22.758]  We're going to carry out terror attacks, so you submit to us.
[00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:28.540]  It's just the nature of government, the nature of history.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:42.603]  And, you know, I sounded somewhat sardonic in the last segment, talking down to people that have all their views about the Iraq War, all their views about Iran, and all these views about Israel.
[00:10:43.484 --> 00:10:45.224]  And I have spent
[00:10:47.034 --> 00:10:51.356]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours.
[00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:54.118]  And still, I'm a neophyte.
[00:10:54.198 --> 00:10:54.998]  I don't know much.
[00:10:56.119 --> 00:10:57.199]  Studying the Middle East.
[00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.440]  Studying history.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.822]  Studying what happened 500 years ago.
[00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:03.483]  What happened 1500 years ago.
[00:11:04.043 --> 00:11:05.484]  What happened 20 years ago.
[00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:06.905]  What happened 3 years ago.
[00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:09.746]  I read the Jerusalem Post.
[00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:11.427]  I read Haratz.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:20.466]  I read the other newspapers in Israel where they say, we caught more Mossad carrying out terror attacks to blame it on Arabs.
[00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:27.870]  Or we caught more Mossad, or Shin Bet, controlling Arabs who are carrying out terror attacks.
[00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:36.496]  And then I report on it, and some David Horowitz neocon writes a big hit piece on me.
[00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:54.898]  Because I report, you see I break the regionalized news iron curtain and I go get news articles out of Israel and I come put them on my website and then I have George Galloway, Member of Parliament, on to talk about it.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.221]  And he says that it's wrong that Israel
[00:12:03.081 --> 00:12:18.286]  In the first few years after its formation, in the late 1940s, early 50s, carried out terror bombings in Iraq, carried out terror bombings in Egypt, carried out terror bombings, of course, in Spain, and guess who they bombed?
[00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:29.149]  They put big, fat, juicy bombs in synagogues, and they blew Jews out into the streets, their arms, their legs, their intestines, little dead Jewish children.
[00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:33.840]  And then they said, ooh, the white supremacists are after you!
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.081]  Move to Israel!
[00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:38.483]  And when they got to Israel, they said, hey!
[00:12:39.824 --> 00:12:40.804]  You know what we're gonna do?
[00:12:40.824 --> 00:12:42.665]  You know what we're gonna do?
[00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:48.129]  We're gonna take your child to have a tooth check-up at the doctor, and they're gonna get an x-ray.
[00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.172]  And they'd give those little five-year-olds, can you imagine?
[00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:53.352]  One hundred thousand of them.
[00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:54.713]  Over ten years.
[00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:55.694]  Can you imagine?
[00:12:56.034 --> 00:12:58.856]  They'd lay them down, and they'd hit them with three thousand to five hundred
[00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:11.547]  3,000 to 5,000 times the safe levels of radiation, and again, the majority died the day of the event, meaning on the table, and only a few survived today.
[00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:25.678]  And it's in a few British papers, it's in a few Israeli papers, they did an Israeli documentary over there about it, and it's just swept under the rug, and then we come on the air and we say it's wrong to bomb Jews.
[00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:30.963]  It's wrong to microwave little Jewish children's brains.
[00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.163]  And we're bad.
[00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:35.904]  The ADL says we're bad for reading Haratz.
[00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:41.286]  And David Horowitz's little bloggers say we're bad.
[00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.087]  And we're just evil, folks.
[00:13:44.187 --> 00:13:45.628]  We're just really, really bad.
[00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:50.049]  You know, I report on it when MI6 carries out terror bombings.
[00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:52.070]  I report on it when our own government does here.
[00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:57.109]  I report on it when they declassify documents from previous operations they carried out.
[00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.992]  Like Gladio and Tonkin and all of them.
[00:14:01.814 --> 00:14:02.515]  That's all I do.
[00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:04.056]  I mean, I'm sorry that I'm informed.
[00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:05.298]  I'm not even that smart, folks.
[00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:06.659]  I just am into this stuff.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.460]  Again.
[00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:10.183]  Just like the...
[00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:19.515]  You've got that neighbor who is dumb as dirt when it comes to how to fix a car, how to make money, how to balance their checkbook.
[00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:22.197]  But man, they know everything about baseball, don't they?
[00:14:22.618 --> 00:14:29.142]  They know the salary of all the coaches, the salary of all of the go-to hitters.
[00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:33.965]  They know the names of the wives of most of the top hitters in the league.
[00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:36.427]  They know the names of the wives and the children of
[00:14:37.848 --> 00:14:39.410]  You know, the top pitchers.
[00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:47.878]  They know the whole history of where that pitcher was born and where they went to college and what their ERA was.
[00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:49.700]  They know it all.
[00:14:51.422 --> 00:14:52.623]  But they don't know anything else.
[00:14:55.928 --> 00:15:01.091]  This is what I do with the New World Order and history and the government and how they operate, and I still don't know a lot.
[00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:06.194]  I mean, there's so much to know, but the patterns are there, the activities are there.
[00:15:06.694 --> 00:15:10.956]  It just happens over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:17.360]  Let me say this, the best friend the Zionists have got, their own internal documents have now gone public.
[00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.132]  The best friends they've got are the white supremacists.
[00:15:20.612 --> 00:15:39.289]  The best friends they've got are the ne'er-do-well white supremacist scum crowd who run around attacking all Jews, attacking blacks, everybody else, and then anybody who criticizes the Zionists now is lumped in with those groups.
[00:15:41.371 --> 00:15:42.752]  See, there's another example of that.
[00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:44.592]  And, but you know what?
[00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:49.895]  People are getting sophisticated and they're beginning to figure this out.
[00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:57.258]  You know, when we criticize the British government carrying out terror attacks, I'd be on the street with a crowd behind me.
[00:15:57.318 --> 00:15:58.699]  Most people would be nodding their heads.
[00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.720]  Some would come up and go, you know, shut your bleeper!
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.241]  I'd turn around and go, excuse me?
[00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:05.422]  They'd go, ah, get out of here!
[00:16:06.723 --> 00:16:07.463]  I got it on video.
[00:16:07.483 --> 00:16:09.664]  When I was in England, it'll be in an upcoming film.
[00:16:11.266 --> 00:16:12.968]  You know, they were taking it as an insult.
[00:16:13.048 --> 00:16:21.076]  They saw that my insult of the government, which wasn't an insult, I was reporting a fact, as an attack on British people.
[00:16:21.176 --> 00:16:21.957]  It's not an attack.
[00:16:22.257 --> 00:16:35.030]  The fact that Tony Blair is a consummate demon, a murdering terrorist, lying little puppet, that's no attack on my webmaster, Paul Watson, who lives in Sheffield, England, or his brother,
[00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:43.898]  One of our other great webmasters and writers, who runs InfoWars.net, there in London, I mean, that's common sense!
[00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:44.459]  See?
[00:16:44.999 --> 00:17:00.824]  It's common sense that when I sit here and say that the people running Israel are actual Luciferians, and they bought off the Christian coalition, who tells you, basically, we must worship Jesus in the temple, which the Bible actually says the Antichrist will be in the temple, folks.
[00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.285]  I mean, I'm not even a Bible scholar.
[00:17:04.325 --> 00:17:05.025]  Everybody knows that.
[00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:35.178]  uh... and uh... it's just incredible so when I criticize a small tiny group of control over there doing all these horrible things literally radiating their own children does that mean I'm against the Jews because I want to stop them from being radiated oh don't please don't radiate your children I mean that's what we were doing in the fifties folks imagine what we're doing now please don't radiate your children oh man that is anti-semitic he doesn't want Jewish children to die
[00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:49.582]  No, see, telling the truth resonates with you whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, German, Chinese, Japanese, Inuit, Brazilian, you know, Aborigines.
[00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.603]  The truth resonates with everyone.
[00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:57.585]  But if I sit here and go, the Jew is an evil demon, the seed of set,
[00:17:58.331 --> 00:18:00.273]  And it must be eradicated.
[00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:06.037]  I mean, that is blasphemous, that is evil, that is out of control, and that comes right out of the Zionists, folks.
[00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:14.284]  If you knew how they funded royal British-Israelism, if you knew how Hitler was into that, if you knew how the Zionists supported him.
[00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:18.347]  If I get one more email telling me how Hitler was good, I'm going to just vomit.
[00:18:19.228 --> 00:18:20.729]  That guy was a dark magician.
[00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:22.351]  He was a devil worshipper.
[00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:24.492]  So was the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:27.555]  And it's not my opinion, it's their own writings!
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.161]  I mean, that's the incredible part.
[00:18:30.201 --> 00:18:31.282]  Like, Masons email me.
[00:18:31.482 --> 00:18:33.063]  How dare you say we worship Lucifer?
[00:18:33.223 --> 00:18:36.265]  Well, I'm sorry if all your supreme grandmasters say that.
[00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:39.327]  Every 33rd degree Mason that writes a book.
[00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:43.129]  We just go off the truth here.
[00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.230]  Okay?
[00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.131]  That's all we go off of.
[00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.593]  We don't claim that we've cornered the market on it, but we seek it.
[00:18:49.914 --> 00:18:53.016]  And we have found it many times.
[00:18:54.737 --> 00:18:58.079]  So now one of David Horowitz's little minions has savaged me.
[00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:00.970]  And it does absolutely nothing, folks.
[00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.410]  It's bad.
[00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.971]  It's only good.
[00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:08.333]  It only drives people to infowars.com and prisonblinded.com.
[00:19:08.873 --> 00:19:11.454]  They will find out what we really said.
[00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:18.677]  They will find out that we are against the little black children that had testing done, or the little Seventh Day Adventist children.
[00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.239]  And we're against what happened to the Jewish children.
[00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:24.901]  We're against what happened to Native Americans with smallpox blankets.
[00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:34.045]  We have the British governments, you know, the British generals back in the 1750s talking about using smallpox on Indians.
[00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:39.127]  And we've got it in the 1870s and 1880s here in the U.S.
[00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:42.389]  in our own... They've got letters at West Point talking about it.
[00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:48.236]  We're going to expose how this elite thinks we're all a bunch of slaves.
[00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:54.278]  We're going to come together against the New World Order, and we're going to bring it down!
[00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:58.540]  Humanity, with God's help, will prevail!
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:05.410]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.213]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:10.895]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:14.597]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[00:20:14.857 --> 00:20:18.600]  Conversely, where oxygen is deficient, disease thrives.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:25.185]  With atmospheric oxygen levels commonly dipping as low as 10% in today's indoor and urban environments,
[00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:28.448]  Is it any wonder we have so much chronic disease to deal with?
[00:20:28.628 --> 00:20:31.951]  Most of us are oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.795]  Without sufficient oxygen, both our physical and mental health will deteriorate.
[00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:44.621]  Clearly, increasing the body's oxygen without negative side effects is critical to achieving good health and a sense of well-being.
[00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:51.507]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:59.669]  To learn more about safely increasing your body's oxygen level, click the blue and white oxygen banner at GCNlive.com.
[00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.470]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.551]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:11.992]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:13.232]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.552 --> 00:21:18.113]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.613 --> 00:21:20.735]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:35.928]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.968 --> 00:21:43.034]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:47.777]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:50.238]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.358 --> 00:21:50.698]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.500]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:53.980]  One and the same.
[00:22:11.115 --> 00:22:15.096]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:15.116 --> 00:22:17.177]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:17.697]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:17.737 --> 00:22:19.238]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:19.518 --> 00:22:19.998]  Here is reality.
[00:22:20.018 --> 00:22:22.039]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:36.883 --> 00:22:40.546]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.107 --> 00:22:44.850]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:49.014]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:23:01.974 --> 00:23:05.857]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.997 --> 00:23:07.739]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:09.060]  But not just any water.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.363]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.

[00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:07.793]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:10.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:15.800]  Tim and Joe and John and many other calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.823]  Toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:25.108]  I want to get into some of the news first, but I need to give you a couple of program notes.
[00:24:25.388 --> 00:24:27.490]  This broadcast goes out on
[00:24:29.013 --> 00:24:46.420]  The Star Guide, of course, digital satellite feed to scores of our AM and FM affiliates, a growing legion of stations that love the truth and love this country and have checked out my claims and found out that they're on the face of it true.
[00:24:47.381 --> 00:24:51.002]  And we just commend those stations.
[00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:53.263]  Also, there's a lot of micros.
[00:24:53.303 --> 00:24:55.064]  People know them as pirates.
[00:24:56.242 --> 00:25:01.505]  But there are small little 10 watt to 100 watt stations across the country.
[00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.487]  Over 100 that we know of.
[00:25:03.527 --> 00:25:05.168]  There's like 12 of them in Texas.
[00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:07.049]  More than 12 actually.
[00:25:07.069 --> 00:25:14.393]  12 that we're affiliated with and then several others we know about that pick us up off satellite or the internet as well.
[00:25:14.413 --> 00:25:16.734]  And then there's Global Shortwave.
[00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:22.578]  And WWCR, you know, we moved to WWCR as our carrier.
[00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:24.012]  A few years ago.
[00:25:24.292 --> 00:25:25.653]  And they're just the best.
[00:25:25.673 --> 00:25:28.415]  They've got the biggest, most professional transmitters.
[00:25:28.435 --> 00:25:29.916]  100,000 watt transmitters.
[00:25:29.936 --> 00:25:31.157]  I think they've got one that's even more.
[00:25:31.818 --> 00:25:33.479]  And they just serve the entire planet.
[00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:38.122]  And I get emails and letters from people in Antarctica that listen.
[00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:39.984]  Weather stations.
[00:25:40.564 --> 00:25:42.005]  You've heard the calls on air before.
[00:25:43.607 --> 00:25:45.908]  We get letters from Indonesia.
[00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:49.371]  Letters from missionaries in Africa.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.182]  Well, literally, there's not even a TV in the village, in this particular mountain village.
[00:25:56.202 --> 00:26:00.464]  I get a letter every few months, and they're in the mountains.
[00:26:00.484 --> 00:26:03.185]  They don't even pick up the local TV station that's 200 miles away.
[00:26:03.225 --> 00:26:04.106]  That's local for them.
[00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:19.152]  And they sit around at night, and it has a cassette player on their shortwave system, their Sanjian shortwave system, and they tape the show, and they sit around at night with the whole village listening to excerpts of the show.
[00:26:19.793 --> 00:26:20.813]  I mean, it's just amazing!
[00:26:21.624 --> 00:26:33.092]  And so that's why we are with WWCR, and they're going to be simulcasting us for the next two weeks, they were kind enough to, on our old frequency, and on our new frequency.
[00:26:35.273 --> 00:26:41.157]  And so it's really exciting, and we're moving to, during the day we'll still be at what, 9.985
[00:26:44.921 --> 00:26:45.962]  The first two hours?
[00:26:46.322 --> 00:26:48.004]  I don't even know what it is in the third hour.
[00:26:48.424 --> 00:26:50.125]  It's 9.97 something.
[00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:52.167]  We're right around there in the third hour.
[00:26:52.527 --> 00:26:53.628]  I should have this in front of me.
[00:26:53.668 --> 00:26:56.611]  I try to count on memory and sometimes it fails me.
[00:26:57.632 --> 00:27:03.056]  But at night, we've been on 32.10 the last year and a half or so.
[00:27:03.797 --> 00:27:04.998]  But we're going to be leaving 32.10.
[00:27:05.418 --> 00:27:07.260]  We're going to be moving
[00:27:07.992 --> 00:27:20.158]  Well, it's already started, but for the next two weeks we'll be simulcast on 3210, and then in the first hour, 9 o'clock central, you'll be able to hear us at 7.461, first hour, 7.461, the first hour, and then for the second and third hours, 5.765.
[00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:36.245]  So, first hour 7.461, second and third hours 5.765.
[00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:46.732]  And both those frequencies are substantively better than 3210 here in the United States.
[00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:52.336]  We have, of course, the bulk of our listeners, but we really have the shortwave to reach the globe.
[00:27:52.356 --> 00:27:55.978]  I mean, I get on the air and I talk about enemy takeovers of the US.
[00:27:56.679 --> 00:28:00.161]  I mean, there are, you know, executives
[00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:14.939]  Who, when they're on vacation, on a cruise ship, you know, have their Sanjean out, I get letters and emails, out on the deck of the ship, you know, listening for an hour or two to get their information.
[00:28:15.219 --> 00:28:16.460]  Which is always daunting!
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.942]  I mean, to have all these people counting on me, it's... But, you know, folks tune in because they know I do my homework, and they also know that I'm sincere.
[00:28:25.322 --> 00:28:26.122]  That telegraphs.
[00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:29.643]  I mean, I really believe what I'm saying, and we have a good track record of predicting it.
[00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:42.114]  I belabored shortwave enough, I rarely talk about it, but the 3210 is great in other parts of the planet, but not too good sometimes here domestically in certain areas.
[00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:49.442]  But these higher frequencies, these mid-range frequencies, are historically better for domestic listenership.
[00:28:50.899 --> 00:28:56.444]  And so those are the frequencies, and I'll try to remind me to plug those more in the next few weeks.
[00:28:56.844 --> 00:29:03.010]  And then before we end this segment and come back and cover the news and take your calls, I'm going to be showing my new film.
[00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.111]  That's right, I've re-edited it.
[00:29:04.551 --> 00:29:05.612]  I've added about 35 minutes to it.
[00:29:07.737 --> 00:29:11.160]  It's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove completely updated.
[00:29:11.801 --> 00:29:13.462]  There's been a new infiltration of the Grove.
[00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:15.203]  We have that footage and photos in there.
[00:29:15.724 --> 00:29:16.725]  So much more.
[00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:19.447]  I'll be showing that coming up this Sunday.
[00:29:19.527 --> 00:29:23.710]  Alamo Draft House on Colorado Street in downtown Austin.
[00:29:24.131 --> 00:29:25.152]  7 o'clock Sunday.
[00:29:25.512 --> 00:29:28.734]  Get your tickets via InfoWars.com before they sell out.
[00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:30.696]  And then the Monday night showing.
[00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:31.617]  One more showing.
[00:29:32.398 --> 00:29:35.280]  And that'll be at 7 o'clock, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.001]  Bring your friends and family.
[00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:40.643]  It's going to be a powerful presentation.
[00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:43.164]  I'll also give a speech and have a question and answer.
[00:29:43.444 --> 00:29:46.866]  So I want to see you all out there this Sunday or on Monday.
[00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:48.727]  We'll be right back with the news and your calls.
[00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:52.970]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.051]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:58.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:06.698]  Janet from JLS Research has been preparing a revolutionary new product.
[00:30:06.818 --> 00:30:09.939]  Listeners have been having tremendous success with No B.O.
[00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:15.141]  Now Janet would like to introduce to you her new product, like the Sweet Smell of Success Lotion Bar.
[00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:18.923]  Lotion bars are simply a lotion made into a solid bar rather than a liquid.
[00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:22.244]  You guys that are opposed to lotion bottles, this handmade bar is just for you.
[00:30:22.264 --> 00:30:22.564]  I think so.
[00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:46.066]  We're good to go.
[00:31:02.195 --> 00:31:05.757]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:06.317]  are located?
[00:31:06.517 --> 00:31:09.899]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 crime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:14.841]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.122 --> 00:31:22.065]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[00:31:22.305 --> 00:31:26.410]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:41.106]  Complete with 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[00:31:41.346 --> 00:31:45.991]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.
[00:31:46.292 --> 00:31:51.698]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $49 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:51.798 --> 00:31:53.760]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:03.664 --> 00:32:10.507]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.767 --> 00:32:13.128]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.388 --> 00:32:15.349]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:21.032]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.432 --> 00:32:25.695]  The T-Chain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[00:32:26.156 --> 00:32:28.678]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[00:32:28.898 --> 00:32:34.062]  With its 10-year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[00:32:34.242 --> 00:32:39.285]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[00:32:39.325 --> 00:32:41.427]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:44.991]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:45.212 --> 00:32:47.695]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:47.895 --> 00:32:50.198]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:50.478 --> 00:32:54.263]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:54.503 --> 00:32:56.826]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:56.946 --> 00:32:57.446]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:03.698 --> 00:33:18.169]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:33:18.249 --> 00:33:24.013]  I want to scan through some of the headlines to give you an idea of some of the stuff that's important out there.
[00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:31.899]  Obviously we take your calls because a lot of times you bring up information that's a lot more vital than information that I focus on.
[00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:50.877]  And because a lot of you are more informed and intelligent in a vast range of fields than I. And that's why we have this program basically being a call-driven situation in between, I guess, my analysis that could be termed as babbling rants.
[00:33:52.058 --> 00:33:56.180]  But again, we're already getting calls asking what those frequencies were.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.162]  I'll say it one more time, I guess.
[00:34:01.716 --> 00:34:02.396]  I'm the same way.
[00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:07.840]  People always say phone numbers on air that I want or something and then I can't find a pin and I want them to say it again.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.701]  So, I'm the worst culprit when it comes to this.
[00:34:11.802 --> 00:34:15.664]  First hour at night, starting right now on shortwave, from 9 to midnight.
[00:34:15.984 --> 00:34:16.545]  First hour, 7.461.
[00:34:16.585 --> 00:34:16.545]  7.461.
[00:34:16.765 --> 00:34:17.806]  Second and third hours, 5.765.
[00:34:25.255 --> 00:34:45.281]  Oh, by the way, on the showing of the new, remastered, re-edited, 35 minutes of extra video added to Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, five years ago when we infiltrated the ultra-secret occult elite compound in Northern California, these have sold out in the past.
[00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:49.982]  When I showed Martial Law, Rise of the Police State,
[00:34:50.999 --> 00:34:56.383]  A few months ago we had six showings and they all sold out and I could have continued to have them.
[00:34:56.443 --> 00:35:01.546]  I just was too busy to go to the events so I just didn't have any more.
[00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:09.532]  But we've had requests to show more videos and so we're going to show this this Sunday and then this Monday Alamo Draft House downtown and on South Lamar.
[00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:11.513]  So again, done plugging.
[00:35:13.184 --> 00:35:15.425]  Now, jumping into the news.
[00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:23.408]  Neocon blogger, Slanders Galloway and Jones, and Kurt Nemo has written this article.
[00:35:24.729 --> 00:35:40.195]  Patrick Dabuny, a regular contributor over at David Horowitz's Scafie-funded MonBat blog, and a Henry M. Jackson National Security Fellow at the Neocon Center for Security Policy,
[00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:49.573]  has taken George Galloway to task for dispensing a bit of unabridged history.
[00:35:49.673 --> 00:36:05.319]  During an interview on the Alex Jones Show, Galloway declared that Israel and Dirty Tricks had a long history together, while also calling Israel a little settler state on the Mediterranean, which acted as an advance guard in the Arab world for the U.S.
[00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:07.380]  Well, our government says that's the policy.
[00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:11.608]  The Alex Jones Show is a good place for the airing of such insanity.
[00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:14.329]  It being a syndicated fringe radio show.
[00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.150]  Syndicated fringe?
[00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.551]  Hmm.
[00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:22.494]  Which charges, among other things, that secret societies rule the world.
[00:36:23.194 --> 00:36:24.895]  Global mafias that use secrecy.
[00:36:24.935 --> 00:36:26.076]  Yes, intelligence agencies.
[00:36:26.496 --> 00:36:28.757]  And 9-11 was a government conspiracy.
[00:36:29.618 --> 00:36:32.439]  Well, now the majority of Americans believe that in major polls.
[00:36:32.479 --> 00:36:33.640]  You've got a problem, buddy.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.961]  And he continues to rant.
[00:36:36.696 --> 00:36:39.478]  and attempts to smear Jones and Galloway at the same time.
[00:36:40.839 --> 00:37:02.053]  He is a purposeful neocon plugging away at Frank Gaffney's warmongering think tank, but not only by the aforementioned Scafee Foundation, but also the bingo magnet Irving Moskosowitz, who bankrolls Israeli settlers who are fond of shooting Palestinian children in the head as a student of history by way of big-time omission.
[00:37:04.293 --> 00:37:10.757]  And it goes on, for instance, he is unable to accept the historical fact that political Zionism supported the rise of Adolf Hitler.
[00:37:11.477 --> 00:37:13.038]  Well, I mean, that's just admitted now.
[00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:20.322]  An assertion he decries as lunacy, of course, not all Zionists supported Hitler, but some of them did.
[00:37:20.382 --> 00:37:29.467]  For instance, the German Zionist Federation, an influential voice in European Zionism at the time, quote, believing that there are ideological similarities between the two movements,
[00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:37.248]  Their concept for liberalism, the common vulgar racism, and of course their mutual conviction that Germany could never be a homeland.
[00:37:37.568 --> 00:37:40.649]  The Jews could induce the Nazis to support them.
[00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:48.870]  The German Zionist Federation solicited the patronage of Adolf Hitler not once but repeatedly after 1933, writes Lenny Brenner.
[00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:57.532]  And it goes into everyone in Germany knew that only the Zionists could reportedly and responsibly represent the Jews in dealings with the Nazi government.
[00:37:57.832 --> 00:37:58.392]  And it goes on.
[00:37:59.662 --> 00:38:09.626]  So, again, we've been attacked for talking about how the Israeli government admits they microwave-radiated 100,000 Jewish children and almost all of them died.
[00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:13.527]  Many of them, again, on the table, most within one week.
[00:38:14.627 --> 00:38:15.988]  We're bad for reporting on that.
[00:38:17.168 --> 00:38:20.609]  I mean, how is it bad to report that governments do this type of stuff?
[00:38:20.749 --> 00:38:21.890]  I don't believe Israel has
[00:38:22.572 --> 00:38:24.093]  Has cornered the market on evil.
[00:38:24.133 --> 00:38:27.034]  I don't believe Israel is the all-powerful evil running everything.
[00:38:27.494 --> 00:38:31.636]  But I think it does a lot of really horrible, corrupt things, namely to its own citizens.
[00:38:31.656 --> 00:38:39.419]  I mean, that whole military takeover system over there, that we're now seeing the same system being set up here, is about the elite dominating their own population.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.420]  I mean, it's admitted.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.981]  They created, our government created Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.181]  Israel created Hamas.
[00:38:46.641 --> 00:38:51.624]  They carry out terror bombings and have been caught over and over again doing it to blame it on their enemies.
[00:38:52.244 --> 00:38:54.645]  Israelis have been caught shooting our own troops.
[00:38:56.106 --> 00:38:57.366]  Shooting at our own troops.
[00:38:58.387 --> 00:39:02.709]  MI6 has been caught through their armed special air services.
[00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:08.132]  Clearly carrying out shootings and bombings in Iraq to keep the tension going.
[00:39:11.213 --> 00:39:12.854]  Does that mean I'm against British people?
[00:39:13.134 --> 00:39:14.155]  No, it doesn't.
[00:39:14.648 --> 00:39:23.310]  I mean, I've actually been criticized, folks, by major publications for saying China is run by evil despots and that they sell political dissidents organs.
[00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.531]  And their attack is, Alex Jones must not like Asians.
[00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:31.251]  Because I don't want Asians being killed by a predatory government.
[00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:39.593]  When I caught two black guys being paid off by a white guy to give false testimony, this was in the local paper, against the Second Amendment,
[00:39:40.157 --> 00:39:44.240]  When I caught them on video, the paper just said, maybe Jones doesn't like black people.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.082]  And the paper asked me, would you have reported this if they would have been white?
[00:39:47.502 --> 00:39:49.223]  And I said, what type of statement is that?
[00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:55.628]  Again, it's this race card they throw out to try to neutralize.
[00:39:56.028 --> 00:40:01.732]  And it's not, let me tell Horowitz and all of them something, it is not working.
[00:40:03.213 --> 00:40:05.175]  We are going to expose
[00:40:06.164 --> 00:40:11.426]  The atomic soldiers, we're going to expose the fact that our government radiated thousands of children in America.
[00:40:12.987 --> 00:40:17.469]  We're going to expose that Israel did it to a hundred thousand, by far the biggest testing we know of.
[00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:20.330]  We are going to expose all of this.
[00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.090]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:22.971]  It's just going to happen.
[00:40:24.272 --> 00:40:26.533]  You're not going to get away with radiating children.
[00:40:26.593 --> 00:40:27.813]  I mean, it's just not going to happen.
[00:40:28.974 --> 00:40:30.534]  You expect us not to talk about this?
[00:40:32.335 --> 00:40:33.876]  What planet do you think we're from here?
[00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:39.108]  These governments are psychopathic and are out of control.
[00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:42.230]  You that defend that state are bad.
[00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.573]  You become accomplices to these type of things when you defend it.
[00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:53.977]  The mere fact that you read what we'd said and then would still attack us.
[00:40:55.138 --> 00:40:59.200]  When the article we posted about the Galloway interview, no doubt where you got this information,
[00:41:00.194 --> 00:41:04.919]  Was full of hyperlinks documenting all our claims in Israeli newspapers.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.462]  So you go attack the Jerusalem Post and you go attack Haaretz.
[00:41:08.963 --> 00:41:10.104]  See, that's the incredible thing though.
[00:41:10.304 --> 00:41:11.986]  See, you're supposed to only stay in Israel.
[00:41:12.246 --> 00:41:15.930]  They're supposed to talk about it a little bit over there, but eh, nothing happens, nobody gets in trouble.
[00:41:16.811 --> 00:41:23.017]  In major polls in Israel, over 80% of the people over there know that they killed Yishak Rabin, because he wouldn't play ball.
[00:41:24.313 --> 00:41:27.476]  I mean, am I bad because I report on you killing Yitzhak Rabin?
[00:41:28.156 --> 00:41:29.557]  I report on Mossad doing that?
[00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:42.327]  I mean, am I bad that I report that UPI and others reported that Israel says they'll kill Americans in America without warrants, without records, without... that they'll just assassinate American citizens in the U.S.?
[00:41:42.547 --> 00:41:44.349]  I mean, I'm against our own government doing that!
[00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:45.770]  I'm against the Russians doing it!
[00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.571]  And I'm sure against Israel doing it!
[00:41:48.112 --> 00:41:49.333]  Does that mean I'm against Israel?
[00:41:52.822 --> 00:41:53.802]  The people in Israel?
[00:41:54.142 --> 00:41:57.764]  I'm against the policies of the corrupt people that run that country.
[00:41:59.804 --> 00:42:10.848]  Here I am ranting about Israel, and I'm one of the few people that has the wonderful distinction of having the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations, and the ADL all attacking me, because I know who your fathers are.
[00:42:12.568 --> 00:42:13.429]  Father of the Devil!
[00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:16.489]  That's what Christ said.
[00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:18.530]  And you notice the world hates us.
[00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.071]  Those that hate me and persecute me are going to persecute you.
[00:42:22.202 --> 00:42:26.726]  And those that hate us, folks, they love death.
[00:42:28.047 --> 00:42:29.549]  Just like Tex Meyers said yesterday.
[00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:37.616]  And I don't know how somebody... I don't know how people could defend a state that would radiate 100,000 of its own children.
[00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:42.240]  I mean, you think we're anybody safe with a government that'll do stuff like that?
[00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.883]  You want to make some excuses for it?
[00:42:46.084 --> 00:42:47.445]  It's just... it's admitted!
[00:42:48.388 --> 00:42:52.730]  And again, I know I said I'd take calls, and I've gotten into one article, and I'm... I'm... I'm ranting!
[00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.031]  But, uh... I'm just tired of it.
[00:42:56.371 --> 00:43:01.513]  So, Neocon blogger Slanders, Galloway, and Jones is up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:05.214]  We also have a link through to Kurt Nemo's great site, where he does a lot of good reporting.
[00:43:05.254 --> 00:43:05.954]  A really good guy.
[00:43:07.475 --> 00:43:08.315]  We like Kurt Nemo.
[00:43:08.355 --> 00:43:09.415]  He does a lot of good reporting.
[00:43:09.455 --> 00:43:11.936]  We've checked out his sources, and when he does, he's a good source.
[00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:16.298]  Links between Indonesian terrorists and the security services
[00:43:17.626 --> 00:43:19.107]  An interesting article we've posted.
[00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:21.429]  It's four pages long of tiny print.
[00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:27.092]  We can't read it all, but it's totally proven the British government was behind that little... that little thing.
[00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:28.973]  That tragedy.
[00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:33.556]  And when all this more evidence came out over the weekend, the government released a video right after.
[00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:34.117]  Oh no!
[00:43:34.177 --> 00:43:34.797]  We didn't do it!
[00:43:35.137 --> 00:43:39.420]  Here's a video of a guy with brown skin walking along in Indonesia.
[00:43:40.381 --> 00:43:40.501]  Oh!
[00:43:40.561 --> 00:43:41.321]  Case closed!
[00:43:41.381 --> 00:43:42.742]  Guy with dark skin in Indonesia.
[00:43:43.783 --> 00:43:46.985]  And there's only, you know, 80 million of them or something.
[00:43:47.934 --> 00:43:48.635]  Case closed.
[00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:49.755]  They're walking around.
[00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:50.776]  It's just total proof.
[00:43:52.817 --> 00:43:56.239]  A chip firm urges government to push RFID use.
[00:43:57.279 --> 00:44:02.642]  Phillips Semiconductors has called on European governments to promote RFID technology in security and retail applications.
[00:44:03.263 --> 00:44:10.827]  The firms and government should collaborate with industry to take full advantage of what it believes could be the most pervasive technology ever seen.
[00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:16.042]  2010 RFID technology will be the basis of a $10 billion industry.
[00:44:16.102 --> 00:44:19.823]  You said that five years ago, about 2005, that all products would have it.
[00:44:20.183 --> 00:44:24.645]  Walmart ordered all of their suppliers to have it by last year.
[00:44:25.045 --> 00:44:27.686]  So did the Defense Department, and very few complied.
[00:44:27.726 --> 00:44:29.026]  Those that did, we boycotted.
[00:44:29.926 --> 00:44:30.866]  And so they're in trouble.
[00:44:30.886 --> 00:44:32.627]  We've actually had victories on this.
[00:44:34.187 --> 00:44:38.569]  Catherine Albrecht's book just came out, and it's already like number five on the Amazon bestselling list.
[00:44:38.969 --> 00:44:39.829]  So see, see,
[00:44:40.686 --> 00:44:42.287]  People are hungry for the truth.
[00:44:42.447 --> 00:44:46.070]  That's why History Channel has whitewashes about the New World Order now.
[00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:48.793]  Because they lost all credibility.
[00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:50.934]  They're losing all viewership.
[00:44:51.515 --> 00:44:54.037]  They're losing... because we'll talk about the truth and you won't.
[00:44:54.737 --> 00:44:56.239]  People go, well you just read mainstream news.
[00:44:56.279 --> 00:44:58.661]  Yeah, I'll read Electronics Weekly.
[00:44:58.701 --> 00:45:00.342]  The trade publications is where you get it all.
[00:45:01.023 --> 00:45:03.505]  And then they're telling you how great it is in this article.
[00:45:03.885 --> 00:45:05.446]  I just go, no, this is not great.
[00:45:06.587 --> 00:45:07.448]  Let me tell you how this works.
[00:45:08.453 --> 00:45:12.034]  You hear about Google's putting in wireless networks for free in San Francisco?
[00:45:13.315 --> 00:45:15.736]  And the government's going to give you free wireless networks?
[00:45:18.077 --> 00:45:20.318]  Why on earth would you be so stupid?
[00:45:20.598 --> 00:45:21.618]  And myself included.
[00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:22.639]  I do stuff like this all the time.
[00:45:22.659 --> 00:45:23.679]  I'm not being sardonic.
[00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:24.479]  These are warnings.
[00:45:27.861 --> 00:45:28.161]  Why?
[00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:29.841]  Why?
[00:45:30.702 --> 00:45:33.003]  Anything that's free isn't free.
[00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:35.103]  There's no such thing as a free lunch.
[00:45:36.224 --> 00:45:36.484]  Okay?
[00:45:39.341 --> 00:45:40.382]  You know, love costs.
[00:45:40.582 --> 00:45:44.746]  Love means you've got to sacrifice and be willing to stand up for those you love.
[00:45:46.147 --> 00:45:47.769]  Everything in this world has a cost.
[00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:50.531]  And a lot of times those costs are a great thing to pay, by the way.
[00:45:51.432 --> 00:45:54.215]  Paying and giving is much better than receiving.
[00:45:54.355 --> 00:45:54.715]  Believe me.
[00:45:55.356 --> 00:45:56.717]  But, uh, it feels a lot better.
[00:45:56.937 --> 00:45:57.238]  I love it.
[00:45:57.718 --> 00:45:59.940]  I can't... Anyways, it gets out of control sometimes.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:05.145]  But the point is, is that... I'm digressing.
[00:46:07.063 --> 00:46:13.488]  Is that Google is going to put in wireless internet into San Francisco, and then New York, and then Chicago.
[00:46:13.508 --> 00:46:16.230]  There's a whole list of cities that are doing it, and San Francisco first.
[00:46:17.891 --> 00:46:22.654]  Google is moving in with NASA right now, with 6,000 employees.
[00:46:24.496 --> 00:46:27.998]  It's total information awareness, my friends.
[00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:34.863]  They admit that every RFID will be in every Campbell's Soup can, every Gillette razor, every Michelin tire already is.
[00:46:36.249 --> 00:46:39.951]  Every product, everything, down to about two cents a piece, I'll pass that on to you.
[00:46:41.552 --> 00:46:57.939]  It'll be red, right now it's about 50 feet away, with the small chips, 200 yards, with larger chips, that are, you know, just like a piece of scotch tape, that's a, you know, like an inch long piece of scotch tape, about that shape and size, color's black, or whatever color they want to make it, usually dark, to cover up some of the wiring.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.880]  Why does that even matter?
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.740]  Why do I detail things?
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.282]  The point is, is that
[00:47:08.154 --> 00:47:10.115]  Everything in your refrigerator will be scanned.
[00:47:10.155 --> 00:47:11.936]  The trash cans are going to have a chip on it.
[00:47:12.357 --> 00:47:16.259]  And when everything goes into the trash truck, it's going to scan it as it dumps it instantly.
[00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:17.739]  You'll just throw stuff.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.180]  This is already at a lot of different grocery stores.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.902]  You just throw stuff in your cart, and it automatically scans you.
[00:47:23.062 --> 00:47:26.904]  You have to enroll at the store, and it automatically scans you when you come in.
[00:47:28.605 --> 00:47:31.387]  And there's a scanner over the shopping cart.
[00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:48.112]  And so everything you eat, everything you do, everything you buy, when you throw it away, what time you throw it away, how much of it you ate, how much you're eating, who you sell things to, will all be part of the new national sales tax tied into that, which all the neocons are pushing on talk radio as the fair tax.
[00:47:48.412 --> 00:47:49.472]  Total scam!
[00:47:49.673 --> 00:47:51.693]  Let me just tell you, they're going to keep the income tax too.
[00:47:51.713 --> 00:47:56.476]  So when you hear Neil Bortz and all them pushing that, it's a talking point, boys and girls.
[00:47:59.317 --> 00:47:59.817]  But, uh,
[00:48:01.013 --> 00:48:02.134]  So that's what's going on there.
[00:48:02.594 --> 00:48:03.414]  And here's another one.
[00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:09.957]  Delhi Police set up mandatory RFID vehicle inspection.
[00:48:10.457 --> 00:48:12.198]  This is out of the India Express.
[00:48:13.139 --> 00:48:19.321]  The Delhi Traffic Police and Transport Department are planning to equip Delhi's vehicles with RFID tags.
[00:48:19.422 --> 00:48:28.786]  Vehicle tracking system RFID is popularly used the world over for real-time data processing on vehicle movements in cities and also to track traffic offenders.
[00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:30.771]  Yeah, worldwide!
[00:48:30.831 --> 00:48:36.735]  The third world slave countries where they don't have a say, where there's police with machine guns on every corner, what we're becoming.
[00:48:37.796 --> 00:48:39.917]  Uh, Texas, we defeated the bill, barely, this year.
[00:48:40.998 --> 00:48:42.659]  By the hair of our chinny-chin-chins.
[00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:49.524]  And, uh, TexDOT went ahead and ordered two million of them to start.
[00:48:50.204 --> 00:48:53.907]  And they're gonna go ahead and start making you take them, just without even having a law.
[00:48:53.927 --> 00:48:55.568]  It's just criminality.
[00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:59.873]  It's like the Endangered Species Act expired over a decade ago.
[00:49:00.113 --> 00:49:02.514]  There's not even a law, but they just still do it.
[00:49:03.294 --> 00:49:06.055]  Not even a law, it's just, we got guns, man, shut up!
[00:49:07.776 --> 00:49:08.796]  We own you people!
[00:49:10.176 --> 00:49:24.021]  And the world over, yeah, see they just reported in the Delhi Express, in the India Express, out of Delhi, New Delhi, that, oh it's great, everybody does it, oh it's fun, oh it's,
[00:49:24.827 --> 00:49:26.488]  And really, it's not use the world over.
[00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:27.608]  It's going in in England.
[00:49:27.968 --> 00:49:29.268]  It's going in in the U.S.
[00:49:29.929 --> 00:49:32.229]  And yes, they track your every movement with it.
[00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.850]  They will give you tickets.
[00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.010]  Forget red light cameras, folks.
[00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.092]  They will give you tickets from reader to reader for how fast you're driving with your average speed.
[00:49:39.792 --> 00:49:40.772]  Everything will be controlled.
[00:49:40.792 --> 00:49:42.433]  This is hell on earth.
[00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:45.714]  Just like I told you your cell phones track you down to 15 feet.
[00:49:47.071 --> 00:49:51.172]  And nobody believed me when I was telling you this back in 96, and now it's all over the news.
[00:49:51.212 --> 00:50:00.175]  See, years after it's implemented, then they tell you, Oh, by the way, all your new cars for the last eight years have a box that tracks everything you did.
[00:50:00.195 --> 00:50:02.476]  And see, now they're telling you.
[00:50:03.136 --> 00:50:16.220]  They put the straitjacket on you, put you in handcuffs, hang you by your ankles, walk in and smile and go, By the way, you're in chains, and I'm about to put more on you, in case you struggle and bust out of there.
[00:50:18.246 --> 00:50:22.969]  And as soon as we get you chained down good enough, we're going to look you right in the eyes and tell you what we're going to do.
[00:50:22.989 --> 00:50:24.330]  Do you got it?
[00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:26.852]  We're going to take your children.
[00:50:27.192 --> 00:50:28.814]  You're all going to live in dormitories.
[00:50:29.054 --> 00:50:30.935]  And we're going to shave your heads and drug you.
[00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:33.157]  And then we're going to start killing you.
[00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:39.561]  See, if they really told you what they're going to do, they'd say it just like that.
[00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:41.763]  Now it's time, slave.
[00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:44.425]  I've been wanting to do this to you for a long time.
[00:50:45.692 --> 00:50:48.936]  And now we're gonna gut you in your society, cattle.
[00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:50.459]  Cause we like to kill.
[00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:52.301]  Cause we're Luciferians.
[00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:55.125]  Do you understand that our God wants blood?
[00:50:55.505 --> 00:50:57.107]  And we're gonna give blood to him.
[00:50:57.748 --> 00:50:58.689]  Do you understand?
[00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.572]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.793 --> 00:51:03.314]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:06.576]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.716 --> 00:51:10.599]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.659 --> 00:51:14.902]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.243 --> 00:51:19.005]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.086 --> 00:51:20.947]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.147 --> 00:51:24.448]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.488 --> 00:51:29.190]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:32.391]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:35.452]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.933 --> 00:51:42.035]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.575 --> 00:51:46.380]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.781 --> 00:51:48.163]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.483 --> 00:51:49.544]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.564 --> 00:51:51.887]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.907 --> 00:51:53.149]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:01.468 --> 00:52:06.073]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:52:06.273 --> 00:52:10.737]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[00:54:10.685 --> 00:54:14.586]  Later, I've been remiss in reporting on this yesterday.
[00:54:14.606 --> 00:54:16.687]  There's been such a news blackout on it.
[00:54:19.188 --> 00:54:27.851]  There's a big Sooners game going on with 83,000 people in the stadium and some college kid blows himself up and it hardly even makes the news.
[00:54:29.136 --> 00:54:39.364]  And that's an example of the type of control, the type of lockdown they can create, and then they tell us, you know, worry about some new kidnapping, or, you know, let's talk about the new TV shows that are coming out.
[00:54:39.845 --> 00:54:42.767]  Meanwhile, stuff like that's going on right underneath our noses.
[00:54:44.128 --> 00:54:58.520]  We've got some guests coming on to talk about what's happening in New London, Connecticut, as the police state activities just intensify there, and I know we've had callers holding for a while, so we'll go ahead and start going to those calls.
[00:54:59.478 --> 00:55:01.559]  First up is Tim in Nebraska.
[00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:02.220]  Go ahead, Tim.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.922]  Yeah, a few minutes ago you mentioned Whitewash is on the History Channel.
[00:55:07.542 --> 00:55:11.384]  I wondered if you saw that show on Illuminati last night that they had.
[00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:15.026]  You know, I got home so late I only was able to watch a few minutes of it.
[00:55:15.046 --> 00:55:17.327]  But yeah, it looked kind of like a Whitewash to me.
[00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:20.249]  Well, they had four different guests.
[00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:22.850]  One of them was Jim Tucker.
[00:55:24.131 --> 00:55:26.812]  And the other two were pretty good.
[00:55:26.872 --> 00:55:28.893]  And one of them was like a real skeptic.
[00:55:30.018 --> 00:55:33.861]  And, uh, overall I thought the thing was pretty good.
[00:55:34.361 --> 00:55:40.366]  And then right at the end, they let the guy that was the skeptic, he had the last word.
[00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:46.350]  I just looked over at my wife and go, well, yeah, that's the History Channel's last word on that subject.
[00:55:48.692 --> 00:55:51.074]  But, uh, I was just wondering if you saw that.
[00:55:51.254 --> 00:55:53.696]  Well, the History Channel, I did watch a few minutes.
[00:55:53.736 --> 00:55:57.399]  The History Channel, what they do is, they
[00:55:58.573 --> 00:56:02.656]  I imagine things are just getting out so much that they can't ignore it, so they have to put some of it out.
[00:56:22.438 --> 00:56:24.259]  And some people are horrified by that.
[00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:24.579]  No!
[00:56:25.159 --> 00:56:26.960]  Our point is, we want to take over.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:28.900]  We want to get the Constitution back.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.421]  We want to become the mainstream.
[00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:47.786]  And by mainstream, we want the mainstream to want to have the people in the government arrested and tried for treason, and we want to have the CFR members arrested, and we want to have grand juries indict them, and we want to get our country back.
[00:56:48.627 --> 00:56:49.687]  I mean, it's really simple.
[00:56:50.535 --> 00:56:52.596]  We're in this to win.
[00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:55.858]  We don't care what their lies are, what their propaganda is.
[00:56:55.938 --> 00:56:56.779]  We ignore it.
[00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:59.600]  We move forward with the truth.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.862]  The power of our testimony cannot be resisted.
[00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:05.263]  Well, people are waking up.
[00:57:05.344 --> 00:57:11.687]  I learned of four new people in this little town that know all about this yesterday.
[00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.370]  Things are moving along pretty good, I think.
[00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:18.100]  Well, that's good news.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.701]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:21.603]  I mean, look, we're not playing games.
[00:57:21.683 --> 00:57:22.564]  This isn't a joke.
[00:57:22.604 --> 00:57:40.600]  This isn't about... Some people in the so-called Patriot Movement want to be like a little clique or something, and they're the commander, and only they have the answers, and you must subscribe exactly to what I say, and it's our little group, and... I'm not into that orthodoxy.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.063]  It's everybody loving freedom, getting involved, you are leaders,
[00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:49.319]  You know, don't believe what I say, research what I claim, learn for yourself.
[00:57:51.299 --> 00:57:52.339]  I'm not your leader.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.180]  It really boils down to that.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:05.642]  We're going to break and we'll come back and talk to Joe, John, Dino, and Daniel, and many others that are patiently holding when we start the second hour.
[00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.302]  And there is so much news today.
[00:58:07.762 --> 00:58:12.023]  You know, there's an article out of The Sun, there's also one out of Reuters,
[00:58:13.738 --> 00:58:23.502]  With shark fishermen on a French island, they take puppies, Labrador Retrievers, and put big hooks through their noses, and then the dog swims.
[00:58:23.522 --> 00:58:27.323]  It's like live bait, like a minnow, for the big great white sharks.
[00:58:27.443 --> 00:58:31.964]  And these Richie Riches come in because they want to catch a great white and do this.
[00:58:31.984 --> 00:58:34.005]  See, that's how decadent we're getting, folks.
[00:58:34.926 --> 00:58:38.907]  The people that are doing this, they need to be used as shark bait.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.165]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.144]  If you were listening at the end of last hour,
[00:59:20.313 --> 00:59:23.556]  To this live Tuesday, the 4th of October 2005 edition.
[00:59:24.056 --> 00:59:25.277]  You would have heard me right.
[00:59:25.577 --> 00:59:27.499]  I have the sun here in front of me out of England.
[00:59:27.539 --> 00:59:28.680]  I also have a Reuters article.
[00:59:30.661 --> 00:59:34.684]  Yes, a little French island where the Richie Riches come to go shark fishing.
[00:59:35.265 --> 00:59:36.606]  Nothing like live bait.
[00:59:36.666 --> 00:59:39.288]  You and I, when we go fishing, buy minnows and they swim around.
[00:59:39.808 --> 00:59:44.092]  Imagine taking a Lambrador Retriever, 50 pound adolescent puppy.
[00:59:45.999 --> 01:00:01.746]  And because they can swim for hours, they're tough little dogs, they're water dogs, and putting two big hooks through its nose, through its snout, through its cartilage, and throwing the dog overboard, and dragging it around in the water with chum, terrorizing it.
[01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:09.110]  Guaranteed, folks, they find out who's doing this, it's pretty popular, according to reports, they're going to be Satanists in their off time.
[01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:14.232]  But again, that's the globalists see us as those little dogs.
[01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:16.768]  I mean, how can somebody... I just love dogs.
[01:00:16.848 --> 01:00:23.151]  I mean, how can you switch off... switch off the... the shepherding mechanism you have for your dog?
[01:00:23.992 --> 01:00:28.674]  I mean, you know, they're just sweet, they love you, they're good, they're... they're nice, they're friendly.
[01:00:28.694 --> 01:00:34.877]  I mean, I'd like to get a hold of the people that are putting big shark hooks through their snouts.
[01:00:37.078 --> 01:00:42.241]  And, uh... And letting those big sharks hit that dog and...
[01:00:43.903 --> 01:00:45.204]  It's just pure scum.
[01:00:46.926 --> 01:00:48.527]  Pure, absolute scum.
[01:00:48.547 --> 01:00:52.290]  Now, I don't want to rant and rant about it all day.
[01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:57.495]  I'll read the article later, but again, you and I can't imagine that, but that goes on.
[01:00:57.835 --> 01:01:05.842]  We can't imagine mobile death vans, 25 of them, in one city alone, 24, excuse me, just roving around, grabbing political dissidents.
[01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:07.243]  There's a billion
[01:01:08.328 --> 01:01:09.609]  And they have people in China, folks.
[01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:11.410]  So they need that many vans.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:12.710]  Just one big city.
[01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.511]  Driving around murdering people.
[01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:15.231]  Hanging them up.
[01:01:15.252 --> 01:01:16.532]  Putting their skin in one bucket.
[01:01:17.192 --> 01:01:19.654]  Parts and livers and kidneys in little frozen cases.
[01:01:19.734 --> 01:01:20.414]  Mailing them out.
[01:01:22.395 --> 01:01:26.877]  And they just keep them in little jails until the appointed time when the rich person flies in to get their liver.
[01:01:27.378 --> 01:01:28.098]  Or get their kidney.
[01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.118]  And then they just go get them.
[01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:31.660]  For some reason they don't even kill them in the jails.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.361]  They just take them right out and get the surgeons ready in a little van.
[01:01:36.062 --> 01:01:38.023]  They gut them and haul them up and do it all.
[01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:41.522]  Well, let's give the government our guns.
[01:01:41.582 --> 01:01:42.864]  Let's trust the government.
[01:01:42.904 --> 01:01:43.905]  Everything's fine.
[01:01:44.686 --> 01:01:45.968]  Everything's good.
[01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:47.311]  Let's just submit to them.
[01:01:48.052 --> 01:01:49.234]  Let's talk to Joe!
[01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.500]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.400]  Where are you calling from?
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.260]  Wisconsin.
[01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:53.921]  Welcome.
[01:01:54.221 --> 01:01:59.183]  Alex, I'm sort of glad that you did the shark story because one thing and one thing only.
[01:01:59.423 --> 01:02:01.764]  We're next in that food chain.
[01:02:02.125 --> 01:02:04.766]  And if you think that they'll stop there, you're wrong.
[01:02:05.146 --> 01:02:09.308]  Like you said, they have no feelings, compunctions, morals, anything.
[01:02:09.748 --> 01:02:11.389]  So don't confuse
[01:02:12.324 --> 01:02:13.465]  Morality with them.
[01:02:13.805 --> 01:02:23.072]  Imagine those lab puppies, you know, sticking their tongues out, trying to be sweet, you know, scooting around on their hind ends, begging, and they just grab them and, yeah, put an old hook in them.
[01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:35.482]  Anyway, I did some fact-checking this morning, and for all you people who think you're such a good person that you pay your taxes and all that, I'll tell you what the state thinks of you, at least our state, my state.
[01:02:36.343 --> 01:02:36.623]  You're
[01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:43.077]  Paying your taxes, you maybe make $40,000 a year, you pay $5,000 to the state.
[01:02:43.638 --> 01:02:45.418]  The state looks at you as $5,000.
[01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:48.239]  That's all they see you as.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:55.663]  And if they put you in a federal prison, they get paid $40,000 off the top.
[01:02:56.183 --> 01:02:59.744]  You just became eight times more valuable to the state of Wisconsin.
[01:03:00.304 --> 01:03:04.306]  And the government, the government, the feds, this is money they took from us to begin with.
[01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:04.746]  Oh yeah!
[01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:06.287]  These are federal balance.
[01:03:07.068 --> 01:03:07.988]  Now think about this.
[01:03:08.849 --> 01:03:14.870]  You know how much money you'd have to make to pay in state taxes in order to give them the $40,000?
[01:03:15.131 --> 01:03:18.392]  You'd have to make $471,000.
[01:03:18.932 --> 01:03:21.112]  I ran the numbers.
[01:03:21.753 --> 01:03:24.273]  It's like, wow, I don't know anybody who makes that much.
[01:03:24.813 --> 01:03:29.575]  All you people who think that you're so great, you are nothing to the state.
[01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:33.194]  Yeah, they'll just, you know, stick you in prison and save money.
[01:03:33.734 --> 01:03:34.755]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:34.775 --> 01:03:36.515]  The point you bring up is so salient.
[01:03:36.696 --> 01:03:37.316]  Anything else?
[01:03:37.796 --> 01:03:38.756]  Yeah, I was going to say... Well, you know what?
[01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:39.156]  Stay there.
[01:03:39.197 --> 01:03:40.457]  I've got a guest coming on for 20 minutes.
[01:03:40.477 --> 01:03:43.218]  If you want to hold that long, I'll go back to you, because you're making good points.
[01:03:43.578 --> 01:03:44.859]  Or you can say bye-a-can-dee-us.
[01:03:45.339 --> 01:03:46.119]  I'll be right back, folks.
[01:03:46.139 --> 01:03:46.459]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.904 --> 01:03:57.765]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.026 --> 01:03:59.606]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:04:14.214 --> 01:04:14.954]  The Constitution has

[01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:14.659]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.819 --> 01:06:21.862]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:22.082 --> 01:06:23.283]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:23.443 --> 01:06:26.826]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:26.886 --> 01:06:28.007]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:28.287 --> 01:06:29.588]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:36.613]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:43.377]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:43.437 --> 01:06:46.318]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:13.591]  We're going to talk about Lord Bush's ultra-socialist big government pimp that he wants to put in as the new Supreme Court minion.
[01:07:15.268 --> 01:07:21.593]  I mean, this lady is basically a Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and so the liberals are now hailing Lord Bush.
[01:07:21.714 --> 01:07:23.315]  You should have been hailing him the whole time!
[01:07:23.695 --> 01:07:26.518]  Doubling in size of government, gun-grabbing, open borders.
[01:07:26.978 --> 01:07:31.502]  I'm telling the Democrats, if you believe in your screwed-up philosophy, then you should love George Bush!
[01:07:31.522 --> 01:07:35.345]  I mean, you should love his dirty Supreme Court saying we don't own our private property!
[01:07:36.106 --> 01:07:38.408]  Alright, Joe and John and, of course,
[01:07:39.631 --> 01:07:45.214]  Daniel and Zeke and Art and everybody, we're going to get to your calls coming up in about 20 minutes or so.
[01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:50.037]  The next 20 minutes though, we're going to have a very important guest on who's really doing some important work.
[01:07:51.598 --> 01:08:01.603]  We cannot forget about New London, Connecticut, which in the words of my guest, won the publicity lottery, but they won it because that was the Supreme Court ruling of a few months ago.
[01:08:02.808 --> 01:08:19.839]  But what's been hidden in the mainstream news is that not only are they saying any private land barons can come pay off city councils or county councils or county courts to steal your property, just compensation is not given.
[01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:25.363]  On average they offer about 25% of what the tax rolls say.
[01:08:26.123 --> 01:08:28.745]  Of course market value could be 50% more, best price,
[01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:34.676]  Or the best use could be three times that.
[01:08:34.696 --> 01:08:43.281]  I mean, when they force some old lady to sell for a highway or for a shopping mall, sometimes a house that's really worth $200,000, she might get a million.
[01:08:43.702 --> 01:08:48.365]  And I think that's good, because this imminent domain is dangerous enough.
[01:08:48.845 --> 01:09:00.133]  About three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled, in a case up by Reno, and the big lake up there, that they could take people's property, the government could, without just compensation.
[01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:01.825]  How's that sound to you?
[01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:11.948]  And now the New London Board, which of course is totally corrupt in all these conflicts of interest, they're moving to charge people rent who've been fighting them for five years.
[01:09:12.028 --> 01:09:19.130]  Now imagine, they just hang a notice on your door saying, your house is condemned so now we're not going to pay you the value of the house, now we're going to pay you for the lot.
[01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:26.012]  But you've got to keep paying property taxes or we're going to take it at full value and we're going to charge you rent.
[01:09:26.072 --> 01:09:28.052]  So that's the big dirty secret.
[01:09:28.092 --> 01:09:30.073]  The revving bulldozers, the threats,
[01:09:30.965 --> 01:09:34.567]  I mean, literally, they've been under siege in this middle class area.
[01:09:35.047 --> 01:09:38.169]  And now, all over Texas, they're announcing they're going to start land grabbing.
[01:09:38.449 --> 01:09:41.031]  The supposed bills to restrict it really do nothing.
[01:09:41.731 --> 01:09:43.492]  The stuff in Congress is a whitewash.
[01:09:44.409 --> 01:09:47.832]  You know, the people that come to, quote, save us are really giving us a whitewash.
[01:09:48.412 --> 01:09:55.998]  Here's your free country, folks, where the supposed socialist, Chavez, down in Venezuela, is giving people the deeds.
[01:09:56.618 --> 01:10:03.744]  The land that was stolen from the people 50, 60 years ago, he's giving it back to people with deeds.
[01:10:04.805 --> 01:10:10.529]  So a socialist does that, and then, a supposed socialist, and then in America, this is happening.
[01:10:11.622 --> 01:10:15.925]  And to fill us in on all the latest developments is Doug Swartz.
[01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:17.446]  Here's a quote from Doug in the paper.
[01:10:17.906 --> 01:10:21.648]  I think she said more than any of us could have said it by not speaking.
[01:10:22.088 --> 01:10:25.810]  The event organizer and a member of the coalition to save the Fort Tumble neighborhood.
[01:10:26.191 --> 01:10:31.774]  He was one of several speakers who touted the bravery of the woman who was arrested for just walking into the city council.
[01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:37.111]  And berated the city for trying to snatch private property for commercial use.
[01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:46.756]  The event began with Dan Gross, a new London resident who wrote a song titled, Shame, Shame, Imminent Domain, asking Fort Trumbull residents to step up to the microphone.
[01:10:47.116 --> 01:10:55.560]  None came to the microphone when asked, but two residents, including Richard Breyer, who owns the 4149 Gossett Street, attended the event.
[01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.242]  So let's go ahead and go to our guest, Doug Swartz.
[01:11:00.282 --> 01:11:01.123]  Doug, thanks for coming on.
[01:11:01.784 --> 01:11:02.984]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:11:03.804 --> 01:11:07.385]  I tell you, I may have to move to Russia so I can own some private property.
[01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:13.106]  Well, you know about the Free State, they're all trying to move up to New Hampshire as the last bastion of freedom.
[01:11:13.146 --> 01:11:18.687]  And your guests, excuse me, your listeners all are familiar with the Lauren Canario story now?
[01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:20.708]  I don't think they are fully.
[01:11:20.728 --> 01:11:22.648]  Why don't you give us the... Let me start at the beginning.
[01:11:22.708 --> 01:11:26.089]  She's a... They're just libertarians, completely harmless.
[01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:36.272]  Uh, the Free Staters, and they voted to select New Hampshire as the place to try to move a whole bunch of them into.
[01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:37.573]  Yeah, they did that two years ago.
[01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:43.637]  Yeah, you know, and Lauren was interested in this case, and she stopped out to visit this summer.
[01:11:44.369 --> 01:11:48.770]  I guess it was early August, and then she wanted to see for herself, get in on the ground.
[01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:51.431]  And by the way, they always turn it around.
[01:11:51.491 --> 01:12:03.334]  It's like an Air Force or an Army colonel goes public that the government was protecting Mohammed Adda, but now the nightly news is about $63 in cell phone bills that he might have cheated on as a colonel.
[01:12:03.434 --> 01:12:09.696]  So they're going, how dare her come in from outside, so the council is saying she doesn't have any rights.
[01:12:09.956 --> 01:12:13.617]  That's even more honorable, that she would move there.
[01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:14.438]  Absolutely.
[01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:15.098]  Absolutely.
[01:12:15.138 --> 01:12:16.220]  Move there to fight!
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.764]  I mean, that's like in the Revolutionary War, people walkin' 200 miles to fight the British!
[01:12:20.824 --> 01:12:22.626]  Yeah, one of our city councils.
[01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.928]  And by the way, you mentioned our corrupt city council.
[01:12:24.948 --> 01:12:27.511]  We have some of the best politicians money can buy here.
[01:12:28.314 --> 01:12:29.274]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:12:29.294 --> 01:12:30.295]  Tell us the whole story.
[01:12:30.675 --> 01:12:31.295]  Go ahead.
[01:12:31.315 --> 01:12:32.535]  You can't shut up, but that's okay.
[01:12:33.836 --> 01:12:35.516]  Well, I'm mad about this!
[01:12:36.496 --> 01:12:41.638]  He said that what she was doing was a disgrace and he wasn't going to be bullied or pushed around by anybody from Las Vegas.
[01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:42.578]  Well, she lives here now.
[01:12:42.638 --> 01:12:46.319]  She was so enthused about it that she moved here, which is great.
[01:12:46.359 --> 01:12:47.560]  I mean, we've been fighting this since 1998.
[01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:51.891]  So any help we can get is welcome.
[01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:53.853]  Well, they're saying she doesn't have rights.
[01:12:53.913 --> 01:12:55.634]  I mean, I've read the quotes on air.
[01:12:55.874 --> 01:12:59.497]  They're saying, well, she doesn't really have any rights because she just moved here.
[01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:01.098]  We all have rights.
[01:13:01.138 --> 01:13:05.702]  I mean, if I'm in California on vacation, I've got my constitution.
[01:13:06.503 --> 01:13:09.585]  Well, uh, no, it's accurate.
[01:13:09.645 --> 01:13:11.527]  I'll get to the rights they just trashed her.
[01:13:11.547 --> 01:13:13.008]  She doesn't have any rights right now.
[01:13:13.869 --> 01:13:15.190]  And she's back in court today.
[01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:18.091]  We'll see what happens if they finally release her for nothing, basically.
[01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:19.812]  This is like a Seinfeld episode.
[01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:21.392]  You know, that was about nothing.
[01:13:21.412 --> 01:13:22.333]  This is about nothing.
[01:13:22.433 --> 01:13:28.896]  What she did, she went to city council meeting on September 19th, which is two weeks ago yesterday.
[01:13:29.816 --> 01:13:35.278]  And they pulled this squirrely deal where they suddenly declared the fire escape condemned.
[01:13:35.799 --> 01:13:37.820]  So they limited the room to 49 people.
[01:13:39.474 --> 01:13:45.518]  Now in the city, municipal employees unions have been showing up in recent months to fight for their budget.
[01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:54.023]  They've packed the place, but on the night we were gonna go into it with the eminent domain and all that, 49 people.
[01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.886]  Now look at that, they use condemnation right there!
[01:13:57.986 --> 01:13:59.186]  These guys are nuts!
[01:13:59.487 --> 01:14:01.348]  Well the city hall's blighted, it's gotta go.
[01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.580]  So there's a lot of yelling and screaming.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:21.367]  I happened to be inside the council at the time, and that councillor who was quoted as saying she's a disgrace, he comes in and starts harrumphing, harrumphing, harrumphing about how they're up for re-election in November.
[01:14:21.387 --> 01:14:28.951]  How one of the challenging candidates, and this happens to be one of the people who had his home seized by eminent domain, so he's running for office now.
[01:14:29.652 --> 01:14:33.654]  Two people actually who had their homes seized are running for office on the city council this year.
[01:14:34.492 --> 01:14:44.677]  And he starts rumping about how one of the candidates is out in the hallway trying to incite a riot, encouraging people to attack the police, and, you know, the police are there to protect us.
[01:14:44.717 --> 01:14:45.518]  That's criminal!
[01:14:45.578 --> 01:14:47.539]  That's fire in a theater, and that's slander!
[01:14:47.659 --> 01:14:54.462]  Yeah, well, it was slander because actually he was trying to diffuse the situation, and the counselor was forced to retract those comments.
[01:14:55.004 --> 01:14:56.345]  I need to sue that bastard.
[01:14:56.505 --> 01:15:01.388]  Oh yeah, but his name is Robert Pero, if your friends want to send him email, your listeners.
[01:15:02.408 --> 01:15:05.890]  So, Lauren got so upset that she sat down on the floor.
[01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.191]  You know, they wouldn't let her in.
[01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:12.373]  They wouldn't allow her to use her First Amendment right to ask for a redress of grievances, so she just sat down on the floor.
[01:15:12.434 --> 01:15:13.994]  And that's the last thing she's done.
[01:15:15.355 --> 01:15:17.976]  She has refused to cooperate with the courts.
[01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:20.138]  She hasn't been fingerprinted.
[01:15:20.158 --> 01:15:23.299]  She hasn't participated in her prosecution.
[01:15:23.339 --> 01:15:24.340]  She hasn't said anything.
[01:15:25.009 --> 01:15:29.452]  So in this morning's paper, yesterday a reporter finally got in to talk to her.
[01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:32.234]  We ticketed the prison over a week ago.
[01:15:33.314 --> 01:15:36.416]  And they got so nervous with ten people showed up with signs out in front.
[01:15:36.456 --> 01:15:39.578]  They shut down visitation for the whole rest of the day for all the other prisoners.
[01:15:39.679 --> 01:15:41.760]  So people got mad at us, but you know.
[01:15:42.884 --> 01:15:44.605]  Yeah, you gotta love that.
[01:15:44.645 --> 01:15:49.146]  When the police state thugs abuse people, the sheep go, you should be nice to the Nazis.
[01:15:49.326 --> 01:15:51.787]  You should line up nicely and go into the gas chambers.
[01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:53.008]  What are you doing?
[01:15:53.068 --> 01:15:53.788]  Don't complain.
[01:15:53.868 --> 01:15:54.748]  Thank you, officer.
[01:15:55.409 --> 01:15:55.869]  Thank you.
[01:15:57.569 --> 01:15:58.730]  But get this.
[01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.371]  So here's what the reporter reports in this morning's statement.
[01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.732]  You know what they did to her for just remaining silent?
[01:16:03.752 --> 01:16:04.932]  This is such a threat to them?
[01:16:06.193 --> 01:16:06.873]  They put her
[01:16:07.589 --> 01:16:10.610]  In a solitary psychiatric cell.
[01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:12.190]  Of course you're mentally ill!
[01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:16.371]  Oh yeah, no books, no TV, no radio, pens, paper, nothing.
[01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:18.351]  No contact with the outside world.
[01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:19.551]  This is the first she does.
[01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:25.092]  Sir, let me... In most areas, they will have her in a restraining chair soon, which is torture.
[01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:29.213]  Well, when they took her in the court, she refused to... and the picture was in the paper.
[01:16:30.093 --> 01:16:33.114]  She refused to walk, you know, so they had her shackled.
[01:16:34.634 --> 01:16:36.898]  This is for non-violent civil disobedience.
[01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:39.524]  Shackled hand and foot and in a wheelchair.
[01:16:40.467 --> 01:16:48.751]  Let me tell you, they put you in a restraining chair and jack it up where you can't breathe, and you're literally like Christ, suffocating, and that's how they like to torture you.
[01:16:49.011 --> 01:16:51.472]  You better watch it.
[01:16:52.032 --> 01:16:54.413]  If this keeps dragging on, they may use that on her, but go ahead.
[01:16:54.673 --> 01:16:57.374]  Well, hopefully they'll let her out today, because it's become an embarrassment.
[01:16:57.454 --> 01:16:58.955]  Well, they like to torture people, but go ahead.
[01:16:58.975 --> 01:17:02.076]  Yeah, I mean, this is straight Gandhi and civil disobedience tactics.
[01:17:02.096 --> 01:17:03.037]  They're trying to be stupid.
[01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:04.017]  You just help them, you know?
[01:17:06.673 --> 01:17:09.634]  But let me get the quote for you in the paper today.
[01:17:09.654 --> 01:17:14.936]  There's a couple of quotes from her in the paper.
[01:17:15.257 --> 01:17:19.138]  The Supreme Court made a wrong ruling, and they need to know it was wrong.
[01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.539]  The government is there to protect our property rights.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:33.384]  And she said that she's going to stay in there as long as she needs to to make her point.
[01:17:35.309 --> 01:17:39.150]  And that's the key thing, and she's making her point very eloquently with her silence.
[01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:41.010]  Well, she's done nothing wrong!
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.130]  Yeah, and look what they've done to her.
[01:17:43.211 --> 01:17:44.931]  First of all, she has a right to a speedy trial.
[01:17:45.811 --> 01:17:48.111]  Second of all, a right not to have excessive bail.
[01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:58.073]  Okay, a bail started out at $5,000, which was steep to begin with, but one judge got so torqued that he doubled it up to, he or she, we're not sure who did it, up to $10,000.
[01:17:59.293 --> 01:18:02.414]  She has a right to remain silent in the Fifth Amendment.
[01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:05.880]  She has a right to address the City Council for redress agreements.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.582]  She has a right to due process in the Fifth Amendment, which is trash.
[01:18:10.843 --> 01:18:15.105]  The people she's trying to defend under the Fifth Amendment have a right to private property.
[01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:19.614]  I mean, they've just shredded a good chunk of the Bill of Rights.
[01:18:20.174 --> 01:18:24.538]  And that's why the American people had such a visceral reaction to the Kelo decision.
[01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:28.241]  Because property rights is the cornerstone to the Bill of Rights.
[01:18:28.261 --> 01:18:34.926]  Well, if 99% of Americans in a CNN poll are against the ruling, how are these creatures going to stay in office?
[01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:36.828]  Well, let me tell you about that.
[01:18:36.868 --> 01:18:38.749]  Are there special electronic voting machines?
[01:18:38.849 --> 01:18:39.710]  Were those just put in?
[01:18:41.331 --> 01:18:43.613]  No, but back in 2000... Well, we'll stay there.
[01:18:43.633 --> 01:18:44.354]  We've got a break, sir.
[01:18:45.243 --> 01:18:48.885]  I'm sure they're moving very quickly to put the special machines in and then it won't matter.
[01:18:49.466 --> 01:18:51.147]  They'll claim that you're voting for hell on earth.
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:58.391]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.451 --> 01:19:00.192]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:09.259]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:12.121]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:19:55.382 --> 01:19:56.423]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:56.763 --> 01:19:59.544]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect up here at home?
[01:19:59.804 --> 01:20:03.967]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:05.227]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.527 --> 01:20:10.110]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.712]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:13.213 --> 01:20:14.114]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:20:14.514 --> 01:20:18.218]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[01:20:54.577 --> 01:20:56.819]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.239 --> 01:21:01.603]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.863 --> 01:21:07.668]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.908 --> 01:21:11.971]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:12.252 --> 01:21:17.176]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.196 --> 01:21:18.397]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.241]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:29.042]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:29.363 --> 01:21:31.683]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:32.064 --> 01:21:35.685]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:36.165 --> 01:21:42.368]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:42.788 --> 01:21:43.768]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.788 --> 01:21:44.448]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.468 --> 01:21:44.648]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.551 --> 01:21:56.152]  Government of death which governs me.
[01:21:56.713 --> 01:21:58.014]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:58.454 --> 01:22:01.157]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:01.597 --> 01:22:04.239]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:11.125]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:33.451]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:33.612 --> 01:22:33.932]  Have you?
[01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:36.033]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:40.217]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:22:40.237 --> 01:22:44.260]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.761]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:22:46.322 --> 01:22:47.503]  Osama Bin Forgotten.

[01:22:56.573 --> 01:22:57.033]  Don't worry.
[01:22:57.533 --> 01:22:59.074]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:02.335]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.755 --> 01:23:06.237]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:06.257 --> 01:23:10.818]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:11.318 --> 01:23:15.560]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.921]  The ring of fire.
[01:23:18.281 --> 01:23:19.101]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:20.582]  Our final segment with our guest.
[01:23:20.622 --> 01:23:23.343]  We're going to take your calls and cover news coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:24.565 --> 01:23:27.007]  We're talking to Doug Schwartz.
[01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:28.388]  Doug, please continue.
[01:23:28.408 --> 01:23:29.329]  This lady's been in there now.
[01:23:29.349 --> 01:23:30.489]  This is her 15th day.
[01:23:30.509 --> 01:23:35.393]  Tomorrow will be 16 days, and she was in court today.
[01:23:35.433 --> 01:23:36.674]  What happened when she was in court?
[01:23:36.914 --> 01:23:42.198]  Well, we haven't found that out yet, but we'll find out tomorrow, or tonight if she gets out.
[01:23:43.579 --> 01:23:45.020]  And this isn't about Lauren.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.482]  It's not about Suzette Kelo, the lead plaintiff.
[01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:56.857]  And this, I started to say, this is why the American people have reacted so violently to the Kelo decision, because that's the cornerstone of the Bill of Rights property rights.
[01:23:56.877 --> 01:24:01.601]  But notice the same people that will violate that are violating all our other rights.
[01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:03.622]  Yeah, that's what I'm getting to.
[01:24:03.862 --> 01:24:08.266]  This is, Warren's case has really underscored that.
[01:24:09.587 --> 01:24:11.028]  And we're in trouble.
[01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:12.429]  Big trouble.
[01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:18.154]  If the Kelo decision is allowed to stand, it's not going to be allowed to stand eventually.
[01:24:18.818 --> 01:24:22.859]  And I'm pretty optimistic that this is a turning point and people are starting to take back their government.
[01:24:22.879 --> 01:24:24.919]  Well, I was talking to you off-air earlier, Doug.
[01:24:24.979 --> 01:24:26.179]  I mean, this is going on.
[01:24:26.219 --> 01:24:30.500]  They've been stealing property and not even giving people just compensation for a long time.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.440]  Oh, many decades.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.901]  And it's got to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people across the country.
[01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:38.281]  And the thing is, everybody knows, Alex, that it's crooked.
[01:24:39.662 --> 01:24:44.123]  It's somebody who's wired, you know, greasing some politician.
[01:24:44.563 --> 01:24:46.663]  And that's what it is every single time.
[01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.212]  And they're just trying to get property on the chief.
[01:24:49.432 --> 01:24:49.992]  It's simple.
[01:24:50.032 --> 01:24:55.196]  They go pay off their buddy, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, and he goes around stealing property from them.
[01:24:55.337 --> 01:24:56.738]  Oh yeah, and that happened in New London.
[01:24:56.778 --> 01:24:58.259]  We know who took the bribes on this one.
[01:24:58.859 --> 01:24:59.400]  But the U.S.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.083]  Supreme Court, they don't want to hear anything about it.
[01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:06.346]  They've got their, you know, it's really a communist agenda.
[01:25:07.246 --> 01:25:09.308]  And, you know, they're pushing forward with it.
[01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:10.441]  Well, it's simple.
[01:25:10.461 --> 01:25:11.722]  I wouldn't even call it fascistic.
[01:25:11.742 --> 01:25:14.964]  You've got the Supreme Court following along with the corporate edicts.
[01:25:15.004 --> 01:25:16.104]  They don't want private property.
[01:25:16.504 --> 01:25:19.366]  I mean, literally, it's the land barons get to steal property.
[01:25:19.586 --> 01:25:22.227]  Well, yeah, and in this case, the corporate entity is Pfizer.
[01:25:22.327 --> 01:25:25.689]  Pfizer's one of the top ten largest companies in the world.
[01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:29.171]  I'm not sure what it is, but it's the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world.
[01:25:30.111 --> 01:25:37.815]  And they announced in February, the first week in February of 1998, that they were coming into the neighborhood.
[01:25:38.624 --> 01:25:40.246]  And they got a sweetheart deal, let me tell you.
[01:25:40.847 --> 01:25:48.336]  Well, about a week and a half before they announced, the first notices started going out from the real estate agents threatening eminent domain.
[01:25:49.076 --> 01:25:50.278]  So do the math, you know.
[01:25:50.976 --> 01:25:52.336]  I mean, they're not kidding anybody.
[01:25:52.476 --> 01:26:02.420]  And in fact, for those who don't know, Pfizer, Walmart, all of them, they end up getting a system where they pay no tax, because again, they give money to the politicians.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.980]  Oh, they've got everybody bought up on the East Coast.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.862]  I mean, you know, all our congressmen, senators, legislators, the whole bit.
[01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:09.682]  It's disgusting.
[01:26:10.602 --> 01:26:12.503]  Why don't we just start making them gods?
[01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:16.484]  Like, put actual gold crowns on their heads and we can kneel before them and
[01:26:19.484 --> 01:26:22.545]  But anyhow, you'll enjoy this part.
[01:26:22.585 --> 01:26:26.606]  Back in 2000, the City Council voted 6-1 to use the eminent domain.
[01:26:27.906 --> 01:26:30.266]  And we went after those six in the next election.
[01:26:30.326 --> 01:26:32.887]  The guy who voted against it was easily re-elected.
[01:26:33.847 --> 01:26:36.348]  And only two of them made it through the next election.
[01:26:37.608 --> 01:26:41.409]  And we're going after their successors.
[01:26:41.549 --> 01:26:44.289]  Those two are still there, but we're going after them again in November.
[01:26:44.429 --> 01:26:48.330]  Well, if you've got now your people in, why can't you reverse what's already started?
[01:26:49.196 --> 01:26:57.639]  Well, the people that snuck in back in the 2000 election... They gave up their authority to a private crime syndicate, the New London Development Corporation.
[01:26:57.659 --> 01:26:59.299]  Well, they were wolves in sheep's clothing.
[01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:01.140]  They were, you know, spies.
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:03.641]  They were pretending to be anti... Yeah, that's how it works.
[01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:05.021]  We're talking about billions of bucks here.
[01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:07.362]  Oh yeah, and there's too much money at stake.
[01:27:07.662 --> 01:27:14.104]  But this time, we've got people who are running and actually have their homes seized, so you don't have to worry which side they're on.
[01:27:16.117 --> 01:27:20.458]  But we called our city council here the two-year Taliban, because they're up for every other year.
[01:27:21.318 --> 01:27:25.659]  But we've got to make politicians' lives miserable across the country.
[01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:33.701]  I mean, in Hartford, we're going up to Hartford, our state capital, Thursday, because they're having legislative hearings on their proposed eminent domain reform.
[01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.642]  And this is a Democrat-controlled legislature.
[01:27:36.662 --> 01:27:40.343]  And let me tell you, they're actually trying to expand the use of eminent domain.
[01:27:40.363 --> 01:27:41.763]  That's how slimy these guys are.
[01:27:42.819 --> 01:27:45.961]  And they're trying to codify what they did in New London.
[01:27:46.062 --> 01:27:57.030]  And what they did in New London, according to the Supreme Court, was a carefully considered plan and went through all the hurdles and the approvals and the public hearings and the meetings and the investigations.
[01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:57.590]  Well, it didn't.
[01:27:58.090 --> 01:27:59.491]  It was a steamroller job.
[01:27:59.551 --> 01:28:00.892]  Completely run out of Hartford.
[01:28:01.513 --> 01:28:04.615]  Our governor at the time, John Rowland, is in prison right now.
[01:28:05.536 --> 01:28:09.299]  His chief of staff ran this whole operation out of Hartford.
[01:28:09.319 --> 01:28:10.680]  He goes on trial for fraud.
[01:28:11.852 --> 01:28:14.173]  On federal trial later on this fall.
[01:28:14.273 --> 01:28:15.254]  Again, it's simple.
[01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:18.976]  Criminals get into government, they take over, it's called tyranny.
[01:28:19.957 --> 01:28:22.538]  Doug Swartz, is there a website that you'd like to give out?
[01:28:24.379 --> 01:28:28.601]  Not right now, but we can get in touch with you in the future, maybe.
[01:28:29.782 --> 01:28:36.085]  Well, we want to support you and we want to get this poor lady out of jail, so if they keep her or start abusing her more, be sure and give us a call.
[01:28:36.446 --> 01:28:37.186]  You got it, Alex.
[01:28:37.326 --> 01:28:38.127]  Thank you for having me.
[01:28:38.287 --> 01:28:39.567]  No, thanks for all you're doing, Doug.
[01:28:39.607 --> 01:28:40.528]  Take care, Mr. Swartz.
[01:28:44.145 --> 01:28:47.134]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.057 --> 01:28:50.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.679 --> 01:28:57.481]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:28:57.601 --> 01:29:02.664]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:29:02.884 --> 01:29:09.067]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:29:09.348 --> 01:29:14.991]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:29:15.251 --> 01:29:17.932]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease.
[01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:20.753]  And Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:29:20.993 --> 01:29:24.835]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:29:24.855 --> 01:29:30.116]  A one month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95 and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:29:30.317 --> 01:29:30.517]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:30.537 --> 01:29:31.497]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[01:29:37.119 --> 01:29:41.323]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:29:41.523 --> 01:29:44.445]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:49.510]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:52.092]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be!
[01:29:53.766 --> 01:29:56.787]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.107 --> 01:30:02.028]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.268 --> 01:30:06.649]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:11.831]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:15.852]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.052 --> 01:30:19.653]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.953 --> 01:30:24.998]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.298 --> 01:30:31.985]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.498 --> 01:30:33.138]  What about you?
[01:30:33.798 --> 01:30:39.160]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.240]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.260]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.462]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:00.485]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[01:31:00.825 --> 01:31:04.869]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:31:05.089 --> 01:31:14.377]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:31:14.697 --> 01:31:19.602]  Because Zango is made from the whole mango steam fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:31:19.882 --> 01:31:23.825]  Loaded with Xanthos, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[01:31:23.966 --> 01:31:30.992]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and sleep.
[01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:31.852]  So much more.
[01:31:32.073 --> 01:31:38.116]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.
[01:31:38.376 --> 01:31:42.339]  Order your Zango by calling now 800-625-2890 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[01:31:42.359 --> 01:31:43.940]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:44.620]  Call now 800-625-2890.
[01:32:01.531 --> 01:32:08.853]  Alright, Joe, John, many others, we're going to get your calls here in just a few minutes, and then I'm going to run through a bunch of news well into the third hour, and then we'll continue with more calls.
[01:32:08.993 --> 01:32:27.459]  We're going to have Jim Shepard up here for a few minutes, the owner of New Millennium Concepts, our big sponsor, Made in America, Black Berkey Water Filter Systems, because it's so important, the toxins, the poisons that are in the water, the admitted toxins and poisons that cause
[01:32:28.487 --> 01:32:32.591]  Cancer and so many other illnesses and diseases and problems.
[01:32:33.852 --> 01:32:34.593]  It's preventable.
[01:32:34.613 --> 01:32:41.879]  I mean, clean water is one of the foundation founts, pun intended, of civilization.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:51.087]  And you notice, I pitch documentary films, I pitch books and books on tape and materials I've read, I've looked at, I believe in.
[01:32:51.288 --> 01:32:54.070]  That's what we have on the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:55.874 --> 01:32:59.656]  That's what you can call and get a catalog for, or you can call and order the videos.
[01:33:01.957 --> 01:33:04.118]  And, you know, I am not my brother's keeper.
[01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:09.720]  I cannot control what the Patriot community does, what other networks do, even some of the stuff people on this network say and do.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:12.461]  That's a thing about freedom.
[01:33:13.242 --> 01:33:15.563]  There's going to be things you disagree with and things you don't like.
[01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:21.225]  But I've made the decision that I am routinely not going to put up with any garbage anymore.
[01:33:22.216 --> 01:33:30.139]  And if people aren't seeing clearly, or if it's my view they're not seeing clearly, maybe I'm wrong sometimes, I'm going to talk to them about it.
[01:33:30.219 --> 01:33:35.381]  Because life's too short, and I'm going to speak my mind even more in the future, not less.
[01:33:36.602 --> 01:33:41.224]  And I've got to say it, folks, the government lies perpetually.
[01:33:41.264 --> 01:33:43.805]  They suppress real cures and real treatments.
[01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:46.679]  They tell you MSG's good.
[01:33:46.699 --> 01:33:47.800]  They tell you aspartame's good.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:50.002]  They tell you sodium stannous fluoride's good.
[01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:51.464]  They tell you mercury's nutritious.
[01:33:51.744 --> 01:33:52.885]  They actually say that, folks.
[01:33:52.945 --> 01:33:53.646]  It's good for your brain.
[01:33:53.866 --> 01:33:54.487]  Of course it's not.
[01:33:54.507 --> 01:33:55.468]  There's thousands of studies.
[01:33:55.708 --> 01:33:56.869]  Literally thousands on that.
[01:33:57.329 --> 01:33:59.011]  On fluoride, on mercury, on all of it.
[01:34:00.392 --> 01:34:05.097]  Ritalin, Prozac, I mean birth defects, going psychotic, murdering people, suicide.
[01:34:06.498 --> 01:34:07.419]  That's all true.
[01:34:07.499 --> 01:34:08.020]  They're bad.
[01:34:09.068 --> 01:34:18.850]  But just because they're bad, and just because there's a lot of problems with internal medicine and western medicine, doesn't mean that all the alternative stuff's any better.
[01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:21.291]  You understand that?
[01:34:21.351 --> 01:34:26.392]  People who claim they've got an absolute cure for cancer, don't walk, run the other direction.
[01:34:27.413 --> 01:34:32.994]  People who claim that they've got a total detox, well absolutely detox you.
[01:34:34.255 --> 01:34:35.937]  Don't walk, run the other direction.
[01:34:36.477 --> 01:34:44.364]  People who claim they've got a magic pyramid that sends off good vibes, don't run, pray for them, and then sprint away.
[01:34:45.385 --> 01:34:46.506]  I mean, I've just got to say that.
[01:34:47.167 --> 01:34:51.951]  See, what hap- and then the media, see, they get to target and point out just the ridiculousness.
[01:34:52.592 --> 01:35:00.519]  The anti-Semitism, the racism against blacks, the magic pyramids, the magical creams and pills,
[01:35:01.488 --> 01:35:01.868]  All of it.
[01:35:02.309 --> 01:35:06.532]  That's the only thing that's holding us back from being totally mainstream.
[01:35:06.552 --> 01:35:08.853]  By mainstream, I mean we become the mainstream.
[01:35:08.933 --> 01:35:09.734]  We take over.
[01:35:10.074 --> 01:35:11.635]  We restore the Constitution.
[01:35:13.096 --> 01:35:20.442]  Look, just because the redcoats were bad, didn't mean that George Washington and others didn't have to try to control problems in their own ranks.
[01:35:21.142 --> 01:35:26.606]  Stealing of money, corruption, scamming, raping, robbing, all of that.
[01:35:26.626 --> 01:35:27.667]  You know, it's the same thing.
[01:35:28.346 --> 01:35:30.468]  You cannot trust the Patriot Movement.
[01:35:30.488 --> 01:35:31.389]  I'll just tell you up front.
[01:35:31.869 --> 01:35:33.470]  Because it is unpoliced.
[01:35:34.431 --> 01:35:35.732]  You certainly can't trust the government.
[01:35:35.752 --> 01:35:37.874]  They're ten times, a thousand times more dangerous.
[01:35:38.694 --> 01:35:44.279]  But the point is, just because they're bad, doesn't mean everything we do is good.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:57.810]  And you know, on another subject, I get everyday emails, this forum is saying that you are bleep, bleep, bleep, you know, and this, this, that, and it's total theater, but you better respond to it.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:08.803]  Well, I mean, if somebody says that, you know, I am a communist Chinese general, and folks, it's almost that ridiculous, some of the stuff, you know.
[01:36:09.543 --> 01:36:12.424]  Well, this person says they were your employee, and they say this.
[01:36:12.464 --> 01:36:12.744]  Oh, really?
[01:36:12.764 --> 01:36:18.405]  They don't give their name or phone number on this website where they just make all these ridiculous claims, and you want me to respond to that?
[01:36:18.465 --> 01:36:19.305]  And stuff's on the net.
[01:36:19.586 --> 01:36:21.326]  You can never stop responding to it.
[01:36:21.786 --> 01:36:25.107]  Number one, you need to trust but verify, as Ronald Reagan would say.
[01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:31.332]  And, uh, you know, I'll see people, they'll just believe the most outlandish, moronic statement.
[01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:40.235]  Planet X is gonna kill us and suck our blood out, and when it comes by, a million vampires are gonna jump on spaceships and fly across and bite our feet off, you know?
[01:36:40.255 --> 01:36:40.755]  I mean, it just...
[01:36:42.811 --> 01:36:46.913]  Vicious, blood-drinking, Easter Bunny with 14-inch fangs are going to pop out of the ground.
[01:36:47.354 --> 01:36:48.334]  Oh, it's documented!
[01:36:48.554 --> 01:36:54.598]  And then I sit up here and talk about all this real stuff, every day, day in and day out, and I just don't know if Alex is telling the truth.
[01:36:54.858 --> 01:36:55.658]  I just don't know.
[01:36:56.179 --> 01:37:00.321]  Well, I heard that, you know, Alex Jones is a blah, blah, blah.
[01:37:01.862 --> 01:37:10.527]  So, just number one, folks, get more focused on yourself, being informed, being prepared, being involved, and
[01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:14.739]  I don't know, it's just a whole host of issues.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:24.965]  And it's because, frankly folks, I've become more confident, I have become more focused, I have become... and I've got a lot more to learn, a lot more to grow, that never stops.
[01:37:25.386 --> 01:37:27.547]  You know, that I am just not going to put up with it.
[01:37:27.587 --> 01:37:31.869]  Stuff that's bothered me over the past, stuff that's irritating to me, I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:33.731]  And none of us should.
[01:37:33.771 --> 01:37:35.191]  Man, life is too short.
[01:37:35.932 --> 01:37:37.633]  But I don't want it on my hands.
[01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:46.575]  I don't want it on my hands, on my conscience, being any way connected or related to, uh, stuff that'll get people killed.
[01:37:47.676 --> 01:37:57.584]  I mean, you got stuff going on where, oh, you don't need that treatment, oh, don't, don't go get treatment, just come to us, we got a, you know, something that'll really fix you up, and then that person dies?
[01:38:00.586 --> 01:38:02.728]  No, sir.
[01:38:02.748 --> 01:38:04.109]  There isn't even a choice there.
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:05.360]  All right.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:09.522]  Something I do support and believe in 110% is water filtration.
[01:38:10.002 --> 01:38:12.283]  And most of that is a scam.
[01:38:13.183 --> 01:38:17.905]  You know, you go out and pay a hundred bucks for a filter and it doesn't cut out but about half the stuff.
[01:38:19.346 --> 01:38:22.207]  And then reverse osmosis knocks out some of the good minerals you need.
[01:38:22.287 --> 01:38:23.948]  So you better take a mineral supplement if you're doing that.
[01:38:24.208 --> 01:38:25.528]  And I use that for cooking, folks.
[01:38:26.029 --> 01:38:29.770]  But I also have bought, I don't know, probably ten big Berkeys over the years, or more than that.
[01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.751]  Give them as gifts.
[01:38:30.831 --> 01:38:31.711]  I own three or four.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:57.841]  And that's what I drink, and it is delicious, and it's made in America, and it's not going to make you live to be as old as Methuselah, and it's not going to make your hair grow back, and it's not going to make you, you know, be able to leap buildings in a single bound, but man, your body is 70 plus percent water, and most of the poison you drink is in the water.
[01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:02.783]  And that's where you're getting a lot of the toxins.
[01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:03.784]  You're still going to get it in the food.
[01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:05.285]  You know, why do you wash your vegetables?
[01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:12.433]  You should put the citrus spray on them to get that layer off of them, that wax layer that holds that poison.
[01:39:12.994 --> 01:39:13.995]  That is not good for you.
[01:39:15.518 --> 01:39:17.500]  But it's hard to cut all that poison out.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:21.645]  Well, you can at least cut out 70 plus percent of it by filtering your water.
[01:39:22.026 --> 01:39:23.227]  And I believe in this.
[01:39:23.267 --> 01:39:24.148]  This is real.
[01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:25.409]  And again, it's not glamorous.
[01:39:25.450 --> 01:39:26.371]  It's not fancy.
[01:39:26.751 --> 01:39:28.293]  It doesn't have bells and whistles.
[01:39:28.353 --> 01:39:32.778]  It doesn't tell you that it's gonna, you know, make you a god creature with the Kabbalah.
[01:39:33.859 --> 01:39:35.480]  You know, it's not a magic pyramid.
[01:39:35.541 --> 01:39:42.245]  It's just the top-of-the-line, premier gravity filter made in America that supports this broadcast.
[01:39:42.725 --> 01:39:47.188]  And the best discounts you're going to find buying it through this show, tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:49.350]  Jim, you've been holding for five minutes.
[01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:50.170]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:50.591 --> 01:39:52.892]  Jim Shepherd, my good friend, I haven't had you on in about a year.
[01:39:53.553 --> 01:39:58.056]  And we are dragging the owner of New Millennium Concepts, who's been busier than a one-legged man, and you know what?
[01:39:59.072 --> 01:40:01.353]  The last month with these hurricanes.
[01:40:01.373 --> 01:40:02.814]  And what did he do when the hurricanes hit?
[01:40:03.034 --> 01:40:04.035]  He slashed prices.
[01:40:04.075 --> 01:40:04.875]  He didn't increase them.
[01:40:05.115 --> 01:40:06.956]  Like a bunch of profiteering trash out there.
[01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:08.437]  Jim, good to have you on with us.
[01:40:08.637 --> 01:40:10.297]  Always a pleasure to be on your show, Alex.
[01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:12.438]  Sorry you had to hear that rant beforehand.
[01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:13.239]  I just had to say it.
[01:40:13.579 --> 01:40:16.220]  Nah, pretty much I agree with you on that stuff, Alex.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:24.024]  And by the way, I want to tell you, on your new frequency in the PMs, that thing came through like FM radio last night.
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:32.192]  And if you haven't told your folks about the PM frequency, you need to do that because it's a great frequency.
[01:40:32.332 --> 01:40:34.052]  Yeah, we really appreciate the fine folks.
[01:40:34.072 --> 01:40:40.634]  The 100,000 watt Premier WWCR dwarfing the other shortwave stations, bar none.
[01:40:41.214 --> 01:40:48.416]  And we're going to be on 32.10 at night still for another week and a half, but we're simulcasting and then in a week and a half we won't be on 32.10 anymore.
[01:40:48.816 --> 01:40:49.376]  First hour 7.461, 7.461.
[01:40:53.388 --> 01:40:56.471]  And the second and third hours are going to be at 5.765.
[01:40:56.511 --> 01:41:00.054]  5.765, just mega blowtorches.
[01:41:00.475 --> 01:41:02.537]  And I've got to get this posted on InfoWars.
[01:41:05.099 --> 01:41:07.421]  Jim, tell us about New Millennium Concepts.
[01:41:07.481 --> 01:41:09.083]  You've got the British Berkeys, which are excellent.
[01:41:09.103 --> 01:41:12.426]  You also have the American Berkeys that have been tested even better.
[01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:13.007]  Tell us about it.
[01:41:13.507 --> 01:41:16.230]  Well, basically, Alex, what we
[01:41:17.361 --> 01:41:20.985]  What the philosophy of our company is, is that we want to clean up the water.
[01:41:21.025 --> 01:41:22.687]  This is a primary issue.
[01:41:22.827 --> 01:41:24.890]  It's a primary issue every day.
[01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.751]  I don't want your filter.
[01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:26.852]  I want a magic pyramid.
[01:41:27.793 --> 01:41:28.213]  Okay.
[01:41:28.794 --> 01:41:31.537]  Well, I can probably refer you to somebody.
[01:41:32.038 --> 01:41:32.619]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:33.059]  Go ahead.
[01:41:33.239 --> 01:41:33.520]  Okay.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.923]  Anyway, with respect to
[01:41:36.853 --> 01:41:40.515]  With health issues, it's important to clean that water every day.
[01:41:40.695 --> 01:41:42.756]  Water is the universal solvent.
[01:41:43.116 --> 01:41:44.277]  It's the material.
[01:41:44.437 --> 01:41:48.939]  It's the mechanism that God created to clean out the toxins in your body.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:56.303]  And if the water is full of toxins, then your immune system is trying to clean up the water and clean up your body, and things begin to break down.
[01:41:57.104 --> 01:42:04.647]  More importantly, during crises like we saw with the hurricane, during a situation like that, you have a primary need.
[01:42:04.908 --> 01:42:05.508]  It's water.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:14.402]  And if you're surrounded by a bunch of water, and you can't drink it without getting sick, you've got a real problem.
[01:42:14.582 --> 01:42:18.223]  Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink, the albatross.
[01:42:18.583 --> 01:42:22.744]  Yes, and I can tell you from experience that we couldn't get our water filters in there.
[01:42:23.024 --> 01:42:29.425]  Once they locked down that disaster area, you couldn't bring stuff in, you couldn't bring stuff out, so whatever folks had with them,
[01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:31.196]  That was what they had to use.
[01:42:31.216 --> 01:42:36.879]  And the big Berkey, British or American, but the American again has been tested even better, a new standard.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:46.725]  I mean, why didn't the government just bring those in, or bring in other filters, when you can take swamp water, put it right in the Berkey, can't you Jim?
[01:42:47.305 --> 01:42:57.391]  Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did a little bit of math calculations, and 4,000 pounds of Berkeys, 600 of our large systems, they could have delivered
[01:42:58.055 --> 01:43:04.137]  Via helicopter to the hospitals and to the hotels where people were held up.
[01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:12.960]  They could deliver 400 of them around the city and that would have supplied a quarter million people with daily water.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.961]  Instead, the plan was... But that teaches self-sufficiency so we don't do that.
[01:43:17.221 --> 01:43:20.142]  What we do is fly in, bottle water... Bottled water.
[01:43:20.262 --> 01:43:27.124]  And the problem was there was not enough assets available to bring people in to distribute the water and of course
[01:43:27.697 --> 01:43:31.600]  You probably are aware that before you get anything, you have to register.
[01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:43.730]  And they didn't have the personnel to bring that in, and they didn't have the assets to bring in two million pounds of bottled water a day and distribute it throughout the city, so essentially nothing happened.
[01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:50.415]  And we can't drop water onto your roof because FEMA says you must be registered first, so you're just going to die.
[01:43:50.435 --> 01:43:50.735]  Bye-bye!
[01:43:52.569 --> 01:44:06.415]  I mean, you know, Jim, I got a two-year food supply, I got gold, I got guns, I got water filters, and it's not because I think the San Andreas Fault's gonna, you know, break, or the, uh, whatever the fault is, that's out in California, we've got the, uh, Balcones fault line.
[01:44:06.435 --> 01:44:11.578]  It's not because I think that's about to erupt any minute, uh, you know, with the old ancient volcanoes around here.
[01:44:11.998 --> 01:44:18.181]  It's just that, it's what you're supposed to do, our forefathers did it, and now you're some type of space alien, if you do.
[01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:20.542]  Jim, give folks the toll-free number, please.
[01:44:21.182 --> 01:44:22.963]  Okay, you can call 888-803-4438.
[01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:33.289]  Again, that's 888-803-4438.
[01:44:33.529 --> 01:44:39.873]  Or you can order online at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:44:40.313 --> 01:44:44.956]  That's B-E-R-K-E-Y-Water.com.
[01:44:45.516 --> 01:44:49.078]  When you order, be sure and mention that you heard about it on Alex's show.
[01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:58.314]  And, uh, if you do so, then you'll get either a free sport bottle or a free bottle of potassium iodate with the Berkey light system.
[01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:08.119]  If you get the system with lights, uh, then you'll get, uh, two items, two freebies, uh, whether you want two sport bottles, two potassium iodate, or one of each is your choice.
[01:45:08.139 --> 01:45:12.241]  And by the way, you get all this stuff, and it's less than Indian knockoffs at the hardware store.
[01:45:13.462 --> 01:45:16.143]  Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, uh, if you crunch the numbers,
[01:45:16.914 --> 01:45:22.417]  We have the most economical water filtration system available.
[01:45:23.797 --> 01:45:33.402]  Basically, you calculate the cost per gallon by how much filters cost and how much water they will filter before they need replacement.
[01:45:34.302 --> 01:45:38.724]  Most water filtration systems are anywhere between $30 and $1.20 a gallon.
[01:45:40.842 --> 01:45:44.404]  And usually the cheaper systems are the higher cost per gallon.
[01:45:44.444 --> 01:45:47.785]  They have planned obsolescence built in like light bulbs.
[01:45:47.985 --> 01:45:48.425]  That's right.
[01:45:48.525 --> 01:45:53.928]  And when you calculate the cost of our filters, we're literally talking a penny or two a gallon.
[01:45:54.608 --> 01:46:04.973]  And so not only do you get the finest purification available with the Black Berkey purification elements, I mean, we strip out pathogenic bacteria, which most water filtration systems do not do,
[01:46:06.365 --> 01:46:10.228]  Also, we always hear about bottle water companies, Jim.
[01:46:10.689 --> 01:46:14.391]  They don't control their filtration systems properly.
[01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:24.639]  And in the filtration process, it suddenly breaks and dumps all the poison from 100,000 gallons into 50 bottles of water and people start dying.
[01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:32.104]  You can't trust these big factories that take Houston tap water and then just filter it and ship it all over the country.
[01:46:33.254 --> 01:46:43.173]  Well, the University of Cincinnati did a study and they found that 75% of bottled waters have a bacteriological count 10 times or greater than what is found in tap water.
[01:46:44.021 --> 01:46:45.742]  I know, and you can Google that, folks.
[01:46:45.842 --> 01:46:47.543]  I mean, Dan and water killed people.
[01:46:47.843 --> 01:46:51.726]  The Coca-Cola water was found with just mega levels of carcinogen in England.
[01:46:52.166 --> 01:46:53.587]  I don't have time to go over it all.
[01:46:53.987 --> 01:46:59.330]  I know it's not magical, and it's not a super cure or something.
[01:46:59.350 --> 01:47:00.991]  It's just water, and it's real good.
[01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:02.211]  Give them a call.
[01:47:02.231 --> 01:47:06.574]  1-888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[01:47:06.854 --> 01:47:09.335]  Jim, always good having you on with us, and God bless.
[01:47:09.595 --> 01:47:10.836]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:47:10.876 --> 01:47:11.396]  You bet, Jim.
[01:47:11.416 --> 01:47:12.297]  I really appreciate you.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.220]  For five years!
[01:47:15.081 --> 01:47:18.502]  They, you can thank those guys you just heard for the shortwave outreach.
[01:47:19.843 --> 01:47:21.863]  I mean, I will not have fly-by-night sponsors.
[01:47:21.903 --> 01:47:23.764]  I will not have scammers as sponsors.
[01:47:24.784 --> 01:47:27.686]  I mean, I turn down advertisers every single day.
[01:47:28.446 --> 01:47:29.186]  Every day.
[01:47:29.366 --> 01:47:31.447]  I will not touch them with a ten-foot pole.
[01:47:32.507 --> 01:47:33.788]  I will touch them all over.
[01:47:34.108 --> 01:47:35.569]  Can't keep my hands off their burkies.
[01:47:36.289 --> 01:47:37.429]  And it's just, it's real.
[01:47:37.749 --> 01:47:38.010]  Okay?
[01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:38.970]  Only real stuff here.
[01:47:39.656 --> 01:47:44.178]  When we tell you straight down here in Texas, at least we used to until all the carpetbaggers came down here.
[01:47:44.879 --> 01:47:46.820]  Let's go ahead and go calls.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.700]  I appreciate folks holding.
[01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:50.582]  Joe in Wisconsin called in earlier, but I had a guest that came on.
[01:47:50.602 --> 01:47:53.343]  He was making a great point about how the government has bounties.
[01:47:54.224 --> 01:47:57.225]  And up in their state, I haven't seen their numbers, but I know it's similar down here.
[01:47:57.285 --> 01:47:58.626]  We're the big prison state in Texas.
[01:47:58.886 --> 01:48:00.547]  They get around $40,000, $35,000 to $45,000 is the numbers I've seen.
[01:48:00.567 --> 01:48:01.808]  He said $40,000 in Wisconsin when you're a prisoner.
[01:48:06.658 --> 01:48:09.381]  But the government gets about $5,000 in taxes out of you and you're not.
[01:48:09.941 --> 01:48:14.145]  And so they want to go to prisons and everything is shifting to prisons and surveillance and control.
[01:48:14.645 --> 01:48:16.127]  And these private interests then own them.
[01:48:16.667 --> 01:48:18.169]  And the feds will then pay.
[01:48:19.330 --> 01:48:20.691]  They will pay big money.
[01:48:21.071 --> 01:48:26.977]  That's why when the cops come to your house because the neighbors are arguing, nothing's broken, no one hit anybody, still someone goes to jail.
[01:48:27.057 --> 01:48:30.120]  Even if you get off, they get around $10,000 federally for that arrest.
[01:48:33.092 --> 01:48:35.614]  And again, the feds just want to break the family up.
[01:48:35.634 --> 01:48:37.796]  They print the money, so they'll just throw money at it.
[01:48:38.097 --> 01:48:39.098]  Joe, finish up your point.
[01:48:39.678 --> 01:48:43.482]  Okay, it's illegal for Wisconsin to have for-profit prisons.
[01:48:43.602 --> 01:48:47.145]  They tried to change that law, that got overturned, thank God.
[01:48:48.186 --> 01:48:52.470]  What happens is, in your state, it's not illegal to build for-profit prisons.
[01:48:52.630 --> 01:48:54.932]  So we are your number one exporter.
[01:48:55.152 --> 01:48:56.814]  You get a lot of our prisoners.
[01:48:57.475 --> 01:48:58.536]  They've projected
[01:48:59.441 --> 01:49:03.245]  Some number, I think it was 4,070 more inmates.
[01:49:03.325 --> 01:49:05.687]  We have prisoners from foreign countries here.
[01:49:06.227 --> 01:49:07.408]  Yeah, and you get paid for that too.
[01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:15.095]  The number one... Listen, when you drive through the beautiful areas of Texas, all you see is prisons and barbed wire fences.
[01:49:15.956 --> 01:49:18.458]  The number one growth industry is correction.
[01:49:19.344 --> 01:49:22.927]  And I'm glad you had the previous guest on.
[01:49:23.027 --> 01:49:24.788]  They're not just taking our property.
[01:49:24.828 --> 01:49:25.789]  They're taking our persons.
[01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:28.531]  The eminent domain ties into this too.
[01:49:28.551 --> 01:49:32.194]  If you think that they won't take your house, what makes you think they're not going to come for you?
[01:49:33.775 --> 01:49:34.476]  God bless you.
[01:49:34.536 --> 01:49:35.157]  Excellent point.
[01:49:35.797 --> 01:49:36.357]  Absolutely.
[01:49:37.638 --> 01:49:40.621]  But really, we shouldn't talk about eminent domain.
[01:49:40.661 --> 01:49:44.424]  Let's talk about magic products.
[01:49:45.785 --> 01:49:46.846]  And discredit everyone.
[01:49:47.766 --> 01:49:48.367]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:58.353]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.553 --> 01:50:02.996]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.136 --> 01:50:07.479]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.539 --> 01:50:08.900]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.641]  Panama.
[01:50:10.681 --> 01:50:14.904]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.964 --> 01:50:21.890]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:24.112]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.232 --> 01:50:34.760]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:35.981]  If you want to understand

[01:51:11.953 --> 01:51:18.675]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.075 --> 01:51:30.858]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:53:19.509 --> 01:53:21.029]  The seats are literally half open.
[01:53:21.090 --> 01:53:22.070]  It's been on national TV.
[01:53:22.570 --> 01:53:23.591]  Oh, you're not allowed.
[01:53:23.651 --> 01:53:26.553]  No one else is allowed in to speak in Citizens Communication.
[01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:27.733]  It's a fire issue.
[01:53:29.562 --> 01:53:31.163]  But wait a minute, the rooms have opened!
[01:53:31.744 --> 01:53:31.864]  Ah!
[01:53:32.845 --> 01:53:38.289]  Arrest her, put her in jail, give her $10,000 bail and put her in jail for two weeks.
[01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:40.031]  And then counting.
[01:53:40.451 --> 01:53:40.972]  It's freedom.
[01:53:41.712 --> 01:53:43.514]  And we're going to take your property.
[01:53:43.754 --> 01:53:51.640]  And by the way, the electronic voting machines are going in right now with no record, openly run by the government, and soon we'll really be enslaving you.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.182]  You'll have nothing you can do to stop us.
[01:53:53.202 --> 01:53:55.223]  See, we're down to the 11th hour.
[01:53:55.324 --> 01:53:57.025]  We're down to two minutes to midnight right now.
[01:53:58.633 --> 01:54:00.054]  It's time to stop playing games.
[01:54:00.074 --> 01:54:01.414]  It's time to stop mincing words.
[01:54:01.754 --> 01:54:05.476]  It's time to really look in the mirror and have a gut check and realize we're in a whole lot of trouble.
[01:54:06.376 --> 01:54:07.677]  A whole lot of trouble coming down.
[01:54:08.577 --> 01:54:09.638]  John in Texas.
[01:54:09.718 --> 01:54:10.438]  Welcome John.
[01:54:10.458 --> 01:54:11.518]  Thanks for holding patiently.
[01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:13.019]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:54:13.679 --> 01:54:14.059]  Hi.
[01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:15.880]  I'm calling from Galveston County.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:20.602]  I heard Bush's press conference that he had this morning and
[01:54:21.528 --> 01:54:24.811]  It was the usual drivel except for one very important thing.
[01:54:25.031 --> 01:54:28.635]  A female reporter asked him about this phony bird flu, of course.
[01:54:29.476 --> 01:54:41.307]  And what Bush is planning, these are his words now out of his mouth, what he's planning to do is to get the Congress to give him the authority to declare any region in the country which has an outbreak of bird flu
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:47.285]  To be a quarantine zone and to use the military to enforce the quarantine.
[01:54:47.625 --> 01:54:50.067]  Yeah, notice how this bird flu comes right on time.
[01:54:50.408 --> 01:54:52.810]  Congress is saying no to the end deposit commentatus.
[01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:54.631]  That's in the news stack today.
[01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:56.353]  In fact, that was coming up in a few minutes.
[01:54:57.173 --> 01:55:01.777]  We have all this going on, and I wasn't aware of him saying that, though that's the plan.
[01:55:01.818 --> 01:55:09.044]  He signed an executive order about six months ago for the quarantines, and again, they can have just a few cases of this, create panic,
[01:55:09.634 --> 01:55:12.535]  Which a lot of the so-called patriots are out helping and promoting.
[01:55:12.575 --> 01:55:13.656]  It's a total fraud.
[01:55:15.177 --> 01:55:18.078]  And it's just more of the same bull.
[01:55:18.358 --> 01:55:21.800]  And he wants to use also the government blames.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:24.601]  And Paul Harvey also had this on his broadcast today.
[01:55:25.362 --> 01:55:31.867]  To spray for any viruses or any bird flu, and of course they're going to be spraying us with toxic chemicals.
[01:55:31.887 --> 01:55:32.728]  No, no, I heard that.
[01:55:32.848 --> 01:55:35.230]  See, now the spraying is going to be public.
[01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:35.890]  Yeah.
[01:55:36.150 --> 01:55:39.093]  Olden Jets are spraying you, but it's for your safety.
[01:55:39.113 --> 01:55:43.216]  They're using a lot of E-130s, which of course can carry a huge amount of this liquid.
[01:55:43.723 --> 01:55:49.825]  And they're going to be hosing us down with God only knows what type of toxic chemicals... And I'm sure it'll be an everyday thing from now on.
[01:55:49.865 --> 01:55:50.585]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:55:50.865 --> 01:55:51.286]  You bet!
[01:55:51.526 --> 01:55:54.607]  And what they're doing... It's all magically happening at once, yes.
[01:55:54.887 --> 01:56:04.510]  And what they're doing... You see, Alex, I had a talk show up in Gillette, Wyoming back in 2003, just before as well as shortly after the war in Iraq broke out.
[01:56:05.271 --> 01:56:10.775]  I was fired from my talk show because I refused to worship at the altar of the Republican Party.
[01:56:11.175 --> 01:56:13.937]  Well, the Republicans should love this new lady!
[01:56:13.977 --> 01:56:16.079]  She makes Hillary Clinton look conservative!
[01:56:16.099 --> 01:56:16.459]  You bet!
[01:56:16.479 --> 01:56:17.259]  Supreme Court!
[01:56:17.399 --> 01:56:27.546]  The whole point is, there are people out there who are so stupid, I tell them, look, if you want my advice, if you want to worship, find a good Christian church and worship at its altar.
[01:56:27.587 --> 01:56:31.069]  But never, ever worship at the altar of any political party.
[01:56:31.502 --> 01:56:37.704]  Because they're both owned by the Rockefellers and the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and all these secret societies.
[01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:41.026]  And one of your dumbed-down neighbors says those groups don't exist, right?
[01:56:41.206 --> 01:56:42.726]  Well, I'm an ex-Mason.
[01:56:42.806 --> 01:56:46.308]  I was the one who called you on George's program when you were a guest on his program.
[01:56:47.188 --> 01:56:48.909]  And it's his telephone screener.
[01:56:48.949 --> 01:56:52.550]  Now, George is a wonderful guy, as you know, but his screener, of course, is a ringer.
[01:56:53.290 --> 01:56:54.791]  And when I try to call in,
[01:56:55.347 --> 01:57:02.016]  And he said, oh yeah, and he put me on terminal hold, and well over an hour later... You want to tell us about the Mason stuff?
[01:57:02.056 --> 01:57:02.998]  How high up did you get?
[01:57:03.418 --> 01:57:12.090]  Well, he put four other calls ahead of me on the wild card line, and I know the wild card line is only one line, it doesn't have four different lines on it.
[01:57:12.885 --> 01:57:16.707]  And this guy puts other calls ahead of you, and he just leaves you out there to dry.
[01:57:16.727 --> 01:57:20.970]  He just leaves you out there to die, because he doesn't want your information to get to George.
[01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:23.332]  Well, sir, I mean, we can repeat that every time.
[01:57:23.392 --> 01:57:24.132]  You're on the air!
[01:57:24.172 --> 01:57:25.793]  Your information could get out right now!
[01:57:25.813 --> 01:57:28.495]  I'm gonna give you about a minute on the other side, sir.
[01:57:29.095 --> 01:57:30.436]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:30.456 --> 01:57:30.876]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.978 --> 01:57:37.881]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.201 --> 01:57:39.001]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.956 --> 01:57:50.596]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.257 --> 01:57:52.337]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.038 --> 01:57:54.138]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.778 --> 01:57:55.619]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.359 --> 01:57:57.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:01.562]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.102 --> 01:58:06.244]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.424 --> 01:58:08.905]  Alright, gotta move quick into this third hour.
[01:58:09.426 --> 01:58:12.227]  We're gonna take four or five more calls, then I'm gonna jump into the news.
[01:58:12.747 --> 01:58:15.949]  I was aware that Bush signed an executive order for total martial law,
[01:58:16.804 --> 01:58:18.685]  If there's any bird flu or any SARS.
[01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:21.507]  And again, SARS was never even proven to exist.
[01:58:22.007 --> 01:58:24.729]  They just point at somebody who dies of the flu, which is happening every day.
[01:58:24.789 --> 01:58:26.670]  And, oh my gosh, it's incredible.
[01:58:26.710 --> 01:58:27.550]  Give up all your rights.
[01:58:28.011 --> 01:58:29.451]  And then, oh, now there's the bird flu.
[01:58:29.491 --> 01:58:31.252]  Why, it's probably killed 30 people.
[01:58:31.332 --> 01:58:31.893]  My gosh.
[01:58:32.193 --> 01:58:33.954]  It's the most deadly thing to ever hit the planet.
[01:58:33.974 --> 01:58:34.814]  We're all dead.
[01:58:34.834 --> 01:58:37.036]  Total hype.
[01:58:37.656 --> 01:58:39.637]  It's all CDC baloney.
[01:58:39.657 --> 01:58:42.599]  You know, we've got to send you to the gas chambers to delouse you.
[01:58:43.306 --> 01:58:46.990]  I mean, you know, it's not true.
[01:58:50.232 --> 01:58:54.316]  And there's so many well-meaning people sucked into it and people profiteering off of it.
[01:58:55.177 --> 01:58:56.518]  And you know what?
[01:58:56.538 --> 01:59:00.962]  If you don't like me saying it's all hyped up, just don't even try it, okay?
[01:59:04.102 --> 01:59:09.745]  You understand that your bank accounts and all that are going to mean nothing if they do pull this and people buy into it?
[01:59:09.765 --> 01:59:11.106]  Let me tell you how it'll work if they do it.
[01:59:11.586 --> 01:59:12.927]  There's quarantine in Dallas, Texas.
[01:59:12.947 --> 01:59:14.648]  There's quarantine in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[01:59:14.868 --> 01:59:16.989]  There's quarantine going on in New York City right now.
[01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:18.810]  They're clamping down the borders of these states.
[01:59:19.050 --> 01:59:20.751]  These troops have been called out.
[01:59:21.151 --> 01:59:24.453]  And then three months later, well, the Marshall Law really stopped it from happening.
[01:59:24.493 --> 01:59:26.674]  And yes, they are spraying to deal with it.
[01:59:26.734 --> 01:59:28.155]  And thank goodness it happened.
[01:59:30.236 --> 01:59:30.856]  You know what?
[01:59:30.956 --> 01:59:31.817]  I mean, it's just...
[01:59:33.158 --> 01:59:34.239]  It's time to stop it.
[01:59:34.299 --> 01:59:36.301]  And I'm not saying the flu isn't dangerous.
[01:59:36.321 --> 01:59:38.282]  I'm not saying bird flu isn't bad for you.
[01:59:38.602 --> 01:59:39.783]  Smallpox can kill you.
[01:59:40.164 --> 01:59:42.525]  The globalists are the ones that are going to release this.
[01:59:43.867 --> 01:59:45.728]  And I'm not saying we shouldn't be prepared for it.
[01:59:45.748 --> 01:59:48.270]  But giving up all our rights does nothing.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:51.001]  Yeah, I didn't see Bush's press conference.
[01:59:51.061 --> 01:59:57.647]  I know, but before I started the show, I heard on the radio, George Bush will be defending his new nominee for the Supreme Court.
[01:59:58.027 --> 01:59:59.849]  She's so wonderful and coming up.
[02:00:00.429 --> 02:00:04.973]  So I guess during that period he did say that, but that's just a repeat of what the policy is.
[02:00:05.714 --> 02:00:10.538]  But finish up quickly, John, the information you were unable to get through on a phone call to a talk show.
[02:00:10.578 --> 02:00:11.279]  Go ahead and do it now!
[02:00:11.579 --> 02:00:12.881]  Yeah, Alex, a couple of things.
[02:00:12.961 --> 02:00:15.483]  First of all, on Bush's nomination to the Supreme Court,
[02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:21.741]  It was brought out on the news yesterday that she had previously contributed to Al Gore's campaign some big bucks.
[02:00:22.441 --> 02:00:25.622]  No, no, no, she's... of course they're all in business together!
[02:00:25.842 --> 02:00:45.209]  Also, to those who believe in government vaccines, think back to when Gerald Ford was president, and they had one suspected case, but never confirmed, of swine flu at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and they killed dozens of people and maimed dozens of others, left people left brain-dead for the rest of their life by taking that swine flu vaccine
[02:00:45.822 --> 02:00:50.223]  For one suspected but never confirmed case of swine flu.
[02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.523]  Well, it's like this new movie, Serenity.
[02:00:52.543 --> 02:00:54.904]  It's a pretty good science fiction movie.
[02:00:55.504 --> 02:01:04.066]  I mean, it's got a lot of good moral stories, and at the end, they figure, I don't want to give people... The government's trying to turn us into slaves, basically, and they're doing it through cover stories.
[02:01:04.406 --> 02:01:07.006]  And they use these films just to throw it in our face.
[02:01:07.666 --> 02:01:09.887]  But that's exactly what they're doing, brother.
[02:01:10.127 --> 02:01:10.647]  I mean, listen.
[02:01:11.027 --> 02:01:12.567]  A precedent for these murderers.
[02:01:13.048 --> 02:01:14.888]  Our government paid Israel
[02:01:16.349 --> 02:01:24.465]  Over 3 billion dollars to kill 100,000 Jewish children and their government took it and murdered those children with radiation experiments.
[02:01:24.546 --> 02:01:25.067]  I mean, folks...
[02:01:25.672 --> 02:01:28.573]  The vast majority died within one week of the radiation.
[02:01:28.793 --> 02:01:30.534]  Healthy little five-year-olds, man.
[02:01:30.554 --> 02:01:34.315]  Can you imagine leading little elementary kids in and just zapping them?
[02:01:34.615 --> 02:01:38.376]  And they told the parents, oh, you're going to the dentist, you're going for a checkup.
[02:01:38.616 --> 02:01:39.937]  The government pays for it.
[02:01:40.357 --> 02:01:42.778]  These are murdering, psychopathic killers.
[02:01:42.818 --> 02:01:44.558]  Do not take anything they give you.
[02:01:44.958 --> 02:01:49.820]  Especially their vaccines, because anything the government gives you, there is a hook to it.
[02:01:50.256 --> 02:01:57.509]  The woman at the VA clinic when I went yesterday said, oh you haven't had your flu shot or your pneumonia shot and I said yes and I'm not going to.
[02:01:57.529 --> 02:02:03.319]  And by the way they've done major study indexes all of these Alzheimer patients.
[02:02:04.111 --> 02:02:10.636]  All of them have been big vaccine recipients, and they've also, most of them have, the instances even go up higher.
[02:02:10.676 --> 02:02:16.841]  I read the study on Arrow, and I'm in front of me, that when you take the flu shot multiple years, it just skyrockets.
[02:02:16.901 --> 02:02:18.102]  Well, of course, mercury!
[02:02:18.462 --> 02:02:23.986]  Mercury poison destroys memory and causes necrosis in the brain, rots holes in it!
[02:02:25.808 --> 02:02:26.188]  Anything else?
[02:02:26.670 --> 02:02:29.033]  Well, and these poisons have a cumulative effect.
[02:02:29.053 --> 02:02:30.255]  They don't flush out of your system.
[02:02:30.315 --> 02:02:31.316]  No, mercury's good.
[02:02:31.336 --> 02:02:32.397]  I heard it on TV.
[02:02:32.518 --> 02:02:33.759]  I love the government.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:35.241]  Just shut up.
[02:02:35.401 --> 02:02:37.784]  I'm gonna drink a gallon of it.
[02:02:37.825 --> 02:02:39.527]  The government loves me.
[02:02:39.827 --> 02:02:41.529]  Just shut up, John.
[02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:42.330]  Shut up.
[02:02:46.727 --> 02:02:49.589]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.849 --> 02:02:51.431]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.771 --> 02:02:56.434]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.775 --> 02:03:03.500]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.822]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.022 --> 02:03:08.884]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.

[02:05:45.285 --> 02:05:50.329]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:53.010]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:56.253]  You know, I just thought of this on air.
[02:05:56.273 --> 02:05:59.115]  I should have brought it up to the folks right on the show during the break.
[02:05:59.975 --> 02:06:02.557]  I just mentioned that the government says mercury's nutritious.
[02:06:03.758 --> 02:06:05.619]  Can you find the mercury nutritious clip?
[02:06:05.739 --> 02:06:06.660]  The mercury's good for you?
[02:06:08.104 --> 02:06:09.604]  I know that's spur of the moment.
[02:06:10.184 --> 02:06:17.606]  Now again, about a year ago, right before school started, every year they go, it's the law, you've got to take vaccines, you'll be arrested if you don't!
[02:06:17.986 --> 02:06:21.266]  You've all seen it on local TV, wrote in local paper, it's a script.
[02:06:21.466 --> 02:06:23.267]  There is no law, they just say it's a law.
[02:06:23.567 --> 02:06:24.147]  They're liars.
[02:06:24.707 --> 02:06:30.288]  We had to get a law passed two years ago in the legislature, that there is no law that you have to have a vaccine.
[02:06:30.908 --> 02:06:37.149]  Because they were enforcing, police were arresting, under CPS control and others, and people are winning lawsuits.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.441]  They come arrest you.
[02:06:39.461 --> 02:06:39.981]  There's no law.
[02:06:40.021 --> 02:06:40.681]  They just come do it.
[02:06:41.201 --> 02:06:44.963]  So we had to get a law passed saying it's against the law for them to do something when there's no law.
[02:06:45.523 --> 02:06:46.603]  And Rick Perry did sign it.
[02:06:47.304 --> 02:06:49.264]  Boy, I tell you, that Statesman article sure read weird.
[02:06:50.045 --> 02:06:53.066]  There is now a law, but you cannot say that there is a law, that there is a law.
[02:06:54.787 --> 02:06:57.628]  It's a tongue twister, but that's the craziness of this.
[02:06:57.668 --> 02:06:58.728]  I talked about it last hour.
[02:07:00.209 --> 02:07:02.289]  I heard Gary Brownfield talk about it, and I wasn't aware of it.
[02:07:02.309 --> 02:07:03.410]  I went and looked it up last night.
[02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:04.110]  I heard him yesterday.
[02:07:05.011 --> 02:07:06.111]  And it is true.
[02:07:07.662 --> 02:07:13.346]  The Endangered Species Act ran out about, what, twelve years ago.
[02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:25.495]  There's no law, but they say it's a law, and they arrest, and there are people in prison for, what is it, five, ten years in some cases, because they were caught with an eagle feather.
[02:07:28.257 --> 02:07:32.260]  There's no law, but you're going to prison!
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.762]  It's like what they just did with
[02:07:36.542 --> 02:07:42.823]  What Ronnie Earl, the Austin District Attorney, just did right here in Central Texas with the delay situation.
[02:07:43.223 --> 02:07:50.624]  Those fools indicted him on a law that didn't exist at the time that delay did it.
[02:07:52.285 --> 02:07:58.166]  And I remember reading their evidence against him and looking at the evidence and looking at the documents that the Smoking Gun posted.
[02:07:58.206 --> 02:08:03.127]  I mean, they have the indictment and the exhibits and it's clear money laundering.
[02:08:03.947 --> 02:08:05.887]  But government is so inept
[02:08:07.535 --> 02:08:13.639]  Government is so inept that the idiots charged him with the wrong thing and now their case is gone.
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:15.881]  Their case is gone.
[02:08:17.121 --> 02:08:25.967]  I mean, I remember reading, I mean, I sat there and I read the indictment, and I read the exhibits, and man, caught on, you know, just red-handed money laundering.
[02:08:25.987 --> 02:08:32.712]  And I said, not that I'm some expert on this, I mean, I know money laundering when I see it, which by the way is life in prison, and, uh,
[02:08:34.148 --> 02:08:37.170]  With the broad definition they use, I don't think DeLay should spend life in prison.
[02:08:37.190 --> 02:08:38.331]  He should get in trouble, though.
[02:08:39.332 --> 02:08:40.253]  The law is the law.
[02:08:40.293 --> 02:08:46.177]  You know, these jerks want to run around and, you know, they put all these laws on us and they don't have to follow them.
[02:08:47.157 --> 02:08:48.398]  It's all selective enforcement.
[02:08:48.418 --> 02:08:55.003]  But the point is that they charged him for something that at the time wasn't even illegal.
[02:08:56.704 --> 02:08:59.126]  All I can tell you is how many cases I've seen where
[02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:27.862]  retroactively they pass a law and go after somebody and clearly jurisprudence and the codified law and the common law and the precedent says you shouldn't do that they still do it because the cops are dumb as dirt the public are dumb as dirt the judges dumb as dirt and corrupt I mean most of them are corrupt and know what they're doing is bad but they're just lazy and they just don't care and just take him away put him in prison that's why I think Bush is
[02:09:29.082 --> 02:09:31.384]  Nephew, Jeb's son, he shouldn't have gotten in trouble.
[02:09:31.424 --> 02:09:33.425]  I mean, it shouldn't be illegal to be drunk in a bar.
[02:09:33.706 --> 02:09:34.206]  Peacefully.
[02:09:35.847 --> 02:09:37.088]  But again, that's the police state.
[02:09:37.388 --> 02:09:39.650]  And it even ensnares their own little brood.
[02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:43.093]  Even though I don't like Bush or his kids or the pack of criminals they are.
[02:09:43.113 --> 02:09:45.775]  It's the same thing with Limbaugh.
[02:09:45.815 --> 02:09:51.399]  I don't think Limbaugh should go to prison for gobbling 100 heroin pills a day.
[02:09:51.419 --> 02:09:52.480]  Synthetic heroin, folks.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:52.980]  Oxycontin.
[02:09:54.292 --> 02:09:59.515]  But I sure think he's a hypocrite for saying, put your kid in prison if they're caught with cocaine one time.
[02:10:00.236 --> 02:10:02.297]  What, mandatory sentencing five to ten years?
[02:10:03.638 --> 02:10:05.279]  How many times did I hear him defend that?
[02:10:05.599 --> 02:10:07.380]  He won't do it now though, he just won't bring it up.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:14.844]  You know, I don't use any of it other than, what's the only thing I still use?
[02:10:14.904 --> 02:10:15.465]  Caffeine.
[02:10:16.285 --> 02:10:19.467]  An occasional brisky, which I shouldn't even do that.
[02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:24.394]  Total teetotaler now, even on cigars, folks.
[02:10:24.714 --> 02:10:25.995]  No nicotine.
[02:10:26.515 --> 02:10:31.799]  It's all bad, but the point is, is that I don't use drugs.
[02:10:31.939 --> 02:10:33.500]  I don't use prescription drugs.
[02:10:33.881 --> 02:10:37.743]  Except maybe an occasional non-prescription allergy pill or nasal spray.
[02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:44.408]  But the point is, is that most people who are using a bunch of drugs, they're destructive, they're bad, illegal, legal.
[02:10:44.929 --> 02:10:46.230]  You know, they're against the drug war.
[02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:49.712]  Well, no, I'm against the drug war because I know it causes more drug use.
[02:10:50.353 --> 02:10:50.773]  I know it
[02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:53.391]  What the facts show, in triplicate!
[02:10:53.411 --> 02:10:57.353]  You know, I said I'd go to calls and I'm not ranting.
[02:10:58.453 --> 02:11:04.056]  It's just that they're all over the place, the government's doing things that there's not even a law!
[02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:13.200]  It's just... They walk in and say it's a law, and a grand jury indicts, and then they go grab somebody and they get them, and now delay is probably going to get off.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:20.984]  And folks, I believe in criminals going free if it's going to damage the system that criminals not go free.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.221]  I mean the constitutional system.
[02:11:24.781 --> 02:11:25.481]  You understand that?
[02:11:26.242 --> 02:11:32.465]  It is better to let a few criminals go free than to have the government violate all our rights and not have due process.
[02:11:32.665 --> 02:11:33.905]  And the Founding Fathers said that.
[02:11:34.145 --> 02:11:35.006]  Common Sense shows that.
[02:11:35.206 --> 02:11:44.810]  Are you more worried about a centralized group of criminals in black masks with armored vehicles and attack helicopters and giant prison grids and microwave cannons and sound weapons?
[02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:46.211]  Or are you worried about
[02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:48.800]  Some thug who wants to break in your house.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:56.622]  Because by the way, it's that government can't protect you, that big government, and it says it's job isn't to protect you, and by the way, it wants your gun.
[02:11:57.442 --> 02:12:05.065]  So you better be worried about the smart criminals that get into government, not the stupid crackheads stumbling around trying to bust in your back door.
[02:12:05.465 --> 02:12:09.626]  Because if you were a free human being and knew how to use a firearm, you'd just light them up.
[02:12:10.066 --> 02:12:15.668]  And if you lived in a city or a county or a state where people, most people got guns, they don't do a lot of that home invasion when you're home.
[02:12:16.491 --> 02:12:18.933]  Compared to New York or some place where they got total gun control.
[02:12:19.073 --> 02:12:22.355]  Because they know, you come in a Texans house, you're gonna be dead!
[02:12:22.855 --> 02:12:24.516]  I'm gonna empty the shotgun on you!
[02:12:25.957 --> 02:12:27.779]  With just absolute prejudice.
[02:12:27.819 --> 02:12:33.302]  You are dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!
[02:12:33.883 --> 02:12:35.304]  And that brings life!
[02:12:35.904 --> 02:12:43.449]  The fact that I will defend my life, I will defend my family's life, and I don't want the criminal, degenerate, scumbucket government doing that!
[02:12:45.643 --> 02:12:47.948]  I want the scum buckets out of my life!
[02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:50.813]  I'm not a scum bucket!
[02:12:51.614 --> 02:12:53.237]  It's called compartmentalization.
[02:12:53.257 --> 02:12:55.602]  You're part of a scum bucket system.
[02:12:56.852 --> 02:12:59.495]  We have all this wealth because we didn't have a government to speak of.
[02:12:59.916 --> 02:13:05.583]  And now the government sits on top of this wealth that they're eating through at 100 miles an hour going, We caused all this!
[02:13:05.823 --> 02:13:07.085]  Big government did this!
[02:13:07.305 --> 02:13:08.646]  Social planning did this!
[02:13:08.967 --> 02:13:09.848]  No it didn't!
[02:13:09.888 --> 02:13:10.889]  You're a disease!
[02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:14.614]  You're like a big fat cancer eating through a body going, Man, I'm really growing!
[02:13:14.654 --> 02:13:15.575]  Man, I'm really big!
[02:13:15.635 --> 02:13:16.276]  I'm really good!
[02:13:18.462 --> 02:13:26.813]  Here it is, Mercury's Nutritious, and all, this is a local CBS news, but all over the country, and all those new government studies show Mercury actually helps children's brains.
[02:13:27.533 --> 02:13:28.495]  But notice the twist.
[02:13:28.575 --> 02:13:29.716]  Helps their behavior.
[02:13:29.776 --> 02:13:31.438]  Yes, they want to lobotomize you.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.242]  Just like Serenity.
[02:13:34.963 --> 02:13:35.884]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:13:37.432 --> 02:13:39.875]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:13:40.115 --> 02:13:43.438]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:13:43.738 --> 02:13:45.781]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:13:45.861 --> 02:13:48.523]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:13:48.543 --> 02:13:52.007]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[02:13:54.608 --> 02:14:00.571]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:14:01.051 --> 02:14:07.514]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:14:07.954 --> 02:14:14.897]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:14:14.917 --> 02:14:19.079]  About a month ago, I was listening to a local station, Kelby Jay News.
[02:14:19.099 --> 02:14:21.480]  They got some good guys over there.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:22.741]  Some of the locals, but man.
[02:14:24.122 --> 02:14:25.903]  Do you remember what you did this morning?
[02:14:25.923 --> 02:14:28.004]  Do you remember what you did this evening?
[02:14:28.044 --> 02:14:29.284]  Remember what I just first said?
[02:14:49.986 --> 02:14:51.930]  Then you may have mercury poisoning.
[02:14:52.251 --> 02:14:54.054]  Or you may have just not paying attention to the point.
[02:14:54.976 --> 02:14:56.318]  You better call right now.
[02:14:56.659 --> 02:14:57.681]  It's on the rise.
[02:14:58.022 --> 02:14:59.144]  It's a big problem.
[02:14:59.404 --> 02:15:00.507]  We'll take care of you.
[02:15:02.492 --> 02:15:04.993]  But no mention of, watch out the fish you're eating.
[02:15:05.353 --> 02:15:06.454]  Watch out what you're doing.
[02:15:06.914 --> 02:15:08.695]  Mercury really brain damages you.
[02:15:09.135 --> 02:15:10.055]  It's really bad.
[02:15:10.575 --> 02:15:13.537]  But they don't tell you it's in the vaccine, so take your vaccines next day.
[02:15:13.797 --> 02:15:15.618]  Mercury's deadly, it's ruining everyone else.
[02:15:16.038 --> 02:15:17.518]  But meanwhile, Mercury's nutritious.
[02:15:17.558 --> 02:15:20.500]  I mean, it's just, it's so ridiculous now.
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:22.240]  On it's face.
[02:15:23.641 --> 02:15:27.963]  Um... Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:15:30.003 --> 02:15:32.864]  Daniel in Indiana, then Zeke, Art, Melissa, and others.
[02:15:32.904 --> 02:15:33.604]  Go ahead, Daniel.
[02:15:34.164 --> 02:15:35.084]  Alex, it's a privilege.
[02:15:35.384 --> 02:15:36.724]  No, it's a privilege to talk to you!
[02:15:36.744 --> 02:15:37.765]  Well, thank you.
[02:15:37.785 --> 02:15:39.585]  Your show has got me so worked up today.
[02:15:40.305 --> 02:15:41.265]  My blood pressure's up.
[02:15:41.305 --> 02:15:45.646]  I mixed up a little cocktail here with some aspartame and mercury, and I'm kind of mellowing out now.
[02:15:45.886 --> 02:15:46.287]  Good!
[02:15:47.427 --> 02:15:50.487]  Anyways, uh... You didn't drink your lead and your mercury.
[02:15:50.527 --> 02:15:51.668]  Oh, that's absolutely right.
[02:15:51.828 --> 02:15:53.028]  Everybody knows it's nutritious.
[02:15:54.341 --> 02:16:06.528]  Uh, I googled a few sites a few weeks ago to find some negative information on Alex Jones, and I came across the Christian site who said we should discount Alex Jones because he was seen in a video having a beer and smoking a cigarette once.
[02:16:07.989 --> 02:16:11.231]  Yeah, like some six or seven year old video, and I'm like, drinking a beer.
[02:16:11.311 --> 02:16:13.932]  I said, how many times have I said I've drunk beer before?
[02:16:14.313 --> 02:16:14.893]  Wow!
[02:16:15.493 --> 02:16:17.234]  I've drunk beer, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:16:17.334 --> 02:16:18.415]  I'm the Antichrist!
[02:16:19.341 --> 02:16:21.543]  A little news flash for you down there.
[02:16:21.623 --> 02:16:35.396]  I know the thing in New Orleans is kind of coming to an end, but after it happened, you'll be happy to know, Applied Digital Solutions had a mobile chipping van down there, chipping corpses and body parts for future identification.
[02:16:35.796 --> 02:16:36.497]  I saw that.
[02:16:36.637 --> 02:16:38.178]  Ghoulish creatures, aren't they?
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:40.801]  Yeah, so, happy to know.
[02:16:41.471 --> 02:16:49.534]  I got a Newsmax item about the Real ID Act, and they suggest investing in the company that's building the machines that will take the fingerprints.
[02:16:49.934 --> 02:16:52.295]  Isn't that, oh, that's so conservative of Newsmax.
[02:16:52.656 --> 02:16:52.996]  Yeah.
[02:16:53.756 --> 02:16:54.696]  Make a little money off it.
[02:16:55.677 --> 02:16:58.818]  Hey, Sean Hannity said every child needs a chip, and then he's buying stock.
[02:16:59.618 --> 02:17:00.839]  Sure, well, he's a great American.
[02:17:00.859 --> 02:17:03.740]  When everybody calls him, it's like, Sean, you're a great American.
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:08.562]  Oh, Sean Hannity, I like it when Sean's on!
[02:17:10.066 --> 02:17:11.127]  I love him!
[02:17:11.707 --> 02:17:12.208]  Realistic.
[02:17:12.288 --> 02:17:14.450]  I remember years ago there was a preacher out of California.
[02:17:14.490 --> 02:17:18.773]  He's deceased, but they still play a lot of his programs because he had a lot of wisdom.
[02:17:19.434 --> 02:17:22.936]  He said when you're a preacher and the world loves you, beware.
[02:17:23.337 --> 02:17:27.680]  When you're putting the truth out and they reject you, you could be the salt of the earth.
[02:17:28.661 --> 02:17:29.281]  Absolutely.
[02:17:29.321 --> 02:17:31.123]  What's a variation of what Christ said?
[02:17:32.331 --> 02:17:34.434]  Because they persecute me and they're going to persecute you.
[02:17:34.934 --> 02:17:37.417]  Look folks, Sean Hannity really twists.
[02:17:37.577 --> 02:17:39.519]  You know, I'll explain it briefly when we get back.
[02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:41.481]  One little example.
[02:17:42.262 --> 02:17:43.703]  One poquito of it.
[02:17:46.502 --> 02:17:51.164]  Folks, a massive fraud has been deceiving many millions of good people for decades.
[02:17:51.644 --> 02:17:57.767]  The lie we have been sold by the so-called health food industry is that taking vitamins will make us healthy.
[02:17:58.147 --> 02:18:04.030]  They tell us our dietary habits are so poor we can't possibly get adequate nutrition from mere food.
[02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:09.372]  And though it's true we may not always eat right, God did not create a vitamin tree.
[02:18:09.812 --> 02:18:13.774]  Consuming isolated or synthetic nutrients will never give you total health.
[02:18:14.254 --> 02:18:15.195]  And in some cases,
[02:18:15.575 --> 02:18:17.376]  Can actually do your body harm.
[02:18:17.957 --> 02:18:20.339]  The natural state of your body is total health.
[02:18:20.819 --> 02:18:21.900]  It's your birthright.
[02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.861]  Don't waste your money on vitamins.
[02:18:24.201 --> 02:18:26.783]  Claim your health the natural way God intended.

[02:18:45.988 --> 02:18:49.270]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:53.473]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:53.753 --> 02:18:56.534]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:56.715 --> 02:18:59.116]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:59.316 --> 02:19:07.961]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:08.162 --> 02:19:09.502]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:19:09.682 --> 02:19:13.865]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:14.185 --> 02:19:14.705]  We're good to go!
[02:19:42.975 --> 02:19:44.637]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:46.759 --> 02:19:49.121]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.

[02:19:52.839 --> 02:19:56.482]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[02:21:45.857 --> 02:21:48.079]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:48.099 --> 02:21:51.501]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:51.822 --> 02:21:57.426]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:21:58.967 --> 02:22:02.410]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:03.631]  Real funny, Lord Bush.
[02:22:04.918 --> 02:22:08.439]  Look, I'm not making it my business to sit here and bash Sean Hannity and others.
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:13.421]  But, uh, you need to know the tactics.
[02:22:13.821 --> 02:22:17.622]  And one day I was driving home, listening to Sean Hannity after the show.
[02:22:17.642 --> 02:22:20.463]  Because I monitor enemy transmissions.
[02:22:21.704 --> 02:22:30.387]  And he was going on for about five minutes, these borders are wide open, this is destroying our sovereignty, we gotta do something that is horrible, we gotta... And I just knew, I just knew, and I hadn't listened to him in months.
[02:22:31.207 --> 02:22:33.768]  I just said, he's gonna say we gotta do Bush's amnesty plan.
[02:22:34.594 --> 02:22:36.495]  We've got to legalize him.
[02:22:36.955 --> 02:22:39.497]  And man, sure enough, right then he just goes into it.
[02:22:40.978 --> 02:22:43.599]  And it's not that I'm like, ooh, I can guess what he's going to say next.
[02:22:43.719 --> 02:22:44.740]  I know the script!
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.481]  They'll tell you the problem.
[02:22:47.642 --> 02:22:49.283]  Savage, Hannity, Limbaugh.
[02:22:50.203 --> 02:22:51.224]  A lot of what they say is true.
[02:22:51.244 --> 02:22:52.765]  A lot of the problems they talk about are true.
[02:22:53.025 --> 02:22:56.507]  Conservatives hear that and go, oh, well, they're really doing something.
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:22:59.041]  I mean, I heard him.
[02:22:59.101 --> 02:23:03.724]  I sat there in the car, because I'd gotten home, and I could have got out of the car, but I sat there for like 20 more minutes listening.
[02:23:04.065 --> 02:23:05.946]  I'm down here in Texas right now.
[02:23:06.266 --> 02:23:12.011]  We're down here to cover this border problem and fight it and do something about it and sign some books while we're at it.
[02:23:12.051 --> 02:23:16.214]  But we're down here right now, and let's bring on some congressmen.
[02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:17.255]  What do we do, congressmen?
[02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:18.796]  To repeat what Hannity just said.
[02:23:19.805 --> 02:23:26.611]  Uh, well, you know, we do have a problem, and that's why we've got, the President's got a plan to give them, make this a temporary worker program.
[02:23:26.671 --> 02:23:37.560]  And then you look at that bill, total legalization of anybody who's here, the 30 plus million, and then for six years, anybody who can get here is instantly legalized.
[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:40.762]  It's a six year sunset, you know about those, they never end.
[02:23:41.903 --> 02:23:42.123]  And then,
[02:23:43.631 --> 02:23:50.677]  Any company that wants to bring in skilled or unskilled can fly them, bus them, train them, ship them in.
[02:23:51.398 --> 02:24:00.025]  Unlimited, total, complete, absolute, capitulation, end of all sovereignty!
[02:24:02.532 --> 02:24:02.892]  Boy!
[02:24:03.473 --> 02:24:05.014]  Oh, thanks, Sean!
[02:24:05.254 --> 02:24:08.996]  You're doing so much, Sean, to deal with your legal alien problem.
[02:24:09.076 --> 02:24:09.596]  Thank you.
[02:24:10.197 --> 02:24:11.197]  Oh, no, you're the best.
[02:24:11.397 --> 02:24:12.598]  That's what I'm here for.
[02:24:12.878 --> 02:24:14.599]  I'm here to feed you cyanide.
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:17.221]  Political cyanide, my little idiots.
[02:24:19.562 --> 02:24:20.723]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:24:21.663 --> 02:24:22.544]  It's like that.
[02:24:22.564 --> 02:24:29.928]  I mean, when you know the facts... I mean, I tuned in one day, and, like, in three hours, I was driving back from Galveston.
[02:24:29.948 --> 02:24:30.849]  I went down and spent a few days.
[02:24:31.886 --> 02:24:35.068]  On the weekend, listening to a rebroadcast, I told this story.
[02:24:35.088 --> 02:24:37.509]  I've got to get to your calls on the news.
[02:24:37.569 --> 02:24:42.152]  It's just, I'm listening to it, and the whole thing was lies!
[02:24:44.914 --> 02:24:46.395]  You know, in the past, a lot of it was true.
[02:24:46.435 --> 02:24:50.938]  It was just like, and the Army, and everybody's gotten over their recruiting goals.
[02:24:50.958 --> 02:24:51.918]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:24:52.118 --> 02:24:56.601]  But the Liberals are lying, and I mean, the Army admits they weren't getting their goals.
[02:24:56.861 --> 02:24:58.102]  They lowered them.
[02:24:58.997 --> 02:24:59.798]  Massively.
[02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:01.959]  And then made over their goals.
[02:25:01.999 --> 02:25:09.104]  But now, even with the lowered goals, this month, they really, what is it, they were like 20,000 short?
[02:25:10.885 --> 02:25:11.305]  Of their 80,000 goal?
[02:25:11.325 --> 02:25:13.087]  I don't know, I got the article here.
[02:25:13.327 --> 02:25:14.848]  The point is, it's just, that's one of them.
[02:25:14.888 --> 02:25:18.170]  How do you deal with just, when everything's a lie?
[02:25:19.571 --> 02:25:21.212]  Like George Bush is a conservative.
[02:25:21.232 --> 02:25:23.554]  That is the most stupid lie.
[02:25:23.954 --> 02:25:28.477]  It's demonstrably, patently, on the face of it, a lie!
[02:25:30.329 --> 02:25:31.789]  Oh, wake up, people!
[02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:33.730]  Bush is a Trojan horse!
[02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:35.490]  We're losing this country!
[02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:37.370]  He's setting up martial law!
[02:25:39.371 --> 02:25:39.791]  Oh, man.
[02:25:40.591 --> 02:25:44.272]  Zeke, and then Art and Melissa, and I'm gonna be in for calls, those three.
[02:25:44.652 --> 02:25:45.912]  Zeke, go ahead, you're on the air, sir.
[02:25:46.212 --> 02:25:47.532]  Hi, Alex, how you doing?
[02:25:47.552 --> 02:25:48.952]  I'm ranting today.
[02:25:49.292 --> 02:25:49.873]  I hear you, I know.
[02:25:49.953 --> 02:25:54.653]  It's hard to understand what Bush says sometimes, like when he said that he saw the first plane hit the first tower.
[02:25:55.754 --> 02:25:56.934]  Well, you're supposed to ignore that.
[02:25:57.334 --> 02:25:57.534]  Yeah.
[02:25:58.112 --> 02:26:03.056]  Okay, one thing I wanted to mention was yesterday you had Tex Marz on and he was talking about Revelations and 666.
[02:26:03.336 --> 02:26:06.238]  Yes.
[02:26:06.938 --> 02:26:10.361]  And you know about the article about how all barcodes have 666 on them?
[02:26:10.781 --> 02:26:11.381]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:26:11.421 --> 02:26:12.903]  I had the inventor of the barcode on.
[02:26:13.623 --> 02:26:22.870]  And isn't that just a curiosity of Revelations, how things have to have the barcode in order to get sold and all barcodes have 666 on them?
[02:26:24.961 --> 02:26:30.243]  That is the calculation in the digital mathematical algorithm that makes them work.
[02:26:30.303 --> 02:26:33.084]  That's the formula that works for some reason.
[02:26:33.104 --> 02:26:39.686]  Yeah, you can look at a barcode and the first two strips, the last two strips, and the middle two strips are all the same.
[02:26:39.746 --> 02:26:42.667]  And those little two strips identify the number six.
[02:26:43.288 --> 02:26:43.768]  Yeah, I know.
[02:26:43.808 --> 02:26:44.328]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:26:44.915 --> 02:26:46.877]  I just wanted to get your opinion on that.
[02:26:46.897 --> 02:26:49.239]  Well, I mean, you know, it's a system.
[02:26:49.299 --> 02:26:50.040]  It's the chips.
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:51.181]  It's the biometrics.
[02:26:51.241 --> 02:26:53.083]  It's the buying the goods.
[02:26:53.143 --> 02:26:54.804]  It's only caring about yourself.
[02:26:55.205 --> 02:27:00.810]  It's a giggling, moronic, retarded, gibbering high school mentality system.
[02:27:03.092 --> 02:27:04.894]  I mean, it's the beast system.
[02:27:05.935 --> 02:27:07.396]  It's taking the vaccines.
[02:27:07.476 --> 02:27:08.958]  It's a whole stinking thing.
[02:27:10.934 --> 02:27:11.554]  Anything else?
[02:27:12.014 --> 02:27:12.595]  No, that's it.
[02:27:12.615 --> 02:27:13.715]  Thank you very much for your show.
[02:27:13.975 --> 02:27:14.895]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:27:14.955 --> 02:27:15.976]  I really appreciate it.
[02:27:17.716 --> 02:27:21.378]  And, you know, I get in here... When I get real mad like this, it's because I focus.
[02:27:21.418 --> 02:27:22.558]  I'm focusing on the world order.
[02:27:22.578 --> 02:27:24.399]  I'm, like, totally looking at it right now.
[02:27:24.719 --> 02:27:25.679]  Right now, I can see it.
[02:27:25.719 --> 02:27:32.202]  It is just a maggot-covered heap of rotten flesh with gouts of pus squirting.
[02:27:35.983 --> 02:27:36.903]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.363 --> 02:27:38.884]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:42.645]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.707 --> 02:27:47.248]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:27:47.408 --> 02:27:48.528]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:27:48.708 --> 02:27:52.110]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.670]  Phenol?
[02:27:52.970 --> 02:28:00.094]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:28:00.394 --> 02:28:04.496]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:28:04.596 --> 02:28:05.036]  Fragrance?
[02:28:05.416 --> 02:28:10.181]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:10.321 --> 02:28:15.006]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:28:15.226 --> 02:28:17.768]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:28:18.049 --> 02:28:21.452]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:28:21.612 --> 02:28:25.116]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[02:29:47.114 --> 02:29:52.419]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:29:52.739 --> 02:29:58.024]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:29:58.445 --> 02:30:01.407]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:30:58.390 --> 02:31:11.175]  There are a couple of mainstream news articles, they've got photos of it, where they found one dog that broke loose and got away, and they've confirmed that these fishing companies, with these Nubo Reef scum that fly in, they want to see great white sharks, so they chum the water.
[02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:23.460]  They really give folks some entertainment, they take a six month old lab puppy, they put big double hooks up through their nose, and then their water dog, they'll swim for hours, and they troll them around behind the boat,
[02:31:24.913 --> 02:31:26.474]  Folks, I'd already heard about this in Texas.
[02:31:26.514 --> 02:31:29.316]  Going way back, people take splat trash well.
[02:31:31.778 --> 02:31:32.478]  It's really sick.
[02:31:32.518 --> 02:31:37.342]  And so will some of the immigrants from certain areas of Asia.
[02:31:37.362 --> 02:31:39.163]  It seems everybody's got their scum.
[02:31:39.844 --> 02:31:44.167]  And I'd heard the joke, the trotline bait.
[02:31:44.187 --> 02:31:45.167]  I mean, this really goes on.
[02:31:45.588 --> 02:31:47.169]  But imagine a full-size
[02:31:48.138 --> 02:31:49.798]  You know, six-month-old lab puppy.
[02:31:49.818 --> 02:31:50.699]  They've got photos of it.
[02:31:51.199 --> 02:31:55.000]  And then they chum the water, and then they drag that little thing behind.
[02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:58.280]  So a bunch of scum can look at great whites.
[02:31:58.921 --> 02:32:01.041]  You know, Richie Riches with their girlfriends.
[02:32:01.081 --> 02:32:01.821]  Ooh, look!
[02:32:01.881 --> 02:32:03.222]  Ooh, big scary shark!
[02:32:03.302 --> 02:32:03.742]  Ooh!
[02:32:03.762 --> 02:32:07.463]  I mean, I'm not for cruel and unusual punishment, because it always gets out of control.
[02:32:07.503 --> 02:32:11.384]  But scum like that just needs to have... I want to knock their teeth out, man.
[02:32:11.424 --> 02:32:11.864]  I tell you.
[02:32:12.504 --> 02:32:16.925]  But folks, we get upset about those dogs being drug around and being fed to sharks.
[02:32:18.945 --> 02:32:19.505]  That's nothing.
[02:32:20.085 --> 02:32:23.927]  I mean, human beings are more important, and let me tell you something.
[02:32:24.147 --> 02:32:29.249]  Minor footnote that China openly advertises we got the best collagen for melted down people we've killed.
[02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:31.630]  Mainstream news.
[02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:32.550]  Just, ah, so what?
[02:32:32.591 --> 02:32:34.591]  Yeah, and ooh, I hear that's really good.
[02:32:34.611 --> 02:32:36.192]  Ooh, I want some.
[02:32:36.252 --> 02:32:37.152]  You think you're safe?
[02:32:37.853 --> 02:32:40.254]  When you go get your lips injected with some murdered person?
[02:32:41.094 --> 02:32:42.174]  I mean, you think you're safe?
[02:32:42.795 --> 02:32:44.695]  You think it isn't going to come back on you?
[02:32:44.895 --> 02:32:46.656]  What is your major malfunction?
[02:32:47.356 --> 02:32:48.617]  You people don't love life?
[02:32:49.289 --> 02:32:50.470]  You love death, don't you?
[02:32:52.972 --> 02:32:54.853]  You are absolute scum!
[02:32:57.915 --> 02:33:05.820]  So, you know, then I asked God, I said, God, maybe, I mean, pestilence, destruction, good people, bad people getting caught in it?
[02:33:07.261 --> 02:33:08.222]  That's what we deserve.
[02:33:08.262 --> 02:33:10.904]  We really are a degenerate, out-of-control species.
[02:33:11.244 --> 02:33:12.505]  We are fallen, folks.
[02:33:13.605 --> 02:33:15.707]  And, you know, faith without works is dead.
[02:33:15.727 --> 02:33:17.448]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:33:18.587 --> 02:33:21.809]  You've got to have faith, and if you've got the faith, you're going to do the works, folks.
[02:33:23.149 --> 02:33:24.750]  It's like an apple tree is going to grow apples.
[02:33:26.271 --> 02:33:28.992]  And then again, the devil creates some false argument and all of that.
[02:33:29.412 --> 02:33:42.519]  I mean, if you're not compelled to constantly fight this thing, if you're not driven to fight this thing, if you're not worried about what's happening, if you're worried about petty issues, or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, you've got a problem.
[02:33:44.173 --> 02:33:51.176]  And so when you freak out seeing the little dog photo we got on the website with the hooks through its nose, listen, you need to understand something.
[02:33:51.216 --> 02:33:52.656]  I love dogs a lot.
[02:33:53.056 --> 02:33:55.777]  But I love those little Chinese children a lot more.
[02:33:56.057 --> 02:33:56.497]  And you know what?
[02:33:56.517 --> 02:33:57.798]  They come by your house there.
[02:33:59.201 --> 02:34:01.702]  And they come by and you've been hiding that baby and it's two months old.
[02:34:01.722 --> 02:34:02.903]  They drag that baby out.
[02:34:03.383 --> 02:34:04.883]  And they take that baby alive now.
[02:34:04.923 --> 02:34:06.164]  They don't just ground them on the spot.
[02:34:06.564 --> 02:34:07.925]  They'll even keep that baby alive.
[02:34:08.185 --> 02:34:10.446]  And they sell those babies for medical experimentations.
[02:34:10.746 --> 02:34:13.227]  And they do stuff to babies in laboratories here in the U.S.
[02:34:13.487 --> 02:34:18.149]  and all over Asia and all over the world that will make you want to just pull your hair out.
[02:34:18.969 --> 02:34:23.651]  Just like the Israelis took those 100,000 Israeli children and microwaved their little heads.
[02:34:24.631 --> 02:34:25.672]  Healthy little children.
[02:34:25.692 --> 02:34:28.414]  Can you imagine taking those sweet little innocent children?
[02:34:28.574 --> 02:34:30.136]  Because that's what the devil wants, folks.
[02:34:30.456 --> 02:34:37.122]  The globalists have got their excuses of why they do it, but it's because they're a bunch of pit of hell, black hole dwellers, man.
[02:34:37.422 --> 02:34:41.566]  They are right out of the gates of hell, right out of the center of Satan's mind.
[02:34:41.906 --> 02:34:48.171]  They are just blasphemous filth, just rotten scum that needs to be sent straight to hell.
[02:34:49.953 --> 02:34:51.474]  That's where you're going to!
[02:34:51.534 --> 02:34:52.295]  You better know it!
[02:34:53.177 --> 02:34:57.240]  People are tuning in right now to listen to this maniac, if you aren't freaking out.
[02:34:57.621 --> 02:35:16.376]  I see these people on the news with their faces dressed up, and paint all over them, screaming and freaking out because some stupid football team doesn't make some ridiculous, absolutely mindless, petty, doesn't matter one cent, stupid touchdown, when they're melting people down for collagen!
[02:35:17.116 --> 02:35:18.097]  And we're buying it!
[02:35:19.594 --> 02:35:25.257]  When they got dogs dragging them around behind with a bunch of nouveau riche trash watching great whites hit them.
[02:35:26.837 --> 02:35:31.820]  And Bush is saying, get rid of posse comitatus and the Marine Corps has got chance now about killing your children.
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:36.862]  Yes, mainstream news, the chance aren't kill a commie, now it's kill the school children, murder them.
[02:35:37.442 --> 02:35:40.203]  Marine, when you go through that door, who are you going to see?
[02:35:40.263 --> 02:35:40.764]  My mother.
[02:35:40.824 --> 02:35:41.504]  What are you going to do?
[02:35:41.604 --> 02:35:42.624]  I'm going to kill her!
[02:35:42.664 --> 02:35:46.646]  I'm going to feel recoil!
[02:35:46.866 --> 02:35:48.247]  Here, let's just get it out in the open.
[02:35:50.188 --> 02:35:51.449]  Let's just get it out in the open!
[02:35:51.549 --> 02:35:52.630]  We are demons!
[02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:55.292]  We've killed 50 million babies in this country!
[02:35:55.432 --> 02:35:58.855]  We are scum, scum, scum, scum, scum, scum!
[02:35:59.195 --> 02:36:00.796]  We have to come to terms with that!
[02:36:02.598 --> 02:36:03.739]  Your family comes first!
[02:36:03.759 --> 02:36:07.582]  They shaved your head, told you that you're the elite, so now you chant you'll kill your mommy?
[02:36:08.662 --> 02:36:09.383]  That's evil!
[02:36:09.403 --> 02:36:11.204]  The Marines didn't do that 20 years ago!
[02:36:11.385 --> 02:36:12.726]  They didn't do that 50 years ago!
[02:36:12.886 --> 02:36:13.927]  We're all being warped!
[02:36:14.207 --> 02:36:18.210]  Our symbols weren't skulls and death, ladies and gentlemen, when we founded this country!
[02:36:19.042 --> 02:36:23.985]  Are Abrams tanks driving around with 666 and human skulls hanging off of them?
[02:36:24.145 --> 02:36:25.206]  That's evil, folks!
[02:36:25.806 --> 02:36:27.007]  That's manifest evil!
[02:36:27.107 --> 02:36:30.069]  And we've been in evil so long, we don't even recognize it!
[02:36:30.949 --> 02:36:40.795]  That little soft, that little bag of garbage, that little bag of evil, Alberto Gonzalez writes, that little soft twit, that little oily criminal,
[02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:53.257]  He's never done anything in his life, and he sits up there as that Attorney General, when he was Chief Counsel for Bush, he said, we can torture people to death, and if we don't call it torture, it ain't torture.
[02:36:55.879 --> 02:37:01.301]  And then they hire a bunch of psychopaths, like to pull families over to checkpoints, the Army's own documents.
[02:37:02.062 --> 02:37:11.387]  Upwards of 90%, totally innocent, taken to camps, where human filth, where Ted Bundy's, get to act out their fantasies, day after day, and they never get in trouble.
[02:37:15.593 --> 02:37:17.994]  These people need to be brought to justice.
[02:37:18.975 --> 02:37:21.335]  God's laws demand it.
[02:37:21.395 --> 02:37:22.916]  The universe demands it.
[02:37:24.177 --> 02:37:26.518]  For every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[02:37:28.879 --> 02:37:29.899]  I don't like sitting up here.
[02:37:29.919 --> 02:37:32.680]  I don't sit here and feel good about myself shooting my mouth off.
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:36.482]  I don't sit here and feel all high and mighty talking about all this scum.
[02:37:37.682 --> 02:37:38.823]  It's scary, folks!
[02:37:38.883 --> 02:37:39.803]  It's dangerous!
[02:37:40.754 --> 02:37:45.297]  Just because I don't veil my eyes and I let myself look at it for what it really is.
[02:37:45.877 --> 02:37:48.559]  It's hard for human mind to even process it.
[02:37:48.719 --> 02:37:51.321]  I can't even absorb the evil.
[02:37:51.601 --> 02:37:56.204]  My mind and my eyes and my soul aren't even built to be able to fathom it.
[02:37:56.484 --> 02:37:58.265]  So I actually don't see the whole thing.
[02:37:58.485 --> 02:38:02.068]  But what I see is so clear and so evil.
[02:38:02.108 --> 02:38:03.269]  We're being seduced.
[02:38:03.509 --> 02:38:04.409]  We're being twisted.
[02:38:04.449 --> 02:38:05.370]  We're being molded.
[02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:08.452]  We're being turned into just absolute demons right now.
[02:38:09.375 --> 02:38:11.716]  We're falling even further right now.
[02:38:11.816 --> 02:38:17.479]  We are being swallowed right now into literal hell on earth.
[02:38:17.519 --> 02:38:19.780]  The judgment is going to be horrible.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:21.781]  The fire is going to be horrible.
[02:38:22.081 --> 02:38:23.482]  It's going to be grievous.
[02:38:25.082 --> 02:38:28.604]  We can get that hundred year reprieve, but we've got to seek God's face.
[02:38:28.664 --> 02:38:29.985]  We've got to get involved.
[02:38:30.145 --> 02:38:31.585]  We've got to get aggressive.
[02:38:31.725 --> 02:38:33.086]  We've got to get fearless.
[02:38:33.266 --> 02:38:35.347]  We've got to sacrifice ourselves.
[02:38:35.567 --> 02:38:37.328]  That's the only sacrifice God sees.
[02:38:38.502 --> 02:38:42.225]  We have got to put ourselves against the machinery and say NO!
[02:38:43.005 --> 02:38:44.226]  We've done it throughout history.
[02:38:44.386 --> 02:38:45.547]  We've got to do it again.
[02:38:45.767 --> 02:38:48.650]  Stop sucking your thumbs and telling people we can't do it!
[02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:50.911]  We've got to do it!
[02:38:51.472 --> 02:38:53.073]  We've got to do it now!
[02:38:54.454 --> 02:38:57.296]  I can see the literal signature of this thing.
[02:38:57.356 --> 02:38:58.517]  It's growing right now.
[02:38:58.597 --> 02:38:59.678]  It's out of control.
[02:39:01.279 --> 02:39:02.920]  Great evil is about to befell us.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:06.563]  A great expansion of this beast system is about to come down on us.
[02:39:07.458 --> 02:39:09.820]  We're literally entering the gates of hell!
[02:39:12.261 --> 02:39:13.282]  It's not funny!
[02:39:14.743 --> 02:39:15.564]  It's real!
[02:39:17.385 --> 02:39:20.347]  Alright, I'm giving you each a minute because I've got to get to this news.
[02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:27.332]  Let's go ahead and just, who's up next here?
[02:39:29.954 --> 02:39:31.054]  Art in Florida and Melissa.
[02:39:31.255 --> 02:39:31.875]  Art, go ahead.
[02:39:33.276 --> 02:39:34.157]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[02:39:34.237 --> 02:39:35.257]  Pleasure to talk with you, sir.
[02:39:35.277 --> 02:39:35.938]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:39:37.227 --> 02:39:46.134]  Several callers back, you had a fellow speaking about last night's History Channel show on secret societies and so forth.
[02:39:46.694 --> 02:39:58.943]  And during the program, one of the key speakers, I guess, the participants, struck me as an apologist for these societies, the secrecy of these societies.
[02:39:58.963 --> 02:40:04.567]  I turned to my wife and I said to her, I bet this guy's a member of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[02:40:05.276 --> 02:40:09.917]  And sure enough, the apologist was Pipes.
[02:40:10.838 --> 02:40:11.738]  Daniel Pipes?
[02:40:11.918 --> 02:40:12.718]  Yeah, I know who he is.
[02:40:12.838 --> 02:40:13.679]  Yeah, I'll show you.
[02:40:13.719 --> 02:40:21.001]  I went to my foreign affairs book, annual report, and there he is, listed among the members.
[02:40:21.281 --> 02:40:22.821]  And by the way, that's put out by them.
[02:40:22.861 --> 02:40:23.962]  You can call and get a free copy.
[02:40:24.142 --> 02:40:24.582]  Oh, I know.
[02:40:24.822 --> 02:40:25.562]  I got a free copy.
[02:40:25.582 --> 02:40:26.202]  Yeah, I have to.
[02:40:26.242 --> 02:40:26.903]  I get it every year, too.
[02:40:26.963 --> 02:40:29.323]  No, but I mean, some people think, oh, that's just your book.
[02:40:29.483 --> 02:40:32.704]  Oh, no, they're proud of their work and so forth.
[02:40:32.784 --> 02:40:33.464]  Especially in boxes.
[02:40:33.505 --> 02:40:34.285]  It doesn't exist.
[02:40:35.641 --> 02:40:47.504]  But that's why he was explaining away the harmlessness of particularly the Bilderberg lyrics.
[02:40:47.764 --> 02:40:50.084]  I've got a suggestion for you, Ray.
[02:40:50.124 --> 02:40:52.765]  I'm telling you how to run your show when you're doing a great job.
[02:40:52.885 --> 02:40:54.985]  No, I'm not.
[02:40:55.085 --> 02:41:03.267]  Oftentimes there's occasion to refer you folks to the quote mainstream media and so forth
[02:41:03.809 --> 02:41:05.671]  How about the government propaganda arm?
[02:41:06.111 --> 02:41:07.652]  Well, alright.
[02:41:07.872 --> 02:41:10.154]  How about the duplicitous press?
[02:41:10.454 --> 02:41:11.815]  Has a nice ring to it.
[02:41:12.336 --> 02:41:13.717]  And they are duplicitous.
[02:41:13.897 --> 02:41:18.761]  They are involved in this deceit, lie.
[02:41:18.781 --> 02:41:23.184]  The editor of the New York Times said back in the 40s or whatever when he quit, he said, we're whores, we're paid for.
[02:41:23.204 --> 02:41:26.627]  The minute we told the truth, we'd be out of here.
[02:41:27.608 --> 02:41:28.528]  I didn't know that.
[02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:33.653]  That was my main point to tell your listeners.
[02:41:34.674 --> 02:41:39.598]  What do you think of people using Labrador puppies for shark bait?
[02:41:40.498 --> 02:41:41.659]  I didn't know it.
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:45.802]  I hear about these things from your program.
[02:41:45.822 --> 02:41:50.146]  What do you think about China melting down murdered?
[02:41:54.343 --> 02:42:01.809]  Many, many nefarious things that are going on throughout the world that most people don't have a foggiest idea of what it's all about.
[02:42:01.949 --> 02:42:06.032]  And you talk to them and they want to drool at you and smile at you, stupid fools.
[02:42:06.092 --> 02:42:06.732]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:06.753 --> 02:42:10.495]  I mean, it's just you look at them and they're just poor little pathetic creatures.
[02:42:11.136 --> 02:42:12.337]  And the globalists just love it.
[02:42:12.357 --> 02:42:13.698]  They love how stupid you are.
[02:42:13.718 --> 02:42:15.039]  And I mean that about myself, too.
[02:42:15.059 --> 02:42:16.480]  They love it that we're not involved.
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:18.482]  They love it that we want to be stupid.
[02:42:18.802 --> 02:42:20.203]  It's just a big joke to them.
[02:42:20.563 --> 02:42:22.405]  Melissa in Texas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:42:23.035 --> 02:42:23.695]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:23.895 --> 02:42:24.155]  Hi.
[02:42:24.995 --> 02:42:25.856]  I have two points.
[02:42:25.916 --> 02:42:39.258]  The first would be a paraphrase, um, in Genesis, and God saw mankind that he had made and he repented of ever making them because the thoughts of their heart were continually evil all the time.
[02:42:40.479 --> 02:42:41.159]  That's where we are.
[02:42:41.499 --> 02:42:42.699]  Continually evil?
[02:42:42.959 --> 02:42:43.119]  Yes.
[02:42:43.699 --> 02:42:47.400]  Well, that's kind of a, I can't remember the exact quote, but you look, it'll, it's pretty close.
[02:42:48.092 --> 02:42:49.452]  No, I've read the verse, yeah.
[02:42:49.573 --> 02:42:53.354]  The second thing, well, and then, you know, the next one will be as it was in the days of Noah.
[02:42:54.454 --> 02:43:00.976]  So shall it be before the coming of the Son of Man, which is the only long-lasting hope that we really have.
[02:43:02.257 --> 02:43:07.799]  The point that I called originally about was you were talking about SARS and the avian flu.
[02:43:10.139 --> 02:43:14.661]  I have a friend who was going to UT when that whole SARS thing was happening.
[02:43:15.598 --> 02:43:20.540]  And he is an honest and decent young man who I believe wholeheartedly.
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:29.204]  He had a classmate at the time who was on exchange program to China, to Beijing for medical training.
[02:43:30.064 --> 02:43:35.387]  And he was there, this friend was there in Beijing when this whole thing was supposedly happening.
[02:43:36.347 --> 02:43:40.949]  And my friend, when the guy came back from Beijing three weeks later,
[02:43:41.776 --> 02:43:44.418]  My friend said, well, did you have trouble getting out of China?
[02:43:44.879 --> 02:43:50.163]  And how was it being locked down in that hospital for all those weeks where you couldn't come or go or do anything?
[02:43:50.183 --> 02:43:53.926]  And he said, I saw that on the internet.
[02:43:54.066 --> 02:43:56.408]  I saw what they were reporting in the United States.
[02:43:56.488 --> 02:43:57.629]  And he said, that never happened.
[02:43:58.210 --> 02:43:59.511]  That's all a big fraud.
[02:43:59.971 --> 02:44:00.872]  It never happened.
[02:44:00.912 --> 02:44:01.553]  They never locked us in.
[02:44:01.573 --> 02:44:02.013]  It's all a big fraud.
[02:44:02.033 --> 02:44:03.995]  They're going to have martial law and beat on us.
[02:44:04.155 --> 02:44:05.636]  The blood drinking vampires.
[02:44:05.896 --> 02:44:09.819]  Well, and so that they can inject us with their avian flu.
[02:44:09.839 --> 02:44:10.340]  Scum murdering.
[02:44:11.417 --> 02:44:12.278]  They're coming for us!
[02:44:12.298 --> 02:44:13.759]  We better hate them!
[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:17.842]  Well, it makes me ashamed of the whole human race.
[02:44:18.022 --> 02:44:19.083]  They're coming for us!
[02:44:19.103 --> 02:44:20.844]  We gotta get together and do something!
[02:44:20.864 --> 02:44:23.567]  We gotta fight them!
[02:44:23.607 --> 02:44:25.028]  They're attacking us right now!
[02:44:25.048 --> 02:44:25.728]  I'm sick of them!
[02:44:25.748 --> 02:44:28.751]  A few thousand scumbags controlling the whole thing, Melissa.
[02:44:28.931 --> 02:44:29.311]  I know it.
[02:44:29.972 --> 02:44:30.332]  I know.
[02:44:30.772 --> 02:44:32.914]  And... It just makes me mad, people putting...
[02:44:34.232 --> 02:44:35.533]  This stuff makes me mad.
[02:44:35.553 --> 02:44:37.934]  They've been doing that with kittens also.
[02:44:38.274 --> 02:44:41.356]  The fellow BL that lives in Corpus that used to call in a lot?
[02:44:41.696 --> 02:44:41.956]  Yeah.
[02:44:42.156 --> 02:44:45.558]  He was going to try and stop them from using kittens out there.
[02:44:45.578 --> 02:44:47.579]  He said you could sit on the beach and watch it.
[02:44:47.779 --> 02:44:50.181]  No, my dad told me that when I was a kid.
[02:44:50.241 --> 02:44:53.262]  Shark fishing, they'd use live bait, kittens and puppies.
[02:44:53.282 --> 02:44:54.063]  I mean, he didn't do that.
[02:44:54.103 --> 02:44:55.283]  He'd heard about it.
[02:44:56.624 --> 02:44:57.945]  What is wrong with people?
[02:44:58.025 --> 02:45:00.226]  I just can't even fathom that kind of mindset.
[02:45:00.805 --> 02:45:03.647]  Well, it's just a joke.
[02:45:03.707 --> 02:45:04.747]  Oh, that's trotline bait.
[02:45:05.048 --> 02:45:05.708]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:06.629 --> 02:45:07.589]  I appreciate it, Melissa.
[02:45:08.189 --> 02:45:09.450]  I don't have time to go David and others.
[02:45:09.490 --> 02:45:09.730]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:10.471]  I told you to hold it.
[02:45:10.551 --> 02:45:11.291]  I just can't get to it.
[02:45:11.391 --> 02:45:12.572]  I have to cover some of this news.
[02:45:13.833 --> 02:45:17.755]  Harriet Myers was the fixer for Bush's National Guard records purge.
[02:45:17.795 --> 02:45:18.836]  That's mainstream news.
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:20.040]  Eh, so what?
[02:45:20.501 --> 02:45:22.541]  Meyers' record begins to fill in.
[02:45:22.561 --> 02:45:23.482]  This is RollNet Daily.
[02:45:23.522 --> 02:45:26.043]  Bush picks supported international criminal court.
[02:45:26.083 --> 02:45:27.003]  Well, I mean, who doesn't?
[02:45:27.023 --> 02:45:27.404]  Bush does.
[02:45:27.844 --> 02:45:28.944]  Homosexual adoptions.
[02:45:28.964 --> 02:45:31.105]  That means stolen from other families, by the way.
[02:45:31.766 --> 02:45:32.986]  Women in combat.
[02:45:33.046 --> 02:45:36.108]  Well, Bush tried to use, you know, the whole private lynch thing to do that.
[02:45:36.628 --> 02:45:37.708]  And major tax hikes.
[02:45:37.828 --> 02:45:38.749]  Well, of course!
[02:45:38.829 --> 02:45:42.250]  What do you think he wanted Alberto Gonzalez for?
[02:45:43.411 --> 02:45:45.752]  And, by the way, I mean, Roberts is the same.
[02:45:46.815 --> 02:45:48.716]  I don't care what the 700 Club tells you.
[02:45:49.276 --> 02:45:49.916]  700 lies.
[02:45:51.117 --> 02:45:53.558]  New indictment against Bush ally.
[02:45:54.578 --> 02:45:54.838]  Again.
[02:45:54.858 --> 02:46:01.161]  I mean, they indicted him on something that didn't even become law until late 2003.
[02:46:01.541 --> 02:46:06.723]  So he committed things that weren't illegal before that point under the law they chose.
[02:46:07.303 --> 02:46:09.004]  Clearly he did money launder, but again.
[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:12.120]  He should go free.
[02:46:12.701 --> 02:46:13.621]  It should all be dropped now.
[02:46:13.801 --> 02:46:17.102]  You make mistakes, you do false prosecutions, the whole thing's null and void.
[02:46:17.202 --> 02:46:19.883]  I don't care if the guy money laundered a hundred million dollars.
[02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:21.564]  He goes free!
[02:46:22.664 --> 02:46:27.726]  The system is designed to protect the people because the government is the threat.
[02:46:28.446 --> 02:46:30.167]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:46:30.607 --> 02:46:31.167]  I know you do.
[02:46:31.227 --> 02:46:32.388]  Most of you are smarter than I am.
[02:46:32.428 --> 02:46:36.009]  I'm talking to people out there who are listening who just don't understand it.
[02:46:39.046 --> 02:46:42.509]  Do not email me telling me, you're a Republican, you like delay.
[02:46:42.749 --> 02:46:44.430]  Delay is an absolute piece of filth.
[02:46:45.431 --> 02:46:46.471]  So is Ronnie Earl.
[02:46:47.392 --> 02:46:48.413]  All a bunch of trash.
[02:46:50.134 --> 02:46:51.535]  I'm just, I sound really mean today.
[02:46:51.575 --> 02:46:52.896]  I'm just tired of it, folks.
[02:46:54.977 --> 02:46:57.299]  Tammy Bruce is saying Bush is turning into Jimmy Carter.
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:46:59.120]  It's true.
[02:47:00.261 --> 02:47:02.402]  Then there's Lynne Cheney's lesbian sex novel.
[02:47:03.043 --> 02:47:06.185]  Well of course, everybody knows about Dick Cheney and the Bohemian Grove.
[02:47:06.665 --> 02:47:08.046]  He's quite the animal, folks.
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:12.462]  Um, I'm not going to say it.
[02:47:13.583 --> 02:47:15.204]  Keep it sealed, keep it secret.
[02:47:15.584 --> 02:47:17.946]  Secret paper links Thatcher to freebies probe.
[02:47:18.386 --> 02:47:21.428]  Only Thatcher's son's been grabbed for trying to overthrow countries in Africa.
[02:47:22.889 --> 02:47:26.672]  Group, again, pickets the prison where eminent domain protester held.
[02:47:26.692 --> 02:47:32.716]  She just tried to go to the city council building, she lives there, and the building was half empty there, and there's a hall, and they just went ahead and arrested her.
[02:47:33.396 --> 02:47:38.560]  It just didn't matter, it didn't mean, it meant absolutely nothing to anybody.
[02:47:39.178 --> 02:47:41.399]  And now in England they're arresting peaceful protesters.
[02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:44.481]  It's just so scary.
[02:47:44.501 --> 02:47:48.864]  And there's another article where they beat detainees until they were brain damaged and blind.
[02:47:48.884 --> 02:47:50.725]  It's all mainstream news.
[02:47:50.785 --> 02:47:52.206]  Just all randomly beat you.
[02:47:52.626 --> 02:47:53.566]  Oh, but they're terrorists.
[02:47:53.586 --> 02:47:54.547]  They deserve to be beaten.
[02:47:55.728 --> 02:47:57.529]  They can say anybody's a terrorist.
[02:47:58.229 --> 02:47:59.310]  They're setting that precedent.
[02:48:00.951 --> 02:48:02.872]  Bush is moving to torture probes.
[02:48:02.892 --> 02:48:05.193]  He's moving to try to block that on Capitol Hill.
[02:48:05.213 --> 02:48:08.475]  Threatening to not accept budgets if they don't drop it.
[02:48:10.151 --> 02:48:12.672]  And China shutting down more websites in crackdown.
[02:48:12.712 --> 02:48:16.233]  Associated Press, our own government's moving to shut down websites here too for free speech.
[02:48:18.713 --> 02:48:19.394]  There's another one.
[02:48:19.994 --> 02:48:22.954]  Many smokers angry over push to ban drivers from lighting up.
[02:48:23.815 --> 02:48:25.335]  Yeah, it's just an excuse to get in your life.
[02:48:26.595 --> 02:48:31.297]  Governor Sean Bush's military plan survey finds most believe disaster relief is local job.
[02:48:31.717 --> 02:48:34.718]  Wait till they create a bunch of hype over the
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:37.782]  Turkey flu.
[02:48:37.802 --> 02:48:38.424]  Bird flu.
[02:48:38.704 --> 02:48:39.466]  Possum flu.
[02:48:40.008 --> 02:48:41.351]  Whatever new flu they've got.
[02:48:42.895 --> 02:48:43.496]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.931 --> 02:48:52.753]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.093 --> 02:48:54.453]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.653 --> 02:48:56.854]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.014 --> 02:48:59.094]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.375 --> 02:49:04.296]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.636 --> 02:49:08.637]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.917 --> 02:49:10.698]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.778 --> 02:49:21.424]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.565 --> 02:49:23.466]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:52:15.335 --> 02:52:23.340]  In this degenerate world... Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:23.781 --> 02:52:25.201]  Look, we need to be mad about evil.
[02:52:25.222 --> 02:52:26.502]  We need to be mad about corruption.
[02:52:26.783 --> 02:52:29.324]  People in the past wouldn't put up with it because they knew how it spread.
[02:52:29.344 --> 02:52:30.205]  It's dangerous!
[02:52:30.585 --> 02:52:31.426]  It threatens us!
[02:52:33.573 --> 02:52:37.354]  I mean, you know, it's just out of control right now.
[02:52:38.274 --> 02:52:40.115]  Because you've had it so good, so long.
[02:52:41.075 --> 02:52:42.015]  This is good news, though.
[02:52:42.435 --> 02:52:44.075]  Governors shun Bush's military plan.
[02:52:44.295 --> 02:52:46.456]  They also shun the forced inoculation plan, see?
[02:52:47.616 --> 02:52:50.317]  Survey finds most believe his has to leave his local job.
[02:52:51.277 --> 02:52:55.198]  A majority of nation's governors say they're not on board with President Bush's suggestion
[02:52:56.115 --> 02:53:00.678]  That active duty military take the lead role in providing disaster relief, a new poll says.
[02:53:00.698 --> 02:53:08.324]  According to USA Today's survey, just two of 38 governors who reported to the newspaper's query said they backed the president's plan.
[02:53:08.604 --> 02:53:16.410]  Republican governors Tim Pawlenty, absolute traitor of Minnesota, and Mitt Romney, another piece of trash.
[02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:20.073]  I mean, just absolute scum of the earth from Massachusetts.
[02:53:21.002 --> 02:53:27.186]  And about half of those who responded said they were either opposed or held reservations about Bush's plan.
[02:53:27.506 --> 02:53:33.450]  According to the group, the paper said, was GOP Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, the President's brother.
[02:53:36.852 --> 02:53:41.775]  So, uh... So Jeb Bush doesn't like it.
[02:53:42.036 --> 02:53:44.197]  That's because they know it's political Harry Carey.
[02:53:44.895 --> 02:53:54.537]  Younger Bush, during his tenure as Florida Chief Executive, has gained much experience in providing disaster release, having had to oversee the management and recovery of a record number of major storms since taking office.
[02:54:00.038 --> 02:54:03.378]  By the way, you can use troops in emergencies.
[02:54:04.118 --> 02:54:06.939]  Posse Comandatus is so they can run our lives, folks.
[02:54:06.979 --> 02:54:07.799]  It's martial law.
[02:54:08.139 --> 02:54:10.760]  They want to get rid of that, because they've been training for it feverishly.
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.320]  Well, who are you against the troops?
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:12.860]  No!
[02:54:14.193 --> 02:54:18.375]  I'm not against Germany when their government does something wrong and I criticize Gerhard Schroeder.
[02:54:20.276 --> 02:54:22.877]  I'm not against England when I talk bad about Tony Blair.
[02:54:22.917 --> 02:54:28.020]  I'm not against Israel when I criticize that demon over there, Ariel Sharon.
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:33.523]  Or when I criticize the demon leader they've got of China or the demon leader of this country.
[02:54:36.504 --> 02:54:37.084]  Oh, man.
[02:54:38.685 --> 02:54:39.706]  Oh, there's a lot of other news.
[02:54:39.726 --> 02:54:42.127]  You've absolutely got to visit.
[02:54:43.669 --> 02:55:08.459]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and what really made me mad today what what made me go off I just love dogs and I look at this picture live dogs use a shark bait incredible cruelty this rescue dog has had a supper super-sized fishing hook skewered through his snout so it can be dragged behind the boat as live shark bait and
[02:55:09.728 --> 02:55:10.228]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:10.609 --> 02:55:13.330]  This is out of the UK Sun, but it was also a Barber & Reuters.
[02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:17.733]  Stray dogs are being skewered by hooks and dragged behind boats as live shark bait in the sun.
[02:55:18.173 --> 02:55:25.597]  Shockingly revealed, the quill practice takes place on French-controlled Reunion Island, in the Indian Ocean, where Prince William spent holidays.
[02:55:25.737 --> 02:55:26.918]  It's a very elite area.
[02:55:27.898 --> 02:55:29.920]  And that's where they go out in the Richie Riches drive-around.
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:30.840]  They want to see great whites.
[02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:34.422]  They've basically got the sharks trained to come eat the dogs every day.
[02:55:35.683 --> 02:55:37.604]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:40.981]  And, uh, the scum sees you as that dog.
[02:55:41.441 --> 02:55:46.544]  I'm gonna be showing my new film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, 30-something minutes of new footage added.
[02:55:46.584 --> 02:55:47.325]  It's really good.
