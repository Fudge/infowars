[00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:06.173]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.874]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:09.734]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:11.194]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:12.835]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:17.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.056]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:43.417]  It is Monday, the 7th day of March 2005.
[00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.378]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.860]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.741]  Buffett is betting against the dollar.
[00:00:52.802 --> 00:01:05.127]  He made almost $3 billion last year doing it, and we'll talk about, well, why Mr. Buffett and other top globalists are doing this with the country that they live in, and the country where they made all of this money.
[00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:15.198]  We have more and more TV shows out promoting torture, telling everybody how great it is, including the torture of children to get answers for the government.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.529]  I will also get into 50% or 50 cents of every tax dollar goes to pay for all these new wars.
[00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:34.151]  Say no to the big brother plan for the internet, this side of the Toronto Star, going into some of the plans they have to regulate and take the net over.
[00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:38.795]  And they have to because more and more people are leaving the mainstream media.
[00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.139]  I mean, on a weekly basis, they're losing control of the information war.
[00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:49.336]  Private firms to police terror orders in the US and in England.
[00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:56.209]  More and more quote private watchdog firms are taking control of regulatory systems of our governments.
[00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:58.216]  U.S.
[00:01:58.276 --> 00:02:05.280]  targets spy services abroad and has shipped hundreds of people overseas to be tortured in third-party countries.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.742]  More and more of this now coming out.
[00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:14.947]  Syria is to redeploy its troops up against its border, not fully pulling them out of Lebanon.
[00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:15.907]  That's not enough.
[00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:24.133]  The war drums are beating savagely right now for war with Syria and Iran.
[00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:25.574]  And that could kick off any time.
[00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:31.977]  We now have a defense pact between Iran and Syria, something we haven't seen ever before.
[00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:35.080]  It's getting very, very serious.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.804]  Also, police arrest an 8-year-old after alleged outbursts.
[00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:43.707]  Now yelling in Williamsburg Elementary School.
[00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.609]  Now yelling when you're 8 years old.
[00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.791]  Get you arrested.
[00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:53.155]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:56.138]  I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:57.759]  I don't want to give them what they want.
[00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:04.642]  I've been busy making a new film that I've now released, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:09.245]  It'll be shipping out at the end of this week for people that want to order it.
[00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:16.969]  I'd like to hear from the listeners that are members of PrisonPlanet.tv that have had a chance to watch Martial Law.
[00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.890]  We released it first on the internet.
[00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:22.246]  I've been very busy.
[00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:35.612]  You know, I meant three weeks ago to write a rebuttal to the Popular Mechanics hit piece, but I was literally working 14 hours a day on top of this radio show on the new film and was just unable to do it.
[00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:46.677]  But I went out of town this weekend with the family, just a few days off, here locally, and returning home I found out about Mr. Chertoff,
[00:03:47.734 --> 00:04:06.045]  Reportedly, the cousin, the first cousin of the new Homeland Security Chief, who's been intimately involved in 9-11 and the cover-up of it, I learned that he savaged me for over three hours, and others, but particularly myself, savaged me.
[00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:12.909]  And, you know, that's his right to do it, but I have confirmed that he said repeatedly, why won't Mr. Jones call in and defend himself?
[00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:18.797]  This is in the middle of the night, and as if I could even call in to Coast to Coast AM.
[00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:20.778]  You just can't call into that show.
[00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.700]  But, no, I was asleep.
[00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:32.246]  I was asleep Saturday night at 9 p.m., getting some much-needed recharge of the battery.
[00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:39.551]  So, I'm going to address this guy, and I'm going to try to deal with it.
[00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.272]  I'm going to try to write a response to it.
[00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:47.735]  The fraud in this article is so huge it's encyclopedic.
[00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:52.199]  I mean, if I try to respond to it properly, I mean, it'll be a 14-volume set.
[00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:52.979]  And I'm not joking.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.262]  We're talking about thousands of pages to properly do this.
[00:04:56.702 --> 00:04:57.323]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:07.739]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.440]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:11.842]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:14.084]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:19.288]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.628 --> 00:05:23.671]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.671]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:36.413]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:38.434]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:42.514]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:44.175]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:44.735]  That's 888-2533139.

[00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:55.684]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:08.853]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:20.361]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:23.224]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:27.667]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:30.009]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.051]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:38.258]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:44.104]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:48.449]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.170]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.871]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.180]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:07.082]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:07:07.262 --> 00:07:08.643]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:18.747]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:20.708]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:24.853]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:29.518]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:33.562]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:39.909]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:42.970]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.471]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:50.452]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:07:50.572 --> 00:07:51.772]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:52.593]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:53.433]  Big Brother.
[00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:54.353]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.691]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:11.171]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:13.412]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:17.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.654 --> 00:08:21.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:38.742]  We are 8 minutes, 35 seconds into this first hour, into the second segment.
[00:08:38.782 --> 00:08:40.002]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:40.022 --> 00:08:42.083]  We'll be live for the next two hours, 51 minutes.
[00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:47.484]  Wide open telephones today, a mass of vital news and information.
[00:08:48.184 --> 00:08:54.825]  Rule change lets CIA freely send suspects abroad to jails, including American citizens.
[00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:58.906]  Now, Republican and Democrat appointed judges
[00:08:59.702 --> 00:09:06.943]  Federal judges have been saying, look, you can't ship people overseas to torture them without due process.
[00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:12.224]  And you've got to go ahead and charge Jose Padilla, you've had the guy for three years.
[00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:14.225]  And what does Bush do?
[00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:22.386]  He says, hey, I, again, am the Supreme Ruler, that's what Alberto Gonzalez has said, our new Attorney General.
[00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:27.787]  I'll do whatever I want, whenever I want, and so I'm going to expand it.
[00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:37.894]  Where the CIA independent, even really of the President, just under general orders, can grab you, disappear you, and take you to foreign gulags.
[00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:40.496]  This is the type of stuff.
[00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:50.604]  And the new Homeland Security head, Michael Chertoff, the 9-11 cover-up artist, intimately involved protecting bankrollers of these supposed hijackers.
[00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:52.246]  I mean, we can go on and on about this guy.
[00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:57.803]  He says the President is above the law and can do whatever he wants as well.
[00:09:58.283 --> 00:09:59.363]  This is really scary.
[00:10:00.063 --> 00:10:03.164]  This is really, really serious.
[00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:10.565]  I want to get into what's happening with the dollar and Warren Buffett's out there just attacking it savagely.
[00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:13.086]  And it's no surprise he supports Schwarzenegger.
[00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:17.787]  This un-American all across the board.
[00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:30.864]  I don't want to spend all day on this and I want to put a recording of my analysis that's coming up and I'd like one of our listeners to make a transcript of it.
[00:10:31.244 --> 00:10:38.851]  I'm also going to write a short bullet point refutation of the real facts
[00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:49.890]  and repudiation of Homeland Security Chief's first cousin, Benjamin Chertoff's vicious attack piece on myself and others at Popular Mechanics.
[00:10:50.190 --> 00:11:07.261]  I was too busy finishing 9-11, Rise of the Police State, in the last three weeks to write a rebuttal to it, and I finished the film last Wednesday night, actually Thursday morning, sent it off
[00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:10.697]  Thursday morning to have it mass-produced.
[00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:12.238]  It should be done here in a few days.
[00:11:12.258 --> 00:11:13.619]  We can start shipping these out to you.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.283]  You can already order it right now if you want to order a hard copy of it or go to PrisonPlanet.tv to watch it.
[00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:25.706]  And so we jumped in the car, the wife and kids, and we went down to Port Aransas.
[00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:28.387]  This little Texas coastline.
[00:11:29.328 --> 00:11:32.449]  Literally, just so I could sleep and spend time with the family.
[00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:33.170]  And that's what I did.
[00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.252]  And on Saturday night, I went to bed at 9 o'clock.
[00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:41.629]  And my wife, the kids went to sleep.
[00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:42.449]  They were tired.
[00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:44.570]  I went to sleep at 9 o'clock.
[00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:51.633]  And I woke up the next morning and I had about 10 phone messages on my cell phone.
[00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:52.893]  And I started listening to them.
[00:11:53.453 --> 00:11:54.874]  Hey, did you hear Art Bell?
[00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:56.735]  He had Benjamin Chertoff on.
[00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.816]  The guy attacks you multiple times each hour.
[00:12:00.516 --> 00:12:01.917]  And again, I have nothing against Art Bell.
[00:12:02.017 --> 00:12:03.778]  I go on coast-to-coast AM with George Norrie.
[00:12:03.798 --> 00:12:04.798]  I think George is great.
[00:12:05.178 --> 00:12:06.318]  George doesn't censor me.
[00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:07.479]  Let's me say whatever I want.
[00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:16.693]  I get to reach 14 million people an hour, 20 million hits to the website in a single night.
[00:12:17.634 --> 00:12:22.019]  Bill O'Reilly has 2 million people watching him an evening, and he's the number one show.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.983]  Does that give you an idea how big Coast to Coast AM is?
[00:12:25.183 --> 00:12:27.246]  It's the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:31.589]  Number one, biggest thing in the country is Rush Limbaugh.
[00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:32.269]  Period.
[00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:41.935]  Cable and TV is so broken up, so many channels, that it just... Folks, I've been on Good Morning America and plugged my website twice, and I get, you know, 40,000 hits.
[00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:45.417]  You go on George Norris' show, you get 20 million.
[00:12:46.538 --> 00:12:47.458]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:49.079]  It's awesome.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.101]  It's just amazing.
[00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.843]  And so, hey, it's Art Bell's right.
[00:12:55.855 --> 00:13:00.718]  To say that 9-11 wasn't an inside job and to say it's garbage if you say it.
[00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:01.999]  I disagree with that.
[00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:06.662]  Some people just can't face up to the full horror of what we're dealing with.
[00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:09.724]  George Norrie can.
[00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:13.046]  And George has had me on five times now.
[00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.867]  Three of the five, I went into 9-11.
[00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:18.169]  And he lets me go anywhere I want.
[00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:19.150]  It's just incredible.
[00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.191]  He's got amazing courage.
[00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:24.353]  So I don't want to start some fight here.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.881]  So I don't want a bunch of bashing, coast-to-coast AM.
[00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:38.424]  My beef is with Benjamin, first cousin, same next-door neighbors with Uncle Chertoff, the Homeland Security Director.
[00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.224]  And I have the news articles here in front of me.
[00:13:41.264 --> 00:13:43.865]  I heard this three weeks ago, now it's confirmed.
[00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:55.286]  We're talking about calling up Mr. Chertoff and he says no comment and you call up his mommy because he wasn't smart to call mommy and tell her to lie and mommy says of course!
[00:13:56.887 --> 00:13:58.887]  Uncle Chertoff comes over for dinner!
[00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:07.349]  Now my problem is with Benjamin Chertoff and Megs, the chief editor and the rest of them.
[00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:11.990]  Two weeks ago I issued challenges for them both to come on the air.
[00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.750]  Won't do it.
[00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.981]  I call their office over and over again.
[00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:17.302]  You've heard me on air.
[00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:21.505]  Tell my producers, both of them, hey, call these people again.
[00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:23.567]  And I said it two weeks ago.
[00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:32.814]  I said if they do not come on, I'm going to give their phone numbers out on air, you know, the general number at Popular Mechanics, and say, hey, you come on here and you defend your ideas.
[00:14:34.255 --> 00:14:42.422]  Well, I love how globalists operate, because that's exactly what Chertoff, Benjamin Chertoff of the Homeland Security family,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.621]  said about me.
[00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:55.583]  He gets up there on the show and says into his tirade against me, well Alex Jones needs to call in and defend himself and if he doesn't means he can't.
[00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:11.868]  And so the Homeland Security's 25 year old editor who did reporting in Iraq, I mean you talk about these Gannon characters and the rest of it, I smell a gigantic stinking rat folks
[00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.200]  I mean, you know thousands of reporters are on the payroll.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.722]  Well, there's something thicker than the payroll, and that's called blood.
[00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.704]  And so this thing had the classic signs of this all along.
[00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:29.547]  Mr. Jones, hours later, Mr. Jones is afraid to call in!
[00:15:29.587 --> 00:15:30.728]  He can't defend himself!
[00:15:30.988 --> 00:15:38.632]  Number one, folks, you try to call into one of those shows... I mean, I tried probably for five years to call into Rush Limbaugh.
[00:15:39.253 --> 00:15:40.093]  Always busy.
[00:15:40.153 --> 00:15:41.513]  Never even got through to a screener.
[00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:46.755]  You try to call into Coast to Coast AM, the lines are so overloaded, you don't even get a busy signal.
[00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:52.056]  In fact, last night, there I was at 1 AM, trying to call into Art Bell Show, and I gave the phone number out.
[00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:55.116]  It was so overloaded, it didn't even give me a busy signal.
[00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:57.337]  Thousands of people calling.
[00:15:57.737 --> 00:15:59.357]  Oh, Alex won't call in!
[00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:01.337]  He's afraid!
[00:16:02.738 --> 00:16:04.098]  So I tried to call in last night.
[00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:06.208]  Of course I couldn't call in.
[00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:12.292]  Contrary to popular belief, I don't have some back phone number where I call in and I get on the air.
[00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:12.572]  No.
[00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:17.936]  A producer sets you up for those shows, they call you up, put you on the air.
[00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:19.437]  That's how it works.
[00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:26.201]  So this is basically the type of garbage.
[00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:29.263]  I call Mr. Chertoff, Mr. Homeland Security.
[00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:32.563]  And I say, I want you on my show.
[00:16:33.103 --> 00:16:36.745]  I want to go over this point by point with you, and I want to show where you're wrong.
[00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:37.425]  He wouldn't do it.
[00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.067]  I go on NPR, and I say, is this 50-50 time?
[00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:42.148]  They go, yes, 50-50.
[00:16:42.608 --> 00:16:44.989]  He gets 15 minutes, I get 4 minutes.
[00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:48.071]  4 minutes with the host talking over me!
[00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:51.512]  They interviewed me for 30 minutes and cut it down to 4 minutes.
[00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:53.513]  I've since had a chance to listen to that interview.
[00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.115]  See, these people cannot win on a level playing field.
[00:16:58.195 --> 00:16:59.536]  I would clean the floor with them.
[00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:03.832]  But you know what?
[00:17:03.892 --> 00:17:06.114]  I've got more numbers in, major government studies.
[00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:09.538]  The newspapers have now lost half their circulation.
[00:17:09.798 --> 00:17:11.840]  TV news, people are leaving it in droves.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.942]  They're leaving television, period.
[00:17:13.982 --> 00:17:17.506]  Last year's numbers were upwards of 45% have left entirely.
[00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.608]  Now the new numbers are coming in, it's even worse.
[00:17:19.888 --> 00:17:22.731]  So just keep on, keep on doing what you're doing.
[00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:25.434]  You've already failed, you've already lost.
[00:17:27.492 --> 00:17:34.073]  There's nothing you can do to stop us, even if your bosses start nuking cities and blaming it on Al-Cieda.
[00:17:34.933 --> 00:17:35.654]  You're gonna fail.
[00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:38.694]  People know that you're full of garbage.
[00:17:38.834 --> 00:17:39.934]  They know you twist.
[00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:46.776]  Don't you know when you went on the air that 90% of people knew and just believed us even more when you did that?
[00:17:47.616 --> 00:17:50.156]  You just threw gasoline on your own funeral pyre.
[00:17:50.896 --> 00:17:53.457]  Figuratively, you know, the funeral pyre for your lies.
[00:17:57.307 --> 00:17:59.009]  Your lives are going up in smoke.
[00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.591]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:02.073]  I mean, I could sit here and refute them.
[00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:15.047]  I mean, one of the big things they do in the article is they say that we say that there were F-16 intercepts of errant aircraft hundreds of times before 9-11.
[00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:27.895]  And they quote this Major Douglas Martin, Public Affairs Officer for NORAD, as saying that there had only been one intercept in the decade before 9-11 of an errant jet aircraft or aircraft, and that was Payne Stewart.
[00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:32.276]  They have to admit that because, Payne Stewart, everybody knows about that.
[00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:35.997]  And then they say, oh, it took an hour and 22 minutes for the jets to get to them.
[00:18:36.477 --> 00:18:36.737]  No.
[00:18:37.497 --> 00:18:45.139]  They found out that the aircraft had depressurized and hadn't radioed back an hour and 22 minutes after it took off from Florida.
[00:18:46.605 --> 00:18:48.466]  I have the original USA Today articles.
[00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:50.026]  They're in my new film, by the way.
[00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:52.847]  So see how they play that little mind game?
[00:18:53.207 --> 00:18:54.487]  Oh, see, it took an hour and forty-two minutes.
[00:18:54.527 --> 00:18:54.687]  No.
[00:18:55.027 --> 00:19:00.869]  It took eighteen minutes for five F-16s to surround the aircraft after they got the launch order.
[00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:03.170]  Eighteen minutes!
[00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.031]  And they followed it for another two hours till it crashed in the Midwest.
[00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:11.209]  But guess what?
[00:19:11.289 --> 00:19:24.777]  We have Major Douglas Martin, Public Affairs Officer, from the Associated Press from two years ago, talking about 68 intercepts of aircraft in the year before 9-11.
[00:19:25.638 --> 00:19:27.279]  And hundreds in the decade before.
[00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:31.381]  But you don't have to go back to the very person they quote refuting that.
[00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.278]  You can talk to any pilot.
[00:19:34.538 --> 00:19:34.978]  Everybody.
[00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:42.243]  We've all heard over the years of a jet that got off course or some guy's in a Cessna flew over a military base and jets force him down.
[00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:45.325]  Just everybody knows that's not true.
[00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:47.827]  That's just one of the points.
[00:19:50.368 --> 00:19:53.370]  And of the 16, I'd say 10 of them are pure garbage.
[00:19:56.232 --> 00:19:58.213]  And Mr. Chertoff is also very dishonest.
[00:19:58.233 --> 00:19:59.274]  We'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:04.703]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:07.304]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:20:07.524 --> 00:20:14.666]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:20.228]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:25.110]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.911]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:20:28.112 --> 00:20:29.252]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:20:29.452 --> 00:20:39.037]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.

[00:21:00.362 --> 00:21:01.342]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:06.204]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:14.168]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.428 --> 00:21:19.790]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:26.993]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.293 --> 00:21:32.615]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:37.618]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:45.581]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:51.364]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.086]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.309 --> 00:21:56.709]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.829 --> 00:21:58.611]  Terrorism!
[00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.395]  Terrorism!
[00:22:01.495 --> 00:22:07.582]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:22:07.822 --> 00:22:09.424]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:22:09.644 --> 00:22:12.127]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:12.507 --> 00:22:27.055]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:27.396]  government.
[00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.437]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:29.797 --> 00:22:35.700]  It's presented by a housewife, as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.283]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:45.969]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:57.008 --> 00:23:58.389]  Excluding Maryland and New York.
[00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:15.762]  Alright, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:20.545]  I don't want to spend all day on Chertoff, the cousin, the next door neighbor,
[00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:30.972]  Good little New Yorkers of the Homeland Security Chief putting together this ham-fisted attack that they're counting on people not checking out against myself and others.
[00:24:32.793 --> 00:24:39.457]  I'm going to write a response to it and in the next hour I'm going to do about a ten minute dissertation on it.
[00:24:41.358 --> 00:24:45.540]  Try to limit it to ten minutes and make a transcript of it and put that out as well.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.022]  I'm sure you want to talk about it though because the guy was on one of the biggest radio shows in the country.
[00:24:51.539 --> 00:25:19.473]  for over three hours savaging myself and others and uh... again it's it's it's people like Chertoff count on you not checking out the facts this is the same government that says one person killed Kennedy ninety percent of you don't believe that now major polls this is the same government that says they don't ship heroin and cocaine in no matter how many times they've been caught red-handed doing it or no matter how many government agents we have on
[00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:24.294]  This is the same government that said they never had any prior knowledge of 9-11, now it's been all over the news they did.
[00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:29.237]  The same government that says that, you know, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:25:30.157 --> 00:25:30.978]  And shook their finger.
[00:25:31.038 --> 00:25:37.282]  The same government that said, there's weapons of mass destruction, and then said we never said there were weapons of mass destruction, it's an urban legend.
[00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.923]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:45.187]  And they build up straw men, fake debates, fake arguments, that knock it down.
[00:25:46.648 --> 00:25:48.569]  And it's just so incredibly shoddy.
[00:25:50.091 --> 00:26:02.979]  So later, I'm going to give the phone number out to Popular Mechanics, and I have the actual magazine but left it at the house, and I want to give the main number out to Hearst Publishing, known for its yellow journalism, known for its political manipulations.
[00:26:03.259 --> 00:26:15.467]  I mean, literally, Hearst was the pioneer in having, basically working for the government, and having his people on the payroll, government agents on the payroll.
[00:26:16.768 --> 00:26:18.348]  So this should really be no surprise.
[00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.351]  We'll be going over that as well.
[00:26:23.752 --> 00:26:26.853]  Really, if we're going to talk about this, we should just talk about the truth of 9-11.
[00:26:27.934 --> 00:26:31.936]  Nowhere in the article does it mention public officials warned not to fly, admitted.
[00:26:32.616 --> 00:26:34.797]  Nowhere does it mention CIA insider trading.
[00:26:35.297 --> 00:26:38.239]  Nowhere does it mention the NORAD drills that morning.
[00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:43.401]  Nowhere does it mention Bin Laden being on CIA payroll, because they can't discredit that.
[00:26:44.634 --> 00:26:48.955]  They can just argue things that can't be proven one way or the other, like, did a plane hit the Pentagon?
[00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:50.756]  Or, was there a pod on the belly?
[00:26:51.256 --> 00:26:58.738]  I've never, you know, I've always said, folks, I leave those things alone, because you can't prove it one way or the other.
[00:26:59.058 --> 00:27:00.898]  I think debating it, discussing it's fine.
[00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:02.219]  I've had guests on the show talk about it.
[00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:09.901]  I predominantly stick to bombs in the buildings, and public officials worn out the fly, and the drills, and the stand down, and all that is admitted!
[00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.441]  And they attack all that, too!
[00:27:12.575 --> 00:27:14.196]  Except for public officials and stuff like that.
[00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:21.419]  How are they going to argue with MSNBC and Associated Press and San Francisco Chronicle and Times of London?
[00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:21.900]  They can't.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.762]  But they were going to do all that, but every time I sent them information, they would just ignore it and move on.
[00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:39.408]  And Mr. Chertoff told me, he said, the nephew, or the cousin of Homeland Security Chief, he told me, they call him Uncle Chertoff, what the family says, he's actually a first cousin,
[00:27:41.508 --> 00:27:42.649]  Of the Homeland Security Chief.
[00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.253]  He told me, oh no, Mr. Jones, I promise this is not a hit piece.
[00:27:47.793 --> 00:27:52.096]  We're just looking at these prominent theories and talking about them.
[00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:54.558]  I said, you promise it isn't?
[00:27:55.019 --> 00:27:56.140]  Oh, I promise it isn't.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.601]  Then I talked to his boss.
[00:27:58.361 --> 00:27:59.682]  Oh, we promise it isn't.
[00:27:59.722 --> 00:28:00.743]  We promise it isn't.
[00:28:02.424 --> 00:28:07.268]  And I had never, after being interviewed by hundreds of publications over the years, never thought it was fake.
[00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:10.431]  This was so bad, so amateurish.
[00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:14.983]  That I called up and got a hold of the editor and I said, is this real?
[00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:18.064]  These people work for you?
[00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:18.984]  And they said, yes they do.
[00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:26.848]  And I wondered, and I'm not knocking young people, I'm young folks, I'm 31 years old, I've been doing this since I was, you know, 20 years old.
[00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:34.211]  But I wonder why it was 20 year olds and 22 year olds and the editor over this, 25, Chertoff.
[00:28:35.511 --> 00:28:37.492]  And they were bumbling idiots.
[00:28:38.413 --> 00:28:38.613]  I mean,
[00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:44.451]  I was just... They literally were just gibbering fools.
[00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:46.491]  When I would talk to them, I'd send them news articles.
[00:28:47.052 --> 00:28:49.412]  And they sounded like 15 year olds.
[00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.913]  Well, yeah, dude, what about this?
[00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:53.414]  What about this one?
[00:28:53.854 --> 00:28:55.355]  Just start clicking, give it to me.
[00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:57.295]  I'm sorry, my phone's not working.
[00:28:57.856 --> 00:28:58.636]  Get to a quarter.
[00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:00.357]  Can you call me right back?
[00:29:00.417 --> 00:29:04.058]  I mean, they just sounded... And that's why we're going to beat these people.
[00:29:04.078 --> 00:29:06.139]  They're a bunch of low-grade morons.
[00:29:06.972 --> 00:29:11.055]  And people don't have any trust or credibility in them now, and we're winning!
[00:29:11.135 --> 00:29:12.736]  So you've lost, and end of story!
[00:29:12.796 --> 00:29:13.557]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:29:14.217 --> 00:29:15.698]  I mean, it's just over for you people.
[00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:18.080]  It's over!
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:29.227]  They've got this blog now that they've put up there, on the Popular Mechanics website, and they say, oh, we've been getting lots of negative comments, but then they only post the positive ones.
[00:29:30.328 --> 00:29:34.891]  So go email them, go write a comment, and then see if they post it.
[00:29:36.468 --> 00:29:37.748]  But again, I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:29:37.788 --> 00:29:39.049]  I want to take your calls when we get back.
[00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:43.370]  I've got torture news, police state news, news on the economy.
[00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.270]  There's so much.
[00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:50.592]  I've got to shut up myself and just wait later and kind of cogently, calmly go over all the facts.
[00:29:51.653 --> 00:29:52.573]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:54.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.554 --> 00:29:58.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.568 --> 00:30:03.929]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.012]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:08.332 --> 00:30:09.153]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.593 --> 00:30:13.695]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:13.935 --> 00:30:18.118]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.498 --> 00:30:23.361]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:27.343]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.524 --> 00:30:32.867]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.127 --> 00:30:35.869]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:37.070]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:48.097]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:30:48.457 --> 00:30:49.879]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:50.920]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit Cal-BenPureSoap.com.
[00:31:00.928 --> 00:31:08.433]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.713 --> 00:31:19.641]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:21.704]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:31:21.984 --> 00:31:25.308]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:36.083]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:36.383 --> 00:31:36.883]  That's right!
[00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:44.185]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:48.587]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:48.747 --> 00:31:53.208]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.268 --> 00:31:53.728]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:08.944]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:13.589]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:20.876]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.236 --> 00:32:27.362]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.502 --> 00:32:28.703]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.043 --> 00:32:31.987]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:32.147 --> 00:32:34.169]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:41.718]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:45.383]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:32:45.823 --> 00:32:48.964]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:48.984 --> 00:32:49.064]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.084 --> 00:32:49.165]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.305 --> 00:32:50.225]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.245 --> 00:32:50.525]  Call today.
[00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:53.386]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:32:53.566 --> 00:32:55.187]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:16.856]  Waging war on corruption Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm Central Standard Time.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.682]  And back from 9 to Midnight Central, getting more and more affiliates every week now.
[00:33:22.282 --> 00:33:27.984]  The truth is shining through no matter how radical, or painful, or bizarre the information we cover sounds.
[00:33:28.385 --> 00:33:33.247]  We back it up predominantly from government documents, legislation, and mainstream news.
[00:33:33.647 --> 00:33:35.468]  The news that falls between the cracks.
[00:33:35.908 --> 00:33:38.509]  No American can deny that we're losing our freedoms.
[00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:43.111]  But the hair on the back of your neck is standing up, that you know things aren't right with the world.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:53.525]  And we're here telling the truth, and I salute our affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners, our callers, the great folks that run the broadcast, the Genesis Network.
[00:33:54.145 --> 00:33:58.727]  We're standing up for freedom and the First Amendment, and just God bless you.
[00:33:59.087 --> 00:34:00.408]  I'm honored to be your host.
[00:34:01.028 --> 00:34:08.992]  I am blessed to be here, and with great power comes great responsibility, as they say in that recent popular Hollywood film.
[00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:13.809]  I want to go to Ralph, Sean, John, Keith, Frank and others.
[00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:14.970]  We will momentarily.
[00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:21.113]  And then into some other important news and I'll get back into the Popular Mechanics full tilt boogie hit piece.
[00:34:21.553 --> 00:34:30.438]  I've been attacked lately by Vanity Fair and the American Legion and Washington Post and I don't know a score of other major publications and that's good.
[00:34:31.299 --> 00:34:32.199]  It means we're hurting.
[00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:38.643]  It means we're going in and engaging this death star of lies at point blank range.
[00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:51.003]  And having an effect, leveling their propaganda, blasting giant holes in the dam, in the electronic Berlin Wall that they've built.
[00:34:52.644 --> 00:35:00.285]  And the more they try to patch, the more they try to abscond, the more people begin to look and become suspicious.
[00:35:00.925 --> 00:35:04.846]  And then they check out what I say, then they check out what you say, and they find out
[00:35:05.805 --> 00:35:12.090]  They find out that you're a pack of pirates, and they find out what you're really doing, and you lose all credibility.
[00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:25.181]  Now, I'm about to go to your calls, but I just want to tell all the listeners right now, if you want to counter the globalists, if you want to have an effect against them, then you need to join me on the front lines of the information war.
[00:35:25.962 --> 00:35:32.047]  You need to go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and go to the secure online shopping cart right now.
[00:35:33.095 --> 00:35:35.718]  You need to purchase my new film, 9-11.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.321]  The Rise of the Police State.
[00:35:39.622 --> 00:35:41.964]  Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[00:35:42.485 --> 00:35:44.707]  You need to get this munition in your hands.
[00:35:45.368 --> 00:35:49.312]  You need to force multiply this information warfare weapon.
[00:35:49.812 --> 00:35:55.258]  This techno cure to the virus that is the New World Order.
[00:35:56.175 --> 00:35:58.016]  It is totally documented.
[00:35:58.436 --> 00:36:01.338]  Professionally produced at a higher level than I've ever done.
[00:36:01.358 --> 00:36:04.039]  It is explosive in the info war.
[00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:05.740]  You need to get this munition.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.300]  Replicate this munition.
[00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:09.601]  Replicate as many as you can.
[00:36:10.002 --> 00:36:14.784]  And begin passing it into the Matrix Control Grid and having others replicate.
[00:36:15.444 --> 00:36:16.625]  You've got to get this weapon.
[00:36:17.005 --> 00:36:18.506]  You've got to replicate this weapon.
[00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:21.727]  You've got to tell others to replicate this weapon immediately.
[00:36:22.368 --> 00:36:23.148]  Immediately.
[00:36:24.395 --> 00:36:26.197]  It's coming out in a month on DVD.
[00:36:26.297 --> 00:36:32.324]  It takes time to send it off, have it authored, then proof the master, because these aren't just burned, these are stamped.
[00:36:32.764 --> 00:36:33.605]  Professional grade.
[00:36:33.965 --> 00:36:37.209]  Then I've got to get it shipped back to me, got to watch it, got to send it back.
[00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:42.615]  That's why we're releasing it on VHS first, two hours, thirty-five minutes.
[00:36:43.775 --> 00:36:45.115]  This cannot wait, folks.
[00:36:45.135 --> 00:36:49.836]  They're having all these Al-Qaeda alerts, and the terrorists are going to hit you, we're going to have martial law.
[00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:52.737]  After it happens, we've got to have this film out there.
[00:36:52.817 --> 00:36:56.758]  It really, Road to Tyranny, really caused a massive shift in this country.
[00:36:57.098 --> 00:36:59.358]  I was the first person to release a 9-11 film.
[00:36:59.378 --> 00:37:02.359]  9-11, the emergency release, three weeks after 9-11.
[00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:07.900]  I just offered it for two months until Road to Tyranny was completed.
[00:37:08.633 --> 00:37:12.816]  I released 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, still the preeminent work on 9-11 until now.
[00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:19.721]  Now I have released five, almost six months in the making, my ultimate crowning achievement.
[00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:23.043]  Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:37:23.123 --> 00:37:25.325]  I'm telling you, you've got to get this video.
[00:37:25.345 --> 00:37:26.526]  It's three films in one.
[00:37:26.926 --> 00:37:31.329]  We show you the police state in New York, the secret police, reporters being arrested.
[00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:32.730]  That's just the first 30 minutes.
[00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:34.671]  Then we spend over an hour on 9-11.
[00:37:36.698 --> 00:37:45.364]  And the latest infos, just in rapid fire, laying it out.
[00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:56.611]  And then we spend an hour on who the globalists are, their ideology, the Skull and Bones, the Bohemian Grove, how Arnold's connected, how it's connected to the Nazis, the Bushes and the Nazis.
[00:37:57.032 --> 00:37:58.753]  Then we go to the Library of Congress.
[00:37:59.674 --> 00:38:00.775]  Show you the documents.
[00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:02.096]  It's all in there.
[00:38:02.136 --> 00:38:04.317]  This thing gives you the master plan.
[00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:06.278]  So we show you the police state in America.
[00:38:06.338 --> 00:38:07.159]  Show you 9-11.
[00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:08.520]  Show you who was behind it.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.521]  And then show you why they're so evil.
[00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:13.443]  It is unlike any other 9-11 film you've ever seen.
[00:38:13.883 --> 00:38:17.806]  PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com to order via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:19.146]  Order your hard copy.
[00:38:21.228 --> 00:38:22.989]  We should be shipping these out by the end of the week.

[00:38:31.456 --> 00:38:34.096]  Watch that film, all my other films, books, videos.
[00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:35.216]  It's ridiculous.
[00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:38.217]  My weekly TV reports, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:38:39.497 --> 00:38:45.659]  I got a bunch of calls from people going, you know, your videos have already been put all over the internet.
[00:38:45.959 --> 00:38:53.240]  And you know, one side of me says, man, if we don't sell enough memberships, if I don't sell enough copies of this, I can't make another film.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.701]  This film cost me $25,000 to make.
[00:38:57.529 --> 00:39:04.292]  But the other side, I mean, the side that is dominant, you know, in this moral fight, I just say, so what?
[00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:04.612]  Good.
[00:39:07.233 --> 00:39:14.016]  I mean, you know, we have to charge something if we're going to stream it, because I can't pay $5,000, $6,000 a month bandwidth bills without you helping.
[00:39:15.457 --> 00:39:21.700]  But PrisonPlanet.tv, if you want to support us, and here I am telling you that the video is already out there on the web,
[00:39:22.892 --> 00:39:29.442]  But I would hope that you'd go and pay $4.95 for a monthly subscription and watch it so you can see more.

[00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.430]  888-253-3139.
[00:39:59.008 --> 00:40:05.434]  Or simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.698]  It really is up to you folks.
[00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:14.703]  You can get the video, you can make 10 copies, give it to others, tell them to make 10 copies.
[00:40:16.365 --> 00:40:22.471]  And I call Senators up, I call Congressmen up, you know, we find out Hunter S. Thompson was waking up to 9-11 through my videos.
[00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:27.773]  I call state reps up who were throwing the Patriot Act out in their states.
[00:40:27.933 --> 00:40:30.374]  Oh, I'm doing this because you're filming Police State 3.
[00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:33.355]  It's having a massive effect.
[00:40:34.356 --> 00:40:37.817]  I find out members of the British Parliament woke up from road to tyranny.
[00:40:38.337 --> 00:40:39.518]  This is what you did!
[00:40:40.123 --> 00:40:42.566]  You know, I build the sea with God's help.
[00:40:42.746 --> 00:40:46.209]  I build the nexus of the info weapons.
[00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:47.611]  I mean, these are weapons, people.
[00:40:47.871 --> 00:40:54.398]  These are highly destructive to the New World Order, highly creative and proactive to us.
[00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:57.317]  And I mean literally, folks.
[00:40:57.357 --> 00:40:58.537]  They are scared to death.
[00:40:58.557 --> 00:41:00.898]  They are attacking me left and right right now.
[00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:03.440]  I pray to God that he gives me more time.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.401]  I hope they don't kill me soon.
[00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:06.561]  I'm going to be frank with you.
[00:41:07.161 --> 00:41:08.522]  I hope God gives me more time.
[00:41:08.582 --> 00:41:14.165]  I pray God gives me more time to be a vessel that I'm telling you, folks,
[00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:22.621]  That if you get the seeds, buy the seeds, and be Johnny Appleseeds out there, we can bring them to their knees.
[00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:23.322]  I'm telling you.
[00:41:23.782 --> 00:41:32.569]  And I've put my life on the line to do this, and I know it's worth it, and I'm pleased, and it's really an honor and a pleasure to be at the tip of the spear in many respects.
[00:41:32.969 --> 00:41:43.037]  So please, please defend your family, defend this country, get the truth about the New World Order out, and you know, help make my life mean something too at the same time.
[00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:53.857]  That's all that matters to me, is that I'll leave a better place for my children and my family, and for my children and my family to live in a better place, your children have got to live in a good place.
[00:41:54.398 --> 00:42:00.403]  You know, this whole yuppie idea of look out for number one, that's how you get ahead, that's a fraud, folks.
[00:42:00.904 --> 00:42:04.407]  Self-sacrifice, dedication, that's how you get ahead.
[00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:08.591]  When everybody has that attitude, you have milk and honey in the streets, you have plenty,
[00:42:09.747 --> 00:42:15.991]  You have creativity and the dynamic human spirit that God has energized us with.
[00:42:17.332 --> 00:42:18.953]  That's what builds societies.
[00:42:18.993 --> 00:42:20.654]  That's what builds prosperity.
[00:42:20.774 --> 00:42:23.076]  And then we always get prosperous when we have freedom.
[00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:24.296]  Then we get decadent.
[00:42:24.316 --> 00:42:25.057]  Then we get corrupt.
[00:42:25.077 --> 00:42:25.817]  Then we get evil.
[00:42:26.137 --> 00:42:31.441]  And we're entering the bottom pendulum swing into the depths of tyranny right now.
[00:42:32.282 --> 00:42:35.803]  But at the same time, for every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[00:42:36.103 --> 00:42:38.664]  There is a massive resistance to this.
[00:42:38.804 --> 00:42:41.425]  And believe me, you can't count on others to do it.
[00:42:41.546 --> 00:42:43.846]  You've got to be part of this.
[00:42:45.047 --> 00:42:51.409]  All the beauty, all the love, all the things that are wonderful in life are threatened by the globalists.
[00:42:51.449 --> 00:42:52.209]  They hate life.
[00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.390]  They hate beauty.
[00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.710]  They hate happiness.
[00:42:54.991 --> 00:42:56.511]  They hate you and your family.
[00:42:56.771 --> 00:42:58.232]  They want you to be their slaves.
[00:42:58.472 --> 00:43:00.092]  Your freedom threatens them.
[00:43:00.473 --> 00:43:01.533]  They are psychopaths!
[00:43:02.754 --> 00:43:07.858]  And unless you have the courage to face the truth and take action, they're going to win.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.801]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:13.183]  So call right now and get the films.
[00:43:13.203 --> 00:43:15.165]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:43:15.185 --> 00:43:17.787]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:20.849]  Uh, Ralph in Texas.
[00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.711]  Ralph, you're on the air first caller.
[00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:24.452]  I'm going quick to your call, so go ahead.
[00:43:26.294 --> 00:43:27.235]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:43:27.415 --> 00:43:27.675]  Good, sir.
[00:43:27.695 --> 00:43:29.196]  I'm going to give each caller about 60 seconds.
[00:43:29.216 --> 00:43:29.737]  What's on your mind?
[00:43:30.328 --> 00:43:32.090]  Okay, what's on my mind?
[00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:43.999]  I think more and more this nation is definitely speaking more like a dragon and of course it points out in Revelation it's the second feast and gives us part of the first feast.
[00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:50.845]  That's what's going on and I love what you're doing Alex and I do pray for you all the time because you're giving the truth out.
[00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.947]  Only the truth of the news.
[00:43:53.027 --> 00:43:54.388]  The truth of news.
[00:43:55.168 --> 00:43:58.111]  And of course we know the First Amendment is being challenged more and more.
[00:43:58.615 --> 00:44:03.959]  There's a lady that wrote in the 1800s that all liberty would be denied.
[00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:06.301]  Our liberty of conscience would be denied.
[00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:12.566]  And when that takes place, the Christian people of the world need to get ready for what's to come.
[00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:16.409]  Because there's going to be the great persecution we'll hit after the disasters hit.
[00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:18.231]  After these scumbags of the earth.
[00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:20.913]  And so many Christians think that you just cop out.
[00:44:20.993 --> 00:44:23.115]  No, we have a job.
[00:44:23.395 --> 00:44:24.095]  We have a job.
[00:44:24.115 --> 00:44:24.716]  Let me just finish.
[00:44:24.936 --> 00:44:26.557]  We have a job to warn people.
[00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:29.885]  Anything else, Ralph?
[00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:31.526]  Warrant with long-suffering.
[00:44:31.546 --> 00:44:33.547]  That's about it right now.
[00:44:33.628 --> 00:44:39.191]  I mean, I would like to get your personal number because I have some other important business to discuss with you.
[00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:42.112]  Unfortunately, sir, I'm literally working around the clock.
[00:44:42.132 --> 00:44:42.732]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:42.752 --> 00:44:43.633]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:43.653 --> 00:44:45.214]  I hardly have time to go see my grandmother.
[00:44:45.954 --> 00:44:46.915]  Sean in Alabama.
[00:44:46.955 --> 00:44:47.655]  Sean, go ahead.
[00:44:47.675 --> 00:44:48.235]  You're on the air.
[00:44:48.576 --> 00:44:49.336]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:50.757]  It's a pleasure to be speaking with you.
[00:44:50.837 --> 00:44:51.557]  Good to talk to you.
[00:44:52.358 --> 00:44:54.179]  I don't want to waste any time on Chertoff.
[00:44:54.479 --> 00:44:55.980]  His hit piece was laughable.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.761]  I want to talk about martial law 9-1-1.
[00:45:00.006 --> 00:45:05.229]  I've watched all your movies, Alex, and without a doubt, this is your masterpiece.
[00:45:07.511 --> 00:45:12.013]  I showed it to my mother for the longest time now.
[00:45:12.113 --> 00:45:16.416]  She's been telling me, oh, you're listening to these kooks and this stuff is crazy.
[00:45:16.436 --> 00:45:24.941]  I showed her Martial Law 9-1-1 and it has silenced her opposition to my looking into the New World Order once and for all.
[00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:28.463]  The proof that you present to anyone
[00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:33.024]  Who has any love of the truth for them in them is undeniable.
[00:45:33.924 --> 00:45:50.696]  And for those of us, for those listening who don't think we're having an effect, that your movies aren't having an effect, I want to remind them that President Bush himself had to stand in front of the whole world and tell us not to listen to crazy conspiracy theories.
[00:45:51.317 --> 00:45:52.658]  Because it is having an effect.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:02.386]  And, uh, so I get from what you're saying, and it's very encouraging, Sean, that this info bomb blew her blinders off.
[00:46:03.287 --> 00:46:03.987]  Yes, it did.
[00:46:04.147 --> 00:46:06.329]  It, it literally, it dumbfounded her.
[00:46:06.509 --> 00:46:17.839]  She watched it, and you back up, uh, your claims with documented evidence that cannot be... Every word was three mainstream news articles with the subtext blown up.
[00:46:18.619 --> 00:46:19.220]  Exactly.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:23.003]  And I showed her where she, you know, in case she wanted to try this, uh,
[00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:28.148]  Mental Dodge, maybe perhaps you're making up this documentation.
[00:46:28.168 --> 00:46:40.054]  I went to the web and I pulled up article after article that you have in your documentaries to show her, yes indeed, these things are documented and in the open and that you're being lied to.
[00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:43.796]  And like I said, her opposition just melted away.
[00:46:45.097 --> 00:46:47.038]  So now, I mean, what attitude does she have now?
[00:46:48.058 --> 00:46:53.021]  The attitude she has, you know, you have to understand at her age it's a little bit
[00:46:54.227 --> 00:46:57.529]  It's disconcerting to have your entire worldview turned on its ear.
[00:46:57.589 --> 00:47:04.693]  It's kind of like Neo in the Matrix when he finds out the truth and he just throws up because it's so shocking.
[00:47:05.793 --> 00:47:08.895]  But she's starting to get it.
[00:47:09.535 --> 00:47:15.038]  And the key thing is that she's not denying it and calling it crazy conspiracy theories anymore.
[00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:21.222]  Well, you need to explain to her that just because she knows the truth now doesn't mean that it wasn't there before.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.260]  Exactly.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.321]  You see, people live inside their minds like, oh, I know about this now.
[00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:26.061]  Now it's real.
[00:47:26.381 --> 00:47:26.881]  No, folks.
[00:47:27.602 --> 00:47:28.922]  The world is outside of us.
[00:47:29.242 --> 00:47:30.562]  People are so self-centered.
[00:47:31.383 --> 00:47:32.483]  It was still there.
[00:47:32.543 --> 00:47:33.583]  It was always there.
[00:47:34.183 --> 00:47:35.524]  Now you just know it was there.
[00:47:35.824 --> 00:47:36.724]  God bless you, Sean.
[00:47:36.744 --> 00:47:37.764]  Thanks for that testimony.
[00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:40.945]  John and Matt, you're on the air.
[00:47:40.985 --> 00:47:41.425]  Go ahead.
[00:47:42.285 --> 00:47:42.666]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:42.686 --> 00:47:43.446]  How are you doing today?
[00:47:43.746 --> 00:47:44.066]  Good, sir.
[00:47:44.813 --> 00:47:45.073]  Great.
[00:47:45.233 --> 00:47:47.214]  I just wanted to make a couple of comments.
[00:47:47.334 --> 00:47:52.036]  I got to watch your new documentary over the weekend, and it was excellent.
[00:47:52.437 --> 00:47:52.937]  Thank you.
[00:47:53.777 --> 00:47:57.719]  And I've been waking people up as much as I can with your videos.
[00:47:57.919 --> 00:48:06.863]  I have people putting your bumper stickers on their cars, driving around, whether it's realtors or salespeople, so a lot of people are starting to see that, at least in my neck of the woods.
[00:48:07.263 --> 00:48:07.904]  God bless you!
[00:48:09.064 --> 00:48:10.705]  Anything can wake people up at this point.
[00:48:11.611 --> 00:48:14.553]  And I just have a quick comment.
[00:48:14.573 --> 00:48:16.634]  I used to work in a hospital.
[00:48:16.654 --> 00:48:17.974]  I'm a former hospital worker.
[00:48:19.075 --> 00:48:25.638]  And just the amount of things that have been happening up here lately with the illegal aliens coming in and over flooding our hospitals.
[00:48:25.658 --> 00:48:38.745]  Some of my family still works in a hospital and there are gang members now coming into the hospitals in some of the health centers that we have up here.
[00:48:40.407 --> 00:48:44.768]  Gang members are actually sent there to expose themselves in the waiting rooms.
[00:48:46.008 --> 00:48:54.370]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but we're having a real problem with a lot of illegal aliens doing this up here now.
[00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:57.091]  Well, I know this.
[00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:00.492]  When I cut my finger off, it was flapping around on a piece of skin.
[00:49:02.052 --> 00:49:05.653]  Last year, I guess a year and a half ago now, I went to the emergency room and
[00:49:06.548 --> 00:49:13.771]  I watched the illegal aliens go right in, and I watched Hispanics, blacks, whites, it didn't matter, have to sit there, and that's because they have a rule.
[00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:18.412]  They have to make sure a citizen has insurance, but the illegals go right to the head of the line.
[00:49:18.452 --> 00:49:21.053]  I'm sitting there with my finger literally flopping around.
[00:49:21.093 --> 00:49:22.674]  I'm going, I need to get this reconnected.
[00:49:22.694 --> 00:49:25.075]  I mean, my finger's still numb, folks.
[00:49:25.735 --> 00:49:28.776]  I need to get this reconnected or I'm going to lose feeling in it.
[00:49:29.816 --> 00:49:33.678]  And, uh, it's just, it's insane.
[00:49:33.798 --> 00:49:34.678]  I've seen it myself.
[00:49:35.535 --> 00:49:48.025]  Well, and another thing that we have up here in New York is, I know in Texas, I used to live in Austin, the majority of people there that come in that are, say, an illegal alien, they speak Spanish.
[00:49:48.866 --> 00:49:58.574]  Up here, hospital signs are posted in a minimum of five different languages, whether it's Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese,
[00:49:59.931 --> 00:50:02.593]  We have such an influx from all over the world now.
[00:50:03.114 --> 00:50:06.677]  Hey, it's only going to get worse with the chair tops of the world in control.
[00:50:07.517 --> 00:50:08.798]  Well, we're not going to let them take over.
[00:50:08.818 --> 00:50:09.759]  That's all we've got to do.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.461]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:13.782]  It's part of the globalist plan.
[00:50:14.403 --> 00:50:17.425]  The majority of Hispanics are against it in major polls.
[00:50:17.445 --> 00:50:20.267]  We always talk about Hispanics because that's the majority in Latin America.
[00:50:20.888 --> 00:50:24.090]  But it's Chinese, Russians, I mean Africans, you name it.
[00:50:28.556 --> 00:50:31.437]  What is it, like 67% of Hispanics are against it?
[00:50:31.457 --> 00:50:33.517]  80 plus percent of the general public?
[00:50:33.998 --> 00:50:37.158]  But the media still goes, oh Hispanics are for it, it's a racial issue.
[00:50:37.438 --> 00:50:38.079]  No it's not!
[00:50:38.699 --> 00:50:45.040]  You bring in tens of millions of people that will work for nothing and are another culture, it balkanizes the country.
[00:50:46.021 --> 00:50:49.282]  We can't absorb... There's 30 million illegals right now.
[00:50:50.962 --> 00:50:52.943]  We're talking about another 30 million in the next 10 years.
[00:50:53.043 --> 00:50:54.363]  We cannot absorb it.
[00:50:55.503 --> 00:50:57.724]  They're building these NAFTA highways to bring them all in here?
[00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.152]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.813 --> 00:51:07.094]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:13.038]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.318 --> 00:51:18.582]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:20.483]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:51:20.623 --> 00:51:23.024]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.184 --> 00:51:26.965]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.225 --> 00:51:31.867]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:31.947 --> 00:51:38.209]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.249 --> 00:51:40.070]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:52:01.132 --> 00:52:03.113]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:52:03.193 --> 00:52:13.899]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.802]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.862 --> 00:52:30.189]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:37.634]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[00:54:05.968 --> 00:54:07.869]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:11.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.933 --> 00:54:18.856]  Alright, Keith, Frank, Carl, Charles, Bart, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:54:18.876 --> 00:54:20.257]  Let's continue to roll with them.
[00:54:20.277 --> 00:54:27.581]  I'm just going to give, again, each caller just a few minutes because I've got a bunch of other news I want to cover and I'm going to respond to this Popular Mechanics hit piece.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.903]  Alex, as we were talking off the air, I don't want to turn this into a match with Art Bell myself.
[00:54:54.296 --> 00:54:58.440]  I would put my facts up against any facts that were presented in Poplar Mechanic.
[00:54:59.661 --> 00:55:03.344]  I've offered Art Bell and George Nouri several chances to be on their show.
[00:55:03.404 --> 00:55:04.926]  They never even responded back.
[00:55:05.646 --> 00:55:07.988]  But what you were saying earlier is absolutely true.
[00:55:08.389 --> 00:55:10.470]  These people have controlled the story.
[00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:12.092]  They've controlled the mythology.
[00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.552]  And now they're getting extremely nervous.
[00:55:15.432 --> 00:55:17.834]  Please don't lump Nori on with that.
[00:55:18.074 --> 00:55:18.754]  He's very busy.
[00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:22.456]  He's had me on five times, lets me talk about whatever I want.
[00:55:22.516 --> 00:55:24.957]  And look, Bell has a right to say he doesn't believe it.
[00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:25.918]  That's his right.
[00:55:27.218 --> 00:55:30.520]  I'm talking about the Homeland Security Chief's cousin.
[00:55:31.281 --> 00:55:39.785]  I'm talking about Benjamin Chertoff challenging me that night, saying I was afraid to call in when I was asleep.
[00:55:39.825 --> 00:55:41.026]  I didn't even know that was going on.
[00:55:42.771 --> 00:55:44.711]  I mean, I'm seeing the same thing.
[00:55:44.771 --> 00:55:52.213]  They try to take it and they twist it, and they're getting very nervous, Alex, about the fact that not all of us fell for their mythology.
[00:55:52.913 --> 00:55:58.194]  And some of us have stayed on the trail to where it is getting very hard for them to keep covering this up.
[00:55:58.234 --> 00:56:00.495]  Yeah, it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:56:00.515 --> 00:56:03.716]  It's the biggest thing on the net now, next to pornography.
[00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:05.276]  It's pornography and then exposing 9-11.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:13.909]  Well, one of my people called me just before I got on the air with you and said, I just googled your name on the internet, 1.35 million hits.
[00:56:13.969 --> 00:56:15.831]  You know, people are paying attention.
[00:56:16.892 --> 00:56:21.117]  They are coming back, they are looking at it, they're thinking it through, and they're saying, you know what?
[00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:23.890]  Everything that's coming out of Washington D.C.
[00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:24.711]  has been a lie.
[00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:25.971]  Now, how do we prove it?
[00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:26.992]  What do we do about it?
[00:56:27.212 --> 00:56:34.075]  People know we have fake reporters, folks, like Mr. Gannon, you know, the male prostitute.
[00:56:34.636 --> 00:56:45.361]  This weekend, I actually watched television, there was on TV, you know, this male madam who does porn is a White House employee, folks.
[00:56:45.381 --> 00:56:46.702]  He wasn't a fake reporter.
[00:56:46.962 --> 00:56:49.083]  He was paid by the White House.
[00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:50.824]  That's what the media is ignoring.
[00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:53.775]  I mean, so how many more of these reporters are fake?
[00:56:55.076 --> 00:57:04.742]  I'm not sure, but I'm hearing from very reliable sources that there's a good chance that Gannon is actually Johnny Ghost, which goes all the way back to the Franklin scandal out of Omaha.
[00:57:06.203 --> 00:57:12.327]  And, you know, when you start seeing trails like that popping up, you know, they may have put Gannon in there just to embarrass this administration.
[00:57:12.507 --> 00:57:17.710]  You know, get them focused on something else like their own butt, instead of trying to figure out how to plunder the rest of it.
[00:57:18.513 --> 00:57:20.113]  I mean, that's where I drew the line, Alex.
[00:57:20.173 --> 00:57:23.074]  I mean, I came right off Wall Street.
[00:57:24.114 --> 00:57:28.836]  I've got a lot of knowledge about who is doing this to America, how they're doing this to America.
[00:57:29.416 --> 00:57:36.898]  And what you're seeing here, you're seeing policies that are being devised and implemented so we don't pay attention to what they're really doing.
[00:57:36.918 --> 00:57:41.279]  Well, how obvious is it when the cousin, you know, right there in the same neighborhood,
[00:57:42.383 --> 00:57:50.125]  First, he says no comment about the Homeland Security Chief, who they call, reportedly, Uncle Chertoff.
[00:57:50.605 --> 00:57:50.905]  Yeah.
[00:57:51.465 --> 00:57:55.466]  I mean, imagine, we've got the guy's cousin writing hit pieces.
[00:57:56.006 --> 00:57:57.167]  How obvious is that?
[00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.447]  Yeah, it's very obvious because they're getting nervous.
[00:58:00.467 --> 00:58:02.648]  They probably couldn't get anybody else to write it, Alex.
[00:58:03.548 --> 00:58:10.770]  They probably couldn't take it over to ABC or over to Bill O'Reilly and get them to buy off on this and say, you know, that's just a little too cozy.
[00:58:12.659 --> 00:58:15.822]  But I mean, all the way across the board, I haven't found anything.
[00:58:15.882 --> 00:58:22.868]  As a Republican, and as an ecumenical Christian, I can't find a single ounce of truth out of this Bush administration, on any subject.
[00:58:22.948 --> 00:58:28.513]  Well, now they tell us they never said there were weapons of mass destruction, and we're conspiracy theorists!
[00:58:28.653 --> 00:58:30.294]  They've debunked us, Carl!
[00:58:30.534 --> 00:58:32.536]  They never said there were weapons of mass destruction!
[00:58:32.716 --> 00:58:35.619]  Listen, I gotta get you on, Carl, I gotta get you on sometime.
[00:58:35.639 --> 00:58:36.720]  I'm gonna let you go.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.942]  Alex, do you know what a conspiracy theory is?
[00:58:39.022 --> 00:58:39.342]  What is it?
[00:58:39.838 --> 00:58:43.160]  Osama Bin Laden attacked us on 9-11-2001.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.742]  Well, you know, he made NORAD stand down from the cave.
[00:58:46.902 --> 00:58:47.502]  Good hearing from you.
[00:58:47.522 --> 00:58:48.523]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:48.543 --> 00:58:49.583]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.755 --> 00:58:59.816]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.657]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.278 --> 00:59:03.138]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.859 --> 00:59:04.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.082]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.623 --> 00:59:13.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.801]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:26.821 --> 00:59:27.942]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:28.942]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:28.983 --> 00:59:31.664]  We're here live and of course back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:32.004 --> 00:59:34.326]  Thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:59:34.346 --> 00:59:39.069]  The total free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:47.034]  I really do want to get into rule change lets CIA freely send suspects abroad to jails for torture.
[00:59:47.814 --> 00:59:48.935]  Right out of the New York Times,
[00:59:50.413 --> 00:59:54.940]  This is after federal courts have said you can't ship citizens off without due process and torture them.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.462]  You can't torture people, period.
[00:59:56.842 --> 01:00:01.950]  But Alberto Gonzalez and Michael Chertoff, they say that, hey, the President's above the law.
[01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:02.791]  He is the law.
[01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.854]  Literally, it's the law of kings.
[01:00:06.795 --> 01:00:17.644]  Then we have other headlines like up to 200 Al Qaeda terrorists in Britain, Bush sets ball rolling for overseas torture, Sydney Morning Herald, just so much more.
[01:00:17.704 --> 01:00:25.670]  I want to talk about fake media, fake reporters, and this whole global crime syndicate as well.
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:31.575]  Obviously callers are calling in who've had a chance via PrisonPlanet.tv to see my new film, Martial Law.
[01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:32.596]  We're getting reviews of that.
[01:00:33.414 --> 01:00:47.298]  We're talking about popular mechanics, popular propaganda, turning up the heat with her hit piece with the Homeland Security Chief's first cousin, Benjamin Chertoff, going on coast-to-coast AM and savaging myself and others, and then challenging me to call in when there was no way I could call in.
[01:00:47.558 --> 01:00:48.179]  I wasn't listening.
[01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:52.020]  I was asleep, finishing the film, going to bed early at like nine o'clock at night.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.541]  Just incredible.
[01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:56.061]  So we're taking your calls.
[01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:57.342]  Let's go right back to them.
[01:00:57.762 --> 01:01:00.443]  Let's talk to Keith in Michigan.
[01:01:00.483 --> 01:01:01.383]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:01:01.443 --> 01:01:01.763]  Welcome.
[01:01:02.443 --> 01:01:03.424]  Good afternoon, how are you?
[01:01:03.664 --> 01:01:03.905]  Good.
[01:01:04.445 --> 01:01:12.974]  Alright, what I need to say is that the British Empire, they have their Hegelian, Fabian, Commentarian, Monopoly game.
[01:01:13.855 --> 01:01:20.542]  And what they need is they need the American people to revolt for the American government to collapse.
[01:01:22.787 --> 01:01:31.670]  No, I've said it's part of a larger plan to let 9-11 come out in a controlled fashion and let the whole world learn about 9-11 and then act like we did it.
[01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:38.672]  That's why I expose the fact that it's Europe controlling our government using us as the bad cop while they play the part of the good cop.
[01:01:38.812 --> 01:01:39.552]  Absolutely.
[01:01:39.852 --> 01:01:44.794]  And I'd like to know if I can rent a movie theater and show your movie publicly.
[01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:51.874]  Well, I can't just give rights up to that on the air for people to charge, but on a case-by-case... No, no, no.
[01:01:51.914 --> 01:01:52.494]  Not to charge.
[01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:59.135]  On a case-by-case basis, you can arrange that with us if it's not-for-profit.
[01:01:59.575 --> 01:01:59.815]  Okay.
[01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:01.776]  For a church or for schools?
[01:02:01.796 --> 01:02:04.396]  You can show it at all the churches and all the schools you want.
[01:02:04.656 --> 01:02:08.177]  You can show it at the library, you can show it at the city hall if you want.
[01:02:08.537 --> 01:02:10.057]  I just don't want people charging for it.
[01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:11.638]  Oh, there would be no way.
[01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:12.798]  This would be absolutely free.
[01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:13.158]  Sure.
[01:02:13.218 --> 01:02:13.718]  Go ahead.
[01:02:13.778 --> 01:02:14.078]  Show it.
[01:02:14.722 --> 01:02:19.625]  Awesome, and just need to let people know that, hey, even if you're in jail, you're still on the Monopoly board.
[01:02:19.645 --> 01:02:22.667]  You know, they can take you away, they can put you in jail.
[01:02:22.928 --> 01:02:27.371]  You get out of jail, hey, you're going to have to do something.
[01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.612]  I hope they didn't get your trigger finger when you cut it off.
[01:02:32.354 --> 01:02:34.195]  No, these folks needed help.
[01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:35.096]  I was out fishing.
[01:02:35.979 --> 01:02:45.063]  And, uh, there were these Arabs out on a barge and didn't know how to... They couldn't get it to start, and the waves were pretty big, so I couldn't tie my boat up to them, and I said, alright, I'll help you.
[01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:52.166]  And I jumped in the water and swam over, sort of climbing up the side, slipped, and my hand got caught in between the door panel.
[01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:53.366]  You know, it's that sheet metal.
[01:02:53.906 --> 01:02:54.307]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:54.467 --> 01:02:57.068]  And, you know, that sharp sheet metal that has a decoration on the side?
[01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:57.668]  Yeah.
[01:02:57.688 --> 01:03:04.991]  And it was basically like sticking your finger in a, in a, uh, in a, in a shear, and it just pulled all the meat and cracked the bone right off of it.
[01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:09.165]  Well, let's hope that God blesses you and puts them in their respect together for you.
[01:03:10.405 --> 01:03:10.866]  I hear you.
[01:03:10.886 --> 01:03:11.586]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.908]  Most of the feeling actually came back in my finger.
[01:03:14.028 --> 01:03:15.469]  One side of it is still numb.
[01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:16.630]  It's kind of neat.
[01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:17.371]  You can't feel it.
[01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:18.692]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:19.572]  We're going to come back.
[01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.394]  And quickly, I really need to go quickly here.
[01:03:22.034 --> 01:03:26.438]  We're going to go to Frank, Charles, Leslie and others.
[01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:26.518]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:38.405]  Then I'm going to plunge back into all the international and national news as well, including what's happening with the dollar and what Warren Buffett's up to.
[01:03:39.686 --> 01:03:40.707]  Traitor that he is.
[01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:43.069]  Arnold controller that he is.
[01:03:43.929 --> 01:03:45.510]  It's all coming up over this quick break.
[01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.031]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:57.386]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[01:04:02.132 --> 01:04:06.517]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.557 --> 01:04:07.899]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:09.491]  Panama.
[01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:13.915]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:20.901]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:23.083]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.383 --> 01:04:33.792]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.725]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:05:58.885 --> 01:05:59.946]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:06:00.066 --> 01:06:00.947]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:06:01.047 --> 01:06:03.889]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:08.973]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:10.295]  Check out this new product.
[01:06:10.435 --> 01:06:11.576]  It's called No B.O.
[01:06:11.656 --> 01:06:13.337]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:06:13.718 --> 01:06:15.819]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.421]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:17.741]  Look.

[01:06:25.426 --> 01:06:28.528]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:34.071]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:34.932]  Try No-BO.

[01:06:52.779 --> 01:06:57.801]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.161 --> 01:07:00.442]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:09.268]  Alright, coming up we'll get into the economy, what's happening with the upcoming war with Syria and Iran.
[01:07:09.288 --> 01:07:28.313]  I want to get into the latest repercussions from the Popular Mechanics hit piece, orchestrated by the family of the Homeland Security Director, Michael Chertoff, by Benjamin Chertoff, the head editor over this exercise in lies and propaganda.
[01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.697]  But before we do that, let's blitz through some more of your calls.
[01:07:33.278 --> 01:07:36.100]  Let's talk to Frank in Louisiana.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:36.801]  Frank, go ahead.
[01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:38.042]  Yes, Alex.
[01:07:38.062 --> 01:07:38.742]  Good afternoon.
[01:07:38.802 --> 01:07:45.308]  I did listen to over half of the interview Saturday evening, probably 60 to 70 percent.
[01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:54.975]  And this Chertoff fellow supposedly was countering all the evidence that has been put forth over the last three and a half years.
[01:07:55.035 --> 01:07:56.837]  I mean, a small library of evidence.
[01:07:57.697 --> 01:08:26.944]  uh... with expert analysis but i can assure you the part that i heard this wasn't even expert counter analysis this was subjective that didn't happen this didn't happen uh... building number seven just burned down and he admitted for instance like yeah it would have taken months if not years to plan uh... a planned explosion to bring down a building but it just burned down by fire here's the thing i sent to him and his editor i said here are the video clips
[01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:29.306]  And I said, did you get them?
[01:08:29.726 --> 01:08:31.147]  Of Silverstein saying they blew it up?
[01:08:31.187 --> 01:08:32.668]  He says, yeah, I'm not talking about that.
[01:08:33.168 --> 01:08:35.889]  And I said, well, here's the firefighters telling reporters, get back.
[01:08:36.249 --> 01:08:37.730]  Associated Press, they're going to pull it.
[01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.591]  Do you want that?
[01:08:38.771 --> 01:08:39.031]  No.
[01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:42.012]  What about public officials being warned not to fly?
[01:08:42.092 --> 01:08:43.093]  No, we're not going there.
[01:08:43.373 --> 01:08:44.994]  What about CIA insider trading?
[01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:45.834]  Times of London?
[01:08:46.054 --> 01:08:46.955]  Associated Press?
[01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:48.576]  Even Fox News?
[01:08:48.796 --> 01:08:49.056]  No.
[01:08:50.196 --> 01:08:51.617]  Over and over and over.
[01:08:52.097 --> 01:08:53.378]  What about Buzzy Kromgaard?
[01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.691]  Saying, don't worry about Bin Laden, we don't want to capture him.
[01:08:56.911 --> 01:08:59.332]  What about Bin Laden being CIA, MSNBC?
[01:08:59.632 --> 01:09:00.353]  No, don't want it.
[01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:03.214]  What about Associated Press, NORAD running grills that morning?
[01:09:03.554 --> 01:09:04.555]  No, don't want to talk about it.
[01:09:04.815 --> 01:09:06.175]  What about USA Today?
[01:09:06.736 --> 01:09:11.638]  Saying that the F-16s were launched and surrounded it in 18 minutes.
[01:09:12.798 --> 01:09:15.739]  It doesn't matter to them, they just made all this stuff up.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.222]  I'm telling you Alex, this guy here was the worst guy they could have sent to counter it.
[01:09:22.623 --> 01:09:23.663]  I mean, he didn't sound
[01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.880]  His explanations, frankly, sounded juvenile.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.940]  It was almost embarrassing.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.741]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:29.501]  Here's the deal.
[01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:41.305]  Again, I have been interviewed by USA Today five times, Washington Post, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, I mean, folks, hundreds of times, hundreds of TV shows, all of it.
[01:09:42.105 --> 01:09:43.826]  I've never thought it was fake.
[01:09:44.726 --> 01:09:53.489]  I thought, when I talked to Chertoff and his other writer, it was so bad, I thought it was fake, I called Popular Mechanics, I said,
[01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:56.195]  I said, does this person work for you?
[01:09:56.215 --> 01:09:58.196]  I mean, I talked about this months ago, remember?
[01:09:58.916 --> 01:09:59.356]  Yes.
[01:09:59.456 --> 01:10:00.597]  I said, is this real?
[01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:02.218]  They said, oh yes sir, it's real.
[01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:12.343]  No, let me tell you, they sounded, it came to, you know, from listening to it for a while, I said, look, this sounds to me like totally this guy's part of the organization.
[01:10:12.403 --> 01:10:19.046]  He's an apologist for them, and he's going to muddle the waters by saying, about the most I ever got out of him was, the expert said,
[01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:20.683]  No names, really.
[01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:24.325]  Nobody countering the evidence in a scientific fashion.
[01:10:24.365 --> 01:10:32.810]  For instance, one informed caller asked him about the approximate 16-foot hole in the Pentagon where, allegedly, this big passenger airline hit.
[01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:35.092]  And you know what his answer was for this?
[01:10:36.093 --> 01:10:40.615]  He came back and he said, well, you know, this is one of the tires that was an exit point.
[01:10:41.396 --> 01:10:43.237]  I said, well, you're not answering the question at all.
[01:10:43.277 --> 01:10:49.081]  You're telling me that a tire hit one of the walls and bounced through, I think it's four-foot
[01:10:49.891 --> 01:10:51.372]  Oh yeah, that's what it is.
[01:10:51.893 --> 01:10:54.075]  And then it went through and then bounced back out.
[01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:59.399]  Let me ask you a question because I listened to a little bit of it this morning.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.021]  I just got home last night.
[01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:07.285]  I've gotten probably 50 emails and a bunch of calls from friends who recited the same story.
[01:11:07.746 --> 01:11:12.570]  But did he indeed go basically nanny nanny, boo boo, Alex won't call in, he's afraid?
[01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:14.891]  Uh, he mentioned a couple of names.
[01:11:14.931 --> 01:11:21.812]  To be honest with you, I don't think he ever really was vindictive about anybody because he couldn't... I don't think he... But you didn't listen to the whole thing.
[01:11:21.872 --> 01:11:23.433]  I heard that very late in the interview.
[01:11:23.653 --> 01:11:26.494]  He's like, well, Alex hasn't called in to defend himself.
[01:11:26.974 --> 01:11:32.175]  Well, I never heard that part of it, but I mean, he just explained away the building number seven.
[01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:39.958]  By saying that, well, he admitted it would take months, if not even years, to plan an explosion, but the building just burned down.
[01:11:39.978 --> 01:11:42.460]  Did anybody raise the Madrid fire to him?
[01:11:43.061 --> 01:11:49.025]  Early on, I heard early on that a very informed lady called in and mentioned that the building had burned for 24 hours.
[01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:50.867]  Actually, two days.
[01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.610]  But he wasn't on there, it was just Art Bell.
[01:11:54.630 --> 01:12:06.902]  We're talking 100 foot white flames shooting out and a few little bitty ceiling supports, a little inch around aluminum that supported some of that.
[01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:11.026]  Some of the sheetrock fell in, not one of the support columns.
[01:12:11.446 --> 01:12:14.770]  Well, the thing about it is, no one asked him about
[01:12:15.795 --> 01:12:20.379]  The firefighters who said during that morning they heard explosions going off in the building.
[01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:21.741]  Now this is something that they said.
[01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:33.391]  Well no one, I've got in my new film, I've got the firefighters on tape that the feds first claim that it malfunctioned, then they declared national security on it, but then the firefighters went ahead and released it to the New York Daily News of them going.
[01:12:33.431 --> 01:12:35.693]  The fires are almost out, two small fires.
[01:12:35.993 --> 01:12:41.618]  Now on the tape that I saw, I saw many tapes, yours were the best by far, but there were many good tapes.
[01:12:42.202 --> 01:12:54.045]  But, uh, at the Pentagon building, the only wheel that they showed from an airplane, they showed the wheel, it was the same wheel from a Global Skyhawk, I think, a manless, uh... It's a very small wheel.
[01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:55.465]  It's a very small wheel.
[01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:57.866]  It was identical same wheel that they found... No, no, no!
[01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:02.107]  Their own photo of a wheel, uh, looks like a Thunderchief wheel.
[01:13:02.147 --> 01:13:02.747]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:02.927 --> 01:13:03.427]  Okay, Alex.
[01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:07.648]  Seriously, folks, again, I can't do justice to this until later.
[01:13:07.668 --> 01:13:10.029]  I want to spend a few minutes on it and try to go over it.
[01:13:11.109 --> 01:13:11.629]  But, uh,
[01:13:13.018 --> 01:13:15.341]  I mean, there's blaring things in this.
[01:13:15.501 --> 01:13:18.305]  There's blaring examples that we'll get to later.
[01:13:19.447 --> 01:13:23.772]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.754]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:13:24.894 --> 01:13:25.975]  How are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:26.576]  Good, my friend.
[01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:30.061]  By the way, I got the guy, Carl Schwartz's book.
[01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:32.077]  Uh, somebody sent it to me.
[01:13:32.517 --> 01:13:34.738]  But anyway, I want to tell people about the tapes again.
[01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:38.300]  I know you probably get tired of me hearing it, but they can make a difference in the community.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.742]  All they have to do is get the tape and just show it to neighbors.
[01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:44.443]  Have people over for sandwiches and coffee.
[01:13:44.743 --> 01:13:49.306]  And that alone, it'll double our audience.
[01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.327]  It'll double the information out.
[01:13:52.787 --> 01:13:54.228]  They can't argue with the tapes.
[01:13:54.288 --> 01:13:57.090]  Now Charles, how many copies of my video have you made?
[01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:58.751]  Well, I made over 5,000.
[01:14:00.865 --> 01:14:04.029]  Now, what was it like when you were first giving my videos to people?
[01:14:04.089 --> 01:14:05.170]  What responses did you get?
[01:14:05.996 --> 01:14:07.397]  Years ago versus now.
[01:14:07.797 --> 01:14:13.539]  I got harassed, you know, by the police and when I first started this and, you know, people didn't want to talk to me.
[01:14:13.919 --> 01:14:18.040]  Now, I walk into a sandwich shop and everybody that works there knows senior tape.
[01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:19.941]  I don't feel alone no more.
[01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:23.502]  They come out and start talking about, telling me things that I don't know.
[01:14:23.843 --> 01:14:24.463]  The police.
[01:14:25.043 --> 01:14:26.864]  I go to the donut shop.
[01:14:26.904 --> 01:14:27.704]  I have coffee with them.
[01:14:27.904 --> 01:14:28.984]  Come on, sit over here, Charles.
[01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:29.825]  Come on, sit over here.
[01:14:30.385 --> 01:14:32.946]  And I had policemen take money out of their pocket and give me
[01:14:33.446 --> 01:14:33.747]  I think so.
[01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:51.846]  Off the hindsight, and do it.
[01:14:52.246 --> 01:14:53.126]  But they must do it.
[01:14:53.266 --> 01:14:57.968]  If we do this alone, we could take this country back through the information of the tapes.
[01:14:58.268 --> 01:14:59.549]  And that's why I keep calling in.
[01:14:59.569 --> 01:15:01.609]  In my community, I feel pretty good.
[01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:02.510]  I don't walk alone.
[01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:03.110]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:04.011 --> 01:15:05.312]  Now, you've called before.
[01:15:06.352 --> 01:15:11.594]  You call every few months, and it's even been in local newspapers, and your actions have had a big effect.
[01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:15.355]  Describe, though, I mean you've described before, a total shift.
[01:15:15.835 --> 01:15:19.937]  A total shift where, I mean, you've described the cops buying you coffee.
[01:15:19.977 --> 01:15:23.278]  I mean, describe the shift you've seen in your community.
[01:15:23.778 --> 01:15:30.681]  Well, people, some of them can't listen to the radio call, but they asked me about what happened to the ANNA Radio.
[01:15:31.341 --> 01:15:33.522]  People have got shortwave radios now.
[01:15:33.983 --> 01:15:36.063]  I went the other day to buy two with another guy.
[01:15:36.544 --> 01:15:39.185]  People asked me about the new tape that's coming out.
[01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.125]  They just heard about it.
[01:15:40.365 --> 01:15:41.546]  I said, I didn't get a copy yet.
[01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:42.967]  They said, will you get a copy?
[01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:43.787]  Please let me know.
[01:15:44.547 --> 01:15:45.468]  I tell them to order it.
[01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:47.029]  I tell them to listen to your program.
[01:15:47.329 --> 01:15:48.289]  People know of you.
[01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:49.730]  They know of the program.
[01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.871]  They don't even look at television.
[01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:53.072]  Half of them know more than news.
[01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:54.792]  I mean, it's a big shift.
[01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:56.073]  It's a big shift.
[01:15:56.293 --> 01:15:59.295]  And everybody can do this as a community, just with a few tapes.
[01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:02.917]  And if they don't do it, what's going to happen?
[01:16:03.657 --> 01:16:04.257]  What's going to happen?
[01:16:04.417 --> 01:16:07.419]  But if they do do it, we can take back this country just with these tapes.
[01:16:07.699 --> 01:16:09.340]  I'm telling you, I'm excited about it.
[01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:11.602]  You know, I've been excited about it.
[01:16:12.022 --> 01:16:12.883]  I really enjoy it.
[01:16:12.903 --> 01:16:13.643]  This is my thing.
[01:16:13.924 --> 01:16:15.084]  And they can do the same thing.
[01:16:15.324 --> 01:16:20.227]  Every listener here can get a copy, make a couple of tapes, or just show the copies to their neighbor.
[01:16:20.888 --> 01:16:22.349]  And believe me, they won't be alone.
[01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:29.673]  Well, the film's being printed up right now, and we should be shipping out by the end of the week, so everybody can do your pre-order right now.
[01:16:29.773 --> 01:16:30.874]  Charles, thanks for calling.
[01:16:31.474 --> 01:16:32.575]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.176]  Great job.
[01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.678]  Leslie in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:16:36.738 --> 01:16:37.198]  Go ahead.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:54.108]  Hi Alex, in response to the Coast and Coast comments that were made this weekend, this situation reminds me of the infamous words by Thomas Jefferson that happened to be inscribed in the huge letters above our General Assembly building located in Richmond, Virginia.
[01:16:54.708 --> 01:17:00.731]  Quote, reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error.
[01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:04.473]  They are the natural enemies of error and of error only.
[01:17:05.828 --> 01:17:12.168]  Alex, I look forward to hearing you again very soon on Coast to Coast again and responding to Popular Mechanics.
[01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:17.205]  Well, again, George Norrie is just a champ.
[01:17:17.365 --> 01:17:18.725]  He lets me on all the time.
[01:17:19.185 --> 01:17:20.966]  I hope they'll let me on to respond to this.
[01:17:21.406 --> 01:17:22.666]  Again, it wasn't George's show.
[01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:23.607]  It was Bell's.
[01:17:23.687 --> 01:17:25.807]  And Bell is a great broadcaster.
[01:17:25.867 --> 01:17:27.347]  He has a right to say what he thinks.
[01:17:27.387 --> 01:17:28.248]  He can do what he wants.
[01:17:28.548 --> 01:17:29.588]  I understand that, Alex.
[01:17:29.608 --> 01:17:36.110]  But my beef is with the Homeland Security Chief's family member, Benjamin Chertoff.
[01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:38.410]  But, Alex, you're doing great work.
[01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:41.331]  And finally, we're making a difference.
[01:17:41.846 --> 01:17:44.667]  So this is a great invitation for you to come back on the show.
[01:17:45.867 --> 01:17:46.527]  Well, I hear you.
[01:17:46.607 --> 01:17:56.989]  Email him and ask him and I'll tell you, this shows that if they've got to dispatch Homeland Security Chiefs family to attack me and others, they've got a problem.
[01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:58.510]  Congratulations, Alex.
[01:17:58.530 --> 01:17:59.690]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:01.070]  Well, you guys are.
[01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:03.591]  I mean, we wouldn't be having this effect if you weren't taking action.
[01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:04.431]  Take care, Leslie.
[01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:05.271]  You bet.
[01:18:05.351 --> 01:18:06.972]  James in North Carolina.
[01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:07.712]  James, go ahead.
[01:18:09.966 --> 01:18:10.406]  You there?
[01:18:10.646 --> 01:18:11.386]  Yes, sir, I am.
[01:18:11.406 --> 01:18:12.227]  Oh, okay.
[01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:19.529]  Um, I heard that show that night, and the guy bumbled and stuttered like he was on cocaine or something.
[01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:22.030]  I couldn't get a sense out of what he did, though.
[01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:28.011]  Well, I don't know about drugs, but I know that I thought he was fake when I talked to him.
[01:18:28.391 --> 01:18:28.952]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:29.052 --> 01:18:33.733]  I mean, it just... It, uh, tore me up, and Art just...
[01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:36.219]  He's fed out.
[01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:42.005]  I mean, why did he give up his show and he just plays around on weekends when he feels like it?
[01:18:42.025 --> 01:18:43.987]  I like him, but you know what I'm saying.
[01:18:44.847 --> 01:18:45.348]  I understand.
[01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:46.249]  Anything else, James?
[01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:49.552]  Ah, that'll do it, and I appreciate you taking my time.
[01:18:49.652 --> 01:18:50.673]  I'm on your side.
[01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:51.354]  God bless you.
[01:18:51.374 --> 01:18:52.215]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:18:53.516 --> 01:18:57.217]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[01:18:57.497 --> 01:18:58.657]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[01:18:58.717 --> 01:19:03.719]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[01:19:03.759 --> 01:19:07.340]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.340]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:09.720]  Cardivite.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:10.401]  Cardivite.
[01:19:10.441 --> 01:19:12.001]  We all use Cardivite!
[01:19:12.868 --> 01:19:16.370]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:25.175]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world, specially designed to improve your health.
[01:19:25.355 --> 01:19:28.217]  Come on and care about yourself just a little more with Cardivite.
[01:19:28.537 --> 01:19:34.060]  You can find more information at www.kareldite.us or call 1-877-928-8822.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:34.320]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:54.789]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:19:55.089 --> 01:19:59.691]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:20:00.012 --> 01:20:02.353]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:20:02.593 --> 01:20:04.114]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:20:04.494 --> 01:20:09.577]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:20:09.897 --> 01:20:11.117]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[01:20:11.177 --> 01:20:13.879]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:20:14.259 --> 01:20:21.302]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering a 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[01:20:21.662 --> 01:20:24.883]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:25.144 --> 01:20:27.845]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:28.185 --> 01:20:33.307]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[01:20:33.827 --> 01:20:39.311]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[01:20:39.411 --> 01:20:41.372]  Get the map.
[01:20:41.392 --> 01:20:43.793]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:45.014]  The time is now.
[01:20:45.354 --> 01:20:47.696]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.256 --> 01:20:51.358]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[01:20:52.731 --> 01:20:56.015]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:56.055 --> 01:21:00.239]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.283]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:03.483 --> 01:21:05.886]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:06.066 --> 01:21:09.049]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI.
[01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:11.312]  We're good to go!
[01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:30.052]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.562 --> 01:21:54.703]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:54.983 --> 01:21:59.987]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:02.849]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.049 --> 01:22:11.595]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:11.955 --> 01:22:20.397]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a higher vibration state.
[01:22:20.517 --> 01:22:23.958]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[01:22:24.218 --> 01:22:31.661]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[01:22:31.961 --> 01:22:33.941]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[01:22:34.001 --> 01:22:35.402]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[01:22:35.482 --> 01:22:40.303]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:43.664]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[01:22:43.924 --> 01:22:45.404]  That's 888-727-8269.
[01:22:45.564 --> 01:22:58.028]  Or visit aquanorthwest.com.
[01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:08.571]  The Globalists are on the defensive.
[01:23:08.631 --> 01:23:09.771]  You are the front line.
[01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:15.551]  The shock troops in the battle for humanity.
[01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:18.192]  You can never stop.
[01:23:19.413 --> 01:23:21.333]  You've got to intensify your efforts.
[01:23:23.354 --> 01:23:29.336]  If we work hard enough, we may be able to stop the New World Order from carrying out larger terror attacks.
[01:23:31.337 --> 01:23:41.240]  If they calculate that the people will not buy the storyline they give us after another attack, they may not carry out another attack.
[01:23:42.586 --> 01:23:43.406]  At least for now.
[01:23:45.867 --> 01:23:52.648]  If they think we'll buy their story and cuddle up to the killers as the saviors, they will assuredly do it.
[01:23:55.208 --> 01:24:00.009]  Yeah, there was no mention in the Popular Mechanics article about Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[01:24:00.029 --> 01:24:02.550]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.910]  Oh no!
[01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.471]  Shoddily done, my friends, and we'll talk about it coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.251]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:12.106]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:24:12.126 --> 01:24:12.826]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:24:13.026 --> 01:24:14.706]  Yeah, a couple callers back.
[01:24:14.726 --> 01:24:17.727]  I have to pull one of my quotations from Thomas Jefferson.
[01:24:17.767 --> 01:24:19.228]  Truth can stand by itself.
[01:24:19.348 --> 01:24:22.289]  It is error alone which needs the support of government.
[01:24:23.569 --> 01:24:29.851]  And, you know, I woke up for the second hour of the Sure Talk show when they started taking callers.
[01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:32.052]  They only took, I don't know, four or five callers.
[01:24:32.652 --> 01:24:34.172]  And they were mostly all lame.
[01:24:34.232 --> 01:24:36.913]  It wasn't until last night with the Wheehowers when they
[01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:44.655]  Look, for that one too, there was actually a reasonable objection call, and what was really disgusting that first night...
[01:24:45.439 --> 01:24:47.180]  Was that woman who called in.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:55.905]  I'm sick of hearing Alex Jones, well she never listened to you because she cast you and Chertoff didn't counter this at all.
[01:24:56.205 --> 01:24:58.827]  He claims apparently he listens to quite a bit.
[01:24:59.367 --> 01:25:01.329]  Apparently he's really too into Alex.
[01:25:02.509 --> 01:25:04.370]  I don't know if you missed all that part.
[01:25:04.911 --> 01:25:08.613]  Well I'm glad the Homeland Security Chief's blood is listening.
[01:25:08.933 --> 01:25:10.194]  Well neither he nor
[01:25:13.052 --> 01:25:29.480]  Art Bell, who should have known better, sought to counter this disgusting woman who had you cast as an anti-Semite when you've never had so much as a veiled anti-Semitism and have panned anti-Semitism that have come across your show.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.781]  So she invented that out of whole cloth.
[01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:32.962]  So what did she say?
[01:25:33.522 --> 01:25:35.783]  Oh, she just said, well, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:38.805]  Now, does she mean to imply by that
[01:25:39.429 --> 01:25:44.793]  That the Illuminati agenda is a Semitic proposition?
[01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:46.294]  That's a good point.
[01:25:46.334 --> 01:25:55.340]  The people that quote, counter that and try to... You know, it's like when I covered the Odigo story out of MSNBC, Harat's Jerusalem Post, which is in my new film.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.801]  Is the Jerusalem Post anti-Semitic?
[01:25:58.302 --> 01:25:59.602]  Is Harat's anti-Semitic?
[01:25:59.702 --> 01:26:06.527]  I mean, Odigo admits they got a warning and they told their employees in the buildings four hours before, get out of them!
[01:26:07.508 --> 01:26:09.690]  That doesn't mean Israel did the attacks!
[01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:16.714]  Yeah, and a couple more holes from Chertoff mentioned I don't know how much value a particular single frame of a still video is.
[01:26:17.334 --> 01:26:26.860]  He implied that, well, they're not high shutter speeds just because on the surveillance videos, you know, where they can shove one tape in a week and have 24-hour coverage.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.481]  You know, they released that.
[01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:33.044]  That was maybe one of the very few clips of anything that the government's ever released.
[01:26:33.064 --> 01:26:36.686]  Well, let me just stop you there before we go any further.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.025]  So this woman calls in, and she says, I'm an anti-Semite, and everybody... You.
[01:26:42.306 --> 01:26:43.247]  You per se.
[01:26:44.648 --> 01:26:46.350]  That was... I mean, give me the quote.
[01:26:46.891 --> 01:26:53.058]  Well, I don't have it verbatim, but she directly cast you personally as being anti-Semitic.
[01:26:53.098 --> 01:26:53.859]  That's a whopper.
[01:26:53.919 --> 01:26:57.724]  She never listened to you, or if she did, she just invented that out of the whole cloth.
[01:27:00.271 --> 01:27:20.690]  Yeah, anyway, so Chertoff is on about this single still from the government video, Pentagon perhaps, and while it's not very high shutter speed, it's only 10 frames per second, well, that displays at least technological ignorance, because that is the same on those VCRs, those surveillance VCRs.
[01:27:21.733 --> 01:27:38.471]  That is the same shutter or frame speed rather as if they did the full 72 or whatever frames per second so that's an invalid criticism and he never really answered why that's virtually the only thing that the government's ever released when if they have you know they got at least 10 or
[01:27:40.668 --> 01:27:42.950]  The Pentagon is the most surveilled airspace.
[01:27:43.471 --> 01:27:54.564]  The FBI went to the hotels and gas stations and took the surveillance camera tapes that show the Pentagon.
[01:27:54.824 --> 01:27:55.185]  Why?
[01:27:55.605 --> 01:27:55.906]  Why?
[01:27:56.566 --> 01:27:58.147]  Yeah, and you know they got videos rolling.
[01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:03.812]  They got at least 10 video cameras rolling around that Pentagon around the clock.
[01:28:04.052 --> 01:28:04.873]  Roger, I'm gonna let you go.
[01:28:04.933 --> 01:28:05.513]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:06.254]  Really good points.
[01:28:06.554 --> 01:28:08.155]  It's the same thing with Oklahoma City.
[01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:10.817]  They have 12 surveillance camera tapes.
[01:28:11.397 --> 01:28:13.479]  FBI agents have gone public in the L.A.
[01:28:13.499 --> 01:28:15.941]  Times and said it shows McVeigh with an Arab.
[01:28:16.818 --> 01:28:19.159]  And we talked to police who've seen those tapes.
[01:28:19.519 --> 01:28:26.562]  They raided a reporter in Indiana a few years ago who'd been given the tape by the FBI and didn't deny that it didn't show John Doe number two.
[01:28:27.222 --> 01:28:28.043]  Why do they do that?
[01:28:28.863 --> 01:28:30.744]  Because those Iraqis were U.S.
[01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:31.584]  government agents.
[01:28:32.285 --> 01:28:36.006]  Just like the supposed hijackers were government agents taking part in a drill.
[01:28:36.947 --> 01:28:38.087]  It's real simple, folks.
[01:28:38.807 --> 01:28:41.789]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more calls and more news.
[01:28:41.809 --> 01:28:42.229]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:46.458]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[01:29:05.944 --> 01:29:12.946]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.366 --> 01:29:19.469]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.609 --> 01:29:20.849]  There are no side effects.

[01:31:54.077 --> 01:31:59.219]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:59.879 --> 01:32:02.220]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.341]  Alright, coming up we'll continue with your calls.
[01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:07.721]  I've got some news I do want to get to.
[01:32:07.741 --> 01:32:08.562]  It's very important.
[01:32:09.282 --> 01:32:13.843]  First, I'm going to spend a few minutes on Mr. Chertoff.
[01:32:16.344 --> 01:32:19.945]  The minion of Homeland Security Chief, his family,
[01:32:21.023 --> 01:32:25.524]  Michael Chertoff is now being reported about respective publications.
[01:32:26.964 --> 01:32:36.006]  I do want to spend a few minutes on this first, and then we have Christopher Bolin, American Free Press, one of the outfits breaking this, coming on in the next hour.
[01:32:36.046 --> 01:32:38.466]  We'll continue with your phone calls as well then.
[01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:46.148]  Before I get into Chertoff just briefly, and again I'd like a transcript to be made of this, and then
[01:32:47.168 --> 01:32:52.650]  As an addendum to it, for those that do transcripts for us, the great listeners, we'll post the audio of this tomorrow.
[01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:58.472]  I'd like to have the Christopher Boleyn interview, or whatever you see fit, tagged onto it.
[01:32:58.932 --> 01:33:02.113]  And I'm also going to write a rebuttal to it.
[01:33:02.133 --> 01:33:06.435]  It's something I should have done weeks ago, but I was busy finishing Martial Law, my new film.
[01:33:07.635 --> 01:33:09.096]  Talking about Martial Law.
[01:33:10.716 --> 01:33:11.977]  It is my crowning achievement.
[01:33:12.037 --> 01:33:13.117]  It is my best work.
[01:33:13.357 --> 01:33:15.218]  It is two hours, thirty-five minutes long.
[01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:30.856]  It is really three films in one, where we're threatened to be arrested by the police multiple times daily in New York, the hover blimps, the sound cannons, other reporters being arrested, secret police taking photos of us.
[01:33:31.976 --> 01:33:35.258]  That's the first 30 minutes of the film, and it's dynamic.
[01:33:35.998 --> 01:33:42.481]  We have communists threatened to, you know, say that they wish we were dead, want to kill us, and showing what provocateurs they are.
[01:33:43.161 --> 01:33:44.461]  That's in the first 30 minutes.
[01:33:44.481 --> 01:33:45.542]  Then we spend an hour
[01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:59.678]  On 9-11, I mean the latest, most powerful info, just A to Z. Rapid fire, interspersed with ground zero action and witnesses saying they were warned not to go into work.
[01:33:59.938 --> 01:34:00.739]  It's just incredible.
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:09.445]  Then we look in the last hour at the mindset, at the driving philosophy, the ideologies of the globalists.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:26.712]  And we prove from their own statements, their own books, their own, all of it, that it is really a Luciferian cult that has created skull and bones in the Bohemian Grove and that Arnold is one of their minions and they're preparing him for the throne here in America.
[01:34:27.492 --> 01:34:31.575]  It gets into the bushes and the Nazis and it just, it just paints the picture.
[01:34:32.055 --> 01:34:38.500]  We confront David Gergen, that's how the third act starts, where he doesn't deny the rituals and doesn't deny being an enemy, he starts
[01:34:39.691 --> 01:34:42.832]  Using basic profanity at me and getting in my face.
[01:34:43.853 --> 01:34:45.233]  That's how Act 3 starts.
[01:34:45.253 --> 01:34:47.214]  Look, you've got to see it to believe it.
[01:34:47.254 --> 01:34:49.195]  It is so powerful.
[01:34:50.175 --> 01:34:51.876]  I'm really proud of this work.
[01:34:53.376 --> 01:34:55.417]  And I poured my heart and soul out making it.
[01:34:56.478 --> 01:34:59.459]  So, please get Martial Law 9-1-1.
[01:34:59.519 --> 01:35:00.479]  Rise of the Police State.

[01:36:41.445 --> 01:36:53.810]  Alright, let me try to calmly and succinctly go over Benjamin Chertoff in
[01:36:55.971 --> 01:37:11.599]  Late November of 2004, my wife handed me a stack of media that I had to contact, and amongst it was Popular Mechanics doing a piece on popular 9-11 quote theory.
[01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:22.345]  So I call and I talk to Benjamin Chertoff, who we've now learned is a close family member of the Homeland Security Director, according to press reports.
[01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:27.651]  And I talked to him, and I talked to others, and I thought it was a fake interview.
[01:37:27.771 --> 01:37:29.692]  I've never thought an interview wasn't real.
[01:37:31.714 --> 01:37:39.880]  Of the hundreds of newspaper, TV interviews, the thousands of radio interviews I've done, I've never thought that a reporter was fake.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:45.504]  I mean, people from school newspapers sound more credible and serious, and I've done dozens of those.
[01:37:46.265 --> 01:37:48.627]  USA Today, Washington Post, New York Times.
[01:37:49.267 --> 01:37:52.850]  These are normally focused, serious people, even of their adversaries.
[01:37:54.998 --> 01:37:57.159]  I thought that the interview wasn't real.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.080]  It was so shoddy.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.602]  So I called Popular Mechanics and I said, is this real?
[01:38:01.562 --> 01:38:04.124]  One of the chief editors called back and said, yes, it's indeed real.
[01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:07.746]  And they swore to me, this is not a hit piece.
[01:38:07.766 --> 01:38:09.467]  We're just looking at the popular theories.
[01:38:10.748 --> 01:38:14.891]  Then the headline on the magazine, 9-11 lies debunking.
[01:38:16.332 --> 01:38:18.173]  And it's conclusive, folks, they say.
[01:38:19.534 --> 01:38:21.035]  And so this is what they engaged in.
[01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.197]  So I talked to Chertoff and others.
[01:38:25.639 --> 01:38:33.184]  And on every point they'd raise to me, I'd email them mainstream news articles, documents, Larry Silverstein saying that they blew up WTC7.
[01:38:33.764 --> 01:38:35.285]  Suddenly they wouldn't want to talk about that.
[01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:36.726]  They'd move on to something else.
[01:38:37.406 --> 01:38:42.209]  He would raise an article written by somebody else that I'd posted.
[01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:46.912]  And say, well we called these seismologists and they say they were interviewed by you.
[01:38:46.932 --> 01:38:50.475]  And I go, well it's clear the article was written by somebody else.
[01:38:50.715 --> 01:38:52.556]  Did you ask if they were interviewed by this person?
[01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:54.111]  No, I didn't.
[01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:55.072]  Well, are you going to?
[01:38:55.132 --> 01:38:56.472]  Well, let's talk about something else.
[01:38:56.992 --> 01:39:08.117]  So a lot of stuff they were going to put in there got dropped, because I told their chief editor, I said, look, I can tell this is a hit piece, and you're trying to libel me, you better watch yourself.
[01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:12.999]  So a whole bunch of stuff they were going to do wasn't in there about me, because I could see what they were doing.
[01:39:14.159 --> 01:39:18.621]  And by the end of it, I just said, I talked to them four or five times, I said, I know this is a hit piece.
[01:39:19.622 --> 01:39:20.682]  And I know what's going on.
[01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:29.002]  Well, it sure enough was, and there are just so many facets to it.
[01:39:29.242 --> 01:39:35.707]  I mean, some of the things they debunked, I agree, is not provable.
[01:39:35.967 --> 01:39:37.548]  So, number one, they built a straw man.
[01:39:37.989 --> 01:39:40.771]  Of the sixteen points, four or five of them are questionable.
[01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:41.791]  Okay?
[01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:42.992]  So you build a straw man.
[01:39:43.012 --> 01:39:48.756]  I mean, you could find somebody on the internet saying space aliens carried out 9-11, or the planes were holograms.
[01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:49.837]  I don't believe that.
[01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:53.092]  You could find people who think space aliens killed Kennedy.
[01:39:53.352 --> 01:39:54.153]  No, the government did.
[01:39:54.393 --> 01:40:00.397]  And the media likes to point at people who think space aliens killed Kennedy and then, okay, so you think somebody else killed Kennedy, you think it's space aliens.
[01:40:00.558 --> 01:40:03.800]  So, that's basically the straw man argument.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.461]  They did that.
[01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:14.689]  But a bunch of the points, like Building 7, no mention of Silverstein, no mention of the firefighters telling reporters, get back, we're going to pull it, that's Associated Press, there's none of that.
[01:40:15.449 --> 01:40:17.431]  But one of the really sterling examples
[01:40:18.914 --> 01:40:19.594]  From the Peace.
[01:40:19.994 --> 01:40:21.255]  But I pray none of you buy it.
[01:40:21.275 --> 01:40:21.835]  It's online.
[01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:22.475]  You can read it there.
[01:40:22.815 --> 01:40:23.616]  Please don't spend your money.
[01:40:23.796 --> 01:40:25.896]  And if you have a subscription to them, don't be lazy.
[01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:26.717]  Call and cancel it.
[01:40:26.757 --> 01:40:30.338]  They deserve to have people boycott them.
[01:40:31.758 --> 01:40:36.780]  Of course, Hearst is always... I mean, it is the... When you go to college, they teach you.
[01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:38.430]  In journalism school.
[01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.412]  I mean, Hearst is the name in yellow journalism.
[01:40:41.812 --> 01:40:43.473]  Hearst wrote the book on it.
[01:40:43.493 --> 01:40:43.613]  Okay?
[01:40:43.633 --> 01:40:45.974]  And they have, you know, Rosebud, Citizen Kane.
[01:40:46.014 --> 01:40:51.998]  I mean, you talk about politics and manipulation and influence peddling, Hearst is the name.
[01:40:53.899 --> 01:40:55.020]  It's as dirty as it gets.
[01:40:55.781 --> 01:41:00.944]  And I haven't paid attention to Hearst, you know, in modern history, and I guess they still behave in the same fashion.
[01:41:02.305 --> 01:41:03.966]  But, I mean, just go take a
[01:41:04.938 --> 01:41:06.979]  College class in journalism.
[01:41:07.219 --> 01:41:08.720]  First thing you learn about is Hearst.
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:14.502]  And the DeGaulle Estate and the rest of it.
[01:41:17.463 --> 01:41:19.184]  So, that's wrong.
[01:41:19.204 --> 01:41:20.545]  The DeGaulle Estate is in Dallas.
[01:41:21.105 --> 01:41:21.605]  I've been there.
[01:41:21.665 --> 01:41:24.086]  The big, famous, beautiful place in California.
[01:41:25.387 --> 01:41:25.927]  It doesn't matter.
[01:41:25.947 --> 01:41:27.148]  It's a big castle.
[01:41:28.268 --> 01:41:29.549]  I'm very occultic, too.
[01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:30.349]  You ought to go there.
[01:41:30.769 --> 01:41:32.650]  But that's a side issue.
[01:41:34.625 --> 01:41:36.646]  So, there's just so many facets to this.
[01:41:38.327 --> 01:41:43.229]  So when we put a transcript up, let's just take these babbling ramblings out.
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:48.212]  When I try to look at this spectrum of propaganda, it's so hard to know where to start.
[01:41:49.192 --> 01:41:52.314]  But one of the biggest smoking guns of disinfo in the article
[01:41:53.264 --> 01:42:19.915]  is no stand down order claim no fighter jets were scrambled from any of the 28 Air Force bases within close range of the four hijacked flights on September 11th Andrews had two squadrons of fighter jets with the job of protecting the skies over Washington DC says the website emperorsclothes.com they failed to do their job there's only one explanation for this writes Mark R. Ellis of standdown.net our Air Force was ordered to stand down on 9-11
[01:42:21.332 --> 01:42:21.692]  Fact!
[01:42:21.852 --> 01:42:23.153]  Now they're going to tell you fact.
[01:42:23.473 --> 01:42:26.074]  It's like Rumsfeld telling you fact on Face the Nation.
[01:42:26.134 --> 01:42:27.854]  I never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[01:42:28.114 --> 01:42:28.855]  It's an urban legend.
[01:42:29.315 --> 01:42:32.696]  Well, just because you say that's a fact, Rumsfeld, we all know it's a lie.
[01:42:32.936 --> 01:42:34.557]  Because we have you on video.
[01:42:34.677 --> 01:42:39.138]  On 9-11, there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the continuous 48 states.
[01:42:39.538 --> 01:42:43.420]  Yeah, because they were all part of the giant drill, which is Associated Press reported.
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:49.802]  No computer network or alarm automated alert the North American Air Defense Command NORAD of missing planes.
[01:42:49.982 --> 01:42:50.582]  That's not true.
[01:42:52.808 --> 01:43:10.952]  They, Civilian Air Traffic Control at ATC, had to pick up the phone and literally dial us, says Major Douglas Martin, Public Affairs Officer for NORAD, Boston Center, one of the 22 Federal Aviation Administration Regional ATC Facilities, called NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector three times.
[01:43:12.532 --> 01:43:13.693]  And then it goes on.
[01:43:14.453 --> 01:43:15.653]  They go on to say,
[01:43:17.289 --> 01:43:22.874]  That there's a claim that planes have been scrambled hundreds of times before 9-11.
[01:43:23.454 --> 01:43:25.176]  And they say, no, that's not true.
[01:43:25.596 --> 01:43:29.640]  In the decade before 9-11, it had only happened one time.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:31.281]  This is what the article says.
[01:43:31.801 --> 01:43:34.244]  It had only happened one time.
[01:43:36.105 --> 01:43:36.646]  One time!
[01:43:36.666 --> 01:43:38.047]  Let me say that again.
[01:43:38.667 --> 01:43:42.591]  It had only happened one time, and that was Payne Stewart, because you all heard about it.
[01:43:43.061 --> 01:44:00.391]  Well, the very major that they quote, Major Douglas Martin, and in this transcript we'll find that AP article and post a link to it, he told the Associated Press that they'd over 60 times scrambled them and had them intercepted in the year before September 11th.
[01:44:01.437 --> 01:44:10.003]  But again, everybody on the face of this has all heard about the Cessna in a storm that gets off course and goes over a military base or flies into D.C.
[01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.525]  airspace before 9-11.
[01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.626]  F-16s fly up next to it.
[01:44:14.527 --> 01:44:19.170]  I've talked to pilots who've had radio problems and F-16s fly up next to them.
[01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:26.956]  Everybody knows this, not just Major Douglas Martin, the Public Affairs Officer, saying they've done all these intercepts and all these scrambles.
[01:44:28.457 --> 01:44:29.438]  In the Associated Press,
[01:44:30.211 --> 01:44:31.331]  We have the public record.
[01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:32.292]  Everybody knows this.
[01:44:32.312 --> 01:44:33.412]  This is public knowledge.
[01:44:35.512 --> 01:44:36.773]  So you have that right there.
[01:44:36.873 --> 01:44:41.854]  I mean, it's just mind-blowing to see this happening.
[01:44:43.215 --> 01:44:46.655]  And the question is, why do we put up with this?
[01:44:47.816 --> 01:44:51.297]  And there's just a bunch of other case point examples of this.
[01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:55.998]  And this is how they supposedly debunk everything.
[01:44:56.627 --> 01:45:12.192]  Then, he gets up on the radio, Saturday night, Sunday morning, and tells tens of millions of people that, well, Mr. Jones could call in and defend himself, and an hour later, well, I guess he isn't going to call in and defend himself, because he can't.
[01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:13.972]  He can't refute these facts.
[01:45:14.633 --> 01:45:18.854]  Just because you say fact, fact, fact, fact, fact, doesn't mean it's a fact.
[01:45:20.755 --> 01:45:22.035]  And, while I was
[01:45:23.112 --> 01:45:32.978]  Being interviewed by Mr. Chertoff and other members of the popular propaganda staff, I kept saying, aren't you going to talk about public officials being warned not to fly?
[01:45:33.539 --> 01:45:34.920]  And I sent them all those articles.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:44.966]  Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MSNBC, Salman Rushdie, Times of London, CBS News, reporting on John Ashcroft.
[01:45:46.013 --> 01:45:57.438]  Are you going to talk about Bush on Cipro, Associated Press, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer admitted it, the whole staff on Cipro, the cabinet on Cipro, four weeks before it showed up in Boca Raton, Florida.
[01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:00.200]  Are you going to talk about CIA insider trading?
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.080]  No, no, no.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.942]  Will you talk about Larry Silverstein saying that he pulled the buildings?
[01:46:05.082 --> 01:46:06.122]  I've sent you the video clip.
[01:46:06.162 --> 01:46:06.883]  Have you watched it?
[01:46:07.303 --> 01:46:08.343]  No, I haven't had time.
[01:46:08.623 --> 01:46:10.564]  Will you call Larry Silverstein and ask him?
[01:46:10.604 --> 01:46:11.465]  He says he blew it up.
[01:46:12.705 --> 01:46:14.146]  Um, no, I don't think so.
[01:46:17.702 --> 01:46:18.583]  Or, uh, maybe.
[01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:21.668]  Then I talked to his editor.
[01:46:21.989 --> 01:46:23.351]  I said, I'm sending this to you.
[01:46:24.092 --> 01:46:25.454]  Will you call Larry Silverstein?
[01:46:25.534 --> 01:46:26.676]  Oh, we're very interested in that.
[01:46:26.976 --> 01:46:28.078]  And this isn't a hit piece.
[01:46:28.759 --> 01:46:29.600]  No, it's not.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:30.321]  We promise.
[01:46:30.822 --> 01:46:32.585]  We just want to see what you guys think.
[01:46:36.483 --> 01:46:37.924]  So, the bottom line is this.
[01:46:38.464 --> 01:46:40.385]  People aren't listening to these people anymore.
[01:46:40.445 --> 01:46:41.306]  They're not listening.
[01:46:41.666 --> 01:46:42.586]  They're not believing it.
[01:46:43.027 --> 01:46:45.228]  The population knows, by and large.
[01:46:45.268 --> 01:46:50.030]  They may not know all the details, but they know that information is being twisted.
[01:46:50.351 --> 01:46:51.391]  It's being spun.
[01:46:51.731 --> 01:46:54.553]  It's being fabricated.
[01:46:54.593 --> 01:46:55.513]  It's being made up.
[01:46:55.613 --> 01:46:57.214]  It's being whitewashed.
[01:46:58.615 --> 01:46:59.215]  They know that.
[01:46:59.976 --> 01:47:05.479]  Your credibility is at all time lows.
[01:47:07.069 --> 01:47:09.671]  And it's just that simple.
[01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:13.053]  Your credibility is gone.
[01:47:14.414 --> 01:47:20.037]  And it's now part of the record that the government's been caught thousands and thousands of times lying to us.
[01:47:20.457 --> 01:47:25.460]  So is it any surprise now that we have articles like this from Newsmax?
[01:47:26.041 --> 01:47:29.042]  Web news grows, papers spiral down.
[01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:32.324]  And I watched some TV this weekend when I was on a short vacation.
[01:47:32.384 --> 01:47:33.385]  I watched a couple hours of it.
[01:47:33.825 --> 01:47:36.367]  Every news show I saw was attacking the new media.
[01:47:36.986 --> 01:47:42.207]  And talking about how uncredible it is, and how it's taking over, and what are we going to do?
[01:47:42.688 --> 01:47:51.270]  And they even tried to use the White House's own male prostitute, Madam, and see how uncredible the alternative media is?
[01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:59.112]  Well that's not the alternative media, that's one of your, one of your boy toys, Lord Bush.
[01:48:00.472 --> 01:48:02.393]  That's one of the globalist little minions
[01:48:03.408 --> 01:48:11.192]  One of his influence peddlers infiltrating the alternative press through a neocon website openly funded by the White House!
[01:48:12.353 --> 01:48:26.241]  So they have the nerve on two separate shows I saw, The Daily Show was one and CNN was another, to go on the air and imply because of the Gannon story, that, oh see, that's how uncredible the alternative press is!
[01:48:27.121 --> 01:48:27.422]  See?
[01:48:27.722 --> 01:48:28.162]  They've got
[01:48:29.136 --> 01:48:31.257]  Jon Stewart used the word man-whore.
[01:48:31.837 --> 01:48:35.299]  Alternative Press has got man-whores running it.
[01:48:36.319 --> 01:48:39.841]  So you've got your fake reporters out there, and then it's our fault!
[01:48:40.581 --> 01:48:41.121]  See, no, no.
[01:48:41.441 --> 01:48:43.842]  You're trying to infiltrate the alternative media.
[01:48:44.583 --> 01:48:46.764]  Bush has paid tens of millions for fake blogs.
[01:48:47.084 --> 01:48:50.905]  Seventy-six million for fake newscasts just for Medicaid.
[01:48:51.266 --> 01:48:52.186]  Armstrong Williams.
[01:48:52.206 --> 01:48:54.407]  There's dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens.
[01:48:54.807 --> 01:48:56.928]  I hear it locally on the radio, people.
[01:48:58.090 --> 01:49:08.653]  I hear locally, federally funded Austin Air Force ads, that's a group wanting to get emissions testing on cars, and I've called up before and they go, yeah, it is a paid spot, how'd you know that?
[01:49:09.593 --> 01:49:11.494]  Packaged into the local newscast!
[01:49:13.715 --> 01:49:14.855]  It's everywhere!
[01:49:16.235 --> 01:49:16.655]  Alright?
[01:49:17.536 --> 01:49:25.858]  Look, I had these people offer me a million bucks in the first year, six years ago, to go become a neocon.
[01:49:27.378 --> 01:49:28.839]  You could be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[01:49:29.059 --> 01:49:32.281]  Just stop talking about black helicopters and the New World Order.
[01:49:32.602 --> 01:49:33.482]  Here's the contract.
[01:49:35.463 --> 01:49:44.730]  We're going to start you out on 15 juggernaut marquee stations and if you play a ball after the first year, which is going to get a million, you're going to get triple that.
[01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:46.611]  And you know what I told them?
[01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:51.174]  I said, you can take your offer and you know what you can do with it.
[01:49:53.436 --> 01:49:54.937]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.118 --> 01:49:58.220]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.264]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.304 --> 01:50:06.548]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.888 --> 01:50:10.671]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.751 --> 01:50:12.613]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.833 --> 01:50:16.096]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.136 --> 01:50:20.861]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.021 --> 01:50:24.064]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.244 --> 01:50:27.107]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:33.713]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.233 --> 01:50:38.037]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:58.693]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:58.913 --> 01:51:01.775]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:01.875 --> 01:51:08.579]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:08.759 --> 01:51:11.781]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:11.981 --> 01:51:14.362]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.502 --> 01:51:19.225]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:51:19.445 --> 01:51:33.971]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:07.672]  So we have this atmosphere now in the country where we're learning how many members of the press are paid off and controlled.
[01:53:08.632 --> 01:53:10.193]  But there's other forms of control.
[01:53:10.253 --> 01:53:20.595]  The globalist editors and controllers can just look at other writings of different reporters out there and pick people that instinctively have the establishment agenda and mindset.
[01:53:20.815 --> 01:53:22.176]  That's another form of control.
[01:53:23.516 --> 01:53:25.357]  And then on top of that you have blood.
[01:53:25.577 --> 01:53:26.757]  You have these societies.
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:33.102]  You have this elite and it's nepotism where they put their own minions into power.
[01:53:34.262 --> 01:53:43.606]  And it is being reported that Chertoff's cousin penned Popular Mechanics' 9-1-1 hit piece.
[01:53:45.546 --> 01:53:56.330]  Who is Benjamin Chertoff, the senior researcher at Popular Mechanics, who is behind the article, American Free Press has learned that he is none other than a cousin of Michael Chertoff, the new Secretary of Homeland Security.
[01:53:58.112 --> 01:54:16.539]  This means that the Hearst paid Benjamin Chertoff to write an article supporting the seriously flawed explanation that is based on a particularly non-existent investigation of the terror events that directly led to the creation of the massive National Security Department his cousin now heads.
[01:54:16.939 --> 01:54:22.841]  This is exactly the kind of journalism one would expect to find in a dictatorship like that of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
[01:54:23.641 --> 01:54:27.523]  Because the manager of public relations for Popular Mechanics didn't respond.
[01:54:27.823 --> 01:54:29.304]  Repeated call from American Free Press.
[01:54:29.704 --> 01:54:35.727]  I called Benjamin Chertoff, the magazine's senior researcher, that's in quotes, 25-year-old bumbler, directly.
[01:54:36.107 --> 01:54:39.388]  Chertoff said he was the senior researcher of the piece.
[01:54:39.428 --> 01:54:43.010]  When asked if he was related to Michael Chertoff, he said, I don't know.
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:45.911]  Clearly uncomfortable about discussing the matter further.
[01:54:46.191 --> 01:54:51.532]  He told me that all questions about the article should be put to his publicist, the one who never answers the phone.
[01:54:52.032 --> 01:54:56.254]  Benjamin's mother, in New York however, was much more willing to talk.
[01:54:56.734 --> 01:54:59.674]  Asked if Benjamin was related to the new Secretary of Homeland Security.
[01:55:00.035 --> 01:55:01.795]  Judy said, yes of course!
[01:55:02.255 --> 01:55:03.376]  He is a cousin!
[01:55:05.096 --> 01:55:06.977]  Yes of course he is!
[01:55:07.077 --> 01:55:08.837]  Of course he is!
[01:55:10.537 --> 01:55:12.138]  This guy's got the classic M.O.
[01:55:13.646 --> 01:55:24.293]  24 years old, 23 when he was first in Iraq, reporting for the New World Order, then he comes back and lands the big job at Popular Mechanics!
[01:55:26.635 --> 01:55:35.441]  And, uh, running around, I mean, regardless, folks, if he is Chertoff's, uh, blood, and it fits the bill, I mean, this is clear conflict of interest.
[01:55:35.921 --> 01:55:36.602]  Very clear.
[01:55:37.382 --> 01:55:41.565]  And next hour, I'm giving the phone number out to Popular Mechanics!
[01:55:42.386 --> 01:55:42.926]  Be polite!
[01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:51.457]  Ask for all their different editors, ask for Megs, and ask for Charity, or let's use his Russian name, Son of the Devil.
[01:55:52.098 --> 01:55:53.959]  And that's what it means, reportedly.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:00.185]  And just call them up and just say, you working for Homeland Security?
[01:56:00.205 --> 01:56:02.347]  Need to get the blogs going on this.
[01:56:02.727 --> 01:56:03.968]  This is a serious issue!
[01:56:05.569 --> 01:56:09.133]  Maybe we're on to something like the Gannon situation with more of these plants.
[01:56:09.173 --> 01:56:09.613]  Who knows?
[01:56:09.633 --> 01:56:10.534]  But it fits the M.O.
[01:56:11.525 --> 01:56:12.526]  I think we're on to something.
[01:56:12.566 --> 01:56:22.091]  My nose, my snout is rarely wrong with this evidence here, smells a big gigantic rotten rat under the floorboards.
[01:56:22.592 --> 01:56:25.694]  So I suggest we pull the floorboards up and investigate.
[01:56:26.634 --> 01:56:34.339]  Though it is rancid and stinky, we have to, as the hound dogs we are, we have to go after our quarry.
[01:56:35.345 --> 01:56:38.266]  Fearlessly, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
[01:56:38.727 --> 01:56:41.088]  We're good little attack dogs for freedom.
[01:56:41.608 --> 01:56:43.089]  And you want to play hardball?
[01:56:43.489 --> 01:56:48.671]  We're going to play hardball with you for... I'm launching a five-year campaign.
[01:56:49.272 --> 01:56:49.732]  I've decided.
[01:56:50.212 --> 01:56:50.993]  Yes, five years.
[01:56:51.073 --> 01:56:53.154]  Five years you will routinely be investigated and exposed.
[01:56:53.174 --> 01:56:53.574]  Thank you.
[01:56:54.014 --> 01:56:56.835]  Alright, we're going to start the third hour.
[01:56:56.855 --> 01:57:02.218]  And I know it's dangerous to go up against the Homeland Security bloodline.
[01:57:02.238 --> 01:57:04.499]  I understand that, but we're going to expose it.
[01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:08.051]  We know we're on their radar, so they're attacking us.
[01:57:08.111 --> 01:57:09.391]  We'll defend ourselves.
[01:57:09.411 --> 01:57:10.751]  The best defense is a good offense.
[01:57:11.711 --> 01:57:13.632]  So that's my comments on that.
[01:57:13.672 --> 01:57:17.073]  I want to get a transcript for this upcoming interview as well.
[01:57:17.093 --> 01:57:18.433]  I want to thank those that do that.
[01:57:18.853 --> 01:57:19.613]  Get that posted.
[01:57:19.633 --> 01:57:21.234]  I will write a response in the next few days.
[01:57:24.815 --> 01:57:27.335]  We will continue to decipher all this.
[01:57:28.916 --> 01:57:31.096]  When you punch me upside the head, I hit back.
[01:57:32.796 --> 01:57:34.717]  You amateur
[01:57:36.284 --> 01:57:36.905]  Amateur?
[01:57:36.985 --> 01:57:37.526]  Lightweight?
[01:57:38.146 --> 01:57:38.967]  Prepare yourself!
[01:57:39.007 --> 01:57:39.808]  You wanna engage?
[01:57:39.828 --> 01:57:40.348]  You're gonna get it!
[01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:41.269]  Big Brother.
[01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:42.130]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:52.706 --> 01:57:53.787]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.447 --> 01:57:55.328]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.028 --> 01:57:56.949]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.429 --> 01:58:01.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.792 --> 01:58:05.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.377 --> 01:58:17.563]  I've been attacked savagely by the Washington Post, New York Times, and I probably devoted five minutes to each article.
[01:58:19.764 --> 01:58:21.766]  I probably devoted twenty minutes when
[01:58:22.811 --> 01:58:35.556]  Lionel Chetwin, the big award-winning director and the head of Homeland Security's operations taking over Hollywood, according to the Associated Press, threatened me, my wife, in a bathroom.
[01:58:35.576 --> 01:58:38.337]  He just said, we're going to get you, and then admitted it in front of witnesses.
[01:58:38.798 --> 01:58:51.983]  But I've been spending a couple hours on Benjamin Chertoff, reportedly, according to his mommy, cousins to the Homeland Security Director, and this hit piece of popular propaganda, I mean science and mechanics, because
[01:58:53.231 --> 01:59:13.701]  He goes into fake reporters, controlled reporters, influence peddlers, the Hearst, I mean, who wrote the book on yellow journalism, the lies, they told me it was not a hit piece, the sniveling, bumbling of this individual, now going on the radio and attacking me and others for hours over the weekend, I'm not going to lay down for it.
[01:59:14.662 --> 01:59:19.484]  I am not going to, this guy, I've challenged him and his boss repeatedly to come on this show.
[01:59:20.183 --> 01:59:21.764]  And they have refused to come on.
[01:59:21.824 --> 01:59:26.605]  But then he'd get on the air and say, Mr. Jones, he's to call in and defend himself while I'm asleep.
[01:59:27.505 --> 01:59:28.586]  On coast-to-coast AM.
[01:59:28.866 --> 01:59:35.808]  He's to call in and defend himself, and if he doesn't call in and defend himself, well that just shows that he just isn't, you know, that he's afraid.
[01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:37.148]  He can't refute these facts.
[01:59:37.508 --> 01:59:38.929]  And then, oh, he never called in!
[01:59:38.949 --> 01:59:45.691]  Uh, so, when in truth, I've been challenging this young punk to come on here and do it.
[01:59:46.563 --> 02:00:00.069]  Joining us is respected researcher and journalist Christopher Bolin for American Free Press, Turtov's cousin, penned Popular Mechanics 9-11 hit piece, and to delve into this with us is Christopher Bolin.
[02:00:00.089 --> 02:00:01.350]  Christopher, honored to have you.
[02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:02.170]  Thank you.
[02:00:03.631 --> 02:00:10.474]  A lot of stations carry the news right now, so we'll have to recap whatever we say coming up in the next segment, but let's get into this piece.
[02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:12.070]  Sure.
[02:00:12.751 --> 02:00:18.255]  Well, when the piece came out, I noticed that the first writer mentioned was Benjamin Chertoff.
[02:00:18.835 --> 02:00:23.278]  And I tried to reach Popular Mechanics on a number of occasions to ask them.
[02:00:23.318 --> 02:00:29.923]  You know, the person who's supposed to speak for the newspaper is a man named Nathan Christopher, but he never answers his phone or his backup numbers.
[02:00:30.483 --> 02:00:36.047]  So I called Benjamin Chertoff and I asked him, you know, well, you're calling people like Eric Huffschmid and myself liars.
[02:00:36.728 --> 02:00:39.069]  And I asked him some questions.
[02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:41.331]  I said, by the way, are you related to Michael Chertoff?
[02:00:41.673 --> 02:00:43.034]  And he said, I don't know.
[02:00:43.695 --> 02:00:47.598]  And so then I just did a little research in the telephone books for Pelham, New York, where he went to high school.
[02:00:47.638 --> 02:00:50.621]  He graduated from high school in Pelham, New York, in 1998.
[02:00:52.002 --> 02:00:58.267]  And I found in the 1998 phone book for Westchester County, where Pelham is, that there was a Judith Chertoff living there.
[02:00:59.388 --> 02:01:04.533]  In the past few years, she's remarried, and her last name is now Dargan.
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:08.216]  But in any case, I called her up, and her number hasn't changed.
[02:01:08.686 --> 02:01:13.489]  And I asked her, you know, I read this piece in Popular Mechanics, and I said, um, is Benjamin Chertoff your son?
[02:01:13.509 --> 02:01:14.289]  And she said, sure!
[02:01:14.309 --> 02:01:16.330]  And I said, well, that's very interesting.
[02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:19.992]  I said, is he related to the great Michael Chertoff, the new Homeland Security czar?
[02:01:20.012 --> 02:01:21.633]  And she said, yes, of course, he's a cousin.
[02:01:22.674 --> 02:01:32.199]  And I listened last night, or the other night, to this show, this Coast to Coast Radio, and, uh, they really, uh, because I sent an open letter to Art Bell, that, you know, are you going to talk about this relationship?
[02:01:32.219 --> 02:01:33.620]  Because this is really egregious.
[02:01:34.201 --> 02:01:37.683]  To have a cousin of the man who is now hated?
[02:01:37.803 --> 02:01:39.563]  I think this is going to be a major scandal.
[02:01:40.604 --> 02:01:41.744]  I think this is going to be a scandal.
[02:01:42.085 --> 02:01:56.231]  It's pretty egregious, because this is the kind of propaganda that is done in dictatorships like the one we've deposed in Iraq, where you have cousins and brothers and sisters of senior officials writing propaganda to support the regime.
[02:01:57.629 --> 02:02:05.894]  Well, and this on the heels of Gannon, the man-whore, and all the fake reporters, and the Armstrong Williams.
[02:02:06.855 --> 02:02:07.135]  Yeah.
[02:02:08.016 --> 02:02:08.896]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:08.936 --> 02:02:11.358]  And this is really bad, bad journalism.
[02:02:11.598 --> 02:02:18.263]  I haven't, I'm going to address the essence of the popular mechanics piece this week, but just for example, look at what... Well, stay there.
[02:02:18.323 --> 02:02:20.804]  I want to recap your conversation with Ms.
[02:02:20.864 --> 02:02:22.886]  Chertoff, then I want to get into
[02:02:24.497 --> 02:02:25.418]  Your analysis of it.
[02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:30.221]  And then I want to tell you about my conversations with Mr. Chertoff and others.
[02:02:31.202 --> 02:02:34.585]  Because they swore to me this is not a hit piece, Mr. Jones.
[02:02:35.545 --> 02:02:37.907]  And they're a pack of liars.
[02:02:38.227 --> 02:02:38.848]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.126 --> 02:02:49.449]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:54.071]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.211 --> 02:02:58.574]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.614 --> 02:02:59.995]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.735 --> 02:03:01.736]  Panama.
[02:03:01.776 --> 02:03:05.980]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:12.986]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.106 --> 02:03:15.208]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.469 --> 02:03:25.798]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:31.485]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:03:54.732 --> 02:04:05.959]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.299 --> 02:04:12.022]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.262 --> 02:04:18.927]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.127 --> 02:04:25.932]  Black Berkey elements flow 1.5 to 2 times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:26.232 --> 02:04:27.993]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[02:04:28.253 --> 02:04:30.315]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[02:05:41.686 --> 02:05:43.147]  Excluding Maryland and New York.
[02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:50.371]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.011 --> 02:05:51.992]  Mainstream Media.
[02:05:52.765 --> 02:05:53.866]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:55.347]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.107 --> 02:05:56.988]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.668 --> 02:06:01.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:05.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.973 --> 02:06:09.735]  I see everything in terms of warfare.
[02:06:10.175 --> 02:06:11.356]  That's how the globalists see it.
[02:06:12.759 --> 02:06:23.861]  And I see Benjamin Chertoff, reportedly the cousin of the Homeland Security Director, in his hit piece as an enemy gun emplacement firing on our positions and our advancing forces.
[02:06:25.002 --> 02:06:27.962]  Their receding propaganda armies are being defeated by us.
[02:06:28.982 --> 02:06:37.024]  And because this emplacement has, well, is not well defended and has engaged in a shoddy attack,
[02:06:38.201 --> 02:06:49.692]  We are now rolling our information warfare howitzers into place, and they admit they've been hammered into the ground already by the, quote, people out there that read it.
[02:06:50.252 --> 02:07:02.383]  I don't think they've even begun to understand the concerted firepower of our entire raid forces against them by the time we're done with them.
[02:07:03.061 --> 02:07:04.621]  This will only make us stronger.
[02:07:05.142 --> 02:07:08.723]  We are going to take this enemy island, this enemy emplacement with the Infowar.
[02:07:08.743 --> 02:07:15.005]  We are going to lay siege to their propaganda and dismantle it piece by piece.
[02:07:15.945 --> 02:07:26.248]  And the reason I brought up the case of the White House male prostitute, male madam, you know, really working for the White House, paid through a website,
[02:07:27.205 --> 02:07:40.085]  And, uh, you know, in there planting questions, and it goes into the Armstrong Williams, and just all these fake reporters, is that if it is true, and I believe Christopher Bolin, American Free Press, that he is a close cousin,
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:46.242]  To Mr. Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security Director, Benjamin Chertoff.
[02:07:46.763 --> 02:07:52.005]  That is a serious conflict of interest, because Mr. Chertoff was intimately involved in covering up 9-11.
[02:07:52.325 --> 02:07:56.467]  He defended some of the biggest funders of the supposed hijackers.
[02:07:57.168 --> 02:07:58.988]  This is very, very serious.
[02:07:59.008 --> 02:08:02.070]  We've talked about Mr. Chertoff at length on this broadcast.
[02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:10.534]  It's Mr. Chertoff who says the President's above the law, just like Alberto Gonzales, the architect of much of Patriot Act 1 and 2, with Viet Dinh.
[02:08:11.278 --> 02:08:12.379]  And Gonzalez and others.
[02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:14.980]  So, very serious.
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:21.262]  And here's the headline from Christopher Bolin's excellent column that we have a link to on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:21.622 --> 02:08:25.164]  Chertoff's cousin penned popular mechanics 9-1-1 hit piece.
[02:08:25.704 --> 02:08:30.986]  Dictators like Saddam Hussein have always used nepotism to protect their secrets and maintain control.
[02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:33.092]  Look at North Korea.
[02:08:33.132 --> 02:08:33.832]  Look at Bush.
[02:08:34.453 --> 02:08:36.655]  When you have hereditary systems, you're in deep trouble.
[02:08:37.135 --> 02:08:45.061]  Like a dictatorship, the inner cabal that directs the actions of the Bush administration uses the same tactics to confuse the public and conceal the truth about 9-11.
[02:08:46.187 --> 02:08:52.150]  Dictators have always employed nepotism, the placing of family members in key positions, for one simple reason.
[02:08:52.531 --> 02:08:57.073]  Only loyal family members can be trusted with the secrets that keep them in power.
[02:08:57.553 --> 02:09:06.959]  For this reason, the shameless nepotism of the Bush administration should alarm Americans because it indicates that a dictatorship is encroaching upon the United States.
[02:09:07.619 --> 02:09:14.183]  The Defense Department defines nepotism as the situation in which relatives are in the same chain of command.
[02:09:15.396 --> 02:09:22.122]  And an egregious example of dictatorial-style nepotism occurred when George W. Bush won the White House twice, thanks to Keith.
[02:09:23.002 --> 02:09:26.345]  Swing state of Florida, where the presidential candidate's younger brother is governor.
[02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.307]  And again, his father, former president.
[02:09:28.587 --> 02:09:33.431]  In 2000 and 2004, against all odds, Florida swung decisively the Bush way.
[02:09:33.891 --> 02:09:38.395]  With Hyde, and of course Bush is related to Jerry as well.
[02:09:39.251 --> 02:10:00.326]  With high federal offices being given to wives, sons, and daughters of senior members of the Bush Administration, the Hearst Corporation's executives that publish Popular Mechanics Magazine probably didn't worry about the ethical considerations of hiring a cousin of Michael Chertoff, a former Assistant Attorney General and the new Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, a senior researcher.
[02:10:00.806 --> 02:10:11.239]  But the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics plumbs new depths of nepotism and Hearst-style yellow journalism, which they wrote the book on, I would add, with its cover story about 9-11.
[02:10:13.217 --> 02:10:14.837]  We will continue with this.
[02:10:14.917 --> 02:10:16.498]  Again, joining us, Christopher Bolin.
[02:10:16.538 --> 02:10:20.418]  Christopher, recap why you got interested in the piece.
[02:10:20.918 --> 02:10:23.039]  Obviously, it attacked you and others, myself included.
[02:10:23.479 --> 02:10:28.060]  And then, how you tracked back to Mr. Turtop's mommy.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:40.422]  Mr. Turtop said he didn't know if the Homeland Security leader, or Fuhrer leader, was his family, but mommy sure knew all about it.
[02:10:41.796 --> 02:10:43.698]  Recap what you talked about in the last segment.
[02:10:43.918 --> 02:11:02.034]  Sure, well what, um, you know, this piece in Popular Mechanics is basically the first time that the popular media, the mainstream media, has thrown down the gauntlet to people like myself and Eric Hochschmidt and Dave von Kleist and yourself, who are what I call the independent researchers, who are, you know, investigating this mass murder that occurred on September 11th.
[02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:06.438]  And now this, you have to remember, this was an example, this was a case of mass murder.
[02:11:06.877 --> 02:11:17.583]  At least 3,000 Americans died, and I just don't... And they hauled all the steel away, despite the fact that the firefighters objected, the families objected, went to Congress, just like Oklahoma City, just like Waco.
[02:11:17.803 --> 02:11:26.389]  Right, and then it was, you know, when the Bush and Cheney administration were adamantly opposed to any investigation... Then they tried to appoint Henry Kissinger!
[02:11:26.669 --> 02:11:32.152]  Then they said that they'd never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings, now we have THE memo being specific!
[02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:34.369]  Right, and they lied to us!
[02:11:34.429 --> 02:11:36.330]  I mean, this is why we're questioning!
[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:47.734]  And they said that the operation, you know, they couldn't investigate this mass murder in Manhattan and in the Pentagon because it would take away from their colonial war in Afghanistan.
[02:11:47.954 --> 02:11:50.435]  Now that makes zero sense to most Americans.
[02:11:50.935 --> 02:11:54.417]  But when I read this piece, you know, because this throws down the gauntlet for the first time in a big way.
[02:11:54.457 --> 02:11:57.117]  Popular Mechanics used to be a piece, I mean, a magazine I read as a child.
[02:11:57.758 --> 02:12:01.339]  And I looked right away to who wrote it, and Benjamin Chertoff's name is at the top.
[02:12:01.852 --> 02:12:03.435]  Uh, but it's alphabetical order, I suppose.
[02:12:03.695 --> 02:12:05.539]  But I, I then, I called up the magazine.
[02:12:05.659 --> 02:12:07.081]  No, it says he's the head guy.
[02:12:07.262 --> 02:12:13.793]  Yeah, when I, when I, when I, I called up, I called up, they have a publicist, a man named, uh, Nathan Christopher, who's supposed to speak for the magazine.
[02:12:14.449 --> 02:12:15.750]  Um, but he never answers his phone.
[02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:20.631]  I tried for a long time, but then I called up... Well, let me stop you again, and I apologize I'm jumping in so much.
[02:12:20.671 --> 02:12:20.931]  Sure.
[02:12:21.132 --> 02:12:25.433]  Here is his bio, posted on Popular Mechanics and on Coast to Coast.
[02:12:25.853 --> 02:12:36.117]  As research editor for Popular Mechanics, Benjamin Chertoff is responsible for upholding journalistic standards for the magazine, as well as ensuring all stories of Popular Mechanics are reported completely and accurately.
[02:12:36.857 --> 02:12:46.543]  And it goes on to say he is the senior reporter for the magazine's special March issue, 9-11, debunking the myths and lies, managing a team of dogged and intrepid professional researchers.
[02:12:47.004 --> 02:12:49.325]  Folks, he could hardly finish a sentence.
[02:12:49.465 --> 02:12:51.507]  I thought it was a fake interview.
[02:12:51.567 --> 02:12:56.490]  He was bumbling, and he told me this is not a hit piece, over and over again.
[02:12:56.530 --> 02:12:56.930]  Go ahead.
[02:12:57.230 --> 02:12:57.931]  Yes, I called him up.
[02:12:57.971 --> 02:13:00.833]  I got through to him, and I asked him if he was a senior researcher for the piece.
[02:13:00.853 --> 02:13:01.453]  He said he was.
[02:13:01.897 --> 02:13:04.839]  And then I asked him, you know, are you related to Michael Chertoff?
[02:13:04.879 --> 02:13:06.601]  And he told me he didn't know.
[02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:08.462]  He didn't say yes, he didn't say no.
[02:13:08.482 --> 02:13:09.643]  He said, I don't know.
[02:13:09.944 --> 02:13:11.565]  Which is, you know, one way of lying.
[02:13:12.326 --> 02:13:13.286]  Either you know or you don't.
[02:13:13.527 --> 02:13:14.487]  I do not recall.
[02:13:14.868 --> 02:13:16.269]  Yeah, he said he didn't know if he was related.
[02:13:16.289 --> 02:13:23.515]  So then, you know, I looked into the phone books of Westchester County, where he grew up, and he graduated from high school in 1998 from Pelham.
[02:13:23.775 --> 02:13:25.016]  So he's about a 25 year old guy.
[02:13:25.498 --> 02:13:27.179]  And he went, I think, to New York State University.
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:38.987]  But I called up to... I looked in the phone book, and there was a Jew of the Sheretoff, I think a single mother, living in Pelham, which is a very small town, north of New York City, in 1998.
[02:13:39.407 --> 02:13:40.688]  So I called her up.
[02:13:40.748 --> 02:13:41.589]  Her name has changed now.
[02:13:41.649 --> 02:13:42.850]  She's got a new husband.
[02:13:43.290 --> 02:13:45.992]  But I asked her, I said, you know, hello, Judy.
[02:13:46.072 --> 02:13:48.594]  I said, I read this piece in Popular Mechanics.
[02:13:48.614 --> 02:13:50.495]  Can you tell me, is Benjamin Sheretoff your son?
[02:13:50.515 --> 02:13:52.256]  And she said, yes, yes, of course.
[02:13:52.276 --> 02:13:53.617]  You know, every mother's proud of her son.
[02:13:54.392 --> 02:14:04.497]  And then I asked her, I said, by any chance is he related to Mike, you know, the great, I had it, you know, beat up a little bit, the great Michael Chertoff, the new czar of Homeland Security.
[02:14:04.517 --> 02:14:06.358]  And she said, yes, yes, he's a cousin.
[02:14:07.219 --> 02:14:09.180]  And that was what I really wanted to hear.
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:15.003]  But when her husband heard that she was revealing these state secrets on the phone, he's very protective.
[02:14:15.043 --> 02:14:18.865]  He came over and he told me, he took the phone away from his wife and said that I should
[02:14:19.466 --> 02:14:22.707]  Uh, you know, I should contact Benjamin Chertoff at the magazine, like he had told me before.
[02:14:23.127 --> 02:14:24.687]  And I said, well, I did, but he didn't know.
[02:14:25.447 --> 02:14:31.909]  And so, last night, or the other night, on Coast to Coast Radio, um, uh, he was also, again, being very disingenuous.
[02:14:31.949 --> 02:14:35.970]  He pretended again, saying that he didn't know if he's related to Michael Chertoff.
[02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:39.851]  And Art Bell supported him by saying, oh yeah, maybe you're the 14th millionth cousin.
[02:14:40.271 --> 02:14:41.851]  You know, like, so far removed.
[02:14:42.431 --> 02:14:46.192]  And Benjamin Chertoff said on the radio that his mother had told me he was a distant cousin.
[02:14:46.512 --> 02:14:47.033]  That's false.
[02:14:47.113 --> 02:14:47.713]  That's a lie.
[02:14:48.093 --> 02:14:48.933]  She told me he's a cousin.
[02:14:49.628 --> 02:14:53.356]  So, I mean, you know, they're still, they're still trying to hide this relationship.
[02:14:53.869 --> 02:15:00.774]  And Americans should be concerned about this, because this is a very egregious example of this nepotism and propaganda in the country.
[02:15:00.794 --> 02:15:01.514]  Plus, the piece is shoddy.
[02:15:02.115 --> 02:15:10.480]  I mean, they quote this spokesman for NORAD who says they never intercepted one plane except for Payne Stewart in the ten years before 9-11.
[02:15:10.761 --> 02:15:15.704]  That very same major is in the Associated Press saying 60-plus times in the year before 9-11.
[02:15:16.365 --> 02:15:17.285]  Right, right.
[02:15:17.365 --> 02:15:20.728]  And then there's another case where they talk about World Trade Center Building No. 7
[02:15:21.568 --> 02:15:24.269]  This is the 47 story building that... I brought that up to him!
[02:15:24.309 --> 02:15:26.210]  I said, Larry Silverstein says they pulled it.
[02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:26.891]  Do you want that?
[02:15:26.911 --> 02:15:29.192]  And he's just like, uh, no, uh... Right.
[02:15:29.932 --> 02:15:30.192]  Right.
[02:15:30.532 --> 02:15:36.915]  And the thing is, though, is that they say in the piece in Popular Mechanics that the front, the front, the south facade of that building was scooped out 25%.
[02:15:38.635 --> 02:15:47.339]  Well, just this morning I called up Dr. Gene Corley, who was the team leader for the FEMA study, the engineering study, that was done in 2001 and 2002 at the site.
[02:15:47.719 --> 02:15:52.761]  These are the people, the engineers, who accumulated, who gathered the evidence and put it together there.
[02:15:52.861 --> 02:15:58.043]  Look, I have the official New York collapse radius.
[02:15:58.063 --> 02:15:58.963]  It wasn't even in it.
[02:15:58.983 --> 02:16:01.664]  The building wasn't hit by the towers.
[02:16:01.864 --> 02:16:03.285]  And they say in the article it was.
[02:16:03.465 --> 02:16:03.685]  Right.
[02:16:03.825 --> 02:16:08.347]  And Dr. Corley told me this morning, he said that there's no evidence of that.
[02:16:08.923 --> 02:16:10.848]  And something else they do in the article, is they say that
[02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:23.012]  We say fire melted the steel.
[02:16:23.112 --> 02:16:26.315]  No, we say fire couldn't melt steel.
[02:16:26.695 --> 02:16:28.136]  It was the government that said that.
[02:16:28.176 --> 02:16:29.537]  And they go, oh look, they're wrong.
[02:16:29.798 --> 02:16:30.999]  We just said weakened.
[02:16:31.179 --> 02:16:34.622]  So they actually take what the government said and then say we said it.
[02:16:35.202 --> 02:16:35.462]  Right.
[02:16:35.502 --> 02:16:42.588]  And Americans should know that the official explanation for the collapse of the Twin Towers is that it was not the planes that caused the collapse.
[02:16:42.978 --> 02:16:46.521]  Nor was it the fires caused by the burning jet fuel.
[02:16:46.761 --> 02:16:48.582]  No, it's the secondary fires.
[02:16:49.063 --> 02:16:50.164]  They say it's the secondary fires.
[02:16:50.864 --> 02:16:54.567]  But in their article, they say it was the planes.
[02:16:56.208 --> 02:16:58.790]  So it doesn't even have the official government story.
[02:16:59.291 --> 02:17:00.171]  No, they don't have it quite right.
[02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:03.294]  But at one point they do kind of talk about secondary fires.
[02:17:03.794 --> 02:17:07.457]  But another thing is that this piece in this magazine, Popular Mechanics,
[02:17:07.975 --> 02:17:10.836]  It's a heavy bit of emotional manipulation.
[02:17:11.116 --> 02:17:17.278]  If you just read through it, it's like, you know, everything that you or I... How dare them do this to the families!
[02:17:17.378 --> 02:17:18.958]  How dare them do this to the families!
[02:17:19.158 --> 02:17:22.859]  When the families have marched around the White House with signs saying Bush did it!
[02:17:23.259 --> 02:17:23.500]  Right.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:24.780]  Right.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:30.502]  But everything we present is blurry photos and sketchy eyewitness accounts, and what they present is hard evidence and common sense.
[02:17:30.602 --> 02:17:30.982]  You see?
[02:17:31.882 --> 02:17:33.502]  And they use the word evidence.
[02:17:33.642 --> 02:17:34.003]  Evidence.
[02:17:34.083 --> 02:17:34.463]  Fact.
[02:17:34.483 --> 02:17:34.923]  Fact.
[02:17:35.023 --> 02:17:35.283]  Fact.
[02:17:37.108 --> 02:17:40.810]  Just like Ashcroft says it's an urban legend that he ever said weapons of mass destruction.
[02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:42.591]  He never said it, he told us so.
[02:17:43.071 --> 02:17:43.791]  We'll be back, sir.
[02:17:46.152 --> 02:17:51.715]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:17:51.835 --> 02:17:52.895]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:17:53.015 --> 02:17:53.896]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:17:53.996 --> 02:17:56.817]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:17:57.017 --> 02:18:01.882]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[02:20:39.241 --> 02:20:49.584]  This is Jeff Donovan and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostick.
[02:20:49.684 --> 02:20:52.825]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[02:20:52.845 --> 02:20:53.666]  Her name is Joni.
[02:20:53.706 --> 02:20:57.507]  She already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days and she was so excited.
[02:20:57.607 --> 02:21:01.348]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[02:21:01.548 --> 02:21:06.253]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[02:21:06.313 --> 02:21:08.115]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[02:21:08.135 --> 02:21:11.077]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[02:21:11.117 --> 02:21:19.906]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry, and as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[02:21:19.966 --> 02:21:20.907]  It's a great product.
[02:21:21.127 --> 02:21:23.748]  You're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[02:21:23.828 --> 02:21:26.969]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[02:21:26.989 --> 02:21:28.410]  You don't pay anything up front.
[02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:33.431]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:33.871]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:33.891 --> 02:21:33.971]  1-888-223-2838.
[02:21:33.991 --> 02:21:35.412]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[02:21:51.499 --> 02:21:53.300]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:54.141 --> 02:21:55.502]  Alright folks, so stay with us.
[02:21:57.783 --> 02:22:02.586]  But, uh, here out of their own Popular Mechanics article, it says, Intercepts not routine.
[02:22:03.066 --> 02:22:12.593]  It has been standard operating procedure for decades to immediately intercept off-course planes that do not respond to communications from air traffic controllers, says the website oilempire.us.
[02:22:12.993 --> 02:22:17.996]  When the Air Force scrambles a fighter plane to intercept, they usually reach the plane in a question of minutes.
[02:22:18.857 --> 02:22:19.197]  Fact!
[02:22:19.753 --> 02:22:26.177]  In the decade before 9-11, NORAD intercepted only one civilian plane over North America, Golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet.
[02:22:26.917 --> 02:22:29.859]  Now again, I have USA Today saying hundreds of times.
[02:22:31.259 --> 02:22:41.605]  In October of 99, with passengers and crew unconscious from cabin depressurization, the plane lost radio contact but remained in transponder contact until it crashed.
[02:22:41.665 --> 02:22:46.247]  Even so, it took F-16s an hour and 22 minutes to reach the stricken jet.
[02:22:46.848 --> 02:22:48.469]  USA Today says 18 minutes.
[02:22:49.967 --> 02:22:50.948]  AP says 20.
[02:22:51.388 --> 02:22:52.169]  I don't know what's true.
[02:22:52.949 --> 02:23:11.862]  But you can find the number that they didn't know for an hour and 22 minutes that the plane wasn't responding to radio calls because it flew out of Florida over Georgia and then out towards the west over rural areas and it was flying at low speeds and an hour and 22 minutes in they learned that it wasn't responding
[02:23:12.422 --> 02:23:17.025]  Then they launched F-16s, and they were there in around 20 minutes.
[02:23:17.065 --> 02:23:21.788]  Now that's USA Today, AP, Reuters, hundreds of articles were written about it.
[02:23:22.089 --> 02:23:22.849]  It's part of the record.
[02:23:22.869 --> 02:23:30.194]  Now listen, their own expert they quote in here as saying they never launched this is Major Douglas Martin, Public Affairs Officer for NORAD.
[02:23:30.494 --> 02:23:33.416]  Type Major Douglas Martin into a search engine, then add AP,
[02:23:34.737 --> 02:23:49.902]  Then add Fighter Intercept, and you'll get AP articles where he mentions the hundreds of times, the 68, I believe, I didn't bring the article today, I should have, I covered it on NPR, 68 times in the year before 9-11.
[02:23:50.803 --> 02:23:52.503]  So, I mean, this is insane, folks.
[02:23:53.223 --> 02:24:03.347]  And I sent the articles to NPR, they gave the editor Megs almost 17 minutes, gave me about
[02:24:04.082 --> 02:24:08.065]  Three or four minutes, two minutes of it with the interviewer talking over me.
[02:24:08.445 --> 02:24:10.767]  That's their idea of a fair interview.
[02:24:11.027 --> 02:24:16.632]  Going back to our guest, please continue, Christopher Bolin.
[02:24:17.592 --> 02:24:19.654]  Yeah, what do you want me to talk about here now?
[02:24:19.874 --> 02:24:26.799]  Well, you were mentioning these clear connections with him and some of the past writing he's done.
[02:24:27.099 --> 02:24:31.443]  Yeah, the thing that's very interesting about Benjamin Chertoff is that
[02:24:32.108 --> 02:24:36.350]  He was writing before, um, for, you know, his resume is online there.
[02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:38.191]  He mentioned that he wrote for Men's Journal.
[02:24:38.551 --> 02:24:45.634]  And he wrote a piece about a year, a couple years ago, um, in this Men's Journal, in which he ranked the 25 toughest guys in America.
[02:24:46.254 --> 02:24:49.556]  And he made Hillary Clinton the 25th toughest guy.
[02:24:50.216 --> 02:24:57.519]  And, uh, you know, this is, this shows a great deal of animosity towards Mrs. Clinton, who is, after all, the senator from his state.
[02:24:58.918 --> 02:25:12.021]  And this goes back to the animosity that exists between Michael Chertoff and Hillary Clinton, because Michael Chertoff was the prosecutor in the Whitewater investigation.
[02:25:12.041 --> 02:25:15.642]  And he was actually there to make sure it never got off into substantive issues.
[02:25:15.662 --> 02:25:16.422]  Yeah.
[02:25:16.722 --> 02:25:18.582]  And again, we're not saying we like Hillary, folks.
[02:25:18.602 --> 02:25:19.763]  It's just another connection.
[02:25:20.003 --> 02:25:25.884]  And it's very important that Michael Chertoff also was in a key position in New Jersey
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:32.184]  During the investigation, at the time of the first bombing of the World Trade Center, was that 1993, I think?
[02:25:32.284 --> 02:25:33.065]  Yes.
[02:25:33.545 --> 02:25:41.531]  When these characters that were allegedly involved in it, all of these Egyptian informants for the FBI, etc., were living in New Jersey.
[02:25:42.052 --> 02:25:48.416]  And then Ahmad Salam said, they told me to cut the bomb and drain the driver, they paid him over a million dollars to shut up.
[02:25:48.677 --> 02:25:49.557]  Right, right.
[02:25:49.657 --> 02:25:53.220]  He was paid a million dollars, he was a million dollar paid informant for the FBI.
[02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:55.021]  And the other thing is that
[02:25:56.505 --> 02:26:06.613]  Michael Chertoff was Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice at the time of the World Trade Center attack in 2001 and in the aftermath.
[02:26:06.993 --> 02:26:17.402]  And in the aftermath, you'll recall that many Israelis who were picked up as art students or as fake moving company employees were sent back to Israel
[02:26:18.295 --> 02:26:19.756]  Um, on visa violations.
[02:26:20.076 --> 02:26:23.237]  Now, these, these... And that wasn't even covered by Fox News!
[02:26:23.678 --> 02:26:33.022]  Many of these Israelis, like the ones who were photographed or caught in Liberty Park celebrating the collapse of the World Trade Center, their vans tested positive for two forms of high explosives.
[02:26:33.622 --> 02:26:34.863]  And they went through two tests.
[02:26:35.396 --> 02:26:41.559]  And yet these characters were sent back to Israel on visa violations without being properly investigated and interrogated?
[02:26:41.919 --> 02:26:43.380]  This was Michael Chertoff's doing!
[02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:54.845]  So you see, the Israeli suspects in 9-1-1 were given a pass to go home, where at the same time they picked up 800 Middle Easterners who had done nothing in relation to terrorism!
[02:26:54.885 --> 02:27:02.248]  And now we have a cousin who goes and does Iraq work embedded, now off attacking us.
[02:27:04.149 --> 02:27:04.809]  Pretty obvious.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:06.610]  Yeah, very egregious.
[02:27:08.211 --> 02:27:09.932]  Well, we'll talk about what should happen now.
[02:27:10.012 --> 02:27:12.753]  I mean, this is, um... They've thrown down the gauntlet.
[02:27:12.933 --> 02:27:16.675]  Honest scientists and honest researchers in this country have to stand up to this.
[02:27:18.516 --> 02:27:21.478]  They have thrown down the gauntlet, and they're gonna get a fight if they want one.
[02:27:21.738 --> 02:27:22.358]  They're gonna get one.
[02:27:23.099 --> 02:27:24.260]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:28.062]  I wonder if Mr. Chertoff will sick his cousin on us.
[02:27:29.442 --> 02:27:31.023]  Homeland Security leader.
[02:27:31.924 --> 02:27:33.785]  Guess we'll all be on no-fly list real fast.
[02:27:35.558 --> 02:27:36.498]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.938 --> 02:27:38.559]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.579 --> 02:27:42.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.281 --> 02:27:53.243]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:27:53.643 --> 02:27:54.944]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:27:55.124 --> 02:27:55.804]  Now check this out.
[02:27:56.144 --> 02:27:59.585]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:27:59.605 --> 02:28:00.946]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[02:28:02.546 --> 02:28:05.209]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:06.230]  Your health suffers.
[02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:07.131]  It's that simple.
[02:28:07.472 --> 02:28:09.254]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[02:28:09.434 --> 02:28:11.416]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[02:28:11.857 --> 02:28:19.786]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you could fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[02:28:20.246 --> 02:28:24.370]  For a limited time only, get a Garricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.

[02:28:26.051 --> 02:28:28.093]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:28:28.113 --> 02:28:28.874]  A Garricus Bio.
[02:28:28.894 --> 02:28:30.595]  Because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:28:30.615 --> 02:28:31.836]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:28:45.390 --> 02:28:50.615]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:58.862]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.102 --> 02:29:06.168]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.328 --> 02:29:07.609]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:07.689 --> 02:29:13.594]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:13.794 --> 02:29:18.878]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:18.978 --> 02:29:27.866]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.126 --> 02:29:31.428]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:52.627]  Alright, coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to give you the phone number.
[02:30:54.136 --> 02:30:56.797]  To Popular Mechanics, to the publisher, call them.
[02:30:58.317 --> 02:31:04.939]  I mean, Mr. Chertoff wants to get on the radio and go, Oh, Alex could call and defend himself right now and then hours later, Oh, see, he didn't.
[02:31:05.259 --> 02:31:06.960]  He can't defend himself against these facts.
[02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:09.820]  I've called them over and over again.
[02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:14.742]  I want himself and, of course, the editor, Meg's on here.
[02:31:15.862 --> 02:31:16.822]  I'll be polite to them.
[02:31:17.422 --> 02:31:20.543]  I want to decipher and dismantle their false arguments.
[02:31:21.704 --> 02:31:23.224]  Just all of what they've done.
[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:26.742]  We're going to give their phone number out if you have a subscription to these guys.
[02:31:26.782 --> 02:31:29.365]  I want you to call them and cancel your subscription.
[02:31:30.406 --> 02:31:34.569]  And as far as I'm concerned, Popular Mechanics' name is Mudd.
[02:31:34.609 --> 02:31:36.491]  They also have Popular Science.
[02:31:37.772 --> 02:31:40.654]  And I want to talk a little bit about the history of Hearst Publishing.
[02:31:40.694 --> 02:31:43.556]  I mean, again, they wrote the book on yellow journalism, folks.
[02:31:44.157 --> 02:31:50.062]  They were the ones telling the country that it was, you know, that the Spanish had blown up the main.
[02:31:51.047 --> 02:31:54.692]  I mean, they're just classic, classic big dogs in the New World Order.
[02:31:55.313 --> 02:31:56.254]  In the New World Odor.
[02:31:57.115 --> 02:31:59.739]  And they're not going to get away with it, Citizen Kane.
[02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:01.301]  That's not going to happen.
[02:32:01.341 --> 02:32:06.828]  Real quick, before we go back to our guests, in Pittsburgh, Lord Bush is about to arrive, the police are threatening to arrest
[02:32:07.378 --> 02:32:09.719]  The peaceful protesters there, and Adam is called in.
[02:32:09.819 --> 02:32:10.520]  Adam, go ahead.
[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:11.921]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:12.261]  Good.
[02:32:12.961 --> 02:32:15.263]  Yeah, we got down here a little while ago.
[02:32:15.303 --> 02:32:22.887]  Lord Bush and the missus are about to arrive at 3 o'clock to go over their faith-based initiatives here at the Community College of Allegheny County.
[02:32:22.907 --> 02:32:25.249]  Their federal takeover of the churches, okay.
[02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.929]  Exactly.
[02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:35.955]  Now, what happened was a group of protesters, about 20 or 30 or so, had assembled across the street, right across the street from where Bush and his entourage are going to be arriving when they get here.
[02:32:36.593 --> 02:32:54.307]  Now, campus security from the college and the Pittsburgh police came up to us on several occasions threatening us with arrest and basically herded the entire crowd of protesters about five or six blocks away from where Bush is going to be arriving so that they'll have basically no effect at all.
[02:32:54.628 --> 02:32:58.351]  I remember getting to protest Bill Clinton when he came to Austin three times.
[02:32:58.631 --> 02:32:59.772]  They didn't stop us then.
[02:33:00.352 --> 02:33:05.036]  They're now arresting people in other areas of the country.
[02:33:05.116 --> 02:33:06.037]  It's disgusting.
[02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:09.011]  And, uh, it's just indicative.
[02:33:09.071 --> 02:33:12.414]  I mean, the Fuhrer cannot see you protesting him.
[02:33:13.274 --> 02:33:17.957]  I mean, nobody's being, nobody's... That's why the media can show him pull up unmolested.
[02:33:19.028 --> 02:33:26.151]  I mean, nobody's been violent, nobody's been confrontational with the police, but the police are starting to escalate their behavior.
[02:33:26.171 --> 02:33:43.298]  I just saw an article in the LA Times, you know, the nurses group of 60,000 are exposing the things Arnold's doing, so Arnold went to a public showing of the new John Travolta movie, and a woman who wasn't even part of the group had come in her scrubs from a nurse to come see the movie, didn't even know the governor was coming, and they came and arrested her.
[02:33:44.659 --> 02:33:47.681]  I mean, this is what they do to Americans now, folks!
[02:33:48.101 --> 02:33:48.842]  And here's the deal.
[02:33:49.122 --> 02:34:00.648]  We're standing on a public sidewalk paid for by the taxpayers' money, and the Pittsburgh Police and Campus Security have both come up to us and threatened us with arrest for trespassing on private property.
[02:34:00.668 --> 02:34:06.932]  So now all the public sidewalks in America, I guess according to the Pittsburgh Police, are now private property.
[02:34:06.952 --> 02:34:09.913]  Sir, there have been people that have gone... Let me just tell you this.
[02:34:09.933 --> 02:34:10.954]  People have gone to prison.
[02:34:11.254 --> 02:34:13.175]  Thank you for the call.
[02:34:13.255 --> 02:34:14.076]  Call us back with the developments.
[02:34:37.893 --> 02:34:39.074]  I've got some video footage.
[02:34:39.194 --> 02:34:42.537]  I'll upload it to the web and send you a link when I get around to editing it.
[02:34:43.017 --> 02:34:43.678]  Absolutely.
[02:34:43.698 --> 02:34:44.418]  Send it to us, sir.
[02:34:44.438 --> 02:34:45.359]  We'll put it on the server.
[02:34:45.399 --> 02:34:45.719]  Thank you.
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:47.380]  Great job, Adam.
[02:34:47.761 --> 02:34:49.422]  They are trying to arrest your callback.
[02:34:51.023 --> 02:34:51.544]  Unbelievable.
[02:34:51.844 --> 02:34:55.827]  Just going back to our guest, continuing with Christopher Bolin.
[02:34:56.799 --> 02:35:01.043]  Christopher, they've got to be getting desperate, and they're pulling out all the stops and attacking us.
[02:35:01.684 --> 02:35:08.871]  Yeah, that's what... I've been in touch with Eric Huffschmid, author of Painful Questions, and Dave Van Kleist about this, and also Phil Jahan.
[02:35:09.271 --> 02:35:11.693]  Because, like yourself, they're mentioned in the article.
[02:35:12.054 --> 02:35:14.696]  And that's what the consensus is.
[02:35:15.637 --> 02:35:20.702]  I think that they're trying to, at this point, you know, they obviously have to try to claim the history.
[02:35:21.538 --> 02:35:22.658]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[02:35:23.059 --> 02:35:40.464]  And they're trying to manipulate, emotionally manipulate Americans into accepting this rewrite, their rewrite in Popular Mechanics, where Americans really need to look at the evidence that's presented, the real evidence in books like Painful Questions and in Dave Von Kleist's video, and also what I've presented and what I've found out.
[02:35:40.904 --> 02:35:44.705]  For example, the first thing that they talk about is, where's the pod?
[02:35:45.045 --> 02:35:48.606]  And they show a photograph of the bottom of the plane, you know, a selected digital photograph,
[02:35:49.165 --> 02:35:52.326]  And they circle something that is not, that was never claimed to be the POD.
[02:35:52.706 --> 02:35:56.427]  But like Dave von Kleist says, the question is, what about the flash?
[02:35:56.727 --> 02:35:57.868]  It's the flash, idiot!
[02:35:58.048 --> 02:35:59.008]  I think that's his new piece.
[02:35:59.908 --> 02:36:04.430]  You see, it's this flash that occurred when Flight 175 hit the South Tower.
[02:36:04.470 --> 02:36:06.370]  Well, regardless... That's the important thing.
[02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:07.391]  What's the flash?
[02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:18.074]  What I cover in Road to Tyranny is public officials being warned not to fly, admitted, CIA insider trading, flying out the Al-Qaeda and Taliban out of Afghanistan, 8,000 of them,
[02:36:19.254 --> 02:36:43.293]  You know, New Yorker Magazine, Associated Press, I focus in on NORAD, did stand down, Dick Cheney was in control, they were running drills that morning, and I cover all that in my new film, Marshall Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, but really, we need to get the ball rolling here on Mr. Chertoff, but let me just give you this, for your article you're writing, on record, on radio, I'm telling you this.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:48.521]  He told me, and the editor above him told me, this is not a hit piece.
[02:36:48.581 --> 02:36:49.301]  We promise.
[02:36:49.501 --> 02:36:50.161]  Oh, no, no.
[02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:51.742]  That's not what we're doing.
[02:36:53.182 --> 02:36:56.263]  We're just getting the different popular ideas that are out there.
[02:36:56.343 --> 02:36:57.063]  We promise.
[02:36:57.423 --> 02:36:58.883]  We're just going to present this.
[02:36:59.344 --> 02:37:00.764]  This is not a hit piece.
[02:37:01.324 --> 02:37:01.564]  Right.
[02:37:01.724 --> 02:37:05.945]  And then every time, you know, like with Building 7, I said, well, Larry Silverstein, the owner, says they pulled it.
[02:37:06.405 --> 02:37:08.046]  He goes, he didn't want to see that.
[02:37:08.246 --> 02:37:09.046]  I sent them that.
[02:37:09.998 --> 02:37:10.158]  Right.
[02:37:10.178 --> 02:37:16.620]  And they would do stuff like call up and say, well we called the seismologist and they say they didn't talk to you or your person.
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:21.742]  I go, the article we have clearly sources you, Christopher Bolin.
[02:37:21.782 --> 02:37:24.762]  Did you ask the seismologist if they talked to Christopher Bolin?
[02:37:25.203 --> 02:37:25.483]  No.
[02:37:25.503 --> 02:37:28.544]  And I had to call his editor and say, you better not.
[02:37:28.884 --> 02:37:30.424]  See that's a trick they were playing.
[02:37:30.444 --> 02:37:30.764]  Of course.
[02:37:31.084 --> 02:37:33.085]  And they play all sorts of these little tricks.
[02:37:33.245 --> 02:37:34.345]  Of course.
[02:37:34.605 --> 02:37:36.426]  This is a real manipulative article.
[02:37:36.746 --> 02:37:39.647]  That's the most important thing and that's why I call it
[02:37:40.086 --> 02:37:54.159]  This is a classic in yellow journalism, and a classic case, and this is plumbing new depths, and I agree completely with you that this popular mechanic has to have their feet held to the fire about this, because this is such a distortion of the facts.
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:58.603]  You know, whether, in all respects, it's a complete distortion.
[02:37:59.958 --> 02:38:06.585]  So again, on the record, you talked to Mr. Chertoff's mommy, and she's like, of course he's family, he's our cousin!
[02:38:06.625 --> 02:38:07.526]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:38:07.666 --> 02:38:10.049]  And she told me, and then I asked, I said, what's his father's name?
[02:38:10.069 --> 02:38:11.310]  And she said, Larry.
[02:38:11.610 --> 02:38:20.500]  And Larry Chertoff, there is a Larry Chertoff who is the Chief Economist for the New York Environmental Protection Agency, and he's concerned primarily with water.
[02:38:20.973 --> 02:38:23.255]  With the water that New Yorkers drink and this and that.
[02:38:23.475 --> 02:38:25.276]  Now that's another issue in and of itself.
[02:38:25.776 --> 02:38:28.758]  But I believe that's probably his father, but I haven't confirmed that.
[02:38:29.179 --> 02:38:30.039]  But I want to tell you one thing.
[02:38:30.319 --> 02:38:33.822]  In this coast-to-coast radio show with Art Bell, there was an early caller.
[02:38:33.902 --> 02:38:43.208]  A caller called in from Pennsylvania, and she was very bright, and she asked the questions about the molten steel that I had found in the 7th basement level.
[02:38:43.268 --> 02:38:44.789]  That admittedly burned for weeks!
[02:38:45.329 --> 02:38:47.731]  Yeah, and this is something that's been confirmed.
[02:38:47.831 --> 02:38:49.032]  I was told by Peter Tully,
[02:38:49.437 --> 02:38:51.858]  From Tully Construction, one of the contractors who cleaned up the site.
[02:38:52.298 --> 02:38:58.140]  And it was confirmed by Mark Loiseau, who wrote the cleanup plan from Controlled Demolition Incorporated.
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:06.923]  And they discovered molten steel, in its molten state, when they dug down, when they scraped down and got down to the bedrock.
[02:39:06.943 --> 02:39:08.183]  Now this is very important.
[02:39:08.203 --> 02:39:11.504]  It's an oxygen-starved environment, and you're finding molten steel.
[02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:15.673]  And the caller asked about this, and they had three hours.
[02:39:15.733 --> 02:39:18.735]  These guys, Chertoff and Art Bell, had three hours.
[02:39:18.835 --> 02:39:21.097]  They said they'd return to it, but they never discussed that.
[02:39:21.117 --> 02:39:21.917]  Well, let me be clear.
[02:39:22.137 --> 02:39:23.178]  Let me be clear on this.
[02:39:24.499 --> 02:39:26.581]  You saw people jumping out of the towers.
[02:39:26.621 --> 02:39:28.782]  That's right when the jet fuel hit and was still burning.
[02:39:28.822 --> 02:39:33.426]  Then it burned itself almost completely out in one of the towers, to a great extent, in the other tower.
[02:39:34.688 --> 02:39:41.254]  And then we have the photos of hundreds of people in the gaping holes, where the main fires were, standing there for 20 minutes.
[02:39:41.714 --> 02:39:52.363]  Now it doesn't melt their flesh, but it melts 4 foot around solid steel columns, reinforced steel, sprayed with asbestos as an insulating agent.
[02:39:53.217 --> 02:40:01.040]  Then suddenly, that's so hot it won't even melt your flesh, but it melts the steel, then it all falls, and then there's molten steel.
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:01.880]  Right.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:04.961]  So again, common sense, folks.
[02:40:05.401 --> 02:40:06.862]  Common sense.
[02:40:06.942 --> 02:40:09.023]  Now, I want to do this now, and then we're going to go to some calls.
[02:40:09.123 --> 02:40:09.683]  I want to do this.
[02:40:11.384 --> 02:40:12.604]  Call them, be polite.
[02:40:12.684 --> 02:40:18.566]  The reason you're calling is because they've gone public and said all these things about us and about the investigation and what we're doing.
[02:40:19.226 --> 02:40:20.847]  You need to call them and say, look,
[02:40:21.545 --> 02:40:26.012]  Mr. Chertoff went on the air and said Mr. Jones, you know, can call in and defend himself, and he hasn't.
[02:40:27.374 --> 02:40:31.459]  Okay, and others can call in, but we haven't, as if you can call in on that show.
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:33.482]  The phones are jammed, there is no back number.
[02:40:33.883 --> 02:40:34.584]  It's just made up.
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:36.961]  He wants to say all this.
[02:40:37.041 --> 02:40:37.221]  No.
[02:40:37.661 --> 02:40:39.302]  This is the open invitation.
[02:40:39.622 --> 02:40:48.545]  You put Mags, you put Chertoff, you put any of your clowns here on this show so we can dismantle what they're saying on our own time!
[02:40:48.646 --> 02:40:49.046]  Wow!
[02:40:49.126 --> 02:40:51.707]  We'll defend ourselves on our own little show compared to these big ones.
[02:40:52.267 --> 02:40:52.627]  Okay?
[02:40:52.867 --> 02:40:54.228]  Alex, one thing.
[02:40:54.987 --> 02:40:58.273]  In the South Tower, you remember that the firefighters got up to the 78th floor.
[02:40:58.293 --> 02:40:59.755]  I said the fires were almost out.
[02:40:59.775 --> 02:41:00.456]  They were manageable.
[02:41:00.556 --> 02:41:01.297]  They were manageable.
[02:41:01.578 --> 02:41:05.824]  And so these secondary fires that were supposedly burning down... You said two small fires, yeah.
[02:41:05.864 --> 02:41:06.285]  Exactly.
[02:41:07.193 --> 02:41:08.334]  And this has to be remembered.
[02:41:08.494 --> 02:41:09.835]  These fires were not in Inferno.
[02:41:09.995 --> 02:41:11.997]  Well, they burned themselves out, remember?
[02:41:12.397 --> 02:41:19.542]  But then we had, on February 12th of this year, we had a similar building burn for 24 hours in Madrid, Spain, and not collapse at all.
[02:41:19.562 --> 02:41:20.883]  You know, everybody keeps saying 24 hours.
[02:41:20.963 --> 02:41:22.624]  It really burned more than 24 hours.
[02:41:22.684 --> 02:41:23.405]  Yes, of course it did.
[02:41:23.605 --> 02:41:28.889]  But it was burning like a torch for 24 hours, and there was no collapse of the central columns.
[02:41:28.909 --> 02:41:30.890]  100 foot white flames.
[02:41:31.611 --> 02:41:32.071]  Yes.
[02:41:32.091 --> 02:41:35.954]  100 foot jetting, blasting white flames.
[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:37.761]  And it's still standing.
[02:41:38.061 --> 02:41:38.661]  Still standing?
[02:41:38.681 --> 02:41:39.882]  Well, it had never happened before.
[02:41:39.922 --> 02:41:41.563]  And notice the media kept saying, it's going to collapse!
[02:41:41.783 --> 02:41:42.564]  It's going to collapse!
[02:41:43.264 --> 02:41:45.226]  Yes, that's 911 thinking for you.
[02:41:45.346 --> 02:41:47.187]  Okay, we were about to go to Randy, but he just hung up.
[02:41:47.227 --> 02:41:51.850]  Before we go to Randy, before we do that, I'm going to give these numbers out.
[02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:52.630]  Please call them.
[02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:56.053]  Be polite, because the poor person answering the phone, they're not part of this.
[02:41:57.193 --> 02:42:02.177]  But you need to let them know that we're very serious about this.
[02:42:03.709 --> 02:42:07.616]  You need, you know, Megs, their main editor, gets up there and says we've disgraced the families.
[02:42:08.037 --> 02:42:09.960]  Most of the families think the government did it, by the way.
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:13.706]  They've stood up in 9-11 commission hearings and gotten in their face.
[02:42:14.358 --> 02:42:16.038]  They've been told to shut up or no money.
[02:42:16.618 --> 02:42:17.599]  Give them a call.
[02:42:17.699 --> 02:42:22.320]  Now, here, first off, ladies and gentlemen, is their fax number.
[02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:23.240]  Fax them.
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:23.520]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:23.820]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:24.480]  Give them a call.
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:26.501]  Send them a fax right now.
[02:42:26.521 --> 02:42:26.701]  2-1-2-5-8-6-5-5-6-2.
[02:42:26.801 --> 02:42:29.261]  And also, give them a call on the phone.
[02:42:43.388 --> 02:42:44.870]  And tell them you want Meg's office.
[02:42:45.711 --> 02:42:47.353]  Tell them you want Chertoff's office.
[02:42:47.373 --> 02:42:50.237]  And again, I have been challenging them politely to come on the air.
[02:42:50.257 --> 02:42:50.297]  212-649-2000.
[02:42:50.317 --> 02:42:52.119]  Here's the phone number.
[02:42:52.139 --> 02:42:52.179]  212-649-2000.
[02:42:59.938 --> 02:43:02.479]  You can call their subscription and cancel your subscription.
[02:43:02.499 --> 02:43:04.820]  If you've got a subscription, cancel it right now!
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:04.880]  800-333-4948.
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:06.280]  We're boycotting these people.
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:06.380]  800-333-4948.
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:11.642]  Give them a call on their regular office number and say they need to investigate Mr. Chertoff and conflict of interest.
[02:43:20.854 --> 02:43:23.295]  212-649-2000.
[02:43:23.315 --> 02:43:27.337]  212-649-2000.
[02:43:28.678 --> 02:43:30.319]  Give them a call.
[02:43:30.359 --> 02:43:33.280]  Their website is popularmechanics.com.
[02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:38.262]  They've now launched a blog with nothing but positive comments supposedly from bloggers.
[02:43:38.282 --> 02:43:39.923]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[02:43:40.223 --> 02:43:41.364]  Go in there and test this.
[02:43:41.904 --> 02:43:44.845]  Write your own comments, see if they'll deal with it.
[02:43:44.865 --> 02:43:45.065]  212-649-2000.
[02:43:45.085 --> 02:43:47.306]  Ask them.
[02:43:47.766 --> 02:43:48.467]  Letter to the editor.
[02:43:48.487 --> 02:43:57.070]  Are you going to retract the fact that you say one blame was intercepted in the ten years before 9-11 when you're very expert in the Associated Press and 68 times in the year before 9-11?
[02:43:57.090 --> 02:43:57.350]  212-649-2000 or 800-333-4948.
[02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:57.410]  800-333-4948.
[02:43:57.470 --> 02:43:59.171]  Please take action.
[02:44:10.845 --> 02:44:12.846]  Randy hung up, so let's talk to John in New York.
[02:44:12.906 --> 02:44:13.786]  John, thanks for holding.
[02:44:14.106 --> 02:44:14.526]  Oh, thank you.
[02:44:15.446 --> 02:44:29.950]  Just one thing, I had a farm show in our area that has people come in and I set up a booth for, it cost me 500 bucks, but I put up the 9-11 information and the energy non-crisis and the 200 mile per gallon carburetor and the Planet X and all that kind of information.
[02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:31.411]  Anyhow, they got said and done.
[02:44:31.431 --> 02:44:38.313]  I had one gentleman come up and he couldn't say that they dropped a nuclear bomb in Iraq, but he said, you know, we killed 20,000 Iraqis with one bomb.
[02:44:38.333 --> 02:44:39.633]  And he said, when I got to the bomb site,
[02:44:40.188 --> 02:44:42.249]  He said it was all glass.
[02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:47.392]  Well, that's like the General said, that the Republican Guard disappeared.
[02:44:48.292 --> 02:44:52.214]  And, Sonny, he didn't really come out and say miles, but he was indicating it.
[02:44:52.694 --> 02:45:02.219]  Also, just in reference, a couple things, like they're trying to split us to break us up, and not only are we being broken up, but so are the Chinese and so are the Russians.
[02:45:02.279 --> 02:45:07.422]  I mean, the one report that's out on the Russians is that one Russian captain stopped a nuclear
[02:45:08.032 --> 02:45:09.373]  Attack during the Cold Wars.
[02:45:09.814 --> 02:45:15.579]  There's good people over there also, and they ought to be aware of that, we're aware of that, and that they need Pete's to stop these warlord-er people.
[02:45:16.119 --> 02:45:23.766]  Also, the people that are being, uh, such as they had to collapse in the, uh, oh, um, yeah.
[02:45:24.266 --> 02:45:24.647]  Okay.
[02:45:24.767 --> 02:45:27.329]  The National Geographic show, where they collapsed the towers.
[02:45:27.629 --> 02:45:30.552]  They said, oh, we had two of our own National Geographic people die in that plane.
[02:45:31.152 --> 02:45:34.035]  Well, they had the congressmen be poisoned with anthrax.
[02:45:34.522 --> 02:45:43.945]  They had a congressional announcement by Rutherford out of California saying that they know that 9-11 was happening, that Catalina Rice would refuse to stop it.
[02:45:44.525 --> 02:45:48.727]  Those things do exist, and they are killing their own people, so people that are hiding this for them.
[02:45:49.227 --> 02:45:55.469]  Also, they were saying that the planes were in the background of the 9-11 attacks, there was jets in the background, so they were assisting.
[02:45:55.809 --> 02:45:56.889]  No, that's not true.
[02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:58.750]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:45:59.110 --> 02:46:01.151]  Jim in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:01.883 --> 02:46:02.663]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:02.743 --> 02:46:04.844]  I was just calling to you by, you know, Saturday night.
[02:46:04.884 --> 02:46:08.506]  Just another episode of All in the Family here in the United States of Nepotism.
[02:46:08.526 --> 02:46:15.969]  I can't believe, well, maybe I should, that Art Bell finally sold out, because I think he did when he wanted to get his movie produced.
[02:46:16.269 --> 02:46:28.535]  And just one fact that I want to bring up about all this, and, you know, they want to call people that have the conspiracy facts, they want to call us conspiracy theorists and kooks, yet they're willing to believe
[02:46:29.153 --> 02:46:32.835]  As Chertoff said, a hundred-ton plane can disintegrate when it hits the Pentagon.
[02:46:32.975 --> 02:46:33.215]  Right.
[02:46:33.355 --> 02:46:38.517]  Yet Mohammed Adda's passport can be found three, four blocks away from the World Trade Center in almost pristine condition.
[02:46:38.537 --> 02:46:46.541]  And that a man in a cave could have NORAD shut down, run CIA drills that morning, and have all these jets fly into buildings with total precision.
[02:46:46.601 --> 02:46:51.823]  Yeah, it was just another pacification show for all the suckers who want to believe the 9-11 story from the government.
[02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:54.231]  Alright, Tim, thanks for the call.
[02:46:54.291 --> 02:46:55.891]  Well, look, my problem isn't even with Bell.
[02:46:55.951 --> 02:46:56.851]  Bell can do what he wants.
[02:46:57.032 --> 02:47:00.033]  I appreciate George Norrie having me on, and that's an important venue.
[02:47:00.413 --> 02:47:02.113]  The problem here is Chertoff.
[02:47:02.734 --> 02:47:03.054]  Right.
[02:47:03.174 --> 02:47:04.094]  And his ilk.
[02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:06.735]  Comments to that, Mr. Boland?
[02:47:06.995 --> 02:47:20.480]  Yeah, I wanted to say that my opinion, I wrote an open letter to the 9-1-1 investigators in 2002, and I take a very harsh position of people who are involved in the cover-up of this mass murder in New York City and Washington.
[02:47:21.581 --> 02:47:34.431]  People who are involved in either obfuscating or preventing the investigation of this 9-1-1, or who then, like Benjamin Chertoff, take part in a propaganda effort to conceal what really happened.
[02:47:35.166 --> 02:47:38.887]  I find them to be of the ilk like the people who perpetrated this.
[02:47:38.907 --> 02:47:42.208]  Well, I only heard a little bit of the interview now this morning.
[02:47:42.228 --> 02:47:43.908]  It was three hours and I was out of town.
[02:47:43.928 --> 02:47:45.348]  I didn't find out until yesterday afternoon.
[02:47:45.988 --> 02:47:49.249]  But everybody I've talked to says he was just a bumbling idiot.
[02:47:49.629 --> 02:47:50.649]  Well, he wasn't so bad.
[02:47:50.930 --> 02:47:51.890]  It was four hours long.
[02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:53.410]  It started, it was four hours long.
[02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:58.591]  And they got into it big time after about 45 minutes into the show.
[02:47:59.071 --> 02:48:00.632]  That's when they pulled out my open letter.
[02:48:02.259 --> 02:48:04.941]  No, he wasn't so bad, but he's not a scientist.
[02:48:04.981 --> 02:48:07.563]  He's not a scientist, and he doesn't answer the questions.
[02:48:07.923 --> 02:48:12.647]  One of the main questions that I always pose to people is what happened to the central columns?
[02:48:12.907 --> 02:48:17.030]  The World Trade Center towers were held up by 47 huge central columns.
[02:48:17.350 --> 02:48:18.751]  What caused them to fall?
[02:48:19.031 --> 02:48:22.654]  There's no explanation presented anywhere to explain why they fell.
[02:48:22.914 --> 02:48:27.598]  And because they were the central columns that held up the gravity weight, the gravity load of the building,
[02:48:28.132 --> 02:48:33.519]  Without cutting those... We have the designer of the building saying to take multiple jet hits.
[02:48:33.979 --> 02:48:37.083]  We have the underwriters going public saying it's all a fraud.
[02:48:37.864 --> 02:48:40.688]  Mr. Ryan, I mean, it's just ridiculous, folks.
[02:48:40.868 --> 02:48:41.569]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.450 --> 02:48:52.274]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.594 --> 02:48:53.975]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.175 --> 02:48:56.376]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.516 --> 02:48:58.597]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.897 --> 02:49:03.820]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:08.202]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.442 --> 02:49:10.223]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.283 --> 02:49:20.947]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.087 --> 02:49:22.987]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:52:00.155 --> 02:52:04.538]  And remember, most of them are writing about cars and plants and cell phones.
[02:52:04.558 --> 02:52:05.299]  They're not evil.
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:06.520]  Okay?
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:07.861]  So don't be mean to them.
[02:52:07.901 --> 02:52:10.643]  Just call up and be serious and say, we want them to come on and debate.
[02:52:11.264 --> 02:52:15.066]  And stop your subscription until... Because they're calling us liars and evil.

[02:52:37.211 --> 02:52:38.252]  Brooke, go ahead.
[02:52:38.272 --> 02:52:41.333]  I'm guessing you might disagree with this, so I'm putting you on first.
[02:52:41.353 --> 02:52:41.754]  Go ahead.
[02:52:42.114 --> 02:52:42.874]  Hello, Alex.
[02:52:42.954 --> 02:52:44.375]  It's so good to hear your voice.
[02:52:44.555 --> 02:52:47.096]  You say you have family with Popular Mechanics?
[02:52:47.637 --> 02:52:55.641]  I have friends who worked for 10 years at Popular Mechanics up until this summer when they were fired.
[02:52:56.275 --> 02:52:57.776]  Yeah, I heard they got a whole new crew in there.
[02:52:57.976 --> 02:53:08.079]  They brought in a whole new crew, and to tell you the truth, Alex, all the people that I knew at Popular Mechanics, they were in their office on the morning of 9-11.
[02:53:08.239 --> 02:53:10.659]  They saw the planes flying into New York.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:16.761]  They saw the black helicopters that many people consider conspiracy theory and wacko.
[02:53:17.141 --> 02:53:18.642]  They saw everything.
[02:53:18.662 --> 02:53:22.623]  Can you get your friends in contact with Mr. Bolin?
[02:53:22.683 --> 02:53:25.104]  It'd be great to have former riders there talking about it.
[02:53:25.644 --> 02:53:28.107]  Alex, they haven't even gotten unemployment.
[02:53:28.427 --> 02:53:37.917]  They were told at 5 o'clock on Thursday to clear everything out of your office by 5 o'clock Friday and do not return or you will be escorted out.
[02:53:38.138 --> 02:53:41.141]  Okay, contact Christopher at his office.
[02:53:41.401 --> 02:53:42.823]  I do know they had a big shake-up there.
[02:53:43.343 --> 02:53:45.604]  Absolutely, and then Chertoff was brought in.
[02:53:45.864 --> 02:53:55.646]  But the other thing I want to quickly ask you is, have you heard about the murder of Edward Stern from Lazard Perez Banking Fortune in Switzerland?
[02:53:56.046 --> 02:54:01.247]  He was married to Beatrice David Well, who is the daughter of Michael... I'm out of time, unfortunately.
[02:54:01.327 --> 02:54:02.568]  I'm out of time, unfortunately.
[02:54:02.848 --> 02:54:05.108]  Paul in New York, last caller, go quickly.
[02:54:06.329 --> 02:54:06.929]  Thanks, how are you?
[02:54:07.089 --> 02:54:07.329]  Good.
[02:54:07.789 --> 02:54:10.050]  Alright, I just saw the movie
[02:54:12.352 --> 02:54:13.152]  that you just put out.
[02:54:13.332 --> 02:54:17.995]  I saw it on yourprisonerplanet.tv and I thought it was an awesome film.
[02:54:18.015 --> 02:54:33.322]  The thing that I don't want to know, and I've been emailing and I haven't gotten an answer back yet, is I'd like to get a couple thousand of these and I'm wondering if you can put a questionnaire out to see how many other hundreds of callers would like to buy a thousand of these tapes or DVDs.
[02:54:33.342 --> 02:54:34.763]  Let me tell you the number to do that.
[02:54:35.063 --> 02:54:35.823]  Call this number 512-291
[02:54:40.514 --> 02:54:42.896]  5750 for bulk orders.
[02:54:42.916 --> 02:54:48.941]  512-291-5750, or call the toll free number, they can give you that number if you missed it.
[02:54:48.961 --> 02:54:49.682]  Alright, very good.
[02:54:49.742 --> 02:54:54.907]  And you know, I've been doing my part with this Popular Mechanics, I've been putting deception dollars in every one I can find.
[02:54:57.089 --> 02:55:05.176]  And the other thing is, I'm hoping that I can maybe get your weekly updates on a DVD for my public access show as well.
[02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:08.270]  And I'd like to find out about that.
[02:55:08.330 --> 02:55:13.174]  Now, can I ask your Baltimore line about that, or is that something... No, I don't offer that at this time.
[02:55:13.214 --> 02:55:14.675]  It's just on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:14.775 --> 02:55:15.556]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[02:55:15.596 --> 02:55:16.196]  God bless you.
[02:55:16.497 --> 02:55:17.638]  Please get a bunch of the videos.
[02:55:17.678 --> 02:55:18.658]  Yes, we want distributors.
[02:55:19.059 --> 02:55:22.141]  I want to thank you, Christopher Bolin, writes for American Free Press, for coming on.
[02:55:22.381 --> 02:55:24.683]  We've got links to American Free Press and InfoWars.com.

[02:55:25.744 --> 02:55:26.064]  Thank you.
[02:55:26.104 --> 02:55:26.765]  Keep up the good work.
[02:55:26.925 --> 02:55:27.305]  Thank you.
[02:55:27.345 --> 02:55:27.726]  Take care.
[02:55:27.746 --> 02:55:28.026]  Bye-bye.
[02:55:28.616 --> 02:55:33.061]  Alright, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, speaking of the new film, it's out, two and a half hours long, my best work.
[02:55:33.341 --> 02:55:40.249]  You can order it via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, a hard copy, or call toll free and make copies of it, get it out to people, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139,

[02:56:08.694 --> 02:56:11.096]  Call Popular Mechanics and let them know they're not going to get away with this.
[02:56:11.836 --> 02:56:15.139]  And ask them if they know that Chertoff's a cousin with the Homeland Security Director.
[02:56:16.431 --> 02:56:20.994]  Serious conflict of interest in light of all this stuff that's been coming out about the nature of the controlled press.
[02:56:22.095 --> 02:56:26.017]  Again, the number to get my films, 888-253-3139.
[02:56:27.057 --> 02:56:29.559]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, standing up for the truth.

[02:56:35.362 --> 02:56:35.883]  Hello, folks.
[02:56:35.963 --> 02:56:36.103]  Alex...
