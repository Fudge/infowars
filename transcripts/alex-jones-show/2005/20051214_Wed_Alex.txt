[00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:06.424]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:08.125]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:09.947]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:11.428]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.553]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:21.996]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:41.596]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:43.956]  It is already December 14, 2005.
[00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:47.077]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.017]  We'll be here for the next three hours today.
[00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:56.118]  Paul Joseph Watson hasn't been on with us since he was in studio three weeks ago here in the United States.
[00:00:56.158 --> 00:01:01.199]  He'll be joining us from Sheffield, England with a report on a whole host of different issues.
[00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:15.741]  We're under martial law right now, and back in 1998, I wrote an article with Ed Homan called Martial Law Is Here, and it's a three on the Richter scale.
[00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:21.045]  Now we're at about a seven and a half, maybe even an eight.
[00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.846]  We are under martial law.
[00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.889]  The federal takeover is ongoing right now.
[00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.794]  Everything they plan to do, everything they've set up, every precedent they've tried to develop
[00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:48.247]  and uh... promote is now in place right now and it's creeping death now remember that when i saw but the homeland security director tom ridge three years ago on the c-span
[00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:55.854]  At a big corporate meeting with all these corporate bigwigs, he said, you're going to have to have an ID card to walk down the street.
[00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:59.215]  We're going to have militarized police everywhere searching you.
[00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.035]  What you see on the airports will be America.
[00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:06.816]  So it isn't a crystal ball that I have because I predicted all this.
[00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:07.997]  I just saw them say it.
[00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:10.657]  We wrote articles about it.
[00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:11.417]  We warned people.
[00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:15.378]  And then you've seen the examples in Miami.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.862]  Where the police just announced, we're going to go out and search you and look at all of your goods and check your ID.
[00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:27.544]  It has nothing to do with stopping terrorists, nothing to do with keeping you safe, it's just about training you to live in fear.
[00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:33.026]  I'm looking at an Associated Press photo, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:38.608]  Viper teams, oh what a nice name, patrol mass transit facilities, look for suspicious individuals.
[00:02:39.188 --> 00:02:40.769]  And they're nationwide, they're right here in Texas.
[00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.770]  And imagine, men in camo,
[00:02:46.274 --> 00:03:11.954]  in black uniforms, camo and black, with body armor, with Heckler & Koch MP5 9mm submachine guns, walking by the train in Houston, walking by the buses in New York, the buses in Chicago, all over the country, and staring at you and looking at you with dogs, randomly, does absolute
[00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.330]  We're good to go.
[00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:34.810]  The Department of Defense starts spying on you with physical assets.
[00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:36.312]  It's all right here in the article.
[00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:38.153]  And the military is quite proud of it.
[00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:41.576]  Anything you do is tracked by the military.
[00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:45.420]  Now, this has been going on for decades, and it's even in the article.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.022]  Finally, an honest story from MSNBC.
[00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:53.306]  And MSNBC says it's horrible, it's police state, it's martial law, that they've gone too far.
[00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:54.768]  But see, they're just throwing it
[00:03:55.488 --> 00:04:07.657]  In our face right now, but the border is wide open, and if you're a real Taliban or Al-Qaeda general, and you're captured by our troops, you're ordered to release them by the CIA director that calls you up screaming at you on the telephone.
[00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:08.818]  And that's all.
[00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.180]  They've been caught dozens and dozens of times.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.521]  They are government.
[00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.603]  They do work for the government to scare you into submission.
[00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:17.324]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.906]  So when we get back, I'm going to try to be calm and go over this.
[00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.968]  We are now seeing the takeover.
[00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:22.708]  It isn't coming.
[00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:23.649]  It's here.
[00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:24.570]  It's happening now.
[00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.075]  And they're just announcing it to everyone.
[00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:30.376]  They're passing a law here in Austin.
[00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:36.097]  No more free speech, no more protesting if they say.
[00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:41.458]  They're actually expanding the new Patriot Act and spinning it and none of the activists have picked up on this.
[00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:46.339]  They are expanding it right now and people haven't even caught up to speed on that.
[00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.540]  I guess I've got to write more articles on it myself.
[00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:51.262]  I mean, this stuff is all so obvious.
[00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:56.045]  They're moving against us right now, Red Dawn, in slow motion.
[00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:57.346]  Stand by for more.
[00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:02.189]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.010]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.073]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:16.137]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:16.457 --> 00:05:18.438]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:21.460]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.223]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:30.825]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:38.309]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.971]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:42.872]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:01.705]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:05.948]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.970]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.572]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:20.419]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:21.960]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.323]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:27.063]  We're good to go!
[00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.313]  Screams and Stagnant Ponds.
[00:06:47.493 --> 00:06:50.339]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.321]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:03.205]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:04.005]  have diabetes.
[00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:11.266]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:15.947]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:07:16.147 --> 00:07:18.968]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:05.417]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:09.001]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:26.608]  We've had just massive increases in traffic by listeners that don't listen on the AM or FM dial or on the satellite or shortwave, but listen via the World Wide Internet, the Web.
[00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:34.533]  So we've had some growing pains the last two and a half weeks, but thanks to the work of the folks of the network and others out there,
[00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:36.087]  I think so.
[00:08:50.854 --> 00:09:02.770]  Coming from Infowars.com and over the next few days I hope to add several more 500 streams just as backups for those that sporadically have outages.
[00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.194]  So you can go to Infowars.com right now
[00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:13.057]  And there's 500 streams there for you additionally to all the network streams that are up and going.
[00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:16.738]  And yes, we're going to be adding quite a few more streams.
[00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:19.699]  We're just upgrading a particular server right now.
[00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:24.101]  So all of the problems should be fixed.
[00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:27.001]  If you want something done right, I guess you've got to do it yourself.
[00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:31.183]  So that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:37.997]  For those that are tuning in for the first time, this is not a liberal show, it's not a conservative show.
[00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:39.838]  I am a constitutionalist.
[00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:42.500]  I defend the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520]  I am a patriot.
[00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:45.161]  I love America.
[00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:50.704]  I don't go off of what politicians say, I go off of their actions, their deeds.
[00:09:50.905 --> 00:10:02.311]  And I know for a fact that our two parties are owned by an international crime syndicate that calls themselves the New World Order, globalist, globalism, global governance,
[00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:10.100]  Interconnectivity, sustainable development, these are the little tag names this mafia organization calls itself by.
[00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:11.522]  And they're a mafia that took over.
[00:10:11.943 --> 00:10:13.565]  They're a mafia that bought up most of the media.
[00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:16.569]  They're a mafia that got control of our central banks and prints the money.
[00:10:17.438 --> 00:10:43.285]  They're a mafia that is basically into eugenics, and into purifying the race, and into exterminating, roughly, on average, when there's different reports, eighty to ninety-five percent, but we like to say about eighty-five percent, that's the average that we get from them, when they openly, in major publications, say their plan is to kill us, just as soon as they get us into compact, militarized, police-staged cities.
[00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:45.066]  And again, you'll see all this happen.
[00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:55.429]  Many of you won't listen today, but ten years from now, as you're being exterminated in your compact city, just remember, you gave up all your liberties, you gave up your freedom, they promised you safety, and it just got worse and worse.
[00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.490]  And it won't be, uh, Al C.I.A.
[00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:09.013]  to kickin' down your door, uh, it'll be, uh, brainwashed, drugged out stormtroopers who today are playing violent video games with zits all over their face, and, uh, tomorrow, we'll be taking you to a forced labor camp.
[00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:13.355]  Now, I'm not joking, I'm not saying this for effect, this is really what's going to happen.
[00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:14.035]  Do you understand me?
[00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:15.568]  Do you understand me?
[00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:17.249]  These people don't play games.
[00:11:17.549 --> 00:11:18.530]  This isn't a joke.
[00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.731]  This isn't a drill.
[00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:20.671]  This is the real deal.
[00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:27.796]  Now, understand, my friends, I have watched the congressional hearings with my two fat eyeballs.
[00:11:28.837 --> 00:11:30.098]  I have read Rex 84.
[00:11:30.218 --> 00:11:31.979]  I have seen the documents.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:44.328]  It is an admittedly classified plan to take over the country and to have the military-industrial complex take full receipt of the nation for the private interests that own them.
[00:11:45.157 --> 00:11:46.819]  Eisenhower warned you of this in 1960.
[00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.501]  It's now happening.
[00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.163]  They have slowly changed the military's culture.
[00:11:51.464 --> 00:11:53.265]  They have slowly twisted the military.
[00:11:53.506 --> 00:11:55.147]  They have slowly corrupted the military.
[00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.491]  For 30 plus years, they've been questioning the troops.
[00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.273]  Will you fire on American citizens in select units?
[00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:02.334]  On average, 76% say no.
[00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:06.900]  Some cases 80-plus percent, but the average is in the mid-70s.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.523]  Those guys get rotated overseas, are given deadly vaccines, are used like toilet paper.
[00:12:11.883 --> 00:12:21.170]  The sickos that say they will are promoted, are moved into law enforcement, are put into other positions of power over our lives.
[00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:30.176]  Some are evil, some are stupid, but most of them just want a paycheck and to exercise power and aren't too bright and just aren't realizing what they're part of.
[00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:37.497]  I have witnessed with my own eyeballs the military pulling citizens of Central Texas over long before 9-11.
[00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:42.420]  I, with my own eyes, have videotaped military checkpoints and drills.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.420]  Mike Hanson's done it.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.081]  I've made three videos about it.
[00:12:45.121 --> 00:12:49.023]  Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:58.108]  I've been to urban warfare drills where they're training to break you and your family up, to take your children, to take your firearms, to put you in a camp.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.880]  Now that was in the late 90s.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.701]  Those films are evergreen.
[00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:05.441]  They're more pertinent today than they were when I made them.
[00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:08.462]  Because you watch them now and it's all mainstream.
[00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:09.762]  It was unknown.
[00:13:09.802 --> 00:13:10.802]  It was unbelievable.
[00:13:10.862 --> 00:13:23.745]  People would watch Police State 2000 with the Coronado troop ship landing and disgorging 4,000 Marines and 4,000 other foreign troops and they actually thought I hired ships and helicopters and troops.
[00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:25.355]  We're good to go.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:51.825]  They couldn't believe the troops in their high-tech black and gray uniforms training to do this to us, now becoming the dominant uniform.
[00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.086]  They couldn't believe it.
[00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:54.207]  You didn't want to believe it.
[00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.088]  You think I want to believe this?
[00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.669]  You think I like this?
[00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:59.090]  You think this is fun?
[00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.551]  It isn't fun.
[00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:02.192]  It's the real world.
[00:14:02.832 --> 00:14:04.773]  You can't choose to not believe it.
[00:14:04.993 --> 00:14:05.694]  It is happening.
[00:14:08.343 --> 00:14:23.167]  But still, as the Delta Force and the Army did its training with foreign troops, and as they terrorized cities all over the country, firing into restaurants in Miami, and trying to bribe police chiefs in San Antonio, all on record, and as all of this happened, and crashing helicopters in Houston, and terrorizing people in old St.
[00:14:23.207 --> 00:14:30.329]  Louis, and on and on and on and on, and being thrown out of Charlottes, as all of this happened, people began to wake up.
[00:14:31.983 --> 00:14:32.864]  But let me tell you something.
[00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:35.205]  The Marshall Law is now here.
[00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:46.434]  When the Secret Service calls up a business owner of a coffee shop across from the federal courthouse in Memphis, Tennessee and says, no anti-Bush signs.
[00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:47.094]  Take them down.
[00:14:47.114 --> 00:14:49.656]  And the guys, I don't even have anti-Bush signs.
[00:14:49.676 --> 00:14:50.837]  Well, we're just calling everybody.
[00:14:51.137 --> 00:14:51.778]  That's your job.
[00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:52.438]  Do you understand?
[00:14:52.738 --> 00:14:53.859]  You'll be arrested if you don't.
[00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:57.602]  So he went and put a sign up saying that George Bush's people told me.
[00:14:57.702 --> 00:15:00.244]  And then it came out that this was happening nationwide.
[00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:14.452]  When the Secret Service arrests people, give the police orders to arrest people, because they're not in a free speech zone, standing there with a sign, and it's selectively done with 500 Bush supporters who are left alone, that's martial law, baby.
[00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:15.673]  Okay?
[00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:18.575]  This is all martial law.
[00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.798]  But it's what degree of martial law?
[00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:24.139]  Well, there's been a substantive acceleration.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.420]  So here's your headline.
[00:15:26.681 --> 00:15:29.624]  America now under martial law.
[00:15:31.073 --> 00:15:43.657]  It's a creeping slow motion martial law but now it's going from slow motion to regular speed and as I watch the tape it's beginning to even fast forward.
[00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:47.178]  So we're hitting that flash point right now.
[00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:51.900]  All over the country they're passing city ordinances.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.902]  I'm getting more details of the new one here in Austin that I've been reading about where it's a new order
[00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:00.216]  Rule.
[00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:03.417]  Just, oh, if we say your protest isn't orderly, we arrest you all.
[00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:05.658]  Or if, oh, we don't like your protest, we arrest you.
[00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:08.019]  Or if you're anywhere else, we're just going to maintain order.
[00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:09.419]  What is this all about?
[00:16:09.819 --> 00:16:23.344]  Why is the Secret Service getting the new Patriot Act, about to pass this week, actually expanded and beefed up to where any event they want, anywhere, with any individual under their protection, they can just randomly, anywhere, tell you there's no right to demonstrate or protest.
[00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:27.543]  Again, the end of America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:27.923 --> 00:16:29.024]  Why are they gearing up?
[00:16:29.164 --> 00:16:30.185]  What are they planning?
[00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:34.448]  What do they know is going to happen that we're not going to put up with, that we're not going to go along with?
[00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:45.157]  And the answer is the implosion of the dollar, the implosion of the economy, the national draft, another terror attack that will launch World War IV.
[00:16:45.217 --> 00:16:47.519]  The Cold War was World War III, according to their historians.
[00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.311]  And then I see articles like this.
[00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:56.256]  Viper teams patrol mass transit facilities, look for suspicious individuals.
[00:16:56.776 --> 00:17:11.008]  Images of men in military outfits, federal police, federal militarized police, federal troops, marching in Houston, and in a list of a bunch of other cities, aiming machine guns at American citizens while the border stays wide open.
[00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:13.090]  This is martial law.
[00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.271]  Federal troops.
[00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:16.182]  Federal Air Marshal.
[00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:21.144]  See, you wonder why they got $24,000 a year more starting pay on top of what War Patrol got?
[00:17:21.164 --> 00:17:23.365]  You wonder why so many quit around half of War Patrol?
[00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:30.767]  Because they openly said it isn't just going to be on the planes.
[00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.939]  TSA is now trained.
[00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:38.921]  Remember at the RNC and then Bush's inauguration, TSA was in control?
[00:17:39.202 --> 00:17:40.182]  It's going to be everywhere.
[00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:41.042]  Shopping malls.
[00:17:41.062 --> 00:17:42.043]  They're going to train local police.
[00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:43.023]  Remember Miami announcing?
[00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:48.446]  Oh, we're going to dress up in full battle gear and go out and demand all your IDs and search you at shopping malls and banks.
[00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:53.488]  It's just literal roving squads of men in military outfits searching you.
[00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:54.849]  Line up against the wall.
[00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:55.769]  We're going to search you.
[00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.930]  Just random.
[00:17:58.062 --> 00:18:02.223]  Total... I mean, during the worst days of the Soviet Union, they didn't do this.
[00:18:02.503 --> 00:18:03.923]  They just came to your house and got you.
[00:18:04.143 --> 00:18:06.564]  I mean, this is just off the scale.
[00:18:07.184 --> 00:18:08.304]  Off the scale.
[00:18:08.324 --> 00:18:12.225]  About 2,000 less Border Patrol than there were on 9-11 now on the southern border.
[00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:14.585]  But you hear every night on Fox News how they beefed it up.
[00:18:14.805 --> 00:18:15.545]  Total bull.
[00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.126]  Just like they tell you, Bush's amnesty plan is an amnesty.
[00:18:19.326 --> 00:18:20.886]  Then they count on you not checking it out.
[00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.246]  They just love it.
[00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:24.927]  I'm trying to be controlled here.
[00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:25.927]  I'm so mad.
[00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:26.427]  It goes on.
[00:18:27.498 --> 00:18:39.465]  As of Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration said, it just said, teams of undercover air marshals and uniformed law enforcement officers were descending on bus stations, ferries and transit systems across the country to protect them from potential terrorists.
[00:18:39.765 --> 00:18:43.327]  We just want to develop the capability to enhance security outside of aviation.
[00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:45.229]  You think it's bad at the airport, folks?
[00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:49.251]  I told you, I saw Ridge say, nationwide, it will be like that.
[00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:57.331]  And it goes on, air marshals stepped outside of their usual role of flying undercover on airlines after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans.
[00:18:57.852 --> 00:19:00.193]  See, that was all a beta test, gun confiscation, all of it.
[00:19:00.493 --> 00:19:06.518]  They were sent to keep order at Louis Armstrong International Airport where thousands of vacuums converged after the levees were breached.
[00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.059]  The so-called visible
[00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:26.455]  Intermodal Protection and Response Teams, or VIPER teams, will patrol Amtrak's North East Corridor and Los Angeles rail lines, ferries in Washington State, bus stations in Houston, and mass transit systems
[00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:31.656]  In Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, and other cities.
[00:19:32.056 --> 00:19:33.176]  More details when we get back.
[00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:37.517]  And then we're getting more information on just who the military is watching.
[00:19:37.797 --> 00:19:39.137]  They're everywhere!
[00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:41.978]  They're all over the place!
[00:19:42.738 --> 00:19:43.718]  Watching you!
[00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.099]  And they're setting up neighborhood watch programs.
[00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:46.739]  The Pentagon is.
[00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:49.040]  And it's actually in the local news items.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.260]  They go, well, there's no real terrorists, so we're going to have you look for drugs, okay?
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.581]  Spy on your neighbors!
[00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:55.641]  We're the Pentagon!
[00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:04.581]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:20:05.327 --> 00:20:08.988]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:20:09.768 --> 00:20:11.229]  It includes the history of U.S.

[00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.131]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:22.051]  They are instruments of debt.
[00:20:22.331 --> 00:20:24.392]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:16.271]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:16.731 --> 00:21:23.456]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:21:23.856 --> 00:21:35.605]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:21:58.872 --> 00:22:01.835]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:06.380]  Did you know there is a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:13.187]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.220]  We're good to go.

[00:23:55.384 --> 00:24:04.313]  Imagine, Dallas, Texas.
[00:24:04.373 --> 00:24:05.294]  Houston, Texas.
[00:24:05.314 --> 00:24:06.515]  You're walking down the street.
[00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:10.639]  There's men in military garb with submachine guns, dogs.
[00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:11.520]  They walk up to you.
[00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:13.702]  Need to see your ID and identification.
[00:24:14.743 --> 00:24:16.065]  They're all former military.
[00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:19.006]  Been running operations at the border?
[00:24:19.527 --> 00:24:21.548]  And see, now you're an illegal alien in your own country.
[00:24:21.568 --> 00:24:22.068]  You're a U.S.
[00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:22.529]  citizen.
[00:24:22.849 --> 00:24:25.371]  The illegal aliens will walk to your left, walk to your right.
[00:24:25.751 --> 00:24:27.792]  They're untouchable, but you will fall.
[00:24:28.293 --> 00:24:30.274]  Fall into the grasp of the New World Order.
[00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:36.578]  I mean, this photo of the police dogs and these idiots engaging in these federal crimes.
[00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:38.179]  State crimes.
[00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:42.102]  It's a total violation of the Tenth Amendment to have this going on.
[00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:43.503]  It's so un-American.
[00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:47.817]  This hasn't happened since Reconstruction.
[00:24:47.877 --> 00:24:54.899]  My ancestors here in Texas actually threw the Feds out two separate times out of the Capitol.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.602]  That's why the Governor is a puppet in Texas and the Lieutenant Governor really has all the power, because the Feds continue to install Governors down here.
[00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:03.722]  I mean, this is just in your face.
[00:25:03.762 --> 00:25:04.383]  It continues.
[00:25:05.043 --> 00:25:09.604]  And they say that they're just going to be everywhere now, just overnight, no announcement, just boom!
[00:25:09.985 --> 00:25:10.745]  Hey, you're going to see
[00:25:11.992 --> 00:25:32.122]  TSA, Air Marshals, because they're not going to really be on the planes anymore, and now we've trained just thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of them, and they're going to be working with local police and these little MJTF, multi-jurisdictional, you know, federal task forces, and they're just randomly just feeding on us like great white sharks feeding on salmon or something.
[00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:33.443]  I just don't even know what to say.
[00:25:36.272 --> 00:25:41.238]  This is some members of the team will be obvious to the traveling public and wear jackets bearing TSA name on back.
[00:25:41.338 --> 00:25:45.523]  Others will be plainclothes air marshals scanning the crowds for suspicious individuals.
[00:25:46.023 --> 00:25:50.408]  TSA expects to find new ways to quickly deploy resources in the event of an actual threat.
[00:25:50.788 --> 00:25:51.990]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:25:54.349 --> 00:26:07.463]  Now understand, folks, that this is the equivalent, it's the same thing in Miami where they, all these cities are now announcing, not just Miami, oh, we're going to be randomly out searching you, randomly surrounding buildings and randomly demanding all your IDs.
[00:26:09.967 --> 00:26:10.927]  Just randomly.
[00:26:11.187 --> 00:26:12.447]  That'll stop terrorists.
[00:26:12.808 --> 00:26:16.068]  That's like saying, we think a terrorist is somewhere in the United States.
[00:26:16.468 --> 00:26:26.770]  So we're going to randomly, let's say go to Carl's Bad Caverns in New Mexico and surround the cave and make all the tourists come out and put their hands up and check their IDs.
[00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.191]  It's equivalent of saying, we think terrorists could be somewhere.
[00:26:30.731 --> 00:26:31.831]  Somewhere in the U.S.
[00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:33.731]  so we're going to go to Niagara Falls.
[00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:37.832]  Or we think terrorists could be somewhere so we're going to go to Walmart and
[00:26:39.853 --> 00:26:42.576]  Kansas City and search everyone in the parking lot.
[00:26:42.796 --> 00:26:44.818]  It's about training you to be a slave.
[00:26:45.278 --> 00:26:46.419]  It's about acclimation.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.300]  It's admitted.
[00:26:48.762 --> 00:26:49.863]  So this is martial law.
[00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:53.110]  They said they were going to do it.
[00:26:53.150 --> 00:27:05.198]  They said... How many times did we tell you how they openly said, we're going to train you how to learn how to be a slave, be searched, be prodded, you don't answer our questions just right, you're going to go to jail, at the airport.
[00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:06.499]  Now, the same stuff.
[00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:07.580]  Remember the FBI last year?
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.603]  They said, we want checkpoints and metal checkers at all shopping malls, and people laughed.
[00:27:12.963 --> 00:27:13.964]  Oh yeah, right!
[00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:15.805]  Folks, this will be the new economy.
[00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:17.326]  It isn't going to be General Motors.
[00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:19.227]  It isn't going to be Dell Computers.
[00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:20.108]  Do you understand?
[00:27:20.168 --> 00:27:21.549]  The new economy
[00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:27.212]  It already is prisons and law enforcement, but it's going to get, that's already the biggest, it's going to get even bigger.
[00:27:27.892 --> 00:27:36.076]  And that's what all the big news, the number one fastest growing and now one of the largest majors people are taking is homeland security.
[00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:39.437]  And they're learning how to be spies, how to spy on Americans.
[00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:43.279]  Listen, I've got the news piece out of Colorado.
[00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:53.040]  And it's happening nationwide, where they openly, it's in the article, in the local TV news piece, text, out of Colorado Springs.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.321]  But it's going on all over the country, not just where North Com and the dictatorship is based.
[00:27:58.321 --> 00:28:04.984]  And it says, well we're here to fight terrorism, and we're getting the neighborhood watch programs under a federal program of Secure Corps.
[00:28:07.064 --> 00:28:08.005]  And Citizen Corps.
[00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:12.246]  Now remember Secure Corps three and a half years ago, where it was in the Philadelphia Daily News?
[00:28:13.832 --> 00:28:18.036]  Where they were training the kids in checkpoints and warrant service and what are your parents doing?
[00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:19.757]  See, that's how we fight terrorists.
[00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:22.700]  See, there's no real terrorism in the classical sense.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.023]  So, terrorism is illegal drugs in your medicine cabinet.
[00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:26.963]  It's marijuana.
[00:28:27.224 --> 00:28:28.365]  It's family violence.
[00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:32.828]  It's literal, Stasi, East German America.
[00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:36.011]  And it's, you don't have to believe me, it's in the Associated Press.
[00:28:36.311 --> 00:28:38.834]  I'll never forget the one in New Jersey where it said that
[00:28:40.797 --> 00:28:41.838]  Well, fighting terrorists.
[00:28:41.878 --> 00:28:42.778]  We look for priests.
[00:28:42.798 --> 00:28:44.440]  We look for women that look like they're pregnant.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.241]  And terror is all crime.
[00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:48.943]  See, that's in Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[00:28:48.983 --> 00:28:50.784]  That they're about to, by the way, beef up.
[00:28:51.144 --> 00:28:52.085]  Why am I so frustrated?
[00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:54.106]  No one seems to figure out they're beefing it.
[00:28:54.506 --> 00:28:56.067]  No one's allowed to see the latest versions.
[00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:02.051]  And now we're talking to congressmen in the meeting and it says they're actually going to add new provisions and, quote, make changes.
[00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:06.594]  And those changes are where if you do anything they don't like, they arrest you.
[00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:10.597]  The Secret Service does, as a new federal police force, commanding
[00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:18.608]  These TSA goons, actual federal military goons, running around checking our papers.
[00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:22.274]  And folks,
[00:29:23.443 --> 00:29:25.064]  I mean, you can read it in their own articles.
[00:29:25.464 --> 00:29:28.046]  There's no terrorist here in our little town.
[00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.488]  So we need you to get in these local meetings.
[00:29:30.528 --> 00:29:31.308]  The army comes in.
[00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:35.151]  The army comes in and teaches them how to spot crime.
[00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:36.952]  Now get out there and fight the crime.
[00:29:36.972 --> 00:29:38.613]  You're all our junior deputies now.
[00:29:38.973 --> 00:29:41.254]  The military is in control.
[00:29:41.795 --> 00:29:43.576]  It's bad enough to have citizen spies.
[00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:45.697]  Now troops are in control.
[00:29:48.499 --> 00:29:49.400]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.381]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.637 --> 00:30:01.259]  Government of bats which governs me.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.101]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.244]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:06.684 --> 00:30:09.347]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:16.214]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:24.357]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[00:30:37.069 --> 00:30:38.510]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.030]  Have you?
[00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.111]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:45.312]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:30:45.332 --> 00:30:49.334]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:30:49.774 --> 00:30:50.835]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:30:51.415 --> 00:30:52.575]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[00:30:53.035 --> 00:30:56.657]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:04.675]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:10.980]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:19.687]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:26.973]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:27.273 --> 00:31:32.096]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:37.700]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.122]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:41.463 --> 00:31:49.468]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.488 --> 00:31:50.048]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:59.854 --> 00:32:02.595]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:07.897]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife-in-the-back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[00:32:07.937 --> 00:32:09.358]  But now, we don't have to.
[00:32:09.378 --> 00:32:17.761]  The Sacro wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[00:32:18.161 --> 00:32:22.103]  Simply line your back with the Sacro wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[00:32:22.363 --> 00:32:25.365]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[00:32:25.805 --> 00:32:29.267]  Use the Sacro wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[00:32:29.567 --> 00:32:32.948]  Get your Sacro wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.369]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:35.470]  That's 877-817-9829 and ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.595]  Yeah, getting older is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:46.096]  Get yourself a wedgie today.
[00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:48.538]  Specify if it's for a man or a woman, and call 877-817-9829.
[00:32:48.558 --> 00:32:49.759]  That's 877-817-9829, and give yourself a wedgie!
[00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.773]  I need to finish up, though, this diatribe about the military and the police and the open martial law.
[00:33:27.737 --> 00:33:33.563]  Just on record, remember 10 or 11 years ago, Alex Jones talking about martial law.
[00:33:33.643 --> 00:33:39.229]  Alex Jones talking about how there would be terror attacks and how they would set up a police state and how it would get worse and worse.
[00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:42.292]  How did I know all that?
[00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.774]  Again, so many people go, are you psychic?
[00:33:46.099 --> 00:33:49.023]  I was simply reading their own publications.
[00:33:49.123 --> 00:33:51.767]  I was simply looking at what the military was doing.
[00:33:51.787 --> 00:33:54.250]  I was simply aware of history.
[00:33:54.310 --> 00:34:00.679]  I mean, when Caesar finally became dictator in Rome, right before Christ's time,
[00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.330]  How did he do it?
[00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.751]  He brought his troops in!
[00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:05.331]  That was totally illegal!
[00:34:05.792 --> 00:34:16.815]  You could have the empire outside, outside, but you couldn't bring your troops across the Rubicon from the north, even into Rome proper, within hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles of the city of Rome!
[00:34:18.236 --> 00:34:18.876]  Into Italy!
[00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:20.617]  Into the heart of the empire!
[00:34:20.637 --> 00:34:22.938]  This is just, this is a no-brainer!
[00:34:23.758 --> 00:34:29.780]  How many congressmen, Bob Barr, Ron Paul, how many chief economists, Paul Craig Roberts,
[00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:36.804]  Morgan Reynolds, all these people on here telling you they're gearing up for martial law.
[00:34:36.884 --> 00:34:40.731]  We may actually go into a Soviet-style America.
[00:34:41.673 --> 00:34:42.775]  This is not a joke!
[00:34:45.248 --> 00:34:46.429]  And now the last three years.
[00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:48.671]  Martial law might come after the next terror attack.
[00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:50.212]  Well, martial law isn't so bad.
[00:34:50.252 --> 00:34:51.813]  We need to get rid of posse comitatus.
[00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:53.715]  Well, troops need to run your daily lives.
[00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:58.018]  And then all these former generals and experts who are still patriots go, that won't stop terrorists.
[00:34:58.278 --> 00:34:59.459]  Troops don't keep you safe.
[00:34:59.759 --> 00:35:02.301]  Troops are for suppressing entire populations.
[00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:04.783]  Troops are for holding entire areas.
[00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:06.825]  This is pure baloney, folks!
[00:35:07.345 --> 00:35:08.245]  You think Iraq?
[00:35:08.426 --> 00:35:12.467]  Look, the globalists are criminals who will lie about Iraq to get that oil and money and power.
[00:35:12.787 --> 00:35:14.268]  They'll lie to get control here.
[00:35:14.328 --> 00:35:22.932]  Don't you know that's how you get Pinochet's and Hitler's and Fidel Castro's and Mao Zedong's and Lenin's and Khrushchev's?
[00:35:23.152 --> 00:35:25.092]  That's how you get these people.
[00:35:25.132 --> 00:35:28.454]  They go, I'm in control, I got the military, I'm taking over!
[00:35:29.034 --> 00:35:54.271]  And they got a bunch of flowery propaganda, and they got IBM and Lockheed Martin all running public service announcements about how Big Brother's good and it's a great thing, and oh, when you go out to see the college basketball game or football game, there's going to be some local troops volunteering to search you, and oh, down at Zachary Middle School in San Antonio and schools all over San Antonio, oh, the Army's here to tell the kids about discipline and to search them and to walk them across the street and just to boss them around.
[00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:56.112]  See, it's all acclimation.
[00:35:56.152 --> 00:35:58.974]  Just hundreds of pieces of intel every week coming in.
[00:35:59.194 --> 00:36:00.555]  Military here, military there.
[00:36:00.755 --> 00:36:03.497]  Military and police uniforms doing SWAT raids with police.
[00:36:03.517 --> 00:36:04.758]  Delta Force doing raids.
[00:36:04.978 --> 00:36:06.219]  Regular Army doing raids.
[00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:11.322]  Giant Urban Warfare training drills from Little Rock to San Francisco with troops last year.
[00:36:11.362 --> 00:36:12.243]  And foreign troops.
[00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:13.624]  And foreign troops are here to help.
[00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:15.866]  And oh, Mexican troops are here to help with the flood.
[00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:16.446]  New Orleans.
[00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:17.567]  And oh, Dutch troops.
[00:36:17.607 --> 00:36:18.507]  And oh, British troops.
[00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.009]  And oh, well, the troops had open fire on people.
[00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:22.910]  Oh, we have to confiscate some guns now.
[00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:23.671]  Oh, well.
[00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:29.202]  This is all these different indicators, see?
[00:36:30.402 --> 00:36:33.143]  It's so hard to even integrate them all and cover them all here.
[00:36:33.163 --> 00:36:34.483]  It makes me so mad!
[00:36:35.883 --> 00:36:37.544]  I love this country so much.
[00:36:38.724 --> 00:36:49.307]  And to see classical wickedness taking over, to see the exact paradigm, wavelength, frequency, signature, by the book, I mean the textbook, take over!
[00:36:49.928 --> 00:36:54.789]  But in slow, calculated, deathly wicked motion.
[00:36:59.267 --> 00:37:22.563]  And so Viper patrols, Viper patrols, and they're absolutely, with federal grants coming in and commandeering, it's right here in the articles, they're coming in, you'll just have a squad for your city of maybe 50 TSA goons, who've already gotten their fangs a little wet, already gotten some blood.
[00:37:23.984 --> 00:37:28.147]  Why, the head of the military right now helped run the Waco operation, killing little kids.
[00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:34.078]  But these boys, you know, they just got them some blood out there in Miami with somebody having a Prozac moment.
[00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.239]  Turns out he didn't say bomb.
[00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.360]  Turns out he didn't do anything.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.301]  He was having a panic attack.
[00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:38.001]  They gun him down.
[00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:38.742]  They lie about it.
[00:37:38.962 --> 00:37:39.883]  Then they admit they lied.
[00:37:39.923 --> 00:37:40.443]  Nothing happens.
[00:37:40.463 --> 00:37:41.144]  They get commended.
[00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:44.026]  You see, and now I'm starting to think that was a PSYOP.
[00:37:44.086 --> 00:37:45.468]  I'm starting to think that was staged.
[00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:46.769]  Who are those officers?
[00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:48.130]  I bet those weren't even TSA.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.180]  I bet the boys doing the gunning.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.821]  I bet those are some special defense department boys.
[00:37:53.381 --> 00:37:55.421]  Now I agree with Paul Watson's analysis.
[00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.322]  This was a coming out party.
[00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.242]  Hey, we're going to kill you!
[00:37:59.262 --> 00:38:01.202]  We're going to set the precedent.
[00:38:01.242 --> 00:38:06.143]  We got over in England, a gunning somebody down 14 times in the head and lying about him.
[00:38:06.163 --> 00:38:08.424]  And it turns out Menendez didn't run.
[00:38:09.044 --> 00:38:10.804]  He got a newspaper and strolled on.
[00:38:10.984 --> 00:38:13.785]  And they walked on that thing and sat on him and executed him.
[00:38:14.784 --> 00:38:16.384]  Maybe he wasn't one of their operatives.
[00:38:16.925 --> 00:38:18.865]  Maybe they just wanted to set the precedent.
[00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:25.507]  Well, regardless, we're going to have all these trigger-happy goons who come back from Iraq.
[00:38:26.247 --> 00:38:31.308]  Come back from Iraq where they're allowed to just sit there off the side of the road, randomly shooting up little minivans full of kids.
[00:38:31.368 --> 00:38:32.448]  Oh yeah, we got video of it.
[00:38:32.809 --> 00:38:37.590]  Where they run over people's cars and they're caught out in the field, quote, stealing firewood.
[00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:42.491]  They shoot the vehicle and laugh and then run over it laughing in gang memberville.
[00:38:43.624 --> 00:38:50.690]  And besides, these young men would be Crips and Bloods and White Supremacists and White Supremacist Gangs if they weren't out in Iraq, so let them enjoy themselves.
[00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.154]  The dregs are now being pumped into the war effort.
[00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:02.380]  And mixing in a lot of good men and women in the middle of it, it's totally despicable.
[00:39:03.351 --> 00:39:04.311]  Totally criminal.
[00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.052]  This government is not our government.
[00:39:06.072 --> 00:39:10.693]  It is an illegitimate criminal operation that has been hijacked by criminals.
[00:39:11.133 --> 00:39:12.073]  I indict them.
[00:39:12.393 --> 00:39:15.554]  This is a declaration of independence against their martial law.
[00:39:15.874 --> 00:39:17.155]  We are the real Americans.
[00:39:17.255 --> 00:39:18.215]  They are illegitimate.
[00:39:18.515 --> 00:39:20.235]  They have seized control of this country.
[00:39:20.535 --> 00:39:22.496]  They are engaging in criminal activities.
[00:39:23.156 --> 00:39:28.061]  I have sworn an oath on air to the Bill of Rights and to the Constitution, and I will defend it.
[00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:38.310]  And you are larcenous traitors, whether you're ignorant, or whether you're on a power trip, or whether you're one of the sociopathic controllers of this, you are criminals.
[00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:43.215]  You are attempting to set the precedent for a larger military takeover.
[00:39:45.437 --> 00:39:46.298]  And then I have this.
[00:39:49.384 --> 00:39:57.346]  Again, I've been telling you for four years, the stuff in the airports was to go nationwide because they said so, and now they're doing it.
[00:39:58.587 --> 00:40:09.749]  Now, and I've videotaped the Marines long before 9-11, trying to break your family up and take your guns and put you in a forced labor camp, and Michael Savage calls for it every day.
[00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:17.372]  Secret database Pentagon spies on suspicious domestic groups.
[00:40:18.152 --> 00:40:18.832]  A year ago,
[00:40:20.149 --> 00:40:22.850]  A Quaker meeting housed in Lake Worth, Florida.
[00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.572]  A small group of activists met to plan a protest of military recruiting at local high schools.
[00:40:27.672 --> 00:40:31.114]  What they don't know is that their meeting had come to the attention of the U.S.
[00:40:31.294 --> 00:40:31.834]  military.
[00:40:32.454 --> 00:40:40.778]  A secret 400-page Defense Department document obtained by MSNBC lists the Lake Worth meeting as a threat.
[00:40:42.498 --> 00:40:47.980]  ...to the military in one of the more than 1,500 suspicious incidents across the country over the 10-month period.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:57.683]  This peaceful, educational-oriented group being a threat is incredible, says Ivy Gracho, a member of the Florida group called the Truth Project.
[00:40:57.723 --> 00:40:58.483]  This is incredible.
[00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:04.684]  And it says the group's member, Rich Hurst, is an example of paranoia by our government.
[00:41:04.704 --> 00:41:06.886]  He says, we are not doing anything illegal.
[00:41:06.906 --> 00:41:10.568]  The Defense Department document is the first inside look at how the U.S.
[00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:14.811]  military has stepped up intelligence collection inside this country since 9-11.
[00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:15.771]  Bull.
[00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:17.192]  They were raiding gun dealers in 1988.
[00:41:19.523 --> 00:41:28.571]  Marine Corps, Force Recon, and Police Uniforms, which again is set a precedent in Norfolk, Virginia, which now includes the monitoring of peaceful anti-war and counter-military recruiting groups.
[00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:30.472]  Yeah, you don't want your kid being threatened.
[00:41:30.732 --> 00:41:32.674]  You shy on the dotted line or I'll have you arrested.
[00:41:32.694 --> 00:41:33.835]  They've been caught on tape doing that.
[00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:35.897]  They call up answering machines and say that.
[00:41:36.297 --> 00:41:38.399]  They bully these kids who are dumb as dirt.
[00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:39.820]  Their parents are dumb as dirt.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.001]  They just drool watching TV all day.
[00:41:42.262 --> 00:41:46.005]  These recruiters swagger in, lie to them, sign them up.
[00:41:47.646 --> 00:41:49.948]  It's the 21st century version of press gangs.
[00:41:51.229 --> 00:41:57.793]  I think Americans should be concerned that the military, in fact, has reached too far, says NBC News Military Analyst Bill Arkin.
[00:41:58.073 --> 00:42:01.036]  Bill Arkin's usually pretty neo-connish, but he's even having to say it's bad.
[00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:06.539]  I mean, folks, this is just... And it gets into moms who complain about their kids getting recruited.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.421]  Well, the Pentagon drops, blah.
[00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:12.664]  The Defense Department documented, it's first inside look, blah, blah, blah, and it goes on.
[00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:15.933]  The Department of Defense declined repeated requests.
[00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.714]  I've had troops taking video of me.
[00:42:17.754 --> 00:42:18.615]  I mean, before 9-11.
[00:42:18.635 --> 00:42:20.136]  They've been out there forever.
[00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:27.904]  The Department of Defense, but oh, when they actually tried to stop the CIA double agents, the decoys, remember Abel Danger?
[00:42:28.464 --> 00:42:31.026]  Army Intelligence and Defense Intel knew exactly.
[00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:38.272]  And now what, they're going to indict the Army Colonel who went public and saying they knew who the hijackers were and ordered not to stop them?
[00:42:38.772 --> 00:42:38.912]  W-1-9-9-I!
[00:42:38.933 --> 00:42:39.153]  W-1-9-9-I!
[00:42:39.173 --> 00:42:39.393]  W-1-9-9-I!
[00:42:45.091 --> 00:42:46.533]  And then it becomes some political football.
[00:42:46.573 --> 00:42:48.474]  Well, Clinton blocked Able Danger, too.
[00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:49.636]  And so did Bush.
[00:42:49.656 --> 00:42:51.057]  So it's okay.
[00:42:51.077 --> 00:42:52.679]  Because they're both government.
[00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:54.340]  It's the same criminal enterprise.
[00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:57.403]  Does it make it okay because Bill Clinton did it?
[00:42:57.604 --> 00:42:58.845]  Or because George Bush did it?
[00:43:00.197 --> 00:43:01.338]  They're not running anything.
[00:43:01.638 --> 00:43:02.739]  Do you understand?
[00:43:02.799 --> 00:43:08.843]  The Army is not allowed, when they get intel, clear intel, this guy is going to board a plane and hijack it.
[00:43:09.163 --> 00:43:10.043]  Don't you stop him.
[00:43:10.244 --> 00:43:13.986]  Don't you even, you leave him at that flight school, you don't touch him.
[00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:14.406]  Why?
[00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:15.507]  You'll see.
[00:43:16.248 --> 00:43:17.989]  Because they were creating a history, a ledger.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:26.014]  The Arabs who were CIA and Defense Intel and a group even above that, that is hired individuals,
[00:43:27.017 --> 00:43:36.140]  They believed that they were part of a live-action drill to see, just like, you know, the Navy SEALs will practice taking over embassies or practice trying to get bombs on planes.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.060]  Well, they thought that's what they were doing.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.101]  I've confirmed this!
[00:43:40.721 --> 00:43:41.861]  We've confirmed this!
[00:43:41.881 --> 00:43:44.402]  Let me say it again, we have confirmed it.
[00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:48.043]  But Defense Intelligence, Army Intelligence didn't know that.
[00:43:48.663 --> 00:43:54.805]  And they got them so busy out sitting around, you know, sewing circles with little limp-wristed hippies eating cookies.
[00:43:55.945 --> 00:44:02.014]  They're out at these little socialist meetings, about as dangerous as a ladybug.
[00:44:03.315 --> 00:44:04.357]  Meanwhile, we've got
[00:44:05.262 --> 00:44:15.847]  We've got that every time they capture a Taliban or Al-Qaeda general in order to release them, every time somebody at the embassy says this is a terrorist, they're ordered, no it's part of an anti-terror training op, they're ours, let these men in.
[00:44:16.448 --> 00:44:22.491]  I have the heads of embassies saying they were ordered to let the supposed hijackers in because it was part of a government operation, anti-terror training.
[00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:23.231]  Okay?
[00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:23.731]  I have that.
[00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:25.112]  I've had the head of the embassy on.
[00:44:25.572 --> 00:44:34.737]  I have read the news articles and covered it and talked to the individual, but he wouldn't come on air at the time, but it's been in the news, the Defense Language School Dean who was forced to train the supposed hijackers.
[00:44:35.555 --> 00:44:37.416]  And he said no, George Bush is behind it.
[00:44:38.057 --> 00:44:41.339]  And then they threatened to arrest him and all that and then the story shut down.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.100]  Okay?
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.403]  So we've got them coming through the embassies and the embassies being told they're government agents.
[00:44:46.823 --> 00:44:52.447]  We've got the army intelligence and defense intelligence being told back off, it's part of a larger operation.
[00:44:54.554 --> 00:45:00.897]  Then have them train at the Pensacola Naval Air Station for their actual training, then creating ledger training at some of these other CIA fronts.
[00:45:01.517 --> 00:45:07.039]  We have them, we have them, and then we have actor James Woods on a flight from New York to LA.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.661]  That was stopping in Phoenix, the waypoint.
[00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:12.962]  And they're on board this plane.
[00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:16.123]  And there's these four guys, including Muhammad Adam.
[00:45:16.763 --> 00:45:23.386]  And they're getting up, doing suspicious things, wandering around, saying things, and he gets off in Miami, excuse me, he gets off in Phoenix,
[00:45:24.694 --> 00:45:26.774]  And he says, get the police!
[00:45:26.794 --> 00:45:27.315]  Get the police!
[00:45:27.355 --> 00:45:27.895]  Hijackers!
[00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:28.515]  Hijackers!
[00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:30.215]  Woods has never been known to act like this.
[00:45:30.435 --> 00:45:31.855]  He's a very professional individual.
[00:45:32.216 --> 00:45:33.016]  Very talented as well.
[00:45:33.036 --> 00:45:33.616]  I'm a fan of him.
[00:45:34.856 --> 00:45:37.997]  And the FBI comes to him and says, you keep your mouth shut.
[00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:39.977]  This is part of a national security operation.
[00:45:40.257 --> 00:45:42.218]  You'll be arrested if you say anything else.
[00:45:42.458 --> 00:45:44.178]  And by the way, you can't get back on that plane.
[00:45:44.398 --> 00:45:46.598]  And the plane just flies off with him on board.
[00:45:51.279 --> 00:45:54.200]  I mean, that's... I can go on for several more hours, would you like me to?
[00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.882]  Government operatives, do you?
[00:45:57.902 --> 00:45:59.543]  But no!
[00:46:00.003 --> 00:46:07.807]  Alex Jones gets to have military follow me around, take pictures of me in military, swagger up at meetings and say, hey, you want to do something violent?
[00:46:08.812 --> 00:46:09.973]  Now just go get out of here.
[00:46:10.013 --> 00:46:10.694]  Where's your car?
[00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:13.536]  I'm gonna walk over and videotape it and they freak out and drive off.
[00:46:13.796 --> 00:46:18.119]  Or I've had two of the guys get out of the TV station and go, Will, we hear you've been talking about your team.
[00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:18.780]  What's that mean?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.522]  I go, I know you want to get some operational funding to mess with me.
[00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:23.964]  By team, I mean my news team.
[00:46:24.304 --> 00:46:25.645]  I mean the team of people working for me.
[00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:31.450]  Don't try to, don't try to designate us as a domestic militarist group so you can mess with me.
[00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.791]  Get out of here, Clamano!
[00:46:34.338 --> 00:46:35.459]  This is before 9-11.
[00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:39.941]  I've been dealing with this scum for a long time and I'm sick of it!
[00:46:43.403 --> 00:46:45.243]  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves listening right now.
[00:46:45.323 --> 00:46:46.504]  You know all about Abel Danger.
[00:46:46.524 --> 00:46:47.685]  You know all about the MSEs.
[00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.225]  You know all about the Defense Language School.
[00:46:49.405 --> 00:46:50.846]  You see, that Dean's a real man.
[00:46:51.046 --> 00:46:54.428]  That Dean's a real American for going public and saying it was the government.
[00:46:55.365 --> 00:47:01.908]  I trained the hijackers in language, in code, at the Defense Language School.
[00:47:02.108 --> 00:47:05.290]  They had been given full intelligence agent training!
[00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:12.753]  And I'm supposed to ignore that while the military tries to stick a magnifying glass down my throat?
[00:47:14.494 --> 00:47:16.995]  You people make me sick.
[00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:20.897]  I'm sorry.
[00:47:23.331 --> 00:47:27.736]  This peaceful, educational-oriented group being a threat is incredible, says Ivy Gracho.
[00:47:28.137 --> 00:47:32.021]  And it goes on with the NBC military analyst saying it's very, very dangerous.
[00:47:33.223 --> 00:47:41.092]  And it goes on to say the Department of Defense declined repeated requests by NBC News for an interview with a spokesman who said that all domestic intelligence information is properly collected.
[00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.812]  Your cocaine shipments are properly collected, too.
[00:47:44.832 --> 00:47:48.655]  It involves protection of Defense Department installations, interest, and personnel.
[00:47:48.955 --> 00:47:52.318]  The military has always been a legitimate force protection mission inside the U.S.
[00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:54.861]  to protect its personnel and facilities from potential violence.
[00:47:55.861 --> 00:48:01.667]  But the Pentagon now collects domestic intelligence that goes beyond legitimate concerns about terrorism or protecting U.S.
[00:48:01.687 --> 00:48:03.088]  military installations, says critics.
[00:48:03.788 --> 00:48:07.692]  Four dozen anti-war meetings the DOD database obtained by NBC, and that's nothing.
[00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:15.775]  Includes nearly four dozen anti-war meetings or protests, including some that have taken place far away from any military installation.
[00:48:15.815 --> 00:48:16.576]  Well, of course!
[00:48:18.257 --> 00:48:19.377]  Post a recruiter center.
[00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:28.963]  One incident included in the database is a large anti-war protest at Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles last March that included effigies of President Bush and anti-war protester banners.
[00:48:29.263 --> 00:48:38.369]  Another incident mentions a planned protest against military recruiters last December in Boston and a planned protest last April at McDonald's, a national salute to America's heroes.
[00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:44.532]  The Fort Lauderdale protest was deemed not to be a credible threat and a column in the database concludes U.S.
[00:48:44.572 --> 00:48:47.133]  group exercising constitutional rights.
[00:48:47.153 --> 00:48:55.177]  243 other incidents in the database were discounted because they had no connection to the Department of Defense, yet they all remained in the database.
[00:48:55.597 --> 00:48:59.520]  The DOD has strict guidelines and it goes into this database.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.620]  This is a long article, folks.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.521]  I just read one page.
[00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:02.161]  There's three more.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.682]  They've got this database in here.
[00:49:06.742 --> 00:49:07.623]  I'm trying to find it.
[00:49:07.643 --> 00:49:08.684]  It's something watch.
[00:49:08.704 --> 00:49:09.945]  It's a person watch.
[00:49:10.825 --> 00:49:18.211]  And it hooks into the police departments, everybody else, and it's all your, what you surf, what you do, your digital algorithms, your biometrics.
[00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:25.997]  The DoD has strict guidelines, adopted in December 1982, that limit the extent to which they can collect and retain information on U.S.
[00:49:26.017 --> 00:49:26.417]  citizens.
[00:49:26.437 --> 00:49:29.499]  Still, the DoD database includes at least 20 references to U.S.
[00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:30.620]  citizens or U.S.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.061]  persons.
[00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:31.181]  Folks,
[00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:36.566]  It's illegal for him to torture people, but they do it to death and rape children in front of their parents.
[00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:37.126]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:37.647 --> 00:49:43.011]  Other documents obtained by NBC News show that the Defense Department is clearly increasing its domestic monitoring activities.
[00:49:43.131 --> 00:49:50.716]  One DOD briefing document, stamped secret, concludes, we have noted increasing confirmation, communication, and encouragement between protest groups using the Internet.
[00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:51.997]  Oooh!
[00:49:52.778 --> 00:49:53.819]  Oooh!
[00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:55.500]  How evil!
[00:49:56.321 --> 00:50:00.744]  The increased monitoring disrupts some military observations.
[00:50:01.822 --> 00:50:05.064]  It means that they're actually collecting information about who's who at protest.
[00:50:05.723 --> 00:50:07.404]  Folks, you can go to a Second Amendment protest.
[00:50:07.424 --> 00:50:09.326]  There's troops there taking photos.
[00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:14.670]  Some former DOD intelligence officials share his concern and what was Arkin's concern.
[00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:22.075]  It means that they're actually collecting information about who's at those protests, the discrepancies, descriptions of vehicles at those protests, says Arkin.
[00:50:22.435 --> 00:50:29.300]  One of the domestic level, this is unprecedented, he says, I think it's the beginning of enormous problems and enormous mischief for the military.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.481]  The beginning?
[00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:32.062]  You're not stupid.
[00:50:32.102 --> 00:50:34.504]  You know they've been out there gooning about for decades.
[00:50:35.487 --> 00:50:36.568]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:50:36.608 --> 00:50:37.689]  It gets so much worse.
[00:50:41.433 --> 00:50:42.754]  There's articles here where U.S.
[00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:45.156]  military has testified they're ordered to spy on U.S.
[00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:48.079]  citizens for any reason.
[00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:50.401]  You're involved in anything you're being spied on.
[00:50:51.422 --> 00:50:54.085]  And it's just your military turned against you.
[00:50:54.105 --> 00:50:55.346]  That's called martial law.
[00:50:55.446 --> 00:50:56.227]  Martial law.
[00:50:56.527 --> 00:50:57.408]  Martial law is here.
[00:50:58.402 --> 00:51:02.731]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:02.932 --> 00:51:07.281]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.888]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:11.928 --> 00:51:13.369]  The New World Order.
[00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:14.729]  Panama.
[00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.272]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:19.332 --> 00:51:26.277]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:26.397 --> 00:51:28.398]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:28.638 --> 00:51:39.124]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:39.384 --> 00:51:44.767]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:47.667]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:47.828 --> 00:53:53.772]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:59.036 --> 00:54:04.200]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:07.222]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:07.242 --> 00:54:12.306]  I know I haven't gone to Kitty or Chris or Mike or Gil or Eddie yet.
[00:54:12.767 --> 00:54:13.207]  It's just that
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.942]  And how am I supposed to be calm about this?
[00:54:17.002 --> 00:54:19.365]  I'm seeing the actual murder of America.
[00:54:20.246 --> 00:54:27.696]  And all these well-meaning military and other people marching around with guns, searching us, doing all of this, and it's just a joke.
[00:54:27.736 --> 00:54:28.617]  It's a sick joke.
[00:54:29.278 --> 00:54:31.160]  And this is only a prelude to something bigger.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.043]  They're putting all this in place for a reason.
[00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.893]  Boys and girls, it is to suppress the general public.
[00:54:36.293 --> 00:54:38.634]  That's what the battle formation is.
[00:54:38.694 --> 00:54:43.316]  That's what the entire operation, admittedly... See, they don't hide it when you go to one of their drills.
[00:54:43.796 --> 00:54:48.638]  It's to break up families, take over cities, process neighborhoods, domestically.
[00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:57.582]  But then when it's on the news, well, let's go fight a terrorist, and then you see their definition of a terrorist, and it's anything that doesn't worship world government and slit its wrist when ordered.
[00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:04.403]  You know, when they say, cut your own head off, you say, you know, you just ask, you know, how fast to do it and how they like it.
[00:55:04.423 --> 00:55:06.624]  You know, what type of platter they like it on.
[00:55:07.824 --> 00:55:09.984]  And they're changing the rules to take your pension funds.
[00:55:10.384 --> 00:55:11.925]  They're changing the rules on everything.
[00:55:11.965 --> 00:55:15.585]  I mean, they're really gearing up to rape the daylights out of us here.
[00:55:16.165 --> 00:55:20.246]  And I know while they're doing it to you, you'll smile and go, thank you, government, thank you.
[00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:21.646]  It's so sick.
[00:55:21.666 --> 00:55:23.407]  They're even going to take the cops' pension funds.
[00:55:23.847 --> 00:55:24.607]  They'll thank them too.
[00:55:24.627 --> 00:55:25.087]  They'll love it.
[00:55:25.743 --> 00:55:29.364]  I mean, it's just you've got a dumbed-down, mindless, giggling population.
[00:55:29.685 --> 00:55:32.466]  The elite knows you'll take anything, and they're going to rape you!
[00:55:33.246 --> 00:55:33.586]  Simple!
[00:55:34.086 --> 00:55:34.887]  I've got more here.
[00:55:34.947 --> 00:55:37.008]  Patriot Act provisions target protesters.
[00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.649]  Same thing they're trying to pass here locally in Austin.
[00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:41.749]  Where's my document?
[00:55:41.769 --> 00:55:43.810]  I just had that.
[00:55:44.451 --> 00:55:53.094]  On December 15th, City Council will vote on amendments to the so-called Public Order Ordinance, and it's just
[00:55:54.854 --> 00:55:55.574]  It's just amazing.
[00:55:57.535 --> 00:56:18.022]  And by the way, it says right here, we believe that this broad implications of this anti-job seeking ordinance and the amendments that would extend its scope unethically and illegally limit honest activities like seeking employment, canvassing, requesting charitable contributions, advertising, or car wash, resting on a sidewalk, or even opening a lemonade stand.
[00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:18.242]  Yeah.
[00:56:18.582 --> 00:56:21.103]  You can't stand anywhere on any street, can't protest.
[00:56:21.383 --> 00:56:23.124]  You see, they lost a bunch of lawsuits
[00:56:25.201 --> 00:56:26.862]  It was with the local disabled group.
[00:56:26.942 --> 00:56:29.564]  They were out there protesting Bush right before he became president.
[00:56:29.624 --> 00:56:33.066]  And they were arresting him for just being on the large sidewalk protesting.
[00:56:33.887 --> 00:56:35.668]  And they won a bunch of $100,000 lawsuits.
[00:56:36.228 --> 00:56:39.410]  So I can go bullhorn Vicente Fox now when he comes to speak with Rick Perry.
[00:56:40.551 --> 00:56:43.593]  Under this, they're going to, of course, I'll let you take me to jail and I'll sue you.
[00:56:44.093 --> 00:56:47.215]  What they do though is they take me to jail and then magically drop all the charges.
[00:56:47.255 --> 00:56:48.896]  So it's kind of like they just get me off the street.
[00:56:48.916 --> 00:56:51.398]  This has happened a couple times and drop the charges.
[00:56:52.279 --> 00:56:52.879]  But I don't know.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.441]  We got calls from listeners.
[00:56:54.481 --> 00:57:02.426]  I did have the synopsis sent to me of the shows on Fox where the person protests so they give them eight years in prison and the judge says it's good and that's the moral of the story.
[00:57:02.746 --> 00:57:03.087]  Oh, yes.
[00:57:03.407 --> 00:57:05.448]  See, everything is brainwashing.
[00:57:05.648 --> 00:57:07.249]  Why do they want to stop protesting?
[00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.351]  What are they so afraid of?
[00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:13.053]  Because they know when they take your pension funds, cops, you're going to be out protesting.
[00:57:13.454 --> 00:57:14.354]  Sorry.
[00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:15.035]  I know.
[00:57:15.095 --> 00:57:15.675]  Laugh at me.
[00:57:15.895 --> 00:57:16.416]  I know.
[00:57:16.536 --> 00:57:16.836]  I know.
[00:57:16.876 --> 00:57:17.316]  It's funny.
[00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:18.337]  It's funny.
[00:57:18.357 --> 00:57:19.178]  You'll be laughing later.
[00:57:19.198 --> 00:57:19.538]  Don't worry.
[00:57:21.395 --> 00:57:23.918]  And then here it is, Patriot Act revision targets protesters.
[00:57:25.259 --> 00:57:31.364]  And it just says the whole areas of cities will be free speech zones.
[00:57:31.725 --> 00:57:35.768]  And this expands that to where you'll be federally charged, not just locally charged.
[00:57:35.788 --> 00:57:40.673]  Because the way it is now, again, the President's parade route, you want to stand there with a sign saying he's a goon.
[00:57:41.354 --> 00:57:42.475]  There's all these Bush supporters.
[00:57:42.495 --> 00:57:43.695]  There's been a whole bunch of these cases.
[00:57:43.796 --> 00:57:45.156]  We've had the victims on.
[00:57:45.797 --> 00:57:46.717]  And here comes Bush.
[00:57:47.118 --> 00:57:48.458]  And they got an anti-Bush sign.
[00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:50.600]  And they said they don't want to go along with it.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.861]  And the Secret Service walks over and goes, arrest that man.
[00:57:52.881 --> 00:57:54.422]  And they get six months in jail.
[00:57:54.462 --> 00:57:55.062]  You're in jail.
[00:57:56.143 --> 00:57:58.464]  Now it's going to be where the Secret Service does it.
[00:57:58.504 --> 00:58:00.165]  And you get years in prison.
[00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:02.247]  Tiananmen Square, baby.
[00:58:02.527 --> 00:58:03.768]  The new America.
[00:58:03.828 --> 00:58:04.768]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:58:04.808 --> 00:58:05.909]  Border stays wide open.
[00:58:07.794 --> 00:58:10.456]  And just wait till the globalists start nuking cities.
[00:58:10.476 --> 00:58:11.376]  Man, it's going to get bad.
[00:58:12.037 --> 00:58:14.318]  The good news is we know you're the terrorist.
[00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:17.640]  And for every PrisonPlanet.TV member, listen to me.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.382]  For every PrisonPlanet.TV member, do me a favor.
[00:58:21.042 --> 00:58:25.825]  Go there, download, burn copies of all my films, all the material that's available to you.
[00:58:26.326 --> 00:58:27.426]  Start giving it to people.
[00:58:27.466 --> 00:58:28.627]  Start emailing it to folks.
[00:58:29.608 --> 00:58:30.488]  Just spread the word.
[00:58:30.528 --> 00:58:31.649]  Let's all be activists.
[00:58:31.669 --> 00:58:35.471]  Let's expose these murdering terrorists before they strike again.
[00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:36.432]  Stop them!
[00:58:38.095 --> 00:58:42.983]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:55.031]  Big Brother.
[00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:56.732]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:57.452 --> 00:58:58.592]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:00.033]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.793 --> 00:59:01.694]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.714 --> 00:59:06.055]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.535 --> 00:59:10.657]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.078 --> 00:59:14.559]  We are now under official martial law.
[00:59:15.679 --> 00:59:17.960]  You see, on TV and the movies, they always announce it.
[00:59:18.817 --> 00:59:19.557]  Not in the real world.
[00:59:19.577 --> 00:59:21.958]  They just go, oh, the TSA, the checkpoints and the airports?
[00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:30.921]  That's going to be in every town and every city, and we're going to federalize your local police, and we're just going to search you and shake you down, and we're going to have the military spying on you.
[00:59:30.961 --> 00:59:42.004]  We're going to pass city ordinances that are federally pushed and written up to ban any type of protesting or demonstrating or standing on the street corner in any way, and we're going to, we're just, it's the new freedom.
[00:59:42.044 --> 00:59:43.324]  Just shut up and take it.
[00:59:43.645 --> 00:59:44.965]  Just shut up and love it.
[00:59:46.892 --> 00:59:48.573]  So we're going to get into all this today.
[00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:50.454]  And they're actually expanding the Patriot Act.
[00:59:50.494 --> 00:59:51.614]  No one seems to have figured this out.
[00:59:51.635 --> 00:59:52.995]  The quote changes.
[00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:54.496]  Oh, they go, we're going to fix it.
[00:59:54.836 --> 00:59:56.737]  And then you read that they're making it even worse.
[00:59:56.757 --> 00:59:57.918]  So it's really Patriot Act, too.
[01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:01.800]  And people just believe it.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.561]  You can believe nothing they say.
[01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:05.622]  They've gone to a new level of lying.
[01:00:05.682 --> 01:00:09.584]  OK, we're going to go to Kitty and Eddie and Chris and everybody here.
[01:00:10.184 --> 01:00:10.784]  Eddie in England.
[01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:11.084]  Go ahead.
[01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:11.705]  We'll go to Kitty.
[01:00:11.725 --> 01:00:12.245]  Go ahead, Eddie.
[01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:14.146]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:14.926 --> 01:00:14.966]  Hi.
[01:00:17.236 --> 01:00:30.504]  Yes, regarding everything you've been saying, and I've been listening from quite a considerable time, not just today, but for several weeks and months.
[01:00:32.225 --> 01:00:39.128]  What's happening here in Europe is almost exactly what is happening in your country.
[01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.669]  They even give it the same name, sir.
[01:00:40.749 --> 01:00:41.910]  It's the same program.
[01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.690]  Yeah.
[01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:44.011]  Our government
[01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:47.872]  Which we have a one party state, really.
[01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.974]  They've got three different names, but they're a one party state.
[01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:59.418]  Last year, the Civil Contingencies Bill, which is the equivalent of Hitler's Enabling Bill in 1933.
[01:00:59.498 --> 01:01:04.860]  He actually says, rest and relocation centers, they're building luscious camps for you.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.601]  For your safety, of course.
[01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:07.962]  I know, it's free.
[01:01:08.062 --> 01:01:08.682]  Exactly.
[01:01:08.862 --> 01:01:09.703]  Camps are good.
[01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:10.363]  What's wrong with you?
[01:01:12.955 --> 01:01:13.155]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.496 --> 01:01:14.716]  We shouldn't be so upset.
[01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:15.917]  Camps are good!
[01:01:16.317 --> 01:01:17.638]  Yeah, they're lovely, aren't they?
[01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:18.379]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:18.779 --> 01:01:21.621]  Well... The question is, what are they planning?
[01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:23.002]  Why are they gearing all this up?
[01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:23.822]  What did we do?
[01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:26.064]  We were here laying here like jellyfish taking it.
[01:01:26.084 --> 01:01:27.385]  I mean, you know what?
[01:01:27.485 --> 01:01:29.626]  It's because they've got even worse stuff planned for us.
[01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:31.888]  Stuff so bad they know we're going to resist.
[01:01:32.228 --> 01:01:34.790]  Stuff so horrible they know we're going to fight them.
[01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.052]  Well, they simply want to...
[01:01:40.803 --> 01:01:41.944]  Oh, what we do?
[01:01:42.064 --> 01:01:43.004]  Barnacles, really.
[01:01:43.205 --> 01:01:49.828]  They want us to be barnacles, just to lie there and take in what they say and accept everything that they say.
[01:01:49.909 --> 01:01:58.774]  And let a bunch of young punk goons in police uniforms shake us down in front of our wives and children and shove us around and teach us how to be slaves!
[01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:01.415]  I think you saw that when you were in London, didn't you?
[01:02:02.096 --> 01:02:04.337]  I saw it with nothing compared to what I saw.
[01:02:04.377 --> 01:02:09.380]  When you were a bullhorn in the... Exactly, but nothing compared to what I saw, though, in New York City.
[01:02:10.307 --> 01:02:30.883]  Well, I've seen it here when the previous war went into Iraq and a place called Fairford in England where the B-52s were based and they were arresting and beating people up, taking them away and they never got to court.
[01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:34.603]  There was no... Well, you know how this works.
[01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:38.586]  They hire the anarchist black bloc, and that doesn't mean black people, folks.
[01:02:38.606 --> 01:02:40.387]  There's the green bloc, the red bloc, and the black bloc.
[01:02:40.407 --> 01:02:43.729]  And the black bloc is federal in almost every case, and I've caught them.
[01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:51.234]  And the police admit it in Seattle, and they'll go break something, and then the cops wink and let them retreat, then they attack the peaceful people.
[01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:52.215]  Exactly.
[01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.675]  Again, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:02:53.996 --> 01:02:54.916]  Same thing every time.
[01:02:54.956 --> 01:02:55.537]  It's so sick.
[01:02:56.557 --> 01:03:00.400]  But when you see laws being enacted,
[01:03:00.836 --> 01:03:03.877]  Which we've got here now, um, hate laws.
[01:03:03.957 --> 01:03:08.738]  I think, uh, your lot are trying to, uh, enact them now.
[01:03:09.298 --> 01:03:15.820]  We've got a lovely lady called Lynette Burrows, who, um, wrote a piece.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.100]  She's an author, wrote a piece in the newspaper.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:28.603]  Yeah, now they're talking about arrest... She says, statistically, it's better for a man and woman to adopt a child than a homosexual couple, and they're talking about arresting her.
[01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.972]  Well, you're damn right they are!
[01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:33.154]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:03:34.215 --> 01:03:35.656]  That's freedom, sir!
[01:03:35.716 --> 01:03:36.977]  That's freedom!
[01:03:37.798 --> 01:03:40.060]  Oh, dear Alex, I don't know what I'm going to say.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.823]  I get so angry, I get... Well, you should be, and it's good to hear from you.
[01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:44.844]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:45.304]  Stay with us.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.162]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:54.422 --> 01:03:56.003]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:56.343 --> 01:04:01.026]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:01.367 --> 01:04:08.111]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:10.413]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:13.455]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:13.535 --> 01:04:18.218]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:22.822]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:23.062 --> 01:04:30.287]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:30.528 --> 01:04:32.949]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:50.225 --> 01:04:55.526]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:57.787]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:04:58.047 --> 01:05:05.148]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:05.288 --> 01:05:16.791]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.

[01:05:53.655 --> 01:05:54.976]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:58.138]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:58.559 --> 01:06:01.200]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:01.641 --> 01:06:08.105]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:08.425 --> 01:06:16.228]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[01:06:28.946 --> 01:06:30.387]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:30.567 --> 01:06:30.907]  Have you?
[01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.988]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:37.209]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:37.229 --> 01:06:41.211]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:41.671 --> 01:06:42.712]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:43.272 --> 01:06:44.452]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[01:06:44.892 --> 01:06:48.574]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:06:48.594 --> 01:06:52.556]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:53.116 --> 01:06:55.897]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:12.377 --> 01:07:21.079]  The caller in the last segment, the first little five minutes of the hour that some stations don't carry, brought up England.
[01:07:21.299 --> 01:07:28.821]  And I've got BBC News articles with the headline, 100 plus raids last night for Hake.
[01:07:29.502 --> 01:07:30.642]  And it says in the article,
[01:07:31.377 --> 01:07:38.019]  That it was a raid on people who neighbors had heard use racial epithets under their breath.
[01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:45.701]  They were arrested and dealt with sternly and faced charges and jail time because someone might have heard them say something racist.
[01:07:46.201 --> 01:07:50.702]  Now folks, I don't go around saying bad things about Jews or blacks, but if I want to, I should be able to.
[01:07:50.962 --> 01:07:52.842]  And they should be able to call me names as a white guy.
[01:07:53.983 --> 01:07:55.343]  It's called free speech, folks.
[01:07:56.633 --> 01:07:58.955]  Just like an anti-Bush protester.
[01:07:59.015 --> 01:08:01.157]  Even if you're a Bushite, you should be able to go protest Bush.
[01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.739]  No, they need me in free speech zones.
[01:08:03.899 --> 01:08:05.020]  Bill Clinton started that.
[01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:13.347]  I'll never forget interviewing Robin Page, the big one-man-and-his-dog, rural affairs show, one of the top shows on BBC.
[01:08:13.387 --> 01:08:15.129]  He'd been running for, I think, eight years at the time.
[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.731]  He'd walk from town to town with his TV show.
[01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:23.296]  Kind of like that guy on in Texas, sponsored by Dairy Queen, who does the Texas Report.
[01:08:23.965 --> 01:08:27.088]  Well, he would walk around with his video crew all over.
[01:08:27.588 --> 01:08:28.209]  That doesn't matter.
[01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:31.351]  The point is, he was at a rural affairs fox hunting meeting.
[01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:33.253]  A couple thousand people there.
[01:08:33.273 --> 01:08:38.377]  And he said, we deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[01:08:39.142 --> 01:08:47.206]  Well, they arrested him and they said the word homosexual, selectively, they decided if it was meant as an epithet.
[01:08:47.486 --> 01:08:48.547]  If it was meant as hateful.
[01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:49.587]  It's a scientific name.
[01:08:49.807 --> 01:08:51.088]  Heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:08:51.588 --> 01:08:54.650]  Negro, or the term Anglo.
[01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:59.012]  But see, all those terms now, because people are so ignorant, are bad.
[01:08:59.452 --> 01:09:04.434]  And they did arrest him and he apologized and Mr. Page was released.
[01:09:05.155 --> 01:09:05.855]  Very evil.
[01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:09.950]  And this will happen here, folks.
[01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:12.151]  Again, they've already arrested Christians.
[01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.711]  Remember last year in Philadelphia?
[01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:15.492]  They arrested, what, 14 of them?
[01:09:16.472 --> 01:09:19.753]  Seven got the charges kept on them through the Bush U.S.
[01:09:19.793 --> 01:09:21.354]  Attorney advising the local D.A.?
[01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:27.216]  They were facing 47 years apiece for terrorism for praying on the street corner.
[01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:33.398]  And it's said that their praying made people mad and that incited violence, which didn't happen, but could have, and so they were terrorists.
[01:09:34.315 --> 01:09:35.676]  So you think you're safe, folks?
[01:09:35.836 --> 01:09:37.156]  No free speech of any type.
[01:09:38.117 --> 01:09:38.757]  And here it is!
[01:09:38.777 --> 01:09:42.098]  A woman who disagreed with gay adoption gets called from police.
[01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:46.220]  An author has defended her right to free speech after expressing her views on gay adoption.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.960]  Don't use the word homosexual.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.521]  You'll get arrested.
[01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:53.543]  And this is out of several big mainstream news articles over in England.
[01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:54.943]  This is the evening... What is this?
[01:09:54.983 --> 01:10:01.086]  The evening... I printed this in a printer friendly... I didn't even print the... It drives me crazy.
[01:10:01.106 --> 01:10:01.566]  What does it matter?
[01:10:01.586 --> 01:10:02.146]  It's all over the news.
[01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:05.332]  Oh, this is the Cambridge Evening News.
[01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:05.712]  There it is.
[01:10:07.312 --> 01:10:11.794]  I get so hyped up wanting to go to your calls, get to all the news, I just run over myself.
[01:10:11.814 --> 01:10:12.415]  Let me settle down.
[01:10:12.435 --> 01:10:15.536]  I'm going to get more into martial law here later.
[01:10:15.776 --> 01:10:16.997]  We're under it right now, folks.
[01:10:17.337 --> 01:10:21.438]  An author has defended her rights to free speech after expressing her views on gay adoption.
[01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:30.062]  Lynette Burrows of Hills Row, we're going to get her on, Cambridge was shocked when she was told her opinion could have been homophobic.
[01:10:30.914 --> 01:10:38.496]  She spoke to the police on Friday and said that the call was sinister and that Britain was a police state.
[01:10:40.176 --> 01:10:48.158]  The author of Fight for the Family was discussing civil partnerships for gay couples on Radio 5 Live regarding gay adoption.
[01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:53.099]  She said a girl would not be placed for adoption with two heterosexual men.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.080]  Well, obviously, she shouldn't.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.521]  And I'm sorry, if you want to have kids,
[01:11:00.955 --> 01:11:03.776]  There's a way this happens.
[01:11:04.536 --> 01:11:06.177]  This happens between a man and a woman.
[01:11:07.937 --> 01:11:15.420]  And there are a lot of white people who want to adopt black children in this country, but it's basically not allowed because some weirdo black groups don't like it.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:19.761]  I guess it's better that little kids be on Ritalin and Prozac in some FEMA camp, basically.
[01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:27.744]  But that's a figure of speech in some state, federally funded mental ward.
[01:11:29.889 --> 01:11:34.995]  But there's another figure of speech when I say honeycombs of cells.
[01:11:35.455 --> 01:11:40.681]  Honeycombs of cells means, someone was commenting on that, he says they're in honeycombs.
[01:11:41.282 --> 01:11:45.527]  I mean in just complexes full of hundreds of cells.
[01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.710]  That's called honeycombs, that term.
[01:11:50.217 --> 01:11:56.600]  She said, nobody trusts men with girls, but they will give a little boy to two homosexuals, which is madness.
[01:11:57.201 --> 01:11:59.542]  Yeah, as if... It's just unbelievable.
[01:12:00.202 --> 01:12:05.605]  After the broadcast, police in London received a complaint from a member of the public, and a policewoman contacted Ms.
[01:12:05.645 --> 01:12:05.925]  Burrows.
[01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:07.886]  Well, you aren't arrested by, like, Robin Page.
[01:12:08.266 --> 01:12:08.426]  Ms.
[01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:12.528]  Burrows said, she said to me, a homophobic incident had been registered against me.
[01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:16.370]  She admitted it wasn't against the law, so I said, why are you wasting my time?
[01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:18.111]  What do you mean it's not against the law?
[01:12:18.131 --> 01:12:19.592]  They arrested Robin Page!
[01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.739]  She said it was their policy to investigate remarks considered to be homophobic.
[01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:27.601]  I was expressing a perfectly standard opinion on matters of public interest.
[01:12:27.921 --> 01:12:33.185]  It is a sinister thing if police are forming their own policies regardless of the law.
[01:12:33.806 --> 01:12:34.126]  Well, Ms.
[01:12:34.146 --> 01:12:35.107]  Burroughs, you're ignorant.
[01:12:35.187 --> 01:12:36.828]  If they consider it to be hateful,
[01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:39.078]  I guess homophobic isn't.
[01:12:39.358 --> 01:12:40.298]  Then you will go to jail.
[01:12:40.598 --> 01:12:40.758]  Ms.
[01:12:40.778 --> 01:12:44.339]  Burroughs added, I think the issue of gay adoption is something which ought to be spoken about.
[01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:49.440]  The idea of telling you that you can't talk about it is so repressive, it's like the KGB calling you up.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:55.581]  The Metropolitan Police spokesman said homophobic, racist, or domestic incidents were priority crimes.
[01:12:55.641 --> 01:12:57.901]  So see, now they are saying it's a crime, see?
[01:12:58.862 --> 01:13:04.102]  He said it's a standard practice for all parties to be spoken to, even if the incident is not strictly seen as a crime.
[01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.443]  Not strictly.
[01:13:05.463 --> 01:13:07.243]  See, they decide when it's a crime or when it isn't.
[01:13:07.904 --> 01:13:13.485]  Folks, yeah, why is there no adoption of little girls to two men?
[01:13:13.525 --> 01:13:16.026]  Because people know, folks, that's insane.
[01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.826]  What do two men want a little girl for?
[01:13:18.247 --> 01:13:20.547]  Why are two men living together wanting a little girl?
[01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:28.429]  But they'll give them a little boy, and statistically, the pedophilia goes off the chart with these families.
[01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:33.350]  It's on record, it's federal numbers, and they try to keep it real quiet.
[01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:36.171]  And let me tell you something else here.
[01:13:36.775 --> 01:13:39.101]  Let me tell you something else that just makes me sick.
[01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:44.974]  You know, take our former sheriffs, just all of them.
[01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:46.037]  It just makes me sick.
[01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:52.300]  A lot of these CPS kids getting grabbed at a poor family's door, going right to these other people.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.121]  They get select treatment.
[01:13:54.401 --> 01:13:57.342]  Let's say there's a good family that wants to adopt.
[01:13:57.422 --> 01:14:00.862]  A man and a woman wants to adopt, say, two little kids.
[01:14:01.643 --> 01:14:05.684]  It's a three, four-year waiting list to get black or Hispanic babies in this country.
[01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:08.864]  You know how long it is to get a blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby?
[01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:11.185]  Six, seven years, unless you want to pay half a million bucks.
[01:14:11.889 --> 01:14:15.173]  And boy, the CPS is snatching up... I've been to the hospitals, folks.
[01:14:15.253 --> 01:14:15.894]  I've covered it.
[01:14:16.134 --> 01:14:17.295]  I've shot video in the hospital.
[01:14:17.315 --> 01:14:18.877]  I've had cops threaten to arrest me.
[01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.459]  Mike Hanson, I know you're listening.
[01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:21.560]  Dig that out of our archives.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.622]  Bring that over to the office of Ryan Slickheisen.
[01:14:23.642 --> 01:14:28.968]  I want to put CPS Hell, I think is the name of the show, I want to put that on PrisonPlanet.tv for the members.
[01:14:29.008 --> 01:14:29.649]  I want them to see.
[01:14:30.496 --> 01:14:30.876]  Family.
[01:14:30.956 --> 01:14:31.797]  No criminal record.
[01:14:31.857 --> 01:14:32.858]  Never done anything wrong.
[01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:34.318]  No allegations of abuse.
[01:14:34.819 --> 01:14:36.820]  He works as an auto mechanic.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.381]  They're looking for an apartment.
[01:14:39.401 --> 01:14:40.522]  They're living in a hotel.
[01:14:41.783 --> 01:14:43.324]  She is about to have a baby.
[01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:45.005]  She goes to get welfare support.
[01:14:45.405 --> 01:14:54.911]  And they come in, boy, and they grabbed her by the throat and made her sign her baby over, and that baby was gone, and they probably got half a mil for that blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby.
[01:14:56.269 --> 01:14:58.830]  And I'm sorry, I'll probably be arrested for racism.
[01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:05.111]  Why is it evil to state the facts that long-haired, blue-eyed, white babies are an absolute premium?
[01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:08.172]  But it's all selectively done.
[01:15:08.612 --> 01:15:19.875]  The families that want those kids, of course who ignore who they were snatched from, even the quote good families, they keep wondering why they get passed up and it goes to the two gay men.
[01:15:21.795 --> 01:15:24.756]  Which again, statistically, they try to get married, they never stay together.
[01:15:24.776 --> 01:15:25.596]  These are just statistics.
[01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:31.584]  They have the highest suicide rate of any group, even above black males in this country.
[01:15:32.585 --> 01:15:35.905]  The lowest mortality rate.
[01:15:36.085 --> 01:15:37.506]  They die younger than any other group.
[01:15:37.526 --> 01:15:38.446]  But I don't hate these people.
[01:15:38.486 --> 01:15:39.686]  I'm not even attacking them.
[01:15:39.986 --> 01:15:41.247]  It's just common sense.
[01:15:42.027 --> 01:15:45.888]  You know, I'm against this sex education of 5 year olds in the schools.
[01:15:47.928 --> 01:15:49.889]  You know, 5 year olds are supposed to be innocent.
[01:15:50.991 --> 01:15:54.194]  And they're teaching them homosexual, they're teaching them heterosexual.
[01:15:54.695 --> 01:15:56.096]  The point is, they're innocent.
[01:15:56.156 --> 01:15:56.897]  Don't do that.
[01:15:56.937 --> 01:15:58.498]  That should be totally criminal.
[01:15:58.839 --> 01:16:02.983]  But if they put a politically correct label on it, it's A-OK.
[01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:10.030]  So, you know, it's simple.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:14.294]  These people want to have families, but they're not involved in a process where they do have families.
[01:16:15.592 --> 01:16:17.032]  They're not involved in the life cycle.
[01:16:17.533 --> 01:16:19.233]  That doesn't mean that they don't have their families.
[01:16:19.273 --> 01:16:21.934]  It doesn't mean they can't be part of other families or be considered family.
[01:16:22.854 --> 01:16:24.855]  It's just simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:27.756]  You can't come CPS our kids so you can have them.
[01:16:28.796 --> 01:16:33.698]  And now this well-known author goes on the radio and says, we wouldn't give a little girl to two men, but we'll give a little boy to them.
[01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:35.318]  And they come and threaten to arrest her.
[01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:37.779]  I know I've been ranting here.
[01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:38.099]  It's just...
[01:16:38.977 --> 01:16:42.080]  Kitty in New Hampshire, I'm sorry you held so long.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.601]  Go ahead, Kitty.
[01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:43.902]  That's okay, Alex.
[01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:46.384]  I just wanted to call because I wanted your opinion.
[01:16:46.404 --> 01:16:52.169]  I have a 20-year-old son, and he works at a nursing home.
[01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:56.373]  And he is, excuse the language, he is still a virgin.
[01:16:57.094 --> 01:17:04.461]  And his boss, who's a 62-year-old man, him and his wife have been influencing him away from us.
[01:17:05.447 --> 01:17:09.952]  Um, they've had him over to his, to their house several times.
[01:17:10.373 --> 01:17:24.067]  We've never talked to them and they have convinced him on his 21st birthday to go over to their house and stay with them rent free and they'll co-sign him a loan for a car and all this.
[01:17:24.588 --> 01:17:26.390]  I was wondering how you feel about this.
[01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:28.237]  What's your opinion?
[01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:35.879]  Well, I mean, they could be just really good friends with him, and your son's grown up and 21 years old, the decisions he makes are his, or they could be swingers.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.920]  So you don't think there's anything else involved?
[01:17:40.181 --> 01:17:43.661]  Well, I mean, I kind of see that you think something's weird, so I said that.
[01:17:43.681 --> 01:17:45.662]  I mean, your instincts are probably better than mine.
[01:17:45.902 --> 01:17:52.364]  Here in Texas, you're in New Hampshire, but a lot of times people are just friends with folks and want to help them and want to get them out on their feet.
[01:17:54.284 --> 01:17:59.309]  I mean, I've had friends live with me before, and it didn't mean anything weird was going on.
[01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.872]  Well, he's gotten so distant from us.
[01:18:03.394 --> 01:18:04.675]  Well, that happens a lot of time.
[01:18:04.715 --> 01:18:07.258]  People finally... So, I mean, your son's finally got a home, right?
[01:18:07.964 --> 01:18:12.046]  Well, they want him to leave on his birthday, his 21st birthday.
[01:18:12.206 --> 01:18:13.467]  Well, I gotta be honest with you.
[01:18:14.047 --> 01:18:16.629]  I mean, I don't think it's bad for somebody to move out when they're 21 years old.
[01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:19.950]  I mean, I moved out when I was, what was I, 17, 18?
[01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.072]  Again, I don't know the details.
[01:18:23.192 --> 01:18:25.893]  I mean, if you don't like him moving in with these people, help him get an apartment.
[01:18:27.194 --> 01:18:27.834]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:32.997]  But listen, I can't answer your questions, so please don't take any advice I gave you, because I don't know.
[01:18:34.094 --> 01:18:36.697]  I mean, do you want to give me more details when we get back?
[01:18:36.737 --> 01:18:38.738]  I mean, is there some reason you're suspicious?
[01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:40.280]  I mean, what are you suspicious of?
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:40.720]  Stay there.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.983]  I mean, I gotta have more information if I'm gonna try to give you advice.
[01:18:44.784 --> 01:18:47.286]  I mean, it sounds to me like you think something weird's going on.
[01:18:47.326 --> 01:18:48.046]  It probably isn't.
[01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:54.272]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:54.872 --> 01:18:56.614]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?

[01:22:51.462 --> 01:22:59.505]  Alright, real fast, let's go back to Kitty, because I want to run through all these calls and get back under some nose.
[01:22:59.886 --> 01:23:01.426]  Paul Watson is joining us in the next hour.
[01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:05.428]  Kitty, I mean, what is it you don't like about his boss?
[01:23:06.434 --> 01:23:10.056]  Well, it's just the fact, Alex, that I know this man.
[01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:12.037]  I used to work in the nursing home.
[01:23:12.498 --> 01:23:13.919]  I was the one who got him in there.
[01:23:14.479 --> 01:23:17.681]  And he was always standoffish, and he never spoke to anyone.
[01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:21.303]  But William, he's taken a liking to.
[01:23:21.323 --> 01:23:26.967]  And just a couple of weeks ago, he had offered William a car.
[01:23:28.027 --> 01:23:32.630]  But he called late at night and said, now, William, you have to have $2,500 tonight or the car is sold.
[01:23:36.733 --> 01:23:38.654]  It's like he took that car away.
[01:23:38.674 --> 01:23:41.035]  It was already sold, but he didn't tell him that.
[01:23:41.575 --> 01:23:44.356]  He just told him, you have to have it tonight or the car is sold.
[01:23:46.377 --> 01:23:49.898]  That started the separation of this family.
[01:23:51.339 --> 01:23:51.879]  Well, you know what?
[01:23:51.919 --> 01:23:52.079]  He's 21.
[01:23:52.559 --> 01:23:55.580]  Obviously, as long as he's in your house, he's got to do what you say.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.201]  But, I mean, it's natural to want to get out of the house.
[01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:59.662]  I wanted to get out of the house when I was about 12.
[01:24:02.627 --> 01:24:09.350]  I don't have enough information, but if that's all you've got to go off of, he's got to make his own way.
[01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:14.252]  Tell him, Salovey, I think you guys will get along a lot better once he gets out in the real world and sees what it's like.
[01:24:14.272 --> 01:24:17.033]  He'll probably see things more your way in the future.
[01:24:17.573 --> 01:24:23.716]  A lot of times, kids just have to be out in the world themselves to figure out their parents were more often right.
[01:24:24.503 --> 01:24:30.548]  I mean, it's the old cliché, but I figured out how smart my parents were once I had been out of the house about 10 years.
[01:24:30.988 --> 01:24:32.209]  Listen, thanks for the call, Kitty.
[01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:34.891]  I wish I could help you more, but I really can't say.
[01:24:34.911 --> 01:24:39.015]  I mean, if you think this guy's a creep, then you've got your reasons.
[01:24:39.055 --> 01:24:41.697]  But I think if you try to make your son not move in with him, he probably will.
[01:24:42.618 --> 01:24:45.560]  That's kind of how, you might use reverse psychology.
[01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:48.562]  Chris in Illinois, go ahead Chris, you're on the air.
[01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:49.883]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[01:24:50.303 --> 01:24:53.505]  Doing a worldwide transmission against tyranny, that's what's going on.
[01:24:53.965 --> 01:25:01.390]  Well actually, this is Chris's roommate Brad, and Chris had to step out to go to the store, but I wanted to talk to you.
[01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:05.633]  He showed me your Bohemian movie, your Bohemian Rogue movie.
[01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:06.113]  Yes sir.
[01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:09.496]  And I was really blown away by that.
[01:25:12.153 --> 01:25:22.036]  I want to tell you that I'm a full believer in what you say now, and I think I'm going to follow what's going on, because I think this world is really corrupted.
[01:25:22.216 --> 01:25:22.816]  Exactly.
[01:25:22.936 --> 01:25:28.218]  I mean, it's more exciting to know the truth and to get involved and to be informed.
[01:25:28.258 --> 01:25:30.558]  It's a lot more interesting than watching football.
[01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:31.659]  Right, right.
[01:25:31.719 --> 01:25:32.499]  It actually is.
[01:25:32.599 --> 01:25:36.660]  And I was really, like I said, I was really blew away by that.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.841]  And on the Internet, it's this
[01:25:42.215 --> 01:25:55.085]  And I'll be watching that too, and there's just a whole bunch of other stuff that's going on that I wasn't even aware of, and I'm glad that they shed light on me about that.
[01:25:55.345 --> 01:25:58.668]  It's as if Morpheus had given you the red pill.
[01:25:59.248 --> 01:26:01.710]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:08.956]  And my roommate Chris, he made a sign that said, uh, the government is turning against us, and he posted it up in a public place.
[01:26:10.447 --> 01:26:14.171]  Millions of you are doing similar things, and I can only commend you.
[01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.332]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:26:15.372 --> 01:26:15.952]  God bless you.
[01:26:16.493 --> 01:26:29.325]  And by the way, a caller from Illinois, if you like the original Bohemian Grove, I have re-edited, remastered, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove for 2005, and then on top of it, produced The Order of Death.
[01:26:30.032 --> 01:26:30.972]  A brand new film.
[01:26:31.012 --> 01:26:38.854]  So you get The Order of Death and the updated Dark Secrets on one DVD or one VHS and that's available at infowars.com.
[01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:40.194]  I'll tell folks more about that later.
[01:26:40.755 --> 01:26:41.575]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:26:41.635 --> 01:26:42.695]  Gil and Tejas.
[01:26:42.775 --> 01:26:43.515]  Gil, go ahead.
[01:26:45.096 --> 01:26:45.856]  Happy Holidays.
[01:26:46.256 --> 01:26:47.216]  Happy Christmas to you.
[01:26:47.276 --> 01:26:47.636]  What's up?
[01:26:47.796 --> 01:26:48.276]  Thank you.
[01:26:48.296 --> 01:26:50.437]  Do you travel around the state?
[01:26:52.097 --> 01:26:53.678]  Oh, I travel a little bit, yeah.
[01:26:53.738 --> 01:26:55.338]  Have you been in Southeast Texas recently?
[01:26:56.597 --> 01:26:58.819]  Yes, I have been in Southeast Texas recently.
[01:26:58.879 --> 01:27:03.342]  Well, sir, apparently, um, electronic voting is coming to our area.
[01:27:03.362 --> 01:27:04.623]  I was watching the evening news.
[01:27:06.324 --> 01:27:08.045]  And, you know, this area... Sincerely paid for?
[01:27:08.105 --> 01:27:08.845]  You can trust them?
[01:27:08.865 --> 01:27:11.227]  Does it matter if their CEOs are being indicted?
[01:27:11.267 --> 01:27:14.869]  I mean, they're even saying that they're going to come to your home to show you how to vote.
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:18.592]  And, you know, this area's gone predominantly Democratic, but, you know, with the redistricting
[01:27:19.096 --> 01:27:29.459]  And we put Jack Brooks in office, and when Jack Brooks kind of, you know, asked, I think it was Oliver North's question about armed camps and stuff, they said he had voted out that next year.
[01:27:29.719 --> 01:27:34.340]  Yeah, that's Jack Brooks asking about the concentration camps, and they say we're not allowed to talk about the camps.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:42.782]  And he was X'd out the next year, and you know, with the redistricting and with the electronic voting in this area, I wouldn't be surprised if the Democratic area in this area goes red.
[01:27:43.043 --> 01:27:46.083]  Well, they also rewrote it where good Republicans are being kicked out.
[01:27:46.604 --> 01:27:47.764]  They've tried to write it where
[01:27:48.644 --> 01:27:51.746]  I mean, you talk about looking like a salamander, hence the term gerrymander.
[01:27:53.248 --> 01:27:55.209]  You talk about the redistricting of our area.
[01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.791]  Isn't it time to lay a right?
[01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:00.313]  He's still up for charges down there in Austin on something.
[01:28:00.633 --> 01:28:02.114]  The Texas legislature is still up for charges.
[01:28:02.154 --> 01:28:04.035]  The conspiracy charge got dropped.
[01:28:04.055 --> 01:28:05.096]  The money laundering stands.
[01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:11.081]  They're still looking into the money laundering and if this redistricting is constitutional.
[01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:13.142]  One more question before I go.
[01:28:13.362 --> 01:28:16.224]  What's the lady on the top of the state capitol with the star?
[01:28:16.244 --> 01:28:16.805]  What does that mean?
[01:28:17.722 --> 01:28:19.082]  That's Diana.
[01:28:20.403 --> 01:28:21.263]  That's the goddess.
[01:28:21.883 --> 01:28:23.144]  And she has a star on her hand.
[01:28:23.184 --> 01:28:23.544]  What's that?
[01:28:23.604 --> 01:28:24.424]  That means long star?
[01:28:24.444 --> 01:28:25.625]  That's what the term long star stands for?
[01:28:25.665 --> 01:28:25.745]  Yes.
[01:28:25.805 --> 01:28:27.965]  Well, you know what, I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[01:28:27.985 --> 01:28:28.846]  Thanks for the call, Gil.
[01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:32.367]  And then, the Skull and Bones, they worship Eulogia.
[01:28:33.327 --> 01:28:34.968]  Lots of goddess worship.
[01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:36.088]  Very Christian.
[01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:41.470]  We're on the march.
[01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:43.551]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.471 --> 01:28:47.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.432 --> 01:29:01.613]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:29:02.574 --> 01:29:15.797]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:29:16.597 --> 01:29:21.879]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:30.055]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[01:29:30.815 --> 01:29:31.355]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:31.675]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:31.715 --> 01:29:33.476]  It's absolutely free.
[01:29:33.696 --> 01:29:37.478]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:38.098]  Just call right now.
[01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:52.226]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:52.326 --> 01:30:03.031]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:03.411 --> 01:30:07.933]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:07.993 --> 01:30:19.339]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:19.919 --> 01:30:26.760]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:27.161 --> 01:30:29.301]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:29.781 --> 01:30:34.762]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:41.363]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.443 --> 01:30:45.604]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[01:30:45.864 --> 01:30:46.604]  That's toll free!
[01:30:50.986 --> 01:30:53.348]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:53.608 --> 01:30:57.450]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:30:57.771 --> 01:30:58.571]  Read the labels.
[01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:03.154]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:03.354 --> 01:31:07.557]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:07.918 --> 01:31:12.801]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:13.181 --> 01:31:16.743]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:16.943 --> 01:31:22.286]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:25.287]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:31:25.588 --> 01:31:26.488]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:26.788 --> 01:31:37.514]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[01:31:37.894 --> 01:31:39.675]  Call Cal Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:39.815 --> 01:31:47.839]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:31:53.021 --> 01:31:59.064]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:59.665 --> 01:32:02.626]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.352 --> 01:32:07.933]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:32:08.413 --> 01:32:09.034]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:09.074 --> 01:32:11.335]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:12.336 --> 01:32:13.597]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:32:14.577 --> 01:32:19.100]  Paul Watts is joining us the next hour to talk about the open martial law here in the U.S.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:25.084]  and England, to get us the latest information about the Miami shooting, to cover Bush's G.D.
[01:32:25.144 --> 01:32:27.025]  comments about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[01:32:28.566 --> 01:32:31.128]  All of it's coming up, and yes, we're going to go to Michael and
[01:32:32.703 --> 01:32:35.324]  Matt and Steve and others here in just a moment.
[01:32:35.565 --> 01:32:46.050]  Before I go to Steve Mason giving us an update on a move to basically ban the Minutemen in Austin and create secret intelligence squads in case any Minuteman ever shows up or any member of the Minutemen.
[01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:52.593]  Again, this is tattletale squads and arrest squads for going to the border and sitting in lawn chairs and calling the Border Patrol.
[01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:58.714]  But the Pentagon's roving around Austin, sending a neighborhood watch group saying, look for drugs and spy on your neighbor.
[01:32:58.974 --> 01:32:59.974]  Because that's terrorism.
[01:33:00.014 --> 01:33:03.596]  But don't you dare stop all the illegal aliens pouring across.
[01:33:03.616 --> 01:33:04.616]  It's just a sick joke.
[01:33:07.037 --> 01:33:08.318]  So that's coming up too.
[01:33:09.719 --> 01:33:11.259]  Briefly, folks, listen.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.300]  Christmas is right around the corner.
[01:33:14.281 --> 01:33:17.282]  And I don't care if you don't celebrate Christmas.
[01:33:17.302 --> 01:33:19.043]  This is a good reason to give somebody a gift.
[01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:19.843]  The gift of truth.
[01:33:19.883 --> 01:33:20.924]  The gift of information.
[01:33:23.127 --> 01:33:27.829]  And PrisonPlanet.tv is 15 cents a day with a monthly subscription.
[01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:33.091]  You normally get three months free when you get a yearly subscription.
[01:33:33.271 --> 01:33:35.792]  Now you're getting five months free.
[01:33:37.713 --> 01:33:39.313]  Five months free.
[01:33:39.353 --> 01:33:41.654]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:33:41.914 --> 01:33:43.115]  At $54.95 you get three months free.
[01:33:43.635 --> 01:33:46.676]  Now it's $39.95, so that's not true.
[01:33:46.736 --> 01:33:50.538]  I guess you get six months free.
[01:33:50.638 --> 01:33:51.378]  Okay, sorry.
[01:33:52.222 --> 01:33:53.803]  Six months free.
[01:33:54.083 --> 01:34:00.647]  Six months free, ladies and gentlemen, when you go and sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:00.747 --> 01:34:02.507]  Now almost into our second year.
[01:34:03.268 --> 01:34:09.391]  Here in about three months, we will be into our second year of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:15.314]  All of my best audio interviews going back for almost two years.
[01:34:16.095 --> 01:34:17.816]  Every one of the films I've made since 1997.
[01:34:17.856 --> 01:34:18.736]  My 14th newest film is up there.
[01:34:22.817 --> 01:34:27.324]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other documentaries that we've been authorized to post by wonderful people.
[01:34:29.528 --> 01:34:33.774]  My weekly TV special reports from England and from Crawford and from
[01:34:34.489 --> 01:34:35.530]  Just all over the place.
[01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:36.751]  We're doing these every week now.
[01:34:37.111 --> 01:34:38.873]  Now listeners are sending us video.
[01:34:38.953 --> 01:34:43.477]  One guy went in and got footage inside the big Masonic Temple up in upstate New York.
[01:34:43.497 --> 01:34:44.177]  They gave him a tour.
[01:34:44.198 --> 01:34:50.443]  He sent it to us with pentagrams and them admitting that they'd committed murders in the past and got caught trying to cover it up.
[01:34:50.463 --> 01:34:51.524]  That's what hurt Masons.
[01:34:52.024 --> 01:34:54.506]  That's a little 30-minute report up there on the website right now.
[01:34:55.607 --> 01:35:00.732]  The Weather Wars report we did about a month ago with the father of weather weapons.
[01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:03.053]  Ben Livingston.
[01:35:03.093 --> 01:35:07.075]  I mean, we're really putting some time, energy, money into this.
[01:35:09.357 --> 01:35:11.838]  And I just upgraded the PrisonPlanet.TV servers.
[01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:15.820]  We're about to do it even again, because so many people are sharing their passcodes.
[01:35:17.401 --> 01:35:22.223]  But seriously, go to PrisonPlanet.TV and get a monthly subscription.
[01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:24.164]  $5.95, folks.
[01:35:24.224 --> 01:35:26.185]  I mean, that's the cost of about four cups of coffee.
[01:35:27.151 --> 01:35:36.516]  And put the, print out the little code, little password, give it whatever password or code you want and write that inside a card and mail that to your friends or family or email it to them.
[01:35:36.536 --> 01:35:38.737]  They'll probably appreciate it more if it's in an actual card.
[01:35:40.238 --> 01:35:41.779]  And use the passcode for yourself too.
[01:35:41.879 --> 01:35:43.660]  I mean, that's really a two-for-one on top of it.
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:48.923]  But ask them, please don't share it any more than that because the passcodes keep getting shared.
[01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:50.844]  It is becoming somewhat of a problem.
[01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:55.113]  It's a catch-22 because that's the kind of problems I want to have.
[01:35:55.173 --> 01:36:00.058]  I want people watching the stuff, but we also want it all to work really well and be really great for the members.
[01:36:00.658 --> 01:36:04.802]  So be very sparing, but I'll let you share it with one person.
[01:36:05.863 --> 01:36:06.844]  One person.
[01:36:07.284 --> 01:36:09.666]  PrisonPlanet.tv for this holiday season.
[01:36:09.686 --> 01:36:14.831]  So give yourself a monthly subscription and share it with one person as a gift with that pass card.
[01:36:15.746 --> 01:36:17.267]  Or get yourself one and give them one.
[01:36:17.287 --> 01:36:19.269]  Or give your whole family a monthly subscription.
[01:36:19.569 --> 01:36:21.290]  Give your whole family yearly subscriptions.
[01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:23.291]  Almost two years up and running.
[01:36:24.072 --> 01:36:31.477]  And never been down except for I think one day, one time, a few months ago when we upgraded the servers and we're going to have to do it again.
[01:36:31.897 --> 01:36:32.538]  Growing pains.
[01:36:34.059 --> 01:36:36.120]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:44.726]  And by the way, the best activist tool out there, you can burn low bandwidth or high bandwidth copies on 50-cent CDs all day.
[01:36:46.076 --> 01:36:49.239]  Or buy dollar DVDs and make them even higher quality.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.404]  And what's to stop you from burning hundreds of copies of Roderick Daring?
[01:36:53.844 --> 01:36:55.325]  Hundreds of copies of Martial Law.
[01:36:55.345 --> 01:36:57.267]  Hundreds of copies of The Order of Death.
[01:36:57.307 --> 01:36:58.609]  Hundreds of copies of my book.
[01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:00.851]  Oh yes, grab them, email them around to people.
[01:37:00.931 --> 01:37:01.452]  I don't care.
[01:37:01.672 --> 01:37:02.573]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:37:02.893 --> 01:37:04.254]  We're here to get the info out.
[01:37:04.795 --> 01:37:06.537]  I mean, I jump for joy.
[01:37:08.812 --> 01:37:17.898]  When I call up a congressman, like Bob Barr, and then he starts announcing on air that he's a fan of our work and aware of our work, and then I talk to him later off air, and he's like, oh yeah, I've seen your films.
[01:37:18.278 --> 01:37:20.059]  Oh yeah, we read the website every week.
[01:37:20.079 --> 01:37:21.380]  Yes, we're fully aware of your information.
[01:37:21.701 --> 01:37:22.221]  Very powerful.
[01:37:22.995 --> 01:37:25.435]  He wouldn't know about it if it wasn't for you!
[01:37:25.976 --> 01:37:27.296]  Ron Paul, all these people.
[01:37:27.356 --> 01:37:32.477]  I call up, you know, some doctor in Illinois to have him on as a guest about autism.
[01:37:32.517 --> 01:37:33.177]  He's a listener.
[01:37:33.757 --> 01:37:36.777]  I call up to get a state rep on from Tennessee.
[01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:37.517]  He's a listener.
[01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:38.718]  She's a listener.
[01:37:38.798 --> 01:37:40.318]  A state rep from Arizona.
[01:37:40.338 --> 01:37:41.038]  She's a listener.
[01:37:41.918 --> 01:37:45.439]  And that's a gauge that we're really having an effect.
[01:37:45.739 --> 01:37:49.179]  Listen, this radio show itself reaches a couple million people a week, and that's conservative.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.360]  Most people make up bigger numbers, but we reach a couple million people a week.
[01:37:53.263 --> 01:37:56.345]  On our AM and FM stations and internet and satellite and shortwave combined.
[01:37:56.365 --> 01:37:57.446]  A couple million conservatively.
[01:37:58.786 --> 01:38:00.207]  And that's not a paltry sum.
[01:38:00.227 --> 01:38:01.608]  That's not a small group.
[01:38:01.688 --> 01:38:05.751]  But it's the millions of you that make copies of the videos.
[01:38:05.811 --> 01:38:07.852]  It's the millions of you that visit the website.
[01:38:08.212 --> 01:38:14.216]  It's the millions of you that email your email list and post on the blog or post on your website or post on a message board.
[01:38:17.278 --> 01:38:21.660]  And I'm asking you to go get memberships at PrisonPlanet.tv just for a month if you want.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.761]  Download everything.
[01:38:23.929 --> 01:38:24.729]  Spread it around.
[01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:29.330]  Post it on BitTorrents and on archives and just get it out there.
[01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.091]  Because we're in martial law.
[01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:32.851]  We're on the edge.
[01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:34.152]  It's getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:38:34.312 --> 01:38:34.872]  Any day now.
[01:38:34.952 --> 01:38:35.532]  Any month now.
[01:38:35.812 --> 01:38:36.732]  It could be tomorrow.
[01:38:36.772 --> 01:38:37.753]  It could be six years from now.
[01:38:37.793 --> 01:38:38.713]  It could be eight years from now.
[01:38:39.053 --> 01:38:41.414]  The globalists are probably going to nuke cities, release bioweapons.
[01:38:41.434 --> 01:38:42.194]  It's going to get real bad.
[01:38:43.726 --> 01:38:57.475]  They're arrogant little bastards, and excuse my French, and they have no idea how close to the edge they are, and I think they're starting to figure it out, and we can push it over the edge if you take action and get the materials and go absolutely ape with them.
[01:38:58.235 --> 01:39:02.158]  And if you really want to support us, and you can afford it, buy DVDs now!
[01:39:03.086 --> 01:39:03.487]  We're good to go.
[01:39:22.583 --> 01:39:32.013]  You can give her a call for bulk orders, that's orders of ten or more, and that's 512-291-5750, 512-291-5750, or you can call Hastings Communications that we've been using for now almost nine years for the toll-free orders.
[01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:44.623]  And they can take your order and answer your questions.
[01:39:44.784 --> 01:39:47.585]  Not as good as Shirley, though, but folks, she can't take all the calls.
[01:39:47.605 --> 01:39:49.006]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:39:50.006 --> 01:39:53.468]  Get a road to tyranny.
[01:39:53.829 --> 01:39:55.730]  Get a masters of terror.
[01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:57.311]  Get a police state three total enslavement.
[01:39:57.751 --> 01:39:59.092]  Get a 9-11, the Great Illusion.
[01:39:59.112 --> 01:40:00.212]  Get a Codex Magica.
[01:40:00.272 --> 01:40:01.293]  Get a coming battle book.
[01:40:01.993 --> 01:40:05.817]  All these new books and t-shirts, $9.95, normally $19.95.
[01:40:06.197 --> 01:40:06.957]  Made in America.
[01:40:07.498 --> 01:40:10.200]  Folks, a made in America extra extra large costs $6.
[01:40:11.101 --> 01:40:13.343]  Extra large, $5.50 or so.
[01:40:14.344 --> 01:40:15.004]  A large, $5.00.
[01:40:15.585 --> 01:40:16.626]  A medium, $4.00.
[01:40:16.826 --> 01:40:20.629]  I mean, we make a few bucks on these at $9.95.
[01:40:20.749 --> 01:40:21.590]  I don't care!
[01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:24.092]  It's about just getting it out to you.
[01:40:24.112 --> 01:40:27.655]  $9.95 right now on the package deals with the t-shirts.
[01:40:28.479 --> 01:40:30.080]  It's about getting the word out.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.821]  It's about exposing the murdering criminal traitors.
[01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:39.605]  And look, if you don't get excited and angry about all the stuff that's happening, there's something wrong with you folks.
[01:40:39.645 --> 01:40:42.766]  And I know there isn't something wrong with a lot of you, so get involved in the fight.
[01:40:42.786 --> 01:40:43.967]  I want to commend those that have.
[01:40:44.327 --> 01:40:47.229]  So go to infowarriors.com and order via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.570]  Or go to presentplanet.tv and get a membership there.
[01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:52.551]  Or you can also write to me, Alex Jones at 3001
[01:40:54.898 --> 01:41:00.561]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:41:01.742 --> 01:41:04.883]  Alright, I never even really asked for this job.
[01:41:04.903 --> 01:41:05.664]  If you would have told me...
[01:41:06.784 --> 01:41:12.967]  Ten years ago, eleven years ago, when I marched down and got an Axis TV show, then got a radio show, and then got a syndicated radio show.
[01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:14.107]  I never imagined this.
[01:41:14.147 --> 01:41:15.007]  I never thought this.
[01:41:15.568 --> 01:41:17.608]  I was frustrated by government being corrupt.
[01:41:18.009 --> 01:41:19.729]  I was frustrated by the police state.
[01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:21.270]  And I got involved.
[01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:25.732]  And I'm telling you, there's a lot of you that are more eloquent, more intelligent, more dynamic, more informed.
[01:41:26.072 --> 01:41:28.073]  A lot of you with more capital than I've got.
[01:41:29.273 --> 01:41:31.394]  And I just want you to get involved in the info war.
[01:41:32.315 --> 01:41:34.335]  I just want you to get involved in fighting the New World Order.
[01:41:34.375 --> 01:41:35.616]  If you don't, we're going to lose.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:41.481]  We'd already be toast if it wasn't for the millions of you out there on the front lines of the fight, and I salute you.
[01:41:41.661 --> 01:41:43.921]  And I'll say this right now, then I'm going back to your calls in the news.
[01:41:46.622 --> 01:41:49.262]  I am ashamed of a lot of the other so-called patriots.
[01:41:50.823 --> 01:41:51.903]  I really am ashamed of them.
[01:41:51.923 --> 01:41:53.423]  I mean, I'm so proud of my crew.
[01:41:54.183 --> 01:42:03.645]  I'm so honored and thankful for the quality of listeners and activists we have, and freedom lovers, those of the truth movement, patriots.
[01:42:04.562 --> 01:42:14.612]  Truth seekers, whatever label you want to hang on yourself, Christians, Libertarians, whatever, ilk you are that loves freedom out there, and hates lies, and hates tyranny, and doesn't want to live as a slave.
[01:42:16.614 --> 01:42:19.357]  The quality of the people is exemplary.
[01:42:20.097 --> 01:42:20.998]  We have the best.
[01:42:21.058 --> 01:42:27.064]  We have the most loving, and most angry, and most focused, and most serious people out there.
[01:42:27.925 --> 01:42:28.646]  It runs the gamut.
[01:42:29.605 --> 01:42:36.946]  The most informed, the most honorable people, because people who've been in the system who aren't evil know we're telling the truth and come over to our side immediately.
[01:42:37.306 --> 01:42:43.488]  Then you've got sickos that like the power and just go along with the evil, but their place has already been made for them.
[01:42:45.828 --> 01:42:49.649]  But I hear stuff all the time locally on the radio that just embarrasses me.
[01:42:49.689 --> 01:42:51.009]  I mean, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:42:52.209 --> 01:42:54.030]  And I struggle with talking about it.
[01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:56.310]  I control myself and I don't.
[01:42:57.489 --> 01:43:00.371]  But I'm tired of being associated with things that I'm not.
[01:43:00.871 --> 01:43:04.734]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:43:05.435 --> 01:43:07.156]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:43:07.576 --> 01:43:11.279]  And frankly, sometimes folks, there are sponsors on this network that I don't even like.
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.080]  But you know what?
[01:43:14.341 --> 01:43:18.684]  The network is free speech, open, and that's the way it is.
[01:43:18.724 --> 01:43:20.085]  But I've even made comments about that.
[01:43:20.726 --> 01:43:34.197]  But I've bit my tongue about other networks and other individuals who are just absolutely despicable and who were bullies and who people have put up with far too long.
[01:43:35.598 --> 01:43:48.648]  And it's just been a weight on my chest to watch somebody move into our town who's not from here, to be friendly, to be nice, to watch all sorts of mean and abusive behavior towards people.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:44:08.891]  To then even try to be nice and work with those people, put up with it, then quietly get away from them, then watch them be so mean to people, and watch them beat up audiences, and hear stuff like, you know, send me your inheritance or if you're going to die, or max out your credit cards to me.
[01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:11.693]  I mean, we couldn't ask for worse PR.
[01:44:14.617 --> 01:44:16.839]  We couldn't ask for more embarrassing PR.
[01:44:16.939 --> 01:44:23.586]  The New World Order couldn't pay for better, you know, their gold couldn't buy better propaganda against us.
[01:44:26.869 --> 01:44:34.616]  The type of racial stuff I've heard, the type of, just you name it, and I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:44:34.956 --> 01:44:37.479]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network,
[01:44:38.277 --> 01:44:39.298]  And we do the best we can.
[01:44:39.318 --> 01:44:40.379]  We've got a lot of great hosts.
[01:44:40.479 --> 01:44:44.802]  None of us are perfect, but I know this is a strong group of people that really care about the country.
[01:44:44.882 --> 01:44:51.827]  And then, you know, to see other good people surrounding some of the bad people that are associated with other networks, other operations.
[01:44:52.328 --> 01:44:54.950]  I mean, over the years, the stuff I've taken from other outfits.
[01:44:56.568 --> 01:45:08.352]  You know, so-called Christian media outfits, just bilging pure lies, just total theater, total Shakespearean events.
[01:45:08.832 --> 01:45:09.552]  I've just taken it.
[01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:20.576]  But that's because it wasn't in my town, and it wasn't over my head, and it wasn't embarrassing day in and day out during prime time drive.
[01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.769]  And people don't listen.
[01:45:24.209 --> 01:45:25.069]  We talk about it all the time.
[01:45:25.089 --> 01:45:27.950]  People don't even think about where a beefsteak comes from at the store.
[01:45:28.391 --> 01:45:30.972]  People don't think about where a show comes off satellite.
[01:45:30.992 --> 01:45:32.392]  Well, how are you on different cities?
[01:45:32.792 --> 01:45:35.853]  People don't know they hear my show on the same stations as other shows.
[01:45:36.634 --> 01:45:46.117]  And I just want people to know, tuning into these local stations, that if it doesn't say Genesis or it isn't Alex Jones, then it's not me.
[01:45:47.038 --> 01:45:50.539]  Because I'm tired of getting emails going, I hear your show's going down.
[01:45:52.266 --> 01:45:52.847]  Every day!
[01:45:53.027 --> 01:46:01.836]  Because they associate me with this other network and this other individual who does everything he can to basically blend in and kind of gray the two.
[01:46:03.474 --> 01:46:15.644]  And then people who have said all these horrible things about me the last few years that I've put up with, they're shocked then when I just, with a glancing blow, defend myself and go, please, stop the embarrassment, please, stop the travesty.
[01:46:15.844 --> 01:46:17.806]  And they call up and go, how dare you, boy!
[01:46:17.946 --> 01:46:20.208]  You shut your mouth or I'm coming down there!
[01:46:20.628 --> 01:46:21.849]  You don't talk about me!
[01:46:22.029 --> 01:46:23.670]  Well, you're talking about me, punk!
[01:46:24.992 --> 01:46:26.012]  You're an embarrassment!
[01:46:26.032 --> 01:46:26.913]  You're a travesty!
[01:46:27.093 --> 01:46:27.854]  You're a bully!
[01:46:28.054 --> 01:46:29.635]  You make me sick!
[01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.637]  You and your network make me sick!
[01:46:34.286 --> 01:46:35.527]  And you need to understand that.
[01:46:35.927 --> 01:46:40.069]  And the poor delusional individual thinks it's because this show isn't growing and isn't doing well?
[01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:43.411]  We just signed five new affiliates this week.
[01:46:44.132 --> 01:46:49.495]  The Genesis Network, for the first time in its history, is growing by leaps and bounds, not slowly growing.
[01:46:50.235 --> 01:46:53.397]  Midas Resources, obviously you can tell, is doing well.
[01:46:53.617 --> 01:46:55.799]  Thank God, and we're putting it into satellites.
[01:46:55.979 --> 01:46:59.061]  And here at my operation, we're putting it into more employees.
[01:46:59.081 --> 01:47:01.242]  Just hired two more people to join the team.
[01:47:02.907 --> 01:47:04.549]  So that's how delusional you are.
[01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:05.469]  Stick that in your pipe.
[01:47:05.650 --> 01:47:10.814]  It's because in my town, where I'm from, I've woken all these people up thanks to the good Austinites.
[01:47:11.335 --> 01:47:13.757]  We've made this the capital in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:47:14.037 --> 01:47:20.963]  And then some carpetbagger comes down here and thinks he's gonna tell me what to do and gonna threaten me to shut my mouth.
[01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:23.586]  I'll say whatever I want, whenever I want.
[01:47:24.597 --> 01:47:26.118]  I'm not afraid of the New World Order.
[01:47:26.658 --> 01:47:28.439]  I've had thugs attack me in parking lots.
[01:47:28.619 --> 01:47:31.660]  I've had special forces threaten me and stick their finger in my chest.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:38.183]  I'm not certainly afraid of some pencil-necked little coward who likes to go around talking about how big and bad he is.
[01:47:38.423 --> 01:47:41.965]  Real men don't talk about how big and bad they are all day.
[01:47:42.225 --> 01:47:44.166]  Now get out of here, you little carpetbagger!
[01:47:44.386 --> 01:47:46.407]  Nobody should support the carpetbagger!
[01:47:46.567 --> 01:47:48.408]  The carpetbagger needs to leave!
[01:47:49.949 --> 01:47:50.469]  Period!
[01:47:52.822 --> 01:47:55.965]  And if I had the time, I'd definitely write a bunch of news articles about it.
[01:47:56.245 --> 01:47:57.226]  I've made the decision to do it.
[01:47:57.266 --> 01:48:04.152]  I'm just so busy with radio interviews and trying to make films and trying to talk to people and trying to get the job done.
[01:48:07.695 --> 01:48:08.675]  So, there, I've said it.
[01:48:09.116 --> 01:48:10.497]  I know people have been holding.
[01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:15.621]  We're going to go to Michael and Matt and Steve when we get back, very quickly.
[01:48:17.343 --> 01:48:20.946]  But I mean, seriously, folks, and I've said this before about other so-called patriot groups.
[01:48:22.006 --> 01:48:23.287]  And I've tried to be light about it.
[01:48:23.327 --> 01:48:27.148]  I've tried to not focus that much on it, because so many others have spent all their time on this.
[01:48:27.568 --> 01:48:30.249]  Most of them are egomaniacs who are all on power trips.
[01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:36.552]  Who literally all see cutting everybody else down as making themselves the king daddies.
[01:48:37.252 --> 01:48:47.556]  Let me tell you something, when I see Jimmy Walter making a half million copies of 9-11 videos and giving them out, I go, thank God, I hope he becomes the big cheese, because he'll be the first target I want.
[01:48:48.737 --> 01:48:51.760]  Seriously, I'm trying to survive here by growing our numbers.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.861]  That's how we save America.
[01:48:53.122 --> 01:48:54.363]  I literally know the cost.
[01:48:54.683 --> 01:48:56.645]  I literally know how serious this is.
[01:48:57.506 --> 01:48:58.526]  I don't like doing this.
[01:48:58.707 --> 01:49:02.750]  I would literally like to have a business and be fishing half the time and hanging out with my family.
[01:49:02.971 --> 01:49:04.432]  This is serious, stressful work.
[01:49:04.652 --> 01:49:07.034]  This stuff freaks me out.
[01:49:07.275 --> 01:49:09.857]  I'm a very dedicated, serious person.
[01:49:11.418 --> 01:49:13.100]  I mean, it is simple.
[01:49:14.185 --> 01:49:16.066]  And so for me, this is all life and death.
[01:49:16.106 --> 01:49:17.466]  This is all real serious.
[01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:24.428]  And I'm tired of all the babies, and all the big mouths, and all the primadonnas, and all the snipers, and all of them running around doing what they do.
[01:49:24.928 --> 01:49:30.029]  Anytime you hear one of these people bashing and attacking and doing this, you should turn them off immediately.
[01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:32.850]  Because it's nothing but destructive.
[01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:33.730]  And I'm tired.
[01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:39.012]  I think of all the average people that tune in to hear what patriots are saying, and all they hear is a bunch of embarrassing garbage.
[01:49:39.895 --> 01:49:41.478]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
[01:49:41.719 --> 01:49:42.921]  I want to thank all of them.
[01:49:43.122 --> 01:49:45.807]  Thank God we're growing and we're reaching so many people.
[01:49:50.336 --> 01:49:57.181]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:49:57.481 --> 01:49:58.862]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:49:59.042 --> 01:50:01.263]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:01.403 --> 01:50:03.505]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:03.785 --> 01:50:08.708]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:09.048 --> 01:50:13.071]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:13.331 --> 01:50:15.111]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:25.813]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.973 --> 01:50:27.854]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:28.074 --> 01:50:31.954]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:50:32.034 --> 01:50:33.595]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:33.615 --> 01:50:34.115]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:40.396 --> 01:50:43.801]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:50:43.862 --> 01:50:45.104]  I'll give them that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:53.784]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:54.024 --> 01:50:59.468]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:50:59.728 --> 01:51:10.116]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:10.276 --> 01:51:14.599]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:14.819 --> 01:51:18.402]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine
[01:51:18.462 --> 01:51:19.302]  We're good to go!
[01:51:48.427 --> 01:51:48.727]  I think so.
[01:52:06.563 --> 01:52:07.163]  I think so.
[01:52:26.735 --> 01:52:26.995]  I think so.
[01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:53.798]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:53.818 --> 01:52:57.720]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:59.941 --> 01:53:13.289]  I mean, imagine waking people up, taking a town from nobody knowing what's going on to a town that's awake, and then having somebody just show up and start ordering you around and talking bad about you every day, and then saying you're supposed to sit there and take it and love it, and then watch them squeeze their audience.
[01:53:14.249 --> 01:53:17.451]  Well, now get ready to be squeezed back, punklet.
[01:53:18.105 --> 01:53:22.803]  Now, Steve Mason has been holding patiently to tell us about
[01:53:23.582 --> 01:53:26.243]  We were talking about martial law last hour.
[01:53:26.263 --> 01:53:28.124]  We were talking about the police state last hour.
[01:53:28.144 --> 01:53:33.846]  We were talking about how they're openly going to have the TSA patrolling our lives and on the streets.
[01:53:34.346 --> 01:53:35.967]  The streets will be like the airports.
[01:53:36.027 --> 01:53:37.347]  The malls will be like the airports.
[01:53:37.367 --> 01:53:39.048]  This is now happening.
[01:53:39.268 --> 01:53:40.388]  Not next week, not next month.
[01:53:40.428 --> 01:53:43.229]  It's now happening and will expand out nationwide.
[01:53:43.569 --> 01:53:50.332]  Well now, the minute men, if they try to come to Austin, they're trying to pass an ordinance where the police are going to surveil them and try to arrest them and harass them.
[01:53:51.353 --> 01:53:56.274]  And they're also trying to pass a law to restrict any type of protesting, calling it the New Order Ordinance.
[01:53:57.135 --> 01:53:59.955]  So, a really serious police state here domestically.
[01:54:00.356 --> 01:54:01.636]  Steve, tell us about it real quick.
[01:54:02.496 --> 01:54:05.477]  It's number item 55 tomorrow on the city agenda.
[01:54:05.517 --> 01:54:07.117]  The city council meeting starts at 10.
[01:54:07.177 --> 01:54:08.858]  I don't know how long it's going to take them to get to number 55.
[01:54:08.898 --> 01:54:14.139]  But it's being submitted by council member Aztec Alvarez.
[01:54:14.739 --> 01:54:16.460]  Resolution number 2005.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.221]  It specifically mentions the Minutemen, refers to us as vigilantes.
[01:54:21.176 --> 01:54:43.426]  uh... implies racism and all this kind of stuff because of all the gushy stuff about uh... uh... the beautiful cultural diversity that illegal aliens bring to the town that sort of thing and uh... makes reference to the fact that it's sanctuary city uh... the resolution to declare it to be a safety zone and section four at the end of it this is the part that gets me
[01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:51.496]  Uh, it goes, upon passage of this resolution, the Austin City Council will assign staff to work with local community leaders and organization.
[01:54:51.516 --> 01:55:01.848]  Staff will produce a quarterly report that monitors the movement of and offers recommendations to regulate the activities of vigilante groups in Austin in order to preserve our everyday common peace.
[01:55:02.468 --> 01:55:03.930]  They're referring to us as vigilantes.
[01:55:05.083 --> 01:55:18.034]  No, they're creating a commissariat board to direct the police after the Minutemen who sit in lawn chairs with video cameras and glasses, binoculars, calling the Border Patrol.
[01:55:18.694 --> 01:55:24.619]  Meanwhile, they want us to join the Pentagon and Neighborhood Secure Corps program to tattle on our neighbors.
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.341]  That's okay.
[01:55:26.361 --> 01:55:27.522]  Let's tattle on each other.
[01:55:28.408 --> 01:55:33.670]  But, uh, let's not report the illegal aliens that are pouring... It's just everywhere.
[01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:34.430]  It's a joke.
[01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:36.851]  Let me tell you what's insidious about this, okay?
[01:55:36.871 --> 01:55:47.435]  Because the minute men do plan to start monitoring day labor sites and the employers that use these illegal aliens... What's insidious about this thing is this resolution was drawn up by the Quakers and the American Friends Service Committee.
[01:55:48.736 --> 01:55:50.116]  And we know we're a communist front.
[01:55:50.997 --> 01:55:54.058]  And I can say this because I was brought up Quaker and I know what they're like.
[01:55:54.727 --> 01:56:01.750]  Well, there's no front about it, Bob, but I mean, they have their right to do that, and they're a bunch of misguided socialists, and I would say sometimes commies.
[01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:06.231]  Well, if they have a picture of Che Guevara in their newsletter, they're communists.
[01:56:06.752 --> 01:56:07.512]  Yeah.
[01:56:07.772 --> 01:56:10.593]  They're also Mexican supremacists, but we could... Oh, yeah!
[01:56:10.633 --> 01:56:11.673]  Planta San Diego!
[01:56:11.733 --> 01:56:13.414]  I mean, look, I'm not against Hispanics.
[01:56:13.694 --> 01:56:15.875]  Most Hispanics are pro-America, and they are American.
[01:56:16.195 --> 01:56:18.896]  These guys are out promoting killing all white males above the age of 16.
[01:56:19.977 --> 01:56:23.318]  But get this, the American French Service Committee, the Quakers,
[01:56:24.597 --> 01:56:28.759]  are affiliated with this outlaw who are a truly vigilante group called Anti-Racist Action.
[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:30.600]  They do run around beating people up nationwide.
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:33.522]  We've got video of it from New Mexico to LA.
[01:56:34.242 --> 01:56:35.183]  You've been attacked by them.
[01:56:35.203 --> 01:56:36.464]  In fact, Steve, that was on the news.
[01:56:36.784 --> 01:56:37.704]  They savaged you.
[01:56:37.724 --> 01:56:38.865]  Right in front of the police.
[01:56:38.885 --> 01:56:40.086]  They started beating you and choking you.
[01:56:40.746 --> 01:56:41.727]  Yeah, this is the problem.
[01:56:41.767 --> 01:56:42.287]  What was that?
[01:56:42.307 --> 01:56:43.007]  Two months ago?
[01:56:43.188 --> 01:56:43.868]  Yeah.
[01:56:44.468 --> 01:56:49.251]  Oh, and they also came at us again November 17th and the police stood there and let them get in our face and harass us.
[01:56:49.887 --> 01:56:59.253]  And it pushed it so far to the edge that it tried to provoke... That's right, at the Capitol, they wouldn't let us get up within 100 yards of them, but they'll, oh, just let them do whatever they want.
[01:56:59.273 --> 01:57:00.734]  Look, Steve, we're out of time tomorrow.
[01:57:01.054 --> 01:57:01.875]  People should be there.
[01:57:01.895 --> 01:57:06.458]  I mean, this is just Soviet commissariat, normal behavior across the board.
[01:57:06.498 --> 01:57:07.078]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:07.839 --> 01:57:08.499]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:09.960]  I really do.
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:14.143]  Alright, yeah, it's serious business.
[01:57:15.971 --> 01:57:21.656]  I mean, look, how can these groups say kill all white males above the age of 16 and there's no call to monitor them?
[01:57:23.197 --> 01:57:25.239]  I mean, frankly, the Minutemen are milk to us, folks.
[01:57:25.279 --> 01:57:26.400]  It's pretty tame stuff.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:29.262]  We'll be right back with the third hour with your calls from Paul Watson.
[01:57:30.523 --> 01:57:34.767]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:46.339 --> 01:57:46.980]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.720]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:50.601]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:52.001]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:54.662]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.682 --> 01:57:58.003]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.503 --> 01:58:02.584]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.987 --> 01:58:13.349]  Yeah, I think.
[01:58:19.517 --> 01:58:21.038]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:21.098 --> 01:58:26.302]  We are now into our number three, Paul Joseph Watson, with his masses of news and analysis.
[01:58:26.942 --> 01:58:28.143]  Always great when he joins us.
[01:58:28.183 --> 01:58:29.344]  He's coming up in about eight minutes.
[01:58:29.364 --> 01:58:30.364]  I'm going to take a few of your calls.
[01:58:30.424 --> 01:58:31.145]  I'm holding the longest.
[01:58:31.565 --> 01:58:33.006]  Sorry to hear that Marty and Steve hung up.
[01:58:33.026 --> 01:58:36.648]  Matt and Steve, I've just been ranting and raving.
[01:58:36.708 --> 01:58:39.370]  As you know, Michael in Louisiana, then Alex in Mass.
[01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:40.811]  We'll get to you guys right now.
[01:58:40.871 --> 01:58:41.972]  Michael, go ahead, sir.
[01:58:42.312 --> 01:58:42.912]  How you doing, sir?
[01:58:43.353 --> 01:58:43.893]  Good, my friend.
[01:58:44.834 --> 01:58:48.356]  Real quick, regarding a hurricane down here, Hurricane Katrina.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:49.120]  I think?
[01:59:00.475 --> 01:59:07.837]  They announced they had some military exercises in New Orleans and that the people shouldn't be surprised if they see troops, you know, scaling down the side of buildings.
[01:59:08.137 --> 01:59:11.938]  You know, I remember that and that's something that fell into the memory hole that I forgot about.
[01:59:11.958 --> 01:59:14.858]  Can somebody Google-y that to me and I'll try to do an article on it?
[01:59:15.018 --> 01:59:17.039]  Yeah, yeah, you might be able to find it on NOLA.com.
[01:59:17.059 --> 01:59:18.719]  That's where I found the article and was shocked.
[01:59:18.759 --> 01:59:22.200]  I think I called into your show, you know, when that happened.
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.160]  That's the problem.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:26.121]  There's too much happening to keep track of all this.
[01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:30.062]  Yeah, but I guess it was just a run-through to get used to what streets are what when they do come for real, you know?
[01:59:30.498 --> 01:59:30.738]  Yes.
[01:59:31.419 --> 01:59:36.061]  But then the other thing is you see these different plans of how they're going to redevelop.
[01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:40.564]  And they just have, I think it's KB Homes getting ready to come in here and build thousands and thousands of homes.
[01:59:40.664 --> 01:59:45.287]  Well, as we predicted, they're going to gut most of the Ninth Ward and build a park there.
[01:59:45.347 --> 01:59:46.688]  So they're just going to steal that property.
[01:59:46.928 --> 01:59:47.308]  Oh, sure.
[01:59:47.449 --> 01:59:56.054]  And their fatalistic paradigm that they create for people to make the decision that they, of course, plan to, that they know what the decision is going to be.
[01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:57.731]  It's ridiculous.
[01:59:57.791 --> 02:00:10.156]  I mean, just quoting a couple of things is just like, you know, unless some local or state federal government steps in, some homeowners are going to end up scrimping to save and rebuild a house next door to a house that's abandoned and that never gets fixed.
[02:00:10.477 --> 02:00:11.397]  You know, what can we do?
[02:00:11.417 --> 02:00:12.477]  That type of thing.
[02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:15.399]  And then they say, okay, there's only one way to avoid this.
[02:00:15.479 --> 02:00:22.002]  And that's for the federal government to have the ability to gain access to privately owned properties that are abandoned or left to molder.
[02:00:22.412 --> 02:00:24.614]  And plan their future use in a cohesive way.
[02:00:24.974 --> 02:00:26.034]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[02:00:26.054 --> 02:00:37.402]  Well, the plan's already been announced to flood part of New Orleans and make it a little lake, and then have Greenbelt around it, and huge, lavish motels, casinos, hotels all around it.
[02:00:37.982 --> 02:00:40.804]  Oh yeah, on all the talk shows, that's what they talk about.
[02:00:40.824 --> 02:00:42.425]  It's like, oh, why is nobody doing anything?
[02:00:42.485 --> 02:00:46.188]  Everyone's, you know, just, they don't trust us, and we have a terrible image.
[02:00:46.656 --> 02:00:51.739]  And so they get this, they create this sense of desperation until it crescendos at the point where... That's simple!
[02:00:51.819 --> 02:00:53.300]  I mean, look at what the old-timers do!
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:56.321]  Your house better be on stilts if you live in the floodplain, duh!
[02:00:56.781 --> 02:00:57.622]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:57.942 --> 02:01:00.503]  And, you know, it's like, well, what about, how about let the free market go in there?
[02:01:00.623 --> 02:01:05.326]  If the guy wasn't prepared, and he, his home was destroyed by a hurricane, guess what?
[02:01:05.871 --> 02:01:10.072]  By the way, you know those people that had their guns taken and never got them back?
[02:01:11.272 --> 02:01:11.452]  Yep.
[02:01:11.912 --> 02:01:16.353]  Are the Mexican troops still stomping around that area?
[02:01:17.173 --> 02:01:19.813]  I haven't seen any reports of that lately.
[02:01:20.834 --> 02:01:22.234]  I haven't seen any of that.
[02:01:22.934 --> 02:01:29.495]  Again, I went down there on Thanksgiving to help give out some food to some folks with our church.
[02:01:31.355 --> 02:01:32.716]  Tumbleweed is blown across the place.
[02:01:32.796 --> 02:01:33.836]  It's a ghost town down there.
[02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:36.749]  I mean there's just, there's just nothing.
[02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:40.650]  A lot of, I mean just neighborhoods and neighborhoods in New Orleans East especially.
[02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.231]  It's just, it's not real until you drive through it.
[02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:48.212]  You know, you realize you're driving for miles and miles and there's hardly anybody there.
[02:01:48.232 --> 02:01:49.092]  It's amazing.
[02:01:49.492 --> 02:01:52.372]  Just a few Blackwater armored vehicles driving around?
[02:01:52.912 --> 02:01:57.773]  Yeah, when you see your Humvees, that's probably, you know, half the cars you see were Humvees.
[02:01:58.654 --> 02:02:00.574]  And military troops driving around, if not any other.
[02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:02.911]  You know, at least that's my experience.
[02:02:03.531 --> 02:02:05.111]  All right, thank you for the call, sir.
[02:02:05.192 --> 02:02:05.892]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:05.912 --> 02:02:09.073]  We'll get to Alex and others here early in the interview with Paul Watson.
[02:02:10.494 --> 02:02:12.875]  I want to get back into this martial law situation.
[02:02:12.895 --> 02:02:14.215]  They're just coming right out with it.
[02:02:14.235 --> 02:02:15.176]  We're in it right now.
[02:02:16.176 --> 02:02:17.457]  And what are a lot of the Patriots doing?
[02:02:17.577 --> 02:02:27.021]  Whining and sucking their thumbs and talking about how they're the only ones and how great they are and spewing a bunch of kooky garbage that makes us sound like a bunch of fruit loops.
[02:02:28.914 --> 02:02:30.336]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:31.538]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:02:31.598 --> 02:02:36.185]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[02:02:36.225 --> 02:02:38.068]  Be sure and check them out today!
[02:02:38.088 --> 02:02:38.669]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:43.214 --> 02:02:46.055]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:46.315 --> 02:02:47.895]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:48.235 --> 02:02:52.917]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:53.257 --> 02:02:57.678]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:02:58.098 --> 02:03:02.299]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:02.499 --> 02:03:05.340]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:07.941]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:03:08.141 --> 02:03:10.082]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:10.302 --> 02:03:14.704]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:14.944 --> 02:03:22.167]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:22.427 --> 02:03:24.848]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:25.008 --> 02:03:26.789]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:37.655 --> 02:03:44.120]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:48.363]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:48.463 --> 02:03:51.366]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:51.426 --> 02:03:58.111]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:01.296]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:01.516 --> 02:04:03.900]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:14.195]  Like murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:04:14.395 --> 02:04:23.520]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:31.424]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:31.664]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:31.684 --> 02:04:33.045]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:41.883 --> 02:04:43.845]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:04:43.905 --> 02:04:46.789]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:04:46.989 --> 02:04:52.375]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:04:52.615 --> 02:04:54.117]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:04:54.177 --> 02:04:56.420]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:00.084]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:05:00.464 --> 02:05:02.505]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:05:02.565 --> 02:05:06.006]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[02:05:06.147 --> 02:05:09.488]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:15.371]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[02:05:15.651 --> 02:05:23.074]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property or make it look like you own no property and a whole lot more.
[02:05:23.154 --> 02:05:26.995]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:27.015 --> 02:05:28.956]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.184 --> 02:06:03.629]  Oh, just a program note.
[02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:04.770]  I made it in the first hour.
[02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:13.674]  There have been hiccups on our internet surfing during my show because so many tens of thousands of people try to tune in each hour just over the internet.
[02:06:15.559 --> 02:06:23.586]  It's been having hiccups, so we've added a small supplemental stream of 500 at Infowars.com.
[02:06:23.706 --> 02:06:33.295]  It says new stream there, and over the next few days we're going to add at least a thousand more there, and so you can just start, I guess, moving over to those streams.
[02:06:33.335 --> 02:06:37.239]  It's been two weeks, and there have been many attempts to upgrade and fix things, but
[02:06:39.036 --> 02:06:41.937]  Finally gotten some of the big cheeses to be aware that there is a problem.
[02:06:42.337 --> 02:06:45.218]  But we're just moving forward with our own redundant systems here.
[02:06:45.598 --> 02:06:47.559]  Because the info war will continue.
[02:06:48.099 --> 02:06:49.960]  And, you know, it's growing pains.
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:51.340]  So many people want to listen to it.
[02:06:52.541 --> 02:06:54.482]  It causes problems for one, two machines.
[02:06:54.522 --> 02:06:58.683]  Or you've got two machines and one machine hiccups and the other machine can't handle all the people.
[02:07:01.344 --> 02:07:06.526]  And we'll now go ahead and go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:07:07.362 --> 02:07:09.964]  And Paul Watson, good to have you on with us, my friend.
[02:07:10.585 --> 02:07:11.706]  Good to be on the air, Alex.
[02:07:12.467 --> 02:07:12.887]  You bet.
[02:07:13.187 --> 02:07:14.348]  So much has happened.
[02:07:14.768 --> 02:07:18.392]  We just heard a little clip there a second ago from Australian TV.
[02:07:19.272 --> 02:07:22.895]  And your brother did a piece on it where they're talking to Americans, how many countries should we attack?
[02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:24.537]  And most of them said unlimited.
[02:07:24.557 --> 02:07:25.618]  Let's just attack France.
[02:07:25.658 --> 02:07:27.159]  Let's attack everybody.
[02:07:27.199 --> 02:07:31.763]  Why do you think we see this mentality from the US and England to some extent?
[02:07:34.407 --> 02:07:39.949]  Well, it's mainly due to people's total and complete ignorance.
[02:07:40.509 --> 02:07:56.275]  The people who come out and promote that kind of thing, like this guy who promoted torture, Robert Blackwill, former White House advisor, they sell it on twisted logic and mental gymnastics of reasoning that people in large numbers do buy.
[02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:57.355]  They buy the scam.
[02:07:57.415 --> 02:07:59.976]  I mean, that recent Associated Press poll said that
[02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:07.112]  Around 50% of Americans, 50% of Europeans said that torture was acceptable.
[02:08:07.852 --> 02:08:10.415]  Even in cases where it, you know, it was hazy.
[02:08:10.675 --> 02:08:17.841]  Not the old argument about somebody's got a nuke, would you torture them to find out where the bomb is?
[02:08:18.081 --> 02:08:21.084]  Which is completely false debate in the first place.
[02:08:21.985 --> 02:08:25.127]  But those people do look at that and they buy it sometimes and
[02:08:26.024 --> 02:08:36.736]  You know anything that doesn't affect their little life they're not concerned with and as far as they're concerned anybody else can be wiped off the map completely as long as it doesn't affect their little bubble.
[02:08:38.078 --> 02:08:39.299]  Well I agree with you and...
[02:08:40.718 --> 02:08:46.920]  At the same time now, we have Viper teams, patrol mass transit facilities, look for suspicious individuals.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:56.403]  Paul, the official plan was to have the TSA, with the air marshals and the people that shake you down and grope your wife, on the streets, in the malls, and now Houston, Dallas,
[02:08:57.343 --> 02:08:57.923]  Chicago.
[02:08:57.943 --> 02:09:09.485]  I mean, all the major cities in America, San Antonio, I keep mentioning Texas because it's going on in Texas, have these guys in military uniforms aiming MP5s at you with dogs, just randomly searching people.
[02:09:09.505 --> 02:09:19.767]  At the same time, all these other cities like DC, Miami, San Francisco are announcing, oh, we're going to randomly just go out and surround malls and start searching everyone.
[02:09:19.787 --> 02:09:21.048]  You want to comment on this?
[02:09:21.088 --> 02:09:22.368]  I mean, this is martial law.
[02:09:23.553 --> 02:09:28.699]  Well, yeah, we always used to talk about the, you know, incrementalism, the frog boiling in the pot.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.823]  I wrote an article a couple of weeks ago saying, you know, the frog is cooked.
[02:09:33.264 --> 02:09:34.345]  It's already here.
[02:09:34.805 --> 02:09:42.494]  It's just that in the major cities, they'll expand it out using false justifications like this recent incident at Miami.
[02:09:43.528 --> 02:09:53.292]  Um, what they classify as suspicious, that these Viper teams will go out and, um, arrest people on the basis of, is what we've been seeing happening.
[02:09:53.992 --> 02:10:01.256]  Um, crime is terror, the new Patriot Act provisions target, um, speed dealers, terrorists, target protesters as potential terrorists.
[02:10:02.056 --> 02:10:09.439]  And then we have, um, you know, people who sell Subway tokens, um, being regarded as suspicious, that's an arrestable offence.
[02:10:10.071 --> 02:10:17.217]  Not showing your ID when a federal storm trooper on a bus demands it, as in the case of Deborah Davis.
[02:10:17.277 --> 02:10:20.880]  Or in Dallas, jaywalking with your son, 11 days in jail.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:31.028]  And with a token, it was a 42-year-old businessman in a suit, and a woman, the machine was broke, he sold it to her at price, and the cop, of course, roughed him up and arrested him.
[02:10:31.048 --> 02:10:34.391]  You know, it's this pregnant woman sitting down on the sidewalk, arrested.
[02:10:34.711 --> 02:10:37.854]  It's this maximum abuse, this maximum in our face.
[02:10:39.369 --> 02:10:42.491]  Yeah, and there are no terrorists running around whatsoever.
[02:10:42.991 --> 02:10:50.316]  And they try and create, you know, comic book horror characters like Al Zarka, who always turn out to even not exist, you know, they've already captured them.
[02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:55.599]  There's no real terrorists running around, certainly no terrorists in American cities.
[02:10:56.164 --> 02:10:58.786]  So they have to be seen to be doing something.
[02:10:59.767 --> 02:11:05.251]  Anyone in a position of authority who's got a boss and has nothing to do... Yeah, they're generating the terror.
[02:11:05.371 --> 02:11:11.256]  They're generating the fear with thousands of drills which psychologically are seen as real by the subconscious mind.
[02:11:11.636 --> 02:11:13.878]  By these little fake truck bombs they do.
[02:11:13.958 --> 02:11:28.131]  Meanwhile, real terror attacks like the Mexican Mafia and Los Zetas killing 800 plus and blowing up trucks in Dallas and machine gunning and rocket attacks and the State Department saying South Texas is more dangerous than Israel, that's kept totally quiet.
[02:11:29.372 --> 02:11:29.752]  Exactly.
[02:11:29.792 --> 02:11:34.597]  We said they'll move all the stuff in the airports out onto the streets.
[02:11:35.077 --> 02:11:36.679]  First they'll move it to trains, buses,
[02:11:37.634 --> 02:11:39.196]  Then they'll move it out onto the streets.
[02:11:39.596 --> 02:11:41.898]  That's what we said would happen, and it's happening down the line.
[02:11:41.918 --> 02:11:43.480]  And I've got a report that's finally coming out.
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.220]  We've got a few weeks to go.
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.042]  We've got the video and the photos of all of it.
[02:11:46.543 --> 02:11:51.728]  A report for the TV show tonight, then I'm going to have it on the web tomorrow for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:11:52.789 --> 02:11:58.534]  Zachary Middle School down there with the troops, quote, because the kids have been being a little bit rough.
[02:11:58.554 --> 02:12:00.056]  The troops are here to tell them how to be good.
[02:12:01.926 --> 02:12:22.497]  Yeah, and with the transport situation, every six months, just to keep the fear-mongering alive, they'll have a de-mengezes, or an Alpizar incident, where a terrorist, terrorist in inverted commas, is about to bomb public transport and, you know, the brave TSA or Air Marshal shoot them dead.
[02:12:23.439 --> 02:12:33.265]  The public sees that, the initial story and the big scaremongering, but they don't see the evidence that comes out literally two days later, and then the investigations after the fact.
[02:12:33.385 --> 02:12:40.709]  That nobody said bomb, that Menendez wasn't running, that he wasn't wearing a coat, that he bought a newspaper, that they sat on him and killed him execution style.
[02:12:40.929 --> 02:12:43.771]  That this last guy didn't say bomb, he didn't do anything, it's the same thing.
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:48.142]  Yeah, but it's all, as we say in England, it's all after the Lord Mayor's Show.
[02:12:48.162 --> 02:12:51.324]  The public is only left with the impression of the initial incident.
[02:12:51.724 --> 02:13:00.209]  I mean, the thing in Miami totally stunk to high heaven because you had the air marshals, the same people in these Viper squads who were going to be pointing guns at Americans.
[02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:11.076]  You had them pointing guns at passengers' heads on that aeroplane as they were supposedly trying to chase this guy who didn't scream that he had a bomb, according to the passengers.
[02:13:11.477 --> 02:13:14.559]  So why were they pointing guns at heads of the passengers?
[02:13:14.639 --> 02:13:16.820]  They didn't want them to see what was happening.
[02:13:16.841 --> 02:13:30.330]  I think that event, from the details, was completely staged to prepare American citizens to accept this kind of authoritarianism and choking tyranny on every form of public transport.
[02:13:30.652 --> 02:13:38.260]  Well, I'm beginning to agree with you how this happened right on the kickoff of... Oh, by the way, TSA are going to be everywhere, in the malls and everywhere.
[02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:44.347]  Remember FBI last year, how they're going to have these scanners and checkpoints in the grocery stores, in the malls?
[02:13:45.507 --> 02:13:53.770]  Imagine, you're trying to go with your family as if real terrorists wouldn't run in and go Allah Akbar and pull their explosive cords in the store and kill the feds.
[02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:59.472]  I mean, he does nothing to keep you safe, even if Muslim terrorists existed out of CIA or Mossad operations.
[02:14:00.032 --> 02:14:02.313]  Well, it's the same as bag searches.
[02:14:02.813 --> 02:14:11.476]  If you're searching the bag of a terrorist who's got a bomb in his bag, is he going to politely stand there while you go and fetch the police and start questioning him?
[02:14:11.556 --> 02:14:13.537]  No, he's going to go insane and detonate the bomb.
[02:14:14.333 --> 02:14:20.516]  A lot of this has sprang from the London bombings, which was direct government involvement.
[02:14:20.536 --> 02:14:21.937]  We've proven it ten times over.
[02:14:22.717 --> 02:14:28.520]  Now the Blair government has refused any investigation of that bombing, any public inquiry.
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:32.182]  They're going to release a document saying what happened.
[02:14:32.382 --> 02:14:35.023]  The government says what happened, and that's the end of it.
[02:14:35.423 --> 02:14:42.767]  Because if there was a real investigation, it would prove that Aswar, the mastermind was MI6, the actual physics of the bombing
[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:46.033]  Um, weren't true to the official version of events.
[02:14:46.233 --> 02:14:48.134]  The bombs came up from underneath the train.
[02:14:48.395 --> 02:14:50.497]  Passengers didn't witness anyone with backpacks.
[02:14:50.977 --> 02:14:59.345]  But it gave them, uh... They, one of the supposed tariffed IDs showed up on a bus and a train showing the planters that they hired planted the wrong IDs in the wrong place.
[02:14:59.365 --> 02:15:04.530]  Yeah, they were buying McDonald's beforehand arguing about not getting enough change.
[02:15:05.771 --> 02:15:12.973]  Their own terrorism experts looked at that, the Metropolitan Police, and came out and said, that is not how a terrorist would act under any circumstances.
[02:15:13.013 --> 02:15:20.335]  Yeah, then their own real criminologists who weren't part of the terror op all said, no, someone had to hide it in their bags.
[02:15:20.355 --> 02:15:21.255]  This is BBC.
[02:15:21.635 --> 02:15:23.676]  And then that got slipped under the rug real fast, folks.
[02:15:24.941 --> 02:15:28.046]  Yeah, obviously you've got the drills which we reported on, which were the cover.
[02:15:28.847 --> 02:15:36.237]  If it went wrong you had suspicious electrical surges, which is probably why they gunned down an innocent man in cold blood, de Menezes.
[02:15:37.031 --> 02:15:45.654]  But it all led to the justification for these choking measures, both in Britain and America, to be brought onto public transport, specifically trains and subways.
[02:15:46.014 --> 02:15:46.534]  Exactly.
[02:15:46.594 --> 02:15:49.395]  And when we get back, well, Houston is just on the streets.
[02:15:50.415 --> 02:15:54.336]  When we get back, I want to get into domestic military spying on us.
[02:15:54.356 --> 02:15:56.277]  And we had the same thing happening when we were in England.
[02:15:56.797 --> 02:15:58.097]  We had cops just walking over.
[02:15:58.117 --> 02:16:00.798]  We could be talking to a little old lady, and they'd say, turn your cameras off.
[02:16:01.178 --> 02:16:01.798]  Not allowed to film.
[02:16:01.818 --> 02:16:02.419]  Well, what's the law?
[02:16:02.439 --> 02:16:03.139]  Well, I said so.
[02:16:03.379 --> 02:16:03.959]  Give me your name.
[02:16:03.999 --> 02:16:06.460]  I'm going to give you a little ticket that you've been putting in our database.
[02:16:07.501 --> 02:16:10.163]  Oh, don't criticize gay adoption or we'll arrest you.
[02:16:10.784 --> 02:16:12.865]  I mean, you've got the same tyranny.
[02:16:12.885 --> 02:16:15.187]  The western world has fallen under martial law.
[02:16:15.748 --> 02:16:29.921]  America is now under what you would call classical martial law with federal viper teams, military police is what they are, military trained police, stomping around randomly in the middle of nowhere when where they need to be is at our ports.
[02:16:30.681 --> 02:16:36.363]  Our international airports and our borders if there was a real threat outside LCIA.
[02:16:36.603 --> 02:16:37.583]  But you said it right, Paul.
[02:16:37.623 --> 02:16:40.384]  This is to domestically train us how to be slaves.
[02:16:41.684 --> 02:16:51.727]  Yeah, and with the Miami Police and the case of Deborah Davis in demanding ID, America is less free than Britain in that sense.
[02:16:51.767 --> 02:16:57.049]  When I visited, Americans are so used to carrying their ID everywhere they go.
[02:16:57.634 --> 02:17:07.332]  That to produce it on the demand of some authority figure is not going to be a big deal to a majority of Americans who are not aware of what the overall agenda is.
[02:17:08.094 --> 02:17:10.278]  If you tried that in Britain it would be because
[02:17:10.962 --> 02:17:12.263]  I don't carry any ID.
[02:17:12.283 --> 02:17:19.630]  I suspect at least 40-50% of British people don't even carry ID because it's never requested for anything, which is why they need it.
[02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:25.075]  In America, only the illegal aliens don't carry it, and the police officially have catch and release.
[02:17:25.115 --> 02:17:27.457]  They are above the law not to be arrested.
[02:17:28.158 --> 02:17:30.040]  And if they are, that's a revolving door, so...
[02:17:31.278 --> 02:17:40.584]  Unless your name is Hans Schmidt or Pablo Escobar, you're a total slave unless you're an illegal alien or an Al-Qaeda terrorist.
[02:17:47.909 --> 02:17:50.011]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:51.172]  One and the same.
[02:17:51.892 --> 02:17:53.233]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:17:56.252 --> 02:18:01.714]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:02.154 --> 02:18:05.275]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:05.535 --> 02:18:07.376]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:07.416 --> 02:18:10.457]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:10.997 --> 02:18:13.218]  Here is reality.
[02:18:13.578 --> 02:18:17.159]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:17.639 --> 02:18:21.300]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:24.702]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.

[02:19:47.644 --> 02:19:50.309]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:50.794 --> 02:19:53.396]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:21.174 --> 02:20:22.615]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:20:22.795 --> 02:20:23.136]  Have you?
[02:20:23.716 --> 02:20:25.237]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:21:49.176 --> 02:21:49.236]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:49.256 --> 02:21:50.158]  Alex and Matt, you're up first.
[02:21:50.178 --> 02:21:50.238]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:58.957 --> 02:22:00.318]  Paul, so much is happening.
[02:22:00.358 --> 02:22:07.320]  So many congressmen are involved, you know, with $800 million in scams for $2 million and bid rigging and corruption.
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:11.781]  They're looting the whole government, crime everywhere, openly setting up a police state.
[02:22:12.382 --> 02:22:17.323]  And then meanwhile, they just announced that, oh, we're actually expanding the Patriot Act.
[02:22:17.363 --> 02:22:24.526]  The changes they're making to, quote, fix it are to make it even worse to go after protesters with federal troops.
[02:22:25.346 --> 02:22:30.868]  And then on top of it, we have all these articles where they go, yeah, the Pentagon's watching you for any reason.
[02:22:31.428 --> 02:22:34.069]  You don't like the military recruiting at your school, recruiting your kid?
[02:22:34.089 --> 02:22:35.630]  Well, the military's going to watch you.
[02:22:36.130 --> 02:22:38.351]  They're really trying to scare us right now.
[02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:43.593]  And what we should be afraid of, folks, is buying into their bullying, then they win.
[02:22:43.633 --> 02:22:48.815]  We've got to stand up now and go, hey baby, this hidden China, back off, Paul.
[02:22:49.955 --> 02:22:50.536]  Well, exactly.
[02:22:51.829 --> 02:23:00.156]  They're trying to put in a stopgap measure whereby the Patriot Act, you know, the initial provisions of it, what's already in it, are expanded by three months.
[02:23:00.716 --> 02:23:08.542]  But, you know, that adds new provisions which make it worse, and then three months after that, they're going to add a whole bunch more and make it twice as worse again.
[02:23:08.562 --> 02:23:12.906]  Then we've got, you know, it's the blasé nature of it.
[02:23:13.126 --> 02:23:17.049]  Condoleezza Rice goes to Europe, tells the EU we don't torture.
[02:23:17.069 --> 02:23:20.292]  The EU responds and says, well, that's good enough for us.
[02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:23.860]  Um, you know, there's no reason to suspect that she'd ever lie.
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:25.321]  I mean, it's never happened before.
[02:23:25.441 --> 02:23:27.621]  But then she said that we don't call it torture.
[02:23:28.862 --> 02:23:33.904]  Yeah, but the fact is it's, you know, it's like one criminal professing innocence to another criminal.
[02:23:33.924 --> 02:23:35.124]  Well, it's like Able Danger.
[02:23:35.164 --> 02:23:37.785]  She said, we never heard of a plan to hijack jets and climb into buildings.
[02:23:37.825 --> 02:23:40.406]  And the specific memo specifically said exactly that.
[02:23:40.426 --> 02:23:41.666]  They're congenital liars.
[02:23:42.567 --> 02:23:48.989]  But then the official report says that the EU were in collaboration with setting up these secret camps and these, um,
[02:23:50.063 --> 02:23:52.424]  Transfers of these torture flights.
[02:23:52.504 --> 02:23:54.885]  Again, they've just been playing the part of a good cop.
[02:23:54.945 --> 02:23:55.966]  It was all on the surface.
[02:23:57.066 --> 02:24:09.972]  Yeah, then we got this piece of scum, Robert Blackwell, former White House advisor, in front of a CFR committee, saying that in some cases, to protect national security, it's okay to torture.
[02:24:10.652 --> 02:24:18.776]  Which is the same reason that Robert McGarvey gave when he ordered his henchmen to make white farmers rape their own children or be killed.
[02:24:19.218 --> 02:24:23.963]  I suppose if any authority figure says it's necessary, then it must be okay.
[02:24:24.164 --> 02:24:27.227]  Saddam Hussein putting people's heads through meat grinders.
[02:24:27.327 --> 02:24:34.115]  Saddam's bad when he does it and should be executed for it, but when the US government does it, you know, it's the new American virtue.
[02:24:35.039 --> 02:24:37.721]  China tortures Falun Gong practitioners.
[02:24:37.781 --> 02:24:40.282]  They say it's for the security of the state.
[02:24:40.322 --> 02:24:41.303]  Does that make it so?
[02:24:41.723 --> 02:24:43.824]  By the way, China just had their own Tiananmen Square.
[02:24:43.864 --> 02:24:46.366]  The people wouldn't give up their whole village and their farming property.
[02:24:46.746 --> 02:24:50.808]  So they just dressed up in black ninja outfits like our cops do and just mowed them all down.
[02:24:51.168 --> 02:24:52.549]  And is our media criticizing it?
[02:24:52.589 --> 02:24:53.250]  No!
[02:24:53.290 --> 02:24:54.370]  See, in the past they would.
[02:24:54.690 --> 02:24:56.892]  Now it's, hey, getting tough on terrorists, eh?
[02:24:57.992 --> 02:25:01.433]  There's one article about it in New York Times and that's it.
[02:25:01.453 --> 02:25:07.094]  They said it's the biggest incident of mass oppression and tyranny in China since Tiananmen Square.
[02:25:07.114 --> 02:25:08.294]  But where's the uproar?
[02:25:08.314 --> 02:25:09.174]  There's no uproar.
[02:25:09.694 --> 02:25:12.295]  Chinese government censored all reporting of it.
[02:25:12.355 --> 02:25:15.255]  Google News has gone lockstep along with that.
[02:25:15.375 --> 02:25:19.516]  They've got key search engines blocking anyone in-country getting it.
[02:25:20.736 --> 02:25:24.197]  Yeah, and then we've got people like Blackwell making these justifications about
[02:25:24.944 --> 02:25:30.407]  If a terrorist has got a nuke and you know where the bomb is, if you torture him, would you torture him?
[02:25:30.927 --> 02:25:34.349]  Which is complete hogwash because he's going to say anything.
[02:25:34.369 --> 02:25:41.993]  You think a psychopathic terrorist who's willing to nuke a city and slaughter millions of people is going to squeal at the first sign of a cattle prod.
[02:25:42.353 --> 02:25:43.754]  You're going to give false information.
[02:25:43.834 --> 02:25:44.995]  It's going to cause false leads.
[02:25:45.075 --> 02:25:47.236]  If anything, it's going to help the attack take place.
[02:25:47.576 --> 02:25:48.597]  Well, they always use that example.
[02:25:48.617 --> 02:25:49.257]  He's got a nuke.
[02:25:49.277 --> 02:25:49.857]  He's going to kill you.
[02:25:49.897 --> 02:25:50.518]  Will you torture him?
[02:25:50.538 --> 02:25:52.519]  But that case will never arise.
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:55.240]  You think he might be a terrorist.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.642]  You picked him up and his family at the checkpoint.
[02:25:57.922 --> 02:25:59.062]  You're a big fat pervert.
[02:25:59.122 --> 02:25:59.763]  Wait for life.
[02:25:59.823 --> 02:26:01.544]  I mean, you know, that's what's really going on.
[02:26:01.564 --> 02:26:04.125]  And then how far does it go?
[02:26:04.926 --> 02:26:05.966]  There was a storyline in 24.
[02:26:07.634 --> 02:26:12.495]  Where they tortured the terrorist suspect's children in order to try and make him talk.
[02:26:12.695 --> 02:26:16.896]  And another piece that you had on your own little brainwashing piece, a show called Spooks in the UK.
[02:26:16.996 --> 02:26:19.736]  Yeah, well it was basically the same plot.
[02:26:19.776 --> 02:26:28.058]  They threatened to torture the child and the terrorist eventually... Which is what the CIA section chief said in the Washington Post in January of 2002.
[02:26:28.138 --> 02:26:29.958]  He said, we tortured their children in front of them.
[02:26:31.479 --> 02:26:33.679]  And then you've got the victims of the actual torture.
[02:26:34.466 --> 02:26:39.368]  Um, Pakistani hill farmers rounded up by gangsters, stole to the US government for $25,000.
[02:26:40.269 --> 02:26:48.552]  And the local CIA section chief again sells the truth and goes, yeah, we'd rob for $25,000 apiece, totally innocent, never even left their villages, sold to us by the Taliban.
[02:26:49.338 --> 02:26:50.659]  But it's equally beneficial.
[02:26:50.719 --> 02:26:55.161]  I mean, the gangsters make the money and the government gets to create the mythical Al-Qaeda groups.
[02:26:55.462 --> 02:26:59.424]  They get to parade them around as the justification to take away our freedom.
[02:27:00.024 --> 02:27:09.029]  Um, to go over military reporting to Abu Ghraib, uh, between 75 and 90% of the Iraqis completely innocent, rounded up at checkpoints for not showing the papers.
[02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:13.432]  Well, I wonder if Americans really want to condone raping people's children.
[02:27:14.432 --> 02:27:17.875]  But, oh, they'll cry and scream when the little girl gets kidnapped on TV?
[02:27:18.135 --> 02:27:19.617]  Oh, but when it happens to an Iraqi?
[02:27:19.737 --> 02:27:20.497]  Good!
[02:27:20.597 --> 02:27:22.099]  It's of the Lord!
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.541]  It's of the Lord!
[02:27:25.322 --> 02:27:26.743]  That's what Pat Robertson says.
[02:27:26.843 --> 02:27:27.884]  Kill Chavez!
[02:27:27.964 --> 02:27:29.365]  It's of the Lord!
[02:27:32.568 --> 02:27:33.489]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.969 --> 02:27:35.591]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.611 --> 02:27:39.174]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.769 --> 02:27:53.156]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:27:54.237 --> 02:28:03.906]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:28:04.827 --> 02:28:11.413]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.241]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:44.361 --> 02:28:48.464]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:48.604 --> 02:28:51.486]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:51.566 --> 02:28:58.291]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:28:58.471 --> 02:29:01.473]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:01.673 --> 02:29:04.055]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:04.195 --> 02:29:12.081]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:12.781 --> 02:29:14.363]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[02:29:14.543 --> 02:29:15.303]  MTBE.
[02:29:15.503 --> 02:29:16.104]  Radon 222.
[02:29:16.424 --> 02:29:18.406]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur.
[02:29:18.546 --> 02:29:19.366]  Even Nitrates.
[02:29:19.667 --> 02:29:23.650]  And unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:23.810 --> 02:29:31.596]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:43.626 --> 02:29:49.228]  You suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:29:49.448 --> 02:29:54.469]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:54.769 --> 02:30:02.692]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:02.832 --> 02:30:09.874]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:10.094 --> 02:30:11.315]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:11.455 --> 02:30:14.856]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:14.916 --> 02:30:16.016]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:16.317 --> 02:30:17.597]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:17.797 --> 02:30:24.620]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:30:30.382 --> 02:30:31.403]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:31.443 --> 02:30:32.904]  This is the Genesis PC Radio Network.
[02:30:54.096 --> 02:31:01.091]  Genesis Communications Radio Network, often imitated, never duplicated, by the Carpetbagger.
[02:31:03.018 --> 02:31:10.700]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, your call is Alex Rarsh West, and Mark, we will get to your calls.
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:17.781]  Paul Watson, there's a lot of other news, a lot of other issues you've written about, a lot of the things we're tracking and following right now.
[02:31:18.281 --> 02:31:25.823]  The dollar plunging yet again, the gold exploding up to $5.30 an ounce, and going back and forth between there and $5.50 an ounce.
[02:31:26.863 --> 02:31:28.204]  So much going on, so much happening.
[02:31:28.224 --> 02:31:29.664]  What are some of the other points you want to go over?
[02:31:31.361 --> 02:31:40.045]  Uh, we could talk about Iran, um, pleader as Iran comes forward says the Holocaust is a myth, says he wants to wipe Israel off the map.
[02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:46.548]  Playing directly into the hands of exactly what Israel and the United States government wants.
[02:31:47.048 --> 02:31:55.232]  You know, is that a setup or is it just... In the case of North Korea, obviously Kim Jong Il threatens to wipe, you know, the United States off the map.
[02:31:56.392 --> 02:32:01.016]  Because a psychopathic killer who literally kidnaps women and people for his own enjoyment.
[02:32:01.276 --> 02:32:04.538]  He kidnaps South Korean, a whole airplane because he wants a particular woman.
[02:32:04.598 --> 02:32:06.420]  I mean, he's literally like the evil villain.
[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:08.141]  He threatens to nuke everybody.
[02:32:08.181 --> 02:32:10.163]  China threatens to nuke us on a monthly basis.
[02:32:10.603 --> 02:32:13.305]  And we lavish them and worship them and support them.
[02:32:13.365 --> 02:32:22.092]  So, I think Iran, in fact, they've said, hey, you know, trying to be nice and not having nukes, you were threatening to invade us, so okay, let's go, let's rock, let's go to war.
[02:32:23.004 --> 02:32:28.609]  I think the more bellicose that he is, the less chance of any retaliation.
[02:32:28.649 --> 02:32:30.311]  That's what North Korea have proven.
[02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:36.537]  Whereas Syria, who are completely simpering, are under threat of invasion.
[02:32:36.577 --> 02:32:46.726]  And then they have incidents like this recent one, where Lebanese politicians get killed just on the verge of a UN investigation into the previous killing, which was blamed on Syria.
[02:32:47.598 --> 02:32:57.506]  So obvious a set-up, why on earth would Syria engage in political assassination on the verge of a major report which accuses them of a previous political assassination?
[02:32:57.526 --> 02:33:01.890]  And then a whole bunch of hotels in Jordan get blown up, killing most of the Palestinian leadership.
[02:33:02.851 --> 02:33:05.633]  Yeah, so I mean... The bombs come from under the floor.
[02:33:06.994 --> 02:33:13.219]  Well, there were supposed to be suicide bombers, but the roofs were caving in and there was no reports of suicide bombers.
[02:33:14.231 --> 02:33:16.995]  Um, again, blamed link to Syria.
[02:33:17.055 --> 02:33:22.022]  So they're all simpering and that, you know, they get the most harsh rhetoric thrown against them.
[02:33:22.062 --> 02:33:26.248]  Whereas Iran comes out all guns blazing like North Korea did.
[02:33:27.296 --> 02:33:30.618]  And it's more in doubt that they will be invaded.
[02:33:30.698 --> 02:33:36.440]  I mean, there's probably going to be a strike against their nuclear facilities by Israel in the next two years.
[02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:39.101]  And that could escalate into World War IV immediately.
[02:33:39.121 --> 02:33:41.742]  Yeah, because Russia and China are right behind Iran.
[02:33:41.762 --> 02:33:45.624]  By the way, everybody wants to know why we're not talking about Richard Pryor and stuff like that, folks.
[02:33:45.664 --> 02:33:46.804]  You've got the wrong show.
[02:33:47.425 --> 02:33:50.306]  I guess we should talk about Jenna Bush, the latest thing here in Austin.
[02:33:51.022 --> 02:34:04.529]  With some known, according to this report here from Redar Magazine and others, that he's running around with a local coke dealer with her ID and it's on video, and she's just careening around enjoying herself.
[02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:07.671]  Do these guys realize and have the video of all this?
[02:34:07.871 --> 02:34:09.312]  How much trouble they're in?
[02:34:09.832 --> 02:34:10.853]  How stupid they are?
[02:34:10.873 --> 02:34:12.553]  I mean, look, I don't mess with people's kids, folks.
[02:34:13.314 --> 02:34:16.576]  And if his daughters want to be little drug addict drunks, that's their business.
[02:34:17.036 --> 02:34:19.217]  I personally have run into them twice.
[02:34:20.183 --> 02:34:26.791]  Well yeah, the more interesting thing about that, aside from Jenna Bush, is the gang leader drug dealer brags that he's quote, down with all the members of Interpol.
[02:34:42.130 --> 02:34:45.333]  Well, see, we don't use cocaine, so we're not Christian.
[02:35:09.921 --> 02:35:12.763]  And we worship Jesus, not Lucifer, so we're not Christian, Paul.
[02:35:12.783 --> 02:35:14.023]  That's right.
[02:35:14.043 --> 02:35:15.424]  What do you think about the G.D.
[02:35:15.504 --> 02:35:24.550]  piece of paper comment, which has of course been confirmed, and then people try to spin it that, oh no, well he said G.D., but everybody says G.D.
[02:35:24.610 --> 02:35:26.051]  The point is he's saying G.D.
[02:35:26.451 --> 02:35:27.752]  about the Constitution.
[02:35:29.473 --> 02:35:30.273]  Well, exactly.
[02:35:30.293 --> 02:35:32.094]  They're trying to shift the debate.
[02:35:32.674 --> 02:35:35.196]  I've got at least four or five videos
[02:35:36.092 --> 02:35:40.457]  Some of which, you know, most people don't even know about, where he's given the middle finger.
[02:35:40.677 --> 02:35:45.102]  It's not as if it's a rare occurrence, it happens once every six months or so.
[02:35:45.923 --> 02:35:55.995]  There was one on Jay Leno, where he showed the middle finger to the press and then all these people came out after and said, oh no, it was the pinky, it was the pinky and it was blatantly the middle finger.
[02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:59.252]  But again, that's not the point, because he does that all the time.
[02:35:59.292 --> 02:36:08.457]  The point is that he trashed the Constitution, and it gave a true insight into what his motivations are, even though he's actually in control of absolutely nothing.
[02:36:08.477 --> 02:36:18.003]  He's got no reason or rhyme to defend the Constitution, so he does exactly what he's told, which is to destroy the Constitution, and that's the major issue to come out of that story.
[02:36:19.398 --> 02:36:19.898]  Well, you're right.
[02:36:19.918 --> 02:36:21.559]  They're openly dismantling it.
[02:36:21.959 --> 02:36:26.220]  Here's an example of problem, reaction, solution, or creating a crisis, then offering a solution.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:31.561]  Most cities have banned homeless people sleeping on the streets or panhandling, so they all come to Austin.
[02:36:31.901 --> 02:36:33.262]  They all come to San Francisco.
[02:36:33.882 --> 02:36:37.323]  Some of them really are obnoxious and out of control, but that's a free society.
[02:36:38.372 --> 02:36:58.762]  Now they're about to pass this public order ordinance which would, quote, stop the homeless people, but instead of just stopping them shooting up or defecating on your doorstep or your business, oh no, now, no protesting of any type without a permit, no going to anybody's door and knocking on the door and saying, come to our meeting against the toll roads,
[02:36:59.571 --> 02:37:07.714]  They're just banning all free speech in the city and then spinning it, though, with the illegal aliens, which by the way, they're not going to stop, folks, and the homeless people.
[02:37:07.754 --> 02:37:07.994]  Paul?
[02:37:09.594 --> 02:37:12.075]  Well, yeah, that's the agenda to ban all protest.
[02:37:12.115 --> 02:37:20.938]  They made steps years ago when they were talking about getting them for violating traffic laws whereby they blocked traffic.
[02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:23.619]  And mark my words, folks, mark my words,
[02:37:24.665 --> 02:37:28.906]  When they pass this, there's going to be just as many illegal aliens or more, just as many homeless people.
[02:37:29.126 --> 02:37:29.967]  It's going to be you.
[02:37:30.007 --> 02:37:30.827]  Sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[02:37:31.687 --> 02:37:38.989]  Yeah, there was the case in New York where, under the Patriot Act, they said that any homeless person could be confused with a terrorist.
[02:37:39.370 --> 02:37:44.991]  That terrorists were planning to pose as homeless people so they could carry out their operations.
[02:37:45.051 --> 02:37:50.073]  That also happened in Connecticut, so now sleeping doesn't just get you jailed, it gets you federal charges.
[02:37:51.457 --> 02:38:01.259]  Yeah, and the people that did that in the past, supposedly, I think he's... I'm writing things... Farris, Ayad Farris, the Brooklyn Bridge bomber, supposedly planning to blow it up.
[02:38:01.699 --> 02:38:03.519]  Then he was an FBI informant.
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:17.522]  So again, all these red flags... 90% of the time... Exactly, 90% of the time they arrest one of these guys, it gets all the headlines, and five months later there's a little footnote, oh, he was an agent, they were staging the arrest to protect his identity.
[02:38:17.742 --> 02:38:19.903]  But it's used for nationwide hysteria.
[02:38:20.163 --> 02:38:20.463]  Go ahead.
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:31.625]  Yeah, and then the real victims of that policy are people like the woman in London who was arrested for reading out the names of dead British soldiers who died in Iraq on Parliament Square.
[02:38:31.805 --> 02:38:33.326]  That's right, they banned protesting there.
[02:38:33.366 --> 02:38:37.368]  I was there two days before it was banned, and they banned it after I bullhorned them.
[02:38:38.408 --> 02:38:46.592]  Yeah, and then this big author who did an interview on Radio 5, I believe, said that she disagreed with gay adoption.
[02:38:47.353 --> 02:38:49.894]  Later in the day, he got a call from the police
[02:38:50.959 --> 02:38:53.842]  He said, you know, well, is it illegal to say that?
[02:38:53.882 --> 02:39:02.671]  And they said, well, no, but we're just checking on how... But at the end of the article they say it's not illegal to say you're against it, but if we say it's hateful, you'll be arrested.
[02:39:03.652 --> 02:39:12.821]  Yeah, and the police are staging big events around major cities, educating people on hate crime currently, so they're trying to
[02:39:13.519 --> 02:39:15.580]  Um, introduce that all over the country.
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.641]  Don't protest the war, that's hateful.
[02:39:17.682 --> 02:39:21.003]  Don't protest two men adopting a little girl, that's hateful.
[02:39:21.384 --> 02:39:26.166]  Don't protest the civil contingency force roundup, which they admit concentration camp bill.
[02:39:26.547 --> 02:39:27.667]  Everything's hateful, Paul!
[02:39:27.687 --> 02:39:30.649]  Yeah, it is, even if you go on the facts.
[02:39:30.729 --> 02:39:33.371]  I mean, like with, um, gay adoption.
[02:39:34.471 --> 02:39:35.112]  What are the facts?
[02:39:35.172 --> 02:39:37.693]  Is it like 60% more likely to abuse?
[02:39:37.733 --> 02:39:38.434]  Something like that.
[02:39:38.494 --> 02:39:42.556]  All the facts came out in the study from, um, one of the universities.
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:49.043]  But even if you'd, you know, you start your university study then that means you're a criminal and you'll get a call from the police.
[02:39:51.384 --> 02:39:52.745]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:39:53.045 --> 02:39:56.346]  It's just, it's just, we have the crooks running the asylum, Paul.
[02:39:56.366 --> 02:39:57.667]  I want to take some calls here, but...
[02:39:59.026 --> 02:40:02.088]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you know, it's an activist tool.
[02:40:02.689 --> 02:40:16.822]  All of my films, all of our weekly TV reports, special TV reports from Crawford, Texas, and weather control reports, and reports from England, and reports from all over, and other documentaries, and your book, and my book, and all our best audio interviews, including this one right now.
[02:40:17.222 --> 02:40:19.384]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:40:19.824 --> 02:40:23.988]  If you normally get three months free with a year membership, and you've knocked the price down by 15 bucks,
[02:40:25.529 --> 02:40:26.790]  How many months is that?
[02:40:27.371 --> 02:40:28.151]  I do that in my head.
[02:40:28.212 --> 02:40:30.974]  Is that six months free until the end of the year?
[02:40:30.994 --> 02:40:33.876]  Yeah, it's just about six months free.
[02:40:35.017 --> 02:40:43.885]  So you could get that subscription, have a library of material that already exists, and then get a year in advanced material.
[02:40:44.045 --> 02:40:47.108]  You might phrase that differently on the site so people understand it.
[02:40:47.668 --> 02:40:54.054]  Before, you get three months free with a regular deal, not insubstantial.
[02:40:54.955 --> 02:40:57.897]  Now, if you get it, you get it for basically half price.
[02:40:58.698 --> 02:41:00.800]  That's right, yeah, as opposed to paying monthly for $39.95.
[02:41:02.651 --> 02:41:08.555]  Which goes on until the 1st of January, you get a year's subscription for that price.
[02:41:08.575 --> 02:41:10.577]  So it's six months free, basically.
[02:41:12.378 --> 02:41:15.160]  So, I think it's even more than that.
[02:41:16.401 --> 02:41:18.222]  It's a hair more than half the year free.
[02:41:19.603 --> 02:41:21.464]  So, because if the full price would be $65.95,
[02:41:26.842 --> 02:41:30.565]  Well, the year is nearly three months three.
[02:41:30.846 --> 02:41:34.489]  So it's just shy of six months.
[02:41:34.509 --> 02:41:36.831]  So there's your answer, folks.
[02:41:36.891 --> 02:41:37.491]  And T-shirts, $9.95.
[02:41:38.072 --> 02:41:39.913]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:41:40.514 --> 02:41:44.197]  It's a great way to give us a gift, but Paul, as an activist tool, and I want to go to some calls.
[02:41:44.777 --> 02:41:50.102]  As an activist tool, people can download and burn copies of all the films and the books to CD, can't they?
[02:41:51.235 --> 02:42:07.438]  Yeah, and the good thing about most of these new portable DVD players is that they can play videos directly from CDs copied from WMV or MPEG files, so you don't have to, you know, code it into the DVD format.
[02:42:07.499 --> 02:42:10.019]  A lot of the new players will play it straight off the bat.
[02:42:10.499 --> 02:42:14.260]  So if you can download them and pass it out, then that's a great activist tool.
[02:42:16.401 --> 02:42:21.683]  I'm not asking, I'm begging people who have memberships currently, download the whole library, give it to somebody today.
[02:42:21.703 --> 02:42:29.045]  We're going to start vodcasting very soon, but that's going to, that's why I've got new people in here, we're doing the training right now, we're going to start videocasting.
[02:42:29.545 --> 02:42:36.387]  For the members, everything will be videocast to your iPod, including audio for your vodcast platform.
[02:42:37.167 --> 02:42:38.067]  That's videocasting.
[02:42:38.247 --> 02:42:45.369]  Also, we're going to then also have multiple free reports each week for the general public for vodcasting as well.
[02:42:47.282 --> 02:42:49.884]  So PrisonPlanet.TV, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:49.904 --> 02:42:50.944]  Paul, I haven't ever asked you this.
[02:42:50.964 --> 02:42:53.126]  What do you think of the new film, The Order of Death, that just came out?
[02:42:54.426 --> 02:43:01.831]  I think it ties up a lot of loose ends with Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, the elite connection to the New World Order.
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:16.237]  And it's obviously not a two and a half hour marathon, which I'm perfectly happy to watch, but people who are new to the information, it's more successful to hit them with a one hour blast of information, which is what that film is.
[02:43:16.337 --> 02:43:19.521]  So it's probably more successful in waking up new people.
[02:43:20.914 --> 02:43:28.560]  And then on the same DVD, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, remastered, updated for 2005, that's on the same DVD.
[02:43:28.921 --> 02:43:33.504]  So that's available right now as well at PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWars.com.
[02:43:33.785 --> 02:43:35.666]  Let's go to Alex and then others.
[02:43:35.766 --> 02:43:36.927]  Alex and Mash, you're on the air.
[02:43:37.067 --> 02:43:37.588]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:39.589 --> 02:43:40.730]  Right as I was going to them.
[02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:41.491]  Okay, who's up next?
[02:43:41.571 --> 02:43:41.931]  Rorsch?
[02:43:43.152 --> 02:43:43.773]  In Connecticut.
[02:43:43.793 --> 02:43:44.673]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:43:44.694 --> 02:43:46.315]  Hello?
[02:43:46.735 --> 02:43:47.115]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:47.176 --> 02:43:47.696]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:48.536 --> 02:44:07.900]  Yeah, Alec, I just wanted to, um, uh, announce, uh, I, uh, picked up a story, uh, yesterday about the Charleston, uh, re-attempt with the, um, old, um, radiological incident, quote-unquote.
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:08.501]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:08.541 --> 02:44:11.561]  Norcom doing a mock nuke attack there in Charleston.
[02:44:11.721 --> 02:44:12.021]  Right.
[02:44:12.041 --> 02:44:14.242]  I, there is a way to stop it again.
[02:44:15.043 --> 02:44:25.546]  And the way I'm proposing is that any bloggers, anybody who's using discussion groups, anyone like that, pick a random day each month where you bring it up.
[02:44:25.706 --> 02:44:28.866]  If there's a news article, you say there's a news article that month.
[02:44:28.946 --> 02:44:31.707]  If there's no news article, you say there's no news article.
[02:44:32.127 --> 02:44:35.368]  Just keep it from dying.
[02:44:35.468 --> 02:44:37.549]  We're kind of having an inside discussion right now.
[02:44:37.569 --> 02:44:42.270]  People are hearing about nukes in Charleston, so let's fill them in about this drill they were going to have.
[02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:43.190]  Paul, why don't you fill them in?
[02:44:44.395 --> 02:44:47.538]  Oh yeah, that was two or three months ago I believe.
[02:44:47.598 --> 02:44:54.245]  They were going to have a naval exercise which involved a nuke being on a ship brought into the harbour and detonated.
[02:44:54.746 --> 02:45:01.813]  There was a lot of attention on it in alternative media circles and then it got picked up by a couple of mainstream newspapers.
[02:45:02.534 --> 02:45:04.476]  Obviously they had the drill and nothing happened.
[02:45:04.986 --> 02:45:14.355]  The fact that they publicly announced the drill beforehand might mean that it is a distraction, and that they're going to have a drill somewhere else in the country, and that's going to be the attack that goes live.
[02:45:14.575 --> 02:45:17.818]  And the reason, for those that don't know, they always run a drill when they attack.
[02:45:17.858 --> 02:45:19.059]  That's why we have to be careful.
[02:45:19.079 --> 02:45:20.660]  They use that as a cover story.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:21.061]  Right.
[02:45:21.601 --> 02:45:25.064]  That's why I want to remind people, because if you look at it,
[02:45:26.218 --> 02:45:32.020]  Nobody was talking about drills when 9-11 happened, even though we knew that they were talking about it.
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:35.061]  As soon as people talk about it, let's cancel it.
[02:45:36.241 --> 02:45:37.041]  Oh no, I agree.
[02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:39.502]  We have stopped other terrorist acts.
[02:45:39.762 --> 02:45:42.983]  I'm just suggesting, every month, remind people about it.
[02:45:43.263 --> 02:45:50.966]  Don't rant and rave, but just keep the topic from dying, and they're going to have to find another
[02:45:53.013 --> 02:46:04.245]  I don't think we can conclusively say we specifically stopped these particular events, but I know that they have been shocked by how we've exposed their involvement in 9-11.
[02:46:04.725 --> 02:46:09.651]  I mean, Paul, I keep talking about this, but we're having all these former top Reagan and current Bush
[02:46:10.391 --> 02:46:13.873]  Well yeah, and we kind of prepared the groundwork immediately after 9-11
[02:46:38.180 --> 02:47:04.101]  The opposition was so vociferous to any questioning of the official version of events that we were the kind of pariahs in the movement, but now the cultural climate has turned to whereby top former government officials, professors and so forth feel comfortable in saying, not going as far in many cases, but going as far as they could possibly go, and I think that the alternative media has prepared that groundwork.
[02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:05.542]  On the last point, there was a
[02:47:06.554 --> 02:47:11.377]  A story about the Chicago Sears Tower being targeted for attack on a certain day.
[02:47:12.118 --> 02:47:18.102]  The alternative media screamed and shouted about that for weeks before the event and then on the actual day when it was supposed to happen.
[02:47:18.709 --> 02:47:19.990]  Yeah, this isn't a joke, folks.
[02:47:20.010 --> 02:47:21.011]  Number one for cops listening.
[02:47:21.031 --> 02:47:21.752]  Who has the motive?
[02:47:21.772 --> 02:47:22.092]  The globalists.
[02:47:22.112 --> 02:47:23.773]  Who have we caught doing this in the past?
[02:47:24.134 --> 02:47:24.614]  The globalists.
[02:47:24.634 --> 02:47:25.895]  Who can we clearly prove did 9-11?
[02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:26.255]  The globalists.
[02:47:26.275 --> 02:47:26.676]  The globalists!
[02:47:40.859 --> 02:47:47.321]  I mean, it's really getting ridiculous, Paul, when we have all these government documents and then they blow up school buses, bomb bases, blame it on enemies.
[02:47:47.421 --> 02:47:49.982]  I mean, they've done it over and over again.
[02:47:50.022 --> 02:47:51.223]  It's declassified!
[02:47:52.863 --> 02:47:58.385]  Exactly, but there's always a new event and a new news cycle to cover, so it kind of gets brushed over.
[02:47:59.285 --> 02:48:09.709]  We try and flashback to things over and over again, but we always have to move on and counter the next piece of propaganda that they throw out, so it's a process of keeping up with the propaganda.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:11.361]  I heartily agree.
[02:48:11.381 --> 02:48:13.202]  We'll come back and talk to Wes and Mark and that's it.
[02:48:13.222 --> 02:48:15.703]  We've got one more little news item I want to hit on with Paul Watson.
[02:48:15.723 --> 02:48:17.444]  I've got to have you up more than every three weeks, Paul.
[02:48:17.464 --> 02:48:19.246]  It was good having you here in studio.
[02:48:20.166 --> 02:48:20.767]  Do you miss us?
[02:48:21.967 --> 02:48:22.228]  Yeah.
[02:48:22.368 --> 02:48:23.909]  Well, it's a lot better than England.
[02:48:25.370 --> 02:48:26.070]  Well, we miss you.
[02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:27.191]  We've got to get you to move over here.
[02:48:28.372 --> 02:48:31.854]  Call you a British bagger, but you're welcome to come be a British bagger over here.
[02:48:32.114 --> 02:48:34.035]  When I was over in England, I was a Texas bagger.
[02:48:34.716 --> 02:48:36.016]  Now we've got our carpet baggers.
[02:48:36.036 --> 02:48:36.657]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:43.081 --> 02:48:45.966]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:48:46.690 --> 02:48:47.971]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:48.191 --> 02:48:53.914]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:54.194 --> 02:48:59.457]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:48:59.737 --> 02:49:03.919]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:04.079 --> 02:49:07.841]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:08.121 --> 02:49:12.744]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:12.824 --> 02:49:19.086]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.126 --> 02:49:21.007]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:39.172 --> 02:49:41.233]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:42.541 --> 02:49:47.745]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:47.905 --> 02:49:55.991]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:56.251 --> 02:50:03.296]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:04.257 --> 02:50:10.742]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:10.922 --> 02:50:16.026]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:16.126 --> 02:50:25.014]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:25.274 --> 02:50:28.576]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:42.375 --> 02:51:43.636]  Oh, hey, Paul.
[02:51:43.656 --> 02:51:44.557]  Watson, do me a favor.
[02:51:44.617 --> 02:51:46.518]  Instant message the network, the page we've got.
[02:51:57.458 --> 02:52:03.004]  It's got the link to the Long Kiss Good Night, where the government bombs the World Trade Center for martial law to get 3,000 dead.
[02:52:03.024 --> 02:52:04.506]  Then exactly that happens.
[02:52:05.006 --> 02:52:14.696]  And the Dean Hagelin X-Files show, Lone Gunman, where the government hijacks the jet during a drill to crash it in the World Trade Center for martial law to invade Afghanistan.
[02:52:14.716 --> 02:52:18.841]  You know, Dean told us the CIA approached him and planted those stories on him.
[02:52:19.421 --> 02:52:21.462]  Dean called me up again, he just pops up!
[02:52:21.942 --> 02:52:31.086]  Dean Haglin, star of the X-Files and Lone Gunman and a bunch of other movies and stuff, just wants to pop by tomorrow, so he's going to be in studio, in here, in studio with me tomorrow, Paul.
[02:52:31.666 --> 02:52:37.429]  We're going to videotape that and put it up there for presentplanet.tv folks, but the network can't find those clips, so will you give those to them?
[02:52:38.049 --> 02:52:38.769]  Yep, sure will.
[02:52:39.029 --> 02:52:41.490]  Thank you very much, Lord Waddy.
[02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:44.091]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wes in Tennessee.
[02:52:44.171 --> 02:52:45.352]  Wes, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:46.865 --> 02:52:47.545]  Good afternoon.
[02:52:47.585 --> 02:52:49.166]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:52:49.186 --> 02:52:50.126]  Thanks for calling, brother.
[02:52:50.166 --> 02:52:50.887]  What's on your mind?
[02:52:51.347 --> 02:53:13.695]  Well, yesterday on CBS News, the story that I heard about the potential bombing of the nuclear power plants in Iran, like I said, this was on CBS News, indicated that the Israelis plan to do this before March.
[02:53:14.536 --> 02:53:15.616]  Did you hear anything about that?
[02:53:16.793 --> 02:53:21.296]  Oh, they said six months ago they were going to do it by August, and they didn't do it.
[02:53:21.336 --> 02:53:25.038]  So they just keep going, we're going to nuke you, we're going to nuke you, or we're going to attack you, we're going to hit your nukes.
[02:53:25.859 --> 02:53:28.080]  Paul, I mean, you talked about that earlier.
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:29.121]  What's your intel on that?
[02:53:30.762 --> 02:53:44.650]  The Israelis came out yesterday and said that Iran would be at the point of no return by March, which means they would be at the point of enriching the uranium and producing the nukes if they didn't already have them.
[02:53:45.656 --> 02:53:48.937]  Now, we were told that that was happening in late summer.
[02:53:49.117 --> 02:53:51.758]  And the CIA admits that it'll take them ten years to get it.
[02:53:52.538 --> 02:53:55.339]  Yeah, all the inside reports say it takes them ten years.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:54:00.181]  So, the Israelis are just trying to shorten the timetable.
[02:54:00.201 --> 02:54:03.562]  But the globalists wouldn't lie to us about intelligence and weapons.
[02:54:04.502 --> 02:54:07.023]  Regardless, even if it's true, they're allowed to have weapons.
[02:54:07.563 --> 02:54:10.404]  Exactly, I mean... The minute they use them, they'll come off the face of the earth.
[02:54:10.424 --> 02:54:11.324]  They're not going to use them.
[02:54:12.603 --> 02:54:16.969]  They're never going to use them in a million years, whereas... Don't worry, the globalists will, don't blame it on them.
[02:54:18.210 --> 02:54:18.931]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:20.473 --> 02:54:21.915]  Because they've got the motive.
[02:54:23.557 --> 02:54:24.599]  I tell you, we're in trouble here.
[02:54:24.659 --> 02:54:25.300]  Anything else, Wes?
[02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:39.184]  No, you guys pretty well covered it, and I thank you so much for your hard effort, and God bless you and the family, and I wish both you and Paul and your families a healthy, happy, and prosperous 2006.
[02:54:39.465 --> 02:54:39.785]  You bet.
[02:54:39.825 --> 02:54:41.266]  Don't say Christmas or you'll be arrested.
[02:54:41.626 --> 02:54:43.127]  Let's go ahead and make a final call.
[02:54:43.187 --> 02:54:44.088]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[02:54:44.128 --> 02:54:44.768]  Hello, Mark.
[02:54:44.808 --> 02:54:45.209]  Welcome.
[02:54:45.689 --> 02:54:46.610]  Hi, Alex and Paul.
[02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:47.250]  Merry Christmas.
[02:54:47.631 --> 02:54:48.151]  Hello, my friend.
[02:54:48.171 --> 02:54:48.711]  What's on your mind?
[02:54:48.731 --> 02:54:52.854]  Two things to say, Alex, and they involve high school.
[02:54:54.115 --> 02:54:54.776]  My son is a
[02:54:56.382 --> 02:54:58.304]  It goes to high school in Massachusetts, okay?
[02:54:59.045 --> 02:55:16.301]  And they sent the paper out to him the other day basically saying it was a waiver that unless you had a parent sign it, then they wouldn't release information to the military or any other agencies that want to know about, you know, who he is and, you know, statistics like that.
[02:55:16.341 --> 02:55:20.645]  And track all his records, everything he does to be able to harass him at the school.
[02:55:21.801 --> 02:55:33.689]  That's right, and I had taken him to State Police State 3, a total enslavement, so he called me right up and he mentioned that you had talked about that, and that he had sent it home to have his mother sign it because... That was number one on the school.
[02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:38.173]  By the way, Paul, that Marshall Law article, I had the part where their governor tried to declare Marshall Law last year.
[02:55:38.213 --> 02:55:38.893]  That was the headline.
[02:55:39.153 --> 02:55:40.995]  What else there, Mark?
[02:55:41.395 --> 02:55:46.018]  I live in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, Alex, and there's a high school there.
[02:55:46.519 --> 02:55:50.201]  It's a local high school that on Thanksgiving Day, there was a brawl, okay?
[02:55:51.849 --> 02:56:05.071]  On the ABC affiliate out of Providence, they kept running for two hours underneath the newscast continually saying, federal officials will buy Woodstock High School with Cambers and they're so happy they're getting them.
[02:56:05.271 --> 02:56:07.532]  And they ran this, Alex, for like two hours straight.
[02:56:07.652 --> 02:56:10.492]  Well, the feds are going to take over because there was a fist fight.
[02:56:10.812 --> 02:56:14.153]  Well, everybody knows if there's a lost puppy dog, you call in the feds.
[02:56:14.493 --> 02:56:15.333]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[02:56:15.353 --> 02:56:16.113]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:56:16.313 --> 02:56:17.453]  Paul, thanks for coming on, brother.
[02:56:17.693 --> 02:56:18.213]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:18.454 --> 02:56:18.754]  You bet.
[02:56:18.954 --> 02:56:19.774]  God bless you all.
