[00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:05.718]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:07.418]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:09.259]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:10.780]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.020]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:21.343]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.504]  Well, I'll tell ya, this week is blasting past us.
[00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:41.547]  It's already Thursday, the 17th day of February 2005.
[00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:49.818]  And I want to take a lot of your calls in this first hour, because we've got two guests coming up later in the second and third hour.
[00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:56.859]  We'll also have open phones then, but we'll go to your calls coming up in the next segment, kind of like C-SPAN's Washington Journal.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.301]  Any news item, any news story, any question, any comment, you've got.
[00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.882]  We're going to take your calls and we're going to move quick through your calls.
[00:01:04.902 --> 00:01:07.122]  Give each caller about a minute and a half.
[00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.803]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:16.219]  This broadcast is all about liberty and freedom.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.743]  It's about exposing the New World Order.
[00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:21.187]  It's about defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:29.479]  And the Democrat and Republican parties are like termites destroying the guts of this nation and we've got to expose it.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.903]  But one termite's got a elephant on its back.
[00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:35.085]  The other termite's got a donkey on its back.
[00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.829]  And because the termites have little symbols on them, you go, I like these termites!
[00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.691]  These are friendly termites.
[00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.432]  They have an elephant on them.
[00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:44.874]  Little elephant spot on them.
[00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:46.755]  And ooh, I like these termites.
[00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:48.037]  They have a donkey on them.
[00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:50.879]  They all are termites, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:51.840]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:59.852]  AIDS cite worry on Al-Qaeda infiltration from Mexico.
[00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:02.554]  They're doing it again.
[00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:13.102]  They build up this anger, this concern about the open borders that is totally legitimate, take border patrol agents off the northern and southern border, that's the actual numbers,
[00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:24.711]  And then just bring raft after raft after platter after salvo of legislation with the word immigration tagged onto it.
[00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.792]  Has nothing to do with illegal immigration.
[00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.434]  Everything to do with controlling the American people.
[00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:32.875]  And they're doing it again.
[00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:34.436]  I mean, now it's on a weekly basis.
[00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:35.759]  U.S.
[00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.781]  aides cite worry on Al-Siada infiltration from Mexico.
[00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:51.745]  This out of the New York Times, new intelligence information strongly suggests that Al-Siada, again they say Al-Qaeda, I say their true name, Al-Siada, of the foundation of CIA controlled Islamic terror.
[00:02:52.486 --> 00:03:01.469]  New information strongly suggests that Al-Siada, we must unlearn what we've learned, we must change the words that they've created back into their true meanings.
[00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.016]  That's how we defeat them.
[00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:03.857]  That's one big part of it.
[00:03:04.257 --> 00:03:17.121]  New intelligence information strongly suggests that Al-CiAda has considered infiltrating the United States through the Mexican border, top government officials told Congress on Wednesday.
[00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:33.126]  And so, we'd all better carry our good little national ID cards, or the LCIA-das will get us, but the illegal aliens don't have to have them, but they don't mention that in the article, so the average person hears this and goes, man, Bush is really doing something about it.
[00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:36.188]  So, more details of that are coming up.
[00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:41.953]  Also, Bush to tap Necroponte as Intel Director.
[00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:47.278]  And I have dubbed him Lord of the Death Squads.
[00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:59.348]  He is a singularly wicked creature, and he fits in nicely with the gaggle of vampires surrounding Lord Bush the Twitly.
[00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.411]  And so we will be going over that for you.
[00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:08.736]  Also, Australian government keeping secret database of people who criticize its policies.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.201]  Schwarzenegger plan has Republicans wary.
[00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.682]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:18.304]  They just come right out and go, oh yeah, the Republican plan to put him in the White House.
[00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.525]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:23.726]  They're a little wary of some of the things he wants to do.
[00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:24.506]  But that's okay.
[00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:26.907]  He's going to be our new Lord and Master.
[00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:34.510]  I mean, if they can make the American people take a foreigner, an Ouslander, then we'll put up with anything, won't we?
[00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:40.856]  And jailed immigrants may go to Mexico prison.
[00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:44.038]  Our government may build prisons in Mexico.
[00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:46.440]  Globalism, yes!
[00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.642]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:50.903]  And your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.465]  Infowars.com and prisonblinded.tv are two of the websites.
[00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:07.339]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:09.001]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:11.423]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:13.645]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:18.849]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:23.233]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:25.235]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:35.967]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.010]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:25.790]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.130]  There are no side effects.

[00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:07.412]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:09.254]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:10.736]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:12.397]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:16.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:21.307]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:35.880]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, as we defend liberty and resist tyranny, Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:41.843]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:41.883 --> 00:08:50.166]  We're going to have wide-open phones throughout the broadcast today, and we've got two big guests coming on, one in the third hour, who's exposing
[00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:59.750]  Mr. Negroponte, to be the new National Security Advisor, National Intel Director.
[00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:18.293]  He's the current ambassador to Iraq, and he was the chief organizer and commander, I would call him a lord, or a commissar, or you could choose the term if you liked, Commodore of the death squads in Latin America.
[00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:21.930]  And you can go, well they were fat and cummies.
[00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:47.522]  Uh, yeah, while our government was giving all the weapons systems to Russia and China and making deals with China to de-industrialize this country and giving them all the different awards through the United Nations, death squads were marching all over Latin America pulling out whole families and machine gunning them and throwing them in pits and raping and killing people's wives and children in front of them.
[00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:49.698]  It's all admitted.
[00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:52.841]  And just absolute terror.
[00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:54.883]  Men in black uniforms, black ski masks.
[00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:59.187]  You can look at photos from the 70s and 80s of death squads.
[00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.248]  And it's a modern SWAT team outfit.
[00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:05.552]  Of course, you can also look at photos from the 60s and 70s in Russia.
[00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:07.554]  And they wore the same outfit.
[00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:12.379]  Black ski masks and black uniforms are real big in the Balkans, too.
[00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:26.158]  And, uh, if you look at the Bush Administration, they're all lovers of torture, lovers of death, lovers of evil, lovers of abortion, lovers of open borders, uh, lovers of gun control, lovers of just, it's pure evil!
[00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:28.680]  Just absolute pure evil.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.104]  Uh, but meanwhile, Gonzales seeks to reinstate obscenity case.
[00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:36.564]  Why?
[00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:38.506]  They had a press conference about it.
[00:10:39.586 --> 00:10:40.867]  They're gonna stop people
[00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:45.261]  We were making porno movies in California!
[00:10:45.281 --> 00:10:47.182]  Now, look.
[00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:57.671]  The point is, is that here's Gonzales, who pushes in Texas for 12-year-olds not having to tell their parents when they go have abortions.
[00:10:57.731 --> 00:11:04.717]  But your 12-year-old, again, has to get a permission slip to go to the zoo for a field trip, or the planetarium, or the movie theater.
[00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:07.659]  Or to the city library.
[00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:09.964]  But they can go have an abortion.
[00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.445]  So let's kill babies!
[00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:18.771]  But he has to act like he's conservative, so he'll now do this and be hailed as, Man, he's a real conservative boy!
[00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:22.134]  Uh, thank goodness he's there to do absolutely nothing.
[00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:24.956]  Uh, you know, to pornography.
[00:11:26.117 --> 00:11:33.703]  Uh, that, uh, is developing into more and more just out of control, uh, decadence.
[00:11:34.524 --> 00:11:37.286]  Another sign of the society in serious decline.
[00:11:38.143 --> 00:11:40.585]  But the point is, is that it's not meant to stop anything.
[00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:42.007]  It's not going to stop anything.
[00:11:42.047 --> 00:11:42.928]  It's a photo-op.
[00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:47.352]  Well, I will prosecute somebody that made porno movies.
[00:11:48.653 --> 00:11:51.176]  And now we're really conservative.
[00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:53.198]  And it's just, it's theater.
[00:11:53.578 --> 00:12:01.085]  It's like one of the insiders of 9-11, Porter Goss, who was there with the head of Al-Qaeda on the morning of 9-11.
[00:12:02.415 --> 00:12:03.856]  Having a delicious meal.
[00:12:04.376 --> 00:12:05.617]  Eggs Benedict, it was reported.
[00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:09.980]  With the man who wired $100,000 to the lead hijacker, Mohammad Atta.
[00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.222]  General Mahmood Ahmad of Pakistani Intel.
[00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:17.485]  And involved in the cover-up of 9-11 and a long-time CIA officer.
[00:12:17.525 --> 00:12:18.746]  They just told us about it a year ago.
[00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.767]  Oh, he's been a lifetime CIA agent.
[00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:21.788]  He's the new director.
[00:12:21.988 --> 00:12:24.029]  We like to have CIA officers in Congress.
[00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:30.173]  And, well, now we've just got to give all our rights up or Al Qaeda's going to attack us from the southern border.
[00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:36.303]  Again, they put the label that, oh, southern border, open border is dangerous.
[00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:37.464]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:12:37.684 --> 00:12:38.825]  They're not going to control that.
[00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:41.987]  Then they propose more legislation to take our freedoms.
[00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:49.091]  It's like the last two national ID card bills, one that completely passed Congress in December, the one that passed the House last week.
[00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:50.452]  We talked about that again yesterday.
[00:12:51.973 --> 00:12:56.055]  Well, now, they just keep beefing it up, expanding it.
[00:12:56.857 --> 00:12:59.179]  But putting loopholes for the illegal aliens in it.
[00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:00.780]  So very, very serious.
[00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:05.584]  That's all gonna be coming up as well with more details of that.
[00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:07.805]  Some good news and then I'm going to your calls.
[00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:25.519]  Remember a couple days ago we had the father on who first said no at Sutter California Elementary School, Brittany Elementary School, where they wear these huge RFID tracker chips around their necks that track everything they do in the school.
[00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:29.537]  And he said no, and a bunch of other parents started questioning it.
[00:13:29.997 --> 00:13:31.157]  A few others said no.
[00:13:31.997 --> 00:13:37.639]  And the company that was doing it, pushing it, has now pulled out because lawsuits were being prepared.
[00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:44.940]  And the father we had on the broadcast wasn't aware this was going on all over the country.
[00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:54.103]  But if you just type in RFID tracking children in schools, you'll get just literally dozens of reports around the country of it happening.
[00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:55.403]  And so you should
[00:13:56.028 --> 00:14:00.753]  Look for that, and it may already be going on in your school district, and fight it.
[00:14:01.293 --> 00:14:03.736]  But this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:14:04.517 --> 00:14:11.103]  Company pulls out of deal to track students, the grade school that required students to wear radio frequency identification badges.
[00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:16.989]  The contractor every move has ended the program because the company that developed the technology pulled out.
[00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.671]  I'm disappointed.
[00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:28.799]  That's about all I can say at this point, said Ernie Graham, the superintendent and principal of Brittany Elementary School in Sutter, California, said Tuesday night.
[00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:31.120]  I think I let my staff down.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.802]  Nobody on this campus knows every student.
[00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:41.038]  The badges developed by Sutter-based technology group, IncomCorp, were introduced January 18th.
[00:14:41.138 --> 00:14:49.544]  The school board was set to talk about the controversial policy Tuesday night, but tabled the discussion after ICOM announced it was terminating the agreement.
[00:14:50.104 --> 00:14:51.285]  I'm not convinced it's over.
[00:14:51.685 --> 00:15:06.052]  Parent Don Cantrell, who filed a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Marysville Appeal Democrat, I'm happy for now that kids are not being tagged, but I'm still fighting to keep it out of our school system.
[00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:07.553]  It has to stop here.
[00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:19.930]  The system was imposed without parental input, but the school as a way of simplifying attendance taking and potentially reduced vandalism and improved safety of the students.
[00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.731]  You know, sure it was.
[00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:24.876]  Technology scares some people.
[00:15:24.996 --> 00:15:26.518]  It's a fear of the unknown.
[00:15:26.658 --> 00:15:27.900]  Parent Mary Browner.
[00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.780]  Uh, told the newspaper before the meeting.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:36.003]  Any kind of new technology has the potential for misuse, but I feel confident the school is not going to misuse it.
[00:15:36.463 --> 00:15:39.465]  Yeah, I love this attitude of, I don't test my neighbor.
[00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:47.329]  Yeah, why don't you just go over to your neighbor and say, here, I'm hooking up a phone line splice to my house.
[00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:49.430]  Anytime you want to listen to me, you just listen.
[00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.331]  And here, I'm going to put cameras in my house.
[00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.052]  Anytime you want to watch me, just watch me.
[00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:56.674]  Or anytime you want, you know, I'm going to give the whole neighborhood keys to my house.
[00:15:58.777 --> 00:15:59.398]  You wouldn't do that.
[00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:00.539]  You don't trust your neighbors.
[00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.380]  And you shouldn't entirely trust them.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.383]  But you should trust them more than you trust this government.
[00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:12.168]  Where people who abuse power, who are ruthless, who lie, who are cunning, rise to the top.
[00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:14.150]  That's just history and facts and common sense.
[00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.851]  What the Founding Fathers warned you about.
[00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:18.273]  But now they say, oh no, I just trust them.
[00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:20.555]  I just think they're so nice.
[00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:24.999]  When their own documents say they're going to tax and trace and control us with this RFID.
[00:16:26.116 --> 00:16:30.358]  When they admit they're going to enslave you with it, you sit there like a drooling idiot!
[00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:33.359]  And you're just morons!
[00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:34.719]  People like you!
[00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:36.400]  So you think you're part of the system?
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.140]  Well, I'm not afraid of it!
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.481]  I'm not a troglodyte!
[00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:46.343]  I'm not an anti-technology zealot on some type of botlerian jihad!
[00:16:46.823 --> 00:16:48.424]  I'm gonna go along with it!
[00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:52.090]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.231]  I'm a little bit out of control today.
[00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:54.852]  Jerry in Colorado.
[00:16:54.872 --> 00:16:55.372]  You're on the air.
[00:16:55.433 --> 00:16:56.093]  Thanks for holding.
[00:16:56.674 --> 00:16:57.134]  Hi, Alex.
[00:16:57.574 --> 00:16:57.995]  How you doing?
[00:16:58.535 --> 00:16:58.755]  Good.
[00:16:59.055 --> 00:17:09.764]  On Tuesday, one of your callers was a 14-year-old young man, and you were giving him some advice on how to avoid being absorbed into the beast.
[00:17:10.585 --> 00:17:16.310]  Well, I just said don't take drugs and get educated and get involved in sports.
[00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.992]  Well, that's what I disagree with, the sports part.
[00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:24.340]  My opinion is that sports is actually a major sickness in this country.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.887]  It's actually decadence the way it's an obsession with so many Americans.
[00:17:30.107 --> 00:17:33.992]  But see, decadence is taking something that's good and going too far with it.
[00:17:34.713 --> 00:17:35.554]  It's like gluttony.
[00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:45.192]  I mean, I think the watching of it, you know, 20 hours a week, the worship of it, the tribal nature of the big events, being a spectator, I think at this level is sick.
[00:17:45.592 --> 00:17:54.496]  But I think it's really good for young people to get them into a lot of different swimming and track and football and baseball and softball and wrestling.
[00:17:54.756 --> 00:17:55.656]  I mean, I think it's wonderful.
[00:17:56.232 --> 00:18:00.974]  Well, the reason I disagree is based on my high school sports experience.
[00:18:01.034 --> 00:18:04.235]  It conditions people to accept... It's very hierarchical.
[00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:05.115]  I can't even talk.
[00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:06.196]  Hierarchical.
[00:18:06.396 --> 00:18:07.996]  Sometimes I can't say a word.
[00:18:08.497 --> 00:18:11.538]  It's all about a hierarchy type system.
[00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.719]  And worship the football players.
[00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:17.340]  I know that, but what I'm... Go ahead and make your point.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:17.660]  I'm sorry.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.082]  Well, it programs people to be blind, unquestioning, obedient lackeys.
[00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.403]  And it conditions people to accept groupthink.
[00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:27.558]  I think so.
[00:18:41.597 --> 00:18:53.447]  Did you ever see Hearts and Minds out in 1970, that film, making the connection between the simulated warfare of football and the unconstitutional, immoral war in Vietnam?
[00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:58.010]  No, but I mean the government is now trying to compare the war to football.
[00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:10.340]  They do that in ads and in propaganda and they even sell like W bumper stickers that show like W on the football helmet like it's rah rah our team and it's just like Rome with the gladiatorial diversions
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.401]  Well, I'd agree there.
[00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:14.223]  Thank you, sir.
[00:19:14.263 --> 00:19:15.163]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.964]  I have always been able to say,
[00:19:41.661 --> 00:19:44.924]  And I literally was trying to mouth it while he was talking and I can't say it.
[00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:46.907]  Did you ever get like a tongue twister on a word?
[00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:50.230]  And I literally cannot say for the life of me right now.
[00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:52.833]  But I'm going to practice it during the break.
[00:19:52.853 --> 00:19:54.254]  We'll see if I can say it when we get back.
[00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:55.996]  Stay with us folks.
[00:19:56.276 --> 00:19:57.477]  Warrior calls straight ahead.
[00:20:01.004 --> 00:20:02.485]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:20:02.765 --> 00:20:07.367]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.029]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:11.790]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.253]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:20:17.573 --> 00:20:18.793]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:21.555]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:27.898]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:28.678]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:29.158]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:29.218 --> 00:20:32.079]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:20:41.523 --> 00:20:46.988]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:49.070]  Get the map.
[00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.472]  Start your journey to financial independence today.

[00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:03.655]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:03.715 --> 00:21:07.897]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:08.137 --> 00:21:10.939]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:13.520]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:22.365]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:23.906]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:21:24.106 --> 00:21:28.268]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:29.348]  We're good to go!
[00:21:57.381 --> 00:21:59.082]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:22:40.905 --> 00:22:42.286]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:42.326 --> 00:22:46.667]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:16.731]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:26.375]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:23:27.476 --> 00:23:35.420]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:13.675]  Hi Alex, welcome again from Skull and Bones Country.
[00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:36.262]  The Christian conservative country, yes.
[00:24:36.302 --> 00:24:36.762]  That's right.
[00:24:36.882 --> 00:24:41.724]  I think it was Mark Twain that said, no man's life, liberty, and property are safe when the legislature is in session.
[00:24:42.364 --> 00:24:42.984]  Well, that's right.
[00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:43.964]  He did say that, didn't he?
[00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:44.525]  Yeah.
[00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:46.465]  Sounds kind of Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:47.846]  She was probably controlled by Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:48.206 --> 00:24:51.827]  Well, we may end up getting interned down at Gitmo for saying this, you know?
[00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:59.450]  You know, I think Mr. Gonzalez needs to stop worrying about California porno films and pay attention a little closer to home.
[00:25:00.683 --> 00:25:08.726]  What apparently started as like an inconvenient and embarrassing misadventure is morphing into a potential powder keg for this administration.
[00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:19.149]  This Jeff Gannon, supposedly a reporter, along with several other Hannity Limbaugh clones, was apparently hired to ask softball questions at George Bush's press conference.
[00:25:20.255 --> 00:25:22.796]  Well, he actually, the media is spinning it.
[00:25:22.836 --> 00:25:31.979]  It's admitted he's paid through an organization controlled by the Bush administration and they gave him a fake name so he wouldn't be recognized and targeted.
[00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:35.940]  What the media focuses on, is he going to get in trouble for giving a fake name?
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.321]  No!
[00:25:36.361 --> 00:25:37.681]  It was part of the scam!
[00:25:38.081 --> 00:25:43.623]  Well, there are several laminations here and it seems like the bloggers, and I don't know how true this is, but apparently
[00:25:44.472 --> 00:25:56.194]  It's the old Franklin cover-up rearing its ugly head again, because from what I'm understanding, there's a possibility of underage gay prostitutes in the White House again.
[00:25:57.964 --> 00:26:01.686]  Well, we've got the Washington Times headline on that.
[00:26:01.946 --> 00:26:10.350]  Back in 89, they ran a headline and apparently... In fact, I don't have that in front of me, but it just says gay prostitutes.
[00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:12.592]  What's that headline?
[00:26:12.632 --> 00:26:14.492]  I mean, I've got the news article, I just don't remember it.
[00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:20.555]  I think it was VIP prostitute ring ensnares Reagan Bush.
[00:26:20.616 --> 00:26:21.476]  Something like that.
[00:26:21.636 --> 00:26:22.697]  Yeah, that's the headline, yeah.
[00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:45.894]  It goes much deeper, and I think it also ties into gay porno and prostitutes, underage gay prostitutes in the White House.
[00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:54.397]  I haven't read that about this case, but I've certainly seen that over the years in a bunch of other mainstream publications, thanks for the call.
[00:26:54.477 --> 00:27:01.780]  I mean, I've got the New York Post headline, Top Gay Porn Star Services VIPs at Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:02.962 --> 00:27:10.789]  And I mean, I've got spy magazine articles, AP articles, from the 80s, where they just bus in the male prostitutes.
[00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.893]  And yes, the White House, during conservative administrations,
[00:27:16.978 --> 00:27:23.360]  It has come up with the underage, we're talking 16-year-old and younger, male prostitutes.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.500]  I mean, it blows the mind that this kind of stuff is going on.
[00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:30.341]  But hey, they say they're Christian and conservative.
[00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:31.061]  I mean, why?
[00:27:31.241 --> 00:27:33.302]  Gonzales is going after porn right now.
[00:27:35.042 --> 00:27:39.023]  Yeah, but he's not going after Dyncor, caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children.
[00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:40.643]  They were convicted in civil court.
[00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:44.644]  It all came out in Yugoslavia.
[00:27:45.638 --> 00:27:47.359]  No, no, they just get more contracts.
[00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:48.980]  It's all window dressing.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.081]  And it's so evil, just the average person can't even begin to face it.
[00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:54.922]  Who's up next here?
[00:27:57.223 --> 00:28:00.245]  Myron in South Dakota, then Carlos and Mike and others.
[00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:01.245]  Go ahead, Myron.
[00:28:01.585 --> 00:28:03.646]  Yes, Alex, there's a new book out.
[00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:06.267]  I don't know if you've reviewed it or seen it.
[00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:12.130]  It's called The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History by Thomas E. Woods, Jr.
[00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.471]  He's a Ph.D.
[00:28:15.286 --> 00:28:17.007]  No, but if it's Regnery, it's probably Neocon.
[00:28:33.292 --> 00:28:37.975]  A real hard-hitting diatribe against the book in the editorial page.
[00:28:38.015 --> 00:28:39.556]  Well, I haven't seen it, but they do that.
[00:28:39.796 --> 00:28:50.282]  They'll have a limited political spectrum, and then they'll have false debates within the spectrum, and then that fools us to think that there's an alternative there, then we contain ourselves within the limited choices.
[00:28:50.482 --> 00:28:56.446]  But I haven't read the book, so I'm not... I'm not... I have no right to comment on it.
[00:28:56.486 --> 00:28:57.366]  I mean, tell me about the book.
[00:28:57.666 --> 00:29:02.169]  I read a review of it in the New American Magazine for this month, or this week.
[00:29:03.102 --> 00:29:04.803]  Well, that's what, uh, Lincoln said that, too.
[00:29:30.257 --> 00:29:34.161]  I know, and then he goes on, issue after issue, so I wouldn't condemn the book.
[00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:35.061]  I'd read it first.
[00:29:35.782 --> 00:29:36.803]  I didn't condemn the book.
[00:29:37.143 --> 00:29:43.349]  I just said normally, Regnery sends me, it's probably in my mailbox, they send me everything they publish.
[00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:45.130]  Okay, it's politically incorrect.
[00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.611]  Okay, I know, we heard about it.
[00:29:46.671 --> 00:29:47.472]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:51.816]  We're on the march.

[00:30:00.794 --> 00:30:02.494]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:02.674 --> 00:30:04.695]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[00:33:09.941 --> 00:33:16.887]  Coming up in the second hour, here in about 26 minutes, we'll be talking to Cindy Sheehan.
[00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:21.831]  She was going to be on with us Monday, but she had a veterinary emergency with a cat, I think she said.
[00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:37.624]  But she'll be joining us in the next hour, mother of Army Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan, killed in action in the middle of last year, and she's the co-founder of Gold Star Families for Peace.
[00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:42.386]  We'll cover the related news article, Not Worth My Son's Sacrifice.

[00:34:08.423 --> 00:34:11.025]  But first, syndicated talk show host Jack Blobs called in.
[00:34:11.745 --> 00:34:12.866]  Jack, how are you doing today?
[00:34:13.266 --> 00:34:14.187]  Hey, I'm great, Alex.
[00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:15.528]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:34:15.808 --> 00:34:16.889]  A couple of quick comments.
[00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.531]  First of all, I had Thomas Woods on my program, and he did a fantastic job.
[00:34:21.032 --> 00:34:25.695]  Probably the second Regnery author I've ever had that was worth anything.
[00:34:27.776 --> 00:34:29.457]  I mean, earlier I said I haven't read the book.
[00:34:29.517 --> 00:34:30.478]  I can't really comment on it.
[00:34:30.518 --> 00:34:34.561]  I just, most stuff that comes out of Regnery is, let's put people in concentration camps.
[00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:35.002]  You're right.
[00:34:35.042 --> 00:34:41.306]  I mean, they are, see, I believe you need to trace them back to the CIA, Eagle Publishing, and Al Regnery, and Oliver North, and all of that.
[00:34:41.386 --> 00:34:45.209]  So, you're right to cast a weary eye on that, but he's really great.
[00:34:45.269 --> 00:34:46.971]  So, if you get a chance, maybe bring him on.
[00:34:47.011 --> 00:34:51.554]  I think he does a fantastic job on really painting an accurate picture of history.
[00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:52.495]  Have you had a chance to talk to him?
[00:34:52.515 --> 00:34:56.438]  Well, by the way, I've even interviewed, I mean, I've interviewed the publisher of Regnery on this broadcast.
[00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:58.571]  Yeah, well, he's something else.
[00:34:58.711 --> 00:35:02.732]  You're right again to be a little bit weary of them, but there are exceptions.
[00:35:02.792 --> 00:35:12.335]  In fact, the guy that used to carry the nuclear football for Clinton, Buzz, I can't remember his last name, but he was another guy that was also really good and really painted the picture.
[00:35:12.355 --> 00:35:15.076]  No, I've interviewed him about all the stuff he saw Clinton do, yeah.
[00:35:17.256 --> 00:35:18.097]  Yeah, so he was good.
[00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:21.761]  Hey, listen, have you had a chance to talk about Iran and what happened in Iran yesterday?
[00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:24.424]  Because there was a massive spike in a cover-up of that story.
[00:35:24.464 --> 00:35:25.605]  It's just getting ridiculous.
[00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:33.293]  Well, there was a dam, and it got blown up, but then the Iranians came out and said, don't panic, it was a scheduled demolition.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:40.382]  Well, now the story has changed, actually, to the effect of a plane, a jet plane, lost its engine.
[00:35:40.762 --> 00:35:42.342]  And that's what started the explosion.
[00:35:42.382 --> 00:35:49.784]  Now, initially, this was reported on Iranian state-run TV, that a missile had come from an airplane, reported all around the world.
[00:35:49.804 --> 00:35:51.404]  And I literally watched this story.
[00:35:51.444 --> 00:35:52.365]  No, I saw the report.
[00:35:52.385 --> 00:35:54.145]  It burned and spiked all throughout the day.
[00:35:54.165 --> 00:35:55.646]  It was something to behold, really.
[00:35:55.926 --> 00:35:56.986]  No, I saw the spin.
[00:35:57.874 --> 00:36:02.157]  And we know that globalist forces are in Iran openly trying to overthrow it.
[00:36:02.177 --> 00:36:03.017]  What, about a year ago?
[00:36:03.037 --> 00:36:06.079]  They had all the fires and riots there.
[00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:09.981]  And we know that special forces, U.S.
[00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:11.042]  troops are in the country.
[00:36:11.062 --> 00:36:16.025]  It looks like Japan to me back in World War II where they're trying to provoke them into making a move.
[00:36:16.985 --> 00:36:20.808]  Obviously, I don't think Iran wants to do anything until they have that bomb ready to go.
[00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:29.234]  Well, it's like when the ship, it's like when the ship, it's like when the ship back in the 80s shot down the jumbo jet full of Iranians.
[00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:31.401]  Well, I think it's on, Alex.
[00:36:31.461 --> 00:36:33.902]  In fact, last night, you had to see this on Nightline.
[00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:36.742]  If anybody has a copy of this, I'm sure you're going to want this, Alex.
[00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:41.983]  They ran the entire Nightline show, a war game, with smallpox hitting the world.
[00:36:42.063 --> 00:36:45.004]  Madeleine Albright acted as the American president.
[00:36:45.044 --> 00:36:54.886]  She was making the argument for the Americans that the vaccine and withholding vaccines from Muslims might be a good way to cull some of the Muslims politically, and they had to look at it as a political advantage.
[00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:56.467]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:36:56.487 --> 00:36:59.150]  About four years ago, before 9-11, they had a five-night series.
[00:37:16.371 --> 00:37:22.238]  That started on a Friday and then ran to the next Thursday on Nightline, where at the first they would say, this is a simulation.
[00:37:22.758 --> 00:37:31.589]  Then they would show footage of, uh, you know, riots after hurricanes or whatever, but wouldn't tell you it was, because if a hurricane was real footage, they would tell you smallpox has been released.
[00:37:32.289 --> 00:37:33.890]  Uh, 25 million are dead.
[00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.651]  Martial law has been declared.
[00:37:36.032 --> 00:37:40.715]  You're telling me they did it again and Albright was talking about withholding vaccines from Muslims?
[00:37:40.735 --> 00:37:44.537]  Yeah, they did a whole new show of Nightline just to run this war game.
[00:37:44.837 --> 00:37:50.261]  And every once in a while they put a little disclaimer on your TV set, this is just a simulation, it's not real.
[00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:56.825]  But you're telling me, you're telling me, I mean she's famous for saying 700,000 dead Iraqi children is a good price to pay for security in the Gulf.
[00:37:56.845 --> 00:37:57.005]  Right.
[00:37:57.305 --> 00:38:08.824]  You're telling me that she said last night, you know, in the drill, by the way she's foreign born folks, she's Czechoslovakian, her dad was a commissar, conservatively killed, this is mainstream folks, a million people.
[00:38:09.574 --> 00:38:18.077]  And then ran to Serbia, they protected her, and then of course decades later she bombed them with pleasure, and they had her on TV and pictures of her going, we helped you, why are you doing this to us?
[00:38:18.438 --> 00:38:22.199]  And of course stole their artwork, their gold, their treasure.
[00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:24.520]  That's been in the news, stolen artwork in her house.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.700]  I mean, she's a monster.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:37.465]  So they had a foreigner simulating as our president, and then she says, now be specific, she said in the piece that we may want to withhold vaccines from the Muslims.
[00:38:37.785 --> 00:38:47.656]  This was a long argument as more death polls were coming in across the country interwoven with a fake newscast going out through the country reporting more deaths by the CDC.
[00:38:48.116 --> 00:38:53.062]  Her argument, which she kept coming back to again and again, Alex, was this should be used as a political tool.
[00:38:53.843 --> 00:38:55.684]  This is a trauma-based mind control.
[00:38:56.324 --> 00:38:57.685]  Obviously, and conditioning.
[00:38:57.765 --> 00:39:03.468]  And I'll tell you, you take a look at, you know, you can look at my website, jackblood.com, for just the last month, and look at all of the news.
[00:39:03.528 --> 00:39:04.328]  It's staggering.
[00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:13.053]  But just yesterday, if you take that one little window apart, just the news from yesterday alone, and what the media was doing in the way of con... It is fantastic.
[00:39:14.734 --> 00:39:16.255]  Something was happening yesterday, Alex.
[00:39:16.295 --> 00:39:17.615]  I think they kicked it up another notch.
[00:39:17.976 --> 00:39:21.997]  Well, I mean, they are kicking it up another notch.
[00:39:22.037 --> 00:39:30.861]  The Microsoft founder, of course, Bill Gates, working with Norway, giving a billion dollars with the plan to immunize the entire world's children by 2015.
[00:39:31.722 --> 00:39:34.363]  I mean, all of this really goes together, as you know.
[00:39:34.783 --> 00:39:35.463]  I hear you, Jack.
[00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:36.184]  Good to hear from you.
[00:39:36.264 --> 00:39:36.764]  Thank you.
[00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:37.384]  Doing a good job.
[00:39:37.424 --> 00:39:38.285]  You better take care.
[00:39:38.365 --> 00:39:40.946]  Yeah, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[00:39:42.225 --> 00:39:45.271]  They love the children of the world so much.
[00:39:46.013 --> 00:39:49.280]  They fund special vaccine duty.
[00:39:50.493 --> 00:40:03.257]  And of course, Prince Philip does that as well, and Ted Turner does, and they all give to these big vaccine funds that go around, admittedly, and forcibly inoculate whole villages and towns.
[00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:08.299]  They say, if you want any IMF or World Bank money, you've got to accept these UN troops coming in and vaccinating you.
[00:40:08.819 --> 00:40:14.941]  And the parents, this has been in the BBC, will flee the villages, running with their children from the vaccines, because they know
[00:40:17.062 --> 00:40:20.325]  They say, after we take the vaccines our children get sick, many of them die.
[00:40:21.246 --> 00:40:38.799]  But you've got to wonder, why is Prince Philip or Ted Turner, both of them who openly talk about getting rid of 80-95% of us in public speeches and books they've written, who talk about overpopulation and all this Malthusian garbage, why are they so obsessed with giving you vaccines so you don't die?
[00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:40.821]  We have to save the children!
[00:40:41.881 --> 00:40:46.203]  Oh, we need to get rid of 80-95% of people, but here, take a shot!
[00:40:46.943 --> 00:40:48.764]  I also want you all to live.
[00:40:48.824 --> 00:40:50.084]  We don't want you to get sick.
[00:40:51.045 --> 00:40:52.165]  And then we have the documents.
[00:40:52.185 --> 00:40:55.546]  AIDS, HIV was engineered by the Defense Department.
[00:40:56.707 --> 00:41:00.508]  And we have a government trying to set the precedent to forcibly inoculate the American people.
[00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:03.710]  Now, I didn't see Nightline last night, but if you saw her, you're welcome to call in.
[00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.591]  Carlos in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:07.031]  Go ahead.
[00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:08.531]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:08.571 --> 00:41:09.652]  You're out of control, buddy.
[00:41:11.232 --> 00:41:13.634]  I think the whole world's out of control, but go ahead.
[00:41:14.475 --> 00:41:20.119]  Well, Alex, we're talking about the death squad in Negroponte.
[00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:31.147]  You know, some of these death squads were trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, here in the military base, Army base, Fort Benning, Georgia.
[00:41:32.188 --> 00:41:38.853]  And there were some luminaries, they trained a lot of Latin America guerrilla leaders,
[00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:43.844]  Including Manuel Noriega, who was trained there, the president of Panama.
[00:41:43.864 --> 00:41:49.567]  Also, Roberto Guavizon, who became president of El Salvador.
[00:41:50.268 --> 00:41:56.351]  And of course, all these people went on to lead the death squad in El Salvador, Honduras.
[00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:58.412]  They created all the terror.
[00:41:59.204 --> 00:42:06.668]  That forced a lot of people to flee out of there, and then come into the United States as the illegal aliens, you know what I'm saying?
[00:42:07.128 --> 00:42:08.529]  Oh no, you're absolutely right.
[00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:12.611]  Because the thing is the cycle that's created.
[00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:27.960]  Well, Necroponte, I mean I dub him Lord of the Death Squads, he was there managing and running all of it, and tens of thousands of troops were trained in how to hook electrodes to people, how to torture them, just sheer terror, going into villages, killing whole families,
[00:42:28.707 --> 00:42:30.489]  And it had nothing to do with fighting communism.
[00:42:30.509 --> 00:42:33.672]  It was about controlling the drug production zones.
[00:42:34.653 --> 00:42:35.253]  Well, exactly.
[00:42:35.333 --> 00:42:41.659]  Right now, from what I understand, it was the School of the Americas that is training these people to cooperate in Georgia.
[00:42:41.679 --> 00:42:44.562]  Of course, it changed its name now to something else.
[00:42:44.622 --> 00:42:46.564]  Yeah, they changed the name two years ago, yeah.
[00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:50.648]  Right, but right now they're training a lot of Colombians.
[00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:55.185]  And you can see the problems brewing in Colombia!
[00:42:55.205 --> 00:43:08.377]  By the way, they're hiring the old death squad colonels and commanders and paying them $400,000, $300,000 a year and they're sending them to Iraq because they can't get our own people en masse to torture.
[00:43:08.617 --> 00:43:14.682]  So they're actually sending, the last numbers I saw were hundreds of these guys to be torture masters.
[00:43:14.722 --> 00:43:19.206]  They're actually hiring these Latin Americans who did it before to send them over there.
[00:43:20.442 --> 00:43:39.294]  Exactly, so you know our CIA is training all these guerrilla leaders out there and they spread them across the world to spread terror across their countries and of course then people start flying out of there because of the terror and the corporations start moving into all these areas that they leave desolate and they start taking over.
[00:43:40.094 --> 00:43:47.439]  Another thing here real quick, I was looking at the history of the neoconservatives Alex, there's a guy named Leo Strauss
[00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:51.164]  Well, apparently he is the guru of the Neoconservative.
[00:43:51.184 --> 00:43:54.527]  Yeah, professor at the Chicago University, yeah.
[00:43:54.747 --> 00:43:56.809]  Right, but guess who brought him there?
[00:43:56.889 --> 00:43:58.591]  John D. Rockefeller, okay?
[00:43:59.997 --> 00:44:05.560]  So the whole neoconservative philosophy, you can probably trace it to the big banking families.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:18.686]  Well, look, we've interviewed people who were in the same classes with Strauss, who were in class with all of these neocons, you know, top neocons today, and I mean, this is admitted, this is like mainstream folks.
[00:44:19.106 --> 00:44:22.987]  The entire Republican hierarchy were the Communist Fourth International.
[00:44:23.708 --> 00:44:28.270]  And they couldn't win as communists, and they actually met and said, we're going to become neoconservatives,
[00:44:29.193 --> 00:44:31.634]  And we believe in fascism.
[00:44:32.094 --> 00:44:33.554]  We believe that's the better model.
[00:44:34.195 --> 00:44:40.256]  And we're going to seize control by becoming conservatives and getting control of the conservative movement in America.
[00:44:40.996 --> 00:44:42.957]  And that's who they are.
[00:44:43.297 --> 00:44:47.718]  And Strauss was an admirer of Hitler.
[00:44:47.778 --> 00:44:52.860]  Even though he was Jewish, he said, I don't admire Hitler going after Jews, but I admire his model.
[00:44:53.661 --> 00:44:59.667]  And so it's a fusion of radical communism and Hitlerism.
[00:45:00.528 --> 00:45:01.349]  And look at it today.
[00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:04.272]  Homeland Security, the black uniforms, the secret arrest.
[00:45:04.732 --> 00:45:06.114]  They're recreating it.
[00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:07.495]  They love it.
[00:45:08.216 --> 00:45:10.678]  Well of course, and the Rockefellers had a lot to do with it.
[00:45:10.718 --> 00:45:13.321]  They were the owners of... Just like they funded Hitler.
[00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:15.323]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:45:15.908 --> 00:45:25.896]  Yeah, Standard Oil, which merged with IG Farben over in Germany, which was creating the petrochemicals that were being used to gas all the Jews in all these concentration camps.
[00:45:26.797 --> 00:45:30.980]  Well, IG Farben certainly was involved in all of it, and so was Brown Brother Harriman.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.641]  Good to hear from you.
[00:45:33.222 --> 00:45:34.823]  Yep, that's true.
[00:45:34.883 --> 00:45:39.367]  I mean, our government... Our bombers couldn't bomb the Ford
[00:45:40.553 --> 00:45:42.555]  And GM plants building the tanks and trucks.
[00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:43.416]  It's admitted.
[00:45:43.976 --> 00:45:46.339]  And IBM had their technicians there at all the camps.
[00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:49.541]  And they would decide to keep somebody alive or not.
[00:45:49.582 --> 00:45:50.823]  They had a tabulating machine.
[00:45:50.843 --> 00:45:52.084]  That's what the tattoos were for.
[00:45:52.604 --> 00:45:56.748]  They would take calipers and measure your fat and your height and your age and enter the computer.
[00:45:56.768 --> 00:46:02.093]  And the computer would say whether to kill you or not, how long to work you, what to do with you.
[00:46:02.614 --> 00:46:05.756]  And that's IBM's behind the ID cards and the RFID.
[00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:08.450]  All these systems today, of course.
[00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:14.792]  Not very nice folks, but Mike in Arizona, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:46:15.192 --> 00:46:15.732]  Morning, Alex.
[00:46:15.932 --> 00:46:16.232]  Hello.
[00:46:16.872 --> 00:46:29.077]  I wanted to ask you, considering FDR's dictum of nothing happens in politics without a reason, what happened in this election in Iraq?
[00:46:29.877 --> 00:46:35.499]  It looks like, or what's being advertised is that you've got a Shiite regime now,
[00:46:36.275 --> 00:46:37.775]  Or certainly Shiite-friendly.
[00:46:38.856 --> 00:46:40.436]  Why would they have allowed that to happen?
[00:46:40.476 --> 00:46:41.576]  Or do you even accept that?
[00:46:41.736 --> 00:46:53.139]  Well, you know that the Constitution they have allows if, what is it, if 10% of the votes of the council members are against it, that's a veto power.
[00:46:54.419 --> 00:47:01.441]  And I saw the numbers a couple weeks ago, and I'm trying to pull them up here, and I think the Sunnis will have about 20% votes.
[00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:04.422]  And so basically it's a stalemate
[00:47:05.111 --> 00:47:07.674]  And of course, the Shiites say, keep the military here.
[00:47:08.435 --> 00:47:11.619]  And then in a few cases, as I predicted, they put a few wild cards in.
[00:47:11.639 --> 00:47:13.461]  Ooh, look, somebody who's against this one.
[00:47:13.762 --> 00:47:15.644]  You know, and they're over some little town or city.
[00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:18.207]  And really, it's all just staged.
[00:47:18.247 --> 00:47:23.634]  They've created a balkanized system, like the Romans would do, that they control.
[00:47:24.754 --> 00:47:27.296]  You just view it as completely ineffectual.
[00:47:27.876 --> 00:47:29.758]  I don't even believe the election results.
[00:47:29.798 --> 00:47:33.400]  Secret polling places wouldn't let people know who the candidates were.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.081]  I mean, I don't believe any of it.
[00:47:35.341 --> 00:47:38.103]  We have election fraud here, and there's a lot of others.
[00:47:38.123 --> 00:47:39.604]  There was, of course, total fraud over there.
[00:47:40.225 --> 00:47:47.590]  But regardless, what they've set up is a system where there really is no government.
[00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.972]  I mean, everything is just parity and gridlock.
[00:47:51.616 --> 00:47:53.178]  I honestly don't know.
[00:47:53.238 --> 00:47:59.584]  I haven't heard any reliable accounts from any Iraqis that I have any faith in what really happened over there.
[00:48:13.545 --> 00:48:17.769]  What they did is, this was admitted, they busted out record amounts of aid.
[00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:20.872]  They had just piled up on huge pallets and warehouses.
[00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:26.358]  And when you came to vote, they were given a little slip and you could go and get extra rations.
[00:48:26.438 --> 00:48:33.966]  So just showing up to vote, you got food and no oversight how the votes were taken.
[00:48:34.933 --> 00:48:36.874]  And I mean it's just it's a fraud.
[00:48:37.054 --> 00:48:43.058]  It's a little like the Democrats handing out cigarettes in Chicago or wherever that was last presidential election.
[00:48:43.678 --> 00:48:43.958]  Sure.
[00:48:43.978 --> 00:48:46.040]  To excuse the population that votes.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.100]  Sure.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.843]  And a lot of people there, a lot of polling places were closed or were supposed to be open.
[00:48:51.323 --> 00:48:51.483]  What?
[00:48:51.583 --> 00:48:55.385]  A third of the country or more than a third didn't have voting on election day.
[00:48:55.405 --> 00:48:55.685]  Remember?
[00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:56.846]  Yeah.
[00:48:56.886 --> 00:48:58.227]  So large sectors of
[00:48:58.948 --> 00:49:06.513]  Because they couldn't have the Sunnis getting 30-40% so they had to shut down a lot of the Sunni areas for no voting.
[00:49:07.913 --> 00:49:20.281]  What I worry about is them leaving a very pro-Iranian government there and then creating the pretext to go back in and utterly destroy the whole region.
[00:49:21.044 --> 00:49:29.549]  Well, I think a lot of the experts we've talked to are saying that they're just going to start a war with Iran and then that it's going to blow up from there.
[00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:31.110]  Yeah.
[00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.590]  I mean, they want World War III.
[00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.391]  I mean, they're really setting this up.
[00:49:34.832 --> 00:49:35.692]  Yeah, I remember H.G.
[00:49:35.732 --> 00:49:40.815]  Wells predicted that we would have World War III in Viet Basra.
[00:49:41.075 --> 00:49:43.376]  I think he made that prediction back in about 1933.
[00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:51.034]  Oh, they're a little bit behind their own timetable, but it is unfolding before our eyes.
[00:49:52.535 --> 00:49:54.495]  You know, it's amazing the things that H.G.
[00:49:54.535 --> 00:49:55.355]  Wells predicted.
[00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:56.535]  You know, he was an insider.
[00:49:56.695 --> 00:49:59.076]  He didn't just write War of the Worlds, folks.
[00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.956]  He wrote non-fiction books.
[00:50:01.356 --> 00:50:13.119]  He was kind of a futurist there in the Royal Institute of International Affairs court, the heart of what we call the CFR today in America, with a British counterpart.
[00:50:13.706 --> 00:50:14.547]  Yeah, he wrote a number of books.
[00:50:14.567 --> 00:50:15.867]  I guess we view them as prophetic, but like you say,
[00:50:30.692 --> 00:50:35.233]  He was a strongly committed Fabian Socialist, and he knew what their plans were.
[00:50:35.613 --> 00:50:41.095]  Well, and he said, there's going to be a lot of valiant, you know, nice, moral people we're going to have to kill to get our New World Order.
[00:50:41.395 --> 00:50:53.638]  Yeah, and that was echoed again by... who's the historian in the Wall Street Journal back in the early 90s.
[00:50:53.738 --> 00:50:55.238]  Yeah, well, I mean, they all say it.
[00:50:55.258 --> 00:50:56.599]  They all talk about how they're going to kill us.
[00:50:57.219 --> 00:50:58.079]  Because they're nice people.
[00:51:00.575 --> 00:51:04.380]  Hey, what really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.322]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:54:29.346 --> 00:54:31.207]  Folks, I've made powerful videos.
[00:54:31.247 --> 00:54:32.928]  I mean, this isn't hype.
[00:54:33.008 --> 00:54:34.749]  It's no bragging if it's true.
[00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:37.986]  No brag, just fact, as John Wayne would say.
[00:54:38.446 --> 00:54:39.726]  These videos are shocking.
[00:54:39.746 --> 00:54:41.207]  They're professionally produced.
[00:54:41.347 --> 00:54:42.247]  They're documented.
[00:54:42.587 --> 00:54:44.048]  They wake people up.

[00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:53.171]  They're great tools.

[00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:33.010]  Just a quick question.
[00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:33.690]  I don't know if
[00:56:53.962 --> 00:56:57.125]  If you ever researched a German-owned company called Siemens?
[00:56:57.725 --> 00:56:59.907]  Oh, very, very serious.
[00:57:00.107 --> 00:57:05.651]  How involved they are in our national security systems, especially in most of our major airports?
[00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:06.852]  Well, I knew that.
[00:57:06.932 --> 00:57:11.276]  I was told by a government official, and I confirmed it, back in 1998.
[00:57:11.416 --> 00:57:18.581]  I had driven around the country to document the UN putting up its signs and saying it owned our parks.
[00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:23.145]  And when I showed up at a park, I was threatened with arrest.
[00:57:23.763 --> 00:57:26.125]  Yeah, they're involved in our military communications also.
[00:57:47.885 --> 00:57:52.428]  What is it, like 70% of our military infrastructure now has been outsourced to Europe?
[00:57:52.688 --> 00:57:57.471]  It's kind of scary to realize that a German company could come in and do that.
[00:57:57.491 --> 00:58:00.573]  They wanted to buy the nuclear division from Westinghouse.
[00:58:01.514 --> 00:58:03.295]  But fortunately the government wouldn't allow that.
[00:58:05.836 --> 00:58:06.557]  I remember that.
[00:58:06.617 --> 00:58:08.518]  Sounds like you work inside this stuff.
[00:58:10.059 --> 00:58:10.539]  No longer.
[00:58:12.324 --> 00:58:12.744]  I used to.
[00:58:12.924 --> 00:58:13.524]  No longer do.
[00:58:14.025 --> 00:58:17.106]  But did you know that Siemens is also sneaking around watching people?
[00:58:18.586 --> 00:58:21.488]  Well, that's what I'm kind of concerned about.
[00:58:22.608 --> 00:58:23.889]  I used to work for them.
[00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:27.730]  They're involved in a lot of stuff.
[00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.411]  See, the government uses private corporations to do their bidding.
[00:58:31.832 --> 00:58:33.032]  Anything else, sir, you want to add?
[00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:33.592]  No, that's it.
[00:58:33.632 --> 00:58:34.593]  That's it, Al.
[00:58:34.613 --> 00:58:35.673]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[00:58:36.633 --> 00:58:37.114]  Yeah, I know.
[00:58:37.134 --> 00:58:38.874]  I mean, that was kind of a wake-up call for me.
[00:58:41.033 --> 00:58:42.415]  You know, Siemens is watching.
[00:58:43.236 --> 00:58:44.978]  They don't like what you're doing with the UN.
[00:58:45.659 --> 00:58:47.121]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:48.563]  Big Brother.
[00:58:48.603 --> 00:58:49.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.038 --> 00:59:01.119]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.779 --> 00:59:02.660]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.281]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.922 --> 00:59:08.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.125 --> 00:59:13.187]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.415 --> 00:59:22.176]  The globalists are afraid of us.
[00:59:22.576 --> 00:59:24.176]  They're afraid of us taking action.
[00:59:24.216 --> 00:59:25.677]  They know we have power.
[00:59:26.357 --> 00:59:33.459]  They know that individuals who are highly motivated and focused and have good information can change the course of history.
[00:59:34.679 --> 00:59:38.460]  That's why they try to counter us with their propaganda, or they try to harass us.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:43.722]  It isn't working, and their own minions are waking up in droves every day
[00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:47.551]  Their humanity is returning.
[00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:56.594]  More and more of their own people are going public inside the IMF and World Bank, inside these big corporations, and blowing the whistle on this corrupt New World Order.
[00:59:57.835 --> 01:00:07.719]  And as the New World Order comes into view, as people see the details of it, as they realize how horrible it is, you're going to see more resistance.
[01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:13.341]  That's why, consequently, at the same time, the converse of it, is the globalists are racing
[01:00:14.306 --> 01:00:30.636]  to expand the structure of control, the electronic straitjacket, the societal black ski masking of the police, the armored vehicles, the face scanning cameras, because they know the stuff they got planned for humanity is so horrible you're gonna buck.
[01:00:31.136 --> 01:00:32.977]  You're gonna struggle in the squeeze chute.
[01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:37.620]  My friends, we've got to say no to being led to the slaughter.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.082]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:43.043]  We've got some great guests coming up.
[01:00:43.675 --> 01:00:45.996]  Here on the next segment, and of course your calls will continue.
[01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:49.137]  Right now, let's talk to Harvey in Florida.
[01:00:49.197 --> 01:00:50.058]  Harvey, go ahead.
[01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:51.238]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:52.179]  Hello, Harvey.
[01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:53.459]  Great to talk to you again.
[01:00:53.479 --> 01:00:58.982]  Your callers are so informed and talking about so many important subjects today.
[01:00:59.962 --> 01:01:02.383]  I'd like to talk about one or two things.
[01:01:02.443 --> 01:01:09.186]  First of all, our training of all the military around the world, how to kill and slaughter their own people, which is Negroponte's job in Iraq.
[01:01:10.845 --> 01:01:12.665]  No, this is a bloodthirsty henchman.
[01:01:12.685 --> 01:01:14.666]  They send him to Iraq to run the death squads.
[01:01:14.706 --> 01:01:16.506]  They send him to Latin America to do it.
[01:01:16.546 --> 01:01:18.466]  He'll be our new National Security Chief.
[01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.607]  They train people all around the planet.
[01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:25.048]  Your caller, I think his name was Carlos, talking about the School of the Americas.
[01:01:25.088 --> 01:01:29.888]  Not only do we do it there, we do it in Camp Harvey in West Virginia.
[01:01:29.968 --> 01:01:35.369]  We go to other countries and train them how to slaughter their own people, how to keep their populations down.
[01:01:36.009 --> 01:01:37.550]  This is a crime against humanity.
[01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:38.850]  And when I hear
[01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:49.247]  You also spoke today about propaganda, the never-ending tentacles of the monster of propaganda that's around our throats, brought to us by our co-opted media.
[01:01:49.267 --> 01:02:02.721]  And every time George Bush goes to one of his fake staged audiences, they have somebody in the audience that stands up, it's usually a woman, that says, I just want to thank you, President Bush, for bringing dignity and honor back to the White House.
[01:02:03.658 --> 01:02:04.900]  Which is the complete opposite.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.142]  I mean, it just gets worse and worse.
[01:02:06.402 --> 01:02:09.066]  You know, each successive president is getting deeper into this.
[01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:13.872]  And, you know, I've got the audio clips where Bush says, this is a staged press conference.
[01:02:14.173 --> 01:02:17.017]  Why are you at, you didn't give me this in writing beforehand.
[01:02:17.257 --> 01:02:19.140]  I mean, he's slipped up and thrown fits.
[01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:20.564]  Which I understand.
[01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:21.085]  It's stressful.
[01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:22.285]  I've done that on TV before.
[01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:25.087]  You know, got a little bit angry about, you know, a bunch of screw-ups.
[01:02:25.627 --> 01:02:30.070]  But, I mean, literally, you know, he's sitting there admitting that it's scripted.
[01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.191]  Going, hey, you were supposed to give me this question beforehand written.
[01:02:33.591 --> 01:02:34.532]  Oh, I've heard that, yep.
[01:02:34.712 --> 01:02:36.333]  Well, that's... I mean, no, I've played the clip.
[01:02:36.373 --> 01:02:37.313]  I got the video clip.
[01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:40.255]  But the point is, is that this really is scripted.
[01:02:40.275 --> 01:02:42.256]  They now admit the reporters are paid off.
[01:02:42.696 --> 01:02:43.597]  It's all staged.
[01:02:44.304 --> 01:02:48.748]  I just want to thank you, President Bush, for bringing honor and dignity back to the White House.
[01:02:48.788 --> 01:02:54.534]  And this is a mass murderer that she's talking to, so they'll always find people to sell their souls.
[01:03:10.939 --> 01:03:12.220]  For a few pieces of gold.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.600]  Well, it's about being cool.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.602]  It's about wearing the fancy outfit and swishing into the little audience.
[01:03:16.622 --> 01:03:17.202]  They get invited.
[01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:19.103]  They get invited to their fake affairs.
[01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:23.165]  Go to the parties and, oh baby, oh I'm part of the system, oh.
[01:03:23.686 --> 01:03:30.789]  But we really have to keep educating the people not to sell their souls for a few pieces of gold or for a minute in the limelight.
[01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:32.030]  They have to stop doing this.
[01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.671]  They're just selling out our country.
[01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:35.924]  Well, it's going to come back to roost.
[01:03:35.984 --> 01:03:38.968]  I mean, don't think the globalists are just going to abuse the world and not abuse you.
[01:03:38.988 --> 01:03:42.793]  They think they're going to get a secret ID card so they're not going to be taken to the oven.
[01:03:43.434 --> 01:03:45.957]  Well, you think... I mean, you're talking about Republicans being bad.
[01:03:45.977 --> 01:03:46.718]  I mean, it's all of them.
[01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:47.639]  Oh, it's all of them.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.080]  Absolutely.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:48.981]  Absolutely.
[01:03:49.001 --> 01:03:49.442]  We'll be back.
[01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:50.283]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:50.343 --> 01:03:50.764]  Good call.
[01:03:52.401 --> 01:03:56.748]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:56.908 --> 01:04:01.335]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:01.495 --> 01:04:05.902]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:07.264]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:13.267]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.327 --> 01:04:20.269]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.430]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:33.134]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:33.394 --> 01:04:36.135]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:36.696]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.697 --> 01:05:01.762]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:13.228]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:13.568 --> 01:05:19.291]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:19.531 --> 01:05:26.172]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:26.392 --> 01:05:33.214]  Black Berkey elements flow 1.5 to 2 times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:35.254]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:37.575]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:37.795 --> 01:05:39.495]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[01:05:39.695 --> 01:05:40.335]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.355 --> 01:05:40.536]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.903]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things.
[01:05:54.203 --> 01:05:56.285]  Over the years I've tried many, many products.
[01:05:56.426 --> 01:05:58.768]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:02.712]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[01:06:03.405 --> 01:06:04.086]  It truly works.
[01:06:04.446 --> 01:06:05.688]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:06:06.088 --> 01:06:12.035]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:06:12.115 --> 01:06:18.182]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:06:18.602 --> 01:06:22.606]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:06:22.986 --> 01:06:24.047]  It's healthy for you too.

[01:06:32.334 --> 01:06:34.556]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:35.697]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:06:35.717 --> 01:06:35.777]  1-800-622-8446
[01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:44.383]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[01:06:44.703 --> 01:06:45.423]  So call now 1-800-622-FIN.
[01:06:45.443 --> 01:06:45.763]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:06:45.783 --> 01:06:46.704]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:46.724 --> 01:06:48.265]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:13.280]  Every day they beat the drums to go to war with Iran.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:19.645]  They're telling us if there's terror attacks in America, it's probably going to be Iran or Syria.
[01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:28.772]  Yesterday, Iran and Syria signed a defense pact together to fight the globalists.
[01:07:29.292 --> 01:07:30.793]  I wouldn't want to say the United States.
[01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.996]  And again, I'm not defending Iran or Syria.
[01:07:34.036 --> 01:07:36.378]  I mean, those countries are run by monsters too.
[01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:45.553]  But they're no threat compared to Pakistan or North Korea or China or Russia that our government coddles and loves and arms.
[01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:49.756]  And we got Rumsfeld giving nuclear reactors to North Korea when he was on the board of ABB.
[01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:57.501]  Then they tell us we've got to march our sons and daughters now off and they've set up this big move for a national draft, introduced legislation.
[01:07:58.502 --> 01:08:06.948]  We've got to send them off to fight and die when the PENAC documents written by Dick Cheney said in 2000 it's about oil, Saddam in the threat.
[01:08:08.194 --> 01:08:10.716]  It's about oil and using Iraq as a military base.
[01:08:11.156 --> 01:08:14.078]  But we can use Saddam as a pretext to get that oil.
[01:08:14.338 --> 01:08:15.438]  I mean, he wrote this!
[01:08:15.498 --> 01:08:16.259]  He said this!
[01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:20.341]  It isn't like it's O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary, quitting and saying he heard this in meetings.
[01:08:20.401 --> 01:08:23.964]  It's not like it's Richard Clark, you know, leaving and saying he heard all this.
[01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:28.166]  This is Dick Cheney and something he wrote and published!
[01:08:29.347 --> 01:08:31.108]  But the neocons never want to talk about that.
[01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:33.512]  And folks, they want World War III.
[01:08:33.532 --> 01:08:35.233]  They don't care if it kills a bunch of our troops.
[01:08:35.253 --> 01:08:37.534]  They'll make a bunch of money off the weapon sales.
[01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:39.615]  They'll get to expand the global empire.
[01:08:40.275 --> 01:08:43.036]  It's about going after countries that aren't under their control.
[01:08:43.777 --> 01:08:45.117]  Whether they're good, bad, or ugly.
[01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:49.299]  And I want to talk about the cost of this if it happens.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.441]  I want to talk about what this is going to mean.
[01:08:54.062 --> 01:08:58.444]  And, I mean, our troops can't even deal with Iraq right now.
[01:08:58.524 --> 01:08:59.664]  It's getting worse every day.
[01:09:00.045 --> 01:09:00.605]  Imagine
[01:09:01.522 --> 01:09:02.863]  Going into Iran or Syria.
[01:09:03.243 --> 01:09:04.905]  And a draft will be needed.
[01:09:05.705 --> 01:09:10.729]  But we're joined by a lady, and I really appreciate her incredible courage, Cindy Sheehan.
[01:09:11.369 --> 01:09:20.036]  And she was the mother of a military officer, Casey Austin Sheehan, killed in action in Iraq.
[01:09:20.056 --> 01:09:22.938]  And she's the co-founder of Gold Star Families for Peace.
[01:09:24.679 --> 01:09:26.541]  And we really do appreciate her joining us.
[01:09:26.641 --> 01:09:30.844]  And we've got a great article she's written called, Not Worth My Son's Sacrifice.
[01:09:31.953 --> 01:09:33.555]  On InfoWars.com.
[01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:36.478]  Cindy, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:37.419]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.821]  Thank you.
[01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:43.265]  First off, let's personalize this because the government doesn't like us to do that.
[01:09:43.405 --> 01:09:44.947]  They don't want us to photograph the coffins.
[01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:51.294]  In Louisiana, we had the military refuse to follow orders because the families wanted the caskets to be seen.
[01:09:52.879 --> 01:10:02.407]  Tell us about your son, his life, just in a nutshell, what happened when he was sent out of country, and then now your fight to try to save other lives.
[01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:15.018]  Okay, well, Casey was 24 when he was killed and he was just, you know, just one of the most amazing people.
[01:10:15.798 --> 01:10:18.981]  He was very low-key and
[01:10:19.645 --> 01:10:23.128]  He was very calm and gentle and sweet.
[01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:28.792]  And he joined the Army in May of 2000.
[01:10:28.993 --> 01:10:34.377]  He wanted to give something back to the country.
[01:10:34.437 --> 01:10:35.938]  He was always about service.
[01:10:36.018 --> 01:10:37.499]  He was an Eagle Scout.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.962]  He was an altar boy for 10 years.
[01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:47.968]  When he was 18, he stopped being an altar boy and went to serve the church in other capacities.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:54.605]  And he did that even throughout his army service.
[01:10:54.665 --> 01:10:59.309]  He went to mass and helped the chapel where he was stationed.
[01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:09.877]  On April 4th, 2004, he had only been in Iraq for two weeks and there was a battle going on.
[01:11:09.957 --> 01:11:17.744]  If you'll remember, April 1st was when the contractors in Fallujah were mutilated and hung from the bridge.
[01:11:18.385 --> 01:11:35.710]  And that's right after Paul Bremer took away their newspaper, the Shiite's newspaper and TV and said some highly inflammatory things and inflamed the Shiite's rebellion against our armed forces.
[01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:45.093]  And on April 4th in Sadr City, which is a Shiite ghetto in Baghdad,
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:12:13.136]  Some of the Shiites overtook some police stations and a group was sent out to take the police stations back from the Shiite rebels and they were ambushed and they were in a fierce battle and my son and some people on his post were listening to the battle over the radio and they were told to put together a quick response team to go out and to save the
[01:12:14.013 --> 01:12:17.536]  You know, to help the soldiers that were trapped in the battle that they were in.
[01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:23.220]  Well, my son volunteered to go on that mission, and he was a Humvee mechanic.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.205]  He was also trained to be a combat lifesaver, which is like a step below a medic.
[01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:32.987]  So they get to the soldiers and try to stabilize them.
[01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:35.329]  So he was a specialist?
[01:12:35.889 --> 01:12:36.790]  Specialist, yeah.
[01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:39.952]  So they try to stabilize the soldiers.
[01:12:40.032 --> 01:12:41.193]  Anyway, on the way to
[01:12:42.256 --> 01:12:50.443]  To that combat, they were trapped and ambushed and seven soldiers were killed in that ambush and Casey was one of them.
[01:12:51.884 --> 01:12:54.366]  And we never agreed with the war.
[01:12:54.467 --> 01:12:55.487]  Casey didn't either.
[01:12:55.507 --> 01:12:58.570]  He didn't agree with his commander-in-chief.
[01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:03.174]  We didn't understand why Iraq was an imminent threat to the United States.
[01:13:04.324 --> 01:13:06.765]  And are really any threat to the United States.
[01:13:06.865 --> 01:13:11.085]  Well, Dick Cheney said it wasn't, but that he was going to lie to the American people and tell them it was.
[01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:11.946]  Right, right.
[01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:18.347]  And so, we, you know, at that point, we thought that it was a senseless war.
[01:13:18.567 --> 01:13:24.208]  And I, you know, when Casey was home last Christmas, I begged him not to go.
[01:13:24.288 --> 01:13:31.950]  You know, I would joke around with him and tell him to hold still so I can run him over and stuff like that and break his legs or
[01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:36.539]  You know, knock him out and take him to Canada, but he just said, Mom, come on.
[01:13:37.119 --> 01:13:37.919]  This is my job.
[01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:38.880]  I have to go.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.420]  I have to support my buddies.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.121]  That's going to be okay.
[01:13:42.321 --> 01:13:45.943]  And by the way, that's what keeps the troops there, is supporting their buddies.
[01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:46.443]  That's right.
[01:13:47.043 --> 01:13:51.905]  And I saw one poor fella on CNN whose brother was killed.
[01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:55.647]  He's sitting there with his eight-month-old baby on his lap, and he goes, well,
[01:13:56.607 --> 01:13:58.949]  You know, they killed my brother, so I'm going back.
[01:13:59.229 --> 01:14:08.615]  Look, that vengeance isn't going to bring his brother back, and what it's going to do is perhaps end up having his baby lose a father and his parents who were begging him to stay.
[01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:09.916]  Lose another child.
[01:14:09.996 --> 01:14:12.558]  He doesn't even have to go back, but the guy's going back.
[01:14:12.758 --> 01:14:13.158]  Right.
[01:14:13.278 --> 01:14:18.742]  Going back so a bunch of fat cats can, you know, play risk on the face of the earth.
[01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:23.425]  Yeah, and Casey, one of Casey's buddies, in fact it was his best friend,
[01:14:24.205 --> 01:14:25.626]  He was with Casey when he died.
[01:14:25.686 --> 01:14:27.768]  He was Casey's chief in the motor pool.
[01:14:28.388 --> 01:14:31.070]  And he was on leave in September and he came back.
[01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.553]  And he came to visit us because he lives in California too.
[01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:38.816]  And he said, Cindy, they lied to us so bad.
[01:14:38.836 --> 01:14:47.662]  They told us we were going to go over there and we were going to build schools and get their water system going and build up relationships with the Iraqi people.
[01:14:47.702 --> 01:14:49.544]  He goes, every day this is what we do.
[01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:52.608]  They try to kill us, and we try to kill them.
[01:14:53.128 --> 01:14:55.849]  And he says it's all about just keeping each other alive.
[01:14:55.889 --> 01:14:57.869]  And I said, Mike, you know, you don't have to go back.
[01:14:57.929 --> 01:14:59.870]  This is against the law, what I'm about to tell you.
[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:03.071]  But I said, you know, we have money from Casey.
[01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:10.533]  If you want to take your family to Canada, or if you need a lawyer, we will help to fight to keep you from going back to this immoral war.
[01:15:11.253 --> 01:15:13.034]  And he said, Cindy, I have to go back.
[01:15:13.194 --> 01:15:14.194]  My men are there.
[01:15:15.597 --> 01:15:16.859]  He goes, I don't want to go back.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.741]  He was crying.
[01:15:17.761 --> 01:15:20.347]  He goes, I don't want to go back, but my men are there.
[01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:21.349]  I have to go back.
[01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:49.124]  They don't want to betray their friends, which is admirable, but then you look at the larger scale, it's just going to continue this black hole while a bunch of, I mean I watch Bush and the rest of them, I mean they're walking around in $5,000 gowns, and his daughters are putting their lipstick on and laughing, and they're just up there smirking, and the Democrats are all voting for this war, and they're just a bunch of, they're a bunch of decadent lying trash.
[01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:54.049]  And our young men are honorable and brave, and they're dying for this.
[01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:59.314]  And to me, it's just despicable what our country is doing.
[01:15:59.374 --> 01:16:02.417]  And, you know, I just want to say something to your parents out there.
[01:16:02.857 --> 01:16:06.321]  There is going to be a draft, and it's going to be coming sooner than we think.
[01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:10.485]  And don't let these maniacs have your children.
[01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:13.146]  Well, it's sacrificing them to the New World Order.
[01:16:13.386 --> 01:16:13.646]  Right.
[01:16:13.826 --> 01:16:16.246]  I mean, we already... Look, they already have a draft.
[01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:17.587]  Somebody served... Right.
[01:16:17.627 --> 01:16:28.789]  I mean, we've got guard who's been in country for two years, getting a month off here or there, and they're telling them, sorry, four years now, you're gonna... I mean, even in Vietnam and World War II, they didn't keep you in combat for, you know, for more than a year.
[01:16:29.009 --> 01:16:30.630]  Right, and people don't understand that.
[01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:35.671]  You know, they don't understand that there's already a draft, a backdoor draft, and a stop loss, and...
[01:16:36.537 --> 01:16:39.743]  And people say, well they signed on for that.
[01:16:39.803 --> 01:16:40.023]  No.
[01:16:40.244 --> 01:16:41.566]  A federal judge ruled.
[01:16:41.626 --> 01:16:43.610]  It does not say that in the contract.
[01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:45.172]  You sign up for the amount of time.
[01:16:45.213 --> 01:16:48.699]  And folks, people sit there, these armchair quarterbacks,
[01:16:50.017 --> 01:16:54.061]  And go, you know, attack Iran, attack Syria like it's something entertaining to watch on TV.
[01:16:54.281 --> 01:17:01.166]  Folks, they're going to send your children, and when they get their arms and legs blown off, or even worse, die, you know, you're going to be on this show.
[01:17:01.186 --> 01:17:07.451]  I'm having people call me, you know, after they lose children, oh, the war was wrong, you were right, I was wrong.
[01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:12.515]  You know, they better, we don't have to do this so these globalists can have the oil.
[01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:18.080]  You know, and it's just so, um, it's so heartbreaking when
[01:17:18.737 --> 01:17:23.241]  You know, I really blame myself for letting my son go.
[01:17:23.261 --> 01:17:30.328]  And people now, since Casey died, you know, all the proof has come out.
[01:17:31.248 --> 01:17:36.753]  And I didn't know anything about the Project for a New American Century before my son was killed.
[01:17:36.834 --> 01:17:38.375]  But now I know about that.
[01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:41.558]  You know, all the reports have come out saying that
[01:17:41.983 --> 01:17:43.764]  This war was based on lies.
[01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:49.007]  For those who don't know, this is basically, in a nutshell, just one thing Cheney wrote.
[01:17:49.527 --> 01:17:52.889]  We need terror attacks to get them to do what we want.
[01:17:52.909 --> 01:17:55.071]  Saddam is a threat, but he's got the oil.
[01:17:55.871 --> 01:18:00.774]  And so we're going to get into this war, and once we're there, we're going to expand it to Iran and Syria.
[01:18:00.794 --> 01:18:01.134]  Go ahead.
[01:18:01.194 --> 01:18:07.858]  Well, and then people won't wake up and realize that their government has betrayed them, and
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.221]  That's what Gold Star Families for Peace is trying to do.
[01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:16.383]  We're trying to wake these people up so they don't get the wake-up call that we get.
[01:18:17.043 --> 01:18:18.084]  Look, this isn't our government.
[01:18:18.424 --> 01:18:22.966]  It's been hijacked by criminal corporate interests that are not pre-marketed.
[01:18:23.006 --> 01:18:24.666]  We have been hijacked by organized crime.
[01:18:24.846 --> 01:18:25.327]  You're right.
[01:18:25.587 --> 01:18:30.368]  And you know, it's really hard to... We try to make it in as simple terms as possible.
[01:18:30.449 --> 01:18:33.350]  It's one mom's heart reaching out to another mom's heart.
[01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:35.751]  Because you don't want this to happen to you.
[01:18:35.771 --> 01:18:36.751]  It's a nightmare.
[01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:44.258]  Well, I mean, if our country was being attacked, then, you know, of course, we'd all volunteer.
[01:18:44.358 --> 01:18:44.879]  That's right.
[01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:46.881]  But this isn't the country that attacked us.
[01:18:46.901 --> 01:18:47.482]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:52.779 --> 01:18:54.260]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.141]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:18:59.482 --> 01:19:01.822]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:02.043 --> 01:19:03.583]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:03.963 --> 01:19:09.045]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:10.566]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:13.347]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:24.732]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[01:19:33.295 --> 01:19:38.780]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.842]  Get the map.

[01:19:52.609 --> 01:19:55.131]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:55.811 --> 01:20:05.357]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:20:06.445 --> 01:20:15.990]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:21.913]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation Chapter 13.
[01:20:23.293 --> 01:20:31.017]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:55.031]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:20:55.371 --> 01:20:58.253]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:04.699]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:21:05.059 --> 01:21:12.385]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:21:12.565 --> 01:21:16.649]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:54.118]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:54.378 --> 01:21:58.199]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:21:58.519 --> 01:21:59.339]  Read the labels.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.881]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:04.101 --> 01:22:08.302]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:08.682 --> 01:22:13.543]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:22:13.923 --> 01:22:17.526]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:22:17.706 --> 01:22:23.050]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:26.053]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:22:26.353 --> 01:22:27.253]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:22:54.856 --> 01:23:00.881]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:04.464]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.872 --> 01:23:09.473]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to take some of your calls.
[01:23:09.633 --> 01:23:29.842]  And if you disagree with us, if you think this war is a great thing, and you're like half-Americans in major polls who believe Saddam Hussein attacked us on 9-11, even though the government admits he didn't, or if you believe the propaganda that weapons of mass destruction were found, call us and explain to us.
[01:23:31.683 --> 01:23:35.665]  Or if you think the draft's a great thing, or if you think that this war's good,
[01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.632]  Or if you disagree with it, we'd love to hear from you.
[01:23:38.652 --> 01:23:40.632]  If you've got family serving over there, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:40.652 --> 01:23:40.732]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:40.752 --> 01:23:44.973]  Talking to Cindy Sheehan, and she was the mother of Army Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan, killed in action.
[01:23:54.753 --> 01:23:57.914]  Last year, she's the co-founder of Gold Star Families for Peace.
[01:23:57.934 --> 01:24:00.715]  We'll tell you about that website and organization here in a moment.
[01:24:00.955 --> 01:24:04.677]  You know, I saw, I talked about this on Monday, I saw two double amputees this weekend.
[01:24:04.757 --> 01:24:07.218]  One at a computer store, another at a grocery store.
[01:24:07.818 --> 01:24:10.259]  I saw one double amputee and one person who lost an arm.
[01:24:10.639 --> 01:24:16.421]  But this, you know, handsome black guy with a high and tight, you know, haircut in a wheelchair helping me get up.
[01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:21.003]  A real nice fellow helping me pick out a hard drive, a bigger hard drive.
[01:24:21.804 --> 01:24:23.545]  And I just said, did you get back from Iraq?
[01:24:23.585 --> 01:24:24.266]  And he said, yeah.
[01:24:24.406 --> 01:24:27.228]  And he still had bandages on his legs.
[01:24:27.928 --> 01:24:38.115]  And then I saw another fellow, a white guy, you know, nice looking guy with his, you know, short haircut, sitting there in the grocery store, having trouble pushing the cart, you know, and guiding it.
[01:24:38.635 --> 01:24:41.838]  And he had his arm blown off up at the shoulder.
[01:24:41.898 --> 01:24:43.178]  I said, did you just get back from Iraq?
[01:24:43.238 --> 01:24:43.839]  And he said, yeah.
[01:24:44.699 --> 01:24:45.960]  And I said, well, God bless you.
[01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:50.504]  But I mean, I'm seeing wreckage just around me.
[01:24:51.305 --> 01:25:06.597]  And it's been in major newspapers that they will discharge somebody in Germany at Rammstein or other bases, the big medical bases, just so they don't have to pay for their flight back and make families pay to fly them back.
[01:25:06.617 --> 01:25:08.059]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[01:25:10.461 --> 01:25:11.822]  Any comments to that, Cindy?
[01:25:12.743 --> 01:25:31.037]  Um, well, you know, I always get accused of not supporting the troops by my work, and, you know, I know my only way of supporting the troops now is since this is a proven, um, based on lies, this war, it has been unequivocally proven that it's based on lies, is to bring them home.
[01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:34.340]  Not one drop of Iraqi or American blood should be shed.
[01:25:34.915 --> 01:25:37.818]  They should just get out of there as fast as possible.
[01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:45.105]  And what I find even more despicable is the injuries in this war are way more serious than other wars.
[01:25:45.186 --> 01:25:53.094]  They're more often than not getting more than one limb blown off because of their Kevlar body armor.
[01:25:53.474 --> 01:25:54.715]  They get their limbs blown off.
[01:25:56.693 --> 01:26:01.636]  They have to go into the hospital for long periods of time and rehabilitation.
[01:26:02.076 --> 01:26:07.600]  And if they are in a VA hospital for over three months, they have to start paying for their own meals.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.941]  And to me, that is deplorable.
[01:26:10.001 --> 01:26:12.783]  These men, you know... It's never been done before.
[01:26:12.823 --> 01:26:13.683]  There are people... I know.
[01:26:13.703 --> 01:26:14.944]  And understand what she's saying.
[01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:20.507]  Normally in Vietnam or World War II or Korea, you would die from your injuries because they were so bad.
[01:26:20.547 --> 01:26:25.090]  But the body armor is so good that it just blows everything off that was around it.
[01:26:26.084 --> 01:26:38.134]  And so normally they would die, now they're not dying, and then they get here, and yes, people in the hospitals, I mean I'm talking triple amputees, are being forced to pay for their own meals.
[01:26:38.435 --> 01:26:42.818]  And they say that I don't support the troops.
[01:26:42.838 --> 01:26:44.780]  Supporting the troops means being mindless.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.522]  Well, you know what too, Alex, is that
[01:27:03.058 --> 01:27:20.044]  We found out, you know, Casey was only over there for two weeks so he just started a letter and he didn't have a chance to finish it and we got it back with his things but we found out that for the last two weeks of his life he was sleeping in his Humvee because there wasn't enough cots on post.
[01:27:20.385 --> 01:27:29.188]  He was stationed at FOB War Eagle in Sodder City and since he didn't, he gave up a bed, he was allowed to have one other meal a day.
[01:27:29.628 --> 01:27:31.910]  Because they were down to one meal a day.
[01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:36.414]  So if you give up your bed, you can have two meals a day.
[01:27:36.514 --> 01:27:37.955]  And again, it's all about profit.
[01:27:37.995 --> 01:27:44.081]  Halliburton does the meals, and they get billions, and they've been caught feeding old, rotten meals to them, contaminated water.
[01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:57.352]  It's all about profit, but for all the private contractors and CIA folks, they've got topless dancers, the finest whiskeys, drugs in the green zone, and they're just partying, while outside the armored compound, our troops are being slaughtered.
[01:27:57.632 --> 01:27:58.653]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:12.065]  And so, you know, and I just want to tell people, your listeners, supporting the troops would be getting them out of there, because, you know, we're going into Iran or Syria next, and our kids will never come home.
[01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:17.229]  It's going to be perpetual war, and that's what these people want, because they're getting richer.
[01:28:17.309 --> 01:28:18.530]  But war is peace.
[01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:21.453]  Ignorance is strength.
[01:28:21.813 --> 01:28:22.153]  Right.
[01:28:23.274 --> 01:28:23.595]  Right.
[01:28:23.915 --> 01:28:25.056]  And we, and wake up,
[01:28:25.976 --> 01:28:29.339]  Wake up America, because it's going to be your kids or you next.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:30.901]  Absolutely.
[01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:31.581]  Cindy, stay there.
[01:28:31.601 --> 01:28:35.885]  We're going to come back and talk about your organization and how folks get involved and try to end this criminal war.
[01:28:35.905 --> 01:28:38.508]  And then we'll also take folks' calls.
[01:28:38.568 --> 01:28:39.809]  So we'll be right back.
[01:28:39.889 --> 01:28:41.210]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:42.792 --> 01:28:43.692]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.173 --> 01:28:45.814]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.695 --> 01:28:49.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.595 --> 01:28:55.617]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:28:55.917 --> 01:29:00.860]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.462]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:29:05.762 --> 01:29:14.667]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:29:14.867 --> 01:29:18.489]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:29:18.769 --> 01:29:23.811]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:29:24.111 --> 01:29:30.854]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:29:31.315 --> 01:29:31.855]  What about you?
[01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:37.976]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:31:00.216 --> 01:31:04.438]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:04.678 --> 01:31:11.702]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.083 --> 01:31:18.206]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.346 --> 01:31:19.547]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:19.887 --> 01:31:22.829]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:22.989 --> 01:31:24.930]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:39.941]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.022]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:41.323]  Call today.
[01:32:06.367 --> 01:32:11.810]  Alright, Walt and Barney and Fred and Carol and Steve, your calls are all coming up here momentarily.
[01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:15.433]  We're talking to Cindy Sheehan.
[01:32:15.953 --> 01:32:17.334]  Lost her son in Iraq.
[01:32:19.175 --> 01:32:20.556]  And, uh, you know, he was a volunteer.
[01:32:20.616 --> 01:32:21.276]  He joined up.
[01:32:22.517 --> 01:32:24.998]  He went there, but he didn't agree with the war.
[01:32:25.018 --> 01:32:27.740]  He had to join the military in 2000, but he still went.
[01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:29.021]  And he died.
[01:32:29.041 --> 01:32:33.984]  And these reports, I've talked to the troops in person, but it's also been in mainstream news that
[01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:37.743]  They'll turn their tanks on when it's cold, because the winter just passed.
[01:32:39.264 --> 01:32:41.906]  And they'll be told, uh, turn them off, don't use fuel.
[01:32:43.066 --> 01:32:52.232]  Then the officers all go off and stay in the lavish palaces while they literally sleep in their tanks and their Humvees, and they're not given cold weather gear, they're given nothing, they're given, as she said, one meal a day.
[01:32:53.633 --> 01:32:54.354]  One meal a day.
[01:32:54.374 --> 01:33:02.059]  And because it's all about profit, they got, they got money to be, you know, feeding these guys T-bone steaks three times a day.
[01:33:02.259 --> 01:33:02.619]  It's just
[01:33:03.726 --> 01:33:05.507]  Pay for your food when your legs are blown off.
[01:33:05.787 --> 01:33:07.027]  Pay for your flight back home.
[01:33:07.187 --> 01:33:08.428]  It's just pure evil.
[01:33:09.168 --> 01:33:11.969]  And the Democrats and Republicans won't talk about it because they're all for this.
[01:33:13.069 --> 01:33:15.130]  They're all living high on the hog off this slavery.
[01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:21.131]  Cindy, tell us about your organization and any other points you want to make before we go to these calls.
[01:33:21.732 --> 01:33:25.133]  I founded an organization called Gold Star Families for Peace.
[01:33:25.413 --> 01:33:29.634]  A gold star family is a family that has lost a loved one in the war.
[01:33:30.454 --> 01:33:31.635]  And we were all
[01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:41.821]  Going out separately around the country, speaking out for peace and against the war, and to support our troops by bringing them home.
[01:33:42.562 --> 01:33:47.866]  And our mission is to bring the troops home before any other families have to go through what we're going through.
[01:33:48.527 --> 01:33:58.575]  And we realize we can't bring our loved ones back, but hopefully with our efforts and what we say and what we do, we can bring the rest of America's children home before it's too late.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:08.605]  And if you want to go on our website, it's www.gssssp.org.
[01:34:09.765 --> 01:34:11.686]  And give that address out one more time, please.
[01:34:12.687 --> 01:34:19.650]  www.gsssp.org.
[01:34:19.851 --> 01:34:21.231]  Gold Star Families for Peace.
[01:34:21.431 --> 01:34:25.433]  And folks, if you go to my website, infowars.com, it says the guest for today.
[01:34:25.794 --> 01:34:28.435]  You can click right there and go directly to her website.
[01:34:29.116 --> 01:34:30.897]  So that's what posted on InfoWars.
[01:34:31.197 --> 01:34:33.398]  And I can be contacted through the website too.
[01:34:33.719 --> 01:34:39.002]  It says contact members, click on that, and then you can click on my email and contact me.
[01:34:39.302 --> 01:34:41.263]  I wanted to just briefly talk about numbers of dead.
[01:34:41.303 --> 01:34:42.404]  What, it's 1,200 and something now?
[01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:44.565]  Um, it's 1,469 the last time I looked last night.
[01:34:44.585 --> 01:34:44.805]  Oh, 469, sorry.
[01:34:44.825 --> 01:34:46.066]  Five soldiers were killed yesterday.
[01:34:52.606 --> 01:34:54.569]  Okay, so it's almost 1,500 now.
[01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:56.311]  I was going off a number a few months old.
[01:34:56.752 --> 01:34:57.613]  I apologize.
[01:34:58.254 --> 01:35:04.943]  But I've also seen reports where they don't count somebody as a theater death or a casualty KIA.
[01:35:08.297 --> 01:35:10.758]  Unless they die in Iraq.
[01:35:10.778 --> 01:35:17.341]  A lot of them are flown out to Germany and then that doesn't count as dying from wounds from combat.
[01:35:17.821 --> 01:35:29.785]  And that the numbers, as you mentioned earlier, of just injured and maimed and disfigured is astronomically higher because of the body armor.
[01:35:30.806 --> 01:35:36.248]  I've been told also that as long as they get their foot on a helicopter
[01:35:37.434 --> 01:35:46.156]  They don't count as being killed in Iraq, so they're not counted as an official death in the war.
[01:35:46.677 --> 01:35:53.679]  And I was talking to a Marine that had been out of the Marines, and he worked in the morgue.
[01:35:54.259 --> 01:36:00.360]  And he told me, and this was months ago, he told me that the casualty figures are way low.
[01:36:01.181 --> 01:36:04.602]  He said that at least a thousand Marines have been killed in this war.
[01:36:05.082 --> 01:36:06.162]  And this was months ago.
[01:36:07.415 --> 01:36:08.076]  Don't believe this.
[01:36:09.397 --> 01:36:19.525]  For the first four years of the undeclared war in Vietnam, over 6,000 of our troops died, and they kept it secret until the mid-70s.
[01:36:19.605 --> 01:36:23.709]  So, they've done this before, and this is something America never did until Vietnam.
[01:36:24.009 --> 01:36:26.411]  Now, the Soviets and others, they always did stuff like this.
[01:36:26.771 --> 01:36:33.017]  They would tell families, don't tell anybody that your husband or your son died in Afghanistan.
[01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:33.877]  Keep your mouth shut.
[01:36:34.478 --> 01:36:35.699]  And so, on top of it,
[01:36:36.926 --> 01:36:47.033]  I'm sure you heard about a month ago that in Louisiana they were bringing in a bunch of the dead and the families that we wanted to be seen and the officers rebelled and said, okay, we're going to show people the covens.
[01:36:47.073 --> 01:36:50.535]  So we're also seeing now people in the military aren't putting up with this.
[01:36:50.575 --> 01:36:58.661]  I mean, the propaganda we hear that the troops love and worship Bush and they just love the war, from what I've been hearing from the troops, that's not the case.
[01:36:59.021 --> 01:37:01.903]  Well, from the troops I hear from, that's not the case either.
[01:37:02.893 --> 01:37:15.216]  I'm sure if you go, if you went over there and searched and searched you can find people that still support the war and support the president and those are the only people that we see on the mainstream news.
[01:37:16.316 --> 01:37:28.699]  The picture that Tammy Solisio took back in April of the flag-draped coffins coming home that she got fired from her job for, my son was in one of those coffins.
[01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:32.851]  Before that, the Army does not tell you anything.
[01:37:32.891 --> 01:37:36.832]  The only reason I know about details of my son's death is that his buddy told me.
[01:37:37.632 --> 01:37:38.933]  And his buddies told me.
[01:37:38.973 --> 01:37:41.853]  They've filled in the missing pieces of that day.
[01:37:42.234 --> 01:37:53.837]  And before I saw that picture on the news, we didn't know that if maybe they just put Casey in a body bag and stacked him in the corner like cordwood.
[01:37:54.337 --> 01:37:59.979]  You know, and to us, to see what care they were, and honor that they were treated with from the time
[01:38:00.615 --> 01:38:03.417]  You know, they left Iraq to come back to America.
[01:38:03.957 --> 01:38:07.359]  You know, that was something that was a comfort to us.
[01:38:07.419 --> 01:38:18.024]  You know, these boys are sent over to be killed and then they're brought back in the dark of night like they're, like, you know, they should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:38:18.084 --> 01:38:19.505]  Like they're a dirty porno magazine.
[01:38:19.625 --> 01:38:20.566]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:24.004 --> 01:38:27.607]  This is another slap in the face to us families.
[01:38:29.808 --> 01:38:32.070]  And I believe that my son is a hero.
[01:38:32.651 --> 01:38:37.895]  My son was an honorable, brave man who went to save his buddies.
[01:38:38.599 --> 01:38:44.023]  I only question the people who sent them there and what were any of them doing there in that situation anyway.
[01:38:44.123 --> 01:38:46.945]  Well, if you support the Tribs... Of course I do.
[01:38:46.985 --> 01:38:51.348]  No, I was going to say, if you support the Tribs and the listeners, then you should have them back here right now.
[01:38:51.548 --> 01:39:00.914]  I have had the man who literally wrote the book for the Pentagon, the PhD, the doctorate, on this broadcast, who was sent to Iraq to study DU in 91,
[01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:04.207]  Almost his whole team has died.
[01:39:04.267 --> 01:39:05.768]  Dr. Doug Rocky.
[01:39:06.329 --> 01:39:08.130]  He has had cancer multiple times.
[01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:13.914]  Their own handbooks prior to that said, if you breathe this, it's going to kill you from the heavy metal effects alone.
[01:39:15.355 --> 01:39:17.996]  And the toxicity and the radiation.
[01:39:18.337 --> 01:39:20.418]  The New York Daily News tested 14 troops.
[01:39:20.458 --> 01:39:23.280]  All 14 had high levels of radiation, upwards of 2 rems.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.742]  Because these DU companies, folks, don't just put DU in it.
[01:39:26.762 --> 01:39:28.083]  They're getting rid of toxic waste.
[01:39:28.443 --> 01:39:30.585]  They're putting a higher radiation level in it.
[01:39:31.856 --> 01:39:33.997]  The entire country's been salted with this.
[01:39:34.117 --> 01:39:35.438]  It is an abomination.
[01:39:36.038 --> 01:39:38.739]  And when you bomb Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the radiation goes away, folks.
[01:39:39.219 --> 01:39:40.320]  Not with DU.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.360]  This stuff's gonna be there for millions of years.
[01:39:43.001 --> 01:39:45.002]  Our troops are coming back and they're not giving them treatment.
[01:39:45.042 --> 01:39:47.663]  I mean, I've had the fathers on the show crying.
[01:39:48.223 --> 01:39:50.584]  You know, whose sons came back and died at DU.
[01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:51.904]  And they're breaking down.
[01:39:52.164 --> 01:39:53.545]  I mean, is that supporting the troops?
[01:39:53.625 --> 01:39:54.145]  Sending them?
[01:39:54.565 --> 01:40:00.588]  And it's illegal to give them experimental vaccines when the drug companies have been caught paying the government?
[01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:04.535]  Paying politicians off to test drugs on the troops as guinea pigs?
[01:40:04.775 --> 01:40:08.516]  Literally, like, using your sons and daughters as rodents?
[01:40:09.316 --> 01:40:11.677]  And oh, that's how you support them, you sickos?
[01:40:12.177 --> 01:40:12.517]  Out there?
[01:40:12.537 --> 01:40:13.837]  I mean, you people make me sick!
[01:40:14.197 --> 01:40:23.160]  Well, what about all the Iraqi children that have been born since the first Gulf War with terrible deformities because of the DU we left out last year?
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.840]  Their deformities have at least tripled.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:25.520]  Yeah.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.681]  And the same thing is now showing up in Serbia.
[01:40:28.641 --> 01:40:28.901]  Yeah.
[01:40:30.089 --> 01:40:36.992]  You know, another thing that we don't talk about... Those four vets have three times the higher percentage as well of having to form children.
[01:40:37.033 --> 01:40:37.333]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.633 --> 01:40:38.853]  Oh, that's right.
[01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:41.675]  It's the suicides after the kids are coming home.
[01:40:42.395 --> 01:40:46.757]  You know, they don't even count them at the VA, so we don't know.
[01:40:47.158 --> 01:40:53.421]  We don't have a reliable figure for the suicides of our children who are coming home just from this war.
[01:40:54.241 --> 01:40:57.763]  You know, and they rarely
[01:40:58.584 --> 01:41:03.525]  The VA will rarely admit that they killed themselves because of post-traumatic stress.
[01:41:04.085 --> 01:41:07.386]  They usually say it was, you know, because they broke up with their girlfriend or something like that.
[01:41:07.406 --> 01:41:09.166]  Well, I've read the Army studies.
[01:41:09.666 --> 01:41:14.527]  I've read the military studies and I've had their psychologists on people that have studied this.
[01:41:14.867 --> 01:41:16.788]  They knew, again, back in World War II.
[01:41:16.808 --> 01:41:20.309]  I mean, they knew 200 years ago, marching their redcoats around.
[01:41:20.409 --> 01:41:22.749]  I've read some of the old British redcoat manuals.
[01:41:23.389 --> 01:41:25.910]  You can't keep soldiers in combat indefinitely.
[01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:26.490]  They burn out.
[01:41:27.743 --> 01:41:33.508]  And troops have never been put through this long of sustained, continual combat.
[01:41:33.528 --> 01:41:37.731]  In Vietnam, they put you two or three days in the bush, take you out for two or three days.
[01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:38.771]  Or longer.
[01:41:38.791 --> 01:41:42.194]  This time, I'm told, it is just non-stop.
[01:41:42.374 --> 01:41:42.554]  Right.
[01:41:42.614 --> 01:41:44.916]  It's relentless, what they're going through right now.
[01:41:45.336 --> 01:41:51.361]  You know, they might get a weekend of R&R occasionally, but, you know, where do they go?
[01:41:52.409 --> 01:41:53.730]  You know, there's no place to go for that.
[01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:58.274]  Well, they're lucky to be getting one meal, and we don't support the Tribs because we want them to get more than one meal.
[01:41:58.314 --> 01:41:59.735]  We're bad.
[01:41:59.795 --> 01:42:00.956]  We want them to get more than one meal.
[01:42:01.117 --> 01:42:01.977]  Okay, I'm bad.
[01:42:02.097 --> 01:42:03.939]  I admit it.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:11.766]  We're bad because we want to support them and have them, you know, when their arms and legs are blown off, get their plane ticket paid for.
[01:42:11.826 --> 01:42:16.610]  But, again, that may be Al Qaeda-ish.
[01:42:16.650 --> 01:42:19.132]  Let's talk to Walt in Kansas City.
[01:42:19.432 --> 01:42:20.033]  Walt, go ahead.
[01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:25.305]  Yeah, well, God bless you both, Alex, and I want you to know I'm listening every day.
[01:42:25.385 --> 01:42:27.286]  I just don't call.
[01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:28.367]  Kind of busy.
[01:42:28.387 --> 01:42:32.309]  Yeah, I want to give you a story about my son.
[01:42:32.449 --> 01:42:40.254]  He told me that he had never been so sick in his life because of all the shots he thinks.
[01:42:40.314 --> 01:42:43.836]  And I said, well, of course it's because of all of the shots that you're getting.
[01:42:43.856 --> 01:42:46.117]  You know, the stuff keeps stacking up.
[01:42:46.177 --> 01:42:47.158]  Now, he's at a base
[01:42:47.970 --> 01:42:49.211]  Called Anaconda.
[01:42:49.471 --> 01:42:50.692]  LSA Anaconda.
[01:42:50.732 --> 01:42:52.073]  Logistics Support Area.
[01:42:52.113 --> 01:42:54.594]  There's 25,000 troops there.
[01:42:55.635 --> 01:42:57.696]  And, uh, let me give you the website.
[01:42:57.716 --> 01:42:58.877]  You can just type this in.
[01:42:58.957 --> 01:43:00.198]  Morgaritaville.
[01:43:00.218 --> 01:43:04.420]  Into your Explorer, Netscape, or whatever.
[01:43:04.661 --> 01:43:07.663]  M-O-R-T-A-R-I-T-A-V-I-L-L-E.
[01:43:08.043 --> 01:43:16.028]  And you'll see all kinds of news articles where a general has requested on numerous occasions more troops for, uh, Parameter Patrol.
[01:43:17.222 --> 01:43:18.423]  And, uh, been denied.
[01:43:18.443 --> 01:43:21.846]  Uh, they're having to pay for their own uniforms.
[01:43:23.287 --> 01:43:26.730]  They're having to buy their own fuel at $1.93 a gallon.
[01:43:28.852 --> 01:43:30.573]  Uh, paying for their own meals.
[01:43:30.633 --> 01:43:34.537]  My son, uh, is an Air Force mechanic, a B-2 mechanic.
[01:43:35.237 --> 01:43:40.522]  But yet they've got him driving trucks for the 7th Battalion, 7th Truck Transportation Battalion.
[01:43:40.762 --> 01:43:42.203]  That's the most dangerous job!
[01:43:42.323 --> 01:43:42.723]  Yeah!
[01:43:42.964 --> 01:43:43.184]  Yeah!
[01:43:44.102 --> 01:43:53.345]  And he's a staff sergeant, so they've made him a platoon leader, which means he drives in one of them armored Humvees, kind of like, you know, lead man.
[01:43:54.365 --> 01:43:57.606]  You know, there's no more dangerous job than being a point man.
[01:43:58.426 --> 01:44:05.689]  And the mechanics and others there, the MPs and stuff for the Air Force, have even volunteered to go do the parameter patrols.
[01:44:06.269 --> 01:44:11.210]  But they said it'd take about three weeks to train them for that.
[01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:13.651]  Plus, they need somebody to work on the aircraft.
[01:44:14.502 --> 01:44:21.087]  When they come in, damaged or something, and the Air Force will not even keep aircraft there.
[01:44:21.127 --> 01:44:22.468]  They say it's too dangerous.
[01:44:22.828 --> 01:44:36.198]  So what we have is, what we have is, well we have people living in these ivory towers with marble all around them, out on their million dollar jet boats, flying in their helicopters, laughing, giggling, slurping beer.
[01:44:36.679 --> 01:44:39.561]  Meanwhile, Iraq is already fallen.
[01:44:39.581 --> 01:44:40.722]  It is totally imploded.
[01:44:41.678 --> 01:44:49.645]  Yeah, and let's not forget about these pieces of garbage that are going also to Bohemian Groves to live it up while our boys are getting slaughtered over there.
[01:44:49.665 --> 01:44:54.809]  That's right, all our Christian conservative leaders are going to have sex with their male prostitutes.
[01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:56.050]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:56.151 --> 01:44:57.792]  You know, uh... New York Post.
[01:44:58.232 --> 01:45:04.698]  I'm still doing my thing with your videos and getting the word out as much as I can and I'm finding a lot more people are waking up
[01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:16.732]  And, uh, I'm, uh, the tapes that Dave and Joyce made, uh, the Gulf War Vets and all of the stuff about that, I'm getting those out, too, in regards to your DU and everything.
[01:45:16.752 --> 01:45:32.476]  And, you know, if you go to the website, right on the base's own website, Balad, Iraq is where it is, B-A-L-A-D, right on the base's own website, it says that they inspected for HMX, because that's one of the places that the HMX was stored.
[01:45:33.542 --> 01:45:35.503]  And it says check for radioactivity.
[01:45:35.523 --> 01:45:37.043]  The IAEA did.
[01:45:38.544 --> 01:45:39.764]  But you know what they leave out?
[01:45:39.844 --> 01:45:40.424]  The results.
[01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:42.085]  Now I hear you Walt.
[01:45:42.165 --> 01:45:45.026]  God bless you and please keep us informed about your son.
[01:45:45.426 --> 01:45:47.867]  Please call in with that information.
[01:45:47.887 --> 01:45:50.428]  Now let me just add this to what he's saying.
[01:45:51.848 --> 01:45:54.749]  In the first Gulf War, they bombed
[01:45:55.646 --> 01:45:58.007]  Mainly just a few highways and military bases.
[01:45:58.867 --> 01:46:04.470]  A lot of DU was used, about one-third of what was used this time, thousands of times, but it was used out in the desert.
[01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:06.130]  This time, they bombarded.
[01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:12.353]  Even when they knew the enemy had already fled and surrendered, they bombarded almost all the major military bases.
[01:46:12.393 --> 01:46:13.893]  Well, where do you think our troops moved in?
[01:46:13.913 --> 01:46:15.494]  This is admitted.
[01:46:16.104 --> 01:46:21.468]  And they just send them right in and they live right in buildings with holes blown in the top by DU.
[01:46:21.488 --> 01:46:22.548]  They're just in there breathing it.
[01:46:22.869 --> 01:46:24.630]  Man, this is out of control, folks.
[01:46:25.410 --> 01:46:27.111]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[01:46:27.151 --> 01:46:27.792]  Barney, go ahead.
[01:46:27.812 --> 01:46:28.492]  You're on the air then.
[01:46:28.832 --> 01:46:31.194]  Then Steve and a bunch of other people.
[01:46:31.234 --> 01:46:32.295]  Go ahead, Barney.
[01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:32.855]  Yeah.
[01:46:33.556 --> 01:46:43.002]  Hey, I spoke about this before, Alex, but on Tarawa during World War II, we had an average temperature of around 130 degrees.
[01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:54.015]  And once we were able to take over the land and expel all the Japanese, we could take off our battle gear.
[01:46:54.055 --> 01:46:56.276]  We could go around and cheese search and dungarees.
[01:46:57.307 --> 01:47:03.892]  But the idea is these kids over here, they have to go around in full battle dress and temperatures of 130 degrees.
[01:47:04.572 --> 01:47:13.499]  The point is, you had an enemy in front of you, classical warfare, symmetrical, that you could go defeat and then you'd get R&R and play volleyball and go swimming.
[01:47:13.819 --> 01:47:15.060]  Now, it's just continual.
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:18.242]  Yeah, well, we, like I said before,
[01:47:19.028 --> 01:47:39.033]  We had sweat glands rattle up on our body and we had these large cysts, big as your thumbnail, come up all over our back, over the back of our neck, behind our ear, got fungus in our ears, and I used to go into the bow of an airplane and clean the five machine guns, and I'd be in there 15 minutes, I'd come out soaking wet.
[01:47:39.613 --> 01:47:42.534]  And can you imagine what these kids with battle gear are doing?
[01:47:43.306 --> 01:47:46.248]  And they are having heart attacks and everything over there.
[01:47:46.728 --> 01:47:51.271]  The people over there, especially the Guard and the Reserve, they're all out of shape.
[01:47:51.451 --> 01:47:53.452]  It gets freezing cold in the winter.
[01:47:54.156 --> 01:47:55.317]  Yeah.
[01:47:55.397 --> 01:47:59.659]  In the top half of Iraq, and then it gets boiling hot nationwide.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:00.340]  Yeah.
[01:48:01.801 --> 01:48:03.922]  I have read 133 degrees.
[01:48:04.142 --> 01:48:04.642]  That's right.
[01:48:04.682 --> 01:48:05.983]  That's hot, baby.
[01:48:06.023 --> 01:48:07.924]  You just picked her up.
[01:48:07.984 --> 01:48:13.808]  No, I did two-a-days once when it was 117, and they didn't cancel the two-a-days.
[01:48:13.848 --> 01:48:15.009]  Some of the other high schools did.
[01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:20.052]  Well, you know what the bad part is, when it comes right down to it, the one-worlders
[01:48:20.891 --> 01:48:31.320]  Trying to take our borders away and destroy our sovereignty and the Iraqis are actually fighting our war against the one worlders and we're killing the Iraqis.
[01:48:34.143 --> 01:48:36.605]  Unbelievable Barney, thank you for your call.
[01:48:36.625 --> 01:48:39.507]  There's a World War II for you.
[01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:42.189]  That's some amazing testimony Cindy.
[01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:46.773]  Yes, well you know what, I guess war has always been really bad but
[01:48:49.162 --> 01:48:55.127]  Like you said, if we were attacked, if the United States was in danger, we would all defend our country.
[01:48:55.547 --> 01:49:00.832]  I'd go out with my rolling pin to try and get, you know, the attackers out of the country.
[01:49:00.892 --> 01:49:04.154]  And I don't blame the Iraqi people for my son's death at all.
[01:49:04.675 --> 01:49:05.976]  You know, we do the same thing.
[01:49:06.016 --> 01:49:11.600]  In fact, we did the same thing in the Revolutionary War, you know, so we could be free from Great Britain.
[01:49:12.501 --> 01:49:14.363]  And, you know, it's just amazing to me that
[01:49:17.230 --> 01:49:22.413]  More than half of America think that this is a moral and just war that we're fighting.
[01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:23.914]  Well, it isn't more than half America.
[01:49:23.934 --> 01:49:24.654]  I've talked to people.
[01:49:24.694 --> 01:49:25.454]  That's propaganda.
[01:49:25.975 --> 01:49:26.635]  I hope so.
[01:49:27.255 --> 01:49:27.876]  I hope you're right.
[01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:32.958]  We'll be back and I'm told that Louie disagrees and we'll go to Steve as well.
[01:49:34.659 --> 01:49:38.761]  I'll try to hold my guest up about five minutes over to the next hour so we have more time to take your calls.
[01:49:39.562 --> 01:49:46.005]  Then we've got a guest coming on to talk about the new national security minion, the torture lord, Negroponte.
[01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.023]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.203 --> 01:49:57.307]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:57.447 --> 01:50:01.331]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:05.636]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:05.976 --> 01:50:09.741]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:11.683]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.263 --> 01:50:15.185]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:15.225 --> 01:50:19.909]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.089 --> 01:50:23.131]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.311 --> 01:50:26.153]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:26.653 --> 01:50:32.778]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.298 --> 01:50:37.101]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:51:05.015 --> 01:51:09.681]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:10.141 --> 01:51:16.867]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:17.268 --> 01:51:29.038]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.518 --> 01:51:33.980]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:53:07.682 --> 01:53:09.082]  The government doesn't own you.
[01:53:09.142 --> 01:53:10.503]  The government isn't your master.
[01:53:10.563 --> 01:53:11.343]  We are the people.
[01:53:11.703 --> 01:53:13.684]  In America, we're supposed to be above the government.
[01:53:15.345 --> 01:53:16.945]  But now we're going back into slavery.
[01:53:16.985 --> 01:53:17.886]  It's just that simple.
[01:53:17.906 --> 01:53:23.368]  We're about to go back to our guest, Louie, who disagrees with us, and Steve and others have been patiently holding.
[01:53:24.208 --> 01:53:25.969]  But you always go to the front of the line if you disagree.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.642]  But before we do that, folks, it's time to wake people up.
[01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:31.703]  It's time to engage in the information war.
[01:53:32.243 --> 01:53:34.084]  It's time to expose the New World Order.
[01:53:34.745 --> 01:53:43.650]  In my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, the first 25 minutes of the film gets into who the neocons are, the false left-right paradigm, the phoniness of the Iraq War.
[01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:48.012]  It details the fraud and explains it to people and gets into PNAC.
[01:53:48.793 --> 01:53:52.855]  And it's a two-hour, 44-minute film to give you an idea of how much is in this thing.
[01:53:53.695 --> 01:53:56.796]  It's $25.95, the equivalent of three or four films in one.
[01:53:57.996 --> 01:54:02.277]  But if you order three or more of any of the eleven films I've made, they drop down to $19.95 apiece.
[01:54:02.697 --> 01:54:07.919]  That is a $18 discount on the three-tape special, $24 discount on the four-tape special.

[01:54:50.517 --> 01:54:53.460]  Louie in Texas, I hear you disagree with something.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.081]  You're on the air.
[01:54:54.121 --> 01:54:54.521]  Go ahead.
[01:54:55.162 --> 01:54:55.682]  Can you hear me?
[01:54:55.863 --> 01:54:56.363]  Yes, I can.
[01:54:56.764 --> 01:54:57.124]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:57.224 --> 01:55:01.328]  Okay, Mr. Jones, I'm a subscriber to your website.
[01:55:05.305 --> 01:55:10.712]  My disagreeance with you is that you're not screaming loud enough.
[01:55:11.153 --> 01:55:11.753]  I knew it.
[01:55:11.974 --> 01:55:13.235]  We are in trouble.
[01:55:14.537 --> 01:55:22.267]  And let me tell you something, another thing that makes me mad, I tried to download Police State 3 and for some reason I can't view it.
[01:55:22.307 --> 01:55:24.049]  That's the best thing I've ever seen.
[01:55:25.374 --> 01:55:27.196]  People need to see that video.
[01:55:27.396 --> 01:55:29.898]  Well, send an email and we'll check it.
[01:55:30.158 --> 01:55:33.160]  It might be the file's too big.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.761]  Do you have high bandwidth or low bandwidth?
[01:55:34.781 --> 01:55:39.485]  I have high bandwidth and I mean it took forever to download it and I get it and I can't even see it.
[01:55:39.885 --> 01:55:41.666]  And I'm telling you, I think it's your masterpiece.
[01:55:42.467 --> 01:55:45.269]  Well, what I'll do... But you need to make more noise.
[01:55:45.369 --> 01:55:48.912]  I mean, our lives are in your hands, people like you.
[01:55:49.492 --> 01:55:50.733]  You have power out there.
[01:55:51.243 --> 01:55:52.324]  You need to make more noise.
[01:55:52.344 --> 01:55:53.624]  You're not making enough noise.
[01:55:53.664 --> 01:55:56.506]  I mean, just really get out there and make more noise.
[01:55:57.106 --> 01:56:03.249]  I love your work, and we are in a serious situation in history right now.
[01:56:04.330 --> 01:56:08.212]  Sandy, do you have anything to say to what our caller is saying?
[01:56:08.472 --> 01:56:11.253]  Well, I'm screaming so loud I'm losing my voice.
[01:56:11.914 --> 01:56:20.218]  So, I was screaming out in the rain the other day, and you know, we just need more people to help us, Louie, so join us in our
[01:56:20.965 --> 01:56:24.528]  I want people to know that this is not a joke.
[01:56:24.548 --> 01:56:27.271]  The troops really do have to pay for their own food.
[01:56:39.617 --> 01:56:40.417]  They really do.
[01:56:41.758 --> 01:56:47.721]  They tell them you've got to have clean uniforms, but then they charge them $100 for 10 pounds of laundry.
[01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:49.022]  I mean, this has never been done.
[01:56:50.442 --> 01:56:59.747]  Our government's so corrupt, the private corporations there literally ensure that they suck every amount of money out of their paychecks, and then nothing goes home to the families.
[01:56:59.767 --> 01:57:01.107]  I mean, this is so evil.
[01:57:01.187 --> 01:57:03.248]  This has never been done before.
[01:57:03.929 --> 01:57:06.290]  Well, right, the families are left at home, too.
[01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:08.751]  They're on food stamps, you know, they're on
[01:57:09.218 --> 01:57:10.544]  They're on welfare.
[01:57:10.625 --> 01:57:11.931]  They can't make ends meet.
[01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:13.036]  They're losing their homes.
[01:57:13.076 --> 01:57:14.181]  They're losing their cars.
[01:57:14.801 --> 01:57:21.305]  Especially our troops in the National Guard who joined to guard the nation and were sent to a war.
[01:57:21.785 --> 01:57:25.668]  So, if there's a draft coming, it's going to be here.
[01:57:26.208 --> 01:57:29.650]  And your sons and daughters won't even be able to join the National Guard.
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:32.492]  And it's going to come after the Globalists carry out another terror attack.
[01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:34.293]  And they won't be safe in the National Guard.
[01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:35.474]  Absolutely.
[01:57:35.534 --> 01:57:36.575]  Louie, thanks for the call.
[01:57:36.595 --> 01:57:37.635]  Stay there for five more minutes.
[01:57:37.655 --> 01:57:39.617]  We're going to start the third hour.
[01:57:39.637 --> 01:57:42.899]  Stay with us.
[01:57:42.979 --> 01:57:43.339]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.698 --> 01:57:50.318]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.998 --> 01:57:52.039]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.779 --> 01:57:53.859]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.519 --> 01:57:55.359]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.099 --> 01:57:56.980]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.461]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:06.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.022 --> 01:58:13.403]  You don't want to miss the interview that's coming up here in about five minutes with Matthew Rothschild.
[01:58:14.466 --> 01:58:20.611]  Editor of the Progressive Magazine on Bush's pick of Negroponte for National Intelligence Director.
[01:58:22.553 --> 01:58:23.734]  That's coming up.
[01:58:23.914 --> 01:58:27.057]  The Lord of Torture to get a bigger post for himself.
[01:58:27.677 --> 01:58:30.620]  I love all these Iran-Contra crooks being in control.
[01:58:31.221 --> 01:58:35.664]  We are talking to Cindy Sheehan who lost her son in Iraq last year.
[01:58:36.265 --> 01:58:41.990]  She started Gold Star Families for Peace and he was a specialist and was killed in an attack on their home V column.
[01:58:42.792 --> 01:58:44.093]  Let's take it quickly, callers.
[01:58:44.113 --> 01:58:46.895]  I want to get a few of the callers that have been holding the longest in here.
[01:58:47.716 --> 01:58:49.217]  Let's talk to Steve in Ohio.
[01:58:49.237 --> 01:58:50.097]  Thanks for holding, Steve.
[01:58:50.117 --> 01:58:50.638]  You're on the air.
[01:58:51.138 --> 01:58:52.940]  Yes, hello, Alex, and hello, Cindy.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:53.520]  Hello.
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.241]  I'm so sorry to hear about your son.
[01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:56.302]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:58:56.702 --> 01:58:59.684]  And, unfortunately, he died for the love of money.
[01:58:59.704 --> 01:59:00.285]  Right.
[01:59:00.365 --> 01:59:01.686]  Which, of course, is the root of all evil.
[01:59:02.166 --> 01:59:05.368]  You know, we've got fascism now in control of the government.
[01:59:05.569 --> 01:59:08.651]  You know, that's business controlling the government, which is fascism.
[01:59:08.891 --> 01:59:09.411]  Right, exactly.
[01:59:10.732 --> 01:59:13.738]  The troops are nothing more than property or assets to be used.
[01:59:14.359 --> 01:59:21.851]  Now, the war, in my opinion, was about Saddam not accepting dollars for payment for oil, and there was a lot of talk in the Middle East about that occurring.
[01:59:23.181 --> 01:59:40.945]  Now, the Fed needed to put a stop to any of the talk about dumping the dollar, and it came out yesterday evening, Alex, that the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, Daddy Bush, Newt Gingrich, and many big players in Washington, D.C., were also involved in the food for oil scandal.
[01:59:41.505 --> 01:59:42.206]  No, I knew that.
[01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:48.273]  The only company allowed by the sanctions to sell in Iraq was Halliburton.
[01:59:48.693 --> 01:59:50.435]  They write all this for themselves.
[01:59:51.155 --> 01:59:54.518]  But see, the left goes, oh look, they're involved, and the right goes, oh, Coffee Inn's involved.
[01:59:54.538 --> 01:59:56.359]  The point is, they're all involved.
[01:59:56.699 --> 02:00:01.042]  Yeah, but the Federal Reserve actually made more money than any other group.
[02:00:01.523 --> 02:00:08.488]  Hey, the Federal Reserve, this came out a year and a half ago, the Federal Reserve takes the money from Iraq, from the oil, and puts it in its own bank account.
[02:00:09.328 --> 02:00:11.490]  Just type in Federal Reserve taking oil money.
[02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:12.390]  No, I mean, it's true!
[02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:12.851]  Yeah.
[02:00:13.747 --> 02:00:14.488]  You know what?
[02:00:15.448 --> 02:00:18.251]  If you want to be heard, you really need to not call in on speaker phones.
[02:00:19.071 --> 02:00:20.012]  I'm not on a speaker phone Alex.
[02:00:20.332 --> 02:00:21.033]  Well, sounds like it.
[02:00:21.133 --> 02:00:21.333]  Oh, okay.
[02:00:21.353 --> 02:00:23.475]  Well, anyway, also the Iraqi elections.
[02:00:23.515 --> 02:00:25.356]  We were told how great they were.
[02:00:26.357 --> 02:00:30.720]  Well, unfortunately, we're going to end up having fundamentalism over in Iraq.
[02:00:31.521 --> 02:00:33.883]  And there's going to be a war again.
[02:00:33.923 --> 02:00:37.145]  We're going to end up going to war with Iran and Syria.
[02:00:37.165 --> 02:00:38.186]  Well, that's how they make money.
[02:00:38.206 --> 02:00:38.927]  I've got to let you go.
[02:00:38.987 --> 02:00:40.168]  I appreciate the call.
[02:00:40.188 --> 02:00:41.629]  We're going to take one more call here.
[02:00:41.729 --> 02:00:43.190]  Who was up next in train here?
[02:00:44.761 --> 02:00:45.602]  Danny in Oklahoma.
[02:00:45.642 --> 02:00:46.582]  Go ahead quickly, Danny.
[02:00:46.802 --> 02:00:55.769]  Yeah, Alex, we're already slaves and when you join the military you become a voluntary servitude to the United States government.
[02:00:56.009 --> 02:00:59.151]  But you're not allowed to give your slaves experimental shots.
[02:00:59.171 --> 02:00:59.851]  That's the law.
[02:00:59.871 --> 02:01:02.813]  You're not allowed to put them in DU environments.
[02:01:03.214 --> 02:01:06.196]  Well, we're not operating under the Constitution or the law.
[02:01:06.256 --> 02:01:06.856]  You know that.
[02:01:07.256 --> 02:01:07.777]  No, I know.
[02:01:08.397 --> 02:01:09.858]  So what do we do?
[02:01:10.178 --> 02:01:12.360]  I mean, I'm a disabled veteran and I am
[02:01:13.317 --> 02:01:13.757]  Mad.
[02:01:14.137 --> 02:01:15.118]  But what can I do?
[02:01:15.278 --> 02:01:16.618]  I mean, I can yell and scream.
[02:01:17.098 --> 02:01:19.439]  But the apathy out there... Well, you can do one big thing.
[02:01:19.799 --> 02:01:25.901]  By law now, the military's in the schools recruiting, and they tell them, doesn't matter what your parents say, just sign here.
[02:01:25.921 --> 02:01:27.461]  I mean, it is sick.
[02:01:27.761 --> 02:01:30.722]  I was going to tell you to go to your recruiting centers.
[02:01:31.363 --> 02:01:33.084]  Pass out leaflets to the kids.
[02:01:33.685 --> 02:01:36.647]  Do protests in front of the recruiting centers.
[02:01:37.368 --> 02:01:38.829]  Does he lie to them, boy?
[02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:43.592]  My son, his recruiter broke six promises to him.
[02:01:44.433 --> 02:01:47.755]  The folks they admit, I've talked to recruiters, they're told to lie to you.
[02:01:48.596 --> 02:01:57.803]  And they will tell you that you're going to be a mechanic, or you're going to be a jet pilot, and you will be on the front lines paying for your food.
[02:01:58.263 --> 02:01:59.584]  I'll tell you how they're lying.
[02:01:59.604 --> 02:02:00.645]  I went to the recruiter
[02:02:01.553 --> 02:02:02.414]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:20.802]  Alright, I feel for you for losing your son, but my sons and daughters aren't going in.
[02:02:20.962 --> 02:02:22.542]  Oh no, don't let them go in.
[02:02:22.602 --> 02:02:23.522]  Don't let them go in.
[02:02:23.562 --> 02:02:24.643]  Do everything you can.
[02:02:24.783 --> 02:02:27.284]  If there's a draft, send them away.
[02:02:27.644 --> 02:02:31.185]  Alright, give us that website again real quick, Cindy.
[02:02:31.305 --> 02:02:40.228]  www.gsfp.org God bless you, my dear, and I'm sorry about the loss of your son, but you're going to save a lot of other sons and daughters by what you're doing.
[02:02:41.188 --> 02:02:41.589]  Take care.
[02:02:44.589 --> 02:02:48.916]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.096 --> 02:02:53.543]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:53.663 --> 02:02:58.069]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.109 --> 02:02:59.431]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.152 --> 02:03:00.593]  Panama!
[02:03:00.733 --> 02:03:01.614]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:14.949 --> 02:03:25.396]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:25.576 --> 02:03:30.960]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:03:46.016 --> 02:03:50.077]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.257 --> 02:03:53.138]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.218 --> 02:03:59.940]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:03.121]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:03.321 --> 02:04:05.722]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:05.842 --> 02:04:13.725]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:14.065 --> 02:04:25.333]  Lactazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:04:51.012 --> 02:04:55.653]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:04:55.873 --> 02:05:07.977]  Lack of energy, lack of strength, lack of stamina, lack of sleep, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the husband, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:05:08.237 --> 02:05:12.098]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all of these things and more.
[02:05:12.378 --> 02:05:14.660]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave patch.

[02:05:25.427 --> 02:05:27.868]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition?
[02:05:28.148 --> 02:05:29.369]  Or just trying to beat the clock?

[02:06:01.821 --> 02:06:05.984]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.765 --> 02:06:10.607]  Eight minutes, 22 seconds into the third hour.
[02:06:10.907 --> 02:06:13.989]  It is Thursday, the 17th day of February 05.
[02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:17.891]  I'm Alex Jones, your host for the second segment of this hour.
[02:06:19.542 --> 02:06:22.724]  We are joined by the editor of the Progressive Magazine.
[02:06:22.744 --> 02:06:24.766]  He's Matthew Rothschild.
[02:06:25.346 --> 02:06:43.378]  He's talking about Bush's pick of John Negroponte for National Intelligence Director, basically to control all the intelligence agencies and to make sure that, well, stuff doesn't leak out and they have little 9-11 type operations for us to give us the new draft and the next level of the police state.
[02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:48.041]  And I've read Mr. Rothschild's writings many times over the years.
[02:06:48.061 --> 02:06:48.822]  They're quite interesting.
[02:06:49.631 --> 02:06:52.553]  And it's good to have him on the air with us.
[02:06:52.833 --> 02:06:54.293]  Mr. Rothschild, thanks for coming on.
[02:06:54.834 --> 02:06:55.534]  It's my pleasure.
[02:06:55.554 --> 02:06:56.034]  Good afternoon.
[02:06:56.374 --> 02:06:56.674]  You bet.
[02:06:56.875 --> 02:07:01.637]  Tell us about yourself and your magazine and then let's get into
[02:07:02.466 --> 02:07:08.190]  Negroponte, I mean, it looks like to be in the administration you've got to have credentials in death squads and torture.
[02:07:08.811 --> 02:07:12.294]  Yeah, that seems to be a prerequisite and this guy really has got dirty hands.
[02:07:12.374 --> 02:07:15.476]  I mean, Negroponte was involved as U.S.
[02:07:15.536 --> 02:07:24.783]  Ambassador in Honduras in the early 1980s with approving or condoning the torture that the Honduran government was doing there.
[02:07:24.843 --> 02:07:29.427]  There was a battalion called Battalion 316 that the Honduran government
[02:07:30.007 --> 02:07:30.508]  I think?
[02:07:47.338 --> 02:07:47.538]  Sure.
[02:07:47.578 --> 02:07:49.800]  I've been at the Progressive here for 23 years.
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:53.942]  The Progressive Magazine was founded in 1909 by Fighting Bob La Follette, one of the original progressives.
[02:08:07.951 --> 02:08:16.317]  And we've been ever since trying to put forward these ideas of civil rights and civil liberties and non-violence and an opposition to U.S.
[02:08:16.717 --> 02:08:19.920]  adventurism overseas and a control on corporate power.
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:23.002]  Those are the pillars of progressivism as we see it.
[02:08:23.142 --> 02:08:24.683]  And so we're a monthly magazine.
[02:08:24.703 --> 02:08:26.484]  We're on the web at progressive.org.
[02:08:26.524 --> 02:08:29.046]  We've got about 65,000 subscribers around the country.
[02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:39.795]  Well, before we get into Negroponte and I Love Torture Gonzales and Bushes Above the Law Gonzales and just this whole gaggle of creatures, I've always been curious about that.
[02:08:40.735 --> 02:08:44.137]  So you're related to the famous European Rothschild family, or are you not?
[02:08:44.577 --> 02:08:44.977]  I'm not.
[02:08:44.997 --> 02:08:51.660]  You know, if I had a dollar every time I was asked that, maybe I would be one of those European bankers by now, but no, there's no relation.
[02:08:52.290 --> 02:08:57.434]  Well, because I'm wondering, because that family had another name and they changed it, you know, Red Shield in German Rothschild.
[02:08:57.455 --> 02:08:59.756]  So I guess other people took the name Red Shield?
[02:09:00.917 --> 02:09:07.083]  Mostly it was just, you know, it is a German name and it's a big family in Europe was involved in banking and then in wine business.
[02:09:07.183 --> 02:09:09.745]  But yeah, Rothschild in German means Red Shield.
[02:09:10.226 --> 02:09:17.452]  But it's always been Rothschild for my family, which came over in 1848 when a lot of Jews left Germany because of programs over there.
[02:09:17.652 --> 02:09:18.713]  So we've been here ever since.
[02:09:19.395 --> 02:09:23.917]  I was just curious because we love to get somebody from N.M.
[02:09:23.997 --> 02:09:24.937]  Rothschild on.
[02:09:25.598 --> 02:09:29.459]  It seems like some of the Rothschilds in Europe are involved in some of this globalism as well.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:32.461]  Well, I don't know exactly what you're referring to, but...
[02:09:33.971 --> 02:09:35.612]  I've got no connection with European rock charts.
[02:09:35.632 --> 02:09:37.673]  Necroponte, what you just said about him is the lightest stuff.
[02:09:37.733 --> 02:09:39.173]  This guy has been involved in so much dirt.
[02:09:55.661 --> 02:10:00.642]  And Bush is really openly saying he's above the law and building a scary mechanism.
[02:10:00.662 --> 02:10:07.424]  They're sending Homeland Security out to toy stores to harass people over copyright infringement or trademark infringement.
[02:10:07.464 --> 02:10:10.245]  They're arresting veterans that complain too much.
[02:10:10.345 --> 02:10:15.386]  I mean, it's like they're building some type of cross between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany.
[02:10:15.406 --> 02:10:18.607]  I'm not just worried about foreign countries being under all this.
[02:10:18.647 --> 02:10:19.487]  I'm worried about America.
[02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:24.191]  Well, you've got to be worried about our civil rights and civil liberties, Alex, with what's going on with the U.S.A.
[02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:27.353]  Patriot Act and with even addendums to the U.S.A.
[02:10:27.393 --> 02:10:35.156]  Patriot Act that have been passed that allow the government, essentially, to forget about the judiciary and not go and get a warrant to go search your place.
[02:10:35.176 --> 02:10:38.438]  They can write up their own warrants and go snoop on you any time they want.
[02:10:38.478 --> 02:10:40.459]  So that's a real serious issue domestically.
[02:10:40.839 --> 02:10:49.083]  Negro Poxy's got just one of the longest bloody trails of anyone in power right now, and he was a guy who in Vietnam is Henry Kissinger's deputy.
[02:10:49.683 --> 02:10:53.085]  ...was suggesting to Kissinger that the United States shouldn't make a deal.
[02:10:53.125 --> 02:10:55.207]  They shouldn't end the Vietnam War.
[02:10:55.527 --> 02:10:57.248]  That they should keep fighting the Vietnam War.
[02:10:57.288 --> 02:11:05.053]  I don't know how long he wanted to keep fighting the Vietnam War, but he was to the right of Henry Kissinger during those days, which gives you an idea about where he's coming from.
[02:11:06.374 --> 02:11:16.019]  Well, I had Selly Castillo on, who was the head DEA agent for seven years for Latin America, and he said Necroponte was involved in everything, not just death squads.
[02:11:16.059 --> 02:11:19.902]  And he said this guy was like a super gopher who was controlling everything.
[02:11:20.422 --> 02:11:27.826]  Well, he was controlling the illegal contra war for Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s as ambassador to Honduras.
[02:11:28.246 --> 02:11:37.396]  So he must have known about the Iran-Contra, the drugs-for-weapons deal, all the stuff that Oliver North was doing and a lot of other illegal activity there.
[02:11:37.796 --> 02:11:42.602]  But the thing that disturbs me most really is his just covering up for torture.
[02:11:42.962 --> 02:11:48.928]  I mean, there were people who had fled El Salvador after Archbishop Romero was killed by death squads that the U.S.
[02:11:48.969 --> 02:11:50.110]  was funding in El Salvador.
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:59.438]  And Archbishop Romero's secretary, a woman, was one of 30 women who this battalion in Honduras took up into airplanes and flew out of planes.
[02:11:59.879 --> 02:12:08.006]  And then when some American citizens, including some nuns, went down there to ask Negro Ponce what happened, he pretended he knew nothing about it.
[02:12:08.386 --> 02:12:10.067]  He lied to them, he lied to Congress.
[02:12:10.187 --> 02:12:15.468]  This guy is an operator, a very bloody operator for the U.S.
[02:12:15.588 --> 02:12:16.089]  Empire.
[02:12:16.569 --> 02:12:20.510]  And so it's a scary thing for me to believe that he's going to be head of intelligence here.
[02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:30.673]  I mean, it seems to me that the Bush administration is sending an unmistakable message to people around the world with the appointment of Gonzales and now of Negroponte that, you know, torture is in.
[02:12:31.794 --> 02:12:32.434]  Well, you were
[02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:38.655]  You know, talking about how he's this bloody operator, but then you mention U.S.
[02:12:38.775 --> 02:12:39.175]  Empire.
[02:12:39.195 --> 02:12:39.976]  I mean, to say U.S.
[02:12:40.056 --> 02:12:49.343]  Empire, it's a global corporate empire that sees America as using us as an engine of domination for the planet, a huge battering ram.
[02:12:49.843 --> 02:12:54.006]  But, I mean, I find the left, I don't believe in the left and right, it's all a false paradigm.
[02:12:54.907 --> 02:12:59.628]  I mean, the Democrats are basically voting as much as the Republicans are for all this police, state, and war.
[02:12:59.708 --> 02:13:01.308]  And Clinton did all the same stuff.
[02:13:01.689 --> 02:13:03.089]  And Clinton supports this war.
[02:13:03.829 --> 02:13:05.409]  Hillary, all of them.
[02:13:05.989 --> 02:13:07.030]  So I think to say U.S.
[02:13:07.110 --> 02:13:11.211]  Empire kind of psychologically draws these lines and people go, yeah, I'm for America!
[02:13:11.231 --> 02:13:12.951]  You know, shut up, Rothschild!
[02:13:13.531 --> 02:13:15.932]  Well, I do hear that, Alex.
[02:13:15.992 --> 02:13:17.072]  I get that on the web, too.
[02:13:17.552 --> 02:13:19.755]  But I do think the United States is an empire.
[02:13:20.155 --> 02:13:25.501]  I do think it is useful to continue to talk in terms of right and left sometimes.
[02:13:25.561 --> 02:13:33.750]  I think more Democrats and certainly more progressives are opposed to this war in Iraq, though there is some support for getting out of the war on the right as well.
[02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:41.816]  And I think we need to recognize that we're no longer really a functioning democracy here because the interests of the U.S.
[02:13:41.976 --> 02:13:49.461]  corporate elite and also the interests of the people like Negroponte and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld who run U.S.
[02:13:49.522 --> 02:13:55.326]  foreign policy is antithetical to the interests of most of the people in this country.
[02:13:56.269 --> 02:13:58.671]  I mean, and our founders would be aghast at war and empire.
[02:13:58.811 --> 02:14:00.032]  Well, let's talk about the press.
[02:14:00.072 --> 02:14:04.795]  I'm sure you know that Tony Blakely a few weeks ago called for grabbing Seymour Hersh and having him executed.
[02:14:04.815 --> 02:14:05.836]  Oh, that's lovely.
[02:14:06.516 --> 02:14:12.040]  Yeah, people like Michael Weiner-Savage called for putting people who disagree with the government in forced labor camps.
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:14.962]  Michelle Malkin writes the book, The Case for Internment Camps.
[02:14:16.443 --> 02:14:22.464]  Everywhere, I mean, really, this is like a Twilight Zone episode, Matthew.
[02:14:23.084 --> 02:14:27.645]  And you've been the editor of this major magazine for several decades.
[02:14:27.665 --> 02:14:29.166]  You've been watching this.
[02:14:29.746 --> 02:14:31.646]  I want to look into your crystal ball.
[02:14:32.126 --> 02:14:34.207]  From your experience, I want your predictions.
[02:14:34.267 --> 02:14:37.947]  This is why I ask everybody who comes on this broadcast about these subjects.
[02:14:38.267 --> 02:14:40.528]  What do you see happening in the next four years?
[02:14:41.188 --> 02:14:49.952]  Well, you know what scares me the most, Alex, is the possibility that the United States is attacked again by terrorists, this time with a chemical or biological weapon.
[02:14:50.012 --> 02:15:00.176]  And if the United States is attacked again, I think, if Katie barred the door, I think the Bush administration will go attack just about every country that Bush doesn't like.
[02:15:00.336 --> 02:15:01.237]  Maybe Iceland!
[02:15:01.877 --> 02:15:04.818]  Well, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba... Yeah, I was being sarcastic.
[02:15:04.858 --> 02:15:08.620]  I mean, if North Korea said, we did it, I think Bush would attack Iceland.
[02:15:09.525 --> 02:15:10.185]  I don't know.
[02:15:10.325 --> 02:15:17.968]  I still think he wants to attack North Korea even though the Pentagon has done a war game on that and a million people would die in the first five days according to its own estimates.
[02:15:18.408 --> 02:15:25.670]  But I think Bush thinks he's, you know, he's got the message from God that he's got to go attack this country, that country, and the next to deliver the gift of freedom.
[02:15:26.361 --> 02:15:29.143]  And that's a very scary thing for me.
[02:15:29.183 --> 02:15:31.604]  So Bush's messianic militarism scares me.
[02:15:31.904 --> 02:15:37.908]  And the possibility, after the United States is attacked again, of the United States imposing martial law.
[02:15:37.948 --> 02:15:39.629]  And that's something you don't hear about a lot.
[02:15:39.789 --> 02:15:40.949]  That's what Tommy Frank said.
[02:15:40.970 --> 02:15:41.630]  Yeah, Frank said it.
[02:15:41.650 --> 02:15:46.933]  But not only that, there's another senior administration official at the Pondlevick office who used the exact phrase.
[02:15:47.313 --> 02:15:56.281]  And that was Wayne Downing, one of Condoleezza Rice's deputies, who said, if we're attacked again, this time with weapons of mass destruction, we're going to have to declare martial law.
[02:15:56.301 --> 02:15:58.422]  Well, that's what Eberhardt said, too.
[02:15:59.283 --> 02:16:02.486]  And I was on a panel with a U.S.
[02:16:02.526 --> 02:16:09.712]  attorney, the head of counterterrorism in Wisconsin, when I was talking to some University of Wisconsin-Green Bay about this.
[02:16:10.072 --> 02:16:16.675]  And I mentioned this fear, and I thought he was going to say, oh, that crazy Rothschild from that crazy left-wing magazine, The Progressive, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[02:16:17.115 --> 02:16:19.276]  Declaring martial law would be the last thing we'd ever do.
[02:16:19.936 --> 02:16:21.497]  No, he said, we've got to really consider this.
[02:16:21.677 --> 02:16:22.777]  This is something we've got to get on the table.
[02:16:22.797 --> 02:16:35.962]  Well, there was a Gannett News Service article in 2003 where they said, we're going to lock down the schools, take your children, take them to FEMA camps, under a code red, you have no rights, it will be martial law, we'll be formed into work brigades.
[02:16:36.523 --> 02:16:39.664]  I mean, this is their cover for total dictatorship.
[02:16:40.493 --> 02:16:52.383]  Well, I don't think it would come to that, but I do think they've got plans underway on the shelves that they could, you know, bring out just as they brought out plans after September 11th to ram the Patriot Act down our throats to really curtail our freedoms.
[02:16:52.444 --> 02:16:57.388]  Wayne Downing, Condoleezza Rice's deputy at the National Security Council, was saying we're going to have to have
[02:16:57.848 --> 02:16:59.669]  The Army be able to arrest people.
[02:17:00.009 --> 02:17:06.832]  Well, to show my ignorance here, I've seen a dozen other officials say this, but I wasn't aware of Wayne Downing saying that.
[02:17:06.852 --> 02:17:11.114]  Can you give me maybe the headline for an article so I can Google that and get it posted?
[02:17:11.395 --> 02:17:18.578]  Yeah, I mean, you can just Google it, Wayne Downing and martial law, and I think in Washington Post it will come up.
[02:17:19.078 --> 02:17:20.459]  I believe it was in December of 2002.
[02:17:20.639 --> 02:17:23.280]  Oh, man.
[02:17:24.081 --> 02:17:26.842]  They're just slobbering, foaming at the mouth for this.
[02:17:27.768 --> 02:17:36.672]  Yeah, I mean, this is the most anti-democratic administration maybe ever, certainly since the days of Richard Nixon running around drunk in the White House.
[02:17:38.033 --> 02:17:40.434]  Oh, Richard Nixon was an angel compared to these people.
[02:17:41.136 --> 02:17:41.797]  I don't know.
[02:17:41.817 --> 02:17:42.937]  He wanted to bomb the brookies.
[02:17:43.418 --> 02:17:44.398]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:03.431 --> 02:18:06.533]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[02:18:48.222 --> 02:18:51.005]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:18:51.145 --> 02:18:56.831]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:57.792 --> 02:19:02.737]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:03.819 --> 02:19:05.620]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:06.021 --> 02:19:06.802]  There may be more.

[02:20:45.302 --> 02:20:46.443]  All water isn't the same.
[02:20:46.723 --> 02:20:51.708]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:51.968 --> 02:20:54.591]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:54.791 --> 02:21:03.319]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:21:03.699 --> 02:21:12.141]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[02:21:48.274 --> 02:21:50.776]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:21:51.256 --> 02:21:55.819]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.239 --> 02:22:05.465]  Alright, we're talking to Matthew Rothschild, editor of the Progressive Magazine on Bush's pick of Negroponte for National Intelligence Director.
[02:22:05.765 --> 02:22:09.527]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to be taking your calls, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-255-99231.
[02:22:12.889 --> 02:22:19.133]  You mentioned another Bush administration official, Rice's deputy, who talked about martial law that I wasn't aware of.
[02:22:19.193 --> 02:22:25.917]  I was aware of Eberhardt and Franks and a bunch of others, but tell us about this other individual.
[02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:27.198]  You actually pulled that article out.
[02:22:27.578 --> 02:22:29.699]  Yeah, I grabbed it here in my little file.
[02:22:30.019 --> 02:22:33.141]  This is an article from the Washington Post dated Tuesday, December 24th.
[02:22:33.381 --> 02:22:36.523]  It started on the front with the title, In U.S.
[02:22:36.583 --> 02:22:41.566]  Terrorism's Peril Undiminished, and it goes on then for about
[02:22:42.466 --> 02:22:48.208]  50 paragraphs and about paragraph 37 which gives you an idea about the Washington Post really putting the important stuff at the top.
[02:22:48.648 --> 02:22:53.530]  Here is Wayne Downing, Condoleezza Rice's deputy, now retired.
[02:22:53.930 --> 02:23:03.073]  The United States may have to declare martial law someday, Downing said, in the case of a devastating attack with weapons of mass destruction causing tens of thousands of casualties.
[02:23:03.473 --> 02:23:10.875]  This could mean that the military would be given the authority to impose curfews, protect businesses and communities, even make arrests, unquote.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:22.162]  And so during the fog of all this, they can run around and arrest the dissidents and do whatever they want, and meanwhile rob pension funds and run their scams while the smoke screen's going.
[02:23:22.622 --> 02:23:24.382]  Yeah, they can just get away with doing that thing.
[02:23:24.422 --> 02:23:26.122]  I mean, they can just suspend the Constitution.
[02:23:26.443 --> 02:23:29.203]  That's what Tommy Franks was talking about, and he was regretting that.
[02:23:29.463 --> 02:23:31.483]  He saw it coming and said, this is going to be bad.
[02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.824]  He and Wayne Downing is almost celebrating it.
[02:23:34.024 --> 02:23:39.985]  Well, he was putting it in prose of, it's real sad, but this is what's going to happen and what the people want.
[02:23:40.545 --> 02:23:41.666]  Yeah, he was blaming the people.
[02:23:41.686 --> 02:23:42.627]  You're absolutely right.
[02:23:42.667 --> 02:23:45.129]  When it's not the people who's going to impose martial law, come on.
[02:23:45.269 --> 02:23:47.631]  Well, number one, martial law doesn't keep us safe.
[02:23:48.392 --> 02:23:50.514]  Martial law is... Again, we've got...
[02:23:51.661 --> 02:23:56.323]  The CBS News reported that $2.4 trillion is missing from the Pentagon in the last decade.
[02:23:57.404 --> 02:23:59.004]  And that number has doubled.
[02:23:59.044 --> 02:24:02.046]  It was only $1.2 trillion under Clinton, which is bad enough.
[02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:05.607]  Now it's another $1.2 trillion just while Bush has been in.
[02:24:05.647 --> 02:24:08.889]  This is mad, insane stealing and looting.
[02:24:10.109 --> 02:24:14.011]  Yeah, you know, they're just getting away with everything hand over fist here.
[02:24:14.986 --> 02:24:20.029]  You know, again, I just don't think the American people are going to go for this if they knew it was going to happen.
[02:24:20.249 --> 02:24:42.721]  And at some point, I'm hoping that a majority of Americans are going to rise up and say, no, I'm delighted that about 350 towns and cities and counties around the country, people have gotten together and passed ordinances and resolutions saying that they're not going to cooperate and their local police aren't going to cooperate with the federal government when it comes knocking with the USA Patriot Act.
[02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:52.424]  And so I think there's a rebellion, both on the left and on the right, against this USA Patriot Act and this invasion of our rights and liberties.
[02:24:53.264 --> 02:24:56.465]  Well, it's over 400 cities and 4 states now.
[02:24:57.025 --> 02:25:00.307]  Yeah, I think the states are Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, and Maine.
[02:25:00.587 --> 02:25:06.729]  Yeah, but now I've noticed, since it went over about 200 cities, now you never see it in the news anymore.
[02:25:07.857 --> 02:25:09.778]  This has been a totally undercover story.
[02:25:10.198 --> 02:25:13.999]  I mean, this has been happening now ever since the Patriot came down.
[02:25:14.019 --> 02:25:18.641]  I think it started in Northampton, Massachusetts, and it's hardly getting any national coverage.
[02:25:18.801 --> 02:25:21.923]  Well, I was there and led the fight here in Austin and got it thrown out.
[02:25:23.563 --> 02:25:30.086]  But since then, I mean, I hear about towns and cities doing it and the news just, you know, national coverage doesn't pick it up.
[02:25:30.286 --> 02:25:32.907]  In Chicago, I think it was unanimous by the city council.
[02:25:32.967 --> 02:25:35.648]  I mean, it's not just places like Madison, Wisconsin and Austin, Texas.
[02:25:37.572 --> 02:25:39.173]  And it's a lot of conservative cities.
[02:25:39.973 --> 02:25:40.513]  Absolutely.
[02:25:40.553 --> 02:25:42.814]  A lot of the conservatives out West, they don't want the police.
[02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:46.776]  You know, the Patriot Act that Bush just yesterday said, we've got to renew the Patriot Act.
[02:25:46.816 --> 02:25:48.157]  That means expand, by the way.
[02:25:48.437 --> 02:25:57.161]  Yeah, and the Patriot Act means the police can come into your house when you're not there, go through all your files, get on the computer, put a recording device on your computer, and then leave and never tell you about it.
[02:25:57.721 --> 02:26:00.102]  I mean, do people really want the police to be able to do that?
[02:26:00.242 --> 02:26:01.043]  Without warrants.
[02:26:01.063 --> 02:26:03.864]  It's like these big regional rubber stamp warrants.
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:11.408]  Well this is what Martin Luther King under the Patriot Act would be considered domestic terrorist because he was violating a law
[02:26:24.944 --> 02:26:27.365]  At the same time, he was trying to change government policy.
[02:26:27.785 --> 02:26:31.126]  And that, under the Patriot Act, can be construed as intimidation.
[02:26:31.186 --> 02:26:33.146]  And if it's intimidation, then you're a terrorist.
[02:26:33.226 --> 02:26:34.126]  And that's unbelievable.
[02:26:34.146 --> 02:26:44.829]  What about these reports now where Second Amendment demonstrators or anti-war protesters stand there with a sign on a street corner, and they're getting two years in prison?
[02:26:44.869 --> 02:26:47.790]  I mean, they've been ruling this, but there's no First Amendment.
[02:26:48.527 --> 02:27:08.785]  Well, the thing that I've been following, and I think anyone who is standing on blocking traffic and engaging in civil disobedience can be dragged through the USA Patriot Act machinery and go to jail for it, but anyone who tries to protest the President is being either put into free speech zones a mile away, and some of them are getting arrested.
[02:27:08.845 --> 02:27:14.831]  I know people who've been protesting the President when he's coming through towns and they have signs up and they're arrested and held overnight.
[02:27:15.828 --> 02:27:18.410]  Well, I mean, I've got video of it on the news during the inauguration.
[02:27:18.430 --> 02:27:25.094]  They kept the protesters way far away, and if anybody got through and then pulled out a little sign, they just arrested them.
[02:27:25.335 --> 02:27:31.519]  You know, we can't have the Emperor seeing the slaves not worship his little beady-eyed twitliness.
[02:27:31.959 --> 02:27:33.020]  We'll be back with your call.
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:33.460]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.821 --> 02:27:35.762]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.222 --> 02:27:37.823]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.744 --> 02:27:41.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.493 --> 02:27:48.635]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:27:48.815 --> 02:27:51.537]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:27:51.717 --> 02:27:53.118]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:27:53.278 --> 02:28:03.204]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:28:03.404 --> 02:28:05.145]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:28:05.425 --> 02:28:09.269]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:13.994]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:28:14.154 --> 02:28:17.998]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:28:18.239 --> 02:28:24.365]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:28:24.605 --> 02:28:27.428]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:28:27.588 --> 02:28:30.911]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.

[02:28:44.762 --> 02:28:49.727]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[02:29:07.222 --> 02:29:16.589]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:16.850 --> 02:29:20.352]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:20.592 --> 02:29:27.698]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:44.770 --> 02:29:50.335]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:50.555 --> 02:29:51.616]  You use deodorant, right?
[02:29:51.836 --> 02:29:52.717]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:52.877 --> 02:29:55.479]  You obviously wear it to cover up the embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:55.719 --> 02:30:00.583]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:30:00.804 --> 02:30:01.804]  Check out this new product.
[02:30:01.985 --> 02:30:04.967]  It's called Novo and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:30:05.267 --> 02:30:09.211]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust Novo to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:30:09.531 --> 02:30:12.415]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:30:12.575 --> 02:30:18.322]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:30:18.503 --> 02:30:19.904]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[02:30:20.185 --> 02:30:20.966]  Still not convinced?

[02:30:22.227 --> 02:30:22.928]  Try No-B-O.
[02:30:23.068 --> 02:30:24.050]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:30:25.291 --> 02:30:27.652]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:30:52.554 --> 02:31:02.101]  All right, Kyle and Leon and Anthony and many others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:02.121 --> 02:31:11.387]  We're talking to the editor of the Progressive Magazine and it's done a lot of really in-depth reporting about Negroponte and others.
[02:31:11.728 --> 02:31:13.449]  He's coming back up with us here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:13.489 --> 02:31:15.010]  Before we go back to our guests and their calls,
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:18.802]  Folks, it is time for you to take action.
[02:31:19.183 --> 02:31:22.667]  And it is time for you to get involved and to expose the truth of 9-11.
[02:31:24.289 --> 02:31:26.912]  This whole police state is being built on 9-11.
[02:31:26.952 --> 02:31:27.853]  That's the pretext.
[02:31:27.933 --> 02:31:31.197]  The next terror attack will be the excuse for total martial law.
[02:31:32.401 --> 02:31:48.205]  If we do not expose who was behind 9-11, who stood to gain from it, the public officials being warned not to fly, the people being warned, the insider trading of the CIA, Bin Laden being CIA, Al Qaeda being flown out to safety by the CIA.
[02:31:48.946 --> 02:32:01.749]  If we do not expose all of this and show what really happened, then they're going to continue to orchestrate these events to bring in their new world order, their global police state.
[02:32:03.064 --> 02:32:09.106]  And 9-11 The Road to Tyranny is the premiere film that exposes the history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:32:09.926 --> 02:32:13.968]  And it goes through what they're setting up in the aftermath of 9-11 and how to stop it.
[02:32:14.908 --> 02:32:19.449]  And it's almost three hours long on DVD, two and a half hours long on VHS.
[02:32:20.330 --> 02:32:20.630]  And it's $24.95.
[02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:23.351]  You can get additional copies for $5.95.
[02:32:24.431 --> 02:32:28.712]  When you buy one copy of Road to Tyranny, each additional copy is $5.95.
[02:32:28.912 --> 02:32:30.713]  Though we can get four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[02:32:31.261 --> 02:32:37.706]  And 90% of those that see the film are waking up, are getting involved.
[02:32:37.726 --> 02:32:39.428]  So you've got a tool that will wake people up.
[02:32:39.468 --> 02:32:43.050]  And listen, I've done over 2,000 radio interviews in the last three and a half years.
[02:32:44.031 --> 02:32:45.853]  On liberal, conservative talk shows.
[02:32:46.453 --> 02:32:53.799]  And because I don't go at it from a liberal or conservative spin or label, almost every caller calls in and agrees and is waking up.
[02:32:55.186 --> 02:33:00.530]  And that's what my films do, is they expose how both parties are controlled, bought and paid for by the same people.
[02:33:00.890 --> 02:33:04.372]  But if you go on air and say, I'm a conservative and all the liberals are evil, they're not going to listen.
[02:33:04.713 --> 02:33:07.755]  You go on air and say, I'm a liberal and all the conservatives are evil, they're not going to listen.
[02:33:08.195 --> 02:33:10.977]  The key is getting back to freedom and liberty.
[02:33:11.557 --> 02:33:14.479]  And a true populist, constitutionalist view.
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:16.901]  And you're not getting that from either the left or the right.
[02:33:17.382 --> 02:33:18.843]  And that's what the people are hungry for.
[02:33:18.943 --> 02:33:19.803]  It makes sense.
[02:33:20.003 --> 02:33:21.385]  It's just common sense.
[02:33:21.805 --> 02:33:23.246]  Folks, please get Road to Tyranny.
[02:33:23.286 --> 02:33:25.027]  Please get Part 2 of that about 9-11.
[02:33:25.287 --> 02:33:26.308]  The Masters of Terror.
[02:33:26.588 --> 02:33:28.150]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:29.390]  Paul Watson's book, I printed.
[02:33:30.051 --> 02:33:32.673]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:33:33.854 --> 02:33:34.915]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:36.232 --> 02:33:44.320]  Peruse the Safe, Secure Shopping Cart, watch free clips of the films, read free chapters of the books, order them, or call toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:34:01.176]  Again, you can call and order, they'll answer your questions, 1-888-253-3139, or as I said, Infowars.com to order via the web, or PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my weekly TV show,
[02:34:01.756 --> 02:34:03.296]  that I've been doing for a decade in Austin.
[02:34:03.316 --> 02:34:04.877]  You can now watch it on the web weekly.
[02:34:05.397 --> 02:34:14.039]  My book, Paul Watson's book, dozens of other films we've been authorized to post, PrisonPlanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day.
[02:34:14.559 --> 02:34:24.981]  Going back to the editor of the Progressive Magazine, Matthew Rothschild, and before I get a bunch of calls, you heard him, no relation to the banking house Rothschild.
[02:34:26.381 --> 02:34:27.922]  I'm sure those calls are about to come up here.
[02:34:29.375 --> 02:34:35.704]  Going back to Matthew, any other key points you want to throw out there before we go to these calls?
[02:34:39.085 --> 02:34:42.028]  Bringing people's attention to the problems of our civil liberties after 9-11.
[02:34:42.088 --> 02:34:45.192]  I mean, the Bush administration has really been taking them away.
[02:34:45.212 --> 02:34:46.733]  I mean, there's the Patriot Act.
[02:34:46.773 --> 02:34:48.956]  There's these little acts that follow the Patriot Act.
[02:34:48.976 --> 02:34:55.422]  There's the 2004 Intelligence Authorization Act that allows the FBI to go to the post office and read your mail.
[02:34:55.482 --> 02:34:58.866]  They just passed the new Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing.
[02:34:59.046 --> 02:35:01.489]  They just passed a national ID card guy in December.
[02:35:02.089 --> 02:35:08.874]  Yeah, I mean, they're trying to take our rights away, and people should certainly oppose the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.
[02:35:08.894 --> 02:35:15.538]  If you do nothing else, tell your Congress people not to go for that, because that is just allowing the police into your office, into your bedroom.
[02:35:15.558 --> 02:35:18.060]  Well, I wrote the first analysis of Patriot Act 1.
[02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:18.520]  I'm not kidding.
[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:29.047]  Within days of it passing, I also wrote one of the first synopses of the Patriot 2, but in there, and I have this article still there from October 2001, folks,
[02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:39.778]  Where I show the subsection, it says the sunset is on little tertiary capillary sections of the act.
[02:35:40.099 --> 02:35:45.505]  The real tyrannical elements are not sunsetted, so that's a red herring.
[02:35:45.545 --> 02:35:49.049]  If you listen to what he says carefully, it's we need to reauthorize and expand.
[02:35:50.456 --> 02:35:51.497]  Yeah, I mean, that's what he's after.
[02:35:51.537 --> 02:35:55.919]  And the very definition of what a domestic terrorist is, that's not going to be censored.
[02:35:55.939 --> 02:35:56.819]  You're absolutely right.
[02:35:56.839 --> 02:35:59.541]  I mean, that's part of the act that isn't up for renewal.
[02:35:59.561 --> 02:36:00.942]  That's there until they repeal it.
[02:36:00.962 --> 02:36:03.483]  And I think people should demand that that be repealed.
[02:36:03.583 --> 02:36:05.464]  Because anyone who wants to protest U.S.
[02:36:05.504 --> 02:36:12.908]  policy by engaging in civil disobedience that goes all the way back to the Boston Tea Party, I mean, are we all going to be considered domestic terrorists now?
[02:36:13.388 --> 02:36:16.169]  Well, there are literally hundreds of cases.
[02:36:16.229 --> 02:36:16.890]  I lost count.
[02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:25.094]  of pot dealers, county commissioners, bid rigging, complaining, you know, copyright infringements.
[02:36:25.134 --> 02:36:27.956]  They're using the Patriot Act against everybody already!
[02:36:28.576 --> 02:36:33.019]  Yeah, they're just throwing the book at people and they're using everything they can to detain people.
[02:36:33.059 --> 02:36:39.442]  They're using the so-called material witness statute that used to be to hold people who were testifying in mob cases from fleeing.
[02:36:39.482 --> 02:36:44.245]  Then they're using that for anyone that they want to hold for whatever purposes they feel like it essentially these days.
[02:36:45.405 --> 02:36:46.186]  It's amazing.
[02:36:46.286 --> 02:36:47.687]  Kyle in California.
[02:36:47.727 --> 02:36:48.468]  Kyle, go ahead.
[02:36:48.488 --> 02:36:49.008]  You're on the air.
[02:36:50.109 --> 02:36:52.332]  Alex, thank you very much.
[02:36:52.472 --> 02:36:53.092]  You are the man.
[02:36:53.152 --> 02:36:57.096]  I just wanted to say keep yourself safe and keep yourself healthy because we're in for a long fight.
[02:36:57.937 --> 02:37:08.927]  I just wanted to lay out an invitation to Mr. Rothschild because I'm a regular KPFA listener here in the Bay Area and I vividly remember before our stage selection, the local
[02:37:09.477 --> 02:37:13.239]  I'll talk to Mr. Rothschild during the break and I'll say, you know, it's a Nazi death cult.
[02:37:13.259 --> 02:37:14.139]  He said, oh, no, no.
[02:37:32.568 --> 02:37:41.996]  Yeah, I mean, you really should look into two Skull and Bones and these 2-Lion Fool Society organizations because they really have more power than I think you know.
[02:37:42.336 --> 02:37:45.519]  Well, I mean, I just don't agree with you, Alex or Kyle, on Skull and Bones.
[02:37:45.559 --> 02:37:56.968]  I really don't think that Skull and Bones Society and the people who belong to it or have gone through it have anything really to do about power in America, who's got it, who's using it, and why they're using it.
[02:37:57.308 --> 02:38:01.231]  And I think we're missing the point when we're focusing on those kinds of things.
[02:38:01.291 --> 02:38:05.855]  I mean, the point is, you've got right now, you've got Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney.
[02:38:06.195 --> 02:38:07.556]  Those guys are running the show.
[02:38:07.576 --> 02:38:09.718]  And when Clinton was there, he was doing the bidding of U.S.
[02:38:09.758 --> 02:38:10.559]  corporations, too.
[02:38:10.599 --> 02:38:12.820]  We've got to see who's got the power and why they're using it.
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:14.502]  It's not because they went through skull and bones.
[02:38:14.582 --> 02:38:17.964]  It's because they're going to make money by letting the U.S.
[02:38:18.004 --> 02:38:22.628]  military open up more markets overseas and letting the IMF and the World Bank open up those markets for them.
[02:38:23.614 --> 02:38:24.935]  I appreciate that perspective.
[02:38:24.975 --> 02:38:25.736]  I really do.
[02:38:25.816 --> 02:38:38.725]  I'm here and I see so much crossover between good guests on supposed left programs here in the Bay Area and so much identity derived from people associating themselves as progressives or lefties.
[02:38:39.026 --> 02:38:42.868]  But there are good people on both sides that get caught up in this schism.
[02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:47.953]  I just think you have an opportunity to maybe bridge that gap a little bit.
[02:38:48.214 --> 02:38:49.314]  Well, I appreciate that, Calum.
[02:38:49.335 --> 02:38:52.797]  I'm glad you've been listening to all sorts of sides, because I think that's what people should do.
[02:38:52.838 --> 02:39:00.384]  I mean, people should get out of the custom of just listening to people that they always agree with, and you know, you're living in just a little igloo then.
[02:39:00.404 --> 02:39:04.107]  You might as well, you know, sample everything that's out there and come to your own conclusions.
[02:39:04.347 --> 02:39:05.388]  Yeah, don't live in a bubble.
[02:39:05.408 --> 02:39:07.010]  Well, that's what we try to do on this broadcast.
[02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:09.952]  Let's talk to Leon in Colorado.
[02:39:09.992 --> 02:39:10.753]  Leon, go ahead.
[02:39:11.667 --> 02:39:14.948]  Yeah, I just really appreciate your program today.
[02:39:15.408 --> 02:39:22.391]  Unfortunately, I can only get about an hour of it because of the programming over here at Johnstown.
[02:39:22.531 --> 02:39:23.872]  Well, say, Lovie, what's going on?
[02:39:24.492 --> 02:39:28.614]  Well, I just have a question for your guest there.
[02:39:31.174 --> 02:39:35.256]  It's obvious to me that whenever Bush comes to our Congress, they're like my dog.
[02:39:35.576 --> 02:39:38.237]  He says, roll over, and they roll over.
[02:39:39.558 --> 02:39:39.878]  Hello?
[02:39:40.158 --> 02:39:40.278]  Yeah.
[02:39:41.993 --> 02:39:51.140]  Is there anything we can do, or what do we do, I mean, to reach these guys?
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:56.864]  I mean, they just seem to be more of a problem than anybody else.
[02:39:57.145 --> 02:39:59.606]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:39:59.667 --> 02:40:04.550]  The Founding Fathers said gridlock was good, and obstructionism was good.
[02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:08.914]  Instead, it's like they've greased the skids, and they're going wild.
[02:40:09.094 --> 02:40:10.235]  Everything is passing.
[02:40:10.675 --> 02:40:14.939]  Nothing is being... It's being resisted, but they just... I mean, it's like toll roads in Austin.
[02:40:14.979 --> 02:40:16.280]  Ninety-plus percent are against it.
[02:40:16.561 --> 02:40:21.245]  We've caught all the fraud and bribery, but they just go, we're doing it because private corporations want to tax the roads.
[02:40:21.285 --> 02:40:25.509]  It's just a raping, looting, wild orgy of corruption.
[02:40:25.669 --> 02:40:26.370]  Matthew, comments?
[02:40:27.130 --> 02:40:33.877]  Well, I think people need to pressure their legislators and tell them if they don't stand up and stand up for the people's good, that they're going to not get their vote.
[02:40:33.957 --> 02:40:34.457]  And they do.
[02:40:34.497 --> 02:40:37.580]  The one thing politicians look at is their possibility of getting re-elected.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:39.642]  That's the only pressure you have on them.
[02:40:39.923 --> 02:40:43.106]  I mean, I do think some of these lopsided votes, you've just got to scratch your head.
[02:40:43.126 --> 02:40:44.927]  I mean, the Patriot Act passed the U.S.
[02:40:44.987 --> 02:40:45.948]  Senate 98-1.
[02:40:46.329 --> 02:40:49.271]  Russ Feingold was the only senator, my senator from Wisconsin.
[02:40:50.032 --> 02:40:50.693]  What is it with Congress?
[02:40:50.733 --> 02:40:51.313]  That's what I'm asking.
[02:40:51.413 --> 02:40:52.334]  Are they just sitting there?
[02:41:07.478 --> 02:41:09.279]  Totally scared to death?
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.300]  I'll tell you what it is.
[02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:13.243]  A lot of them have got a mistress and they've got photos of that.
[02:41:13.323 --> 02:41:16.645]  A lot of them are put there by corporations that are paying for them to do it.
[02:41:17.146 --> 02:41:18.487]  And a lot of them are just lazy.
[02:41:18.567 --> 02:41:19.908]  I mean, it's just they're a bunch of crooks.
[02:41:20.648 --> 02:41:22.370]  And a lot of them are scared of Bush and Rove.
[02:41:23.471 --> 02:41:25.032]  Yeah, they don't want to get an anthrax letter.
[02:41:28.855 --> 02:41:31.757]  Well, I know our congressman, he changed his tune.
[02:41:31.777 --> 02:41:32.758]  He didn't vote for the last
[02:41:33.416 --> 02:41:39.580]  Last one of these things, and I know that he was getting a lot of pressure because... Well, here's an example.
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:46.664]  G. Gordon Liddy and Dr. Laura came out against the new Freedom Force psychological testing, and they got millions of phone calls.
[02:41:47.164 --> 02:41:47.384]  Right.
[02:41:47.545 --> 02:41:49.426]  And then they fired G. Gordon Liddy.
[02:41:50.466 --> 02:41:56.210]  I mean, literally, either you tow absolute Bush worship line, or you are gone.
[02:41:57.270 --> 02:41:59.392]  And I've talked to people in this industry.
[02:41:59.452 --> 02:42:01.393]  I mean, that is how it is unless you're on this network.
[02:42:02.119 --> 02:42:08.604]  Well, I can't even stand to listen to him talk or see his face anymore, so I guess I really have a hard time hearing anything he says.
[02:42:08.624 --> 02:42:14.468]  Well, look, Air America isn't going to help anybody because they're only giving you the left-wing view and not talking about how corrupt their party is.
[02:42:15.129 --> 02:42:16.150]  You see, that's the problem.
[02:42:17.290 --> 02:42:19.912]  Everybody's blind to, like, one side of the paradigm.
[02:42:20.093 --> 02:42:21.474]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:42:21.594 --> 02:42:27.778]  And, you know, I got your film here and I'm going to be watching it.
[02:42:30.532 --> 02:42:31.252]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:31.272 --> 02:42:35.214]  It isn't a right-left, it isn't a Democrat, it isn't a Republican.
[02:42:35.234 --> 02:42:38.536]  And this is the only way I've ever reached anybody to say, whoa!
[02:42:39.397 --> 02:42:41.698]  That has nothing to do with whether I'm a Republican.
[02:42:41.738 --> 02:42:43.739]  I didn't think of the word populist.
[02:42:43.799 --> 02:42:46.640]  I said, I'm just an American that believes in a constitutional republic.
[02:42:47.281 --> 02:42:48.221]  Well, it's like this.
[02:42:48.241 --> 02:42:50.382]  You have to talk to these people like they're children.
[02:42:50.803 --> 02:42:54.605]  I've had arguments throughout my life that professional wrestling isn't real.
[02:42:54.625 --> 02:42:57.206]  If you say, I don't like Hulk Hogan,
[02:42:57.975 --> 02:42:59.678]  Then they go, don't talk bad about my hero.
[02:42:59.718 --> 02:43:01.461]  You have to explain, no, no, no, it isn't real.
[02:43:01.541 --> 02:43:04.025]  They're not really having a fight out there.
[02:43:04.045 --> 02:43:07.110]  You know, if you beat someone over the head with a chair 15 times, they die.
[02:43:08.587 --> 02:43:16.831]  Well, I think you can talk to people where they are, and I think no matter where you are on the perspective of politics, whether you're a libertarian, right-wing, republican, left-wing democrat, wherever you identify,
[02:43:29.936 --> 02:43:38.104]  Not many people in this country want corporations to run their lives, and not many people in this country want the police to be able to come into their home when they're not there.
[02:43:38.124 --> 02:43:40.487]  I mean, that's a huge violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:43:40.807 --> 02:43:48.995]  And I think once we can address people where they are and find some points of agreement and then open their eyes to what this government is doing, we can start
[02:43:49.648 --> 02:43:55.671]  Building a movement here that will oppose any more of this retrenchment against our rights and maybe get some of these rights back.
[02:43:55.691 --> 02:43:56.592]  That's what we need to do.
[02:43:56.672 --> 02:43:57.752]  Well, here's another example.
[02:43:57.832 --> 02:43:59.413]  Major polls in California.
[02:43:59.513 --> 02:44:07.858]  Ninety-five percent, excuse me, ninety-four percent of Californians were against these satellite tracker boxes Schwarzenegger wants to put in the car to tax and trace.
[02:44:07.918 --> 02:44:10.839]  But then, you talk to liberal academics, they're all for it.
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:17.223]  So how do we, on a hundred different issues, have ninety-plus percent of people against it
[02:44:18.021 --> 02:44:22.172]  And it's common sense, but still the Republican and Democrat leadership is all for it.
[02:44:22.797 --> 02:44:32.140]  Well, I think one of the big things we need to do to change this country is get full campaign financing so that the corporations and the wealthiest people in this country aren't buying Congress.
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:33.541]  And that's what's been happening.
[02:44:33.581 --> 02:44:36.281]  The lobbyists, you know, go in and cash in the investments.
[02:44:36.342 --> 02:44:41.483]  And so you get the laws the lobbyists want, the corporate interests want, and you don't get the laws that the people need.
[02:44:41.683 --> 02:44:49.726]  Well, you're an editor of a major, you know, established, almost hundred-year magazine, and you've been there for decades, so I want to get your take on this.
[02:44:50.286 --> 02:44:54.068]  We're now learning that there's all these paid-for, White House paid-for fake reporters.
[02:44:54.828 --> 02:44:57.929]  You know, the Armstrong Williams is the tip of the iceberg, as he said.
[02:44:58.249 --> 02:44:59.430]  I've been talking about this for years.
[02:44:59.550 --> 02:45:00.410]  It's massive.
[02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:09.753]  We've got propaganda placement, not product, but propaganda placement where the government is paying for fake newscasts, 76 million of it, last year alone for the Medicare package.
[02:45:10.314 --> 02:45:13.155]  I mean, I don't think people realize just how staged it is.
[02:45:13.195 --> 02:45:13.975]  Your comments on that?
[02:45:14.395 --> 02:45:15.476]  Well, that's a huge problem.
[02:45:15.516 --> 02:45:20.120]  I mean, the mainstream media is just regurgitating some of this propaganda from the administration.
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:21.641]  It is illegal propaganda.
[02:45:21.982 --> 02:45:32.110]  The government is not supposed to have people on their staffs paid to indoctrinate the American people and not telling them where this indoctrination is coming from or that it's associated with the administration.
[02:45:32.431 --> 02:45:35.033]  This is happening in one department after the next department.
[02:45:35.433 --> 02:45:35.613]  And now?
[02:45:52.210 --> 02:46:03.020]  We're going to have this Pentagon channel where they're going to spend, they're saying, hundreds of millions of dollars a year to produce high-quality news pieces that aren't even identified in their... I've now heard they're going to offer that free.
[02:46:03.321 --> 02:46:06.183]  People will save money using it, but they have to air it intact.
[02:46:06.744 --> 02:46:07.605]  This is incredible!
[02:46:07.845 --> 02:46:10.107]  Yeah, I mean, that's not what we pay taxes for.
[02:46:10.147 --> 02:46:11.408]  That's not what our government is for.
[02:46:11.428 --> 02:46:12.930]  Not to indoctrinate us.
[02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:16.453]  It's supposed to enact laws that can, you know, help us out.
[02:46:17.302 --> 02:46:19.283]  Well, our constitutional republic cannot survive this.
[02:46:19.523 --> 02:46:21.823]  I would call it, I think there's a book along these lines, imperial hubris.
[02:46:21.843 --> 02:46:22.984]  I mean, this is hubris.
[02:46:38.328 --> 02:46:41.250]  It definitely is hubris, and it may get the better of him at some point.
[02:46:41.290 --> 02:46:43.071]  I mean, Bush is overreaching.
[02:46:43.111 --> 02:46:44.652]  He's overreaching with Social Security.
[02:46:44.952 --> 02:46:46.193]  He's overreached in Iraq.
[02:46:46.233 --> 02:46:48.674]  He may overreach in Iran or Syria, North Korea.
[02:46:48.994 --> 02:46:51.015]  And at some point... That's a good question.
[02:46:51.136 --> 02:46:51.876]  That's a good question.
[02:46:52.136 --> 02:46:54.437]  The Pentagon told him we would lose unless we had 400,000 troops.
[02:46:55.698 --> 02:47:00.662]  They knew this, but they still just don't care, and the military is literally folding right now.
[02:47:01.043 --> 02:47:03.585]  Well, the brass Tommy Franks rolled over for Rumsfeld.
[02:47:03.605 --> 02:47:10.490]  Rumsfeld just beat him up and finally he said, okay, you know, we'll use 150,000 troops instead of 400,000 troops and look at the mess they made in Iraq.
[02:47:10.690 --> 02:47:14.954]  But, I mean, that's delusional, what they call, magical thinking.
[02:47:16.185 --> 02:47:23.027]  I mean, it seems like they've really gone off the deep end when their own tacticians and war game strategists tell them it isn't going to work and they just go do it.
[02:47:23.187 --> 02:47:25.648]  Well, they were eating their own propaganda, Alex.
[02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.709]  They started to believe their own stuff.
[02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:32.910]  They believed the lies of the Iraqi National Congress that they were paying for.
[02:47:33.210 --> 02:47:35.451]  They were paying this group, Ahmad Chalabi's group.
[02:47:35.911 --> 02:47:44.759]  To feed lies to the American people, and then the administration itself started to believe that they'd be showered with flowers and candy, and the whole country of Iraq would embrace them forever.
[02:47:44.799 --> 02:47:47.181]  I mean, no one who knows anything about Iraq would believe that.
[02:47:48.707 --> 02:47:52.789]  Well, I mean, they told White to take a walk, Secretary of the Army, when he said it was impossible.
[02:47:53.029 --> 02:47:54.150]  Well, that's the thing about this group.
[02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:55.030]  They were broke.
[02:47:55.171 --> 02:47:55.811]  No dissent.
[02:47:55.951 --> 02:47:58.492]  Anyone who raises a question is out the door.
[02:47:58.652 --> 02:48:00.994]  I mean, Colin Powell said he wanted to stay another year.
[02:48:01.314 --> 02:48:01.694]  Forget it.
[02:48:01.734 --> 02:48:02.214]  He's gone.
[02:48:02.254 --> 02:48:11.639]  But the people there who created this problem, you know, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, and who were involved in this torture policy, especially Rumsfeld and Gonzalez, you know, they're around.
[02:48:11.659 --> 02:48:12.320]  They're still there.
[02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:13.500]  And Negroponte.
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:14.701]  They're all shooting to the top.
[02:48:14.861 --> 02:48:19.084]  Yeah, now Negro Posse gets, you know, this huge position and he's got blood on his hands.
[02:48:21.006 --> 02:48:21.806]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:21.886 --> 02:48:23.007]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:23.107 --> 02:48:25.409]  Anthony in New York and others, your calls are up next.
[02:48:26.089 --> 02:48:28.892]  Talking to the editor of the Progressive Magazine.
[02:48:30.393 --> 02:48:31.834]  Just blows my mind.
[02:48:32.794 --> 02:48:36.197]  Folks, these people are taking us straight towards an iceberg.
[02:48:36.717 --> 02:48:38.759]  They're just laughing and fiddling on the deck.
[02:48:39.079 --> 02:48:39.760]  They love it.
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:41.401]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:44.392 --> 02:48:51.237]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:51.537 --> 02:48:52.938]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.119 --> 02:48:55.320]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:57.562]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:57.842 --> 02:49:02.786]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.106 --> 02:49:07.149]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:07.389 --> 02:49:09.151]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:09.231 --> 02:49:19.883]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.043 --> 02:49:21.926]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:53.645 --> 02:51:56.665]  Final segment, let's take just two final calls for our guest.
[02:51:57.205 --> 02:51:58.806]  Anthony in New York, go ahead.
[02:51:58.826 --> 02:51:59.906]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:52:00.106 --> 02:52:00.446]  Good, sir.
[02:52:00.466 --> 02:52:02.767]  Alright, I just got out of military prison.
[02:52:02.867 --> 02:52:11.629]  I was stationed at Fort Drum, New York, and I got sent to Afghanistan, and I was there for a couple months, and I got a Red Cross message that my mom had cancer.
[02:52:12.250 --> 02:52:13.350]  So I came back on leave,
[02:52:13.962 --> 02:52:19.427]  And they gave me like 30 days of leave, and she was on hospice, like where they come to take care of you at home or whatever.
[02:52:20.027 --> 02:52:42.906]  And my leave wasn't up, and she was still alive, and I was the only one to take care of her, so I called back to try to get an extension on my leave, and they told me no, that I needed to come back, and so I stayed with her until she died, and my stepdad got sick, and I stayed with him until he died too, which was like, it was a total of 5 months that I was gone, and I got sentenced to 5 months in military prison.
[02:52:43.391 --> 02:52:46.777]  And I'd say like plastered me all over the newspapers around my town like...
[02:52:47.225 --> 02:52:49.186]  Made me look like a real scum.
[02:52:49.206 --> 02:52:50.946]  They said I was a deserter.
[02:52:51.346 --> 02:52:52.486]  Which I never deserted.
[02:52:53.287 --> 02:52:57.428]  I was in prison with guys that had been absent without leave like seven years.
[02:52:57.808 --> 02:52:58.908]  And got lesser sentences.
[02:52:58.948 --> 02:53:02.289]  Well, they just selectively enforce all of that.
[02:53:02.349 --> 02:53:04.530]  I mean, we've talked to troops who are in Iraq.
[02:53:04.570 --> 02:53:06.710]  It's been in the news where they have to pay for their own food.
[02:53:06.971 --> 02:53:10.011]  When their arms and legs get blown off, they discharge them in Rammstein.
[02:53:10.331 --> 02:53:11.912]  Make them pay to fly home.
[02:53:12.492 --> 02:53:13.292]  Have you heard about that?
[02:53:13.552 --> 02:53:14.713]  Yes, and it's ridiculous.
[02:53:14.933 --> 02:53:15.353]  Ridiculous.
[02:53:16.053 --> 02:53:22.797]  They try to paint this picture that when you join the military they'll take care of you no matter what happens and it's definitely not true at all.
[02:53:23.998 --> 02:53:25.479]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[02:53:25.519 --> 02:53:26.620]  Sorry to hear that happen.
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:28.621]  And now I guess you can't own a gun or anything.
[02:53:28.641 --> 02:53:30.782]  You're dishonorably discharged I guess.
[02:53:31.623 --> 02:53:33.264]  Comments to what he was saying, Matthew?
[02:53:33.664 --> 02:53:34.865]  Well, the treatment of our troops.
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:39.724]  Generally, it's just deplorable and the health care they get when they come back is deplorable.
[02:53:40.124 --> 02:53:45.388]  And also, the unpopularity of this Iraq War wasn't true of Anthony, but it's true of a lot of soldiers.
[02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:48.231]  According to the Pentagon itself, there are 5,500 deserters.
[02:53:48.771 --> 02:53:48.992]  U.S.
[02:53:49.032 --> 02:53:52.074]  soldiers who refuse to go back and report for duty.
[02:53:52.114 --> 02:53:53.836]  That shows you what it's like to be over there.
[02:53:55.077 --> 02:53:56.598]  Let's talk to Jim in New York.
[02:53:56.658 --> 02:53:57.439]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:53:58.409 --> 02:53:59.010]  Good afternoon.
[02:53:59.230 --> 02:54:04.096]  What I want to say quickly, I tuned in and it was Mike, what's his name, the guest?
[02:54:04.396 --> 02:54:04.957]  Rothschild.
[02:54:05.337 --> 02:54:05.718]  Rothschild.
[02:54:05.758 --> 02:54:09.302]  Mr. Rothschild was talking about, and you, about skull and bones.
[02:54:09.562 --> 02:54:18.792]  And I feel it's very important, as I think you probably do, I've heard you talk before, and the reason for this is that these people,
[02:54:20.208 --> 02:54:28.233]  People wonder how it is that they can control so much and so many people, and the reason being is that a lot of these people, to my knowledge, and I've been reading this for 25 years,
[02:54:29.583 --> 02:54:32.045]  Uh, along with the Secret Societies, etc.
[02:54:32.345 --> 02:54:34.627]  A lot of them do not know what's going on at the bottom.
[02:54:34.887 --> 02:54:37.308]  You know, they just do what they're told because that's the way it's set up.
[02:54:37.849 --> 02:54:40.371]  And therefore, you can command the whole army of people.
[02:54:40.391 --> 02:54:44.433]  Well, I mean, look, the Lacoste and Nostra, the Italian Mafia, is a secret society.
[02:54:44.493 --> 02:54:44.734]  Correct.
[02:54:45.014 --> 02:54:46.995]  Intelligence agencies are secret societies.
[02:54:47.035 --> 02:54:47.175]  Right.
[02:54:47.355 --> 02:54:55.161]  A secret society was just an intelligence agency 200 years ago, and then we're supposed to deny they even exist.
[02:54:55.221 --> 02:54:56.642]  Anything to say to that, uh, Matthew?
[02:54:57.262 --> 02:55:03.386]  Well, you know, I don't think the skull and bones is anywhere near the power or the influence in this country.
[02:55:03.446 --> 02:55:08.209]  It's important even to think about it as the Cosa Nostra, as the mob, or as an intelligence agency.
[02:55:08.529 --> 02:55:10.370]  It's a little weird.
[02:55:10.410 --> 02:55:16.674]  You know, I wouldn't disagree on that, but I just don't think it has anything to do with really what's happening in this country.
[02:55:16.794 --> 02:55:21.037]  And if there weren't any skull and bones, we'd still have the exact same problems that we're having today.
[02:55:21.337 --> 02:55:25.520]  Well, that may be so, but it happens to be at this time that that's the name they choose to call themselves.
[02:55:25.540 --> 02:55:34.985]  You can call them whatever you want, but you must admit that you mentioned Cheney, Clinton, Bush, that these people all work in conjunction with each other, and they have a name.
[02:55:35.206 --> 02:55:35.666]  That's all.
[02:55:36.446 --> 02:55:37.567]  That's the only thing we're trying to say.
[02:55:37.587 --> 02:55:38.187]  They have a name.
[02:55:38.388 --> 02:55:42.110]  Not that at a given time in history it may be called something else.
[02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:45.212]  They're not following the orders of the Skull and Bones Society.
[02:55:45.232 --> 02:55:45.972]  That's not what they do.
[02:55:45.992 --> 02:55:48.013]  Well, I'll have you up for a debate about that sometimes.
[02:55:48.053 --> 02:55:50.395]  We're saying Skull and Bones is part of this tapestry.
[02:55:51.215 --> 02:55:52.516]  of this elite.
[02:55:52.996 --> 02:55:54.917]  We have an elite, don't we, Mr. Rothschild?
[02:55:54.977 --> 02:55:56.778]  We certainly do, and it's a corporate elite.
[02:55:56.798 --> 02:56:01.199]  It's the corporations and the top 1% of Americans that are running this country.
[02:56:01.239 --> 02:56:03.520]  It's not the American people, but it's not skull and bones either.
[02:56:03.901 --> 02:56:05.021]  See, I'd say one-tenth of 1%.
[02:56:05.141 --> 02:56:08.142]  We can cut it that then.
[02:56:08.543 --> 02:56:11.084]  Yeah, give folks the website for your magazine.
[02:56:11.304 --> 02:56:11.904]  Thanks very much.
[02:56:11.924 --> 02:56:13.025]  It's progressive.org.
[02:56:14.605 --> 02:56:16.847]  Alright, interesting talking to you, and take care.
[02:56:17.087 --> 02:56:17.747]  You too, bye bye.
[02:56:18.267 --> 02:56:21.369]  Alright folks, we're out of time back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:25.592]  Interesting having somebody on named Rothschild, I figured that'd make the listeners go crazy.
[02:56:26.573 --> 02:56:30.295]  But definitely a different view than what you normally get from the Rothschilds.
[02:56:31.196 --> 02:56:32.296]  Take care, PrisonPlanet.tv.
