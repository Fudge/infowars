[00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:06.238]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:07.958]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:11.259]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.860]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:30.445]  Well, I've been surprised by how slow the news has moved.
[00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.466]  Listening to broadcasts this morning,
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:46.709]  This afternoon in some time zones, most people don't even know that Jerry Schindler Schiavo died about two hours ago.
[00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.173]  In just a few hours short of 14 days.
[00:00:53.534 --> 00:01:02.761]  This afternoon it would have been 14 days since she had her feeding tube that delivered water and substance to her.
[00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.600]  And she is now dead.
[00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.622]  Quite a fighter.
[00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:16.449]  And for those that don't know, on the record, I'm going to try to go over the history, the admitted history of what happened to her.
[00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.476]  She was able to walk with assistance, able to talk, and then as soon after her collapse,
[00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:35.835]  And after she won a malpractice suit, her husband got the money, promising that it was to take care of her for the next 50 years.
[00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:38.076]  That's what the jury gave them, a million dollars.
[00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:53.146]  As soon as he got it, as soon as he got the money, he locked her in a dark room for 10 years and wouldn't let him treat her bed sores, infections, wouldn't let him brush her teeth.
[00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:55.668]  This poor woman has been tortured brutally.
[00:01:56.553 --> 00:02:00.755]  For the last 10 years, and the pain ended a couple hours ago.
[00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:03.436]  At the hands of her torturers.
[00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.516]  They finally murdered her.
[00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:08.618]  And they called it treatment!
[00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:10.658]  She was receiving her treatment.
[00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.141]  And you talk to the general public, they still don't know the details of this case.
[00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.243]  They still don't understand what happened with this tragedy.
[00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:27.786]  With this travesty of humanity and of injustice.
[00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.289]  And the globalists made this a big story.
[00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.470]  The alternative media exposed it first.
[00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.313]  I mean, we talked about this four years ago before the mainstream news ever touched it.
[00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:49.680]  And they tried to use her as a poster child of disinformation and lies, claiming she was in a vegetative state and not a poor woman locked in solitary confinement for ten years.
[00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:56.668]  They try to spin their lies and sell us on their propaganda, and we have been countering it.
[00:02:57.408 --> 00:03:03.552]  And it's been very educational for people who didn't understand the New World Order agenda for eugenics.
[00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:11.677]  Terry now is a martyr for the pro-life movement, the anti-state sponsored and controlled euthanasia movement.
[00:03:12.738 --> 00:03:19.302]  I don't have a problem with dignity and dying, and if you don't want to be resuscitated or don't want to be on life support,
[00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:21.904]  But Terry wasn't on life support, folks.
[00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:23.025]  She could eat jello.
[00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:24.826]  She could talk.
[00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:29.650]  Until they took all the support away and locked her in solitary confinement.
[00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.594]  By the way, many grown men die if they're left in solitary confinement for a year.
[00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:38.656]  You can put a grown man, muscular, healthy,
[00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:51.508]  In solitary confinement for a year and they'll start chewing holes in their flesh, they'll go crazy, they'll pull all their hair out, their hair will fall out because they don't have the vitamins that you need from sunlight.
[00:03:52.188 --> 00:04:02.318]  Michael Cockroach, Shibo, wouldn't even allow, again, the blinds to be opened for her to go outside for the last decade.
[00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:11.217]  And a lot of you out there that think not drinking water feels so good, how about you don't drink for the next three days?
[00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:13.138]  After that it could be lethal.
[00:04:13.178 --> 00:04:14.118]  I don't recommend you do.
[00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:20.760]  But just since it feels so good, I've heard you on the news and on talk radio how good it feels, don't drink for three days.
[00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.102]  And if you really are tough stuff, don't drink for five or six.
[00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:32.024]  Tell me how it feels when your mouth starts bleeding and you start having convulsions and dry heaves for 24 hours in a row.
[00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:34.065]  Do it!
[00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:34.905]  Put your
[00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:37.759]  Body where your mouth is.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:48.566]  I didn't drink for one day, and it was, uh, after about 15 hours of not drinking, it became, uh, irritating.
[00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:50.307]  Started itching.
[00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:51.307]  My mouth was dry.
[00:04:52.728 --> 00:04:54.129]  A day was enough for me.
[00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.091]  Why don't you do it for 14?
[00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.491]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:05.795]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:09.818]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:14.122]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:18.246]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:20.288]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.368 --> 00:05:23.692]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.732 --> 00:05:24.813]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:28.416]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:31.639]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:34.661]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:41.287]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:45.589]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:06.478]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:07.679]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:08.660]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.622]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:16.686]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:18.027]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:19.307]  It's called No B.O.
[00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:21.069]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:23.531]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:25.152]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:25.472]  Look.

[00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.230]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:07.831]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.711]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:11.232]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.952 --> 00:08:12.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:17.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:24.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:27.622]  We're in a culture war.
[00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:28.763]  It's true.
[00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:34.967]  But it's not so much the conservatives versus the liberals as it is
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:44.745]  The people that are informed about the New World Order and the social architects that are setting up a worldwide prison planet.
[00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:58.574]  It's between those of us that know what's going on, the mass of people that are still in the dark, though they're starting to get an inkling that there is a light at the entrance to the cave,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:07.625]  And you have the controllers who have a vested interest in keeping us in the dark and dumbing us down even further.
[00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:25.479]  Terri Schindler-Schievo, we like to call her Terri Schindler, because, well, her husband has been married to another woman common law for a decade and has had two children with her, has abandoned her.
[00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.761]  Terri died today!
[00:09:30.046 --> 00:09:33.047]  And I'm surprised by how slowly news travels.
[00:09:33.367 --> 00:09:35.588]  I'm really not hearing it discussed on talk radio.
[00:09:35.628 --> 00:09:37.748]  I'm sure soon everyone will learn of it.
[00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:41.309]  We learned of it even before the Drudge Report learned of it.
[00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:49.252]  I was sitting there reading news articles about the free trade area, the Americas, the end of U.S.
[00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:51.713]  sovereignty, mainstream news articles out of Canada.
[00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:56.054]  I was reading an article about the toll roads that go in all over the country.
[00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:07.174]  When NPR was on in the background, and they just said, this just in... So NPR, I guess, had it first, and I was listening, so I heard it.
[00:10:07.254 --> 00:10:14.177]  I was listening to the Rockefeller, Carnegie Endowment-funded propaganda machine of neoliberalism.
[00:10:15.858 --> 00:10:21.821]  And I began scanning CNN and the Associated Press, and they didn't have it for 30 minutes or so.
[00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:24.322]  We did have it, I guess, really first on the Internet.
[00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:53.924]  uh... that uh... i'm aware of at prison planet dot com but i'm shocked that hours and hours and hours later still most people are not aware that almost fourteen days she was just about three hours short of fourteen days or two full weeks of no water or food and the media the controlled media much of which the actual tactics and
[00:10:54.801 --> 00:11:08.828]  The way they frame the stories, the dominant people in the media were actually trained by CIA officers and psychiatrists and advertising pitchmen on how to brainwash the public.
[00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:14.411]  That is, most people in the media aren't being paid like Armstrong Williams.
[00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:15.852]  Thousands are, though.
[00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:23.724]  Even though there's hundreds of millions of dollars of fake newscasts that Lord Bush has paid for and hundreds of millions more he's going to pay for.
[00:11:23.744 --> 00:11:24.965]  He says he doesn't apologize.
[00:11:25.305 --> 00:11:33.651]  Bill Clinton wasn't the first to start the process of paying off the media, but he was the first to really radically expand it.
[00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:35.753]  Now Bush has dwarfed that.
[00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:40.236]  But talk about hidden in plain view.
[00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:43.659]  I'm listening to NPR and they go, the family wasn't with them.
[00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:46.102]  The family wasn't with Terri.
[00:11:46.462 --> 00:11:48.203]  They were busy doing something.
[00:11:49.103 --> 00:11:51.805]  Again, real subtle propaganda.
[00:11:52.585 --> 00:12:03.130]  The family wasn't with Terri when she died, and they were busy talking to the media when it happened, but now they're with her, praying with the body.
[00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.691]  And I thought, isn't that strange?
[00:12:05.731 --> 00:12:09.513]  They gave her last rites on Monday,
[00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:17.949]  Excuse me, Sunday night, and expected her to die Monday or Tuesday.
[00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:19.271]  Most people would.
[00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:20.232]  She was very tough.
[00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:25.920]  After a decade of abuse, vicious abuse, she'd gotten hardened in many ways.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.964]  The internal hospital term is a gomer.
[00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:38.772]  People that have had so many insults to their nervous system, most people normally die, but if you survive it, it actually strengthens you.
[00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:41.673]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:12:41.853 --> 00:12:46.816]  Very few people can survive even 10, 11 days without water, folks.
[00:12:46.856 --> 00:12:47.816]  She went almost 14.
[00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:49.137]  13 days and 9 hours.
[00:12:49.157 --> 00:12:49.737]  Unbelievable.
[00:12:57.239 --> 00:12:59.120]  But, uh, talk about hidden in plain view.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.380]  I heard that piece of propaganda.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.700]  I said, that doesn't seem right.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:19.245]  And then, in an Associated Press article that came out hours later, and a CNN article that came out hours later, hidden in plain view, and we've since confirmed this, it turns out that since yesterday, Schiavo, Michael Schiavo, would not let the family in to see her.
[00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:23.366]  Because, folks,
[00:13:24.818 --> 00:13:31.982]  The wrenching, the convulsions, this isn't something they want the family to be able to see, and then go talk to the media.
[00:13:32.522 --> 00:13:35.804]  And that's what happens in the hours before death.
[00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:48.250]  So, he's such a nice guy, folks, wouldn't let the family in to see her, and then the media spins it to where they were busy talking to the media.
[00:13:50.269 --> 00:14:05.237]  And we wrote a story yesterday, Paul Watson did, about all these sicko, leftist, pro-death blogs, making fun of her, calling her names, when is that bleeper gonna die, calling her the state vegetable of Florida.
[00:14:05.817 --> 00:14:07.918]  These are big establishment blogs.
[00:14:08.658 --> 00:14:12.660]  And it's you, I mean it's all, I mean I heard people making jokes about her in the stores.
[00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:16.702]  I was in a gas station today and somebody made a snide comment.
[00:14:16.742 --> 00:14:18.003]  I said, you know, Terry died.
[00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:22.801]  I've been out driving around doing errands, and my car ran out of gas.
[00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:23.502]  That was fun.
[00:14:24.342 --> 00:14:30.326]  Pushing it to a gas station, but... I get into the gas station, and... Oh, you know, Terry Schiavo died.
[00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:32.888]  Yeah, good, I'm sick of hearing about it.
[00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:36.970]  You know, just such a callous attitude of people.
[00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:43.995]  But, um... Just so disgusting.
[00:14:45.365 --> 00:14:46.726]  Terry Schiavo dies.
[00:14:46.826 --> 00:14:52.089]  Michael Schiavo prevents begging parents, that's a quote, from seeing her last moments.
[00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.150]  They have done it.
[00:14:55.210 --> 00:15:00.553]  They have executed someone via a war crime banned by the Geneva Convention right in front of our faces.
[00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:08.017]  Michael Schiavo can now go home to the woman he left Terry for all those years ago and marry her and go back to his children.
[00:15:08.687 --> 00:15:09.148]  I would add.
[00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:18.155]  CNN is reporting, O'Donnell, one of the family's spiritual advisors, said the parents and the siblings were begging to be at her bedside but were being denied.
[00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:26.463]  Michael Schiavo, this is the latest CNN story out, was Terry's guardian and controlled who could visit her and when.
[00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:27.003]  Close quote.
[00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:34.350]  How obvious now is this to everybody just how much of a monster Michael Schiavo is?
[00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:49.285]  Terri Schiava, the severely brain-damaged woman whose final years of tethered to a feeding tube sparked a bitter feud over the fate that divided a family and a nation died Thursday, her husband's attorney said.
[00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:56.606]  This sicko was talking about how beautiful it was as the blood dripped from her eyes and mouth.
[00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.407]  Oh, it's so beautiful!
[00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:05.688]  Yeah, Hitler thought burning cities and dead bodies was beautiful.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:08.941]  Oh boy.
[00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:13.144]  These people are taking over.
[00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:18.848]  And so the average person will never learn of this, even if they watch CNN or read the quotes.
[00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:19.969]  They'll never put two and two together.
[00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:21.630]  Hidden in plain view!
[00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.611]  What?
[00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:24.712]  He wouldn't let them in to see her?
[00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:31.877]  And he would let them see her an hour a day and they had to get that through court orders.
[00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:33.739]  They could never be alone with her.
[00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.401]  They couldn't touch her the last few years.
[00:16:38.132 --> 00:16:45.356]  And when Shaibo would come into the room, I mean there's dozens of witnesses, nurses, doctors of this, she would cry and look at him with fear and shake.
[00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:50.359]  Her family came in, she'd smile and giggle and you could just see it in her poor eyes.
[00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:54.141]  But for those that don't know, I guess I have to keep repeating this.
[00:16:55.242 --> 00:16:58.924]  I thought people would learn about this, but people still don't understand.
[00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:01.966]  She was able to walk with aid.
[00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.607]  She was able to turn her head.
[00:17:04.627 --> 00:17:07.189]  She was able to eat jello and drink water and juice.
[00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:10.503]  She could say, potty, when she used the bathroom.
[00:17:11.103 --> 00:17:14.486]  She could say, mommy, help me, when she needed help.
[00:17:15.106 --> 00:17:18.589]  Or she could say, I'm in pain, when she was in pain.
[00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.472]  She could have been rehabilitated to a great extent.
[00:17:24.533 --> 00:17:31.738]  And as soon as he went to court and he said, give me a million bucks, I need to be able to take care of her for at least 50 years.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:34.420]  This is in the civil suit.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.821]  This is in the testimony.
[00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:36.902]  This is in the agreement.
[00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.551]  This is in the findings of the jury.
[00:17:41.552 --> 00:17:45.673]  One million dollars.
[00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:49.435]  $300,000 went to him to take care of her.
[00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:52.677]  And as soon as he got the money, he acted real nice to the family.
[00:17:53.457 --> 00:17:58.019]  As soon as he got the money, he suddenly said, that's it.
[00:17:58.359 --> 00:17:59.179]  Close the blinds.
[00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.120]  Keep her in the dark.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.980]  Don't wash her.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.481]  Don't take care of her.
[00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:04.962]  And they tortured her
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:19.570]  To the point of just her limbs going into, you know, a tightened rectus, her body becoming scrofulous and flaking and abscesses, literal hell on earth.
[00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:31.459]  So, they shouldn't have just tried to get the feeding tube back in for her, for the torture to end.
[00:18:31.499 --> 00:18:33.781]  They would have to have got her and taken care of her.
[00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:47.297]  I mean, folks, if you spank your children, which by the way isn't even illegal, just can't do harm, they'll still take your children.
[00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:48.458]  No court order, no nothing.
[00:18:48.498 --> 00:18:50.339]  CPS shows up and does it all the time.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.343]  Child and adult protective agencies do this.
[00:18:58.663 --> 00:19:00.143]  If they didn't, the governor could have done it.
[00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:00.644]  He didn't.
[00:19:01.024 --> 00:19:02.945]  They use it as a political football.
[00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:13.535]  And the globalists use this to get everybody divided against each other, and it works like a charm, and we're one step closer to euthanasia in this country.
[00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:22.443]  And don't try to equate this with your father dying of cancer who's in total pain and doesn't want any food or water.
[00:19:22.503 --> 00:19:23.363]  That's their business.
[00:19:25.045 --> 00:19:26.366]  That is death with dignity.
[00:19:27.627 --> 00:19:32.271]  This is a woman who never said she wanted to be killed,
[00:19:34.204 --> 00:19:37.905]  This is a person who told one story until he got the money and then told another.
[00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:51.069]  But as usual, we've got a dumbed-down mass of people that don't know their head from a hole in the ground feeding at the trough of media lies.
[00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:53.429]  We'll take your calls when we get back.
[00:19:53.449 --> 00:19:53.649]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:55.510]  A bunch of other news as well.
[00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.030]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.982]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:20:05.283 --> 00:20:08.825]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:20:09.105 --> 00:20:17.950]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:22.233]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:26.836]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas Report, Midas Resources will pay you.
[00:20:27.396 --> 00:20:28.737]  This detailed report will provide
[00:20:28.797 --> 00:20:29.397]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.611]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:08.853]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:11.875]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:14.476]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:23.301]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.842]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:29.224]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.524 --> 00:21:29.844]  I think so.
[00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:04.187]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:10.150]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:17.875]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:18.936 --> 00:22:27.481]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:28.616 --> 00:22:36.622]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.936 --> 00:23:04.659]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:06.080]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.184]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:23:11.204 --> 00:23:14.746]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:23:14.806 --> 00:23:16.768]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:17.328]  Cardivite.
[00:23:17.348 --> 00:23:17.829]  Cardivite.
[00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:19.410]  We all use Cardivite!
[00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:23.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[00:23:40.523 --> 00:23:40.904]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:59.197 --> 00:24:11.367]  Oh, just a programming note before we go straight to your calls of your internet listeners.
[00:24:13.628 --> 00:24:17.752]  You can go to GCNlive.com and during the day from 11 to 2 Central
[00:24:18.562 --> 00:24:20.343]  I'm on all four streams.
[00:24:21.204 --> 00:24:22.024]  One through four.
[00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:27.887]  But two of those streams knock you off after 25 minutes.
[00:24:27.907 --> 00:24:29.228]  The 16-bit streams.
[00:24:29.248 --> 00:24:31.349]  The little 8-bits are unlimited.
[00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:34.271]  I know stream one isn't unlimited.
[00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.852]  And so is two.
[00:24:37.012 --> 00:24:41.615]  So if you're having trouble getting kicked off, you can just go to stream one or two.
[00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:43.196]  And then at night, I'm on streams.
[00:24:43.996 --> 00:24:44.977]  Streams of my own at night.
[00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.733]  Well, we'll tell you later.
[00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:54.437]  But let's go ahead and go to the calls again.
[00:24:54.497 --> 00:25:07.669]  Terry Schindler is dead after 10 years of solitary confinement and brutal torture, the likes of which not even our airmen who were shot down over northern Vietnam went through.
[00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.633]  They normally die after two or three years of solitary confinement.
[00:25:15.194 --> 00:25:20.055]  This is some of the most brutal forms of torture known in a dark room for 10 years.
[00:25:20.255 --> 00:25:22.636]  Imagine not a drink of water down her parched throat.
[00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:25.636]  And it's just horrible.
[00:25:26.536 --> 00:25:33.018]  And Michael Shabo, according to affidavits by a nurse that treated her for over a year and others, said, when is that bitch gonna die?
[00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:34.518]  Excuse my French.
[00:25:35.258 --> 00:25:36.578]  And she's dead now, sir.
[00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:39.899]  You can go back to your wife of 10 years and the two children you've had.
[00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:43.346]  I just hope you enjoy yourself.
[00:25:43.426 --> 00:25:44.767]  I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
[00:25:44.807 --> 00:25:45.948]  You reap what you sow.
[00:25:47.008 --> 00:25:52.131]  And I don't think anybody should do anything to Mr. Schiavo because God's going to punish him.
[00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:53.532]  He is cursed.
[00:25:54.732 --> 00:25:59.395]  I'm going to tell Schiavo right now, and I've lived long enough to know this stuff is real, folks.
[00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:01.256]  Whatever you do comes back on you.
[00:26:01.636 --> 00:26:02.977]  You are cursed, buddy.
[00:26:03.477 --> 00:26:06.338]  You're not going to have to wait until you die to go to hell to be punished.
[00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:09.260]  People like you, all of you, are cursed.
[00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.812]  And that's what the pastor told Judge Greer when he kicked him out of the church.
[00:26:15.093 --> 00:26:23.438]  He told him, he said, this is on your soul, and in your final days when you're an old man, you're going to think about what you did.
[00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:24.759]  You're going to be haunted by this.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:32.864]  So Terry's out of her pain with her creator, and Michael Shivo, that little puppet of the New World Order.
[00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:33.885]  Let's go to the call.
[00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:36.847]  Scott in Michigan, then Deborah, Lynn, George and others.
[00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:37.588]  Scott, go ahead.
[00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:39.749]  Alright, thank you Alex for having me on again.
[00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:43.608]  Unless you have, okay, it's very sad to hear that she's dead now.
[00:26:43.628 --> 00:26:46.050]  I mean, it's pretty much torture that her husband was doing to her.
[00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.311]  Really bad torture.
[00:26:47.331 --> 00:26:49.773]  It's not pretty much, it is brutal torture.
[00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:50.994]  Yeah, really brutal.
[00:26:51.414 --> 00:26:55.958]  But, uh, we didn't expect, me and my stepdad, my stepdad didn't believe it was going to go down this way.
[00:26:55.998 --> 00:26:59.782]  We thought that, right, the last second before she died, the, uh,
[00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:08.042]  Finally, Jeb Bush and President Bush, all those guys had finally put... She was, sir, for all intents and purposes, she was dead two days ago.
[00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:09.442]  Oh, she was dead two days ago?
[00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:16.446]  Well, no, she died this morning, but you go twelve days without water, I mean, it's over for you.
[00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:25.050]  Yeah, well, we were just thinking that before she died, they'd put the tube back in and people would be wanting, or she would die, like she just did.
[00:27:25.822 --> 00:27:30.264]  And people will be yelling at the government for not getting involved and stuff like that.
[00:27:30.464 --> 00:27:33.466]  Some of these phony libertarians say the government shouldn't be involved.
[00:27:33.826 --> 00:27:35.027]  The government was involved.
[00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:36.768]  It's the government doing all this.
[00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:40.330]  Yeah.
[00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.831]  Sorry, my throat's kind of sore right now.
[00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:52.576]  We were thinking that because the courts kept on ruling and saying we're not going to put our feeding tube back in and all that stuff, we thought that they were going to
[00:27:53.055 --> 00:27:58.598]  They're passing laws saying that ever since she's died, now if people want to have this type of law, we're going to have the control of everybody's feeding tube.
[00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:01.820]  Type issues like Terry Seattle's, right?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.441]  Yeah, I hear you.
[00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:03.942]  I appreciate the call, Scott.
[00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.883]  The government's already involved.
[00:28:05.963 --> 00:28:11.987]  They used this as a way to introduce it to you as a ground-breaking, ice-breaking case.
[00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:13.788]  Let me explain this again.
[00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:18.709]  Hundreds of people that we know the names of beg for food.
[00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:20.210]  May I please have water and food?
[00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:21.090]  No!
[00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.211]  You said you didn't want medical procedures.
[00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:25.713]  Well, I know now that I did.
[00:28:25.733 --> 00:28:27.534]  I didn't know a feeding tube was that.
[00:28:27.874 --> 00:28:30.395]  I broke my neck in the automobile accident.
[00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:31.796]  Please feed me.
[00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:32.136]  No!
[00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:42.241]  You're dead because Governor Bush passed a law in Texas that you've gone off your insurance, the state's paying for it, so we're going to kill you now.
[00:28:43.042 --> 00:28:43.822]  And they kill you.
[00:28:45.043 --> 00:28:46.384]  This is going on all over the country.
[00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:48.266]  Uh, Debra in Michigan.
[00:28:48.306 --> 00:28:49.107]  Debra, go ahead.
[00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:54.691]  Hi, I just have a few things I'd like to say that most people are not aware of.
[00:28:54.852 --> 00:28:55.112]  Sure.
[00:28:55.392 --> 00:28:59.616]  There is a federal law in this country which is called False Abandonment.
[00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:00.817]  It's a felony.
[00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:04.200]  And which would have applied in this case
[00:29:04.798 --> 00:29:06.479]  When he moved in with his girlfriend.
[00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:12.501]  Yeah, that deals with federal child support or alimony, and you're absolutely right.
[00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:17.722]  Right, and then he should have legally been removed as her guardian because of spousal abandonment.
[00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:19.003]  Anybody else would have been!
[00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:19.643]  Yeah, of course.
[00:29:19.663 --> 00:29:23.744]  You've got a couple dirty dishes in your sink, the CPS will take your children.
[00:29:24.144 --> 00:29:27.345]  Right, now the thing is... Stay there, I'll let you finish up, Debra, on the other side.
[00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:28.986]  You're making good points, stay there.
[00:29:30.037 --> 00:29:38.480]  And I don't support the overreaching and the out-of-control behavior of adult and child protective services.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.821]  And I've told you... I've used hundreds of examples.
[00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:43.942]  When you've got real abuse, they do nothing.
[00:29:45.663 --> 00:29:49.224]  But when they've got quotas... We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.284 --> 00:29:49.924]  I'll explain it.
[00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:52.505]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.985 --> 00:29:54.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.506 --> 00:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:06.604]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:14.369]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:21.072]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:30:21.292 --> 00:30:22.653]  Now it's available to you.
[00:30:22.813 --> 00:30:29.417]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:30:29.617 --> 00:30:33.900]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:30:34.201 --> 00:30:40.466]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[00:30:40.606 --> 00:30:44.669]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:02.806]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:02.886 --> 00:31:13.592]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:18.495]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:29.902]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.482 --> 00:31:37.350]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:39.873]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.374 --> 00:31:45.340]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:32:45.226 --> 00:32:47.287]  The call is free, the quote is free.
[00:32:47.707 --> 00:32:49.929]  Call Matrix Direct now at 1-800-701-TERM.
[00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:53.692]  The caller brings up a really important issue.
[00:32:53.752 --> 00:32:57.214]  And you know, we don't just shoot our mouths off here.
[00:33:20.285 --> 00:33:22.986]  I've been researching this case for four years.
[00:33:23.906 --> 00:33:26.967]  Four orbits of the Earth around the Sun, okay?
[00:33:28.328 --> 00:33:29.468]  Four times 365 days.
[00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:36.230]  It's really almost over four years and let me explain this.
[00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:44.353]  The governor could have instantly launched a criminal investigation because you have sworn affidavits of two nurses and two doctors
[00:33:45.649 --> 00:34:08.074]  alleging abuse with evidence after she had a little accident and then of course right when she came into the hospital and at first he wasn't going to allow an autopsy last week but he said okay I will but you can't trust which medical examiner they're going to send her to because medical examiners have become very political
[00:34:09.304 --> 00:34:24.013]  Look at Fannie Malick, the Arkansas State Medical Examiner Clinton had, who would say that people could shoot themselves twice in the head with a shotgun in the back of the head, or cut their own arms and legs off and put their own bodies in plastic bags and pour gasoline on themselves.
[00:34:24.914 --> 00:34:26.235]  By the way, I'm not joking about that.
[00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:33.279]  Or could machine gun themselves off the road, or stab themselves 25 times apiece and then lay their bodies on railroad tracks.
[00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:38.062]  So there's no end to what these people will do and what they will say and what they will push.
[00:34:39.413 --> 00:34:43.075]  But the governor could have done something.
[00:34:43.175 --> 00:34:44.736]  The legislature could have done something.
[00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:49.018]  Family and Child Protective Services could have done something.
[00:34:49.698 --> 00:34:50.479]  They did nothing.
[00:34:50.519 --> 00:35:01.404]  Well, frankly, because of the pressure, Adult and Children Protective Services in Florida was sending state police with investigators to seize Terry last week.
[00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:10.916]  And the Pinellas County Sheriff and Police Department said, we are going to physically, this was in the Associated Press, repulse you.
[00:35:12.257 --> 00:35:16.420]  We are going to physically say no to you.
[00:35:17.321 --> 00:35:22.225]  And we are preparing to hold off the National Guard if need be.
[00:35:22.906 --> 00:35:23.867]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:35:24.107 --> 00:35:25.028]  This was in the news.
[00:35:25.528 --> 00:35:27.690]  Didn't get a lot of play, but it was on the news wires.
[00:35:28.827 --> 00:35:33.689]  Now, to be clear, the sheriff is the most powerful person in the county because they're elected.
[00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.530]  And they can throw the feds out.
[00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.252]  A sheriff can stop the feds because they're under the state constitution.
[00:35:39.652 --> 00:35:43.094]  They cannot stop the governor, and they cannot stop the state police.
[00:35:43.854 --> 00:35:45.054]  They trump the sheriff.
[00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:49.376]  But in this case, like a bunch of cowards, they did nothing.
[00:35:50.077 --> 00:35:53.118]  They'd have put a couple dirty plates in the sink.
[00:35:53.598 --> 00:35:57.360]  They'd have taken the whole family of children and put them all in Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:04.263]  But, and we see this over and over again, but Deborah and Michigan finish up what you were saying, then Lynn, George, Ruthann, and John.
[00:36:04.303 --> 00:36:04.743]  Go ahead.
[00:36:04.763 --> 00:36:16.068]  Okay, what I would like to say is that both Bush Brothers, they won their elections, well we know the elections were sort of rigged, but they got the support of the conservatives on their pro-life issues.
[00:36:16.128 --> 00:36:26.813]  Now, neither one, in reality, have done anything, anything that they could do to, you know, to honor what they
[00:36:27.423 --> 00:36:28.924]  You know, the platform they ran on.
[00:36:28.984 --> 00:36:35.769]  No, they've been appointing people like Alberto Gonzalez, who was for total abortion and 12-year-olds, not having to tell their parents when they go have abortions.
[00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.469]  Right.
[00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:44.995]  He's appointing all these pro-abortion people, pro-abortion people to all the federal benches, and he's out Clinton and Clinton, and you're absolutely right.
[00:36:45.015 --> 00:36:51.299]  Right, and Jen, even the President had the right to stop what they were doing to her, and he did nothing.
[00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:55.491]  Now, the other thing I want to ask you, and you may know this, because I don't know... Well, I'm going to be frank with you, ma'am.
[00:36:55.511 --> 00:36:56.451]  I'm going to be frank with you.
[00:36:56.771 --> 00:37:05.135]  Because federal laws were being violated, the Attorney General could direct an investigation, but he could not trump the state.
[00:37:05.555 --> 00:37:12.058]  But they had a client state with his own brother, so you're right, they could have been allowed in.
[00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:14.679]  Now, the Governor could have done something.
[00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:20.662]  Now, what I'd like to know, and you may know this, and then I'll hang up, how do you think this is going to affect
[00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:26.012]  In the future, people with disabilities and the elderly, what do you think this is going to do?
[00:37:26.092 --> 00:37:28.613]  Did this open the door for all euthanasia?
[00:37:29.193 --> 00:37:30.254]  Yes it is, thanks for the call.
[00:37:30.554 --> 00:37:32.215]  It's already been going on!
[00:37:32.976 --> 00:37:38.519]  The former editor of the Wall Street Journal, best-selling author, writes for dozens of major publications, he's a liberal!
[00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:40.520]  Wesley Smith!
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.242]  He goes to the hospitals, he's listed hundreds of names!
[00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:48.284]  People who can go bowling, you know, they even got use of their arms!
[00:37:50.086 --> 00:37:57.550]  Mr. Winland, other cases where people are going clearly with perfect diction, or perfect pronunciation.
[00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.771]  I guess diction is writing.
[00:37:59.391 --> 00:38:01.072]  May I have food and water, honey?
[00:38:01.692 --> 00:38:03.193]  No, you've been ordered to be killed.
[00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:04.514]  The bioethics board says so.
[00:38:05.114 --> 00:38:08.176]  The governor passed a law before he left to be Presidente.
[00:38:09.393 --> 00:38:19.416]  He passed it, what, in 1999, that if you go on Medicaid, or Medicare, and your expenses go over $500,000, they kill you!
[00:38:21.797 --> 00:38:25.998]  But the so-called pro-lifers don't want to talk about that because they're not really pro-life.
[00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:28.139]  It's about feeling good.
[00:38:28.219 --> 00:38:29.139]  They don't want to win.
[00:38:29.399 --> 00:38:30.739]  They don't want to take this country back.
[00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:32.480]  Bush has the executive.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.100]  He has 30-plus governors.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.441]  He has a big majority in the House and Senate.
[00:38:37.347 --> 00:38:38.287]  And what are we seeing?
[00:38:38.427 --> 00:38:39.188]  Gun control!
[00:38:39.368 --> 00:38:40.068]  Open borders!
[00:38:40.848 --> 00:38:42.128]  Record government budgets!
[00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.649]  Abortion!
[00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:49.170]  Look, Bush does stuff like he cuts $87 million for abortion funding in the U.N.
[00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.911]  and then overall increases U.N.
[00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:55.012]  funding $3 million and abortion funding gets increased by about $400 million.
[00:38:57.593 --> 00:38:59.073]  It's smoke and mirrors!
[00:39:01.614 --> 00:39:05.235]  Okay, I want to read this quote and then we'll go to your calls.
[00:39:06.158 --> 00:39:09.601]  Lynn and George and Ruth and John and others, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:09.621 --> 00:39:19.488]  Steve Quayle, a few weeks ago, he was going to be on to talk about Lucifer's Luggage, Suitcase Nukes in America, his new book.
[00:39:20.289 --> 00:39:22.971]  He was going to be on Coast to Coast AM tonight, but he had to cancel that, too.
[00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:29.547]  A couple weeks ago, his main manager at his business, Safe Trek, was in a motorcycle accident.
[00:39:30.047 --> 00:39:30.947]  Almost got killed.
[00:39:30.967 --> 00:39:31.868]  He had to cancel then.
[00:39:31.888 --> 00:39:35.249]  And then now his wife, two days ago, in a skiing accident.
[00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:36.610]  They live up in Montana.
[00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:37.830]  In Billings.
[00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:42.372]  Or no, they live in the... She went to Billings for medical treatment.
[00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:45.393]  Broke her shoulder in four places.
[00:39:46.393 --> 00:39:47.734]  And I talked to him this morning.
[00:39:47.774 --> 00:39:49.034]  He sounded pretty distraught.
[00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:51.095]  So we should pray for Steve.
[00:39:51.115 --> 00:39:52.156]  So Steve won't be on today.
[00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:53.336]  He'll be on next week.
[00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:55.707]  I mean, this stuff comes in threes.
[00:39:55.747 --> 00:39:57.068]  We hope something else doesn't happen.
[00:39:58.089 --> 00:39:59.370]  But pray for her.
[00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.493]  I'm trying to get a hold of Paul Watson.
[00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:04.114]  I like getting him on once a week.
[00:40:04.174 --> 00:40:06.016]  We've had so many guests, we haven't had a chance to have him on.
[00:40:06.476 --> 00:40:11.001]  When we can get a hold of Lord Watson, we will get him on from the United Kingdom in the middle of the next hour.
[00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.982]  But we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:40:13.022 --> 00:40:14.524]  But I just want to read this.
[00:40:15.865 --> 00:40:31.154]  For all those people that criticize those that drove to Pinellas County to protest and defend Terry, and all those that got arrested trying to bring her water, and those that criticize me for covering this case, and those that criticize me for making documentary films that I say you can make copies of.
[00:40:31.174 --> 00:40:34.936]  If that isn't enough, I'm evil because I sell videos, period.
[00:40:35.976 --> 00:40:40.539]  Just for all of those critics out there, I want to tell you what Teddy Roosevelt had to say.
[00:40:40.799 --> 00:40:42.220]  It's one of my favorite quotations.
[00:40:43.314 --> 00:40:44.895]  Well, first off, I'll give you Mark Twain's.
[00:40:45.315 --> 00:40:49.456]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned.
[00:40:49.856 --> 00:40:55.878]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:40:57.059 --> 00:40:58.679]  Continuing, this is Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.761]  It is not the critic who counts.
[00:41:02.361 --> 00:41:05.502]  Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles.
[00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:09.758]  Or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:41:10.278 --> 00:41:28.813]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who eras, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[00:41:30.126 --> 00:41:33.429]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds?
[00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:37.393]  Who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions?
[00:41:38.334 --> 00:41:38.934]  Oh yes!
[00:41:39.515 --> 00:41:41.817]  Who spends himself in a worthy cause?
[00:41:41.897 --> 00:41:46.581]  Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement?
[00:41:47.062 --> 00:41:49.404]  And who at worst, if he fails,
[00:41:50.496 --> 00:42:00.381]  At least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who never know victory nor defeat.
[00:42:01.301 --> 00:42:13.227]  Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workday world.
[00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:27.358]  Among the free peoples who govern themselves, thus is but a small field of useful open for the men who cloistered life, who shrink from contact with their fellows.
[00:42:28.438 --> 00:42:30.620]  And that's part of the speech you never heard.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.301]  It goes on for about 15 pages.
[00:42:33.342 --> 00:42:36.564]  I'm tempted to try to read this whole thing sometime on the air.
[00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:39.346]  But the reason I bring that up is
[00:42:40.789 --> 00:42:48.735]  Every day I probably get 15 emails saying, look, I've checked out what you're saying, the New World Order is real, I've read the documents, I've read it on the government's own websites.
[00:42:50.477 --> 00:42:53.199]  It's all true, but why are you still alive?
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.062]  Well, number one, because there's a God in heaven.
[00:42:59.583 --> 00:43:00.944]  And because of providence.
[00:43:01.305 --> 00:43:08.230]  And because throughout history, it also seems that evil respects those that fight it,
[00:43:09.148 --> 00:43:10.788]  And frankly, shrink from it.
[00:43:12.129 --> 00:43:16.190]  You know, it's the old thing, when you're playing football, if you go 110%, you don't get hurt.
[00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.611]  It's the one down, where you don't go full speed, that you get hurt.
[00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:21.831]  Almost every time, folks.
[00:43:22.351 --> 00:43:23.451]  You gotta go full speed.
[00:43:24.472 --> 00:43:28.573]  And, um... People ask me, you know, why are you still alive?
[00:43:28.633 --> 00:43:30.193]  Well, there's another reason.
[00:43:30.613 --> 00:43:34.254]  If they kill me, it only makes people pay more attention to my work.
[00:43:35.834 --> 00:43:37.095]  But there's an even bigger reason.
[00:43:37.475 --> 00:43:40.238]  There's now thousands and thousands of prominent fighters.
[00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.941]  And there's more and more of us every day.
[00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:48.885]  And twenty, thirty years ago they would kill people that talked about the New World Order in almost every case.
[00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:51.307]  And they still do kill folks.
[00:43:51.928 --> 00:43:52.408]  Routinely.
[00:43:53.449 --> 00:43:56.632]  But that hasn't deterred us from more people standing up and going forward.
[00:43:56.772 --> 00:43:59.474]  And you're not safe not fighting this.
[00:43:59.514 --> 00:44:00.975]  You think you're safe in the shadows?
[00:44:01.376 --> 00:44:02.777]  That's where the monsters
[00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:06.664]  The sadists of the New World Order lurk.
[00:44:07.204 --> 00:44:09.305]  They count on you timidly going into the night.
[00:44:09.585 --> 00:44:18.648]  To paraphrase Alexander Solzhenitsyn in Gulag Archipelago, he said, you know, what would have happened when the secret police went out to arrest people every night?
[00:44:19.328 --> 00:44:21.749]  He mentioned Stalingrad in particular.
[00:44:24.029 --> 00:44:32.012]  When the secret police went out to grab people each night, we would have met them in the stairwells, in the dark alleys with pokers and hatchets and knives.
[00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:35.942]  Pretty soon they wouldn't be going out at night.
[00:44:36.522 --> 00:44:41.145]  Pretty soon it all would have fallen apart, but people sat there and quietly went along with it.
[00:44:41.165 --> 00:44:44.147]  He said, oh, how we later burned in the camps.
[00:44:44.908 --> 00:44:46.069]  Burned with anger.
[00:44:46.969 --> 00:44:49.451]  And anger at ourselves that we didn't stand up.
[00:44:50.471 --> 00:44:52.533]  When you lick boots, folks, you get abused.
[00:44:52.613 --> 00:44:58.196]  When you're a bull, when you stand up and fight, the wolves move on to easier quarry.
[00:44:59.317 --> 00:45:00.118]  You understand that?
[00:45:01.238 --> 00:45:01.879]  You understand that?
[00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:05.149]  Wolves go after the babies.
[00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:06.289]  They go after the weak.
[00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:07.390]  They go after the lame.
[00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:16.336]  They go after the hyenas go after the wildebeest that broke its leg and got left behind by the others.
[00:45:17.136 --> 00:45:19.578]  The owl goes after the little field mouse.
[00:45:19.658 --> 00:45:29.805]  It doesn't go after you, a homo sapien sapien, with our giant brains and our intellects and our cunning and our honor.
[00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:31.586]  We are the most powerful
[00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:47.998]  These vicious creatures, the ultimate predator, and the predator class of our own species, a deranged, aberrant subspecies, has literally turned us into its prey, and I'm here to tell you, I'm not your prey!
[00:45:48.198 --> 00:45:55.902]  You may be able to circle me one night, a whole pack of you, and you may rip my guts out, but I will be a bull!
[00:45:56.222 --> 00:46:01.245]  And I will fight you to the end, and I will gore you, and I will go down fighting!
[00:46:02.856 --> 00:46:05.697]  You're not safe when you're like a little rabbit, shivering!
[00:46:05.857 --> 00:46:07.398]  Let's all turn into bulls!
[00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.119]  Let's turn into sheepdogs!
[00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:15.901]  You heard the analogy of the sheepdog that Mark Cornyn likes to use, political president right now in prison in Michigan.
[00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:27.906]  The people behave like sheep, and we see the wolves that run our society, and they love it that we're sheep, and they try to train more of us to behave like sheep, so their job's easier.
[00:46:29.167 --> 00:46:30.427]  They're a bunch of Judas goats.
[00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.848]  But we're not wolves, but we're not sheep.
[00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:33.749]  We're sheep dogs.
[00:46:34.029 --> 00:46:34.989]  We hate wolves.
[00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:36.049]  We can't stand wolves.
[00:46:36.289 --> 00:46:38.510]  And we're so sick of you being mindless sheep.
[00:46:41.531 --> 00:46:45.613]  So, for people that ask me this question, look, I've already won.
[00:46:45.633 --> 00:46:46.453]  Do you understand that?
[00:46:48.075 --> 00:46:49.816]  The New World Order could kill me tomorrow.
[00:46:50.076 --> 00:46:51.076]  I have already won.
[00:46:51.096 --> 00:46:52.637]  I have lived a life.
[00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.158]  I have had courage.
[00:46:54.518 --> 00:46:56.299]  I have done the best I could.
[00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.740]  I have been in the arena.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.220]  I have told the truth.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.661]  I have stood up for the little guy.
[00:47:00.921 --> 00:47:07.384]  I have followed my genetic code that God put into me to defend the weak, to defend the tribe, to defend humanity.
[00:47:07.604 --> 00:47:08.825]  I have followed my instincts.
[00:47:08.885 --> 00:47:10.025]  I have followed my spirit.
[00:47:10.386 --> 00:47:11.686]  I have done the right thing.
[00:47:12.126 --> 00:47:13.287]  And I've been in the arena!
[00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:16.948]  And so for all the detractors, you just go ahead and detract all day!
[00:47:17.188 --> 00:47:20.328]  You look at the man in the arena, and you say whatever you want!
[00:47:20.668 --> 00:47:22.109]  But I am in the arena!
[00:47:22.269 --> 00:47:27.470]  And I want you to join me in the arena, and we outnumber these wolves a thousand to one!
[00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:34.791]  They're trying to warp our minds right now, and turn more people into wolves, so they have a greater force.
[00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:38.412]  But for every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[00:47:39.048 --> 00:47:40.649]  That's what more of our number are growing.
[00:47:40.669 --> 00:47:42.090]  There's more sheepdogs every day.
[00:47:42.471 --> 00:47:43.731]  So come out of the shadows!
[00:47:44.332 --> 00:47:45.333]  And face them down!
[00:47:45.353 --> 00:47:46.814]  And have strength!
[00:47:47.774 --> 00:47:49.816]  Alright, let's talk to Lynn in Toronto, Canada.
[00:47:49.856 --> 00:47:50.496]  Go ahead, Lynn.
[00:47:51.177 --> 00:47:52.077]  Yeah, hello there.
[00:47:52.118 --> 00:47:57.101]  I'm calling regarding an issue that not too many people talk about regarding Terri Schindler.
[00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:00.964]  She was victimized by the courts, victimized by the government.
[00:48:01.676 --> 00:48:07.859]  And it looks as though certain people on the left, certain people on the right... For those who don't know, she died a few hours ago from torture.
[00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:08.659]  I know that.
[00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:13.241]  And sheer torture beyond, you know, there are no words for what she's been through.
[00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:13.682]  None.
[00:48:14.002 --> 00:48:17.843]  But you know, her family depended on lawyers, okay?
[00:48:18.144 --> 00:48:23.606]  And I'm a document examiner up here, and I do a lot of court work, and I see a lot of people screwed, okay?
[00:48:23.986 --> 00:48:25.747]  And I try to talk to them about their lawyer.
[00:48:25.787 --> 00:48:27.508]  I say, he's cutting your throat.
[00:48:27.568 --> 00:48:29.869]  They don't listen to me, but I'm very interested in
[00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:31.219]  You know, in these cases.
[00:48:31.279 --> 00:48:35.981]  So, I got on the internet and tried to find documents relating to the actual motion.
[00:48:36.001 --> 00:48:38.602]  How did they word their motions with these judges?
[00:48:38.762 --> 00:48:39.822]  Couldn't find them.
[00:48:40.322 --> 00:48:50.665]  And you know, the judge sits at the top of the room and he just listens to a lawyer and the other lawyer and whoever has the best argument, he will go in that favor.
[00:48:50.745 --> 00:48:52.026]  Well, that's not really what they do.
[00:48:52.046 --> 00:48:53.106]  They go off precedent.
[00:48:53.326 --> 00:48:54.327]  Well, I don't know.
[00:48:54.447 --> 00:48:55.187]  Or they try to.
[00:48:55.247 --> 00:48:56.347]  Well, I'm telling you how it works.
[00:48:56.487 --> 00:48:57.348]  I know, I know.
[00:48:57.388 --> 00:48:58.088]  They do that too.
[00:48:59.289 --> 00:49:05.056]  I think it's interesting that Richard Mellon Gates, who is a very big name in certain
[00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:33.182]  uh... groups like the uh... foundation uh... the roundtable it's called and i think i think a lot of bucks and supposedly it's a pro-life group well i have big concerns because lawyers they had so much meat to work with and why did they not bring like her assault by this guy at alleged assault no i agree with you there's something big missing their arguments were lame in court thanks for the call uh... george uh... in arizona george go ahead
[00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:34.538]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:35.178]  Hello.
[00:49:35.999 --> 00:49:39.401]  I really appreciated those quotes from Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:49:39.441 --> 00:49:40.262]  He was a great man.
[00:49:40.282 --> 00:49:42.363]  Thank you.
[00:49:42.443 --> 00:49:43.224]  What else is on your mind?
[00:49:43.284 --> 00:49:46.026]  Yes, I've got a question out of sheer curiosity.
[00:49:46.606 --> 00:49:55.513]  Over the past few weeks, we've heard so much about Harry and the Schindlers, her parents, and their Catholic beliefs.
[00:49:56.193 --> 00:50:01.597]  And there has never been, to my knowledge, one word about her husband and his religious beliefs.
[00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:14.923]  And on local talk radio here in Arizona, I've heard him mention that he was an Italian Catholic, I've heard him mention that he was Jewish, and I'm just wondering if you know anything about that?
[00:50:15.824 --> 00:50:18.366]  Supposedly he was a Catholic, but he's really not practicing.
[00:50:18.407 --> 00:50:21.950]  I don't really, I mean, he's dead now, and what does it matter?
[00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:28.756]  Well, I was just curious because, I don't know, the man seems to be truly evil.
[00:50:30.379 --> 00:50:37.441]  Well he's supposedly very domineering and I mean we know from the record he said he wanted to take care of her as soon as he got the money he didn't want to take care of her.
[00:50:37.841 --> 00:50:38.101]  Right.
[00:50:38.341 --> 00:50:46.604]  I mean he's a piece of trash and there's no debating it you know we're gonna have to break here in just a second but I do appreciate your call anything else George?
[00:50:47.424 --> 00:50:54.086]  The last thing I'd like to mention is that I listen carefully to not only shortwave but most of the talk show hosts and it seems to the man
[00:50:54.798 --> 00:50:58.820]  They seem to be almost entirely on his side and against her.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:50:59.500]  I hear you.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.181]  Thanks for the call.
[00:51:01.441 --> 00:51:05.784]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.964 --> 00:51:10.386]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:14.928]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.948 --> 00:51:16.309]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.890]  Animers!
[00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:22.315]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:29.323]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.443 --> 00:51:31.446]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.786 --> 00:51:42.232]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:47.815]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.116 --> 00:52:04.998]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.238 --> 00:52:10.681]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.942 --> 00:52:21.327]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.488 --> 00:52:25.810]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:54:07.964 --> 00:54:15.225]  Well, Jerry Shibo Schindler is dead after almost 14 days of dehydration and pure torture.
[00:54:15.245 --> 00:54:17.346]  They've redefined it as good.
[00:54:17.366 --> 00:54:19.146]  No, we're giving her treatment.
[00:54:19.846 --> 00:54:25.747]  We don't want to put her feeding tube in, I heard last Friday, because, well, she's terminally ill now, and giving her water might hurt her.
[00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:28.708]  I actually heard some of these government doctors saying that.
[00:54:29.768 --> 00:54:31.188]  This is the mass mental illness.
[00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:34.089]  We'll go to Ruthann, John, Brett, John, James, and others.
[00:54:34.956 --> 00:54:35.757]  Here in just a moment.
[00:54:36.058 --> 00:54:37.520]  Wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.363]  There is a bunch of other news I'll be getting to as well.
[00:54:40.423 --> 00:54:50.536]  Before I go back to your calls, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out on DVD.
[00:54:51.197 --> 00:54:52.138]  The DVD has
[00:54:53.163 --> 00:54:57.144]  Twenty-five extra minutes of material, so it's a little over three hours long.
[00:54:57.604 --> 00:55:00.305]  The VHS is two hours thirty-five minutes long.
[00:55:00.905 --> 00:55:07.747]  It covers the latest police state developments, what really happened on 9-11, the most complete, focused, documented, just the stuff you can prove.
[00:55:08.547 --> 00:55:09.967]  Proving the globalists carried out 9-11.
[00:55:10.087 --> 00:55:19.049]  Then it spends a full hour on the Bush-Nazi connection, the Arnold-Nazi connection, the secret death cults that run all this, going into the Illuminati and skull and bones.
[00:55:19.209 --> 00:55:20.190]  It is powerful.
[00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:21.330]  It is all documented.
[00:55:22.379 --> 00:55:24.861]  $25.95 to get it on VHS or DVD.
[00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:26.322]  It's really three films in one.
[00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:32.986]  But get a second video if you want to buy one and buy another as a gift for $19.95.
[00:55:33.487 --> 00:55:35.828]  And get a third one for $15.
[00:55:37.809 --> 00:55:39.991]  So get three of these and save about $18.
[00:55:41.092 --> 00:55:45.795]  Three of the new film when you order on VHS or DVD.
[00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:50.651]  You can order on Infowars.com via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.

[00:56:15.199 --> 00:56:15.800]  It's powerful.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.421]  Really exposes the globalists.

[00:56:38.004 --> 00:56:39.646]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:39.666 --> 00:56:43.229]  Ruthann in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:43.930]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:44.691]  Welcome, Ruthann.
[00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:45.351]  Hi.
[00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:50.576]  For the past two years, I've been friends and in contact with a girl who is friends with the Schindlers.
[00:56:50.777 --> 00:56:54.380]  And I've been very close to this case, followed it very closely.
[00:56:54.921 --> 00:57:01.347]  And towards the end of this, I was trying to persuade her to stop focusing on the courts and at least get them
[00:57:01.724 --> 00:57:03.805]  to start fighting for an independent autopsy.
[00:57:04.105 --> 00:57:09.608]  They had an independent doctor who's a specialist in ligament strangulation, a forensics guy.
[00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:15.912]  She had fractures in her neck and the doctor that first treated her said that was evidence that she'd been brutalized.
[00:57:16.512 --> 00:57:26.237]  Well, the Schindlers apparently have not done this and I was urging her for days here, go for the autopsy, make it public on the media that you want this independent.
[00:57:26.277 --> 00:57:30.980]  But now it seems to me like they're going with the government autopsy and I think they're making a big mistake.
[00:57:32.356 --> 00:57:33.437]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:57:33.497 --> 00:57:36.178]  It really makes me worry about who's advising them.
[00:57:36.678 --> 00:57:37.358]  Me too.
[00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:42.561]  That other caller from Canada was saying who are their lawyers or who's advising these people.
[00:57:43.101 --> 00:57:45.282]  I mean, the system let them down once.
[00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:46.802]  I can't believe they're trusting the system.
[00:57:47.042 --> 00:57:49.803]  They are allowed to have an independent expert in there.
[00:57:50.104 --> 00:57:52.545]  Dr. Bawden said so on TV the last few days.
[00:57:52.745 --> 00:57:54.325]  They're allowed to have it videotaped.
[00:57:54.705 --> 00:57:56.126]  You know, they have these rights.
[00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.647]  They don't have to beg for these.
[00:57:57.767 --> 00:57:58.327]  It's part of the
[00:57:58.926 --> 00:58:00.426]  Uh, system that they are allowed to do this.
[00:58:00.446 --> 00:58:01.026]  Well, it is.
[00:58:01.207 --> 00:58:06.028]  All of this is part of our basic system, but the basics of the system are all being ignored in this case.
[00:58:06.408 --> 00:58:11.869]  I think they're going to get railroaded on the autopsy too, and it's going to end up, I don't know where, just a big question mark forever.
[00:58:11.889 --> 00:58:13.369]  Well, we have the original medical reports.
[00:58:13.809 --> 00:58:14.749]  At least that, yes.
[00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:25.652]  And the other thing I wanted to ask you, because I don't understand this, and it's a big question mark that's been hanging over this case forever, and that is that insurance company called Gerger & Centenzi Insurance Company.
[00:58:25.992 --> 00:58:26.512]  That was
[00:58:27.012 --> 00:58:28.532]  I don't know the details.
[00:58:28.672 --> 00:58:29.573]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.452 --> 00:58:58.112]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.772 --> 00:58:59.833]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.533 --> 00:59:01.633]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.293 --> 00:59:03.154]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.874 --> 00:59:04.754]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:09.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.616 --> 00:59:13.778]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:22.141]  Alright, we're now 30 seconds into hour number two on this Thursday edition.
[00:59:23.044 --> 00:59:48.773]  Just 3 hours short of the 14th day, almost 14 days into torture and dehydration, they wouldn't allow an Al-Qaeda member to be executed this way, or an axe murderer, or a dog, or a horse, or a pig, but you go ahead and you do it for this little lady, and she's out of her pain now, the pain they put her in, in solitary confinement with no medical treatment, in the last 10 years, no brushing her teeth,
[00:59:49.637 --> 00:59:50.117]  No, nothing.
[00:59:50.157 --> 01:00:03.107]  The parents, and I hope people go to PrisonPlanet.com and get this article, where we point out what's hidden in plain view in this CNN article, that Shibo wouldn't let the family in on the last day to see her.
[01:00:04.848 --> 01:00:09.832]  Because I guess he didn't want them to run outside and go, she's having convulsions, you know, she's about to die.
[01:00:10.493 --> 01:00:11.613]  Wouldn't let them in to see her.
[01:00:14.622 --> 01:00:17.003]  It's just unbelievable we're letting folks respond to this.
[01:00:17.023 --> 01:00:21.505]  And I know it's a big media circus and people are asking why are we spending so much time on this.
[01:00:21.525 --> 01:00:22.445]  This is a diversion.
[01:00:23.106 --> 01:00:25.527]  You know, the globalists are killing people all over the place.
[01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:33.030]  I'm going to answer that question when we get back from break with a great editorial that was written that I think says it even better than I can, more succinctly.
[01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:37.632]  But right now let's go to John in Tennessee, then Brett, John, James, Mike, and others.
[01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:39.032]  John, you're on the air.
[01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:39.412]  Go ahead.
[01:00:39.873 --> 01:00:40.373]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:40.733 --> 01:00:42.854]  I just want to preface what I'm saying by
[01:00:44.483 --> 01:00:45.784]  I consider myself liberal.
[01:00:45.824 --> 01:00:49.265]  I voted Democrat in almost all elections I can think of.
[01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:51.986]  So you voted for the left-wing shot of the false paradigm?
[01:00:52.086 --> 01:00:52.747]  Right, right.
[01:00:53.307 --> 01:00:56.648]  And I consider myself pro-choice.
[01:00:56.748 --> 01:00:58.969]  I don't like the late-term abortions and stuff.
[01:00:59.009 --> 01:01:04.571]  But I'm so angry at not just what's happened to Ms.
[01:01:05.252 --> 01:01:13.415]  Schindler, but the way some on the left have just automatically lined up like it's some preset play or something.
[01:01:14.603 --> 01:01:24.336]  I'm on the MoveOn.org's mailing list since they sent me some email about, let's stop Bush from intervening in this case.
[01:01:24.397 --> 01:01:28.482]  And I basically sent them an email back telling them to go where Terry Chaivo is not going.
[01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:33.804]  Well, I mean, to Jesse Jackson's credit, he's down there saying it's wrong.
[01:01:33.884 --> 01:01:41.373]  Yes, yes, and it's not this... It's not... There's nothing... They want to make it partisan to automatically divide us.
[01:01:41.653 --> 01:01:41.913]  Right.
[01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:50.423]  I mean, there's nothing feminist about letting an abusive husband make life and death decisions for his wife.
[01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:57.108]  The feminist movement has claimed to have been fighting that for decades.
[01:01:57.168 --> 01:02:00.290]  The feminist movement was founded by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:06.053]  Gloria Steinem in one of her books admits that she was a CIA officer and the CIA paid to set up Ms.
[01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:06.713]  Magazine.
[01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:13.638]  It was a way to make sure women got into the workforce to double tax and to make sure the state had control of the children.
[01:02:14.218 --> 01:02:14.478]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.038 --> 01:02:17.640]  No, that's a fact sir.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.201]  I've heard you talk about this.
[01:02:21.581 --> 01:02:37.137]  I think they overplayed their hand, though, because some of this stuff that they're doing is so outrageous that it's starting to get people on both sides, some people on the right to realize that Bush hasn't really done anything, and some of us on the left to realize that
[01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:40.033]  Let's get past left and right, my friend.
[01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:46.254]  It feels so good, what team we're on, but it's all false.
[01:02:46.274 --> 01:02:53.516]  If you look at the actual voting records right now, Bush has total control of everything, and he's giving, quote, the liberals everything they ever wanted.
[01:02:53.756 --> 01:02:57.917]  It's just conservatives aren't complaining because it's Bush doing it, so it must be good.
[01:02:58.698 --> 01:03:09.405]  And at the same time, the Democrats are voting for the war, they're voting for the Patriot Act, they're voting for the Fourth Psychological Testing and Drugging, New Freedom, they're voting for the National ID Cards, they're voting for it all!
[01:03:09.985 --> 01:03:19.451]  And you know, you mentioned that law that Bush passed, somebody sent me about a case in Houston, Texas, you probably heard about this, about the... Killing the baby!
[01:03:19.611 --> 01:03:19.931]  Yeah!
[01:03:20.894 --> 01:03:25.795]  They passed a law where when your Medicaid runs out, the state isn't going to pay for it and they kill you.
[01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:31.157]  And the mother's saying... There's not going to be a crowd of pro-lifers down there protesting that, because Bush is doing it.
[01:03:31.177 --> 01:03:32.977]  They'll go, it's a bootlord.
[01:03:33.237 --> 01:03:40.939]  And then there's that soldier that killed that Iraqi, it's a quote-unquote mercy killing, saying that he felt that was the honorable thing to do.
[01:03:41.059 --> 01:03:41.799]  It's just happening.
[01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.419]  You know, that's their cover story.
[01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:44.160]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.100]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:47.701]  Stay with us.
[01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.501]  More your calls, more news straight ahead.
[01:03:53.903 --> 01:04:01.310]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:06.315]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.535 --> 01:04:12.181]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.401 --> 01:04:24.313]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.353 --> 01:04:28.837]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.037 --> 01:04:31.560]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:37.005]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroy
[01:04:37.065 --> 01:04:37.906]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.544 --> 01:05:02.611]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:14.100]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:20.145]  Nitrates, Nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.385 --> 01:05:27.031]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:34.076]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.337 --> 01:05:36.098]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.358 --> 01:05:38.440]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.543]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:42.263]  Call New Millennium at 888-

[01:06:54.241 --> 01:07:00.265]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:03.927]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:15.594]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:18.696]  We're now
[01:07:20.493 --> 01:07:40.628]  8 minutes and 30 seconds into this second hour, Terri Schiebo Schindler, Terri Schiebo, her real name Terri Schindler, after 10 years of abandonment, 10 years in solitary confinement, 10 years after having her rehabilitation taken away, she could talk, she could walk with aid, she could
[01:07:43.164 --> 01:07:48.126]  Say, Mommy, and help me, and potty, and hi, and bye.
[01:07:48.546 --> 01:07:55.308]  She would sit out in the hall, talking with the nurses, love to be around other women and people, and wave at everybody.
[01:07:55.328 --> 01:07:59.569]  You know, would lift her fingers a little bit and wave, and say hi to people.
[01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.330]  And Michael Schiavo said, I just want to take care of her.
[01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.051]  This is in the civil court hearings and record.
[01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:08.812]  I just want to be able to take care of her for the rest of her life.
[01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:09.732]  That's 50 years.
[01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:11.913]  So I need 20 million dollars.
[01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:17.274]  Well, he only got a million and then he got the family to sign everything over to him because they trusted him.
[01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:23.260]  He just wanted to take care of her and it would be so much simpler if he was the main guardian with the paperwork.
[01:08:24.101 --> 01:08:26.002]  And then suddenly he said, that's it, lock her up.
[01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:28.305]  The family can only see her one hour a day.
[01:08:29.446 --> 01:08:30.507]  Close the blinds.
[01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.008]  Don't take her outside anymore.
[01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:33.870]  No more physical therapy.
[01:08:34.651 --> 01:08:36.733]  And tried to get the tube removed then.
[01:08:36.753 --> 01:08:38.875]  At that point she was eating solid food.
[01:08:39.853 --> 01:08:44.417]  And so after 10 years of torture, then she got to the point where she could just lay there and look back and forth and mumble.
[01:08:45.418 --> 01:08:47.099]  And they told you she was brain dead.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.144]  Then we forced them to retract that and say that she was in a persistent vegetative state.
[01:08:54.605 --> 01:08:57.448]  All the doctors that said it was a fraud, they couldn't get on the news.
[01:08:58.329 --> 01:09:02.972]  They just use it as a case point to kill an innocent woman in front of you and to sell you on a fraud.
[01:09:04.914 --> 01:09:07.016]  And the family wanted to see her last night.
[01:09:08.317 --> 01:09:14.522]  Going into the 14th day, into the 13th day, she died 3 hours short of a full 14 days.
[01:09:14.542 --> 01:09:16.764]  And he wouldn't let them in to see her.
[01:09:16.964 --> 01:09:17.804]  They begged.
[01:09:17.824 --> 01:09:20.907]  And he wouldn't let them in to see her.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.562]  And this isn't being turned into a big issue.
[01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:30.185]  Just that point right there to show how loving he is, just kind of hidden in plain view in the middle of a CNN story.
[01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:39.090]  But we've pointed it out at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, so please get the article and email it out to everybody so we can have the truth on the record.
[01:09:40.651 --> 01:09:45.374]  And we found a lot of so-called liberal websites saying, when is that bleeper going to die?
[01:09:46.175 --> 01:09:49.797]  Same stuff Michael said, according to sworn testimony by nurses and others.
[01:09:51.162 --> 01:09:55.664]  And they're calling her the state vegetable of Florida.
[01:09:58.206 --> 01:10:02.228]  All because they got sucked into this partisan debate.
[01:10:02.328 --> 01:10:04.769]  Oh, Bush is evil, so let's get Terry.
[01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:06.970]  That's what partisanship does to your mind.
[01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.311]  That's so disgusting.
[01:10:11.072 --> 01:10:17.516]  Let's go ahead and take another... Well, let me read why cover Terry's murder.
[01:10:17.616 --> 01:10:18.216]  This was written
[01:10:19.858 --> 01:10:20.659]  Two days ago.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.981]  Why cover Terry's murder?
[01:10:25.582 --> 01:10:33.907]  Why is the torture and execution of Terry Schiavo being covered so thoroughly by so many alternative media and mainstream media and weblogs?
[01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:35.888]  Why is the case so different?
[01:10:36.068 --> 01:10:37.309]  Why is the case so important?
[01:10:37.909 --> 01:10:44.573]  Yes, killing a single Iraqi or Afghani is every bit as heinous as killing Terry Schiavo.
[01:10:45.211 --> 01:10:50.574]  And we've covered that issue and made the point that a life is a life thousands of times.
[01:10:51.955 --> 01:10:56.737]  And killing a million and a half Iraqis is a million and a half times worse than killing one.
[01:10:58.378 --> 01:11:07.483]  Terry Schindler Schiavo embodies and represents those countless other innocents that the oil-soaked, NWO, neocon globalists have tortured and slaughtered.
[01:11:07.703 --> 01:11:14.507]  However, this is a public execution being carried out at home here in the United States of America.
[01:11:15.556 --> 01:11:17.977]  And I would add, it isn't some demonized Iraqi.
[01:11:18.677 --> 01:11:20.437]  Somebody who's been designated subhuman.
[01:11:20.457 --> 01:11:21.497]  I've heard the neocon say that.
[01:11:22.217 --> 01:11:27.639]  And it is the New World Order globalist neocon illuminatis telling Americans and the entire U.S.
[01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:34.400]  Congress that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is no longer guaranteed under their versions of the U.S.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.080]  Constitution.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:40.681]  This is murder as a gross instrument of desensitization.
[01:11:41.262 --> 01:11:43.102]  Not unlike 9-11 to some degree.
[01:11:43.943 --> 01:11:46.424]  Also designed to strike fear into the American people.
[01:11:46.945 --> 01:11:50.146]  Fear that their very lives are no longer sacrosanct.
[01:11:50.706 --> 01:12:08.935]  This murder and ignoring of what may be multiple correlated felonies is being staged to shock Americans to the core and prepare them to accept local, regional, and state-decreed death and widespread euthanasia as the new norm.
[01:12:09.927 --> 01:12:13.730]  Americans have lost enormous freedom and liberty in the last 15 years.
[01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:18.074]  But they always felt their lives, at least, were secure.
[01:12:18.775 --> 01:12:20.316]  That is no longer the case.
[01:12:22.478 --> 01:12:29.544]  If you think George W. Bush's daughters would get the same treatment by the courts, you have completely disconnected from reality.
[01:12:30.402 --> 01:12:41.605]  No pro-dunk judge, local or federal, would even dare to stand up to the President, the Congress, the Governor, the various state agencies, without knowing he, she, was fully protected.
[01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:54.348]  Too many Americans have been so dumbed down that they cannot connect the dots that it was eight years after Terry's collapse that her husband remembered that she supposedly said she would never want to live like this.
[01:12:55.046 --> 01:13:09.791]  Many Americans cannot figure out that there might be something stranger with the fact that Mike cut off all of Terry's therapy a few months after he won $700,000 settlement for Terry plus $300,000 for Mike.
[01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:18.894]  That was to have taken the best possible care and rehabilitation of Terry for the rest of her life, which the jury felt would be at least 50 years.
[01:13:20.177 --> 01:13:28.062]  Many forget that Terry, with therapy, was able to swallow and drink until Mike forced a feeding tube to be inserted and stopped all therapy.
[01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:34.386]  Many forget that Mike has not even allowed his wife to be taken outside into the sunshine for over five years.
[01:13:34.927 --> 01:13:40.110]  The list of other outrages is a long one and has been amply covered on the internet.
[01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:45.687]  Americans must keep in mind nothing is done on the scale by accident or happenstance.
[01:13:46.108 --> 01:13:53.816]  This is a plan of public execution which is blatantly intended to put the fear of death by the government into Americans from this day forth.
[01:13:54.682 --> 01:14:06.308]  The public reaction, your reaction, is being closely watched, tracked, and analyzed by the masters of social engineering and mass mind control on their supercomputer models at Tavistock and here in the United States.
[01:14:06.868 --> 01:14:12.551]  That is why we are covering the execution of Terry Schiavo so diligently.
[01:14:14.232 --> 01:14:24.077]  And you can go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and link through to this excellent synopsis by Jeff Rentsch.
[01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:31.551]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:33.512]  Thank you for being patient.
[01:14:34.393 --> 01:14:37.694]  Up next is... Who's up next here?
[01:14:39.115 --> 01:14:40.275]  Brent in Washington.
[01:14:40.315 --> 01:14:40.955]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:42.176]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:43.156]  How are you doing today?
[01:14:43.236 --> 01:14:43.456]  Good.
[01:14:44.317 --> 01:14:46.498]  Thanks for reading that from Jeff Rents.
[01:14:46.558 --> 01:14:53.961]  That's exactly the reason I wanted to call today to touch upon the propaganda aspect of this whole issue with Terry.
[01:14:55.132 --> 01:15:00.217]  As you know, with advertising or propaganda, they want to instill a particular belief.
[01:15:00.257 --> 01:15:01.998]  Perception is reality!
[01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:06.463]  Exactly, within the masses, to continue their manipulation of the sheeple.
[01:15:07.364 --> 01:15:12.609]  And as you know, there are so many numerous news issues each day.
[01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.392]  Why are they covering this particular issue?
[01:15:16.232 --> 01:15:17.433]  That's a question everybody has to ask.
[01:15:17.453 --> 01:15:19.233]  Well, number one, because it gets ratings.
[01:15:19.273 --> 01:15:20.994]  I mean, it's a dynamic story.
[01:15:21.514 --> 01:15:28.397]  But it's because they have a pro-death agenda and they get to spin it and practice their propaganda and balkanize the people.
[01:15:28.777 --> 01:15:33.059]  But we've been talking about the Minutemen on the border and the Mexican troops starting to kill them.
[01:15:33.539 --> 01:15:36.940]  We've been talking about the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.901]  We've been talking about all the gun control bills.
[01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:40.682]  We've been talking about all of it.
[01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:42.483]  That's exactly right.
[01:15:42.903 --> 01:15:45.924]  I was listening to Bloomberg this morning
[01:15:46.725 --> 01:15:49.868]  And quite early they stated that she had passed away.
[01:15:49.888 --> 01:15:56.574]  And within their story they vulcanized it between the parents, you know, their love for their daughter.
[01:15:56.914 --> 01:16:01.138]  She was basically a brain damaged vegetable in a coma.
[01:16:01.498 --> 01:16:06.763]  They wanted to keep her alive and there her husband was doing the best thing to let her go.
[01:16:06.783 --> 01:16:11.367]  And they actually stated in the story that she got in this situation
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.324]  From excessive consumption of iced tea when she was hospitalized.
[01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:18.365]  And I couldn't believe that.
[01:16:19.306 --> 01:16:22.169]  Also as far as... Oh no, it's all her fault.
[01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.789]  She's evil.
[01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:30.615]  And also just one last thing as far as the implementation and the removal of the feeding tube.
[01:16:31.716 --> 01:16:37.301]  That's no difference than somebody under electrocution or being dunked.
[01:16:37.771 --> 01:16:40.173]  You know, if they turn on electricity, they remove it.
[01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:44.216]  Again, sir, and I appreciate the call, they've got to change the definitions.
[01:16:44.296 --> 01:16:46.818]  It's now treatment to kill somebody.
[01:16:47.819 --> 01:16:50.661]  You see, forced psychological testing is conservative.
[01:16:51.182 --> 01:16:52.743]  2.6 trillion dollar budgets.
[01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:57.887]  800 billion bigger than Bill Clinton's biggest budget is conservative.
[01:16:58.207 --> 01:17:00.109]  Doubling the Department of Education's size.
[01:17:00.469 --> 01:17:01.910]  Health and Human Services' size.
[01:17:02.331 --> 01:17:05.113]  Every welfare system to take over families is conservative.
[01:17:05.951 --> 01:17:09.952]  Appointing all these abortion promoters into judgeships is conservative.
[01:17:10.212 --> 01:17:11.832]  You've got to learn the double think, sir.
[01:17:11.852 --> 01:17:12.292]  Okay?
[01:17:12.872 --> 01:17:13.693]  Death is life.
[01:17:14.593 --> 01:17:15.633]  Slavery is freedom.
[01:17:17.253 --> 01:17:18.293]  Torture is love.
[01:17:18.974 --> 01:17:20.354]  Love is evil.
[01:17:20.414 --> 01:17:21.014]  Alrighty then.
[01:17:21.954 --> 01:17:24.695]  Torturing someone to death is not torture, Alberto Gonzales says.
[01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:27.895]  Let's talk to John in Michigan.
[01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:28.735]  John, go ahead.
[01:17:29.196 --> 01:17:31.456]  Yeah, you're going to have Steve Quayle on land?
[01:17:32.245 --> 01:17:37.009]  I was going to have Steve on today, but his wife was in a skiing accident and broke her shoulder in four places.
[01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:48.279]  If you click on Northeast Intelligence report at his website, this guy is completely pro-homeland security and pro-Israel, Alex.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.321]  Were you aware of that?
[01:17:51.161 --> 01:17:53.764]  Well, you know, we have all views on this broadcast.
[01:17:53.844 --> 01:17:55.025]  We have your view right now.
[01:17:56.504 --> 01:18:06.571]  And Steve believes that the New World Order controls the terrorists, but he doesn't think that Israel is the center of it.
[01:18:08.012 --> 01:18:13.496]  I mean, Steve has me on his show, and I think overall, Steve's doing a good job.
[01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:18.940]  I mean, almost none of your material is allowed on that chat website, if you go there.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.462]  They'll vehemently remove any of that.
[01:18:23.503 --> 01:18:24.204]  My material?
[01:18:24.224 --> 01:18:24.564]  What do you mean?
[01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:26.365]  Anything pro.
[01:18:27.486 --> 01:18:30.147]  Hey, can you tell us what happened to Mark Kornke's program?
[01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:32.448]  Since you tell the truth when you come back.
[01:18:33.368 --> 01:18:35.889]  It used to be on Genesis here.
[01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.490]  Mark Kornke went to jail, so he hasn't been doing his radio program.
[01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:42.871]  His wife's program was on Genesis.
[01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:43.752]  What happened to that?
[01:18:45.092 --> 01:18:46.513]  Well, I don't know.
[01:18:46.553 --> 01:18:47.733]  It's not on the network.
[01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:50.014]  Not nice to talk to you.
[01:18:50.074 --> 01:18:50.894]  I guess I'm the enemy.
[01:18:53.681 --> 01:18:56.563]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:56.903 --> 01:18:59.785]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.005 --> 01:19:06.229]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:56.343]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.763 --> 01:20:01.125]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:07.207]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:07.427 --> 01:20:11.489]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:11.769 --> 01:20:17.411]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:20:17.531 --> 01:20:20.152]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:22.233 --> 01:20:26.136]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.578]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:20:28.918 --> 01:20:31.199]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.222]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:20:35.702 --> 01:20:41.887]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:20:42.347 --> 01:20:43.328]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:43.668 --> 01:20:43.988]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.008 --> 01:20:44.188]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.053 --> 01:20:55.555]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.235 --> 01:21:05.801]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:21:06.889 --> 01:21:16.434]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:17.454 --> 01:21:22.957]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:54.703]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:54.963 --> 01:21:59.965]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.225 --> 01:22:02.826]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.026 --> 01:22:11.550]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:20.393]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:22:24.214 --> 01:22:31.657]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.

[01:22:45.564 --> 01:22:49.287]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:55.152]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:22:55.192 --> 01:23:00.517]  We're going to continue taking your calls and covering other news items.
[01:23:00.577 --> 01:23:03.199]  But since that caller wants me to tell the truth, I will.
[01:23:04.602 --> 01:23:13.449]  You know, I don't make this show about bashing other Patriot Talk Show hosts, and bashing other people that are fighting the New World Order, even though in some cases I don't agree with everything they're saying or doing.
[01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:19.933]  If you're nice to me, and you're putting out good info, I'll have you on, I'll support you.
[01:23:20.554 --> 01:23:23.716]  But there's a lot of people that just spend all their time fighting with each other.
[01:23:25.577 --> 01:23:28.960]  And I wasn't placing it at the time when that last caller was on.
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.961]  I had nothing to do with the programming on this network.
[01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:33.143]  I did my radio show, and that's the end of it.
[01:23:33.829 --> 01:23:35.911]  People call me up wanting to advertise on this show.
[01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:37.412]  I can't turn it into an infomercial.
[01:23:37.832 --> 01:23:39.054]  So I just send them to the network.
[01:23:39.094 --> 01:23:40.114]  I'm not even involved in that.
[01:23:41.856 --> 01:23:42.977]  But I remember that voice.
[01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:46.400]  That guy was a fill-in host on that show he was mentioning.
[01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:49.903]  And Mark had a Monday through Friday show.
[01:23:49.923 --> 01:23:50.864]  And then he went to jail.
[01:23:50.964 --> 01:23:57.850]  And a few years after he went to jail, on trumped-up charges, as I said, I was a friend of... I never met Mark in person, but I had him on many times.
[01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:59.371]  I thought Mark Corky did a lot of good work.
[01:24:00.705 --> 01:24:07.009]  His wife had a Friday show, and they said, well, we can't really have a lineup where we have a show just on Friday, so we're moving it to the weekend.
[01:24:07.029 --> 01:24:12.832]  I remember hearing the show with that guy, same voice, bashing the network.
[01:24:13.713 --> 01:24:15.213]  He did it for a couple months.
[01:24:15.674 --> 01:24:16.494]  What do you expect?
[01:24:16.774 --> 01:24:18.655]  Okay, bye-bye, go somewhere else and do it.
[01:24:18.996 --> 01:24:19.796]  So you want the truth?
[01:24:19.816 --> 01:24:20.236]  There it is.
[01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:20.957]  Bye-bye!
[01:24:21.317 --> 01:24:22.057]  Bye-bye!
[01:24:22.077 --> 01:24:24.779]  I mean, just amazing.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.421]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:24:29.222 --> 01:24:33.185]  Uh, that, uh, and people think this is what this is all about.
[01:24:33.205 --> 01:24:36.207]  Uh, it just blows my mind.
[01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:37.568]  So there, there, there's the truth.
[01:24:37.668 --> 01:24:38.508]  You want more truth?
[01:24:38.829 --> 01:24:39.909]  I got a lot more truth for ya!
[01:24:39.929 --> 01:24:41.110]  Why don't you call back in?
[01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:42.471]  I'll dump a whole bunch of truth on ya!
[01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:47.675]  Alright, let's go ahead and, um, I mean, these people are just, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:48.595 --> 01:24:52.338]  Uh, let's, uh, I couldn't believe for months the network just let them do it.
[01:24:52.398 --> 01:24:55.460]  I'm not even talking about Nancy, I'm talking about that screwball.
[01:24:56.418 --> 01:24:57.818]  And you want to fight with me?
[01:24:57.918 --> 01:24:58.659]  Come on, let's fight!
[01:24:59.339 --> 01:25:01.319]  And then we'll just turn the whole show into this.
[01:25:01.699 --> 01:25:06.360]  Not about the open borders, not about free trade area of the Americas, not about cancer, viruses and the vaccines.
[01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.881]  We'll do a show like you did.
[01:25:08.301 --> 01:25:10.021]  We'll just talk bad about people all day.
[01:25:11.142 --> 01:25:12.782]  And perseverate on Israel.
[01:25:13.462 --> 01:25:17.463]  Let's go ahead and... Let's talk about euthanasia now.
[01:25:17.483 --> 01:25:18.823]  Let's talk about a real issue, okay?
[01:25:19.084 --> 01:25:20.744]  Don't call my show with your garbage.
[01:25:21.564 --> 01:25:22.544]  I support people.
[01:25:22.804 --> 01:25:23.885]  I supported that show.
[01:25:24.025 --> 01:25:24.825]  Then you attack me?
[01:25:26.556 --> 01:25:28.377]  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, punk!
[01:25:28.877 --> 01:25:29.298]  Excuse me.
[01:25:29.818 --> 01:25:31.059]  I just get tired of it, folks.
[01:25:31.519 --> 01:25:36.282]  I really bite my tongue over this stuff and it just... I just got mad during the break thinking about it.
[01:25:36.502 --> 01:25:37.503]  Stop abusing me!
[01:25:38.063 --> 01:25:38.343]  Okay?
[01:25:38.623 --> 01:25:39.284]  Leave me alone!
[01:25:39.744 --> 01:25:40.645]  I got work to do!
[01:25:41.465 --> 01:25:45.408]  Let's go ahead and stop bringing people together to fight the New World Order!
[01:25:46.568 --> 01:25:46.769]  Damn!
[01:25:46.829 --> 01:25:50.731]  A little bit of righteous anger there, folks.
[01:25:50.851 --> 01:25:52.552]  James in Toronto, go ahead.
[01:25:53.573 --> 01:25:54.653]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:55.534]  Good sir, welcome.
[01:25:55.993 --> 01:25:57.053]  Love, love all your work.
[01:25:57.133 --> 01:26:04.355]  I'm an American from Connecticut living up here in Canada, and I have just a comment a little off topic of the Terry Shalvo stuff.
[01:26:04.815 --> 01:26:06.816]  I just wanted to say, you know, thanks for all your stuff.
[01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:10.477]  Reading, I've been watching four of your documentaries.
[01:26:10.557 --> 01:26:11.637]  I give them out to all my friends.
[01:26:11.657 --> 01:26:12.677]  We have The Martial Law.
[01:26:13.278 --> 01:26:18.599]  It's just very hard, you know, to get people interested in anything that's going on and get them to listen, and I wanted also to
[01:26:19.647 --> 01:26:27.579]  Just a comment on this documentary that one of my friends downloaded from Nova, Why Powers Fall or something, it's PBS and it was the same
[01:26:28.386 --> 01:26:31.927]  People that they had investigating have been investigating the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:32.747]  No, I know.
[01:26:32.807 --> 01:26:36.488]  I mean, they have, I think they've got like ten different TV programs I know of.
[01:26:37.028 --> 01:26:42.630]  Why the Towers Fell, Why the Towers Collapsed, all these different shows giving you the lie.
[01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:49.692]  Now they've changed all those official frauds to the North Tower hit seven and knocked the main support column down.
[01:26:50.313 --> 01:26:52.594]  The main tower didn't hit any of the building.
[01:26:52.914 --> 01:26:55.015]  It's main collapse didn't even hit the building.
[01:26:55.595 --> 01:26:56.916]  It caught fire later.
[01:26:57.436 --> 01:27:03.459]  And then the main support column fell from the blast points from the explosives and the penthouse fell.
[01:27:03.939 --> 01:27:06.740]  I mean, they just count on people not checking out the facts.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.522]  Yeah, and it's so hard just to get my friends and everyone to listen.
[01:27:10.582 --> 01:27:17.044]  And even anything, even with the boycott Gillette thing, even like I've switched now and should try to get people to switch and not using tongues and gimbals.
[01:27:17.124 --> 01:27:18.685]  Even just that is just so hard, you know?
[01:27:20.267 --> 01:27:40.238]  Well, it is hard, but listen, you're up in Canada where 15 million people, real nice folks in my experience, but really low to sleep, thinking everything's good, thinking their only problem is conservatives, and you've got all the arrest for people's speech, the gun control, and the people, look, as things get worse up there, folks will wake up, so you just keep it up.
[01:27:40.518 --> 01:27:42.079]  So you say you've seen martial law?
[01:27:42.639 --> 01:27:43.040]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.801]  I've seen the American dictator.
[01:27:45.888 --> 01:27:48.989]  Uh, Bohemian Grove, Police Case 2000, I love them all.
[01:27:49.009 --> 01:27:50.629]  They're absolutely amazing.
[01:27:50.690 --> 01:28:06.914]  And uh, my favorite part of, one of my favorite parts of American Dictator was when you're in the bar with that actor there, and those guys were just laughing at you, like, these guys are like school kid little punks, you know, like, not listening to anything, and you're just right in their face, and that was just so, you know, uplifting, and that was powerful, I really enjoyed it.
[01:28:06.934 --> 01:28:08.475]  Well then I got an email that said,
[01:28:09.224 --> 01:28:12.685]  That they could see a beer on one of the tables!
[01:28:13.165 --> 01:28:14.546]  How evil I am!
[01:28:16.226 --> 01:28:18.107]  Anything not to focus on real issues.
[01:28:18.887 --> 01:28:20.008]  No, and that wasn't a bar.
[01:28:20.048 --> 01:28:21.568]  That was at a comedy club.
[01:28:22.228 --> 01:28:26.490]  I was asked to give a speech about the New World Order, so I said, I'll come down and give a speech.
[01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:31.331]  I was invited there by Joe Rogan, of all people, and I was there trying to wake him up.
[01:28:32.212 --> 01:28:36.173]  You know, that's where followers and disciples of Christ are supposed to go.
[01:28:37.330 --> 01:28:38.911]  Uh, you know, where the center's on.
[01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:40.632]  I'll be right back.
[01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:44.494]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.975 --> 01:28:46.576]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.496 --> 01:28:50.178]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:55.871]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:59.972]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.292 --> 01:29:01.093]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.533 --> 01:29:05.634]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:10.056]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.436 --> 01:29:15.318]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:19.281]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.461 --> 01:29:24.806]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.086 --> 01:29:27.828]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.009]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:29:53.126 --> 01:29:54.747]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:54.887 --> 01:29:58.950]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:01.992]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.092 --> 01:30:08.817]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:08.977 --> 01:30:11.999]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.199 --> 01:30:14.601]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:14.721 --> 01:30:19.444]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:19.684 --> 01:30:34.193]  By Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.353 --> 01:30:40.917]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-4-9-1.

[01:30:54.873 --> 01:31:00.338]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.778 --> 01:31:05.002]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:12.289]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:18.775]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.815 --> 01:31:20.136]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.456 --> 01:31:23.397]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.557 --> 01:31:25.578]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:33.121]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.802]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:32:06.184 --> 01:32:16.152]  Alright, I'm going to cover some other news here for a few minutes, then we'll go right back to Mike and Ruben and David and Angela, is that right, in Connecticut?
[01:32:16.893 --> 01:32:23.859]  And Eric in Texas and others, and as soon as you hear one caller disconnect after their comments, you're free to call in.
[01:32:24.379 --> 01:32:26.561]  Unscreened, uncensored, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:26.601 --> 01:32:29.023]  But that doesn't mean I have to agree with you!
[01:32:29.063 --> 01:32:29.604]  Warning!
[01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:36.877]  We can defend our ideas here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:38.258 --> 01:32:41.161]  I try to call the national talk shows all the time, and I'm not driving around.
[01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:48.587]  I just can't help it, and I get on every once in a while, but usually it's, oh, well, no, you're too articulate and disagree with us.
[01:32:48.627 --> 01:32:52.891]  We want a left winger or a right winger to regurgitate the orthodoxy.
[01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:54.012]  You're not getting on.
[01:32:55.402 --> 01:33:00.806]  And I've done tests where, calling with some mindless points, and they'll get you right on, and then you shift gears.
[01:33:01.226 --> 01:33:05.169]  I've had the call screener take you off air and go, you said you were calling in with this view!
[01:33:05.969 --> 01:33:09.011]  Well, you little propagandists, I just got around you, didn't I?
[01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:14.896]  You don't have to do that here, folks, because I can defend my ideas.
[01:33:15.016 --> 01:33:15.736]  I live this.
[01:33:15.816 --> 01:33:16.477]  I study this.
[01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:17.758]  This is what I do.
[01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:19.999]  I am driven.
[01:33:20.319 --> 01:33:21.260]  Far beyond driven.
[01:33:22.674 --> 01:33:36.798]  Alright, I want to get into just... There's so much news here, it's just ridiculous, but um... Before I get into this news, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[01:33:38.819 --> 01:33:41.940]  And the video is two hours, thirty-five minutes long.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.421]  It's really three films in one, when you get Martial Law on VHS.
[01:33:46.441 --> 01:33:48.862]  You now have the DVD.
[01:33:50.868 --> 01:33:52.409]  I started offering it yesterday.
[01:33:52.449 --> 01:34:06.942]  I mean, the DVDs have been made, and the thousands of copies I got made are being, today, put in the packages, and having the color cover, and having the stamp put on the top, you know, the, uh, on the top of the disc, and being put in the packages and shrink-wrapped.
[01:34:07.702 --> 01:34:10.104]  And, uh, so we'll take delivery of them tomorrow.
[01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.746]  And I'm sorry they're made in the USA.
[01:34:12.786 --> 01:34:14.028]  I didn't get these made in New Jersey.
[01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.249]  I had them made right here in Austin.
[01:34:15.269 --> 01:34:16.710]  So, I know that's bad.
[01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:17.811]  They're made in America, too.
[01:34:19.182 --> 01:34:19.562]  All of them.
[01:34:19.582 --> 01:34:20.323]  The disc, everything.
[01:34:20.383 --> 01:34:21.143]  The packaging.
[01:34:22.644 --> 01:34:23.504]  Again, I'm extremist.
[01:34:23.964 --> 01:34:26.666]  The water filters we promote here are also made in America.
[01:34:26.866 --> 01:34:30.387]  The DVDs, we take delivery of them to Mars.
[01:34:30.407 --> 01:34:31.728]  You can go ahead and order them if you want.
[01:34:32.348 --> 01:34:35.690]  They'll be shipped out to you on Monday next week.
[01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:37.571]  They'll be shipping next week.
[01:34:39.211 --> 01:34:42.873]  So I hope that you'll order the DVD right now. $25.95.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:35:02.009]  Over three hours long, it's a little over three hours long, and the extras on the video, you know, we get into the police state, we get into 9-11 like no other film does, covering how the globalists carry the attacks out, we answer the questions, we go to Ground Zero, Building 7, it's all covered.
[01:35:02.069 --> 01:35:13.856]  Then, the death cult, the Satanists, they're not Jews, they're not Catholics, they're not Protestants, they're not Chinese, they're devil worshippers that control the Zionist groups and the mafia groups and the
[01:35:14.957 --> 01:35:17.698]  The white supremacist groups, it's all controlled by the globalists.
[01:35:17.718 --> 01:35:20.399]  We document it from their own words, their own documents.
[01:35:21.179 --> 01:35:23.941]  The third part is a whole hour long.
[01:35:24.361 --> 01:35:28.902]  We expose Schwarzenegger in the extras that you get on the DVD.
[01:35:30.103 --> 01:35:37.326]  One part of it is our trip around Manhattan in a cigarette boat with giant twin engines being chased by the Coast Guard.
[01:35:37.346 --> 01:35:40.947]  Of course, we stopped for them and then they told us to go and then chase us again.
[01:35:42.047 --> 01:35:43.848]  That's just interesting, flat interesting.
[01:35:44.478 --> 01:35:46.198]  That's like six or seven minutes.
[01:35:46.218 --> 01:35:55.741]  And then there's about a ten minute segment on torture, where we detail from the actual government documents how bad the torture really is and how the media is promoting it.
[01:35:55.761 --> 01:35:56.721]  A little mini documentary.
[01:35:56.741 --> 01:36:04.323]  And then we spend about another, I don't know, long period of time, not too long, on the UN and their population control agenda.
[01:36:04.343 --> 01:36:09.444]  And then we spend a few minutes about predicting there in New York that Bush would be elected and why.
[01:36:10.966 --> 01:36:12.667]  And we get into that and talk to some locals.
[01:36:13.028 --> 01:36:23.274]  So about 25 minutes, well not about, 25 and a half minutes of extras making the DVD 3 hours and like 35 seconds long.
[01:36:24.895 --> 01:36:31.119]  I guess counting the black between some of the segments it's more like 3 hours and 1 minute long.
[01:36:31.139 --> 01:36:32.600]  You want to be really precise.
[01:36:33.041 --> 01:36:34.141]  That's how long it is.
[01:36:35.974 --> 01:36:36.975]  I'm really proud of this.
[01:36:37.015 --> 01:36:40.618]  It's my best work and it'll be devastating to the New World Order.
[01:36:41.279 --> 01:36:47.905]  But no one will see it, no one will know about it, if I over the next year, you know, just sell a couple thousand copies.
[01:36:49.886 --> 01:36:53.329]  You need to get those copies and make copies of those.
[01:36:54.611 --> 01:36:56.092]  You need to make a lot of copies, folks.
[01:36:56.172 --> 01:36:57.613]  I mean, calling all patriots.
[01:36:57.733 --> 01:37:01.577]  Get them, make copies, give them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:37:02.724 --> 01:37:03.885]  Put them on AXS TV.
[01:37:03.965 --> 01:37:04.945]  Show them at your college.
[01:37:05.025 --> 01:37:06.046]  It's my best work.
[01:37:06.426 --> 01:37:07.787]  It is professionally produced.
[01:37:08.307 --> 01:37:09.147]  Order it today.
[01:37:09.227 --> 01:37:10.348]  Toll free number to order.

[01:37:11.228 --> 01:37:12.109]  Again, that number.
[01:37:12.349 --> 01:37:14.150]  Get your pens and paper ready.
[01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:14.210]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:15.891]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones.

[01:37:41.793 --> 01:37:51.920]  Watch clips of the film, read about the different specials, all the other great videos and books we carry, 888-253-3139 or you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, watch all 12 of my films, try to hurry up and
[01:37:58.346 --> 01:38:00.088]  I stopped pronunciating properly.
[01:38:00.368 --> 01:38:02.690]  You can see all 12 of my films.
[01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:04.151]  Read my book online.
[01:38:04.191 --> 01:38:05.232]  Print copies of it off.
[01:38:05.552 --> 01:38:08.334]  Read Paul Watson's 300 plus page book online.
[01:38:08.694 --> 01:38:10.276]  Other books we've been authorized to post.
[01:38:10.396 --> 01:38:13.378]  Other films we've been authorized to post on the website.
[01:38:14.419 --> 01:38:15.880]  And my weekly TV show.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.522]  Many weeks, two shows a week.
[01:38:17.562 --> 01:38:18.783]  But always one show a week.
[01:38:20.221 --> 01:38:21.922]  Lots of other video specials I do.
[01:38:22.862 --> 01:38:25.183]  All of my best audio interviews from the radio show.
[01:38:25.223 --> 01:38:26.224]  Special text reports.
[01:38:26.684 --> 01:38:31.106]  It is just amazing what you get for 15 cents a day monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:38:31.686 --> 01:38:32.526]  Why did we do this?
[01:38:34.027 --> 01:38:36.348]  Because I was going to go bankrupt.
[01:38:37.008 --> 01:38:39.129]  I could not have millions of people hitting the site.
[01:38:40.249 --> 01:38:41.210]  All of it for free.
[01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:42.250]  Watching the films.
[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:43.571]  Posting all the films for free.
[01:38:45.333 --> 01:38:51.075]  And then getting four, five, and some months, six, one month, even more, thousand-dollar bandwidth bills.
[01:38:51.275 --> 01:38:54.216]  What I do is I still offer about half the stuff for free.
[01:38:55.437 --> 01:39:00.358]  You know, we'll put half a video up there for free and then go, okay, if you want the other half, can you give us 15 cents, please?
[01:39:00.899 --> 01:39:12.763]  And it's really been nice because I've been able to give some of my employees slight raises, and I've been able to hire another webmaster to even expand what we do.
[01:39:13.897 --> 01:39:16.739]  And it's been somewhat successful.
[01:39:16.799 --> 01:39:19.141]  If it was more successful, we could do more.
[01:39:20.282 --> 01:39:22.424]  But right now, it's just pulling its own weight.
[01:39:22.884 --> 01:39:24.005]  Which is why I had to do it.
[01:39:24.485 --> 01:39:26.046]  And I want to thank those that have subscribed.
[01:39:27.287 --> 01:39:29.009]  But bandwidth is expensive.
[01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:32.071]  Let's... Okay, that's enough.
[01:39:32.571 --> 01:39:34.113]  Let's get into the news.
[01:39:35.073 --> 01:39:36.294]  Here in the Mungo Stretcher calls.
[01:39:36.354 --> 01:39:37.315]  More on Terry Schiavo.
[01:39:37.395 --> 01:39:38.856]  Of course, he died a few hours ago.
[01:39:39.637 --> 01:39:42.479]  After three hours short of 14 days of torture.
[01:39:45.601 --> 01:39:51.629]  And CBSNews.com had a draft of Shia Labeouf's obituary found on the internet a few days ago.
[01:39:51.649 --> 01:40:03.745]  Just like CBS News had a draft of the Iraq invasion beforehand, ABC News has posted election results nationwide with precise, you know, 100% accuracy on elections.
[01:40:04.722 --> 01:40:07.823]  Even at state level, showing you how staged it is, but this is the latest.
[01:40:08.364 --> 01:40:15.787]  A draft of CBSnews.com's obituary for Terry Schiavo mistakenly appeared on the internet for a few hours, the network official said Wednesday.
[01:40:16.207 --> 01:40:27.591]  The incomplete story did not appear on the network's website, but it could be found by an internet search engine because it was inadvertently saved in an online file, said CBSnews.com News Director Mike Sims.
[01:40:28.132 --> 01:40:28.872]  Sims said the draft
[01:40:29.512 --> 01:40:34.994]  It was saved late Monday and removed a few hours later after the error was identified early Tuesday.
[01:40:35.634 --> 01:40:37.675]  It should have been saved offline.
[01:40:38.055 --> 01:40:39.716]  We certainly do feel bad about that.
[01:40:39.776 --> 01:40:44.977]  Sim said the story was posted on the website for radio talk show host Glenn Beck.
[01:40:45.678 --> 01:40:48.439]  Talk about a neocon sniveler.
[01:40:48.519 --> 01:40:53.020]  News outlets routinely prepare obituaries in advance and hold them until the death.
[01:40:56.161 --> 01:40:58.122]  I've got to write an obituary for this poor lady.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.624]  But she's out of her pain, out of her torture.
[01:41:02.087 --> 01:41:05.053]  She went through more than our special forces captured by the Viet Cong.
[01:41:06.756 --> 01:41:09.783]  A question, if Terry couldn't feel pain, why did they give her morphine?
[01:41:10.752 --> 01:41:11.553]  AP's snippet.
[01:41:12.093 --> 01:41:16.176]  Carpenter also disagrees with the characterization of Shivo as in a persistent vegetative state.
[01:41:16.476 --> 01:41:26.784]  He says the doctors who've said that she's known pro-euthanasia doctors, and he questions why Shivo has been given morphine since people in vegetative states can't feel pain.
[01:41:27.224 --> 01:41:31.527]  If Terry is a vegetative state and can't feel pain, then why are they injecting morphine into the vegetable?
[01:41:32.139 --> 01:41:41.365]  This evening, the O'Reilly Factor featured another doctor who assured us that starvation, a war crime banned by the Geneva Convention and by the Constitution, was perfectly peaceful.
[01:41:41.405 --> 01:41:47.229]  O'Reilly, who favors killing Terry, didn't challenge the statement that she was a vegetative state despite volumes of evidence at the Conference.
[01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:50.531]  But she'll still call me and tell me how great he is.
[01:41:52.052 --> 01:41:54.873]  Please don't call me anymore telling me how great O'Reilly is, okay?
[01:41:54.933 --> 01:41:57.315]  I'm gonna probably vomit on you, another one of these phonies.
[01:42:00.644 --> 01:42:01.848]  Let's just go back to calls.
[01:42:01.888 --> 01:42:03.855]  I've got a bunch of global news here in front of me.
[01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:08.137]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:42:08.177 --> 01:42:08.898]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:42:09.178 --> 01:42:10.379]  Yeah, Alex, great show.
[01:42:10.439 --> 01:42:20.186]  I just wanted to ask you, Alex, what do you think is the... aside from the money that Mr. Schiavo got, what would have been the motive behind why he would want to have his wife murdered?
[01:42:20.206 --> 01:42:22.048]  Do you think it's because he may have been abusive to her?
[01:42:22.128 --> 01:42:25.971]  And the other question I have, Alex, is they were talking about a local radio station this morning.
[01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:27.932]  I'm not promoting this, Alex.
[01:42:27.972 --> 01:42:28.713]  I'm a Christian man.
[01:42:28.733 --> 01:42:29.453]  I don't promote death.
[01:42:29.514 --> 01:42:32.336]  I don't promote... I'm like Christ that has turned the other cheek.
[01:42:33.076 --> 01:42:40.403]  I do feel sorry, and I would be really scared if I was Michael Scheibel, because there are a lot of extremists, people out there that go to abortion clinics and kill the doctors that are aborting babies.
[01:42:40.843 --> 01:42:42.785]  He should watch out for his wife and look behind his door.
[01:42:42.805 --> 01:42:48.730]  There were a lot of extremists that paratrooped into Nazi Germany, and they were bad.
[01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:50.272]  They should have just let Hitler keep doing it.
[01:42:50.652 --> 01:42:52.474]  Fighting people that kill babies is wrong.
[01:42:53.955 --> 01:42:54.836]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:54.856 --> 01:42:56.237]  You understand I was being sarcastic?
[01:42:56.257 --> 01:42:56.817]  I understand.
[01:42:58.141 --> 01:43:04.265]  Uh, but what do you think was his motive behind wanting his, uh, there's been a lot of stories that he was abusive to her, even when they had a marriage before this happened to her.
[01:43:04.725 --> 01:43:14.791]  And maybe, maybe if he figured she ever came out of her so-called vegetative state, she could testify against him, uh, if he was abusive to her, and maybe he's the one that caused her to get into that situation.
[01:43:15.211 --> 01:43:20.194]  Um, they claim that nobody was around except her husband when, when she had this collapse 15 years ago.
[01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:21.075]  I hear you.
[01:43:21.135 --> 01:43:22.816]  Let me comment on that, and let me be clear.
[01:43:23.577 --> 01:43:27.539]  I'm not advocating people to go into abortion clinics and blow doctors and nurses' heads off.
[01:43:28.567 --> 01:43:30.967]  You really can't call them doctors and nurses.
[01:43:31.027 --> 01:43:34.028]  Call them technicians of infanticide.
[01:43:35.268 --> 01:43:37.529]  But why aren't I for it?
[01:43:37.569 --> 01:43:39.209]  Because it plays in the globalist's hands.
[01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:42.669]  Christ said everything he said in context.
[01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:45.150]  I mean, he went in and whipped the money changers.
[01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:46.370]  He told people to buy swords.
[01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.451]  He said stand up against evil governments.
[01:43:49.451 --> 01:43:52.271]  Everything was in the context when he told these parables.
[01:43:54.252 --> 01:43:56.572]  When he gave these analogies.
[01:43:57.869 --> 01:44:02.713]  And turning the other cheek, there's a time and a place for everything.
[01:44:02.793 --> 01:44:10.298]  A time to weep, a time to die, a time to love, a time to... What part of the Bible is that out of?
[01:44:10.358 --> 01:44:12.979]  I love those verses I was paraphrasing.
[01:44:12.999 --> 01:44:13.900]  I know it wasn't Christ.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.241]  Is it Psalms?
[01:44:15.301 --> 01:44:16.382]  I don't think it's Psalms.
[01:44:16.402 --> 01:44:17.002]  It's something else.
[01:44:17.623 --> 01:44:19.524]  That long, a time for this, a time for that.
[01:44:21.685 --> 01:44:25.047]  But turning the other cheek is like Gandhi.
[01:44:26.557 --> 01:44:30.559]  And I'm not comparing Gandhi to Christ, but what he did was effective.
[01:44:30.579 --> 01:44:38.842]  I'm not a Hindu, folks, but Gandhi, as Paul Watson likes to quote him, said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:44:39.982 --> 01:44:45.745]  If there are cameras on it, the government really, it was a blow against them at Waco.
[01:44:46.285 --> 01:44:47.105]  The truth came out.
[01:44:49.686 --> 01:44:51.427]  Killing Terry is going to be a blow against them.
[01:44:52.779 --> 01:44:59.083]  And if somebody went in there and splattered a bunch of people, that would have really made the pro-death forces get what they wanted.
[01:44:59.823 --> 01:45:11.891]  So you've got to look at things in a three-dimensional political calculation, and then state the moral thing to do, and the right thing to do, and then also look at what that effect's going to be.
[01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:15.573]  You have to use discernment and judgment on a case-by-case basis.
[01:45:17.194 --> 01:45:19.876]  I mean, they pull off a couple more Waco's and a couple more Terry's,
[01:45:20.772 --> 01:45:27.878]  They're going to wake up the whole country and then we can move on to other phases of things.
[01:45:27.898 --> 01:45:31.221]  To put it lightly, and you can figure out what I'm saying.
[01:45:33.342 --> 01:45:35.624]  Again, you've got to be as, what is it?
[01:45:37.706 --> 01:45:46.213]  As wise as a serpent and peaceful as a dove, but walk easy and walk quietly and carry a big stick.
[01:45:48.206 --> 01:45:50.807]  I mean, I'm the first person that will defend this country defensively.
[01:45:51.787 --> 01:45:53.468]  I'm not putting up with people going to camps.
[01:45:53.528 --> 01:45:55.848]  I'm not putting up with much more of an acceleration of this.
[01:45:56.588 --> 01:45:58.649]  But I know the most effective thing is the pen.
[01:45:59.129 --> 01:46:00.069]  It's mightier than the sword.
[01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:03.670]  And in today's world, where most people don't read, it is talk radio.
[01:46:03.891 --> 01:46:04.651]  It is TV.
[01:46:05.011 --> 01:46:05.711]  It is videos.
[01:46:06.451 --> 01:46:07.912]  And it's war, folks.
[01:46:07.992 --> 01:46:09.092]  I use my weapon, the truth.
[01:46:10.112 --> 01:46:15.594]  But, you know, I wouldn't want to be Michael... Folks, you reap what you sow.
[01:46:16.849 --> 01:46:18.871]  The bastardization of it is karma.
[01:46:19.311 --> 01:46:22.794]  I don't believe in karma, but I do believe in you reap what you sow.
[01:46:22.855 --> 01:46:30.742]  I mean, what you plant, what you throw out of your sowing bag, the seeds you throw out onto the ground, is what you're going to get.
[01:46:32.543 --> 01:46:35.406]  And I tell you, the bad things I've done in my life, it's come back on me.
[01:46:36.101 --> 01:46:42.266]  And the better I am to people, the nicer I am, the more I don't compromise.
[01:46:42.386 --> 01:46:44.608]  When I don't sell out, I always get rewarded.
[01:46:44.728 --> 01:46:47.450]  I hope I don't get tested like Job.
[01:46:49.151 --> 01:46:51.973]  But I can't say what I do under that?
[01:46:52.053 --> 01:46:53.615]  Well, I can't say what I do under that.
[01:46:54.595 --> 01:46:55.736]  I wouldn't blame God for anything.
[01:46:56.657 --> 01:46:58.358]  Whatever God does, God does.
[01:46:58.378 --> 01:46:59.959]  There are laws in this universe.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.202]  There are laws of cause and effect.
[01:47:04.301 --> 01:47:06.083]  Every action equal greater reaction.
[01:47:06.863 --> 01:47:09.185]  And people say, well that's science Alex, not God.
[01:47:09.205 --> 01:47:13.869]  Well no, God set up the laws of the universe.
[01:47:13.909 --> 01:47:15.370]  The evidence of God is everywhere.
[01:47:15.931 --> 01:47:20.534]  To me there's no argument between science and spirituality and being a Christian.
[01:47:21.555 --> 01:47:29.421]  Foolish Christians allow themselves to get into debates with scientists who are occultists or who are agnostic.
[01:47:29.502 --> 01:47:31.223]  Again, that's a three-dimensional argument.
[01:47:31.787 --> 01:47:34.149]  You're looking at it two-dimensionally, you fall into these traps.
[01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:51.041]  Instead of coming up with the actual debates and prose and factually based rhetoric that will defeat them and unify the political field instead of vulcanizing it further.
[01:47:51.421 --> 01:48:00.027]  We're like computers given false information to the point of we almost can't even communicate with each other anymore because everything's being rearranged and things are being given new definitions.
[01:48:00.555 --> 01:48:04.458]  We get back to the 11th issue edition of Ingsoc from 1984.
[01:48:04.518 --> 01:48:07.320]  You've got to read it to know what I'm talking about.
[01:48:10.262 --> 01:48:18.468]  I don't want to sit here and diatribe and babble all day, rant incessantly, but I mean, these are important points.
[01:48:19.829 --> 01:48:21.370]  But I wouldn't want to be Michael.
[01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:24.532]  I mean, look, these people that do evil things, they're very unhappy.
[01:48:25.253 --> 01:48:26.634]  And so they get more into their
[01:48:29.275 --> 01:48:30.475]  They get deeper into evil.
[01:48:30.695 --> 01:48:34.156]  Their minds get given over to their most base instincts.
[01:48:34.596 --> 01:48:35.997]  And they get more and more unhappy.
[01:48:36.817 --> 01:48:37.697]  It's like a gambler.
[01:48:38.237 --> 01:48:39.817]  Well, I spend $100 a week.
[01:48:39.837 --> 01:48:41.078]  I'm not saying I do, folks.
[01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:41.758]  It's just an example.
[01:48:42.578 --> 01:48:47.839]  I spend $100 a week on the lottery, so I've got to stay in it and spend even more, because I've got to win!
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.620]  It's the same thing with these evil people.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.340]  They're totally unhappy.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.281]  Whereas I could be killed by the New World Order any day, but I'm just totally happy.
[01:48:57.907 --> 01:49:03.630]  I'm just totally energized, and life is incredible, and every moment is amazing, and I just wish I could do more.
[01:49:05.531 --> 01:49:06.712]  My cup runneth over.
[01:49:08.673 --> 01:49:10.214]  My spirit is stronger than ever.
[01:49:13.456 --> 01:49:14.056]  Thank you, God.
[01:49:14.216 --> 01:49:15.877]  Thank you for showing me what the New World Order was.
[01:49:15.897 --> 01:49:18.979]  Thank you for making me see the painful facts.
[01:49:19.359 --> 01:49:19.760]  Thank you.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.942]  Thank you for helping me.
[01:49:23.902 --> 01:49:25.323]  And thank you for the tribulations.
[01:49:25.962 --> 01:49:27.503]  Thank you for the test I've been through.
[01:49:27.543 --> 01:49:27.923]  Thank you.
[01:49:28.083 --> 01:49:30.044]  And if more are coming, that is your will.
[01:49:30.605 --> 01:49:30.985]  Thank you.
[01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:33.386]  I'm just thankful.
[01:49:34.026 --> 01:49:34.907]  I'm thankful for life.
[01:49:34.927 --> 01:49:36.548]  I mean, I mean to talk about this more on the show.
[01:49:36.608 --> 01:49:39.729]  I just... It's so fulfilling.
[01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:43.631]  And if one day I sit there with them torturing me to death, that will be fulfilling.
[01:49:44.892 --> 01:49:47.413]  You know, at that point, I forgive them.
[01:49:48.814 --> 01:49:49.234]  I love them.
[01:49:50.155 --> 01:49:52.036]  Love is stronger than hate.
[01:49:53.456 --> 01:49:57.803]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.983 --> 01:50:02.410]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:06.937]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.977 --> 01:50:08.339]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.101 --> 01:50:14.342]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.402 --> 01:50:21.325]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.445 --> 01:50:23.446]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.326 --> 01:50:34.274]  Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.454 --> 01:50:39.838]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.132 --> 01:50:58.354]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.494 --> 01:51:06.597]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.837 --> 01:51:13.899]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.079 --> 01:51:15.360]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:21.345]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.525 --> 01:51:26.629]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.729 --> 01:51:35.617]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:35.877 --> 01:51:39.179]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:53:01.232 --> 01:53:02.992]  Hell is being released upon us.
[01:53:03.732 --> 01:53:05.253]  The mass psyche is being warped.
[01:53:05.273 --> 01:53:12.494]  I don't mean to get, uh, you know, religious on you here, but they just murdered this woman.
[01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:16.135]  But God did say vengeance is mine.
[01:53:17.535 --> 01:53:28.797]  And, uh, I mean, my only point is these people punish themselves, their system punishes them, and, I mean, believe me, you think you're mad at Michael Schiavo and the other cockroaches around him?
[01:53:29.557 --> 01:53:30.477]  Believe me, God
[01:53:31.577 --> 01:53:38.082]  And his force, God's force is all around us.
[01:53:38.102 --> 01:53:42.905]  I'm not quoting Star Wars folks, I mean God's spirit, God's will is all around us.
[01:53:43.806 --> 01:53:45.647]  And he gives these people over to evil.
[01:53:48.829 --> 01:53:50.730]  So look out!
[01:53:52.171 --> 01:53:54.513]  These people are so unhappy, they're already in hell.
[01:53:55.931 --> 01:53:56.731]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:53:56.771 --> 01:54:01.232]  Let's talk to Ruben in Ohio, then Angela, Eric, Robert, Tim, and others.
[01:54:01.252 --> 01:54:01.893]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[01:54:02.273 --> 01:54:02.713]  Hey, thanks.
[01:54:02.833 --> 01:54:04.093]  I've got a whole bunch of questions.
[01:54:04.153 --> 01:54:06.994]  I'm just going to keep firing them off until you hang up on me.
[01:54:07.754 --> 01:54:08.974]  First of all, when is your birthday?
[01:54:10.495 --> 01:54:17.156]  Well, you know, it's not any secret info, but I tend to not want to give my birthday out so people can... Okay, I respect that.
[01:54:17.176 --> 01:54:18.577]  I don't know what the point is.
[01:54:18.597 --> 01:54:20.217]  I was born in February of 1974.
[01:54:20.297 --> 01:54:20.957]  February what day?
[01:54:24.825 --> 01:54:25.865]  Just that's enough, man.
[01:54:26.205 --> 01:54:26.465]  Okay.
[01:54:26.525 --> 01:54:28.406]  Alright, because I study astrology.
[01:54:28.426 --> 01:54:29.546]  This is my home address, I mean.
[01:54:29.606 --> 01:54:30.646]  No, no, Alex.
[01:54:31.247 --> 01:54:32.267]  Relax, my brother.
[01:54:32.347 --> 01:54:33.287]  I'm one of your... No, I know.
[01:54:33.347 --> 01:54:36.208]  I just... I'm one of your warriors out here in Ohio, brother.
[01:54:36.228 --> 01:54:36.408]  I know.
[01:54:36.428 --> 01:54:37.528]  I'm not trying to get your face.
[01:54:37.588 --> 01:54:40.429]  I just... You know, people can do stuff with your birthday.
[01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:41.389]  They should.
[01:54:41.529 --> 01:54:41.949]  Absolutely.
[01:54:41.969 --> 01:54:43.329]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.890]  Next question.
[01:54:45.150 --> 01:54:47.210]  First guy I ever voted for was Ross Perot.
[01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:48.991]  What do you think of him?
[01:54:49.171 --> 01:54:49.751]  Good, bad?
[01:54:49.811 --> 01:54:50.211]  Side of angels?
[01:54:51.263 --> 01:54:51.824]  Controlled.
[01:54:52.184 --> 01:54:53.245]  He was controlled, okay.
[01:54:53.305 --> 01:54:53.605]  Yes.
[01:54:53.965 --> 01:54:57.008]  Next question, Dennis Kucinich, what do you think of him?
[01:54:59.230 --> 01:55:04.294]  Loose cannon, controlled by his own worldview, does some good things, does some bad things.
[01:55:04.975 --> 01:55:05.315]  Okay.
[01:55:06.196 --> 01:55:15.884]  I heard Art Bell say he was a libertarian, and I later heard him say that he voted for Kerry, which I felt was strange.
[01:55:16.545 --> 01:55:18.827]  Is it okay if I find out who you voted for?
[01:55:20.095 --> 01:55:31.683]  Uh, well, you really must know I didn't vote because I went and observed the voting and I didn't vote presidentially, let's put it that way, because I didn't see the candidates I was being given a choice of.
[01:55:31.743 --> 01:55:33.004]  All we had was Kerry and Bush.
[01:55:33.865 --> 01:55:35.566]  But there were other candidates on the ballot.
[01:55:35.606 --> 01:55:39.889]  Yeah, I supported Michael Perutka and I told people to vote for him if I would have been able to vote for him.
[01:55:40.549 --> 01:55:42.050]  Okay, I don't fully understand that vote.
[01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:43.111]  Constitution Party.
[01:55:43.627 --> 01:55:45.448]  Oh, you voted for the Constitution Party.
[01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:49.431]  But, I mean, I protested and said this isn't a real election.
[01:55:49.451 --> 01:55:53.254]  Alright, because, you know, you are... Okay, that doesn't... Let me be clear.
[01:55:53.394 --> 01:55:57.737]  I said that in Travis County we don't have real voting because of the electronic voting machines.
[01:55:57.797 --> 01:55:58.857]  I still went down there.
[01:55:58.877 --> 01:55:59.418]  Oh, I see.
[01:55:59.458 --> 01:56:00.739]  But it isn't a real vote.
[01:56:01.239 --> 01:56:03.741]  And I just wanted to see how it all was running and operating.
[01:56:04.241 --> 01:56:04.461]  I see.
[01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:09.405]  Alright, did I hear you say on Coast to Coast one time that you were doing a film with Keanu Reeves?
[01:56:10.225 --> 01:56:10.485]  Yes.
[01:56:11.666 --> 01:56:12.667]  Could you elaborate on that?
[01:56:13.891 --> 01:56:16.093]  You know, I'm not even going to get into it until the movie comes out.
[01:56:16.313 --> 01:56:17.554]  Okay, I understand that.
[01:56:17.894 --> 01:56:22.438]  And did I just hear you say a little bit sooner that Joel Rogan asked you to speak about the New World Order?
[01:56:23.078 --> 01:56:23.339]  Yes.
[01:56:23.759 --> 01:56:25.180]  The guy from Fear Factor?
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.242]  Yeah, but that was five years ago, that footage that's in that film, yeah.
[01:56:28.723 --> 01:56:29.343]  Oh, five years ago.
[01:56:29.363 --> 01:56:30.784]  Joe's gone completely off the deep end.
[01:56:31.205 --> 01:56:41.373]  Okay, just before the spring started, Clint Eastwood won a bunch of awards for his picture, Million Dollar Baby, and now we have Terry Shivo.
[01:56:42.043 --> 01:56:45.805]  It's all pretty clear what's going on.
[01:56:45.825 --> 01:56:50.928]  I hear it's a terrible film with a terrible moral and I don't want to... I haven't seen it.
[01:56:51.148 --> 01:56:52.169]  Here's my connection though.
[01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:55.151]  Clint Eastwood is a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:55.351 --> 01:56:55.891]  Yes, he is.
[01:56:56.752 --> 01:57:01.494]  Now, he beat out Michael Scorsese, right?
[01:57:01.755 --> 01:57:02.695]  For The Aviator.
[01:57:02.735 --> 01:57:03.776]  Which I thought was excellent.
[01:57:04.196 --> 01:57:05.016]  The Aviator, right?
[01:57:05.277 --> 01:57:05.977]  Yeah, it was a good movie.
[01:57:06.317 --> 01:57:08.518]  Now, let me get your opinion on Howard Hughes.
[01:57:08.879 --> 01:57:11.040]  Howard Hughes, because after watching that movie,
[01:57:12.138 --> 01:57:15.101]  He was fighting the one world government, it looked like this.
[01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:18.203]  They wanted one airline for the United States.
[01:57:18.243 --> 01:57:21.866]  Well, he wasn't really, and he got in with the CIA, and he's a sad case too.
[01:57:22.206 --> 01:57:23.127]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[01:57:23.147 --> 01:57:26.790]  It was nice being under the Inquisition, and I enjoyed the questions.
[01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:35.196]  We'll be right back with a third hour, and we'll go to Angela and Eric and Robert and so many others.
[01:57:35.696 --> 01:57:37.338]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:57:37.358 --> 01:57:37.778]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.385 --> 01:57:44.047]  Hello, folks!
[01:57:45.009 --> 01:57:46.111]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.073 --> 01:57:52.114]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.834 --> 01:57:53.935]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.595 --> 01:57:55.436]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.176 --> 01:57:57.077]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.577 --> 01:58:01.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.919 --> 01:58:06.062]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.223 --> 01:58:16.688]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:17.927 --> 01:58:21.130]  We're now 30 seconds into hour number 3.
[01:58:21.171 --> 01:58:24.014]  40 seconds into hour number 3 now.
[01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:28.198]  And it's wide open telephones, kind of open line Thursday.
[01:58:28.298 --> 01:58:31.141]  Any issue you want to discuss, any news item, any topic.
[01:58:31.602 --> 01:58:36.367]  Later, Prison Planet Info Wars websites, staple of 911 college course.
[01:58:37.107 --> 01:58:39.450]  College course is called 911 the Road to Tyranny.
[01:58:41.407 --> 01:58:44.149]  Britain's plan to save the planet from quakes and asteroids.
[01:58:44.169 --> 01:58:45.190]  This is the Times of London.
[01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:49.152]  While kids die, Muslim clerics call vaccines a U.S.
[01:58:49.232 --> 01:58:49.592]  plot.
[01:58:49.973 --> 01:58:50.973]  Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:58:51.594 --> 01:58:53.595]  Well, they aren't calling it a plot.
[01:58:53.655 --> 01:58:58.858]  It's mainstream news over there that they're putting different toxins and pathogens in the vaccines.
[01:58:59.439 --> 01:59:00.860]  Nobel laureates have gone public.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.461]  They've tested it and caught them.
[01:59:03.061 --> 01:59:03.501]  A U.N.
[01:59:03.541 --> 01:59:04.302]  controlled Internet.
[01:59:04.342 --> 01:59:05.162]  I want to cover this.
[01:59:05.402 --> 01:59:06.143]  Very serious.
[01:59:07.546 --> 01:59:32.635]  and uh... removal of three from bush visit pro don't talk more about this fbi demands logs from radical website confused cops sworn woman after birth she she couldn't get to the hospital had a baby in her car and they didn't know how to respond so they pointed guns at her and told her to get out of the car and then another doctor two blocks from a hospital going ten miles over the speed limit told the cop look I'm a doctor I'm in my outfit I gotta go
[01:59:33.306 --> 01:59:33.706]  Thank you.
[01:59:33.726 --> 01:59:34.787]  Thank you so much.
[01:59:34.827 --> 01:59:38.989]  And blessings to you and your lineage a thousand, a thousand times because we are in Skull and Bones territory.
[01:59:39.029 --> 01:59:40.390]  I'm not very far from New Haven.
[02:00:00.467 --> 02:00:03.808]  And I've truly spent time with my partner who's a chiropractor.
[02:00:04.308 --> 02:00:14.991]  We're both professionals and studying your work purposely because we're inundated around here, unbelievably so, with the elitists.
[02:00:15.892 --> 02:00:18.352]  And I want to share with you a couple of things.
[02:00:18.452 --> 02:00:23.214]  First of all, I lost three friends, two friends and a cousin in 9-11.
[02:00:23.814 --> 02:00:26.915]  My family has been truly given
[02:00:27.719 --> 02:00:31.660]  Relief with your information about what truly happened at 9-11.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.960]  So I thank you for that.
[02:00:33.821 --> 02:00:36.341]  Because we knew something was radically wrong.
[02:00:37.081 --> 02:00:41.563]  My cousin, who was the Senior Vice President, Cantor Fitzgerald, was lost in that.
[02:00:42.223 --> 02:00:45.103]  And you are... Let me just say this real quick, because you bring up a good thing.
[02:00:45.123 --> 02:00:46.204]  Thank you for the kind words.
[02:00:47.264 --> 02:00:50.665]  People think the truth's gonna hurt, but everybody deep down knows something's wrong.
[02:00:50.705 --> 02:00:52.285]  It feels better to know the truth.
[02:00:52.325 --> 02:00:52.705]  Go ahead.
[02:00:52.785 --> 02:00:53.005]  Yes.
[02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:53.906]  Yes.
[02:00:54.586 --> 02:00:55.326]  It does, truly.
[02:00:55.845 --> 02:00:57.066]  I feel better to know the truth.
[02:00:57.346 --> 02:01:02.769]  I have always believed I'm a psychotherapist for over 26 years and believe the truth will set you free.
[02:01:02.929 --> 02:01:10.814]  Often you first have to throw up because it can be so revolting to actually feel it and hear it but it really is the truth.
[02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:16.277]  So thank you so much and we have purchased your films and we in fact listen to you every day.
[02:01:16.297 --> 02:01:22.961]  There isn't a day that goes by that we really don't listen to you because you are so filled with such vibration and such
[02:01:26.333 --> 02:01:42.118]  I've been asked to address the UN on Earth Day and this is really very important because the information that you bring and have brought to me and my partner, I'm going to be doing some sharing at that level and it should be quite a stirring
[02:01:42.996 --> 02:01:44.517]  address that I'll be doing there.
[02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:45.518]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:45.538 --> 02:01:45.998]  Thank you.
[02:01:46.038 --> 02:01:46.619]  I mean, I'm honored.
[02:01:46.639 --> 02:01:53.243]  I better do a better job of all these people paying attention to the show, but also when you do address those people, obviously the UN is like anything else.
[02:01:53.763 --> 02:02:03.750]  It's filled with people who want to do good, who are compartmentalized, just like the CIA, or just like the Baptist Church, or just like the Catholic Church, but at the top it's all been infiltrated.
[02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:07.913]  But I hope you do expose them to the truth about 9-11.
[02:02:09.301 --> 02:02:21.826]  Well, I tend to do my best, and on that note, we were at Wesleyan College listening to Cy Hirsch, who was the Pulitzer Prize winner last week for the melee massacre expose that he did.
[02:02:22.486 --> 02:02:27.188]  And we brought up your name and your work, so that's gotten out to that university as well.
[02:02:27.208 --> 02:02:30.190]  But I have a tribute to Terry, if you don't mind.
[02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:37.493]  Yeah, stay there, I'll let you finish up when we get back after this quick break, Angela, and then we'll get to
[02:02:39.352 --> 02:02:41.553]  Eric and Robert and Tim and Sean and others.
[02:02:42.273 --> 02:02:42.973]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:46.814]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.974 --> 02:02:50.055]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.195 --> 02:02:54.097]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.157 --> 02:02:58.398]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.718 --> 02:03:02.519]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.639 --> 02:03:04.440]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.942]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:07.982 --> 02:03:12.685]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.866 --> 02:03:15.908]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:18.929]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:25.554]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.074 --> 02:03:29.876]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.277 --> 02:03:31.657]  Order your video today.
[02:03:31.978 --> 02:03:33.038]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.098 --> 02:03:35.340]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:36.841]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:44.705 --> 02:03:46.325]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.465 --> 02:03:50.526]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.706 --> 02:03:53.587]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.667 --> 02:04:00.368]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.548 --> 02:04:03.549]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:03.769 --> 02:04:06.149]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.269 --> 02:04:14.171]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:14.491 --> 02:04:25.759]  Narcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:04:25.919 --> 02:04:33.525]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.585 --> 02:04:33.885]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.905 --> 02:04:35.866]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:44.372 --> 02:04:46.734]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:46.995 --> 02:04:50.839]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:51.159 --> 02:04:51.960]  Read the labels.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:56.504]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:56.744 --> 02:05:00.929]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:01.309 --> 02:05:06.194]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:06.554 --> 02:05:10.156]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:15.680]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:05:45.393 --> 02:05:51.034]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.755 --> 02:05:53.775]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:05:54.875 --> 02:05:59.897]  About 51 and a half minutes left in this live Thursday edition.
[02:05:59.957 --> 02:06:00.357]  Terry
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:10.507]  Mark Schindler, her name that you know her by, Terri Schiavo, died after almost 14 days of agonizing torture.
[02:06:10.527 --> 02:06:19.194]  And I'm sure those that are out promoting it and calling her names in the different newspapers and on different websites are very happy with themselves.
[02:06:19.214 --> 02:06:20.075]  You got what you wanted.
[02:06:21.937 --> 02:06:26.080]  By inflicting death, you subconsciously think that you're somehow extending your life.
[02:06:27.383 --> 02:06:28.964]  It's kind of the greed factor.
[02:06:29.024 --> 02:06:35.268]  These lovers of death in a sick way think they get more life out of being able to exercise death.
[02:06:35.308 --> 02:06:36.509]  It's like a security blanket.
[02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:41.393]  In truth, you set up a system where none of us are safe and you generate death.
[02:06:42.513 --> 02:06:43.434]  You're truly sick.
[02:06:44.174 --> 02:06:48.998]  Angela in Connecticut, you were going to talk about, Terri, go ahead.
[02:06:49.058 --> 02:06:50.739]  Yes, a couple of things.
[02:06:50.779 --> 02:06:54.962]  First of all, I work with domestic violence education and work with the
[02:06:55.666 --> 02:06:57.747]  Perpetrators of violence for a number of years.
[02:06:58.427 --> 02:07:09.252]  And I do believe that Michael, unfortunately, if we were to discover, go back and look, there is indication that... Well, we have all these doctors and nurses and other people that are witnesses.
[02:07:09.832 --> 02:07:10.032]  Yes.
[02:07:10.612 --> 02:07:18.736]  And there's no question the way he's treated her in her treatment supposedly... Didn't lock in somebody in the dark for a decade a nice thing to do?
[02:07:19.216 --> 02:07:20.436]  No, obviously not.
[02:07:20.536 --> 02:07:21.677]  I'm a professional.
[02:07:22.347 --> 02:07:23.248]  No, it's not okay.
[02:07:23.328 --> 02:07:25.449]  Not letting the parents give him a drink of water?
[02:07:25.529 --> 02:07:37.136]  I mean... No, if this is really sick, and this is a statement, and I think... I can't thank you enough because you're really proponing and making sure that we protect life from fetus to old age.
[02:07:37.396 --> 02:07:40.398]  And this is exactly what we need to have these things highlighted.
[02:07:40.738 --> 02:07:43.300]  And I have, in fact, a tribute to Terry, if I may.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:43.920]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:46.762]  I want to share this, because it comes from Ecclesiastics.
[02:07:46.782 --> 02:07:51.445]  It's written by Dr. Timothy Roswell, and he's written like nine books
[02:07:52.512 --> 02:08:00.977]  In regards to this whole work, there is a line we must never cross, should we be termed humanity at all, to feed into another person's loss.
[02:08:01.558 --> 02:08:03.999]  Begin by asking, who on earth is boss?
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:19.629]  We that judge descendants from the fall, there is a line that we must never cross, to take the flow of life away and toss, so action slowly grinds into a stall, to feed into another person's loss, until the bearing heart flows dry,
[02:08:20.222 --> 02:08:23.344]  Alright, well, Angela, the beautiful words, and thank you for the call.
[02:08:50.911 --> 02:08:54.814]  And call us back after you've talked to the UN about 9-11 and government involvement.
[02:08:54.834 --> 02:08:55.955]  I want to hear the response you get.
[02:08:55.975 --> 02:09:01.358]  Before I go to Eric and Robert and Tim and Sean and everybody else, number one, the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:09:01.759 --> 02:09:07.403]  I wanted to comment just about how thankful I am.
[02:09:08.663 --> 02:09:11.285]  I mean, life is a beautiful, wonderful thing.
[02:09:11.305 --> 02:09:14.568]  There's so much beauty in life, so much innocence.
[02:09:16.469 --> 02:09:19.171]  Life is such an incredible adventure.
[02:09:20.348 --> 02:09:32.231]  I mean to be able to have children and love them and raise them and see their beautiful little twinkling souls, learning and enjoying life and exploring.
[02:09:35.492 --> 02:09:39.393]  It's just magic beyond belief and God gives us this.
[02:09:40.274 --> 02:09:48.676]  And to walk through the woods on a spring morning with the dew on the ground and to smell those smells and to see the moon and the stars
[02:09:49.611 --> 02:09:54.843]  You know, God's handiwork in the farmament to go and visit your grandmother.
[02:09:56.343 --> 02:10:21.669]  And, you know, enjoy talking to them and hearing the wisdom of what they discovered in their life, or talking to your grandfather, or going out on the boat deep sea fishing out there and seeing the color of the waves and the foam and the seabirds and casting your line and pulling up a beautiful fish and taking it back to dock and preparing it and cooking it and sitting with friends and family.
[02:10:24.810 --> 02:10:49.362]  Just enjoying camaraderie and the fulfillment of being able to work really hard on something like a documentary film and to really bust your hind end on it and then to see it come forward and be better than you thought it would be and then to see it affect so many people and see so many strong people with courage stand up against corruption and evil
[02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:52.429]  There's just all that beauty.
[02:10:52.529 --> 02:10:53.530]  All I see is beauty.
[02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:55.470]  And I want to talk about something here.
[02:10:56.111 --> 02:10:57.131]  The killer instinct.
[02:10:57.151 --> 02:10:58.772]  You know, I have a killer instinct.
[02:10:59.852 --> 02:11:02.833]  And it's something I was proud of when I was young.
[02:11:02.893 --> 02:11:07.475]  I was proud of the fact that most people, when they get in a fist fight, will hold back.
[02:11:08.575 --> 02:11:15.397]  They have an automatic psychological point that holds them back from you really hitting somebody as hard as you can.
[02:11:15.417 --> 02:11:17.678]  Because you really hit somebody as hard as you can.
[02:11:17.718 --> 02:11:20.159]  I mean, it kills them a lot of the time.
[02:11:21.647 --> 02:11:24.589]  I grew up in Dallas and things were rough in the 80s.
[02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:30.213]  I was in probably 50 serious fistfights with people that weighed 100 pounds more than me that were trying to hurt me.
[02:11:31.934 --> 02:11:35.177]  I was very prideful about the fact that at first it was bullies attacking me.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.741]  I finally learned to fight back and I beat him up real bad.
[02:11:38.781 --> 02:11:40.802]  That was when I was like 12 or 13.
[02:11:41.362 --> 02:11:44.844]  Then pretty soon people want to get in fights with you.
[02:11:45.524 --> 02:11:46.345]  Who's this little guy?
[02:11:46.405 --> 02:11:47.505]  I can tear him up.
[02:11:48.266 --> 02:11:58.691]  At the point somebody would crack me upside the head with post hole diggers, I'd just black out and be able to pick them up and throw them ten feet and punch people and their skulls would crack.
[02:11:58.711 --> 02:12:01.492]  I have that killer instinct.
[02:12:04.941 --> 02:12:07.662]  And I'm not in some macho fashion bragging about it.
[02:12:07.702 --> 02:12:08.803]  It's just very dangerous.
[02:12:10.304 --> 02:12:15.006]  And I never felt any remorse when I'd go shoot a deer at 500 yards.
[02:12:15.066 --> 02:12:20.269]  And I never feel remorse if I accidentally stepped on a lizard in my yard.
[02:12:20.529 --> 02:12:21.709]  I've talked about that before.
[02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:23.911]  I would feel no remorse.
[02:12:23.951 --> 02:12:32.855]  You know, I liked watching the, in 1991, I liked watching the bombs blow up buildings on, I just liked it.
[02:12:34.676 --> 02:12:35.856]  When we invaded Iraq.
[02:12:37.357 --> 02:12:43.760]  But as I got older, and I learned more, a little bit of wisdom, and I'm still pretty stupid, I'm 31, I learn more all the time.
[02:12:45.101 --> 02:12:53.745]  You know, it's hard for me to shoot a deer, and I want to be clear, it's not bad to shoot a deer if you're shooting it for food, and you're doing it from that instinct.
[02:12:55.626 --> 02:12:56.607]  That's a healthy instinct.
[02:12:58.071 --> 02:13:04.416]  But with the Globalist, it's a warped hunting instinct, a warped predator instinct that they're kind of perseverating on.
[02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:05.837]  They're like stuck on it.
[02:13:06.197 --> 02:13:07.158]  It's like replay.
[02:13:08.319 --> 02:13:11.862]  It's like a predatory instinct gone completely awry.
[02:13:11.882 --> 02:13:24.311]  And now if I go hunting and I shoot a deer and then, you know, get it processed into food and then cooked in a stew or fried up on a grill, whatever, that's a good thing, but I'm thankful for the deer.
[02:13:25.359 --> 02:13:30.483]  And I appreciate its life, and I appreciate that that's its role.
[02:13:31.243 --> 02:13:39.689]  But, I don't know, I would say at one point in my life there was a certain, and a lot of people have this, there was a certain power in it.
[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:41.511]  And that's gone now.
[02:13:41.711 --> 02:13:48.536]  And now, let me be frank with you, I love life so much, it's not a weakness, I don't like to even kill bugs.
[02:13:51.346 --> 02:13:54.468]  I don't take the pleasure I used to in poisoning the fire ants.
[02:13:54.528 --> 02:13:55.389]  It's just got to be done.
[02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:57.551]  Because they're dangerous.
[02:13:59.012 --> 02:14:02.514]  But the point is, I could have gone down that dark side path, folks.
[02:14:03.275 --> 02:14:05.817]  I mean, I have felt the power of the dark side.
[02:14:06.797 --> 02:14:07.978]  If you really want to be honest.
[02:14:09.019 --> 02:14:10.780]  I knew people who were into Satanism.
[02:14:11.841 --> 02:14:19.607]  And when I was in early teens, I was very close to going over to the dark side.
[02:14:20.545 --> 02:14:27.627]  But something kept me back from it and I once had a pastor who really had great discernment tell me that God's seal was on me.
[02:14:28.567 --> 02:14:36.990]  And I've always belonged to God and to Jesus and I'll never belong to the New World Order.
[02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:41.051]  And I love life and I don't like death.
[02:14:42.091 --> 02:14:44.172]  But I don't fight death because I hate it.
[02:14:44.872 --> 02:14:45.432]  I do hate it.
[02:14:46.532 --> 02:14:48.333]  It's a natural, it's good to hate.
[02:14:49.102 --> 02:14:49.842]  At a certain level.
[02:14:50.362 --> 02:14:53.243]  But the love is so much stronger.
[02:14:55.204 --> 02:14:56.484]  The power of love.
[02:14:56.984 --> 02:14:58.165]  The power of goodness.
[02:14:59.325 --> 02:14:59.845]  The beauty.
[02:15:01.065 --> 02:15:01.626]  The purity.
[02:15:03.846 --> 02:15:06.907]  I just wish people could truly partake of goodness.
[02:15:08.227 --> 02:15:09.888]  And get the evil out of them.
[02:15:09.908 --> 02:15:11.268]  Because evil is all around us.
[02:15:11.328 --> 02:15:12.249]  And I see it everywhere.
[02:15:12.289 --> 02:15:13.269]  I see it so clearly.
[02:15:14.649 --> 02:15:15.109]  I see it.
[02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:16.170]  I know what it wants.
[02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.950]  It hates life.
[02:15:18.789 --> 02:15:19.789]  It's threatened by life.
[02:15:21.170 --> 02:15:27.692]  It wants to destroy life because it's so unhappy and it sees us enjoying our lives.
[02:15:27.732 --> 02:15:33.315]  It sees beauty and honor and decency and duty and everything that's good and it hates it.
[02:15:35.095 --> 02:15:37.756]  It hates it because it's given itself totally over to darkness.
[02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:44.499]  The most pitch black that you can imagine and I can see it and let me tell you when you get real discernment
[02:15:45.586 --> 02:16:03.218]  I mean sometimes I hope my discernment doesn't get much better or much stronger because it increases exponentially yearly and I am very frustrated and angry with myself that I am a babbling, arrogant fool much of the time.
[02:16:03.418 --> 02:16:08.542]  I don't have the capacity to articulate my understanding of what I see.
[02:16:10.037 --> 02:16:13.438]  But I know this, we are called to stand up for the human species.
[02:16:13.478 --> 02:16:15.459]  We are called to stand up for the little ones.
[02:16:16.039 --> 02:16:18.420]  We are called to stand up for all that is beautiful.
[02:16:21.681 --> 02:16:24.342]  So many people have been seduced by the dark side.
[02:16:27.843 --> 02:16:31.425]  Hollywood tries to portray that dark side in its fictitious fashion.
[02:16:31.825 --> 02:16:35.286]  It resonates and is popular with the public because people know it's real.
[02:16:36.849 --> 02:16:41.873]  God is real, the devil is real, good and evil is real, and it's all around us.
[02:16:43.434 --> 02:16:47.897]  And I feel so sorry for people that have been shut off from this and have never experienced this and don't know this.
[02:16:49.979 --> 02:16:59.046]  But I hope and pray that those of us that love God and love goodness will have the strength and the courage to stand up against this beast.
[02:17:00.555 --> 02:17:04.237]  And to warn everyone and to just do our duty to warn people.
[02:17:04.737 --> 02:17:05.457]  Duty is ours.
[02:17:05.537 --> 02:17:07.038]  Consequences belong to God.
[02:17:08.779 --> 02:17:14.121]  And it just disgusts me to watch people buying lottery tickets and being abused by that system with their false hopes.
[02:17:14.961 --> 02:17:17.543]  It makes me so sad to see people on Prozac and Ritalin.
[02:17:18.283 --> 02:17:27.707]  It makes me so sad to see young children playing these violent video games, turning them into psychopathic killers, honing their killer instinct, nurturing the beast.
[02:17:30.279 --> 02:17:35.285]  We already are born with so much of the dark side in us, folks.
[02:17:35.325 --> 02:17:40.090]  We don't need to nurture it, to water it, to breed it.
[02:17:41.612 --> 02:17:42.834]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[02:17:45.563 --> 02:17:46.543]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:46.623 --> 02:17:51.404]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:51.564 --> 02:17:59.366]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:17:59.646 --> 02:18:05.007]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:05.207 --> 02:18:12.189]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:12.489 --> 02:18:17.834]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:18:18.094 --> 02:18:22.819]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:18:23.159 --> 02:18:30.786]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:18:31.126 --> 02:18:36.591]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:18:37.672 --> 02:18:39.313]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.593 --> 02:18:43.795]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:43.855 --> 02:18:55.800]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:03.583]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.844 --> 02:19:06.945]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:12.947]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:19:13.247 --> 02:19:19.409]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:19:19.749 --> 02:19:23.650]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:25.571]  The water level is always visible.
[02:19:25.771 --> 02:19:31.734]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:19:31.954 --> 02:19:35.715]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:35.815 --> 02:19:36.636]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[02:19:45.317 --> 02:19:47.800]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:51.404]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:19:51.424 --> 02:19:57.110]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:58.071 --> 02:20:02.996]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:20:04.058 --> 02:20:05.900]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:07.081]  There may be more.
[02:20:08.246 --> 02:20:15.052]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:20:15.732 --> 02:20:23.579]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.419 --> 02:20:25.980]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:44.465 --> 02:20:47.367]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy.
[02:20:47.467 --> 02:20:49.990]  But never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:57.777]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[02:20:57.877 --> 02:21:02.201]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle.
[02:21:02.261 --> 02:21:04.463]  And the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[02:21:04.663 --> 02:21:06.025]  Now it's available to you.
[02:21:06.205 --> 02:21:12.831]  The PainX 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:17.255]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[02:21:17.595 --> 02:21:23.856]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[02:21:23.977 --> 02:21:28.057]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:52.380]  Alright, let's hurry through your calls.
[02:21:54.121 --> 02:21:55.341]  Is it Eric in Texas?
[02:21:55.621 --> 02:21:56.461]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:21:56.481 --> 02:21:58.821]  Hey Dan, Alex, this is Eric Portman.
[02:21:59.101 --> 02:22:01.822]  I'm a Prison Planet contributor and a subscriber.
[02:22:02.202 --> 02:22:04.042]  Yeah, you sent me a book you wrote, right?
[02:22:04.602 --> 02:22:05.002]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:05.242 --> 02:22:06.023]  Yeah, good book.
[02:22:06.663 --> 02:22:11.444]  I've been a member of PrisonPlanet.tv for a month and I haven't even waded through 20% of the stuff.
[02:22:11.464 --> 02:22:12.664]  I want your listeners to know that.
[02:22:12.684 --> 02:22:13.924]  It's just phenomenal.
[02:22:14.485 --> 02:22:16.265]  But I have a few things to say about Paris Schindler.
[02:22:16.325 --> 02:22:21.867]  I'm going to stand real quick and then you comment about her 13th day of cult ritual slaying.
[02:22:25.228 --> 02:22:26.988]  Notice they wouldn't let the family in.
[02:22:28.368 --> 02:22:28.828]  Exactly.
[02:22:28.848 --> 02:22:32.629]  And we have a sworn affidavit from a nurse that he was trying to kill her years ago.
[02:22:32.649 --> 02:22:33.169]  Go ahead.
[02:22:34.450 --> 02:22:43.652]  Yes, I was under the assumption, I guess I was wrong, that the federal government's main duty was to protect the citizens' right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:44.861 --> 02:22:46.322]  Not doing that duty at all.
[02:22:46.342 --> 02:22:47.603]  In fact, they're doing the opposite.
[02:22:48.884 --> 02:22:59.093]  Thomas Jefferson set the precedent for going against the Supreme Court and said that if it's unconstitutional, the executive or the legislative does not have to follow it.
[02:22:59.173 --> 02:23:00.714]  And then Andrew Jackson.
[02:23:00.934 --> 02:23:01.775]  Andrew Jackson, yes.
[02:23:02.936 --> 02:23:11.863]  And the last thing I have to say is that what exactly are they thinking?
[02:23:12.203 --> 02:23:12.784]  What exactly
[02:23:13.314 --> 02:23:14.698]  Are they thinking that we're going to do this?
[02:23:15.099 --> 02:23:16.382]  They're just selling us on death!
[02:23:19.196 --> 02:23:21.457]  And 70% of the people are just following in line?
[02:23:21.737 --> 02:23:23.797]  Well, no, they're using an ABC poll.
[02:23:23.897 --> 02:23:27.678]  Most of the polls show it's about 40% or 40 to 60% are against it.
[02:23:27.738 --> 02:23:30.938]  If you ask the question, you know, we don't know what this woman wanted.
[02:23:31.579 --> 02:23:35.879]  She was rehabilitatable, but she's been not given treatment for 10 years.
[02:23:36.019 --> 02:23:37.600]  Oh, well, by all means, save her.
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:47.082]  But if you say this woman's a complete vegetable and wanted to have the medical treatment and taken off life support, then 60-something percent say, oh, then by all means, kill her.
[02:23:48.402 --> 02:23:48.742]  I got it.
[02:23:50.881 --> 02:23:52.162]  It's how they phrase a poll.
[02:23:53.522 --> 02:23:58.684]  It's like, do you support Bush protecting you from terrorism with the Patriot Act?
[02:23:59.764 --> 02:23:58.684]  70%.
[02:23:59.824 --> 02:24:00.424]  Oh yes I do.
[02:24:00.444 --> 02:24:05.386]  If you say, do you support the government breaking in your house without warrants for all criminal cases?
[02:24:05.426 --> 02:24:06.846]  Well, 90% say no.
[02:24:07.587 --> 02:24:09.327]  It's how they ask the question.
[02:24:09.967 --> 02:24:12.688]  It's one of their many forms of brainwashing and leading the public on.
[02:24:12.708 --> 02:24:13.428]  Thanks a lot.
[02:24:13.448 --> 02:24:14.049]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:14.529 --> 02:24:15.449]  I appreciate it, Eric.
[02:24:16.471 --> 02:24:18.972]  And I'm glad Jack Blood's going to carry your book.
[02:24:19.132 --> 02:24:20.693]  I meant to call you and carry your book.
[02:24:20.753 --> 02:24:24.935]  I just... I got cases of books I decided to carry that I never even put on the shopping cart.
[02:24:25.275 --> 02:24:26.116]  Other people's books.
[02:24:26.476 --> 02:24:28.377]  Nice little books he's been writing.
[02:24:29.197 --> 02:24:32.939]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Florida.
[02:24:32.979 --> 02:24:33.820]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:34.520]  Yeah, Rob.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.162]  Alex, I'm calling outside from the death torture chamber here in Pinellas Park.
[02:24:39.723 --> 02:24:40.403]  A couple things.
[02:24:40.903 --> 02:24:44.465]  On Sunday, I read a nine-page statement
[02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:45.971]  The Pinellas Park Police.
[02:24:46.011 --> 02:24:51.053]  I told them that I was endeavoring to enter the hospice to provide hydration to Teresa Chavo.
[02:24:51.313 --> 02:24:53.014]  I wasn't interested in a symbolic arrest.
[02:24:53.614 --> 02:24:55.155]  Obviously, they didn't permit me to do that.
[02:24:55.175 --> 02:25:00.958]  I also told them I was endeavoring to explain the fundamental mysteries of the Catholic faith to her.
[02:25:01.418 --> 02:25:04.019]  And I understand they told me I was not going to be permitted to do that.
[02:25:04.039 --> 02:25:05.400]  But at that juncture, what I did was
[02:25:06.129 --> 02:25:13.951]  I wrote, I had written out a statement and I got a filmed copy of it from a guy here who works with the cable TV station and he's going to send you a copy today.
[02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:15.751]  He already put the whole thing into a DVD.
[02:25:16.291 --> 02:25:23.332]  But my purpose was to accuse these people in public so that they couldn't claim that they didn't know that I was claiming that what happened here was not true.
[02:25:23.372 --> 02:25:28.293]  Yeah, you were like filing an affidavit publicly of their wrongs, putting them on notice.
[02:25:28.633 --> 02:25:31.734]  Exactly, and I laid out that the crimes against God and humanity
[02:25:33.775 --> 02:25:43.238]  Well, that's what the Founding Fathers did for a decade before 1776 at Washington and Concord, was the Committees of Correspondence publicly proclaiming the crimes of the King.
[02:25:43.658 --> 02:25:47.860]  Right, and so the purpose is that he's going to email you this in a DVD format.
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:50.842]  Uh, and the guy is, we're going to go back out there today.
[02:25:51.062 --> 02:25:55.865]  Second thing I wanted to explain, is I also, people don't know what they could have done in regard to this abomination.
[02:25:55.885 --> 02:25:57.866]  What do you want me to do with this video?
[02:25:57.946 --> 02:26:02.569]  I mean, if it's usable, everybody should send me a waiver saying I can use whatever you send me.
[02:26:02.749 --> 02:26:03.970]  He's already got a waiver on there.
[02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:07.212]  It says no rights reserved to be freely given and spread around.
[02:26:07.252 --> 02:26:09.254]  Well, if it's some good stuff, I might put it on the website.
[02:26:09.414 --> 02:26:15.858]  Every time some police officer stops you in the car now, we need people to get out and start prosecuting them, start making cell phone calls.
[02:26:16.118 --> 02:26:18.939]  Because we don't know that the next stop isn't them coming to get us.
[02:26:19.379 --> 02:26:21.880]  So this nightmare has hit home all these people.
[02:26:22.641 --> 02:26:24.041]  We're trying to lay the blame.
[02:26:24.061 --> 02:26:25.302]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:26:25.322 --> 02:26:28.883]  You know, the media on Monday said the violence escalated.
[02:26:28.903 --> 02:26:35.086]  And then a minute later, when they tried to bring her water, and now it's violent for children to try to bring water.
[02:26:35.106 --> 02:26:38.287]  And the police, I mean, it's just they're redefining everything.
[02:26:38.547 --> 02:26:38.988]  Absolutely.
[02:26:39.008 --> 02:26:44.152]  When I was out there, there was a guy who went and he tried to bring water, and then they used a pain compliance technique.
[02:26:44.252 --> 02:26:53.600]  I recognized that not only was that a false arrest, but there was also excessive force in the actual effecting of the arrest.
[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.541]  So there were two torts.
[02:26:54.972 --> 02:27:02.318]  When I started laying out the liability, everyone came running over and said, that's going to be used against the cameraman, that's going to be used in retaliation against the Schindlers.
[02:27:02.578 --> 02:27:04.920]  Do you want to keep the Schindlers from being able to visit their daughter?
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:07.842]  At which point, Robert Schindler Jr.
[02:27:07.882 --> 02:27:16.248]  made a statement to which I then replied, well, we're going to do it in derogation of what... You know, and they intimidate the family and say, we'll help your daughter if you control these people.
[02:27:16.549 --> 02:27:18.230]  Yeah, they really helped your daughter, didn't they?
[02:27:18.610 --> 02:27:23.854]  Exactly, and a couple other things, the attorney yesterday... Just be nice and don't be too loud and we'll take care of you!
[02:27:24.654 --> 02:27:25.255]  No, no, no!
[02:27:25.415 --> 02:27:29.197]  You will fail if you get in our face, if you become powerful!
[02:27:29.658 --> 02:27:31.139]  I mean, what garbage is that?
[02:27:31.379 --> 02:27:32.480]  We'll be back, thanks for the call.
[02:27:36.322 --> 02:27:39.344]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.364 --> 02:27:42.947]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.433 --> 02:27:52.056]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:27:52.417 --> 02:28:02.522]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[02:28:03.202 --> 02:28:04.683]  With a 100% kill.

[02:29:45.528 --> 02:29:48.670]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:51.592]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:29:51.772 --> 02:29:53.153]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:29:53.313 --> 02:30:03.238]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:30:03.458 --> 02:30:05.179]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:30:05.459 --> 02:30:09.324]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:09.564 --> 02:30:13.990]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:18.054]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn beer system.
[02:30:18.295 --> 02:30:24.402]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:30:24.642 --> 02:30:27.466]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:30:27.626 --> 02:30:30.950]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle one-year money-back guarantee.

[02:31:21.584 --> 02:31:24.285]  We've reached the point of no return in the New World Order.
[02:31:25.666 --> 02:31:31.028]  Our duty is to warn people and to expose the crimes being committed by the globalists.
[02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:34.730]  To tell the truth, to face the horror.
[02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:39.132]  Not just of the cases that the globalists point out to us, but all the cases we're aware of.
[02:31:40.613 --> 02:31:43.174]  None of us are secure, none of us are safe while this is happening.
[02:31:43.554 --> 02:31:44.175]  I want to go to
[02:31:47.279 --> 02:31:51.662]  Tim and Sean and Eric and Rob and Charles and we'll go to you here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:53.204 --> 02:31:55.525]  Last night at about 11 p.m.
[02:31:55.806 --> 02:32:02.791]  I left the editing studio working on the Arnold ad I'm going to run in California.
[02:32:02.811 --> 02:32:07.554]  Exposing how they're pushing for him for president.
[02:32:07.574 --> 02:32:09.176]  Details at ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:32:09.196 --> 02:32:13.038]  Because I know that's an important part of the program and must be resisted.
[02:32:13.999 --> 02:32:14.960]  Kind of a nexus point.
[02:32:16.368 --> 02:32:20.649]  And I was listening to Neil Bortz, that they carry locally on 590, KLBJ.
[02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:28.011]  And Neil Bortz claims he's this libertarian, and very little of what he says do I agree with.
[02:32:28.151 --> 02:32:30.731]  I mean, it's all basically twisted, and he knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:32:32.492 --> 02:32:36.953]  You know, posing as a freedom fighter when he's actually selling you another brand of slavery.
[02:32:36.993 --> 02:32:41.214]  But he did say something, I think as he was speaking from the heart,
[02:32:42.702 --> 02:32:53.007]  That was very touching, and then he went right into some horrible stuff about, don't listen to these idiots that tell you a national sales tax isn't good, the fair tax is going to free everybody, and blah blah blah.
[02:32:53.607 --> 02:33:06.813]  No, the plan is to give us a sales tax along with the income tax, and then you'll have two forms of taxes, and it'll bring federal regulators through the federal tax into every terminal, every cash register in the country.
[02:33:07.153 --> 02:33:09.214]  You thought the IRS was bad, just get ready.
[02:33:10.327 --> 02:33:18.575]  It'll be administered by the National ID Card, because people that make less than $15,000 a year will not have to pay the tax, but to make sure you're not cheating, they'll have to scan your card.
[02:33:19.115 --> 02:33:20.917]  This is what they're saying officially.
[02:33:20.937 --> 02:33:27.283]  And then they'll have to research and see if somebody's buying too much for their demographic.
[02:33:27.403 --> 02:33:34.209]  Oh, they must be buying for other people and then selling it to them without the sales tax, because you're buying too much.
[02:33:35.432 --> 02:33:36.393]  for your household.
[02:33:36.433 --> 02:33:38.455]  I mean, this is what they're saying they're going to do.
[02:33:38.635 --> 02:33:42.818]  So he's on there pushing this, and how the evil liberals are trying to stop it.
[02:33:42.878 --> 02:33:45.180]  No, they're pushing it, and that's the plan.
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:49.304]  I've been talking about that for about eight years since I learned of that.
[02:33:50.825 --> 02:33:53.047]  And now we're very close to it coming to fruit.
[02:33:53.347 --> 02:33:54.528]  It's poisonous fruit.
[02:33:55.388 --> 02:33:57.090]  But then this poor caller calls in.
[02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:58.251]  I mean, it made me sad.
[02:33:58.271 --> 02:33:59.892]  This stuff really freaks me out.
[02:33:59.932 --> 02:34:03.475]  I mean, I hate seeing people caught in these snares, and I'm caught in my own snares.
[02:34:04.406 --> 02:34:05.346]  But gambling.
[02:34:06.466 --> 02:34:08.107]  Gambling is really bad, folks.
[02:34:08.267 --> 02:34:15.528]  And again, it manipulates an area of risk in the brain associated again with the hunting instinct.
[02:34:16.488 --> 02:34:17.529]  Am I going to get it this time?
[02:34:17.609 --> 02:34:19.569]  Am I going to shoot the deer with my bow and arrow this time?
[02:34:20.009 --> 02:34:20.969]  I've got to make it this time.
[02:34:21.009 --> 02:34:29.271]  I've got to... I mean, that's my own view sociologically on it, but I don't mean to get off into the mechanisms behind it.
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:36.986]  And it's also about hopefulness and dreams and magical thinking that pervades societies that are in decline.
[02:34:38.487 --> 02:34:49.717]  But this poor caller calls in, an intelligent-sounding black man, and he says, he says, Neil, I'm against the sales taxes.
[02:34:49.737 --> 02:34:51.198]  That'll cut in on my lottery.
[02:34:52.099 --> 02:34:54.101]  Neil goes, how many lottery tickets are you buying?
[02:34:55.001 --> 02:34:56.623]  A hundred dollars a week.
[02:34:58.738 --> 02:35:00.079]  A hundred dollars a week.
[02:35:00.499 --> 02:35:03.222]  And my mother says it's bad, but you know, I'm gonna win.
[02:35:03.242 --> 02:35:04.082]  I just know I'm gonna win.
[02:35:04.102 --> 02:35:05.804]  Plus, I've invested so much in this.
[02:35:06.584 --> 02:35:07.685]  I just gotta keep going.
[02:35:08.125 --> 02:35:10.247]  And Neil said, you could tell he was so upset about it.
[02:35:10.267 --> 02:35:11.468]  He wanted to warn this person.
[02:35:11.548 --> 02:35:12.168]  It was genuine.
[02:35:12.188 --> 02:35:13.790]  It wasn't the Neil Bortz I know.
[02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:14.730]  The arrogant liar.
[02:35:15.231 --> 02:35:16.251]  The arrogant manipulator.
[02:35:17.092 --> 02:35:22.016]  And Neil was saying, saying, listen to me, please.
[02:35:22.056 --> 02:35:22.897]  I'm not being flippant.
[02:35:22.937 --> 02:35:24.558]  I'm not being arrogant here.
[02:35:24.618 --> 02:35:26.039]  My normal stick even said that.
[02:35:26.539 --> 02:35:26.940]  He said,
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:31.041]  He said, please listen to me.
[02:35:31.101 --> 02:35:36.865]  If you take that $100 and invest it in guaranteed investments, $100 a week, you'll be a millionaire when you retire.
[02:35:36.885 --> 02:35:37.906]  He said, how old are you?
[02:35:37.986 --> 02:35:40.307]  And the guy said, 31, same age as I am.
[02:35:41.748 --> 02:35:46.351]  And so, this guy was like, yeah, yeah, I think I'll take that into consideration.
[02:35:46.391 --> 02:35:51.755]  Yeah, yeah, I just really think, but I'm still probably going to win.
[02:35:52.355 --> 02:35:55.117]  And I just want to tell you, and I know this makes a lot of you mad, you don't want to hear this.
[02:35:55.757 --> 02:35:58.259]  I have to sit there and lie when I'm buying gas or I'm
[02:35:58.903 --> 02:36:04.167]  Or I'm buying, you know, whatever, at the gas station.
[02:36:05.689 --> 02:36:19.440]  And I mean, sometimes when there's a big lottery going, all the gas stations will have lines of like 15, 20 people deep, both registers, and you see these people, poor people, rich people, middle class, jumping, you know, I'll take $150 worth.
[02:36:20.861 --> 02:36:26.566]  And you see them out there, you know, scratching off their tickets and doing all this.
[02:36:28.479 --> 02:36:31.940]  And especially with the lotteries with, like, $25 million jackpots.
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:40.723]  You've got a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in some of these Powerballs three times than you do of winning that lottery.
[02:36:42.643 --> 02:36:45.584]  And now the government's taking over gambling.
[02:36:45.604 --> 02:36:52.406]  And they're going to put a big casino in in downtown Austin and all the things that go along with it and the life-wrecking garbage.
[02:36:53.767 --> 02:36:57.968]  And I'm not just talking about gambling, which I've never really talked about here on air, which has always annoyed me.
[02:36:58.863 --> 02:37:06.165]  You know, all of this is part and parcel of a symptom.
[02:37:06.786 --> 02:37:08.926]  They're promoting gambling, selling gambling.
[02:37:09.226 --> 02:37:17.649]  People who were predisposed psychologically and just in their own chemistry to be predisposed to light gambling never came in contact with it.
[02:37:17.709 --> 02:37:19.830]  Now their pushers are everywhere.
[02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:23.931]  And for people that just, you know, well I just play it every once in a while.
[02:37:24.011 --> 02:37:26.532]  You know, I have never bought a lottery ticket for myself.
[02:37:28.001 --> 02:37:35.346]  One time we were going on a little trip and I just, my wife doesn't gamble, but I thought, well I'll just be, I'll just buy a couple of these little scratch-offs.
[02:37:35.446 --> 02:37:38.168]  You know, just for something to do.
[02:37:38.208 --> 02:37:39.668]  It was just stupid.
[02:37:40.789 --> 02:37:42.010]  And you know, gave them to her.
[02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:44.011]  But I mean, that's how it starts.
[02:37:44.992 --> 02:37:46.973]  Well, I lost money, I gotta keep doing it.
[02:37:47.013 --> 02:37:47.774]  I'm gonna win.
[02:37:48.654 --> 02:37:53.317]  Why don't you, if you think it's, if you like to be reckless, why don't you gamble to stand up against tyranny?
[02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:54.678]  Well, it's not a gamble.
[02:37:55.290 --> 02:37:55.990]  You think it's a gamble?
[02:37:56.290 --> 02:37:57.571]  Why don't you be on the edge?
[02:37:57.771 --> 02:38:01.192]  Why don't you spend more time with your children?
[02:38:01.793 --> 02:38:10.076]  What's wrong with us in a society when they say it's okay to take Ritalin and Prozac, it's okay to go buy $100 in lottery tickets a week.
[02:38:11.497 --> 02:38:18.579]  Sometimes at the gas station by my house I see the same people three or four times a week in there.
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.962]  I'll go there for the ATM or for gas or for some bottled water if I'm in a hurry or something like that.
[02:38:25.643 --> 02:38:27.705]  I forgot to bring some of my filtered water with me.
[02:38:28.145 --> 02:38:29.566]  And I just see these same people.
[02:38:30.387 --> 02:38:31.287]  And they're just pathetic.
[02:38:31.467 --> 02:38:33.469]  I mean, I know you're listening right now.
[02:38:33.509 --> 02:38:34.550]  I mean, why do you do it?
[02:38:35.610 --> 02:38:36.771]  Why do you do this?
[02:38:36.791 --> 02:38:43.036]  I mean, if you want to gamble, go invest in speculative defense stocks and you've got a really good chance of winning big.
[02:38:43.076 --> 02:38:43.876]  It's still a gamble.
[02:38:44.717 --> 02:38:46.298]  Or buy derivatives or something.
[02:38:46.378 --> 02:38:49.761]  I mean, at least part of it is tangibly real.
[02:38:50.561 --> 02:38:54.124]  And you're thousands of times, if not millions of times, got a better chance of winning.
[02:38:55.672 --> 02:39:00.653]  Plus, we've seen evidence that these lotteries are a scam, and that's a whole other... We haven't seen evidence.
[02:39:00.713 --> 02:39:01.373]  It's documented.
[02:39:01.413 --> 02:39:02.173]  It's all staged.
[02:39:02.993 --> 02:39:06.574]  And you can't really explain this to people.
[02:39:06.854 --> 02:39:08.615]  I don't know why I'm off on lotteries.
[02:39:08.715 --> 02:39:15.056]  It's just... It was so sad to hear this guy who spends a hundred dollars a week.
[02:39:17.216 --> 02:39:23.538]  And you know, when he makes more money... Neil was saying this, and as he gets a family, he'll still spend more money on that.
[02:39:26.778 --> 02:39:27.078]  I don't know.
[02:39:27.098 --> 02:39:27.799]  Let's go to calls.
[02:39:27.919 --> 02:39:28.799]  It's a side issue.
[02:39:28.819 --> 02:39:33.241]  Terry Schindler, known as Terry Schiavo, died today after almost 14 days.
[02:39:33.541 --> 02:39:40.705]  Three hours short of 14 days of brutal torture, dehydration, and he was murdered.
[02:39:41.906 --> 02:39:42.886]  Another way to define it.
[02:39:43.827 --> 02:39:45.468]  Let's talk to Tim.
[02:39:45.548 --> 02:39:47.769]  Tim, where are you calling me from?
[02:39:47.789 --> 02:39:49.870]  I'm calling you from Canada, Alex.
[02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.790]  Hello, Tim.
[02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.611]  How are you?
[02:39:51.911 --> 02:39:52.131]  Good.
[02:39:52.651 --> 02:39:52.851]  Good.
[02:39:52.891 --> 02:39:54.012]  You've had a great show today.
[02:39:54.722 --> 02:39:58.726]  And for anybody who still hasn't gone to Prison Planet, you've got to go there.
[02:39:58.746 --> 02:40:00.207]  You've just got to go there.
[02:40:00.287 --> 02:40:01.288]  I mean, it's just a bargain.
[02:40:02.109 --> 02:40:06.013]  That wasn't what I called to say, but I wanted to push it anyway, Alex.
[02:40:06.093 --> 02:40:06.893]  I really like the site.
[02:40:07.674 --> 02:40:13.540]  Alex, I wanted to... You had a call earlier, who was trying to create a little trouble, I think.
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:19.345]  He was calling about the Mark Kornke thing, and then he mentioned something about Steve Quill's site.
[02:40:20.215 --> 02:40:24.359]  Having a reflection or a link to Northeast Intelligence Network.
[02:40:25.179 --> 02:40:27.842]  And it does.
[02:40:28.062 --> 02:40:30.344]  I'm a member there, so I just want to clear up a couple of things.
[02:40:31.425 --> 02:40:40.132]  First of all, Northeast Intelligence Network does not permit anything that they consider anti-government to be put on that site or on their forum.
[02:40:40.933 --> 02:40:44.336]  And the forum is now down, so I don't know when the last time he was there.
[02:40:45.377 --> 02:40:48.179]  At any rate, that's been the case for a long time.
[02:40:48.686 --> 02:40:50.446]  Now, Steve Quill does not go to those forums.
[02:40:50.887 --> 02:40:52.047]  He doesn't go into any forums.
[02:40:52.387 --> 02:40:56.448]  He just doesn't have the time and doesn't have the wherewithal to be bothered with it, and I don't blame him.
[02:40:57.228 --> 02:41:01.709]  And Steve does not necessarily agree with the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[02:41:01.729 --> 02:41:03.950]  He said that on his show a number of times.
[02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:05.370]  Let me be clear here.
[02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:14.953]  The point is, my broadcast is not about something to do with programming years ago with somebody's Sunday
[02:41:16.031 --> 02:41:23.995]  I mean, I was supportive of Mark Kornke when he got framed, when he went to jail up in Michigan, with the police falsely accusing him of bank robbery.
[02:41:24.315 --> 02:41:35.160]  So all I've been is supportive of people, and Mark sends me letters from jail, which I had time to write to him, and then somebody over here calls in griping at me, implying I've been bad to somebody.
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:36.561]  I mean, that's why I got angry at him.
[02:41:36.861 --> 02:41:38.982]  But I'm angry because now we're talking about it.
[02:41:39.302 --> 02:41:40.742]  This does not matter, sir.
[02:41:41.223 --> 02:41:44.144]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex, but I did want to clear that up, because people
[02:41:44.625 --> 02:41:47.246]  You need to understand, he did have a fraction of truth in there.
[02:41:47.786 --> 02:41:53.327]  Nine does not allow anything in their site that has anything to do with... Well, I've never been to this site.
[02:41:53.388 --> 02:41:55.528]  I think I've heard of it a few times and I really just don't care.
[02:41:55.688 --> 02:41:57.949]  I mean... Well, I don't either, but I wanted to hear that.
[02:41:57.969 --> 02:41:58.649]  I've got to move on here.
[02:41:58.829 --> 02:41:59.529]  Yes, that's fine.
[02:41:59.929 --> 02:42:08.692]  I was wanting to... Well, what I saw it as was an attempt to drive a wedge between you and Steve, which you guys are both coming from the same page, have been all along, and
[02:42:09.611 --> 02:42:10.692]  I don't like to see that happen.
[02:42:10.732 --> 02:42:11.452]  That really upsets me.
[02:42:11.472 --> 02:42:12.152]  No, no.
[02:42:12.673 --> 02:42:15.274]  I hear you and I appreciate the kind words and God bless you and thanks for the call.
[02:42:15.974 --> 02:42:17.195]  I want to go to everybody else here.
[02:42:17.855 --> 02:42:20.557]  But my whole point is, is I got mad.
[02:42:20.577 --> 02:42:21.457]  I wasn't even going to talk about it.
[02:42:21.477 --> 02:42:22.598]  I was sitting there being real nice.
[02:42:23.238 --> 02:42:26.600]  And during the break, it was like a four minute break, that long break we do at 20 After.
[02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:28.601]  And I was thinking, why?
[02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:29.822]  What have I done?
[02:42:29.882 --> 02:42:30.542]  Leave me alone.
[02:42:30.762 --> 02:42:32.623]  Don't call it, act like I'm bad.
[02:42:32.683 --> 02:42:33.964]  I'm not even involved in something.
[02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:37.086]  There's people I interview and people that interview me.
[02:42:37.907 --> 02:42:48.435]  And I like Steven, he's a nice guy, but I go on NPR, I go on 2020, I go on Good Morning America, I've been on these shows, and I've been attacked, I've been quoted in the New York Times, misquoted, whatever.
[02:42:48.455 --> 02:42:52.898]  I mean, I was interviewed by Popular Mechanics, and they tried to twist what I said.
[02:42:52.918 --> 02:42:54.479]  Does it mean I'm for Popular Mechanics?
[02:42:54.519 --> 02:43:00.964]  I mean, it's just... The people, the problem is the people that do this, this infighting, that's all they do.
[02:43:02.125 --> 02:43:04.167]  I mean, I hear it, and
[02:43:05.461 --> 02:43:10.064]  You know, the fellow that called in was filling in a lot on the weekend on that show he was doing.
[02:43:10.084 --> 02:43:11.685]  I remember hearing him.
[02:43:12.465 --> 02:43:15.447]  And he was just spending half the time bashing the network he was on.
[02:43:15.467 --> 02:43:17.868]  And so one day they said, hey, go do a show somewhere else.
[02:43:18.669 --> 02:43:19.729]  My First Amendment!
[02:43:20.129 --> 02:43:20.690]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:27.934]  Your First Amendment is we don't go stop you from having a sandwich board on the side of the street doing what you want, or putting up your website, or making phone calls, or
[02:43:28.638 --> 02:43:29.579]  Creating a newspaper.
[02:43:29.899 --> 02:43:36.183]  It doesn't mean you get to jump around like Captain Kangaroo, uh, you know, just attacking the network you're on for months on end.
[02:43:37.023 --> 02:43:47.350]  Uh, and, uh, I remember, you know, I, I, I just can't, and I'm not involved in that, so don't bring your dirty laundry in my show and plop it on the ground when I got real stuff to talk about.
[02:43:48.651 --> 02:43:51.933]  And these people that do this, they, they just constantly, it's all they do.
[02:43:52.573 --> 02:43:55.275]  Just, just running on at the mouth and, uh,
[02:43:56.149 --> 02:43:57.830]  Because it's easier to fight with other patriots.
[02:43:57.890 --> 02:44:00.250]  It's harder to fight the New World Order.
[02:44:00.350 --> 02:44:02.771]  I'm hanging up on folks who call about this.
[02:44:03.251 --> 02:44:06.072]  I don't censor calls, but I just can't do this.
[02:44:06.372 --> 02:44:07.533]  We've got serious stuff.
[02:44:07.553 --> 02:44:11.034]  So I'll give you 30 seconds to spout whatever you want to talk about, and then I'm moving on.
[02:44:12.174 --> 02:44:13.614]  Next is Sean in Alabama.
[02:44:13.975 --> 02:44:14.715]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:44:16.975 --> 02:44:18.536]  Sean in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:44:18.596 --> 02:44:18.916]  Welcome.
[02:44:19.736 --> 02:44:20.957]  Okay, Eric in Oklahoma.
[02:44:20.997 --> 02:44:21.637]  Eric, go ahead.
[02:44:22.328 --> 02:44:37.906]  Alex, I have to climb up on the mountain behind my house and stand on my barn to get good reception, but I just wanted to call and say that I love you, brother, and God bless you, and your heart shows through just all the time, and I sure appreciate it.
[02:44:38.823 --> 02:44:39.603]  I truly do.
[02:44:39.783 --> 02:44:41.283]  And I appreciate those kind comments.
[02:44:41.303 --> 02:44:45.944]  I'm just an average person fighting the tyranny that I can clearly see.
[02:44:46.324 --> 02:44:47.625]  That is certainly all around us.
[02:44:47.945 --> 02:44:49.765]  You know what?
[02:44:49.845 --> 02:44:52.185]  Terry Shivo, Schindler.
[02:44:53.266 --> 02:44:55.046]  Thirteen days without clear water.
[02:44:55.486 --> 02:45:03.587]  That woman could have had more heart and had more struggle and more... And I have to correct something.
[02:45:03.627 --> 02:45:06.188]  I said thirteen days, nine hours.
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:07.420]  I don't know.
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:10.382]  It was thirteen days, twenty-one hours.
[02:45:11.422 --> 02:45:13.703]  Thirteen days, twenty-one hours that she made it.
[02:45:14.264 --> 02:45:14.904]  Well, you know what?
[02:45:14.924 --> 02:45:20.727]  My grandfather, who struggled with Alzheimer's, when he finally was put in a rest home, he had to pull this thing tube out.
[02:45:20.747 --> 02:45:22.587]  It took him five days to die.
[02:45:22.928 --> 02:45:26.509]  There was a man who really actually wanted to die, and he was a pretty strong man.
[02:45:26.970 --> 02:45:29.811]  A woman who's been emaciated for fourteen years.
[02:45:30.391 --> 02:45:32.393]  It took her 13 days to die.
[02:45:32.613 --> 02:45:45.424]  If that doesn't say something to the people who thought this was just something about... And they were pumping her with morphine because of the convulsions and the moaning and the begging and the bleeding and that was reported.
[02:45:45.444 --> 02:45:49.408]  The morphine will help you die so she probably would have gone even longer.
[02:45:49.428 --> 02:45:54.172]  Well you know what I've been without water for four days and my tongue was broken.
[02:45:54.192 --> 02:45:56.254]  It was not a very good experience.
[02:45:56.274 --> 02:45:57.775]  What were you in special forces training?
[02:45:59.106 --> 02:46:02.088]  Wilderness, yeah.
[02:46:02.128 --> 02:46:04.269]  My own little struggle with myself.
[02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.650]  How's that?
[02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:07.512]  Well, your brain starts to shrink.
[02:46:07.532 --> 02:46:08.232]  I can definitely feel that.
[02:46:08.252 --> 02:46:10.574]  My tongue was just about
[02:46:17.108 --> 02:46:18.109]  Cracked and parched.
[02:46:18.129 --> 02:46:18.910]  My lips are parched.
[02:46:19.390 --> 02:46:21.572]  Your body starts to kind of eat itself.
[02:46:21.792 --> 02:46:23.814]  Your joints are like they're on fire.
[02:46:24.235 --> 02:46:28.078]  And when you start drinking water again, that's painful in and of itself.
[02:46:29.539 --> 02:46:32.102]  I live, you know, I'm kind of a survivalist.
[02:46:32.122 --> 02:46:34.364]  I like to push and test myself a bit.
[02:46:35.024 --> 02:46:40.990]  And I can tell you what, they push that woman farther than most healthy people could be pushed.
[02:46:41.210 --> 02:46:41.890]  No, I hear you.
[02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:42.171]  Thanks.
[02:46:42.811 --> 02:46:43.412]  Thanks, Rob.
[02:46:45.083 --> 02:46:46.344]  Uh, or Eric, excuse me.
[02:46:46.684 --> 02:46:48.124]  Rob in Wyoming's up next.
[02:46:48.244 --> 02:46:48.945]  So thank you, Eric.
[02:46:49.025 --> 02:46:49.745]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:46:49.765 --> 02:46:51.425]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:51.686 --> 02:46:53.946]  I want to tell you something that happened on the 21st of this month.
[02:46:54.446 --> 02:46:54.687]  Okay.
[02:46:54.707 --> 02:46:56.087]  I'll make it real concise.
[02:46:56.107 --> 02:47:01.669]  I got charged with assault for ejecting a trespasser on my mother's property.
[02:47:02.594 --> 02:47:08.275]  And the cops were really cool until this shaved head cop showed up and I found out later he terrorized my mother.
[02:47:08.795 --> 02:47:09.776]  Almost gave her a heart attack.
[02:47:09.796 --> 02:47:10.756]  She's a little old lady.
[02:47:11.196 --> 02:47:12.736]  Acting like there's a big terrorist alert.
[02:47:13.316 --> 02:47:15.157]  Okay, nobody arrested me or anything.
[02:47:15.357 --> 02:47:18.357]  Nobody even asked me for my driver's license, which is important to note.
[02:47:18.777 --> 02:47:21.558]  One quick side note, the citation is an admission of guilt.
[02:47:21.598 --> 02:47:22.598]  They've changed the wording.
[02:47:22.678 --> 02:47:24.439]  Okay, here's the main point.
[02:47:24.699 --> 02:47:28.199]  As I'm pulling out, and I found out this guy terrorized my mother and that makes my blood boil.
[02:47:28.919 --> 02:47:31.120]  As I'm pulling out, first I said to the officer,
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:37.021]  How come you haven't sworn a complaint out duly with an imprecation, so help me God, or something?
[02:47:37.561 --> 02:47:39.122]  He said he didn't know anything about that.
[02:47:39.142 --> 02:47:41.202]  I said, I'd like to charge her with harassment, too.
[02:47:42.322 --> 02:47:45.263]  He didn't have any zeal, didn't have any interest in that, so it was selective.
[02:47:45.463 --> 02:47:52.264]  So I said, okay, well I'm going to get you on the witness stand and ask you about why you are trying to avoid perjury and making this charge.
[02:47:52.964 --> 02:47:55.565]  The shaved head cop jumps in there and he says,
[02:47:56.753 --> 02:47:57.093]  Shut up!
[02:47:57.173 --> 02:47:57.653]  Be quiet!
[02:47:57.693 --> 02:47:58.414]  Zip your lip!
[02:47:58.634 --> 02:47:59.314]  I'm walking away.
[02:47:59.334 --> 02:48:00.034]  I'm leaving.
[02:48:00.074 --> 02:48:05.196]  I know, they think it's the military and you signed up for it and you're some new recruit at boot camp.
[02:48:05.397 --> 02:48:05.577]  Right.
[02:48:05.957 --> 02:48:07.077]  So I said, I'm walking away.
[02:48:07.137 --> 02:48:08.458]  I said, well, sir, I got it.
[02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:09.678]  It's called the First Amendment.
[02:48:10.078 --> 02:48:11.459]  I am going to get him on the witness stand.
[02:48:11.499 --> 02:48:13.260]  You know, I love how we call the cops, sir.
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:15.060]  I got pulled over the other night and I said, sir.
[02:48:15.301 --> 02:48:16.721]  And he was nice and said, sir, back.
[02:48:17.121 --> 02:48:19.482]  But most of them, you say, sir, they just get more arrogant.
[02:48:19.582 --> 02:48:21.103]  But don't let me miss my main point here.
[02:48:21.423 --> 02:48:22.364]  Well, make it quick, sir.
[02:48:22.404 --> 02:48:23.425]  He just wants to go on out.
[02:48:23.625 --> 02:48:24.105]  Go on out.
[02:48:24.205 --> 02:48:25.586]  He tries to get in the car.
[02:48:25.606 --> 02:48:26.867]  He fumbles with the latch.
[02:48:26.927 --> 02:48:27.748]  I lock the door.
[02:48:28.128 --> 02:48:30.390]  He gets so mad he hits the car and I drive away.
[02:48:30.470 --> 02:48:31.090]  Two weeks ago.
[02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.771]  That was the end of it.
[02:48:33.892 --> 02:48:34.392]  Interesting.
[02:48:34.593 --> 02:48:35.433]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:35.453 --> 02:48:37.275]  You're lucky he's not saying you try to run him over.
[02:48:38.195 --> 02:48:40.157]  More of your calls in the final segment.
[02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:41.998]  Stay the course with us.

[02:53:20.514 --> 02:53:25.955]  To all of the affiliates that have carried me for years, God bless you and thank you for your courage and your love of freedom and God.
[02:53:27.055 --> 02:53:33.621]  To all the listeners that have been so supportive and have gotten the videos and have supported us in other ways, you mean so much to me.
[02:53:34.722 --> 02:53:39.766]  I know I have shortcomings, but I want to thank you for everything you've done from the bottom of my heart and soul.
[02:53:40.266 --> 02:53:40.907]  I bless you.
[02:53:41.827 --> 02:53:44.329]  I just wanted to say so much more, but I'm out of time.
[02:53:45.010 --> 02:53:46.051]  Believe me, thank you.
[02:53:46.832 --> 02:53:47.272]  Thank you.
[02:53:47.452 --> 02:53:48.293]  I don't say that enough.
[02:53:48.333 --> 02:53:50.915]  I always mean to say that when I'm calm at home late at night.
[02:53:51.544 --> 02:53:58.128]  I think of all the good things and how thankful I am and I get in this combat mode on air and don't ever really let you know how I really feel.
[02:53:59.048 --> 02:54:00.969]  Charles in Texas and Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:54:01.009 --> 02:54:01.830]  Charles, go ahead.
[02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:10.694]  Hey Alex, do you think a lot of these rock musicians that are putting out a lot of dangerous music realize that they are being used to further destroy society?
[02:54:10.894 --> 02:54:20.420]  Well, they play the more savage, darker side, which feels good, but it is a dangerous path and I don't think a lot of them know.
[02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:20.980]  Some of them do.
[02:54:21.610 --> 02:54:26.415]  I know a lot of them have... Look at how destructive and unhappy their lives are.
[02:54:26.435 --> 02:54:29.398]  I know a lot of them have contacts with the O.T.O.
[02:54:29.439 --> 02:54:32.462]  and the Church of Satan and stuff like that.
[02:54:32.482 --> 02:54:39.009]  Also, have you ever seen the picture of Osama Bin Laden with Fidel Castro?
[02:54:40.370 --> 02:54:45.734]  No, I haven't seen that, but I do have confirmed real photos of him as a young man here as a CIA agent.
[02:54:46.214 --> 02:54:47.675]  Tim Osman was his codename.
[02:54:47.996 --> 02:54:54.681]  I remember seeing pictures of him with, uh, well, I saw the picture with him in Castro, and I think American Spectator, but I can't find it anywhere on the internet.
[02:54:55.321 --> 02:54:56.742]  Well, I think it was probably a joke.
[02:54:56.942 --> 02:54:57.643]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:58.724 --> 02:55:00.465]  Um, let's talk... I'm out of time.
[02:55:00.545 --> 02:55:00.865]  Thank you.
[02:55:01.386 --> 02:55:02.366]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[02:55:02.446 --> 02:55:03.327]  Ron, last caller.
[02:55:03.367 --> 02:55:03.787]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.588 --> 02:55:05.128]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:55:05.148 --> 02:55:05.889]  This is Tim in Ohio.
[02:55:06.684 --> 02:55:08.785]  Okay, I was told it was Ron Oklahoma, but go ahead Tim.
[02:55:08.825 --> 02:55:09.566]  That's okay.
[02:55:09.866 --> 02:55:11.426]  Very cryptic last night.
[02:55:11.466 --> 02:55:12.747]  I know you don't watch a lot of TV.
[02:55:12.887 --> 02:55:17.109]  I watch it's usually monitor looking for messages and signals and codes of them.
[02:55:17.469 --> 02:55:19.350]  The episode of South Park last night.
[02:55:20.031 --> 02:55:24.513]  They mentioned over and over and over this little boy Kenny that they kill off every episode.
[02:55:25.222 --> 02:55:32.106]  He was in a persistent vegetative state and the whole episode revolved about the removal of his eating tube.
[02:55:32.426 --> 02:55:33.467]  I could not believe it.
[02:55:33.747 --> 02:55:35.868]  You know how long it takes to turn around a program?
[02:55:36.669 --> 02:55:39.430]  Were they saying it was a good thing on the show?
[02:55:40.611 --> 02:55:42.332]  I was half asleep when I was going through it.
[02:55:42.412 --> 02:55:46.214]  I think it's going to be repeated again tonight at 10 o'clock Eastern, maybe 9 o'clock Central.
[02:55:46.514 --> 02:55:49.577]  I'll try to get it recorded and I'll get back with you tomorrow.
[02:55:49.637 --> 02:55:49.857]  Yeah!
[02:55:49.937 --> 02:55:50.598]  Hans Blix!
[02:55:50.658 --> 02:55:51.378]  Hans Blix, buddy.
[02:55:51.418 --> 02:55:52.820]  How you doing today, Hans Blix?
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:55.782]  What amazing former knowledge, or prior knowledge.
[02:55:55.802 --> 02:55:56.643]  Like, how would they know?
[02:55:56.723 --> 02:55:58.325]  I mean, this was like 14 days ago she did that.
[02:55:58.365 --> 02:56:00.086]  And you know how long it takes to turn a show.
[02:56:00.486 --> 02:56:07.012]  So there's no way they could have done that show without not knowing that... I don't... Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:56:07.032 --> 02:56:07.873]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:09.094 --> 02:56:10.235]  Is Ron Oklahoma there?
[02:56:10.255 --> 02:56:13.278]  Because I've given him the last 20 seconds.
[02:56:14.384 --> 02:56:15.145]  Ron, go.
[02:56:15.185 --> 02:56:15.905]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:56:15.925 --> 02:56:16.886]  You take us out of the show.
[02:56:17.146 --> 02:56:21.829]  Alex, Eric in Oklahoma just talked about how much trouble he had receiving.
[02:56:21.869 --> 02:56:24.771]  You were under information blackout here in Oklahoma.
[02:56:24.831 --> 02:56:30.954]  I'd like all of your listeners all over the world to contact all media, all relatives, all friends, families in Oklahoma.
[02:56:31.515 --> 02:56:32.155]  Spread the gospel.
[02:56:32.175 --> 02:56:33.016]  Tell them what's going on.
[02:56:33.036 --> 02:56:33.616]  God bless you.
[02:56:33.696 --> 02:56:33.976]  Yes.
