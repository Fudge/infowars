[00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.079]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:07.780]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.622]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.103]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:12.724]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:17.168]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:21.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.414]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:46.036]  It's already Thursday, the third day of March 2005.
[00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:48.617]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:59.802]  That Globe and Mail reporter who wrote the story about Hunter S. Thompson reportedly telling him that he was planning to put out a book
[00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:14.102]  Concerning government involvement in 9-11, he has confirmed that he did talk to Hunter S. Thompson, that he was friends with him, that Hunter S. Thompson was talking about such things.
[00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:19.747]  But he goes on to say maybe it was a suicide.
[00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:23.249]  So we'll be talking to that gentleman coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:29.234]  I want to take your calls, in fact I want to take a bunch of your calls in this first hour.
[00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:33.314]  And sometimes I do a good job of this, other times I don't.
[00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:35.394]  But I'm going to control myself today.
[00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:43.216]  I am going to come back after this quick break, cover just some of the news, some of the important news, some of the interesting news.
[00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:46.177]  Then we're going to go straight to your phone calls.
[00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:52.299]  But I'm going to give each caller about a minute, and then I'll comment for about 30 seconds.
[00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:53.339]  I'm going to control myself.
[00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.024]  Or if you have a question, I will limit myself to about a minute.
[00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:05.851]  We'll move to the next person, because so many people have tried countless times to get into this broadcast, and they have been unsuccessful.
[00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:08.974]  So, here is the toll-free number to get involved on air.
[00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.976]  Kind of open line Thursday here.
[00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:17.061]  Whatever issue you'd like to discuss, zero censorship will get you up and on the air.
[00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:18.323]  A true rarity here.
[00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:19.003]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:19.143]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.405]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:23.447]  Some good news, California's Spy Chip ID card ban.
[00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:29.211]  It's like four states, now about to be five states and hundreds of cities have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.040]  Now a bill's been introduced in California.
[00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:49.021]  Lord Schwarzenegger will try to block it, don't worry.
[00:02:49.041 --> 00:03:00.924]  He banned the state putting the spy chips in the driver's license through the federal law that has passed the House and is now in the Senate of the United States Congress.
[00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:09.465]  Of course, they passed the basic national ID card law last year, but now they're trying to radically expand it.
[00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:10.245]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:12.846]  North Korea makes missile test threat.
[00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:41.825]  uh... interesting article about what the vaccines are doing to the children several articles on this uh... that uh... will be going over and uh... teen tracker cell phones used to track teens every day i see an article promoting how cell phones track children and teens and how good it is folks all cell phones are tracked you can go to websites
[00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:50.953]  And enter somebody's phone number, if you have it, and then on a grid it'll show you where they are at all times.
[00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.734]  By law, all cell phones have this.
[00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:57.294]  But see, they introduce it as if it's for the children.
[00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.555]  They're not telling you about it in the news.
[00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:01.255]  Oh, it's for the children.
[00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:02.616]  It's for you, too.
[00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:06.517]  So I'll tell you about the plans and what it's going to be like under this.
[00:04:07.057 --> 00:04:12.038]  Also, ABC News, Robots to Watch Children Showcase.
[00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:27.907]  And the Pentagon announced two weeks ago, 70 plus billion dollars a year for robotic armies, ground-based and air-based systems that can be controlled by a tiny elite.
[00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:32.490]  Which is exactly what the globalists have always been after.
[00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.034]  That's just some of the news that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:39.376]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:47.809]  And again, we've got that guest, who's one of the last people to talk to, Hunter S. Thompson, coming on the broadcast.
[00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.850]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.672]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:05.356]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:09.979]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.482]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.903]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:17.404]  Panama.
[00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:21.889]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.897]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:31.040]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:41.846]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:47.389]  If you want to understand what the Newell Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.811]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:52.272]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.113]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:03.798]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.838 --> 00:06:08.040]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.061]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:13.663]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:22.487]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.028]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:28.370]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.350]  We're good to go!
[00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.197]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:07:57.995 --> 00:07:59.456]  Excluding Maryland and New York.
[00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:06.722]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:24.197]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today on this live Thursday edition.
[00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:49.268]  By the way, I've had a lot of requests for it, so tomorrow I'm going to re-air that interview we did with the scholar, the professor, out of Canada, studying all of the occult symbolism in the government buildings there, especially one of their legislature's capitals.
[00:08:50.407 --> 00:08:58.669]  So, that's coming up in the second half of the broadcast tomorrow for those that missed it, and for the hundreds of requests that I've gotten to re-air it.
[00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:04.590]  I was up till 4 in the morning last night, and we got it done.
[00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:10.171]  We got Marshall Law, 9-1-1, rise of the police state, done.
[00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:11.851]  This is how I always do it.
[00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:14.772]  I've spent 5 months making this video.
[00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:20.013]  The last 3 months, probably spending 10 hours a day on it, most days more than that.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.563]  And then I'll spend a couple hours posting something about it on the website and putting a link up to buy it.
[00:09:28.043 --> 00:09:42.110]  In fact, just go to Infowars.com and you can click through the secure online shopping cart and order your copy of Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.350]  It's my best work ever.
[00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:48.733]  Two hours thirty-five minutes long to be precise.
[00:09:49.765 --> 00:10:14.921]  right on the nose and uh... it is the cover is going to the printers that'll be done by tuesday and tomorrow the tape is going to be mass-produced and so we'll have the videos in about a week and we'll start shipping them out the door to you so if you want to be the first people to get martial law nine one one rise of the police state uh... in your mailbox
[00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:26.656]  Then go ahead and go to InfoWars.com and order it or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:10:28.618 --> 00:10:44.268]  By the way, when I get back on Monday, I'm going to go out of town this weekend, I'm going to finish working on authoring the DVD and send it off to be produced
[00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:51.392]  Mass-produced in another state and so we're not going to have the DVD for about a month.
[00:10:51.612 --> 00:10:54.795]  The DVD is going to have about five minutes of extra stuff on it.
[00:10:56.196 --> 00:10:59.378]  It takes time to get DVDs mass-produced.
[00:10:59.518 --> 00:11:00.639]  Time we don't have.
[00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:05.142]  We need to get this information out that's in martial law now.
[00:11:05.723 --> 00:11:10.827]  Not tomorrow, not next week, or not next year.
[00:11:10.907 --> 00:11:12.348]  It needs to happen now.
[00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:22.924]  And so I hope you'll order the VHS, and then later when the DVD comes out, you know, buy a copy of that for yourself and give the VHS as a gift.
[00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:33.786]  There's still more VHS machines in this country than there are DVDs, though everything's shifting over to that, and that's why some of my films are on DVD, like American Dictators and Road to Tyranny.
[00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:41.367]  The next project I'm doing after completing this one will be finishing the Arnold Schwarzenegger ads
[00:11:42.893 --> 00:11:45.816]  And announcing the contest winner for those produced ads as well.
[00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:47.938]  That'll take me a few weeks.
[00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:50.240]  Starting next week.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.243]  And then I'm going to put all my old films.
[00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:55.985]  Films I made in 1997, 1999, 2000.
[00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:59.468]  Some of my best work.
[00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:01.349]  I'm going to put all those on DVD.
[00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:06.073]  Which I could have already done, but I want to put some extras on and update them.
[00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:07.595]  That's going to be quite a job too.
[00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:13.014]  And I can only work so hard on this stuff.
[00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:17.337]  But again, I'm honored to be your host, and I'm honored that so many of you have supported us.
[00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:20.438]  And we need to get this video out to people now.
[00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:27.262]  It's a two and a half hour film, and uploading it to the web will take about three hours.
[00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:37.528]  Well, just recording it onto the computer takes about three hours, then uploading it takes about three hours, then we've got to break it down into Mac and PC format,
[00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:46.915]  Then we've also, at the same time, got to put still images from the film up on the site.
[00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:56.759]  So, by tonight, we're going to have the first third of Martial Law up on PrisonPlanet.TV for members.
[00:12:57.599 --> 00:13:02.681]  And by tomorrow afternoon, we'll have the entire film.
[00:13:03.442 --> 00:13:05.362]  But we'll have the first act.
[00:13:05.623 --> 00:13:06.643]  There's three acts in it.
[00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:19.939]  The first film, it's really three films, the first 45-minute film in this three-part film, that's really what Martial Law is, it's an epic, that will be uploaded by this evening.
[00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:23.501]  You'll be able to watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv if you're a member.
[00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:29.225]  And so for several weeks before anybody is able to get this in their mailbox,
[00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:42.735]  uh... because it'll be about a week till we have the videos and another week for to be shipped to you some cases just a few days so you'll get a job on everybody else in your prison planet dot tv members and it is fifteen
[00:13:45.018 --> 00:13:57.421]  Since a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, all of my films, Paul Watson's book, my book, dozens of other films, other books, my weekly TV reports, my best audio interviews.
[00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:59.301]  I sound a little strange today.
[00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:01.362]  I guess I push myself too hard.
[00:14:02.122 --> 00:14:11.284]  When I woke up this morning, after a delicious four hour sleep, it feels like somebody is sticking an ice pick in my back and my ribs.
[00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:18.367]  And it actually hurts to breathe, but I keep thinking, I almost thought about canceling the show today.
[00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:19.588]  I said, you know, I don't want to do that.
[00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.913]  I said, this will probably go away, but I don't know.
[00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.316]  My body's telling me, man, you need to start resting.
[00:14:29.396 --> 00:14:33.319]  I really have been working 17 to 18 hours a day the last month.
[00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.171]  Before that, it was like 60 hours a day.
[00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:37.491]  I'm not whining.
[00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:41.973]  It's been very rewarding, but it's kind of like, I guess, post-traumatic.
[00:14:42.473 --> 00:14:45.674]  Man, as soon as you get the job done, it's just like you collapse.
[00:14:46.474 --> 00:14:47.455]  I'm not even tired.
[00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:48.395]  It's just my back.
[00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:51.316]  You ever have your back hurt where it hurts to breathe?
[00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:53.003]  Oh, man.
[00:14:53.423 --> 00:14:55.424]  Anyways, let's take some calls.
[00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:56.705]  Robert in Ohio.
[00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:57.606]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:14:57.906 --> 00:14:58.426]  Hello, Alex.
[00:14:58.466 --> 00:14:59.787]  Thank you for being a true patriot.
[00:14:59.827 --> 00:15:01.288]  I've got a comment and a question.
[00:15:01.528 --> 00:15:01.909]  Welcome.
[00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:02.969]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:15:03.229 --> 00:15:08.293]  Yeah, I think the comment is, I think Hillary Clinton's going to go over to the Republican Party so she can win in the Republican Party.
[00:15:08.993 --> 00:15:14.137]  Okay, the question I have is, back in December you talked about a patriot that wrote a book called Alliance.
[00:15:14.377 --> 00:15:17.139]  I think Mr. Webb wrote it.
[00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:18.599]  Dark Alliance, yes.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.220]  Yeah, Dark Alliance.
[00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:20.766]  I ordered it online.
[00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:22.067]  I ordered it through two bookstores.
[00:15:22.127 --> 00:15:22.947]  I can't get it.
[00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:27.811]  Is there any way that somebody would know how I can get that book?
[00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:30.893]  Well, we don't carry Dark Alliance.
[00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:34.756]  But, I mean, I guarantee you can get it from Amazon.
[00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.177]  I guarantee you can get it from Barnes and Nobles.
[00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:40.840]  In fact, I haunt the bookstores in my off time.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.202]  And I have seen copies of Dark Alliance.
[00:15:44.602 --> 00:15:47.224]  You might call around to some used bookstores as well.
[00:15:47.845 --> 00:15:48.065]  Okay.
[00:15:48.607 --> 00:15:49.428]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:51.369]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:55.972]  I'll just say that Hillary Clinton... I disagree with you.
[00:15:56.272 --> 00:15:58.374]  Hillary Clinton will never be a Republican.
[00:15:58.674 --> 00:15:59.054]  Who knows?
[00:15:59.114 --> 00:16:04.258]  I never thought we'd see an Austrian who says he wants to be a dictator as governor, so maybe she will.
[00:16:04.938 --> 00:16:15.866]  But that is in the cards to run her against Schwarzenegger, and then conservatives will vote for the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, anti-American thinking they're fighting Hillary.
[00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:17.687]  I will vote for Hillary.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:29.728]  As in, and I can't stand Hillary Clinton, but yes, over some just scumbag who's Kurt Voltheim, his big buddy and his daddy, you know, helped hunt down Americans.
[00:16:30.849 --> 00:16:35.992]  And he says he loves Hitler and makes people get on their knees and call themselves ugly dogs.
[00:16:37.113 --> 00:16:40.135]  That's Parade Magazine reporting on that, Premier Magazine, excuse me.
[00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:42.877]  But I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:45.239]  Let's talk to Robert in Ohio.
[00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:46.600]  Robert, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:50.119]  We already talked to Robert.
[00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.539]  Andy in Texas.
[00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:52.460]  Andy, go ahead.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.221]  Hey, this is Andy Gonzalez, Texas.
[00:16:55.301 --> 00:17:12.431]  I just want to call and just tell you I appreciate, we all appreciate you down here and I just wanted to give you a heads up on a new article I read in a magazine about a company out of Shanghai bought a fiber optic line that crosses the entire globe
[00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.220]  From one continent to the other.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.001]  It was owned by another company.
[00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.803]  Yeah, they bought out Global Crossing, went bankrupt, and the CHICOMS bought it.
[00:17:22.283 --> 00:17:22.963]  Right, right.
[00:17:23.464 --> 00:17:27.445]  And the FBI, even the CIA said, we don't want this to happen.
[00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:31.847]  They went and made a plea to President Bush, and he said, okay, go ahead and do it.
[00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:35.789]  And now they own it for a fraction of what it was originally put up for.
[00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:37.190]  It was $247 million, and it was put up for $54 billion.
[00:17:41.455 --> 00:17:51.460]  What they do is they built the 66 Earth orbiting satellites that control the GPS system.
[00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:58.264]  The Bin Ladens were on the board of the company, then they bankrupted it on purpose and gave it to the government.
[00:17:59.084 --> 00:18:10.770]  So, I mean look, Jimmy Carter gave the Panama Canal to the Communist Chinese, and it could have been blocked, but then in 2000, Bill Clinton let it go forward, the Republican House and Senate voted for it,
[00:18:12.105 --> 00:18:14.126]  You've never heard a neocon talk about it?
[00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:15.126]  Right.
[00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.086]  This is a type of traitorous activity.
[00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:23.348]  Look, the CFR and other globalist think tanks have said, America is to be dismantled.
[00:18:24.048 --> 00:18:26.389]  Okay, by design, we're being brought down.
[00:18:26.449 --> 00:18:27.089]  Thanks for the call.
[00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:30.070]  That's what the open border is all of it's about.
[00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.990]  It is by design.
[00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.351]  We're to be brought down, okay?
[00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:39.552]  China will be the world model because they know how to treat their people like slaves.
[00:18:40.802 --> 00:18:42.963]  Andy in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:18:43.143 --> 00:18:46.265]  I'm sorry I'm dingy, I got these calls out of order.
[00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:47.326]  I just talked to Andy.
[00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.727]  Jimmy in Texas, go ahead Jimmy.
[00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:52.788]  Good afternoon, or still not, still morning anyway.
[00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:53.829]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:59.392]  Listen, I printed out the Popular Mechanics quote debunking.
[00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:07.596]  Of course they didn't, it was very short in comparison to all the quote conspiracies out there, but I had a specific question.
[00:19:08.325 --> 00:19:21.974]  Before I ask you, I'm not impressed with the DOD or the FEMA photos, you know, it's just a bunch of volleying, but last year, I did not notice, last year you had a retired Army Colonel Don DeGranBray?
[00:19:22.835 --> 00:19:23.115]  Yes.
[00:19:23.836 --> 00:19:27.578]  Okay.
[00:19:27.618 --> 00:19:36.985]  What gets me is that basically the rebuttal to that, what he said on your show was that the guy that he said
[00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:47.184]  I'm really having trouble following you.
[00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:52.369]  Well, hold me over then and I'll... I'll talk to you during the break and find out what you're talking about.
[00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.477]  All water isn't the same.
[00:20:03.757 --> 00:20:08.762]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:11.624]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:20:11.824 --> 00:20:20.352]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:20:20.712 --> 00:20:29.158]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:32.741]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:40.446]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[00:20:40.746 --> 00:20:42.727]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[00:20:42.787 --> 00:20:44.148]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[00:20:44.249 --> 00:20:49.072]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[00:20:49.392 --> 00:20:49.974]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[00:20:50.174 --> 00:20:50.555]  That's 888-727-8269.
[00:20:50.575 --> 00:20:51.899]  Or visit aquanorthwest.com.
[00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:01.495]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.575 --> 00:21:06.356]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:14.318]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:19.959]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:27.141]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:32.784]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.044 --> 00:21:37.767]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.107 --> 00:21:45.731]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.051 --> 00:21:51.535]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:55.497]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.477 --> 00:21:58.758]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:06.282]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:22:06.623 --> 00:22:16.728]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[00:22:17.408 --> 00:22:18.888]  With a 100% kill.
[00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:24.009]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural herb and spice products from North American Herb and Spice.
[00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:28.470]  Call 877-817-9829 to order or ask for a free catalog.
[00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:37.492]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Herb and Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Herb and Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[00:22:37.932 --> 00:22:43.073]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.
[00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:43.994]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:46.698]  That's 877-817-9829 and start down the road to herbal health.
[00:22:46.718 --> 00:22:48.621]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.
[00:22:48.661 --> 00:22:49.242]  The choice is yours.
[00:22:49.262 --> 00:22:52.367]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American Herb and Spice products today.
[00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:03.097]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:12.287]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:23:12.607 --> 00:23:17.272]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:23:17.732 --> 00:23:24.455]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:36.640]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.582]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:44.203]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:46.064]  And call them Alex Jones sends you.
[00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:47.264]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:48.805]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:23:48.825 --> 00:23:49.885]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:24:05.888 --> 00:24:06.729]  All right, Jimmy.
[00:24:07.449 --> 00:24:08.050]  In Texas.
[00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.291]  Finish up what you were saying, sir.
[00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:11.172]  Okay.
[00:24:11.472 --> 00:24:20.217]  Last year, February 2004, you had a retired Army Colonel, Don DeGranpre, saying that Flight 93 was taken out by the North Dakota Air Guard.
[00:24:21.038 --> 00:24:23.039]  He knew the pilots who fired those missiles.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.860]  They were sidewinders.
[00:24:25.241 --> 00:24:26.982]  Okay, it was a Major Rick Gidney.
[00:24:27.062 --> 00:24:31.264]  Now, Popular Mechanics has a response saying, fact.
[00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:35.127]  He was saying that Gidney was reluctant
[00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:36.769]  Yeah, actually...
[00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.451]  Don the Grand Prix did not say Gibney's name on air in the interview they mentioned.
[00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:09.593]  If you're specific, if you're looking at the actual article... You're right.
[00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:10.433]  You're right.
[00:25:10.473 --> 00:25:14.034]  Letroll911.org lied at Grand Prix.
[00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:15.274]  They say he's lying.
[00:25:16.054 --> 00:25:23.156]  And Don has been very quiet and secretive about which particular pilot.
[00:25:23.176 --> 00:25:24.737]  And I find it strange in the article
[00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:32.785]  That they say in there that the F-16s were ferrying around FEMA officials.
[00:25:32.825 --> 00:25:33.525]  Thanks for the call.
[00:25:33.986 --> 00:25:34.706]  I appreciate it.
[00:25:34.746 --> 00:25:38.368]  Look, I've talked about this.
[00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:47.393]  They also, in the same article, say that there was one F-16 intercept in the decade before September 11th.
[00:25:47.793 --> 00:25:48.093]  Uno.
[00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:53.356]  And they quote the head spokesman for NORAD.
[00:25:54.795 --> 00:25:55.857]  They quote the major.
[00:25:56.658 --> 00:25:59.143]  And then we found an Associated Press article.
[00:25:59.944 --> 00:26:04.012]  Just type that major's name into a search engine.
[00:26:04.614 --> 00:26:11.579]  And you'll get the Associated Press article where he said that they'd done it over 60 times in the year before 9-11.
[00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:18.483]  And everybody knows there was more than one F-16 intercept in the decade before 9-11.
[00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:21.725]  I mean, you don't have to even go check that out.
[00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:29.730]  You've all heard of the plane that gets off course and the F-16s escort it, or you fly over controlled airspace and F-16s escort you.
[00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.893]  I mean, every pilot listening has all heard about this happening to people or it's happened to them.
[00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:35.093]  I mean, it just happened.
[00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:37.794]  In fact, now that's actual intercepts.
[00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:40.115]  The jet's coming up next to you, threatening to shoot you down.
[00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:42.455]  There were hundreds of cases of them being launched.
[00:26:43.716 --> 00:26:50.998]  Then they say it took an hour and thirty minutes for the F-16s to get to Golfer Payne Stewart's plane.
[00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:51.298]  No.
[00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.799]  I have the USA Today articles.
[00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:56.500]  In fact, I have the new film that just came out.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.020]  Martial Law.
[00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:01.075]  From, you know, the day after it happened.
[00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:02.917]  I have a whole bunch of articles.
[00:27:03.317 --> 00:27:04.799]  We show like three or four of them in the film.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:13.207]  They didn't know the plane was off course until it had taken off in Florida, gotten out of Florida,
[00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:23.993]  And about an hour after it took off, they'd lost contact with it, and it wasn't responding to air traffic signals and communications.
[00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:31.418]  So then they launched the F-16s, and in 18 minutes, it was surrounded by six F-16s.
[00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:33.100]  Now, I got USA Today.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.481]  So, I mean, whatever.
[00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:35.061]  Okay?
[00:27:35.241 --> 00:27:39.184]  I just... And that's just... I could keep going on for hours if you'd like.
[00:27:40.145 --> 00:27:41.766]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:41.906 --> 00:27:42.447]  Ed, go ahead.
[00:27:42.487 --> 00:27:42.827]  Welcome.
[00:27:44.492 --> 00:27:46.895]  Ed just hung up, so we're having fun here.
[00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:48.737]  Jason in Maryland.
[00:27:48.797 --> 00:27:49.719]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:51.080]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:57.488]  I'm calling to talk about the fellow you had on yesterday, Douglas Wohal, or Wuhal, or what was his name?
[00:27:58.049 --> 00:27:59.330]  Yes.
[00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:03.896]  And he stated yesterday how he believes in the punctuated equilibrium theory.
[00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:08.854]  And I wanted to call and let your listeners know just exactly what that is.
[00:28:08.894 --> 00:28:23.363]  The Punctuated Equilibrium Theory is also called by its inventor, the Hopeful Monster Theory, which basically states... Well, that's because real scientists cannot... everything that they claimed about evolution is turning out to be untrue.
[00:28:23.623 --> 00:28:23.964]  Indeed.
[00:28:24.184 --> 00:28:26.965]  And so now they're saying, okay, stuff does happen overnight.
[00:28:27.186 --> 00:28:27.446]  Right.
[00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:32.309]  But it basically states that one day a lizard laid an egg and an eagle came out.
[00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:37.305]  And like you said, it came about because there's no evidence for the theory of evolution.
[00:28:37.345 --> 00:28:41.910]  Darwin himself said that the theory would be proven or disproven in one area, the fossil record.
[00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:47.485]  And proponents of the theory of evolution know that all the fossils appear in one level of strata.
[00:28:47.865 --> 00:28:48.946]  Well, let me just stop you.
[00:28:49.006 --> 00:28:53.909]  I mean, we know, you can watch bacteria evolve in a petri dish.
[00:28:53.969 --> 00:28:56.191]  So, species do change.
[00:28:56.291 --> 00:29:01.174]  But, see, I've never... The globalists set up false debates, okay?
[00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:03.376]  Scientists who were atheists
[00:29:04.312 --> 00:29:13.161]  Wanted to discredit Christianity, so they set up a debate, and we all joined in on it, and we've played into their plan.
[00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:15.643]  Who am I to say how God makes things?
[00:29:16.084 --> 00:29:17.725]  Who am I to say how God does things?
[00:29:18.086 --> 00:29:23.131]  I know that the official theory of how they say evolution takes place has been totally disproven.
[00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:27.032]  But do creatures change?
[00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:33.933]  I mean, have humans, because of better diet, gotten an average of like 7 inches taller in the last 100 years?
[00:29:34.093 --> 00:29:34.413]  Yes.
[00:29:35.254 --> 00:29:37.814]  Can you breed dogs and change their basic looks?
[00:29:37.894 --> 00:29:38.114]  Yes.
[00:29:38.354 --> 00:29:45.796]  But no, I mean, yeah, you don't have a chicken turn into a dinosaur or a possum turn into a Keebler elf.
[00:29:46.696 --> 00:29:49.897]  So, yeah, their big official story is a fraud.
[00:29:51.824 --> 00:29:52.727]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.228 --> 00:29:54.832]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.755 --> 00:29:58.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:07.783 --> 00:30:08.843]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:30:08.963 --> 00:30:09.824]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:12.785]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:17.846]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:28.990]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.

[00:30:34.314 --> 00:30:37.457]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:30:37.577 --> 00:30:42.981]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.

[00:33:05.322 --> 00:33:06.904]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.364 --> 00:33:10.127]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.547 --> 00:33:14.090]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:19.696]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.662]  We're back live here.
[00:33:26.722 --> 00:33:28.104]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:33:29.293 --> 00:33:46.016]  And I've got an article here that was in one of the big Canadian newspapers written by Paul William Roberts who knew Hunter S. Thompson and the story caused some confusion because it was a subscription article and the first part of the article was this quote
[00:33:47.296 --> 00:34:02.453]  By Hunter S. Thompson, supposedly mumbling before he hung up the phone saying they're going to kill me and they're going to make it look like a suicide because I'm going to do this story about what really made the towers come down.
[00:34:03.194 --> 00:34:06.458]  Then you read into the second part of the article, because I wasn't paid for it,
[00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:20.341]  And, uh, well, it says that, yes, he had talked to Hunter S. Thompson, and Hunter S. Thompson was working on some story about 9-11 and the government, and was worried about the government and, quote, engaged in conspiracies.
[00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:25.445]  And so, to really get to the bottom of this is Paul William Roberts.
[00:34:25.505 --> 00:34:27.106]  Paul, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:27.807]  My pleasure.
[00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:36.974]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and for those who don't know who Hunter S. Thompson was and what has happened to him.
[00:34:37.154 --> 00:34:54.979]  Well, I'm a writer and work in a similar vein to Thompson in that I write journalism but I sort of insert myself into the story, which is what Hunter Thompson pioneered in his own way.
[00:34:57.918 --> 00:35:03.519]  Writing pieces that were ostensibly political, but with himself as the main character.
[00:35:03.539 --> 00:35:16.502]  And in some cases, as with the one that was filmed, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, there's nothing other than the story of Hunter Thompson.
[00:35:16.542 --> 00:35:17.662]  There's nothing covered in it.
[00:35:18.162 --> 00:35:19.263]  So it's more like a novel.
[00:35:20.183 --> 00:35:25.904]  He was using the techniques of fiction, you know, to write journalism is essentially what he did.
[00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:28.242]  That's interesting.
[00:35:28.262 --> 00:35:30.484]  You know, that's kind of what I do in my documentary films.
[00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:39.595]  I go out and confront all these government officials and then, you know, it personalizes it and brings a real world flavor to it for people.
[00:35:39.635 --> 00:35:42.078]  I know that's kind of what Michael Moore does as well.
[00:35:42.158 --> 00:35:46.643]  So Hunter S. Thompson was one of the first in modern times to develop this.
[00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:49.900]  He pioneered it.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.242]  He pushed it a lot further.
[00:35:51.262 --> 00:36:01.913]  I mean, the form itself really goes back to the beginning of writing, but he pushed it to another level and made it infinitely more entertaining.
[00:36:02.234 --> 00:36:09.462]  And I think in doing so, he captured the interest of a generation that would have otherwise turned away from politics.
[00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:13.655]  What were some of the main stands?
[00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:19.242]  Obviously Hunter S. Thompson was known for extreme, hardcore drug use, being a wild man.
[00:36:19.923 --> 00:36:21.264]  They made a movie about him.
[00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:24.445]  Kind of a thumbnail sketch.
[00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:27.305]  How would you sum up the life of Hunter S. Thompson?
[00:36:27.926 --> 00:36:30.186]  He was first and foremost a journalist.
[00:36:30.326 --> 00:36:32.367]  He was a real political junkie.
[00:36:32.387 --> 00:36:34.007]  He was obsessed with politics.
[00:36:34.508 --> 00:36:35.568]  He lived and breathed it.
[00:36:36.768 --> 00:36:44.391]  The drug use is really exaggerated by himself as much as by anybody else.
[00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:51.413]  That's a typical technique of writing any form of account.
[00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.911]  It's an exaggeration to drive home an emotional point.
[00:36:58.011 --> 00:37:01.032]  But politics was his abiding obsession.
[00:37:03.872 --> 00:37:06.733]  People think of him as an extreme leftist.
[00:37:07.413 --> 00:37:07.793]  He wasn't.
[00:37:08.173 --> 00:37:10.894]  He was really more of a libertarian.
[00:37:10.914 --> 00:37:17.095]  His friends numbered people like Pat Buchanan, as well as people like Allen Ginsberg.
[00:37:20.117 --> 00:37:22.179]  Do you have the article you wrote in front of you?
[00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:22.859]  Yeah.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.682]  Do me a favor, read that first paragraph for us.
[00:37:26.102 --> 00:37:27.683]  Yeah, it should have been in italics.
[00:37:27.744 --> 00:37:30.346]  I don't know whether the version you saw was or not.
[00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:36.891]  The first paragraph was italicized so that it separates it from the rest of it.
[00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:39.414]  Come to telephone me on February the 19th.
[00:37:40.234 --> 00:37:43.857]  The night before his death, he sounded scared, really scared.
[00:37:44.357 --> 00:37:47.519]  It wasn't always easy to understand what he said, particularly over the phone.
[00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:52.222]  He mumbled, yet when there was something he really wanted you to understand, you did.
[00:37:52.802 --> 00:38:07.192]  He'd been working on a story about the World Trade Center attacks of September the 11th, and had stumbled across what he felt was hard evidence showing the towers had been brought down not by the airplanes that flew into them, but by explosive charges set off in their foundation.
[00:38:08.198 --> 00:38:11.441]  Now he thought someone was out to stop him publishing this information.
[00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:14.143]  They're going to make it look like suicide, he said.
[00:38:14.163 --> 00:38:16.244]  I know how these bastards think.
[00:38:18.226 --> 00:38:36.680]  And then you go on to say that you talked to him, and indeed he was doing this story, and indeed he was worried about people getting him, but then, but kind of in Hunter S. Thompson flair, though, you kind of congeal it all into this, into this amalgamation in this, in this quote.
[00:38:39.363 --> 00:38:39.723]  I'm sorry?
[00:38:40.863 --> 00:38:46.825]  Explain to me then, getting down to the nitty gritty, what did Hunter S. Thompson tell you?
[00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:51.826]  Did he tell you that he was doing a story on the Towers?
[00:38:51.886 --> 00:38:55.387]  Did he tell you he was afraid?
[00:38:55.407 --> 00:38:56.288]  He wasn't afraid.
[00:38:56.348 --> 00:38:57.468]  He didn't say he was afraid.
[00:38:57.488 --> 00:39:08.691]  He was bothered a lot by people who came around to where he lived because it was well known where he lived and the place was somewhat fortified.
[00:39:09.284 --> 00:39:34.300]  But he was working on many things at the same time, among which were, because of his deep loathing for George W. Bush, he became convinced that there was more to the 9-11 attacks than met the eye, as indeed many other people are saying.
[00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:42.686]  But there is a whole body of evidence that goes back to the designer of the building.
[00:39:42.706 --> 00:39:47.609]  The designer of the building said it was designed to have a plane that size fly into it.
[00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.412]  It was designed to have two planes?
[00:39:52.173 --> 00:39:57.456]  Well, it's the way it falls down, and the way the other building falls down within sort of 57 seconds.
[00:40:20.174 --> 00:40:22.500]  Uh... and dropped straight down on itself.
[00:40:23.222 --> 00:40:24.064]  Buildings like that...
[00:40:26.472 --> 00:40:37.096]  Uh, we're designed to come down at all, and it would not drop straight down, you know, and that's, that's the kind of... Well, look at the Madrid building that burned for two days with 100-foot white flames shooting out.
[00:40:37.356 --> 00:40:37.636]  Yeah.
[00:40:38.017 --> 00:40:49.121]  I mean, some little bitty, uh, you know, window dressing, aluminum melted, and some of the sheetrock's, uh, ceilings fell in, but none of the superstructure, the main supports, buckled.
[00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:54.863]  Uh, and in fact, the temperature, uh, inside was not hot, anything like hot enough to melt
[00:40:56.012 --> 00:40:57.313]  Uh, the girders.
[00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:03.937]  Yeah, steel starts melting at around 3,000 degrees, gets red hot at about 2,500 and starts weakening.
[00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.539]  And gasoline goes bang, and that's it.
[00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:10.962]  Your inferno stops with the explosion.
[00:41:10.982 --> 00:41:11.842]  Well, here's the evidence.
[00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:15.905]  You had people jumping out, yes, when it was first on fire.
[00:41:15.925 --> 00:41:20.408]  When the jet fuel burned out, you saw hundreds of people in the holes in the buildings.
[00:41:21.068 --> 00:41:24.651]  Where the quote hottest fires were for 20-30 minutes begging for help.
[00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:25.651]  Yeah.
[00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:33.657]  So it didn't melt them, but it melted four foot around solid steel beams sprayed with asbestos insulation.
[00:41:34.908 --> 00:41:41.775]  Yeah, it's surprising to find that a building like that would come down at all.
[00:41:42.536 --> 00:41:51.024]  It was like a metal mesh, like mosquito screening that you throw a dart at.
[00:41:51.064 --> 00:41:54.187]  The dart would just stick through a hole.
[00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.330]  Well, that's what we've actually got that video clip.
[00:41:58.397 --> 00:42:03.419]  On the website by one of the chief designers, who's dead now, but well, he won't be talking now.
[00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:05.519]  Let's get back to Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:12.342]  So, yes, describe how he lived, because, I mean, I have read he really lived in like an armored compound.
[00:42:13.122 --> 00:42:13.842]  Tell us about that.
[00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:25.246]  It was somewhat fortified, because he had a fairly crazy following, and people would come prowling around trying to get in.
[00:42:27.104 --> 00:42:30.806]  He was also famous for keeping an arsenal of guns there.
[00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:35.927]  But he was fairly sensible with guns.
[00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:45.211]  And although there was an accident that was made much of, it was actually nothing like it was blown up to be.
[00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:51.453]  He was, like anybody who has guns, very, very careful with them.
[00:42:52.544 --> 00:42:56.646]  Uh, that's why you can tell that it wasn't an accident when he showed himself.
[00:42:57.666 --> 00:43:09.010]  Okay, so he was telling you he was worried about the government, he was telling you that he thought the government was involved, he was doing a story, but in the article you say, but you think he committed suicide.
[00:43:10.031 --> 00:43:13.452]  Uh, when he was on the phone to his wife when he did it,
[00:43:16.446 --> 00:43:18.027]  I mean, that's the odd part.
[00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:20.148]  I don't know what they were talking about.
[00:43:20.168 --> 00:43:29.593]  He's saying, come home baby, you're at the gym, and I want you to come home, and then he supposedly shoots himself?
[00:43:30.894 --> 00:43:34.456]  I don't know what they were talking about, but I assume it was an argument.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.481]  Well, that's what it says in the newspaper here.
[00:43:37.901 --> 00:43:39.301]  And she heard a noise.
[00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.681]  She's given two different stories.
[00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:44.962]  First, she told a Colorado paper she didn't hear a noise.
[00:43:45.382 --> 00:43:47.843]  Then she told another paper she did hear a noise.
[00:43:48.663 --> 00:43:53.104]  But the noise she claims she heard doesn't sound to me much like a gun.
[00:43:53.124 --> 00:43:55.404]  I mean, you know, a gun.
[00:43:55.664 --> 00:43:57.725]  I mean, she describes a sort of clunking noise.
[00:43:59.305 --> 00:44:00.685]  Well, that could be a silencer.
[00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:08.204]  Well, what do you think happened to Hunter S. Thompson?
[00:44:09.145 --> 00:44:12.607]  I think all his life he suffered very badly from arthritis.
[00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:18.870]  His left hand was almost deformed and he was in considerable pain.
[00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.633]  He'd recently broken his hip and his leg.
[00:44:24.354 --> 00:44:29.797]  I think he was just miserable with pain and didn't like getting old.
[00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:36.378]  But the wife's describing something that didn't sound like a gunshot.
[00:44:37.478 --> 00:44:44.743]  Yeah, but again, very few of us have ever heard a gun go off in a room.
[00:44:44.823 --> 00:44:45.543]  It's deafening.
[00:44:46.324 --> 00:44:51.767]  And the audio fidelity of a telephone is not going to really carry that particularly well.
[00:44:52.127 --> 00:45:00.733]  You would probably just hear something like a clunk because it couldn't carry anything like that kind of, you know, the decibels.
[00:45:03.186 --> 00:45:06.808]  I don't know about that, but now, what about his final writings?
[00:45:06.888 --> 00:45:10.630]  Are we going to get a chance to... Have you talked to any of the family?
[00:45:11.391 --> 00:45:14.152]  Are we going to get a chance to see what his 9-11 story was?
[00:45:15.853 --> 00:45:25.239]  I don't know what shape that was in, but I think he felt that he'd come to an end of writing about politics.
[00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:29.561]  Because the last book on Bush, Hey Rube, it's called...
[00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:39.053]  He's almost at a loss for words to describe what he feels about Bush, and the writing is rather poor.
[00:45:39.714 --> 00:45:52.140]  In fact, he was working on a film script titled Polo Is My Life, which was a kind of love turned sour story that he was trying to peddle around Hollywood.
[00:45:54.281 --> 00:45:57.883]  So possibly he'd given up writing altogether.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.203]  Well, I know he was still writing for ESPN about the gridiron.
[00:46:03.603 --> 00:46:03.903]  Yeah.
[00:46:05.245 --> 00:46:06.045]  Yeah.
[00:46:06.145 --> 00:46:08.127]  And he did a fair bit of sports writing.
[00:46:08.147 --> 00:46:09.168]  That was his other love.
[00:46:10.749 --> 00:46:15.753]  I mean, you know, when he met Nixon, they talked about football and nothing else.
[00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:22.018]  Well, I guess they've already had the memorial service.
[00:46:23.319 --> 00:46:23.579]  Yes.
[00:46:23.719 --> 00:46:23.959]  Yeah.
[00:46:23.979 --> 00:46:27.742]  I mean, it was the, you know, quiet family affair.
[00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:35.963]  I still don't know whether anybody saw this coming, whether it was totally unexpected.
[00:46:36.603 --> 00:46:38.043]  I know the son found the body.
[00:46:41.284 --> 00:46:42.744]  And where did Hunter shoot himself?
[00:46:43.524 --> 00:46:44.285]  In the head, I think.
[00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:46.345]  Do you know where in the head?
[00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:48.506]  Through the mouth.
[00:46:50.606 --> 00:46:51.526]  Through the mouth?
[00:46:51.606 --> 00:46:52.006]  Yeah.
[00:46:53.007 --> 00:46:55.207]  Best way to do it.
[00:46:55.287 --> 00:46:58.268]  Any other specifics of what he said about 9-11 to you?
[00:47:02.566 --> 00:47:13.169]  Only that he was increasingly dubious about what had happened, and the more he looked into it, the more facts emerged.
[00:47:14.489 --> 00:47:18.029]  He was in touch with a very wide network of people.
[00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:25.471]  He knew an enormous number of people in all walks of life, some of them extremely high
[00:47:28.676 --> 00:47:30.498]  And they were agreeing with him?
[00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:50.403]  Well, certainly, you know, I was the first person
[00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:13.811]  Two months before 9-11, I said on TV and radio, I said, call the White House.
[00:48:14.271 --> 00:48:15.872]  They're going to attack the World Trade Center.
[00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:18.793]  Bin Laden, their CIA asset, will take the blame.
[00:48:18.833 --> 00:48:25.897]  And just so you know, because you're a prominent writer, Mr. Roberts, this is what happened on 9-11.
[00:48:26.117 --> 00:48:36.522]  They were running drills the month before, the week before, the morning of, of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Sears Tower, and what's that big pointy building in
[00:48:37.478 --> 00:48:39.739]  In San Francisco, I always forget the name.
[00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:40.960]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.761]  They were doing drills of all of that.
[00:48:42.801 --> 00:48:45.662]  I have all the documents and I even had this before it was in the Associated Press.
[00:48:46.242 --> 00:48:52.365]  They were doing drills of flying those planes into the building so NORAD itself would stand down until the first plane hit.
[00:48:52.445 --> 00:48:58.068]  Then Cheney was in control of NORAD three months before he took control from the generals back to just himself.
[00:48:59.153 --> 00:49:12.607]  The so-called hijackers were CIA assets who were taking part in live-action drills where they would simulate by putting them on the plane and had air marshals out there testing to see if they'd be able to intercept them.
[00:49:13.648 --> 00:49:17.652]  Remember the week before 9-11, James Woods, the actor, was flying from New York to L.A.
[00:49:18.152 --> 00:49:19.333]  The plane had stopped in Phoenix.
[00:49:19.353 --> 00:49:21.075]  He got off the plane and said, there's five guys.
[00:49:21.415 --> 00:49:22.396]  One of them was Muhammad Atta.
[00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:25.038]  They're doing some kind of drill of hijacking the plane.
[00:49:25.278 --> 00:49:27.600]  The FBI said, shut your mouth, it's national security.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.381]  So what happened is, they're decoys.
[00:49:29.401 --> 00:49:30.803]  They get on, think it's part of a drill.
[00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:33.845]  Gas is released, kills everybody on board.
[00:49:34.125 --> 00:49:36.808]  Remote control takes control and flies the planes into the buildings.
[00:49:37.448 --> 00:49:39.650]  And so that's what happened on 9-11, just in case you wanted to know.
[00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:41.797]  Well, that's pretty extraordinary.
[00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:52.000]  And I don't doubt that it's true, because I'm, in some of those facts, I'm aware of, but nothing like the rest you just told me.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.962]  But I mean, there were no Arabs on that plane.
[00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:06.834]  Well, according to the official manifest, there are no Arabs because these were officers and they had to keep their names off the list.
[00:50:07.335 --> 00:50:12.921]  Their houses, their cars, their credit cards were paid for by the FBI and CIA when they'd leave the country.
[00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:15.744]  And the embassies wouldn't let them back in.
[00:50:15.784 --> 00:50:17.966]  They would be ordered by the CIA to let them back in.
[00:50:18.527 --> 00:50:19.288]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:50:19.328 --> 00:50:20.048]  military bases.
[00:50:20.068 --> 00:50:21.270]  They were government officers.
[00:50:22.646 --> 00:50:24.386]  And they did indeed get on those planes.
[00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:29.548]  That's why they have the video of it, but their names were not on the manifest because it was part of a drill.
[00:50:29.968 --> 00:50:31.768]  American and United took part.
[00:50:32.388 --> 00:50:36.169]  That's why you see only 20% on each of the four planes.
[00:50:36.189 --> 00:50:36.709]  Did you know that?
[00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.890]  No.
[00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.870]  20% occupancy, yeah.
[00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:46.272]  A malfunction at American and United on a day with 80 plus percent occupancy on the East Coast, only 20% on each of the four planes.
[00:50:47.332 --> 00:50:51.053]  Right, and the fact that there was no fighter sent up to shoot
[00:50:52.865 --> 00:50:54.906]  Not being at least a third one down.
[00:50:55.187 --> 00:50:55.767]  Now stay there.
[00:50:55.807 --> 00:50:58.229]  Let's talk more about Hunter S. Thompson when we get back.
[00:50:58.249 --> 00:50:59.049]  We'll take your calls too.
[00:51:02.151 --> 00:51:09.576]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:14.579]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.779 --> 00:51:20.423]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.643 --> 00:51:32.566]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.586 --> 00:51:37.108]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.288 --> 00:51:39.788]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.008 --> 00:51:45.930]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional
[00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:46.531]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:07.340]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.643]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.923 --> 00:52:22.286]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.586 --> 00:52:29.632]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.933 --> 00:52:34.757]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.977 --> 00:52:40.382]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:43.765]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:52.089]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:02.108 --> 00:53:02.649]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.529 --> 00:53:18.129]  I think so.

[00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:15.772]  We have wide open phones today.
[00:54:15.792 --> 00:54:18.873]  And we're going to be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:20.374 --> 00:54:25.735]  I'll tell you, if our guest would like to ride shotgun with us for another 30 minutes to the next hour, he's welcome to.
[00:54:26.176 --> 00:54:28.216]  If he needs to go, he can leave right now.
[00:54:28.276 --> 00:54:29.437]  He's Paul William Roberts.
[00:54:30.097 --> 00:54:32.658]  He was friends with new Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:54:33.471 --> 00:54:56.409]  And, uh, in the days before he died, I've been, you know, talking to him, uh, discussing, well, I think the government was behind 9-11, probably was behind 9-11, I think the, you know, the government might try to get me, this is scary stuff, and then he supposedly commits suicide, and, uh, well, I know Dr. David Kelly, the portin' down bioweapons lab chief, and UN weapons inspectors said the government was lying.
[00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.692]  I know he said they're gonna kill me and put me in the woods, and then he,
[00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:10.175]  Slit his wrist, there was no blood at the scene, undigested pills in his stomach, and people saw men in black uniforms around his body that ran off from the police, but the family says, oh no, it's a suicide!
[00:55:10.215 --> 00:55:21.804]  And Gary Webb told people that, yeah, I've been getting threatening calls, and I've been being followed, and people have been sneaking around in my house, and then he shoots himself twice in the head, and the family says, oh, it's a suicide!
[00:55:22.624 --> 00:55:30.110]  And Princess Diana says, Prince Charles just told me he's gonna kill me, and it's gonna look like an auto accident, and six months later that she dies in an auto accident.
[00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:31.322]  I don't know.
[00:55:31.382 --> 00:55:33.003]  I guess it's just all suicide.
[00:55:33.043 --> 00:55:36.825]  I mean, maybe some of them are, maybe some of them aren't, but where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:55:36.845 --> 00:55:39.746]  Do you have any comments on that, Mr. Roberts?
[00:55:39.886 --> 00:55:42.687]  Well, I just published a book on the Iraq War.
[00:55:42.787 --> 00:55:45.808]  I was there during the bombing and after.
[00:55:48.042 --> 00:55:52.284]  I can tell you that everything that came out about that was a tissue of lies.
[00:55:54.105 --> 00:56:02.450]  They knew full well, long, long in advance that there were no weapons of mass destruction there because they keep quoting Hussein Camel, Saddam's brother-in-law.
[00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:08.055]  About the quantities of toxins that had been amassed.
[00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.938]  But his own quotes... He also said they'd been destroyed.
[00:56:11.378 --> 00:56:11.899]  Well, that's it.
[00:56:11.939 --> 00:56:17.504]  His own quotes and testimony where they'd been destroyed in the 91 war and the year after.
[00:56:17.985 --> 00:56:18.225]  Right.
[00:56:18.846 --> 00:56:19.066]  Right.
[00:56:19.146 --> 00:56:22.769]  I mean, they quote the bit they like and they leave out the rest.
[00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:27.054]  That'd be like if I said, I love cars.
[00:56:28.081 --> 00:56:34.263]  And then, my whole sentence was, I love cars, I like to drive them.
[00:56:34.663 --> 00:56:38.545]  It'd be like if they said, I like cars, and they added, and I like to steal them.
[00:56:39.485 --> 00:56:43.387]  But I never said I like to steal them, but look, he loves cars, he likes to steal them.
[00:56:44.407 --> 00:56:57.752]  I once interviewed Saddam, and at one point he told me that he'd asked a senior American diplomat during the Iran-Iraq War, when he discovered that America was arming both sides
[00:56:58.851 --> 00:57:02.694]  He said, off the record, can you tell me who do you want to win this war?
[00:57:03.235 --> 00:57:09.239]  And the diplomat replied, off the record, we'd be happy if both sides lost.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.681]  Which is what happened, of course.
[00:57:13.703 --> 00:57:18.466]  So it's all about creating as much destabilization and death and destruction as possible.
[00:57:18.987 --> 00:57:23.230]  Well, I mean, chaos, as long as it's somebody else's, is much easier to operate in.
[00:57:25.725 --> 00:57:34.490]  I mean, that's why they're trying to force a civil war, because it's a good excuse to carry on with what they want to do there and remain there.
[00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:39.493]  So the globalists are bringing order out of chaos?
[00:57:41.775 --> 00:57:52.801]  No, I think they're... It's the same process you saw at the end of the British Empire, you know, when Pakistan was created, you know, a country created in two pieces 2,000 miles from each other.
[00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:54.905]  They create the crisis and then bring their order.
[00:58:10.689 --> 00:58:16.410]  Well, I tell you what, I'd like to hear about your Saddam Hussein interview and talk to you a little bit more just about yourself.
[00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:18.430]  You're a very interesting individual.
[00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.191]  Can you stay with us into the next hour?
[00:58:20.211 --> 00:58:20.971]  I sure can.
[00:58:21.271 --> 00:58:30.753]  Alright, we're talking to journalist and writer Paul William Roberts, and we're going to take your calls when we get back on a whole plethora of issues, and I'm sure you can comment on that.
[00:58:31.293 --> 00:58:32.573]  Call the free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:32.613 --> 00:58:34.773]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and my new film
[00:58:38.977 --> 00:58:40.158]  It was done at 4 a.m.
[00:58:40.178 --> 00:58:43.180]  this morning and that sucker's gone off of the printers to being mass-produced.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.822]  So, uh, you can start buying it now if you want.
[00:58:46.282 --> 00:58:47.022]  My best work.
[00:58:47.143 --> 00:58:47.883]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:49.064 --> 00:58:49.384]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.852 --> 00:58:59.933]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.634 --> 00:59:01.755]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.376 --> 00:59:03.237]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.958 --> 00:59:04.858]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.879 --> 00:59:09.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.724 --> 00:59:13.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.419 --> 00:59:36.442]  Alright folks, we're now into the second hour on this live Thursday edition.
[00:59:36.582 --> 00:59:41.246]  Scott, and Matt, and Pam, and Glen, and Ron, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:41.566 --> 00:59:48.711]  We're talking to a renowned journalist and writer, Paul William Roberts, wrote a story for the Globe and Mail up in Canada.
[00:59:49.389 --> 00:59:50.690]  Paul, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:00:16.935 --> 01:00:20.676]  Scott in Texas, thanks for holding, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:00:21.036 --> 01:00:21.657]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:22.297 --> 01:00:28.799]  Yeah, I was just wondering if you guys might be able to clear up something that I had heard through the journalist Sherman Skolnick.
[01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:40.523]  He's reporting that another story that, or book, I don't remember exactly which, that Hunter S. Thompson was working on was about this gay prostitution ring in the White House.
[01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:49.130]  And supposedly, that was another touchy topic that he brought out in the hole.
[01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.211]  Had you heard that from Hunter?
[01:00:51.831 --> 01:00:54.673]  Yeah, I'd heard that quite a lot from Hunter.
[01:00:56.474 --> 01:00:58.275]  It goes back to Kissinger, I believe.
[01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.637]  Wow, now that's a big confirmation.
[01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:10.082]  Now, for those who don't know, we have Washington Times articles from 1989, you know, underage coal boys in the White House.
[01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.808]  And so this is serious.
[01:01:13.248 --> 01:01:14.548]  Hunter was working on that.
[01:01:15.068 --> 01:01:15.408]  Yeah.
[01:01:15.868 --> 01:01:18.549]  In fact, Lyndon LaRouche published some stuff about that.
[01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:29.593]  And although a lot of his material was not that trustworthy, in this particular case, there were a lot of sources cited and there was no lawsuit.
[01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:34.014]  And with no lawsuit, you can be almost guaranteed that it's true.
[01:01:34.514 --> 01:01:40.716]  And I'm wondering if that might not be a hotter issue otherwise, because
[01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:48.960]  You know, you get into the Jeff Gannon case, and the whole gay prostitution, that's a national security issue.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:02.451]  Well, I mean, Skolnik's saying that now, we're talking about some of the fake reporters, and we know that, again, I haven't confirmed that part of the story, but I'd like to get some confirmation on that.
[01:02:02.811 --> 01:02:06.394]  Yeah, and also, it's interesting too, because it dovetails with
[01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:16.861]  Uh, tying in Jeff Gannon to possibly being the leak that, you know, leaked the story about Valerie Plame to Robert Novak.
[01:02:18.644 --> 01:02:19.744]  Well, let me just add this.
[01:02:19.764 --> 01:02:25.688]  I mean, we have the New York Post, top gay porn star services moguls at Bohemian Grove.
[01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:35.534]  I mean, I have parade magazine articles, spy magazine articles from the 80s where, as I said, they bust in the gay prostitutes like beluga caviar for our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:02:36.114 --> 01:02:38.696]  And is that what Hunter S. Thompson was on to?
[01:02:39.897 --> 01:02:45.042]  He certainly knew all about that, and I believe had written about it.
[01:02:45.182 --> 01:02:51.548]  I don't know whether there was a book in the works, but he certainly had published columns on it.
[01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:59.355]  And supposedly there were some upcoming interviews with Rolling Stone Magazine, although I'm not able to confirm that one or not.
[01:03:01.217 --> 01:03:02.918]  Well, it looks pretty suspicious.
[01:03:05.885 --> 01:03:06.686]  Man, I tell you.
[01:03:07.527 --> 01:03:23.705]  And supposedly CNN did a small report on the Gannon case and they were called by Andrew Card and Card threatened that he would yank their satellite if they continued on with the story.
[01:03:23.745 --> 01:03:26.308]  So there's been virtually a media silence on that.
[01:03:26.855 --> 01:03:28.958]  On the whole homosexuality.
[01:03:28.998 --> 01:03:31.581]  That's right, CNN uses military satellites.
[01:03:32.923 --> 01:03:36.788]  CNN has done an odd sort of turnaround in the last year or so.
[01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:38.510]  Yeah, they're pretty neocon now.
[01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.232]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.373 --> 01:03:43.416]  We'll be right back with our guest, unbelievable.
[01:03:43.957 --> 01:03:45.619]  Stay with us folks, a lot more coming up.
[01:03:53.075 --> 01:03:57.398]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:02.022]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.182 --> 01:04:06.526]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.586 --> 01:04:07.947]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.647 --> 01:04:09.468]  Can emerge.
[01:04:09.729 --> 01:04:13.953]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:20.961]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:23.084]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:33.866]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:39.447]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:56.273 --> 01:05:58.995]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:05:59.175 --> 01:06:00.556]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:06:00.736 --> 01:06:10.644]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:06:10.864 --> 01:06:12.585]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[01:06:12.865 --> 01:06:16.748]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[01:06:16.968 --> 01:06:21.410]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.453]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[01:06:25.673 --> 01:06:31.877]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:34.878]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:38.421]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.

[01:06:44.644 --> 01:06:45.304]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.021]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.741 --> 01:07:01.822]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.483 --> 01:07:03.323]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.064 --> 01:07:05.985]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.005 --> 01:07:09.488]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:13.951]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.192 --> 01:07:18.174]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:19.034]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:19.154 --> 01:07:22.397]  8 minutes, 30 seconds into the second hour of the third day of March 2005.
[01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:22.897]  Already!
[01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:23.257]  Already!
[01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:32.104]  The third month of 2005.
[01:07:32.224 --> 01:07:33.485]  It is unbelievable.
[01:07:33.505 --> 01:07:35.346]  I'm just now getting used to saying 2005.
[01:07:36.207 --> 01:07:46.074]  I tell you, I've been pleasantly surprised by the depth and breadth of knowledge of our guest, who is a renowned journalist, Paul Roberts.
[01:07:46.134 --> 01:07:47.054]  Paul William Roberts.
[01:07:47.194 --> 01:07:53.158]  And he has his new book out, which has won a lot of big awards, but you can't even get it published here in the U.S., but you can get it over the Internet.
[01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:55.420]  A War Against Truth.
[01:07:56.224 --> 01:08:05.530]  And he was friends with Hunter S. Thompson, who he talked to before he died and was saying, I believe the government was probably involved in 9-11.
[01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.871]  The towers, I think I have evidence, were blown up.
[01:08:07.991 --> 01:08:09.712]  I mean, we have the owner saying they blew it up.
[01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:16.697]  And he was also, we just had a caller brought up what Sherman Skolnick raised.
[01:08:17.376 --> 01:08:23.938]  About when I have the Washington Times articles and others from the late eighties, an underage coal boy ring in the White House.
[01:08:23.998 --> 01:08:34.580]  It's like Barney Frank gets caught with the under-aged people and he doesn't get in trouble running a coal center out of his penthouse.
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.961]  I mean, this is... You talk about just incredible standards.
[01:08:38.621 --> 01:08:45.443]  But, you know, for Democrats, you catch a Democratic governor with his boyfriend, he has to leave, but the Republican congressman
[01:08:46.507 --> 01:08:53.673]  You know, have got their male mistresses tucked all over the place and everybody knows about it.
[01:08:53.733 --> 01:08:55.875]  It's just, don't talk about it or you're an evil liberal!
[01:08:57.021 --> 01:08:59.564]  You know, you talk about the open borders, you're an evil liberal.
[01:08:59.584 --> 01:09:02.407]  You talk about how you're for the Second Amendment, you're an evil liberal.
[01:09:02.427 --> 01:09:05.910]  You talk about how you're against lying and invading countries, you're an evil liberal.
[01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.273]  You talk about how you're against torturing people to death, you're an evil liberal.
[01:09:10.154 --> 01:09:11.636]  And it just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:09:11.656 --> 01:09:16.981]  But we're going to go back to your calls, but I want to go back to our guest who, among other things, has interviewed people like Saddam Hussein.
[01:09:17.001 --> 01:09:18.122]  I want to get into that with him.
[01:09:18.795 --> 01:09:22.516]  He had all manner of material like that because he'd built up over 40 years, he'd built up quite a network of contacts.
[01:09:46.674 --> 01:09:52.760]  Yeah, he'd been a pilot in the Air Force before that, so he knew how to talk to all kinds of people.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:10:09.274]  I remember as far back as the Kissinger days, him talking about Kissinger meeting boys in, I forget which hotel it was in New York, but it was the same information that Lyndon LaRouche published.
[01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:12.886]  And there's never been a lawsuit over it.
[01:10:13.347 --> 01:10:15.108]  No, which is a sure sign.
[01:10:15.328 --> 01:10:22.052]  But, I mean, the Republicans could do what they like, and the liberals are dirty commies, you're right.
[01:10:23.813 --> 01:10:26.275]  And, I mean, look at George Bush's father.
[01:10:26.815 --> 01:10:35.680]  He had his mistress with him while he was in China, made sure she got a high position when he came back.
[01:10:37.522 --> 01:10:39.723]  And she went everywhere with him.
[01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:49.351]  Clinton, you know, has a little, you know, furtive sling in the Oval Office, and the man is crucified.
[01:10:50.912 --> 01:10:52.332]  And again, I'm not defending Bill Clinton.
[01:10:52.612 --> 01:10:58.255]  He's a corporate shill, but this national schizophrenia is dangerous.
[01:10:58.715 --> 01:10:59.395]  Very dangerous.
[01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:00.356]  Very dangerous.
[01:11:00.636 --> 01:11:08.199]  But, you know, the world is turning its back on America, and another four years of Bush
[01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:11.670]  It's going to be disastrous for the country.
[01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:21.495]  The Europeans are ignoring every request, every coercion.
[01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:36.304]  And when you think about it, America is doing exactly what the Soviet Union did towards the end, rely totally on big weapons and threats instead of spreading democratic freedoms.
[01:11:37.715 --> 01:11:47.948]  I mean, I watched Bush's speech when he was sworn in a few months ago, and literally he said liberty and freedom.
[01:11:48.449 --> 01:11:53.815]  He said liberty 24 times, freedom I think 16 times.
[01:11:54.156 --> 01:11:55.217]  He said tyranny like 14 times.
[01:11:56.593 --> 01:11:59.534]  We actually counted it up and put it in this new film I came out with.
[01:11:59.914 --> 01:12:01.715]  And he talked about spreading freedom.
[01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:03.696]  They put the Ba'athists back in.
[01:12:04.016 --> 01:12:06.037]  They're running torture chambers everywhere.
[01:12:06.377 --> 01:12:08.418]  The troops are sleeping in their tanks.
[01:12:09.138 --> 01:12:12.899]  I mean, it is a total fraud!
[01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:16.001]  And they have the nerve to accuse other people of human rights abuses.
[01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:19.422]  Oh, by the way, the Army's own report
[01:12:20.171 --> 01:12:23.673]  Says that they did things with battery acid that Jeffrey Dahmer did.
[01:12:23.993 --> 01:12:24.373]  Literally.
[01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:29.356]  Jeffrey Dahmer would take acid and do things to people in their orifices.
[01:12:29.877 --> 01:12:32.618]  And this is what our CIA torture people do.
[01:12:32.718 --> 01:12:34.399]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:39.982]  I mean, in one year they managed to do everything that Saddam had ever done to his people.
[01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.644]  Except he'd done it over 30 years.
[01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.506]  And again, Saddam was our boy.
[01:12:47.286 --> 01:12:51.208]  That was definitely your boy, yeah.
[01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.189]  And even the Kuwait war.
[01:12:54.929 --> 01:13:02.853]  The last meeting he has with a senior American official with April Glaspy, the ambassador of Baghdad, just before the invasion of Kuwait.
[01:13:02.973 --> 01:13:04.734]  Yeah, go ahead and invade!
[01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:06.314]  We don't have any agreements with Kuwait!
[01:13:07.935 --> 01:13:14.558]  She says three times to him, Secretary of State James Baker has told me to tell you we have no opinion on your Arab-Arab dispute.
[01:13:15.518 --> 01:13:17.900]  We will not get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:18.481]  Right.
[01:13:18.741 --> 01:13:23.785]  And he tells her three times he's going to resort to a military solution.
[01:13:24.326 --> 01:13:40.961]  And when she defended herself in the New York Times, because she was scapegoated at one point, she said that nobody, no analyst, whether in Riyadh or in Washington, thought that Saddam would take all of Kuwait, by which you can infer that it would have been okay if he'd taken part of Kuwait.
[01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:46.625]  Well, number one, Kuwait was always part of what Iraq is today.
[01:13:46.645 --> 01:13:48.428]  The British just carved it up.
[01:13:48.569 --> 01:13:48.809]  Right.
[01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:55.702]  In a legitimate territorial dispute they had, the Kuwaitis owed him a lot of money for defending them against the Iranians.
[01:13:56.845 --> 01:14:06.427]  But then they hired a big PR firm with a daughter of a PR firm owner who'd never even been in Kuwait and she's standing up there.
[01:14:06.467 --> 01:14:10.308]  I saw the incubators, the babies, and that's now admitted to be a total lie.
[01:14:10.348 --> 01:14:13.288]  Yeah, but it's an old story from the First World War, I believe.
[01:14:15.769 --> 01:14:21.970]  The Germans were supposed to have hurled Belgian babies out of incubators, but nothing of the sort happened.
[01:14:23.163 --> 01:14:24.163]  Well, it's the same M.O.
[01:14:24.203 --> 01:14:25.384]  with W.M.D.
[01:14:25.404 --> 01:14:28.425]  Now they say, though, I've got Rumsfeld on tape on Face the Nation.
[01:14:28.445 --> 01:14:30.486]  He said, I never said it was about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:14:30.706 --> 01:14:32.427]  That's an urban legend, a conspiracy.
[01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:34.728]  And then we've got 50 clips of him saying it.
[01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:37.329]  Yeah, like it's nothing to do with oil, right?
[01:14:38.049 --> 01:14:42.251]  But, I mean, they have the nerve to say we never said it was about W.M.D.
[01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:44.032]  It was about spreading democracy.
[01:14:45.842 --> 01:14:47.182]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:14:48.022 --> 01:14:49.563]  We all remember them saying that.
[01:14:49.823 --> 01:14:50.083]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.523 --> 01:14:53.364]  Well, after the war, you spread the demography.
[01:14:54.224 --> 01:15:03.866]  I mean, the idea that the whole country is going to be... that you've been bombing consistently virtually every day for 13 years is going to be happy to see your soldiers.
[01:15:06.106 --> 01:15:10.527]  But I couldn't believe how badly treated the American troops were over there.
[01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:13.928]  I mean, when they arrived in Baghdad, they hadn't showered in three months.
[01:15:13.948 --> 01:15:14.908]  They hadn't called home.
[01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:16.800]  I didn't know where they were.
[01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:19.647]  I felt really sorry for them and they were pissed off.
[01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:21.593]  By the way, that's not a joke.
[01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:22.876]  We've had the troops on air.
[01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:23.778]  It's been in the news.
[01:15:24.463 --> 01:15:27.765]  They get one meal a day, unless they pay for their meals.
[01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:32.227]  They're told they have to then wash their clothes, and Halliburton charges them for that.
[01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:36.629]  If they get a leg blown off, they discharge them at Rammstein, then they have to pay.
[01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:45.773]  Families have to get together and, you know, have potluck dinners, or cakewalks, to bake sales to get money to fly them back from Germany.
[01:15:46.053 --> 01:15:48.074]  I know, it's just, it's really sad.
[01:15:48.094 --> 01:15:51.976]  It's the first time I realize, looking at them, that this is cannon fodder.
[01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.637]  Nobody cares what happens to them.
[01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:57.590]  Well, supporting them means you really don't support them.
[01:15:57.871 --> 01:16:03.171]  Supporting them means you just mindlessly fly a plastic flag made by Chinese slaves.
[01:16:03.612 --> 01:16:07.732]  Yeah, and you have a machine to sign the letters of condolence for you.
[01:16:09.092 --> 01:16:10.233]  Let's take a call here.
[01:16:10.553 --> 01:16:14.193]  Let's talk to... Oh, who is up next here?
[01:16:15.113 --> 01:16:16.594]  Matt in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:16:16.654 --> 01:16:17.094]  Go ahead.
[01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.074]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:16:18.214 --> 01:16:18.654]  Good, sir.
[01:16:19.534 --> 01:16:22.855]  Are you familiar with the documentary Brothers on Holy Ground?
[01:16:23.835 --> 01:16:23.955]  No.
[01:16:24.762 --> 01:16:31.845]  Well, I was watching the True Channel a while ago and there's a thing about September 11th and the way the buildings fell.
[01:16:31.865 --> 01:16:34.786]  You're talking about the French Brothers, of course.
[01:16:35.026 --> 01:16:35.567]  Yes, sir, yes.
[01:16:35.647 --> 01:16:37.207]  And we played that clip.
[01:16:37.227 --> 01:16:39.148]  The firefighters say, did you see the detonators?
[01:16:39.168 --> 01:16:41.469]  Did you see the, you know, it looked like bombs were going off?
[01:16:41.789 --> 01:16:45.931]  Well, this guy was just one of the employees in the building, I think, in Building 2.
[01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:57.317]  And, uh, when the, he said whenever the second plane struck his building, uh, after it quit shaking, after the building quit shaking, uh, he heard, uh, multiple explosions coming from across the street.
[01:16:57.598 --> 01:17:00.079]  Yeah, no, it's full of, uh, witnesses saying bombs.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:00.840]  Yeah.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:06.884]  I've called firefighters up that are in the newspaper saying, you know, they saw the bombs go off and it's Mr. Jones.
[01:17:07.545 --> 01:17:09.086]  Listen, I've been told not to talk.
[01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:10.047]  I love my family.
[01:17:10.087 --> 01:17:10.467]  Goodbye.
[01:17:11.247 --> 01:17:11.448]  Yeah.
[01:17:11.508 --> 01:17:12.028]  I'm not kidding.
[01:17:13.142 --> 01:17:15.644]  That's what Lou Cacioli, he was in People Magazine, told me.
[01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:16.845]  Senior firefighter.
[01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:18.827]  You know, head of a whole fire team.
[01:17:19.207 --> 01:17:21.009]  And he just said, look, I've been told not to talk about it.
[01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:30.797]  Yeah, I just thought it was weird because if you remember Oklahoma City, there was mysteriously, you know, the other explosions and it just seems like they leave their signet everywhere.
[01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:34.319]  Well, and that was another, but look, we have total proof on that.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.541]  That was another government op, you know.
[01:17:37.122 --> 01:17:39.484]  Yeah, I just thought I would pass that along.
[01:17:40.004 --> 01:17:41.145]  I didn't know if you'd seen it or not.
[01:17:42.231 --> 01:17:45.013]  Yeah, there's three different groups in that.
[01:17:45.073 --> 01:17:46.454]  Firefighters and some other witnesses.
[01:17:46.474 --> 01:17:49.116]  We're talking about the French Brothers film, saying bombs going off.
[01:17:49.517 --> 01:17:50.697]  Yeah.
[01:17:50.777 --> 01:17:57.182]  I just also wanted to tell you, I've been using your Road to Charity movie to wake up my girlfriend, and it's working pretty good.
[01:17:57.783 --> 01:17:59.504]  And I just wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work.
[01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:00.990]  Well, thank you.
[01:18:02.693 --> 01:18:03.775]  Look, the new film's out.
[01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:04.977]  It's my best work ever.
[01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:06.900]  And you've absolutely got to get it.

[01:20:00.557 --> 01:20:02.918]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[01:21:51.966 --> 01:21:59.932]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.633]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:02.434]  Now check this out.
[01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:06.237]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:22:06.577 --> 01:22:07.618]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:11.862]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:12.923]  Your health suffers.

[01:23:22.046 --> 01:23:27.888]  In fact, let's go straight back to the calls for our guest here today.
[01:23:28.928 --> 01:23:32.789]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pam in New Mexico.
[01:23:32.889 --> 01:23:33.690]  Pam, you're on the air.
[01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:34.170]  Go ahead.
[01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:35.630]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:36.891]  Take a hot tub for your back.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.260]  I hope you feel better.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.941]  I wasn't whining earlier.
[01:23:41.001 --> 01:23:51.045]  I woke up this morning after a luscious four hours of sleep after I finished the film Martial Law last night at about 4 a.m.
[01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:53.867]  and I feel like somebody's sticking an ice pick in my back.
[01:23:54.047 --> 01:23:54.647]  I know.
[01:23:54.927 --> 01:23:59.169]  I said the same thing and honest to God a hot tub will really help.
[01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:01.831]  Um, but anyway, that's not what I called about.
[01:24:01.871 --> 01:24:10.013]  What I called about is that I've noticed that a new word has come into American parlance and that seems to be the word suicided.
[01:24:10.553 --> 01:24:19.456]  People are being suicided like Hunter Thompson and Gary Webb and my burning question is, is that what
[01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:42.710]  Greg Palast, who you've had on your show, he must know, surely, Greg Palast must know the truth about 9-11 and about the theft of the 2004 election, and he doesn't say a word about it, and what about your fellow Texans, Molly Ivins,
[01:24:44.175 --> 01:24:52.683]  Let's get something clear here.
[01:24:53.243 --> 01:24:54.524]  Bush is nothing but a puppet.
[01:24:54.564 --> 01:24:55.485]  Clinton was a puppet.
[01:24:55.545 --> 01:25:02.732]  It's that the globalist corporate interests, who are not free market, who operate as a global crime syndicate, are getting more and more arrogant.
[01:25:03.505 --> 01:25:13.276]  And, uh, actually, Palace does talk about the election scams, but you can't have an election scam without a scamming, uh, a candidate that, you know, that takes the dive who's a ringer.
[01:25:13.757 --> 01:25:14.978]  And so Kerry was a ringer.
[01:25:15.579 --> 01:25:16.640]  And, uh, look.
[01:25:18.021 --> 01:25:19.662]  I mean, Palace has reported on that.
[01:25:20.022 --> 01:25:25.865]  He doesn't really... I mean, he gets into 9-11 and the prior knowledge and Bush ordering the FBI off of the trail.
[01:25:26.445 --> 01:25:28.026]  But, you know, he works for the BBC.
[01:25:28.046 --> 01:25:29.306]  He can't go all the way.
[01:25:29.806 --> 01:25:34.329]  Now, as for Molly Ivins, I mean, she's... She's really an establishment lib.
[01:25:34.349 --> 01:25:36.169]  You know, she's for this whole system.
[01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:40.311]  I like Hightower, but he doesn't go as far as he should.
[01:25:40.792 --> 01:25:43.753]  Any comments, sir, on that?
[01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:55.151]  You had an article not long ago in the Financial Times in London saying that the electoral boundaries were redrawn to favor the Republicans.
[01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.212]  And that's a prestigious periodical.
[01:25:58.893 --> 01:26:05.996]  Well, we had Michael Meacher, for the Guardian, the number three man in the Blair government, basically said the government carried out 9-11.
[01:26:06.616 --> 01:26:06.917]  Really?
[01:26:07.117 --> 01:26:13.620]  Yeah, well, in his article two years ago, yeah, titled, what is it, The War on Terror is a Fraud.
[01:26:15.413 --> 01:26:18.638]  Well, I mean, you can't wage war against an abstract noun anyway, can you?
[01:26:18.698 --> 01:26:19.660]  How do you know if you've won?
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:20.701]  Well, that's the point.
[01:26:20.761 --> 01:26:24.267]  It's a perfect, foggy, Goldstein, 1984.
[01:26:25.088 --> 01:26:26.951]  Bush has said it's going to be a hundred-year war.
[01:26:27.011 --> 01:26:28.433]  Yeah, no, the war is endless.
[01:26:28.533 --> 01:26:30.136]  It's just like Orwell said.
[01:26:32.114 --> 01:26:33.575]  All right, anything else?
[01:26:33.635 --> 01:26:50.944]  You have this, Ambassador Wilson said, I saw him on some footage of a movie, I've forgotten which movie it was, but Ambassador Wilson, Valerie Plum's, Valerie Plum's husband, he said, these people are patriots, misguided, but patriots all the same.
[01:26:51.024 --> 01:26:52.685]  I don't see how he can say that!
[01:26:53.245 --> 01:26:56.227]  How can they say that Bush et al.
[01:26:56.767 --> 01:26:59.389]  And Wolfowitz and all those guys and Rumsfeld.
[01:26:59.429 --> 01:27:02.591]  Hey, have you heard they're going to try to make Wolfowitz head of the World Bank?
[01:27:03.572 --> 01:27:03.712]  Yes!
[01:27:03.772 --> 01:27:04.833]  Thanks for the call, Pam.
[01:27:05.953 --> 01:27:07.715]  Glenn, where are you calling us from?
[01:27:07.735 --> 01:27:07.775]  Hi.
[01:27:08.255 --> 01:27:09.656]  Where are you calling from?
[01:27:10.076 --> 01:27:10.737]  Toronto, Canada.
[01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:11.337]  Welcome.
[01:27:11.697 --> 01:27:12.018]  How are you?
[01:27:12.558 --> 01:27:13.519]  Good.
[01:27:14.619 --> 01:27:19.123]  I just want to know, I heard that you were a part of the Church of Scientology.
[01:27:19.143 --> 01:27:19.603]  Is that true?
[01:27:20.463 --> 01:27:20.644]  No.
[01:27:22.105 --> 01:27:23.566]  Where did that come from?
[01:27:23.726 --> 01:27:24.046]  I don't know.
[01:27:25.806 --> 01:27:30.089]  I'm not a member of any church or organization.
[01:27:30.509 --> 01:27:39.655]  I've had groups on that have been associated with them who are against the drugging of children, but I've had Ann Coulter on this show.
[01:27:40.996 --> 01:27:42.296]  It doesn't mean I'm with Ann Coulter.
[01:27:43.357 --> 01:27:44.298]  How can we email you?
[01:27:46.519 --> 01:27:48.080]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.341]  Let me write this down.
[01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:50.441]  Sorry?
[01:27:51.202 --> 01:27:52.983]  Tips at Infowars.com, sir.
[01:27:54.154 --> 01:28:00.738]  Yeah, and also there's an Alex Jones who's a New York Times writer and who does NPR shows.
[01:28:01.099 --> 01:28:03.240]  I'm not that Alex Jones.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.703]  There's about 10 Alex Joneses in the media and I'm tired of being confused with them.
[01:28:08.043 --> 01:28:10.704]  I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:28:11.425 --> 01:28:13.226]  Alex E. Jones.
[01:28:14.067 --> 01:28:20.070]  Not to be confused with Alex S. Jones or Alex D. Jones or Alex M. Jones.
[01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:21.091]  Okay, so it's Chip.
[01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:22.767]  T-H-I-P-F?
[01:28:22.807 --> 01:28:23.147]  Tips.
[01:28:23.487 --> 01:28:23.807]  Tips.
[01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:24.908]  News tips.
[01:28:25.828 --> 01:28:27.688]  Tips at Infowars.com, sir.
[01:28:28.148 --> 01:28:28.969]  Thank you very much, eh?

[01:28:31.269 --> 01:28:32.869]  No, it's just, it's irritating.
[01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:36.430]  I mean, I'm... Where this stuff comes from, I have no idea.
[01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:38.050]  Scientology is not just a bad thing.
[01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:42.871]  A friend of mine wrote a study of cults and came to the conclusion that... Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:44.932]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:47.032]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:50.593]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:12.531]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require
[01:30:12.731 --> 01:30:13.691]  Very little energy.
[01:30:13.972 --> 01:30:17.293]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:17.633 --> 01:30:28.097]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.377 --> 01:30:28.877]  That's right!
[01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:36.160]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:05.633]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.873 --> 01:31:12.857]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.277 --> 01:31:19.381]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.521 --> 01:31:20.782]  There are no side effects.

[01:32:01.006 --> 01:32:02.226]  Central Standard Time.
[01:32:02.807 --> 01:32:04.408]  Back from 9 to midnight, Central.
[01:32:05.048 --> 01:32:05.409]  I'm your host.
[01:32:05.429 --> 01:32:08.771]  You're getting a lot of new affiliates across the country on the AM and FM dial.
[01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:15.756]  Of course, during the day and at night, we're also on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:15.776 --> 01:32:18.397]  You can always listen there for free.
[01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:23.421]  And unlike a lot of radio networks and stations that are out there, we still try to do that, even though it's very expensive.
[01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:28.189]  Although the network does have a subscription system for you if you want to listen on the higher bandwidth.
[01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:33.631]  And I of course have PrisonPlanet.TV where you hear all my best interviews archived.
[01:32:34.392 --> 01:32:38.773]  All of my weekly TV reports now for about the last 10 months since we launched.
[01:32:40.614 --> 01:32:42.274]  PrisonPlanet.TV are posted there.
[01:32:42.434 --> 01:32:44.275]  All 12 of my films now.
[01:32:44.775 --> 01:32:46.956]  Dozens of other films have been authorized to post.
[01:32:47.786 --> 01:32:50.367]  My book, Paul Watson's book, those two e-books are there.
[01:32:50.827 --> 01:32:51.928]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:32:52.368 --> 01:32:54.068]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:32:54.128 --> 01:32:58.030]  And my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:59.750]  It is out, my friends.
[01:33:00.271 --> 01:33:02.011]  Two hours, thirty-five minutes.
[01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:03.352]  It's really three films in one.
[01:33:03.832 --> 01:33:09.834]  We cover the RNC, the total police state, the surveillance blimps, being threatened with arrest three times a day.
[01:33:10.896 --> 01:33:12.137]  The sound wave cannons.
[01:33:12.537 --> 01:33:14.479]  So we show you the reality of the police state.
[01:33:14.939 --> 01:33:16.420]  Then we go into the RNC.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.642]  We confront David Gergen about Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:18.662 --> 01:33:19.803]  Get into Skull and Bones.
[01:33:20.883 --> 01:33:23.285]  Show how that's really a Nazi-type death cult.
[01:33:24.646 --> 01:33:28.529]  And show the roots into these just incredible secret societies.
[01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:33.793]  And then from there we expand out into Arnold Schwarzenegger and their plan to put him in the White House.
[01:33:34.874 --> 01:33:36.416]  It's just unlike any film you've seen.
[01:33:36.456 --> 01:33:42.662]  Of course, I kind of skipped over what an hour of the film is, or 59 minutes of the two and a half hour film is 9-11.
[01:33:42.843 --> 01:33:45.846]  I mean, that is a film in and of itself.
[01:33:46.026 --> 01:33:47.728]  It is just the latest info.
[01:33:48.168 --> 01:33:49.209]  So well put together.
[01:33:49.309 --> 01:33:50.290]  So well documented.
[01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.212]  This is a tour de force.
[01:33:52.873 --> 01:33:54.555]  You've got to have this video.
[01:33:55.439 --> 01:34:12.670]  And, uh, we're putting it out on VHS only at first because it takes a couple weeks to author it on DVD, and I gotta send it off to have it authored, then I gotta double-check the copy, make sure it's right, then they have to stamp them, ship them to me, as we're getting them made in, uh, New Jersey, and, uh, then, uh, we ship them out to you.
[01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.292]  So, VHS is getting printed up tomorrow.
[01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:17.823]  And then we'll be shipping them out within a week or so.
[01:34:18.243 --> 01:34:19.784]  So, call toll-free to order.
[01:34:19.924 --> 01:34:21.246]  Operators are standing by.
[01:34:21.266 --> 01:34:22.026]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:22.046 --> 01:34:23.067]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:24.188 --> 01:34:33.276]  And we're doing this with the VHS first because we just gotta get this out now.
[01:34:33.356 --> 01:34:34.597]  It is that important.
[01:34:34.617 --> 01:34:36.118]  It will wake people up that much.
[01:34:36.679 --> 01:34:41.923]  And, you know, they could, the globals could pull a new terrorist attack tomorrow, and this thing will never even get out.
[01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:43.545]  I mean, we're that close.
[01:34:44.165 --> 01:34:46.429]  To a New World Order action, folks.
[01:34:46.469 --> 01:34:48.312]  So, get the VHS copy.
[01:34:48.332 --> 01:34:52.219]  If you want to buy the DVD in a month, you know, for the five minutes of extras I'm going to put on it.
[01:34:52.279 --> 01:34:54.082]  It's already so long I'm not putting many extras on.
[01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:57.127]  Then, you know, give the VHS as a gift.
[01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:01.391]  And to see both purchases as a donation to what we do.
[01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:09.155]  Because the film cost me a lot to make and we need to recoup that so we can make more films.
[01:35:09.175 --> 01:35:16.698]  1-888-253-3139 or order right now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the SafeSecure online shopping cart.
[01:35:16.998 --> 01:35:18.338]  We have clips of the film there as well.
[01:35:19.179 --> 01:35:22.560]  Let's go ahead and go back to our guest.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.241]  Before I continue with
[01:35:26.127 --> 01:35:30.270]  Ron and Ed and everybody else is patiently holding.
[01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:39.876]  Paul Roberts, of course, Paul William Roberts, is the author of A War Against Truth, which you can get via the Internet.
[01:35:39.896 --> 01:35:42.438]  It's not published here in the U.S., though it's award-winning.
[01:35:42.698 --> 01:35:44.679]  Tell us about your book before we take some more calls.
[01:35:45.459 --> 01:35:49.282]  Well, the subtitle is An Intimate Account of the Invasion of Iraq.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:36:08.437]  And it's an eyewitness account of what happened and includes a background history, not just of Sudan, but of the whole area, going back to British Imperial times, so that you can see the context in which this has to be put.
[01:36:08.958 --> 01:36:11.160]  I find the news today lacks all context.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.142]  It's just a blizzard of facts, unconnected.
[01:36:13.877 --> 01:36:15.839]  But this puts it all together.
[01:36:15.859 --> 01:36:20.422]  I've got a DVD, too, of footage I shot there called American Holocaust.
[01:36:21.543 --> 01:36:24.025]  And I'll send you a copy, Alex.
[01:36:24.065 --> 01:36:25.586]  Yeah, well, how do people get a copy of that?
[01:36:26.226 --> 01:36:34.052]  Well, I'm going to send you a box of books, which you can give away or do what you want with, and I'll send you a DVD, and you're welcome to burn copies.
[01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:35.221]  Wow.
[01:36:35.261 --> 01:36:38.143]  You know, that's always a sign of somebody that really cares.
[01:36:38.623 --> 01:36:41.264]  I'm authorizing my listeners to make copies of my films.
[01:36:41.785 --> 01:36:44.506]  I just want to get it out, because we're not going to have a civilization.
[01:36:45.927 --> 01:36:47.088]  That was my next question.
[01:36:48.488 --> 01:36:53.651]  That was my next... Well, first off, tell people about your publisher and how they can still get it here in the U.S.
[01:36:53.771 --> 01:36:56.553]  It's published in Canada by Raincoast Publishing.
[01:36:56.653 --> 01:36:58.294]  Raincoast in Vancouver.
[01:36:59.594 --> 01:37:04.317]  And you can get it on Amazon CA, the Canadian version of Amazon.
[01:37:05.616 --> 01:37:09.560]  Or Indigo, which is an online bookseller, too.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.721]  Okay, a war against truth.
[01:37:11.741 --> 01:37:15.865]  But that was my final question before we go to a blitz of calls here.
[01:37:16.805 --> 01:37:34.119]  If the globalist, this out-of-control crime syndicate just continues, there's $2.4 trillion missing from the Pentagon, CBS News, there's just mass corporate looting, just total criminality, and they're getting away with all of it, and history shows when they start getting away with all of it, they just don't stop
[01:37:35.712 --> 01:37:38.656]  It's just more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[01:37:38.676 --> 01:37:47.386]  It's like the end of the Roman Empire when the Emperor Valentinian III decides to cut down the content of silver in the coins.
[01:37:47.986 --> 01:37:48.587]  Takes it down 6%.
[01:37:49.608 --> 01:37:51.791]  Within a few years, you know, there's only 3% of silver left.
[01:37:54.562 --> 01:38:00.607]  And then he finds out that his taxes are paid in that currency, and so he's really spitting himself.
[01:38:00.707 --> 01:38:06.111]  But, I mean, the parallels with the decline of the Roman Empire are enormous.
[01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:07.952]  Well, they're just going wild!
[01:38:08.033 --> 01:38:11.155]  I mean, when do you think it's going to stop, or will it?
[01:38:11.515 --> 01:38:20.322]  Well, I think it's up to the rest of the world, particularly the European countries, to get together and block it.
[01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:22.464]  But you can see in South America,
[01:38:24.404 --> 01:38:33.227]  In Southeast Asia, these various blocks forming that are excluding America and are deliberately thwarting American patents.
[01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:36.528]  The American economy is in disastrous shape.
[01:38:36.568 --> 01:38:38.168]  The dollar could collapse any day.
[01:38:39.228 --> 01:38:43.550]  That was another one of Saddam's problems, converting into the Euro.
[01:38:43.570 --> 01:38:44.610]  But this is the problem!
[01:38:45.794 --> 01:38:50.117]  If you look at who owns American banks and American corporations, number one, owners are the British.
[01:38:50.437 --> 01:38:57.762]  Then you've got the Germans and the Swiss and the French and the Japanese and the Arabs.
[01:38:57.802 --> 01:39:00.744]  Predominantly, the Saudis, House of Saud.
[01:39:01.485 --> 01:39:05.888]  And so really what I see is America's been captured by the most radical interests of this global system.
[01:39:06.168 --> 01:39:08.210]  They're kind of using us as the bad cop.
[01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:11.232]  And then Europe puts out some rhetoric.
[01:39:11.492 --> 01:39:14.294]  But at many levels, they're really just part of the same thing.
[01:39:15.373 --> 01:39:17.294]  Well, I'm sure they are on certain levels.
[01:39:18.135 --> 01:39:25.738]  You're right, but the emerging economies in Asia, I don't think, are part of that.
[01:39:25.778 --> 01:39:29.781]  They'll probably form their own criminal syndicate given time.
[01:39:29.941 --> 01:39:36.744]  But the fact with the dollar is, being an international currency, half the dollars that exist are held outside of America.
[01:39:36.784 --> 01:39:39.506]  The World Reserve, they talk about the Euro's gone back down.
[01:39:39.786 --> 01:39:42.007]  It's gone back down by like a third of a percent.
[01:39:44.128 --> 01:39:47.011]  The dollar's down 42% from three years ago.
[01:39:47.411 --> 01:39:55.958]  Yeah, well, if OPEC had even gone over to two currencies, the euro and the dollar, the dollar would have fallen 40% overnight.
[01:39:56.258 --> 01:39:58.500]  By the way, I have a Financial Times article.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.702]  They're talking about $3 a gallon gas right now.
[01:40:04.284 --> 01:40:06.586]  Well, the Europeans will say welcome to the club.
[01:40:07.975 --> 01:40:08.736]  Well, how is that?
[01:40:08.776 --> 01:40:13.399]  How do we get fuel at $1.50 and Europe's paying $6?
[01:40:13.499 --> 01:40:16.761]  I'd deal with the Saudis, wouldn't I?
[01:40:16.801 --> 01:40:20.724]  But, I mean, now, of course, America is basically a member of OPEC.
[01:40:22.846 --> 01:40:24.147]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:40:24.207 --> 01:40:28.310]  You know, people... The news keeps saying the economy's great, the economy's great, the economy's great.
[01:40:28.937 --> 01:40:48.307]  I mean, I know hundreds of people who have two, three degrees, who are hard-working, they've all lost their jobs, they say the high-tech job layoffs are going to get seven times greater in the next four years, Congressional Budget Office, houses are for sale everywhere, the average American family spends $1.20 a year for every dollar they make.
[01:40:50.328 --> 01:40:52.168]  America doesn't make anything.
[01:40:52.329 --> 01:40:55.070]  I mean, there's nothing really made there anymore.
[01:40:57.168 --> 01:41:00.089]  And that was the same in the case of the last days of Rome.
[01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:03.310]  All they manufactured was the currency and an army.
[01:41:06.271 --> 01:41:12.693]  But why have the globalists of America's, their military arm, why have the globalists then moved all the industry offshore?
[01:41:12.973 --> 01:41:15.434]  Because it's just a short term thing and make all the money they can?
[01:41:16.944 --> 01:41:18.125]  They're very short term.
[01:41:18.185 --> 01:41:29.233]  I mean, look at Norman Mailer once said of George Bush, the father, that he's no doubt an intelligent man, but he couldn't pass a first year course in philosophy.
[01:41:29.793 --> 01:41:32.515]  They think very, very short term.
[01:41:32.795 --> 01:41:34.076]  Big profits, short term.
[01:41:34.776 --> 01:41:38.019]  Look what they're doing to the ecology.
[01:41:39.039 --> 01:41:39.760]  I call that looting.
[01:41:42.667 --> 01:41:44.509]  It's just a wild looting.
[01:41:44.549 --> 01:41:47.912]  But I'm telling you, there's bigger financial interest about puppets like Bush.
[01:41:48.212 --> 01:41:51.475]  Why are they allowing this mad dog looting?
[01:41:52.876 --> 01:41:55.738]  Because they're enriching themselves in the process.
[01:41:56.679 --> 01:42:01.943]  And a lot of them are fundamentalists who have no reason to stop the Armageddon, do they?
[01:42:03.585 --> 01:42:04.466]  Well, that's another thing.
[01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:08.349]  I'm a Christian, and I see these so-called Christian conservative leaders
[01:42:09.251 --> 01:42:17.178]  And you go, okay, here's five major newspapers that they bushin' gay porn stars at Bohemian Grove to, uh, you know, have orgies with them.
[01:42:17.778 --> 01:42:20.180]  And, uh, they go, oh, of the devil, you're a liar!
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.324]  And I go, no, no, really, uh, Bush is a member of Skull and Bones, it's a Nazi death cult.
[01:42:24.664 --> 01:42:33.512]  Oh, that's ridiculous, you're makin' that up, you know, it just... Well, uh, you know, here's, you know, here's Bush, uh, you know, making fun of somebody he's gonna execute, laughing about it.
[01:42:33.672 --> 01:42:35.033]  Oh, you're a li... I mean, it's just like...
[01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:39.964]  No, I don't recognize these people as Christians at all.
[01:42:40.705 --> 01:42:43.851]  I mean, by their deeds, you know, you shall know them.
[01:42:44.893 --> 01:42:45.253]  It's sick.
[01:42:45.294 --> 01:42:46.195]  Let's take some calls.
[01:42:46.796 --> 01:42:47.918]  Ron in New York City.
[01:42:47.958 --> 01:42:48.520]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:42:49.150 --> 01:42:50.071]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:59.199]  I'm going to digress for one moment from the original purpose of my call and say, Luda's never thinking the long term, quite obviously, and anyone could call himself anything he wants.
[01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:00.280]  That doesn't make it so.
[01:43:00.681 --> 01:43:03.163]  And that goes along with the pseudo or plastic Christianity.
[01:43:03.183 --> 01:43:09.148]  Well, it's like this alleged mass murderer up in Missouri, up in the Kansas area.
[01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:11.030]  You know, he's the good government.
[01:43:12.431 --> 01:43:14.052]  My question is, and particularly to Mr. Roberts,
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:50.646]  Uh, recently, at least in the American press, there's been quite a big issue over the last two or three days about the fact that they found some very rough and minimal sketches.
[01:43:51.787 --> 01:43:54.669]  Uh, I believe in the possession of the Madrid bombers.
[01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:58.752]  And the sketches were of our, uh, Grand Central Terminal in New York.
[01:43:59.653 --> 01:44:04.236]  Uh, why would such... I would almost say irrelevant at this point.
[01:44:05.007 --> 01:44:09.629]  Uh, non-evidence be brought out and highlighted this late, a year after.
[01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:10.690]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:44:10.890 --> 01:44:11.550]  I mean, I'm going to throw this.
[01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:15.892]  We have a giant section on PrisonPlanet.com, fake terror alerts.
[01:44:16.673 --> 01:44:20.494]  I mean, there's like 50 of them where they admittedly, quote, issue them.
[01:44:20.555 --> 01:44:24.777]  Even in a press briefing, Ari Fleischer admitted, this is for political purposes.
[01:44:24.817 --> 01:44:27.458]  They just make it up to create fear.
[01:44:28.578 --> 01:44:29.439]  Comments, Mr. Roberts?
[01:44:30.199 --> 01:44:33.941]  Yeah, look at Colin Powell with his tube of anthrax in the United Nations.
[01:44:35.033 --> 01:44:36.334]  I mean, ridiculous.
[01:44:36.734 --> 01:44:48.960]  We saw from the Tokyo subway incident that it's actually not very easy to kill people with toxic gas, you know, or microbes.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.621]  I mean, they basically have to be injected.
[01:44:52.502 --> 01:44:54.683]  No, it's an ironic use of the term injected.
[01:44:54.723 --> 01:44:58.685]  It seems that every time things are starting to calm down just a little bit, I guess you could liken
[01:44:59.875 --> 01:45:09.541]  The nation now to a patient who's constantly be given injections and then when he wakes up or starts to wake up they give him another injection only in this case the injection is propaganda.
[01:45:10.322 --> 01:45:17.166]  Are people supposed to feel safe because they're told every morning how unsafe they are?
[01:45:17.466 --> 01:45:21.208]  I don't see how some crude sketches can amount to anything really.
[01:45:21.228 --> 01:45:26.592]  Number one it's been proven the Madrid bombing was a government op and it blew up in their face.
[01:45:29.064 --> 01:45:30.626]  And I don't have two hours to go over it.
[01:45:30.686 --> 01:45:32.248]  We've done probably ten shows on it.
[01:45:32.268 --> 01:45:34.771]  So much of what we're seeing in Iraq, I think, is the same.
[01:45:34.991 --> 01:45:41.100]  When you've got somebody like Negroponte in charge there, albeit briefly, it's for a reason.
[01:45:41.961 --> 01:45:46.587]  And, you know, the only thing on his resume is an expert in setting up death squads.
[01:45:47.426 --> 01:45:52.848]  And do you think, in this case, is it just another one of the routine alarms that we've been through now for four years?
[01:45:53.368 --> 01:45:57.149]  Or is this an indication that maybe something more serious is in the works?
[01:45:57.349 --> 01:45:59.510]  Well, you know, it's the boy who cried wolf.
[01:45:59.530 --> 01:46:03.251]  When you cry wolf, you know, often enough, nobody takes any notice after a while.
[01:46:03.591 --> 01:46:04.512]  Is that the intention?
[01:46:05.612 --> 01:46:10.454]  I, you know, with these, there's so many different reasons why they could be doing what they're doing.
[01:46:10.494 --> 01:46:11.614]  I'm sure all the theories.
[01:46:12.014 --> 01:46:14.075]  The question is, are we at that point yet?
[01:46:15.203 --> 01:46:19.487]  I said the danger of terror attack went up exponentially after the election.
[01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:27.815]  And I say before Bush leaves office, you're going to have a mega attack that dwarfs 9-11 unless we expose who's behind 9-11.
[01:46:32.635 --> 01:46:43.444]  The idea of a war to defend democracy is a nice idea, but when you think about what it entails, to fight such a war you need a big army, which requires a central command.
[01:46:43.844 --> 01:46:47.007]  Once you've got all that in place, you don't have a democracy to defend anyway.
[01:46:47.529 --> 01:46:52.713]  Well, and you won't have an economy left for very long, considering the amount of money it takes to finance that.
[01:46:52.733 --> 01:46:53.634]  Well, I don't think you do.
[01:46:54.094 --> 01:46:54.495]  Well, thanks.
[01:46:54.535 --> 01:46:55.475]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[01:46:55.856 --> 01:46:58.958]  And we've got to defend our constitutional republic, but it's been seized.
[01:46:59.559 --> 01:47:00.139]  Look, it's simple.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.580]  I love this country.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.541]  I love our military.
[01:47:02.561 --> 01:47:03.782]  I know most of our police are good.
[01:47:04.122 --> 01:47:09.507]  But the ideology, the program they're being fed, like a computer, is a virus, is a fraud.
[01:47:09.787 --> 01:47:14.772]  You know, it's like if I loved a ship, the ship isn't bad because it's going to run over somebody else's boat.
[01:47:15.173 --> 01:47:18.516]  It's bad that somebody hijacked it and has control of it.
[01:47:18.536 --> 01:47:26.245]  And America's this engine, and it's been hijacked, and now the hijackers are just going crazy.
[01:47:27.005 --> 01:47:30.309]  I mean, they're just foaming at the mouth because they've got these high-tech
[01:47:31.471 --> 01:47:38.133]  Space-age PR firms that are able to neutralize the political process in most people's brains.
[01:47:38.773 --> 01:47:43.235]  And so most people just unplugged and are watching football and baseball and eating hot dogs.
[01:47:43.715 --> 01:47:47.656]  And I mean, Rome is burning, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:47.756 --> 01:47:53.998]  The dumbing down of the country is part of it, but the rest of the world isn't quite so dumbed down yet.
[01:47:54.904 --> 01:48:02.938]  I mean, in Paris or in India, people sit around talking, reading newspapers and are pretty well informed.
[01:48:03.279 --> 01:48:05.924]  They don't buy it when Bush comes.
[01:48:06.742 --> 01:48:10.605]  Or, you know, whoever comes and wants to do a complete about-face.
[01:48:10.845 --> 01:48:23.713]  Well, Alexander de Tocqueville, when he traveled to America at the turn of two centuries ago, said that all Americans did was sit around with newspapers, you know, in their free time, arguing about politics and getting on soap boxes.
[01:48:23.773 --> 01:48:25.775]  We were the most informed, the most involved.
[01:48:26.335 --> 01:48:33.120]  And you look at us now, I mean, the average American literally cannot find Iraq on a map, but they've got their opinion about it.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.201]  No, they don't know the difference between Iraq and Iran.
[01:48:37.107 --> 01:48:40.128]  Everything is almost reversed from when Tocqueville was here.
[01:48:40.148 --> 01:48:46.450]  5% of the population then were working for somebody else.
[01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:48.311]  95% were self-employed.
[01:48:50.612 --> 01:48:53.853]  The level of income was all from earned income.
[01:48:53.893 --> 01:48:55.133]  It wasn't from rentier income.
[01:48:56.673 --> 01:48:57.274]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:57.334 --> 01:48:58.635]  We were the ultimate producers.
[01:48:58.655 --> 01:49:00.036]  That's why we had half the world's wealth.
[01:49:00.336 --> 01:49:01.277]  Now we're losing all that.
[01:49:02.558 --> 01:49:08.062]  And more important, losing probably the greatest idea that human beings have ever come up with.
[01:49:10.264 --> 01:49:10.965]  It's so sad.
[01:49:12.626 --> 01:49:17.590]  We had prosperity and power because despite all our problems, we had the best model.
[01:49:19.175 --> 01:49:20.656]  And then now they've hijacked us.
[01:49:20.756 --> 01:49:22.757]  I mean, it's like a virus.
[01:49:22.797 --> 01:49:31.864]  A virus plugs into a cell, reprograms it, then the cell produces thousands more viruses and then busts open, spilling out more.
[01:49:32.524 --> 01:49:34.045]  And America's already busted open.
[01:49:34.465 --> 01:49:42.571]  And we've disgorged this huge mass of these viruses that are just attacking the entire planet, and people are sick of it.
[01:49:43.634 --> 01:49:49.376]  And yeah, you have a one-party system which is, you know, no basis to preach democracy to others.
[01:49:49.596 --> 01:49:50.837]  We got a break, we'll be right back.
[01:49:53.438 --> 01:49:54.918]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.138 --> 01:49:58.220]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.261]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:06.583]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.883 --> 01:50:10.664]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.605]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.825 --> 01:50:16.069]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:20.854]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:24.057]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.237 --> 01:50:27.101]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:33.728]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.228 --> 01:50:38.029]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:51:10.401 --> 01:51:21.745]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.325 --> 01:51:29.190]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:52:55.830 --> 01:53:01.832]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.432 --> 01:53:05.434]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.194 --> 01:53:16.798]  Alright, we're talking to Paul William Roberts.
[01:53:16.818 --> 01:53:21.180]  We got him on originally because of an article in the Globe and Mail in Canada
[01:53:22.017 --> 01:53:23.238]  He was friends with Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:53:23.258 --> 01:53:24.259]  I've been talking to him a lot.
[01:53:24.299 --> 01:53:31.527]  He's confirmed that Thompson was working on reports about the gay prostitutes and all the rest of it.
[01:53:32.668 --> 01:53:37.372]  The homosexual prostitutes in the White House and all of this he was working on.
[01:53:37.753 --> 01:53:40.796]  Stories about 9-11 and government involvement.
[01:53:41.684 --> 01:53:44.185]  And that he was worried about the government, so that's interesting.
[01:53:45.025 --> 01:53:50.707]  And now we've gotten off into his book, A War Against Truth, and I'm really enjoying this discussion.
[01:53:51.588 --> 01:53:55.569]  I hope everybody will visit prisonplanet.tv, get your membership today.
[01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:56.870]  It's going up tonight, the film.
[01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:59.451]  My newest film, Martial Law.
[01:53:59.471 --> 01:54:00.471]  I hope you'll go see it.
[01:54:00.951 --> 01:54:01.952]  It's my best work.
[01:54:01.992 --> 01:54:02.652]  I'm very proud of it.
[01:54:03.953 --> 01:54:05.093]  I'm not going to sit here and hype it.
[01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:07.908]  It's an amazing documentary.
[01:54:08.588 --> 01:54:09.889]  I really just want to share it with you.
[01:54:09.969 --> 01:54:13.071]  You can also now order a hard copy of it.
[01:54:13.612 --> 01:54:17.915]  We're going to go to Ed, Thomas, Randy, Jeremy, others.
[01:54:18.315 --> 01:54:20.277]  Let's go to Mike in Arizona first.
[01:54:20.677 --> 01:54:22.098]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:54:22.138 --> 01:54:22.438]  Welcome.
[01:54:23.779 --> 01:54:24.280]  Yes, hi.
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:24.800]  Good afternoon.
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:25.340]  Hello.
[01:54:26.121 --> 01:54:28.923]  I was just wondering, and condolences by the way.
[01:54:28.943 --> 01:54:32.546]  I don't know how close you are, Mr. Roberts, to Hunter Thompson.
[01:54:33.789 --> 01:54:34.830]  I'm sure you're feeling some loss.
[01:54:35.551 --> 01:54:42.237]  I was wondering who has access at this point to Mr. Thompson's records?
[01:54:42.277 --> 01:54:44.079]  The family, the son in particular.
[01:54:50.657 --> 01:54:59.339]  It just seems a shame that his work that he was doing recently here might be lost and I just wonder if they might avail themselves of your services to
[01:55:20.316 --> 01:55:20.917]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:55:39.105 --> 01:55:44.850]  In Harvard, I was then invited to Denver to give a talk at a peace rally.
[01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:48.453]  This is the December before the war in 2002.
[01:55:49.034 --> 01:56:01.224]  And as I went to leave the airport here, and the odd thing about Toronto Airport is that the American customs and immigration is actually in the airport.
[01:56:01.324 --> 01:56:04.507]  So you can get turned out of America without even entering it.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:05.860]  I don't
[01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.755]  They're at the bridge.
[01:56:29.815 --> 01:56:30.615]  They're waiting for me.
[01:56:31.315 --> 01:56:32.556]  And it's really simple.
[01:56:32.796 --> 01:56:36.918]  I mean, we've had, like, what, five members of Congress who aren't allowed to fly now.
[01:56:37.638 --> 01:56:38.758]  I mean, it's serious.
[01:56:38.999 --> 01:56:39.359]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:39.719 --> 01:56:39.919]  Yeah.
[01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:42.260]  Boy, Mike, that sounds like the new freedom, doesn't it?
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.961]  Much more freedom like that, and we'll all be in chains.
[01:56:46.282 --> 01:56:49.043]  Well, I mean, the Constitution has been suspended.
[01:56:49.083 --> 01:56:51.864]  Well, we've got to leave the border open, though.
[01:56:51.884 --> 01:56:52.984]  Can't have security there.
[01:56:53.785 --> 01:56:55.545]  On the southern border, though.
[01:56:55.886 --> 01:56:56.706]  That might offend someone.
[01:56:58.248 --> 01:57:00.329]  Well, that would be bad for someone's business, probably.
[01:57:29.228 --> 01:57:33.411]  Also known as the Patriot Act, and we have new freedom, and all these are Orwellian terms.
[01:57:33.471 --> 01:57:37.853]  I want to hear a little bit about what it was like getting on the no-fly list.
[01:57:38.473 --> 01:57:39.534]  Just an amazing guest.
[01:57:39.554 --> 01:57:40.234]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:40.254 --> 01:57:42.236]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:43.936]  Hello!
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.360]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.121]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.801 --> 01:57:53.962]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.542 --> 01:57:55.403]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.143 --> 01:57:56.844]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.697 --> 01:58:01.659]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.879 --> 01:58:05.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.143 --> 01:58:22.227]  Already into the third and final hour of this Thursday, the third day of March 2005 edition.
[01:58:24.947 --> 01:58:35.231]  I've really been enjoying our discussion with Paul William Roberts, a respected award-winning journalist and of course author of the new book, A War Against Truth.
[01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:44.034]  And we first got him on to talk about his friend Hunter S. Thompson, who told him he was worried about the government and government conspiracies and coming to get him basically over 9-11.
[01:58:47.077 --> 01:58:52.463]  September 11th, and possible government involvement in bringing the towers down.
[01:58:52.723 --> 01:58:59.650]  He was also admittedly working on stories about the coal boys, underage, you name it, in the White House.
[01:59:00.331 --> 01:59:04.135]  Going back over decades, it's all part of the Christian conservativeness of it all.
[01:59:05.141 --> 01:59:07.802]  Uh, that, uh, we're all supposed to just go along with, I guess.
[01:59:08.142 --> 01:59:09.123]  And we're taking your calls.
[01:59:09.163 --> 01:59:10.583]  In fact, let's just go right back to the calls.
[01:59:10.603 --> 01:59:13.505]  We're bringing up so many different news items, uh, from the listeners.
[01:59:14.125 --> 01:59:16.346]  Uh, let's, uh, talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:16.826 --> 01:59:17.667]  Ed, welcome, sir.
[01:59:17.707 --> 01:59:18.287]  Thanks for holding.
[01:59:18.687 --> 01:59:19.747]  Uh, hello, Paul and Alex.
[01:59:20.208 --> 01:59:20.468]  Hello.
[01:59:20.828 --> 01:59:26.270]  Uh, I'm doing some research on running, uh, diesel motors on, uh, used vegetable oil.
[01:59:27.231 --> 01:59:30.312]  And I was, uh, reading about Rudolph Diesel, who invented the diesel motor.
[01:59:31.232 --> 01:59:40.438]  He made a deal with the, he's German, he made a deal with the English, and was crossing a channel on a ferry, and two German agents tossed him into the English channel there.
[01:59:41.199 --> 01:59:43.621]  Of course it came up in the paper that he committed suicide.
[01:59:44.761 --> 01:59:54.248]  And, uh... Well, yeah, because diesel was gonna threaten all the new processes, uh, for, uh, what we call, you know, the modern petrol, or, uh, or the non-diesel fuels.
[01:59:55.009 --> 01:59:55.709]  And, uh, yeah.
[01:59:56.049 --> 01:59:59.752]  He had a motor that could run on, on, uh, coal dust and water.
[02:00:00.735 --> 02:00:02.535]  In 1908 or something like that.
[02:00:02.996 --> 02:00:08.897]  Well, I mean, they've now got the solar panels that are five times better than anything, and we'll see if those get implemented.
[02:00:08.917 --> 02:00:15.038]  I mean, we're talking about a solar car that has small panels on it, and it'll go, you know, over 100 miles an hour.
[02:00:15.318 --> 02:00:17.959]  The nanotechnology, that was awesome yesterday, Alex.
[02:00:17.979 --> 02:00:18.499]  That was awesome.
[02:00:18.879 --> 02:00:19.759]  Yeah.
[02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:22.900]  But just, you know, just another suicide story coming up.
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:29.081]  You know, his family said there was no way it was suicide, and, you know, everything was going great, and he, you know,
[02:00:30.626 --> 02:00:31.767]  It's very suspicious.
[02:00:32.247 --> 02:00:46.339]  This business of vast powers ruining individuals goes back to as far back as Reich and his microscope and Bill and Reich for that matter.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:52.064]  Well yeah, there's been just thousands of technological developments that have been shelved
[02:00:52.722 --> 02:00:54.243]  Because they threaten the existing order.
[02:00:54.283 --> 02:00:57.665]  I love that final scene in Indiana Jones, where there's the lost ark.
[02:00:57.705 --> 02:00:58.686]  And it's an analogy, folks.
[02:00:58.726 --> 02:00:59.546]  I'm not saying it's real.
[02:00:59.907 --> 02:01:07.031]  Where they roll the ark into that warehouse, and it's just an endless warehouse of boxes of all the hidden things.
[02:01:07.071 --> 02:01:07.311]  Yeah.
[02:01:09.373 --> 02:01:09.933]  It's amazing.
[02:01:09.973 --> 02:01:12.715]  Thank you for the call there.
[02:01:13.215 --> 02:01:16.417]  Let's talk now to Thomas in Colorado.
[02:01:16.837 --> 02:01:17.438]  Welcome, Thomas.
[02:01:18.418 --> 02:01:19.419]  Hi, nice to talk to you.
[02:01:20.079 --> 02:01:20.680]  Good to hear from you.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:21.240]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:21.943 --> 02:01:47.575]  I never met Mr. Dr. Thompson myself but we had a mutual friend and I'm still friends with this guy but I and through this mutual friend I passed on to him about a year ago some of your videos so Dr. Thompson watched your videos I know this for a fact and through my friend I heard that you know he was he was impressed and he said something to the effect that
[02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:49.762]  Yes, that's the way it is.
[02:01:50.023 --> 02:01:50.904]  Or something like that.
[02:01:50.984 --> 02:01:52.325]  Or yes, this is how things are.
[02:01:53.486 --> 02:01:54.267]  Well, I didn't know that.
[02:01:54.307 --> 02:02:02.436]  I mean, I know that I've had a lot of Hollywood people and other folks, generals, call me up, you know, one in the morning after they've seen the videos.
[02:02:03.017 --> 02:02:04.218]  And that's an interesting story.
[02:02:04.238 --> 02:02:05.319]  I know Michael Moore.
[02:02:05.379 --> 02:02:08.102]  I know the people that delivered it into his hand, Rotterdam.
[02:02:09.247 --> 02:02:13.449]  And of course I made the first film about 9-11, and I've made several since.
[02:02:13.469 --> 02:02:15.950]  The new one, my best work, was just released today.
[02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:19.531]  But I hope that people will share this as well.
[02:02:20.431 --> 02:02:23.392]  Yeah, well, it contributed to his research.
[02:02:23.492 --> 02:02:25.933]  I'm sure it turned him on, you know.
[02:02:27.114 --> 02:02:31.515]  So your friend, you know, handed them to him and Hunter watched them.
[02:02:32.056 --> 02:02:33.136]  Yes, I know that for a fact.
[02:02:34.147 --> 02:02:35.467]  Well, tell me more about this when we get back.
[02:02:35.507 --> 02:02:41.868]  We'll go to more callers and get the response from our guest, Mr. Thompson's good friend, Paul William Roberts.
[02:02:41.908 --> 02:02:42.389]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.249 --> 02:02:49.590]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:54.211]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.351 --> 02:02:58.732]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.752 --> 02:03:00.092]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.872 --> 02:03:01.872]  Panama.
[02:03:01.912 --> 02:03:06.113]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.193 --> 02:03:13.114]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.234 --> 02:03:15.315]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.475 --> 02:03:25.977]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:25.997 --> 02:03:26.757]  If you want to
[02:03:27.057 --> 02:03:27.657]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:27.717 --> 02:03:29.038]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:03:44.933 --> 02:03:55.661]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:55.821 --> 02:04:03.427]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.667 --> 02:04:06.809]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:12.831]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:13.111 --> 02:04:19.273]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:04:19.613 --> 02:04:23.514]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:04:23.554 --> 02:04:25.435]  The water level is always visible.
[02:04:25.615 --> 02:04:31.597]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:31.817 --> 02:04:35.759]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:05:45.968 --> 02:05:51.571]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.772 --> 02:06:06.360]  Alright, again, just a recap for all of those that have just joined us in the last few minutes.
[02:06:08.401 --> 02:06:10.963]  The last, what, hour and a half we've had
[02:06:11.866 --> 02:06:16.589]  Paul William Roberts, who is a respected journalist and also author of A War Against Truth.
[02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.650]  He was friends with Hunter S. Thompson.
[02:06:20.431 --> 02:06:27.976]  And, of course, even he himself is banned from flying into the United States now just because he gave a speech at Harvard that the globalists didn't like.
[02:06:28.016 --> 02:06:31.598]  And they admit that you give a speech they don't like against their policies.
[02:06:31.659 --> 02:06:34.160]  There are over 350,000 people on the no-fly list.
[02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:40.224]  A lot of times it's somebody who's got a name like, you know, David Jones or, you know, John Thompson.
[02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:42.851]  Those common names.
[02:06:43.932 --> 02:06:46.474]  It's now five members of Congress that aren't allowed to fly.
[02:06:47.254 --> 02:06:51.858]  And then over and over again they go to Homeland Security, get their name off the list, but then it goes right back on the list.
[02:06:51.878 --> 02:06:53.039]  You know, Ted Kennedy.
[02:06:55.061 --> 02:06:57.483]  And now they're going to have this for the driver's license itself.
[02:06:57.503 --> 02:06:59.224]  They're going to have this at the state level.
[02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:02.847]  I want to talk about that after we finish up with some of these calls with our guests.
[02:07:02.887 --> 02:07:09.132]  But we're talking to Thomas in Colorado, and he said that he gave his friends, in one of my videos, and his friend was friends with Thompson,
[02:07:10.004 --> 02:07:33.390]  Hunter S. Thompson, and that he did see Road to Tyranny, and now again, his friend who we have on the line with us now, Mr. Roberts, who wrote this article for the Globe and Mail, says that he was aware of 9-11, thought there was evidence of bombs in the towers, and was going to be writing about that, and of course he's now died under some questionable circumstances, but anything else you'd like to add, Thomas?
[02:07:34.330 --> 02:07:39.291]  Well, I was just wondering, I've always wanted to ask you this, but I also mailed you something over a year ago, it was like
[02:07:39.753 --> 02:07:48.961]  It was a commercial from TV that I taped, and I sent it to you, and it was like animated for one of these Xbox kind of games, you know?
[02:07:50.422 --> 02:07:59.830]  It had the song, My Country Tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty, and then it showed these black ski masks, snipers going around killing people.
[02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:00.430]  Did you ever see it?
[02:08:00.450 --> 02:08:03.753]  Yeah, I did get that, and thank you, and this is the new good, guys!
[02:08:03.833 --> 02:08:05.034]  This is freedom!
[02:08:06.847 --> 02:08:11.190]  In horrible dictatorships, they were wearing masks hundreds of years ago.
[02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:14.813]  When your police start wearing masks, folks, you're in deep trouble.
[02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:18.316]  In fact, let me... All the tell-tale signs, the nomenclature...
[02:08:19.264 --> 02:08:27.753]  The vocabulary of classical dark oppression is now being picked up with a high-tech overlay.
[02:08:27.773 --> 02:08:31.758]  Do you have any examples of that you'd like to elaborate on, Mr. Roberts?
[02:08:32.719 --> 02:08:39.086]  Well, I mean, I know that the organizations like the police have heavy membership in secret societies themselves.
[02:08:40.819 --> 02:08:54.788]  There seems a kind of wooing by the top of the status quo, the middle of the status quo, the people in charge of law and order and justice and so on.
[02:08:54.808 --> 02:08:59.291]  And once you control the courts, you basically control the truth.
[02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:02.373]  And it gets back to Orwell.
[02:09:02.433 --> 02:09:03.234]  War is peace.
[02:09:03.534 --> 02:09:04.494]  Slavery is freedom.
[02:09:06.175 --> 02:09:27.271]  I mean, in my book I've got accounts of Prince Rashid, the nephew of King Hussein, told me that he had intelligence reports from Iraq that the Americans had set off some kind of nuclear device in the underground bunkers of Saddam Hussein, where the army had been lured.
[02:09:27.511 --> 02:09:35.658]  And it's still not been clear what happened to at least 50,000 members of the elite Republican Guard.
[02:09:36.278 --> 02:09:36.499]  No, I think
[02:09:53.112 --> 02:09:58.439]  That suggestion remains open until somebody's been down there and confirmed that nothing happened.
[02:09:58.459 --> 02:10:03.025]  Well, they told us that they're going to quote start using bunker-busting mini-nukes.
[02:10:03.846 --> 02:10:05.588]  Well, yeah, that's right.
[02:10:06.429 --> 02:10:09.653]  This was a deal they'd done with one of Saddam's generals.
[02:10:11.024 --> 02:10:16.769]  Who ordered, the only person other than Saddam, who could order that particular elite force.
[02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:25.096]  And they were sent to the bunker that is near the airport, which was off bounds to journalists for a very long time, an unusually long time.
[02:10:26.697 --> 02:10:33.963]  And once down there, once they were sure they were there, something was set off that basically vaporized them.
[02:10:34.684 --> 02:10:37.186]  And you notice a number of generals went asked,
[02:10:37.771 --> 02:10:39.513]  What had happened to the army?
[02:10:39.553 --> 02:10:41.214]  A number of them all said the same thing.
[02:10:41.254 --> 02:10:44.337]  They vanished into thin air, which would have been literally true.
[02:10:44.898 --> 02:10:49.342]  But I mean, other things I detail in there, which are thoroughly obnoxious.
[02:10:50.222 --> 02:10:53.625]  The use of cluster bombs, where the bomblets look like children's toys.
[02:10:55.167 --> 02:11:01.172]  The Japanese journalist found a couple and thought they were toys and was taking them home for his kids.
[02:11:01.392 --> 02:11:03.134]  One of them blew up in Oman airport.
[02:11:05.031 --> 02:11:06.292]  You're joking!
[02:11:06.312 --> 02:11:07.693]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:11:07.713 --> 02:11:09.775]  There are cluster bombs that look like toys.
[02:11:10.115 --> 02:11:12.157]  The bomblets look like children's toys.
[02:11:12.217 --> 02:11:14.058]  They look like spinning tops, things like that.
[02:11:14.899 --> 02:11:17.842]  In Afghanistan, they look like food parcels.
[02:11:21.285 --> 02:11:22.425]  I saw that confirmed.
[02:11:22.526 --> 02:11:23.747]  What's going on here?
[02:11:24.587 --> 02:11:28.831]  Well, I mean, this is the sort of thing that the Pentagon is not going to want to admit.
[02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:30.215]  You can be sure.
[02:11:30.756 --> 02:11:36.283]  But just as they were using napalm over there, except now it's high-tech napalm.
[02:11:36.303 --> 02:11:37.264]  They call it something else.
[02:11:37.945 --> 02:11:44.053]  But somebody got that out of a general of the Pentagon who said, oh, you'll never get the generals to give that up.
[02:11:44.093 --> 02:11:44.914]  They love napalm.
[02:11:47.546 --> 02:11:55.008]  Well, it's just, you know, when they asked the Secretary of State Albright, 700,000 children have died in Iraq under sanctions.
[02:11:55.408 --> 02:11:56.369]  Is that a good price to pay?
[02:11:56.429 --> 02:11:57.389]  And she said, yeah, it is.
[02:11:57.429 --> 02:11:58.009]  That's right.
[02:11:58.089 --> 02:12:02.110]  Yeah, that was circulating with a picture of her looking like a dragon.
[02:12:02.471 --> 02:12:03.651]  Not that that was hard to do.
[02:12:05.351 --> 02:12:12.253]  No, I mean, this kind of thing is... There's a million unexploded cluster bomblets all over the place.
[02:12:12.353 --> 02:12:14.594]  Every day a child gets his legs blown off.
[02:12:16.175 --> 02:12:16.695]  Excuse me, hello?
[02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:18.631]  Uh, yes caller.
[02:12:19.171 --> 02:12:19.711]  Uh, excuse me.
[02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:21.893]  Uh, one more little thing just to throw in.
[02:12:22.133 --> 02:12:24.615]  Uh, the previous caller was mentioning something about Mr. Diesel.
[02:12:25.816 --> 02:12:31.740]  Um, this is a website, uh, uh, Geet, G-E-E-T dot com.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.822]  It's about how cars can run on water.
[02:12:34.625 --> 02:12:38.848]  And, uh, you know, if people can look into that, we don't need to have all these wars in the first place.
[02:12:39.028 --> 02:12:40.529]  And who is this we're speaking to right now?
[02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:42.731]  This is Thomas, Bill, in Colorado.
[02:12:42.911 --> 02:12:43.211]  Okay.
[02:12:43.511 --> 02:12:45.433]  Well, Thomas, listen, I really appreciate your call.
[02:12:45.453 --> 02:12:45.913]  Take care.
[02:12:46.654 --> 02:12:47.534]  We'd forgotten about you.
[02:12:47.574 --> 02:12:48.295]  I apologize.
[02:12:48.915 --> 02:12:50.517]  Uh, let's talk to Randy in Florida.
[02:12:50.557 --> 02:12:51.537]  Randy, you're on the air.
[02:12:51.597 --> 02:12:51.938]  Welcome.
[02:12:53.058 --> 02:12:56.461]  Yeah, well, I'm kind of off topic, but I wanted to address Terry Shabo.
[02:12:57.181 --> 02:12:58.542]  Oh, no, that's never off topic.
[02:12:59.063 --> 02:12:59.443]  Okay.
[02:12:59.503 --> 02:13:00.804]  Well, I'm just, you know,
[02:13:01.641 --> 02:13:05.205]  I'm speaking mostly to those people that might be listening down in Pinellas County.
[02:13:06.346 --> 02:13:12.492]  If the government down there won't stand up and protect her, if ever a case calls for civil disobedience, this does.
[02:13:12.972 --> 02:13:16.055]  What happened to those folks at the nursing home that she's in?
[02:13:16.476 --> 02:13:18.177]  You know, don't they have a Hippocratic Oath?
[02:13:18.698 --> 02:13:19.879]  Not the Hippocratic Oath?
[02:13:19.899 --> 02:13:21.901]  Well, they don't give the Hippocratic Oath anymore.
[02:13:22.462 --> 02:13:22.702]  You know?
[02:13:23.182 --> 02:13:25.685]  I mean, did you know for ten years they don't give that oath anymore?
[02:13:26.638 --> 02:13:38.385]  Well, I wasn't aware of that, but those people that work down there, you know, regardless of what they're doing, if I was working down there, I would just tell that judge, well, you can site me for content, but I'm not going to kill that woman, you know, for you or anybody else.
[02:13:38.985 --> 02:13:43.068]  You know, there's a higher authority that we all answer to, and it, you know,
[02:13:43.584 --> 02:13:44.805]  People need to take that into account.
[02:13:44.845 --> 02:13:46.906]  And understand, it's not taking her off a respirator.
[02:13:46.946 --> 02:13:47.966]  She's not brain dead.
[02:13:48.647 --> 02:13:51.628]  And there's a lot of foul play in the background of it.
[02:13:51.728 --> 02:13:53.509]  It's really a horrible story.
[02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:56.711]  And I checked into it last night.
[02:13:57.311 --> 02:13:58.952]  How is she doing right now?
[02:14:00.453 --> 02:14:04.915]  Well, I mean, you know, she's just under a death sentence and waiting for that too to be pulled.
[02:14:04.935 --> 02:14:10.178]  So, I mean, that woman is fighting for her life and the rest of us need to get into the... Well, they pulled her feeding tube before.
[02:14:10.896 --> 02:14:15.137]  Of course, they won't let him brush her teeth, they won't let him, when she gets an infection, give her any treatment.
[02:14:15.157 --> 02:14:17.138]  I mean, you can't treat an animal like that.
[02:14:17.598 --> 02:14:23.539]  Well, under the Florida statutes for abuse, you know, withholding food and water is a crime.
[02:14:24.259 --> 02:14:31.301]  And what Governor Bush should do, and the Sheriff down there, is say, OK, Judge, if you kill this woman, we're going to arrest you and charge you with murder.
[02:14:31.341 --> 02:14:33.302]  Yeah, there is too much judicial tyranny.
[02:14:33.342 --> 02:14:34.062]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:35.042 --> 02:14:38.403]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Florida.
[02:14:38.443 --> 02:14:39.163]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[02:14:40.329 --> 02:14:41.290]  Jeremy, just hung up.
[02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:42.050]  They're good at that.
[02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:43.971]  William in Oregon, go ahead.
[02:14:45.251 --> 02:14:45.471]  Alex.
[02:14:45.752 --> 02:14:46.072]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:46.832 --> 02:14:47.332]  Good day.
[02:14:47.592 --> 02:14:48.673]  Thanks again for all your good work.
[02:14:48.693 --> 02:14:49.073]  Thank you.
[02:14:49.093 --> 02:14:50.654]  A couple quick things off topic here.
[02:14:50.714 --> 02:14:56.336]  I was listening to it every night, but once while I catch up on the Fox News, they start talking about Toll Road.
[02:14:56.896 --> 02:14:58.317]  They had Hannity and Combs up there.
[02:14:58.377 --> 02:15:00.298]  They tell us they were conservative and good.
[02:15:00.318 --> 02:15:02.039]  They were, no.
[02:15:02.619 --> 02:15:03.479]  They were condemning.
[02:15:03.559 --> 02:15:04.280]  It was amazing.
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:05.660]  I thought I was listening to you.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.701]  I thought of my stock.
[02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:13.458]  They were basically kind of advocating on the side of where you and I would come from, which is, what are you guys doing?
[02:15:13.478 --> 02:15:15.221]  And they're blaming it on liberals.
[02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:16.242]  So I found it very funny.
[02:15:16.262 --> 02:15:17.664]  And evidently they had a guest on there.
[02:15:17.705 --> 02:15:18.606]  His name escapes me.
[02:15:18.706 --> 02:15:19.307]  I knew it.
[02:15:19.487 --> 02:15:19.848]  I knew it.
[02:15:20.208 --> 02:15:23.273]  By the way, let me tell you who's putting the toll roads in.
[02:15:23.934 --> 02:15:33.339]  Governor Rick Perry of Texas, Arnold A. Lowe Schwarzenegger of California, and the Governor of New York's trying it.
[02:15:33.999 --> 02:15:34.460]  What's he?
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:35.540]  What's Pataki?
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:36.201]  An Easter Bunny?
[02:15:36.221 --> 02:15:38.322]  No, he's a Republican.
[02:15:38.542 --> 02:15:41.283]  I'm not a Democrat here, I'm just sick of it!
[02:15:41.603 --> 02:15:43.184]  This is fake conservatism.
[02:15:43.805 --> 02:15:47.747]  This is what used to annoy Hunter Thompson to no end.
[02:15:47.967 --> 02:15:52.129]  He was a great believer that government should just be small and stay out of the way.
[02:15:53.084 --> 02:15:56.605]  And accuse these people of being fake conservatives.
[02:15:57.606 --> 02:16:01.247]  Well, I found it really ironic that they're sitting there and blaming it on the liberals.
[02:16:01.307 --> 02:16:06.568]  But the interesting thing was, in the end, that Combs guy said, Well, I'm sure we'll all hear a lot about this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:16:06.588 --> 02:16:07.629]  You know, going on and on and on.
[02:16:07.689 --> 02:16:08.589]  We're not going to allow this.
[02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:13.050]  And it was just really curious how they, you know, it was just interesting to see the slant they put on it.
[02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:14.531]  They're blaming it on the liberals.
[02:16:14.591 --> 02:16:16.872]  And by the way, it's going in all over the country.
[02:16:16.892 --> 02:16:17.652]  I know.
[02:16:18.092 --> 02:16:20.753]  And 90 plus percent in Austin are against it.
[02:16:21.654 --> 02:16:23.876]  And the mayor just says, hey, shut up.
[02:16:23.936 --> 02:16:25.257]  We're doing it.
[02:16:25.617 --> 02:16:28.259]  And the governor is going to take every major state road, folks.
[02:16:28.279 --> 02:16:30.080]  You're going to have a transponder in your car.
[02:16:31.001 --> 02:16:32.762]  Two grand to drive on the state roads.
[02:16:32.882 --> 02:16:34.683]  Eighteen hundred to drive on Austin's roads.
[02:16:35.103 --> 02:16:38.466]  Folks, I mean, most people I know cannot afford thousands of dollars.
[02:16:39.607 --> 02:16:41.748]  They already don't even have insurance for their children.
[02:16:42.028 --> 02:16:42.809]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:43.369 --> 02:16:47.312]  The libertarian gentleman, again, he's from Oregon and he's an advocate for this.
[02:16:47.918 --> 02:16:53.321]  And he was basically saying, well don't worry about it, they're not going to be able to, they're just going to know how many miles you drive, they won't know where you are.
[02:16:53.341 --> 02:16:55.502]  Oh yeah, that's a fraud too.
[02:16:55.762 --> 02:17:00.585]  See, now it's libertarian to pay for the roads this way.
[02:17:00.945 --> 02:17:09.990]  It's private companies pay off the government to let them come in and take over your roads and it is going to increase the price day one when it starts
[02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:14.534]  Five times the taxes that we have as a national average.
[02:17:14.874 --> 02:17:19.618]  I like saying people should invest their own money for their old age pension.
[02:17:20.659 --> 02:17:22.681]  One other thing, Alex, I want to thank you very much.
[02:17:22.841 --> 02:17:25.484]  I sent you the link a while back, or somebody else might have as well.
[02:17:25.924 --> 02:17:28.206]  Cliff Carnicum, CVD for the M-Trail.
[02:17:28.346 --> 02:17:28.826]  Wonderful.
[02:17:28.887 --> 02:17:32.490]  As a matter of fact, I ordered five copies from a gal that's working with him, and I'm giving them away to people.
[02:17:32.550 --> 02:17:33.310]  Just incredible.
[02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:33.831]  As I speak,
[02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:36.813]  I'm getting sprayed in the Oregon coast today, once again.
[02:17:36.833 --> 02:17:37.915]  It's all part of freedom.
[02:17:38.335 --> 02:17:41.921]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our amazing guest, Mr. Roberts.
[02:17:42.642 --> 02:17:44.204]  And I'm Alejandro Jones.
[02:17:45.678 --> 02:17:48.021]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:48.281 --> 02:17:52.125]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:17:52.446 --> 02:17:53.266]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.687 --> 02:17:57.831]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:58.052 --> 02:18:02.236]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.617 --> 02:18:07.482]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:07.862 --> 02:18:11.423]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.623 --> 02:18:16.965]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:17.245 --> 02:18:19.966]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:20.266 --> 02:18:21.166]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:18:47.324 --> 02:18:51.925]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.246 --> 02:18:54.586]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:19:46.525 --> 02:19:47.567]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:19:47.887 --> 02:19:50.691]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:50.952 --> 02:19:55.118]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:55.538 --> 02:19:56.359]  So what do you do?
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:01.267]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:01.727 --> 02:20:03.868]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:48.436]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:20:48.736 --> 02:20:49.877]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:20:49.957 --> 02:20:54.983]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:20:55.003 --> 02:20:58.567]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:20:58.627 --> 02:21:00.590]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:01.651]  Cardivite.

[02:21:33.916 --> 02:21:36.098]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:36.359 --> 02:21:38.761]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:04.396 --> 02:22:06.457]  A criminal society is in control.
[02:22:06.477 --> 02:22:13.459]  They have high-tech space-age pitchmen and advertising firms running the nation.
[02:22:13.959 --> 02:22:21.361]  You can buy the fraud and feel like you're part of the power structure, or you can defend this country and this world from the New World Order.
[02:22:22.281 --> 02:22:25.102]  Talking to Paul William Roberts before we take some more calls.
[02:22:25.502 --> 02:22:30.924]  Paul, I mean, that phenomenon, so many people, whether they follow a corrupt Democratic regime or Republican regime,
[02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:45.223]  They won't listen to you about corruption because they associate their personal power with that power structure like they're part of it or something, when that system will squash them like a cockroach.
[02:22:46.924 --> 02:22:53.768]  Yeah, I mean I think everybody who gets involved in a system like that imagines that it's behind them instead of on top of them.
[02:22:55.949 --> 02:22:57.670]  So how do you get through to one of those people?
[02:23:00.425 --> 02:23:04.168]  Well, I mean, it comes down to, I mean, people are easily bored.
[02:23:04.188 --> 02:23:04.688]  We know that.
[02:23:05.269 --> 02:23:08.491]  It doesn't take that much to win somebody over.
[02:23:08.511 --> 02:23:14.716]  A little money, quite a little money compared to the kind of money that's being raked in.
[02:23:15.397 --> 02:23:19.660]  I noticed that the Iraqi oil production was up to three million barrels a day.
[02:23:20.921 --> 02:23:23.783]  Forty bucks a barrel, that's quite a lot of money coming in.
[02:23:23.823 --> 02:23:24.544]  Where's that going?
[02:23:24.644 --> 02:23:27.346]  And by the way, they admit that goes to the Federal Reserve.
[02:23:27.726 --> 02:23:29.988]  Who set the Federal Reserve up to get that money?
[02:23:31.065 --> 02:23:31.786]  Well, exactly.
[02:23:32.907 --> 02:23:34.929]  And all the deals have been done.
[02:23:35.689 --> 02:23:40.554]  Halliburton got in there and was able to survey the vast areas that have never been surveyed.
[02:23:40.874 --> 02:23:42.355]  They know exactly where the oil is.
[02:23:42.375 --> 02:23:45.058]  There's more oil in Iraq than there is in Saudi Arabia.
[02:23:45.678 --> 02:23:48.201]  It's cheaper to get out of the ground because it's under high pressure.
[02:23:48.241 --> 02:23:49.181]  It pumps itself out.
[02:23:49.221 --> 02:23:51.163]  You save $5 a barrel right there.
[02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:54.326]  Unbelievable.
[02:23:56.435 --> 02:24:05.903]  It's just, and Dick Cheney said in the PNAC document, he said, Saddam isn't a threat, it's about oil, and we're going to use Iraq as a launch base to go into other countries.
[02:24:06.223 --> 02:24:14.270]  He says, Saddam isn't a threat, in the September 2000 document, that they publish it!
[02:24:14.350 --> 02:24:18.173]  Colin Powell said the same thing, and Condoleezza Rice said the same thing.
[02:24:18.493 --> 02:24:20.295]  We boxed him in, he's not a threat.
[02:24:21.758 --> 02:24:25.120]  And a few months later, they completely turn about face.
[02:24:25.561 --> 02:24:28.062]  But Dick Cheney said he's not a threat, but we're still going in.
[02:24:28.082 --> 02:24:30.223]  We're going to tell the people he's a threat.
[02:24:30.384 --> 02:24:33.546]  Folks, he writes this and puts it on his own website.
[02:24:34.066 --> 02:24:48.415]  I mean, it's not like it's Richard Clarke saying this, or it's O'Neal saying... No, even when they'd offered the ultimatum that you leave Iraq with your family, with your sons, they were saying at the same time, we're going to go in anyway.
[02:24:49.170 --> 02:24:51.531]  Well, I remember they said, leave, you've got a week.
[02:24:52.072 --> 02:24:58.355]  And then the report came out... At the same time, another branch of the government was saying, we're going in anyway.
[02:24:58.595 --> 02:25:08.320]  Well, it was in the news, British and European news, that they had jets ready to shoot the plane down, and they were saying, yeah, we're going to arrest you once you get there.
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:11.622]  It's still not been explained what the Russian ambassador was doing.
[02:25:12.322 --> 02:25:19.327]  A convoy left Baghdad for Damascus, flew to Moscow, the ambassador turned around immediately and came straight back.
[02:25:19.767 --> 02:25:24.230]  You know, that flight would have needed clearance from the American army.
[02:25:25.810 --> 02:25:28.192]  He could only have been delivering something or someone.
[02:25:31.194 --> 02:25:34.256]  Well, you talked about paying off a Republican guard.
[02:25:34.396 --> 02:25:39.319]  I saw Rumsfeld, I have it in these stacks of tapes I recorded on the eve of the war,
[02:25:42.473 --> 02:25:46.974]  In 2003, and Rumsfeld was on TV going, don't worry about the war.
[02:25:47.094 --> 02:25:50.855]  Of the three army groups, we've already made agreements and paid off two of the groups.
[02:25:51.155 --> 02:25:53.455]  We've paid off most of the Republican Guard generals.
[02:25:55.156 --> 02:26:07.058]  Look into General Ahmed Hussein, no relation to Saddam, who was the most high-ranking military officer below Saddam, the only one who could give commands to the army.
[02:26:08.262 --> 02:26:16.148]  He agreed to surrender when he did, and agreed to questioning, and then was released, and is now living happily in Syria.
[02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:25.914]  Well, yeah, and they paid these guys off in Euros, dollars, and gold, but Rumsfeld admitted all this, and after the war, the, quote, war, oh, we won this in, you know, a month.
[02:26:27.035 --> 02:26:30.417]  After that, he got on TV and said, I never, we never paid anybody off!
[02:26:30.738 --> 02:26:32.379]  We fought total resistance!
[02:26:34.643 --> 02:26:38.005]  I mean, they change their story every 10 seconds!
[02:26:40.767 --> 02:26:42.368]  That was why there was no resistance.
[02:26:42.448 --> 02:26:45.150]  There was no Stalingrad in Baghdad.
[02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:50.913]  Did you see that New York Times article where the White House official says, we're an empire now and we make reality?
[02:26:52.234 --> 02:26:56.177]  We'll change reality today, tomorrow, next week, and you're all just bystanders?
[02:26:56.217 --> 02:26:57.918]  We actually control reality?
[02:26:58.178 --> 02:26:59.939]  So what does it matter if we change our story?
[02:27:01.122 --> 02:27:02.683]  That's right, Dave.
[02:27:02.723 --> 02:27:10.569]  They've learned that simple lesson that you just tell a lie often enough and powerfully enough through all the media outlets you have.
[02:27:11.149 --> 02:27:16.593]  And you've got a shameless, gutless bunch of journalists.
[02:27:17.194 --> 02:27:19.896]  That's what O'Brien says to Winston and he tortures him.
[02:27:20.276 --> 02:27:21.297]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:27:21.657 --> 02:27:22.097]  Well, you know what?
[02:27:22.117 --> 02:27:23.218]  A little bit more time with us.
[02:27:23.238 --> 02:27:25.060]  I want to come back, take some calls, plug your book.
[02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:27.702]  We'll be right back with our final segment with our guest.
[02:27:27.722 --> 02:27:28.102]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.019 --> 02:27:36.919]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:39.021]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.922 --> 02:27:42.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.385 --> 02:27:50.190]  This is Jeff Domen and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[02:27:50.310 --> 02:27:53.453]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[02:27:53.473 --> 02:27:58.138]  Her name was Joni and she'd already lost 12 pounds in only 7 days and she was so excited.
[02:27:58.218 --> 02:28:01.982]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[02:28:02.162 --> 02:28:06.866]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[02:28:06.926 --> 02:28:08.727]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[02:28:08.768 --> 02:28:11.690]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Appamine.
[02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:20.517]  It's in the smoothie, you drink the smoothie, it knocks out your appetite, it helps you burn more calories, and you take in safely and without being hungry, and as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[02:28:20.577 --> 02:28:21.518]  It's a great product.
[02:28:21.658 --> 02:28:24.380]  And you're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:27.583]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[02:28:27.623 --> 02:28:29.024]  You don't pay anything up front.
[02:28:29.064 --> 02:28:34.068]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[02:28:34.088 --> 02:28:34.489]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[02:28:34.509 --> 02:28:34.609]  1-888-223-2838.
[02:28:34.629 --> 02:28:36.050]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[02:28:45.758 --> 02:28:49.641]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.861 --> 02:28:55.305]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.585 --> 02:29:05.952]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:06.112 --> 02:29:10.455]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.575 --> 02:29:11.456]  We're good to go.
[02:29:25.709 --> 02:29:25.990]  I think so.
[02:29:45.538 --> 02:29:49.221]  You've heard about POZ from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[02:29:49.502 --> 02:29:53.805]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[02:29:54.046 --> 02:30:00.972]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:30:01.352 --> 02:30:08.022]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:30:08.323 --> 02:30:11.788]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox to just concentrate.
[02:30:11.808 --> 02:30:12.589]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.
[02:30:16.895 --> 02:30:24.058]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:30:24.118 --> 02:30:30.821]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:35.684]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[02:30:35.884 --> 02:30:38.405]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:30:38.565 --> 02:30:43.227]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the Bio-Ox family of products.
[02:30:45.769 --> 02:30:47.271]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:30:47.311 --> 02:30:48.912]  until 2 p.m.
[02:30:48.932 --> 02:30:49.352]  Central Time.
[02:30:49.372 --> 02:30:50.934]  We're here and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:30:50.954 --> 02:30:53.656]  We're just telling it like it is.
[02:30:53.696 --> 02:30:54.397]  The reality.
[02:30:54.417 --> 02:30:54.817]  The facts.
[02:31:09.952 --> 02:31:15.534]  You can play along with the fraud, but in the end it's going to be reality and not the lies of the New World Order that's going to win.
[02:31:17.234 --> 02:31:19.915]  And this stuff is scary, but fighting against it makes you safer.
[02:31:19.935 --> 02:31:23.376]  Going along with it is what makes you really be in greater levels of danger.
[02:31:23.796 --> 02:31:25.476]  We're going to, this is our final segment with our guest.
[02:31:25.496 --> 02:31:27.777]  I want to just rampage through a bunch of your calls.
[02:31:28.737 --> 02:31:31.498]  Ron and David and Tim and Jeremy and Steve and others.
[02:31:32.975 --> 02:31:35.919]  Before I do that, listen, I'm really proud of this new film.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:37.862]  I poured my guts out on it.
[02:31:38.023 --> 02:31:42.689]  I spent three or four times the amount of time making this film I ever spent on any other video.
[02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:45.053]  I spent a lot more money on it.
[02:31:46.125 --> 02:31:48.285]  It covers the latest police state developments.
[02:31:48.425 --> 02:31:50.246]  Incredible 9-11 section.
[02:31:50.846 --> 02:31:53.886]  And then we get into the secret societies that really control America.
[02:31:54.246 --> 02:31:59.047]  We confront David Gergen, you know, the Super Karl Rove of multiple administrations.
[02:31:59.067 --> 02:32:00.548]  He blows up at me over it.
[02:32:01.508 --> 02:32:06.569]  We get into Arnold and the Nazi ties and how that connects to the Fool Society and Bohemian Grove.
[02:32:06.609 --> 02:32:08.289]  And it's all documented.
[02:32:09.009 --> 02:32:14.010]  I mean, if you really want to know what makes the New World Order tick, they're driving ideology or philosophy.
[02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:15.170]  This is my best work
[02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:16.711]  It is.
[02:32:18.052 --> 02:32:20.574]  Marshall Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[02:32:20.834 --> 02:32:23.877]  Go to InfoWars.com, link through the secure online shopping cart.
[02:32:23.897 --> 02:32:26.619]  You can order it right there off the site.

[02:32:30.482 --> 02:32:31.944]  You can call toll free to get it as well.
[02:32:31.964 --> 02:32:32.584]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:32.604 --> 02:32:32.644]  888-253-3139.
[02:32:42.310 --> 02:32:43.710]  Please call, get your copy.
[02:32:44.331 --> 02:32:46.011]  By the way, again, it's done today.
[02:32:46.111 --> 02:32:48.552]  It's going to the printers, you know, to be produced.
[02:32:48.932 --> 02:32:49.992]  It'll be done next week.
[02:32:50.512 --> 02:32:51.492]  And then we'll start shipping it.
[02:32:51.812 --> 02:32:55.873]  But for people, you know, who want instant access, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:32:56.193 --> 02:32:58.494]  Tonight, the first third of the film will be up there.
[02:32:58.514 --> 02:32:59.614]  It's really three films.
[02:33:00.374 --> 02:33:02.835]  Tomorrow night, all of the film will be up.
[02:33:03.455 --> 02:33:03.835]  Okay?
[02:33:04.175 --> 02:33:07.316]  And high bandwidth, low bandwidth, for Mac, for PC, whatever you want.
[02:33:07.996 --> 02:33:10.457]  PrisonPlanet.TV, my twelfth film.
[02:33:12.051 --> 02:33:15.754]  My twelfth film is now up on the site.
[02:33:17.175 --> 02:33:20.798]  And you really need to have this video.
[02:33:21.238 --> 02:33:34.928]  I mean, I guess if you count... I guess if you count my emergency 9-11 release I put out three weeks after 9-11 and I only sold for a couple months just to get the truth out, I guess it'd be my thirteenth film, which is bad luck for the New World Order.
[02:33:37.332 --> 02:33:39.473]  Bad luck for the Knights Templars, let me tell you.
[02:33:40.794 --> 02:33:44.255]  That's why they say 13's unlucky, because that's when they got the Knights Templars.
[02:33:44.275 --> 02:33:47.176]  The point is, you really need to get this video.
[02:33:47.256 --> 02:33:48.116]  I'm very proud of it.
[02:33:48.136 --> 02:33:49.237]  Please make copies of it.
[02:33:49.537 --> 02:33:50.397]  Get it out to folks.
[02:33:50.477 --> 02:33:52.858]  Make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:33:53.218 --> 02:33:54.379]  Get it on AXS TV.
[02:33:54.759 --> 02:33:55.819]  People need to see it.
[02:33:55.879 --> 02:33:57.120]  Two hours, 35 minutes.
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:59.621]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:00.021 --> 02:34:05.323]  Before we take some final calls here with our guest, who's the author of A War Against Truth,
[02:34:06.138 --> 02:34:15.071]  And of course wrote an article for the Globe and Mail of the Canada about Hunter S. Thompson saying that he thought the government was behind 9-11 and why they might be after him.
[02:34:15.772 --> 02:34:20.079]  And he's confirmed he was working on the White House underage cowboy rings.
[02:34:21.054 --> 02:34:23.356]  Uh, that's a big boo-boo, uh, there.
[02:34:23.816 --> 02:34:24.637]  Very suspicious.
[02:34:25.337 --> 02:34:29.180]  Uh, but, uh, so that is confirmed for those that have been bringing up that Skolnik talked about.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:29.900]  Good for Skolnik.
[02:34:30.381 --> 02:34:30.941]  Getting on that.
[02:34:31.301 --> 02:34:31.962]  Chairman Skolnik.
[02:34:32.322 --> 02:34:34.644]  Uh, let's go ahead here and go to Ron in Missouri.
[02:34:34.764 --> 02:34:36.365]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:34:36.385 --> 02:34:36.745]  Go ahead.
[02:34:37.226 --> 02:34:38.867]  Hello, Alex and Mr. Roberts.
[02:34:38.907 --> 02:34:39.307]  How you doing?
[02:34:39.347 --> 02:34:40.208]  Uh, I'm fine.
[02:34:40.248 --> 02:34:40.568]  Thank you.
[02:34:41.367 --> 02:34:42.768]  A couple things I wanted to bring up.
[02:34:42.808 --> 02:34:49.153]  I'd like to hear more on the conversion by Saddam in Iraq in 2000 from the U.S.
[02:34:49.173 --> 02:34:54.537]  dollar to the Euro on their oil pricing and the effect it had on Wall Street.
[02:34:56.118 --> 02:35:01.402]  Well, Saddam had actually changed out of the currency.
[02:35:01.482 --> 02:35:04.424]  He was trading oil for Euros and also
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.422]  I think so.
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:31.824]  But Venezuela was bartering oil for third world products, so it was sort of out of the system.
[02:35:32.444 --> 02:35:40.508]  And OPEC was seriously considering, as a means of punishing America, converting to two currencies.
[02:35:41.948 --> 02:35:45.650]  And economists estimated that if they had just announced
[02:35:46.218 --> 02:35:46.518]  Correct.
[02:35:46.538 --> 02:35:46.738]  Right.
[02:35:46.758 --> 02:35:54.123]  Also, the second thing I wanted to bring up, about two years ago, Alex, I sent you a copy of a newspaper that we received at our warehouse for the company I work for.
[02:36:14.927 --> 02:36:16.628]  It was dated 8-10-2001.
[02:36:17.048 --> 02:36:21.370]  It came in an Israeli package.
[02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:40.016]  I don't know if it was a newspaper of Israel or not or whatever, but there was a picture inset showing two airplanes on a cell phone picture or screen showing two airplanes crashing into a building with the comment, Crush America.
[02:36:40.726 --> 02:36:41.366]  Underneath of it.
[02:36:41.386 --> 02:36:42.307]  Do you remember that, Alex?
[02:36:42.967 --> 02:36:43.547]  Yes, I did.
[02:36:44.648 --> 02:36:46.288]  In fact, that was picked up by the news.
[02:36:47.068 --> 02:36:47.389]  Right.
[02:36:47.669 --> 02:36:52.050]  And, you know, the FBI came and confiscated it and so forth and so on.
[02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:55.372]  We never heard anything more about it, but I still kept a copy.
[02:36:56.132 --> 02:37:08.056]  Well, you have Sharon in the Israeli Parliament saying in an argument with Perez, which is documented fully, don't worry about America.
[02:37:08.076 --> 02:37:09.317]  The Jews control America.
[02:37:10.071 --> 02:37:10.491]  Correct.
[02:37:10.571 --> 02:37:17.033]  And to me, with the close ties and so forth with Israel, there's no way we couldn't have known about it beforehand.
[02:37:18.713 --> 02:37:19.893]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[02:37:19.933 --> 02:37:28.555]  I mean, I would add to this though, that a lot of people perseverate about Israel and, you know, Israel controls America.
[02:37:28.595 --> 02:37:31.336]  I think it's a mutual merger.
[02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:35.798]  Between the two bodies, what do you think about that?
[02:37:35.859 --> 02:37:50.268]  It goes back to the early days of planning for the State of Israel when the Zionists, in fact, were by no means sure of getting the territory at all.
[02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:59.194]  In fact, Palestine was part of the territory promised to the Sharif of Mecca for his help in fighting the Turks.
[02:37:59.835 --> 02:38:02.217]  You know, which was considerable risk to himself.
[02:38:02.337 --> 02:38:05.319]  The letter still exists, predates the Balfour Declaration.
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:12.765]  But the Zionists realized that what Britain wanted more than anything was somebody to look after the Suez Canal.
[02:38:14.726 --> 02:38:19.550]  So Israel's been kind of like an aircraft carrier?
[02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:22.132]  It's an aircraft carrier on land, that's what it is.
[02:38:24.181 --> 02:38:29.404]  When he took over, demonstrated to the other Arabs how phony their independence was.
[02:38:29.864 --> 02:38:36.887]  But when he closed down the canal, within a day, you had British and French paratroopers dropping all over Egypt.
[02:38:37.548 --> 02:38:39.769]  Listen, I got one more question for you, then we're going to the calls.
[02:38:40.989 --> 02:38:43.011]  You had a sit-down interview with Saddam Hussein.
[02:38:43.271 --> 02:38:44.291]  Describe that for me.
[02:38:45.892 --> 02:38:48.113]  Quite a scary character, I can tell you.
[02:38:48.793 --> 02:38:52.675]  And had all the gimmicks of power.
[02:38:52.715 --> 02:38:53.636]  Very smart man.
[02:38:54.412 --> 02:39:01.854]  Uh, you know, self-made, uh, you know, autodidact, uh, but, uh, somebody you certainly wouldn't want to cross.
[02:39:02.314 --> 02:39:07.176]  And, uh, you know, I was trying to get more personal things out of him, which he didn't like in the least.
[02:39:07.556 --> 02:39:17.119]  Uh, and he was using a translator, but, uh, when I, I remember asking him at one point, um, did he see himself as a second NASA?
[02:39:17.179 --> 02:39:18.880]  And without the translator, he jumped in.
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:20.300]  No, I first Saddam.
[02:39:23.769 --> 02:39:31.712]  I've heard that his wife was the vice-principal of a school and I thought it was kind of charming that she worked and wasn't in a senior position.
[02:39:32.372 --> 02:39:35.333]  I mentioned it and Sudan quickly said, no, she's principal now.
[02:39:37.914 --> 02:39:38.995]  So he speaks English?
[02:39:39.915 --> 02:39:44.317]  Yeah, he certainly understood it well enough to jump in.
[02:39:44.517 --> 02:39:45.677]  Kind of a pidgin English?
[02:39:46.278 --> 02:39:46.398]  No.
[02:39:47.933 --> 02:39:49.454]  That's right.
[02:40:02.794 --> 02:40:03.575]  Of course, I do.
[02:40:23.914 --> 02:40:24.554]  Yeah, he's on video!
[02:40:39.561 --> 02:40:48.764]  I mean, folks, this is, it's incredible, and you know, Saddam left Christians alone, they thrived in that country.
[02:40:48.784 --> 02:40:57.146]  He was, everyone there will tell you that Saddam was a really great leader until the Iran War, and something changed in him.
[02:40:57.887 --> 02:41:01.028]  And I think he recognized that America was out to get him.
[02:41:02.048 --> 02:41:08.950]  There were constant broadcasts on the American propaganda network, broadcast to the Arabs,
[02:41:09.886 --> 02:41:11.729]  Uh, comparing him to Ceausescu.
[02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:20.644]  Somebody sent him copies of the tapes of the interrogation of Ceausescu and his execution just to unnerve him.
[02:41:22.815 --> 02:41:31.358]  He says in a meeting with a number of American congressmen that he's very upset by these comparisons and could they please stop it?
[02:41:31.518 --> 02:41:32.959]  So they're sending him snuff films?
[02:41:33.359 --> 02:41:33.619]  Yeah.
[02:41:33.999 --> 02:41:46.764]  Hey buddy, this is what's going to end up... My point is, I'm not defending... Reagan lobbied the Congress not to censure Saddam for the slaughter that was going on at that time.
[02:41:46.784 --> 02:41:47.805]  Let me just say something about this.
[02:41:47.825 --> 02:41:49.245]  Let me just say something.
[02:41:49.265 --> 02:41:50.146]  I mean, this is important.
[02:41:52.279 --> 02:41:57.661]  Again, I'm not defending Saddam Hussein, folks, but compared to these other Arab leaders, I mean, Saudi Arabia, you're talking about evil!
[02:41:58.141 --> 02:41:59.981]  They make him look like a choir boy!
[02:42:00.321 --> 02:42:03.442]  Saudi Arabia makes Iraq look like paradise.
[02:42:05.003 --> 02:42:13.886]  I mean, it's a total hellhole, but I mean, if an American pokes their nose out of a compound, it gets blown off, but these are our buddies in Bush, you know, on his daddy vacation there.
[02:42:14.226 --> 02:42:15.926]  I mean, literally, they like have houses there.
[02:42:16.606 --> 02:42:21.768]  That's how sick this is, and then you look at 1953, the democratically elected leader,
[02:42:22.717 --> 02:42:26.300]  Of Iran, anti-communist, man of the year, Time Magazine.
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:26.981]  Most of it.
[02:42:27.301 --> 02:42:27.841]  Yeah, most of it.
[02:42:27.861 --> 02:42:32.765]  They said, you will give us all of your oil, or we're going to kick you out.
[02:42:32.785 --> 02:42:35.968]  And he said, no, we're going to keep some of it for our country, you know.
[02:42:36.268 --> 02:42:38.370]  And it was really a good... They threw him out and put the shine.
[02:42:38.810 --> 02:42:42.133]  But listen, I heard Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson, on
[02:42:44.512 --> 02:42:46.854]  On NPR a few months ago, from the grave.
[02:42:46.874 --> 02:42:48.055]  It was an old interview.
[02:42:48.495 --> 02:42:59.102]  And they admitted, on the show, that, oh yeah, we went and bombed stuff and shot people, and hired 2,000 thugs, and blamed the terror attacks on Mosedeck, and then threw him out.
[02:42:59.362 --> 02:43:00.043]  I mean, folks!
[02:43:01.486 --> 02:43:03.006]  They've caused all these problems!
[02:43:03.086 --> 02:43:10.128]  Iran was our ally and, you know, was non-fundamentalist and was our friend, and we threw them out!
[02:43:10.208 --> 02:43:21.071]  No, it was the encouraging of fundamentalist Islam in countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia that created the universities where a lot of these extremists have been trained.
[02:43:21.131 --> 02:43:26.552]  The Washington Post reported the millions of dollars of radical Hadiths, our government sending the textbooks
[02:43:27.262 --> 02:43:30.124]  Paying, making them, telling Arab children to kill Americans.
[02:43:30.765 --> 02:43:31.305]  That's right.
[02:43:31.705 --> 02:43:33.707]  And again, that goes back, have you heard about P2OG?
[02:43:34.047 --> 02:43:34.888]  Yep.
[02:43:35.408 --> 02:43:44.655]  This is the Pentagon office, folks, for those who don't know, where Rumsfeld says, we're going to go kill innocent Arabs to get them to make more enemies.
[02:43:45.755 --> 02:43:46.336]  Comments on that?
[02:43:47.472 --> 02:44:04.826]  Well, you look at the whole train of events that starts with the encouragement of fundamentalist Islam as a bulwark against communism, then goes to the training of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, and there's a direct path there to 9-1-1.
[02:44:08.368 --> 02:44:16.074]  I somehow don't buy the existence of Al-Qaeda on the level that it's supposed to exist.
[02:44:16.194 --> 02:44:20.297]  It would be far easier to take down if it existed on that level.
[02:44:20.357 --> 02:44:32.467]  It's a CIA shadow group with CIA officers in some cases manipulating useful idiots to carry out real attacks and then giant orchestrated theatrical events like 9-11 have nothing to do with Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:32.487 --> 02:44:34.288]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[02:44:35.029 --> 02:44:35.949]  Let's talk to...
[02:44:37.648 --> 02:44:39.390]  Tim in Oklahoma, or is it David?
[02:44:39.430 --> 02:44:40.050]  Who's up next?
[02:44:40.771 --> 02:44:41.973]  David in Arizona, go ahead.
[02:44:42.694 --> 02:44:43.995]  Hello Alex, how are you today?
[02:44:44.115 --> 02:44:44.396]  Good.
[02:44:45.197 --> 02:44:45.477]  Good.
[02:44:46.158 --> 02:44:51.124]  I think you might be interested to know that I recently worked in a Homeland Security office.
[02:44:51.284 --> 02:44:55.349]  I've been doing a little moonlighting lately for a temporary staffing service.
[02:44:56.327 --> 02:45:01.232]  Uh, they're setting up a new office over here on, uh, I don't know if you want the address.
[02:45:01.292 --> 02:45:06.216]  It's 4909 E. McDowell, Suite 106, Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:45:06.536 --> 02:45:07.617]  Talk right into your telephone.
[02:45:08.358 --> 02:45:12.021]  Yes, they're setting up a new female office here, uh, Homeland Security.
[02:45:12.581 --> 02:45:12.641]  Yes.
[02:45:12.862 --> 02:45:13.582]  In Phoenix.
[02:45:14.503 --> 02:45:21.029]  And I initially, um, almost turned down the offer, but I thought, well, maybe it'd be a good idea to go over there and see what's going on.
[02:45:21.089 --> 02:45:23.711]  Well, they were unloading truck after truck after truck.
[02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:27.661]  And then use some extra help for people to go in there and help them unload the trucks.
[02:45:27.721 --> 02:45:33.043]  You could tell that they were in a very big hurry to get this office up and running.
[02:45:33.743 --> 02:45:35.584]  And I understand there's two more offices.
[02:45:35.624 --> 02:45:36.565]  I don't know where they're at.
[02:45:36.605 --> 02:45:41.666]  This one's on 4909 East McDowell Road, over at Suite 106 in Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:45:41.686 --> 02:45:43.987]  Yeah, these are the federalization offices.
[02:45:44.527 --> 02:45:48.949]  These are the real city governments to sit above the city governments being put in.
[02:45:49.589 --> 02:45:50.310]  Yes, they are.
[02:45:50.650 --> 02:45:53.811]  And it's very obvious to me that they're in a big hurry.
[02:45:54.508 --> 02:45:57.310]  You could see that they wanted all the extra help they could get.
[02:45:57.330 --> 02:45:59.332]  They wanted to get this office up and running.
[02:45:59.372 --> 02:46:07.337]  Now, I was going to avail myself of a few of these placards on the walls, but they had a lot of private security.
[02:46:07.938 --> 02:46:12.321]  The security there was wearing a patch that said, Private Security.
[02:46:12.421 --> 02:46:13.782]  I said, Are you a federal agent?
[02:46:14.603 --> 02:46:15.724]  And she said, No, I'm not.
[02:46:15.804 --> 02:46:18.266]  And she wanted to search everybody when they were leaving the building.
[02:46:19.066 --> 02:46:20.207]  And I almost refused.
[02:46:20.727 --> 02:46:22.709]  Well, what were the placards?
[02:46:25.134 --> 02:46:27.215]  I tried to write them down, but I didn't have time.
[02:46:28.176 --> 02:46:30.598]  It looked like a bunch of security chiefs.
[02:46:32.179 --> 02:46:36.482]  Network security, property security.
[02:46:37.703 --> 02:46:39.704]  I'm trying to remember from rote memory here.
[02:46:39.724 --> 02:46:52.053]  You have thousands of these private security people in Iraq performing security tasks for everyone from Halliburton to Alfred Chalabi.
[02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:54.287]  How big is this facility?
[02:46:55.288 --> 02:46:57.408]  Well, it's not very large.
[02:46:57.448 --> 02:47:00.269]  It's kind of an old dilapidated office building.
[02:47:00.669 --> 02:47:05.370]  And it's obvious that they're looking for cheap places to set up shop real quick.
[02:47:06.450 --> 02:47:10.071]  And all these are going to be CIA nest of evil in all your towns.
[02:47:10.552 --> 02:47:11.352]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:12.072 --> 02:47:13.772]  I really appreciate it.
[02:47:13.832 --> 02:47:15.413]  David, Tim in Oklahoma.
[02:47:15.433 --> 02:47:16.153]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:47:18.394 --> 02:47:19.254]  You're on the air, Tim.
[02:47:19.594 --> 02:47:19.894]  Right now.
[02:47:20.549 --> 02:47:22.210]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:23.050]  We're doing a radio show.
[02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.651]  What's on your mind?
[02:47:24.491 --> 02:47:34.156]  Uh, Hunter S. Thompson, a lot of other things, uh... Really, the Hunter S. Thompson thing, uh, really, really scares me.
[02:47:35.277 --> 02:47:37.558]  Because, really, it's about freedom of speech.
[02:47:38.319 --> 02:47:40.020]  It goes into Ward Churchill.
[02:47:41.841 --> 02:47:49.905]  Um... I, uh... One of my friends blogged something, which includes, uh,
[02:47:50.635 --> 02:48:05.946]  Mr. Robert, the Globe and Mail article about, uh, I've only got the first paragraph or some part of the paragraph, uh... I know, talking about Hunter S. Thompson saying government involvement 9-11.
[02:48:06.507 --> 02:48:07.848]  We've got the writer on right now.
[02:48:07.888 --> 02:48:08.448]  What's on your mind?
[02:48:09.249 --> 02:48:14.533]  Um, well, the first thing is, when I found out that happened, I started rereading Kingdom of Fear.
[02:48:16.465 --> 02:48:18.286]  Yeah, this is Hunter's last birthday.
[02:48:18.707 --> 02:48:20.768]  We're just going to have to wrap the show up with our guest here.
[02:48:20.788 --> 02:48:22.089]  You're going to have to go the whole show with us.
[02:48:22.109 --> 02:48:33.818]  There's five more minutes with us, Paul Roberts, and you can finish up when we get back, Tim, but you got to get to it because I want to talk to Jeremy and Steve, or Stan.
[02:48:33.838 --> 02:48:35.379]  That'll be it for calls, though, after that.
[02:48:35.799 --> 02:48:42.645]  Wrapping up this Thursday edition, I've launched my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:42.705 --> 02:48:43.105]  It's out!
[02:48:45.569 --> 02:48:52.393]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.713 --> 02:48:54.094]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.294 --> 02:48:56.495]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.635 --> 02:48:58.737]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.017 --> 02:49:03.939]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:08.322]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.562 --> 02:49:10.344]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.404 --> 02:49:21.072]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.213 --> 02:49:23.114]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.314 --> 02:49:25.316]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[02:49:25.316 --> 02:49:25.676]  We're good.
[02:49:45.091 --> 02:49:46.691]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.831 --> 02:49:50.952]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:51.072 --> 02:49:53.953]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.033 --> 02:50:00.755]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.935 --> 02:50:03.935]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:04.135 --> 02:50:06.536]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.656 --> 02:50:14.558]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:50:14.858 --> 02:50:26.143]  Methazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:50:26.283 --> 02:50:34.067]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.107 --> 02:50:34.507]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.567 --> 02:50:36.268]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:46.058 --> 02:50:46.519]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:02.020]  We're good to go!

[02:51:45.688 --> 02:51:51.233]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.654 --> 02:52:01.926]  Just in case we run out of time in the next four and a half minutes, I want to thank our guest Paul William Roberts for coming on the broadcast.
[02:52:01.967 --> 02:52:05.432]  You can read the article he wrote about Hunter Thompson and 9-11.
[02:52:07.994 --> 02:52:10.477]  Right there at Globe and Mail's website.
[02:52:10.497 --> 02:52:16.061]  We've got fragments of it on my website, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:16.081 --> 02:52:22.567]  But yes sir, if you mail me the video you shot in Iraq, we'll put it on the website if you'd like.
[02:52:23.108 --> 02:52:28.873]  We'll post that for folks to watch it and I really look forward to getting a copy of your book.
[02:52:29.463 --> 02:52:36.648]  If you send me a review copy, I'd like to have you on specifically about the book, A War Against Truth, which people can get via the internet.
[02:52:36.688 --> 02:52:42.152]  It's not published here in the U.S., but it is, again, award-winning and sounds excellent.
[02:52:42.192 --> 02:52:45.395]  So, what's that website in Canada, again, where people in the U.S.
[02:52:45.415 --> 02:52:45.875]  can order it?
[02:52:46.095 --> 02:52:49.578]  It's Amazon.ca rather than .com.
[02:52:50.532 --> 02:52:52.513]  But it's not on the dot-com, huh?
[02:52:53.133 --> 02:52:55.074]  I don't think it is on the dot-com.
[02:52:55.094 --> 02:52:56.835]  My other books are on the dot-com.
[02:52:57.055 --> 02:52:58.136]  Oh, what are the other books?
[02:52:59.616 --> 02:53:02.578]  There's another book on Iraq, in fact, called The Demonic Comedy.
[02:53:04.278 --> 02:53:09.301]  And there's a book on Egypt, there's a book on Iran, one on India.
[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:15.642]  What else have I got?
[02:53:15.662 --> 02:53:22.286]  There's one on an undercover agent working in a Russian mob.
[02:53:23.487 --> 02:53:24.608]  Well that's got to be good.
[02:53:25.289 --> 02:53:26.589]  Let's go back real quick, Tim.
[02:53:26.609 --> 02:53:27.370]  Finish your comment.
[02:53:28.411 --> 02:53:41.500]  Yeah, the whole thing about the Hunter S. Thompson thing is, I don't... He may have said since the 70s he wanted to kill himself, but I don't believe that right now
[02:53:42.079 --> 02:53:47.862]  He would have wanted to do that because everybody knew that... Oh yeah, that plays into it if people talk like that.
[02:53:48.522 --> 02:53:49.462]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:53:49.502 --> 02:53:51.383]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Florida.
[02:53:51.403 --> 02:53:52.043]  Jeremy, you there?
[02:53:53.324 --> 02:53:54.244]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:54.264 --> 02:53:56.545]  Hello?
[02:53:56.845 --> 02:53:58.106]  Yeah, yeah, you're on the air.
[02:53:58.126 --> 02:53:58.486]  Go ahead.
[02:53:58.846 --> 02:54:02.468]  Yeah, I was wondering if you've ever seen the movie Enemy of the State with Will Smith?
[02:54:02.848 --> 02:54:03.108]  Yes.
[02:54:04.649 --> 02:54:08.471]  You know John Boyd's character in there who's really pushing for the movie version of the Patriot Act?
[02:54:08.791 --> 02:54:09.031]  Yes.
[02:54:09.961 --> 02:54:12.923]  In the movie, his birthday is 9-11-1940.
[02:54:13.243 --> 02:54:18.527]  No, I know, and they started building the Pentagon on 9-11.
[02:54:20.368 --> 02:54:21.409]  It goes on and on, yeah.
[02:54:21.889 --> 02:54:33.097]  Okay, and yesterday I heard you talking about people denying black helicopters, and it's pretty funny because after you said that, I actually saw my first black helicopter fly right over with no markings, no serial number.
[02:54:33.697 --> 02:54:38.220]  All they are are special operations night mission helicopters.
[02:54:41.187 --> 02:54:43.329]  It's just people still, the media says you're a kook.
[02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:46.932]  If you talk about them, you can go to military bases and see hundreds of them lined up.
[02:54:46.952 --> 02:54:48.012]  Uh-huh.
[02:54:48.133 --> 02:54:51.815]  Yeah, I mean, you saw a dozen every couple of hours in Baghdad.
[02:54:53.577 --> 02:54:55.558]  Well, they don't exist, even if you videotape them.
[02:54:55.638 --> 02:54:57.280]  Thanks for the call, Jeremy.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.102]  Let's talk to Steve in New York.
[02:55:00.162 --> 02:55:01.083]  Last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:01.243 --> 02:55:02.464]  Hello, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:55:02.704 --> 02:55:02.944]  Good.
[02:55:03.244 --> 02:55:04.806]  You're doing a great job down there.
[02:55:05.146 --> 02:55:05.506]  Thank you.
[02:55:05.806 --> 02:55:07.127]  I just ordered your video.
[02:55:07.648 --> 02:55:08.028]  Thank you.
[02:55:08.108 --> 02:55:09.429]  I always order your videos.
[02:55:09.569 --> 02:55:10.250]  They're excellent.
[02:55:10.994 --> 02:55:13.017]  And keep up the good work.
[02:55:13.698 --> 02:55:13.998]  Thank you.
[02:55:29.991 --> 02:55:32.512]  Pleasure was all mine, and you've got a great show there, and you're doing great work.
[02:55:54.904 --> 02:55:56.945]  Well, thanks for spending two and a half hours with us.
[02:55:57.045 --> 02:55:58.306]  It was a real pleasure.
[02:55:58.786 --> 02:56:02.129]  And I look forward to talking to you in the future.
[02:56:02.169 --> 02:56:03.449]  Do you need my address off air?
[02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:06.671]  I'll email your assistant.
[02:56:07.192 --> 02:56:07.572]  All right.
[02:56:07.612 --> 02:56:08.132]  God bless you.
[02:56:08.412 --> 02:56:08.793]  Thank you.
[02:56:09.033 --> 02:56:09.573]  Take care.
[02:56:09.753 --> 02:56:10.894]  All right, my friends.
[02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:12.375]  It's not about left or right.
[02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:13.416]  It's about right and wrong.
[02:56:13.456 --> 02:56:17.158]  It's about humanity and liberty and life versus tyranny and death.
[02:56:17.805 --> 02:56:18.606]  That's your choice.
[02:56:18.626 --> 02:56:22.009]  Remember, God loves you, and you stand up and help yourself.
[02:56:22.049 --> 02:56:22.710]  God will help you.
[02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:25.473]  But if we lay down to this evil, it's over for humanity.
[02:56:26.594 --> 02:56:28.556]  Don't forget the new film, Martial Law is out.
[02:56:28.696 --> 02:56:30.357]  You can watch it tonight at PrisonPlanet.tv.
