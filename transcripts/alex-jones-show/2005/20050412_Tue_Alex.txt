[00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:06.218]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:07.918]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:09.759]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.501]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:17.462]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:21.804]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:39.179]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.823]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition, the 8th day of April, 2005.
[00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:49.387]  Open line Friday, wide open phones.
[00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.889]  I'm going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:00:52.689 --> 00:01:03.197]  You can talk about the Pope laying in state, surrounded by, well, a bunch of Presidents and Condoleezza Rice looking like ringwraiths.
[00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:06.720]  Rice with this hood on, looks like Darth Sidious.
[00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:09.355]  Some type of a reptoid demon.
[00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.756]  And I kept thinking, well it's just this photo, or it's just that video.
[00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:18.378]  And I kept looking at the photographs, and man, that lady looked sinister with a black hood over her head.
[00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:21.898]  May add some credence to what David Icke is saying.
[00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:23.659]  Alright, now I'm being sarcastic.
[00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:27.980]  Chinese begin to worry U.S.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.841]  military, officials say.
[00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:36.182]  Equation has shifted in event of a Taiwan crisis.
[00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:41.797]  Oh yes, we've got to have a draft to keep us safe from the Chinese that we've built up.
[00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:46.239]  Bush keeps low profile at Pope John Paul II's funeral.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.722]  And I tell you, Bill Clinton's like a Siamese twin of George Herbert Walker.
[00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:55.465]  And they write articles about how much they love each other and they give awards to each other.
[00:01:56.644 --> 00:01:57.965]  George Bush Sr.
[00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.626]  has his son protect Bill Clinton from prosecution.
[00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:01.986]  He's in a pod.
[00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:08.769]  I want to air this Daily Show clip coming up after the break, just a clip, and analyze it because it sounds real good.
[00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.772]  But in the final, final equation, it actually helps George Bush.
[00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:18.213]  In a weird way.
[00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:20.934]  It's like Michael Moore's film actually helped Bush.
[00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:22.795]  It's just an accident.
[00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:24.756]  They didn't lie about WMD.
[00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:25.756]  It was an accident.
[00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.070]  And they just go along with that view.
[00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.092]  Former lawmaker decries Patriot Act.
[00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:38.796]  A whole bunch of liberals and conservatives met, led by Bob Barr, to detail what's really in the Patriot Act.
[00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:44.539]  And there's another Terry Schiavo type case, of course, going on in Florida.
[00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.161]  Homeland Security picks Total Information Awareness Champion.
[00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:53.304]  That's who they want to head up their new data mining operations, but they put a
[00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:58.403]  A salve out there to the public saying, oh, we're canceling TSA.
[00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.565]  Yeah, and reorganizing it and expanding it.
[00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:03.806]  That's how their spin works.
[00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:08.528]  Oh, we're canceling the TIPS program and giving it a new name and doubling its funding.
[00:03:08.548 --> 00:03:10.609]  That'll keep you safe.
[00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.331]  Man arrested, cuffed after using two dollar bills.
[00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:23.916]  He was in a Best Buy, 57 year old, business owner, brother's a prominent police officer, and he says that in the article like that's going to help him.
[00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:26.743]  Oh no, you're going to a re-education center, buddy.
[00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:35.086]  And he paid for some stuff with $2 bills because he had a bunch of them that he'd gotten from his bank, kind of as a novelty.
[00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:38.447]  And they just said, no, he may be a terrorist.
[00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:45.770]  And it actually says they handcuffed him to a chair in front of everyone for an hour until the Secret Service got there.
[00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.751]  And the Secret Service said, yeah, these are $2 bills.
[00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:50.792]  I thought everybody knew they were $2 bills.
[00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:53.610]  No, people don't.
[00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.433]  As if counterfeit, if you try to use counterfeit as if it's going to be something ridiculous.
[00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:00.274]  Counterfeit's going to look real.
[00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:01.895]  These people are morons.
[00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:08.540]  And then the police spokesman said, well, let me give you the actual quote on this.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.602]  This is just too, too amazing.
[00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:17.766]  Commenting on the incident, Baltimore County Police Spokesman Bill Toohey
[00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.792]  told The Sun, it's a sign that we're all a little nervous in the post 9-11 era.
[00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:34.277]  I mean, when they shoot some woman in the head after a Red Sox game with a rubber bullet, they say, well, it's the post 9-11.
[00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:37.138]  When they taser an old lady, it's the post 9-11.
[00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:43.341]  When they get caught running scams with crime labs, it's post 9-11.
[00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:46.442]  I guess trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:46.823]  Post 9-11!
[00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.043]  You know, I guess if a tree gets struck by lightning, it's post 9-11!
[00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:55.208]  It's the new Boogeyman, we'll be back.
[00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:04.842]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.815]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:12.783]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.043 --> 00:05:18.310]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:20.213]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.756]  The program for world domination has blown wide open.
[00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:26.680]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.585]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:37.952]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:39.814]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:00.113]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.141 --> 00:06:11.892]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:19.640]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.023]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:29.050]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:35.498]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.744]  The Berculite is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:41.666]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:47.810]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.972]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:08.865]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:10.546]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:11.407]  Now check this out.
[00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:15.230]  The average American consumes 2-3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.693]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:20.835]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:21.876]  Your health suffers.
[00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:22.757]  It's that simple.
[00:07:23.097 --> 00:07:24.899]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:27.001]  With the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:35.607]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:08.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.914 --> 00:08:11.957]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:21.185]  It is Friday, second segment, eight minutes into this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:26.169]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:31.290]  And your calls are coming up directly.
[00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.850]  Chinese begin to worry U.S.
[00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.711]  military.
[00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:38.691]  Officials say equation has shifted in event of Taiwan crisis.
[00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:49.874]  And we really need a draft to keep us safe from the Communist Chinese that our government's given basically all our weapon systems to, and moved most of our industry to, and given all the U.N.
[00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:50.554]  awards to.
[00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:53.826]  But don't worry about the Communist Chinese.
[00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:59.133]  Let's spy on fellow Americans and leave the border wide open.
[00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:04.481]  And Bush is keeping a low profile at John Paul II's funeral.
[00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:19.702]  President Bush determined not to upstage the funeral of Pope John Paul II, kept an unusually low profile in Rome yesterday, although former President Bill Clinton gave a television interview watched by millions.
[00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:29.550]  He recognizes the significance of the moment, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said of Mr. Bush, and the focus rightly should be on the Holy Father.
[00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:43.270]  Mr. Bush became the first president in years to conduct a full day's schedule on foreign soil without allowing a single press question, photograph, or even fleeting image on videotape.
[00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:49.734]  His father, the first President Bush, no, George I, also refrained from interviews.
[00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:51.295]  Okay, let me give you the spin here.
[00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:58.259]  Bush, the last three times he's gone to Europe, will not address the Parliament in England,
[00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:02.581]  The House of Commons, he will not address the European Parliament.
[00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:16.688]  He did, I guess maybe one press conference when he'd meet with a world leader, Jacques Chirac or anybody and they'd throw questions at him and he would declare that Nigeria was an important continent.
[00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:19.369]  It's amazing!
[00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.071]  And Nigeria is not an important continent.
[00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:26.893]  It is the most populous African country on the West Coast.
[00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.884]  With only 190 million people!
[00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:32.706]  I said something wrong a few weeks ago.
[00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:43.592]  I said 280 million people, and I don't know why I had that in my head, but I was looking at other numbers the other day, and it's... It's not, but it is the most popular.
[00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:44.533]  So I made a mistake.
[00:10:44.573 --> 00:10:45.433]  I meant to mention that.
[00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:46.854]  Incorrect info.
[00:10:47.374 --> 00:10:48.775]  It's the kind of stuff I mess up on.
[00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:50.116]  You've got to watch me, folks.
[00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.831]  We've only got about a 98% accuracy right here.
[00:10:54.191 --> 00:10:58.353]  We try to tell the truth, whereas the mainstream media tries to lie and spin and manipulate.
[00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:00.354]  So that's the difference.
[00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:02.615]  And we relish correcting ourselves here.
[00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:04.716]  We love being corrected.
[00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:06.397]  We love it when you correct us.
[00:11:06.877 --> 00:11:07.897]  That's how we get better.
[00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:08.978]  But no one corrected me on that.
[00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:09.658]  I corrected myself.
[00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:13.440]  Alright, now I'm kind of pontificating and perseverating and
[00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:17.092]  Wow, you're listening to myself talk.
[00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:21.834]  Actually, I'm procrastinating this giant stack of nightmare news.
[00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:38.522]  But, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I was looking at all these photos of Bush Senior, Bill Clinton, the First Lady, and Condoleezza Rice sitting there staring at the Pope.
[00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:42.704]  I mean, they would just sit there for hours as he laid in state.
[00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:45.702]  Pope John Paul II.
[00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:46.903]  The Pontiff.
[00:11:47.743 --> 00:11:49.424]  Papa, as the Italians call him.
[00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:55.008]  And I thought, does she just look incredibly psychotic in all these photos?
[00:11:55.108 --> 00:11:57.089]  Or is it just that these are bad pictures?
[00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.410]  So I did see it on TV.
[00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:03.954]  And I tell you, this is really their normal garb.
[00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:05.595]  I think she was in her element.
[00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:10.919]  She looked like a cross between a ringwraith from Lord of the Rings and
[00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:19.167]  And a space alien mixed with... I'm just having some fun here, but she really did.
[00:12:19.987 --> 00:12:22.628]  Mixed with the Dark Lord of the Sith.
[00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.411]  It was amazing.
[00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:28.891]  I mean, godly surprise.
[00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:37.635]  What are they doing wearing these Catholic style, or third world, second world style, I should say old world style
[00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.153]  Black shaws and hoods, these women peering out from them.
[00:12:43.173 --> 00:12:49.737]  I was looking at Italians behind them and they weren't dressed up in these get-ups.
[00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:54.260]  It just shows how it's all dress-up for them.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.723]  I mean, Bush will go to a Muslim mosque and he'll pray to Allah.
[00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:10.443]  And he'll go to the Pope and kiss his ring and get on his knees, and he'll go to a Shinto shrine of the demon, that's what the shrine's called, and clap to summon it.
[00:13:10.483 --> 00:13:13.744]  He'll grovel at the feet of the Dalai Lama.
[00:13:14.785 --> 00:13:17.226]  I mean, this guy is just a complete whore!
[00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:29.831]  And Bill Clinton was doing the same stuff, but what I want to know is, are Bill Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton, and George Herbert Walker Bush joined, conjoined
[00:13:30.555 --> 00:13:31.195]  Twins!
[00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:32.836]  Are they Siamese twins?
[00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:39.480]  Because, I mean, for the last... It was even before the tsunami of December 26th.
[00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:43.783]  Before that, these two were constantly giving each other awards.
[00:13:43.903 --> 00:13:45.024]  Clinton gave Bush awards.
[00:13:45.064 --> 00:13:46.225]  Bush gave Clinton awards.
[00:13:47.485 --> 00:13:49.366]  They talk about how they love each other.
[00:13:49.987 --> 00:13:55.190]  It's more sickening than Bush saying he looked in Putin's soul and saw a soul he could trust.
[00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.631]  A soul of love.
[00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.512]  A soul of love.
[00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:00.888]  Most people don't give you the full quote on that.
[00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.371]  I mean, I'm living in the twilight zone, but I knew this.
[00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:07.912]  I mean, I knew they were business partners.
[00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:14.215]  Billions of dollars of cocaine in the 12 years that Clinton was governor, shipped through there.
[00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:16.156]  We know that Bush Sr.
[00:14:16.216 --> 00:14:18.958]  was the commander, the don over all that.
[00:14:19.038 --> 00:14:20.779]  Clinton was a capo.
[00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:25.161]  I mean, I've interviewed multiple CIA officers who unloaded the cocaine.
[00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:29.347]  Actually, we're unloading it from the aircraft.
[00:14:30.227 --> 00:14:30.828]  Bush Sr.
[00:14:30.888 --> 00:14:32.109]  met routinely.
[00:14:32.129 --> 00:14:34.050]  He'd fly into Little Rocker.
[00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.371]  Clinton would fly into D.C.
[00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.814]  and they'd go into some elite club and have a steak together.
[00:14:39.194 --> 00:14:43.637]  Eleven times we know of in 1991 alone.
[00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:44.878]  That's almost every month.
[00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.420]  Important little meetings together.
[00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:51.223]  But now you can see how staged it is.
[00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:54.485]  And of course, a lot of you are still writing articles about, let's get Bill Clinton.
[00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:55.626]  Hillary, she's evil.
[00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:56.367]  Let's stop her.
[00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:01.331]  But it's all rhetoric, it's all theater, like WWF wrestling.
[00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:05.812]  Shakespearean play.
[00:15:08.494 --> 00:15:09.674]  With your thespians.
[00:15:11.215 --> 00:15:17.617]  Because Bush Jr., King George II, ordered Dan Burton's committee to drop it.
[00:15:17.657 --> 00:15:19.058]  I mean, vehemently.
[00:15:19.807 --> 00:15:23.208]  And has aggressively made everything Clinton did secret and then secured it.
[00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:29.731]  Sandy Berger can be in meetings stealing above top secret documents, sticking them in his socks.
[00:15:30.992 --> 00:15:33.293]  He said the four documents fell into his socks.
[00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:36.614]  That's funny.
[00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:41.336]  And I grew wings last night and flapped up to the moon.
[00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:48.342]  And he gets a little misdemeanor slap on the wrist, no jail time, pays a little piddly pittance.
[00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:50.703]  Fine.
[00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:52.624]  Not even a slap on the wrist.
[00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:57.127]  Folks, you get caught stealing some document, you're going to spend life in prison.
[00:15:58.288 --> 00:16:01.410]  Unless you're an Israeli spy like Sandy Berger.
[00:16:02.971 --> 00:16:04.772]  They're all busy blackmailing each other.
[00:16:06.434 --> 00:16:08.455]  So I don't want to hear about Bill Clinton.
[00:16:09.153 --> 00:16:22.782]  And how bad he is, and how you want to get him politically, and how we've got to make him pay, and we've got to vote for a Republican in L.A., and we've got to get Schwarzenegger because Hillary's going to get us.
[00:16:23.703 --> 00:16:26.465]  She's for the war, she's for gun control, she's for open borders.
[00:16:27.326 --> 00:16:28.046]  So is Bush!
[00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:29.287]  I mean, why am I supposed to, you know?
[00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:30.748]  It doesn't matter!
[00:16:30.888 --> 00:16:31.929]  It's staged!
[00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:33.690]  Can you compute that?
[00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.330]  I know you can.
[00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.031]  I know you're smart.
[00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:41.584]  But Bush is keeping him on profile because he has staged press conferences here.
[00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:43.585]  He has staged town hall meetings here.
[00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:48.186]  They order people to take signs down on his parade routes wherever he goes.
[00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:52.448]  And he only takes one question usually the last time he's in Europe.
[00:16:52.708 --> 00:16:59.470]  But now he's not talking to anyone because he's respectful of his holiness.
[00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.211]  It's getting ridiculous.
[00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:07.280]  There's a lot of news coming up, folks.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.263]  There's so much news, but I've promised open lines, so let's go to your calls.
[00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.585]  John in... No, no.
[00:17:13.745 --> 00:17:14.345]  John's next.
[00:17:14.746 --> 00:17:15.986]  Tim in Nebraska.
[00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:16.487]  You're first.
[00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:17.347]  Tim, welcome.
[00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:18.568]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:19.449]  Yes, sir.
[00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:22.971]  Before I get to my question, I'd like to congratulate you on your new film.
[00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:24.152]  It's really good.
[00:17:24.172 --> 00:17:31.157]  It seems a lot more professional than your other ones I've seen, and I can't believe how calm you've
[00:17:31.527 --> 00:17:32.888]  I spoke through most of it.
[00:17:33.288 --> 00:17:35.430]  I was wondering if you're on Valium or something.
[00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:41.955]  No, many years of working 16, 18 hours a day, I've gotten calmer.
[00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:43.316]  I'm just kidding.
[00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:52.462]  What I was calling about, I've heard you talk before about kids falling into the trap of the counterculture and this and that.
[00:17:52.703 --> 00:17:55.525]  Yeah, they pose their traps.
[00:17:56.303 --> 00:18:03.766]  Created literally by CIA mind control experts through Madison Avenue as alternative and cool, and it's not.
[00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:09.729]  Well, I'm kind of having some problems with my two boys, and they know about 9-11.
[00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:15.271]  They've watched your films and stuff, and I was just kind of wondering if you could kind of go through that a little bit.
[00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:16.631]  What kind of problems are you having with them?
[00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:22.314]  Oh, wearing the baggy pants and the marijuana and this and that.
[00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:25.375]  They live with their mom, so I don't have control over them all the time.
[00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.772]  And, uh, anyway, I was just wondering if you'd kind of go through that a little and I'll have them listen to it tonight.
[00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:32.793]  How old are they?
[00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:35.054]  Uh, 13 and 15.
[00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:42.837]  Alright, I'll, uh, let me do this.
[00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:47.319]  Let me run through a gamut of calls and then later in this hour I'll spend about five minutes on it.
[00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:48.179]  Great.
[00:18:48.914 --> 00:18:51.295]  All right, and I look forward to talking to your sons.
[00:18:51.815 --> 00:18:53.355]  I hope they're not destroyed.
[00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:56.776]  I hope they don't let themselves be manipulated by the controllers.
[00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:58.777]  Okay, thanks, Alec.
[00:18:59.057 --> 00:19:01.117]  All right, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:19:01.897 --> 00:19:02.778]  Jam another in.
[00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:04.478]  This time, John in Michigan.
[00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:05.258]  Go ahead, John.
[00:19:05.518 --> 00:19:06.218]  Hello, Alex.
[00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:15.521]  I'm up in northern Michigan about a mile from Michael Moore's house, but my reason for calling is we have a state legislator here who is upset about this new passport.
[00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:22.735]  Issue with the borders, stating that most people won't spend $100 to do it and it's going to hurt the economy of both countries.
[00:19:23.315 --> 00:19:27.076]  And so he's proposing a national ID card that both countries will recognize.
[00:19:27.116 --> 00:19:28.477]  Which, of course, we already have.
[00:19:28.497 --> 00:19:32.117]  They've already passed the law last year for a national ID card.
[00:19:32.157 --> 00:19:38.299]  The beefing up of the ID card is in the Senate right now to make it a Pan-American ID.
[00:19:38.339 --> 00:19:39.639]  So see, exactly.
[00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:41.499]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:42.539]  Stay there, we'll talk about it.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.240]  John, this is exactly what they do.
[00:19:47.095 --> 00:19:49.239]  But they'll keep the 100 bucks for the passport, too.
[00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:56.713]  Again, terrorist and illegal aliens don't follow any of this, and our government accepts their flimsy consular cards.
[00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:58.156]  Council cards.
[00:19:58.176 --> 00:19:58.637]  We'll be back.
[00:20:02.907 --> 00:20:03.928]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:07.053]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:11.479]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.740]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.061 --> 00:20:17.627]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:20.248]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.729 --> 00:20:35.418]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:49.731]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:01.188]  Gold.
[00:21:01.548 --> 00:21:02.849]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:09.171]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:13.193]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.553 --> 00:21:15.414]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.774]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:24.277]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:24.998]  We're good to go.
[00:21:39.414 --> 00:21:40.015]  I don't know.
[00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:03.008]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:13.261]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:22:14.326 --> 00:22:23.872]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:22:24.892 --> 00:22:30.396]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.211]  All water isn't the same.
[00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:07.473]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:23:07.733 --> 00:23:10.354]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:19.078]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:23:19.438 --> 00:23:27.882]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[00:24:18.917 --> 00:24:37.130]  December 26th, through the Senate of last year, signed by Lord Bush, actually gave amnesty to illegal aliens in many respects and ordered the states to accept any of their fake ID cards from Poland, Russia, Mexico, Venezuela, 30 plus countries.
[00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.372]  I lost track, so many new ones they're accepting every day.
[00:24:41.495 --> 00:24:48.117]  They're sending Social Security checks to over 30 countries right now, merging our laws, merging them with Canada and Mexico.
[00:24:48.437 --> 00:24:49.758]  The Canadians are freaking out!
[00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:50.618]  It's all over!
[00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:55.719]  Every week, some huge newspaper or CBC TV goes, we're giving up our sovereignty!
[00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:59.140]  There's state police from Texas up here running checkpoints!
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.940]  Your troops are up here!
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.781]  What's going on?
[00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:06.682]  And you know, they dispatch these high-level envoys to go, everything's alright!
[00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:08.383]  But in America,
[00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:11.712]  The average person has no idea this is going on.
[00:25:12.693 --> 00:25:20.518]  And then they go, we are going to charge people $100, you're going to have to have this special chip in your passport to go to and from the country.
[00:25:21.199 --> 00:25:37.369]  And for the millions of people that live along the Canadian border, on both sides, in fact most of the population of Canada lives within like 30 miles of the border, Toronto and all the rest of it, you're going to have to pay and then go back and forth.
[00:25:39.622 --> 00:25:40.482]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:25:40.542 --> 00:25:44.043]  And so they say, well, we need a national ID card to do that.
[00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:44.703]  Well, don't worry.
[00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:56.827]  The bill in the Senate right now, which gives even more amnesty to illegals, does all this horrible stuff, says that it merges our passports with Mexico and Canada for that reason.
[00:25:57.947 --> 00:25:59.428]  And it's just horrible.
[00:25:59.508 --> 00:26:02.708]  But, John, really good point that you raised.
[00:26:02.768 --> 00:26:03.729]  Anything else in Michigan?
[00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:04.769]  Yes, Alex.
[00:26:04.889 --> 00:26:07.970]  Up here in Traverse City, we have a radio station that has a
[00:26:09.035 --> 00:26:26.501]  Five minute section every morning at 825 where they do graffiti where you can do one sentence statements and for the last year and a half I started off with go to InfoWars.com PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and then I give my little spiel on that.
[00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:34.204]  So if anybody wants to call in at 825 to promote your program I can give you an 800 number
[00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:36.752]  Well, I like stations that do that.
[00:26:36.812 --> 00:26:37.775]  Yeah, give us the number.
[00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:38.416]  It's 1-800-817-0580.
[00:26:45.613 --> 00:26:50.636]  You know, if we had the staff to do that, we should have them.
[00:26:52.437 --> 00:26:55.379]  I would love to do that, but have like a five minute graffiti every day.
[00:26:55.659 --> 00:27:01.502]  People could just call a number randomly, and then do like 15 second, 20 second spiels, and we'd cut them all together.
[00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:09.547]  Alex, this covers half of the mid of Michigan, which is from the midpoint up to the UP, which is the upper peninsula, and over to Wisconsin.
[00:27:11.368 --> 00:27:13.509]  Call in and say criminal elements of the government.
[00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:14.349]  Carry it out 9-11.
[00:27:14.469 --> 00:27:16.610]  Learn the horrible truth.
[00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.171]  InfoWars.com.
[00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:22.434]  I go Bush and Kerry, Skelton Bones Brothers, InfoWars.com.
[00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:25.855]  I go ChemtrailAlert at WeatherWars.info.
[00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:28.497]  Oh, I just go on with all the different information.
[00:27:28.597 --> 00:27:33.539]  Anything that you are putting out, I put out the next day on Graffiti at 825.
[00:27:34.884 --> 00:27:37.406]  Well, you know, we're going to do our own type of graffiti.
[00:27:37.926 --> 00:27:41.588]  I've just got to control myself and limit callers to, like, 60 seconds, which I never do.
[00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:42.708]  I do it occasionally.
[00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:45.090]  It's a lot of fun, and it's very informative, too.
[00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.271]  Just take, like, 10 calls in 10 minutes.
[00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:48.912]  We'll do that when we get back.
[00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:49.552]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:50.453 --> 00:27:51.093]  I appreciate it.
[00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:52.434]  Good job there, John.
[00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:54.541]  Bob in Idaho.
[00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:55.242]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:56.642]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:57.202]  Hello.
[00:27:57.622 --> 00:28:08.586]  You know, considering the knee-jerk reaction of those people about that gentleman that tried to pay Best Buy with his $2 bills... And they said they thought he may have been Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:08.646 --> 00:28:16.788]  A white guy, a 57-year-old business owner in the town, whose brother is a senior police officer, and he goes, it's $2 bills!
[00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:18.688]  And they go, this is fake!
[00:28:18.768 --> 00:28:20.269]  And they handcuffed him there.
[00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:26.531]  And then the spokesman for the police department just said, well, you know, after 9-11, what?
[00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:28.532]  Everything they do, it's, well, after 9-11.
[00:28:28.612 --> 00:28:39.256]  Well, you know, it's obvious that they have come up with a psychosis to justify their illegal and irrational actions, and it's obviously PTSD 9-11.
[00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:42.797]  And what is that in the psychological manual?
[00:28:43.077 --> 00:28:44.578]  Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome.
[00:28:46.547 --> 00:28:47.028]  You're right.
[00:28:47.048 --> 00:28:48.309]  It is a new road season.
[00:28:48.349 --> 00:28:49.891]  A mass new road season.
[00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:50.391]  It is.
[00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:55.976]  I mean, cops at checkpoints want to search your car and they go, well, things have changed since 9-11.
[00:28:56.016 --> 00:28:56.637]  I'm like, what?
[00:28:56.657 --> 00:28:58.459]  You know, just leave me alone.
[00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:01.021]  And they're getting more psychotic by the day.
[00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.905]  Well, when they start going...
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.882]  He complained too much.
[00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:07.762]  We're arresting him.
[00:29:07.823 --> 00:29:09.885]  Or she was selling knock-off Rubik's cubes.
[00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:13.329]  Or the county commissioner gave too many parking spaces to the restaurant.
[00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:15.011]  We're charging him with a Patriot Act.
[00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:16.933]  Well, this is after 9-11.
[00:29:16.953 --> 00:29:17.914]  Ah, shut up!
[00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:20.036]  And then you go, but the border's wide open.
[00:29:20.156 --> 00:29:21.057]  Ah, shut up!
[00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:22.759]  You're a vigilante!
[00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:26.023]  Yeah, you're obviously a conspiracy theorist.
[00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:36.253]  No, no, I mean, if you read government documents, you're a conspiracy theorist, but if you're an absolute idiot who can't find Iraq on a map or doesn't know what a $2 bill is, they go, oh man, let's promote this person.
[00:29:37.254 --> 00:29:37.995]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:29:38.055 --> 00:29:38.876]  Have a very good day.
[00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:39.516]  Thank you.
[00:29:40.137 --> 00:29:41.658]  He's got $2 bills.
[00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:46.062]  Call the Go, call the 50, maybe with al-Qaeda.
[00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:49.586]  And they surrounded the guy and were freaking out.
[00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:52.359]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:54.462]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.383 --> 00:29:58.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.185 --> 00:30:05.327]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:30:05.527 --> 00:30:08.229]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:09.810]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:19.896]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:21.817]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[00:30:22.117 --> 00:30:25.980]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.683]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:30:30.843 --> 00:30:34.685]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:30:34.925 --> 00:30:41.029]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:44.111]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:30:44.271 --> 00:30:47.614]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:30:47.714 --> 00:30:51.577]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:52.897]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:53.498]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:03.102]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:03.182 --> 00:31:13.886]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:18.788]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.848 --> 00:31:30.192]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:37.635]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.035 --> 00:31:40.176]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.656 --> 00:31:45.638]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:52.081]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.
[00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:53.021]  803-4438.
[00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:56.482]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.723 --> 00:32:00.284]  That's toll free.
[00:32:00.304 --> 00:32:00.344]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.264 --> 00:32:02.945]  Soon the mark of the beast will be in force.
[00:32:03.145 --> 00:32:05.166]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:05.366 --> 00:32:06.046]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:06.206 --> 00:32:09.928]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:32:10.048 --> 00:32:15.810]  Call toll free 888-211-1715 and receive the book the Bible says for free.
[00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.231]  There's absolutely no obligation.
[00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:19.872]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketing.
[00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:20.492]  We're good to go.
[00:32:31.264 --> 00:32:31.544]  U.S.
[00:32:31.584 --> 00:32:32.625]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[00:32:32.725 --> 00:32:33.846]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:34.747]  Which are collectible?
[00:32:34.807 --> 00:32:35.547]  Which are bullion?
[00:32:35.607 --> 00:32:37.729]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:32:38.069 --> 00:32:40.210]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.631]  Coins.

[00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:07.244]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.246 --> 00:33:23.256]  I've got a little clip from the Daily Show that I want to play because it illustrates how in the name of countering the globalists, you can actually bolster them.
[00:33:25.418 --> 00:33:28.500]  So I want to dissect some of this spin.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.522]  And I mean, overall, I'm a fan of the show.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.401]  And John Stewart, I think he's very talented.
[00:33:35.042 --> 00:33:41.605]  We many times post his little political rants and pieces he does on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:42.926 --> 00:33:46.968]  That's coming up in just a few minutes after we take some calls.
[00:33:47.008 --> 00:33:50.410]  And then I'm going to plunge into all the other news on this Live Friday edition.
[00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.932]  But right now, as promised, let's hurry through some more of your calls.
[00:33:55.132 --> 00:33:56.913]  Robert in Denver, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.481]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:33:58.501 --> 00:33:59.542]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:33:59.582 --> 00:34:01.103]  By the way, how was your recent trip?
[00:34:03.805 --> 00:34:04.626]  What trip was that?
[00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:07.428]  The one where you spotted wings and flew to the moon.
[00:34:10.411 --> 00:34:13.053]  Well, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:34:13.773 --> 00:34:20.559]  Hey, man, you often talked about how you don't watch this, except when you do a lot of the displays, torture.
[00:34:21.663 --> 00:34:24.304]  I kind of got a real prime example of that lately.
[00:34:24.564 --> 00:34:26.144]  I've never watched a show until this recently.
[00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:34.125]  I've been getting CDs through my monthly CD membership of the show Alias that comes on ABC I think it's Wednesday nights.
[00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:35.566]  Yeah I've never seen it.
[00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.766]  Well it's kind of interesting.
[00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:46.868]  The basic plot of it is Jennifer Garner who's the main star is recruited by who she thinks is a CIA and she winds up going to work for them as an agent.
[00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:51.698]  Uh, he mentions to his fiancée, they find out about it and kill him.
[00:34:51.718 --> 00:34:58.803]  He then finds out that they're not really the CIA, but they are rogue CIA agents who spun off and formed their own agency called SD6.
[00:34:59.503 --> 00:35:04.566]  He is then recruited by the real CIA to be a double agent to get the goods on SD6 and bring them down.
[00:35:04.626 --> 00:35:10.851]  Well, anyway, a lot of the, most of the episodes, like the one I want to watch last night, have a lot to do with violence.
[00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:12.732]  Uh, for example, she was caught
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.946]  I haven't seen one cop show or one of these government drama shows where they don't torture people every episode.
[00:35:32.702 --> 00:35:49.451]  Yeah, and then they have these legal shows where every other episode it's torture, every other episode they're grabbing homeschoolers from their parents because the parents are terrorists, and then meanwhile in the real world they're doing drills coast to coast where they teach people that homeschoolers are terrorists, which is just a total fraud.
[00:35:50.672 --> 00:36:00.958]  Look, whatever the government propaganda is in the newspaper, it's the exact same propaganda in all these shows, and then voila, we investigate these shows and they're paid for by the government.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.061]  Excellent point.
[00:36:02.081 --> 00:36:04.122]  Two more quick items.
[00:36:04.302 --> 00:36:09.065]  A week or two ago, you mentioned something about a national cable TV show you might be doing.
[00:36:09.085 --> 00:36:12.888]  Can you share any more about that?
[00:36:12.908 --> 00:36:16.070]  Yeah, it's like playing roulette or something.
[00:36:16.851 --> 00:36:23.716]  People talk to me many times about doing miniseries or different TV shows for cable, and I've been
[00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:30.542]  I don't know, four or five cable miniseries about the New World Order interviewed.
[00:36:30.642 --> 00:36:31.742]  So, I mean, that's all it is.
[00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:32.983]  It's no big deal.
[00:36:33.763 --> 00:36:34.963]  Oh, okay.
[00:36:35.123 --> 00:36:35.543]  I see.
[00:36:35.563 --> 00:36:37.284]  There's 300 and something channels on cable.
[00:36:37.764 --> 00:36:48.486]  You know, being on HBO or being on, you know, Trio or being on Discovery Channel or being on, you know, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:36:49.162 --> 00:36:49.482]  I see.
[00:36:49.602 --> 00:36:50.362]  One more quick thing.
[00:36:50.802 --> 00:36:56.564]  Did you know that the Montana State Legislature is working on a bill that is passed... To pull out of the Patriot Act, yeah.
[00:36:56.984 --> 00:37:04.806]  Yeah, that and also require that federal agents would have to touch base with the local police before they actually... Totally constitutional!
[00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:06.987]  They don't have to pass a law to do that!
[00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:12.448]  But because sheriffs don't know that, they have to pass a law to tell them that's the law.
[00:37:12.468 --> 00:37:13.068]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:15.729]  I mean, it's like last year,
[00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:20.191]  Actually, two years ago, the state legislature, it's now back in session.
[00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:24.593]  They've had a bunch of emergency sessions, so it's never really been out of session.
[00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:25.693]  It's supposed to be every two years.
[00:37:25.713 --> 00:37:34.257]  But the point is, two years ago, they passed a law in Texas saying, you don't have to take vaccines.
[00:37:34.898 --> 00:37:36.919]  There's no law, you don't have to take them.
[00:37:37.879 --> 00:37:41.161]  There's no law, you have to have them to go to public school or private school.
[00:37:41.901 --> 00:37:46.103]  And the law went on to say, and CPS, Child Protective Services,
[00:37:46.761 --> 00:37:49.562]  Who has an open mandate and bounty to break up families.
[00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:53.683]  They just have a quota, folks.
[00:37:55.304 --> 00:38:00.626]  They, it makes it illegal for them to go grab children because they're not vaccinated.
[00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:04.287]  We had to get a law passed saying it's illegal.
[00:38:06.188 --> 00:38:08.488]  Because there was no law saying it was illegal.
[00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:15.051]  Because no one ever thought that they would go take children for something that wasn't illegal.
[00:38:15.471 --> 00:38:16.051]  You understand?
[00:38:17.106 --> 00:38:19.688]  Now, that is, there was no specific law.
[00:38:19.708 --> 00:38:26.012]  There were laws that it was illegal to arrest someone or take someone's child for doing something that wasn't illegal.
[00:38:26.932 --> 00:38:31.015]  But we had to pass a law to say it is illegal for you to do this.
[00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:31.955]  But they still do it.
[00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:35.658]  You know, that's the thing I was thinking about the other day.
[00:38:35.718 --> 00:38:37.299]  I mean, they just don't even follow the law.
[00:38:37.759 --> 00:38:39.280]  And no one's held accountable anymore.
[00:38:40.459 --> 00:38:49.403]  Every major crime lab in the country, I mean from Boston to Houston to Dallas to San Antonio to San Francisco to, I mean everywhere!
[00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:52.804]  They've caught them engaging just in total crime lab fraud.
[00:38:52.884 --> 00:38:54.785]  Planning, fingerprints, oh yeah you can do that.
[00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:56.746]  All of this.
[00:38:58.646 --> 00:38:59.927]  But still no one gets in trouble.
[00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:02.628]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon, no one gets in trouble.
[00:39:02.888 --> 00:39:05.289]  Halliburton, massive scams everywhere, no one gets in trouble.
[00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:07.610]  No one gets in trouble, no one gets in trouble.
[00:39:09.562 --> 00:39:14.583]  And they go burn Martha Stewart for doing absolutely nothing when she's chicken feed compared to these people.
[00:39:15.563 --> 00:39:15.963]  Literally.
[00:39:17.243 --> 00:39:21.424]  So, I mean, government, look, that's what tyranny is.
[00:39:21.504 --> 00:39:26.045]  It's just when government goes criminal and just starts doing whatever it wants to do.
[00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:38.907]  And, I mean, the best example I've seen lately is 90 plus percent, 98 percent, the state average is 95 percent, 98 percent in Houston, say, we don't want toll roads on these existing roads, we don't want transponders, we don't want this,
[00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:43.320]  And the government just says, you can't vote to do it, we're doing it, just shut up!
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:53.063]  And then it turns out there's fraud and bribery and, I mean, in the millions of dollars, and it's all over the newspapers, still they just go, you can't do anything.
[00:39:53.123 --> 00:40:05.966]  District attorneys will not indict them, because... I'm not going to plagiarize, it's a line from Sin City, and I've basically said it many times in other ways, but power
[00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:16.876]  Power, as Frank Miller wrote, real power is telling a lie and getting people to play along with it, even though they know it's a lie.
[00:40:17.236 --> 00:40:17.896]  That's power.
[00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:18.796]  That is power.
[00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:21.577]  That is POWER!
[00:40:22.517 --> 00:40:27.519]  Because... He's in the hospital room with, um...
[00:40:28.775 --> 00:40:32.839]  Bruce Willis, he says, I could shoot you right now in here, and they wouldn't do anything to me.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.241]  Because I'm a senator.
[00:40:34.701 --> 00:40:37.805]  And because if I go down, the whole house of cards goes down.
[00:40:37.825 --> 00:40:39.266]  Because everything's corrupt.
[00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:40.888]  Do you understand me?
[00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.051]  That's paraphrasing.
[00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:45.353]  And that's really how it is.
[00:40:45.413 --> 00:40:48.896]  I mean, anybody with half a brain in government, they know the globalists carried out 9-11.
[00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:56.142]  They know the truth, but they just, you know, well, I'm making 300 grand a year working for the government.
[00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:58.323]  Well, I'm making a million bucks a year working for the government.
[00:40:58.343 --> 00:40:59.403]  Well, I get government contracts.
[00:40:59.443 --> 00:41:01.404]  Well, I do corrupt stuff.
[00:41:01.445 --> 00:41:03.145]  Well, if I bust them, they'll bust me.
[00:41:03.205 --> 00:41:07.268]  Well, I'll get promotions if I just shut up and go along with it.
[00:41:07.608 --> 00:41:10.089]  You know, I don't have to be part of the child kidnapping rings.
[00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:12.050]  I don't have to be part of the heroin and cocaine dealing.
[00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.831]  This is what police people say.
[00:41:14.312 --> 00:41:18.694]  I just got to turn and avert my eyes and I'll move up the chain of command.
[00:41:18.994 --> 00:41:20.195]  Or I can join it.
[00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:21.796]  And I can make even more.
[00:41:22.216 --> 00:41:32.104]  And then I can live in a $2,000,000 house and nobody will ask how you're living in a $2,000,000 house on a $100,000 salary!
[00:41:33.265 --> 00:41:35.327]  Or a $150,000 salary!
[00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:36.268]  Chief!
[00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.491]  And nobody will say anything!
[00:41:42.313 --> 00:41:43.353]  The neighbor won't question.
[00:41:43.373 --> 00:41:44.154]  The neighbor will come over.
[00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:46.456]  Hey Bob, let's go play golf.
[00:41:47.848 --> 00:41:49.229]  I won't come play golf with you.
[00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:50.310]  I live by you.
[00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:53.571]  It's sick!
[00:41:53.631 --> 00:42:01.696]  I mean, listen folks, going to high school, and then working out at the gym, one of my friends, his dad was the head of the FBI in Austin.
[00:42:01.776 --> 00:42:02.697]  I'm not going to name names.
[00:42:03.397 --> 00:42:08.420]  I went to their house quite a few times, you know, for cookouts and stuff, and knew them.
[00:42:09.781 --> 00:42:13.223]  And then along came Waco, and he was one of the head agents out there, I'll just say that.
[00:42:14.584 --> 00:42:15.244]  And, I mean,
[00:42:16.368 --> 00:42:22.050]  And I, I remember even in high school I'm going, and I kind of ask nonchalant questions, well what's your mom do?
[00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.971]  Well, you guys have a big inheritance or something?
[00:42:25.612 --> 00:42:26.812]  Oh no, it's just investments.
[00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:31.174]  In like this, it had to be a million and a half dollar house.
[00:42:31.294 --> 00:42:35.635]  I mean, just, most fancy area of Austin.
[00:42:36.976 --> 00:42:38.256]  I mean, just come on folks.
[00:42:39.777 --> 00:42:40.117]  Come on.
[00:42:41.177 --> 00:42:41.798]  Come on!
[00:42:41.858 --> 00:42:42.798]  I'm sick of it!
[00:42:43.598 --> 00:42:44.999]  I'm tired of the corruption!
[00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:48.549]  And I told the story.
[00:42:48.629 --> 00:42:51.331]  I was in college and I was like, do I want to be a history professor?
[00:42:51.391 --> 00:42:52.791]  Do I want to go into private business?
[00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:53.852]  That's what I was leaning towards.
[00:42:54.912 --> 00:42:59.854]  Uh, or, you know, I told my dad, I said, you know, I might want to go into the FBI or something.
[00:42:59.874 --> 00:43:02.475]  And my dad's like, hmm, okay.
[00:43:03.296 --> 00:43:04.876]  And then all of a sudden he said, come up to my office.
[00:43:05.437 --> 00:43:06.177]  And my dad's a dentist.
[00:43:07.037 --> 00:43:08.098]  I want you to talk to somebody.
[00:43:08.158 --> 00:43:08.698]  And I said, okay.
[00:43:08.718 --> 00:43:09.618]  And I drove over there.
[00:43:09.638 --> 00:43:15.941]  We went to lunch and there's this old gray-haired guy, one of us, I'll just say he's a senior, very senior member of
[00:43:17.443 --> 00:43:19.004]  Federal Marshals in the state of Texas.
[00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:23.467]  He just sat there and he said, Alex, you're not a criminal, are you?
[00:43:23.487 --> 00:43:25.889]  And I said, well of course not, I'm upright and upstanding.
[00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:26.889]  And he goes, yeah, your dad told me that.
[00:43:26.909 --> 00:43:29.671]  And he goes, don't become a federal marshal.
[00:43:30.192 --> 00:43:31.052]  Don't try to do that.
[00:43:32.273 --> 00:43:34.695]  Because you're not a criminal, son.
[00:43:35.135 --> 00:43:37.037]  And I tell you, you don't want to become part of this.
[00:43:37.057 --> 00:43:39.699]  And he looked totally defeated.
[00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:41.580]  This is a big old six foot four guy.
[00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:45.339]  I mean, I probably wasn't even ever going to do that, but I just talked about it.
[00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:49.980]  My dad's the type who didn't act disturbed, because he knew I'd probably run off and try to do that to be rebellious.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.300]  He just had me talk to one of his friends, I guess, who told him stuff.
[00:43:54.721 --> 00:43:55.561]  And that's all I'm going to say.
[00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:56.641]  I'm not going to say any more about it.
[00:43:56.661 --> 00:44:00.902]  This is a federal marshal telling me he was about to retire, how criminal it is.
[00:44:00.922 --> 00:44:02.382]  You're not a criminal, are you?
[00:44:03.262 --> 00:44:03.963]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:44:04.003 --> 00:44:05.883]  He goes, well, you've got to basically be criminal now.
[00:44:07.023 --> 00:44:08.063]  He goes, that's all I'm going to tell you.
[00:44:09.164 --> 00:44:10.704]  You've got to be a criminal now!
[00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:14.469]  You've got to be a criminal?
[00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.410]  Can you do it folks?
[00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.171]  You've got to be a criminal.
[00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:23.972]  Or at least be so stupid you don't know what criminality is when you're involved in it.
[00:44:24.232 --> 00:44:26.213]  And then the dumb ones just stay low level.
[00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:35.036]  Always wonder why they're going out to get coffee and Philly cheesesteaks to bring them back to the office and wonder why the other guys move up and they don't.
[00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:38.952]  Heaven help us, folks.
[00:44:39.012 --> 00:44:40.653]  Just heaven help us.
[00:44:41.094 --> 00:44:49.860]  When Vicente Fox comes to Austin, Texas and gives awards to the police department for not following federal law and protecting the illegal aliens.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:45:03.310]  And then he gave another award to Wells Fargo, who issued debit cards that are now being accepted, because they'll give bank accounts to anybody, unless you're a citizen, then it's 14 hoops, literally.
[00:45:04.813 --> 00:45:09.854]  It's a double standard, see, it's designed to undermine this country, and then that's accepted by the state as an ID card.
[00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:14.316]  I mean, it's criminal!
[00:45:14.476 --> 00:45:16.556]  Here's an award for being criminals!
[00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:22.698]  So I went and bullhorned them and shut their press conference down, calling them what they are, criminals!
[00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.239]  Rick Perry and Vicente Fox!
[00:45:27.079 --> 00:45:27.880]  You're criminals!
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:29.980]  Criminals!
[00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.261]  Alright, I'm out of control.
[00:45:33.757 --> 00:45:48.789]  We'll go to more of your calls here in a few minutes, but here's this Daily Show piece, and notice he says that Bush is inept, the government are a bunch of idiots, basically they are just complete and total morons.
[00:45:49.189 --> 00:45:52.852]  How many times has the government had to tell us they're incompetent before we believe them?
[00:45:53.572 --> 00:45:54.833]  See, that's always the excuse.
[00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:56.054]  Oh, we're incompetent.
[00:45:58.216 --> 00:46:01.518]  But we develop missiles and can fire missiles that'll shoot through a window.
[00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.600]  No, they're not incompetent.
[00:46:04.935 --> 00:46:06.396]  Whenever they get... No, they lied!
[00:46:06.516 --> 00:46:08.817]  PNAC said it's about oil.
[00:46:09.717 --> 00:46:10.898]  Saddam doesn't have weapons.
[00:46:11.178 --> 00:46:12.479]  Dick Cheney said it!
[00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:15.180]  Not just Richard Clarke or John O'Neill.
[00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:18.461]  Paul O'Neill, excuse me.
[00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:23.844]  Confusing that with a good FBI agent who exposed 9-11 and they killed him.
[00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:25.024]  Talking about the Treasury Secretary, though.
[00:46:29.113 --> 00:46:33.756]  But the point is, this is the spin, and everything he says in this piece is true, other than that.
[00:46:34.097 --> 00:46:35.718]  And then at the end he goes, where are they now?
[00:46:36.338 --> 00:46:39.120]  And it shows Rumsfeld, you know, got his job again.
[00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:41.562]  Connelisa Rice got promoted.
[00:46:42.523 --> 00:46:43.964]  It shows all the people that lied.
[00:46:45.705 --> 00:46:52.069]  Paul Wolfowitz, now Secretary, you know, former Undersecretary of Defense, now head of the World Bank.
[00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:54.611]  Let's go ahead and play this piece.
[00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:54.871]  Hit it.
[00:46:55.292 --> 00:46:57.073]  Let's begin tonight with a simple question.
[00:46:57.754 --> 00:47:03.777]  How many times does our government need to tell us that they're incompetent before we finally believe?
[00:47:05.558 --> 00:47:17.004]  Last week, yet another bipartisan commission issued the harshest critique yet of American intelligence gathering, calling it dead wrong, worthless, duty-headed nincompoopery!
[00:47:17.945 --> 00:47:21.987]  Duty-headed nincompoopery?
[00:47:22.767 --> 00:47:26.169]  I say, the New York Times has gotten surprisingly lax in their language control.
[00:47:27.634 --> 00:47:32.857]  Commission Co-Chair Lawrence Silberman means no words in presenting the findings.
[00:47:33.658 --> 00:47:41.022]  The intelligence community was absolutely uniform and uniformly wrong about the existence of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:47:42.262 --> 00:47:43.243]  NINCOMPOOPS!
[00:47:46.525 --> 00:47:51.728]  And why this commission was not given the three previous commission reports to that same effect
[00:47:52.825 --> 00:47:59.530]  We'll be the subject of their next report entitled, The Report Commission Reporting on Report Redundancy in Commission Reporting.
[00:48:00.271 --> 00:48:08.637]  The... Redundancy.
[00:48:09.984 --> 00:48:15.386]  Of the handful of new findings, most concern a gentleman named Curveball, the anonymous tipster on whom the U.S.
[00:48:15.446 --> 00:48:17.527]  relied for much of the pre-war intelligence.
[00:48:18.067 --> 00:48:26.410]  The report reveals the man, Curveball, had been discredited by the German government as, quote, unreliable and alcoholic.
[00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:31.372]  Let me, uh, let me try and explain something here, quickly.
[00:48:32.333 --> 00:48:35.974]  When you're recognized by the German government as alcoholic,
[00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:40.520]  These people invented Oktoberfest.
[00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:45.884]  When they say you're an alcoholic, mmm, you likey the boozy.
[00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:56.131]  Now obviously any 14 month investigation of Iraqi intelligence would have to factor in how that intelligence was used by the Bush administration.
[00:48:57.112 --> 00:49:05.798]  And as the president stood between them, the commission's co-chairs delved into how this administration cherry-picked intelligence to justify the Iraq invasion.
[00:49:06.018 --> 00:49:07.499]  This could get pretty ugly.
[00:49:07.579 --> 00:49:15.704]  Our executive order did not direct us to deal with the use of intelligence by policy makers, and we didn't interview the president.
[00:49:15.944 --> 00:49:22.028]  Nor did we interview the vice president.
[00:49:22.048 --> 00:49:22.548]  There you have it.
[00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:28.867]  Under no political pressure, the committee has found there was no political pressure.
[00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:32.929]  Isn't that right, Mr. President?
[00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:35.130]  Sweet, sweet, Mr. President!
[00:49:40.633 --> 00:49:42.094]  And so the saga ends.
[00:49:43.115 --> 00:49:46.216]  All who should be held accountable were held accountable.
[00:49:46.236 --> 00:49:49.918]  I wonder what ever happened to all those people anyway.
[00:49:50.859 --> 00:49:52.740]  Has it ever happened in the history of mankind?
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.360]  Of course not!
[00:49:56.088 --> 00:50:07.137]  So Bush got up there and shook his finger at the intelligence community when Dick Cheney openly went to the CIA and ordered them to lie.
[00:50:07.157 --> 00:50:10.200]  I mean, this is just too incredible.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:16.845]  He got up on TV last week and was literally shaking his finger going, how dare them do this?
[00:50:16.985 --> 00:50:22.750]  I've got to have more power over the intelligence community because they did this and man, you're really bad.
[00:50:25.145 --> 00:50:26.225]  It's amazing.
[00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:35.850]  It's like they set fire to the house and then they show up as the firemen and criticize themselves as arsonists.
[00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:40.612]  It just defies belief.
[00:50:41.353 --> 00:50:46.155]  And of course the neocons are all over talk radio saying they never sent their weapons of mass destruction.
[00:50:46.655 --> 00:50:47.516]  It's an urban legend.
[00:50:47.536 --> 00:50:48.496]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:49.837 --> 00:50:52.178]  We'll be back with more of your calls and a bunch of news.
[00:50:52.218 --> 00:50:53.639]  It's wide open phones today.

[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.284]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.424 --> 00:51:14.828]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.848 --> 00:51:16.190]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:17.930]  Panama!
[00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:22.192]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.252 --> 00:51:29.195]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.315 --> 00:51:31.375]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:42.179]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:44.280]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,

[00:54:20.696 --> 00:54:29.221]  Before I do that, and plunge into more news and information, my new film, Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out on VHS and DVD.
[00:54:29.241 --> 00:54:33.663]  It is my best work, best film I've ever made.
[00:54:33.683 --> 00:54:37.965]  Two and a half plus hours long on VHS, three plus hours on DVD.
[00:54:39.975 --> 00:54:48.518]  And it covers the latest police state developments, what really happened on 9-11 like no other film does, and who the Globalists really are, what their world plan and vision is.
[00:54:49.678 --> 00:54:52.279]  It's a great video, and I just want it to be seen.
[00:54:52.719 --> 00:54:53.939]  So please get a copy.
[00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:55.180]  Please make copies.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.581]  I want to commend those that have gotten my films in the past and made copies.
[00:54:58.601 --> 00:54:59.401]  You've had a big effect.
[00:54:59.821 --> 00:55:02.482]  This one needs to be seen, and it won't be seen unless you get it.
[00:55:03.297 --> 00:55:06.398]  Make copies of it and tell those you give it to, to make copies.
[00:55:06.858 --> 00:55:08.939]  Hundreds of tapes can turn into hundreds of thousands.
[00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:13.200]  Thousands of tapes, I've done the math, can turn into millions.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:19.222]  And if you've got a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can watch all of Martial Law on high bandwidth or low bandwidth.

[00:55:26.744 --> 00:55:29.885]  And it'll just cost you, I don't know, like 50 cents a piece or less.
[00:55:30.934 --> 00:55:31.795]  Why don't you do that?
[00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:33.256]  You know, I mean, there's nothing to stop you.
[00:55:33.316 --> 00:55:33.997]  I want you to.
[00:55:34.037 --> 00:55:34.958]  I just want to be seen.
[00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:35.798]  I want to warn people.
[00:55:36.098 --> 00:55:36.779]  That's my goal.

[00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.612]  Let's now go to Jason in Maryland.
[00:56:32.652 --> 00:56:33.333]  Jason, welcome.
[00:56:33.873 --> 00:56:34.394]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:34.774]  Thanks.
[00:56:35.094 --> 00:56:35.435]  Hello.
[00:56:36.315 --> 00:56:43.701]  Have you seen any pictures of the new Israeli Supreme Court?
[00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.263]  Are you talking about all the occult symbols?
[00:56:46.483 --> 00:56:46.803]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:49.005]  The giant pyramid of the All-Seeing Eye?
[00:56:49.445 --> 00:56:52.387]  Well, that among hundreds of others.
[00:56:52.807 --> 00:56:54.769]  I mean, what building doesn't have obelisks and
[00:56:56.913 --> 00:57:10.765]  I think it's significant that that's the Israeli Supreme Court that was built by the Rothschilds and that it's on a ley line with the Knesset and the Foreign Ministry and the Central Bank of Israel.
[00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:15.140]  I guess with my, uh...
[00:57:32.461 --> 00:57:44.297]  by history in the bible that when i saw this in the israeli supreme court and that they have this uh... all seeing eye sitting it's basically uh... if you do an overlay uh... it's basically a
[00:57:45.149 --> 00:57:45.669]  A temple.
[00:57:46.169 --> 00:57:50.631]  It's where the pyramid is sitting, where the Holy of Holies would be, in fact.
[00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:58.593]  Yeah, and again, it was the pyramid that was the symbol of those that enslaved the Jews when they were in bondage in Egypt.
[00:57:58.893 --> 00:57:59.153]  Right.
[00:57:59.534 --> 00:58:01.134]  I was going to ask you if you knew anything.
[00:58:01.154 --> 00:58:04.035]  See, that's what, when Moses threw the tablets at the people,
[00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:05.968]  That's what I was going to ask you.
[00:58:05.988 --> 00:58:08.309]  Do you feel, do you agree with the theory that the Masons are the
[00:58:30.163 --> 00:58:32.844]  Templars after the persecution of the church?
[00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:33.405]  Well, yeah.
[00:58:33.465 --> 00:58:35.145]  I mean, they... It's Templars.
[00:58:35.186 --> 00:58:36.066]  We're Masons.
[00:58:36.086 --> 00:58:37.347]  The Masons predate that.
[00:58:38.167 --> 00:58:39.908]  It goes back further than Solomon's Temple.
[00:58:40.568 --> 00:58:42.609]  Further than Solomon's Temple?
[00:58:42.709 --> 00:58:43.810]  It goes back to Egypt.
[00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:44.390]  Wow.
[00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.671]  Before Solomon's Temple.
[00:58:45.691 --> 00:58:47.211]  Can you speak to that after the break?
[00:58:47.472 --> 00:58:48.272]  I'll try to.
[00:58:51.654 --> 00:58:52.234]  Hello, folk.
[00:58:57.957 --> 00:58:58.537]  Big brother.
[00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.251]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:02.132]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:03.613]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.633 --> 00:59:05.274]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.915 --> 00:59:09.617]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.118 --> 00:59:14.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.502 --> 00:59:21.766]  Alright, now 25 seconds into the second hour of worldwide transmission against charity.
[00:59:23.407 --> 00:59:24.668]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:26.870]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:29.051]  In our search for the truth.
[00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:51.043]  Alright, I've had several questions in the last hour that will be so lengthy, I'll have to... At the bottom of this hour, in 30 minutes, I will answer the question for the father who wants to wake his two sons up to how the counterculture is controlled and meant to get them into very destructive lifestyles so the social architects can get control of them.
[00:59:51.063 --> 00:59:54.965]  The last caller wanted me to talk about the origin of the masons.
[00:59:55.909 --> 00:59:58.030]  And the Babylon Mystery Religions.
[00:59:59.111 --> 01:00:02.192]  And so I'll... I've written a note here on both those questions.
[01:00:02.252 --> 01:00:04.434]  I'll cover those for about 5 minutes apiece.
[01:00:06.174 --> 01:00:07.995]  And again, I'm not the final authority on this.
[01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:09.056]  You need to research it yourself.
[01:00:09.796 --> 01:00:10.977]  Coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:14.056 --> 01:00:17.259]  I do want to continue with your phone calls today.

[01:00:22.643 --> 01:00:23.143]  military.
[01:00:23.523 --> 01:00:26.085]  Bush keeps low profile at Pope John Paul II's funeral.
[01:00:26.806 --> 01:00:32.690]  I also want to get into former lawmaker decries Patriot Act in a big meeting they had in Florida.
[01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:33.551]  Bob Barr.
[01:00:33.571 --> 01:00:36.373]  Homeland Security picks total information awareness.

[01:01:11.814 --> 01:01:12.675]  Let us now go ahead and speak.
[01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:20.504]  To David in Delaware.
[01:01:20.564 --> 01:01:21.205]  Welcome, David.
[01:01:21.465 --> 01:01:22.165]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:22.806]  How are you, sir?
[01:01:23.226 --> 01:01:23.607]  I'm good.
[01:01:24.107 --> 01:01:30.453]  The gentleman's been trying to get all these videos into the libraries here in Delaware also from you and also the Power Hour.
[01:01:30.733 --> 01:01:31.514]  I commend you.
[01:01:31.734 --> 01:01:32.115]  Thank you.
[01:01:33.896 --> 01:01:41.043]  I called in yesterday and spoke to the gentleman at your office, and I don't know if you got the message or not about the shooting here in Delaware and Maryland.
[01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:43.274]  I did hear about that.
[01:01:43.294 --> 01:01:45.595]  There was another shooting.
[01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.455]  There's been quite a few lately.
[01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.276]  Tell us all about it.
[01:01:48.296 --> 01:01:50.036]  Well, this one here was two dead.
[01:01:50.056 --> 01:01:51.796]  I think there's four wounded.
[01:01:51.816 --> 01:01:54.557]  They started in Steepert, Delaware.
[01:01:54.577 --> 01:02:00.759]  They end up going south as far as Salisbury, Maryland is where he got caught about 45 minutes later.
[01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:04.020]  It was close to some of the schools.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.200]  They had school lockdowns in Delaware and Maryland, both.
[01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:09.221]  And it was on from
[01:02:10.866 --> 01:02:16.410]  8 something or 9 something that morning until about noon is when they unlocked everything.
[01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:18.971]  And DEMA was FEMA.
[01:02:19.472 --> 01:02:20.472]  They were involved in it.
[01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:23.314]  If anybody wants that information, I have that number here.
[01:02:23.935 --> 01:02:26.176]  It's a www.state.de.us program.
[01:02:36.621 --> 01:02:38.685]  Yeah, nobody will be able to write that down.
[01:02:38.985 --> 01:02:41.150]  I'll tell you what, email it to me and I'll try to post it.
[01:02:42.132 --> 01:02:44.216]  So how did you learn that FEMA was involved?
[01:02:44.557 --> 01:02:46.962]  Well, I've got the newspaper in front of me right now.
[01:02:48.288 --> 01:02:55.250]  And also, a certain amount of information has been on the news, but I didn't know anything about FEMA until I'd seen the newspaper itself.
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.131]  FEMA was helping coordinate?
[01:02:57.371 --> 01:02:57.771]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:58.952]  The federal government?
[01:02:59.152 --> 01:02:59.852]  Yes, yes.
[01:02:59.972 --> 01:03:01.232]  And you have someone out shooting?
[01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:02.073]  It's an emergency?
[01:03:02.093 --> 01:03:06.294]  Well, they've said under a red alert, all of our rights are stripped and we can't even leave our homes.
[01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:08.255]  Plus, this gentleman was a 22-year-old.
[01:03:08.275 --> 01:03:09.715]  He killed a dog, also.
[01:03:10.676 --> 01:03:13.877]  And then he shot and killed two people, and I think there were four wounded.
[01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:15.617]  The gentleman's a 22-year-old.
[01:03:16.018 --> 01:03:16.978]  I bet money he's on
[01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:18.892]  He caught me on drugs.
[01:03:19.232 --> 01:03:20.093]  Prozac or something.
[01:03:20.153 --> 01:03:21.454]  And plus he threatened the judge.
[01:03:21.474 --> 01:03:24.476]  The judge told him he was going to put him out or take care of him.
[01:03:24.537 --> 01:03:26.458]  And the man told him he was going to take care of him.
[01:03:26.538 --> 01:03:27.879]  So he's in jail.
[01:03:27.899 --> 01:03:30.081]  They're not going to put him on no bond or anything.
[01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:32.323]  Well, they ought to execute the guy anyway to start with.
[01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:33.784]  He killed that many people.
[01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:40.329]  But another thing is, I have a 230 page booklet on the images of Washington, D.C.
[01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:46.054]  If anybody wants that number, I don't know if it's in existence now, but it's through the Jerry Henson.
[01:03:46.074 --> 01:03:46.614]  H-E-N-S-O-N.
[01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:49.977]  And the youth have a number with a 405.
[01:03:50.637 --> 01:03:52.938]  We got a break, sir.
[01:03:53.498 --> 01:03:55.019]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:58.280]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:02.322]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:06.624]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:10.726]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.667]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:16.149]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.209 --> 01:04:20.913]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.073 --> 01:04:24.115]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:27.157]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.637 --> 01:04:33.762]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.282 --> 01:04:38.085]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:38.486 --> 01:04:39.867]  Order your video today.
[01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:41.248]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[01:04:52.837 --> 01:05:01.442]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.662 --> 01:05:12.948]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.168 --> 01:05:15.790]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:22.617]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.777 --> 01:05:24.659]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.839 --> 01:05:30.865]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:36.791]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:42.475]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:55.431]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:59.533]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:59.853 --> 01:06:00.653]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.094 --> 01:06:05.196]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.436 --> 01:06:09.638]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.998 --> 01:06:14.880]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.822]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:24.366]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.646 --> 01:06:27.387]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:27.668 --> 01:06:28.568]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:53.682 --> 01:06:59.344]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.067 --> 01:07:06.308]  Oh, that's too bad!
[01:07:07.368 --> 01:07:08.389]  We had a Helga.
[01:07:09.597 --> 01:07:10.818]  From Germany calling.
[01:07:10.838 --> 01:07:14.800]  And I was going to skip everybody and go to her.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.541]  Because I knew a Helga here in Austin, Texas.
[01:07:18.561 --> 01:07:19.682]  She was so freaked out.
[01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.903]  She lived here since the end of World War II.
[01:07:22.243 --> 01:07:23.824]  That she moved back to Germany.
[01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:27.706]  And I was wondering if that was the same Helga who was calling in.
[01:07:28.046 --> 01:07:28.907]  But she just hung up.
[01:07:29.447 --> 01:07:31.168]  Literally 10 seconds before I went to her.
[01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.129]  Helga, if you can get back in on the phone lines.
[01:07:34.149 --> 01:07:35.690]  I don't know we have any open lines.
[01:07:37.696 --> 01:07:40.597]  1-800-259-9231 will go right to you.
[01:07:40.977 --> 01:07:47.538]  Even if you're not the Helga I knew who was real active here in Austin up until she moved away about six months ago.
[01:07:48.438 --> 01:07:50.599]  Be nice to hear from Helga again if that was the same Helga.
[01:07:52.839 --> 01:07:57.100]  We have a bunch of phone calls here and I want to go to them.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.800]  I also want to take your calls.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.361]  Some callers have brought up some important questions that I haven't had time to get to yet.
[01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:08.408]  Namely, how the government creates phony counterculture to try to manipulate society.
[01:08:08.428 --> 01:08:14.736]  Because I know we're naturally rebellious to authority, so they create fake rebellions that they scare and manipulate.
[01:08:14.776 --> 01:08:15.517]  That's coming up.
[01:08:15.537 --> 01:08:19.542]  Plus, a caller wanted to know about the history of the Masons and their occult connections.
[01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.845]  So I'm getting to that later as well.
[01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:28.092]  But, uh, suspect in Maryland-Delaware shootings had a warrant.
[01:08:28.693 --> 01:08:33.315]  Suspect charged in fatal Maryland-Delaware shooting spree was wanted on a warrant.
[01:08:33.355 --> 01:08:38.738]  Investigators at the scene of a fatal shooting are taking photographs and trying to find out just how it all happened.
[01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:49.924]  A man charged with murder after allegedly donning a bulletproof vest and tearing through two states on an apparent random shooting spree was wanted on a warrant related to a 2004 shooting incident.
[01:08:50.545 --> 01:08:51.265]  Authorities said
[01:08:52.322 --> 01:09:04.133]  Allison Lamont Norman 22 of Seaford, Delaware was arrested Thursday after a series of shootings left two dead and four wounded along a bloody trail from Laurel, Delaware to Salisbury, Maryland.
[01:09:04.153 --> 01:09:06.135]  They locked everything down as a total police state.
[01:09:06.616 --> 01:09:11.961]  The violence erupted one day after a warrant was issued for Norman's arrest when he felled a pier in
[01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:21.021]  Like, Kimico County Circuit Court on charges of related to gunfire at a shopping center and convenience store in Delmar last October.
[01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:22.462]  Why wasn't he in jail?
[01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:37.474]  It's like this guy who, up there in Minnesota, said, I'm gonna kill people, and made illustrations about it, and had an MSN personal account, you know, a website, an MSN, saying, I wanna kill people.
[01:09:38.999 --> 01:09:45.682]  But his dad, or his grandfather, excuse me, was a high-level, almost a police chief, like a deputy police chief.
[01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:49.423]  And so nothing could be done to him.
[01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:58.987]  But you write a fictitious story about zombies attacking an imaginary school listing no real names, and they go, you threatened people with the undead.
[01:09:59.047 --> 01:10:00.728]  We're charging you as a terrorist.
[01:10:00.968 --> 01:10:01.668]  See how that works?
[01:10:03.177 --> 01:10:12.001]  Davis Rourke, a state attorney for the county, said Norman had at least one drug-related felony conviction in Delaware.
[01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:13.241]  Norman is known in Delaware.
[01:10:13.681 --> 01:10:14.402]  Law enforcement.
[01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:15.142]  Oh really?
[01:10:15.262 --> 01:10:15.842]  But he's out.
[01:10:16.762 --> 01:10:17.143]  What is it?
[01:10:17.183 --> 01:10:20.864]  In Texas, a murderer spends an average of four and a half years in prison?
[01:10:22.545 --> 01:10:28.707]  And that's near the national average, but there's people for marijuana convictions who serve more on average.
[01:10:28.727 --> 01:10:30.188]  Because they make good workers.
[01:10:30.228 --> 01:10:32.789]  A murderer doesn't in your prison industries.
[01:10:33.419 --> 01:10:36.481]  But a good little pothead does.
[01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:39.603]  Very, very interesting.
[01:10:39.643 --> 01:10:42.465]  Plus, they've got to release the violent offenders to continue to create the crises.
[01:10:42.485 --> 01:10:43.986]  It's an actual formula.
[01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:47.248]  Also, there isn't prison crowding.
[01:10:47.268 --> 01:10:54.172]  What they'll do is zoom in on a few county jails that are overcrowded as the processing centers for the giant prisons everywhere.
[01:10:54.192 --> 01:10:56.434]  There's only a few jails.
[01:10:57.657 --> 01:11:02.920]  And law enforcement centers compared to the processing centers compared to all the warehouses, the prisons.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.582]  And the average person out there goes, good, make them criminals work.
[01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.763]  You know, take their cable TV and their hot tubs away.
[01:11:09.163 --> 01:11:10.864]  They don't have cable TV and hot tubs, folks.
[01:11:11.624 --> 01:11:12.765]  And make them work.
[01:11:12.805 --> 01:11:16.046]  Yeah, competing against you for an average of 20 cents an hour.
[01:11:16.827 --> 01:11:17.487]  Millions of them.
[01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.428]  Again, you've got to think things through here.
[01:11:20.387 --> 01:11:24.048]  Make them criminals work, and pay their way!
[01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:25.808]  They don't pay their way.
[01:11:25.888 --> 01:11:26.829]  You pay for it.
[01:11:27.209 --> 01:11:34.671]  Then a private industry gets to build a factory next door, and make nothing but pure profits for themselves, displacing law-abiding citizens!
[01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:37.491]  Alright, now I'm... Now I'm ranting.
[01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:47.954]  But, uh... There's so much other news here I want to get to, but let's just... I'm gonna go to your... Folks, I'm giving each caller no more than 90 seconds, because I gotta get to everybody here.
[01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:50.851]  Helga's back from Deutschland!
[01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:53.412]  Helga, welcome from Germany!
[01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:54.932]  Is this the Helga I know?
[01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:57.893]  Yes, yes, yes, but I'm in Germany.
[01:11:57.973 --> 01:12:02.955]  I'm calling you because... anyway, I'm so sorry.
[01:12:02.975 --> 01:12:03.836]  Germany calling!
[01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:05.716]  Germany calling!
[01:12:06.237 --> 01:12:08.878]  I can listen to you anytime I want to.
[01:12:09.518 --> 01:12:10.458]  And I do a lot.
[01:12:10.538 --> 01:12:11.839]  My phone bill is over $100.
[01:12:13.217 --> 01:12:25.245]  But anyway, what I heard today on the army station that comes from Heidelberg is that the Pope is in three coffins, right?
[01:12:25.325 --> 01:12:35.632]  The first one, the second one, now that's what they said on the radio, is made out of lead and has a skull and bone sign on it.
[01:12:36.172 --> 01:12:39.214]  Excuse me, now I misunderstood what you said.
[01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.456]  What exactly did the radio report?
[01:12:42.222 --> 01:12:48.384]  The radio reported that the Pope is going to be in three different coffins.
[01:12:48.584 --> 01:13:03.750]  You know, the one he's being shown, the second one is lead, even though I saw in some newspaper today that it's zinc, but anyway, they said it's lead, and there is a skull and bone on it.
[01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:06.091]  That's what they said, skull and bone.
[01:13:07.805 --> 01:13:09.566]  That is incredible.
[01:13:09.606 --> 01:13:12.207]  Yeah, I knew he was going to be in three sarcophagus.
[01:13:12.607 --> 01:13:13.628]  Sarcophagi.
[01:13:13.648 --> 01:13:17.029]  I guess would be the plural, I'm imagining.
[01:13:17.529 --> 01:13:19.070]  But skull and bone.
[01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:25.133]  You know, if you have any way of researching it, that's what they said on the radio.
[01:13:25.233 --> 01:13:27.654]  It's the army station that comes from Heidelberg.
[01:13:28.474 --> 01:13:30.515]  And that's what they said.
[01:13:31.956 --> 01:13:34.157]  Why would you have that symbol of death?
[01:13:35.967 --> 01:13:36.868]  On your coffin?
[01:13:37.168 --> 01:13:39.649]  You know, I mean, the Holy See, right?
[01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:41.511]  Skull and Bones, the Pirates.
[01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:58.740]  It would be the, you know, it's all... Well, my new film details, Helga, how that's really the group that runs all the major organizations, is this Worldwide Brotherhood, or Order of Death.
[01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.762]  And we know about Skull and Bones, uses the same name.
[01:14:01.782 --> 01:14:03.283]  And then I saw all those
[01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:11.017]  I'm so glad to talk to you, and as I say, I listen to you almost daily.
[01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:13.819]  How do you like being back in your homeland?
[01:14:30.837 --> 01:14:32.038]  Uh, let's see.
[01:14:32.238 --> 01:14:37.023]  It looks a little different color, but we have practically the same thing passing.
[01:14:37.063 --> 01:14:39.425]  You know, passports, toll roads.
[01:14:41.768 --> 01:14:45.870]  We are now being frightened with fine dust.
[01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:47.511]  That's the newest thing.
[01:14:47.991 --> 01:15:03.739]  And that's why, you know, there shouldn't be so many cars, and they have to pay for a special filter, and they shouldn't be using their cars, and we have to extend the... what is this called?
[01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:04.800]  How do you translate it?
[01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:12.375]  You know, the zone where you can only walk in the cities, we have that already, but it should be extended.
[01:15:14.453 --> 01:15:20.137]  Politics are, I mean, it's so stagnant here that it's like a kindergarten.
[01:15:20.237 --> 01:15:22.099]  They just fight with each other.
[01:15:22.219 --> 01:15:30.045]  In the meantime, they have passed the most horrendous thing, which is a law, and it's called Hart 4.
[01:15:30.545 --> 01:15:35.149]  And that means if you want to collect unemployment,
[01:15:36.209 --> 01:15:39.171]  You have to take any job, any job.
[01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:42.954]  I was going to bring that up, where they told the 25 year old woman.
[01:15:43.014 --> 01:15:47.858]  Yeah, and when I heard this, I actually heard this also, I heard this also on Ms.
[01:15:47.898 --> 01:15:51.461]  Heidelberg, and I heard it from you too.
[01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:57.145]  And I told this to the people here, and they said, they weren't surprised.
[01:15:57.225 --> 01:15:58.686]  I said, that must be a joke.
[01:15:58.907 --> 01:16:01.268]  They said, no, that's probably not a joke.
[01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.070]  No, they told her, they told her,
[01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:06.223]  She said, I'll take a job bussing tables.
[01:16:06.323 --> 01:16:08.965]  And she has a software computer engineering degree.
[01:16:09.246 --> 01:16:12.469]  And they said, you've got the pimp called.
[01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:15.873]  And then they said, you've got to take the job or we take you off your unemployment.
[01:16:15.893 --> 01:16:18.295]  You've got to go service ten men a day.
[01:16:18.315 --> 01:16:22.459]  I met a poor man in front of some building.
[01:16:23.652 --> 01:16:25.373]  You know, where you look for work.
[01:16:25.453 --> 01:16:28.035]  I don't know exactly what it's called right now in English.
[01:16:28.095 --> 01:16:31.056]  But anyway, he was almost in tears.
[01:16:31.096 --> 01:16:35.559]  He said that he had been working construction all his life.
[01:16:36.439 --> 01:16:39.601]  And now he has this work in an office.
[01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:43.523]  And he said, you know, I don't know how to spell.
[01:16:43.543 --> 01:16:46.885]  And I said, did you say it?
[01:16:46.925 --> 01:16:47.846]  Did you tell him that?
[01:16:48.564 --> 01:16:50.867]  And he said, no, I didn't dare to tell him.
[01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.028]  I was ashamed.
[01:16:52.569 --> 01:16:53.911]  What did they do?
[01:16:54.552 --> 01:16:58.276]  Pass laws with more regulations on who could be a construction worker?
[01:16:59.418 --> 01:17:00.038]  No, no, no.
[01:17:00.138 --> 01:17:04.504]  He was a construction worker and he got put into an office.
[01:17:05.103 --> 01:17:16.351]  No, they're just, uh, now with this new law, they can practically also branch out from so-called social jobs, which would be hospital, kitchen, and so on, you know, etc.
[01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:33.182]  They can now use that for, who knows, you know, maybe you can open up a factory here and get one euro, they get paid one euro, they have to, they get paid their rent, but it has to be a certain measurement of apartment.
[01:17:33.242 --> 01:17:34.763]  If it's too big, they have to move.
[01:17:35.644 --> 01:17:40.768]  Then they're paid, you know, electric and all those, even telephone.
[01:17:41.108 --> 01:17:51.517]  But only if they don't make too many phone calls, if they don't take, you know, too much electricity, and if they don't have too much of a heat bill.
[01:17:52.157 --> 01:17:56.161]  So it's a total control program.
[01:17:56.261 --> 01:18:00.084]  And I said, why in hell would anybody want to accept this?
[01:18:01.263 --> 01:18:06.747]  But, you know, we have then the people come from Russia, the people come from the Ukraine.
[01:18:07.368 --> 01:18:08.969]  We have Turks here.
[01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:10.850]  It's amazing.
[01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:12.331]  The city is full of it.
[01:18:13.592 --> 01:18:16.554]  And, you know, it's pretty much the same.
[01:18:16.694 --> 01:18:19.837]  It's a little different color, but it's pretty much the same.
[01:18:19.937 --> 01:18:26.902]  And when I saw that today in Rome, I said, you know, the New World Order is everywhere just the same.
[01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:32.426]  I don't even know what to say about it.
[01:18:32.606 --> 01:18:34.728]  Well, Helga, it was a pleasure hearing from you.
[01:18:34.748 --> 01:18:36.130]  I miss seeing you at different events.
[01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:37.792]  I'll be back in August.
[01:18:38.432 --> 01:18:38.813]  All right.
[01:18:38.853 --> 01:18:40.074]  Well, I hope to see you then.
[01:18:41.256 --> 01:18:41.996]  Thank you, Helga.
[01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:42.497]  Take care.
[01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:45.300]  I kept her a little bit longer, but it's an old friend.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.463]  We'll come back and stretch your calls on the other side of this break.
[01:18:48.483 --> 01:18:48.844]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:59.744]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.204 --> 01:19:07.986]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:16.168]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.488 --> 01:19:21.252]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.592 --> 01:19:26.276]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:26.817 --> 01:19:30.660]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.181]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:19:48.532 --> 01:19:51.653]  Terrorism!
[01:19:51.733 --> 01:19:54.493]  Terrorism!
[01:19:54.573 --> 01:19:55.434]  Chemical attacks!
[01:19:55.474 --> 01:19:56.154]  Dirty bombs!
[01:19:56.234 --> 01:19:56.674]  Fallout!
[01:19:56.734 --> 01:19:57.754]  Biological attacks!
[01:19:57.914 --> 01:19:58.474]  Anthrax!
[01:19:58.534 --> 01:20:00.675]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:02.495]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:20:02.735 --> 01:20:05.196]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:05.596 --> 01:20:20.144]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:20:55.133 --> 01:21:04.397]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:05.378 --> 01:21:10.300]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.201]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:14.362]  There may be more.
[01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:22.355]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[01:21:57.604 --> 01:22:05.169]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented PainX 2000 to the public.
[01:22:05.269 --> 01:22:13.434]  The PainX 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs, now is available to you.

[01:23:06.018 --> 01:23:07.420]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:13.845]  Let's continue with your phone calls, and there's a big news blitz coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:15.822 --> 01:23:22.503]  Let's go ahead and go next to... I guess it would be Will in Virginia, then Joan and others.
[01:23:22.563 --> 01:23:23.164]  Will, welcome.
[01:23:23.904 --> 01:23:24.344]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:24.784 --> 01:23:27.424]  I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for the cause of liberty.
[01:23:28.665 --> 01:23:30.145]  I recommend your films to everybody.
[01:23:30.165 --> 01:23:30.685]  I've got them.
[01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:31.385]  I copped them.
[01:23:31.445 --> 01:23:32.565]  I got your new one on order.
[01:23:33.506 --> 01:23:45.028]  I just wanted to mention a favorite phrase of a friend of mine who says that the biggest scam our government has pulled on us is to make us think that they are incompetent.
[01:23:46.627 --> 01:23:47.368]  No, I agree.
[01:23:47.388 --> 01:23:48.428]  Oh, they're idiots.
[01:23:48.488 --> 01:23:49.589]  They're buffoons.
[01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:50.630]  They're nincompoops.
[01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:51.951]  That's the New York Times.
[01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:53.692]  Oh, they just don't know what they're doing.
[01:23:53.732 --> 01:23:57.374]  No, they ordered the CIA to lie and put out false reports.
[01:23:57.675 --> 01:23:58.375]  That's admitted.
[01:23:58.395 --> 01:24:01.878]  Then Bush gets up on the stand and goes, how dare the CIA!
[01:24:01.938 --> 01:24:02.758]  You're bad!
[01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.179]  You lied to me!
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.401]  And then they turn around and give them awards.
[01:24:07.802 --> 01:24:08.322]  And promote them.
[01:24:09.283 --> 01:24:09.463]  Yep.
[01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:11.384]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:24:11.844 --> 01:24:12.445]  We're dumb, I think.
[01:24:13.911 --> 01:24:16.773]  Yeah, people aren't even so much dumb as they're just not focused.
[01:24:16.793 --> 01:24:18.735]  You know, they're not looking around them.
[01:24:18.755 --> 01:24:20.897]  They're just thinking about themselves.
[01:24:20.937 --> 01:24:32.607]  Well, if you really think about yourself and care about yourself, folks, you'll get informed because you're being psychologically, physically in many cases, economically, spiritually raped.
[01:24:33.081 --> 01:24:33.782]  By the Globalist.
[01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:34.282]  Anything else?
[01:24:34.642 --> 01:24:35.923]  No, that's all.
[01:24:36.084 --> 01:24:36.784]  Thanks for being there.
[01:24:37.024 --> 01:24:37.885]  Thank you for calling.
[01:24:37.905 --> 01:24:38.786]  Thank you for being there.
[01:24:38.906 --> 01:24:41.268]  Joan in Florida.
[01:24:41.308 --> 01:24:42.029]  Welcome, Joan.
[01:24:42.049 --> 01:24:43.490]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:44.591]  Two things real quick.
[01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:56.441]  One, when Helga just called in, on the radio, I heard a list of a few items that would be buried with the Pope, and one of them was stolen bones.
[01:24:57.441 --> 01:24:58.322]  They actually said that.
[01:24:58.482 --> 01:24:59.243]  Only heard it once.
[01:25:00.393 --> 01:25:02.794]  So, Helga's definitely probably right.
[01:25:03.174 --> 01:25:09.997]  Well, the most powerful elite secret society on Earth that is behind every group we look at is this Order of Death group.
[01:25:10.517 --> 01:25:12.018]  That's what I detail in the new film.
[01:25:12.058 --> 01:25:14.158]  Folks, I've done years of study on this.
[01:25:14.178 --> 01:25:17.580]  This has the... We know what they're doing.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:25.763]  Okay, uh, the other thing was, I was watching, uh, I Miss in the Morning, and he had a fellow on, David Kirby.
[01:25:26.203 --> 01:25:28.244]  He's written a book, Evidence of Harm.
[01:25:28.948 --> 01:25:33.651]  Mercury in Vaccines and Autism Epidemic in a Medical Controversy.
[01:25:33.811 --> 01:25:36.373]  Excellent, uh, excellent interview.
[01:25:36.393 --> 01:25:37.434]  I got the book.
[01:25:37.494 --> 01:25:38.694]  I just got it the other day.
[01:25:38.714 --> 01:25:46.039]  Uh, he's been a contributor to the New York Times for eight years where he writes articles about science and health.
[01:25:46.119 --> 01:25:49.081]  What is the spin that they didn't mean it accidentally?
[01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:49.942]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:25:50.142 --> 01:25:50.942]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:51.623 --> 01:25:54.004]  For closed meetings of the FDA, CDC,
[01:25:55.518 --> 01:26:01.463]  And drug companies to the mysterious writer inside the 2002 Homeland Security Bill.
[01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:11.930]  Oh, so out of the gates it mentions the 2000 meeting where the FDA, and we've read this, this has been on ABC News, we have the documents though, I wouldn't give this to my own grandson!
[01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:12.751]  This is deadly!
[01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:13.992]  Millions have been damaged!
[01:26:14.152 --> 01:26:15.433]  We gotta cover this up!
[01:26:15.954 --> 01:26:17.495]  Well, anyhow, no, this is, uh,
[01:26:18.277 --> 01:26:19.957]  Definitely an excellent book.
[01:26:20.137 --> 01:26:20.958]  It's quite lengthy.
[01:26:20.978 --> 01:26:23.318]  Well, yeah, you just mentioned that it talks about the secret meeting.
[01:26:23.338 --> 01:26:23.618]  Yeah.
[01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:41.882]  They know, by the way, Joan, as you know, they took it out of most of the vaccines, but with the flu shots and a few of the others that they give children and others, they more than quadrupled it to 250 times safe levels per injection!
[01:26:41.902 --> 01:26:42.462]  That's right.
[01:26:42.482 --> 01:26:44.603]  There's no reason to increase it to that level.
[01:26:44.623 --> 01:26:45.083]  That's right.
[01:26:46.884 --> 01:26:51.486]  It's well documented, plus it also helps people go to websites.
[01:26:51.726 --> 01:26:52.426]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:26:54.147 --> 01:26:54.987]  Here's the deal, Joan.
[01:26:55.407 --> 01:27:05.431]  Why, if they didn't even need that much thimerosal as a preservative, why would they then radically increase it when they are being sued over this?
[01:27:06.171 --> 01:27:07.671]  I know, it's just terrible.
[01:27:08.112 --> 01:27:14.894]  And here in Tampa, we have the, oh help me, the Cancer Center, Moffitt,
[01:27:15.495 --> 01:27:17.076]  The other day it came out on the news.
[01:27:17.236 --> 01:27:19.778]  It only hit the news twice.
[01:27:19.878 --> 01:27:25.002]  150 times the amount of radiation was given to 70 people.
[01:27:25.843 --> 01:27:29.525]  And they found all but 12 of them or something.
[01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:30.826]  Is this part of a test?
[01:27:31.307 --> 01:27:31.627]  No.
[01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:38.352]  People were going in there for radiation treatment and somebody set the machine improperly.
[01:27:39.019 --> 01:27:43.361]  Oh yeah, you got there, in that area of Florida, they got one of what, five machines?
[01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:48.743]  That huge mega thing that looks like a big ol' 1950s rendition of a laser beam?
[01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:49.123]  Mm-hmm.
[01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:51.544]  One of that big giant machine that's like three floors?
[01:27:52.264 --> 01:27:54.685]  And it just aims one little... I forget the name of it.
[01:27:54.745 --> 01:28:01.067]  I know that... Well, anyhow, it administers the radiation treatment, and it was 150 times the amount of exposure.
[01:28:01.647 --> 01:28:07.710]  Then a couple hours later, on the news, it came back on and said, oh no, it was only 50 times the amount.
[01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:07.930]  Whoa!
[01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:08.310]  No problem.
[01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:12.213]  And a few of the people did die, but they were going to die anyhow.
[01:28:12.934 --> 01:28:14.155]  Thank you for the call, my dear.
[01:28:14.896 --> 01:28:17.059]  I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't a government op.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.126]  I mean, in the 1950s, they would take the pregnant wives of G.I.s and tell them, Abby, don't feel well, honey.
[01:28:23.146 --> 01:28:24.207]  You come in here to the clinic.
[01:28:24.487 --> 01:28:25.949]  They'd have film cameras ready.
[01:28:26.509 --> 01:28:29.413]  They'd give the woman uranium and plutonium pills as vitamins.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.221]  Let me just... We're gonna kill your baby, honey.
[01:28:32.801 --> 01:28:33.681]  She'd take the pills.
[01:28:34.262 --> 01:28:37.123]  Day later, violent miscarriage, they'd be there running film cameras.
[01:28:37.183 --> 01:28:40.124]  I mean, folks, this is Joseph Mingala stuff.
[01:28:40.564 --> 01:28:41.624]  Just some innocent woman.
[01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:44.826]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.266 --> 01:28:46.886]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.787 --> 01:28:50.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:00.746 --> 01:29:10.795]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated... Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:29:11.535 --> 01:29:13.036]  With a 100% kill.

[01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:16.216 --> 01:32:21.717]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:21.757 --> 01:32:24.478]  Let me cover an important smattering
[01:32:25.945 --> 01:32:29.407]  Frankly, a cornucopia of news, and then I'll go back to the loaded phone lines here.
[01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:38.452]  On this Friday edition, now 34 minutes, well it's actually 33 seconds, 45 seconds into this hour.
[01:32:39.432 --> 01:32:42.234]  Now here, well into the bottom of the hour.
[01:32:43.034 --> 01:32:45.115]  Let me just try to answer a couple questions first.
[01:32:47.056 --> 01:32:47.957]  Important questions.
[01:32:49.818 --> 01:32:52.299]  A caller early in the last hour
[01:32:54.253 --> 01:33:19.735]  Ask me, Alex I've got a 13 and a 15 year old that's two different sons and they're getting a little bit rebellious and I'm divorced and they live with their mother but they know about 9-11 and I've shown them your film some of your films and I'm trying to explain to them that the counterculture that they're slipping into is not rebellious is not counterculture and that it's controlled
[01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:23.217]  And I could talk for hours about this.
[01:33:23.237 --> 01:33:25.318]  This is such an important subject.
[01:33:27.539 --> 01:33:39.226]  And there's so many people I could speak to on this, you know, to the parents, just from my study of the New World Order, to the young men, the young women out there as well.
[01:33:41.987 --> 01:33:44.108]  But first off, I want to say this to the young men.
[01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.912]  Genetically, in your coding, the way God designed you,
[01:33:52.054 --> 01:34:18.460]  You were meant after you enter into puberty and testosterone starts pumping through your veins to become more aggressive and instinctively you will want to rebel, you will want to basically start down a road that causes you to leave your hut or to leave your nest, to leave the cave
[01:34:21.092 --> 01:34:42.429]  In our more natural times, around 13 or 14, you usually left the hut and went and built your own bachelor's hut, and then began hunting parties on your own, began courting around 15, generally, other females from the tribe.
[01:34:46.474 --> 01:34:48.815]  Being involved in going on raiding parties.
[01:34:49.415 --> 01:34:50.516]  It's all sociology.
[01:34:51.596 --> 01:34:52.717]  And that's what the globalists study.
[01:34:52.737 --> 01:34:53.697]  And they target you.
[01:34:53.717 --> 01:34:57.399]  They know what you're going through right now at this key time.
[01:34:58.419 --> 01:35:05.262]  And back when this country was better, we tried to channel it through things like sports, ritualized combat, ritualized hunting.
[01:35:06.943 --> 01:35:11.765]  Now that's become perverted and turned into basically a way of life and a cult.
[01:35:12.305 --> 01:35:13.546]  But there is a place for it.
[01:35:14.172 --> 01:35:20.518]  You know, it's better than out fist fighting and guzzling beer and getting in fights at bonfires and carousing.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.782]  And they take that and they pervert it.
[01:35:24.842 --> 01:35:31.227]  They send army recruiters in when you're 14 years old to trick you when you're 16 to sign a commitment for when you're 18.
[01:35:31.287 --> 01:35:34.911]  And they tell you, don't you want to be a warrior?
[01:35:34.931 --> 01:35:35.691]  Don't you want to be tough?
[01:35:35.711 --> 01:35:36.932]  Well, your parents tell you not to.
[01:35:36.952 --> 01:35:38.434]  Well, you're going to be powerful.
[01:35:38.474 --> 01:35:39.975]  Why, you've seen the movies, haven't you?
[01:35:40.015 --> 01:35:40.756]  This is what they say.
[01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:42.870]  That's one way they trick you.
[01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:50.293]  And I'm not saying, you know, if the government said, we're going to have a state-by-state draft by the governor, who can, by the way, draft for emergencies.
[01:35:50.593 --> 01:35:51.754]  Oh yeah, that's constitutional.
[01:35:51.774 --> 01:35:52.394]  The feds can't.
[01:35:52.754 --> 01:35:55.755]  For the southern or northern border, I'd say go join it.
[01:35:55.835 --> 01:36:00.517]  But if you get into the military, they're going to inject you with experimental vaccines.
[01:36:00.577 --> 01:36:01.898]  It's a felony every time they do it.
[01:36:01.918 --> 01:36:02.978]  You're supposed to give them consent.
[01:36:03.678 --> 01:36:04.839]  And that's come out in federal courts.
[01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:05.519]  They still do it.
[01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:07.800]  They're going to use you as guinea pigs.
[01:36:08.943 --> 01:36:12.727]  They're going to have you breathe depleted uranium and then give you no treatment for it when you get sick.
[01:36:13.127 --> 01:36:15.890]  They're going to lie to you, and it's not in the fine print.
[01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:19.974]  Nebulous, in a nebulous fashion it is, but it's not clear.
[01:36:20.414 --> 01:36:25.939]  They'll keep you in for three tours in Iraq, when even in Vietnam you only had to serve one tour for 11 months.
[01:36:27.261 --> 01:36:31.064]  World War II, 22 missions, and you're B-17.
[01:36:36.718 --> 01:36:40.941]  I know my grandfather in the Air Corps in Italy, that's all he had to do.
[01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:47.465]  And then he was on the ground as a mechanic working on them.
[01:36:47.905 --> 01:36:53.169]  Every basic rule and contract with a soldier has been broken, so don't be fooled by that.
[01:36:53.249 --> 01:36:54.509]  That's a big threat.
[01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:56.010]  Crime!
[01:36:56.711 --> 01:36:58.252]  Hollywood plays up crime.
[01:36:58.632 --> 01:37:05.917]  Makes it look reckless and powerful and cool and gives you this archetypal, signet image of the drug dealer.
[01:37:07.315 --> 01:37:10.518]  In his Escalade Rowland.
[01:37:10.538 --> 01:37:22.991]  And one of the most powerful things Hollywood does is, in a tribal, natural situation, the intelligent, smart, strong male gets the best female.
[01:37:23.812 --> 01:37:25.614]  Or in many primitive cultures, females.
[01:37:28.155 --> 01:37:36.961]  And women went for men who were intelligent and dynamic and who were physical while at the same time intelligent.
[01:37:38.522 --> 01:37:48.088]  But after the 60's and the CIA set this up with Gloria Steinem and many others, Timothy Leary, it's all come out they were government agents.
[01:37:49.742 --> 01:38:17.360]  And then now today with a lot of the out-of-control hip-hop culture and the rock and roll culture and the rest of it, they show you these images of these movies, these teenage movies, you know, the beach movies, whatever, you know, the weekend party movies, where the guy that gets all the girls is stupid, he's shallow, but he dresses in whatever the fashion is, he's reckless, he gets in trouble a lot, his pants are hanging down around his knees, he's a moron.
[01:38:18.348 --> 01:38:19.748]  He makes jokes about everything.
[01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:24.609]  And so young males go out and try to simulate that.
[01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.290]  They think that's going to attain females.
[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:33.692]  And that's their subconscious drive, really just their coding, what they call the subconscious, just the hardware of the brain.
[01:38:35.352 --> 01:38:40.413]  And so they go out and simulate what they see in the movies and in the videos, on TV.
[01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:42.674]  And it doesn't happen.
[01:38:42.694 --> 01:38:43.714]  They don't get the female.
[01:38:45.425 --> 01:38:51.069]  Or the females aren't attracted to them and they get frustrated and they think, well I better act like more of an idiot.
[01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:53.230]  And then I'll get the females.
[01:38:55.452 --> 01:38:56.672]  And you still don't get the females.
[01:38:57.333 --> 01:38:58.774]  Let me tell you what the females want.
[01:38:58.894 --> 01:39:04.017]  Females want strong, intelligent men who can provide for them.
[01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:10.944]  Conversely, women are told, Hey, women, you're slaves of your men!
[01:39:11.465 --> 01:39:12.685]  You need to be running things.
[01:39:12.766 --> 01:39:14.507]  You need to have the professional job.
[01:39:14.627 --> 01:39:15.768]  You need to be on top.
[01:39:16.088 --> 01:39:17.249]  You need to have the power.
[01:39:18.309 --> 01:39:22.112]  Gloria Steinem admits she was a CIA officer, CIA-funded, Ms.
[01:39:22.152 --> 01:39:22.552]  Magazine.
[01:39:22.572 --> 01:39:23.833]  She even wrote this in one of her books.
[01:39:24.153 --> 01:39:25.694]  This is only one little piece, okay?
[01:39:25.714 --> 01:39:26.835]  I could go for hours on this.
[01:39:28.276 --> 01:39:35.801]  Because by design, the social architect said, the state can't get control of the family and the children because 80% of women aren't working.
[01:39:36.994 --> 01:39:39.557]  It was a low class thing.
[01:39:39.597 --> 01:39:45.522]  If a woman had to work, and boy if the man didn't work, we're talking about, that was really embarrassing.
[01:39:46.843 --> 01:39:50.727]  And if a woman had to go take a job, that was a sign the family wasn't doing so well.
[01:39:53.229 --> 01:40:00.336]  Now I'm not saying if a woman wants to fly airplanes and wants to be a CEO and wants to do all this, that they can do as good a job or better in some cases.
[01:40:00.696 --> 01:40:01.637]  The point is, is that
[01:40:02.362 --> 01:40:15.272]  Is that you don't have the culture pushing and driving and setting up a tax system and a school system and a quota system like they're doing in the Scandinavian countries where you gotta have 40% females at your business or they just shut it down.
[01:40:16.313 --> 01:40:18.634]  And then so something happened the last 25-30 years.
[01:40:18.674 --> 01:40:19.515]  These women went out.
[01:40:22.137 --> 01:40:23.538]  The men were emasculated.
[01:40:23.578 --> 01:40:25.139]  They picked up on the other propaganda.
[01:40:25.179 --> 01:40:29.623]  Didn't act like men, which drove the equation of women not liking men.
[01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:34.891]  And then women went out and got the jobs, and they're totally unhappy.
[01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:39.234]  After 35, their clock goes crazy.
[01:40:39.254 --> 01:40:41.235]  I mean, I know a lot of fertility doctors.
[01:40:41.275 --> 01:40:43.377]  I mean, they are turning patients away.
[01:40:43.417 --> 01:40:44.718]  These women are doing everything.
[01:40:44.818 --> 01:40:45.418]  Surgeries.
[01:40:45.859 --> 01:40:46.739]  Implantations.
[01:40:46.799 --> 01:40:47.720]  Give me a baby.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.663]  Implanting their eggs and their husband's sperm in other women.
[01:40:52.923 --> 01:40:55.045]  Paying hundreds of thousands, millions in some cases.
[01:40:55.285 --> 01:40:56.666]  They've got to have a baby!
[01:40:57.495 --> 01:40:58.796]  Because they're not fulfilled, folks.
[01:40:59.557 --> 01:41:02.579]  Men and women are one creature.
[01:41:03.039 --> 01:41:03.580]  Seriously.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.884]  The human species, Homo sapiens sapiens, is not a man and is not a woman.
[01:41:09.044 --> 01:41:10.405]  It is the union.
[01:41:11.526 --> 01:41:12.607]  That is the species.
[01:41:13.308 --> 01:41:14.669]  We are one creature.
[01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:15.309]  Did you know that?
[01:41:19.292 --> 01:41:21.214]  It is a symbiotic relationship.
[01:41:22.913 --> 01:41:27.537]  And a woman will tell you all day she wants to dominate you, but women are not happy.
[01:41:30.719 --> 01:41:32.240]  In fact, there's an aberration of this.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.962]  You know, women, there's an aberration.
[01:41:34.002 --> 01:41:36.303]  You know, the bad boy, the guy that's mean to them in school.
[01:41:37.204 --> 01:41:41.868]  You know, usually the best looking, hottest girl is going out with him.
[01:41:42.568 --> 01:41:43.849]  And usually they grow up and get out of it.
[01:41:43.869 --> 01:41:49.994]  You know, what a woman really wants is a strong man who takes care of them and empowers them and loves them and cherishes them.
[01:41:50.494 --> 01:41:51.615]  And women just love that.
[01:41:52.890 --> 01:41:55.832]  And that's what these 40-year-old women who've made a million bucks want.
[01:41:56.312 --> 01:41:57.612]  Man, they are going crazy.
[01:41:57.673 --> 01:41:58.373]  They want it.
[01:41:58.953 --> 01:42:02.715]  They just melt when they finally get it, if they're lucky enough.
[01:42:04.036 --> 01:42:05.336]  That's not how it's supposed to work.
[01:42:05.377 --> 01:42:06.397]  But it's not women's fault.
[01:42:06.637 --> 01:42:07.298]  It's not men's fault.
[01:42:07.338 --> 01:42:08.438]  It's the other side of the equation.
[01:42:08.678 --> 01:42:09.959]  The men are acting like idiots!
[01:42:11.065 --> 01:42:23.869]  Men think laying down and groveling to a cop and being a coward is cool, but they'll get mad at you if you look at them wrong in a gas station parking lot and stick their chest out as they waddle out with a case of beer to go watch the football game.
[01:42:24.209 --> 01:42:25.189]  Men aren't real men.
[01:42:25.409 --> 01:42:27.230]  They don't stand up for their family.
[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:28.010]  They don't have morals.
[01:42:28.050 --> 01:42:28.830]  They don't have honor.
[01:42:29.931 --> 01:42:31.831]  They're not politically involved.
[01:42:32.091 --> 01:42:36.813]  They think being a man is watching football games and being part of a simulated tribal war.
[01:42:41.653 --> 01:42:47.115]  And again, it's so complex, I could talk for hours about this subject, but here's other examples.
[01:42:47.676 --> 01:42:49.176]  Hollywood plays up drugs.
[01:42:49.276 --> 01:42:50.037]  Drugs are cool.
[01:42:50.137 --> 01:42:50.857]  Drugs are fun.
[01:42:51.197 --> 01:42:51.938]  Drugs are neat.
[01:42:52.038 --> 01:42:53.398]  Drugs are what the rebels take.
[01:42:54.158 --> 01:42:57.160]  Cigarettes are what the rebels smoke.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:01.542]  Meanwhile, the propaganda is, but arrest anybody that's using these drugs.
[01:43:03.182 --> 01:43:04.103]  And they've done this in Europe.
[01:43:04.123 --> 01:43:08.825]  They put up billboards saying, smoking kills you, it's bad, stop it, and smoking doubled after the 10-year campaign.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.901]  It's artificial rebellion.
[01:43:13.922 --> 01:43:14.782]  Or resistance.
[01:43:16.163 --> 01:43:18.504]  And so they come out and they go, it's rebellious.
[01:43:19.745 --> 01:43:24.648]  You know, go have sex with your same sex.
[01:43:25.588 --> 01:43:26.329]  It's rebellious.
[01:43:26.829 --> 01:43:28.790]  You know, oh, it's the cool thing, I better do it.
[01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:30.911]  Oh my goodness.
[01:43:31.412 --> 01:43:38.756]  Or they tell you, you know, it's rebellious to not believe in God, and that's the really cool thing to do, because you know,
[01:43:39.736 --> 01:43:40.917]  And then people pick up on it.
[01:43:41.137 --> 01:43:44.640]  Or, you know, it's really cool to cuss at your teachers.
[01:43:45.181 --> 01:43:47.462]  And it's really cool to hang out in gangs.
[01:43:47.543 --> 01:43:50.025]  And it's really cool to sneak out your window.
[01:43:50.785 --> 01:43:52.547]  No, it's really cool.
[01:43:52.567 --> 01:43:55.369]  Let me just tell the young men this.
[01:43:55.789 --> 01:43:57.611]  You start dressing conservatively.
[01:43:58.431 --> 01:44:01.234]  You start being quiet.
[01:44:02.415 --> 01:44:07.399]  You start thinking about politics and science and society.
[01:44:08.306 --> 01:44:17.875]  And you go join the debating club, you'll have more women knocking on your door than you ever imagined.
[01:44:18.115 --> 01:44:21.519]  Again, you're not going to be a successful male acting like an idiot.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.181]  That is the opposite of what women want.
[01:44:25.883 --> 01:44:30.287]  Some young stupid women think that what the media is telling them is what they should go get and they're never happy with it.
[01:44:33.493 --> 01:44:35.915]  So again, it's all about setting up your own hut.
[01:44:36.175 --> 01:44:38.437]  And they've taken that and made it for you.
[01:44:39.178 --> 01:44:41.840]  We don't even have money in this society, in many cases, for you to do that.
[01:44:42.721 --> 01:44:43.702]  And let me tell you this.
[01:44:43.822 --> 01:44:46.624]  Every parent tells their child, Oh, I made all these mistakes.
[01:44:47.605 --> 01:44:48.526]  My parents told me.
[01:44:48.626 --> 01:44:51.848]  I didn't see they were right until I was older.
[01:44:52.789 --> 01:44:54.190]  They know you're going to develop.
[01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:56.212]  You're automatically insecure when you're young.
[01:44:56.232 --> 01:44:58.134]  You're automatically learning about the world.
[01:44:58.174 --> 01:45:00.636]  You're automatically questioning things.
[01:45:02.044 --> 01:45:03.425]  And you've just got to take your time.
[01:45:03.445 --> 01:45:04.446]  You've got to develop.
[01:45:04.526 --> 01:45:16.115]  I mean, as you mature, as you get older, and this is a lifelong process, as you become confident, it's such a wonderful thing.
[01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.137]  So, stay in school.
[01:45:19.717 --> 01:45:20.938]  Go to the gym after school.
[01:45:21.358 --> 01:45:22.119]  Get a job.
[01:45:22.179 --> 01:45:23.540]  Work until 10 o'clock at night.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.101]  Put money in the bank.
[01:45:28.063 --> 01:45:28.704]  Another thing is,
[01:45:29.938 --> 01:45:33.240]  Parents let their children hang out with bad influences.
[01:45:34.421 --> 01:45:43.987]  And a way to talk to your children, a way to really get through to them, and this is what I've seen with really successful families, this is what men are supposed to do.
[01:45:44.387 --> 01:45:47.449]  Men don't spend time with their son and take him to a baseball game.
[01:45:47.489 --> 01:45:48.250]  They do that too.
[01:45:48.810 --> 01:45:52.112]  But most of the time it's going for a hike with them when they're really little.
[01:45:52.873 --> 01:45:55.815]  And talking to them about the nature of the world and how the world really works.
[01:45:56.981 --> 01:46:05.312]  And explaining to them that getting involved in reckless things will destroy them and teach them about the dangers of the world.
[01:46:05.633 --> 01:46:08.917]  That's what a man does with his sons and daughters.
[01:46:10.319 --> 01:46:11.260]  He counsels them.
[01:46:11.761 --> 01:46:12.602]  Mothers do that.
[01:46:13.596 --> 01:46:23.363]  And you've got to give them some autonomy at the same time, but just explain the nature of the world to them.
[01:46:23.403 --> 01:46:26.766]  Don't tell them you're bad, you're in trouble, and then don't give them any information.
[01:46:27.446 --> 01:46:36.012]  You've got to invest and spend time, and then encourage them when they have discussions with you, and when they learn new things, and when they become interested in history.
[01:46:39.515 --> 01:46:41.256]  And the most important thing you can do
[01:46:43.453 --> 01:46:47.476]  Because young people, again, it wasn't always this way.
[01:46:47.556 --> 01:46:56.843]  So many people did respect their parents, did believe in their parents, and there was that mutual respect, and those are the most successful people you see.
[01:46:56.863 --> 01:47:00.245]  You know, the astronauts, the top doctors, the scientists.
[01:47:01.046 --> 01:47:07.991]  I mean, my dad when he was 13, they trusted him so much, they'd let him get on a bus and go to Houston for the summer and work.
[01:47:09.682 --> 01:47:13.105]  Because my dad was so good and so respectful.
[01:47:13.125 --> 01:47:17.087]  But that's how people were back then.
[01:47:17.107 --> 01:47:23.132]  The young men would carry their rifles and shotguns and handguns right into school, put them in their locker to go shooting after class.
[01:47:23.152 --> 01:47:24.613]  My dad lived in a pretty big town.
[01:47:25.714 --> 01:47:26.854]  Big cities were like that.
[01:47:27.455 --> 01:47:30.117]  People were disciplined to a greater extent.
[01:47:30.837 --> 01:47:36.081]  And you see that discipline going out the window, but the discipline was giving the people value in the discipline.
[01:47:37.285 --> 01:47:38.866]  Showing them how it was strengthening them.
[01:47:38.886 --> 01:47:41.547]  But the most important point here, and there's hundreds.
[01:47:42.607 --> 01:47:44.848]  I thought I'd spend five minutes on this and look how much time I've already spent.
[01:47:46.388 --> 01:47:49.029]  The most important thing is you've got to sit your children down.
[01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:53.091]  By the time they're about ten years old and explain to them.
[01:47:53.871 --> 01:47:55.131]  The history of the Republic.
[01:47:55.631 --> 01:47:56.852]  The dark times that came.
[01:47:57.352 --> 01:48:00.313]  Explain to them how the system's gone bad.
[01:48:01.013 --> 01:48:05.735]  Explain to them how the media is there wanting to get them caught in their clutches.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:23.788]  That they're sold these vices so they can become institutionalized and that the government wants them to be rebellious so that they can capture them and put them in the juvenile hall, put them on welfare, put them on Prozac.
[01:48:26.569 --> 01:48:32.872]  And I think the most important thing is not letting them watch television and teaching them about television.
[01:48:33.552 --> 01:48:36.674]  And I think the most important thing is very young putting them in sports
[01:48:38.067 --> 01:48:47.431]  And on the swim team, and again, having a garden, taking your children to the park every day.
[01:48:47.451 --> 01:48:53.694]  No matter, no matter if you as an adult, and this is what mammals have always done, and even crocodiles do it.
[01:48:54.366 --> 01:49:04.671]  If you have to work yourself to death to provide for those children, so one of the parents can stay home to protect them, protect the nest, especially when they're a little bitty, then you have to do it.
[01:49:04.691 --> 01:49:08.753]  That means men, if you have to work 18 hours a day to provide,
[01:49:09.895 --> 01:49:12.136]  I don't mean $100 shoes and big screen TVs.
[01:49:12.176 --> 01:49:15.076]  I mean to provide good private school education or homeschooling.
[01:49:15.456 --> 01:49:19.137]  I mean to provide them with everything they need.
[01:49:19.237 --> 01:49:23.719]  Men, you are to kill yourselves working for your family if need be.
[01:49:23.899 --> 01:49:26.379]  I mean you are to... Let's figure it out, folks.
[01:49:26.879 --> 01:49:28.400]  You are to do everything.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.620]  That is your job.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.121]  Not spending $500 on Super Bowl tickets.
[01:49:38.524 --> 01:49:43.311]  That's what you're supposed to do, and if you follow God's law and the code that God gave us, it's just our genetics.
[01:49:44.193 --> 01:49:49.801]  If you do that, you will be empowered, you will be happy, and your children will turn out good.
[01:49:50.402 --> 01:49:51.444]  If not, they'll be destroyed.
[01:49:53.627 --> 01:49:57.949]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.129 --> 01:50:02.571]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.691 --> 01:50:07.092]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.112 --> 01:50:08.473]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.273 --> 01:50:09.613]  Panama!
[01:50:09.814 --> 01:50:10.614]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:38.933 --> 01:50:39.894]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.234 --> 01:50:58.477]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.617 --> 01:51:06.700]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.961 --> 01:51:14.004]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.204 --> 01:51:15.465]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:15.545 --> 01:51:21.448]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.648 --> 01:51:26.731]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.832 --> 01:51:35.717]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:35.977 --> 01:51:39.279]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:59.326 --> 01:53:02.967]  There's a few other points I have to add to what I was just saying about family.
[01:53:04.928 --> 01:53:08.789]  This is what the philosophers said as well, the founding fathers.
[01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:11.229]  This has been figured out, okay?
[01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:15.911]  Another thing is, look, they know you're going to be rebellious after puberty.
[01:53:16.531 --> 01:53:17.131]  Men and women.
[01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:24.333]  And so the globalists are very good at manipulating those feelings and misdirecting you
[01:53:25.249 --> 01:53:31.153]  Uh, into unnatural avenues to destroy you, to get you into their clutches, to make you dependent on the state.
[01:53:32.774 --> 01:53:37.737]  I mean, are we surprised that the average young person in this country watches four and a half hours of TV a day?
[01:53:38.457 --> 01:53:40.079]  The average adult, three and a half hours?
[01:53:40.099 --> 01:53:48.404]  I mean, the television is raising your children, teaching them how men behave, how women are supposed to behave, and we wonder why we have so many problems?
[01:53:49.725 --> 01:53:53.327]  You get out of a computer what you put into it, and that's what our brains are.
[01:53:56.816 --> 01:54:01.739]  And, um, described by a scientist as a computer that a spirit controls.
[01:54:01.799 --> 01:54:02.540]  And that's your soul.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.961]  There's something else there.
[01:54:05.582 --> 01:54:09.684]  And, folks, there's nothing more precious than your children.
[01:54:10.585 --> 01:54:16.909]  A byproduct of this self-centered society is that people, you know, they don't care about their children as much as they should.
[01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:20.591]  And the children don't care about them when they're old and euthanize them.
[01:54:22.202 --> 01:54:22.783]  We're in trouble.
[01:54:22.903 --> 01:54:24.524]  The family is unraveling all around us.
[01:54:24.584 --> 01:54:26.786]  Illegitimacy is exploding in every racial group.
[01:54:27.927 --> 01:54:28.828]  I see it around me.
[01:54:29.468 --> 01:54:30.309]  It is an implosion.
[01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:37.515]  And the children see the people at school who are cool because they follow the TV's model of how you should look and how you should dress and how you should act.
[01:54:39.097 --> 01:54:42.480]  And then your poor children feel inadequate and pathetic.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.282]  And that's what Madison Avenue wants so then they'll go buy their products.
[01:54:47.244 --> 01:54:49.806]  But I assure you, you start doing things your way and
[01:54:50.777 --> 01:54:52.658]  Being clean-cut and strong and focused.
[01:54:52.779 --> 01:54:58.022]  And when you really stop caring, stop caring in people so much about the quote, cool people.
[01:54:58.683 --> 01:55:02.346]  Most of them are desperately unhappy, sad individuals.
[01:55:02.426 --> 01:55:08.610]  You need to be strong and worry about being strong and then you will be strong and then people will like you.
[01:55:10.051 --> 01:55:11.492]  It isn't about putting on a front.
[01:55:11.633 --> 01:55:14.935]  It isn't about behaving in a way.
[01:55:16.036 --> 01:55:17.037]  It's about being.
[01:55:18.498 --> 01:55:19.919]  And I think that starts with
[01:55:21.569 --> 01:55:27.354]  And let me tell you, if you're around teenagers, young people, and they're being mean to you, don't go along with it.
[01:55:27.374 --> 01:55:28.715]  Stop hanging around with those people.
[01:55:30.096 --> 01:55:31.677]  Go hang out with the nerds!
[01:55:33.038 --> 01:55:37.642]  Or, you know, go hang out with people you'd never think were quote, cool.
[01:55:38.062 --> 01:55:40.464]  Because those are the people that are going to be successful.
[01:55:43.046 --> 01:55:44.027]  You see that so much.
[01:55:45.528 --> 01:55:50.892]  The people that aren't successful socially in high school become successful later in life.
[01:55:51.639 --> 01:55:54.742]  I was so wild that I didn't even care about being successful.
[01:55:54.922 --> 01:55:57.604]  And that's why I was, quote, successful in that little petty world.
[01:55:58.145 --> 01:56:02.409]  And so many people go to their school reunions and live in the past and are obsessed with it.
[01:56:02.729 --> 01:56:03.690]  People that were cool.
[01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:05.551]  I mean, that's really sick, folks.
[01:56:05.611 --> 01:56:08.034]  The rest of your life comes after high school.
[01:56:08.054 --> 01:56:10.596]  You know, it isn't high school.
[01:56:11.697 --> 01:56:16.341]  And so that's my message to young people and it's an important message and I've made these observations over the years.
[01:56:17.384 --> 01:56:24.226]  And so just do what your daddy tells you and be strong and know that your parents love you so much it tears their heart out.
[01:56:25.627 --> 01:56:28.868]  It's just the love that a parent has for their children.
[01:56:30.028 --> 01:56:33.829]  It is unlike anything that you could ever imagine as being a child.
[01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:36.190]  It's much stronger.
[01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:39.851]  I think parents love their children a lot more than the children love them.
[01:56:41.212 --> 01:56:42.232]  Especially when they get older.
[01:56:42.372 --> 01:56:44.573]  And then later you'll love your parents as much as they love you.
[01:56:45.783 --> 01:56:46.805]  Alright, that's enough preaching.
[01:56:46.845 --> 01:56:51.294]  We'll go straight to your calls in the next hour, then I'll get into the Masons and all this other news.
[01:56:51.314 --> 01:56:54.099]  People being arrested for trying to use $2 bills to buy things.
[01:56:54.901 --> 01:56:56.444]  People are so insane and dumbed down.
[01:56:57.423 --> 01:57:01.966]  Before we end this hour, Marshall Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State is now out on DVD.
[01:57:01.986 --> 01:57:03.808]  It won't be seen if you don't get it and make copies.
[01:57:03.868 --> 01:57:05.089]  Please help me get this out to people.
[01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:06.069]  It's my best film.
[01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:07.631]  It's an incredible 9-11 video.
[01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:10.193]  It also covers the police state, the occult elite.
[01:57:10.593 --> 01:57:11.494]  Full tool, free to order.

[01:57:34.961 --> 01:57:36.021]  PresentPlanet.TV.
[01:57:36.741 --> 01:57:44.623]  Third Hour totally jam-packed continues as we defend freedom.
[01:57:50.224 --> 01:57:50.804]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.523 --> 01:57:52.544]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.284 --> 01:57:54.385]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.025 --> 01:57:55.846]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.626 --> 01:57:57.527]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.167 --> 01:58:01.890]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:06.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:11.723]  Hour number three now being cracked open afresh anew.
[01:58:11.763 --> 01:58:17.386]  We still have so many freedoms and so many beautiful, wonderful things in this country.
[01:58:17.886 --> 01:58:24.209]  The evil New World Order can be resisted if you'll simply listen to the clarion call and stand up against it and do the good work.
[01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:32.413]  Your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231 and then I'll get into just so much news.
[01:58:32.433 --> 01:58:34.714]  People being arrested for using two dollar bills.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.164]  First of all, it is an honor to speak with you.
[01:58:39.184 --> 01:58:40.665]  You're great, and it was another great show today.
[01:58:40.685 --> 01:58:43.288]  I hope a lot of parents out there heard what you just said.
[01:58:57.771 --> 01:59:00.392]  I'm just going to touch on some of the stuff that you've been talking about.
[01:59:00.412 --> 01:59:10.918]  You know, with Imus in the morning, what's very interesting, he was starting to expose how the inoculation seemed to be linked to SIDS and all these other childhood diseases.
[01:59:10.938 --> 01:59:12.499]  There is no seems to be linked.
[01:59:12.779 --> 01:59:18.562]  Yes, exactly, but from his approach, you see, which was a major step because he's so mainstream.
[01:59:19.283 --> 01:59:23.385]  And so it was very interesting to see him reveal this over the air.
[01:59:23.705 --> 01:59:26.126]  Now, here's the interesting thing.
[01:59:26.186 --> 01:59:27.067]  Shortly after that,
[01:59:27.745 --> 01:59:36.433]  Uh, Wall Street did an article on him trying to, um, about his ranch out there for the kids, cancer kids and stuff, so they, something was going after him.
[01:59:36.893 --> 01:59:43.559]  Well, I've noticed suddenly this week, people, just from what I've heard, heard in a restaurant, people talking, heard on radio,
[01:59:44.299 --> 01:59:50.442]  Suddenly he's being attacked, probably because he's got a conscience and they're worried he's about to turn.
[01:59:51.082 --> 01:59:51.743]  I believe that.
[01:59:52.023 --> 01:59:54.704]  It's got to be the case, as we well know from experience.
[01:59:55.344 --> 02:00:05.309]  Another thing I want to, with the masons and the symbols, people have to realize that masonry itself was not evil, as you've covered many times.
[02:00:05.749 --> 02:00:07.770]  And a lot of these symbols, per se, weren't evil.
[02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:17.733]  I mean, uh, secret books by Moses had these symbols in it, Solomon, and so, uh, what we're dealing with is essentially what God creates, the devils infiltrate.
[02:00:17.873 --> 02:00:19.514]  Counterfeit and perverse.
[02:00:19.634 --> 02:00:20.134]  That's right.
[02:00:20.434 --> 02:00:28.337]  So, for example, um, the Founding Fathers, Freemasons, and of course, George Washington, the greatest American still to this day.
[02:00:29.173 --> 02:00:31.375]  He was divinely protected numerous times.
[02:00:31.415 --> 02:00:34.917]  That's how we were able to defeat the largest empire in the world.
[02:00:35.417 --> 02:00:38.820]  And then, of course, all these supernatural things around the war.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:43.102]  The mysterious fogs oozing out of the ground on a midsummer's day.
[02:00:43.463 --> 02:00:44.984]  Stuff really did happen like that.
[02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:45.684]  That's right.
[02:00:46.244 --> 02:00:49.387]  And all these supernatural events.
[02:00:49.447 --> 02:00:53.970]  Now, ultimately, George establishes the first country without a king.
[02:00:54.570 --> 02:00:58.853]  Which was a major precedent because no other country in the history of the world as we know it
[02:00:59.934 --> 02:01:00.954]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:01.014 --> 02:01:11.322]  Greece had been established by kings and they had limited voting for landowners, males of a certain age, but that wasn't established as a new country like that.
[02:01:11.342 --> 02:01:11.702]  You're right.
[02:01:12.282 --> 02:01:18.227]  And the only country besides us was Israel in the very beginning where God said, you're my people, I'm your king.
[02:01:18.607 --> 02:01:20.268]  Then, of course, the people... You're right.
[02:01:20.288 --> 02:01:21.949]  It wasn't George Washington wasn't the first.
[02:01:22.029 --> 02:01:22.630]  It was Moses.
[02:01:23.266 --> 02:01:27.652]  Yep, and so we're the only other country established by God.
[02:01:28.213 --> 02:01:31.418]  Like the Founding Fathers believed, they were new Israelites.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:42.647]  And so, we, our king is Jesus, and we are all sovereigns because we have a good... Well, that was the battle cry in 1776, no king but King Jesus.
[02:01:43.227 --> 02:01:43.627]  See that?
[02:01:43.767 --> 02:01:44.248]  You see that?
[02:01:44.388 --> 02:01:52.192]  And so people have to realize, now what Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, for the violent try to seize it by force.
[02:01:52.533 --> 02:02:00.778]  He's referring to the black magicians, the evil ones who want the power, the kingdom of heaven, which is not a place, because he said the kingdom of heaven is within you,
[02:02:01.338 --> 02:02:02.279]  It's his power.
[02:02:02.359 --> 02:02:03.359]  No, they want your soul.
[02:02:03.399 --> 02:02:04.920]  They traffic in the souls of men.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:10.663]  Yes, that's right, but it's also a power that makes us divine beings, Alex, you see?
[02:02:11.003 --> 02:02:12.224]  No longer mere mortals.
[02:02:12.404 --> 02:02:16.626]  And so the evil ones, like, let's look at the Nazis in our most recent history.
[02:02:17.006 --> 02:02:20.368]  Well, we're made in the image of God, so we've got a spark of that.
[02:02:20.568 --> 02:02:22.849]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:23.489 --> 02:02:23.990]  I really do.
[02:02:24.650 --> 02:02:27.291]  And I'll take a few more calls and I'll comment on the Masons.
[02:02:29.964 --> 02:02:31.925]  But started his secret construction gills.
[02:02:32.925 --> 02:02:34.606]  And that's why they worship mathematics.
[02:02:35.467 --> 02:02:36.247]  We'll break it down.
[02:02:36.947 --> 02:02:38.968]  But it is certainly purely evil today.
[02:02:39.468 --> 02:02:39.949]  We'll be back.
[02:02:39.969 --> 02:02:40.369]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.911 --> 02:02:52.734]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:53.054 --> 02:02:54.434]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.614 --> 02:02:56.835]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.975 --> 02:02:59.076]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.336 --> 02:03:04.278]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.598 --> 02:03:08.640]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.662]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.742 --> 02:03:21.394]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.554 --> 02:03:23.417]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:04:22.947 --> 02:04:23.508]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.882 --> 02:04:51.427]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:51.547 --> 02:04:52.628]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:52.728 --> 02:04:53.608]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:53.729 --> 02:04:56.571]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.751 --> 02:05:01.655]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.675 --> 02:05:02.956]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:03.116 --> 02:05:04.257]  It's called No B.O.
[02:05:04.317 --> 02:05:06.019]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:06.379 --> 02:05:08.461]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[02:05:08.501 --> 02:05:10.062]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:05:10.282 --> 02:05:12.884]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:05:12.984 --> 02:05:17.807]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:05:18.087 --> 02:05:21.209]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:05:21.349 --> 02:05:26.753]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:05:26.833 --> 02:05:27.593]  Try No-B-O.
[02:05:27.714 --> 02:05:28.694]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:05:29.875 --> 02:05:32.758]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[02:05:50.301 --> 02:05:54.463]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:55.103 --> 02:05:55.964]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.704 --> 02:05:57.624]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.265 --> 02:06:01.966]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.447 --> 02:06:06.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.868 --> 02:06:12.831]  Alright, 8 minutes, 24 seconds into this third and final hour of worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[02:06:12.891 --> 02:06:15.032]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls for a few minutes.
[02:06:15.052 --> 02:06:19.354]  Then I want to answer the questions you've been getting about Mason's from my studying of it.
[02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.769]  I've got your video.
[02:06:20.789 --> 02:06:25.412]  I'm going to get the CD of the Martial Law and I can tell you it's a blockbuster.
[02:06:25.432 --> 02:06:25.912]  It's opening eyes.
[02:06:26.012 --> 02:06:26.552]  It's jaw-dropping.
[02:06:48.312 --> 02:06:50.153]  Uh, eye-popping, nervous breakdowner.
[02:06:50.213 --> 02:06:56.295]  I've had all kinds of reactions from people, but mostly it's people that are just waking up and absolutely freaking out.
[02:06:56.475 --> 02:07:00.056]  So you ordered the VHS when it was first available, because I didn't want to waste time.
[02:07:00.296 --> 02:07:00.536]  Yeah.
[02:07:00.596 --> 02:07:03.037]  I authored and got the DVD, which we now have.
[02:07:03.517 --> 02:07:06.698]  And, uh, so you've got the two-hour, 35-minute film.
[02:07:06.738 --> 02:07:07.718]  Give us your review of it.
[02:07:08.351 --> 02:07:13.273]  Well, I can practically project it through my eyeballs onto a wall because I've seen it so many times.
[02:07:13.333 --> 02:07:14.273]  I've made some copies.
[02:07:14.333 --> 02:07:20.355]  I feel bad when I make copies because I feel you should be getting those revenues, but as you say, it's more important to get the word out.
[02:07:20.395 --> 02:07:20.475]  No!
[02:07:20.495 --> 02:07:21.655]  No, I could care less!
[02:07:22.055 --> 02:07:23.896]  Well, I know that, but... That is not the goal!
[02:07:23.956 --> 02:07:24.676]  Make copies!
[02:07:24.936 --> 02:07:26.857]  I understand it, but it's...
[02:07:29.290 --> 02:07:30.250]  It was fantastic.
[02:07:30.311 --> 02:07:31.231]  I've seen all your movies.
[02:07:31.251 --> 02:07:32.351]  I've bought all your movies.
[02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:35.192]  I've bought several extra copies of your movies, given them away.
[02:07:35.752 --> 02:07:37.912]  And this one's a true blockbuster.
[02:07:37.952 --> 02:07:38.712]  People are waking up.
[02:07:38.772 --> 02:07:46.914]  I've had people sit there with their eyes glazed over, their jaws hanging open, and they're just absolutely flabbergasted.
[02:07:46.934 --> 02:07:49.475]  What about when I tell folks who actually did 9-11?
[02:07:52.423 --> 02:08:00.353]  Most of the people that I've talked to have already been introduced to the idea, but after your presentation, there's absolutely no doubt left in their minds, and they're in a state of shock.
[02:08:01.274 --> 02:08:09.024]  And they're actually, have a power about them, and you can see that they're at a point where they know there's something they're going to have to do.
[02:08:10.003 --> 02:08:12.404]  Because we show you the police state, and not our opinion.
[02:08:12.444 --> 02:08:13.745]  Here it is, total police state.
[02:08:14.005 --> 02:08:16.606]  Then we show you how they use 9-11 to create a police state.
[02:08:16.846 --> 02:08:19.107]  Then we show you that they're devil worshippers.
[02:08:19.908 --> 02:08:21.128]  And it's not from our words.
[02:08:21.188 --> 02:08:21.928]  It's them.
[02:08:22.009 --> 02:08:23.649]  It's admitted.
[02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:26.731]  That's where it comes through the best, is the fact that it's undisputed.
[02:08:26.751 --> 02:08:27.751]  It's on the record.
[02:08:27.891 --> 02:08:30.833]  It's not a matter of conjecture or anything.
[02:08:30.873 --> 02:08:32.393]  It's an absolute documented fact.
[02:08:33.154 --> 02:08:35.855]  One thing I wanted to ask you about was, what do toll roads
[02:08:36.676 --> 02:08:43.680]  Tracking the gas prices and the corporate attempt to take control of water all have in common.
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:45.561]  I can tell you that answer if you don't have it.
[02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:47.562]  Well, it's just all control of energy.
[02:08:48.162 --> 02:08:53.365]  Water, the base energy of life, and then fuel, the base energy of our civilization.
[02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:55.326]  It's not about a free market.
[02:08:55.366 --> 02:08:57.868]  It's about total global plantation.
[02:08:58.008 --> 02:09:00.909]  Well, you just answered that question about water being a fuel.
[02:09:00.929 --> 02:09:03.571]  Yes, it is a fuel, and there are several people that are using it as a fuel.
[02:09:04.432 --> 02:09:09.216]  Also, the gas prices are as high as they are because the Federal Reserve System has collapsed.
[02:09:09.757 --> 02:09:13.681]  The extra cost of fuel is being used to prop up the Federal Reserve System right now.
[02:09:13.701 --> 02:09:18.526]  No, they admit, and then the Iraqi oil, the money goes directly into the Federal Reserve, that's admitted.
[02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:30.379]  And because the dollar has gone down 40 plus percent in value, that's one reason suddenly fuel prices are up 95 percent from what they were three years ago, and it's only going to get worse.
[02:09:30.579 --> 02:09:37.385]  I've talked to several inventors and they say there are so many people out there running their cars on water right now, that's one of the reasons that they're going for the control of water.
[02:09:37.765 --> 02:09:38.385]  Well, that is true.
[02:09:38.425 --> 02:09:40.426]  Now, it sounds like I'm contradicting myself.
[02:09:40.446 --> 02:09:42.067]  We were using 15 million barrels a few years ago.
[02:09:42.087 --> 02:09:44.308]  Now we're using 20 million barrels a day.
[02:09:44.328 --> 02:09:45.788]  Their oil revenues were at all-time highs.
[02:09:55.607 --> 02:10:08.494]  If they are unable to control the fuel cell revolution, the nanotech solar panels, where the car doesn't go 40 miles an hour, folks, it goes 150 miles an hour if you want.
[02:10:09.235 --> 02:10:12.596]  It's not ugly solar panels, it's the paint job.
[02:10:13.557 --> 02:10:15.398]  This could come to market now.
[02:10:15.798 --> 02:10:16.939]  They're trying to suppress it.
[02:10:17.599 --> 02:10:23.541]  But they're losing control, because China and others are going to use it, so now we've got to use it.
[02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:36.824]  And that is one thing that threatens them, but it's a total greed system, because the tolls they're replacing, and they're going to keep the fuel tax as well, so dwarf even the current taxes, see?
[02:10:37.344 --> 02:10:39.265]  So it's also a greedy, massive increase.
[02:10:39.485 --> 02:10:42.946]  But they are telling the highway planners this, so they'll all get behind it.
[02:10:43.672 --> 02:10:44.814]  Well, God's love be with you.
[02:10:44.854 --> 02:10:50.802]  You've done a wonderful job and keep up the good work and we'll do our part to keep the word getting out.
[02:10:50.923 --> 02:10:54.748]  And by the grace of God, the New World Order is on the run.
[02:10:54.888 --> 02:10:55.870]  They're on the run.
[02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:57.252]  They're scared to death of us.
[02:10:58.072 --> 02:11:03.273]  And they're going to be moving very quickly and furtively because they're afraid and they know their time is very short.
[02:11:03.293 --> 02:11:06.674]  And that makes them very dangerous because they won't turn and lose easily.
[02:11:07.174 --> 02:11:11.535]  I expect them to nuke cities and do a lot of stuff and kill a lot of people and, you know.
[02:11:11.895 --> 02:11:18.676]  Well, there are people like DeGrand Prix and many others that I've had good fortune to talk to.
[02:11:19.396 --> 02:11:25.157]  There is another calling them that's just waiting for them to try to make this next move and they're going to be stopped in their tracks.
[02:11:26.118 --> 02:11:27.058]  We'll see, my friend.
[02:11:27.078 --> 02:11:27.678]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:29.502 --> 02:11:33.544]  Look, I don't think everything... everything doesn't happen snap, crackle, pop.
[02:11:34.364 --> 02:11:35.284]  You know, instantly.
[02:11:35.524 --> 02:11:38.225]  It took the New World Order hundreds of years to get what they've got now.
[02:11:38.825 --> 02:11:43.507]  It'll take hundreds of years because the fight against them started hundreds of years ago.
[02:11:43.967 --> 02:11:45.308]  It'll take hundreds of years to stop it.
[02:11:45.348 --> 02:11:48.489]  I mean, if we stop pushing, they push even harder.
[02:11:49.869 --> 02:11:54.351]  Evil has always been with us and will be with us for, I guess, a long time.
[02:11:55.163 --> 02:11:59.205]  And so it's always going to be popping back out like a trap door spider out of the ground.
[02:12:00.966 --> 02:12:04.569]  But we've just got to be there and admit it's there and know it's there.
[02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:09.551]  You know, it's the old example of the devil's biggest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:12:10.952 --> 02:12:12.493]  Convincing us that evil isn't out there.
[02:12:12.553 --> 02:12:14.514]  That men don't do evil things.
[02:12:14.554 --> 02:12:15.595]  Being very naive.
[02:12:16.475 --> 02:12:18.397]  And rationalizing the evil we do.
[02:12:18.477 --> 02:12:20.017]  I mean, I'm an evil person, folks.
[02:12:20.678 --> 02:12:22.119]  People say, oh, you're a very good person, Alex.
[02:12:22.159 --> 02:12:24.160]  Yeah, but believe me, the thoughts I have
[02:12:27.269 --> 02:12:35.234]  Less than I used to, but the things I think, the mean things I've done, it's bad.
[02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:37.535]  And I've got to get control of that.
[02:12:38.035 --> 02:12:40.377]  And I am, every day, trying to control that.
[02:12:40.457 --> 02:12:42.578]  Most people don't even know that's going on in their mind.
[02:12:43.259 --> 02:12:46.641]  That there's this internal struggle in all of us, and something's got to be wrong with them.
[02:12:48.362 --> 02:12:53.025]  I mean, we are a very aggressive species, a very intelligent species.
[02:12:54.344 --> 02:12:56.285]  And things have really gotten perverted.
[02:12:56.886 --> 02:12:58.407]  We are a predatory species.
[02:12:59.608 --> 02:13:02.509]  A cottontail rabbit or a jackrabbit is not a predator.
[02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:06.432]  A cow is a bovine is not a predator.
[02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:09.474]  A crocodile is a predator.
[02:13:09.654 --> 02:13:12.776]  A lion, a tiger is a predator.
[02:13:12.876 --> 02:13:13.897]  A bear is a predator.
[02:13:14.337 --> 02:13:16.058]  Homo sapiens sapien is a predator.
[02:13:16.138 --> 02:13:17.499]  A great white shark is a predator.
[02:13:18.259 --> 02:13:23.463]  And because we've dominated all the animal species and dominated the earth, but we have a predatory nature,
[02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:26.313]  We have now created subgroups of humans.
[02:13:27.654 --> 02:13:29.035]  Almost a new species.
[02:13:29.135 --> 02:13:33.859]  The elite are the same genetics as us, even though they've been interbred, so in respect they're not.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:42.766]  But it's almost a fusion of evil marrying evil, and then that's nature, then nurture, how they're raved, their views.
[02:13:43.267 --> 02:13:50.733]  And so because they are predatory, they have literally bred society and set civilization up to be a predatory system where the 1%, less than that,
[02:13:54.155 --> 02:14:02.888]  One-tenth of one percent of the elite at the top and their ten percent minions that serve them are having to slave the other ninety percent of us.
[02:14:04.341 --> 02:14:09.165]  And just like they have propaganda in Iraq today, you know, lay down, the government loves you, it's for your safety.
[02:14:09.406 --> 02:14:11.127]  What do you think our dominant media is?
[02:14:11.427 --> 02:14:14.970]  And the people spouting the propaganda don't even know they're propagandists in many cases.
[02:14:15.271 --> 02:14:18.674]  But as things have become more clear, now they have to pay the politicians off.
[02:14:18.894 --> 02:14:20.315]  They have to pay the media people off.
[02:14:20.355 --> 02:14:21.656]  Now it is becoming clearer.
[02:14:21.897 --> 02:14:23.438]  Because it's gotten so evil.
[02:14:26.701 --> 02:14:29.483]  And so for every action, there's an equal or greater reaction.
[02:14:29.543 --> 02:14:31.245]  I mean, you know, this is no martial law.
[02:14:32.043 --> 02:14:34.023]  I've said this is the film that could get me killed.
[02:14:36.184 --> 02:14:37.744]  But that is the price.
[02:14:37.824 --> 02:14:44.385]  As a man, I have to defend my country because my children live here, my wife lives here, my family lives here.
[02:14:44.445 --> 02:14:47.826]  And I know that the country has to be free if they're going to be free and safe.
[02:14:48.766 --> 02:14:54.447]  And so as a man doing my job, I don't... I've made the decision.
[02:14:54.567 --> 02:14:55.287]  I've committed.
[02:14:55.367 --> 02:14:56.167]  It's instinctive.
[02:14:56.747 --> 02:14:58.007]  There's no debating it.
[02:14:58.247 --> 02:15:01.348]  I'd jump in front of a train for my family.
[02:15:02.890 --> 02:15:09.513]  And that means I jump in front of a train for you because if people don't jump in front of trains, if men don't jump in front of trains, we live in a total slave state.
[02:15:10.193 --> 02:15:12.194]  You are slaves when you are afraid to stand up.
[02:15:12.714 --> 02:15:21.178]  When you are afraid to lose your life in the defense of humanity and life and love and beauty, you are already enslaved.
[02:15:21.218 --> 02:15:22.078]  You are not alive.
[02:15:22.979 --> 02:15:27.041]  You will, literally folks, you become alive when you make this decision.
[02:15:28.681 --> 02:15:30.062]  Literally, that's the only way to describe it.
[02:15:30.772 --> 02:15:40.022]  Until you make that decision, and I don't mean just in words, I mean in deeds and in actions, and it takes control of you more and more until there's no fear.
[02:15:41.023 --> 02:15:42.244]  It's totally burned away.
[02:15:44.026 --> 02:15:49.252]  Every once in a while, I become afraid, just for a few seconds.
[02:15:50.467 --> 02:15:53.289]  And I just think about how quick life is and how fast it's all going to be gone.
[02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:57.652]  And then I think about the little people in my life, the people that need to be protected.
[02:15:58.333 --> 02:16:00.995]  And it's just, oh, it's like a warm comforter.
[02:16:01.095 --> 02:16:04.257]  It's not even... It's an honor.
[02:16:05.038 --> 02:16:05.798]  It's an honor.
[02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:08.140]  I am so blessed.
[02:16:09.141 --> 02:16:10.241]  My cup runneth over.
[02:16:10.341 --> 02:16:17.587]  I mean, when you've got a society that's only... where everybody's worried about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
[02:16:18.982 --> 02:16:25.125]  And where everybody takes the easy path, and where everybody goes the way of stagnation, it ensures none of us are safe.
[02:16:25.205 --> 02:16:27.766]  It ensures a horrible, predatory climate.
[02:16:29.827 --> 02:16:32.528]  Those that gain their life are those who are willing to give it up.
[02:16:33.468 --> 02:16:36.270]  And I may live another 50 years or another two.
[02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:39.091]  You know, the globalists could kill me today.
[02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:41.472]  You know, they've threatened me before.
[02:16:42.372 --> 02:16:46.094]  But it doesn't matter, there's already so many of us.
[02:16:47.202 --> 02:16:49.183]  There's already so many of us standing up and fighting.
[02:16:49.223 --> 02:16:49.803]  We're winning.
[02:16:49.863 --> 02:16:50.603]  We're growing.
[02:16:52.043 --> 02:16:54.844]  The life force is being energized.
[02:16:56.105 --> 02:17:02.446]  And the species deep down, even globalists know what they're doing, is going to destroy things.
[02:17:02.587 --> 02:17:04.467]  And there's going to be a rebellion within them.
[02:17:05.167 --> 02:17:05.908]  They are being
[02:17:08.502 --> 02:17:09.802]  Seduced by goodness.
[02:17:10.662 --> 02:17:18.044]  When you're pure evil, or you're a minion of pure evil, believe me, the light becomes quite alluring.
[02:17:18.864 --> 02:17:22.364]  That's why they can't completely move, because so many of their own people are waking up.
[02:17:23.945 --> 02:17:26.285]  They give orders, and it doesn't happen.
[02:17:27.505 --> 02:17:34.666]  So they try to propagandize and lie, and mass-warp the public, and they're trying to warp us, spiritually, psychologically, right now.
[02:17:34.686 --> 02:17:36.707]  And it's working on some, but not on others.
[02:17:36.787 --> 02:17:37.847]  It's having the opposite effect.
[02:17:38.801 --> 02:17:40.583]  We'll continue your transmissions, enemy!
[02:17:41.544 --> 02:17:42.925]  You only make us stronger!
[02:17:42.945 --> 02:17:44.106]  I'll be back!
[02:17:46.288 --> 02:17:52.633]  To the farthest corners of the Earth, Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did!
[02:17:52.653 --> 02:17:55.315]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.535 --> 02:17:57.097]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.457 --> 02:18:02.541]  Unlike Explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:02.862 --> 02:18:04.083]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:18:04.143 --> 02:18:06.845]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:07.225 --> 02:18:13.170]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:13.951]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:13.991 --> 02:18:14.452]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:14.492 --> 02:18:17.354]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:26.782 --> 02:18:32.265]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:32.305 --> 02:18:34.326]  Get the map.
[02:18:34.346 --> 02:18:36.747]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[02:18:36.967 --> 02:18:37.948]  The time is now.
[02:18:38.308 --> 02:18:39.268]  Call 800-686-2237.

[02:18:45.632 --> 02:18:48.894]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:48.954 --> 02:18:53.136]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:53.376 --> 02:18:56.158]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:56.358 --> 02:18:58.759]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:58.959 --> 02:19:07.604]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:07.784 --> 02:19:09.145]  The Berkeley light is different.
[02:19:09.325 --> 02:19:13.507]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:13.827 --> 02:19:14.447]  We're good to go!
[02:19:42.637 --> 02:19:44.298]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:45.599 --> 02:19:48.120]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:57.986]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:19:58.906 --> 02:20:05.710]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:20:06.610 --> 02:20:08.051]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:08.291 --> 02:20:11.333]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:20:12.313 --> 02:20:20.839]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.378 --> 02:20:49.099]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:20:49.359 --> 02:20:50.500]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:55.701]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:20:55.841 --> 02:20:59.202]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:20:59.262 --> 02:21:01.223]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:21:01.243 --> 02:21:01.763]  Cardivite.
[02:21:01.823 --> 02:21:02.263]  Cardivite.
[02:21:02.323 --> 02:21:03.844]  We all use Cardivite!
[02:21:04.725 --> 02:21:08.208]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[02:21:46.603 --> 02:21:51.705]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.406 --> 02:21:54.766]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.687 --> 02:22:01.049]  Alright, let's split their calls, because I'm literally... The news I haven't covered is very interesting and important.
[02:22:02.589 --> 02:22:08.972]  Up next is Jamie in Kentucky, then Miles, Luke, Chip, and David and others.
[02:22:09.072 --> 02:22:11.173]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Jamie.
[02:22:11.773 --> 02:22:14.594]  Hey, Alex, I just got to say that
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:17.541]  Knowledge is power, buddy.
[02:22:18.821 --> 02:22:19.382]  It is power.
[02:22:20.202 --> 02:22:21.643]  And I thank you for that power.
[02:22:22.223 --> 02:22:22.943]  That's knowledge.
[02:22:24.264 --> 02:22:26.265]  Because you inform us every day about it.
[02:22:26.305 --> 02:22:28.346]  Well, I don't have the corner on the market on that.
[02:22:32.627 --> 02:22:45.133]  It states, like I said in the Bible yesterday, that in Revelation, it states that there's ten nations that get together, form this new world order,
[02:22:46.329 --> 02:22:48.210]  One World Government, as it's really called.
[02:22:49.990 --> 02:23:01.053]  And it will be controlled, I think, this is what I've been hearing off these prophecy, you know, TV and TBN and stuff.
[02:23:02.213 --> 02:23:03.614]  It will be controlled by Europe.
[02:23:04.354 --> 02:23:09.836]  The Roman Empire, the revived Roman Empire.
[02:23:10.276 --> 02:23:12.716]  But then those very shows tell us George Bush is wonderful.
[02:23:13.277 --> 02:23:14.737]  Well, they're deceived then.
[02:23:15.549 --> 02:23:16.389]  I don't know about wisdom.
[02:23:16.490 --> 02:23:21.852]  It's really just common sense stuff, but I appreciate the call, Jamie.
[02:23:21.952 --> 02:23:22.473]  God bless you.
[02:23:22.493 --> 02:23:24.133]  Miles in North Carolina.
[02:23:24.153 --> 02:23:24.934]  Go ahead, Miles.
[02:23:47.370 --> 02:23:57.015]  I was just going to say that, talking about those TV broadcasts, I have relatives that believe that, you know, stuff about Bush, like Bush is a Christian.
[02:23:57.035 --> 02:23:59.936]  Well, he's like some kind of saint or something.
[02:24:00.216 --> 02:24:12.883]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I find it interesting when your mind is illuminated, I mean, you know, like, open, I don't know if that's the right word, but you're
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:15.721]  When the blinders are off.
[02:24:16.101 --> 02:24:17.562]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:24:17.922 --> 02:24:20.823]  When the blinders are off, it's amazing what you see.
[02:24:22.924 --> 02:24:23.785]  You see a lot.
[02:24:24.565 --> 02:24:38.071]  Well, the way I look at it, I cancel my cable TV, but I understand what you're saying because people like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all they talk about is how good Republicans are.
[02:24:38.171 --> 02:24:41.893]  I mean, of course I know they're Republican anyway, and so am I, but
[02:24:42.481 --> 02:24:44.662]  They're out Clinton-ing, they're out Clinton-ing Clinton.
[02:24:44.722 --> 02:24:49.265]  So, just because they have an R before their name, does that make them conservative?
[02:24:49.425 --> 02:24:50.566]  Good points, thanks for the call.
[02:24:50.586 --> 02:24:52.187]  I'm trying to hurry through these calls.
[02:24:53.308 --> 02:24:55.109]  Luke in Michigan, go ahead Luke.
[02:24:56.049 --> 02:24:56.830]  Hi, can you hear me?
[02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:57.710]  Yes I can.
[02:24:59.091 --> 02:25:03.494]  Yeah, I just had a little bit of an experience with the police state a few weeks ago.
[02:25:03.514 --> 02:25:07.997]  It was, we were driving home.
[02:25:10.211 --> 02:25:16.973]  I was, I was on the college tour, I was driving home from spring break with another guy, he was driving and... And they wanted to search your vehicle?
[02:25:16.993 --> 02:25:19.574]  Well, no, they didn't want to search the course over.
[02:25:19.594 --> 02:25:25.336]  They asked for his driver's license and registration, which is normal, then they asked for mine.
[02:25:26.857 --> 02:25:27.417]  My license.
[02:25:28.698 --> 02:25:30.678]  Yeah, they were running you to see if there was any warrants.
[02:25:31.779 --> 02:25:33.860]  Yeah.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:35.700]  I asked them, why do you want mine?
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:37.721]  Because he's the one you're
[02:25:38.717 --> 02:25:52.446]  The driver is the one you want, and he said... Up to then, the cops were really nice, and he said... They just snapped at me and said, you're not the one asking the questions here.
[02:25:52.986 --> 02:25:54.287]  Yeah, well you're a slave, sir.
[02:25:54.307 --> 02:25:55.728]  You've got to learn to serve them.
[02:25:55.928 --> 02:25:57.749]  We are the servants of them now.
[02:25:58.049 --> 02:25:59.890]  They'll tell you they're no longer public servants.
[02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.871]  We serve them.
[02:26:00.891 --> 02:26:02.692]  It's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:26:02.712 --> 02:26:05.594]  Pulls you over, starts doing a fishing expedition.
[02:26:06.622 --> 02:26:07.702]  And this is what they do.
[02:26:07.722 --> 02:26:08.303]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:08.323 --> 02:26:09.843]  Appreciate it.
[02:26:09.903 --> 02:26:14.124]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Chip in Colorado.
[02:26:14.164 --> 02:26:14.844]  Chip, go ahead.
[02:26:15.305 --> 02:26:16.085]  Hi Alex.
[02:26:16.125 --> 02:26:16.865]  Pleasure to speak with you.
[02:26:16.885 --> 02:26:17.725]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:26:17.965 --> 02:26:21.346]  Hey, just a real quick comment and a quick question for you.
[02:26:21.727 --> 02:26:28.529]  I'm a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber and recently I saw your Marshall Law film and I just want to commend you for that.
[02:26:28.589 --> 02:26:29.229]  It's awesome.
[02:26:29.249 --> 02:26:29.889]  Just incredible.
[02:26:30.695 --> 02:26:46.182]  And I ordered the DVD for it, and my question for you is, I know you give permission to make copies of your film for non-profit purposes, but for the DVD, copying that, I just want to ask, are your DVDs encrypted?
[02:26:46.202 --> 02:26:47.923]  Do they have that protection on them?
[02:26:49.052 --> 02:26:52.974]  No, they're... What, you've got Road to Tyranny and you're having trouble making copies?
[02:26:53.274 --> 02:26:57.675]  I know, I actually don't have the software yet, but I was just wondering for the future... No, they're not encrypted.
[02:26:57.695 --> 02:27:00.797]  They have zero country code, means they play everywhere on the planet.
[02:27:01.137 --> 02:27:06.319]  They're DVD-9s, so you can't put them on a normal disc, but you just buy the larger disc.
[02:27:07.099 --> 02:27:11.781]  And, uh, you can also get a DVD-9 burner now... Right.
[02:27:11.841 --> 02:27:14.142]  ...for like 50 bucks, so... The dual-ailer?
[02:27:15.722 --> 02:27:16.022]  Yeah.
[02:27:16.302 --> 02:27:16.763]  Right, right.
[02:27:17.683 --> 02:27:17.883]  Okay.
[02:27:18.807 --> 02:27:19.708]  I think so.
[02:27:19.768 --> 02:27:20.248]  Is that it?
[02:27:20.429 --> 02:27:20.969]  That's all I have.
[02:27:21.149 --> 02:27:21.710]  Well, thank you.
[02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:23.391]  I hope you make a thousand copies, brother.
[02:27:23.411 --> 02:27:25.393]  And we've got the DVD.
[02:27:25.493 --> 02:27:26.634]  They're shipping right now.

[02:27:29.076 --> 02:27:32.219]  Take one more call and I'm plunging into the news.
[02:27:36.222 --> 02:27:37.143]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.623 --> 02:27:39.245]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.265 --> 02:27:42.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.439 --> 02:27:53.943]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.363 --> 02:27:58.587]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.827 --> 02:28:05.812]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.232 --> 02:28:12.335]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.475 --> 02:28:13.715]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.036 --> 02:28:16.977]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:17.137 --> 02:28:19.158]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.478 --> 02:28:26.701]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:27.001 --> 02:28:30.383]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:28:46.256 --> 02:28:49.819]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:49.859 --> 02:28:50.380]  are located?
[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:53.962]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:29:46.267 --> 02:29:49.430]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:29:49.611 --> 02:29:52.333]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:29:52.513 --> 02:29:53.895]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:29:54.075 --> 02:30:03.985]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:30:04.205 --> 02:30:05.947]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[02:30:06.227 --> 02:30:10.130]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:10.311 --> 02:30:14.754]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:30:14.934 --> 02:30:18.797]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:30:19.038 --> 02:30:25.222]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:30:25.403 --> 02:30:28.225]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:30:28.405 --> 02:30:31.768]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[02:30:31.828 --> 02:30:35.631]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.

[02:30:37.172 --> 02:30:37.852]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[02:30:38.092 --> 02:30:39.413]  Good to have you with us, David.
[02:30:39.433 --> 02:30:40.013]  How are you doing today?
[02:31:05.842 --> 02:31:06.042]  Great.
[02:31:06.942 --> 02:31:08.003]  Hey, hey, how you doing?
[02:31:08.623 --> 02:31:09.523]  I'm doing great.
[02:31:09.763 --> 02:31:13.724]  Hey, I wanted to let you know some of the news that's going on here in Albuquerque.
[02:31:14.424 --> 02:31:19.105]  Recently, the evidence room for the Albuquerque Police Department has had a scandal.
[02:31:19.505 --> 02:31:24.867]  The police chief has had to step down due to evidence being stolen out of the room.
[02:31:24.907 --> 02:31:27.527]  Also, they had a freezer that went down for over 100 hours.
[02:31:28.168 --> 02:31:32.169]  And, you know, there's been a lot of debate back and forth as to what the solution is.
[02:31:32.649 --> 02:31:33.629]  And currently, they're
[02:31:34.744 --> 02:31:40.946]  Pushing for a solution to get a private company to run the evidence lab for Albuquerque Police Department.
[02:31:42.446 --> 02:31:52.089]  Well, then the police chief, and I know nothing about this from past actions, normally if a police chief's New World Order, he can do anything he wants and won't get in trouble.
[02:31:52.669 --> 02:32:01.191]  So you probably got a good police chief, and I have no idea about this, a good police chief and bad people inside are blaming him for stuff they're doing,
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:07.048]  And you'll probably have an even worse police chief, and I'm sure this private lab will be absolutely horrible.
[02:32:08.671 --> 02:32:10.474]  That's from past activities.
[02:32:11.938 --> 02:32:15.840]  That might be the case, but you know, Albuquerque police are fairly corrupt.
[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.202]  I mean, if you get out of line, they'll just go ahead and shoot you.
[02:32:19.002 --> 02:32:20.203]  No, no, listen.
[02:32:20.743 --> 02:32:22.524]  I was purely speculating there.
[02:32:22.564 --> 02:32:23.084]  I understand.
[02:32:23.144 --> 02:32:30.188]  It's just, if you're New World Order, you can do no wrong, and a lot of times, they'll blame a police chief for something bad cops do.
[02:32:30.208 --> 02:32:34.831]  I just find it unusual, just over that, a police chief's having to leave, unless it's bigger.
[02:32:36.127 --> 02:32:37.408]  I've got a second comment.
[02:32:37.788 --> 02:32:44.792]  On Wednesday, a caller asked you what you thought was the most important thing that we could do to defeat the New World Order.
[02:32:44.852 --> 02:32:49.414]  And one thing that I didn't hear you mention was to get rid of the voting machines.
[02:32:49.875 --> 02:32:55.998]  I think that's probably the most important thing that we can do at this point is to get it to where we can have a paper ballot.
[02:32:56.485 --> 02:33:06.134]  And then also, secondarily, in my opinion, we need to get the Constitution Party in power and they will bring about the majority of the things that you espoused on Wednesday.
[02:33:06.714 --> 02:33:09.437]  Is this that news reporter I was interviewed by on Albuquerque?
[02:33:10.498 --> 02:33:10.818]  No, sir.
[02:33:11.239 --> 02:33:18.025]  Okay, I got interviewed by a local radio gal who writes for the newspaper and he sounded like you when I was talking to him off air.
[02:33:19.756 --> 02:33:21.937]  And again, I have no idea about Albuquerque politics.
[02:33:22.357 --> 02:33:28.560]  I'm just saying that you've always got to look at different angles of things as well, but thank you for the call, sir.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.360]  Really fine points you made.
[02:33:31.301 --> 02:33:40.084]  You know, I know I've been saying forever and a day that I'm going to have new t-shirts, and we've actually had new t-shirts printed up.
[02:33:41.585 --> 02:33:49.388]  One of them is the famous George Orwell quote, that in an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:33:50.029 --> 02:33:59.497]  Says that on the front, on the back it says LearnTheTruthInfoWars.com Got them in black and white and women's shirts and all that.
[02:33:59.617 --> 02:34:06.823]  We got another one, well another couple of great websites that are listed on some of the shirts.
[02:34:07.343 --> 02:34:08.584]  It was three different shirts.
[02:34:09.245 --> 02:34:10.045]  Three different things.
[02:34:11.226 --> 02:34:19.533]  And they should be up on the website InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com this weekend.
[02:34:21.152 --> 02:34:28.314]  They should be up on the site for you to order via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart by this weekend, because I've had requests for more t-shirts.
[02:34:28.775 --> 02:34:32.376]  You know, we've got the Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works t-shirt.
[02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:34.236]  This is a picture of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[02:34:35.357 --> 02:34:37.838]  Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works on the front.
[02:34:37.898 --> 02:34:47.201]  On the back it says Politicians Agree, or Politicians Like Disarmed Peasants, InfoWars.com.
[02:34:49.662 --> 02:34:54.125]  There's another bumper sticker that says politicians agree disarmed peasants are best.
[02:34:54.625 --> 02:34:57.967]  But no, this one says politicians love disarmed peasants on the back.
[02:34:58.507 --> 02:34:59.668]  Infowars.com.
[02:34:59.708 --> 02:35:03.831]  Great t-shirt, but some people don't want to walk around with a picture of Hitler on their shirt.
[02:35:04.711 --> 02:35:08.614]  I've done it before and I've worn the shirt hundreds of times.
[02:35:08.634 --> 02:35:10.975]  I've been offering it for about four years.
[02:35:11.956 --> 02:35:14.477]  And people will walk up and go, why is Hitler on your shirt?
[02:35:14.977 --> 02:35:15.378]  Well...
[02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:19.368]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[02:35:19.428 --> 02:35:22.429]  You know, it doesn't mean I'm a follower of Mao or Stalin either.
[02:35:23.369 --> 02:35:29.371]  But it's a good conversation piece t-shirt to meet like-minded people that get what the shirt means.
[02:35:29.891 --> 02:35:32.192]  Then we have our Tyranny Response Team dark blue shirt.
[02:35:32.212 --> 02:35:34.793]  Looks like a firefighter shirt or cop shirt.
[02:35:35.273 --> 02:35:42.255]  On the arm it says Infowars.com and on the chest and back it says Tyranny Response Team.
[02:35:42.275 --> 02:35:43.756]  That's a great conversation piece
[02:35:45.066 --> 02:35:47.008]  But these new t-shirts are great too.
[02:35:48.148 --> 02:35:51.531]  They'll be up sometime this weekend.
[02:35:52.871 --> 02:35:57.254]  They'll be there on the site with pictures of them and the rest of it.
[02:35:57.274 --> 02:36:03.598]  And of course my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out on DVD.
[02:36:04.259 --> 02:36:05.539]  Now shipping those bad boys.
[02:36:05.559 --> 02:36:07.160]  I've been shipping the VHS for a month.
[02:36:08.581 --> 02:36:10.442]  The DVD is a little over three hours long.
[02:36:10.563 --> 02:36:12.644]  The VHS is two hours thirty-five minutes long.
[02:36:14.238 --> 02:36:17.859]  And I hope that everybody out there gets this film.
[02:36:17.879 --> 02:36:19.919]  You've heard the listeners that have gotten copies of it.
[02:36:19.939 --> 02:36:21.320]  They say it's my best video.
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:22.720]  Waking people up.
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:23.700]  Having a big effect.
[02:36:24.201 --> 02:36:27.301]  We got a deal where if you order 10 of them, they're $14 a piece.
[02:36:27.321 --> 02:36:29.242]  If you really want to support us.
[02:36:29.922 --> 02:36:30.202]  10 of them.
[02:36:31.042 --> 02:36:33.203]  If you order one, it's $25.95.
[02:36:33.243 --> 02:36:34.323]  Really, three films in one.
[02:36:34.923 --> 02:36:37.084]  Order the second copy, it's $19.95.
[02:36:37.204 --> 02:36:39.484]  Order a third copy, and it's $16.
[02:36:39.524 --> 02:36:41.985]  So you can get three for a good discount.
[02:36:42.817 --> 02:36:45.759]  Or you can get 10 for $14 a piece.
[02:36:46.419 --> 02:36:47.920]  And then if you want, be a distributor.
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:51.123]  If you want to get even more, we'll even go down more, folks.
[02:36:51.143 --> 02:36:55.405]  If you want to sell them in your bookstore, at your church, or whatever.
[02:36:55.465 --> 02:36:58.407]  But what I'd rather you do is, I don't want to make money.
[02:36:58.928 --> 02:37:05.492]  All I care about is making enough money to pay my staff and make future films and be able to make these documentaries.
[02:37:05.952 --> 02:37:09.895]  Martial Law cost me about $25,000 to make, and that's the most expensive film I ever made.
[02:37:09.935 --> 02:37:11.456]  You'll learn why when you see it.
[02:37:15.003 --> 02:37:16.363]  No, I want you to make copies of them.
[02:37:16.403 --> 02:37:25.085]  I want you to get them, and I want you to make copies of them, and air them on AXS TV, give them to opinion makers in your area.
[02:37:26.646 --> 02:37:32.927]  It is so vitally important that you do that.
[02:37:33.888 --> 02:37:34.748]  So please,
[02:37:35.555 --> 02:37:36.455]  Get Marshall Law.
[02:37:36.475 --> 02:37:37.016]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:37.336 --> 02:37:43.718]  While you're at it, get some of the other videos.
[02:37:43.738 --> 02:37:44.498]  They're excellent as well.
[02:37:44.559 --> 02:37:45.379]  Big discounts on those.
[02:37:45.399 --> 02:37:45.439]  888-253-3139.
[02:37:51.707 --> 02:37:56.050]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:58.752]  Again, that's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704, or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:37:58.772 --> 02:38:01.914]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv where you can watch all of the films.
[02:38:17.384 --> 02:38:18.125]  Including the new one.
[02:38:18.145 --> 02:38:20.006]  My weekly TV reports, special reports.
[02:38:20.026 --> 02:38:21.307]  I've got two new reports going up this week.
[02:38:21.688 --> 02:38:28.293]  My book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of audio interviews, special video reports that aren't in films or on my TV show, just on the website.
[02:38:28.593 --> 02:38:29.474]  There's a bunch of those.
[02:38:29.794 --> 02:38:33.317]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:38:33.658 --> 02:38:37.341]  And you can download and burn copies of the film right there on the site.
[02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:39.983]  You can print copies of my book up.
[02:38:40.023 --> 02:38:41.444]  Just knock yourselves out, folks.
[02:38:41.464 --> 02:38:43.506]  This is about defeating the New World Order.
[02:38:44.412 --> 02:38:47.874]  I just need, quote, seed money, as the preachers like to say, to continue this.
[02:38:49.014 --> 02:39:01.781]  And what I do is the size of a mustard seed, tiny little dot, but you know those mustard seed hamburger buns, when you see the tiny little seed, you can hardly see it?
[02:39:02.841 --> 02:39:05.903]  It grows like a huge oak tree, folks, because you get it.
[02:39:06.263 --> 02:39:12.266]  It's a mustard seed, maybe, to use a better analogy, the size of an acorn,
[02:39:13.226 --> 02:39:16.507]  Until you take action, then it becomes an entire forest.
[02:39:17.407 --> 02:39:18.048]  Through you!
[02:39:18.928 --> 02:39:21.709]  Only you could stop the New World Order.
[02:39:21.729 --> 02:39:22.149]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:39:22.529 --> 02:39:30.672]  Okay, uh... I can only spend a minute on this.
[02:39:31.532 --> 02:39:38.114]  Again, the Masons come out of secret construction guilds 3,000 plus years ago in Egypt.
[02:39:38.675 --> 02:39:51.988]  Because mathematics was power, and the second most powerful position in the Pharaoh's kingdom was construction master or architect, grand architect, as they called Karl Rove.
[02:39:52.889 --> 02:39:59.615]  And then the Jews picked up on that when they left, and picked up on that secret society, Babylon, mystery, religion stuff.
[02:40:00.396 --> 02:40:03.799]  Moses had been one of the chief construction engineers.
[02:40:05.333 --> 02:40:09.316]  But he said turn away from that and he went up on Mount Sinai and came back down.
[02:40:09.356 --> 02:40:15.840]  Everybody was having a big orgy and devil worshipping and a bunch of them got killed.
[02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:20.984]  Those are the people, and again it's a spirit, it's an idea.
[02:40:21.024 --> 02:40:23.165]  You could be German, you could be Jewish, you could be Chinese.
[02:40:23.586 --> 02:40:25.267]  Those are the people with the counterfeit.
[02:40:26.031 --> 02:40:33.397]  And literally from there it then goes into Solomon, and that's where the Masons claim their roots, but they're lying to you.
[02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:35.959]  At 33rd degree you learn it goes back to the pyramids.
[02:40:36.619 --> 02:40:48.148]  And then it just goes on through, and Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, Order of Death, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, they're all the same group, just different chapters.
[02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:50.389]  Alright?
[02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:52.251]  But the heads of
[02:40:53.974 --> 02:40:56.555]  The heads of all these global groups are just a few hundred people.
[02:40:57.075 --> 02:40:58.696]  You can go learn this and look this up.
[02:40:58.716 --> 02:41:03.258]  You can have thousands of members, but it's just a few hundred leaders that are in control of all of it.
[02:41:04.278 --> 02:41:06.839]  And so, people hear, you know, George Washington was a mason.
[02:41:06.939 --> 02:41:09.060]  Oh, then the Founding Fathers must have been bad.
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:09.300]  No.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:12.942]  I mean, that's like saying somebody works for the FBI, they must be bad.
[02:41:12.962 --> 02:41:21.105]  90% of people in the FBI are just pencil pushers, or they're out investigating bank robberies or white collar fraud.
[02:41:22.486 --> 02:41:24.066]  It's that 10% that's very, very evil.
[02:41:24.967 --> 02:41:28.948]  And it's the same thing with, you know, any of these groups.
[02:41:29.868 --> 02:41:33.849]  I mean, because Ariel Sharon is corrupt and evil doesn't mean Jews are corrupt and evil.
[02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:36.930]  Because Adolf Hitler was bad doesn't mean Germans are bad.
[02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:38.330]  These are evil people.
[02:41:40.531 --> 02:41:45.172]  Oh, and see, people don't... Well, I'm a Republican, they say, so Bush must be a good person, because I'm a good person.
[02:41:45.232 --> 02:41:45.532]  No!
[02:41:45.572 --> 02:41:46.372]  You've been conned!
[02:41:46.412 --> 02:41:47.032]  He's bad!
[02:41:47.052 --> 02:41:48.033]  Same thing with the Democrats.
[02:41:48.773 --> 02:41:48.953]  Alright.
[02:41:51.016 --> 02:41:58.202]  Bush has been keeping a low profile, not because he respects the Pope as they're spinning, but because he always hides out when he's in Europe from the media.
[02:41:58.562 --> 02:42:00.324]  Former lawmaker decries Patriot Act.
[02:42:00.364 --> 02:42:04.607]  It's time for conservatives and liberals to put aside their differences and support changes to the Patriot Act.
[02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:08.010]  A former congressman and conservative radio talk show host said Wednesday.
[02:42:08.951 --> 02:42:10.993]  And Bob Barr said there's major problems with it.
[02:42:11.053 --> 02:42:13.515]  We don't need to get rid of part of it, we need to get rid of all of it.
[02:42:14.672 --> 02:42:18.255]  Homeland Security picks Total Information Awareness Champion, CNET News.
[02:42:18.676 --> 02:42:23.599]  A Federal Privacy Board on Wednesday appointed a prominent champion of government data mining as its chairman.
[02:42:23.639 --> 02:42:28.944]  Yeah, they put over election fraud James Baker, who runs the election fraud.
[02:42:29.664 --> 02:42:31.966]  And this guy was for the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:42:31.986 --> 02:42:37.050]  He's now going to oversee the new systems they've set up under new names to confuse you.
[02:42:38.701 --> 02:42:41.703]  Man arrested, cuffed after using $2 bills.
[02:42:41.723 --> 02:42:44.984]  57 year old business owner of a major company in Baltimore.
[02:42:45.044 --> 02:42:46.145]  The Baltimore Sun reported.
[02:42:46.545 --> 02:42:48.847]  His brother's a prominent senior police officer.
[02:42:48.867 --> 02:42:51.368]  He says all this because he's freaking out.
[02:42:51.748 --> 02:42:57.111]  He went in to buy some stuff at Best Buy and used a lot of $2 bills he'd gotten from the bank.
[02:42:59.012 --> 02:43:01.673]  Because part of his tour business, he gives them out as mementos.
[02:43:01.753 --> 02:43:03.254]  And they said, these aren't real.
[02:43:03.294 --> 02:43:04.155]  He said, yeah, they're $2 bills.
[02:43:05.225 --> 02:43:14.872]  And they arrested him, well detained him, handcuffed him to a chair in front of everyone for an hour, until the Secret Service got there, and the Secret Service said, yeah, $2 bills are real.
[02:43:14.972 --> 02:43:15.932]  I thought everybody knew that.
[02:43:16.072 --> 02:43:17.994]  You can get $2 bills right now at the bank, folks.
[02:43:19.054 --> 02:43:22.897]  I remember my great-uncle used to give them to me as presents when he came over, because they were neat.
[02:43:23.558 --> 02:43:24.518]  Same thing this guy did.
[02:43:24.658 --> 02:43:25.459]  Boy, big problem.
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:30.442]  And I have a friend who they called the police on, and he paid with a silver dollar.
[02:43:32.684 --> 02:43:34.485]  You know, and it says the worth on it.
[02:43:35.723 --> 02:43:47.452]  and uh... they call the police these people are so stupid and uh... after they did this commenting on the incident baltimore
[02:43:48.815 --> 02:43:56.257]  Police spokesman Bill Toohey told The Sun it's a sign that we're all a little nervous in the post 9-11 world.
[02:43:56.717 --> 02:44:11.080]  Every time they taser a 85-year-old woman, every time they taser a 5-year-old, every time they beat somebody, every time they shoot the wrong guy, every time they go to the wrong house, every time they shoot a woman in a Red Sox post game in the head and kill her, well, it's post 9-11.
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:12.200]  We're all a little nervous.
[02:44:13.433 --> 02:44:16.675]  It's like, oh, it's Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:17.036 --> 02:44:18.977]  Well, things have changed.
[02:44:19.037 --> 02:44:20.718]  Except on the border, it's more open than ever.
[02:44:22.460 --> 02:44:26.122]  Granddaughter yanks grandma's feeding tube.
[02:44:26.142 --> 02:44:31.006]  81-year-old, neither terminally ill, comatose, nor vegetative state in Florida.
[02:44:32.687 --> 02:44:38.992]  But without any prior legal authority, they're still killing her, taking her feeding tube away.
[02:44:39.921 --> 02:44:41.383]  She's begging for food.
[02:44:41.983 --> 02:44:43.485]  I'll kill her, unfortunately.
[02:44:44.526 --> 02:44:45.748]  Some good news.
[02:44:46.148 --> 02:44:52.536]  Personal Democracy Report has links to the other mainstream news articles.
[02:44:52.936 --> 02:44:59.564]  You heard on Monday that on Tuesday the San Francisco Board of Examiners, or their city council,
[02:45:01.372 --> 02:45:11.336]  I was looking to restrict political websites and news websites, blogs, regulate, audit them, tax them, total violation of the First Amendment.
[02:45:14.137 --> 02:45:16.878]  If you've got over 500 hits a month, folks, that's nothing.
[02:45:19.239 --> 02:45:22.100]  A hundred people visiting your website will create 2,000 hits.
[02:45:22.140 --> 02:45:25.642]  You know, everything you click is a hit.
[02:45:26.542 --> 02:45:28.503]  And they've postponed it for a month
[02:45:29.623 --> 02:45:33.506]  They wanted to do it, but because of huge outcry and protest, they've backed off for now.
[02:45:33.846 --> 02:45:35.847]  But it shows what they want to do!
[02:45:36.207 --> 02:45:37.908]  We're hurting them that bad!
[02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:47.975]  Continuing here with the news, their personal priest for Terry Shabo-Schindler is saying her last days were horrible.
[02:45:48.415 --> 02:45:50.636]  Blood running out of her, moaning, convulsing.
[02:45:51.357 --> 02:45:56.120]  It's just a very, very sad report here that I've got in front of me.
[02:45:58.928 --> 02:46:09.776]  We're going to basically end the broadcast here in just a few minutes because I've had requests to air Renegades in the final segment, so we're going to do that, so I hope you stay with us for that.
[02:46:10.337 --> 02:46:13.019]  Marburg spreads in Angola as death toll hits 174.
[02:46:13.259 --> 02:46:27.070]  Reuters, a world health organization, on Friday called for stepping up measures in Angola to halt the further spread of the deadly Marburg virus, which killed 174 people, mainly in the north of the country.
[02:46:28.007 --> 02:46:30.390]  That's some new spin-off of Ebola.
[02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:34.615]  A lot of evidence shows it's been manufactured.
[02:46:34.936 --> 02:46:38.840]  Talking about the occult, Ethiopia prepares for a return of obelisks next week.
[02:46:40.102 --> 02:46:44.988]  There's also one of Reuters, the first segment of an Ethiopian national treasure, the ancient
[02:46:45.974 --> 02:46:51.038]  Oxum Obelisk that was plundered by Italian fascist invaders almost 70 years ago.
[02:46:51.458 --> 02:46:52.279]  Hitler did that too.
[02:46:52.299 --> 02:46:53.319]  He thought it gave him power.
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:54.100]  Again, the occult.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:56.702]  Years ago, he returned home, April 13th.
[02:46:57.102 --> 02:46:58.463]  Government minister said Friday.
[02:46:58.483 --> 02:47:14.635]  Ethiopian Minister of Culture, Teshum Tuga, said the remaining two segments of the 24-meter obelisk, believed to be at least 1,700 years old, were expected to be transferred back to the northern town of Oxum by the end of the month.
[02:47:16.269 --> 02:47:23.472]  And Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, or El Duce, robbed it as a totem of power.
[02:47:25.572 --> 02:47:26.133]  Ah, yes.
[02:47:26.533 --> 02:47:37.657]  And Francois Mitterrand spent his own money and public money to build a giant gold pyramid out to the Louvre, and he demanded 666 pieces of gold glass.
[02:47:39.778 --> 02:47:43.679]  And the circumference of the big State House up in Canada,
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:49.284]  is 666 in many of its rooms, and they have an Ark of the Covenant there as well.
[02:47:51.466 --> 02:47:55.289]  This is how bizarre and totally out of control these people are.
[02:47:56.049 --> 02:48:11.322]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on your AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave at 3210, or at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and rebroadcast throughout the weekend, and I'll be back, God willing, on Monday, from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:48:12.162 --> 02:48:15.324]  I just love life so much, and I'm so thankful for all of you, the great listeners.
[02:48:15.845 --> 02:48:19.627]  I'm so thankful for the great folks running the broadcast, all of our affiliates, our sponsors.
[02:48:20.608 --> 02:48:23.110]  And I hope that you'll realize how much power you've got.
[02:48:23.630 --> 02:48:29.214]  And I hope you'll stand up against tyranny, the forces of the New World Order, and dehumanization everywhere.
[02:48:30.014 --> 02:48:34.217]  Alright, some great songs coming up, all of Renegades and part of Revolution.
[02:48:34.918 --> 02:48:37.559]  And then we'll wrap up this transmission against tyranny.
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:39.581]  God bless you all.

[02:48:55.662 --> 02:49:00.045]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:49:00.145 --> 02:49:01.466]  A New World Order.

[02:52:08.361 --> 02:52:16.765]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand for that.
[02:52:16.805 --> 02:52:22.889]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
