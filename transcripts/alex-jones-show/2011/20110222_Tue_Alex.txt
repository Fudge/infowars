[00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.710]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:11.151]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:12.853]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:17.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:21.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.700]  We're going to have a power-packed transmission for you today.
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.942]  It is the 22nd day of February on this Tuesday edition, 2011.
[00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:57.046]  And obviously oil has shot up by 9 percentage points in just the last few hours as the turmoil in the Middle East intensifies.
[00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.368]  And many political analysts in the United States, Europe and Russia
[00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:06.375]  Are saying they believe that the Middle East now faces decades of turmoil.
[00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:13.945]  In fact, the Russian President Medvedev sees, quote, fires for decades in Arab world.
[00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:18.451]  And the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to overthrow Gaddafi.
[00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:34.048]  It appears that it was probably disinformation put out by British intelligence and the Muslim Brotherhood that came out of the British Foreign Office that Muammar Gaddafi had fled yesterday to Venezuela and Hugo Chavez's little hermitage that he has there.
[00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.355]  There are confirmed reports of helicopters and fighter aircraft bombing and strafing the protesters.
[00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.559]  And regardless of what side you sit on, the media is calling them protesters.
[00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.303]  They are people engaged in insurrection to overthrow the government.
[00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:52.925]  Muammar Gaddafi is a dictator.
[00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:54.467]  He is a thug.
[00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:56.188]  He is a socialist.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.681]  He is a funder of terrorists.
[00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.802]  Real terrorists, back in the day.
[00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:03.464]  Not the stage terrorists.
[00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:15.410]  But that does not mean that we're going to get something better there, because when the globalist unseen hand is involved in something, you better believe there's a larger reason that it's happening.
[00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.271]  So yeah, good, get rid of Hosni Mubarak.
[00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.193]  Get rid of Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.114]  Get rid of the Saudi royal family.
[00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:28.612]  Get rid of all of these hereditary dictatorships or these dictatorial systems.
[00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:35.113]  But at the same time, we have to look at the larger issue that it's about bringing the world into turmoil.
[00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:40.655]  And many of these countries, what the media calls Muslim extremists, are going to be going into power.
[00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:43.835]  And you have to ask, why do the globalists want that?
[00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:46.916]  They're going to set up their own form of tyranny.
[00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:54.082]  And that appears to be where it's leaning, and most political scientists say that that's going to be the outcome in most of these countries.
[00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:59.286]  So I don't shed any tears for Hussein Mubarak, but he's gone.
[00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:05.030]  Same military junta that took over 30-plus years ago has now just stepped into his place.
[00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:28.562]  So, he goes away, has a convenient stroke, kind of like the dictator of Tunisia, and more of the same comes in, and it's celebrated by Anderson, admitted CIA Cooper, that this is just absolute heavenly Valhalla, and that we should all just be celebrating the incredible freedom of the Middle East, with George Soros and his operatives in the State Department all over it and bragging
[00:03:30.174 --> 00:03:33.635]  In fact, Google is bragging that they're helping run these operations.
[00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:36.757]  Well, of course, Google's NSA, CIA, Information Warfare System.
[00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:42.319]  Now, here's a headline out of Reuters, Russia blames Google for stirring Egyptian unrest.
[00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.840]  Well, they sent their people in to do it.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.820]  It's not debated.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:55.104]  I like that headline yesterday, you know, the widow of that top-level former Bush administration official who was shot dead and then thrown in a trash can.
[00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:59.466]  And then the headline is, she claims a hitman killed him.
[00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:01.568]  Well, no, I mean, he was murdered.
[00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.168]  He was killed.
[00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:07.532]  I mean, the guy sat on the boards of more than 30.
[00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:09.854]  I read the list on air a few weeks ago.
[00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:13.137]  What was his name?
[00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:13.517]  Wheeler?
[00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:14.358]  I gotta pull it back up.
[00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:17.400]  The point is, he sat on all these giant Fortune 500 boards.
[00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:27.868]  He was involved in all these different serious operations, and he's disheveled, running around town without a shoe for a day, obviously running for his life under surveillance.
[00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.597]  And, well, I'm already digressing.
[00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:33.639]  It's just, that's how they spin it.
[00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:36.721]  It's like, Russia says Google's involved.
[00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:39.283]  Google says they're involved.
[00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:41.946]  The woman says a hitman killed her husband.
[00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:42.406]  He was hit.
[00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.468]  It was a professional hit.
[00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:45.869]  It was thrown in a dumpster.
[00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.051]  And there's no investigation.
[00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:49.652]  It's just, we don't even know if he was killed.
[00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:52.074]  Yeah, he was murdered, but we don't know if it's a hitman.
[00:04:52.514 --> 00:04:54.096]  We'll be right back with all this incredible news.
[00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:55.357]  Lindsey Williams coming up, by the way.
[00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:04.986]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:05.926]  Number one.
[00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:09.369]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:10.230]  Number two.
[00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.053]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:15.854]  It's true.
[00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:20.698]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.018 --> 00:05:21.558]  Number three.
[00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:25.121]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:29.124]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:29.865]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.487]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:36.270]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.771]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:41.274]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:46.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.561]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:52.282]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:54.564]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:57.105]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:04.246]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:08.449]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.713]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:18.516]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:22.439]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.442]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:33.579]  I'm looking for America.
[00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.160]  We're American and be proud.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.301]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:43.003]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:06:43.323 --> 00:06:47.165]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:59.628]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:03.949]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.290]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.712]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:15.574]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.835]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:20.676]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:27.339]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.341]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:34.823]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:40.086]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:45.589]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.671]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:54.133]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:59.234]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:08.297]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:11.878]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.754 --> 00:08:21.881]  All right, we're going to cover the incredible ongoing developments in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:46.898]  The response in Europe, the response of the United States in Russia to it, the incredible effects it's having with one-day oil prices going up by 9% in one day on fears of what's happening in Libya, what's happening in Bahrain, what's happening in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, what's happening
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:56.990]  In several other countries, the island nation of Morocco, the royal family is being shook there by protest.
[00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:02.385]  We've got Lindsey Williams coming up in the third hour.
[00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:03.546]  In fact, we're going to call him right now.
[00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:05.867]  I may just get him on in the middle of the next hour.
[00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:07.528]  So we have an hour and a half with him today.
[00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:18.896]  And I thought yesterday to call Lindsey because about 95% of what Ken Fromm, the former head of operations for Atlantic Richfield, the late Ken Fromm,
[00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:21.117]  We couldn't give out his name for years.
[00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:24.019]  I knew his name because I figured it out reading the Energy Non-Crisis.
[00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:29.983]  Mr. Fromm was actually fired for a while because of that book in 1980 and they brought him back.
[00:09:30.943 --> 00:09:44.032]  The other Mr. X in the book, well he's not Mr. X in the book, it's all hidden in plain view, was the CEO of one of the big three oil companies separately that Lindsey knows.
[00:09:44.812 --> 00:09:48.415]  And going back five, six years ago, even though folks like
[00:09:50.097 --> 00:09:53.418]  Dr. Stan Monteith, who's on this network, been on the radio for over 30 years.
[00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:55.439]  He still likes to check things out.
[00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:56.659]  He was able to figure out who they were.
[00:09:56.699 --> 00:10:00.860]  He called both of them and confirmed that indeed they were telling Williams this.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.161]  And one of them told Monteith, you know, don't call me again.
[00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:08.182]  And wouldn't return his calls after that.
[00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.783]  So, I know that these men
[00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:20.013]  Both Mr. From and the other gentleman who we can't say his name are real, and I know that Lindsey's been talking to them.
[00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:24.198]  Now, it was hidden in plain view back in 2007.
[00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:37.086]  It came out from leaks to Jim Tucker and Daniel Estill and others that they were going to plan to drive up oil prices massively.
[00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.248]  That's all we got out of Bilderberg.
[00:10:40.008 --> 00:10:55.439]  And then later I noticed that when Williams was covering it, that we'd had a PrisonPlanet.com article from that period, a few months before Williams came out, with our Bilderberg sleuths that have the connections, that have been proven to be just stunning.
[00:10:56.838 --> 00:11:01.602]  Jim Tucker especially, 33 years now, plus covering Bilderberg.
[00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:04.224]  It may be, I guess we're on to the 34th year in June when they meet again.
[00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:12.571]  And Tucker, let's just say, has moles who aren't Bilderberg members, but who are their secretaries.
[00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:13.592]  People like that.
[00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:14.953]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:42.300]  When you get sources that high level inside where the real decisions are being made, unless they're feeding you disinformation, that is, unless Ken Fromm and the other gentleman who I can't name were telling Williams disinformation or telling him things that were his opinion, unless those factors are in there, you can take it to the bank.
[00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.066]  I mean, here's some of the things that Jim Tucker predicted.
[00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:57.772]  Two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, he said that it would be taken down basically in a quasi-staged event towards Perestroika and detente.
[00:11:58.072 --> 00:11:58.892]  People laughed at him.
[00:11:58.972 --> 00:12:01.073]  It happened.
[00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:12.359]  Six months before George W. Bush announced that he was going to accept four years ago that global warming was real and was going to go ahead and go along with carbon taxes, Jim Tucker said that that was from inside Bilderberg.
[00:12:14.215 --> 00:12:16.436]  And then months later, Bush did come out and do that.
[00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:19.258]  I mean, there are countless examples.
[00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.421]  Tucker has said, Tony Blair is going to be called.
[00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:28.804]  A little-known member of British Parliament, he's going to be the Prime Minister coming up in two years.
[00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:29.524]  Boom!
[00:12:29.664 --> 00:12:30.005]  Happened.
[00:12:30.785 --> 00:12:31.846]  He called Bill Clinton.
[00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:38.105]  When he was a little-known governor and went to Bilderberg a year before the campaign started, Tucker called it.
[00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.867]  Rick Perry went to Bilderberg in 2007.
[00:12:41.067 --> 00:12:46.270]  That's how our film Endgame ends, is with us talking about Rick Perry.
[00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:54.335]  And I know the inside baseball here in Austin, he has got the presidential pre-run book out, fed up.
[00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:59.698]  Even Texas Monthly has reported that their inside sources here in Austin confirm that Perry's running for president.
[00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:07.264]  Maybe even with Palin, they've been in those discussions with each other, but they're deciding whose ego's bigger, who's going to be the VP.
[00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:11.208]  Perry won't take her as, he won't be a VP.
[00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:18.375]  And Palin's saying that she isn't going to be VP, but they're trying to pair those two up.
[00:13:20.236 --> 00:13:25.842]  So, coming out of nowhere, Mitt Romney's going to be big, Ron Paul's going to be big, but Rick Perry.
[00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:26.822]  And we knew that.
[00:13:27.878 --> 00:13:36.003]  From Bilderberg 2007, they don't invite governors or members of parliament from countries to the events unless they're presidential contenders.
[00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:49.611]  I cover this in the Obama Deception, and I'm covering this to detail how powerful the inside info is from inside groups like Bilderberg.
[00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:55.115]  Or if you're able to talk to former Bilderberg group members or attendees, the type of information you can get.
[00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:56.696]  Because
[00:13:59.448 --> 00:14:07.493]  There are just, again, countless examples of the information that we're able to get from there, then actually unfolding and happening.
[00:14:07.974 --> 00:14:10.075]  Another example is covering the Obama deception.
[00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:16.839]  2008, we knew Bilderberg Group was going to be meeting in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.681]  We get on an airplane.
[00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:20.282]  I go up there.
[00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:28.147]  Two nights before it officially starts, I'm following the news.
[00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:43.650]  The day before it starts, it's all over the news that Obama said get on the airplane to the press corps when he was the frontrunner, just at that point passing Hillary, and that they were going to be going to Chicago.
[00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:52.355]  And they put the press corps on the plane, slammed the door shut there at the airport in D.C.
[00:14:54.428 --> 00:15:06.954]  They're at Dulles, and took off, and there's of course the video, the press corps going, we've been Shanghai, we've been kidnapped, and then for a day and a half, the media raced all over Virginia and Washington D.C.
[00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:10.736]  and Maryland, looking for where Hillary and Obama were meeting.
[00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:22.341]  They went to different Senators' houses, they went to different hotels, and I'm there, getting home from the night before Bilderberg starts, at my hotel, at the Hyatt, they were meeting at the
[00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:44.879]  Marriott in Chantilly and I'm watching the news sitting there in my bed in my underwear and they're reporting on the missing Obama and Hillary and I actually called Aaron Dykes up in his room and I said aim a camera at the television set on CNN that's all they're talking about get some of this on video.
[00:15:46.354 --> 00:15:47.215]  Aaron did one better.
[00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:51.359]  He went downstairs in the bar with a camera and aimed at the television.
[00:15:51.399 --> 00:16:00.769]  That's the little clip you see in Obama Deception where you see actually a clip of MSNBC while Aaron's in the bar shooting it.
[00:16:00.789 --> 00:16:02.371]  They're talking about secret meeting.
[00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:03.292]  Where are they really meeting?
[00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.311]  Of course, the Bilderberg meeting was about to take place.
[00:16:08.852 --> 00:16:12.153]  We had intel that Obama was going to be there.
[00:16:13.134 --> 00:16:14.274]  Tucker got that intel.
[00:16:14.795 --> 00:16:15.615]  So did Estalin.
[00:16:17.156 --> 00:16:31.863]  And then here comes two different motorcades with Secret Service with their submachine guns up in the windows with the Secret Service license plates going in.
[00:16:32.483 --> 00:16:34.144]  And so there was Hillary Clinton
[00:16:35.447 --> 00:16:41.208]  and Barack Obama meeting and there was this big national top story at the time.
[00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:44.869]  Will Hillary or will Obama bow out for the party?
[00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:47.690]  Because they were basically a dead heat.
[00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.890]  Obama in some polls was a few points ahead.
[00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.731]  Will they stop savaging each other?
[00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:54.051]  What's going to happen?
[00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:55.371]  Where are they secretly meeting?
[00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:59.832]  Why did they send the press corps to Chicago telling them that Obama will be on the plane?
[00:17:00.472 --> 00:17:03.513]  And then Gibbs, his press secretary at the time,
[00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:08.823]  Well, there was a desire to meet with some people privately and so that's why we did this.
[00:17:09.183 --> 00:17:11.524]  And he sat there and giggled and laughed about it to the media.
[00:17:12.524 --> 00:17:19.247]  But Obama was like gold then, you know, the savior in waiting so no one dare criticize him.
[00:17:19.828 --> 00:17:29.492]  But the larger issue here is that you could have the two presidential contenders in a neck-and-neck race
[00:17:32.196 --> 00:17:46.154]  Go meet secretly off and on at a hotel and CNN, ABC, CBS, they're not stupid, they had sources, Fox News, they knew where Obama and Hillary were.
[00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:48.878]  We called them!
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:18:00.429]  We call the scores, standing out there all day and night outside Bilderberg, we call the Washington Post, we call the Washington Times, we call the New York Times, we call local TV stations.
[00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.353]  One newspaper came out there, and that was the Epoch Times, and they wrote a story about it.
[00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:12.600]  And that's an international paper basically affiliated with the Falun Gong, an anti-communist publication.
[00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:39.586]  But there's an illustration of the power of the Bilderberg Group, that the mainstream media, you've got the biggest story in the country, Obama and Hillary have disappeared for a day or more, no one knows where they are, we're calling the media, telling them Obama and Hillary are meeting secretly here, that's the biggest story ever, in the middle of a campaign, wondering who's going to get the presidential nomination for the Democratic
[00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:50.432]  Presidential run and you've got hundreds of protesters and dozens and dozens of alternative media outlets Streaming it for days over YouTube.
[00:18:50.452 --> 00:18:53.693]  We were doing live streaming On Justin TV.
[00:18:53.733 --> 00:19:03.418]  We were doing live call-ins I was the only other program would talk about it was coast to coast a.m Had me on to what two nights in a row to give reportage on it So coast to coast a.m.
[00:19:03.498 --> 00:19:08.580]  Epoch Times and that's it if you want to talk about big mainline Media, that's it
[00:19:11.013 --> 00:19:20.561]  So, it's an illustration of the secret meetings behind closed doors, that the decision was made that Hillary would step down and get behind Obama and become Secretary of State, and that was announced a few days later.
[00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:23.583]  We were able to predict what was going to happen.
[00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:25.164]  We also had moles inside.
[00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.807]  And then you have this larger example of media control.
[00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:33.483]  I don't believe Lindsey Williams.
[00:19:33.683 --> 00:19:36.203]  I know Lindsey Williams does talk to these men.
[00:19:36.883 --> 00:19:41.565]  And his information that he's gotten from them being relayed to us is what they told him.
[00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:48.086]  And Lindsey says that this is clearly the biggest information that he's ever been given.
[00:19:48.746 --> 00:19:51.947]  Not from Ken Fromm, but it confirms what he said before he died in December.
[00:19:52.727 --> 00:19:54.168]  Lindsey laid all this out in October.
[00:19:54.468 --> 00:19:57.429]  But from the other guy, about what's really happening in the Middle East.
[00:19:58.009 --> 00:19:58.869]  And wait till you hear this.
[00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:04.816]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[00:20:05.136 --> 00:20:08.738]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[00:20:09.038 --> 00:20:12.880]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.121]  That's why you need...
[00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:17.022]  Sea Energy.
[00:20:17.302 --> 00:20:26.912]  From AffinitySeaEnergy.com, sea vegetation is known to be the richest source of organic minerals, and that's what you'll find in all-natural, great-tasting Sea Energy.
[00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:37.203]  Sea Energy contains aloe vera, black cherry, cranberry, and pomegranate juices, plus ginseng, cat's claw, ginger, gingko biloba, and over 50 trace minerals.
[00:20:37.483 --> 00:20:38.824]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:40.385]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.026]  A new world order based upon
[00:21:08.464 --> 00:21:13.228]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.588 --> 00:21:17.772]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.092 --> 00:21:20.434]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:22.976]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.336 --> 00:21:25.898]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:33.865]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:39.430]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.351]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:45.833]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.093 --> 00:21:47.013]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:48.474]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.514 --> 00:21:49.615]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.414 --> 00:21:59.814]  Good day.
[00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:01.575]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:02.035]  February 22, 2011.
[00:22:02.095 --> 00:22:03.556]  Gold opened this morning at $14.0140.
[00:22:03.596 --> 00:22:06.998]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $14.3759, $7.1879 for a half-ounce, or $3.5940 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:22:07.058 --> 00:22:07.578]  That's $14.3759, $7.1879, or $3.5940.
[00:22:19.924 --> 00:22:22.928]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been reduced to old relics.
[00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:26.834]  Politicians ignore travel with their outlandish, overreaching policies.
[00:22:26.934 --> 00:22:30.920]  Your support of the Campaign for Liberty stands in the way of this insidious process.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.281]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:32.362 --> 00:22:36.828]  I've teamed up with the Campaign for Liberty to offer the authentic proof quarter-ounce pure gold coin.
[00:22:37.088 --> 00:22:42.611]  For only $390 plus shipping, Midas will donate $100 to this incredible organization.
[00:22:42.831 --> 00:22:45.473]  Help fight big government by ordering your gold coin at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.673 --> 00:22:52.337]  You get to win twice by owning gold and fighting an overreaching government.
[00:22:52.497 --> 00:22:52.777]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.797 --> 00:22:53.198]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.685 --> 00:23:01.665]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:02.786]  No kidding!
[00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:06.966]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:23:07.327 --> 00:23:09.767]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:23:10.087 --> 00:23:13.288]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:18.349]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:23:18.569 --> 00:23:25.270]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.351]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[00:23:29.511 --> 00:23:31.492]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[00:23:31.612 --> 00:23:32.752]  Fit standard mason jars.
[00:23:32.972 --> 00:23:36.114]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.
[00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:38.975]  Place orders at ReusableCanningLids.com or call 1-877-747-2793.
[00:23:38.995 --> 00:23:39.035]  877-747-2793.
[00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:39.275]  Call 877-747-2793.
[00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:40.135]  Or go to ReusableCanningLids.com.
[00:23:40.156 --> 00:23:42.156]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids.
[00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:43.197]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:18.201]  Alright, we're going to break down oil going up more than 9% in just the last five hours since it started trading in New York.
[00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:21.667]  We are going to get into
[00:24:24.605 --> 00:24:33.434]  The latest developments in North Africa and the Middle East and also in the Mediterranean, with Morocco in turmoil, that is all coming up.
[00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:44.967]  I stayed up here at the office until late last night and had about a 45-minute discussion with Lindsey Williams and he told me what he's going to talk about on the air.
[00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:53.231]  And he basically is going to break it down from the beginnings of meeting these men and being the liaison.
[00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.293]  A lot of big corporations do this.
[00:24:55.873 --> 00:25:01.560]  Between three major oil companies and the oil field workers, he was basically their legate.
[00:25:03.467 --> 00:25:12.435]  The old Roman days, the Emperor couldn't be everywhere, and so he would have two or three trusted, what they called, legates, or people that could serve as their spokesmen.
[00:25:12.775 --> 00:25:20.082]  And so that's why he was allowed into all these meetings, and was allowed to see all these secrets, and wrote the Energy Non-Crisis that's out of print in 1980.
[00:25:20.202 --> 00:25:25.406]  And again, Ken Fromm got fired over that because he quoted him in it.
[00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:29.989]  Then Fromm got mad and actually gave public speeches in 1982.
[00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.411]  Williams will go over all this.
[00:25:33.451 --> 00:25:35.352]  There's actual videos of all this out there.
[00:25:35.372 --> 00:25:37.673]  That's why I said this is always hidden in plain view.
[00:25:37.693 --> 00:25:38.414]  There's videos.
[00:25:39.234 --> 00:25:40.835]  Williams is trying to dig them up and send them to us.
[00:25:42.196 --> 00:25:43.056]  But I went and looked it up.
[00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:47.639]  There's records of these meetings where they actually gave public speeches on all this.
[00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:55.423]  On the fact that there was more oil in Alaska than in all of Saudi Arabia and that we weren't allowed to have even one-tenth of it.
[00:25:57.657 --> 00:26:02.984]  But then he walked through everything that these men came from up into December when he sadly passed.
[00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:07.389]  And the other gentleman, even more high-powered, again is in public view.
[00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.612]  It's in Lindsey's book, but you've got to figure it out for yourself.
[00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:12.596]  Because the guy says this under anonymity, so we're not going to break that here.
[00:26:19.434 --> 00:26:23.295]  Lindsay said it was always, again, the keyword term here is hidden in plain view.
[00:26:23.855 --> 00:26:39.378]  And I remember interviewing Williams 13, 14 years ago when he was laying out the energy non-crisis information and talking about the fact that we have all this oil here, which is now a mainstream fact.
[00:26:39.718 --> 00:26:48.000]  It was hidden for many years, but now they admit that they're not tapping even a fraction of what's in Alaska or other areas, or even the Gulf of Mexico for that matter.
[00:26:52.063 --> 00:26:56.646]  I'm trying to be careful about what I say here, because it's so complex, but also so simple at the same time.
[00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:57.966]  And Williams is coming up.
[00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:15.196]  But... Williams had an epiphany, and so did I. That's why I called him yesterday, and he wasn't even ready to come on yet, because you know he likes to produce a CD where he can break it all down for people.
[00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:17.397]  That's not been produced yet.
[00:27:18.738 --> 00:27:19.879]  I just had a feeling to call him,
[00:27:21.207 --> 00:27:44.936]  And to get him on the show, and he wasn't ready until today, but if you go back to his book, written in 1980, now 31 years ago, hard to believe how time flies, or if you listen to the interviews I did, 14, 13, 12, 10, I mean, I've interviewed him several times a year ever since I've been on the radio, really.
[00:27:46.557 --> 00:27:49.358]  I think I even interviewed him like in 96, but the point is,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:28:08.625]  That this was always the Henry Kissinger's Big Nebrazinski plan, this was the deal made with the Arabs, that is a public deal, that they would buy, with the oil money they got from the US, they would put it back in the US with T-bills.
[00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:12.645]  And this deal is actually covered in a fictional account.
[00:28:13.146 --> 00:28:18.070]  We should try to find this from the movie Network.
[00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.432]  In fact, I actually own that DVD.
[00:28:20.472 --> 00:28:21.653]  I meant to bring it into the office.
[00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:32.202]  But if you Google... Guys, YouTube, Network, Howard Beale talks to executive or talks to Mr.
[00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:38.546]  It's not Mr. Hackett played by Robert Duvall, it's his boss.
[00:28:39.447 --> 00:28:47.193]  And he calls him in and he says, You have meddled with the title forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and you will atone!
[00:28:51.636 --> 00:28:57.658]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back, Mr. Beale!
[00:28:57.958 --> 00:29:01.219]  They must, and he breaks down, they must be allowed to buy U.S.
[00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.280]  companies, Mr. Beale!
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.100]  They must be allowed to buy shares in this network, Mr. Beale!
[00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:06.281]  They must buy U.S.
[00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:07.461]  shares, Mr. Beale!
[00:29:07.781 --> 00:29:10.742]  Because it's the ebb and flow of international capitalization!
[00:29:11.302 --> 00:29:12.583]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[00:29:14.103 --> 00:29:16.984]  And they actually talk about, because that was all in the news at the time.
[00:29:17.264 --> 00:29:18.465]  A lot of this isn't even secret.
[00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:22.699]  And so, the Arabs have been totally scammed for 30 plus years.
[00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:37.043]  They've invested almost all their money in the T-bills and the dollar, and when they bring that down, they're gonna bring the Arabs down, the globalists are gonna move everything basically to China, and when Williams was telling me all this, it's already hidden in plain view.
[00:29:37.223 --> 00:29:45.206]  I already knew everything he was telling me, but this is from a Bilderberg Group-level individual confirming it, and just wait till we go over it.
[00:29:51.038 --> 00:29:54.003]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.023 --> 00:29:57.628]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.893 --> 00:30:05.814]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:06.155 --> 00:30:09.699]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:12.322]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.482 --> 00:30:17.768]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:18.189 --> 00:30:24.416]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.836 --> 00:30:30.378]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:34.480]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.982]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.282 --> 00:30:44.804]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.224 --> 00:30:48.186]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.786 --> 00:30:50.186]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:51.207]  It's here.

[00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:04.371]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:08.754]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:14.438]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.778 --> 00:32:15.199]  It's true.
[00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:20.923]  Government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:21.204 --> 00:32:24.506]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.787 --> 00:32:29.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:31.873]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.273 --> 00:32:35.616]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.936 --> 00:32:40.658]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.878 --> 00:32:45.639]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:49.961]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:51.661]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.881 --> 00:32:56.483]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:06.004 --> 00:33:11.569]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:14.712]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.557 --> 00:33:24.941]  Okay, let me try to sum this up simply, and then we'll go into more detail when Lindsey Williams joins us.
[00:33:26.516 --> 00:33:49.620]  There is a collection of private central banking families who were able to get most European countries, England and the United States, within the last 200 years or so, 1815 in England, similar time frame in continental Europe, not till 1913 in the United States, but they were able to position themselves to control the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.441]  So they could buy up the world, buy up any media, buy up governments, do anything.
[00:33:54.841 --> 00:34:04.309]  They control the issuance of currency and credit through the governments, but they are paid interest on the right for the government to produce money.
[00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:06.971]  So they control all of the credit.
[00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:21.563]  Now, the Arabs have their own banking system that is based on upfront fees and has trillions and trillions of dollars in it because usury is illegal under Islamic law.
[00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:40.878]  Now that's another big reason the globalists want to overthrow those countries and put in new regimes who will play ball with them and allow the big banks to basically destabilize them, break them down through economic and societal turmoil, and then come in and finance their reconstruction.
[00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:52.781]  And there's so many multivariate, multifaceted, I'm quoting a video clip that's coming up in a moment, things that go into this, but everything's being converted into a corporate world government.
[00:34:53.182 --> 00:35:01.311]  In the 1970s, they put out Rollerball with James Caan, all about energy sectors and global unions and 10 unions.
[00:35:02.247 --> 00:35:10.202]  that form a global union and where there's different sectors and how certain nations are only allowed to produce certain things.
[00:35:10.462 --> 00:35:14.690]  One country's manufacturing, another communication, another energy.
[00:35:16.482 --> 00:35:25.450]  And then the UN sits above that with the only military force, or the fascist symbol of the hatchet on top of the bundle of sticks, you know, binding them together.
[00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:28.233]  And this is what globalism in the New World Order is.
[00:35:28.853 --> 00:35:37.561]  This is what they teach at Harvard and Yale and at the public school of public affairs at UT.
[00:35:38.042 --> 00:35:39.984]  Aaron Dykes went there, has a degree from there.
[00:35:41.493 --> 00:35:46.495]  And they taught world governments good, global corporate control, one world currency.
[00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:54.079]  And so when I hired him, it was a perfect fit because he'd been there, but they tried to teach him it was all good.
[00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:57.840]  And obviously here, he knew it was all true because he'd already been taught all that.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.481]  Just we have a different perspective.
[00:36:01.391 --> 00:36:14.529]  We don't want some far-off, unelected globalist who happened to be eugenicist who want to set up a planetary regime, get us all under debt, shut down society, have one-child policies, and basically phase out and call out the population.
[00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.351]  But Aaron...
[00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:25.435]  You know, when he got here, would just laugh at the mainstream media, saying there's no world government, there's no new world order, when all he was taught was that it was good, and it was great.
[00:36:25.755 --> 00:36:31.298]  And you hear these college students calling in, especially people going for their masters and their PhDs.
[00:36:32.239 --> 00:36:33.379]  Same thing with Steve Watson.
[00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:39.103]  He's got a master's in political science from a university in England.
[00:36:40.844 --> 00:36:41.664]  One in Nottingham.
[00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:43.626]  The point is, he was taught all that.
[00:36:43.906 --> 00:36:46.228]  So why can he now write articles and understand it all?
[00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:48.389]  Because the enemy taught him everything he knows.
[00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:53.934]  The enemy was there telling Steve Watson and telling Aaron Dykes that, yes, we're going to have a global government.
[00:36:53.974 --> 00:36:55.355]  Yes, we're going to control everybody.
[00:36:55.675 --> 00:36:56.896]  But it's for your own good.
[00:36:57.536 --> 00:37:06.083]  So they have movies like Rollerball in the 70s, where they rolled it out in a fictional account to pre-program and basically acclimate people.
[00:37:06.323 --> 00:37:07.744]  They put out movies like Network.
[00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:08.705]  Very well done.
[00:37:09.565 --> 00:37:30.938]  We're going to play a clip here with Ned Beatty, who's the big corporation chief, and he's calling in the news anchor, who went live on air, kind of had a breakdown, that is, he broke into reality, and he says, look, you know, we can't allow the Arabs to own this TV network.
[00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:32.291]  I don't
[00:37:50.095 --> 00:37:52.498]  Serious shockwaves throughout the global system.
[00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:56.963]  And then he tells them the global system will be no war, no famine, total peace.
[00:37:57.063 --> 00:38:01.387]  Kind of like Emperor Palpatine saying, now that we've killed all the Jedi, there will be peace.
[00:38:01.888 --> 00:38:11.238]  Yeah, peace meaning scorched earth, siege, annihilation, genocide, the oldest form of total war, completely wipe your enemy out.
[00:38:11.638 --> 00:38:14.561]  Financially, psychologically, dumbing everyone down.
[00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:16.143]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:22.130]  The globalists are threatened by intellect, by private property, by anyone of means who isn't part of their system.
[00:38:23.792 --> 00:38:32.101]  And if you watch Rollerball or you watch Network, both came out in the mid-70s, it's mercantilism.
[00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:57.018]  It's in the Associated Press again today, it broke a few weeks ago, that China is internally putting pressure because they own over a trillion dollars of quote UST bills, US debt, debt instruments, that they're ordering the Treasury to order the SEC to allow the Chinese to buy up critical infrastructure.
[00:38:59.557 --> 00:39:05.583]  Oil fields, toll roads, media companies, giant positions in stock markets.
[00:39:05.863 --> 00:39:08.545]  Not the stocks being traded, the stock markets themselves.
[00:39:08.926 --> 00:39:13.790]  The Germans, the EU, driven by the Germans, are now taking over the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.132]  It's all merging right now.
[00:39:16.853 --> 00:39:20.876]  And they've got this mercantilism where China keeps their currency low.
[00:39:21.957 --> 00:39:22.778]  Yeah, there's the headline.
[00:39:23.878 --> 00:39:24.599]  AP Business.
[00:39:25.179 --> 00:39:25.580]  China.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.562]  State firms to hand over more profits.
[00:39:28.722 --> 00:39:31.124]  No, that's not it.
[00:39:31.544 --> 00:39:32.765]  It's a headline of China.
[00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:34.246]  Let me give you the exact headline.
[00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:34.726]  China.
[00:39:37.588 --> 00:39:38.729]  China used U.S.
[00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:41.651]  debt holdings to pressure U.S.
[00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:43.152]  Here, I'll just dig it out.
[00:39:43.733 --> 00:39:45.334]  Problem is, I put all these articles together.
[00:39:45.354 --> 00:39:46.255]  There's so many of them.
[00:39:47.075 --> 00:39:47.676]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:47.696 --> 00:39:48.256]  It's all over the news.
[00:39:48.296 --> 00:39:49.057]  Everybody knows about it.
[00:39:49.974 --> 00:39:53.156]  I'm going to find it here, because I don't want to just say something and then not have it.
[00:39:55.297 --> 00:39:56.698]  Maybe it's in my global stack.
[00:39:57.339 --> 00:39:57.799]  Ah, there it is!
[00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.861]  Cable Show China used debt holdings to press U.S.
[00:40:01.681 --> 00:40:04.003]  and that's out of AFP, but it's also in AP.
[00:40:04.023 --> 00:40:04.943]  Good job, Marley.
[00:40:05.624 --> 00:40:07.345]  Okay, so there, documented debt for you.
[00:40:08.507 --> 00:40:16.713]  But it's all about the globalist at the banking level above countries with a balance of power so that nation states can't be strong and independent.
[00:40:17.173 --> 00:40:19.695]  And then all the power is in the hand of the offshore globalist.
[00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:23.618]  And so China keeps their currency way low, basically devalued.
[00:40:24.218 --> 00:40:25.539]  So no one can compete with them.
[00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:28.540]  They have internal tariffs against our goods getting in.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.244]  NAFTA and GATT and these international trade agreements are used with all these third world countries to leverage the U.S.
[00:40:35.484 --> 00:40:45.649]  with labor costs and with environmental regulations we have here and oppressive taxes to where you physically cannot make the products in many cases here in the U.S.
[00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:48.803]  And Mexico's losing its jobs now to China.
[00:40:49.124 --> 00:40:49.985]  And so is India.
[00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:51.606]  No one can compete with it.
[00:40:51.626 --> 00:41:01.978]  Because they've got giant slave factories where they've got to put big nets around their five and ten story buildings because people are committing suicide by the score every day.
[00:41:03.012 --> 00:41:06.554]  They're now drugging the workers so that they'll submit.
[00:41:06.974 --> 00:41:09.476]  Japan's looking at drugging their workers with lithium.
[00:41:09.716 --> 00:41:10.156]  The U.S.
[00:41:10.196 --> 00:41:12.418]  government was in the news two days ago calling for it.
[00:41:12.718 --> 00:41:19.242]  I mean, they're bringing in a system so dehumanizing that they're openly saying, we're going to drug you and put suicide nets up.
[00:41:19.762 --> 00:41:20.582]  That's the model.
[00:41:20.642 --> 00:41:21.923]  China already doing it.
[00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:29.187]  So it's mercantilism.
[00:41:29.848 --> 00:41:30.808]  And I go back to this 300 plus
[00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:51.839]  Years ago, the British had really developed it, but the French economics professors developed the tome or the handbook of mercantilism, and I've talked about it before, but to understand New World Order globalism, you've got to understand this.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:54.800]  This is the key to everything.
[00:41:57.221 --> 00:41:58.682]  French possessions
[00:42:01.536 --> 00:42:05.597]  Say, in the case of the eastern half of Hispaniola, what's Haiti today?
[00:42:06.397 --> 00:42:27.722]  They would not allow, under penalty of imprisonment or death, even French citizens who were living there and running sugarcane plantations, you know, slave plantations, to build a pickaxe, to forge a shovel, to make a firearm, to have any value-added product.
[00:42:28.042 --> 00:42:30.823]  There were even rules against glass.
[00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:33.381]  against blowing glass.
[00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:40.263]  And you can study this in, same thing in the British run colonies that is of course the original thirteen states.
[00:42:41.463 --> 00:42:42.644]  Before that, the thirteen colonies.
[00:42:43.984 --> 00:42:48.005]  And then later when people would revolt, they'd say, okay, well we'll just put a big tax on finished goods.
[00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:57.408]  They would only allow colonies to produce raw material so that it would have to be shipped back to the imperial seat, the imperial keep.
[00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:01.429]  And once it was shipped there,
[00:43:02.952 --> 00:43:15.217]  And once it was in place there, then they would sell it back as value added to the people in the colonies, and that was used as a form of control.
[00:43:15.698 --> 00:43:16.698]  Now that's mercantilism.
[00:43:17.058 --> 00:43:23.201]  Now, what we live under today, what we're entering now is neo-mercantilism.
[00:43:25.058 --> 00:43:28.281]  And no one else sees this, no one else talks... I've been talking about this for 15 years.
[00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:34.566]  Because I've studied mercantilism, I looked at globalism, I looked at what they said globalism was, and it was mercantilism without the name.
[00:43:34.947 --> 00:43:38.550]  And I'm waiting for professors and economists and others to pick up on this.
[00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.431]  I mean, am I really smarter than you?
[00:43:40.912 --> 00:43:42.893]  As someone studying economics and history?
[00:43:42.994 --> 00:43:43.274]  No!
[00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:44.435]  You're just not seeing it.
[00:43:46.633 --> 00:43:49.055]  But a rose is still a rose by any other name.
[00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:51.056]  This is mercantilism.
[00:43:51.717 --> 00:43:55.879]  And so the Arabs aren't allowed in their deals to produce any manufacturing.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:04.846]  They've got to buy their jet airplanes and their caterpillar equipment, their bulldozers and cranes from European or U.S.
[00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:05.346]  companies.
[00:44:06.187 --> 00:44:10.290]  They've got to buy their software from the Japanese or the Chinese.
[00:44:11.556 --> 00:44:20.838]  And in the agreements they signed in the mid-1970s, this is on record, they had to agree to spend a lion's share of their oil money back into the U.S.
[00:44:21.278 --> 00:44:25.679]  to buy T-bills, and thus prop up the dollar as the World Reserve currency.
[00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:38.482]  Now, what Ken Fromm told Williams a few months ago before he died, and what the other even more high-powered guy just recently told him, is exact... and he said all this in October was going to happen, that the Middle East would go into flames.
[00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:39.503]  I said, war?
[00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:40.763]  And he goes, no, destabilization.
[00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:47.132]  But then later, that was just a distraction towards China, but that it would drive up oil prices to 150 to 200.
[00:44:47.372 --> 00:44:51.033]  You just saw them go up 9% today.
[00:44:52.233 --> 00:44:52.553]  Okay?
[00:44:54.254 --> 00:44:57.055]  And so the Arabs have been set up, they've invested in T-bills.
[00:44:57.615 --> 00:45:04.217]  Now, as the dollar is basically phased out into the new global SDR, it'll still be there, it'll just be a component of it.
[00:45:07.813 --> 00:45:10.975]  The Arabs are going to just basically be put into turmoil.
[00:45:11.335 --> 00:45:14.197]  Let a bunch of, you know, wild crazies fight over power.
[00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:16.238]  Nothing destabilizes things better.
[00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:17.519]  They will implode.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.380]  Oil production will be put into doubt.
[00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:25.945]  And then huge oil production is going to then finally be brought back in the United States, but we're going to pay exorbitant prices for it.
[00:45:27.426 --> 00:45:35.191]  The United States will then go into a long period of decline in which China is built up as the new global force and enforcer.
[00:45:36.328 --> 00:45:42.829]  But then at a later date, the United States will be risen back up again, so the bankers can use the U.S.
[00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:46.310]  as a play against the Chinese, the Chinese as a play against the U.S.
[00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.251]  So it's three-dimensional, very complex chess.
[00:45:50.131 --> 00:46:03.334]  Now, here they are giving you the religion of the New World Order in this, what, 1974 network clip, where Howard Beale is called in by the head of the conglomerate to explain to him the religion of the New World Order.
[00:46:03.534 --> 00:46:03.914]  Here it is.
[00:46:04.773 --> 00:46:12.576]  You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it!
[00:46:12.596 --> 00:46:13.196]  Is that clear?
[00:46:14.497 --> 00:46:16.717]  You think you've merely stopped a business deal?
[00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:18.318]  That is not the case!
[00:46:18.918 --> 00:46:22.660]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back!
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.241]  It is ebb and flow!
[00:46:25.661 --> 00:46:26.681]  Tidal gravity!
[00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:28.522]  It is ecological balance!
[00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:36.378]  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
[00:46:36.658 --> 00:46:37.619]  There are no nations.
[00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:38.739]  There are no peoples.
[00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:39.940]  There are no Russians.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.060]  There are no Arabs.
[00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:42.481]  There are no third worlds.
[00:46:42.521 --> 00:46:43.502]  There is no West.
[00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:48.745]  There is only one holistic system of systems.
[00:46:49.505 --> 00:46:56.889]  One vast and humane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
[00:46:57.947 --> 00:47:06.010]  Petrodollars, Electrodollars, Multidollars, Reichmarks, Rings, Rubles, Pounds and Shekels.
[00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:15.693]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[00:47:17.254 --> 00:47:21.275]  That is the natural order of things today.
[00:47:22.976 --> 00:47:25.597]  That is the atomic
[00:47:26.917 --> 00:47:33.182]  And sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today!
[00:47:35.284 --> 00:47:40.728]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:46.993]  And you will atone!
[00:47:48.434 --> 00:47:49.655]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:54.959]  You get up on
[00:47:55.822 --> 00:48:03.428]  Your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy.
[00:48:05.009 --> 00:48:06.150]  There is no America.
[00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:08.512]  There is no democracy.
[00:48:09.532 --> 00:48:19.920]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
[00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:23.483]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[00:48:25.086 --> 00:48:28.248]  What do you think the Russians talk about in their Councils of State, Karl Marx?
[00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:38.574]  They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do.
[00:48:39.534 --> 00:48:42.416]  We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.
[00:48:44.157 --> 00:48:50.761]  The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the
[00:48:52.442 --> 00:48:55.123]  Immutable bylaws of business.
[00:48:58.165 --> 00:49:01.226]  The world is a business, Mr. Beale.
[00:49:03.267 --> 00:49:06.268]  It has been since man crawled out of the slime.
[00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:21.575]  And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that perfect world
[00:49:24.002 --> 00:49:29.347]  In which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality.
[00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:39.337]  One vast and ecumenical holding county, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit.
[00:49:40.218 --> 00:49:43.441]  In which all men will hold a share of stock.
[00:49:45.644 --> 00:49:47.445]  All necessities provided.
[00:49:54.286 --> 00:49:56.979]  All boredom, amused.
[00:50:00.123 --> 00:50:10.270]  Now, I have actually had big network type heads and people that have tried to hire me that I've, you know, met with privately on condition of anonymity to be offered things.
[00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:10.990]  It's okay to talk.
[00:50:11.391 --> 00:50:12.912]  And you basically get a speech like that.
[00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:14.793]  Globalism's gonna help people.
[00:50:14.813 --> 00:50:17.415]  Yeah, the new order's real, but you just don't get it.
[00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:18.195]  No, I do get it.
[00:50:18.455 --> 00:50:21.657]  You're a bunch of control freak murderers putting poison in the water.
[00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:24.860]  This isn't some lovey-dovey, happy world government.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.803]  Oh yeah, they're gonna entertain us with sports while they're putting lithium and other toxins in the water.
[00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:36.166]  While they're putting cancer viruses in our vaccines, as they've been caught doing ad infinitum.
[00:50:36.906 --> 00:50:39.468]  And so, world government is death.
[00:50:39.588 --> 00:50:52.114]  Kind of like that issue of... What was the January 2010 issue of National Geographic.
[00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:56.396]  It said, oh the whole world's gonna be the model, basically, of Singapore.
[00:50:56.696 --> 00:50:59.578]  It's like slitting your wrist and getting in a hot bathtub of water.
[00:51:01.519 --> 00:51:05.982]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:06.202 --> 00:51:14.848]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:51:46.982 --> 00:51:47.242]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:51:47.262 --> 00:51:47.482]  Or order
[00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:05.731]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:09.133]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.374 --> 00:52:14.157]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:14.177 --> 00:52:20.401]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:22.803]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.303 --> 00:52:23.623]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.643 --> 00:52:23.864]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.884 --> 00:52:24.464]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.484 --> 00:52:25.245]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.265 --> 00:52:26.946]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:46.143]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:52:46.603 --> 00:52:49.126]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.506 --> 00:52:58.694]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:53:00.436 --> 00:53:01.698]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.738 --> 00:53:07.085]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.325 --> 00:53:11.951]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.352 --> 00:53:12.753]  It's true.
[00:53:12.833 --> 00:53:17.379]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:22.601]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:23.141 --> 00:53:30.064]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.244 --> 00:53:31.144]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.364 --> 00:53:37.727]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:38.047 --> 00:53:40.889]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:41.229 --> 00:53:43.130]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.290]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:44.510]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:47.532]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:48.032 --> 00:53:49.773]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:15.456 --> 00:54:17.961]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:19.323]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:19.404 --> 00:54:20.345]  We are here live.
[00:54:20.406 --> 00:54:22.951]  Lindsey Williams is coming up in T-minus.
[00:54:24.516 --> 00:54:31.842]  37 minutes from now, he'll join us at 33 after coming up in the next hour for an hour and a half of live transmission.
[00:54:31.862 --> 00:54:38.046]  We may even go into overdrive and open the phones up if folks have questions or comments for Lindsey Williams.
[00:54:38.146 --> 00:54:50.595]  But the globalist, by being able to mimic the symbols of energy, seeds, salt, animal pelts, gold, silver, rubies, diamonds,
[00:54:52.448 --> 00:55:05.941]  Slaves, cooking oil, frankincense, myrrh, garlic, seashells, glass beads, they've all been used as symbols of currency and money.
[00:55:06.822 --> 00:55:08.624]  How much is a healthy slave worth?
[00:55:09.144 --> 00:55:10.284]  And you go to the slave auction.
[00:55:10.344 --> 00:55:11.205]  Every culture had it.
[00:55:11.485 --> 00:55:12.565]  And there was a set amount.
[00:55:12.865 --> 00:55:14.726]  And it would be exchanged generally in gold.
[00:55:15.226 --> 00:55:17.967]  Or they could make side deals, but it wasn't as easy.
[00:55:18.287 --> 00:55:20.728]  It didn't grease the skids as quickly for commerce.
[00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:24.390]  If you wanted to pay, okay, I'll give you 50 pigs.
[00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.951]  Or I'll give you 3 cows for that slave.
[00:55:27.951 --> 00:55:29.392]  That's where money came from.
[00:55:29.692 --> 00:55:32.013]  And people around the world settled in on silver and gold.
[00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:49.130]  Didn't matter if it was the Aztecs, didn't matter if it was the ancient Japanese, the Chinese, the Visigoths of Germany, the Austriagoths of Austria, the Gauls of what is France today, the Brits of Britain.
[00:55:52.216 --> 00:55:54.378]  The Celts, gold, silver.
[00:55:54.698 --> 00:56:00.724]  The globalists are hoarding gold, silver, hoarding, hoarding, hoarding, hoarding, hoarding, telling you don't get it, you don't want it, you don't want to buy it.
[00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:05.028]  Property, gold, silver, weapons.
[00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:08.091]  These are things that have value in history.
[00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.633]  Information, value.
[00:56:12.395 --> 00:56:16.779]  But they set your role models for you and tell you it's Justin Bieber, it's
[00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.431]  American Idol.
[00:56:23.011 --> 00:56:29.334]  And so people are brought up from being in diapers in front of a television set, being taught, this is what has value!
[00:56:29.694 --> 00:56:32.556]  The number one thing you teach a child is what really has value in life.
[00:56:33.316 --> 00:56:37.659]  Their morals, their information, their mind, and then what true physical wealth is.
[00:56:37.979 --> 00:56:41.021]  But instead, we're just told wealth is being into a football game.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:49.423]  And we go and pay all this money and sit there and feel like we're part of something big, and that our team, our tribe, is winning a war.
[00:56:50.184 --> 00:56:51.744]  It's all socially engineered.
[00:56:53.025 --> 00:56:55.706]  You know, the Drugs Report yesterday gave us a nice plug.
[00:56:56.486 --> 00:56:59.668]  I noticed back on Christmas, actually, my producer noticed this.
[00:57:01.075 --> 00:57:09.817]  Jaren and he thought it was only on his computer so he called his mother and she checked it and the entire website was red links on Christmas except InfoWars.com and Alex Jones.
[00:57:09.837 --> 00:57:11.978]  He has links, you know, to personalities and websites.
[00:57:11.998 --> 00:57:13.759]  A little Christmas present for Matt Drudge.
[00:57:13.779 --> 00:57:15.959]  I don't know how I can give you a Christmas present, Matt.
[00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.680]  You're, you're, you're, but we weren't sure then.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.601]  But thank you for reaching out, Matt, on his official Twitter yesterday.
[00:57:22.756 --> 00:57:24.077]  He only puts out about two a day.
[00:57:25.197 --> 00:57:28.138]  He said, uh, there is no rest when you are involved in reality.
[00:57:28.438 --> 00:57:29.099]  Alex Jones.
[00:57:29.539 --> 00:57:31.080]  He was listening to the Sunday Show, obviously.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.940]  That's when I said that.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.001]  I was going to say there's no rest for the wicked.
[00:57:34.021 --> 00:57:35.481]  And I said, well, I don't see myself as wicked.
[00:57:36.022 --> 00:57:38.383]  But, uh, you know, I'm always tied up in all this information.
[00:57:38.423 --> 00:57:43.565]  And even when I'm home, I can't even spend time with my children because all I'm thinking about is, you know, all this information.
[00:57:43.585 --> 00:57:45.706]  And I said, there's no rest when you're involved in reality.
[00:57:46.146 --> 00:57:49.928]  So he put out the twit, the Twitter, the tweet, uh, there is no
[00:57:51.048 --> 00:58:04.162]  Rest when you were involved in reality Alex Jones and he says a US Texas Set on 2 2011 so he put out my quote in the date and he said does urgent radio six days a week
[00:58:04.966 --> 00:58:08.107]  Web DVDs, Charlie Sheen's Bud.
[00:58:09.007 --> 00:58:10.808]  I guess that's tacked on there.
[00:58:12.108 --> 00:58:16.369]  I did go out and see Charlie a few weeks ago, a week and a half ago, just to see how he's doing.
[00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:20.751]  He is clean and healthy and full of energy like I've never seen him.
[00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:24.912]  Always full of energy, but good to see Charlie's getting back on the right track.
[00:58:25.352 --> 00:58:28.633]  Matt Drudge, thank you so much for the little tip of the hat.
[00:58:28.913 --> 00:58:30.293]  Tip of the hat right back at you.
[00:58:30.613 --> 00:58:31.294]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.759]  It's... What does that say that Matt Drudge is a fan?
[00:58:36.099 --> 00:58:37.201]  That says a lot, doesn't it?
[00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:38.843]  Confirmation right there!
[00:58:38.904 --> 00:58:39.544]  Hoorah!
[00:58:44.372 --> 00:58:48.358]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.047 --> 00:58:54.351]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.712]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.932 --> 00:59:00.136]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:05.983]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:06.283 --> 00:59:08.265]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.425 --> 00:59:11.108]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.448 --> 00:59:17.751]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:19.752]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:20.152 --> 00:59:25.214]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:30.497]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.777 --> 00:59:35.979]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.081]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:39.341 --> 00:59:42.224]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.244 --> 00:59:43.085]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:43.105 --> 00:59:44.006]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:44.026 --> 00:59:45.708]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:09.642]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:11.103]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.884 --> 01:00:12.805]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:17.028]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:21.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:26.889]  We are now back live into our number two.
[01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:31.793]  We're 33 minutes away from Lindsey Williams dropping the biggest bombshells ever.
[01:00:31.813 --> 01:00:32.914]  And believe me, it's big.
[01:00:33.374 --> 01:00:40.200]  And again, most of it's in plain view, but this is inside confirmation on the fact that they have triggered the implosions in the Middle East.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.962]  Not that people didn't have a reason to be mad or revolt.
[01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.785]  The point is, is that it was globalist triggered.
[01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:50.649]  Google, State Department, CIA, British Intel is all over it as well.
[01:00:53.439 --> 01:01:05.589]  All of this is happening right now, and it is meant to basically start disrupting oil production, and to put these countries into geopolitical turmoil, and then to bring oil production online in the United States, but at exorbitant prices.
[01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:11.573]  And this is from, again, two different Williams sources.
[01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:13.795]  And he said all this back in October, four months ago.
[01:01:14.176 --> 01:01:16.517]  He said the Middle East is going to be in turmoil, not so much war.
[01:01:17.735 --> 01:01:20.116]  He said, but then look at China after that.
[01:01:20.196 --> 01:01:32.561]  China's the big one, and now his other big source, who's even more high-powered than the late Fromm, and again, the source is known to yours truly, told him, and people are like, well, why don't you call and get him on?
[01:01:32.941 --> 01:01:33.622]  That's the whole point.
[01:01:33.642 --> 01:01:34.442]  They don't want to come on.
[01:01:36.403 --> 01:01:37.523]  They do it through an intermediary.
[01:01:37.543 --> 01:01:38.764]  That's how globalists operate.
[01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.345]  They just want us to know.
[01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:43.086]  It's part of their enjoyment.
[01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:52.736]  But in the case of Fromm, Lindsey believes he did become a Christian before he died, and was truly repentant for a lot of this.
[01:01:53.256 --> 01:01:54.137]  I don't know about the other one.
[01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:58.461]  In fact, we're going to talk about that with Williams coming up.
[01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.103]  I keep trying to not say the name of the other guy.
[01:02:02.564 --> 01:02:08.029]  I've almost said it a bunch today, and I've got to shut my mouth, because I've known it for over a decade.
[01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:09.330]  But it's Lindsey Soares.
[01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:10.531]  The guy talks to him.
[01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:11.372]  People are like,
[01:02:12.537 --> 01:02:14.179]  Well, just, you know, have him come on air.
[01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:20.846]  I mean, it's kind of like somebody like Charlie Sheen is a fan of my show, and we're friends, so he'll come on the show, or he'll talk to me.
[01:02:21.526 --> 01:02:24.569]  People are like, well, why don't you, you know, get him on other shows or something?
[01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:25.851]  I'm not my brother's keeper.
[01:02:26.692 --> 01:02:32.758]  It's the same thing with connections like this, but this is really, really
[01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:57.425]  Painful news, but it's as Patrick Henry said it's better to know the truth the whole truth and make preparations for it now use the analogy of if you're gonna go coyote hunting out in the field and there's a cliff at one end of it and You know the guy you're going hunting with says be sure and take a flashlight and watch out cuz out there There's a 200 foot drop-off cliff
[01:03:00.014 --> 01:03:02.956]  I mean, is it negative to say, hey, there's a cliff down there at the end.
[01:03:03.556 --> 01:03:08.079]  Watch out, it's a steep drop and you don't really see it until you get right up on it, because there's some bushes over there.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.582]  Just be sure that you use your flashlight until you get in position.
[01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:21.323]  And then you go out there and put your blanket out on the ground, get your tripod ready, turn on the varmint tapes.
[01:03:22.104 --> 01:03:29.669]  For those that don't know, the sounds of coyotes prey, because the coyotes are killing your sheep or whatever.
[01:03:29.689 --> 01:03:34.053]  And then you've got your night vision scope out, or your spotlight, and in come the coyotes.
[01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:38.996]  But the point is that it's not negative to say, hey, there's a cliff over there, you
[01:03:42.005 --> 01:03:43.946]  The reason I tell this story is it's actually a true story.
[01:03:44.706 --> 01:03:46.507]  I use the analogy to make it simpler.
[01:03:46.527 --> 01:03:52.150]  If there's a pit out there, you know, is it negative to tell somebody, hey, there's a pit out there.
[01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.350]  You could fall and break your leg.
[01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.831]  Be sure and use your flashlight.
[01:03:56.412 --> 01:03:57.252]  No, that's not negative.
[01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:58.633]  That's incredibly positive.
[01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:00.994]  Well, thank you for telling me there's a cliff or a pit.
[01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:12.585]  You know, it's like if, uh, you know, your kids are going over to visit other kids and they're playing in the front yard and, you know, the dad says, uh, hey, watch out, guys, don't play football on the street.
[01:04:12.965 --> 01:04:15.806]  Teenagers come through here all the time going 80 miles an hour.
[01:04:16.546 --> 01:04:20.627]  Oh, you're so negative, saying, hey, be careful, kids, don't play football on the street.
[01:04:21.067 --> 01:04:26.248]  Even though this looks like a residential street, these kids drag race up and down it when they get off school every day.
[01:04:26.368 --> 01:04:26.848]  Watch out.
[01:04:27.848 --> 01:04:32.912]  Oh, that's incredibly negative, telling, you know, you know, telling somebody not to play football on the street.
[01:04:35.273 --> 01:04:36.254]  That's what we do here.
[01:04:36.614 --> 01:04:37.855]  Hey, there's a pit right there.
[01:04:38.115 --> 01:04:38.836]  Here's the evidence.
[01:04:38.856 --> 01:04:40.637]  Hey, there's, don't play in the street.
[01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:41.978]  They drag race on this street.
[01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:44.691]  It's the same thing.
[01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:47.935]  We're here positively covering what's happening.
[01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:49.156]  It is frightening.
[01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:50.377]  It is painful.
[01:04:50.498 --> 01:04:51.239]  It is scary.
[01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.101]  But it's a little less scary.
[01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:58.107]  In fact, it's a lot less scary once you know, once you have the info.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:08.607]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:11.149]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.614]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.794 --> 01:05:19.577]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.857 --> 01:05:21.919]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.159 --> 01:05:28.082]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:31.604]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:37.306]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:38.867]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.207 --> 01:05:40.368]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.488 --> 01:05:43.049]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.169 --> 01:05:44.590]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:47.231]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.391 --> 01:05:51.894]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.455]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:06:02.284 --> 01:06:05.907]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.247 --> 01:06:14.374]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:19.137]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.738 --> 01:06:30.567]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:40.189]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.689 --> 01:06:45.750]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.111 --> 01:06:53.292]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.612 --> 01:06:56.013]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.511 --> 01:07:05.135]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.515 --> 01:07:08.518]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:13.542]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:19.828]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.968 --> 01:07:22.191]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.731 --> 01:07:23.011]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:23.031 --> 01:07:23.451]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.491 --> 01:07:23.872]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.892 --> 01:07:24.632]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.652 --> 01:07:26.993]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:43.462]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.762 --> 01:07:48.525]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.905 --> 01:07:58.851]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:06.716]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.027 --> 01:08:17.975]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, Lindsey Williams will be breaking bombshell information here first on this broadcast.
[01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:23.382]  He gave me a detailed briefing last night at about 8 o'clock here at the office over the telephone.
[01:08:25.044 --> 01:08:25.625]  And, uh...
[01:08:27.717 --> 01:08:34.642]  It's basically the total global perspective on what the New World Order is planning to do and what they've triggered in the Middle East.
[01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:40.807]  And I called Lindsey yesterday in the morning to try to get him on and he wasn't even ready yet because he just learned this information.
[01:08:40.827 --> 01:08:42.748]  He wanted to write notes and codify it.
[01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:47.592]  Because I called him and I said, man, four months ago in October.
[01:08:49.116 --> 01:08:49.176]  I'm
[01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:12.285]  A lot of what he was already told in the new info all comes together and the other individual was very clear with him about what's going to happen.
[01:09:12.325 --> 01:09:14.347]  Now, this doesn't mean it has to happen.
[01:09:15.188 --> 01:09:22.355]  A lot of times in war or business or life, if you catch them with their pants down and we're aware of the truth of what's happening,
[01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:26.477]  And everything Williams is going to say is already hidden in plain view in mainstream news.
[01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.858]  But it's a piece here, a piece there.
[01:09:28.179 --> 01:09:32.201]  You get the outside of the jigsaw puzzle and it gets quicker and quicker as you put the final pieces in.
[01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.502]  We've got all the pieces.
[01:09:34.122 --> 01:09:36.744]  We've just got to illustrate it for people so they understand what's happening.
[01:09:36.764 --> 01:09:38.826]  But there's a lot more coming up.
[01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:42.048]  Lindsey Williams will be joining us.
[01:09:42.088 --> 01:09:52.495]  I want to go over the latest developments in the Middle East, North Africa, Gaddafi, what's happening in Honduras, what's happening with the protest around the United
[01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:54.156]  I think?
[01:10:09.144 --> 01:10:09.344]  Do you
[01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:35.326]  By the books, the videos, the bumper stickers, the t-shirts, which are great ways to get the word out at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:35.346 --> 01:10:37.708]  That's how you support us, and also our sponsors.
[01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:43.553]  Also, please support our local AM and FM, local sponsors, or if you're a listener, sponsor us.
[01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:44.694]  Support the show locally.
[01:10:44.714 --> 01:10:46.815]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates, several new ones a week.
[01:10:47.156 --> 01:10:52.700]  Our growth curve is actually frightening, and Drudge is putting out tweets about how great we are.
[01:10:53.621 --> 01:10:54.182]  We just joined us.
[01:10:54.222 --> 01:10:54.762]  I'll read it again.
[01:10:54.802 --> 01:10:55.343]  It's so cool.
[01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:59.046]  Just because I really, obviously, he's the guy who can set so much of the media agenda.
[01:10:59.626 --> 01:11:02.789]  He's an icon in the internet.
[01:11:02.809 --> 01:11:03.930]  I mean, he's the biggest there is.
[01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:08.655]  And we know, we can tell he's been listening and posting our stories for a long time.
[01:11:09.956 --> 01:11:12.198]  And he's done other little tips of the hat.
[01:11:12.218 --> 01:11:14.700]  But this is out in the open.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.884]  His Twitter yesterday, there is no rest when you are involved in reality.
[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.071]  Alex Jones.
[01:11:22.072 --> 01:11:27.077]  It's posted as a quote, and then he has the date of when I said it, Austin, Texas, 2-20-11.
[01:11:27.097 --> 01:11:27.878]  He was listening Sunday.
[01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:33.984]  And he goes on to say, does urgent radio six days a week, web, DVDs, Charlie Sheen Bud.
[01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:35.305]  He posted that at 5-27 p.m.
[01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:55.539]  uh... yesterday and so that is uh... very very interesting appreciate tip of the hat there uh... drudge i mean what does it mean that drudge is a listener you can see the change in his website oh in fact i forgot in two thousand eight two thousand nine two thousand ten no u.s.
[01:11:55.579 --> 01:12:03.823]  media would cover the boulderberg group but george norrie and the epoch times but i forgot starting in two thousand eight drudge was linking to it
[01:12:04.722 --> 01:12:09.944]  And so it's gone from being laughed at just three years ago to now Bilderberg groups out in the open.
[01:12:10.204 --> 01:12:16.886]  And at the time we pointed out that Drudge was the one that took, I mean he was posting some days two of our articles a day on Bilderberg.
[01:12:17.246 --> 01:12:22.908]  But also mainstream articles out of Europe, breaking that news blockade here in the US.
[01:12:23.368 --> 01:12:30.171]  And that's why the globalists want this internet kill switch and to be able to start curtailing quote content farms as Google said three weeks ago.
[01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:33.833]  Like Infowars and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:12:34.713 --> 01:12:38.535]  Sites that aggregate news and information that link to it but also make commentary on it.
[01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:42.798]  They're now putting in algorithms to start trying to block that.
[01:12:42.878 --> 01:12:45.280]  I mean, the system is worried.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.580]  I mean, look at Libya.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.841]  They're jamming right now.
[01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:50.763]  Al Jazeera and other foreign satellite coming in.
[01:12:50.923 --> 01:12:53.365]  In fact, it's so powerful it's jamming in all over the Middle East.
[01:12:54.335 --> 01:12:55.335]  Most areas can't get it.
[01:12:56.116 --> 01:12:58.196]  Well, look what our government's got.
[01:12:58.256 --> 01:13:02.958]  The internet kill switch going in, the EAS emergency alert, takeover systems.
[01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.198]  I mean, it's creepy when they start putting this stuff in.
[01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:10.180]  Because you know they're bringing us into a period of massive turmoil.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.461]  And so the globalists are putting the screws down.
[01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:15.982]  They're trying to start
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.223]  Moving towards restricting free speech.
[01:13:19.263 --> 01:13:23.248]  There's open talks about bringing back the fairness doctrine to restrict free speech on talk radio.
[01:13:24.028 --> 01:13:29.295]  There's open discussions about arresting people that talk about man-made global warming.
[01:13:29.315 --> 01:13:31.778]  That's Cass Sunstein White House regulations are.
[01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:33.099]  I mean they're really
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.242]  Out in the open, Lieberman talking about it, Senator Jay Rockefeller saying we'd be better off without ever having an internet.
[01:13:39.642 --> 01:13:43.983]  He just has habit, you know, that we shut it down and shut down Fox and MSNBC.
[01:13:44.303 --> 01:13:45.923]  He doesn't want any political discourse.
[01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:51.585]  He doesn't want any heated debate, even within the fake left-right paradigm, because that leads to thinking
[01:13:52.285 --> 01:14:07.829]  And then even though it's fake on Fox and MSNBC, most of it, it makes politics a sport instead of football being a sport, and that could lead to people becoming real connoisseurs of politics and getting out of this controlled paradigm.
[01:14:09.989 --> 01:14:15.471]  But what about that quote Drudge picked up that I just said off the top of my head, out of my heart?
[01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:19.152]  There is no rest when you are involved in reality.
[01:14:19.212 --> 01:14:19.772]  Alex Jones.
[01:14:20.899 --> 01:14:21.740]  There is no rest.
[01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:31.777]  I mean, when you only care about beer and entertainment and don't even care about yourself or your own family, and you're just kind of self-serving yourself at a bestial, low-level, animal point.
[01:14:35.785 --> 01:14:40.008]  Then you are so relaxed, you're like a sloth who isn't even alive.
[01:14:40.428 --> 01:14:41.529]  Look at all the big studies.
[01:14:41.569 --> 01:14:43.050]  In fact, let's put it on screen for folks.
[01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:45.572]  TV viewing Alzheimer's.
[01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:47.173]  Television Alzheimer's.
[01:14:47.694 --> 01:14:51.597]  Studies out of the US, England, Canada, you name it, Japan.
[01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:53.058]  I mean, there's hundreds of them.
[01:14:53.378 --> 01:14:55.660]  Scientific studies that when you watch
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.702]  A lot of television, they have the different ratios.
[01:14:59.123 --> 01:15:00.724]  It actually lowers your brain waves.
[01:15:00.784 --> 01:15:04.708]  It actually puts you into a mesmerized, almost dreaming state.
[01:15:05.428 --> 01:15:10.693]  And that it brings on early Alzheimer's because the brain stops making connections.
[01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:15.518]  Because you sleep eight hours a day and you watch five hours of TV, you're still sleeping.
[01:15:16.418 --> 01:15:18.941]  And there's the headline, BBC, TV link to Alzheimer's.
[01:15:20.194 --> 01:15:39.059]  So there is no rest when you are involved in reality, but you're totally alive and every moment is dynamic and burning with creativity and understanding to the point of I almost just fly off the rails every day because reality is so intense and I want to know reality.
[01:15:39.139 --> 01:15:40.399]  I want to know the mysteries of the world.
[01:15:42.022 --> 01:15:43.142]  All right, I said I'd plug sponsors.
[01:15:43.162 --> 01:15:44.123]  I'm going to do that right now.
[01:15:44.243 --> 01:15:46.404]  Interfood, we live in a toxic environment daily.
[01:15:46.424 --> 01:15:51.526]  We're bombarded with chemtrails, fluorides, pesticides, and other equally toxic chemicals.
[01:15:52.146 --> 01:16:03.931]  And with the great line of Interfood products, especially their superfood, it's 20 power-packed superfoods that aren't homogenized, so they're not heated up and don't lose their value, and you absorb almost all of it.

[01:16:24.617 --> 01:16:27.858]  Continuing here, I want to tell you about Safe Castle LLC.
[01:16:28.398 --> 01:16:32.438]  You can check them out at www.prepared.pro.

[01:16:56.083 --> 01:17:00.246]  Prepared.pro for professional crisis preparedness assistance.
[01:17:00.906 --> 01:17:07.190]  Governments constantly, you know, gearing up for crises and building underground bases and storing weapons and food.
[01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:08.951]  But, oh, you're not supposed to do it.
[01:17:09.371 --> 01:17:10.431]  You're not supposed to do it.
[01:17:10.812 --> 01:17:11.952]  It's evil if you do it.
[01:17:13.533 --> 01:17:15.394]  Let me go over some of these headlines here.
[01:17:15.414 --> 01:17:17.856]  Medvedev sees
[01:17:19.537 --> 01:17:21.999]  Fires for decades in Arab world.
[01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:34.008]  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday predicted decades of instability in the Arab world if protesters whom he calls fanatics come to power, adding, no such scenario will be permitted at home.
[01:17:34.408 --> 01:17:42.255]  Medvedev's words fall in sharp contrast to the European Union, which said in a statement on Monday that it deplores the violence and repression against the pro-democracy protesters.
[01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:47.480]  And again, those are dictators, and I'm not against them being overthrown, but what do they get, and who's behind it?
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.101]  The globalists.
[01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:51.805]  And a lot of these folks know how to drive tanks and launch rocket-propelled grenades.
[01:17:52.105 --> 01:17:58.572]  There's obviously special op globalists with sleeper teams in there, blowing the daylights out of Tripoli and other cities in Libya.
[01:18:00.074 --> 01:18:01.856]  I mean, it's just a globalist takeover.
[01:18:02.176 --> 01:18:07.000]  And who knows if they knock out Gaddafi, what new creature they're going to put in.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.922]  Because they didn't put Gaddafi in.
[01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:10.904]  They did put Hosni Mubarak in.
[01:18:10.924 --> 01:18:17.189]  And they knocked him out now, and the next military dictator rolled into place who will get behind all these new wars.
[01:18:18.467 --> 01:18:31.410]  Speaking at a security meeting in Caracas, Medvedev didn't name countries, but he was referring to the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa, which has brought down governments in Tunisia and Egypt, sparked protests in Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, Iran, Morocco, and Jordan.
[01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:33.810]  And it continues.
[01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:36.471]  The Russians also, again, telling the truth.
[01:18:36.491 --> 01:18:42.172]  Reuters, Russia blames Google for stirring Egypt unrest.
[01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:53.969]  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's deputy blamed Google Inc., in an interview published today, for stirring up trouble in the revolution that ousted Egyptian leader Hussein Mubarak.
[01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.869]  Look what they have done in Egypt.
[01:18:55.909 --> 01:19:01.310]  Those highly placed managers of Google, what manipulators of the energy of the people took place there.
[01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.311]  Absolutely, they directed the whole thing and admit it.
[01:19:03.731 --> 01:19:07.232]  Russian CIA, NSA, I mean, it's good to admit it, Google is.
[01:19:07.252 --> 01:19:08.172]  People are like, really?
[01:19:08.552 --> 01:19:11.413]  See how all the stuff we talked about many years ago is now mainstream news?
[01:19:12.213 --> 01:19:14.495]  Glenn Beck saying they're government-run NSA.
[01:19:14.836 --> 01:19:17.458]  But they're not bad because they're spying on you without warrants.
[01:19:17.518 --> 01:19:19.080]  That's liberal to be concerned about that.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.342]  I thought it was being an American or being into freedom.
[01:19:21.883 --> 01:19:23.764]  See the little poison droplets?
[01:19:24.824 --> 01:19:26.906]  Added in, oh yeah, they're CIA, NSA.
[01:19:26.926 --> 01:19:28.087]  They're behind the revolution.
[01:19:28.107 --> 01:19:29.328]  They want to put Muslim extremists in.
[01:19:29.589 --> 01:19:32.071]  But don't be mad at Google, because they don't spy on you, though.
[01:19:32.651 --> 01:19:37.896]  Yeah, they're the NSA, but it's not like, you know, liberals that say, you know, Bush was spying on you.
[01:19:37.976 --> 01:19:38.237]  What?
[01:19:38.257 --> 01:19:39.498]  He just injects that.
[01:19:40.659 --> 01:19:41.800]  Being spied on is good.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.501]  Don't be a liberal.
[01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:45.087]  Well, I'm a conservative.
[01:19:45.107 --> 01:19:46.909]  I don't believe they're spying on me illegally.
[01:19:47.289 --> 01:19:48.310]  Even when they admit they are.
[01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.631]  I'm smart.
[01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:50.672]  I listen to Glenn Beck.
[01:19:51.032 --> 01:19:52.273]  He tells me what to say.
[01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:53.674]  Everything's fine.
[01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:57.377]  But everybody's having to get with the program because of this show and others.
[01:19:57.778 --> 01:19:59.179]  Beck's now following our lead.
[01:20:00.834 --> 01:20:04.676]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:04.736 --> 01:20:08.579]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[01:20:08.939 --> 01:20:13.402]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:20:13.662 --> 01:20:15.563]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:17.024]  It made me feel breathless.
[01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:21.508]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:20:21.908 --> 01:20:22.909]  Nothing did anything.
[01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:26.952]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:20:26.972 --> 01:20:30.415]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.

[01:20:34.198 --> 01:20:38.862]  The episodes became less frequent, and by a month I completely vanished.

[01:21:59.736 --> 01:22:00.897]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:07.643]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:22:07.903 --> 01:22:10.205]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:22:10.466 --> 01:22:15.690]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:18.673]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.895]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:22:21.135 --> 01:22:27.098]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:22:27.419 --> 01:22:30.640]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:36.384]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:22:36.624 --> 01:22:37.945]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:22:38.265 --> 01:22:39.445]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:42.127]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:22:42.267 --> 01:22:43.688]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:22:43.948 --> 01:22:46.331]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:22:46.511 --> 01:22:50.935]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:22:51.056 --> 01:22:52.057]  That's End of America.
[01:22:52.197 --> 01:22:53.538]  The number 3.com.

[01:22:59.494 --> 01:23:02.775]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:03.575 --> 01:23:07.816]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.076 --> 01:23:13.997]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.237 --> 01:23:16.378]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:22.639]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:22.759 --> 01:23:26.102]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:26.162 --> 01:23:27.863]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:28.043 --> 01:23:30.085]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:23:30.225 --> 01:23:34.889]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:23:35.109 --> 01:23:35.729]  Guaranteed.

[01:24:25.219 --> 01:24:27.780]  Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.501]  It's hard to come in with this bumper music and stop it.
[01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:35.822]  I think it's the best performance Merle Haggard's ever done, for the two lines, where he comes in at the end.
[01:24:52.966 --> 01:24:53.767]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:24:53.807 --> 01:24:57.029]  Introducing Lindsey Williams, coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:11.560]  John, I want to play much of the song, so let's go ahead and knock that out of there, but when we come back, I want to come back in with Poncho and Lefty, but perhaps from a good spot like halfway in or something, so we don't play the whole thing, but I want to hear that.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.241]  I got to hear that Merle Haggard now.
[01:25:13.281 --> 01:25:16.563]  I mean, oh my gosh, touch my soul, touch my heart.
[01:25:16.964 --> 01:25:18.104]  Willie Nelson does as well.
[01:25:19.045 --> 01:25:20.366]  And of course, I'm friends with Willie Nelson.
[01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:23.068]  He's a great patriot exposing the New World Order, a great Texan.
[01:25:23.428 --> 01:25:27.211]  But Merle Haggard, oh my gosh, Waylon Jennings, oh, Johnny Cash.
[01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:32.334]  You've got to have some gallows humor here under all this pressure and stress, folks.
[01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:37.337]  And just enjoy the amazing things like Karl Orff's Karina Barana.
[01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.780]  It just shows you the potential of humanity.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:48.385]  But I briefly wanted to get Ted Anderson up here during this short segment for just a few minutes because I want listeners to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.
[01:25:49.146 --> 01:25:54.836]  He bought a bunch of gold and silver a month ago when the globalists artificially driven it down, but the 10-year graph is going straight up.
[01:25:54.936 --> 01:25:56.138]  We knew it would go right back up.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.745]  We've got the inside sources, plus they're devaluing the currency.
[01:25:59.765 --> 01:26:01.248]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know this.
[01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:09.213]  And so Ted told me this morning, he said he is going to run out very soon on the very best gold and silver deals he has.
[01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:16.417]  Because when he runs out of that, then he's got to charge you for what he has bought the new gold and silver for at a higher price.
[01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:18.438]  And he's a big broker, so he gets a good deal.
[01:26:19.298 --> 01:26:24.964]  Regardless, but the deals he's got right now are off the chart, and I want people to get into gold and silver.
[01:26:24.984 --> 01:26:29.990]  If it's one silver coin, one gold coin, whatever the case is, it's time to move into it today.
[01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:31.872]  Gold and silver skyrocketing again.
[01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:35.696]  Oil up 9% in just the first few hours of today.
[01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:37.578]  Ted, where is gold and silver right now?
[01:26:38.186 --> 01:26:47.089]  Well, gold hit a high today of, let me just take a quick peek here, just to see if it went, okay, 1407.60, and silver hit a high today of 3348.
[01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:52.110]  Gold right now is at 1399.70, silver right now at 3291.
[01:26:52.511 --> 01:26:56.592]  I mean, it is strong, out of this world, off the charts, I mean, you call it what you want.
[01:26:57.352 --> 01:27:03.973]  With the Libyan crisis going on and oil prices shooting up through the roof, obviously that bodes very well for precious metals.
[01:27:04.373 --> 01:27:09.794]  I mean, $97, your three videos, some silver dollars, I don't know how people can just beat that.
[01:27:09.834 --> 01:27:13.475]  I mean, first of all, silver is well over into the 30s now.
[01:27:13.915 --> 01:27:17.816]  There's three silver dollars in there alone, and this is less than 30 bucks.
[01:27:18.136 --> 01:27:25.417]  You just can't, you know, a piece, $97 delivered, when you multiply it by three, obviously that's going to be a higher number than that.
[01:27:25.797 --> 01:27:37.164]  But anyways, and the whole thing, the Frank coins at $13.08, the British Sovereigns at $13.86, Walking Liberties at $15.76 now.
[01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:40.086]  There's so much pressure on the bottom side of this market.
[01:27:40.126 --> 01:27:41.327]  It's pressing things forward.
[01:27:41.988 --> 01:27:45.190]  People really need to get involved in the gold and silver.
[01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:51.694]  Obviously, this whole Middle Eastern thing looks like the makings for World War III.
[01:27:52.094 --> 01:27:54.295]  And God hope it don't go there.
[01:27:55.656 --> 01:28:18.486]  The United States has got this printing press running on our shores, we've got this war going on and a complete collapse in the Middle East, oil prices rising, inflation in China, it's like this perfect storm economically, and all that stuff has upward pressure for gold, and we're seeing that right now.
[01:28:18.746 --> 01:28:24.453]  Yeah, I mean, to be clear, you get three silver dollars that are trading for basically $34 a piece right now.
[01:28:25.214 --> 01:28:28.798]  So that is above $100 to get three in the open market.
[01:28:29.359 --> 01:28:36.407]  Three of those for $97 with the shipping included and Obama deception fall the Republic endgame a $60 value.
[01:28:36.447 --> 01:28:37.508]  So that's over a $70 discount.
[01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.411]  On top of it, on that silver dollar deal.
[01:28:41.431 --> 01:28:45.393]  But I hope when folks call, they'll get some of the other great gold coins.
[01:28:45.413 --> 01:28:46.453]  You've got Buffalos.
[01:28:46.993 --> 01:28:50.075]  You've got the Ron Paul gold coins that just came in.
[01:28:50.415 --> 01:28:53.656]  You've got so many other great things out there.
[01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:55.958]  686-2237.
[01:28:56.559 --> 01:29:01.624]  Ted had the biggest response he's ever had yesterday, by the way, breaking all records in phone calls.
[01:29:01.644 --> 01:29:04.046]  So if it's busy, leave your name and number, they'll call you back.
[01:29:04.367 --> 01:29:08.851]  Or you can call tonight, 800-686-2237.
[01:29:08.871 --> 01:29:09.952]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:10.393 --> 01:29:14.797]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Radio Special to get the price from a month ago.
[01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:16.879]  And Ted, you told me you're running out.
[01:29:16.939 --> 01:29:18.341]  How long can you offer these deals?
[01:29:18.621 --> 01:29:28.164]  Well, I'm gonna hold it till midnight tonight and I have to watch and see because I have to look and see what my inventory looks like and what the markets are like in the morning, but I would doubt that I'm gonna be able to hold it.
[01:29:28.304 --> 01:29:32.105]  That's right, you're not like a lot of other gold brokers who get your order and then go out and buy the gold.
[01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:34.886]  You've got it all right there, that's why it ships so fast.
[01:29:34.906 --> 01:29:35.166]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:35.186 --> 01:29:43.989]  I'd say purchase it from Ted and support the network, but I happen to know he makes almost no money on this, so it's just a great deal.
[01:29:44.269 --> 01:29:44.849]  Ted's crazy.
[01:29:45.009 --> 01:29:45.289]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:48.214]  Do the math.
[01:29:48.274 --> 01:29:48.875]  Great job, Ted.
[01:29:48.896 --> 01:29:49.116]  Thank you.
[01:29:51.099 --> 01:29:51.981]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.502 --> 01:29:54.104]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.026 --> 01:29:57.690]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:04.869]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.789]  Number one.
[01:30:06.089 --> 01:30:09.251]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.512 --> 01:30:10.092]  Number two.
[01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:14.935]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.275 --> 01:30:15.716]  It's true.
[01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:20.579]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:21.439]  Number three.
[01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:25.001]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.302 --> 01:30:29.004]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.204 --> 01:30:29.745]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.005 --> 01:30:32.368]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.768 --> 01:30:36.132]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.432 --> 01:30:36.652]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.233 --> 01:30:41.157]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.378 --> 01:30:46.143]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.423 --> 01:30:50.447]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.587 --> 01:30:52.149]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.389 --> 01:30:54.471]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:30:57.254 --> 01:31:01.578]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:01.598 --> 01:31:08.324]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.565 --> 01:31:10.847]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.107 --> 01:31:16.291]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.491 --> 01:31:19.273]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.533 --> 01:31:21.635]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:21.855 --> 01:31:27.779]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.099 --> 01:31:31.302]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.482 --> 01:31:37.006]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.266 --> 01:31:38.587]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.907 --> 01:31:40.028]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.188 --> 01:31:42.729]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:42.869 --> 01:31:46.911]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.091 --> 01:31:51.573]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:51.713 --> 01:31:54.154]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:31:54.294 --> 01:31:57.995]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[01:32:00.436 --> 01:32:03.739]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.100]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.503]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:32:09.723 --> 01:32:15.367]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:32:15.667 --> 01:32:17.649]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:32:17.809 --> 01:32:20.491]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:27.133]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.133]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:32:29.533 --> 01:32:34.615]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:39.876]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:32:40.156 --> 01:32:45.378]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:32:45.538 --> 01:32:46.578]  This will freeze the cost
[01:32:46.578 --> 01:32:46.778]  That's it!
[01:33:06.949 --> 01:33:09.872]  He left his living in a cheap hotel.
[01:33:10.912 --> 01:33:13.715]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[01:33:14.896 --> 01:33:17.638]  So the story ends, we're told.
[01:33:18.679 --> 01:33:21.621]  I don't need your prayers, it's true.
[01:33:22.522 --> 01:33:25.164]  He saved a few, but left it too.
[01:33:26.445 --> 01:33:33.091]  He only did what he had to do.
[01:33:33.211 --> 01:33:35.052]  And now, he's growing old.
[01:33:56.836 --> 01:34:06.279]  Pastor Lindsey Williams has been an ordained Baptist minister.
[01:34:06.299 --> 01:34:08.179]  He went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary.
[01:34:08.219 --> 01:34:12.261]  The Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline began its construction phase in 1974.
[01:34:13.601 --> 01:34:26.611]  And because of Mr. Williams' love for his country and concern for the spiritual welfare of the Pipeliners, he volunteered, he's also a pilot there, Flying People, to serve as a chaplain on the Pipeline, with the subsequent full support of the Alaska Pipeline Company.
[01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:30.334]  Because of the executive status accorded to him as chaplain,
[01:34:30.854 --> 01:34:37.658]  He was given access to information documented in his eye-opening book, The Energy Non-Crisis, unfortunately out of print.
[01:34:37.778 --> 01:34:40.180]  Because to understand what's happening now, you've got to read that book.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.003]  And everything in that book from 1980 that caused oil execs to get fired, you name it,
[01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:47.514]  Now it's all plain view admitted.
[01:34:48.455 --> 01:35:00.202]  After numerous public speaking engagements in western states, certain government officials or concerned individuals urged Williams to put into print what he saw and heard, stating that they felt this information was vital to national security.
[01:35:00.222 --> 01:35:02.703]  And actually Ken Frum actually helped him rewrite the book.
[01:35:02.743 --> 01:35:03.444]  He wrote part of it.
[01:35:03.844 --> 01:35:05.605]  That was the Atlantic Richfield head of operations.
[01:35:05.985 --> 01:35:11.368]  Mr. Williams firmly believes that whoever controls energy controls the economy, thus the energy non-crisis.
[01:35:11.468 --> 01:35:11.609]  Now,
[01:35:12.409 --> 01:35:15.512]  Ken Fromm died back around Christmas of cancer.
[01:35:16.292 --> 01:35:17.473]  We can now say it's Ken Fromm.
[01:35:17.553 --> 01:35:18.354]  I knew it was Ken Fromm.
[01:35:18.834 --> 01:35:22.498]  So did other people like Dr. Stan Monteith.
[01:35:23.098 --> 01:35:27.862]  Monteith's the type to not, even though he believes Williams to go off what he's saying, he went and figured it out and called him himself.
[01:35:28.242 --> 01:35:34.347]  He's also talked to the other guy who's living, was a former oil company CEO, big three.
[01:35:35.508 --> 01:35:37.530]  And there's been a strategic plan.
[01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:40.613]  And as we go to Lindsey, I want to break it down to you this way.
[01:35:41.926 --> 01:35:45.408]  But Zygmunt Brzezinski writes books saying they work in 25 and 50 year plans.
[01:35:46.529 --> 01:35:51.012]  David Rockefeller in his book he wrote five years ago where he admits they want world government.
[01:35:51.632 --> 01:35:52.312]  I forget the name of it.
[01:35:52.373 --> 01:35:56.675]  Will you Google David Rockefeller's autobiography?
[01:35:56.715 --> 01:35:58.036]  I want to put it on screen.
[01:35:58.356 --> 01:36:00.558]  It's a side shot of him on the cover.
[01:36:01.238 --> 01:36:03.159]  We've got it back there but on page 435 he talks about how
[01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:07.543]  Yes, we're going to get rid of sovereignty.
[01:36:07.883 --> 01:36:08.624]  Yes, we're going to do this.
[01:36:08.664 --> 01:36:11.228]  But they talk about 25- and 50-year plans.
[01:36:11.748 --> 01:36:15.513]  And an example of that, because the general public has been taught, oh, Wall Street thinks in quarters.
[01:36:15.813 --> 01:36:23.323]  No, they get you to think in quarters, so you're blind to the larger geopolitical, neo-feudalistic, neo-mercantile system that is the New World Order.
[01:36:24.602 --> 01:36:27.804]  But in the 70s was a key catalyst for the next 50-year plan.
[01:36:28.185 --> 01:36:29.546]  That's when these decisions were made.
[01:36:29.886 --> 01:36:37.411]  And I've read Rockefeller, I've read Kissinger, I've read Brzezinski, basically say almost everything but in a veiled way that Lindsey's been told.
[01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:38.292]  That's the key.
[01:36:38.412 --> 01:36:39.873]  I can verify all this separately.
[01:36:40.113 --> 01:36:42.215]  Just Williams is directly talking to these folks.
[01:36:43.195 --> 01:36:48.359]  Now, and the info Lindsey gives us mirrors what we get from inside Bilderberg.
[01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:49.480]  But here's an example.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.362]  I'm listening to WOAI this weekend.
[01:36:53.507 --> 01:37:21.733]  And they had a newscast about the 50-year water plan for Texas with the federal and state government, and how we were 20-something years into the last plan, and they're going to reassess it and launch a new 50-year plan off the old plan for water wells, reservoirs, desalinization plants on the coast, on and on and on, and how the federal government's doing tests right now with desalinization of saltwater aquifers as a test as part of the 50-year plan.
[01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:30.706]  We are on 50-year timeframes with subsets of 25, where sometimes they readjust or reassess.
[01:37:31.447 --> 01:37:42.274]  And so, talking to Williams last night, I'm going to give him the floor here in a moment, when he briefed me on this, everything he was saying, again, was already public intelligence, but they were filling in the missing pieces.
[01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:52.948]  What Williams wrote about in 1980, about the secret deals with Kissinger and the Arabs to buy T-bills, and how at a time in the future they would shift to the global currency.
[01:37:53.188 --> 01:37:54.831]  That's in Trilateral Commission documents from 1975.
[01:37:58.971 --> 01:38:00.833]  But people would laugh at Williams about that.
[01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:04.456]  Now all of the previous part of the plan is public.
[01:38:04.716 --> 01:38:09.440]  He's going to give you the rest of the plan and what the globalists are telling him is going to unfold.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:16.045]  Now remember, Lindsey Williams was here in October, in November, in December.
[01:38:16.746 --> 01:38:19.188]  And in October, on record, we wrote articles about it,
[01:38:20.505 --> 01:38:24.371]  Oil in the next year, six months to a year, to go to 150 to 200.
[01:38:24.712 --> 01:38:25.913]  Turmoil in the Middle East.
[01:38:26.454 --> 01:38:27.356]  Not even so much war.
[01:38:27.396 --> 01:38:28.517]  He said they told me turmoil.
[01:38:28.617 --> 01:38:29.238]  That's on record.
[01:38:29.859 --> 01:38:31.201]  Destabilization campaign.
[01:38:31.862 --> 01:38:35.488]  And that that would then lead to, quote, China, watch the big one.
[01:38:35.848 --> 01:38:57.479]  Now the other big oil company, former CEO, is giving the full breakdown of this program in the Middle East, what it's going to do in the U.S., what it's going to do in Asia, and the rest of the globalist blueprint and layout for what is about to happen in the next several years and the decade preceding it, or following it.
[01:38:58.799 --> 01:39:03.142]  And so now, Lindsey Williams, I'm going to attempt to give you the floor.
[01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:08.868]  And in fact, you're going to be hosting the show, at least for this segment and the next.
[01:39:09.328 --> 01:39:18.953]  I'll take you out at break, but I'm going to actually go in the control room, only way I can control myself, and I'm going to be in there taking notes on points and questions I have for you.
[01:39:18.993 --> 01:39:27.757]  But I sat there for 30, 45 minutes with you last night and just shut up while you talked, and it was 10 times more powerful than anything we've ever done on the radio before.
[01:39:28.257 --> 01:39:28.837]  Lay it out.
[01:39:29.257 --> 01:39:30.238]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:32.877]  Alex, you're a gentleman.
[01:39:33.457 --> 01:39:34.778]  Thank you so very much.
[01:39:35.878 --> 01:39:39.100]  Crude oil this morning is up $8 a barrel.
[01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:44.283]  Libya, the capital city Tripoli, is burning.
[01:39:45.003 --> 01:39:48.765]  The capital building in Libya is on fire right now.
[01:39:49.646 --> 01:39:52.507]  Qaddafi is in power since 1969.
[01:39:53.648 --> 01:39:57.230]  And this morning, light, sweet crude oil is $108 a barrel.
[01:40:00.621 --> 01:40:03.143]  I have been told that it's going to 150 to 200.
[01:40:03.563 --> 01:40:06.645]  I would think that 200 would be more like it.
[01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:11.248]  Libya has shut off all of its present oil sales.
[01:40:11.448 --> 01:40:13.930]  It says it will carry no more contracts.
[01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:21.414]  1.6 million barrels of oil per day go to Europe, not to America, but to Europe.
[01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:28.719]  This is going to drastically affect America because now Europe oil supplies have got to come from somewhere else.
[01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:35.511]  I would say that the Middle East is pretty much number one item right now.
[01:40:35.672 --> 01:40:42.333]  It's going to go to Iran, and it's going to go, the crisis is going into Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:43.154 --> 01:40:49.656]  So, let me begin as I have been told by the people that have given me information over these years.
[01:40:50.136 --> 01:40:55.637]  As Alex has just said, I want to start from the beginning so you can understand because this is very involved.
[01:40:56.618 --> 01:40:56.678]  In 1901,
[01:40:58.621 --> 01:41:05.445]  The first, what should we say, gusher of oil in the United States of America took place in Beaumont, Texas.
[01:41:06.125 --> 01:41:07.346]  It was called Spindletop.
[01:41:08.306 --> 01:41:09.507]  It went up 200 feet.
[01:41:10.247 --> 01:41:11.148]  At that point,
[01:41:11.829 --> 01:41:13.711]  The major oil companies were formed.
[01:41:13.971 --> 01:41:15.712]  They didn't exactly exist before 1901.
[01:41:15.952 --> 01:41:26.040]  Texaco, Shell, Standard Oil, of course, which is a Rockefeller family, and Chevron had their beginning at Spindletop in 1901.
[01:41:26.661 --> 01:41:36.349]  This set the stage for the beginning of some things that would revolutionize the entire world and the use of crude oil and energy.
[01:41:36.909 --> 01:41:37.850]  Then in 1903 came Henry Ford.
[01:41:40.859 --> 01:41:51.766]  The first assembly line automobile in America and then a man by the name of Mercedes in Germany built the first assembly line German produced automobile.
[01:41:52.567 --> 01:42:03.034]  Now, at that time American oil was 25 cents a gallon or less and our economy was booming beyond everything the world had ever known.
[01:42:04.546 --> 01:42:07.268]  Oil was discovered in the Arab Middle East world.
[01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:19.158]  Now, keep in mind that prior to the time that oil was discovered after 1903, in the Arab world, that the Arabs were nothing but nomads roaming the deserts riding camels.
[01:42:19.818 --> 01:42:27.104]  But 60 years ago, the Arabs began to, for the first time in many, many centuries, to come to the forefront.
[01:42:27.805 --> 01:42:41.093]  This brings us up to where we are now, and as Alex has suggested, I want to just cover a few pointers and then I'll go back and take each one of them individually so that you can know the intricate parts of it.
[01:42:42.093 --> 01:42:44.374]  Ken Fromm of Atlantic Richfield.
[01:42:45.575 --> 01:42:46.596]  This is Standard Oil.
[01:42:47.116 --> 01:42:56.261]  Of course, you recognize Arco, Atlantic Richfield Standard Oil Company, one of America's greats back in those early days, and
[01:42:58.129 --> 01:43:07.335]  The different oil companies, Texaco, Shell, Standard Oil, and Chevron, basically divided up the Arab world.
[01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:13.899]  And each one of them took a country and said, we will go and produce the oil fields in that country.
[01:43:13.919 --> 01:43:15.540]  The Arabs didn't have the money to produce them.
[01:43:16.335 --> 01:43:24.917]  And Mr. Ken Fromm was given the job by Atlantic Richfield of producing the oil field in Kuwait, Dubai, in that part of the world.
[01:43:25.557 --> 01:43:28.938]  Ken Fromm is a gentleman who has given me so much information over the years.
[01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:37.479]  We've spent hours and hours together talking about what is happening in the Arab world, and which I'll go back and give in detail later.
[01:43:37.499 --> 01:43:42.660]  Now, about 1977 through 81 was the Carter administration.
[01:43:43.621 --> 01:43:44.621]  You'll remember that the
[01:43:46.328 --> 01:43:47.429]  I don't know.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:19.231]  We began the indebtedness of the United States of America by a design plan, and I'm so glad that Alex mentioned the 50-year cycle, because this is exactly what we are going through at this time.
[01:44:20.132 --> 01:44:23.956]  I had not thought of that, but Alex, you're right, and I have heard this in many places.
[01:44:24.796 --> 01:44:26.458]  At this point, OPEC
[01:44:27.635 --> 01:44:38.182]  Uh, had an agreement, and it was every nation in OPEC, every major oil producing country in OPEC, uh, agreed to Henry Kissinger's deal with exception of two.
[01:44:39.422 --> 01:44:44.786]  One was Iraq, and that's the reason that Iraq had to be conquered and, uh, taken out.
[01:44:45.246 --> 01:44:46.867]  And the next one was Iran.
[01:44:46.887 --> 01:44:54.412]  Iran has had every kind of problem imaginable because they would not go along with Mr. Henry Kissinger's agreement back in 1977 through 81.
[01:44:57.253 --> 01:45:01.094]  Now, at this point, America began its debt spiral.
[01:45:02.012 --> 01:45:04.973]  And someone needed to buy the United States debt.
[01:45:05.073 --> 01:45:06.453]  Mr. Kissinger knew this.
[01:45:07.233 --> 01:45:13.714]  And as a result, part of the cutting of the deal was that they would buy our T-bills, buy our debt.
[01:45:13.814 --> 01:45:15.635]  In turn, we would buy their oil.
[01:45:16.215 --> 01:45:23.636]  And at this point, it was decided by the elite that the American oil fields would not be produced.
[01:45:23.676 --> 01:45:29.317]  Folks, I hope you're hearing this because it's so significant to what they have told me now is about to happen.
[01:45:29.989 --> 01:45:40.150]  The American oil fields would not be produced because the farmers, we had to buy our oil from them in order for them to turn around and buy our national debt.
[01:45:40.894 --> 01:45:42.516]  And they had to keep it that way.
[01:45:42.896 --> 01:45:45.759]  They closed up oil wells everywhere.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.524]  They shut down major production from the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.
[01:45:51.064 --> 01:45:56.189]  What was the Bakken Oil Preserve and others here in the World 48?
[01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:04.578]  They likewise said, we cannot produce them because if we do, then these other countries will not be obligated to buy our debt.
[01:46:05.552 --> 01:46:17.416]  This also began the time that the elitist, the bankers, and others, the World Bank, the IMF, began to bring about the destruction of America gradually.
[01:46:17.897 --> 01:46:21.558]  You've heard me speak of the devil's messiah plan.
[01:46:22.238 --> 01:46:27.280]  Every bit of this fit into their perversion of the United States of America.
[01:46:27.916 --> 01:46:28.697]  Then came 1970.
[01:46:28.937 --> 01:46:36.022]  I'll just give you a quick overview, and then we'll go back since we have time in the program today to take these one by one.
[01:46:36.682 --> 01:46:38.003]  In 1970, the Alaskan oil was found, somewhere around 1970.
[01:46:38.263 --> 01:46:40.365]  In 1974 through 76, the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline was built.
[01:46:40.385 --> 01:46:42.026]  And in 1976, one of the largest oil fields ever discovered
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:03.783]  In the world, and in particular in the United States of America, it's described in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, Gull Island will blow your mind.
[01:47:04.303 --> 01:47:11.486]  This is a story within itself because after Gull Island was brought in, I was in the room with the oil company officials.
[01:47:12.026 --> 01:47:17.068]  I later asked Mr. Fromm, why don't you bring this oil to the American people?
[01:47:17.908 --> 01:47:19.549]  I knew already why.
[01:47:19.569 --> 01:47:20.369]  They couldn't.
[01:47:21.314 --> 01:47:22.115]  They had no choice.
[01:47:22.475 --> 01:47:26.478]  They could not bring gasoline back down to 25 cents a gallon again.
[01:47:26.498 --> 01:47:29.921]  They could not bring it to 50 or 60 cents a gallon.
[01:47:30.421 --> 01:47:34.805]  They couldn't because the national debt had to be bought by someone.
[01:47:34.845 --> 01:47:36.767]  The Federal Reserve was obligated
[01:47:37.903 --> 01:47:40.144]  And the national debt was growing so greatly.
[01:47:40.645 --> 01:47:47.148]  And now, Gull Island's brought in, and I said to Ken, why don't you bring this oil to the American people?
[01:47:47.508 --> 01:47:49.990]  He said, Chaplain, this is classified.
[01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.271]  We are not going to release that oil.
[01:47:52.511 --> 01:47:57.033]  We will never announce the oil field and the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, what is there.
[01:47:57.513 --> 01:48:01.495]  Until, please, this is so important, put it down in your notes.
[01:48:02.116 --> 01:48:04.097]  You're hearing things today for the first time.
[01:48:04.787 --> 01:48:14.077]  He said we will not produce these oil fields until we have crude oil to somewhere around $200 a barrel.
[01:48:14.858 --> 01:48:16.600]  I said that in different places.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.721]  It got me in trouble.
[01:48:18.662 --> 01:48:25.806]  I later was called on the carpet by the elite and I was threatened and it was mainly because of this one subject right here.
[01:48:26.507 --> 01:48:29.028]  They had to get it to $200 a barrel.
[01:48:29.108 --> 01:48:35.592]  You are going to see $150 to $200 a barrel oil in the very near future.
[01:48:35.612 --> 01:48:39.734]  You're probably talking somewhere in the neighborhood of 9 to 12 months.
[01:48:40.135 --> 01:48:45.858]  They have to take it there because the problems that have developed, they developed them by the way,
[01:48:46.852 --> 01:49:01.365]  The problems and the crisis that they have developed in the Middle East will grow so great until America will not be able to get its oil from the OPEC oil producing countries of the Middle East and Saudi Arabia in particular.
[01:49:01.846 --> 01:49:09.632]  Now Lindsey, Lindsey I want to back up for just a moment and again just let listeners know the new information is coming up
[01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:21.461]  There's new information that deals with how this is going to be played off against the U.S., how China's involved, what the elite have told you the role for the United States is going to be in this.
[01:49:21.881 --> 01:49:34.089]  We can already see this in their admitted globalist plans, but this is directly relating to what's happening now in the Middle East that you predicted from your sources in October of last year, four months ago, on this show.
[01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:38.812]  And so the really big bombshells are coming up, but it's important for people to have the foundation.
[01:49:38.852 --> 01:49:39.413]  Please continue.
[01:49:40.222 --> 01:49:42.103]  Yes, you're exactly right.
[01:49:42.563 --> 01:49:51.006]  All of this fits into the total picture of China, where Mr. Trump told me before he passed away, he said China is the big one, keep your eyes on that.
[01:49:51.206 --> 01:49:53.147]  But now the other sources filled that in for you.
[01:49:54.119 --> 01:49:56.741]  Yes, the other sources just filled this in for me.
[01:49:57.281 --> 01:50:12.952]  I think the bombshell at this point that folks, you definitely need to jot down is once they get that crude oil to the price of somewhere around $200 a barrel, at that point, they will have created so much chaos in the Middle East.
[01:50:13.592 --> 01:50:23.739]  As I mentioned at the beginning of the program, Libya, Tripoli, the capital building in Tripoli, in Libya, is burning right now, this moment, as we speak.
[01:50:24.319 --> 01:50:28.925]  In fact, this morning, Iranian warships went through the Suez Canal.
[01:50:29.186 --> 01:50:30.708]  Egypt finally gave them permission.
[01:50:30.768 --> 01:50:37.736]  Right now, as this program is going on, the latest information I've gotten this morning is that the Iranian warships are through.
[01:50:38.097 --> 01:50:39.919]  This is going to involve Israel.
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:45.182]  That part I don't even want to go into on the program because it would be a program within itself.
[01:50:45.982 --> 01:50:47.362]  Well Lindsey, we got time.
[01:50:47.422 --> 01:50:47.963]  Stay there.
[01:50:48.403 --> 01:50:57.626]  But we're going to discuss this entire strategic program and the next steps in it and where it's going to lead us if we don't expose this system.
[01:50:57.866 --> 01:51:00.527]  This is the end of America as we know it if they're able to do this.
[01:51:01.502 --> 01:51:05.564]  Becoming a modern smoker is now easier and more cost-effective, thanks to Lecig.

[01:52:00.578 --> 01:52:01.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:07.247]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.467 --> 01:52:09.069]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:12.091]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:12.471 --> 01:52:17.555]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.055 --> 01:52:22.759]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.279 --> 01:52:30.204]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.404 --> 01:52:31.245]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.505 --> 01:52:37.868]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.188 --> 01:52:41.029]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.370 --> 01:52:43.270]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:43.591 --> 01:52:44.531]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.551 --> 01:52:44.751]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:47.672]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.173 --> 01:52:49.953]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.336 --> 01:53:03.377]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:11.100]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.622]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:53:16.162 --> 01:53:17.203]  It is glutathione.
[01:53:17.603 --> 01:53:21.264]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:53:21.664 --> 01:53:25.026]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:53:25.646 --> 01:53:30.970]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:38.155]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:38.696 --> 01:53:43.519]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.184]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:47.524 --> 01:53:47.905]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:47.925 --> 01:53:48.125]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.145 --> 01:53:49.367]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.

[01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:14.534]  Now remember, Lindsey Williams, six months before oil, three years ago, went from $50 a barrel, roughly, to upwards of $150, said it was going to happen and named dates.
[01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:17.951]  We got similar intel out of Bilderberg that year.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:48.011]  He said this four months ago.
[01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:49.572]  Last night he briefed me on this.
[01:54:50.472 --> 01:54:53.913]  Now today, in fact I had the articles out there during the break.
[01:54:54.294 --> 01:54:54.674]  Here it is.
[01:54:55.114 --> 01:54:57.295]  We'll put them on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:54:57.315 --> 01:55:00.336]  They're up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:00.356 --> 01:55:04.278]  Medvedev, revolutions could lead to disintegration of Middle East.
[01:55:04.338 --> 01:55:05.338]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:05.358 --> 01:55:06.619]  That's also in AFP today.
[01:55:07.796 --> 01:55:10.138]  Medvedev warns fanatics will take over Middle East.
[01:55:38.196 --> 01:55:40.197]  So it's not just that they're going to be in so much turmoil.
[01:55:40.257 --> 01:55:41.438]  That's going to be the excuse.
[01:55:41.778 --> 01:55:44.040]  And then they're going to cheat the Arabs on that deal.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.821]  Then they're going to stop buying the T-bills.
[01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:47.882]  And that's going to further kill the dollar.
[01:55:47.962 --> 01:55:52.084]  And that's the biggest one, is that they are planning to kill the dollar.
[01:55:52.104 --> 01:55:54.206]  And he's been given the time frame on all of this.
[01:55:54.606 --> 01:55:57.207]  That's the big new giant information.
[01:55:57.547 --> 01:55:59.789]  Not from Ken Fromm, told him similar things before he died.
[01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:03.211]  From the other Mr. X, who was an actual CEO of the big three.
[01:56:04.151 --> 01:56:05.092]  Please continue, Lindsey.
[01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:08.291]  I had no way of knowing any of this.
[01:56:08.811 --> 01:56:11.812]  Let me be very frank and upfront with your listening audience.
[01:56:12.452 --> 01:56:19.414]  I was a mere missionary flying airplanes out in the bush of Alaska at the time they said they were going to build the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[01:56:20.275 --> 01:56:24.016]  The oil companies allowed me as a chaplain, later gave me executive status.
[01:56:24.536 --> 01:56:28.577]  I sat in the board meetings and lived with the elite of the world for three years time.
[01:56:29.317 --> 01:56:33.799]  I could have never known any of the things that Alex has just mentioned.
[01:56:34.463 --> 01:56:51.958]  Had it not been the providence of God, it gave me favor with two of these individuals who are of the elitist of the world, and they in turn have given me information over these 35 years, and the latest one who is still alive, but yet retired, still gives me information.
[01:56:52.578 --> 01:57:00.365]  And when Alex called on yesterday, his producer, I said, here's what I've just gotten hours ago, and that is just what Alex said.
[01:57:01.266 --> 01:57:06.474]  Uh, they are going to, um, they're going to cost the Arabs.
[01:57:07.156 --> 01:57:10.401]  Uh, the Arabs will lose what they put in our T-bills.
[01:57:10.922 --> 01:57:12.585]  The dollar is going to plummet.
[01:57:13.857 --> 01:57:15.258]  And I've given the time date.
[01:57:16.259 --> 01:57:17.319]  This was given to me.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:19.281]  Please put it down on your calendar.
[01:57:19.661 --> 01:57:23.083]  By the end of 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:57:23.523 --> 01:57:37.351]  At the same time, all of these T-bills, securities, Federal Reserve notes that the oil-producing countries of the Middle East in particular, under the agreement by Mr. Henry Kissinger way back 1977 through 81,
[01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:53.303]  The agreement that was made, all of this millions and billions of dollars that they have put into American paper will be lost overnight at the time that they're going to plummet the dollar.
[01:57:53.943 --> 01:57:56.584]  This means that we will not be getting Arab oil.
[01:57:56.664 --> 01:57:59.125]  Folks, are you... I hope you're getting this.
[01:57:59.265 --> 01:58:00.685]  I hope it's sinking through.
[01:58:01.326 --> 01:58:09.909]  You will not be getting oil from the Middle East at the time this happens because they will be enraged with us, plus the fact of the
[01:58:11.072 --> 01:58:19.014]  Muslim Brotherhood going nation after nation after nation as it did in Egypt, as it's doing in Libya.
[01:58:19.494 --> 01:58:21.875]  It's going to go from one nation to the other.
[01:58:21.995 --> 01:58:26.516]  Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, Kuwait, Yemen, Saudi Arabia.
[01:58:26.536 --> 01:58:27.456]  Morocco.
[01:58:28.216 --> 01:58:33.477]  When it hits Saudi Arabia, this is one of America's major oil supplies.
[01:58:33.978 --> 01:58:37.698]  At that point, you will have gasoline at the gas pump, $67.
[01:58:38.139 --> 01:58:39.039]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:39.079 --> 01:58:39.759]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:42.165 --> 01:58:43.348]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:55.771]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.131 --> 01:58:59.634]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.994 --> 01:59:02.276]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.296 --> 01:59:07.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:14.405]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.805 --> 01:59:20.349]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.789 --> 01:59:24.472]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:24.972 --> 01:59:28.975]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.255 --> 01:59:34.779]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:38.162]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.762 --> 01:59:40.203]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.743 --> 01:59:41.164]  It's here.

[02:00:05.373 --> 02:00:09.579]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:11.021]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.802 --> 02:00:12.703]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.344 --> 02:00:17.029]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:21.595]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.859 --> 02:00:27.304]  Lindsey, some of our AM and FM affiliates do not carry this little five-minute segment.
[02:00:27.364 --> 02:00:29.386]  A lot of stations don't want to carry news.
[02:00:29.406 --> 02:00:32.329]  They want to have this segment filled, so I do it over the years.
[02:00:32.369 --> 02:00:39.117]  But I don't want you to get into what you were told about the Middle East, the rioting.
[02:00:40.458 --> 02:00:53.167]  It's admittedly engineered, what that's going to lead to, the double crossing of the Arabs, and then what's going to happen with China, the big announcement, what's going to happen in the U.S., what it's going to do to the dollar from your source, until we come back in the next segment.
[02:00:53.627 --> 02:01:01.633]  In this segment, I wanted to talk to you and just have you for new listeners, recap
[02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:13.939]  The last three and a half years of stunningly accurate predictions that Mr. Fromm and the other gentleman, Mr. L, I'll leave it at that, have told you.
[02:01:14.679 --> 02:01:18.582]  Because I remember you said, yeah, the Middle East is going to be a diversion, it's going to trigger something bigger.
[02:01:18.602 --> 02:01:19.983]  I said, is it war?
[02:01:20.063 --> 02:01:21.605]  They just said, no, it'll be turmoil.
[02:01:22.284 --> 02:01:23.725]  I mean, so they told you that.
[02:01:24.185 --> 02:01:26.806]  Now you see it triggered, it's admitted the globalists have triggered it.
[02:01:27.066 --> 02:01:28.987]  People are like, well these are dictators, aren't you glad?
[02:01:29.027 --> 02:01:30.648]  The point is, why are the globalists triggering it?
[02:01:30.928 --> 02:01:39.352]  We're going to get into that and through all the key info coming up in the next segment, but recap what Mr. Fromm and the other gentleman told you in the last three, three and a half years.
[02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:44.535]  So that you know, you listening audience out there, Alex, that
[02:01:45.672 --> 02:01:47.793]  The elite know all of this in advance.
[02:01:48.033 --> 02:01:49.934]  Every bit of it is planned behind closed doors.
[02:01:50.294 --> 02:01:51.535]  I had no way of knowing this.
[02:01:51.875 --> 02:01:53.416]  I'll give you a few of the key pointers.
[02:01:53.716 --> 02:01:58.319]  Three years ago, I was called on the phone by one of my elitist friends.
[02:01:58.899 --> 02:02:04.542]  And he said to me, very casually, he said, Chaplain, the price of crude oil is going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:09.696]  Everybody that played the Futures.
[02:02:10.257 --> 02:02:14.703]  Everyone that had any prognostic notice idea whatsoever.
[02:02:20.851 --> 02:02:23.333]  Yes, but everybody was saying it was going to $200.
[02:02:23.633 --> 02:02:27.717]  Even I myself was predicting that even though I had not been told it.
[02:02:28.257 --> 02:02:31.560]  He said to me on the phone, it's going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel within two months time.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.380]  It went actually to $134 a barrel.
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:33.701]  And I knew that my reputation was at stake.
[02:02:33.761 --> 02:02:33.862]  Alex?
[02:02:43.249 --> 02:02:53.356]  That was some talk show host that wouldn't even allow me on their show to say it.
[02:02:53.376 --> 02:02:55.618]  They thought it was so ridiculous and outlandish.
[02:02:56.199 --> 02:03:00.061]  But I knew that they've never told me anything wrong in 35 years.
[02:03:00.522 --> 02:03:05.445]  And I said, Alex, I'd like to come on your show and tell the people that it's going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel.
[02:03:08.187 --> 02:03:11.649]  Alex allowed me on his show to say it, even though people laughed at me.
[02:03:12.129 --> 02:03:17.391]  And some of you laughing at me out there in the audience right now, just keep right on laughing, because you laugh last.
[02:03:18.051 --> 02:03:28.056]  I know what's going to happen between now and the end of 2012, and I hope you have sense enough to listen to me, and to listen to everything that Alex is telling you, because the elite have it in plan.
[02:03:28.076 --> 02:03:30.377]  So, it did exactly what he said.
[02:03:31.117 --> 02:03:31.717]  Exactly.
[02:03:31.798 --> 02:03:32.538]  Two months later,
[02:03:33.178 --> 02:03:35.900]  It went to $1.50 a gallon at the gas pump.
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.361]  It went to $1.34 a gallon.
[02:03:38.761 --> 02:03:44.444]  Then, at the same time, he told me, and you can watch this now, you'll see it happen.
[02:03:44.764 --> 02:03:51.988]  He said the price of crude oil for the next two to two and a half years is going to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel.
[02:03:52.568 --> 02:03:54.169]  Everybody again thought I was crazy.
[02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:55.129]  But I didn't.
[02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:56.390]  I wasn't the one that said it.
[02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:57.831]  The elitists told me that.
[02:03:58.471 --> 02:03:59.011]  And it did.
[02:03:59.372 --> 02:04:00.712]  It stated exactly that.
[02:04:01.292 --> 02:04:03.734]  I told you when it was going to start going back up again.
[02:04:04.214 --> 02:04:11.557]  Just about three to four months ago, I came on Alex's show, and I said, I have been told there's going to be a crisis in the Middle East.
[02:04:11.597 --> 02:04:13.878]  Now, folks, please listen to my wording.
[02:04:14.479 --> 02:04:17.180]  I did not say there was going to be a war with Iran.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.261]  Alex, you remember me saying that.
[02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:20.061]  No, it's on record.
[02:04:20.081 --> 02:04:21.422]  You said it's going to be a crisis.
[02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:24.091]  I said just what they told me.
[02:04:24.111 --> 02:04:27.453]  I said there is going to be a crisis in the Middle East.
[02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:31.896]  They did not tell me it would be Egypt, and I didn't say Afghanistan or Egypt.
[02:04:39.847 --> 02:04:40.968]  Now you left off there again.
[02:04:40.988 --> 02:04:57.196]  Let's come back with a full audience and have you recap the purposeful destabilization of the Middle East, the plan to cheat the Arabs, and then the big developments in China and the U.S., the dollar, all of it, the big bombshell coming up next.
[02:04:57.216 --> 02:04:59.217]  We're going to lay out the future globalist program.
[02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:04.331]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[02:05:04.451 --> 02:05:08.493]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:05:08.733 --> 02:05:13.315]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:05:13.355 --> 02:05:18.618]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:05:19.378 --> 02:05:26.421]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:05:29.182 --> 02:05:33.505]  I'm looking for America.
[02:05:34.686 --> 02:05:36.127]  We're American and be proud.
[02:05:36.307 --> 02:05:38.429]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:05:38.469 --> 02:05:43.072]  Land on the free and the home of the brave.
[02:05:43.092 --> 02:05:47.255]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:05:57.129 --> 02:06:04.559]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.879 --> 02:06:08.965]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.225 --> 02:06:09.706]  Number two,
[02:06:10.066 --> 02:06:14.629]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.949 --> 02:06:15.410]  It's true.
[02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:21.114]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.394 --> 02:06:24.696]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.976 --> 02:06:29.459]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:32.061]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:35.804]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.124 --> 02:06:40.827]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.067 --> 02:06:45.831]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:00.285 --> 02:07:01.886]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.926 --> 02:07:04.728]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:07:21.581 --> 02:07:23.922]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:07:24.243 --> 02:07:30.447]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:07:30.768 --> 02:07:32.169]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:07:58.548 --> 02:07:58.988]  Thank you.
[02:08:00.809 --> 02:08:05.853]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.213 --> 02:08:08.475]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.353 --> 02:08:12.195]  Okay, thank you for joining us.
[02:08:12.255 --> 02:08:18.961]  Pastor Lindsey Williams worked in the board meetings with Atlantic Richfield and in meetings with other top oil companies.
[02:08:19.302 --> 02:08:25.948]  Just like in Congress or on an aircraft carrier, the chaplain is like an intermediary and was able to see all this.
[02:08:25.968 --> 02:08:27.029]  He wrote a book about it.
[02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:32.113]  Since then, 30 years later, everything in that book, the Energy Non-Crisis, is now out in the open.
[02:08:32.754 --> 02:08:37.718]  That they could have dozens of pipelines coming out of Alaska, supplying the entire United States for over 100 years.
[02:08:38.299 --> 02:08:40.040]  It's easily recoverable oil.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:40.581]  It's there.
[02:08:40.701 --> 02:08:41.281]  They kept it.
[02:08:42.723 --> 02:08:44.564]  Now, since then, he has these two sources.
[02:08:44.684 --> 02:08:45.825]  One, a former CEO.
[02:08:46.746 --> 02:08:49.428]  And I know for new listeners who have been listening the whole time here, like, we've already heard this.
[02:08:49.448 --> 02:08:50.569]  I'm recapping for new listeners.
[02:08:51.170 --> 02:08:53.272]  People are tuning in, you know, in and out constantly.
[02:08:55.137 --> 02:09:05.433]  Then starting about three and a half years ago, Ken Fromm and the other fella started telling him basically the same information that oil would go from $50 a barrel up to $150.
[02:09:05.893 --> 02:09:07.115]  Then people thought it would go to $200.
[02:09:07.496 --> 02:09:09.619]  His source said, no, now it's going to plunge down to $40.
[02:09:09.819 --> 02:09:10.420]  It went below $40.
[02:09:11.121 --> 02:09:12.401]  Like 32, I saw it.
[02:09:12.922 --> 02:09:18.163]  Then he said for two years it's going to be basically just gradually going up slowly.
[02:09:18.223 --> 02:09:19.083]  Enjoy yourselves.
[02:09:19.124 --> 02:09:20.284]  Go out and have plenty of gas.
[02:09:20.624 --> 02:09:21.884]  But in two years, get ready.
[02:09:22.204 --> 02:09:23.325]  We're now two years later.
[02:09:23.745 --> 02:09:26.986]  Four months ago, Lindsey says they're going to have a crisis in the Middle East.
[02:09:27.006 --> 02:09:27.806]  And I said, war?
[02:09:28.246 --> 02:09:34.688]  He said, no, my sources just said it's going to be in turmoil, but that that is a trigger and a distraction from China.
[02:09:34.788 --> 02:09:35.369]  Watch it.
[02:09:35.509 --> 02:09:36.249]  It's the big one.
[02:09:36.509 --> 02:09:37.509]  But they didn't go further.
[02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:38.830]  Now Mr. Fromm has died.
[02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.950]  The other source
[02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:46.933]  It has gone all the way with the entire plan, and we can see the plan of deindustrialization, moving all the jobs to China.
[02:09:47.314 --> 02:09:50.535]  China in the news today, secretly pressuring the U.S.
[02:09:50.555 --> 02:09:53.757]  government as holders of our debt to allow them to buy up U.S.
[02:09:53.797 --> 02:09:58.439]  companies and block SEC corruption probes and antitrust issues.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.902]  This is about the globalists teaming up with China and muscling out the U.S.
[02:10:03.442 --> 02:10:06.185]  This is about the designed decline of the U.S.
[02:10:06.585 --> 02:10:08.787]  and Lindsey is going to lay it all out now.
[02:10:08.888 --> 02:10:10.930]  Lindsey, let's start back at the Middle East.
[02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:12.892]  The plan program there, that's admitted.
[02:10:13.773 --> 02:10:18.257]  Where this is going, how it's going to unfold, you have the floor for the next 10 minutes.
[02:10:19.844 --> 02:10:23.365]  The standard currency of the world is crude oil.
[02:10:23.626 --> 02:10:37.211]  Please write this down in your notes and I hope you have a pencil and paper and you're taking notes today and you'll put it beside your calendar because barring divine intervention, the elite will do what you're about to hear.
[02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:40.253]  The standard currency of the world is crude oil.
[02:10:40.394 --> 02:10:45.058]  It is not the dollar, it's not the euro, it's not the won, it's not the pound.
[02:10:45.558 --> 02:10:46.639]  It's crude oil.
[02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:47.780]  Crude oil.
[02:10:48.181 --> 02:10:49.542]  Please, put it down.
[02:10:49.742 --> 02:10:52.705]  It's the most important object out there.
[02:10:53.165 --> 02:11:02.474]  The Muslim Brotherhood are being supported by the elite of the world who have the crude oil in the palm of their hand.
[02:11:03.211 --> 02:11:04.232]  Please note this.
[02:11:04.792 --> 02:11:15.197]  What you saw happen in Egypt, what's happening right now in Libya, what is taking place in the United Arab Emirates, is going to spread throughout the entire Arab world.
[02:11:15.857 --> 02:11:16.898]  Most all of OPEC.
[02:11:16.958 --> 02:11:19.799]  Now OPEC includes a few other nations beside the Arab world.
[02:11:20.119 --> 02:11:25.002]  But all over the Arab world, it's going to continue because they are being supported
[02:11:25.891 --> 02:11:27.553]  by the elite of the world.
[02:11:27.933 --> 02:11:31.497]  The elite of the world plan to double-cross the Arabs.
[02:11:32.579 --> 02:11:34.381]  You've never heard this anywhere before.
[02:11:34.921 --> 02:11:41.448]  This will be so new to you until I'm sure you're going to be startled, as you have by many of the other things that these people have told me.
[02:11:41.909 --> 02:11:47.155]  Please note again, the Arab world, the Middle East in particular,
[02:11:47.896 --> 02:11:53.679]  OPEC in general are going to be double-crossed by the elite of the world.
[02:11:53.999 --> 02:12:01.603]  And if any of the Arabs out there are listening to me, I hope your princes, your sheikhs, and your sheikhs, and the people of those countries will listen to you.
[02:12:02.063 --> 02:12:07.206]  Because 70 years ago you were nothing but nomads roaming the deserts riding camels.
[02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:08.927]  You're going back to that again.
[02:12:08.947 --> 02:12:09.808]  I know.
[02:12:09.828 --> 02:12:16.131]  And I must explain what the Muslim Brotherhood is doing later, but I won't take the time right now.
[02:12:16.886 --> 02:12:18.348]  Well, how are you going to be double-crossed?
[02:12:18.749 --> 02:12:33.709]  You remember that Mr. Kissinger went abroad in 1977 through 81 during the Carter administration, cut a deal with every then-producing major oil country in the Middle East, and the deal was
[02:12:34.418 --> 02:12:35.639]  We will buy your oil.
[02:12:35.979 --> 02:12:38.680]  We will no longer produce from America's oil fields.
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:42.461]  Oh, a few little wells here in Yonda.
[02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:46.743]  Yeah, we'll allow them to go, but nothing big whatsoever.
[02:12:46.803 --> 02:12:51.805]  The North Slope of Alaska, we'll just tap a little bit of it, but we're not going to get the big ones.
[02:12:52.145 --> 02:12:53.506]  We will buy from you if
[02:12:54.426 --> 02:12:55.546]  You will do the following.
[02:12:55.887 --> 02:13:05.229]  Number one, you must take a certain portion of what we buy oil from you with, and buy our Federal Reserve issues of T-bills and securities.
[02:13:05.729 --> 02:13:20.134]  This, in turn, paid the interest on the national debt, which at that point, they began to bring in their New World Order, put America into the debt that is in today, and bring America down to the status of a third world country.
[02:13:20.494 --> 02:13:23.875]  It was all planned back as far back as I knew,
[02:13:24.987 --> 02:13:26.628]  In 1971.
[02:13:27.108 --> 02:13:29.029]  They knew it a long time prior to that.
[02:13:29.329 --> 02:13:31.150]  Now how are they going to double-cross the Arabs?
[02:13:31.730 --> 02:13:33.832]  The dollar will be dead by the end of 2012.
[02:13:34.692 --> 02:13:35.532]  Mark my words.
[02:13:35.913 --> 02:13:37.473]  This was given to me by them.
[02:13:37.493 --> 02:13:38.714]  It is prediction.
[02:13:38.914 --> 02:13:39.614]  Put it down.
[02:13:40.155 --> 02:13:50.360]  And whenever it does, what's going to happen to those billions and billions of dollars, maybe in some cases trillions of dollars, worth of key bills and Federal Reserve issues?
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:59.106]  That have been sold to the oil producing countries according to the deal that was cut by Kissinger in 77 through 81.
[02:13:59.547 --> 02:14:01.088]  What will happen to that paper?
[02:14:01.866 --> 02:14:05.608]  Please remember the previous show that I was on with Alex Jones.
[02:14:05.808 --> 02:14:10.191]  I was told if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:14:10.791 --> 02:14:15.594]  This should be a classical statement because it was told to me by Mr. Prom before he died.
[02:14:16.094 --> 02:14:20.177]  Chaplain, if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:14:20.757 --> 02:14:26.000]  And when the Muslim Brotherhood, supported today by the elite of the world,
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:35.026]  Continue to cause conflict all over the Middle East as they have in Egypt and in Libya, and it will spread from one country to the other.
[02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:37.768]  Mark my words, none of them will be exempt.
[02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:41.912]  And when it does, the oil will not be supplied from over there.
[02:14:41.972 --> 02:14:51.619]  The dollar, because when oil goes to $200 a barrel, the American economy is going to be so drastically affected, you think we have problems now financially.
[02:14:52.219 --> 02:14:58.611]  The dollar will collapse toward the end of 2012 and when it does, all of the paper
[02:14:59.747 --> 02:15:01.268]  Please, folks, hear this.
[02:15:01.429 --> 02:15:02.870]  Especially Arabs out there.
[02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:04.932]  The dollar collapses.
[02:15:05.012 --> 02:15:08.715]  The paper of the Federal Reserve will likewise do the same.
[02:15:08.735 --> 02:15:19.024]  And when it does, the double cross of the Arabs, which was started way back in 77, the double cross of the Arab world will take place.
[02:15:19.104 --> 02:15:20.926]  They will be so angry with us.
[02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:21.927]  Do you think
[02:15:23.128 --> 02:15:26.571]  The Muslims have a bone to pick with us right now.
[02:15:26.971 --> 02:15:28.472]  You haven't seen anything.
[02:15:28.732 --> 02:15:30.434]  Just wait until the dollar crashes.
[02:15:30.954 --> 02:15:32.055]  They're double-crossed.
[02:15:32.456 --> 02:15:34.097]  They lose their paper wealth.
[02:15:34.497 --> 02:15:37.560]  They become again what they were 50 to 60 years ago.
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:39.902]  And are you ready for what's going to happen at that point?
[02:15:40.422 --> 02:15:50.790]  This is the reason that Alex has allowed me on his show today, because I've just been told this a matter of... Well, it was hours when I talked with you last night, Alex, but now it'll be a few days.
[02:15:51.431 --> 02:16:06.443]  I was told that at that point we will not be able to get our crude oil from the Middle East and many of the other OPEC oil-producing countries, and in turn, the elite plan to open America's own oil fields that they have known
[02:16:06.983 --> 02:16:09.424]  They've known for 50 years that they were there.
[02:16:09.844 --> 02:16:11.985]  They knew about the North Slope of Alaska.
[02:16:12.366 --> 02:16:17.588]  They knew about Gull Island, which I recorded in my book, and they threatened me never to talk about it again.
[02:16:17.608 --> 02:16:24.291]  Mr. Fromm's gone now, so I'm doing it and hoping that this won't cause problems.
[02:16:24.831 --> 02:16:36.720]  And the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, they will open America's own oil fields, including the Bakken Reserve, including the reserve that is under the Rocky Mountains.
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:37.700]  Have you heard about it?
[02:16:38.101 --> 02:16:40.282]  Two trillion barrels.
[02:16:40.402 --> 02:16:43.404]  It was announced on August the 8th, 2005.
[02:16:43.524 --> 02:16:47.027]  President Bush talked about it, but they have not produced it yet.
[02:16:47.587 --> 02:16:54.595]  All of these oil fields, there is going to be a mad rush to oil production in America because we cannot get it from abroad.
[02:16:55.055 --> 02:17:04.305]  When the Arabs and OPEC are double-crossed, and in turn, you are going to see America begin to produce from its own oil fields, but what's going to happen?
[02:17:04.785 --> 02:17:11.548]  By that time, you'll be paying $7 and $8 a gallon for gasoline, and it will be $200 a barrel.
[02:17:11.968 --> 02:17:18.131]  Our dollar will have already collapsed, and they will bring in, mark my words, a world currency.
[02:17:18.451 --> 02:17:25.334]  It is all a part of the new world order in order to accomplish what they want, Alex.
[02:17:26.957 --> 02:17:32.862]  Well, Lindsey, I mean, just looking at the news here, Qaddafi declares a revolt with tanks and planes.
[02:17:33.542 --> 02:17:39.947]  He's defying the revolt with tanks and planes in rambling speech, blames tyranny of U.S., free drugs for youth.
[02:17:40.708 --> 02:17:42.169]  What did the CIA do in the 60s?
[02:17:43.791 --> 02:17:47.914]  He went on to say he will never leave Libya, he will be a martyr at the end.
[02:17:48.114 --> 02:17:49.455]  White House has nothing to say.
[02:17:49.575 --> 02:17:51.397]  Muslim Brotherhood says kill Qaddafi.
[02:17:51.437 --> 02:17:52.378]  All they want is the power.
[02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:56.139]  Again, they don't completely work for the globalists, they're just being used.
[02:17:56.899 --> 02:18:00.560]  Continuing intelligence agency jamming TV signals.
[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:09.383]  Qaddafi's blocking Al Jazeera into the country and over much of the Middle East with a powerful jammer, saying that it's British intelligence, which a lot of reports show it is.
[02:18:09.883 --> 02:18:19.446]  And it's admitted, and even Medvedev in Russia is saying that this is staged in a destabilization program and that the Middle East could be in flames for years.
[02:18:20.326 --> 02:18:22.067]  And so this will be used as the excuse
[02:18:23.067 --> 02:18:37.957]  To start to change the deal, to cheat the Arabs, you know, that's from the Arab perspective, to stop propping up the dictators, to develop the fields here, and getting into the dollar being phased out.
[02:18:38.057 --> 02:18:47.484]  More on the information that the former oil company CEO told you on that front, and the rising of China to replace us.
[02:18:49.246 --> 02:18:53.008]  There will be no shortages whatsoever on grocery store shelves.
[02:18:53.568 --> 02:18:57.670]  Now, when I said this for the first time about nine months, I was laughed at.
[02:18:58.270 --> 02:19:04.533]  There were many of you survivalists out there, many of them my very personal friends, that said, Lindsey, you're crazy.
[02:19:04.913 --> 02:19:06.414]  We're going to have a shortage of food.
[02:19:06.814 --> 02:19:07.874]  I said, no, we're not.
[02:19:08.395 --> 02:19:08.675]  Why?
[02:19:09.015 --> 02:19:09.875]  I'd been told it.
[02:19:10.696 --> 02:19:12.356]  What are we all going to have a shortage of?
[02:19:12.737 --> 02:19:15.838]  The grocery store shelves will be full, but you're going to go hungry.
[02:19:16.542 --> 02:19:17.603]  Why are you going to go hungry?
[02:19:18.043 --> 02:19:20.105]  Not because there's a lack of groceries out there.
[02:19:20.586 --> 02:19:31.175]  Even with the cold that we've had that's swept down into Mexico and Florida and other places that all vegetables are produced, there's no shortage whatsoever on the grocery store shelves right now.
[02:19:31.475 --> 02:19:31.876]  Why not?
[02:19:32.436 --> 02:19:35.738]  The new world order can bring it in from anywhere in the world.
[02:19:36.159 --> 02:19:36.779]  What does it cause?
[02:19:36.819 --> 02:19:38.540]  It causes the prices to go up.
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:47.306]  Do you realize that in one week's time, garlic, a simple little thing like a garlic bulb, went up 100% last week alone.
[02:19:47.546 --> 02:19:53.670]  Do you realize that crude oil this morning went up $8 a barrel?
[02:19:54.051 --> 02:19:54.931]  All right, stay there.
[02:19:55.452 --> 02:19:55.852]  Stay there.
[02:19:55.872 --> 02:19:59.995]  We're going to come back and get back into the dollar situation in China and what's going to happen here.
[02:20:00.655 --> 02:20:04.898]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.219 --> 02:20:05.819]  Number one.
[02:20:06.119 --> 02:20:09.282]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.562 --> 02:20:10.123]  Number two.
[02:20:10.423 --> 02:20:14.967]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.307 --> 02:20:15.747]  It's true.
[02:20:16.047 --> 02:20:20.611]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:20.931 --> 02:20:21.472]  Number three.
[02:20:21.752 --> 02:20:25.035]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.335 --> 02:20:29.038]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.238 --> 02:20:29.778]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.039 --> 02:20:32.400]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:32.801 --> 02:20:36.163]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.484 --> 02:20:36.684]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.264 --> 02:20:41.187]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.407 --> 02:20:46.171]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:20:56.539 --> 02:20:56.959]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:20:57.019 --> 02:21:00.702]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:08.548 --> 02:21:10.848]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:11.108 --> 02:21:16.329]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:16.529 --> 02:21:19.310]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:21.590]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:27.751]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:28.071 --> 02:21:31.292]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:31.472 --> 02:21:36.993]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:21:37.273 --> 02:21:38.593]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:38.934 --> 02:21:40.094]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:21:40.234 --> 02:21:42.795]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:42.915 --> 02:21:46.996]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:21:47.177 --> 02:21:51.578]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:21:51.718 --> 02:21:54.179]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:22:29.691 --> 02:22:30.753]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.933 --> 02:22:35.320]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:41.229]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for retirement.
[02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:44.695]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.935 --> 02:22:47.536]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.656 --> 02:22:52.557]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:52.717 --> 02:22:55.318]  Call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:04.659 --> 02:24:05.021]  Okay.
[02:24:06.728 --> 02:24:09.179]  I talked a lot with Lindsey last night about...
[02:24:10.208 --> 02:24:31.216]  That's what the globalists are telling him, that turmoil in the Middle East is going to lead to, how that affects the dollar, the time frame for them opening up exploration and the fields that are already there, and the role of China, and then the elite has told Lindsey that after a while though, the U.S.
[02:24:31.236 --> 02:24:32.217]  would be rebuilt.
[02:24:32.237 --> 02:24:37.579]  But I don't want to get into any time frames, any details, exactly what he told you then,
[02:24:38.971 --> 02:24:50.982]  For the rest of the hour, we're going to take calls specifically on these issues with quick questions or comments for Lindsey Williams and people that call from the Middle East will go to the head of the line.
[02:24:51.263 --> 02:24:56.708]  The problem is the Genesis phone system only has six lines, so I'm going to open up our phone lines here.
[02:24:57.884 --> 02:25:00.266]  In about a minute or two, it's a computer system, so we'll have to turn it on.
[02:25:00.306 --> 02:25:01.307]  I just decided to do this.
[02:25:01.868 --> 02:25:04.450]  For people in Libya or in Egypt.
[02:25:04.610 --> 02:25:06.372]  Not if you know somebody there.
[02:25:06.792 --> 02:25:12.738]  If you're in Libya, if you're in Egypt, if you're in the Middle East, we're going to open up a Middle Eastern or North African line.
[02:25:12.758 --> 02:25:13.359]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:25:13.379 --> 02:25:13.639]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[02:25:13.659 --> 02:25:17.863]  And people should be able to call an 800 number for the Middle East, right?
[02:25:23.667 --> 02:25:23.827]  Or no.
[02:25:42.751 --> 02:25:43.732]  We're good to go.
[02:26:04.168 --> 02:26:11.214]  And the Genesis number 800-259-9231 for general callers that have questions for Lindsey Williams.
[02:26:11.234 --> 02:26:18.980]  Now Lindsey, this segment's short, but just boiling it down, because you told me even more last night, how the dominoes will fall, the Middle East,
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:22.101]  Then the oil price, then the opening up for exploration.
[02:26:22.121 --> 02:26:22.981]  Did he give you dates?
[02:26:23.421 --> 02:26:27.122]  Then this rise of China, who we now know is basically running our government.
[02:26:27.162 --> 02:26:31.203]  Even the Associated Press is reporting that, using their debt they hold on us.
[02:26:31.543 --> 02:26:32.544]  The cheating of the Arabs.
[02:26:32.844 --> 02:26:34.164]  Break it down briefly for us.
[02:26:35.084 --> 02:26:35.845]  Time frame.
[02:26:36.425 --> 02:26:40.906]  The end of 2012, you will see the dollar collapse, so I've been told, by the end of 2012.
[02:26:41.166 --> 02:26:47.488]  That means that the Arabs are going to be double-crossed by the end of 2012, sometimes prior to that.
[02:26:48.234 --> 02:26:51.456]  Whatever they are, we don't get the oil supply from the Middle East.
[02:26:51.997 --> 02:27:13.531]  This is going to be a major crisis time for America, because not only is it a crisis for you at the gas pump who are having to drive your vehicle to work every day, but it's going to be a crisis for the truckers, the airlines, and a major crisis for the military of the United States of America, and that's the reason that they're so concerned about the Fifth Fleet right now.
[02:27:14.071 --> 02:27:17.753]  Over there around Dubai in that part of the world.
[02:27:18.153 --> 02:27:20.654]  So you have a time frame of the end of 2012.
[02:27:20.834 --> 02:27:23.035]  One person said to me this morning.
[02:27:23.075 --> 02:27:24.896]  They said Chaplin's gonna take place in 2011.
[02:27:25.096 --> 02:27:30.519]  It was the talk show host called me before your show Alex and I said no it's not.
[02:27:30.919 --> 02:27:32.820]  I said I've been given the time at the end of 2012.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:34.501]  You'd better be ready.
[02:27:35.021 --> 02:27:36.463]  They will do this by then.
[02:27:36.623 --> 02:27:39.626]  China is the big one.
[02:27:40.166 --> 02:27:42.269]  China just made an agreement with Russia.
[02:27:43.029 --> 02:27:48.055]  Now, this puts China out of the picture altogether as far as crude oil and natural gas is concerned.
[02:27:48.415 --> 02:27:50.737]  China just cut an agreement with Russia.
[02:27:50.938 --> 02:27:55.042]  Russia last year became the number one oil supplier of the world.
[02:27:55.808 --> 02:28:02.773]  Saudi Arabia took a second place because of Russia's super deep wells, which I've dealt with that subject before on Alex's show.
[02:28:03.173 --> 02:28:10.178]  And as a result, China now has agreed with Russia to buy all of the crude oil and all of the natural gas that they want.
[02:28:10.498 --> 02:28:12.580]  China will not, do you hear this?
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:18.944]  China will not be affected by the Middle East crisis because they are now getting their oil from Russia.
[02:28:19.464 --> 02:28:23.287]  We will not be able to get it there because they're supplying so much to China
[02:28:23.767 --> 02:28:27.908]  And as a result, we will have to turn to our own oil fields here in America.
[02:28:28.388 --> 02:28:33.729]  A time frame that you must be aware of is the end by the end.
[02:28:33.789 --> 02:28:36.110]  That means you better be ready a long time before.
[02:28:36.730 --> 02:28:44.011]  If you want groceries, you better go to the grocery store and buy six months to a year's supply right now.
[02:28:44.471 --> 02:28:47.732]  Because the dollar is going to collapse in such a manner
[02:28:48.797 --> 02:28:52.018]  See, when crude oil went up this morning, $8 a barrel.
[02:28:52.418 --> 02:28:54.178]  It wasn't the crude oil that went up.
[02:28:54.518 --> 02:28:57.319]  It was the purchasing power over the dollar that went down.
[02:28:57.859 --> 02:29:02.260]  And when that garlic, which went up 100% in one week.
[02:29:02.461 --> 02:29:04.281]  Oh, simple little garlic bulb.
[02:29:04.601 --> 02:29:06.201]  You housewives can see this.
[02:29:06.562 --> 02:29:10.483]  You went to the grocery store, it went up 100% in one week.
[02:29:10.823 --> 02:29:11.623]  What did that do?
[02:29:11.763 --> 02:29:13.203]  It wasn't the garlic that changed.
[02:29:13.263 --> 02:29:15.864]  There's still as many cloves in that garlic as there ever was.
[02:29:16.364 --> 02:29:24.709]  It was the dollar that you purchased the garlic with that is going down in purchasing power regardless of what the Federal Reserve is telling you.
[02:29:25.029 --> 02:29:33.094]  You had better go and do what you're going to do and do it now and get something for your household and prepare for what's going to happen.
[02:29:33.514 --> 02:29:42.019]  China will not be affected by this fuel crisis because they're getting it out of Russia and they're not using the American dollar for it.
[02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:43.720]  All right, so the globalists are on the move.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:48.523]  I want to finish up with this rise of China, decline of the U.S., and then the rebirth of the U.S.
[02:29:48.543 --> 02:29:49.824]  Let's finish up with that, then calls.
[02:29:50.965 --> 02:29:51.865]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.365 --> 02:29:53.966]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.907 --> 02:29:57.569]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.846 --> 02:30:05.468]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.868 --> 02:30:08.870]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:13.893]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:13.913 --> 02:30:20.136]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.296 --> 02:30:22.538]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.078 --> 02:30:23.358]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.378 --> 02:30:23.618]  Bernanke?
[02:30:23.638 --> 02:30:24.038]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.058 --> 02:30:24.778]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:24.798 --> 02:30:26.179]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:41.963 --> 02:30:43.805]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:43.825 --> 02:30:48.891]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.251 --> 02:30:58.361]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:00.842 --> 02:31:04.145]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:04.425 --> 02:31:05.506]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:05.727 --> 02:31:09.911]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.111 --> 02:31:15.756]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:16.056 --> 02:31:18.038]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.218 --> 02:31:20.901]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.241 --> 02:31:27.546]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:27.727 --> 02:31:29.548]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:29.949 --> 02:31:35.033]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:35.293 --> 02:31:40.277]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:40.578 --> 02:31:45.702]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:31:45.922 --> 02:31:48.903]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:31:49.123 --> 02:31:52.064]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:52.124 --> 02:31:52.885]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:31:52.905 --> 02:31:53.485]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:53.545 --> 02:31:57.906]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:57.926 --> 02:32:00.467]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:10.891 --> 02:32:16.074]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.274 --> 02:32:19.055]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.315 --> 02:32:21.436]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:21.637 --> 02:32:27.560]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:31.081]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.262 --> 02:32:36.784]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.045 --> 02:32:38.345]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:38.685 --> 02:32:39.806]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:39.966 --> 02:32:42.528]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:42.648 --> 02:32:46.691]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:46.871 --> 02:32:51.355]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:53.937]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:54.077 --> 02:32:57.059]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:57.079 --> 02:32:57.699]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:14.161 --> 02:33:20.949]  Okay, we gave out the number for people to call from the Middle East, and we see the phone numbers coming in on our computer system.
[02:33:21.250 --> 02:33:23.032]  The Genesis system doesn't have that capability.
[02:33:23.052 --> 02:33:26.416]  Ours does, and we don't see any from the Middle East.
[02:33:26.436 --> 02:33:27.697]  We see some from other countries.
[02:33:28.838 --> 02:33:37.042]  Uh, but, uh, specifically, I mean, I guess if you have family in the Middle East and they've been telling you what's happening, that's okay as well, but I know we've got listeners in the Middle East.
[02:33:37.522 --> 02:33:40.743]  Much of those places, though, still have shut down their internet, especially Libya.
[02:33:41.323 --> 02:33:41.884]  Uh, but the number's 512-646-1776.
[02:33:45.717 --> 02:33:48.259]  I know folks are living on $2 a day on average there as well.
[02:33:48.599 --> 02:33:51.401]  But if somebody does call in from the Middle East, we'll try to go to you very, very quickly.
[02:33:51.421 --> 02:33:51.761]  512-646-1776.
[02:33:51.861 --> 02:34:01.348]  If you can get through on 877-789-ALEX or 877-789-2539, you're welcome to.
[02:34:01.708 --> 02:34:11.055]  But specifically on those numbers I just gave, if you're in the Middle East with comments or any intel for us, I've got, of course, loaded phones on Genesis just with questions for Lindsey Williams.
[02:34:11.936 --> 02:34:13.557]  Not only is our radio broadcast
[02:34:13.757 --> 02:34:18.660]  And this outreach with information funded by you, these videos will wake folks up.
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:29.506]  And if you watch Obama Deception and Part 2 of it, Fall of the Republic, it's basically Obama Deception 2, it shows how the globalists are positioning us for collapse into the world government in their own statements.
[02:34:29.546 --> 02:34:31.828]  And it dovetails with everything Lindsey Williams is covering.
[02:34:32.168 --> 02:34:39.172]  Check them out on the online video bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com or call toll-free if you want to call one of the great folks here in our
[02:34:39.172 --> 02:34:39.612]  I don't know.
[02:35:01.155 --> 02:35:04.217]  You are the Resistance, V for Victory, InfoWars.com.
[02:35:04.257 --> 02:35:07.260]  I think these are the most handsome bumper stickers we've ever put out.
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:10.702]  These are basically available at cost at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:11.022 --> 02:35:12.123]  Let's get these out to people.
[02:35:12.143 --> 02:35:15.005]  And that's what I wanted to talk to Lindsey about, was solutions.
[02:35:16.387 --> 02:35:28.075]  Because if we're aware of this program, if we're aware of what the globalists are doing, then people politically can stop it and understand the grand design by having the blueprint.
[02:35:29.136 --> 02:35:32.799]  Normally when Lindsey gets new information, you know, he puts it out on a CD.
[02:35:32.859 --> 02:35:33.919]  It's quicker than a book.
[02:35:33.959 --> 02:35:34.900]  His book's out of print.
[02:35:35.961 --> 02:35:36.882]  Or a DVD.
[02:35:37.802 --> 02:35:39.363]  But that takes a few weeks to produce.
[02:35:40.044 --> 02:35:43.686]  And normally when he's ready, he calls me because now he's ready to get the information out.
[02:35:43.726 --> 02:35:46.248]  But I happened to call him right when he'd gotten this information.
[02:35:46.668 --> 02:35:49.671]  But he's going into production next week on this.
[02:35:50.371 --> 02:35:54.314]  And it's going to break down all these new developments.
[02:35:54.814 --> 02:35:55.315]  We're good to go.
[02:36:10.931 --> 02:36:11.391]  We're good to go.
[02:36:28.317 --> 02:36:30.198]  They can pre-order right now if they wish.
[02:36:30.358 --> 02:36:35.260]  You can either call our toll-free number, or you can go to the website and pre-order.
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:45.704]  And in the order that the orders are received, we will ship out the moment that the editing has been done on the DVD and the VCR.
[02:36:45.744 --> 02:36:51.547]  We're going to have both available to you as a unit.
[02:36:51.887 --> 02:36:53.608]  Okay, so that's Prophecy Club.
[02:36:53.868 --> 02:36:54.908]  That's prophecyclub.com.
[02:36:55.048 --> 02:36:56.549]  And do you happen to have the number in front of you?
[02:36:57.715 --> 02:37:05.923]  888-TOLL-FREE 888-799-6111 and you'll hear an American operator.
[02:37:06.223 --> 02:37:08.185]  And we will give that out again before you leave us.
[02:37:08.225 --> 02:37:10.867]  We're going to be going into some overdrive today into the fourth hour.
[02:37:11.448 --> 02:37:13.209]  We're getting honored to have Lindsey Williams here with us.
[02:37:13.289 --> 02:37:20.295]  I want to get to calls and not shortchange them, but Lindsey, finishing up with
[02:37:21.196 --> 02:37:30.702]  The time frame, you said they're going to rise China up, then they're going to start the exploration here in the next few years, then you're going to see a big decline in the U.S.
[02:37:31.343 --> 02:37:44.111]  as they suck everything out of the economy, everything is based on petrol, based on oil, and this is going to be a vertical integration, a consolidation of wealth, but then your source said that later they're going to build the U.S.
[02:37:44.191 --> 02:37:44.671]  back up.
[02:37:44.731 --> 02:37:45.832]  What's the time frame on that?
[02:37:47.336 --> 02:37:48.997]  I did not give a time frame on that.
[02:37:49.037 --> 02:37:56.179]  It'll all depend on how they're able to open up what they want to open up the advancement of China.
[02:37:56.219 --> 02:38:00.781]  Keep in mind that if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:38:01.001 --> 02:38:03.742]  And this is the way that they will double-cross the Arabs.
[02:38:04.302 --> 02:38:12.369]  Remember also that George Bush Senior, Daddy Bush, was the ambassador to China prior to that time.
[02:38:12.429 --> 02:38:15.491]  Please go back and look this up and get some information on it.
[02:38:15.691 --> 02:38:16.772]  Research it for yourself.
[02:38:17.253 --> 02:38:20.115]  I don't have time to give it to Dave, though we'll do a whole section on this.
[02:38:20.555 --> 02:38:22.257]  George Bush Senior, Daddy Bush,
[02:38:22.717 --> 02:38:28.601]  The Great Mr. New World Order was the ambassador to China from the United States of America years ago.
[02:38:28.721 --> 02:38:33.064]  Prior to his being ambassador, China was a closed society.
[02:38:33.564 --> 02:38:39.608]  The Great Wall of China divided them from everybody, and China did not do business with the outside world.
[02:38:40.089 --> 02:38:52.517]  George Bush Senior, Daddy Bush, opened up China to the world and made it the great power that it is today, and he was the first one to announce that there would be a new world order.
[02:38:53.058 --> 02:39:07.618]  And the globalists have done everything they can to position the industry, the power, to have China be the owner of our debt, teamed up with the private Federal Reserve, the second biggest owner, and now we covered it earlier, if you guys can find that AFP or AP headline, China
[02:39:08.519 --> 02:39:14.965]  Secretly using influence on the SEC, on the Treasury Department, on the federal government, to let them buy up U.S.
[02:39:15.025 --> 02:39:22.232]  companies, to let them create oligopolies, to have the SEC leave them alone, to allow them to basically buy this country up.
[02:39:22.473 --> 02:39:23.514]  There's AFP.
[02:39:23.994 --> 02:39:28.098]  Cables show China used debt holdings to press U.S.
[02:39:28.278 --> 02:39:29.339]  leaked diplomatic cables.
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:34.844]  Vividly showed China's willingness to translate its massive holdings of U.S.
[02:39:34.904 --> 02:39:44.572]  debt into political influence on issues ranging from Taiwan's sovereignty to Washington's financial policy dealing with Chinese companies in the U.S.
[02:39:44.992 --> 02:39:46.873]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:39:46.933 --> 02:39:48.895]  I mean, this is the globalist plan.
[02:39:48.935 --> 02:39:49.916]  We've been made dependent.
[02:39:50.136 --> 02:39:51.037]  We're being taken over.
[02:39:51.397 --> 02:39:53.579]  Is this not high treason by the globalists, Lindsey?
[02:39:54.204 --> 02:40:07.768]  It positively is, and the thing that the average American doesn't realize is that when we moved our industry to China, for instance, General Motors, whom you, as a taxpayer, bailed out in the United States of America, they were bankrupt.
[02:40:08.129 --> 02:40:10.209]  General Motors and Chrysler, you bailed them out.
[02:40:10.729 --> 02:40:16.231]  General Motors will sell more automobiles in China this year than they sell in the United States of America.
[02:40:16.531 --> 02:40:21.253]  Now, what happens when General Motors, Chrysler, uh, Caterpillar,
[02:40:22.273 --> 02:40:24.594]  The biggest one on the New York Stock Exchange, Caterpillar.
[02:40:25.254 --> 02:40:41.898]  Whenever these companies move to China and build these multi-million dollar, billion dollar plants, do you realize that the agreement with China is that, yes, we'll let you come to China, yes, we'll give you cheap labor, but you must give us all of your patents.
[02:40:42.018 --> 02:40:42.978]  Did you hear this?
[02:40:43.558 --> 02:40:47.459]  Boeing, when they moved to China, they had to give all of their patents.
[02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:58.754]  Well, Clinton gave him, along with Rumsfeld when he was in private companies in the mid-90s, the ICBM secrets, the submarine-launched Trident secrets.
[02:40:59.114 --> 02:41:00.355]  This is a total sellout.
[02:41:00.375 --> 02:41:08.759]  Now, we've got Mohammed in the Middle East, and I want to go to him here in just a moment and other callers.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:11.901]  But, Lindsey, I promise to go to calls.
[02:41:12.341 --> 02:41:19.867]  I'm going to have to get you back up sometime this week or next week just to talk about solutions.
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:23.001]  Yeah, really, I have only covered a fraction.
[02:41:23.021 --> 02:41:28.262]  I mean, I haven't even told of the time that Ken Prom was fired because of my book, Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:41:28.662 --> 02:41:35.263]  I haven't even dealt with the only person that ever told this story apart from me, which was probably, please go and research this.
[02:41:35.363 --> 02:41:41.285]  In American opinion, back in 1980, Alan Spang came to Alaska after Ken Prom had been fired.
[02:41:41.345 --> 02:41:42.325]  Ken was so mad.
[02:41:42.725 --> 02:41:43.365]  We're good to go.
[02:41:58.792 --> 02:41:59.653]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:26.451]  It's good to be talking to you.
[02:42:26.551 --> 02:42:28.931]  I've been a long time listener while I was in the States.
[02:42:28.991 --> 02:42:29.711]  How are you doing today?
[02:42:30.192 --> 02:42:30.612]  I'm good.
[02:42:30.632 --> 02:42:35.293]  So what are you witnessing there in Cairo, and what's your view on what Lindsey Williams is talking about?
[02:42:36.193 --> 02:42:38.434]  Well, let me say this.
[02:42:38.494 --> 02:42:40.675]  I want to say this to all the people in the States.
[02:42:41.055 --> 02:42:49.537]  If they didn't know, you got almost 100,000 Americans living in Egypt, and frequently visit Egypt.
[02:42:49.577 --> 02:42:52.018]  And I'll say this, not one American
[02:42:52.893 --> 02:42:55.974]  Yeah, one of the... I mean, do the Egyptians know this is a staged event?
[02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:22.179]  Absolutely.
[02:43:22.699 --> 02:43:31.705]  Let me tell you, Alex, the Egyptians know nothing about a group called the, uh, the, the, the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:43:31.765 --> 02:43:33.526]  They have, they know nothing of this.
[02:43:34.406 --> 02:43:40.070]  A matter of fact, they say, they say it's, it's like CIA or American.
[02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:41.611]  Okay.
[02:43:42.191 --> 02:43:43.032]  That's number one.
[02:43:43.292 --> 02:43:46.754]  Number two, I would like to say this to all the people out there.
[02:43:46.774 --> 02:43:48.155]  Um,
[02:43:49.855 --> 02:44:00.111]  The majority of people who was in this so-called Liberty Square, the majority of these people, Alex, had no idea about a revolution.
[02:44:00.151 --> 02:44:01.333]  They were busted, paid to go there.
[02:44:05.257 --> 02:44:14.265]  And if you ever frequent the Middle East, you'll know that these Arab people who are family, they frequent places together.
[02:44:14.285 --> 02:44:17.688]  They'll be outside all day, hundreds at a time.
[02:44:18.169 --> 02:44:21.412]  So it's nothing to get a few thousand people in a square.
[02:44:21.832 --> 02:44:25.454]  No, no, they said millions and it was 50,000 according to experts that looked at the crowd.
[02:44:25.754 --> 02:44:28.136]  But Google admits they were there for the CIA.
[02:44:28.456 --> 02:44:31.678]  They admit that they sent in Alberti the week before it all started.
[02:44:31.698 --> 02:44:33.679]  Again, we're not saying Mubarak was good.
[02:44:34.019 --> 02:44:44.366]  The point is, they are admittedly overthrowing it as the first domino, as we said a month ago, to put the Middle East in fire so the Egyptian people know what's going on.
[02:44:46.087 --> 02:44:51.270]  Another thing I want to bring out, Alex, and you're right on there, and I want to say this, Alex.
[02:44:52.533 --> 02:45:02.541]  One thing that the Western world is not saying about Mubarak is the fact that there's many Egyptians who wanted Mubarak to stay.
[02:45:02.581 --> 02:45:08.865]  I'll tell you this, Mubarak is starchly against the eugenics program and have been on record for this for years.
[02:45:08.885 --> 02:45:13.429]  They got mad at him in the early 90s when he wouldn't start sterilizing people.
[02:45:14.486 --> 02:45:15.327]  Exactly!
[02:45:15.827 --> 02:45:25.493]  And the babies are healthy there, the people are healthy there, and I'll tell you, the water is not the cleanest in the world, but these people are fairly healthy compared to any other people in the Western world.
[02:45:26.214 --> 02:45:41.804]  I'll tell you this, they're very family-oriented, and on top of that, there's another thing that people didn't know there, and it surprised me while I was here, Alex, is that there's many Americans, after leaving the military,
[02:45:42.483 --> 02:45:47.347]  Come to the Middle East, get contracts, and work within the military.
[02:45:48.007 --> 02:45:49.749]  Make big, big money over there.
[02:45:49.869 --> 02:45:55.133]  And Americans could come over and actually work under these people in the Egyptian military.
[02:45:55.793 --> 02:45:58.595]  So, there's a lot of facets to this.
[02:45:58.976 --> 02:46:00.477]  There's a lot of brothers and sisters.
[02:46:00.577 --> 02:46:02.798]  And yourself, you're right on point.
[02:46:03.539 --> 02:46:04.800]  For you not to be in the Middle East,
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:13.806]  You may have some good contacts because you're not in the Middle East and obviously you're able to articulate what's going on even in the Middle East, but I want to say this.
[02:46:15.267 --> 02:46:24.693]  Americans have no idea what's going on on the outside of America and you don't know until you go someplace else.
[02:46:24.713 --> 02:46:28.256]  No, exactly, but any comments on what Lindsey Williams is saying?
[02:46:30.197 --> 02:46:34.200]  A matter of fact, I want to thank Lindsey because
[02:46:34.853 --> 02:46:36.954]  The last thing he said is key.
[02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:45.479]  The last thing he said about what's going on with the oil and how they're going to double cross them.
[02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:51.143]  And let me tell you, all the Egyptians and the other Middle Easterns knew that it was staged.
[02:46:51.957 --> 02:46:58.385]  And now they're starting to realize that they were props in America in the Western World Games.
[02:46:58.965 --> 02:47:01.208]  And it's not going to end up like they think it is.
[02:47:01.268 --> 02:47:06.835]  These people, these people have some level of integrity and fight in them.
[02:47:07.876 --> 02:47:12.061]  And I'll tell you, when they find out that they were used
[02:47:13.064 --> 02:47:17.947]  It's going to be all out anarchy on another level, and I don't think the Western world can control it.
[02:47:18.288 --> 02:47:22.130]  All right, no, I certainly, the dominoes were already there of folks being angry.
[02:47:22.811 --> 02:47:23.671]  Now they've triggered it.
[02:47:24.152 --> 02:47:30.396]  Google, I mean, here, is on record, and now Google just admits they're this government front.
[02:47:30.456 --> 02:47:31.457]  It is so incredible.
[02:47:31.497 --> 02:47:36.100]  Thank you for the call, brother Raquel from Cairo.
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:38.442]  Lindsey Williams, your comments on what he was saying.
[02:47:39.451 --> 02:47:45.355]  Well, I am so glad that he confirmed the fact that the Arabs realize that they are going to be double-crossed.
[02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:47.897]  They aren't double-crossed yet.
[02:47:48.537 --> 02:47:55.542]  The big double-cross has yet to take place whenever the dollar collapses and they lose all the paper that they have invested in.
[02:47:57.804 --> 02:48:07.913]  And to be clear, this is going to double cross Americans and others, but we see China and others moving away from the dollar right now.
[02:48:08.193 --> 02:48:13.298]  But your source is saying, end of 2012, the dollar is going to not be the world reserve currency.
[02:48:13.358 --> 02:48:14.559]  What else did he say about that?
[02:48:14.619 --> 02:48:15.280]  Any specifics?
[02:48:15.922 --> 02:48:20.705]  Yes, by the end of 2012 you'll see this double cross with the OPEC oil producing countries.
[02:48:21.126 --> 02:48:23.848]  They in turn will literally become enraged with America.
[02:48:24.208 --> 02:48:26.630]  The call just from Egypt was exactly right.
[02:48:26.670 --> 02:48:28.471]  America will not be able to control it.
[02:48:28.951 --> 02:48:31.453]  Our president has made some drastic mistakes.
[02:48:31.553 --> 02:48:33.795]  But that's part of the plan, is enraging them.
[02:48:33.855 --> 02:48:35.296]  That way the oil gets shot off.
[02:48:36.076 --> 02:48:47.020]  That's exactly right, and then the price of crude oil will be up to $200 a barrel so that the oil companies, the elite of the world, as I call them, can become... You think they're rich now?
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:48.321]  You haven't seen anything.
[02:48:48.741 --> 02:48:52.802]  Wait until oil gets to $200 a barrel, and they produce it from American oil.
[02:48:52.822 --> 02:48:55.103]  Oh, it's a giant tax directly to the globalists.
[02:48:55.123 --> 02:48:55.503]  $200 a barrel.
[02:48:55.964 --> 02:48:57.924]  It's a giant tax directly to the globalists.
[02:48:58.585 --> 02:48:59.105]  It's incredible.
[02:48:59.405 --> 02:49:01.766]  Damon in South Carolina, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:49:01.786 --> 02:49:02.106]  Go ahead.
[02:49:03.274 --> 02:49:04.114]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:49:05.274 --> 02:49:07.175]  I've got a couple of quick points to make to you.
[02:49:07.255 --> 02:49:08.835]  First of all, I was just over in Europe.
[02:49:10.015 --> 02:49:12.516]  Flew over to the former Soviet Union, Republic of Belarus.
[02:49:12.816 --> 02:49:14.836]  Stopped by in Austria along the way.
[02:49:16.036 --> 02:49:24.598]  Gas there, get this, okay, is 12.95 euros a liter, okay, which was all going down with the Egyptian crisis.
[02:49:25.238 --> 02:49:25.958]  That's over $18 American.
[02:49:29.738 --> 02:49:31.399]  For a liter of gas over there.
[02:49:31.879 --> 02:49:36.462]  And gas has always been more expensive over there anyways, but that's going to go through the roof when that happens.
[02:49:36.562 --> 02:49:38.943]  And in Belarus, it was twice as much for a liter.
[02:49:39.183 --> 02:49:40.584]  Well, Damon, I don't mean to interrupt you.
[02:49:40.604 --> 02:49:41.564]  I'm going to put you back on hold.
[02:49:41.584 --> 02:49:44.045]  We're going to skip this network break, so stations should carry it.
[02:49:44.406 --> 02:49:45.046]  I misunderstood.
[02:49:45.086 --> 02:49:46.587]  We had two callers from the Middle East.
[02:49:46.907 --> 02:49:50.309]  Not just Brother Recall from Cairo, but Mohamed.
[02:49:51.009 --> 02:49:52.490]  Mohamed, where are you calling us from?
[02:49:55.999 --> 02:50:01.722]  Well, I'm currently in the European country, but Alex, I cannot tell you where it is.
[02:50:01.742 --> 02:50:03.082]  Okay, your phone is really bad.
[02:50:03.483 --> 02:50:06.244]  Sir, can you talk slowly for us?
[02:50:06.264 --> 02:50:07.304]  Because your phone is really bad.
[02:50:07.344 --> 02:50:08.445]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:50:08.465 --> 02:50:14.307]  Hello?
[02:50:14.708 --> 02:50:15.928]  Yes, there's a delay.
[02:50:15.948 --> 02:50:16.569]  Can you hear me now?
[02:50:16.589 --> 02:50:18.109]  I can hear you better.
[02:50:18.189 --> 02:50:19.470]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:50:22.907 --> 02:50:31.071]  Yes, I have, you know, recently come from Bahrain, and I'm currently in the European country, but I'm not going to disclose this.
[02:50:31.131 --> 02:50:33.992]  Okay, you're in a European country, you recently came from?
[02:50:34.072 --> 02:50:34.912]  In Bahrain.
[02:50:34.932 --> 02:50:37.033]  Okay, so you recently came from the Middle East, go ahead.
[02:50:37.473 --> 02:50:37.873]  Bahrain.
[02:50:37.893 --> 02:50:40.354]  Bahrain, okay.
[02:50:40.875 --> 02:50:48.378]  So, what I want to tell you is that the DMC regime is really incorrect.
[02:50:48.996 --> 02:50:57.639]  But, you know, I'd like to, you know, ask him from the front of you, because, you know, he is, you know, a religious person.
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:10.985]  Can he, you know, tell us, if I look at, you know, my Islamic religious script, the time for your coming is really near, and most of the people are waiting for that, and this is, you know, the time when the things are going to be set up for everything.
[02:51:11.605 --> 02:51:13.288]  So there is a religious point and all this.
[02:51:13.328 --> 02:51:13.869]  You don't care?
[02:51:14.250 --> 02:51:15.051]  No, I understand.
[02:51:15.151 --> 02:51:16.113]  What do you think?
[02:51:16.133 --> 02:51:19.058]  Sir, sir, what do you think about the demonstrations?
[02:51:19.078 --> 02:51:20.180]  Do you think they're staged?
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:22.463]  What's your view of what Lindsey Williams has said?
[02:51:23.908 --> 02:51:26.730]  Look, Alex, there is no doubt it is staged.
[02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:32.693]  There is no doubt that it is a stage because it is a progression of ten years.
[02:51:33.093 --> 02:51:41.037]  In the 1990s, you know, the rebels were incensed for Tufan and, you know, that communism was... Listen, Mohammed, Mohammed...
[02:51:42.478 --> 02:51:44.358]  Mohammed, I appreciate you trying to call.
[02:51:44.378 --> 02:51:52.540]  I'm going to put you on hold and see if your Skype gets better or whatever internet connection you're using from 6,000 miles away to get through to us.
[02:51:52.940 --> 02:51:55.240]  Well, we're going to see if it gets better in a moment and try to go back to you.
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:52:00.121]  But there's another call from a Middle Easterner, a Muslim, saying, of course they know it's staged, Lindsey.
[02:52:01.501 --> 02:52:01.721]  Yes.
[02:52:03.662 --> 02:52:06.082]  Damon, while his phone might get better, let's go back to you.
[02:52:06.622 --> 02:52:10.283]  So, yes, you're saying you're already seeing the gas prices in Europe explode, Damon.
[02:52:10.876 --> 02:52:16.200]  Yeah, my wife's family's all over there, and they've seen a dramatic increase in fuel over there.
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:23.826]  I think the deal from Russia with China has affected that, because they're not sending as much down in, so of course you have the whole supply and demand issue.
[02:52:24.226 --> 02:52:35.915]  And now with this issue with Libya, which as you said, supplies a lot of the oil to the European Union countries, that's going to get cut off, so you're going to see a major issue there.
[02:52:38.157 --> 02:52:54.962]  And it was just it was all just kind of you know coming You know on as I was over there for two and a half weeks From July to the beginning of all did you hear Lindsay as many listeners did four months ago say this was all coming and lay it all out Yeah, I listen to you every day, so I've called you you and I've talked to many times.
[02:52:55.022 --> 02:52:57.383]  I wanted to to kind of
[02:52:58.611 --> 02:53:25.524]  uh... couch on what uh... lindsey said i want to point out two other things i was the guy that was going to get the uh... optical uh... stimulated uh... luminescence to go to the x-ray scanners at the airport when i'm flying over i told you about that well guess what they shut down all the x-ray scanners and i think what has to do with this what lindsey saying is that they're trying to placate the american public for the time being so they're now kind of you know that's right i talked to some airline pilots
[02:53:27.796 --> 02:53:31.977]  Because somebody in Hollywood flew a private jet out there to pick me up and fly me out there a few weeks ago.
[02:53:32.517 --> 02:53:38.559]  And I was talking to them because they also flew for major airlines and they said, look, they've turned the scanners off at LAX.
[02:53:38.599 --> 02:53:39.339]  They're still off.
[02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:44.541]  And I'm hearing that most places they've basically turned them off because they know it was spurring a rebellion.
[02:53:45.663 --> 02:53:57.370]  But in Austria, in the Vienna airport, they have police dogs everywhere, but in the former Soviet Union where we were, they've heard nothing about our problems with the TSA or the x-ray backscatter scanners.
[02:53:57.390 --> 02:53:59.531]  Well, Damon, I gotta jump, but I appreciate your call.
[02:54:01.492 --> 02:54:01.772]  They can.
[02:54:01.892 --> 02:54:02.532]  And it's not too late.
[02:54:28.970 --> 02:54:30.232]  Their timeline is the end of 2012.
[02:54:30.312 --> 02:54:32.394]  We do have time.
[02:54:32.654 --> 02:54:37.559]  And programs like yours, Alex, are the only hope that we've got of getting this information out.
[02:54:37.579 --> 02:54:44.645]  And when people know the issues, they know the entire picture, then they can do something about it.
[02:54:45.146 --> 02:54:48.229]  You must take care of certain things in your household immediately.
[02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:52.122]  Now we're going to do a final segment coming up here.
[02:54:52.142 --> 02:55:03.374]  We've got five minutes left to take calls and five more minutes, but I wanted just to point out if people do want to pre-order, that DVD should be done the next week to see it all in one place without, you know, news breaks and my interruptions and calls and things.
[02:55:04.455 --> 02:55:09.040]  Though this is interesting and informative as well, you can go to privacyclub.com and pre-order.
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:14.923]  And the name of the new production breaking this down is Lindsey Williams, the Middle East, the rest of the story.
[02:55:14.943 --> 02:55:17.444]  We'll give you the number coming up in the final segment.
[02:55:17.985 --> 02:55:21.427]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls as promised.
[02:55:21.827 --> 02:55:23.168]  Delta in New Jersey.
[02:55:23.528 --> 02:55:24.588]  Delta, you're on the air.
[02:55:24.608 --> 02:55:25.869]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:26.549 --> 02:55:26.870]  Hey, buddy.
[02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:36.455]  Hey, so a question is, I mean, this seems typical playbook that they create the chaos and they play both sides and
[02:55:37.031 --> 02:55:39.360]  They create their order out of chaos.
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:42.913]  Are they, besides the Middle East, do they plan on...
[02:55:43.464 --> 02:55:45.685]  Readiness here in the U.S.
[02:55:45.765 --> 02:55:46.485]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:55:46.505 --> 02:55:47.886]  They're going to bring in economic things.
[02:55:47.926 --> 02:55:49.286]  They're going to cause turmoil here.
[02:55:49.586 --> 02:55:56.189]  That's why they got the police state in place as the solution, because when people riot and burn stuff up, that makes the economy get worse.
[02:55:56.469 --> 02:56:02.752]  Then the globalists get to buy it up for pennies on the dollar and then be the heroes rolling out their federal police and the rest of it.
[02:56:03.272 --> 02:56:07.414]  As Lindsey said, the globalists like to buy things when they're at rock bottom prices.
[02:56:07.454 --> 02:56:07.714]  Lindsey?
[02:56:08.564 --> 02:56:10.425]  Yes, everything you've just said is true.
[02:56:10.665 --> 02:56:20.470]  I haven't even had time to get into this part of it all, but what you're going to see in the Middle East is you're going to see a repeat of Egypt, you're going to see a repeat of Libya, all over the Middle East.
[02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:25.232]  One of the last ones will be Saudi Arabia, and no telling what'll happen there.
[02:56:25.413 --> 02:56:27.974]  At that point, you're going to see the crude oil prices now.
[02:56:28.514 --> 02:56:30.516]  It will spread to America.
[02:56:30.596 --> 02:56:36.321]  We just had a very, very small idea of this in Wisconsin this past week.
[02:56:36.761 --> 02:56:39.483]  I know nothing about whether that was incited or not.
[02:56:39.604 --> 02:56:40.765]  I do not think it was.
[02:56:41.145 --> 02:56:47.190]  But you'll see a repeat of problems across America, just as you're going to see in the Middle East.
[02:56:47.450 --> 02:56:50.433]  Well, they're shutting down half the schools in Detroit.
[02:56:50.473 --> 02:56:56.318]  Many cities are laying off more than half their police and sheriff's deputies, and we haven't even begun to get into this depression yet.
[02:56:57.438 --> 02:56:58.539]  That's exactly right.
[02:56:58.579 --> 02:57:00.780]  It is going to spread to America from over there.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:02.221]  Folks, please be prepared.
[02:57:02.621 --> 02:57:05.923]  You definitely need to do everything that you're going to do and do it immediately.
[02:57:07.364 --> 02:57:12.767]  I don't know how to say anymore, Alex, except that, yes, what's in the Middle East will spread to America, except in a different form.
[02:57:12.867 --> 02:57:14.948]  All right, let's jam in one more call before this hour ends.
[02:57:14.968 --> 02:57:15.669]  We're going to come back.
[02:57:15.889 --> 02:57:18.790]  Let's talk to Fred in Ohio.
[02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:19.551]  Fred, you're on the air.
[02:57:20.291 --> 02:57:21.652]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:57:22.292 --> 02:57:26.655]  But since we know that we've been double-crossed and the Arabs know they've been double-crossed,
[02:57:27.193 --> 02:57:31.120]  And we've got a $25 million bounty on Bin Laden and others.
[02:57:31.621 --> 02:57:38.292]  Why haven't these dictators and kings and ARABs put bounties on these elitists that have done all of this to us?
[02:57:39.195 --> 02:57:41.537]  Well, because then a military would invade them overnight.
[02:57:41.917 --> 02:57:45.279]  The globalists are very aware of that danger of people striking back.
[02:57:45.299 --> 02:57:50.142]  That's why when Saddam Hussein, you know, talked about going after George Herbert Walker Bush, you saw what happened.
[02:57:50.543 --> 02:57:54.825]  It's because they know the globalists run our country, the nuclear weapons, the assassination teams.
[02:57:55.126 --> 02:57:56.527]  I think you answered your own question.
[02:57:56.787 --> 02:57:58.368]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[02:57:58.408 --> 02:58:02.210]  That's a game the globalists, with all their security and the rest of it, want to play.
[02:58:02.511 --> 02:58:05.453]  They want us to get violent, so they have an excuse to crack down.
[02:58:05.693 --> 02:58:07.374]  They're spurring the violence in the Middle East.
[02:58:07.434 --> 02:58:09.155]  All you guys that call for violence constantly,
[02:58:09.195 --> 02:58:10.315]  I don't know.
[02:58:31.098 --> 02:58:32.139]  I deserve a republic.
[02:58:32.179 --> 02:58:32.820]  You deserve it.
[02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:34.822]  Our forefathers fought for it.
[02:58:35.202 --> 02:58:38.265]  And we need to fight with ideas and physically defend ourselves.
[02:58:38.285 --> 02:58:38.865]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:43.049 --> 02:58:44.931]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.472 --> 02:58:48.695]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.683 --> 02:58:54.625]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:58:54.865 --> 02:59:00.908]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:59:01.288 --> 02:59:08.371]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:59:08.671 --> 02:59:13.213]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:59:13.533 --> 02:59:22.020]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:59:22.201 --> 02:59:26.004]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:59:26.464 --> 02:59:32.650]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:59:33.210 --> 02:59:36.651]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:59:37.131 --> 02:59:39.932]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:59:40.813 --> 02:59:49.175]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:59:49.435 --> 02:59:49.876]  Thank you.
[02:59:51.456 --> 02:59:52.616]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:52.997 --> 02:59:54.317]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.037 --> 02:59:58.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:10.814 --> 03:00:11.735]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:12.336 --> 03:00:19.343]  We are now entering overdrive, with your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:19.904 --> 03:00:23.568]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:28.584 --> 03:00:31.666]  We've got some other huge guests coming up later in the week.
[03:00:31.786 --> 03:00:32.647]  Very informative.
[03:00:32.667 --> 03:00:33.667]  Just let me give you a hint.
[03:00:33.787 --> 03:00:35.148]  You want to stay tuned in this week.
[03:00:35.989 --> 03:00:43.254]  This is such an important discussion that we're going to do 30 minutes with Lindsey at the start of the third hour tomorrow and then take another 30 minutes of calls.
[03:00:43.934 --> 03:00:48.197]  He'll be with us for just a few more minutes right now, then we're going to go back to retransmission, but we are live.
[03:00:48.657 --> 03:00:56.183]  Lindsey Williams will be back live tomorrow in the third hour, and we have some other important guests on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[03:00:56.823 --> 03:01:00.866]  One of them a big surprise, I'll just leave it at that, keeping our fingers crossed.
[03:01:01.747 --> 03:01:04.328]  But taking a few final calls here.
[03:01:04.969 --> 03:01:07.751]  Well, briefly, do you want to comment on the guy who was talking about violence?
[03:01:09.122 --> 03:01:10.083]  Oh, positively.
[03:01:10.503 --> 03:01:19.829]  What you're seeing happen right now in Libya, I'm sure you must have heard even on the national news this morning, from airplanes they're shooting at civilians.
[03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:25.473]  Qaddafi says, I positively will not step down under any circumstances whatsoever.
[03:01:25.994 --> 03:01:28.475]  As a result, oil prices went up so much this morning.
[03:01:28.876 --> 03:01:31.798]  Libya sells 1.6 million barrels a day.
[03:01:32.578 --> 03:01:34.179]  And right now, Tripoli is burning.
[03:01:34.239 --> 03:01:38.901]  So, do you think that they wouldn't... All of this is supported by the elite.
[03:01:38.961 --> 03:01:45.803]  What the Muslim Brotherhood is doing, it'll go from nation to nation, and you'll see civilians inspired on.
[03:01:45.843 --> 03:01:47.224]  This is an atrocity.
[03:01:47.984 --> 03:01:53.587]  It breaks my heart to see that this has to happen in order to bring about the plan of the elite.
[03:01:54.227 --> 03:01:59.369]  Well, we'll talk about solutions, too, tomorrow, and some other areas we didn't have time to get into that are key to this whole discussion.
[03:01:59.709 --> 03:02:01.770]  Brian, in Utah, you're on the air, Brian.
[03:02:03.152 --> 03:02:07.214]  Alex and Pastor Williams, thank you both for your service and to your audience.
[03:02:07.254 --> 03:02:20.241]  We must make this interview and the related interviews that Pastor Williams has done go viral through the college campuses, the police, our military especially, and our local and state officials.
[03:02:20.261 --> 03:02:23.302]  This is the globalist plan, teamed up with China to bring us down.
[03:02:24.303 --> 03:02:24.883]  Absolutely.
[03:02:25.643 --> 03:02:30.966]  And, you know, as you were speaking of as well, we the people of the United States must become
[03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:35.471]  Peacemakers to the Arabs and to the Muslim people.
[03:02:36.272 --> 03:02:44.555]  You know, we have to let the Arabs know that we've also been double-crossed and our military has been double-crossed by the Global Parasite Empire scams.
[03:02:45.435 --> 03:02:53.938]  And, you know, our military has been double-crossed by our treacherous politicians and their generals.
[03:02:54.418 --> 03:02:59.320]  Now, you spoke of Henry Kissinger and I'd heard, I don't know if it was you several years ago or someone,
[03:02:59.986 --> 03:03:06.629]  have revealed some of this information about Henry Kissinger being responsible for this deal with the Arabs about oil.
[03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:14.694]  But there was a little bit more focus on the military-industrial complex aspect of the deal with military and bases and things like that.
[03:03:15.334 --> 03:03:17.035]  We'll get more into that tomorrow.
[03:03:17.095 --> 03:03:18.916]  In fact, I'll write a note to do that.
[03:03:18.976 --> 03:03:21.057]  Lindsey, any comments for Brian in Utah?
[03:03:21.317 --> 03:03:22.057]  We've only got about a minute left.
[03:03:22.418 --> 03:03:25.779]  And tomorrow, please have your pencils and paper ready, even your recorders.
[03:03:25.859 --> 03:03:26.520]  Please turn them on.
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:28.562]  And you'll want to get forward.
[03:03:28.662 --> 03:03:37.631]  I'm going to give tomorrow the exact, the amount of oil that has just been announced to me by one of the elite that is in America, which they're going to open up.
[03:03:37.711 --> 03:03:39.173]  I'll tell you where the fields are.
[03:03:39.533 --> 03:03:42.897]  I want to read you the amount of oil that's there from the latest statistics.
[03:03:42.917 --> 03:03:45.019]  Some of it has been put in the congressional records.
[03:03:45.039 --> 03:03:46.401]  You can check it out for yourself.
[03:03:47.725 --> 03:03:48.245]  Absolutely.
[03:03:48.265 --> 03:03:49.746]  We'll also get into solutions.
[03:03:50.606 --> 03:03:52.427]  We'll get into Fromm and his history.
[03:03:52.447 --> 03:03:56.709]  We'll also get into that question about the military bases.
[03:03:56.729 --> 03:04:01.772]  In 30 seconds, Lindsey, the military base agreements with the Arabs in the 70s.
[03:04:02.572 --> 03:04:06.414]  Our military is in dire straits right now.
[03:04:06.914 --> 03:04:09.116]  When this happens, a lack of fuel.
[03:04:09.136 --> 03:04:11.997]  Can you imagine how you run an airplane without jet fuel?
[03:04:12.377 --> 03:04:13.838]  How do you run a ship without diesel?
[03:04:14.658 --> 03:04:18.719]  Uh, it's going to be a startling situation that's going to take place.
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:25.582]  Who knows what they will pull at the same time they bring about this lack of fuel crisis out there.
[03:04:25.942 --> 03:04:28.503]  Let me add just one sense of humor, please.
[03:04:29.243 --> 03:04:30.943]  And I'll give you a challenge to go do it.
[03:04:31.964 --> 03:04:33.424]  There was a bumper sticker the other day.
[03:04:33.444 --> 03:04:35.405]  It said, Pray for Obama.
[03:04:36.085 --> 03:04:37.226]  We're out of time, Lindsey.
[03:04:37.346 --> 03:04:38.947]  If folks want to call that number, it's 888-799-6111.
[03:04:38.967 --> 03:04:42.009]  We're going to have you back tomorrow, my friend.
[03:04:42.049 --> 03:04:43.830]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:46.231]  Key Retransmission starts now.
