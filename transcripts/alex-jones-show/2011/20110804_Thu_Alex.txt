[00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.379]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.099]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.960]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:21.962]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.824]  We are live.
[00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.434]  It is Thursday, the fourth day of August, 2011.
[00:00:42.110 --> 00:01:06.891]  And this came out in the El Paso Times yesterday and it rung a bell and I remembered that we actually broke this story back in April that it came out in federal court documents in Chicago that a top drug kingpin that got extradited here over one of the major cartels in documents, Vicente Zambada Nabella, worked for the U.S.
[00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.334]  government in drug trafficking and documents show that the federal government
[00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:19.564]  For at least five years, allowed them to ship ton after ton of pure cocaine into the U.S., quote, in exchange for information about other cartels.
[00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:26.651]  Yeah, the cartels they're waging war against that aren't part of the cartels that launder the money with the big U.S.
[00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:28.412]  banks that have been caught red-handed doing it.
[00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:33.938]  Just like our so-called government is down in Colombia for a decade knocking out their competition.
[00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:43.860]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso at the time, in 99 and Reuters, went down to meet with the head of the FARC and said, invest your money with us or you'll be invaded.
[00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:45.762]  They didn't invest.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.500]  The head of the FARC was then assassinated.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.381]  The rest is history.
[00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.482]  I mean, this is all hidden in plain view and comes out constantly.
[00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:56.082]  Came out in the 90s in congressional hearings.
[00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:57.663]  Came out in the 80s in congressional hearings.
[00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:00.143]  Came out in the 60s in congressional hearings.
[00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:01.564]  From Vietnam and heroin.
[00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:03.204]  And I can play a newscast.
[00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:05.044]  I shot a special video about it last night.
[00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:07.365]  Breaking it all down.
[00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:13.058]  We're going to be covering that coming up in the second hour of the broadcast today.
[00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.803]  Also the latest developments on a MJTF federally run SWAT team attack.
[00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:20.384]  Mangoes were confiscated.
[00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:25.088]  Raw milk cheese that I can buy at Whole Foods down the street right now.
[00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.070]  Bought some this weekend.
[00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:30.073]  It's just incredible.
[00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:36.278]  Just absolutely incredible that all of this is going on.
[00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:41.422]  And we're going to get Mike Adams to pop in later with us as well.
[00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:48.617]  We have a special guest joining us coming up later in the hour, the prodigy of Mobb Deep.
[00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:56.845]  And of course, he's a legendary hip-hop rapper and has had a lot to say on a lot of different issues.
[00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:59.107]  And we've been trying to get hooked up.
[00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.468]  I heard that he was interested in coming on the show.
[00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:02.369]  We were interested in having him.
[00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.872]  We finally have got him lined up for the broadcast.
[00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:09.335]  So that's going to be coming up in the first hour today.
[00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.149]  And then we're going to get into all of this other incredibly key news.
[00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.331]  Japan to fire top nuclear officials in wake of disaster.
[00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:19.811]  Here in the U.S.
[00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:20.552]  they'd be promoted.
[00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:27.016]  The folks that, quote, screwed up on 9-11 all got promoted, because they didn't screw up, they did a great job carrying out the attacks.
[00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:30.078]  Also, a Swedish man caught trying to split atoms in his home.
[00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:31.198]  How did he get caught?
[00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:37.242]  Well, he had a blog about it and contacted the police when someone emailed him and said this might be illegal, so they've now
[00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:38.483]  I don't know.
[00:03:54.346 --> 00:04:00.508]  Continuing here, 69% say it's likely scientists have falsified global warming research.
[00:04:00.528 --> 00:04:01.609]  That's 69%.
[00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.329]  Ross Mewson, Scientific Poll.
[00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.750]  So their whole fraud is imploding in on itself.
[00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.731]  Good job to everybody out there exposing it.
[00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:14.674]  Also, Ron Paul says Super Congress a monstrous creature and that he can't find it in the Constitution.
[00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:15.094]  No kidding.
[00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:20.298]  And thank God Ron Paul knows how to look at this, Super Congress, and understands it is something new.
[00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:22.199]  Super Congress has bragged.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.423]  They've had committees before that have transferred power that I think was unconstitutional.
[00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:27.684]  This is brazen.
[00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:33.008]  Like Obama launching that new Libya war and saying, A, it isn't a war, and B, I don't need Congress for approval.
[00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.651]  And we'll continue with that information.
[00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:37.632]  We've got some good news.
[00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:43.636]  NRA to sue Feds over ATF intimidation of gun sellers.
[00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:48.148]  And their unconstitutional activities on that front.
[00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.050]  Big economic news coming up as well.
[00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.091]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:54.991]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.012]  Of course, we're streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:01.014]  Don't forget the network site, GCNLive.com.
[00:05:01.094 --> 00:05:02.254]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:08.937]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:09.217 --> 00:05:11.478]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:11.758 --> 00:05:16.942]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:19.924]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:22.286]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:28.430]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.953]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:37.657]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.218]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:40.679]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.380]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.541]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:52.222]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:54.802]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:57.923]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:57.943 --> 00:05:58.563]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:04.166]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:04.466 --> 00:06:08.849]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:16.594]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1998.
[00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:17.835]  We're good to go.
[00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:38.667]  We're good to go!
[00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:04.754]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:05.354]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:09.156]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:09.976]  Number 2.
[00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:14.839]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:15.619]  It's true.
[00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:20.481]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:21.322]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:24.903]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:29.645]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:32.267]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:36.050]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.550]  Number 5.
[00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:41.053]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.317 --> 00:07:50.339]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:52.040]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.362]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:57.143]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:04.388]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:07.790]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.476 --> 00:08:29.122]  Back on April 27th of this year, we ran the headline out of federal documents that were made public in federal court that listeners pointed out to us.
[00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:35.566]  We ran the news story, Top Mexican Drug Lord, I Traffic Cocaine for the U.S.
[00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:43.291]  Government, written by Paul Joseph Watson for Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:50.354]  Now, when I got off the air yesterday, Aaron ran over, Aaron Dykes, and he said, you haven't seen this?
[00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:50.994]  And I said, no.
[00:08:51.014 --> 00:08:54.076]  He goes, well, it's been on Infowars all day, our link to it.
[00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:59.119]  And so I read the report, did some more research, and I said, I think we reported on this.
[00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.760]  And I went and looked it up, and we sure did.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:08.084]  The part that the El Paso Times does not cover.
[00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:23.887]  Is that he and others he's associated with in this cartel have said they also were involved in getting guns and were involved in Fast and Furious and this nexuses it in.
[00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:40.139]  Now, the Associated Press, Florida Papers, of course broke it, I don't know, two, three weeks ago, have all reported that Fast and Furious, ATFE, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, they're always adding new things onto their name,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:10:01.889]  And the FBI and DEA have been involved shipping thousands of guns not just to Mexico but to Miami and other areas to select gangs that are waging covert wars against drug cartels that are not paying their cut.
[00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.091]  And I talked about, of course,
[00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:25.216]  The Reuters report back in 1999, when Richard Grasso, then head of the New York Stock Exchange, traveled, and it mentioned, well, there's a little-known federal law that actually drug money from overseas can be invested in U.S.
[00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:34.181]  banks and the stock market, and he was there encouraging, and it showed the meeting, the head of the FARC, you can dig up the photo, the head of the FARC guerrillas down in Columbia, big beard,
[00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:35.401]  I forget his name.
[00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:36.021]  You can look it up.
[00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.302]  And he said, invest with us or you're going to be invaded.
[00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:39.383]  They gave him a year.
[00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:40.143]  He didn't invest.
[00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:41.383]  They ended up killing him.
[00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:42.424]  And the worst U.S.
[00:10:42.444 --> 00:10:45.285]  military invaded down there, called it drug interdiction.
[00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:51.287]  And it's admitted that they have grids they fly where the government-grown cocaine that's laundered through the U.S.
[00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:52.307]  is left alone.
[00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:55.808]  And then they find fark fields of coca, and those are sprayed.
[00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:57.669]  So it's a business operation.
[00:10:59.295 --> 00:11:00.296]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:02.197]  Vietnam in the coffins full of heroin.
[00:11:02.237 --> 00:11:03.478]  Confirmed congressional hearings.
[00:11:03.838 --> 00:11:10.022]  The 1980s, Iran-Contra shipping guns down there to knock out the drug competition, ship the cocaine back.
[00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:21.109]  The 1996, or was it 97, I remember playing the clips on the radio, of the CIA Inspector General admitting, yes, the CIA shipped in drugs.
[00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:23.210]  This is all on record.
[00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.752]  And Gary Webb, of course, broke it and won the Pulitzer Prize for it.
[00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:31.235]  Had a new book coming out that was going to doubly prove it, what, five, six years ago.
[00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:32.455]  And he had to move.
[00:11:32.496 --> 00:11:33.736]  His house was being broken into.
[00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:34.737]  He said he was being threatened.
[00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:38.380]  He told many people that, including Frederick E. Ross, who's now out of prison.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.561]  We had Rick E. Ross on from prison to talk about it.
[00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:44.264]  From memory, he told Celica Steele he was being threatened.
[00:11:44.464 --> 00:11:45.224]  He told me that.
[00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:49.788]  He asked me to get all these documents and put it up on a website for him.
[00:11:50.368 --> 00:11:51.329]  It was public stuff.
[00:11:52.674 --> 00:11:53.595]  He sent us a disk.
[00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:55.156]  My wife kept saying, we got to get this up.
[00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:57.419]  Back then I had almost no internet technical skills.
[00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:01.663]  Info Wars had a lot of visitors, but we never even got it up.
[00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:03.544]  None of it was secret.
[00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:06.007]  It was just stuff that he put in public presentations.
[00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:06.647]  I want to say that.
[00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:07.548]  Somebody comes and kills me.
[00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:09.070]  I don't know where that disk is.
[00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.731]  It's where I've dropped the ball so many times.
[00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:15.896]  But they, of course, came to his house and shot him twice in the head with a shotgun.
[00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:23.750]  Now, continuing here, so they don't want this information known, but they can't hide it anymore.
[00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:28.820]  This information cannot be hidden anymore.
[00:12:30.544 --> 00:12:55.756]  And so what's now happening is, and we've shown you the ABC newscast, the CBS newscast, the Fox newscast, where they go, yes, the Army and the Marines in Afghanistan, now 90 plus percent of world opium production, it was around 10 percent before the liberation, boy they've sure liberated them now, are giving them the fertilizer, giving them security, and helping them pipe in water even to grow more opium.
[00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:58.798]  So we can get a lot of people addicted.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:16.556]  So the banks can get even more money and then more stereos and computers and jewelry and cars can be stolen by the addicts so that then they can grab the addicts and put them in prison for 10-15 years working for 25 cents an hour in slave labor to drive down wages and displace the country.
[00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:26.603]  Overall economic future, and of course if you look at the big three or four mega private prisons, they're all subsidiaries of the big six mega banks who openly launder the drug money.
[00:13:26.643 --> 00:13:37.831]  So the drug dealers ship the drugs in, use the police to knock out their competition, and then put the users in prison when they're caught using the product they shipped in and use them for slave labor.
[00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:44.136]  It's a program where you make money, consolidate power, corrupt police, all the way down the line, and it works really well.
[00:13:45.444 --> 00:13:48.988]  Now going back, uh, what, five, six years ago, the interviews are all public.
[00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:54.595]  Celica still, uh, a high level, well, the highest level DEA agent in all of Latin America.
[00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:55.917]  Former sniper.
[00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:57.900]  Uh, Vietnam.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.922]  Uh, then later a police officer.
[00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:03.238]  He comes out and says, here's the deal.
[00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:08.482]  This is what I've been told by my DEA contacts and my Los Zetas contacts.
[00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:12.705]  They're Mexican military, trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, School of Americas.
[00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:17.709]  And they're going to start a war down there as soon as Calderon gets elected.
[00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:18.770]  And he said he will be elected.
[00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.611]  It's going to be staged.
[00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:28.738]  And they're going to knock out the three or four cartels that are big that won't pay their money in the United States, just like what's happened with the FARC in Colombia.
[00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:35.520]  And of course, he's one of the main sources for the work of Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.901]  And he wrote the book Powder Burns, now out of print.
[00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:42.963]  But the point is, is I believed him, but I still was like, man, this is wild.
[00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:48.746]  I mean, they're going to have a total collapse in Mexico, and then it's going to be used to start collapsing the Southwest.
[00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:52.908]  Well, then about a year after he said that, the SPP documents got released.
[00:14:53.248 --> 00:14:58.911]  The Judicial Watch sued and got the North American Union Security Prosperity Partnership documents from the Banff Canada meeting.
[00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:09.520]  In 2006, they got him in 2007, it's in my film Endgame, and they said we'll use flu fears, terror fears, and collapsing Mexico to create a continental security perimeter.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:20.445]  Well, earlier this year, Obama publicly created that continental security perimeter in the name of fighting the collapse of what's happening in Mexico and the guns and the drugs and the murder.
[00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:25.541]  And Shelley said six years ago that the government was shipping guns in.
[00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:35.589]  And before the ATF set him up three years ago, he said on this show, and those interviews are all there in the articles, that they were accelerating shipping guns in and that they were going to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:15:36.289 --> 00:15:38.631]  And he went and protested and made a big stink about it.
[00:15:39.352 --> 00:15:41.453]  And for years he went to gun shows.
[00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.135]  I've been at the gun show with him here in Austin.
[00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:47.098]  He usually didn't even have guns to sell and sold bumper stickers, t-shirts, his book.
[00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:53.938]  And then he needed money because he's a retired DEA schoolteacher living in a trailer down in South Texas.
[00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:57.219]  And he started selling off his gun collection.
[00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.960]  And what former cop doesn't have 50 guns?
[00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:02.661]  What the government would call an arsenal.
[00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:06.422]  And so he began selling a shotgun, a rifle, to get money.
[00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:08.023]  And he even talked about it.
[00:16:08.743 --> 00:16:12.504]  A divorced guy, again, he in his own words, living in a trailer, schoolteacher, South Texas.
[00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:16.366]  That's what happens, not saying it's bad to live in a trailer, but the point is he needed money.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.862]  So boy, they set him up for selling a couple shotguns legally.
[00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:22.363]  A private sale.
[00:16:22.403 --> 00:16:25.105]  They said that he was really a gun dealer and it was all a big setup.
[00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:30.269]  They sent him to prison and we, you the listeners, really tried to help him out with his defense.
[00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.251]  And so I want to thank you for doing that.
[00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:37.654]  I know it's a thankless thing when you a lot of times help people, but we do appreciate you.
[00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:38.755]  But they still sent him to prison.
[00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:40.616]  And so that's what came out of it.
[00:16:40.656 --> 00:16:43.198]  So we're on record breaking all of this down.
[00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:45.800]  And here we are, top Mexican drug lord.
[00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:50.581]  I traffic cocaine for the U.S.
[00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:51.221]  government.
[00:16:53.202 --> 00:16:57.064]  And that is the report up at Infowars.com, April 27, 2001.
[00:16:57.945 --> 00:17:00.746]  And it goes on.
[00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:10.132]  The logistical coordinator for the top Mexican drug trafficking gang that was responsible for purchasing the CIA torture jet that crashed with four tons of cocaine
[00:17:12.213 --> 00:17:12.253]  on
[00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:38.730]  Sam Badata Garcia, one of the top kingpins of the Sinaloa drug trafficking organization.
[00:17:39.211 --> 00:17:50.499]  And it goes on to say that he released the documents at federal court, kind of like Hal Turner released the documents at federal court, that he really wasn't a white supremacist leader for the last decade, attacking yours truly every week.
[00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:55.883]  Uh, but that he was a national security agent, highest level, top secret for the FBI.
[00:17:56.304 --> 00:18:00.227]  And the FBI testified, yes, he is our man, please don't send him to prison.
[00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:02.329]  And the judge said, I don't care.
[00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:04.851]  He threatens state judges, he's going to jail.
[00:18:05.832 --> 00:18:11.557]  So they certainly, and of course they went ahead and burned him after hackers got into Hal Turner's computer.
[00:18:12.543 --> 00:18:24.534]  Patriots, by the way, and did release the fact that he was a federal agent above the highest level, a national security level agent not even known to exist publicly until then in the FBI.
[00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:27.217]  It's the same thing with this guy.
[00:18:27.237 --> 00:18:37.407]  It doesn't matter if he was running Fort Benning, Georgia-trained commandos in Mexico to consolidate the drug trade and make sure the prices got jacked up, because they don't like prices falling.
[00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:38.951]  Doesn't matter.
[00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:40.612]  The truth doesn't matter.
[00:18:40.632 --> 00:18:41.173]  It will continue.
[00:18:41.193 --> 00:18:44.995]  It's like Geraldo Rivera stands there with a Marine Corps colonel and says, you help grow the open.
[00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:45.896]  He says, I sure do.
[00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:46.876]  It's for America.
[00:18:48.297 --> 00:18:48.597]  You bet.
[00:18:48.617 --> 00:18:49.798]  It's for your children.
[00:18:50.498 --> 00:18:51.779]  Now, continuing documents.
[00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:56.342]  Feds allegedly allowed Sinaloa cartel to move cocaine into U.S.
[00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:57.142]  for information.
[00:18:57.823 --> 00:18:58.663]  You always love the spin.
[00:18:58.683 --> 00:19:01.525]  When they get caught, they're like, well, yeah, well, we've been doing this.
[00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:03.006]  So you give us info on other cartels.
[00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:04.187]  Yeah, that you're knocking out.
[00:19:04.747 --> 00:19:06.149]  Five years, they admit.
[00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.770]  U.S.
[00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:18.525]  federal agency allegedly allowed the drug trafficking cartel to bring in tons, several tons of cocaine in the United States in exchange for information about rival cartels, according to court documents filed in the U.S.
[00:19:18.565 --> 00:19:19.146]  federal court.
[00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:34.295]  The allegations are part of the defense of Vicente Zambidal, I keep mispronouncing this, Zambidal Nabila, who was extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in Chicago.
[00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:38.317]  The court in Chicago held a status hearing today and ordered the U.S.
[00:19:38.337 --> 00:19:41.760]  government to respond to the motion containing the allegations.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.501]  And it goes on with the documents.
[00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:45.443]  And so it breaks it all down.
[00:19:45.543 --> 00:19:47.145]  So here you have it.
[00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:54.296]  And other big drug cartel leaders have come out and said, yes, we were involved in this same group and the government would ship us the guns directly.
[00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:55.778]  Of course they did.
[00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:59.944]  It's a 500 plus billion dollar a year operation in the U.S.
[00:20:00.004 --> 00:20:00.304]  alone.
[00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:06.889]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.

[00:20:30.382 --> 00:20:39.648]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.688 --> 00:20:40.429]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:46.633]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:47.594]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.634 --> 00:20:50.736]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:22:12.524 --> 00:22:13.805]  InfoWars.com.
[00:22:14.225 --> 00:22:14.746]  We're good to go.
[00:22:34.488 --> 00:22:40.132]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.633 --> 00:22:50.120]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.701]  The war is here.
[00:22:52.021 --> 00:22:53.442]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.922 --> 00:22:55.664]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[00:23:03.892 --> 00:23:07.214]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and security systems can't prevent forced entry.

[00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:40.019]  This capitalism?
[00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:46.243]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:46.363 --> 00:23:47.124]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:50.266]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:51.226]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:52.587]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:24:01.533 --> 00:24:07.315]  If you leave me I won't miss you And I won't ever take you back
[00:24:29.275 --> 00:24:33.580]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me.
[00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:44.212]  By the way, we've been talking to their folks, and we were going to get him on yesterday.
[00:24:44.973 --> 00:24:54.221]  Time zone issues, and I wanted to have some time before we got him on so we could queue up some music and properly introduce him, but he's scheduled to be on this hour or next hour.
[00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:56.022]  If not, I'm sure we'll get him on in the next few days.
[00:24:56.423 --> 00:25:01.087]  Prodigy of Mobb Deep, iconic, you know, top rapper, hip-hop.
[00:25:02.027 --> 00:25:06.089]  And the reason I'm interested in getting him on is because he's spoken out for 9-11 Truth very eloquently.
[00:25:06.449 --> 00:25:14.212]  He's exposed all these Jay-Z and others always talking about the Illuminati and, you know, pushing that out there like it's a good thing.
[00:25:14.252 --> 00:25:16.592]  He's really stepped up and criticized that.
[00:25:16.872 --> 00:25:17.933]  So I want to get him on the show.
[00:25:17.953 --> 00:25:18.833]  I look forward to it.
[00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:25.316]  But once something goes haywire like it did yesterday, who knows if it'll be today or tomorrow or sometime in the future.
[00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:26.796]  But we're lining that up.
[00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:29.157]  Had it absolutely set last night.
[00:25:29.997 --> 00:25:58.443]  To be on a little after 11 12 Eastern, but it may be a time zone issue We'll see what comes up with that now getting back to the issue of the El Paso Times This has been reported on by Infowars.com Then a few days later the New American magazine an excellent job breaking it down as well and finally mainstream news has reported on this and
[00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:05.493]  And he's entered into the federal record that he was working for the US government and allowed to ship narcotics in.
[00:26:06.154 --> 00:26:11.199]  Well, this is exactly what Selly Castile and others told us more than five years ago.
[00:26:13.262 --> 00:26:18.227]  And it's the same reports that we've got now coming out.
[00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:28.916]  And again, we have those articles up at Infowars.com, where top Mexican drug cartel leaders say that they were actually delivered guns.
[00:26:30.137 --> 00:26:32.919]  by the ATF and other branches of the federal government.
[00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:42.646]  And now the head of the ATF has admitted that he had lied when he said he didn't know anything about it and that he was ordered to do so by the Attorney General Eric Holder.
[00:26:43.286 --> 00:26:45.368]  Holder then said, no, I didn't order that.
[00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:50.811]  And then later documents were released that indeed he did know and that the White House did know.
[00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:53.974]  And of course, we've played the clips from C-SPAN of the testimony.
[00:26:54.494 --> 00:27:03.480]  And it turns out, of course, as I had remembered, a year and a half ago, they'd given press conferences admitting that they'd been doing a gun tracing program into Mexico and did know about it.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.422]  But that was when they were putting their spin on it ahead of time.
[00:27:06.462 --> 00:27:10.424]  So by his own admissions, the Attorney General has perjured himself to Congress.
[00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:17.129]  Now we've learned they've shipped them guns into Florida, California, Illinois, other states to select
[00:27:18.885 --> 00:27:19.486]  Cartels.
[00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:37.402]  And that's what's so scary about this, is that in most major cities, the police are deployed only to go after, because they're compartmentalized, small-time people, and then, of course, medium-sized players that aren't paying their cut in.
[00:27:38.043 --> 00:27:39.404]  But more often than not,
[00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:47.283]  Another drug gang is dispatched to simply murder the other drug dealers, and then the police turn a blind eye.
[00:27:47.723 --> 00:27:50.925]  And it's time as a nation to grow up to just how corrupt we've become.
[00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:53.907]  And this didn't start yesterday.
[00:27:54.227 --> 00:28:07.515]  If you look at prohibition in the 20s, alcohol use more than tripled, government's own numbers, and the profits more than tripled, and all sorts of alcohol poisoning happened, the police became incredibly corrupt,
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.820]  That's how they corrupted the cops.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:15.022]  You really couldn't get cops to be part of drug dealing at the time because drugs were sold at drugstores over the counter.
[00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:16.142]  It wasn't even an issue.
[00:28:16.822 --> 00:28:17.962]  Drug use was a lot lower.
[00:28:17.982 --> 00:28:19.903]  It was seen as an illness, as a disease.
[00:28:19.923 --> 00:28:23.864]  Have you ever dig into old junk piles out in the country?
[00:28:23.884 --> 00:28:28.945]  I know a lot of folks do it and I've done it because you can sell the bottles because they're antique.
[00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:34.386]  And, you know, the old medicine bottles and old Coca-Cola bottles and things.
[00:28:35.987 --> 00:28:37.989]  Sometimes the bottles are worth hundreds of dollars apiece.
[00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:45.114]  The point is you dig into old trash piles and you'll just find anywhere you dig, you'll find in the middle of nowhere out in the countryside, laudanum bottles.
[00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:46.435]  Oh, you got a headache?
[00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:47.135]  You got the flu?
[00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:47.896]  Drink some of this.
[00:28:48.236 --> 00:28:48.776]  It's opium.
[00:28:49.557 --> 00:28:50.898]  Coca-Cola had cocaine in it.
[00:28:51.598 --> 00:28:52.219]  A lot of it in it.
[00:28:53.206 --> 00:28:54.207]  That's why it's called Coke.
[00:28:54.547 --> 00:28:57.209]  If you don't believe me, just look up the history of Coca-Cola and cocaine.
[00:28:57.609 --> 00:29:00.131]  Sometimes I talk about that, people don't believe me because they're ignorant.
[00:29:00.151 --> 00:29:02.132]  They're like, Coca-Cola doesn't have cocaine in it.
[00:29:02.452 --> 00:29:03.873]  I'm not saying it has it in it now.
[00:29:04.174 --> 00:29:06.155]  It's been taken out since the late 1930s.
[00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:09.257]  Well, it's been like decocinated.
[00:29:09.337 --> 00:29:10.798]  It still has cocaine flavoring.
[00:29:11.018 --> 00:29:14.261]  The flavor of Coca-Cola and Pepsi is coca.
[00:29:15.101 --> 00:29:16.302]  That's the secret ingredient.
[00:29:17.243 --> 00:29:20.425]  Is decocinated, like decaffeinated, cocaine.
[00:29:22.674 --> 00:29:26.576]  But here it is, just out in the open, not with a bang but with a whimper.
[00:29:26.616 --> 00:29:30.038]  Yeah, he's coming out in court, he's giving them some documents.
[00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:31.839]  They work for the U.S.
[00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:35.041]  government and ran this big aircraft operation.
[00:29:35.702 --> 00:29:37.503]  Oh, what do we have in Bloomberg from last year?
[00:29:38.933 --> 00:29:45.699]  $376 billion in laundered drug money by Wachovia and Wells Fargo and nobody got in trouble.
[00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:50.602]  But if they catch you with a little bit of cocaine, 10 years minimum sentence in prison.
[00:29:51.063 --> 00:29:51.943]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.444 --> 00:29:54.045]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.986 --> 00:29:57.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:03.681]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.901 --> 00:30:08.947]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:10.569]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.749 --> 00:30:19.539]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:27.364]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.804 --> 00:30:35.408]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.808 --> 00:30:43.192]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:45.973 --> 00:30:48.895]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:30:51.396 --> 00:30:53.698]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:31:02.751 --> 00:31:04.053]  You're subject to other police action.
[00:31:04.914 --> 00:31:05.815]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.176 --> 00:31:09.941]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.344]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.364 --> 00:31:17.772]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:24.474]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.874 --> 00:31:30.416]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.857 --> 00:31:34.518]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:39.019]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:44.820]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.241]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:50.201]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:51.301]  It's here.

[00:33:08.574 --> 00:33:16.856]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:37.567]  You know, I just spent the last 20 minutes or so getting into so-called government drug dealing.
[00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:41.652]  But saying government, you know, gives it too much respect.
[00:33:41.692 --> 00:33:45.616]  These are rogue, criminal elements that have taken over our government.
[00:33:46.597 --> 00:33:49.580]  And now, instead of denying that they traffic the narcotics,
[00:33:51.078 --> 00:34:00.288]  They think you're so weak-minded that they have ABC, CBS, Fox, and others in the last year come out and go, yes, it's true.
[00:34:00.949 --> 00:34:02.110]  We help grow the opium.
[00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:13.760]  I mean, it's so industrial, it's so huge, that they're giving them the fertilizer, the transport, the security, reportedly even having troops dig and help plant it when they need help during harvest.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.081]  And the troops are given a little extra cash.
[00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:18.302]  This is part of the corrupting of the troops.
[00:34:18.962 --> 00:34:21.524]  And the government's like, look, we had to kill Pat Tillman over this.
[00:34:21.784 --> 00:34:22.844]  He didn't go along with it.
[00:34:24.345 --> 00:34:25.185]  We had to murder him.
[00:34:25.205 --> 00:34:26.126]  We got caught doing that.
[00:34:26.206 --> 00:34:26.806]  What do we do?
[00:34:27.486 --> 00:34:28.927]  And they go, you just go public with it.
[00:34:29.994 --> 00:34:33.376]  You just go public and go, oh yeah, I'm barbecuing kids in the backyard.
[00:34:33.396 --> 00:34:34.316]  It's no big deal.
[00:34:38.258 --> 00:34:39.419]  And that's what they've done.
[00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:42.561]  And they get Geraldo up there to go, the patriotic duty.
[00:34:42.621 --> 00:34:48.564]  Let's cut to the Marine Corps colonel with all the troops standing around looking freaked out, because the troops are like, what are we doing here?
[00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:50.645]  What are we doing here growing this opium?
[00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:52.527]  Shut up or they'll frag you.
[00:34:52.947 --> 00:34:56.391]  Everybody knows, you know, that the bosses up top are getting a big piece of this.
[00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:58.192]  I know, but it's just wrong.
[00:34:58.553 --> 00:35:00.234]  Hey, go along, you'll get a piece of it.
[00:35:01.776 --> 00:35:05.199]  The commanders are like, look, this operation's so big, what do we do?
[00:35:05.819 --> 00:35:11.885]  Well, the American people are so dumb now, we'll just come right out and say we're helping grow it and that it's to fight Al-Qaeda and they'll buy it.
[00:35:13.083 --> 00:35:15.426]  I mean, look, they let the TSA stick their hands down their pants.
[00:35:15.846 --> 00:35:19.230]  They let us put radioactive isotopes in the sodium fluoride in the water.
[00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.690]  Why not?
[00:35:20.311 --> 00:35:20.772]  They love it.
[00:35:21.432 --> 00:35:25.897]  The public hasn't even noticed that their cancer rates have doubled in the last 10 years and their diabetes rates.
[00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:29.882]  They haven't even noticed that we've stolen 27 trillion and are bankrupting them.
[00:35:30.686 --> 00:35:33.488]  So, we might as well just ship it in publicly.
[00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:47.096]  In fact, we ought to just have stores where the government openly sells heroin and cocaine, and then we'll even bring it into schools and have it as part of the school lunch program to inject the children, but as soon as the child injects the heroin, then we'll have an officer arrest them.
[00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:59.424]  In fact, that sounds like satire, but I think that's the level it's coming to next, where you'll be ordered to inject your child with heroin, but then you'll be arrested after you're ordered to inject it.
[00:36:01.448 --> 00:36:03.210]  I mean, that is basically what this has come to.
[00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.071]  And it will continue!
[00:36:05.211 --> 00:36:06.232]  It will not stop!
[00:36:06.452 --> 00:36:07.814]  It is going to intensify!
[00:36:10.436 --> 00:36:11.056]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:15.080]  Okay, I've got a lot of other news that I want to cover here.
[00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:22.266]  But that's why I get mad when I pull up to a checkpoint.
[00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.228]  It's happened, I don't know, three or four times over the years.
[00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.276]  And the police asked to search my car and I just look at them and I say, for what?
[00:36:30.977 --> 00:36:35.884]  They said, do you have any guns, knives, other objects, drugs?
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:39.329]  I just look at them and I just say, you're not stupid.
[00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:42.374]  You know the government brings the drugs in and I don't use your products.
[00:36:43.854 --> 00:36:49.643]  Now, you can go get a drug dog, and I know that your drug dog is big and fat and alerts every time you bring it.
[00:36:49.683 --> 00:36:51.645]  You claim probable cause because it gets a biscuit.
[00:36:52.427 --> 00:36:59.197]  I understand that, but you want to go ahead and search, you know, 50 other cars while that happens, or go get the drug dog and let's just do this.
[00:37:01.584 --> 00:37:04.667]  Now one time I let him search it because I had to get to the radio station.
[00:37:04.707 --> 00:37:05.928]  I was on in like 30 minutes.
[00:37:06.488 --> 00:37:07.989]  This has got to be like 14 years ago.
[00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.911]  And I, it wasn't even a checkpoint.
[00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:14.595]  I got pulled over on 183 North, uh, the time when I was over there at KJFK.
[00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:19.979]  And the, uh, the cop pulled me over and he looked and he goes, I want to search this car.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.342]  And I just said, okay, please hurry.
[00:37:23.402 --> 00:37:24.483]  I got to get to work.
[00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:26.424]  And as soon as I do that, he said, oh, that's all right.
[00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:26.785]  You can go.
[00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:29.597]  Again, probably not even a corrupt cop.
[00:37:29.637 --> 00:37:31.219]  He was just wanting to see if I had something.
[00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:31.959]  So I'm like, go ahead.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.921]  And then he could see that I could care less.
[00:37:34.941 --> 00:37:35.902]  I just wanted to get out of there.
[00:37:36.142 --> 00:37:36.903]  So he left me alone.
[00:37:38.144 --> 00:37:41.026]  But look, I don't use your products.
[00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:42.847]  Let's get that straight.
[00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:51.174]  I used the CIA's products two times when I was a teenager, once at a party and once at a basketball court.
[00:37:52.034 --> 00:37:55.857]  And both times, it felt like I'd just been through a traumatic experience.
[00:37:55.877 --> 00:38:02.303]  You know that feeling after a really bad car wreck and you're wide awake and feel kind of dirty in your brain, like, ugh, like everything's grungy?
[00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:05.505]  That's what your product, cocaine, makes me feel like.
[00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:07.827]  It makes me feel like hell.
[00:38:08.308 --> 00:38:09.909]  It destroys my confidence.
[00:38:10.189 --> 00:38:12.591]  But I'm told people that don't have confidence, they like it.
[00:38:13.312 --> 00:38:14.753]  For me, it's like hell on earth.
[00:38:15.554 --> 00:38:16.635]  Same thing with marijuana.
[00:38:19.807 --> 00:38:23.930]  Every time I've smoked it, it just makes me feel depressed and paranoid, except once.
[00:38:25.992 --> 00:38:28.754]  And I was told that was some type of super medical grade stuff.
[00:38:29.335 --> 00:38:34.359]  And by the way, you're like, oh my gosh, marijuana, just be honest about it, demystify it.
[00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:40.944]  Cocaine's horrible, methamphetamine's horrible, Valium's horrible, all these drugs are horrible.
[00:38:41.264 --> 00:38:43.926]  Whether they're over-the-counter, prescription, any of this stuff.
[00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:47.229]  Whether it's illegal drugs, demystify it.
[00:38:47.609 --> 00:38:49.111]  It's what losers do.
[00:38:51.055 --> 00:38:54.218]  Demystify getting drunk as being cool, like Hollywood.
[00:38:54.438 --> 00:38:58.681]  Notice Hollywood sells drugs as cool, alcohol as cool, cigarettes as cool.
[00:38:59.202 --> 00:39:01.163]  That's because it was product placement.
[00:39:02.624 --> 00:39:04.446]  Demystify it all, folks.
[00:39:04.526 --> 00:39:05.267]  It's horrible.
[00:39:05.407 --> 00:39:06.127]  It's terrible.
[00:39:06.508 --> 00:39:09.370]  Don't ever use it for the first time.
[00:39:10.711 --> 00:39:11.552]  You want to get high?
[00:39:11.772 --> 00:39:12.573]  Go rock climbing.
[00:39:13.193 --> 00:39:14.114]  You want to get high?
[00:39:14.334 --> 00:39:17.557]  Go hiking up a whole mountainside.
[00:39:17.577 --> 00:39:18.878]  When you get to the top, you're going to be high.
[00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.732]  When you get back down to the bottom that night and are eating dinner in a cabin, you're going to be high on life.
[00:39:25.432 --> 00:39:27.653]  Or win at business, or win in your personal life.
[00:39:28.653 --> 00:39:32.975]  Or go to a swim meet and watch your daughter and son both get the blue ribbon.
[00:39:33.995 --> 00:39:35.296]  That's going to make you high.
[00:39:35.936 --> 00:39:41.398]  Having our big story, stories we break, up on the Drugs Report.
[00:39:42.018 --> 00:39:43.038]  That gets me high.
[00:39:46.308 --> 00:39:47.508]  There are some drugs I like.
[00:39:47.688 --> 00:39:49.329]  And this is, by the way, a bad drug.
[00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:50.789]  My wife's almost completely off of it.
[00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.850]  I'm trying to kick it.
[00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.170]  And that's called coffee.
[00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:59.932]  You drink coffee long enough, it doesn't even really get you stimulated anymore.
[00:39:59.952 --> 00:40:01.472]  You just need it to be stimulated.
[00:40:02.052 --> 00:40:04.413]  So I guess at the end of the day, I have a drug problem.
[00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:09.873]  Because I am a depressed zombie and cannot operate without coffee.
[00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:12.156]  So let's just all demystify it.
[00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:16.000]  Do you put people in prison because they drink three or four cups of coffee a day?
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.084]  I've cut back to about two big ones a day now, instead of six or seven.
[00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.667]  I wash down to one little cup in the morning.
[00:40:22.947 --> 00:40:24.528]  I mean, do we deserve to go to prison?
[00:40:24.709 --> 00:40:24.949]  No.
[00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.773]  It's a serious brain stimulant.
[00:40:31.212 --> 00:40:33.494]  When somebody, old lady drinks some tea, do you put her in prison?
[00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:36.537]  Rush Limbaugh, hurt his back, got on Oxycontin.
[00:40:37.038 --> 00:40:38.359]  It's extremely addictive.
[00:40:38.439 --> 00:40:39.560]  It's synthetic heroin.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.924]  Do we put Rush Limbaugh in prison because he got addicted?
[00:40:43.964 --> 00:40:45.446]  The brain's designed to get addicted.
[00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:45.806]  No!
[00:40:47.287 --> 00:40:52.953]  But Rush Limbaugh shouldn't support mandatory sentences for heroin and cocaine, as he still does.
[00:40:55.097 --> 00:40:56.218]  That is so hypocritical.
[00:40:56.598 --> 00:40:58.139]  And I'm not even here trying to bash Rush.
[00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:02.281]  I'm just saying you've got to stop being hypocrites in life.
[00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:04.422]  And we're all hypocrites to a certain extent.
[00:41:05.342 --> 00:41:06.423]  We all make mistakes.
[00:41:07.283 --> 00:41:08.444]  We all do things that are wrong.
[00:41:08.484 --> 00:41:10.084]  We all subconsciously lie.
[00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:16.648]  Even if we don't know we're lying, we'll kind of twist things to not hurt somebody's feelings or whatever the case may be.
[00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:24.992]  But see, I've trained myself that when I catch myself later doing something that I'm ashamed of it.
[00:41:25.292 --> 00:41:27.133]  At least I try to not be like that.
[00:41:27.473 --> 00:41:29.293]  Most people don't even think about it.
[00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:32.074]  And that's why we've gotten to have a delusional culture.
[00:41:33.315 --> 00:41:38.417]  There was a big university study that confirmed all the other studies that just came out a few weeks ago that I've attempted to cover.
[00:41:38.477 --> 00:41:43.598]  I've read the headlines here about studies show peer pressure can make you physically change your memories.
[00:41:44.318 --> 00:41:45.979]  Brain scans show in the brain.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]  That's what a magician does.
[00:41:49.975 --> 00:42:07.283]  They've done the studies where you can say, here's a blue car, here's a red car, and then have the authority figure get up there and say, this car is red when it's clearly blue, and the majority of people, if they're told by an authority figure that the car is red when it's really blue, will go ahead and say, okay, it's red if you say so.
[00:42:08.824 --> 00:42:12.986]  And that's why I routinely hear national talk show hosts attack me.
[00:42:13.046 --> 00:42:14.947]  I can just randomly go to the dial and hear it.
[00:42:16.024 --> 00:42:22.867]  That's why I can listen to local radio and hear them say, Alex Jones saying our police are dealing drugs.
[00:42:23.488 --> 00:42:28.130]  I just find it hard to believe that our good officers out on the street are dealing drugs.
[00:42:29.791 --> 00:42:32.272]  You find it hard to believe the government's been caught over and over again doing it.
[00:42:32.292 --> 00:42:37.395]  I mean, major banks don't get in trouble laundering hundreds of billions a year when they, quote, get caught.
[00:42:37.415 --> 00:42:41.797]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:42:43.676 --> 00:42:44.957]  And they always build straw men.
[00:42:45.397 --> 00:42:51.861]  You know that officer out there clearing up a wreck on the road in a drug dealer, and I don't appreciate certain people saying that.
[00:42:51.881 --> 00:42:56.464]  I've actually heard a talk show host here in town say that about me.
[00:42:56.804 --> 00:42:59.586]  He's a pretty good guy, I know him, but he is a retired police officer.
[00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:05.789]  You know, these people on this station saying that the police deal the drugs, I don't appreciate it.
[00:43:06.469 --> 00:43:07.990]  The police officers work hard.
[00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.691]  They're out there cleaning up wrecks and risking their lives.
[00:43:12.332 --> 00:43:20.935]  Well, obviously the cops changing tires or running red light checks isn't dealing drugs, and I didn't say that.
[00:43:22.135 --> 00:43:27.997]  It's the higher-ups know what's going on and are told what to do by the feds and what to leave alone.
[00:43:28.317 --> 00:43:29.278]  That's what's on record.
[00:43:30.188 --> 00:43:31.589]  So stop building straw men.
[00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:35.091]  I didn't say the cop that's in your church is dealing drugs.
[00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:36.232]  I didn't say that.
[00:43:36.692 --> 00:43:52.041]  What I said is they were on record, the feds and the higher ups and the detective vice squads in every major city have been caught over and over again running the drugs and living in million dollar houses when the beat cops live in the blue collar neighborhood with a broke down pickup truck.
[00:43:53.365 --> 00:43:55.407]  And police should stop putting up with this!
[00:43:55.427 --> 00:43:58.651]  Of course, you know what happens when you do... What happened to Serpico?
[00:43:58.671 --> 00:43:59.792]  You get shot in the face!
[00:44:00.753 --> 00:44:01.614]  What happened to Serpico?
[00:44:01.674 --> 00:44:02.796]  Famous New York cop.
[00:44:02.956 --> 00:44:03.637]  Had to leave the U.S.
[00:44:03.657 --> 00:44:04.578]  because of death threats.
[00:44:04.678 --> 00:44:05.339]  Moved to Switzerland.
[00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:07.821]  Played by Al Pacino in the movie Serpico.
[00:44:08.682 --> 00:44:11.385]  First day on the job, he's brought up to narcotics detective.
[00:44:11.405 --> 00:44:12.427]  Been on the force 10 years.
[00:44:13.646 --> 00:44:23.869]  They go, uh, shake down some robbers that have got some stolen diamond necklaces, and they give him the equivalent of a three or four month salary diamond bracelet.
[00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:25.610]  And he says, I don't want that.
[00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:27.851]  And they say, oh yeah, take it.
[00:44:28.091 --> 00:44:32.212]  By the way, I've had famous detectives from New York on talking about these, you know, these things that happen.
[00:44:32.232 --> 00:44:33.833]  And they're like, you're not going to take that?
[00:44:35.093 --> 00:44:35.813]  Just, just do it.
[00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:38.154]  Even if you don't, just, it'll make the guys feel better.
[00:44:39.014 --> 00:44:40.795]  That's called a corruption.
[00:44:42.779 --> 00:44:47.502]  And remember the tens of billions, by the end of it I think it was like 60 billion?
[00:44:48.022 --> 00:44:55.047]  Pull it up, pallets of money flown in, tried billions on pallets flown into Baghdad.
[00:44:55.427 --> 00:44:58.669]  And then at first it was 20 and then 40 and then 60, I forget the last number.
[00:44:58.689 --> 00:45:04.673]  And I've talked to so many military personnel, including folks that are known to me personally for many years, I'll just leave it at that.
[00:45:05.253 --> 00:45:06.054]  And that's what happens.
[00:45:06.114 --> 00:45:07.695]  If you're just a regular sergeant,
[00:45:08.817 --> 00:45:11.866]  They go, hey, the captain calls you in, or the colonel calls you in.
[00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:12.808]  You know what?
[00:45:14.124 --> 00:45:14.945]  You've been working hard.
[00:45:14.985 --> 00:45:15.405]  It's tough.
[00:45:15.785 --> 00:45:17.427]  Our military doesn't get paid enough over here.
[00:45:17.927 --> 00:45:20.949]  Here's $10,000 just to help your family.
[00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:23.371]  And of course, you're not paid enough to live.
[00:45:23.651 --> 00:45:27.994]  The contractors are being paid $180,000 on average, the combat contractors.
[00:45:28.235 --> 00:45:30.917]  You're getting paid maybe $25,000, $30,000 a year if you're lucky.
[00:45:31.697 --> 00:45:35.020]  Your wife's calling up saying, we're bankrupt, we can't live, there's inflation.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.221]  So you want to take it.
[00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:39.043]  The minute you take that, now you're corrupted.
[00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:42.173]  Yeah, there's one of the older articles, 2007.
[00:45:42.273 --> 00:45:43.693]  It's a lot more now.
[00:45:43.973 --> 00:45:44.593]  London Guardian.
[00:45:44.814 --> 00:45:45.454]  How the U.S.
[00:45:45.494 --> 00:45:49.315]  sent $12 billion in cash into Iraq and watched it vanish.
[00:45:51.696 --> 00:45:55.958]  Special flights brought in tons of banknotes, which disappeared into the war zone.
[00:45:55.978 --> 00:45:58.779]  Yeah, and it went to the different rival groups not to fight the U.S.
[00:45:58.819 --> 00:46:01.960]  forces and NATO forces and, you know, Allied forces, to be technical.
[00:46:06.206 --> 00:46:07.607]  But by the time, I know you can pull it up.
[00:46:07.847 --> 00:46:09.908]  Try that headline, but just put $40 billion in there.
[00:46:09.928 --> 00:46:10.748]  See if you can find that one.
[00:46:11.049 --> 00:46:11.869]  I know I read those numbers.
[00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:20.714]  Now, if you're higher up, you're a colonel, they call you in and say, you know what?
[00:46:21.334 --> 00:46:21.774]  Here's $100,000 in $100 bills.
[00:46:25.606 --> 00:46:27.507]  And you're like, I'm supposed to take this?
[00:46:27.547 --> 00:46:28.327]  Yeah, we all are.
[00:46:29.308 --> 00:46:35.491]  George Bush cares about you, and Cheney cares, and they understand what you're going through, and they don't think it's fair what the contractors are getting.
[00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:36.451]  This is actually what they're told.
[00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:37.512]  So this is yours.
[00:46:38.332 --> 00:46:46.656]  Now, once you've taken that $100,000, what happens when they send from the Pentagon, somebody who wouldn't take the money, an Army inspector?
[00:46:47.396 --> 00:46:50.058]  A captain, a colonel, a Marine Corps inspector.
[00:46:50.078 --> 00:46:51.919]  You know how many hundreds have been fragged?
[00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:54.660]  And they come in and start noticing that
[00:46:56.417 --> 00:47:06.926]  Contractors are getting, you know, $15 million for a $500 blue tarp, or that the water's rotten that the troops are getting, or everything's falling apart and stuff's being stolen out of the warehouses.
[00:47:07.267 --> 00:47:08.348]  Well, they get shot in the head.
[00:47:08.388 --> 00:47:11.350]  They commit suicide, or an IED blows them up.
[00:47:14.633 --> 00:47:16.535]  Or Pat Tillman says, I'm not going along with this.
[00:47:16.555 --> 00:47:17.456]  And they say, oh really?
[00:47:17.476 --> 00:47:18.357]  You're not going along with this?
[00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:25.898]  And of course, what are they going to do when the army coroner, who was a colonel, says, no, he was killed.
[00:47:25.918 --> 00:47:27.439]  This was a homicide.
[00:47:28.259 --> 00:47:30.440]  He was shot, it appears, at over 100 yards.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.480]  And that's what the witnesses later came out and said.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.242]  He begged for his life, hid behind a rock, you know, said, I'm a friendly.
[00:47:37.282 --> 00:47:37.862]  And they knew that.
[00:47:38.883 --> 00:47:49.347]  And then they went up and shot him at about, what did they say, six yards away, they estimated from the powder burns, a three-shot M16 burst right across the front of his face.
[00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:50.866]  Begging.
[00:47:51.467 --> 00:47:55.130]  And they went up to the NFL star, stuck a gun right up to him and killed him.
[00:47:57.932 --> 00:48:03.417]  Because after they first shot him into his body arm when he was wounded, he got up and waved his arms and said, it's me, I'm a friendly!
[00:48:03.917 --> 00:48:07.120]  They kept shooting so he got down and hid, and they came up and got him.
[00:48:08.461 --> 00:48:10.703]  That's who runs America, okay?
[00:48:11.044 --> 00:48:12.845]  You need to grow up and understand that.
[00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:14.887]  And none of us are safe.
[00:48:15.327 --> 00:48:17.269]  These bankers are gonna implode everything.
[00:48:20.928 --> 00:48:42.165]  Now, I've been talking about government drug dealing, I've been talking about how it's all admitted, how they grow the opium, all of it, and I'm very excited to have with us, well, I mean, really an icon of hip-hop and rap, and we're very, very excited to have Prodigy Mobb Deep on with us.
[00:48:42.205 --> 00:48:43.906]  He's a Grammy award-winning rapper.
[00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:50.252]  And one half of the hip-hop duo, Mobb Deep, he recently served a three-year sentence.
[00:48:50.272 --> 00:48:51.693]  Oh, for the evil Second Amendment.
[00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:52.434]  That's right.
[00:48:53.535 --> 00:48:55.857]  Boy, I tell you, they went after him when he started exposing the Illuminati.
[00:48:56.437 --> 00:49:03.543]  And he was recently featured in the 2011 documentary, Rhyme and Punishment, a film that documents hip-hop artists who've been incarcerated.
[00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:07.126]  He is the great-great-grandson of founder of
[00:49:07.867 --> 00:49:13.390]  Morehouse College and a new book, My Infamous Life, the Autobiography of Mob Deep's Prodigy.
[00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.771]  I don't know how long we've got.
[00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:16.392]  I think we've got time zones scrambled.
[00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.193]  We're about to go to break.
[00:49:17.713 --> 00:49:21.636]  But I've got so many questions for you, sir, and we appreciate you joining us today.
[00:49:21.656 --> 00:49:24.057]  Not a problem, Alex, man.
[00:49:24.077 --> 00:49:24.918]  No big thing.
[00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:26.191]  Well, to me,
[00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:54.038]  You know, uh, it's definitely, it's definitely not a joke, man.
[00:49:54.498 --> 00:49:57.844]  It's a lot of real stuff going on out here in this, in this world.
[00:49:58.445 --> 00:50:00.047]  Secret societies are real.
[00:50:00.468 --> 00:50:04.394]  You know, um, it's definitely very obvious, you know, that um,
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:13.505]  Yeah, work and it's at play in the music industry, in the food industry, politics, everywhere you turn is everywhere.
[00:50:13.525 --> 00:50:16.808]  You just gotta read the signs, you know what I mean?
[00:50:16.828 --> 00:50:18.369]  The writing on the wall, basically.
[00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.210]  It's all in front of your face, you know what I'm saying?
[00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:30.997]  Yeah, once people just learn about it and do a little research about it all, they'll be able to see, like, oh wow, this, yeah, I understand what's going on, you know what I mean?
[00:50:31.579 --> 00:50:32.139]  Absolutely.
[00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:33.059]  You've got the floor.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:33.820]  Lay it out.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.620]  Break it down.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:41.442]  This reported letter, when you were set up and sent to prison for exercising your Second Amendment rights, did you write this letter?
[00:50:41.602 --> 00:50:45.163]  Because it's very poignant and I agree with much of it.
[00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:47.324]  You've got the floor.
[00:50:48.464 --> 00:50:48.984]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:49.004 --> 00:50:52.685]  I wrote a lot of letters while I was in here, man.
[00:50:52.946 --> 00:50:55.526]  I was doing this thing for Vibe magazine.
[00:50:58.206 --> 00:51:08.633]  Just writing letters from prison, just expressing myself and things I wanted to get off my chest, things that were on my mind and I wanted to let people know.
[00:51:08.973 --> 00:51:13.556]  And I wanted to show them, even though I was inside, you know, locked in a prison,
[00:51:14.617 --> 00:51:21.899]  You know, I wanted to show them that I still had no fear in my heart, you know, about speaking my mind and letting people know what time it is.
[00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:30.402]  There's no reason for me to fear because there's really nothing, there's nothing they can do besides kill me and I'm not afraid of that.
[00:51:30.562 --> 00:51:31.182]  You know what I mean?
[00:51:31.222 --> 00:51:37.524]  Like, um, I don't think right now they're at the point where they would take it that far.
[00:51:37.584 --> 00:51:39.325]  I think they, like this plan,
[00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:43.825]  That they got into effect and it's been in effect for hundreds of years or whatever.
[00:51:44.185 --> 00:51:46.707]  I think it's so embedded in people's brains, man.
[00:51:46.747 --> 00:51:50.969]  They got people so brainwashed in this world that they don't even really care anymore.
[00:51:50.989 --> 00:51:51.910]  You know what I mean?
[00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:56.292]  About people like Alex Jones, people like Prodigy.
[00:51:56.753 --> 00:51:59.114]  Like, they're like, go ahead and tell the people all you want.
[00:51:59.154 --> 00:52:02.636]  We got these people so brainwashed, there's nothing you guys can do about it.
[00:52:02.997 --> 00:52:03.657]  That's how they feel.
[00:52:03.697 --> 00:52:04.778]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:52:05.278 --> 00:52:06.739]  And when I say they, I mean, you know,
[00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:12.849]  The power and the structure that's in place, you know, that's there to control us.
[00:52:12.909 --> 00:52:14.129]  You know what I mean?
[00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.090]  Absolutely.
[00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:17.732]  I mean, looking at it, well, it's twofold.
[00:52:17.752 --> 00:52:23.336]  30, 40 years ago, if you talked about this, they would give you a fast-acting cancer.
[00:52:23.376 --> 00:52:24.476]  They would kill you.
[00:52:24.957 --> 00:52:25.697]  It's on record.
[00:52:25.757 --> 00:52:27.038]  Much of it's been declassified.
[00:52:27.098 --> 00:52:29.960]  But people still had courage and got the word out.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.764]  And so because so many people spoke out, they've now flipped it and said, OK, we're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:37.625]  Okay, we're shipping the cocaine in.
[00:52:37.925 --> 00:52:41.108]  Okay, we're shipping the guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:52:41.468 --> 00:52:48.613]  And so, they've decided to just go with the revelation of the method instead because they're desperate.
[00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:58.941]  But if we really try to shake people out of their trance, as you and others are doing, across the board, we can beat them if we can get people out of the trance they're in.
[00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:01.534]  Definitely, definitely.
[00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:08.256]  You know at the end of the day, you know, I always say like God always wins at the end of the day, you know what I mean?
[00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:11.858]  Good always gonna beat evil at the end of the day, man.
[00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:14.239]  No matter how bad it's looking, you know what I mean?
[00:53:14.279 --> 00:53:17.280]  No matter what's going on, you know what I mean?
[00:53:17.641 --> 00:53:19.822]  Good is always gonna win, you know what I mean?
[00:53:21.644 --> 00:53:22.264]  We're good to go.
[00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:50.367]  The internet was going on, you know, it's all in these books, it's in movies, it's in, you know, it's all over the place.
[00:53:51.028 --> 00:53:56.495]  And they got people so brainwashed, you know what I mean, with all the...
[00:53:57.777 --> 00:54:03.261]  You know, fashion, and you know, jewelry, especially like in the hip-hop world.
[00:54:03.581 --> 00:54:08.284]  You know, in the hip-hop community, in the urban communities where I come from.
[00:54:08.664 --> 00:54:09.225]  You know what I mean?
[00:54:09.505 --> 00:54:17.750]  They got us so brainwashed with fashion, jewelry, and like, and sex, and all this stuff.
[00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.473]  Like, we don't even care to even think about what's going on.
[00:54:21.713 --> 00:54:22.293]  You know what I mean?
[00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:25.836]  Like, a lot of the people that I'm around,
[00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:40.279]  I look at them sometimes and all I'm concerned about is what I just said, like the fashion, the jewelry, the sex, all the stuff that is materialistic and stuff that is not going to do nothing for their soul or their life.
[00:54:46.821 --> 00:54:49.943]  Most of the famous people in Hollywood at one time or another.
[00:54:50.263 --> 00:54:54.466]  And once you meet them and find out that it's nothing, it's not fulfilling.
[00:54:54.826 --> 00:54:59.690]  What is fulfilling is having truth and information and decency and honor.
[00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:07.255]  But for folks that have never really had some form of notoriety or fame, which you've had much greater than I have, they can't understand it.
[00:55:07.695 --> 00:55:10.317]  They're always scrambling for it, reaching for it.
[00:55:10.697 --> 00:55:11.818]  Man, I would say it's not all about that, man.
[00:55:11.858 --> 00:55:12.439]  Life is not about
[00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:30.510]  Um, you know, that chasing, chasing that dream.
[00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:33.933]  Life is about, you know what I mean, being happy.
[00:55:33.953 --> 00:55:34.714]  You know what I mean?
[00:55:34.854 --> 00:55:41.261]  It's about, it's about having a, you know, a pure heart, pure soul, eating good, family.
[00:55:41.721 --> 00:55:43.283]  You know what I mean?
[00:55:43.623 --> 00:55:45.244]  Love, you know what I'm saying?
[00:55:45.284 --> 00:55:47.527]  Like your relationship with your spouse or whatever.
[00:55:49.288 --> 00:55:51.389]  You know, these are the things that life is about.
[00:55:51.429 --> 00:55:59.773]  Raising your children properly, making sure that, you know, each generation gets better than the last one, you know, smarter and healthier than the last one, all of that.
[00:56:00.173 --> 00:56:01.634]  These are the things that life is about.
[00:56:01.674 --> 00:56:06.096]  It's not really about chasing all these crazy dreams, you know what I mean?
[00:56:06.116 --> 00:56:10.278]  Because, you know, even though people want, you know, people want success,
[00:56:11.084 --> 00:56:11.705]  I don't think so.
[00:56:28.225 --> 00:56:31.087]  Yes, I think it's a hierarchy of needs.
[00:56:31.627 --> 00:56:38.872]  Success is great as long as you don't compromise to get it and as long as the success itself isn't the goal.
[00:56:38.952 --> 00:56:44.816]  Success in doing good, success in beautiful art, success in developing things, that's wonderful.
[00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:53.301]  The globalists, the controllers create a false success and set up false icons for us so that we'll chase, basically it's false idols.
[00:56:54.858 --> 00:56:56.218]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:56:56.739 --> 00:56:57.979]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:56:58.019 --> 00:57:01.200]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.721]  It's bad, man.
[00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:03.461]  It's bad.
[00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:11.283]  I try to reach out and share the information that I know with a lot of people.
[00:57:11.783 --> 00:57:12.304]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:12.444 --> 00:57:16.285]  Just stuff that I've read over the years and learned.
[00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:27.076]  About what's really going on, you know, with this government and what's really going on, you know, in this world and everything and how we should really be living and taking care of our families and our life.
[00:57:27.476 --> 00:57:35.221]  That's why I shared a lot of the information with, you know, my friends, my peers or whatever that I grew up with or that I'm around a lot.
[00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:37.722]  And I had to learn the hard way that
[00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:45.507]  You can't just push information on people.
[00:57:45.687 --> 00:57:46.668]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:47.509 --> 00:57:48.589]  They gotta want to know it.
[00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:49.370]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.592]  They gotta want to change their life.
[00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:52.492]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:52.512 --> 00:57:55.414]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:55.594 --> 00:57:59.757]  And it's sad that it's like that, but really that's how it is, man.
[00:57:59.917 --> 00:58:03.240]  You know, I know a lot of people now that I sit here, they're like,
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.322]  Yo, Prodigy, man, what can I do?
[00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:09.464]  Like, I was getting a lot of letters while I was in prison, right?
[00:58:10.124 --> 00:58:13.046]  And people would write me and say, yo, Prodigy, what can I do, man?
[00:58:13.486 --> 00:58:19.270]  I'm trying to share information with my homeboys and my friends, and they're not listening, they don't care.
[00:58:19.791 --> 00:58:22.752]  And I would write them back, like, listen, they gotta want their information, man.
[00:58:22.772 --> 00:58:25.694]  You know, they gotta want that change in their life, man.
[00:58:25.714 --> 00:58:28.596]  You can't just make people, you know what I mean, change.
[00:58:28.636 --> 00:58:32.739]  That's something that's a phenomenon that has to happen on its own, you know?
[00:58:33.019 --> 00:58:34.762]  I'll tell you what, Prodigy, stay with us.
[00:58:34.782 --> 00:58:36.243]  We've got to go to break for just a moment.
[00:58:36.504 --> 00:58:38.927]  Prodigy of Mobb Deep is our guest.
[00:58:38.967 --> 00:58:39.587]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.608 --> 00:58:48.679]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:03.326 --> 00:59:18.411]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:59:20.547 --> 00:59:24.409]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[00:59:28.971 --> 00:59:29.772]  Others don't.

[00:59:48.721 --> 00:59:49.582]  Others don't.
[00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:55.952]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.432 --> 00:59:59.273]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.815 --> 01:00:06.475]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.115 --> 01:00:08.155]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:10.196]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.656 --> 01:00:11.457]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:14.137]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:17.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:22.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:29.669]  Every economic expert we had on, we have the experts on who are right, not the ones that lie.
[01:00:30.909 --> 01:00:33.450]  Mainstream ones aren't dumb, they're lying to you.
[01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:40.594]  We told you the dollar was going to plunge, gold was going to explode, and the Dow was going to plunge as soon as they up the debt limit.
[01:00:40.754 --> 01:00:43.075]  We're being maneuvered into financial slavery.
[01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:47.048]  The Dow's down 350 points, plunging.
[01:00:47.148 --> 01:00:49.471]  Total fear is the CNN headline.
[01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:53.676]  We're going to be getting into some more of this news throughout the hour, obviously as it develops.
[01:00:54.076 --> 01:00:55.818]  This is all part of an orchestrated program.
[01:00:56.759 --> 01:01:00.824]  And no puppet George Bush, Barack Obama, or Mitt Romney is going to save you.
[01:01:01.621 --> 01:01:02.922]  It's the Federal Reserve or us.
[01:01:03.382 --> 01:01:06.965]  It's the king, dragon rulers of this system.
[01:01:07.025 --> 01:01:09.206]  They have to come down, not their puppets.
[01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:17.312]  Now, prodigy of Mobb Deep, legendary icon of hip-hop and rap, is our guest, really exposing the Illuminati program.
[01:01:17.352 --> 01:01:23.836]  And we were getting into, you know, folks, you know, coming in and saying, we're trying to wake up, you know, folks, and they're not listening.
[01:01:24.157 --> 01:01:27.199]  It's because they're following a false mirage
[01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:29.059]  Yeah, so, you know, like I was saying,
[01:01:56.701 --> 01:02:01.486]  You know, it's hard to get people to listen and to get people to want to change.
[01:02:01.506 --> 01:02:03.167]  They gotta want that change on their own.
[01:02:03.347 --> 01:02:04.308]  That'll never happen.
[01:02:04.328 --> 01:02:12.516]  You can't force somebody to want to change their life and change their way of thinking to understand what's really going on, that they've been manipulated.
[01:02:12.936 --> 01:02:15.499]  Their parents and their grandparents have been manipulated.
[01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:23.766]  You know, it's hard to break somebody out of that spell, you know, and that way of thinking and that belief system.
[01:02:23.786 --> 01:02:25.008]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:25.028 --> 01:02:31.354]  Because they're in a comfortable space where it just shatters their whole entire
[01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:40.015]  Well, it's like Neo in the Matrix when Morpheus gives him the red pill and he goes, look, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing else.
[01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:03.566]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:20.683 --> 01:03:28.909]  The people that are around me that notice what I'm all about and the things that I learn and, you know, the things that I put in my music a lot.
[01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:33.232]  And those that want that change in their life, they'll come to me.
[01:03:33.252 --> 01:03:34.433]  I don't even have to find them.
[01:03:34.693 --> 01:03:37.495]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:37.535 --> 01:03:38.816]  How did you begin to awaken?
[01:03:40.637 --> 01:03:42.599]  I mean, it was about 1989.
[01:03:46.607 --> 01:03:48.369]  You know, I went to high school in Manhattan.
[01:03:48.569 --> 01:03:52.912]  I went to Art and Design, where I met my music partner, Havoc.
[01:03:53.253 --> 01:03:54.153]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:55.334 --> 01:04:06.064]  And back then, they used to have these tables out on the street, on random corners, in like Queens and Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn, all the five boroughs or whatever.
[01:04:06.604 --> 01:04:10.948]  They used to have these tables, and it was like Muslim guys selling
[01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:11.990]  Yes.
[01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:32.639]  Stay there.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.600]  Let's come back.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.442]  We've got Prodigy of Mobb Deep on with us right now.
[01:04:37.502 --> 01:04:39.083]  Long segment coming up.
[01:04:39.163 --> 01:04:43.225]  And also, Prodigy, when we come back, let's plug all your websites and things.
[01:04:43.245 --> 01:04:43.986]  There's so many of them.
[01:04:44.266 --> 01:04:46.787]  I want to make sure I get the right ones out, so we'll drop those on people.
[01:04:47.368 --> 01:04:48.808]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:48.848 --> 01:04:51.490]  This is the Genesis Network, GCNLive.com.
[01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:54.311]  All Hades is breaking loose right now in the economy.
[01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:58.394]  Everything is proceeding as the globalists have foreseen it.
[01:04:58.934 --> 01:05:00.956]  Well, we've got the jump on them if people listen.
[01:05:00.976 --> 01:05:05.201]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:09.586]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.846 --> 01:05:15.272]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:16.073]  It's true.
[01:05:16.353 --> 01:05:20.898]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:21.739]  Number 3.
[01:05:22.039 --> 01:05:25.322]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:29.325]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.546 --> 01:05:30.086]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.708]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:36.432]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.752 --> 01:05:41.473]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.693 --> 01:05:46.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:50.776]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:52.476]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:01.718 --> 01:06:16.185]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:20.868]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:33.890]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:41.919]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:52.184]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:52.964 --> 01:06:56.225]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:56.886 --> 01:07:00.007]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:07:01.806 --> 01:07:03.307]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.527 --> 01:07:08.529]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:10.189]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:19.133]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:26.976]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:35.019]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:40.341]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:42.802]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:45.583 --> 01:08:06.031]  This is my song to the most high Who created all life on earth Like the birds that fly, the sweet air we breathe All the plants and trees, the sun And they ain't planted in the galaxy Yo, they feedin' us books, and with all these books
[01:08:15.354 --> 01:08:16.235]  I think so.
[01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:32.552]  We can live under the sun and give us strength.
[01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:35.693]  The white man gets sunburn and cancer of the skin.
[01:08:35.753 --> 01:08:37.214]  I got a lot of white friends.
[01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:38.394]  I'm not a racist.
[01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.275]  I acknowledge the most high.
[01:08:40.535 --> 01:08:41.515]  I'm not an atheist.
[01:08:41.835 --> 01:08:44.436]  I just see through the poor history and speak my mind.
[01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:47.497]  They terrified of my words, so they censor my rhymes.
[01:08:47.758 --> 01:08:49.358]  Good Lord, I'm crying out to you.
[01:08:50.038 --> 01:08:52.239]  Have mercy on the slave masses' souls.
[01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:53.160]  They did us dirty.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.421]  They don't give a f*** about their own poor white trash.
[01:08:56.641 --> 01:08:59.282]  Just imagine how they feel about my blackness.
[01:08:59.882 --> 01:09:02.804]  Christopher Columbus, the Indians was here first.
[01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:05.626]  The Vatican, the pyramids is over.
[01:09:05.927 --> 01:09:08.489]  Shut off the nose and the lips of our statues.
[01:09:08.869 --> 01:09:11.451]  Matthew's black face is staring back at you.
[01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:13.592]  We even built pyramids on Mars.
[01:09:13.853 --> 01:09:17.275]  They won't tell us about that, cause then we realize who we are.
[01:09:17.315 --> 01:09:20.257]  When I wrote Pearly Gates, they said I hated God.
[01:09:20.297 --> 01:09:23.199]  So I wrote this song, for the Creator, to all.
[01:09:24.941 --> 01:09:27.923]  My world is empty without you, baby.
[01:09:31.344 --> 01:09:31.844]  All right.
[01:09:32.384 --> 01:09:36.025]  Prodigy of Mobb Deep is our guest for another 45 minutes or so.
[01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:48.168]  Then we're going to get a pop-in from Mike Adams on the police and the feds raiding folks selling mangoes, papayas, other evil things like raw milk cheese.
[01:09:48.748 --> 01:09:49.829]  And they've got them on $120,000 bond each.
[01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:50.349]  Public store?
[01:09:50.409 --> 01:09:51.529]  Again, to be technical, I bought
[01:09:56.070 --> 01:10:00.693]  Food in another store this weekend, but my wife went to Whole Foods and got the raw milk cheese.
[01:10:00.713 --> 01:10:01.254]  It's our favorite.
[01:10:01.274 --> 01:10:03.715]  We've been buying it for a couple years now that it's available.
[01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:04.596]  Tastes completely different.
[01:10:04.956 --> 01:10:06.777]  So are they going to raid Whole Foods here in Austin?
[01:10:07.298 --> 01:10:08.619]  I mean, this is incredible stuff.
[01:10:08.639 --> 01:10:09.819]  So that's coming up now.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.401]  Now, following this, where's the stock market right now?
[01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:15.343]  Because, guys, I know I know it's plunging as we speak.
[01:10:15.643 --> 01:10:21.067]  Dow plunges 350 points on total fear and is still dropping.
[01:10:21.107 --> 01:10:22.088]  The dollar is dropping.
[01:10:22.128 --> 01:10:25.150]  Gold has blasted up.
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:29.732]  To what is it, $1,680 something?
[01:10:29.772 --> 01:10:30.792]  Give me the latest on that.
[01:10:30.832 --> 01:10:34.614]  It's all moving up quick because they're globally devaluing the dollar.
[01:10:35.434 --> 01:10:39.376]  They're talking about tax increases and super Congress.
[01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:41.837]  This is a tax increase to devalue your money.
[01:10:42.558 --> 01:10:44.278]  And if you're wealthy, it's going to hurt you.
[01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.019]  If you're middle class, it's going to hurt you really bad.
[01:10:46.039 --> 01:10:47.460]  And if you're poor, you're in trouble.
[01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:51.555]  Because the wages aren't going up, but what you can buy with that money is going down.
[01:10:51.975 --> 01:10:53.658]  My grandma and her social security.
[01:10:54.219 --> 01:10:57.123]  She worked at a print shop until she was 70-something years old.
[01:10:57.543 --> 01:11:00.388]  And my grandma can't basically live without us helping her.
[01:11:01.385 --> 01:11:03.807]  Okay, think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.588]  Think about what's happening.
[01:11:05.608 --> 01:11:06.589]  This is bondage.
[01:11:07.169 --> 01:11:08.110]  This is bondage.
[01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:12.613]  The globalists are destroying the world economy, their carbon taxes, all of it.
[01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:14.274]  We're going to be breaking it down.
[01:11:14.314 --> 01:11:20.098]  Going back to prodigy of Mobb Deep, legendary Grammy Award winning rapper.
[01:11:20.718 --> 01:11:22.438]  Yeah, so there was this guy named Dr. Yolk.
[01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:25.119]  You know, he had a community in Brooklyn called the Ansel Law Community.
[01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:54.509]  Basically, yeah, there's people out on the street selling books and the Muslim oils and different things like that, like incense and stuff like that.
[01:11:54.849 --> 01:11:58.432]  So I used to stop at the table to pick up this coconut oil because I liked how it smelled.
[01:11:58.873 --> 01:12:00.134]  You know, because the girls liked it.
[01:12:00.655 --> 01:12:04.918]  So at the table, they would sell these books written by Dr. York.
[01:12:05.479 --> 01:12:06.079]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:11.745]  And there was a book, they were the first books that I've read were books on like the holidays.
[01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:12.946]  One book was about Christmas.
[01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.469]  We're good to go.
[01:12:39.352 --> 01:12:44.616]  And I started learning who Dr. York is and what he's about and the stuff that he teaches.
[01:12:45.096 --> 01:12:46.897]  And then I started reading a lot of his books.
[01:12:47.998 --> 01:13:08.432]  And I realized that, you know, this dude was basically teaching, you know, people, especially black people, you know, about our origin and where we come from and how we, you know, we have a great history in this world and how we were, like, basically
[01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:17.306]  Our brainwashed, you know, and soul-washed of all of our history and of who we are and everything.
[01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:17.987]  That's right.
[01:13:18.007 --> 01:13:23.550]  If you go back to Roman times, no one looked at and said black men were inferior.
[01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:28.192]  I mean, that wasn't even, you know, debated or discussed.
[01:13:28.272 --> 01:13:30.574]  And you can lay out your historical review.
[01:13:30.894 --> 01:13:34.376]  But what really, from my research, you go back 500 years ago, they wanted to
[01:13:34.796 --> 01:13:58.908]  start this transatlantic slave trade and they had indentured servants who were white in Europe but they said hey we can use Bible passages and distort them dealing with Ham and Cain and Abel and say that these people deserve to be slaves and it actually took some selling but because the sailors themselves from Europe were mainly pressed and slaves on the ships if you actually research it most of them were captured and put on the
[01:13:59.688 --> 01:13:59.928]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:59.948 --> 01:14:03.309]  You know, they flipped it, and a lot of the Bible, so-called Bible stories and all that, or whatever.
[01:14:21.155 --> 01:14:31.939]  You know, Dr. York was just putting it out there, you know what I mean, and really, you know, exposing it to the world, you know, and sharing the information with everybody and accepting everybody also.
[01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:38.741]  You know, no matter what color you are, no matter what race you are, he was teaching that this is information that need to be
[01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:45.709]  When did you start learning about the Illuminati?
[01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:49.294]  Because you told me you've seen the Obama deception, the radio show.
[01:14:51.257 --> 01:14:52.538]  I said, well, what's your favorite clip?
[01:14:52.558 --> 01:14:55.943]  And you said the Bohemian Grove, the David Gergen situation.
[01:14:57.901 --> 01:15:01.743]  I mean, through his books, you know, through Doc's books, that's how I learned about it.
[01:15:01.783 --> 01:15:02.783]  That's how I bumped into it.
[01:15:03.223 --> 01:15:05.804]  Because, you know, it all coincides with each other, you know what I mean?
[01:15:05.844 --> 01:15:26.013]  Once you start learning the origin of things and you start learning, you know, the background things, what was going on, you're going to stumble on this word, Illuminati, and you're going to stumble on, you know, the whole diabolical plan and the whole grand scheme of things that was happening, you know what I mean?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.860]  That's how I bumped into it.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:35.102]  And then, you know, later on, years down the line, you know, I started doing research to make, I'm like, is this mad?
[01:15:35.242 --> 01:15:37.283]  I'm like, this is too unbelievable.
[01:15:37.723 --> 01:15:40.944]  The information that I was learning was like too incredible.
[01:15:40.964 --> 01:15:41.904]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:41.964 --> 01:15:44.545]  So, it forces you to do your own research.
[01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:48.206]  It forces you, like back then, there wasn't no internet when I was growing up.
[01:15:48.466 --> 01:15:49.026]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:49.066 --> 01:15:50.566]  So, I had to go to the library.
[01:15:50.586 --> 01:15:51.246]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:51.306 --> 01:15:52.107]  And check books out.
[01:15:52.127 --> 01:15:52.787]  That's what I did.
[01:15:52.807 --> 01:15:54.067]  The exact same thing.
[01:15:54.087 --> 01:15:55.908]  So, you've been awake for close to 30 years.
[01:15:57.125 --> 01:16:00.786]  Yeah, I mean, I've been learning ever since I was like 16.
[01:16:00.946 --> 01:16:02.787]  I've been learning, doing research.
[01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:05.407]  So, you know, I'm 36 now, you know what I mean?
[01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:08.228]  So that's about, yeah, 20 years, you know what I mean?
[01:16:08.308 --> 01:16:11.989]  I've been really doing my research, you know what I mean?
[01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:14.830]  And studying this whole thing, you know?
[01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.531]  So I started in the libraries, finding old books and just
[01:16:20.006 --> 01:16:20.567]  We're good to go.
[01:16:37.429 --> 01:16:38.550]  You know, just dumb criminals running around.
[01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:39.971]  A lot of them were very intelligent.
[01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:40.551]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:40.571 --> 01:16:41.312]  A lot of them... Exactly.
[01:16:41.652 --> 01:16:42.473]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:42.513 --> 01:16:42.753]  Exactly.
[01:16:42.953 --> 01:16:43.293]  And it's a...
[01:17:04.477 --> 01:17:10.359]  You know, it's a stereotypical thing that people look at us like, oh, whatever, he's just a, or whatever, you know what I mean?
[01:17:10.379 --> 01:17:28.564]  But anyway, a lot of my friends, you know what I mean, we would pass around information to each other, videotapes, or like, uh, uh, the Lum, um, I think it was called Illuminati 2000, uh, it was, it was this crazy show that we used to watch, and it had, uh, I forget the guy's name on there, I don't remember.
[01:17:28.624 --> 01:17:29.244]  Anthony Hilder?
[01:17:29.704 --> 01:17:33.385]  Yeah, exactly, Anthony Hilder, and the other guy with the glasses.
[01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:39.715]  Ted Gonderson, he just died over the weekend.
[01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:40.796]  Oh yeah?
[01:17:41.236 --> 01:17:41.496]  Yeah.
[01:17:42.117 --> 01:17:42.397]  Wow.
[01:17:43.017 --> 01:17:44.859]  Well, uh, Jordan Maxwell.
[01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:45.619]  Oh yeah.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.362]  They used to be on those tapes a lot with Anthony Hilda.
[01:17:49.822 --> 01:17:54.485]  So we used to watch those, we used to pass them around, and this is how we got more into it.
[01:17:54.525 --> 01:17:56.467]  We're like, damn, I started seeing these tapes.
[01:17:56.527 --> 01:17:57.087]  I'm like, hold up.
[01:17:57.508 --> 01:18:00.310]  This is the same thing that Dr. York was talking about.
[01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:02.551]  So I started, the dots started connecting.
[01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:03.572]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:03.892 --> 01:18:05.133]  When the internet came around,
[01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:16.284]  I would research all the things that I was learning from Hilda, Maxwell, York, and from everybody and then I bumped into you, your information, Alex Jones.
[01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:18.975]  I'm like, where?
[01:18:19.075 --> 01:18:21.317]  Everybody is saying the same thing.
[01:18:21.337 --> 01:18:22.377]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.358]  It's gotta be real.
[01:18:23.679 --> 01:18:24.259]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:24.319 --> 01:18:25.560]  And well, look at Skull and Bones.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.681]  ABC got footage.
[01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:29.724]  They're worshipping Satan, doing mock human sacrifices.
[01:18:30.024 --> 01:18:31.365]  Then I go into Bohemian Grove.
[01:18:31.405 --> 01:18:39.792]  Here are the Christian conservative leaders and corporate leaders worshipping a big stone owl and bringing male prostitutes in.
[01:18:39.812 --> 01:18:41.534]  And people are like, oh, let them have fun.
[01:18:41.874 --> 01:18:45.377]  The point is, they're not who they say they are out in the public.
[01:18:46.345 --> 01:18:58.552]  Yeah, they're doing all this ritualistic murder and rituals on little, you know, they're molesting little kids doing satanic sex rituals.
[01:18:58.812 --> 01:19:01.133]  This stuff is really going on in this world.
[01:19:01.433 --> 01:19:03.174]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:03.694 --> 01:19:08.377]  You got sick people like Jeffrey Dahmer and different people like that.
[01:19:09.797 --> 01:19:13.319]  I believe that it was a different background to it.
[01:19:13.639 --> 01:19:15.240]  Why he was doing what he was doing.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.721]  I think it was some ritualistic things going on.
[01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:18.542]  Absolutely.
[01:19:18.582 --> 01:19:20.562]  They set him up as one of their little ghouls.
[01:19:20.983 --> 01:19:26.505]  They always have their Renfields or their Igors, who are their minion servants.
[01:19:27.306 --> 01:19:32.608]  Look, it's now come out in the Chicago Tribune that Halliburton and DynCorp run giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:19:32.928 --> 01:19:35.289]  Guess who runs most of the private CPS grabbing?
[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:36.190]  DynCorp.
[01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:39.812]  And then they get caught in Europe and Asia running little kidnapping rings.
[01:19:40.172 --> 01:19:43.855]  Well, they just do it out in the open here and take your kids and then you don't know where they go.
[01:19:43.935 --> 01:19:46.977]  I mean, it came out in CNN in Florida five years ago.
[01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.078]  Thousands of children missing.
[01:19:49.399 --> 01:19:50.579]  And they found a bunch of them dead.
[01:19:50.599 --> 01:19:51.500]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.021]  Just like they're dealing the drugs.
[01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:57.384]  I want to talk about that with Prodigy Mobb Deep on the other side of this break.

[01:21:06.683 --> 01:21:12.547]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:21:13.127 --> 01:21:14.868]  Number one, study the past.
[01:21:15.389 --> 01:21:17.150]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.513]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:21:22.648 --> 01:21:24.910]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:21:25.731 --> 01:21:28.994]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:21:29.575 --> 01:21:34.300]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:38.044]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:21:38.624 --> 01:21:41.465]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.

[01:24:36.097 --> 01:24:41.018]  Gains for the year are raced in the stock market, deeper than post-TARP plunge.

[01:24:57.347 --> 01:24:59.048]  We'll be breaking it down later in the broadcast.
[01:24:59.068 --> 01:25:03.271]  This is a short segment, then our final segment with Prodigy of Mob Deep.
[01:25:03.652 --> 01:25:12.658]  We're going to get him back up in the near future and play some clips from the audiobook of his new book that's available also in book form, My Infamous
[01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:14.447]  I don't know.
[01:25:32.116 --> 01:25:49.282]  Constantly, you know, you've been talking about the different icon rappers that are making hundreds of millions of bucks, many of which you came up with and knew, who are just constantly selling the establishment view of the world, nothing but materialism, and constantly showing Illuminati symbolism.
[01:25:49.302 --> 01:25:52.423]  I mean, can you talk about why you think they're doing this?
[01:25:53.063 --> 01:25:55.104]  Are they trying to brag that they're with the Illuminati?
[01:25:55.124 --> 01:25:56.424]  Do they want to get into the Illuminati?
[01:25:56.764 --> 01:25:57.985]  Are they part of the Illuminati?
[01:25:58.505 --> 01:26:01.286]  And why are you angry about this?
[01:26:02.563 --> 01:26:07.830]  I mean, it got to a point in my life where I had to step back and look at my own self.
[01:26:08.551 --> 01:26:09.132]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:09.212 --> 01:26:12.977]  I had to look myself in the mirror like, like, what are you doing?
[01:26:12.997 --> 01:26:13.998]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:14.498 --> 01:26:19.164]  I was promoting a lot of the wrong things, you know, and at the same time,
[01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:23.836]  I was putting the information that I was learning through all these books.
[01:26:24.317 --> 01:26:24.757]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:24.797 --> 01:26:29.760]  From you, from Hilda, from York, and from everybody that I was learning from.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.741]  I was putting the information in my music.
[01:26:32.161 --> 01:26:32.902]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:32.942 --> 01:26:35.223]  I was like mixing the medicine with the food.
[01:26:35.643 --> 01:26:36.764]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:36.804 --> 01:26:40.146]  So they wouldn't be able to really taste it, but it was in there.
[01:26:40.366 --> 01:26:40.827]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:40.847 --> 01:26:41.347]  No, I got it.
[01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:49.512]  You were going with the bling and some of the nomenclature, but it was so basically people would come check out the real message.
[01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.831]  Exactly.
[01:26:51.451 --> 01:26:56.657]  I had to mix it in there somehow to spark people's curiosity.
[01:26:56.677 --> 01:26:58.219]  I was trying to be strategic about it almost.
[01:26:58.239 --> 01:27:00.101]  To spark people's interest in what else I had to say.
[01:27:12.154 --> 01:27:18.141]  You know, I got to a point in my life and my career where it's easy to get caught up in that lifestyle.
[01:27:18.602 --> 01:27:19.303]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:19.343 --> 01:27:22.046]  You know, fast money and all that type of stuff.
[01:27:22.066 --> 01:27:25.790]  You know, the sex, drugs, and rock and roll, quote unquote.
[01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:27.152]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.881]  You know, I had started slipping at some point, and I had to catch myself.
[01:27:32.401 --> 01:27:32.981]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:35.122]  And look myself in the mirror like, yo, Dawgs, what you doing?
[01:27:35.482 --> 01:27:36.062]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:36.462 --> 01:27:37.823]  Like, you're really bugging right now.
[01:27:38.223 --> 01:27:40.283]  Now, it's time to go all the way.
[01:27:40.403 --> 01:27:40.924]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:40.944 --> 01:27:42.344]  Because you're bugging.
[01:27:42.544 --> 01:27:43.224]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:43.284 --> 01:27:49.146]  So I had to catch myself, and I got to the point where I just got fed up, and I got pissed off, and I said, you know what?
[01:27:50.459 --> 01:27:52.941]  I'm not rocking jewelry no more, number one.
[01:27:53.361 --> 01:27:58.385]  I'm not doing certain things anymore and I'm doing it to make a statement, you know what I mean?
[01:27:58.705 --> 01:28:00.567]  To let people say, why is Pete doing that?
[01:28:00.907 --> 01:28:04.570]  Let's listen to what he has to say, you know what I mean?
[01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:10.915]  And basically I started looking at the other people in the industry and I just started
[01:28:11.966 --> 01:28:12.506]  We're good to go.
[01:28:35.715 --> 01:28:39.056]  You're saying bottom line, in a way, he's a turncoat.
[01:28:39.096 --> 01:28:44.298]  You know he knows all this information, but he's clearly decided to join it.
[01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:47.659]  He's decided to, hey, I'm gonna Benedict Arnold this.
[01:29:04.687 --> 01:29:12.135]  Yeah, I mean, from the looks of things, it looks like, uh, you know, that he has chosen sides.
[01:29:12.435 --> 01:29:13.096]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:13.836 --> 01:29:15.278]  Um, for lack of a better term.
[01:29:15.538 --> 01:29:16.479]  He's chosen a side.
[01:29:16.679 --> 01:29:17.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:27.750]  And the side that he chose is money, power, and, uh, you know, he doesn't really care to spread any type of information that might help save somebody's soul.
[01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:29.811]  Absolutely.
[01:29:29.891 --> 01:29:33.252]  Prodigy, this is a short segment, long final segment coming up.
[01:29:33.292 --> 01:29:35.373]  We'll give your websites out on the other side.
[01:29:35.393 --> 01:29:38.253]  Prodigy, Mobb Deep, I want to come back where we left off.
[01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:40.274]  This is powerful information.
[01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:42.934]  I've got a message to JC and others on the other side.
[01:29:42.954 --> 01:29:46.175]  I'll see if Prodigy will join me in this message.
[01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:46.915]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:46.935 --> 01:29:47.435]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.356 --> 01:29:52.256]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.757 --> 01:29:54.257]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.271 --> 01:29:58.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.954 --> 01:30:02.095]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:02.115 --> 01:30:08.799]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.059 --> 01:30:11.340]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.783]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.963 --> 01:30:19.764]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.004 --> 01:30:22.124]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.324 --> 01:30:28.266]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.586 --> 01:30:31.787]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.967 --> 01:30:37.488]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.749 --> 01:30:39.049]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:40.549]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:43.190]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:47.396]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.576 --> 01:30:52.062]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:30:52.202 --> 01:30:54.646]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:01.801 --> 01:32:05.425]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.825 --> 01:32:08.828]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:09.068 --> 01:32:13.852]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.872 --> 01:32:20.098]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.258 --> 01:32:22.501]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:23.021 --> 01:32:23.321]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.341 --> 01:32:23.761]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.841 --> 01:32:24.462]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.522 --> 01:32:25.782]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.802 --> 01:32:28.043]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.929 --> 01:32:48.833]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:49.213 --> 01:32:58.318]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.601]  Secret is a secret.
[01:33:02.881 --> 01:33:04.622]  Government that worship a owl.
[01:33:04.902 --> 01:33:07.644]  They practice witchcraft to harness their power.
[01:33:08.024 --> 01:33:10.545]  Pedophiles rape little kids for energy.
[01:33:10.605 --> 01:33:12.627]  It's a satanic ritual.
[01:33:12.667 --> 01:33:13.247]  W-T-C-R-I-P.
[01:33:13.267 --> 01:33:16.569]  They lit the pentagon on fire.
[01:33:17.129 --> 01:33:19.391]  That's lighting the pentagram on fire.
[01:33:24.034 --> 01:33:27.956]  Okay, we have a prodigy of Mobb Deep joining us.
[01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:33.000]  And of course, TheMostInfamous.com is his website to find out about concert tour dates.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:37.122]  Dallas the 14th, Houston the 13th, but I don't know why we always plug just where people are coming in.
[01:33:37.142 --> 01:33:46.148]  Texas, we're all over the country on the AM and FM dial, XM, Global Satellite, and of course, Shortwave and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:46.829]  We're going to be
[01:33:47.469 --> 01:33:53.792]  Breaking down the financial news, the police state news, Catherine Albrecht is also going to be joining us, getting into the whole control grid.
[01:33:54.693 --> 01:33:59.416]  But we're watching complete meltdown begin right now, and it's 100% mathematical fact.
[01:34:00.236 --> 01:34:05.199]  With the fractional reserve banking black hole system, they've created that this is going to happen, so that is
[01:34:06.219 --> 01:34:20.546]  Coming up, don't forget InfoWars.com as the online video bookstore, and we've added some great new camouflage, Don't Tread on Me hats that are very popular, and the new Liberty or Death red shirts that are the most popular shirt we've ever offered.
[01:34:20.566 --> 01:34:31.271]  Those are all available at InfoWars.com, and it is your purchase of the books, the videos that makes this transmission possible, and my growing news organization, and also the support of the sponsors.
[01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:32.772]  So again, InfoWars.com.

[01:34:41.358 --> 01:34:46.201]  And tonight, a 45-minute to hour special broadcast at 7 p.m.
[01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:50.083]  Central with Gerald Cilente and Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:34:51.404 --> 01:34:52.084]  In studio.
[01:34:52.184 --> 01:34:53.365]  Salenti will be via Skype.
[01:34:53.385 --> 01:34:57.046]  We're going to have Mike Adams in studio as he's moved to Austin.
[01:34:57.426 --> 01:34:58.627]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:34:58.727 --> 01:35:01.468]  Mike Adams is popping in live coming up here in about 10-15 minutes.
[01:35:01.828 --> 01:35:08.811]  And Prodigy has agreed to come back up in the near future to really do a detailed interview because there's so many points I want to get to.
[01:35:09.151 --> 01:35:11.632]  Now, running through these fast, sir.
[01:35:12.692 --> 01:35:21.337]  We've seen rappers in the media demonized lately, and you were one of the only people to actually come to their defense for calling out Obama.
[01:35:21.618 --> 01:35:25.600]  What's your view of President Barack Obama?
[01:35:26.881 --> 01:35:38.528]  I mean, my view on him is that, you know, number one, you can't be a president of the United States unless you're part of this bloodline that they got going on that goes all the way back
[01:35:39.207 --> 01:35:39.788]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:39.928 --> 01:35:41.089]  You know what I mean?
[01:35:41.129 --> 01:35:44.811]  So, they got this bloodline going on and whether people believe it or not, it's very real.
[01:35:56.192 --> 01:36:01.893]  You know, you will not be an American president unless you are linked and part of this bloodline.
[01:36:02.374 --> 01:36:03.634]  And Obama is.
[01:36:04.074 --> 01:36:05.534]  You know, he's a part of that.
[01:36:05.554 --> 01:36:08.035]  That's why he was allowed into the door.
[01:36:08.075 --> 01:36:10.395]  That's why he was placed where he's at now.
[01:36:10.495 --> 01:36:10.595]  Yeah.
[01:36:17.765 --> 01:36:20.430]  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a link.
[01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:23.897]  I heard a lot of people say, oh, well, all humans are related.
[01:36:23.997 --> 01:36:25.139]  No, I'm not talking about that.
[01:36:25.159 --> 01:36:29.267]  I'm talking about, you know, first, third, fourth, fifth cousins.
[01:36:29.327 --> 01:36:30.229]  Like, I'm talking about
[01:36:30.896 --> 01:36:33.517]  Very related, like, this is your family.
[01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:34.677]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:34.717 --> 01:36:38.998]  Your mother is this person's cousin, and like, I'm talking about real related stuff.
[01:36:39.018 --> 01:36:40.818]  Yeah, they would come to the family reunion.
[01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:41.899]  That closely related.
[01:36:42.079 --> 01:36:47.360]  Well, it turns out that Bush and Kerry, particularly, even MSNBC did a breakdown.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.221]  It's like, I got a French Bulldog.
[01:36:49.361 --> 01:36:51.141]  It's super related to all the French Bulldogs.
[01:36:51.421 --> 01:36:54.922]  I mean, it turns out they're cousins on every side, in every angle.
[01:36:55.162 --> 01:36:57.343]  Third cousins, fifth, ninth, tenth, fifteenth.
[01:36:57.543 --> 01:36:59.023]  I mean, it's just all related.
[01:36:59.616 --> 01:37:24.038]  Yeah exactly so you know Obama is a part of that and um whether he knows it or not you know I mean because I don't know that man I haven't got a chance to pick his brain so I don't know really I can only assume and I can only look at the facts you know what I mean and um from what I see you know I mean whether he knows it or not you know he's down with his whole um
[01:37:25.071 --> 01:37:29.276]  You know, conspiracy, you know what I mean, to rule the world, basically.
[01:37:29.436 --> 01:37:31.758]  He's a part of it, you know what I mean?
[01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:38.926]  And, you know, to brainwash people and to kill people, genocide, you know what I mean?
[01:37:39.027 --> 01:37:45.494]  Everything that's going on out here that is just so fantastic you really don't want to believe it, you know, Obama's down with it.
[01:37:46.090 --> 01:37:55.096]  Well, Prodigy, what about the fact that he increased the funding for the, basically, forced abortions and population reduction in Africa?
[01:37:55.497 --> 01:38:04.923]  I mean, that's the big litmus test for me, any leader, because it doesn't matter if you're white, black, you know, when people are, when 52% of black people in America are never born.
[01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:07.345]  I mean, that is definitely being targeted.
[01:38:07.785 --> 01:38:11.788]  And Jesse Jackson talked about this until he ran for president and then suddenly shut up.
[01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:13.409]  For me, that's the litmus test.
[01:38:14.548 --> 01:38:17.573]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff like that going on, man.
[01:38:17.593 --> 01:38:22.421]  There's definitely a lot of stuff like that going on, and, you know, it's sad, man.
[01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:28.551]  It's sad that, uh, you know, when people, when the election time was going on, when, you know, Obama was running for president,
[01:38:30.081 --> 01:38:35.402]  I was looking at all the candidates and, you know, I'm like, wow, this is really a black candidate.
[01:38:35.422 --> 01:38:36.323]  Like, do you know what I mean?
[01:38:36.363 --> 01:38:38.343]  It was amazing to watch that, you know what I mean?
[01:38:38.363 --> 01:38:44.025]  Because, you know, I'm black, I'm proud of my heritage, and it would be nice to see that, you know what I mean?
[01:38:44.045 --> 01:38:45.125]  That would be a beautiful thing.
[01:38:45.485 --> 01:38:52.107]  So I'm looking at everybody, though, and I'm watching, you know, the debates with the candidates when they debate each other and all that.
[01:38:52.887 --> 01:38:55.047]  And I'm really watching it close.
[01:38:55.427 --> 01:38:57.908]  I'm paying attention to what they're saying and what they represent.
[01:38:58.675 --> 01:39:03.006]  And I seen him do Ron Paul and things, certain things he was saying.
[01:39:03.026 --> 01:39:03.948]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:03.968 --> 01:39:04.690]  And I was like, hold up.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.204]  Ron Paul is the only one up there, like, really exposing people.
[01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.946]  Like, he's really saying something.
[01:39:12.166 --> 01:39:13.867]  Nobody else is saying nothing like him.
[01:39:14.368 --> 01:39:14.868]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:15.008 --> 01:39:16.610]  And the whole media came after him.
[01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:26.518]  One of my staff got a professional poll call the other day, and it was computerized, and they had the Republican candidates 1 through 7 with Ron Paul at the end.
[01:39:26.898 --> 01:39:29.441]  He tried to vote for Ron Paul, and it wouldn't let him vote.
[01:39:29.921 --> 01:39:34.627]  And they've caught Fox News dubbing in booze over him when he wins the big straw polls.
[01:39:35.288 --> 01:39:36.009]  Absolutely.
[01:39:36.069 --> 01:39:37.531]  That's where you can tell.
[01:39:37.812 --> 01:39:40.675]  If the media is behind somebody, then you know they're bad.
[01:39:40.695 --> 01:39:43.079]  If the media is against somebody, you know they're good.
[01:39:44.056 --> 01:39:44.456]  Exactly.
[01:39:44.676 --> 01:39:45.256]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:45.316 --> 01:39:47.057]  So, I had put it out there.
[01:39:47.077 --> 01:39:48.117]  I started doing interviews.
[01:39:48.157 --> 01:39:49.617]  They were like, yo, Prodigy, who you voting for?
[01:39:49.637 --> 01:39:50.618]  You voting for Obama?
[01:39:50.658 --> 01:39:55.779]  Because it was a popular thing in the rap community to, oh, vote for Obama, the first black president.
[01:39:55.819 --> 01:39:56.699]  He'll be the first black.
[01:39:56.999 --> 01:39:58.160]  You know, that was real popular.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.900]  And a lot of people just followed like sheep.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.421]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:04.441]  So, they asked me on the radio, oh, who you voting for?
[01:40:04.461 --> 01:40:06.902]  I said, if I was to vote, I would vote for Ron Paul.
[01:40:07.757 --> 01:40:08.357]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:08.397 --> 01:40:09.758]  And they were like, what?
[01:40:09.778 --> 01:40:11.358]  They couldn't believe I said that.
[01:40:11.519 --> 01:40:12.119]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:12.159 --> 01:40:17.181]  Like, everybody in the hip-hop community, they were just like, oh, Prodigy, you crazy.
[01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:19.281]  The first black president, he's black.
[01:40:19.622 --> 01:40:20.782]  Vote for him because he's black.
[01:40:21.062 --> 01:40:23.983]  I'm like, you don't vote for a person because he's black, first of all.
[01:40:24.283 --> 01:40:25.324]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:25.384 --> 01:40:26.384]  You vote for a person.
[01:40:27.565 --> 01:40:35.188]  No matter what their color is, you vote for them because of their intelligence and what they say they're going to do and, you know, what they are doing.
[01:40:35.228 --> 01:40:36.128]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:36.608 --> 01:40:37.068]  Exactly.
[01:40:37.088 --> 01:40:42.089]  You don't judge somebody by the color of their skin, but by the character of their deeds.
[01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:43.250]  Exactly.
[01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.030]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:51.932]  So, this is what I was promoting to people, and they tried to, like, almost demonize me, or like, say, oh, Podigy's crazy.
[01:40:51.972 --> 01:40:52.972]  What's wrong with this guy?
[01:40:53.012 --> 01:40:56.673]  He's just, oh, he's just ranting, and he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:40:56.693 --> 01:40:57.873]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:58.234 --> 01:41:01.194]  He's a conspiracy theorist, and he does this, and he does that.
[01:41:01.734 --> 01:41:04.135]  I'm like, wow, there's that many crazy people in this world.
[01:41:04.275 --> 01:41:05.656]  Well, hey, look who's been proven right.
[01:41:05.696 --> 01:41:10.157]  Continued the wars, the torture, the spying, the banker behavior.
[01:41:10.177 --> 01:41:16.259]  I mean, it's like Bush 3 here, or I guess Bush was really part 3 of his dad, so I guess it'd be part 4 or 5.
[01:41:16.319 --> 01:41:21.481]  Bush 5 here, because we all know that when Reagan was running things that it was really Bush Sr.
[01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:24.902]  Talk about a wicked devil on that front.
[01:41:24.962 --> 01:41:29.844]  Running through a bunch of questions here, and I'm glad Ron Paul was on my list here.
[01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:31.645]  Let's talk a little bit
[01:41:32.566 --> 01:41:34.327]  About 9-11.
[01:41:34.367 --> 01:41:35.629]  What's your view on 9-11?
[01:41:35.649 --> 01:41:42.115]  9-11 was basically a setup.
[01:41:42.475 --> 01:41:44.678]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:45.418 --> 01:41:49.062]  Definitely by this thing called the Illuminati.
[01:41:49.422 --> 01:41:50.163]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:50.183 --> 01:41:51.845]  That's another thing I want to touch on real quick.
[01:41:52.786 --> 01:41:55.869]  Illuminati is just a word.
[01:41:56.929 --> 01:41:59.010]  First of all, you know what I mean?
[01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:03.572]  It means to be enlightened, you know, the illuminating ones or whatever, whatever, right?
[01:42:04.113 --> 01:42:09.255]  You know, the original Illuminati, that original concept, you know what I mean?
[01:42:09.635 --> 01:42:16.019]  It comes from, you know, the essence in Egypt, in ancient Egypt, you know what I mean?
[01:42:16.619 --> 01:42:19.260]  The original Masons, you know what I mean?
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.621]  The Egyptian Mystery Schools.
[01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:21.641]  Exactly.
[01:42:21.741 --> 01:42:22.442]  It comes from us.
[01:42:22.842 --> 01:42:26.444]  And they took our information, basically, and they're using it for evil.
[01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:28.325]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:28.385 --> 01:42:30.686]  So, I just want to let people know the origin of this stuff.
[01:42:30.726 --> 01:42:42.613]  Like, they're taking our history, our, you know what I mean, my ancestors' history, knowledge, information, and they're using that power, which is God's power, and they're using it for evil.
[01:42:42.973 --> 01:42:54.322]  Well, it is true that Egypt 6,000 years ago or more was the first with the set up colleges on astronomy, but also farming, but also political control.
[01:42:55.583 --> 01:42:58.565]  And then, of course, that's why we're buried in coffins.
[01:42:58.585 --> 01:43:00.467]  I mean, it's all Egyptology.
[01:43:00.487 --> 01:43:05.110]  And that's what the Masons are, you know, or think they're hoarding the secrets of it.
[01:43:05.591 --> 01:43:09.174]  And then you have really the Illuminati being a modern branch of that.
[01:43:09.214 --> 01:43:11.075]  And really, it's a gang of people.
[01:43:12.176 --> 01:43:16.419]  Uh, and of course most masons or porch masons aren't even aware of it, and it's an idea.
[01:43:16.779 --> 01:43:18.180]  They can see, we can't.
[01:43:18.221 --> 01:43:19.662]  It's like They Live, John Carpenter.
[01:43:20.002 --> 01:43:26.226]  They Live, we sleep, and you put the sunglasses on, and now you can see.
[01:43:26.247 --> 01:43:28.428]  And what do they say when you can see?
[01:43:28.448 --> 01:43:30.169]  I got one that can see!
[01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:31.731]  Exactly.
[01:43:31.911 --> 01:43:33.473]  You know what I mean?
[01:43:33.513 --> 01:43:35.235]  So that word is just a word.
[01:43:35.295 --> 01:43:39.460]  It's a concept, like you said, for a group of people that are running things.
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.362]  That's probably not even their name, Alex.
[01:43:41.422 --> 01:43:42.063]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:42.083 --> 01:43:43.264]  They probably go by a different name.
[01:43:43.444 --> 01:43:45.687]  They probably have no name, but who cares?
[01:43:46.728 --> 01:43:51.853]  They call it the council the Supreme Council of 13 that sits above the Bilderberg Group.
[01:43:51.873 --> 01:43:57.799]  I've confirmed this by multiple high-level CIA and State Department people and Colonel Craig Roberts and others.
[01:43:57.839 --> 01:44:00.562]  I would never even say it till I'd gotten it confirmed over and over again.
[01:44:00.582 --> 01:44:05.988]  You notice the new super Congress is a model of that or a subgroup as above below in their rules.
[01:44:06.388 --> 01:44:10.212]  You have 6 House, 6 Senate, and Obama as the head of the Council of 13.
[01:44:11.152 --> 01:44:13.234]  Again, Jesus and His 12 Disciples.
[01:44:14.055 --> 01:44:15.156]  The 13 Colonies.
[01:44:15.196 --> 01:44:17.178]  They always repeat it over and over again.
[01:44:17.838 --> 01:44:18.099]  Yeah.
[01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:19.460]  Yeah, you know what I mean?
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.262]  But the bottom line is it's happening.
[01:44:21.562 --> 01:44:23.123]  It doesn't even matter what their name is.
[01:44:23.263 --> 01:44:24.064]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:28.288]  It could be the Round Table, Grand Wizard, Dummy.
[01:44:28.668 --> 01:44:29.209]  Dumbasses.
[01:44:29.289 --> 01:44:30.430]  Like, who cares what their name is?
[01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:31.371]  It's really happening.
[01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:32.331]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:44:33.112 --> 01:44:35.953]  The bottom line is on 9-11, you know what I mean?
[01:44:36.333 --> 01:44:40.053]  What they did was, they killed 20 birds with one stone.
[01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:41.294]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:44:41.314 --> 01:44:42.414]  That's how I like to say it.
[01:44:42.434 --> 01:44:43.314]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:43.354 --> 01:44:45.634]  Because they changed all kinds of laws.
[01:44:46.234 --> 01:44:53.116]  They changed all kinds of, uh... They changed people's mentality, the way they look at the world.
[01:44:53.636 --> 01:44:57.797]  They pulled off one of the biggest ritualistic murders.
[01:44:57.817 --> 01:44:59.717]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:00.811 --> 01:45:02.773]  It's the center of a pentagram, yeah.
[01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:24.871]  Yeah, so it was on fire.
[01:45:24.891 --> 01:45:28.173]  And they only do that in satanic rituals.
[01:45:28.413 --> 01:45:29.814]  They light pentagrams on fire.
[01:45:29.834 --> 01:45:30.774]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:31.134 --> 01:45:34.196]  So I think it was more than just, oh, something hit the building or whatever.
[01:45:34.276 --> 01:45:36.897]  I think they really lit it on fire for a reason.
[01:45:36.917 --> 01:45:37.898]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:37.938 --> 01:45:41.340]  Well, they admit that wars are ritualistic slaughter.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:43.761]  That goes back to the Romans with the gladiators.
[01:45:43.821 --> 01:45:45.422]  It began as a sacrifice.
[01:45:45.722 --> 01:45:50.365]  But instead of the priest cutting your heart out, we have people kill each other in the ring.
[01:45:51.225 --> 01:45:53.508]  Uh, and the ancient Greeks had human sacrifice.
[01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:56.412]  Um, this stuff does not, does not change.
[01:45:56.472 --> 01:45:58.875]  And for the outer initiates at Bohemian Grove, it's mock.
[01:45:59.196 --> 01:46:02.059]  But then for the inner initiates, uh, it becomes real.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.286]  And then once they've compromised you there, now you can engage in the mass murder and death openly.
[01:46:07.526 --> 01:46:13.069]  Now I've read, and I want to see if this is accurate, that obviously you have a right to defend yourself, a famous, wealthy person.
[01:46:13.089 --> 01:46:20.973]  I mean, guys that close donut shops at midnight are allowed to carry guns even in cities that have restrictions.
[01:46:21.433 --> 01:46:27.957]  And I've read that you got set up for having a gun to defend yourself, a multi-millionaire, probably 50 times over, I don't know.
[01:46:28.797 --> 01:46:31.979]  Well, that might be a little extreme to say that.
[01:46:31.999 --> 01:46:32.880]  You know what I mean?
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.682]  People might have the wrong idea of what really happened.
[01:46:35.702 --> 01:46:42.326]  Everything is not... And this will help calm people down a little bit too with all the conspiracy stuff.
[01:46:42.346 --> 01:46:43.086]  You know what I mean?
[01:46:43.106 --> 01:46:44.107]  Everything is not a conspiracy.
[01:46:57.956 --> 01:47:00.498]  But you have a right to have a gun!
[01:47:00.518 --> 01:47:01.699]  I think that law is wrong!
[01:47:19.651 --> 01:47:20.451]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:47:20.992 --> 01:47:22.573]  The gun was illegal that I had.
[01:47:22.593 --> 01:47:23.513]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:23.533 --> 01:47:29.376]  I have a right to have a gun as long as I follow the steps and follow the law and get it the right way.
[01:47:29.396 --> 01:47:30.237]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:30.637 --> 01:47:32.118]  The gun I was carrying was illegal.
[01:47:32.358 --> 01:47:33.459]  It was a legal firearm.
[01:47:33.519 --> 01:47:34.519]  I wasn't supposed to have it.
[01:47:34.559 --> 01:47:36.200]  I wasn't licensed to carry it, none of that.
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:43.367]  No, but see, there's only a few spots, Prodigy, where that's the case and a law that's unconstitutional is null and void.
[01:47:43.928 --> 01:47:47.191]  Look, I would use this example if you weren't here, because it's a good one.
[01:47:47.531 --> 01:47:47.912]  It's true.
[01:47:48.112 --> 01:47:50.594]  You know the first gun laws were against black people in this country.
[01:47:50.955 --> 01:47:53.898]  After the Civil War, they said we can't have those folks be in arms, so it started.
[01:47:55.499 --> 01:48:00.202]  There's only a few cities, Chicago, New York, and others, where it's almost impossible to own a gun.
[01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:10.087]  For me, it is crazy to especially be a famous person, with all the stalkers and stuff you've got, and to not have a gun.
[01:48:10.447 --> 01:48:12.768]  I mean, listen, I got a gun right here with me right now.
[01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:15.650]  And it's not because I'm living in fear, I'm living in strength.
[01:48:16.110 --> 01:48:20.913]  I mean, I gotta tell you, you were falsely imprisoned, and I know it's a way to, you know, man up and say, well, I did wrong.
[01:48:21.173 --> 01:48:23.254]  I'm not gonna say that I was put in prison, but...
[01:48:24.855 --> 01:48:30.720]  And I don't want to end the interview on that, but I mean, shouldn't you work to get rid of New York gun laws so everybody can defend themselves?
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.742]  I mean, yeah, that would be a beautiful thing, man.
[01:48:34.303 --> 01:48:38.226]  That would definitely be a beautiful thing to do that, you know what I mean?
[01:48:38.606 --> 01:48:40.347]  Yes, I think it's pure bull.
[01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.749]  I mean, I understand, you know, it's like good sportsmanship.
[01:48:42.829 --> 01:48:43.910]  Okay, I went to jail.
[01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:47.733]  I'm not going to say I was innocent, but I mean, well, okay, I'll use this one on you.
[01:48:47.753 --> 01:48:50.976]  There have been a lot of laws in this country that were unconstitutional, haven't there been?
[01:48:50.996 --> 01:48:52.077]  Yeah, there have.
[01:48:52.881 --> 01:48:53.581]  You're right about that.
[01:48:53.801 --> 01:48:55.722]  You're definitely right about that.
[01:48:55.742 --> 01:48:59.203]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:00.203 --> 01:49:02.044]  But, you know, I just wanted to let people know.
[01:49:02.144 --> 01:49:08.286]  It wasn't like... It wasn't like, oh, they came after me because he's talking this stuff in his songs.
[01:49:08.526 --> 01:49:09.387]  That's not what happened.
[01:49:09.587 --> 01:49:10.247]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:19.252]  Yeah, you never know with that.
[01:49:19.372 --> 01:49:20.132]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:20.532 --> 01:49:22.433]  It was definitely... I'll tell you this much.
[01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:31.216]  During my trial, the arresting detectives came on the stand and they actually lied.
[01:49:31.836 --> 01:49:34.016]  Like, cold lied in my trial.
[01:49:34.477 --> 01:49:35.517]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:35.797 --> 01:49:41.199]  I'm sure you've heard about the government now admitting they're bringing the opium in.
[01:49:41.219 --> 01:49:42.459]  Can you believe that?
[01:49:42.479 --> 01:49:43.019]  They just admit it?
[01:50:07.130 --> 01:50:14.875]  Well, listen, Prodigy, this has been absolutely incredible, and I really respect the work you're doing, and I'm glad you're getting a good message out to people.
[01:50:15.195 --> 01:50:22.219]  And I tell you, I know you love New York, but you ought to move somewhere where there's a Second Amendment, because you have a right to defend yourself.
[01:50:22.519 --> 01:50:27.342]  And I look forward to, what, having you back up in a month or so, and play some clips of your audio book.
[01:50:28.103 --> 01:50:28.863]  Definitely, man.
[01:50:28.883 --> 01:50:30.544]  I look forward to coming back, too, man.
[01:50:30.564 --> 01:50:30.985]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:31.005 --> 01:50:32.285]  I appreciate you having me up here.
[01:50:32.305 --> 01:50:33.226]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:33.246 --> 01:50:36.048]  I want everybody to follow me on Twitter, at Prodigy Maudeep.
[01:50:37.122 --> 01:50:37.602]  Absolutely.
[01:50:37.642 --> 01:50:38.623]  Give it out one more time.
[01:50:39.743 --> 01:50:42.425]  Follow me on Twitter.
[01:50:42.645 --> 01:50:45.686]  And then of course there's the main website to get the new book.
[01:50:45.766 --> 01:50:47.147]  Fire that out at us, Prodigy.
[01:50:47.847 --> 01:50:51.789]  Yeah, the main website is TheMostInfamous.com.
[01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:55.651]  And folks, follow me at TheRealAlexJones at Twitter and InfoWars.com.
[01:50:55.671 --> 01:50:57.031]  Prodigy, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:50:57.252 --> 01:50:58.552]  We got Mike Adams coming up.
[01:50:58.572 --> 01:50:58.992]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.012 --> 01:50:59.953]  We'll also look at the stock market.
[01:51:01.564 --> 01:51:02.045]  Question.
[01:51:02.405 --> 01:51:06.329]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:12.415]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[01:51:12.696 --> 01:51:18.161]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[01:51:18.221 --> 01:51:23.307]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:51:23.607 --> 01:51:29.649]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[01:51:30.089 --> 01:51:36.591]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[01:51:36.872 --> 01:51:38.092]  Who has access to it?
[01:51:38.452 --> 01:51:39.572]  How is it being used?
[01:51:39.873 --> 01:51:42.914]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[01:51:43.194 --> 01:51:49.876]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.

[01:54:10.648 --> 01:54:16.871]  And I was talking to Prodigy and we were going to really challenge Jay-Z and others that, hey, you can't sell out to the New World Order.
[01:54:16.911 --> 01:54:19.172]  You sell out for a while, they're going to destroy you in the end.

[01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:15.709]  is how you'll be able to see that just at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:16.990]  We'll have more breaking news then.
[01:55:18.851 --> 01:55:24.852]  They raided this place and they took mangoes, raw milk, raw milk cheese.
[01:55:24.872 --> 01:55:26.192]  You can buy it at Whole Foods down the street here.
[01:55:26.212 --> 01:55:26.812]  I know I buy it.
[01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:28.053]  Tastes totally different.
[01:55:28.073 --> 01:55:28.733]  It's so good.
[01:55:29.993 --> 01:55:30.713]  Guns drawn.
[01:55:30.753 --> 01:55:33.334]  Destroyed their stuff right there.
[01:55:33.354 --> 01:55:33.774]  $120,000 bail.
[01:55:34.154 --> 01:55:35.034]  Raided a dairy.
[01:55:35.714 --> 01:55:36.834]  Also not just the store.
[01:55:36.954 --> 01:55:38.715]  And this is all operating in plain view.
[01:55:39.615 --> 01:55:42.275]  It's just like they're arresting Amish now and people selling eggs.
[01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:44.836]  I mean, they are coming after everybody.
[01:55:44.876 --> 01:55:46.096]  Hey, you can't have a garden in your yard.
[01:55:47.256 --> 01:55:48.597]  Hey, can't speak at City Council.
[01:55:48.637 --> 01:55:49.758]  Hey, the police fired the mayor.
[01:55:49.798 --> 01:55:50.358]  They're God.
[01:55:51.118 --> 01:55:56.221]  And then it's in the news that the government, not just in Fast and Furious, is bringing the drugs in as well.
[01:55:56.641 --> 01:55:58.462]  That's in El Paso Times today.
[01:55:58.962 --> 01:56:01.123]  Going to Mike Adams here for this segment and the next.
[01:56:01.523 --> 01:56:03.244]  Mike, you've got breaking news for us.
[01:56:03.264 --> 01:56:05.485]  This story just gets crazier by the minute.
[01:56:06.343 --> 01:56:10.007]  Yeah, we have two pieces of breaking news and you're getting it first, Alex.
[01:56:10.027 --> 01:56:12.709]  This is not just seven minutes off the front lines.
[01:56:12.769 --> 01:56:18.175]  First piece is you know how you're always talking about the environmental police and how they're going to start cracking down on people?
[01:56:18.215 --> 01:56:19.116]  The Green Police!
[01:56:19.929 --> 01:56:20.329]  That's it.
[01:56:20.690 --> 01:56:22.031]  It's happening in L.A.
[01:56:22.071 --> 01:56:22.811]  County right now.
[01:56:23.031 --> 01:56:25.133]  News is that the D.A.
[01:56:25.653 --> 01:56:26.114]  of L.A.
[01:56:26.174 --> 01:56:36.962]  County there has refused to prosecute this case, so it's being turned over to a special environmental crimes prosecutor who specializes in raw milk crimes.
[01:56:38.075 --> 01:56:39.155]  I mean, can you believe this?
[01:56:39.215 --> 01:56:48.358]  It's actually environmental cops and prosecutors are now coming to the surface, and that's what they're going to be prosecuted under because regular DAs refuse to take this.
[01:56:48.378 --> 01:56:49.178]  They know it's ridiculous.
[01:56:49.198 --> 01:56:55.740]  Yeah, they create separate, just like they created eugenics courts to order sterilization, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s in this country.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:58.240]  Now they've created the Green Police.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:03.402]  And I remember the mayor of San Francisco saying, you've seen those Audi commercials with us arresting you for light bulbs?
[01:57:03.662 --> 01:57:04.542]  We're going to do it.
[01:57:05.285 --> 01:57:05.605]  That's it.
[01:57:06.106 --> 01:57:10.910]  So this person, James Stewart, is going to be charged with 13 counts.
[01:57:11.211 --> 01:57:15.114]  We don't know what the counts are yet, but we know they involve several felony charges.
[01:57:15.755 --> 01:57:18.478]  And again, the conspiracy charge that you already covered yesterday.
[01:57:18.958 --> 01:57:27.826]  Now, in addition to that, we also have news that there is a disinfo agent now spreading misinformation across the internet.
[01:57:28.587 --> 01:57:34.659]  And we suspect, but we can't yet prove, that that person has been turned by the feds and is spreading false rumors about... Of course!
[01:57:34.799 --> 01:57:38.105]  They go in, they tell an employee, if you say this you won't go to jail, and in my...
[01:57:39.389 --> 01:57:41.090]  We've got the alternative media.
[01:57:41.110 --> 01:57:43.132]  I would not even cover the disinfo.
[01:57:43.392 --> 01:57:45.453]  But obviously there's going to be insane lies put out.
[01:57:45.874 --> 01:57:49.376]  Just like we were lied about when we said that the flu shot was hurting people.
[01:57:49.736 --> 01:57:51.998]  It was confirmed later to be killing them.
[01:57:52.458 --> 01:57:53.739]  We were attacked and lied about.
[01:57:53.779 --> 01:57:54.900]  It's just, it's how they operate.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.563]  Another big piece of news that came from the front lines during the protests yesterday.
[01:57:59.623 --> 01:58:01.565]  That doesn't even count the protests that took place this morning.
[01:58:01.585 --> 01:58:03.286]  Oh yeah, people spontaneously confronted them.
[01:58:03.786 --> 01:58:04.126]  They did.
[01:58:04.466 --> 01:58:04.706]  They did.
[01:58:04.726 --> 01:58:05.627]  They showed up.
[01:58:05.747 --> 01:58:07.288]  Mariel Hemingway was there.
[01:58:07.348 --> 01:58:15.231]  There's an actor, let's see, Vincent Gallo, apparently a very popular actor, was one of the customers of that, or a member of that buying club.
[01:58:15.811 --> 01:58:16.371]  He was there.
[01:58:16.431 --> 01:58:17.572]  People began speaking out.
[01:58:18.072 --> 01:58:23.795]  And it was interesting, Alex, because here we have Hollywood celebrities talking about the police state.
[01:58:24.375 --> 01:58:25.355]  They're starting to get it.
[01:58:25.655 --> 01:58:26.656]  They're starting to wake up.
[01:58:27.036 --> 01:58:31.338]  In a sense, they've done us a favor by waking people up to what's really happening.
[01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:34.600]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.701]  It's the Green Police.
[01:58:35.761 --> 01:58:37.081]  Stay with us, Mike Adams.
[01:58:42.445 --> 01:58:43.706]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.082 --> 01:58:53.564]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:53.784 --> 01:58:58.811]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:59.091 --> 01:59:00.473]  Saving means to make money.

[01:59:10.146 --> 01:59:17.249]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:25.292]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:25.692 --> 01:59:30.614]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:58.971]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.818 --> 02:00:07.159]  You got a TDI here?
[02:00:07.459 --> 02:00:07.940]  Clean diesel.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:08.940]  You're good to go, sir.
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:20.148]  That's right, there's a checkpoint set up, but he's a good little minion.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:26.642]  And so, uh, he gets to go free and then police are arrested because they're eating and drinking out of foam cups.
[02:00:26.962 --> 02:00:28.083]  It's not a joke, okay?
[02:00:28.103 --> 02:00:29.283]  This is already going on in Europe.
[02:00:29.523 --> 02:00:31.124]  They're already banning the vitamins and minerals.
[02:00:31.404 --> 02:00:32.405]  Has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:00:33.005 --> 02:00:35.886]  Uh, Mike Adams, more breaking news from the health ranger.
[02:00:36.286 --> 02:00:41.988]  They have created a new special imperial green police court, uh, because the other courts won't do it.
[02:00:42.028 --> 02:00:42.989]  This is how tyrants work.
[02:00:43.029 --> 02:00:44.689]  They create new courts.
[02:00:45.150 --> 02:00:47.150]  And this is spun out of the eugenics courts.
[02:00:47.511 --> 02:00:48.971]  That's what the whole green movement is.
[02:00:49.351 --> 02:00:50.572]  Mike Adams, please continue.
[02:00:51.363 --> 02:00:56.867]  Yes, so this prosecution is apparently going to take place under this new environmental prosecutor authority.
[02:00:56.927 --> 02:00:58.227]  We don't even know where that comes from.
[02:00:58.247 --> 02:01:02.970]  The information right now is a little bit loose because this is breaking news happening right now.
[02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:12.837]  So they tell us radiation from Japan's good, they raised the safe level, all the toxic stuff, BP's great, but you try to, it's been confirmed they were selling devil mangoes.
[02:01:14.011 --> 02:01:14.231]  Right.
[02:01:14.551 --> 02:01:19.634]  Watermelons, raw honey, mangoes, raw goat milk and goat cheese.
[02:01:19.674 --> 02:01:29.879]  And remember, Alex, that the cops went in there and the LA County Sheriff's Department went in there and they began what can only be called a nutritional book burning.
[02:01:30.359 --> 02:01:40.404]  They began destroying up to $50,000 worth of fresh produce and whole foods and farmed fresh eggs, pouring the milk down the drain, loading up the food.
[02:01:40.444 --> 02:01:42.885]  And across the street, Alex, or just down the road,
[02:01:43.545 --> 02:01:46.446]  ...is a shelter for poor people who need food.
[02:01:46.986 --> 02:01:56.449]  And so right in the face of people who are starving in America, they are destroying food and proving who's the master and who's the slave in America's face.
[02:01:56.469 --> 02:01:57.049]  Come on, be reasonable.
[02:01:57.069 --> 02:02:01.530]  It's good they tried to put that woman in jail for 93 days for a tomato box in her front yard.
[02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:02.430]  Yeah.
[02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:05.012]  I mean, what type of sick people are you?
[02:02:05.032 --> 02:02:06.454]  Let me tell you something.
[02:02:06.474 --> 02:02:10.937]  Watermelons... By the way, they are arresting people everywhere for selling watermelons on the side of the road.
[02:02:11.238 --> 02:02:13.219]  They don't let little girls have lemonade stands now.
[02:02:13.479 --> 02:02:14.320]  The health department.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:21.006]  It's total control while the government... I mean, I was looking at the video of the cops that we posted at Infowars.com.
[02:02:21.026 --> 02:02:21.826]  You have a natural news.
[02:02:22.187 --> 02:02:23.408]  And they looked like
[02:02:24.188 --> 02:02:27.231]  People I've seen being let off of prison trucks to do work.
[02:02:27.291 --> 02:02:31.855]  I mean, they look seedy, oily, criminal, criminal eyes.
[02:02:32.195 --> 02:02:33.496]  I mean, God help this country.
[02:02:33.536 --> 02:02:35.358]  They've got hardcore crooks working for them.
[02:02:36.099 --> 02:02:46.828]  And what's beautiful about that, Alex, there's a silver lining to this, is that this is now waking up literally millions of people who have been sitting on the sidelines and not believing that this was happening.
[02:02:47.248 --> 02:02:55.714]  A lot of people who were skeptical about your show or our website or the things that we were saying, now they're saying, oh my goodness, this is real.
[02:02:55.915 --> 02:02:59.798]  Well Mike, just like yesterday, I sent your article to Drudge and you notice it went up.
[02:02:59.818 --> 02:03:03.120]  And I know that Drudge and others listen, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.803]  And we want to thank them for, I mean, look how Drudge is getting more and more hardcore.
[02:03:07.843 --> 02:03:08.284]  We love it.
[02:03:08.664 --> 02:03:11.805]  Of course, he's exploding in popularity as if he couldn't get bigger.
[02:03:12.965 --> 02:03:14.506]  And hopefully we'll get a new report out.
[02:03:14.846 --> 02:03:25.029]  I mean, my gosh, watermelons, watermelons, mangoes destroyed, and that the special enviro court to prosecute for the watermelons and other evil.
[02:03:25.049 --> 02:03:26.269]  You need to get that report out.
[02:03:26.609 --> 02:03:36.112]  Get it up at Infowars.com and Natural News, and we will get hopefully some of the big sites to carry it if his lordship, Matt Drudge, sees fit.
[02:03:36.812 --> 02:03:45.076]  Well, just to clarify, I don't know if it's an environmental court or maybe just a special environmental prosecutor who's going to take the case through the regular court system.
[02:03:45.516 --> 02:03:47.938]  No, but I mean, it's an environmental prosecutor is what I'm saying.
[02:03:47.958 --> 02:03:48.898]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:03:49.258 --> 02:04:02.185]  And the other element in this is that there were children who could not feed on their mother's breast milk for a variety of health reasons, and they were being raised on the raw goat's milk that was being sold in the store.
[02:04:02.225 --> 02:04:03.425]  By the way, let me stop you.
[02:04:03.525 --> 02:04:04.846]  If you go back to Doctors Even
[02:04:05.306 --> 02:04:19.853]  30, 40 years ago, Germany, Europe, here, they would say, get raw milk, or they'd even say, get the milk of a genny, or a female donkey, they say is even better in matching, and that's what the baby needs, but no, you will drink corn syrup.
[02:04:20.433 --> 02:04:21.874]  Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.
[02:04:22.674 --> 02:04:29.537]  Everybody knows in the nutrition field that raw goat's milk is the closest thing to mother's milk for an infant.
[02:04:29.897 --> 02:04:31.718]  And so there are many children in L.A.
[02:04:31.838 --> 02:04:37.741]  who today don't have their milk because of what these, what I can only call, government terrorists have done to the store.
[02:04:37.761 --> 02:04:43.043]  Yeah, I knew the goat was good, but, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[02:04:44.105 --> 02:04:48.812]  My understanding is that goat's milk is still the best, but probably either one is better than pasture milk.
[02:04:48.832 --> 02:04:49.473]  You're the expert.
[02:04:49.493 --> 02:04:50.295]  You're the health ranger.
[02:04:50.315 --> 02:04:51.536]  You're going to be with us tonight.
[02:04:51.556 --> 02:04:54.721]  You're also going to be in studio doing RT later today from our studios.
[02:04:55.042 --> 02:04:56.964]  Mike Adams, great job for filling us in.
[02:04:57.225 --> 02:04:58.366]  Catherine Aldrich, straight ahead.
[02:04:58.386 --> 02:04:58.747]  You bet.
[02:04:58.767 --> 02:04:59.128]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.776 --> 02:05:05.019]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:05.940]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.403]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.663 --> 02:05:10.223]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.524 --> 02:05:15.087]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.427 --> 02:05:15.868]  It's true.
[02:05:16.168 --> 02:05:20.731]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.032 --> 02:05:21.572]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.872 --> 02:05:25.155]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.455 --> 02:05:29.158]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.358 --> 02:05:29.899]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.139 --> 02:05:32.501]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.902 --> 02:05:36.285]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.586 --> 02:05:37.126]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.386 --> 02:05:41.311]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.531 --> 02:05:46.296]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:12.513]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.893 --> 02:06:14.374]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:27.808]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:06:29.966 --> 02:06:33.968]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:34.688 --> 02:06:37.809]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:06:38.529 --> 02:06:39.350]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:41.631]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.891 --> 02:06:43.411]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:43.692 --> 02:06:46.253]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.573 --> 02:06:52.815]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:06:55.896 --> 02:06:57.937]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:06:58.257 --> 02:06:59.138]  Others don't.
[02:07:01.974 --> 02:07:03.715]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:07:04.535 --> 02:07:05.456]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.796 --> 02:07:09.377]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.457 --> 02:07:11.939]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.959 --> 02:07:17.421]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.841 --> 02:07:24.064]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.484 --> 02:07:30.047]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.468 --> 02:07:34.150]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:38.633]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.933 --> 02:07:44.476]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.876 --> 02:07:47.838]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.438 --> 02:07:49.879]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:50.840]  It's here.

[02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:08.376]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.997 --> 02:08:11.959]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.907 --> 02:08:33.380]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go to Catherine Albrecht, who's done yeoman's work out there, exposing the total panopticon spy grid, as we of course have done for 16 years, but now it's beyond RFID chips.
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:35.903]  It's just total surveillance.
[02:08:36.523 --> 02:08:41.347]  Meanwhile, recession seen looming as jobless benefits end CNBC.
[02:08:42.368 --> 02:08:44.230]  We never left the recession and they knew that.
[02:08:45.188 --> 02:08:52.370]  And no matter how much money you give the bankers, and how much services you cut, we're signed on to $1,500 trillion.
[02:08:54.231 --> 02:08:54.491]  Okay?
[02:08:54.571 --> 02:08:55.752]  It's impossible to pay.
[02:08:55.852 --> 02:08:56.812]  We don't owe it.
[02:08:58.413 --> 02:09:01.534]  In fact, if you gave... I'm even getting into the math.
[02:09:01.554 --> 02:09:02.314]  What would happen if you gave...
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:11.087]  310 million Americans, their percentage of $1.5 quadrillion, how much would that be individually?
[02:09:11.227 --> 02:09:11.967]  It's ridiculous.
[02:09:12.328 --> 02:09:14.530]  In fact, Jaren, will you do that equation?
[02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:21.596]  Divide that $1,500 trillion by $310 million.
[02:09:21.756 --> 02:09:24.679]  I want to find out how much that is per person if we're going to pay that back.
[02:09:25.708 --> 02:09:27.709]  How much they say we know.
[02:09:27.729 --> 02:09:28.090]  14 trillion.
[02:09:56.348 --> 02:10:00.311]  That was reported on by Tarpley here, as he reads Italian, he speaks Italian.
[02:10:00.892 --> 02:10:03.133]  Will Germany save the Euro from collapse?
[02:10:03.173 --> 02:10:11.479]  I mean, it is just bedlam, and the stock market is down, the Dow is down 370.81, Nasdaq's 93.05, S&P 4205, and I thought it was going to be milk and honey with the debt deal.
[02:10:19.056 --> 02:10:24.624]  You see, which actually increases spending, and they announced the QE3 continued dollar devaluation.
[02:10:24.644 --> 02:10:28.950]  We're going to be covering that as the show goes on, but I wanted to get...
[02:10:29.963 --> 02:10:33.787]  Catherine Albrecht here on the broadcast with us.
[02:10:33.807 --> 02:10:42.115]  To also find out how her health is going, fighting breast cancer, and obviously all of us praying for her.
[02:10:42.135 --> 02:10:49.122]  I know I say a prayer every time I think about her, and all the other good, great people out there that are battling such things.
[02:10:49.162 --> 02:10:53.746]  I've got a wife and my mother and my grandmother who's actually battling
[02:10:54.787 --> 02:10:55.387]  Breast cancer.
[02:10:56.188 --> 02:10:58.069]  But I shouldn't even got into that.
[02:10:58.089 --> 02:11:02.150]  The point is that I have two daughters.
[02:11:02.170 --> 02:11:03.291]  It's just a terrible thing.
[02:11:03.311 --> 02:11:06.953]  And then you read about the bisphenol and all the rest of it helping contribute to it.
[02:11:07.813 --> 02:11:18.318]  But there is so much other news with Catherine Albrecht that I want to discuss with her today, really covering the waterfront.
[02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:22.640]  She's also a radio talk show host and author.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:29.743]  With just the full-on assault of control, where they used to deny that they were spying on us, now it's just out in the open.
[02:11:29.783 --> 02:11:39.369]  Face scanning cameras, license plate readers, biometrics at the airport, and our website is katherinealbrecht.com.
[02:11:39.829 --> 02:11:45.752]  She's also Dr. Albrecht, a master's in education from Harvard with concentration in technology innovation education.
[02:11:46.052 --> 02:11:47.493]  Katherine, great to have you here with us.
[02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:52.045]  Hey Alex, it is always such a joy to come on your program and a warm hello to all your listeners.
[02:11:52.065 --> 02:11:56.830]  They have sent just such beautiful emails and cards and letters of support.
[02:11:56.870 --> 02:12:00.874]  I've been battling breast cancer and I just wanted to say a warm thank you to everybody out there listening.
[02:12:01.274 --> 02:12:09.982]  I love you guys and it was just an amazing experience to see how much support is out there, how enormous, Alex, your audience has grown to become.
[02:12:10.103 --> 02:12:11.124]  I mean, you have listeners
[02:12:11.704 --> 02:12:18.425]  All over the world, and I know that because I've been hearing from them, and I just want to send just my warmest heartfelt thanks to everybody out there.
[02:12:19.206 --> 02:12:20.286]  Well, absolutely.
[02:12:20.326 --> 02:12:21.826]  Now listen, I'm here with Baited Breath.
[02:12:21.846 --> 02:12:30.448]  I know you gave us a message on your own show today that you do sometimes during the week, but always at least on Saturdays while you're battling this affliction.
[02:12:31.068 --> 02:12:34.088]  But, I mean, give us a preview.
[02:12:34.409 --> 02:12:35.989]  What is your health update right now?
[02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.669]  How are you doing?
[02:12:37.182 --> 02:13:04.731]  Well, the update is I've kind of picked and chosen the best from both worlds, and I know that there, I mean, what I've learned, there's a raging war going on between the people who are sort of the traditional oncology, conventional medicine folks, and, you know, dare I say it, the pharmaceutical industry on the one side, the, you know, the natural alternative health practitioner people on the other side, and I guess because I have an academic training, as you mentioned, I have a doctorate from Harvard, and I've spent a lot of time learning how to research,
[02:13:05.151 --> 02:13:07.192]  I've kind of picked and chosen the best from both.
[02:13:07.933 --> 02:13:12.716]  And so in my case, I have stage 3c breast cancer.
[02:13:12.776 --> 02:13:21.161]  So for people who are familiar with cancer, that means that the cancer in my breast had actually spread up into the lymph nodes under my arm, but it didn't go any further.
[02:13:21.941 --> 02:13:22.982]  And that's the good news.
[02:13:23.042 --> 02:13:42.820]  If you catch it in time before it actually gets into, you know, an organ or into the bones or metastasizes and puts you into stage four, if you catch it in time, then actually the conventional treatments, and I know this is going to be heresy on your show, but the conventional treatments actually add a tremendous amount to your life expectancy.
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:50.063]  So, in my case, you know, and I was just as skeptical as everybody else, I was like, oh my gosh, I'll never do chemo, I'll never do surgery, radiation, forget it.
[02:13:50.483 --> 02:13:59.867]  And the more I've actually researched it, because of my case, which is what's called locally advanced breast cancer, it's not just a little lump, it's not just a tiny little thing, they do a lumpectomy and that's it.
[02:14:00.447 --> 02:14:06.609]  And, you know, when people get that, lifestyle changes, diet, exercise, supplements can make an enormous difference.
[02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:12.851]  When you've got a big tumor, and mine was the size of a mouse, alright, so I want you to just picture a mouse, that's big.
[02:14:13.592 --> 02:14:16.753]  When you've got a big tumor like that, you must get it out of the body.
[02:14:17.193 --> 02:14:21.498]  Because you're putting so much stress and pressure on your body to try to eliminate it.
[02:14:21.918 --> 02:14:32.789]  If you have the surgery and allow them to remove that factory of cells, then you can go on to some of the other approaches to try to get the rest of it out of your body.
[02:14:32.809 --> 02:14:34.311]  And it's circulating around.
[02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:35.452]  It's in my lymphatic system.
[02:14:35.492 --> 02:14:36.293]  It's in my bloodstream.
[02:14:36.653 --> 02:14:39.494]  And it's trying to get a toehold on another part of my body.
[02:14:40.034 --> 02:14:50.837]  So in my case, what I've done is I actually am part of a cutting-edge clinical trial of a brand new drug down at Dana-Farber, which is one of the top cancer institutes in the country.
[02:14:50.897 --> 02:14:53.598]  That would be my other piece of advice to anybody battling cancer.
[02:14:54.138 --> 02:14:56.819]  Don't just go to your local hospital down the street.
[02:14:57.399 --> 02:15:01.100]  Get yourself, even if you have to get on an airplane, to a top-notch cancer
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:03.162]  Institute, a research institute.
[02:15:03.182 --> 02:15:04.943]  There's about a dozen of them across the country.
[02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:08.106]  MD Anderson is probably your nearest one down there in Texas.
[02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:09.027]  They're down in Houston.
[02:15:10.128 --> 02:15:11.829]  For me, it's Dana-Farber down in Boston.
[02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:13.271]  Both excellent institutions.
[02:15:13.671 --> 02:15:17.194]  You go there and you at least hear, what do you have for me?
[02:15:17.675 --> 02:15:18.956]  What is my prognosis?
[02:15:19.396 --> 02:15:20.758]  What does this look like?
[02:15:21.158 --> 02:15:22.399]  And they'll give it to you straight.
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:24.761]  Your oncologists want you to live.
[02:15:26.242 --> 02:15:30.406]  I don't know about the drug companies necessarily, but the oncologist absolutely wants you to live.
[02:15:30.767 --> 02:15:33.570]  And your oncologist will map out, here's what we do.
[02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:36.753]  Here is the best that we can offer from medical science.
[02:15:37.533 --> 02:15:42.138]  And I think anybody who doesn't at least get that consult and that information is missing out
[02:15:42.778 --> 02:15:47.681]  Absolutely.
[02:15:47.721 --> 02:15:53.163]  If you just go to the country hospital, even though they're great doctors, they've got 10, 20-year-old technology.
[02:15:53.664 --> 02:15:59.487]  It's the big research hospitals where my dad actually worked in high school and in college.
[02:15:59.527 --> 02:16:02.788]  He actually spent a lot of time at MD Anderson, years total.
[02:16:02.828 --> 02:16:05.850]  They had really advanced stuff even back in the 60s.
[02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:07.211]  Who knows what they've got now?
[02:16:07.251 --> 02:16:10.552]  But overall then, I mean, is all of this helping?
[02:16:10.572 --> 02:16:11.293]  Are you doing better?
[02:16:12.233 --> 02:16:15.796]  It is, because what I'm doing is I'm on this experimental trial.
[02:16:15.956 --> 02:16:18.077]  It's a drug that's shown a whole lot of promise.
[02:16:18.157 --> 02:16:20.459]  I'm going to be on it until October of 2012.
[02:16:20.819 --> 02:16:23.581]  So that's a long time.
[02:16:24.101 --> 02:16:25.442]  So I'm going to be in treatment for a long time.
[02:16:25.462 --> 02:16:30.446]  Most women after like four to six months, they're done with their breast cancer treatment and get on with their lives and just hope it never comes back.
[02:16:30.826 --> 02:16:34.349]  For me, it's going to be a longer road, but I'm feeling great.
[02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:38.712]  I am supplementing all of this, the traditional stuff, the conventional stuff I'm doing.
[02:16:39.052 --> 02:16:45.036]  I'm taking curcumin, I'm alkalizing, I'm drinking raw juices, I'm doing all of that stuff too.
[02:16:45.296 --> 02:16:49.659]  And when you put them together, you know, I think that's really when you get the best package.
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.741]  And, you know, I'm going to be writing some of this up.
[02:16:51.781 --> 02:16:55.884]  I actually had a bunch of people ask me, I was on Coast to Coast last night talking about this, a bunch of people wrote and said,
[02:16:56.144 --> 02:16:57.886]  Can you just write out what you figured out?
[02:16:57.986 --> 02:17:00.108]  Because I can't find anybody else saying this.
[02:17:00.588 --> 02:17:05.113]  You know, they're either saying, you know, don't do the conventional route, get rid of the chemo, don't even think about it.
[02:17:05.493 --> 02:17:09.857]  Or they're saying, you know, blow off all these supplements, alkalization, all this stuff doesn't work.
[02:17:10.318 --> 02:17:12.140]  And I'm trying to integrate the two.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.943]  So I will be writing that up and, you know, people want to stay tuned for that.
[02:17:15.963 --> 02:17:19.567]  I would love to, you know, share that as I get a little deeper into this whole process.
[02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:27.726]  Absolutely, and I'm just really glad that you're willing to even talk about this, because it affects so many people.
[02:17:29.306 --> 02:17:31.528]  All of us have a dog in the fight.
[02:17:32.069 --> 02:17:38.735]  And so we're all... One in eight women, Alex, one in eight women in their lifetime will actually be diagnosed with breast cancer.
[02:17:38.775 --> 02:17:39.776]  And that's horrifying.
[02:17:40.116 --> 02:17:48.564]  You know, you look at India, where they're in the sun, so they're getting vitamin D. Unlike us, we're indoors, you know, typing away on our computers or watching TV or in offices.
[02:17:49.204 --> 02:17:55.190]  In India, their breast cancer rates and prostate cancer rates, which I guess is the equivalent for guys, you know, the hormone cancer,
[02:17:55.649 --> 02:18:09.353]  They're a fraction of what we have, and it's because of the sunlight, the vitamin D, which, you know, we can supplement that, and it's also because they are eating this rich diet in spices and vegetables and natural foods and things that God put on this earth.
[02:18:09.873 --> 02:18:14.894]  So, you know, it's amazing to me, one in eight women in this country, it's like, I don't know,
[02:18:15.314 --> 02:18:29.149]  It's epidemic, but I mean obviously, Dr. Albert, you've looked at the bisphenol A. They admit it's hyper-feminizing women, making them go into puberty early, not just all the hormones in the meat, and then feminizing boys, and that it's really wreaking havoc.
[02:18:30.951 --> 02:18:31.771]  What a nightmare!
[02:18:31.891 --> 02:18:32.632]  And then soy.
[02:18:32.712 --> 02:18:34.693]  I mean, this is all stuff you've talked about on your show.
[02:18:34.713 --> 02:18:35.813]  You've got Teflon.
[02:18:36.233 --> 02:18:48.459]  You know, all this crazy stuff that we're just saying, oh yeah, it's safe, or... I had somebody tell me the other day, I was talking about Teflon, and they said, well, I was actually talking to a girl, she went and told her mom, we need to get rid of our Teflon pans, and the mom said, that's crazy.
[02:18:48.759 --> 02:18:52.060]  If it were so bad for you, it would be illegal to sell it.
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:53.881]  And I'm thinking, I'm rolling my eyes.
[02:18:54.281 --> 02:18:56.963]  Well, many cancers have doubled in the last decade alone.
[02:18:57.023 --> 02:18:58.924]  Diabetes has doubled in the last decade.
[02:18:58.944 --> 02:19:00.705]  The one common type.
[02:19:01.846 --> 02:19:03.327]  And it's a nightmare.
[02:19:03.867 --> 02:19:06.749]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are under eugenics attack.
[02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:09.511]  And everybody's compartmentalized.
[02:19:09.551 --> 02:19:11.433]  The doctors, the lawyers, the teachers.
[02:19:12.651 --> 02:19:15.492]  But it is the higher-ups know fully what they've done.
[02:19:15.512 --> 02:19:18.793]  And I get emails saying, hey, it's not that bad.
[02:19:18.813 --> 02:19:21.234]  I go to Target now and everything is Teflon-free.
[02:19:21.554 --> 02:19:24.515]  Yes, because Catherine Albrecht and many others educated you.
[02:19:24.775 --> 02:19:26.716]  Hey, suddenly they're saying bisphenol-free.
[02:19:27.196 --> 02:19:31.398]  Yes, because we warned you, but it's still in the juice box linings and all of it.
[02:19:32.058 --> 02:19:36.480]  Folks, I told people for years there's uranium in most of the fluoride they put in your water.
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:37.320]  Now that's admitted.
[02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:39.761]  It takes standing up and saying no.
[02:19:40.501 --> 02:19:42.003]  And let me tell you, I've been lazy.
[02:19:42.123 --> 02:19:42.904]  I've been unhealthy.
[02:19:42.944 --> 02:19:44.506]  But I'm trying to get myself healthy.
[02:19:44.526 --> 02:19:48.691]  I'm trying to have my house 100% organic and clean because I've got three children.
[02:19:49.231 --> 02:19:49.552]  Okay?
[02:19:49.752 --> 02:19:50.633]  Catherine Albrecht, stay there.
[02:19:50.653 --> 02:19:55.619]  I want to shift gears to cover the waterfront of the Panopticon takeover and transhumanism.
[02:19:55.779 --> 02:20:00.244]  Because when I wanted to set you up last week for the show, it's because I heard one of your rebroadcasts dealing with transhumanism.
[02:20:00.985 --> 02:20:07.108]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[02:20:07.368 --> 02:20:08.208]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:20:08.388 --> 02:20:12.250]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:13.731]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[02:20:14.031 --> 02:20:23.995]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[02:20:24.175 --> 02:20:24.775]  Really, Brian?
[02:20:24.795 --> 02:20:26.676]  The number one survival food?
[02:20:26.816 --> 02:20:28.677]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:20:28.937 --> 02:20:29.798]  Absolutely, Bill.
[02:20:29.958 --> 02:20:41.310]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[02:20:41.370 --> 02:20:43.292]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[02:20:43.512 --> 02:20:44.333]  No way, Bill.
[02:20:44.373 --> 02:20:46.915]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:20:47.055 --> 02:20:47.536]  These are the
[02:20:47.816 --> 02:20:50.417]  Absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[02:20:50.497 --> 02:20:52.878]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[02:20:53.158 --> 02:21:00.241]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're gonna need for nature's super survival food.
[02:21:00.481 --> 02:21:05.803]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[02:21:06.043 --> 02:21:14.025]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking mines, expanding paradigms and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[02:21:14.326 --> 02:21:15.386]  No one can deny
[02:21:15.566 --> 02:21:25.670]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[02:21:26.310 --> 02:21:31.132]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[02:21:31.312 --> 02:21:33.633]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[02:21:33.773 --> 02:21:36.394]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[02:21:36.694 --> 02:21:40.656]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:40.936 --> 02:21:50.041]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the free InfoWars Insider email with exclusive video and text reports as well as breaking news.
[02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:51.822]  Look in the mirror.
[02:21:52.042 --> 02:21:53.863]  You are the resistance.
[02:21:54.123 --> 02:21:59.746]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[02:22:01.476 --> 02:22:04.638]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:22:04.858 --> 02:22:12.862]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:22:13.042 --> 02:22:18.164]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:22:18.344 --> 02:22:21.246]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[02:22:21.326 --> 02:22:24.187]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:22:25.248 --> 02:22:28.429]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:30.911]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.071 --> 02:22:35.454]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.634 --> 02:22:41.338]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.438 --> 02:22:44.860]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:47.682]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.802 --> 02:22:52.705]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:52.865 --> 02:22:53.086]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.106 --> 02:22:54.507]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:01.491]  Meet Jerry D. Hi.
[02:23:01.791 --> 02:23:10.496]  Jerry and his family, like you, are very concerned about world conditions and have gathered many emergency preparedness items, including turtle tuft shelters.
[02:23:10.957 --> 02:23:20.122]  We have added two 24-foot turtle tufts to our supplies and feel very secure knowing our large family is ready for whatever the future may bring.
[02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:22.640]  TurtleTuff shelters are not tents.
[02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:32.688]  They are permanent yet portable four-season geodesic frame shelters that are as strong as a cabin at a fraction of the cost and are easy to set up, take down, and move anywhere.
[02:23:33.048 --> 02:23:34.289]  Available in two sizes.
[02:23:34.690 --> 02:23:39.253]  Get your TurtleTuff shelter and accessories included at TurtleTuffShelters.com.
[02:23:39.573 --> 02:23:42.576]  That's Turtle-T-U-F-F-Shelters.com.
[02:23:42.896 --> 02:23:43.437]  Or call 801-623-3288.

[02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:54.746]  Turtletoughshelters.
[02:23:55.067 --> 02:23:57.209]  Your all-season home away from home.
[02:24:22.782 --> 02:24:27.085]  No, it's not product placement for Mexican Mineral Water Tapachica.
[02:24:27.465 --> 02:24:28.785]  Lime flavor.
[02:24:29.426 --> 02:24:30.646]  But I wish they were a sponsor.
[02:24:30.666 --> 02:24:31.407]  This is good stuff.
[02:24:34.889 --> 02:24:40.732]  A roll!
[02:24:41.512 --> 02:24:43.613]  Just like the Pied Piper!
[02:24:45.994 --> 02:24:48.096]  Turned out kinda loose!
[02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:55.552]  Swing!
[02:24:55.712 --> 02:24:56.953]  Of Destruction!
[02:24:58.195 --> 02:25:00.917]  Alright, that's our good friend Dave Mustaine, the one, the only.
[02:25:01.037 --> 02:25:08.164]  His metal brain corrodes.
[02:25:08.465 --> 02:25:11.728]  Alright, let's go back to Katherine Albrecht.
[02:25:14.059 --> 02:25:17.200]  I've had a little anxiety right now about the stock market, even though I'm not in it.
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:20.822]  It's connected to our entire economy, so I tend to goof off when I'm upset.
[02:25:22.043 --> 02:25:31.887]  Catherine Albrecht, I want to cover the whole situation with Google and all their spying, but now you guys have really developed some great things with StartPage.
[02:25:31.907 --> 02:25:33.608]  We'll do that coming up at the end of the hour.
[02:25:33.928 --> 02:25:48.093]  But let's start getting into transhumanism and how they're pushing it like it's a great thing and really selling us eugenics and telling us it's a foregone conclusion and cover some of the biggest threats to privacy and really human dignity that we see with the Big Brother system.
[02:25:48.666 --> 02:25:54.991]  You know, that is the culmination of so much of this technology, and I don't think people quite get the big picture.
[02:25:55.652 --> 02:26:01.537]  And, you know, it's hard to when you're right in the middle of it, because, you know, each thing that comes at you, you see it for the individual piece it is.
[02:26:01.577 --> 02:26:12.186]  But if we step back and look at this forest of trees that we've been creating, and then take a look at what these transhumanists are actually talking about, it's all taking form.
[02:26:12.506 --> 02:26:25.427]  And I say that in like the darkest sort of sci-fi horror movie sense, that all of these little disparate pieces that have been put in place, you can almost picture them as like, well, we could call them a net, couldn't we?
[02:26:25.467 --> 02:26:26.368]  We could call them a web!
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.581]  We could refer to them in all these terms.
[02:26:28.601 --> 02:26:29.361]  You know, what is a net?
[02:26:29.422 --> 02:26:31.383]  It's designed to catch things.
[02:26:31.443 --> 02:26:32.183]  What is a web?
[02:26:32.243 --> 02:26:34.685]  It's designed to trap prey.
[02:26:35.325 --> 02:26:47.312]  And we have essentially now created with our technology what IBM and HP and a bunch of these companies are referring to as sort of this global life form, this global skin.
[02:26:47.973 --> 02:26:56.438]  And they are envisioning a time when each one of us becomes sort of a node in a nervous system of this gigantic sentient
[02:26:56.698 --> 02:26:58.939]  It's a worldwide, global entity.
[02:26:59.259 --> 02:27:01.561]  And it's a really disturbing concept.
[02:27:01.981 --> 02:27:10.025]  I've been saying this for, gosh, ten, twelve years, and as your listeners may know, and listeners to my show know, you know, I'm a born-again, Bible-believing Christian.
[02:27:10.385 --> 02:27:18.230]  I, since the age of eight years old, was warned about the Mark of the Beast, and at eight years old, in the 1970s, I had no idea how any of that could happen.
[02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:19.590]  How could you buy and sell with a number?
[02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.211]  I don't get that.
[02:27:20.271 --> 02:27:26.254]  How could you have a system that would require every... that could cut people off from buying and selling?
[02:27:26.394 --> 02:27:27.094]  That's the thing.
[02:27:27.114 --> 02:27:41.322]  It's being sold like it's the best thing since sliced bread, but the architecture's designing it to track all of us in real time, to manipulate cultures, societies, to gauge systems, as Google says, to predict mass movements, to predict the future.
[02:27:41.342 --> 02:27:47.105]  I mean, this is about the globalists playing God, and they're selling it like, oh, it's going to empower you, you're going to live longer.
[02:27:47.125 --> 02:27:53.989]  And sure, this stuff could be positive if it was built that way, but in every case, it's built to totally enslave us.
[02:27:54.429 --> 02:28:09.653]  Well, and not only that, and you've totally pegged it, Alex, but not only that, you know, as a Christian, and I know you are as well, you look at things that give humans enormous amounts of power, and you say, you know, that'd be a really great thing if we weren't living in a fallen world.
[02:28:09.753 --> 02:28:17.680]  You know, if everybody was great, if everybody was perfect, if everybody wanted the best for everybody else, and was above board and ethical, power would be a wonderful thing to have.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:30.090]  But as you and I both know, you create power, you put it out into the world, and what inevitably happens is that people will take it, they'll twist it, they'll abuse it, they'll use it to further their own ends and essentially stomp on everybody else.
[02:28:30.570 --> 02:28:53.666]  So, what we've now been creating, and I think, you know, this idea of sort of the global matrix and, you know, all the things that you talk about on your show, the power that we've put into the hands of those who would take it up over our own individual lives, the power of surveillance, the power of knowledge about us, and ultimately it will be the power to control us, to control, you know, everything from the appliances in our home to the thoughts in our heads.
[02:28:54.206 --> 02:28:56.387]  That kind of power has now been created.
[02:28:56.427 --> 02:29:00.150]  That is the, sort of, the promise and the threat of technology.
[02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:01.751]  And, you know, it's funny.
[02:29:01.771 --> 02:29:12.019]  I was talking about Facebook the other night, and I was talking about how Facebook was denying that their facial recognition programs were any kind of a problem.
[02:29:12.039 --> 02:29:16.123]  And they said, you know, it's up to you whether you choose to post your face on Facebook or not.
[02:29:16.183 --> 02:29:17.124]  Totally your decision.
[02:29:17.484 --> 02:29:18.705]  You could post an avatar.
[02:29:18.745 --> 02:29:20.486]  You don't have to put your face up there.
[02:29:20.827 --> 02:29:28.853]  But, of course, we know Zuckerberg's sister said they want to get rid of anonymity completely, so everybody... He called his users, you know, dumb idiots because they trust him.
[02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:38.240]  This is a nightmare system of control, and I want to look at different aspects with it, with Dr. Katherine Albert, who really studies these areas.
[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:43.645]  And then I want to get into transhumanist Ray Kurzweil, and the rest of it on the other side.
[02:29:43.685 --> 02:29:45.346]  I'm Alex Jones, GCNLive.com.
[02:29:45.486 --> 02:29:47.628]  Got a lot of key news up right now as well.
[02:29:51.250 --> 02:29:52.151]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.652 --> 02:29:54.253]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.194 --> 02:29:57.876]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.198 --> 02:30:04.242]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:04.542 --> 02:30:08.928]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[02:30:09.148 --> 02:30:16.578]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price at
[02:30:16.598 --> 02:30:16.978]  I think so.
[02:30:38.632 --> 02:30:39.293]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.755 --> 02:31:01.877]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.937 --> 02:31:08.604]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.864 --> 02:31:11.147]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.407 --> 02:31:16.613]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.793 --> 02:31:19.576]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.837 --> 02:31:21.919]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:28.083]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.403 --> 02:31:31.605]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.765 --> 02:31:37.309]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.549 --> 02:31:38.870]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:40.351]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.491 --> 02:31:43.052]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.173 --> 02:31:47.215]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.395 --> 02:31:49.417]  You can find the video at www.
[02:31:50.317 --> 02:31:54.159]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:54.179 --> 02:31:54.779]  Number one.
[02:32:05.885 --> 02:32:09.868]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:10.168 --> 02:32:14.710]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.051 --> 02:32:15.491]  It's true.
[02:32:15.791 --> 02:32:21.214]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.495 --> 02:32:24.777]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.077 --> 02:32:28.779]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.979 --> 02:32:29.540]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:32.142]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.542 --> 02:32:35.946]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.226 --> 02:32:36.766]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.027 --> 02:32:40.950]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.170 --> 02:32:45.935]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.215 --> 02:32:50.241]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.381 --> 02:32:51.943]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.163 --> 02:32:54.266]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.426 --> 02:32:56.770]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:17.619 --> 02:33:19.280]  We're good to go.
[02:33:40.063 --> 02:33:43.948]  Alright, we're going back to Dr. Kathryn Albrecht here in just a minute or two.
[02:33:44.609 --> 02:33:48.194]  And, by the way, we're going to have a bunch of very informative guests tomorrow.
[02:33:48.214 --> 02:33:51.178]  We're going to continue to watch this stock market plunging.
[02:33:51.218 --> 02:33:54.222]  In fact, if you guys will put back on the PrisonPlanet.tv view screen.
[02:33:55.926 --> 02:33:58.407]  The stock graph right now.
[02:33:58.567 --> 02:33:59.708]  I will give people the numbers.
[02:34:00.028 --> 02:34:01.429]  Hit refresh on that baby for me.
[02:34:02.169 --> 02:34:07.772]  Last time I checked, the stock market had dropped in the Dow 391 points.
[02:34:09.653 --> 02:34:12.614]  And now it has gone back up a tiny bit, 366.
[02:34:12.854 --> 02:34:13.915]  So that's good.
[02:34:13.975 --> 02:34:16.896]  That slide, at least for now, has been corrected.
[02:34:16.956 --> 02:34:20.198]  But they're talking about all-out European collapse, U.S.
[02:34:20.238 --> 02:34:20.618]  collapse.
[02:34:21.158 --> 02:34:23.121]  After they got their debt ceiling increase.
[02:34:23.462 --> 02:34:26.367]  Go deeper into debt to us with Fiat stuff we make up.
[02:34:28.148 --> 02:34:31.551]  And, you know, we will give you some future.
[02:34:31.571 --> 02:34:33.212]  And then you give in to them and things get worse.
[02:34:33.653 --> 02:34:38.116]  They say it's the biggest rout since the pre-banker bailout days.
[02:34:39.037 --> 02:34:40.959]  So, as you can see, it's not fixing things.
[02:34:40.979 --> 02:34:43.060]  We're going to Catherine Albrecht here in a moment.
[02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:50.786]  First off, it is your purchase of books, videos, t-shirts, baseball caps that fund this operation.
[02:34:51.707 --> 02:34:57.930]  Little knickknacks here and there, like the t-shirts and hats, also help you reach out to other like-minded people.
[02:34:58.210 --> 02:35:02.612]  Look, you can tell how certified redneck I am once I'm wearing this Camouflage Don't Tread on Me hat.
[02:35:03.132 --> 02:35:08.715]  I talk about getting the word out and showing off to your buddies at the golf course or when you're hunting.
[02:35:08.735 --> 02:35:09.816]  Hey, what's Infowars.com?
[02:35:10.856 --> 02:35:14.539]  You can tell them you're part of the evil, you know, Tea Party people.
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:16.241]  And then, of course, there's this shirt.
[02:35:16.801 --> 02:35:17.642]  This is our bestseller.
[02:35:18.042 --> 02:35:20.925]  Liberty or Death with the Don't Tread on Me snake.
[02:35:21.345 --> 02:35:26.129]  And that, and that funds our operation here at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:26.149 --> 02:35:27.510]  And lastly, our great sponsors.
[02:35:28.451 --> 02:35:36.557]  Folks like eFoods Direct, they're celebrating their 30th anniversary with a great deal, say 30% off the Freedom Unit, a one-year food supply.
[02:35:37.037 --> 02:35:45.463]  Here's your chance to save $536.70 off their already low price for a one-year supply of the best durable foods on the planet.
[02:35:46.004 --> 02:35:52.208]  The price is even lower for the same volume of food that it was when we first started back in 1981.
[02:35:52.569 --> 02:35:53.990]  This offer ends, so act now.
[02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:55.850]  Quantities are limited.
[02:35:56.131 --> 02:35:57.631]  Be prepared before you need it.
[02:35:57.811 --> 02:35:58.231]  Act now.
[02:35:58.372 --> 02:36:06.295]  efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex or 800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:36:06.655 --> 02:36:08.656]  And lastly, purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:08.676 --> 02:36:10.636]  I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:12.324 --> 02:36:12.444]  We're
[02:36:34.934 --> 02:36:38.236]  We'll filter radioactive isotopes that the government's adding in the fluoride.
[02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:40.497]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[02:36:40.757 --> 02:36:42.278]  I know that's even more wicked.
[02:36:42.919 --> 02:36:50.843]  Check out their banners at PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com to take control of your water supply today!
[02:36:53.044 --> 02:36:54.425]  Okay, going back to Katherine Albert.
[02:36:54.445 --> 02:37:03.512]  Katherine, this is our long segment here, so let's just go through a cornucopia of the surveillance systems that are violating our rights everywhere.
[02:37:03.952 --> 02:37:14.820]  The transhumanist, I've heard you say some really informative things on that subject and how it's being rolled out as trendy to have the microchips put in your brain, not a system of enslavement.
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.461]  Katherine, go over it for us.
[02:37:16.946 --> 02:37:22.369]  Yeah, you know there's a whole bunch of stuff going on and I've just got a couple of things in the news to kind of anchor some of this.
[02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:23.550]  I know you've talked about these things.
[02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:29.233]  You know the Interpol chief calling for a global ID card so they can manage all of this immigration.
[02:37:29.693 --> 02:37:35.536]  That is falling right in the hands or right on the heels of L1 Identity Solutions.
[02:37:35.576 --> 02:37:39.378]  Now that's the big biometrics company.
[02:37:39.438 --> 02:37:40.059]  It's a U.S.
[02:37:40.099 --> 02:37:43.961]  company started by all the CIA spooks and NSA and Homeland Security guys.
[02:37:44.461 --> 02:37:47.062]  And they've been making a fortune off of this.
[02:37:47.102 --> 02:37:53.565]  They sold the company for billions, literally, to a French company called Safran, S-A-F-R-A-N.
[02:37:54.065 --> 02:37:58.467]  Now you've got a French company that owns, it's now the biggest biometrics company on the globe.
[02:37:58.587 --> 02:38:01.108]  It is owned by the French government, no less.
[02:38:01.588 --> 02:38:04.930]  And now they are in charge of all of our biometrics.
[02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.951]  It's going global.
[02:38:06.411 --> 02:38:08.733]  You've got Interpol saying we need a global ID card.
[02:38:08.773 --> 02:38:10.414]  You've got these global companies.
[02:38:10.454 --> 02:38:22.741]  And in fact, both L1, you know, which is the biggest company you've never heard of, and Saffron are both working together saying, hey, you know, this is just going to move us closer to the global management of biometric identities.
[02:38:22.761 --> 02:38:23.542]  So there's a big one.
[02:38:24.122 --> 02:38:42.632]  You've also got going on, sort of here on our soil, you've got this House Judicial Committee, Judiciary Committee, approving a bill, or at least giving a thumbs up, sending it back to the House now, that all ISPs would be required to log all of your internet activities for a period of one year.
[02:38:42.652 --> 02:38:51.457]  Now that's heavy, because what that means is that without a warrant, law enforcement, this is actually part of the bill, law enforcement would be able to get into those records,
[02:38:51.937 --> 02:38:53.878]  Pinpoint anybody or everybody.
[02:38:53.898 --> 02:39:03.944]  I mean, they could just do it as a blanket and say, I want to know everybody who goes to Infowars.com or to KatherineAlbrecht.com or to StartPage.com or wherever the heck it is, and they would be able to access that list.
[02:39:03.984 --> 02:39:07.827]  Now, that bill, I have to say it right here now, that bill cannot stand.
[02:39:08.167 --> 02:39:09.528]  We cannot allow that to pass.
[02:39:09.568 --> 02:39:16.352]  That's got to be, I think, the biggest battle that we're going to fight in this legislative season is going to be that bill.
[02:39:17.092 --> 02:39:19.794]  California has a bill right now requiring all
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:22.661]  Shelter pets to be microchipped.
[02:39:22.701 --> 02:39:24.743]  So they're moving sort of through the animals.
[02:39:24.803 --> 02:39:38.712]  Let's get the animals chipped, and then once you're used to chipping your pet, then you want to chip your kid, then you want to chip grandma, and then you want to chip the nuclear workers, and then you want to chip, you know, every... the teachers in the schools... Reuters reported like nine years ago...
[02:39:39.292 --> 02:39:46.097]  That they wanted to forcibly chip, and it was a policy, but when it got attention, they backed off the California prisoners.
[02:39:46.578 --> 02:39:51.742]  I mean, this is just, this is just, they're assailing us with this until we get conditioned to it.
[02:39:52.236 --> 02:39:53.017]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:39:53.217 --> 02:40:01.987]  And, you know, years ago, the thought of putting a microchip into an animal, there wouldn't be a person in this country who wouldn't be outraged at that and say, you know, Mark of the Beast, come on, let's be real here.
[02:40:02.368 --> 02:40:06.593]  We're talking about transmitting a number, and we know that that can be put into human beings.
[02:40:06.673 --> 02:40:07.494]  It's been done.
[02:40:07.654 --> 02:40:10.718]  People have had these things implanted in them, in their hands even.
[02:40:11.198 --> 02:40:12.319]  So, it is.
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:14.982]  It's a slow wearing down.
[02:40:15.002 --> 02:40:24.813]  And, you know, because the human lifespan is relatively short, you know, all the people who were worrying about the social security number back in the 1920s, you know, 1930s, they're all dead.
[02:40:25.133 --> 02:40:28.437]  And the rest of us are like, yeah, we're born into a world where they make us have a social.
[02:40:29.737 --> 02:40:37.101]  You look at the microchips, all of us who are opposing the microchips, you know, at some point, down the road, it's going to be a whole new generation.
[02:40:37.181 --> 02:40:44.425]  And they've already found that younger people today, they're much more open to this idea of implants that could manage their cell phones or their Facebook contacts.
[02:40:44.485 --> 02:40:48.108]  And at all the big video game conferences, they have speaker after speaker.
[02:40:48.408 --> 02:40:49.408]  It's obviously a talking point.
[02:40:49.428 --> 02:40:55.713]  Get up and say, soon you're going to have a chip in you that tracks everything you do and you'll be able to play the game better.
[02:40:55.813 --> 02:40:59.575]  And then soon you won't be able to play the game if you don't have the chip.
[02:41:00.036 --> 02:41:01.757]  And then you expand out from there.
[02:41:03.158 --> 02:41:07.541]  They're just completely selling everyone on accepting this.
[02:41:07.961 --> 02:41:20.313]  Well, that's part of the matrix that you talk about, is once we take these chips into our bodies and we plug our brains into this network, which really is what the transhumanists are talking about, you know, we're going to dump these human bodies.
[02:41:21.094 --> 02:41:30.263]  You look at what Ray Kurzweil has to say, and Peter Cochran is another one, C-O-C-H-R-A-N-E, he's out of England, and he wrote a horrifying thing
[02:41:30.763 --> 02:41:36.706]  About dumping our bodies and becoming cyborgs, and he really sums it up in an essay he wrote.
[02:41:37.087 --> 02:41:55.397]  He says there's going to be a point when we're going to just dump these bodies, we will all upload our consciousness into a massive entity, and that entity will be freed from the constraints of gravity and time and space, and it will be able to fly out into the universe looking for other bodies to inhabit.
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:41:57.121]  I'm not making that up.
[02:41:57.161 --> 02:41:59.942]  Now, if that's not demon possession, I don't know what is.
[02:42:00.623 --> 02:42:07.968]  So, this notion that our technology is just making life more convenient, you know, the dishwasher helps mom, whatever, that's out the window.
[02:42:08.028 --> 02:42:21.437]  These guys are really talking about the next level of technology where we dump these human bags of flesh, which is how they view them, and then we all become one with sort of this master global consciousness.
[02:42:21.537 --> 02:42:23.238]  And I gotta say, when I read the Bible,
[02:42:23.758 --> 02:42:28.863]  And I read the book of Revelation and it talks about the beast of the end time that will control everything.
[02:42:29.263 --> 02:42:31.845]  I say, you know, that's exactly what that's going to look like.
[02:42:32.206 --> 02:42:34.908]  Because if we build it, you know, it's like field of dreams.
[02:42:34.968 --> 02:42:36.149]  If you build it, they will come.
[02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:41.955]  As we build this system, you know, Google, and I want to get into Google in a minute, they want to be the mind of God.
[02:42:42.175 --> 02:42:44.357]  That's an actual quote from one of the Google founders.
[02:42:44.377 --> 02:42:45.938]  They want to be the mind of God.
[02:42:46.379 --> 02:42:48.721]  So if we create this and
[02:42:49.261 --> 02:43:05.937]  And we've got the ability to be omniscient and have everyone uploaded into it and interconnected with it and brain merged with it, then that is going to be the perfect storm for Satan, the beast, to come in and say, you know, mwahaha, I now own you.
[02:43:06.917 --> 02:43:19.686]  And, you know, you look at what the Mark of the Beast is about, and I really think, you know, and I've sat with this since I was eight years old, I really think this idea of needing a mark to buy and sell, which, and it's not just taking the mark that damns you, it's worshipping the beast.
[02:43:20.067 --> 02:43:31.435]  There's going to be a moment at some point in our future, maybe not so far off, where you're going to be asked, listen, you're going to swear allegiance, you're going to take this thing, and when you do it, you will be changed.
[02:43:31.935 --> 02:43:33.617]  And you're going to be changed spiritually.
[02:43:33.697 --> 02:43:34.718]  Something's going to happen.
[02:43:35.139 --> 02:43:45.630]  It would not surprise me, Alex, and you know I've thought about even writing a novel about this, if it wasn't that you literally upload your soul into something for permanent safekeeping.
[02:43:45.650 --> 02:43:47.192]  It'll be quote-unquote immortal.
[02:43:47.532 --> 02:43:49.212]  And by the way, this is all quackery.
[02:43:49.272 --> 02:43:56.954]  It's like for decades, they ended up imprisoning tens of thousands of innocent people with their stupid lie detector test.
[02:43:57.415 --> 02:44:00.996]  And then now they have high-tech brain scanners that they claim.
[02:44:01.216 --> 02:44:04.356]  Then they show the jury, look, the blinking lights say you're guilty.
[02:44:04.376 --> 02:44:07.017]  It's like, Mr. Rockefeller, you've paid us $10 billion.
[02:44:07.377 --> 02:44:08.357]  Now you're not going to die.
[02:44:08.397 --> 02:44:09.498]  We're uploading your soul.
[02:44:09.558 --> 02:44:10.118]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:10.778 --> 02:44:13.302]  And it'll be a computer program that can talk to you.
[02:44:13.682 --> 02:44:14.944]  It may even be sentient.
[02:44:15.284 --> 02:44:19.189]  And they've already got computers here that can make decisions, do puzzles very well, and be humans.
[02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:21.332]  And so it'll be, you won't be able to converse.
[02:44:21.753 --> 02:44:22.654]  It'll sound like David Rocker.
[02:44:22.674 --> 02:44:25.137]  Probably be like, good, now I can die.
[02:44:25.177 --> 02:44:25.918]  I live forever.
[02:44:26.379 --> 02:44:27.881]  And it's just a total con.
[02:44:27.921 --> 02:44:28.441]  Don't forget!
[02:44:29.428 --> 02:44:30.990]  There's a lot of quackery involved here.
[02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.431]  Go ahead.
[02:44:31.731 --> 02:44:39.382]  Yeah, and I think there's such enormous spiritual pieces to this, and anybody who doesn't feel the spiritual battle is, you know, they need to get on their knees and pray.
[02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:42.647]  Satan wants to be God, and he's using this creation to try to build it.
[02:44:43.109 --> 02:44:44.090]  Well, you got it.
[02:44:44.331 --> 02:44:47.674]  And the thing about Satan is, you know, obviously he's never going to be God.
[02:44:47.835 --> 02:44:49.456]  He's going to shake his tiny fist at God.
[02:44:49.657 --> 02:44:56.425]  His efforts to replicate God's powers are so pathetic, and they always fall short, and they always fail, and they always have a downside.
[02:44:56.945 --> 02:44:59.949]  And this idea, you know, only God can give us immortality.
[02:45:00.089 --> 02:45:01.731]  Only God can give us eternal life.
[02:45:02.051 --> 02:45:16.108]  But Satan's gonna say, and I really believe this is gonna happen, at some point, listen, you know, you're gonna die at age 80 or 90, maybe we can get you up to 100, but eventually you're gonna die, but if you upload into this matrix, you will live forever.
[02:45:16.648 --> 02:45:18.531]  And when people make that bargain,
[02:45:19.111 --> 02:45:27.019]  When they worship that, and make that bargain, and upload themselves into that, that's going to be the moment when they lose their souls.
[02:45:27.159 --> 02:45:29.261]  And their soul will not be redeemable at that point.
[02:45:29.301 --> 02:45:30.182]  It will belong to Satan.
[02:45:30.202 --> 02:45:31.263]  The Bible is very clear on that.
[02:45:31.583 --> 02:45:35.627]  Now, you may think, and I'm sure there's listeners out there going, wow, Catherine's really gone off the deep end.
[02:45:35.968 --> 02:45:39.051]  But let me tell you, this is not me speaking.
[02:45:39.691 --> 02:45:45.114]  This is the people on the other side clearly spelling this out.
[02:45:45.634 --> 02:45:49.116]  They say it as clear as I'm saying it.
[02:45:49.136 --> 02:45:55.140]  Kurzweil says that people who won't take this will just be put in ghettos and then basically won't be needed.
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:56.861]  They're all writing about that.
[02:45:57.862 --> 02:46:00.766]  And they're writing about the spiritual piece of it too, Alex.
[02:46:00.826 --> 02:46:02.949]  They're writing about the worship component.
[02:46:03.009 --> 02:46:04.191]  They're writing about a new religion.
[02:46:04.271 --> 02:46:10.881]  Well, Kurzweil quote says in the tagline for his movie, I know you've seen and talked about, a transcendent man.
[02:46:10.921 --> 02:46:12.563]  He says, I don't believe in God yet.
[02:46:12.803 --> 02:46:13.725]  I'm going to be God.
[02:46:14.366 --> 02:46:14.586]  Right.
[02:46:14.727 --> 02:46:16.289]  Yeah, and that's the ultimate sin.
[02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:17.370]  And you know, that's the problem.
[02:46:17.410 --> 02:46:19.433]  What did Satan promise Adam and Eve in the garden?
[02:46:19.453 --> 02:46:20.515]  You will be as gods.
[02:46:20.655 --> 02:46:21.356]  You got it.
[02:46:21.556 --> 02:46:29.968]  And so, Kurzweil is just like the snake with the apple, you know, however many years later, he's like the snake with the apple, making you the same.
[02:46:30.168 --> 02:46:36.710]  Yeah, no, they're gonna download into your brain a wirehead, uh, you know, total ecstasy program.
[02:46:36.730 --> 02:46:42.031]  You'll go, I'm God, uh, and then go, I must transcend and meet the Hillbop Comet.
[02:46:42.351 --> 02:46:43.652]  I'm killing my physical body.
[02:46:43.692 --> 02:46:46.252]  That's what they write about in their weird nihilistic writings.
[02:46:46.272 --> 02:46:49.853]  They do, and it's religious.
[02:46:49.873 --> 02:46:55.795]  They're no different than people putting on the white Nikes and the black outfits and taking barbiturates and drinking vodka.
[02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:59.871]  Yeah, and it is absolutely a cult.
[02:47:00.331 --> 02:47:02.371]  No, they're a bunch of complete lunatics!
[02:47:02.651 --> 02:47:03.031]  Totally.
[02:47:03.151 --> 02:47:07.792]  That's why... I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead.
[02:47:08.132 --> 02:47:12.393]  You know, people often will say to me, you know, Catherine, I love everything you do except that Christian stuff.
[02:47:12.553 --> 02:47:19.315]  And I say, you know, dude, take a look at who we're fighting, because those people will absolutely talk religion to you.
[02:47:19.875 --> 02:47:20.936]  They will absolutely.
[02:47:20.976 --> 02:47:21.676]  You read their writing.
[02:47:21.696 --> 02:47:30.343]  They're the ones that always push the atheist thing just so you're not looking at religion, but that everything they do is obsessed with the occult and how they're going to be God.
[02:47:30.563 --> 02:47:37.628]  And they don't want you looking at religion because they don't want you, quote, getting their Lucifer power, which they think are guarding, and then they hate Christians.
[02:47:38.069 --> 02:47:39.590]  And so they're like, oh there's nothing going on.
[02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:40.671]  There's no spirits.
[02:47:40.991 --> 02:47:42.852]  Oh great goblin give me power.
[02:47:43.233 --> 02:47:44.934]  I mean, you know, they're just obsessed with it.
[02:47:45.325 --> 02:47:47.926]  Yeah, it's interesting stuff.
[02:47:47.946 --> 02:47:53.930]  So the people I would recommend, people look at Peter Cochran, C-O-C-H-R-A-N-E.
[02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:56.091]  His website's really dark, it's all futuristic.
[02:47:56.111 --> 02:47:57.531]  He's got a bunch of stuff out there on that.
[02:47:57.652 --> 02:48:02.754]  Obviously, Ray Kurzweil is the guy who's probably achieved the most best-seller status.
[02:48:02.774 --> 02:48:09.538]  They say they will destroy the Earth to keep on willing, and they just talk like total power-tripping lunatics.
[02:48:09.958 --> 02:48:21.528]  Yeah, I know, and you know, it plays right into their hands that the earth is becoming polluted, people are getting sick, our bodies are breaking down, because the more pollutants you put out there, the more people who get cancer.
[02:48:21.608 --> 02:48:30.716]  I mean, believe me, Alex, there have been times over the last six months I've thought, you know, I'd love to dump this body, it's betrayed me, it's not working so good right now, and you know, it's tough to go through cancer.
[02:48:30.836 --> 02:48:32.156]  Catherine, that's the lie.
[02:48:32.336 --> 02:48:38.498]  They've added the poisons in on record to make normal life, normal birth impossible.
[02:48:38.578 --> 02:48:44.180]  Total sterilization, where you've got to go to them and have the man and woman's cells spliced.
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:52.023]  And then you think you're getting your baby with your genetics, but they can add their Trojan horse piggybacks in, just like they've done with GMO.
[02:48:52.363 --> 02:48:59.685]  That's why they're destroying all the crops and all the human and animal genetics, while building giant underground animal and plant
[02:49:00.185 --> 02:49:01.807]  We're good to go.
[02:49:18.542 --> 02:49:25.127]  And you understand that there are chess pieces that are black and they're being moved on the board, and there's chess pieces that are white being moved on the board.
[02:49:25.487 --> 02:49:27.268]  There is a battle raging.
[02:49:27.288 --> 02:49:28.509]  I'm sure it's raging in the heavens, too.
[02:49:28.529 --> 02:49:30.951]  Look, the New Agers, I mean, they can't get it.
[02:49:31.011 --> 02:49:32.191]  It's the spirit of the year.
[02:49:32.252 --> 02:49:32.972]  You can't see it.
[02:49:33.292 --> 02:49:35.174]  You can call it a space invader if you want.
[02:49:35.554 --> 02:49:37.435]  But, I mean, there is the mystery of evil.
[02:49:37.475 --> 02:49:38.816]  There is a coordinating force.
[02:49:41.898 --> 02:49:43.519]  Uh, outside of humans.
[02:49:43.539 --> 02:49:46.541]  You can call it spiritual, or you can call it whatever it is.
[02:49:46.621 --> 02:49:48.502]  And the elitists believe that.
[02:49:49.102 --> 02:49:50.683]  They believe they're being directed.
[02:49:51.704 --> 02:49:53.385]  Yes, do they ever, absolutely.
[02:49:53.825 --> 02:49:59.128]  So, and let me just, from a practical perspective, because I hate leaving people just going, yeah, this is so creepy.
[02:49:59.588 --> 02:50:01.730]  You know, there are practical things you can do.
[02:50:01.810 --> 02:50:04.011]  There are companies that you need to be paying more attention to.
[02:50:04.111 --> 02:50:09.975]  Facebook, I'm so glad, has come to the public's awareness with all of the privacy issues.
[02:50:10.015 --> 02:50:12.637]  I'm so glad Zuckerberg's sister came out and just said it like it is.
[02:50:12.998 --> 02:50:14.699]  We want to eliminate anonymity.
[02:50:14.719 --> 02:50:18.722]  Smith came out and said, hey, we're watching you, big deal.
[02:50:18.922 --> 02:50:20.463]  You shouldn't do it if you don't want to be watched.
[02:50:20.742 --> 02:50:21.142]  That's right.
[02:50:21.162 --> 02:50:25.906]  And then, of course, he's the guy who wants his own stuff hidden, so don't even get me going on that guy.
[02:50:26.207 --> 02:50:28.228]  But, you know, Google's saying they want to be the mind of God.
[02:50:28.248 --> 02:50:30.270]  They got a picture of your house from a satellite.
[02:50:30.290 --> 02:50:31.591]  They're doing the drive-by thing.
[02:50:31.631 --> 02:50:33.173]  They're reading all of your email.
[02:50:33.213 --> 02:50:34.193]  And I always point this out.
[02:50:34.213 --> 02:50:35.695]  If you have a Gmail account,
[02:50:36.315 --> 02:50:38.476]  Every email you write and send is being scanned.
[02:50:38.537 --> 02:50:40.358]  Keywords are going into your profile.
[02:50:40.598 --> 02:50:41.919]  They're watching everything.
[02:50:41.939 --> 02:50:49.043]  Yeah, folks, you think you're looking at a crystal ball and getting data with Google, but Soron's looking back the other side.
[02:50:49.423 --> 02:50:54.406]  They are watching everything, and you're telling them what's really in your mind, where you're going, what you're doing.
[02:50:54.786 --> 02:50:56.087]  And it was in QTel money.
[02:50:56.147 --> 02:50:57.288]  CIA money founded it.
[02:50:57.648 --> 02:50:58.829]  Pig Schmidt, all of them.
[02:50:59.369 --> 02:51:00.929]  They're just total front-level minions.

[02:53:46.405 --> 02:53:46.585]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:53:46.605 --> 02:53:47.306]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[02:54:06.373 --> 02:54:12.015]  Okay, my main broadcast is over in five minutes, but I will do prisonplanet.tv only.
[02:54:12.775 --> 02:54:18.937]  Info or streams, only five-minute special comment, because I have to, about what Media Matters is doing to us.
[02:54:19.577 --> 02:54:24.198]  You know they're getting ready to rebrand, quote, anybody who isn't a total communist, globalist.
[02:54:25.018 --> 02:54:39.049]  As a terrorist, and I'm always calling for non-violence, and when Richard Poplosky, two hours after he shot and killed three cops, they downloaded the full contents of his computer, and had Southern Poverty Law Center connected reporters say he did it for me.
[02:54:39.649 --> 02:54:45.294]  Turned out he hated me all over my website, attacked me on all the Nazi sites, and said I work for Israel.
[02:54:47.542 --> 02:54:49.724]  Uh, and, uh, didn't like me.
[02:54:49.904 --> 02:54:54.808]  And it turned out there were thousands of websites on his computer, but they chose to say I made him do it.
[02:54:55.288 --> 02:55:02.594]  And I'm getting to the point of litigation if people continue to take things out of context and imply that I'm calling for violence.
[02:55:03.134 --> 02:55:03.995]  And they've done it again.
[02:55:04.015 --> 02:55:11.281]  And I have a part about how they're trying to cause a civil war in America between the police and the public and the military.
[02:55:11.981 --> 02:55:13.983]  And I've got to find it later, but I know that I
[02:55:15.888 --> 02:55:18.330]  I'm just going to go back to Catherine Albert and I'll just finish it in the overdrive.
[02:55:18.931 --> 02:55:22.794]  But I know in the YouTube video, I then go on to say they want this clash, but we can't let it happen.
[02:55:23.134 --> 02:55:24.616]  Reach out to police and military.
[02:55:25.276 --> 02:55:33.323]  But see, they just take it all out of context where if a cop was reading this, and they just want to get a bunch of corrupt cops souped up to come set me up and kill me, whatever.
[02:55:33.783 --> 02:55:37.607]  You think I'm worried about death going up against Soros and all you people?
[02:55:38.573 --> 02:55:44.058]  I mean, you really think, you know, the point is, we know what your bosses are getting ready to do in America to blame on us.
[02:55:44.158 --> 02:55:44.799]  I understand that.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:46.200]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:48.462]  You've got to be defeated or there's no future.
[02:55:48.983 --> 02:55:53.627]  Now, they got a bunch of young, snot-nosed kids working there, don't even know what they're doing, compartmentalized idiots.
[02:55:55.930 --> 02:56:00.194]  And, well, but they did admit they wanted to infiltrate media organizations and destroy them from within.
[02:56:00.214 --> 02:56:02.936]  So we do have to run background checks on folks we hire.
[02:56:05.149 --> 02:56:06.711]  It is, it is just a real shame.
[02:56:06.731 --> 02:56:13.679]  And they also took out of context the helicopter plan, the Sunshine Project in Texas discovered to have knockout gases released on the public.
[02:56:14.139 --> 02:56:17.082]  And then all the statements about the elites about releasing viruses on us.
[02:56:17.863 --> 02:56:20.226]  And then they just make it sound like I'm crazy talking about that.
[02:56:20.266 --> 02:56:24.831]  So we'll just do another report on that for everybody to learn exactly what you're up to.
[02:56:25.131 --> 02:56:26.253]  Going back to Kathryn Albrecht.
[02:56:26.273 --> 02:56:28.356]  Kathryn, I want to have you back up in the near future soon.
[02:56:28.956 --> 02:56:41.694]  Tell us about, you were talking about Google, but you are the spokesperson for Startpage that we've promoted here, Startpage.com, that actually lets you even get Google results without them spying on you.
[02:56:42.045 --> 02:56:43.245]  Yeah, that's the cool thing.
[02:56:44.006 --> 02:56:55.389]  We've talked about Startpage for years, you and I. It's a search engine for people who don't know that allows you to do searches without Google recording everything you search for.
[02:56:55.869 --> 02:57:03.671]  Never before have I seen the value of it, Alex, so much as having breast cancer because I'm typing in a lot of personal medical information into search engines.
[02:57:04.171 --> 02:57:05.534]  I want to know, what is this drug?
[02:57:05.554 --> 02:57:06.195]  What does that do?
[02:57:06.215 --> 02:57:07.036]  What is this treatment?
[02:57:07.557 --> 02:57:12.846]  And if I were doing that into Google, Google would know every aspect of my health treatment.
[02:57:12.906 --> 02:57:15.611]  And then they have ads pop up and they admit they're doing it.
[02:57:16.284 --> 02:57:26.328]  Yeah, if I were typing in a doctor, you know, you get a new doctor, you type in the name, you get a prescription, you want to see what the side effects are, they record all that and so they know everything about you, who you're seeing, where you're going, it's crazy.
[02:57:26.808 --> 02:57:29.249]  So, Startpage has been around for a couple years.
[02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:34.251]  A lot of your listeners are huge fans of Startpage and I want to thank you all for supporting Startpage because they're a great company.
[02:57:35.331 --> 02:57:40.913]  The amazing thing is that now, Startpage is actually returning Google results.
[02:57:41.453 --> 02:57:45.874]  And a lot of people, they go to Startpage now, they see Enhanced by Google, they're like, ooh, were you bought out by Google?
[02:57:46.015 --> 02:57:48.415]  I'm a VP with the company, I can say totally not.
[02:57:48.875 --> 02:58:03.460]  But what we are doing now is when you type in a query, you know, breast cancer for example, Startpage servers, which are either in the Netherlands or in California, will go onto Google's website, they will put in the search for breast cancer, they'll get the results from Google,
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:05.121]  Folks never get it.
[02:58:05.161 --> 02:58:06.002]  It's a proxy.
[02:58:06.522 --> 02:58:07.103]  It's a proxy.
[02:58:07.123 --> 02:58:09.985]  They put it behind a firewall, then they serve you the results.
[02:58:10.105 --> 02:58:11.126]  Google doesn't see you.
[02:58:11.186 --> 02:58:13.087]  Google just sees some computer in the Netherlands.
[02:58:13.308 --> 02:58:14.288]  What about Startpage?
[02:58:14.348 --> 02:58:15.589]  It's not logging IPs?
[02:58:16.110 --> 02:58:16.931]  Totally not.
[02:58:17.051 --> 02:58:17.811]  Totally private.
[02:58:18.051 --> 02:58:24.797]  And this ISP thing, if you use the proxy on Startpage, your ISP will not know where you even go.
[02:58:24.997 --> 02:58:27.559]  And that's the cool part of this horrible law passes.
[02:58:27.919 --> 02:58:29.340]  So, startpage.com.
[02:58:29.761 --> 02:58:30.441]  I vouch for them.
[02:58:30.481 --> 02:58:31.162]  I know you do too.
[02:58:31.202 --> 02:58:31.923]  It's a great company.
[02:58:32.763 --> 02:58:37.825]  People have got to vote with their feet and stop the NSA, known as Google, and Pig Schmidt and the rest of them.
[02:58:37.845 --> 02:58:38.505]  Thank you, Catherine.
[02:58:38.725 --> 02:58:39.805]  See you back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[02:58:40.065 --> 02:58:41.486]  I'll come back and Internet only.
[02:58:43.406 --> 02:58:45.247]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.807 --> 02:58:49.028]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.225 --> 02:58:55.869]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.249 --> 02:58:59.252]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.493 --> 02:59:04.278]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.298 --> 02:59:10.504]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.684 --> 02:59:12.927]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.467 --> 02:59:13.907]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.927 --> 02:59:14.187]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.287 --> 02:59:14.887]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.947 --> 02:59:16.208]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.228 --> 02:59:18.468]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.372 --> 02:59:34.213]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.473 --> 02:59:39.275]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.635 --> 02:59:49.560]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:51.841 --> 02:59:54.802]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.422 --> 02:59:58.643]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:10.851 --> 03:00:30.739]  Okay, so you got the George Soros-run, funded Media Matters, which is tiny compared to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, but that masquerades as this, quote, nonpartisan group, when their own memos have come out in Politico saying, we're going to infiltrate, we're going to destroy organizations from within.
[03:00:30.759 --> 03:00:33.420]  It's our job to destroy the alternative media.
[03:00:34.862 --> 03:00:38.285]  Fox News and other conservative groups, and they really hate my guts.
[03:00:39.646 --> 03:00:48.093]  And when Richard Poplowski up in Pittsburgh a few years ago was a former Marine, he got a second pit bull.
[03:00:48.113 --> 03:00:49.574]  They were urinating all over the carpet.
[03:00:49.614 --> 03:00:53.297]  His mother told him, get rid of that dog or you're kicked out of the house.
[03:00:53.937 --> 03:00:56.419]  He was drunk in the early morning hours.
[03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:00.022]  That's all confirmed, and threw a fit when she kicked him out.
[03:01:00.222 --> 03:01:03.405]  It was a domestic dispute, the most dangerous thing cops go to.
[03:01:04.451 --> 03:01:06.432]  And the cops came and he killed three of them, and it's terrible.
[03:01:06.652 --> 03:01:07.973]  And we've always said we're against that.
[03:01:09.854 --> 03:01:17.118]  Within two hours of him being arrested, they came out in the news and said, and had weird people popping up in the news, it was clearly scripted, saying, oh, he did this for Alex Jones.
[03:01:18.378 --> 03:01:24.082]  And then we learned, thank God we got his handle online, and the handle they were talking about, and he was attacking me everywhere.
[03:01:24.902 --> 03:01:26.103]  And he was a white supremacist.
[03:01:28.044 --> 03:01:29.504]  I guess one of the few that isn't a fed.
[03:01:30.625 --> 03:01:31.946]  And they knew that.
[03:01:32.850 --> 03:01:37.612]  And I forced retractions in five newspapers over the Poplosky.
[03:01:38.892 --> 03:01:42.574]  I had to call them up and I said, listen, here's all the proof of this.
[03:01:43.274 --> 03:01:45.915]  You know, how'd you get that info out of that computers?
[03:01:46.716 --> 03:01:47.696]  Who handed that to you?
[03:01:47.896 --> 03:01:48.576]  What agency?
[03:01:48.837 --> 03:01:50.637]  They all got scared because they knew.
[03:01:50.917 --> 03:02:01.782]  So the first thing on the cop's mind and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others who were hooked in with the local reporters that write for him, basically, was get Alex Jones.
[03:02:03.513 --> 03:02:08.916]  I mean, I would imagine that if a boulder came down a mountain and killed a cop while they're in Colorado, they'd blame me.
[03:02:09.897 --> 03:02:12.379]  Because this is how they manipulate cops.
[03:02:12.399 --> 03:02:20.504]  We've had pro-land rights rallies, and I've heard police radios going, they're Republic of Texas, they're gonna try to shoot you, you know, so the cops get all scared.
[03:02:20.584 --> 03:02:22.645]  Ooh, guys on the radio told me you're bad.
[03:02:22.665 --> 03:02:24.526]  I mean, it's all about manipulating people.
[03:02:25.907 --> 03:02:28.208]  And the government doesn't just lie to us, they lie to their own minions.
[03:02:30.703 --> 03:02:36.226]  It's really disgusting because they talk about, the headline is, Alex Jones warns of orgy of mass murder.
[03:02:37.146 --> 03:02:38.287]  And you think, wow, he does?
[03:02:38.907 --> 03:02:46.931]  And then it goes into quotes about Plosky and Jewish cabals running everything.
[03:02:46.951 --> 03:02:49.672]  And then it says he got all this from Alex Jones.
[03:02:49.692 --> 03:02:51.193]  That's not true, and everybody knows that.
[03:02:52.873 --> 03:02:57.756]  And this is their script, Southern Poverty Law Center ADL type script.
[03:02:58.763 --> 03:03:01.245]  And then it goes on, alas, he's up to his old tricks.
[03:03:01.945 --> 03:03:06.869]  And they're very upset about my video that's on the Alex Jones channel of YouTube right now.
[03:03:07.829 --> 03:03:14.814]  And I'm sad to say it only has, you know, 142,000 views.
[03:03:14.874 --> 03:03:15.875]  It should have 10 million.
[03:03:16.275 --> 03:03:17.616]  Obama launches gun grab.
[03:03:17.636 --> 03:03:23.701]  And it starts with a newscast with them confiscating the guns in New Orleans and saying all the guns will be taken, no one will be allowed to arm.
[03:03:24.041 --> 03:03:26.503]  And they go on to say I'm completely insane and this isn't real.
[03:03:27.854 --> 03:03:40.183]  They say it's total delusion, and that because I've made a video against gun grabbing, and against the ATF doing things outside law, really, here's the NRA, NRA to sue Feds over ATF intimidation of gun sellers.
[03:03:41.744 --> 03:03:44.886]  Really, this is all crazy delusion that they're doing this outside law?
[03:03:44.906 --> 03:03:46.428]  When I have the ATF letters?
[03:03:47.554 --> 03:03:49.714]  And the ATF's been caught shipping guns into Mexico?
[03:03:50.555 --> 03:04:00.637]  See, they're really upset that I'm up here reading the El Paso Times, and we told you this back in April, about also the government not just shipping guns down, they're shipping drugs back.
[03:04:01.437 --> 03:04:02.117]  And they've been caught!
[03:04:03.057 --> 03:04:13.920]  And so they have these watchdog groups, you know, for the good banker George Soros, that go after evil talk show hosts who are non-partisan and just cover the truth and risk my life and my name.
[03:04:14.585 --> 03:04:20.953]  Then they take out of context a clip where I'm talking about the fact that the Sunshine Project got this in 2001.
[03:04:21.814 --> 03:04:22.755]  We've dug it out before.
[03:04:22.815 --> 03:04:24.977]  It's off their site, but it's in some of the digital archives.
[03:04:24.997 --> 03:04:25.718]  They haven't pulled it down.
[03:04:25.778 --> 03:04:27.280]  I printed it and saved it and can't find it.
[03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:28.541]  We're going to go look after the show.
[03:04:29.738 --> 03:04:31.800]  If I have to, I'll just get the former head of the Sunshine Project on.
[03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:33.641]  They shut it down because of threats and lack of funding.
[03:04:34.302 --> 03:04:39.987]  And I know the article you can find is where the Marine Corps threatened Sunshine Project to remove declassified document.
[03:04:40.267 --> 03:04:42.429]  And the Marines said this shouldn't have been declassified.
[03:04:43.050 --> 03:04:48.675]  And it's the Marines and the plans for helicopters in regional grids with knockout gas.
[03:04:49.415 --> 03:04:52.198]  And then you got the Globalists talking about doing it with bioweapons.
[03:04:52.238 --> 03:04:53.659]  So that's what I'm talking about.
[03:04:53.939 --> 03:04:55.320]  The gun confiscation's real.
[03:04:56.301 --> 03:05:00.025]  The plan to nerve gas the public's real, just like injecting little kids with syphilis is real.
[03:05:00.186 --> 03:05:00.786]  So shut up!
[03:05:01.928 --> 03:05:02.768]  Ready to save?
[03:05:02.909 --> 03:05:06.032]  Then you're ready for the Super Summer Sale at Herbal Healer Academy!
