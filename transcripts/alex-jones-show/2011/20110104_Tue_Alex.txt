[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.749]  Radio Network.
[00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.372]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:30.486]  Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you may be listening.
[00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:32.468]  Alex Jones here live.
[00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:39.334]  We're going to be here for the next three hours on this now third live broadcast of 2011.
[00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:39.895]  It is January 4th.
[00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.678]  2011 and again we're going to be live here for the next 30 minutes.
[00:00:47.078 --> 00:01:00.561]  We've got Wayne Madsen coming up in about an hour and a half popping in, formerly with the NSA, writes on national security matters for some of the most prestigious publications in the country and just amazing predictions and a piercing analysis.
[00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:06.583]  He's saying that there's clear evidence of these rash of intensifying bombings
[00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:19.190]  Across Europe being brought in as a political smokescreen for the austerity measures that the large central banks are putting in place to further loot the population.
[00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:33.198]  There's clear evidence that it's connected to Operation Gladio that's been partially declassified and former Italian presidents, German former defense ministers and others have gone public detailing them the 60s, 70s and 80s elements of
[00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:42.687]  NATO and the US military staged literally hundreds of bombings all across Europe to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:47.131]  If a right-wing group was getting too popular that the establishment didn't like, they'd stage a bombing.
[00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.655]  If a left-wing group was getting too popular and was seen as anti-establishment,
[00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:53.196]  They would stage a bombing and blame it on them.
[00:01:53.276 --> 00:02:01.658]  One of the more famous 1980 Bologna bombing that killed a whole bunch of people including men, women, and children at that train station.
[00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:05.900]  So Madsen will be popping in for about 20 minutes at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.881]  We were going to have him on Friday but we had phone system problems on New Year's.
[00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.682]  I guess with the phone systems jammed over in Paris.
[00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:21.024]  But Max Keiser will be joining us to talk about the economy and his outlook going into 2011 and beyond.
[00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:27.525]  Always interesting and informative, Max Keiser will be joining us coming up in the last hour today.
[00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:35.327]  Now that said, I've got to control myself and not run down a rabbit trail, and we'll see if I can do it when we come back from break.
[00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:55.636]  uh... because we've got a lot of and very important geopolitical military news with afghanistan iraq you name it uh... big developments with the bird die-off uh... that story has now gone massive uh... and we're right at the forefront of the daily mail the huffington post
[00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:57.216]  We're good to go.
[00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:26.948]  Uh, now a similar species or the same species of, uh, cedar waxwing, uh, blackbird falling, uh, dead, uh, in Louisiana in mass.
[00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:36.194]  Just 500 counted off of one road alone and other reports coming out of, uh, around Louisiana and other parts, uh, of, uh, the South and the Midwest.
[00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:46.185]  They've had the veterinary head of the Fish and Wildlife group there in Arkansas that did autopsies on the birds saying that there was not disease that did this.
[00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:53.607]  So, now maybe we got blackbirds that are dead in another state, and maybe it was disease on that front.
[00:03:53.988 --> 00:04:00.370]  Because that's pretty common for birds to get sick and thousands can die, but they don't all just drop out of the sky and dead before they hit the ground.
[00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.911]  One dies here, one dies there.
[00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.994]  If you fall over here, if you fall over there, they die slowly.
[00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:13.399]  We've all seen dead birds, dead blackbirds especially, because they overpopulate and tend to cull themselves through starvation and disease.
[00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:19.943]  They're a very prodigious species, but clearly something else is going on here.
[00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:28.649]  Their organs were liquefied, and it wasn't done by a bacteria or a virus or other type of microbial infection.
[00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.914]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:38.183]  Also, big news on the political front with the corruption of the Obama crime machine.
[00:04:38.743 --> 00:04:43.070]  I want to hit that first when we come back from this quick break with big developments.
[00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.570]  Stay with us.
[00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.220]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:46.984]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:47.384 --> 00:06:52.345]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.446]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:59.567]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:00.728]  How much do you want?
[00:07:00.948 --> 00:07:01.688]  When do you want it?
[00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:03.669]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:04.769]  When will you need it?
[00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.090]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.210]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.892]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:15.158]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:18.541]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:22.446]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:23.507]  How much will you need?
[00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:24.608]  We don't know.
[00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:25.788]  How much do you want?
[00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:26.729]  All you can get.
[00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:27.770]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.772]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:33.693]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:34.674]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:51.898]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:55.501]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:13.882]  This intriguing mystery of the 5,000 dead blackbirds in Arkansas, in BB, Arkansas, now in mass die-offs of the same species of blackbird in Louisiana and other areas of the United States.
[00:08:14.622 --> 00:08:20.766]  The fact that the Fish and Wildlife Department veterinarians that have looked at it have told CNN that it was trauma
[00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:34.918]  That it was not disease, well then if you have other birds that start dying and that's trauma, something's going on here and colliding with each other in the night is not going to liquefy the innards of 5,000 birds.
[00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:39.161]  And we've got a lot of other bizarre things happening like this big fish die off.
[00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:44.446]  There may be naturally occurring reasons for this, but I haven't figured out what they are yet.
[00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:52.411]  And I know that when the government tests chemical, biologicals, radiologicals, birds are some of the most susceptible to it.
[00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:55.193]  Hence the famous canary in the coal mine.
[00:08:55.773 --> 00:09:11.424]  There's many other examples reported on by the press that when somebody first cooks on a no-stick pan, that the chemicals that are in it off-gas, and that if you have a bird in a cage in the room like a canary, it will, or a parakeet, it will fall over dead.
[00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:14.306]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.787]  Also, Lindsey Graham calls for permanent U.S.
[00:09:17.827 --> 00:09:20.607]  military presence in Afghanistan yesterday.
[00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:22.667]  Well, that's the way it's always been.
[00:09:23.808 --> 00:09:32.369]  That's the way, you know, the real battle plan was and is and will always be to permanently stay there.
[00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:34.070]  Does the empire leave Germany?
[00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.650]  Does the empire leave Japan?
[00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.110]  Does the empire leave South Korea?
[00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.311]  Does the empire leave Guantanamo Bay?
[00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:40.591]  It's not our empire.
[00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:41.691]  We just pay for it.
[00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:45.662]  And we are an empire clearly in decline.
[00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:50.044]  And whereas I'd like to see the empire fall, I'd like to save the republic.
[00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:52.545]  You know, the empire killed the republic.
[00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:58.367]  The question is, when the empire falls, will it implode in on us and feed on us even more domestically?
[00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:03.309]  Or could we pull a rabbit out of a hat and get our republic back?
[00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:06.911]  You know, that's the big $64 million question.
[00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:11.213]  And that's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:10:12.293 --> 00:10:14.975]  I'm now going to rip off David Letterman from last night.
[00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:16.637]  I didn't see it, but Jaron told me about it.
[00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:20.200]  I guess it's not stealing the joke because I'm just repeating it here.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.966]  But he said that the new governor, Mr. Brown, has been sworn in in a particularly hokey way.
[00:10:27.806 --> 00:10:34.071]  Uh, and, uh, that don't worry about Governor Schwarzenegger, he's being relocated to a primate, uh, facility in Florida.
[00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:35.732]  So he's gonna be quite happy.
[00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:42.517]  Uh, but Schwarzenegger says he will be back, and he wants the 22nd Amendment removed so he can be our president.
[00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:55.511]  I think if you tell Rolling Stone and a film crew and several other newspapers that you admire Hitler and want to be a dictator, that precludes you from public office.
[00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:56.592]  Clear abuse of power.
[00:10:58.654 --> 00:11:03.980]  In the 90s, tell MSNBC that you admire Kurt Voltheim, the SS officer.
[00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:07.123]  I think that precludes you.
[00:11:07.183 --> 00:11:20.713]  So thank heavens for the vision of the founders and the Constitution that we can't have a foreign-born individual as our El Presidente.
[00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:22.674]  I don't know of any other countries that allow that as well.
[00:11:22.694 --> 00:11:24.235]  It's just common sense.
[00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:27.257]  But really that had its genesis
[00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:49.274]  in the 1770s and 1780s because of practices in Europe where royalty would try to, as young boys, ship their sons into neighboring countries that were becoming democratic with parliaments and having them elected with their money, power, and backing to then take over the nation through that system.
[00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:57.137]  And so we don't need Arnold Alos Schwarzenegger, the anti-gun, pro-open border,
[00:11:57.837 --> 00:12:02.118]  carbon-taxing New World Order person to run for office anymore.
[00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:07.240]  We need to have Arnold go back to his homeland.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.581]  Austria is a beautiful, wonderful country, great people.
[00:12:10.261 --> 00:12:21.965]  But if I was Austrian, I'd be irritated by, say, somebody from Texas over there talking about how I wanted to be a dictator and telling folks to turn their guns into me and that I wanted carbon taxes.
[00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.565]  He is leaving with a 22% approval rating.
[00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:26.547]  I hope so.
[00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:42.395]  The ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:44.237]  Is that site even active anymore?
[00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:45.918]  I always try to keep it up, but we never look at it.
[00:12:45.938 --> 00:12:50.762]  Let's go to ArnoldExposed.com, put it on screen for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:50.782 --> 00:12:56.767]  We've got a compendium there of the quotes and the statements about how he hates helpless Americans.
[00:12:58.007 --> 00:13:05.593]  And I countered him in USA Today and other big publications, picked up my quotes about him being a Nazi who likes to preen.
[00:13:06.594 --> 00:13:16.742]  And poses a strutting steroid head peacock and that we don't we don't like his kind around here so he can Auslander Reich or how do they say it in Deutsch?
[00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:17.863]  Foreigners out.
[00:13:18.404 --> 00:13:21.906]  We can start with Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.
[00:13:22.787 --> 00:13:24.448]  So Auslander Reich.
[00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:26.270]  Is that how you say it?
[00:13:26.937 --> 00:13:29.739]  That means get out of our country, get out of here.
[00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:36.383]  I wouldn't mind it so much if he was Austrian and talked about how he loved the Republic and loved the Second Amendment.
[00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:44.089]  Didn't talk about how he wants to be a dictator and what didn't pass carbon taxes on the back of Californians.
[00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:48.053]  But I'd still say, oh, you know, prudence wins out.
[00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.875]  Even if he was a Ron Paul type, he shouldn't be able to run for president.
[00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:55.078]  Just like I shouldn't be able to run for president in Austria.
[00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.239]  And I got news for you.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:56.780]  I can't.
[00:13:57.821 --> 00:13:58.742]  You know, you got to love it.
[00:13:59.142 --> 00:14:05.547]  Mexico has the most draconian immigration laws in the Americas, from Alaska down to Chile.
[00:14:06.704 --> 00:14:09.246]  From Brazil up to Venezuela, to Canada.
[00:14:09.827 --> 00:14:13.230]  They have the most draconian, even the Washington Post admits that, the State Department admits it.
[00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:20.797]  They put people in slave labor camps from Guatemala or other Central South American countries that they're caught coming into Southern North America, into Mexico.
[00:14:21.638 --> 00:14:24.281]  And the police will beat up and kill anybody they want.
[00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:41.170]  But then, if we don't give free welfare and goodies to the illegal aliens pouring across from Mexico, waving Mexican flags, who are so upset by American flags in Texas, Arizona, and California, that school children, including Hispanic school children, can't wear American flags, that's my problem!
[00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:44.853]  See, it's kind of like Schwarzenegger saying he wants to be a dictator.
[00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:45.854]  I don't like him.
[00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:51.299]  And it's like a large portion of these illegal aliens from Mexico chanting down with the U.S.
[00:14:51.919 --> 00:15:00.706]  at soccer games that's been covered on television and running around with Mexican flags and tearing down American flags at post offices and running up Mexican flags.
[00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:01.867]  I can't handle it.
[00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:03.108]  Okay?
[00:15:05.065 --> 00:15:15.548]  I mean, if Mexico wanted to become the 51st state, and the people had a history of liberty and freedom down there, and were into the Second Amendment and into private property, I'd say 51st state!
[00:15:16.068 --> 00:15:18.749]  I'm not scared of folks down there because they got a nice tan.
[00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:20.229]  I kind of wish I had one.
[00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:21.749]  You know, I like a tan.
[00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.510]  Okay?
[00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.490]  The problem is, is what's in the minds down there.
[00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.611]  And I don't like it.
[00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:29.011]  And I want that to be on record here.
[00:15:29.711 --> 00:15:30.012]  Okay.
[00:15:30.172 --> 00:15:31.172]  I'm done talking about it.
[00:15:31.752 --> 00:15:38.474]  I'm done talking about it, and the globalists are force-feeding this globalism, this collectivism, into the poor folks in Mexico.
[00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:40.314]  I want them to have liberty and freedom.
[00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:42.674]  It's a country with triple the resources than we've got.
[00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.375]  Okay, I said I'd get into the news, and I'm not doing that.
[00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:53.257]  I'm now ranting off into Schwarzenegger, and then segwaying into Mexico, and then going into the next issue, and the next issue after that.
[00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:57.745]  But, you know, sorry to the illegal aliens when they do vote.
[00:15:58.505 --> 00:16:13.111]  I've seen the national polls, over 90% of them vote illegally in many cases, or people that were recently citizens to take my guns, to suck whatever capital's left in me and my family and pay it into the welfare.
[00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:13.591]  I'm done!
[00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:14.512]  The country's bankrupt!
[00:16:14.592 --> 00:16:14.892]  I'm done!
[00:16:15.532 --> 00:16:18.893]  You run your flag up and tell me you're anti-liberty, I'm your enemy.
[00:16:18.933 --> 00:16:30.277]  So get that straight and put it in your pipe and please take a big succulent, corpulent draw of that tobacco of truth down into your lungs and see how you like it.
[00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:32.058]  See how that draws for you.
[00:16:32.098 --> 00:16:37.500]  See if you can grok it, to use a line from a Heinlein book, Stranger in a Strange Land.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.840]  Do you grok it?
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.301]  Do you get it?
[00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:41.361]  Do you read me?
[00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:42.401]  Over.
[00:16:42.582 --> 00:16:43.322]  Good, I'm glad.
[00:16:44.434 --> 00:16:47.836]  Continuing here, this is the big news, really, of the day.
[00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:48.876]  This is the big news.
[00:16:49.257 --> 00:16:54.740]  It's hiding in plain view, and it's just really hard for me to sit here and watch it go on.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:01.263]  But this is part of that Overton window, where they do things so radical that it just trains us all.
[00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:08.227]  They take us a million miles down the road of tyranny, and even though we know it's tyranny, we just basically get our backs broken and accept it.
[00:17:10.038 --> 00:17:14.219]  And as Barry Goldwater said, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.120]  We're dealing with extreme government criminals in both major parties.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:26.662]  We're dealing with extreme decadence and lethargy and sloth-like behavior from the average American, myself included.
[00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:28.503]  We've got to get supercharged
[00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:32.525]  We've got to get awakened, we've got to get angry, and we've got to get focused.
[00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:34.406]  And I know Paul Watson's listening right now.
[00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:36.708]  We're working on an article together.
[00:17:36.728 --> 00:17:42.851]  He's working on some big breaking news with the dead Tweety Birds as well, and what that ties into.
[00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:44.292]  But this is a big story.
[00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:48.674]  And when I saw this last night, I did some research, I did some more this morning.
[00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:50.736]  I'm looking at federal and state law.
[00:17:51.636 --> 00:18:06.542]  But there's no doubt that this is illegal and there's a big paper trail on this and if we can just get the media to pick up on it, but mainline conservative media doesn't want to do this because they do some of these same influence peddling
[00:18:07.402 --> 00:18:29.178]  uh... that the chicago crime machine and and and the mayor's father is literally one of the most famous mobsters in history right up there with bugsy siegel and and uh... al capone uh... of course the chicago police no one denies that's a mafia uh... machine of there ever was one i mean you don't serve the cop his tenth drink he just beats you up i mean it's like well you're drunk we can't let you
[00:18:29.938 --> 00:18:30.899]  Give me the drink!
[00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:32.440]  Shaking people down.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:38.866]  I've been in Chicago just trying to videotape on the streets and had cops march over and just go, turn your cameras off.
[00:18:39.941 --> 00:18:41.423]  But you could tell they were real crooks.
[00:18:41.463 --> 00:18:44.586]  These weren't, you know, normal cops just trying to act like thugs.
[00:18:45.086 --> 00:18:47.569]  And they just got their billy clubs and said, turn them off.
[00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:53.134]  And I could tell right then, it was turn them off or we're gonna give you multiple concussions, maybe even kill you.
[00:18:53.575 --> 00:19:00.622]  And I just said, okay, just because I understand that's an area already destroyed, already taken over by gun-grabbing mafias.
[00:19:00.822 --> 00:19:02.464]  Notice mafias always want your guns.
[00:19:03.348 --> 00:19:16.464]  I mean, when criminals march into a bank and say, you know, stick them up, first person they do, first person they pistol-whip, first thing they do is pistol-whip the guard and take their gun and tie him up.
[00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.293]  I mean, that's what gun control is.
[00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:20.834]  It's tying up the slave.
[00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:23.756]  You think they let slaves in Rome have swords?
[00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:26.698]  You think they let black people 200 years ago have guns?
[00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:29.080]  First gun laws in this country were against blacks.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.141]  Alright, continue.
[00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:33.523]  When we come back, Obama is said to be considering naming J.P.
[00:19:33.543 --> 00:19:37.266]  Morgan's daily to top White House post.
[00:19:40.468 --> 00:19:42.289]  And this just ties into all of this garbage.
[00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:42.669]  Stay with us.
[00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:43.170]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:51.220]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.803]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[00:19:56.143 --> 00:19:58.965]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:09.793]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:14.155]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[00:20:14.455 --> 00:20:19.158]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:22.720]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.763]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[00:20:30.204 --> 00:20:31.324]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:31.384 --> 00:20:31.564]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:20:31.604 --> 00:20:31.805]  Or visit
[00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:48.418]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:48.478 --> 00:20:49.740]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.624]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:56.427]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:20:56.447 --> 00:20:58.449]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:20:58.609 --> 00:21:00.931]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:01.932 --> 00:21:10.683]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:10.844 --> 00:21:14.148]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:17.312]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:21:26.134 --> 00:21:26.714]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:43.627 --> 00:21:44.769]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:51.517]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:54.080]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.547]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:59.747 --> 00:22:02.548]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:04.828]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:22:05.008 --> 00:22:10.989]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:14.510]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:20.251]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:22:20.511 --> 00:22:21.832]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:22:22.152 --> 00:22:23.372]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:26.033]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:22:26.153 --> 00:22:27.573]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:22:27.853 --> 00:22:30.214]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:22:30.394 --> 00:22:34.816]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:22:34.956 --> 00:22:37.417]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:22:43.482 --> 00:22:48.326]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:22:48.706 --> 00:22:49.026]  Listen.
[00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:53.389]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.712]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:22:57.052 --> 00:22:59.894]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:03.477]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:12.094]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:12.294 --> 00:23:14.695]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:14.855 --> 00:23:19.217]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[00:23:19.457 --> 00:23:23.299]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.

[00:23:47.253 --> 00:23:53.285]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:56.872]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:03.234]  We've had a corrupt government for a long time, but it's rotten through and through.
[00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.677]  And nowhere is this illustrated better than the Daley family.
[00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:15.945]  You have the Big Daddy, one of the most famous mob bosses out there, and one of his many children has been the Chicago mayor for a long time.
[00:24:16.025 --> 00:24:21.309]  But William Daley, one of the brothers, is a top JPMorgan Chase & Co.
[00:24:21.449 --> 00:24:23.411]  executive, former U.S.
[00:24:23.471 --> 00:24:24.492]  Commerce Secretary.
[00:24:24.952 --> 00:24:26.193]  He replaced Ron Brown.
[00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:30.862]  Uh, who was, uh, said publicly, if I go down, Clinton's gonna go down.
[00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:47.074]  And then, uh, the aircraft over Serbia, the, uh, special ops on board, the intel we've got is, and this even came out in the news, part of it, uh, put on their oxygen masks, shot everybody on board the plane, blew the side hatch, and, uh, what is it, he-load or high-load out?
[00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:51.798]  There's two different types where they, uh, put on the oxygen mask and jump out at high altitude.
[00:24:52.995 --> 00:25:10.885]  We know that because it got leaked out of the army and out of the different medical centers where the autopsies were done that they all had bullet holes in their heads and they even had the caliber and then the media tried to whitewash that so the head coroner, a colonel went public.
[00:25:10.905 --> 00:25:11.846]  You remember all that.
[00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:13.087]  I don't
[00:25:31.906 --> 00:25:43.731]  Rammed through NAFTA and GATT, top globalist, and his brother helped get behind, of course, Obama, and another little pea that was in the same pod, Blagojevich.
[00:25:43.771 --> 00:25:45.011]  They got him in and his governor.
[00:25:45.391 --> 00:25:50.173]  You know, they get their people in everywhere, and that's how they control society.
[00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:54.415]  And then as soon as they get in, they say, oh, there's thousands of Chevy dealerships.
[00:25:55.115 --> 00:26:00.057]  If you haven't been contributors to the Democratic Party and haven't paid protection money, or if you don't give money right now,
[00:26:01.035 --> 00:26:04.339]  We're going to take your dealership worth millions of dollars and give it to somebody else.
[00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:04.779]  And they did.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:12.167]  And now if you're not an insider and don't give money, well, you don't get the waiver to not have to buy insurance for your employees.
[00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:18.754]  So your hamburger shop or your auto body shop or your factory, you don't have to get health care for your people.
[00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:22.357]  But all your competitors, they do.
[00:26:22.877 --> 00:26:24.819]  So you get to undercut them.
[00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:27.680]  That's really what NAFTA and GATT is on a global scale.
[00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:31.723]  They can have all these tariffs on us overseas, but we can't have any on them.
[00:26:31.763 --> 00:26:34.545]  Then there's no environmental standards, no carbon taxes.
[00:26:34.565 --> 00:26:40.108]  There's many different forms of tariffs that we put on ourselves, not on foreign goods.
[00:26:40.148 --> 00:26:41.349]  That's all part of globalism.
[00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:45.352]  Then the insiders get to write the law where they're exempt, and you wonder,
[00:26:46.668 --> 00:26:52.472]  Why their main retailer, now more than 40% of global retail sales, Death Mart, with the telescreens going in it.
[00:26:53.073 --> 00:26:56.095]  And by the way, I saw the first video of them actually going in.
[00:26:56.615 --> 00:27:03.340]  TV screens right there above the magazines at the checkout counter, with Big Sis, with a AP News feed under it.
[00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:05.913]  So it looks like a TV show.
[00:27:06.253 --> 00:27:07.394]  That's the only thing that's been altered.
[00:27:07.434 --> 00:27:10.837]  It's Big Sis saying, watch everybody, spy on other patrons.
[00:27:11.397 --> 00:27:12.358]  I mean, super creepy.
[00:27:12.378 --> 00:27:13.418]  We're going to play that later.
[00:27:13.438 --> 00:27:16.781]  I think Steve Watson's doing a report on that.
[00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:18.942]  So they're now actually being phased in.
[00:27:19.303 --> 00:27:22.165]  9,000 locations, not just 844 Walmarts.
[00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:23.285]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:26.348]  But looking into the law,
[00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:32.251]  It is clearly influence peddling, and that's what this whole operation is.
[00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:36.415]  And, of course, all of this other thieving is just icing on the cake.
[00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:51.910]  The big one is the trillions being given to the foreign offshore banks, and Congress being buffaloed, I guess a Jedi mind trick's the best term, where the Federal Reserve Chairman and the Treasury Chairman and others just get up there and say, we're not going to tell you where the money went.
[00:27:52.532 --> 00:27:57.354]  In hearing, after hearing in the House and Senate Banking Committee, it's happened hundreds of times now.
[00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:01.295]  Two years ago it was big news when they do it, a year ago it was still big news.
[00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:07.038]  Now we've again been conditioned that just, well, some crooks in suits all mobbed up.
[00:28:07.098 --> 00:28:10.259]  They just tell us they won't, you know, get into where the money went.
[00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:12.400]  And in case you think it's a partisan issue, it's not.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:18.142]  Remember the two trillion missing the day before the World Trade Center's got blown up, Associated Press.
[00:28:19.442 --> 00:28:21.524]  Uh, headline, two trillion missing from Pentagon.
[00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:27.989]  By the time they had congressional hearings in 2005, it was four plus trillion, and the word is now it's over seven trillion.
[00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:34.935]  And some people didn't send me emails, they don't look up the news article to find out I'm telling them the truth, or the congressional hearings that are on, uh, YouTube.
[00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:38.178]  Uh, they, you can just type in, trillions missing from Pentagon.
[00:28:38.738 --> 00:28:42.600]  into YouTube, Google, you'll get articles, video clips, hearings about it.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.760]  People just say it's not true.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.402]  They say, oh, the whole defense budget's only a trillion a year.
[00:28:48.462 --> 00:28:49.962]  How could they be stealing trillions a year?
[00:28:50.263 --> 00:28:53.724]  They stole the Pentagon Pension Fund investments.
[00:28:55.646 --> 00:28:58.549]  And that came out 10 years ago, even ahead of 9-11.
[00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.673]  And it's now come out last year in Bloomberg and AP and Reuters.
[00:29:03.053 --> 00:29:11.862]  Just, oh, Prudential and other insurance carriers 11 years ago in 99 made deals to take veterans' death benefits when they die.
[00:29:12.263 --> 00:29:13.244]  The money's all gone.
[00:29:13.504 --> 00:29:15.005]  Your Social Security's gone.
[00:29:15.706 --> 00:29:20.408]  The death benefits, the health care, you're going to get euthanasia death panels in its place.
[00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:25.510]  But not before they trick you and say, get behind raising taxes and you'll still get your handouts.
[00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.230]  You're not going to get the money you put in.
[00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:27.651]  You got it?
[00:29:28.071 --> 00:29:29.291]  You're not going to get any of it.
[00:29:29.631 --> 00:29:31.412]  You're going to get a boot stomping on your face.
[00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:32.953]  We don't throw this mafia out.
[00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:35.694]  We're on the march.
[00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.774]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:38.715 --> 00:29:41.396]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:47.828]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:29:48.228 --> 00:29:52.271]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:57.174]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:29:57.194 --> 00:30:02.377]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:03.138 --> 00:30:06.340]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.182]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:12.922 --> 00:30:16.664]  I'm looking for America.
[00:30:16.704 --> 00:30:19.866]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:20.086 --> 00:30:22.808]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:22.848 --> 00:30:26.870]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:31.453]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:30:38.877 --> 00:30:43.450]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:48.333]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:48.653 --> 00:30:49.253]  Number 1.
[00:30:49.553 --> 00:30:52.715]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:53.536]  Number 2.
[00:30:53.836 --> 00:30:58.399]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:58.739 --> 00:30:59.180]  It's true.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.043]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:04.343 --> 00:31:04.883]  Number 3.
[00:31:05.183 --> 00:31:08.465]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:12.468]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:13.208]  Number 4.
[00:31:13.469 --> 00:31:15.830]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:19.613]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:19.894 --> 00:31:20.114]  Number 5.
[00:31:20.694 --> 00:31:24.617]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:24.837 --> 00:31:29.601]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:29.881 --> 00:31:33.908]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:34.068 --> 00:31:35.630]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:37.914]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:38.094 --> 00:31:40.438]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:59.262]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:00.263 --> 00:32:03.946]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.952 --> 00:32:16.962]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:17.723 --> 00:32:24.989]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:35.277]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:36.038 --> 00:32:39.321]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:39.961 --> 00:32:43.084]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:32:54.076 --> 00:32:57.502]  On the march, the Empire is on the run.
[00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:02.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:03.391 --> 00:33:08.759]  Yes, the Empire is on the run, but it's in its dangerous, frothing,
[00:33:09.898 --> 00:33:30.291]  Death throes flailing around right now, and the question is, can we salvage any of the Republic during this process, or are the criminals fully aware of what they've done in stealing everything, even nailed down, going to be able to put a high-tech police state in place to further suck us dry?
[00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:32.512]  So getting back to the open
[00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:34.834]  Mafia system in front of us.
[00:33:35.455 --> 00:33:42.480]  You know, almost every other nation on earth has a tiny rich elite and a giant underclass.
[00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:52.917]  You look at Mexico, you look at Argentina, you look at Brazil, you look at Eastern Europe, you look at many areas of Asia, Africa, and Americans always laugh.
[00:33:53.838 --> 00:33:54.918]  Oh, look at the foreigners.
[00:33:54.958 --> 00:33:55.918]  They're so corrupt.
[00:33:56.339 --> 00:34:04.682]  You know, they've got cops with machine guns on the streets in Brazil or Mexico or Nigeria or Eastern Europe.
[00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:06.043]  Oh, look at them.
[00:34:06.163 --> 00:34:08.844]  Their government devalues their currency.
[00:34:09.264 --> 00:34:12.506]  You know, those folks in Mexico, they just can't figure it out.
[00:34:13.286 --> 00:34:20.851]  Well, the United States isn't perfect, but the mainstream media spends a lot of time demonizing what was America, what did work with America.
[00:34:21.132 --> 00:34:23.793]  Because they don't want you to know the antidote to their poison.
[00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:28.196]  They want to try to discredit things that are common sense and we know work.
[00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:33.500]  How did 5% of the world population get roughly half the world's wealth?
[00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:35.281]  How did we do that?
[00:34:35.882 --> 00:34:40.905]  We had more liberty, more freedom than other countries.
[00:34:41.165 --> 00:34:41.586]  That's why.
[00:34:43.243 --> 00:34:46.565]  Geographically, not a very big country compared to many.
[00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:51.727]  Doesn't have the resources of even a Mexico or a Nigeria.
[00:34:51.747 --> 00:34:58.550]  Did you know Nigeria overall has more resources in major Encyclopedia Britannica breakdowns than the United States?
[00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.351]  You know Mexico has triple, roughly?
[00:35:01.051 --> 00:35:05.513]  Whether it's gold, oil, timber, fertile fields, volcanic soil.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:08.975]  A to Z, Mexico's got roughly triple the resources.
[00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:12.517]  Natural gas, fisheries, they got everything.
[00:35:13.197 --> 00:35:15.758]  You go down there and you get outside the tourist traps.
[00:35:16.758 --> 00:35:18.218]  Looks like a bomb hit that place.
[00:35:18.378 --> 00:35:19.558]  Sewage running down the street.
[00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:21.599]  Little kids running around.
[00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.679]  Police bugging their eyes out at you.
[00:35:23.879 --> 00:35:25.340]  The public scared of the police.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.980]  That's called a martial law banana boat republic.
[00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.861]  We know what it looks like.
[00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:35.542]  Now, America is becoming the strip mall version of that.
[00:35:37.213 --> 00:35:41.957]  See, the globalists, it's not just that they don't care and will steal everything and destroy society.
[00:35:42.277 --> 00:35:43.158]  They want to.
[00:35:43.618 --> 00:35:45.760]  They want to destroy the old republic.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.885]  They want to claim that our empire fell when really it's just going to fall into the hands of the IMF and World Bank.
[00:35:52.305 --> 00:35:58.030]  So they've got all these historians now predicting the fall of the American empire, the end of the empire.
[00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:04.193]  Quite frankly, if this empire was run properly, it'd probably never fall because of the high-tech grids that are in place.
[00:36:04.714 --> 00:36:05.834]  They want it to fall.
[00:36:06.215 --> 00:36:07.716]  It's designed to fall.
[00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:11.118]  Fall right on top of those other sovereign nations.
[00:36:11.438 --> 00:36:13.859]  Fall right on top of what's left of our country.
[00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:20.443]  Fall right on top of what's left of this country's reputation.
[00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:26.267]  So, the issue here
[00:36:30.536 --> 00:36:32.919]  People shouldn't make fun of third world countries.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.322]  They never had our founders.
[00:36:35.702 --> 00:36:37.385]  They never had a Bill of Rights.
[00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.147]  They never had a Constitution.
[00:36:39.788 --> 00:36:47.778]  Almost every time other nations have had revolutions, even if it was a good military leader who overthrew the dictator, that guy would get knocked off.
[00:36:48.118 --> 00:37:01.021]  You know, the person who tried to bring in a republic, who tried to bring in a parliament, or a legislature, a congress, people would gather around within the congress and decide to overthrow the whole country for themselves so they could steal all the goods.
[00:37:04.142 --> 00:37:07.243]  But we actually had founders who were different.
[00:37:07.363 --> 00:37:13.524]  They weren't perfect, but they were supermen compared to what every other country's had.
[00:37:13.984 --> 00:37:14.644]  Supermen!
[00:37:14.864 --> 00:37:15.785]  They make the Greek...
[00:37:17.913 --> 00:37:22.095]  system at its height look barbaric and police state.
[00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:28.477]  It makes all other supposed free societies look like a joke, and it's all slipping away.
[00:37:28.797 --> 00:37:29.937]  It's all burning away.
[00:37:29.977 --> 00:37:36.620]  It's all going the way of the Goonie Bird, the Dodo Bird, the Coelacanth.
[00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:40.520]  And I don't like that.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.541]  I don't want to be a slave.
[00:37:42.801 --> 00:37:44.843]  I know what New World Order globalism means.
[00:37:44.903 --> 00:37:55.611]  It means I'm a high-tech slave in a global system run by people who are stated open eugenicists and who on record say they want to forcibly reduce our population.
[00:37:55.871 --> 00:37:58.393]  And I watch the sperm counts drop by 87 percent.
[00:37:58.733 --> 00:38:00.534]  I watch infertility in women skyrocket.
[00:38:00.814 --> 00:38:04.977]  I watch diabetes and cancer and Alzheimer's and arthritis.
[00:38:05.037 --> 00:38:06.038]  The list goes on and on.
[00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:08.200]  Every disease you can imagine off the charts.
[00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:13.078]  And then I look at all the government's own studies, they know full well what they're doing.
[00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:27.864]  But like children, the average person, including bureaucrats and government, are compartmentalized, don't have the knowledge, and even when they come face-to-face with the facts, it's easier to just say, oh, that guy is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:38:28.384 --> 00:38:31.765]  Emma, is it a conspiracy theory that over four trillion's missing from the Pentagon?
[00:38:33.095 --> 00:38:47.081]  Is it a conspiracy theory that we have a mafia running the country who openly gives over 500, last time I checked it's hundreds a month, exemptions to mobbed up companies so they don't have to get health care for their employees but you do, I do?
[00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:53.590]  Is that a conspiracy theory?
[00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:02.694]  Is it a conspiracy theory that four and a half thousand children were publicly, uh, it's been declassified as public information, radiated to death?
[00:39:02.714 --> 00:39:06.496]  I mean, I know I talk about that all the time, it's just one of the more well-known ones of thousands of cases.
[00:39:07.357 --> 00:39:08.557]  So I mention what's known.
[00:39:09.478 --> 00:39:10.758]  Nerve gassing our own troops.
[00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.440]  I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:15.128]  We're really not.
[00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:21.110]  And I'm not here risking my life if I didn't think we had a good chance of beating these people.
[00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:28.712]  It's outrageous, it's cartoonish what they're doing, it's absurd, it's out in the open, it's brazen, and I'm sick of it.
[00:39:33.073 --> 00:39:36.254]  Here's an example of why societies can't ever get it together.
[00:39:37.495 --> 00:39:38.835]  Folks in Pakistan,
[00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:43.870]  They are highly intelligent in their IQ test.
[00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.671]  As smart as anybody in Europe or Japan.
[00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.012]  Highest IQs.
[00:39:51.453 --> 00:39:52.274]  Ancient culture.
[00:39:52.814 --> 00:39:53.634]  Ancient language.
[00:39:55.395 --> 00:39:57.236]  But they've been corrupt forever.
[00:39:57.756 --> 00:40:01.097]  And so, their giant population... What is Pakistan?
[00:40:01.498 --> 00:40:02.178]  Its population?
[00:40:02.218 --> 00:40:03.078]  Is it 100 million?
[00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:04.519]  Or more?
[00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:06.240]  Pull up the Pakistan population for me, please.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.281]  I know Nigeria is like 300 million in Africa, but...
[00:40:10.114 --> 00:40:13.018]  A powerful Pakistani governor killed by own guard.
[00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:16.102]  There's an example.
[00:40:16.663 --> 00:40:25.395]  And whether this governor was a good guy or a bad guy, you know, the issue is that's what Banana Republic is all about.
[00:40:26.938 --> 00:40:27.579]  170 million.
[00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:31.122]  Powerful Pakistani governor killed by own guard.
[00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:45.234]  The governor of Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province was shot dead in the capital today by one of his own guards who later told interrogators that he was angry about the politician's stance against the country's blasphemy law, officials said.
[00:40:45.474 --> 00:40:45.875]  Yeah, sure.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:54.844]  And I'm sure that that former top Bush advisor probably fell and hit his head and fell in a trash can and ended up in the dump.
[00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:58.625]  And I'm sure the mob family, the Dailies, are going to save us.
[00:40:59.566 --> 00:41:00.787]  Because they're such good people.
[00:41:01.787 --> 00:41:03.068]  They're in the Commerce Department.
[00:41:03.108 --> 00:41:04.708]  They'll make sure we get jobs.
[00:41:05.789 --> 00:41:10.831]  I mean, why not hire, you know, one of the guys from Central Casting of the Goodfellas?
[00:41:12.312 --> 00:41:13.713]  What, I'm funny like a clown?
[00:41:17.878 --> 00:41:18.518]  But here it is.
[00:41:18.819 --> 00:41:25.122]  Obama is said to consider naming JPMorgan's Daley to top White House post.
[00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:29.724]  And he's the former head of the Commerce Department.
[00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:38.449]  President Barack Obama is considering naming William Daley a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
[00:41:38.509 --> 00:41:38.989]  executive.
[00:41:39.009 --> 00:41:42.031]  Can we have anybody in the government who isn't JPMorgan Chase for Goldman Sachs?
[00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:46.958]  I mean, most of the third world countries that are being looted are run by Goldman Sachs or J.P.
[00:41:46.998 --> 00:41:48.599]  Morgan alumni, and they just run everything.
[00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:55.841]  There's your problem right there, a bunch of insider trading swindlers, and the Congress has been gelded.
[00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:58.062]  They sit there with their knees knocking, afraid of them.
[00:41:59.302 --> 00:42:02.343]  Such a move, which is still under discussion, would bring Washington veteran.
[00:42:02.703 --> 00:42:04.224]  Oh, a veteran, that's what we need.
[00:42:05.264 --> 00:42:10.246]  Yeah, when you're a mobbed up crook from a crooked organization caught, you know,
[00:42:11.371 --> 00:42:21.036]  Selling derivatives into the world market and rigging the stock market and selling people housing stocks that you know are based on fraud.
[00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:22.937]  That makes you a veteran.
[00:42:24.738 --> 00:42:28.280]  Well, let's exhume or do a seance and make Hitler president.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.181]  I mean, he's a veteran of government.
[00:42:32.422 --> 00:42:36.184]  Such a move, which is still under discussion, would bring a Washington veteran.
[00:42:37.751 --> 00:42:52.863]  And someone with strong business ties to the business, LaCosa Nostra, into the administration as Obama sets out an agenda for the second half of his term while dealing with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives.
[00:42:54.444 --> 00:42:55.345]  I've got another headline.
[00:42:55.665 --> 00:43:01.150]  Obama pledges to use executive power to trump Congress.
[00:43:02.773 --> 00:43:03.333]  Well, why not?
[00:43:03.373 --> 00:43:17.103]  If you've got a bunch of slimy, oily bankers, robber barons in there, stealing everything, why not have Obama just tell Congress, you know, I'll put in greenhouse gas taxes even if Congress doesn't pass it.
[00:43:17.563 --> 00:43:19.264]  Congress passes spending bills.
[00:43:19.544 --> 00:43:21.025]  They've got to originate even in the House.
[00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.106]  The Senate can't even do it.
[00:43:22.486 --> 00:43:23.867]  But, hey, who needs all that?
[00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:30.872]  Struggle of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool, as Begala said back under Clinton in the Eastern era.
[00:43:34.128 --> 00:43:39.575]  And all you conservatives, mainline conservatives, you're about as conservative as Mao Zedong, who don't like this?
[00:43:39.635 --> 00:43:42.619]  I mean, you love the unitary executive, the Fuhrer precept.
[00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:45.784]  When the president does it, it's not illegal under Bush.
[00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:48.287]  You liked all those no-bid contracts.
[00:43:48.888 --> 00:43:51.170]  And then the neocons had a talking point on radio.
[00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.154]  They'd go, of course American companies deserve the contracts.
[00:43:54.534 --> 00:43:57.717]  It wasn't no-bid contracts for just American companies.
[00:43:58.038 --> 00:43:59.679]  No, it could be any foreign company they wanted.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.141]  French, German, didn't matter.
[00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:03.023]  Dutch, Japanese, Chinese.
[00:44:03.664 --> 00:44:04.565]  Most of the time it was.
[00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.947]  It was that it was no bid.
[00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:09.470]  Only one company would be given the deal.
[00:44:10.728 --> 00:44:18.673]  I mean, you like mafia when it's your little monkey, George W. Bush, who looks like central casting from a psycho movie.
[00:44:18.693 --> 00:44:23.777]  I mean, you bought that hook, line, and sinker, so you should enjoy it under Obama.
[00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:25.138]  You should lap it up.
[00:44:25.378 --> 00:44:26.178]  You should love it.
[00:44:26.438 --> 00:44:27.899]  You should love what else is coming.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:39.767]  And I'm telling you this now, so when the Republicans take control of everything, you don't go into a mind-numb coma thinking everything's okay, just like you stupid Democrats with Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama.
[00:44:39.988 --> 00:44:40.628]  I'm sick of it.
[00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.132]  President Barack Obama is considering naming William Daley.
[00:44:46.272 --> 00:44:46.352]  Oh!
[00:44:47.854 --> 00:44:53.158]  Daley's highly respected by the business community and has great connections.
[00:44:53.558 --> 00:44:53.678]  Oh!
[00:44:54.419 --> 00:44:54.539]  Oh!
[00:44:54.659 --> 00:45:01.505]  Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution and former JPMorgan Chase managing director.
[00:45:02.025 --> 00:45:05.488]  Oh, so another JPMorgan guy tells us how great he is!
[00:45:07.397 --> 00:45:12.439]  Oh, look, you know, Don Corleone's underling, Sonny Corleone, is telling us how great he is.
[00:45:12.899 --> 00:45:22.323]  He said in an email, naming daily to the top post, he said, could help mend fences with executives who have complained the Democratic administration is anti-business.
[00:45:23.523 --> 00:45:24.884]  Oh, you got to love that little show.
[00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:30.026]  Oh, Wall Street completely bankrupt.
[00:45:31.923 --> 00:45:34.224]  Bankrolled Obama for the bankrupting of America.
[00:45:34.505 --> 00:45:35.946]  Four times the McCain money.
[00:45:36.306 --> 00:45:37.507]  Again, not that McCain was good.
[00:45:38.107 --> 00:45:43.030]  It was time for a new birdcage liner, a new shill, a new foil, a new frontman.
[00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:46.032]  And so they gave us Obama!
[00:45:47.073 --> 00:45:50.735]  And then whoever Wall Street puts their money on next election, that's the bad guy.
[00:45:51.255 --> 00:45:52.196]  That's the bad man.
[00:45:52.796 --> 00:45:58.420]  That's the next row of sharp, sharp teeth to roll forward in this ugly mouth of theirs.
[00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:01.999]  He's highly respected.
[00:46:02.919 --> 00:46:06.161]  Daley, 62, has deep ties to Obama's political base.
[00:46:06.501 --> 00:46:12.404]  The youngest of seven children of longtime Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.
[00:46:12.524 --> 00:46:14.465]  Oh, what a humanitarian he was.
[00:46:14.985 --> 00:46:17.587]  He is part of the most powerful political dynasty in Illinois.
[00:46:18.447 --> 00:46:20.648]  Who wants your guns, because they're criminals.
[00:46:21.129 --> 00:46:36.197]  He was also a political mentor to Rahm Emanuel, along with the other two stooges, Barack Obama and of course Blagojevich, who worked with Daley in President Bill Clinton's administration and served as Obama's first Chief of Staff.
[00:46:36.617 --> 00:46:42.401]  Emanuel 51 now is running to succeed Daley's brother, Richard M. Daley, as Mayor of Chicago.
[00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:48.743]  Yeah, we'll put our boy in there and then we'll move into the White House and continue with our people in all the chairs.
[00:46:49.284 --> 00:46:50.724]  It's never been better for us!
[00:46:51.224 --> 00:46:54.466]  As soon as we get the American people's guns, it's gonna be even better!
[00:46:55.612 --> 00:47:02.497]  Right now, Chicago's suing a whole bunch of states trying to get laws passed to take people's guns in places like Texas.
[00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:03.858]  It's so wonderful.
[00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.720]  There's no end to what we can do.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.381]  Capone taught us well.
[00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:11.204]  There's nothing these schmucks won't take or go along with.
[00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:12.945]  It just gets better and better.
[00:47:14.406 --> 00:47:16.888]  I call America the happy hunting ground.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:31.505]  During the 2008 presidential race, William Daley was an economic advisor to Obama and was co-chairman of his transition team after the election.
[00:47:32.686 --> 00:47:36.849]  Daley, whose typical response to questions, didn't return messages.
[00:47:36.869 --> 00:47:37.750]  And it just goes on.
[00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:42.693]  Now, what did Blagojevich get in trouble for?
[00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.095]  List of impeachment charges against Blagojevich.
[00:47:46.216 --> 00:47:52.180]  The Illinois House Articles of Impeachment against Blagojevich accused him of... Now see, in the past, this was all illegal.
[00:47:53.578 --> 00:48:03.863]  But now, I mean, fifty years ago, a hundred years ago, Americans, if they saw a big family taking everything over, and all the corruption, and all the insiders, they would all be indicted and go to jail.
[00:48:04.963 --> 00:48:10.266]  Insider manipulation, influence peddling, racketeering, not anymore!
[00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:18.890]  Now there's Bloomberg articles about how great you are, and how you're a veteran of business, and respected, and good, and oh!
[00:48:22.179 --> 00:48:23.921]  What was the first article of impeachment?
[00:48:24.322 --> 00:48:32.051]  Plotting to obtain a personal benefit in exchange for his appointment to fill the vacant seat in the United States Senate.
[00:48:33.433 --> 00:48:35.956]  What do you think the dailies backed Obama?
[00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:41.462]  I mean, literally brought him up knee-high to a grasshopper out of the CIA stables.
[00:48:43.706 --> 00:48:55.634]  And Blagojevich, and Emanuel, and all these little gangsterlets, all these little gangster rugrats to be put in over by us so the old dons can sit there and pull their strings.
[00:48:55.934 --> 00:48:57.055]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:48:57.395 --> 00:49:00.217]  Because the American people don't have a common sense immune system.
[00:49:01.037 --> 00:49:04.680]  The more they get run over, the more they ask for it, the more they beg.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.722]  The mafia brings in their TSA for dog training.
[00:49:10.002 --> 00:49:12.523]  Train them to let us put our hands down their pants!
[00:49:13.023 --> 00:49:15.285]  We'll make them pay tax money to be radiated.
[00:49:16.025 --> 00:49:18.386]  We'll lie to them and tell them we're not saving the images.
[00:49:18.566 --> 00:49:20.448]  And when they find out we're lying, big deal!
[00:49:21.465 --> 00:49:23.746]  We'll put the ACLU on a terror list.
[00:49:24.687 --> 00:49:31.611]  We'll put that Ron Paul guy on a terror list.
[00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:39.036]  I want the CIA and ATF and FBI's on that Ron Paul right now.
[00:49:39.056 --> 00:49:47.662]  And I want all the law enforcement magazines to say right now that if you see a Ron Paul sticker, you pull him over.
[00:49:48.622 --> 00:49:52.484]  And I want it right now that they gotta get us out of the UN sticker.
[00:49:52.524 --> 00:49:57.887]  That thing's working good for us, bringing in the narcotics, setting up Our Thing worldwide.
[00:49:58.668 --> 00:50:02.410]  The DEA helping bring in the drugs, shutting down our competition.
[00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:13.676]  Let me tell you something, I want the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center to put it on paper that anybody that stands up against Our Thing, La Colsa Nostra, is on the list.
[00:50:14.156 --> 00:50:15.978]  We're gonna do it like Stalin and Hitler!
[00:50:16.118 --> 00:50:17.038]  We're gonna get tough!
[00:50:17.239 --> 00:50:18.340]  We'll knock their heads!
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.481]  The cops fully work for us now!
[00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:22.043]  This country belongs to us!
[00:50:22.263 --> 00:50:23.384]  And we're taking it over!
[00:50:23.544 --> 00:50:24.144]  You got it?
[00:50:24.805 --> 00:50:25.165]  Good!
[00:50:25.445 --> 00:50:27.047]  And next we're gonna get your guns!
[00:50:27.527 --> 00:50:31.450]  And we'll march all these dumb cops out there to dying shootouts with all of ya!
[00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:32.912]  While we sit back and laugh!
[00:50:33.232 --> 00:50:34.233]  Cause it's our thing!
[00:50:34.693 --> 00:50:36.635]  There's nothing you chumps won't take!
[00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:38.536]  Nothing you chumps won't buy!
[00:50:38.716 --> 00:50:39.357]  And you know what?
[00:50:39.597 --> 00:50:40.898]  We're gonna oblige ya!
[00:50:41.118 --> 00:50:41.679]  Get ready!
[00:50:42.159 --> 00:50:44.561]  Get ready for Chicagoland worldwide!
[00:50:45.162 --> 00:50:48.284]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.

[00:51:44.281 --> 00:51:52.164]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:51:52.444 --> 00:51:54.745]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:51:55.005 --> 00:52:00.207]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:00.407 --> 00:52:03.208]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:05.429]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:11.650]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:15.191]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:20.912]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:21.172 --> 00:52:22.492]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:22.812 --> 00:52:23.993]  I can't stress this enough.

[00:53:54.261 --> 00:53:59.023]  Hey boss, is it really our country now?
[00:53:59.143 --> 00:54:08.468]  We can rob and rape whoever we want with full government power?
[00:54:08.488 --> 00:54:09.728]  Yes, you bet we can.
[00:54:09.808 --> 00:54:10.889]  It's our country now.
[00:54:10.969 --> 00:54:12.850]  I am unleashing you to dominate them all.
[00:54:23.036 --> 00:54:24.987]  This time I'll get you Gadget!
[00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:40.632]  Meet your new president.
[00:54:40.832 --> 00:54:42.454]  He's my puppet.
[00:54:42.554 --> 00:54:44.856]  His name is Bugsy.
[00:54:45.677 --> 00:54:46.858]  Yeah, that's right boss.
[00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:48.679]  I like being the president now.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.164]  You know, my name's Barack Obama and the bots are getting sick of me.
[00:54:53.204 --> 00:54:53.824]  What are you gonna do?
[00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:58.007]  Now I'm going to get a Republican ready.
[00:54:58.467 --> 00:55:01.669]  Maybe Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney.
[00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:04.310]  The Conservatives will buy into all of it.
[00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.551]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:08.093]  There's nothing that can stop us now.
[00:55:08.853 --> 00:55:11.194]  Look at the public drink the fluoride.
[00:55:11.735 --> 00:55:13.876]  There's nothing they won't do now.
[00:55:14.256 --> 00:55:16.997]  They could never imagine what I've done.
[00:55:18.018 --> 00:55:18.398]  I don't know.
[00:55:45.348 --> 00:55:47.129]  Everybody knows.
[00:55:50.409 --> 00:55:54.331]  And so it goes.
[00:55:54.411 --> 00:55:55.391]  Everybody knows.
[00:55:56.551 --> 00:55:58.772]  That America is mafia run.
[00:55:58.832 --> 00:56:01.212]  But a lot of the yuppies don't care.
[00:56:01.252 --> 00:56:03.413]  They've had freedom so long they...
[00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:16.319]  They like a boot on their neck.
[00:56:17.279 --> 00:56:19.740]  Yeah, boys, it's our time now, isn't it?
[00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:22.522]  Of course it is.
[00:56:25.543 --> 00:56:27.564]  You know, I could do voiceovers.
[00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.425]  I've actually been approached, but I don't have time to do it.
[00:56:29.445 --> 00:56:31.706]  Because you don't just get the jobs.
[00:56:31.726 --> 00:56:33.227]  They want you to then audition for it.
[00:56:33.247 --> 00:56:35.568]  And I'm too busy fighting the New World Order.
[00:56:36.468 --> 00:56:43.031]  But I can do... I can do Captain Avatar from Star Blazers.
[00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:43.872]  You guys want to hear that?
[00:56:45.951 --> 00:56:47.171]  Aim carefully, men.
[00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:48.812]  Those are Gamelon ships.
[00:56:49.152 --> 00:56:51.253]  I actually have to get into character to do it properly.
[00:56:53.653 --> 00:56:57.335]  Wildstar, I'm counting on you as deputy captain.
[00:57:00.376 --> 00:57:07.538]  In the year 2199, Earth was attacked by the mysterious Gamelon space fleet, led by Barry Saturro.
[00:57:09.633 --> 00:57:12.134]  Deadly planet bombs are destroying the Earth's surface.
[00:57:12.774 --> 00:57:18.537]  If the Star Force doesn't get the Cosmo DNA in just one year, planet Earth will be uninhabitable.
[00:57:18.957 --> 00:57:20.578]  Hurry, Star Force, hurry!
[00:57:23.079 --> 00:57:26.800]  You know, the truth is, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.542]  I was on coast to coast AM last night, then I got wound up and couldn't go to sleep.
[00:57:32.062 --> 00:57:35.384]  Then a big national show, Opie and Anthony, called me at 6.30 in the morning.
[00:57:35.664 --> 00:57:37.385]  I was in a deep sleep and put me directly on air.
[00:57:39.186 --> 00:57:45.872]  And I am very tired and I apologize for screwing around some, but it is a psychological defense mechanism.
[00:57:46.112 --> 00:57:46.752]  We all have it.
[00:57:47.613 --> 00:57:53.659]  You know, I criticize folks for not staying focused and serious and being into diversions and distractions, but imagine being yours truly.
[00:57:54.159 --> 00:57:56.121]  I mean, I've only gotten into one article today.
[00:57:57.062 --> 00:57:58.703]  I've only gotten into one article.
[00:58:00.104 --> 00:58:04.808]  And, of course, it brought us in a thousand different directions, but when we return, I'm going into all the others.
[00:58:06.704 --> 00:58:11.168]  Wayne Madsen's joining us, and then the one, the only... Who'd I make the check out to?
[00:58:11.768 --> 00:58:14.090]  Max Keiser will be joining us, the one, the only.
[00:58:14.551 --> 00:58:15.472]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:15.532 --> 00:58:21.177]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv are our websites.
[00:58:21.417 --> 00:58:22.618]  Transmission continues!
[00:58:22.638 --> 00:58:23.438]  Oh dear!
[00:58:24.324 --> 00:58:28.807]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:58:28.967 --> 00:58:30.228]  Search no more.
[00:58:30.488 --> 00:58:33.610]  We are the GCA Radio Network.
[00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:38.453]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:38.673 --> 00:58:44.697]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:58:45.077 --> 00:58:52.183]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:58:52.463 --> 00:58:57.047]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated subs anywhere.
[00:58:57.347 --> 00:59:05.834]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:59:06.014 --> 00:59:09.737]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:59:10.257 --> 00:59:16.443]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:17.023 --> 00:59:20.447]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:59:20.927 --> 00:59:28.254]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:59:28.354 --> 00:59:28.814]  Thank you.
[00:59:37.395 --> 00:59:39.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:39.777 --> 00:59:42.659]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:49.744]  Big Brother.
[00:59:50.384 --> 00:59:51.425]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:52.165 --> 00:59:53.346]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:53.907 --> 00:59:54.727]  You want answers?
[00:59:55.488 --> 00:59:57.409]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:57.429 --> 01:00:00.651]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:05.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:25.354]  Hey guys, I know it was in my stack, but it was the next piece of news I was going to get to.
[01:00:26.294 --> 01:00:29.075]  Rather than dig through the stacks, will you just reprint me?
[01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:34.496]  It's a... Examiner story?
[01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:38.497]  And then it's got quotes, I believe, out of the Washington Post.
[01:00:38.557 --> 01:00:42.478]  Obama is going to use executive power to trump Republican Congress.
[01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:43.518]  I believe that's the headline.
[01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:45.239]  Because I want to get into that.
[01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:49.280]  That deals with this whole massive abuse of power situation.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:49.740]  I found it.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.020]  Never mind, I found it right here.
[01:00:53.575 --> 01:00:54.635]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[01:00:54.675 --> 01:01:14.581]  We're into our number two here today, and I've been going through a lot of different gesticulations of outrage, dealing with the daily mob machine, the Chicago machine, taking over every facet of our society.
[01:01:15.161 --> 01:01:20.422]  Obama ready to deploy executive powers against GOP on the Hill.
[01:01:21.363 --> 01:01:22.063]  Deploy them!
[01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:26.204]  Of course, Congress makes the laws.
[01:01:26.264 --> 01:01:27.765]  Congress controls the purse strings.
[01:01:28.386 --> 01:01:34.391]  But in this upside-down world, people thought, well, Obama's going to clean up all this rampaging executive power.
[01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.974]  Obama's going to get tough on Bush crimes.
[01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:39.815]  How about accelerating all of them?
[01:01:40.216 --> 01:01:43.058]  And all these Democrats are going, we're so disappointed.
[01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:45.540]  I'm so disappointed, Archie.
[01:01:46.201 --> 01:01:47.202]  Oh, shut up, Eden.
[01:01:48.157 --> 01:01:53.881]  And it goes on, Obama ready to deploy executive powers against GOP on the Hill.
[01:01:54.842 --> 01:02:02.488]  President Obama challenged Congressional Republicans to embrace the shared responsibility of governance, even as the...
[01:02:04.434 --> 01:02:09.656]  They're putting the mob boss, JPMorgan Chase, daily in the White House, running things.
[01:02:10.797 --> 01:02:16.119]  And that is all spun as he's experienced.
[01:02:16.179 --> 01:02:16.940]  He's a veteran.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.800]  He's a good guy.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.021]  I have other articles.
[01:02:19.061 --> 01:02:20.481]  He's going to fight corruption.
[01:02:21.162 --> 01:02:21.442]  Yes.
[01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:25.884]  We're deploying 14 weasels and 9 wolves to guard the hen house tonight.
[01:02:26.304 --> 01:02:30.726]  They're experts in keeping the chickens safe.
[01:02:31.446 --> 01:02:32.247]  Going in your house.
[01:02:33.439 --> 01:02:34.541]  Play a game of dominoes.
[01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:36.103]  Drink some moonshine.
[01:02:36.944 --> 01:02:38.486]  The chickens will all be fine in the morning.
[01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:41.711]  Continuing here.
[01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:43.494]  So I'm going to be getting into that.
[01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:45.357]  That's all coming up.
[01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:50.133]  We've got some other issues dealing with the First Amendment.
[01:02:50.573 --> 01:03:00.958]  I want to get into the blackbirds dying, and now more of the same species dropping dead in Louisiana and other states.
[01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:03.460]  And I would be happy about that.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.643]  Not happy that the birds are dying, but happy if they were dying in other states, because that would lean towards a disease.
[01:03:10.243 --> 01:03:12.605]  The problem is the Fish and Wildlife Department and others
[01:03:13.405 --> 01:03:14.325]  And I saw it on CNN.
[01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:15.566]  They had them all chopped open.
[01:03:15.586 --> 01:03:19.547]  The guy was just pulling them open and went, look, they're just turned into blood.
[01:03:20.348 --> 01:03:27.190]  Their livers, their breast meat, their organs, their muscle tissue is liquefied.
[01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.471]  Something incredibly catastrophic did this.
[01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:31.392]  But these are birds that roost at night.
[01:03:32.712 --> 01:03:33.853]  No one heard explosions.
[01:03:33.913 --> 01:03:34.513]  Nothing happened.
[01:03:34.533 --> 01:03:35.613]  None of the buildings got damaged.
[01:03:35.633 --> 01:03:36.854]  There wasn't some big storm.
[01:03:37.194 --> 01:03:39.075]  Some bad weather had gone through previously.
[01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:42.576]  And no one knows what happened to them.
[01:03:45.683 --> 01:03:48.964]  And we know that they've got C-130s with particle lasers in them.
[01:03:48.984 --> 01:03:52.206]  We know they've got all sorts of electromagnetic-type weaponry.
[01:03:52.226 --> 01:03:53.766]  I mean, a lot of that's declassified.
[01:03:54.127 --> 01:04:00.649]  All I'm saying is, with all the secret government testing we've seen, up 10 trillion times, that's the main suspect.
[01:04:00.669 --> 01:04:04.971]  But if somebody can explain to me what's going on with this, then I would love to hear it.
[01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.653]  And I will open the phones up in this hour.
[01:04:08.753 --> 01:04:09.973]  Edwin Wayne Madsen's on with us.
[01:04:09.993 --> 01:04:11.274]  Gonna bring up the birdies to him.
[01:04:11.294 --> 01:04:13.935]  I don't think Sylvester did it.
[01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.590]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:16.650]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.972]  We will get you up and on the air today.
[01:04:19.112 --> 01:04:22.415]  On the bird issue, I want to hear what you think about the birds.
[01:04:22.616 --> 01:04:26.980]  Are you there in BB, Arkansas, or other areas of the country?
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.740]  Tell us what you've seen.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.561]  The fish dying, 100,000 of them.
[01:04:28.581 --> 01:04:28.861]  These drum.
[01:04:28.881 --> 01:04:29.382]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:29.902]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:52.358]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:04:52.619 --> 01:04:54.901]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:04:55.181 --> 01:05:00.366]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:00.546 --> 01:05:03.329]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:05.671]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:11.835]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:12.155 --> 01:05:15.357]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:21.060]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.621]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:24.122]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:24.262 --> 01:05:26.804]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:30.986]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:05:44.824 --> 01:05:47.445]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:52.806]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.887]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:55.207 --> 01:06:00.028]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.169]  How much do you want?
[01:06:01.389 --> 01:06:02.149]  When do you want it?
[01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:04.130]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:05.230]  When will you need it?
[01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:07.531]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:08.671]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.351]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:15.613]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:15.813 --> 01:06:18.995]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:19.395 --> 01:06:22.896]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:23.216 --> 01:06:24.196]  How much will you need?
[01:06:24.437 --> 01:06:25.057]  We don't know.
[01:06:25.337 --> 01:06:26.257]  How much do you want?
[01:06:26.437 --> 01:06:27.177]  All you can get.
[01:06:27.378 --> 01:06:28.218]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.478 --> 01:06:31.179]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:31.519 --> 01:06:33.700]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.721]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:48.732]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:49.132 --> 01:06:52.133]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:52.373 --> 01:06:57.134]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:57.154 --> 01:07:03.356]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:03.556 --> 01:07:08.524]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.941]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:07:21.201 --> 01:07:22.542]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:22.782 --> 01:07:25.063]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:25.243 --> 01:07:27.083]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:27.103 --> 01:07:32.146]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:41.630]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:50.519]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:00.848 --> 01:08:10.095]  Okay, I'm going to give you my take on the birds, and then get into Obama ready to deploy executive powers against GOP Hill.
[01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:22.858]  And we're already seeing this where they couldn't pass the greenhouse gas tax system federally, so Obama has come in and seized the permitting process for power plants in Texas.
[01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:27.882]  So see, as long as the state does what the bureaucracy says, not what the Congress says...
[01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:31.843]  And that'd be a state's rights issue right there, outside federal jurisdiction.
[01:08:32.243 --> 01:08:33.724]  Power generated inside this state.
[01:08:34.004 --> 01:08:36.564]  But still, there's some federal argument there.
[01:08:37.124 --> 01:08:43.326]  But with no law, no nothing, the feds just show up and say, we're taking over your power plants, here's the higher standards.
[01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:45.367]  If you can't meet these, shut down.
[01:08:46.363 --> 01:08:51.564]  And then giant fines start racking up every day they're in operation until they get shut down.
[01:08:51.804 --> 01:08:52.525]  Don't worry, though.
[01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:53.765]  They'll just pay the fines.
[01:08:54.045 --> 01:08:55.325]  You'll pay the fines.
[01:08:55.926 --> 01:08:56.866]  I'll pay the fines.
[01:08:56.886 --> 01:09:01.427]  But, oh, no environmental standards on Chinese reactors 2 to 3 being built.
[01:09:01.947 --> 01:09:06.088]  Excuse me, power generators, not nuclear reactors, coal-powered plants.
[01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:07.849]  So that is coming up.
[01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:15.431]  Briefly, before I go to your calls and get your take on the birds, and I do want it to be brief because I want to get to everybody here.
[01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:21.371]  1-800-259-9231, ahead of Wayne Madsen popping in and then Max Keiser on the economy in 2011 that we're now in, hurtling towards 2012 and beyond.
[01:09:21.391 --> 01:09:22.172]  But I wanted to just state,
[01:09:32.242 --> 01:09:43.705]  Normally when green goo rains from the sky, it's happening routinely, or when stuff gets sprayed and there aren't eyewitnesses who can conclusively prove that it was government, we don't really go there.
[01:09:44.205 --> 01:09:58.649]  But we know that there have been, as I've said, thousands and thousands of admitted, declassified programs with, in many cases, lethal or toxic chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals.
[01:09:58.929 --> 01:09:59.769]  That's all on record.
[01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:01.830]  You've seen it up to a million times yourself on the news.
[01:10:03.422 --> 01:10:04.702]  But they always report it dryly.
[01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.603]  Oh, the government killed some troops.
[01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.263]  Oh, the government injected some kids.
[01:10:08.724 --> 01:10:10.024]  Oh, the government spread polio.
[01:10:10.384 --> 01:10:14.665]  Oh, you know, here's the inventor of the polio vaccine laughing about how they knew it had cancer viruses in it.
[01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:15.726]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:10:15.746 --> 01:10:21.727]  A hundred plus million Americans contracted viral-borne cancers that were rare before and now common and died.
[01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:22.808]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:10:23.088 --> 01:10:24.308]  I mean, this is all just public.
[01:10:27.769 --> 01:10:30.010]  And so we have to look at
[01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:59.529]  what could have done this and as we go down the line eliminating everything what's left but some type of government experiment or government test or there's been a lot of mainline scientific theories and it's been videoed all over the world minutes before a giant earthquake that aurora borealis type things even form in the daylight some type of giant tectonic shift with untold quadrillions
[01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:04.038]  I don't even know the mass of huge tectonic plates.
[01:11:04.058 --> 01:11:05.079]  We have to do the calculation.
[01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:13.083]  Colliding with each other and it causes some type of electromagnetic event that manifests in the atmosphere.
[01:11:13.784 --> 01:11:27.551]  Kind of like when you're walking across the carpet on a dry December day and you touch the refrigerator metal door and you see... I've been in the dark before going to the refrigerator for a glass of milk the middle of the night and I've seen the electricity.
[01:11:27.591 --> 01:11:28.692]  I've seen the blue arc.
[01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:55.039]  That's a microcosm of why it's been documented for thousands of years that right ahead of an earthquake, birds start flying out of the area, fish start swimming the other direction, dolphins start running, sometimes days before because they can sense in the magnetic field, which more and more science shows all animals can pick up on in the brain, in the hypothalamus and other areas, but animals go with their instinct and go the other direction.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.680]  And that's a manifestation of it, those lights
[01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:04.068]  You know, appearing minutes or sometimes hours, sometimes days before.
[01:12:04.428 --> 01:12:05.990]  It looks just like an Aurora Borealis.
[01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:09.552]  Green, yellow, bluish light can be seen even in daylight.
[01:12:09.832 --> 01:12:16.917]  Sometimes it's so bright, but especially at night, people will be in South America where they don't have an Aurora Borealis like they have the North and South Pole.
[01:12:16.937 --> 01:12:17.918]  They'll be like, what is that?
[01:12:18.658 --> 01:12:23.702]  They notice birds are all flying at the opposite direction, freaking out, monkeys are going crazy.
[01:12:24.242 --> 01:12:25.303]  I mean, this stuff goes on.
[01:12:25.343 --> 01:12:26.284]  It's been well documented.
[01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:28.030]  Mainline science.
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:30.071]  You can research it for yourself if you'd like to look into it.
[01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:30.931]  I know most of you already know that.
[01:12:31.532 --> 01:12:34.813]  But the issue here is, it could have been something like that.
[01:12:34.973 --> 01:12:43.656]  You got the fish dying, but that happens because of oxygen shifts, or they may have had a bloom of fish and they were overpopulated and it was a natural culling.
[01:12:44.076 --> 01:12:44.576]  We don't know.
[01:12:44.956 --> 01:12:46.117]  But the two could be related.
[01:12:46.537 --> 01:12:49.378]  But now you've got birds in Louisiana.
[01:12:49.938 --> 01:12:51.138]  First it was 500, now it's 1,000 as they find more.
[01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.781]  The same species of blackbird.
[01:12:56.261 --> 01:13:06.529]  Very, very bizarre, because if they were falling out of the sky in the region, you'd normally think they had contracted a virus or a bacteria, and then only certain numbers would die.
[01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:12.493]  And then when the veterinarians from the state and local cut them open, they would see the evidence of disease.
[01:13:13.374 --> 01:13:14.275]  They're totally healthy.
[01:13:15.268 --> 01:13:20.072]  And the head of the Fish and Wildlife, their head veterinarian's on record saying they were pulverized inside.
[01:13:20.973 --> 01:13:26.557]  And that's not going to happen from some birds running into each other scared from fireworks over a whole town.
[01:13:26.977 --> 01:13:32.422]  First it was a half mile, then a mile, then a mile and a half, now two miles, now they're finding them all over the town.
[01:13:32.902 --> 01:13:36.245]  Going out upwards of three miles depending on the local report you look at.
[01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:43.831]  The issue here is that it might be disease in Louisiana and other states with these dead
[01:13:45.925 --> 01:13:47.986]  Starlings or cedar waxwings.
[01:13:48.026 --> 01:13:48.407]  I forget.
[01:13:48.447 --> 01:13:48.987]  What are they?
[01:13:49.247 --> 01:13:50.848]  What's the black bird with the little red patch?
[01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:52.810]  What's the species of this critter?
[01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:57.473]  I get my apples and oranges mixed up.
[01:13:57.513 --> 01:13:57.813]  Thank you.
[01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.254]  Look that up for me, brain.
[01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:05.750]  But the issue that I'm trying to cover here is this thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.131]  And it's a big mystery.
[01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:16.518]  And if I can take that mystery and write about it at Infowars.com and then get nationally syndicated radio shows like
[01:14:16.778 --> 01:14:19.820]  Coast-to-coast AM reaching 16 million people a night.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.522]  Openy and Anthony reaching about 2 million a day.
[01:14:23.823 --> 01:14:25.884]  Drudge Report reaching tens of millions a day.
[01:14:26.365 --> 01:14:29.086]  To link to the story, and we're asking the real question.
[01:14:29.106 --> 01:14:33.729]  You've got to look at the number one culprits of bizarre happenings and chemical, biological, radiological testing.
[01:14:33.749 --> 01:14:34.230]  It's government.
[01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:36.231]  And so we link over there to the government.
[01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:42.255]  Archives and sites where they admit that they've done tests like this in the past many times.
[01:14:42.555 --> 01:14:45.757]  And so people now are looking at one of the
[01:14:48.018 --> 01:14:54.200]  Possible causes of this, but becoming educated about all the other admissions while we go along.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.901]  Yeah, it's Red Wing Blackbirds.
[01:14:57.801 --> 01:15:04.623]  So it's... It's Cedar... Waxwings, I believe is their name.
[01:15:05.643 --> 01:15:08.984]  The media is calling them Blackbirds and Black Redbirds.
[01:15:09.865 --> 01:15:11.225]  I believe it's Cedar Waxwing, correct?
[01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:15.834]  Now they're saying they're starlings.
[01:15:15.874 --> 01:15:16.194]  Whatever.
[01:15:16.234 --> 01:15:17.675]  The blackbird's a little red patch.
[01:15:17.915 --> 01:15:25.501]  And they said it's the same species in Louisiana and in Arkansas.
[01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.522]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:15:28.603 --> 01:15:29.144]  Let's talk.
[01:15:29.264 --> 01:15:30.385]  I want to go as quickly as possible.
[01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:32.026]  Randy in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:15:33.038 --> 01:15:48.336]  Yes, this is exactly what you said happened as well with the barium and finding the lead when they did the plain trails and then following that there was a story on the news covering it and exactly what's happening with the birds is what's when you mentioned it.
[01:15:48.356 --> 01:15:49.377]  We did get reports out of
[01:15:49.617 --> 01:16:04.207]  Arkansas and I know over the weekend here in Texas it was chemtrail central and for those that don't know the government admits and has the patents for barium salts aluminum dioxide added to jet fuel to then be dispersed and the airlines don't even know they're doing it sorry go ahead
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:09.522]  Well, I'm just saying, yeah, that came true exactly like you said, like a year after.
[01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:13.704]  And same thing as well, I'll just give you an example.
[01:16:13.744 --> 01:16:19.406]  Today I was watching the news and on comes this thing about an iPhone app to tell people on the road.
[01:16:19.466 --> 01:16:23.848]  And they're going to cover it tonight on our Detroit News here in Michigan, WDIV Channel 4.
[01:16:24.408 --> 01:16:25.369]  And they're going to cover it.
[01:16:25.909 --> 01:16:26.991]  We're good to go.
[01:16:36.286 --> 01:16:46.133]  The bird issue is tied into that same thing with the barium and the lead being found and then all of a sudden it's on the news this guy went out and you know just a homeowner went and collected it somehow and brought it in and found all this stuff in there.
[01:16:46.573 --> 01:16:48.214]  Barium is used for like radioactive...
[01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:06.586]  Arkansas?
[01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:16.597]  Well, I'm not sure if it was in, it might have been Arkansas, I'm not, but I remember finding a YouTube clip of the actual local news clip of a, like I don't know if it was a farmer or a guy that found it.
[01:17:16.617 --> 01:17:21.002]  No, no, I've seen news reports where they've tested the chemtrails and it's been, Barry M, I appreciate your call.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:27.562]  Speaking of surveillance, they don't come out and say, ooh, it's Big Brother, we're going to watch you in your house.
[01:17:28.142 --> 01:17:33.784]  They had the Houston police chief five years ago come out, or four years ago, and say, oh, we're going to put cameras in your homes.
[01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:35.284]  That might help stop crime.
[01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:47.128]  They have a New York Times article about how great it is that smart cameras are going in everywhere to watch doctors and make sure they wash their hands, to watch employees, to watch kids, and report you to the police if you don't.
[01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.649]  See, you're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:53.412]  And it's worse than 1984, and they're just going to it.
[01:17:53.972 --> 01:17:55.613]  Let's talk to Wayne in Arkansas.
[01:17:55.653 --> 01:17:56.354]  Wayne, you're on the air.
[01:17:57.755 --> 01:17:58.335]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:58.355 --> 01:17:58.796]  How you doing?
[01:17:59.076 --> 01:17:59.296]  Good.
[01:17:59.336 --> 01:17:59.676]  Go ahead.
[01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:09.343]  Well, first off, I live up here in a area called Searcy County, which is north central Ozarks, about probably an hour north of DB.
[01:18:10.764 --> 01:18:14.106]  And we've noticed just unbelievable chem spraying the last several years.
[01:18:16.138 --> 01:18:19.860]  In all species of birds, the turkeys have basically disappeared.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.200]  Yeah, I've got the reports here.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:24.502]  Not just the bees, but the bumblebees are almost all dying.
[01:18:24.782 --> 01:18:26.322]  But the government's not worried about that.
[01:18:26.342 --> 01:18:28.943]  They want to put a tax on carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:34.146]  Well, it's obvious that there's other things going on.
[01:18:34.186 --> 01:18:41.689]  I heard you on Coast to Coast last night and tried to call in because we're also, and this may sound crazy to some of the people out there listening, but we're also seeing
[01:18:42.466 --> 01:18:44.388]  Strange craft in the air at night.
[01:18:44.508 --> 01:18:46.249]  They're definitely not helicopters.
[01:18:46.329 --> 01:18:49.752]  No, no, the government admits they've given the state and local government covertly.
[01:18:49.772 --> 01:18:51.313]  They have National Guard running them.
[01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:52.734]  All sorts of drones.
[01:18:53.254 --> 01:18:54.956]  And a lot of them look like flying saucers.
[01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.458]  And it's all meant to, again, scare everybody.
[01:18:58.258 --> 01:19:00.840]  Yeah, there's a lot of strange things going on up here.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:04.303]  And, uh, you know, I think it's all tying in.
[01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.124]  I listen to you basically every day.
[01:19:06.365 --> 01:19:10.348]  And I think it's all tying in with the biblical prophecies and that these people are, uh,
[01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:14.234]  Basically they're tied to Satan, the people that run our world now.
[01:19:14.534 --> 01:19:18.736]  And I think people better get through this thing the way they can.
[01:19:18.756 --> 01:19:21.377]  That's why I moved up here several years ago from Texas.
[01:19:21.397 --> 01:19:22.318]  I actually used to live in Texas.
[01:19:23.243 --> 01:19:27.765]  Houston, Texas down there, and I'm sure you're aware of what an evil corporate place that is.
[01:19:27.945 --> 01:19:30.506]  Oh, they had drones six, seven years ago surveilling you there.
[01:19:30.886 --> 01:19:42.171]  But don't worry, the Pentagon now is going to domestically deploy something called the Gorgon, with eight face-scanning cameras flying around in disc-shaped craft, face-scanning you in the streets.
[01:19:42.551 --> 01:19:43.872]  And it's called the Gorgon.
[01:19:44.853 --> 01:19:48.116]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:53.162]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:19:53.442 --> 01:19:59.368]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:19:59.608 --> 01:20:01.750]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:07.977]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:08.117 --> 01:20:11.440]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:13.222]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:13.402 --> 01:20:15.445]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:15.585 --> 01:20:20.250]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:21.090]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.315]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:30.337]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:30.357 --> 01:20:31.477]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:32.238]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:48.809]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:20:48.849 --> 01:20:50.110]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:53.994]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:20:54.294 --> 01:20:56.816]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:20:57.016 --> 01:20:58.838]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:20:58.998 --> 01:21:01.320]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:11.072]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:21:11.112 --> 01:21:14.557]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:21:14.597 --> 01:21:17.701]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:26.829]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:21:43.979 --> 01:21:46.301]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:48.583]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:48.683 --> 01:21:51.886]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:56.650]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:01.214]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:01.514 --> 01:22:03.835]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:03.855 --> 01:22:06.376]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:06.736 --> 01:22:09.317]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:17.261]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:17.597 --> 01:22:22.858]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:22.978 --> 01:22:25.799]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:25.839 --> 01:22:29.279]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:29.519 --> 01:22:30.440]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.920]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:32.940]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:43.893]  Pure water.
[01:22:44.213 --> 01:22:46.676]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:49.138]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season?
[01:22:54.964 --> 01:23:00.026]  Well water, chances are that water is contaminated with rust, bacteria, chlorine, and fluoride.
[01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:10.470]  For just pennies a day, Berkey water filters remove dangerous contaminants from both well and city water, is powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, and is great for camping and emergencies.

[01:23:25.976 --> 01:23:28.818]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your planes?
[01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:29.699]  You're the pretender!
[01:24:10.864 --> 01:24:11.548]  Yeah.
[01:24:20.252 --> 01:24:21.052]  Yeah!
[01:24:21.592 --> 01:24:25.354]  So who are you?
[01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.855]  Who are you?
[01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:30.636]  What side of this equation are you on?
[01:24:30.756 --> 01:24:34.998]  We're being bum-rushed by the Pentagon design surveillance grid.
[01:24:35.698 --> 01:24:37.479]  Are we going to recognize it and say no?
[01:24:37.519 --> 01:24:41.200]  Or will we succumb to the high-tech matrix takeover?
[01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:44.382]  Deep inside your soul, folks, you know.
[01:24:45.404 --> 01:24:46.264]  We gotta stand up.
[01:24:47.025 --> 01:24:49.106]  And why don't we just say we're not going along?
[01:24:50.867 --> 01:24:52.808]  What if I say I'm not going along?
[01:24:53.348 --> 01:24:55.309]  What if I say I'm not one of your slaves?
[01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:56.570]  You're the pretender.
[01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.371]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.673]  Let's talk to Paul in California.
[01:25:02.713 --> 01:25:03.654]  You're on the air.
[01:25:03.734 --> 01:25:04.074]  Welcome.
[01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:06.771]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:07.971]  Yes, sir, I can.
[01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:10.052]  Okay, sorry, my phone kind of beeped.
[01:25:10.213 --> 01:25:10.613]  Oh, I understand.
[01:25:10.813 --> 01:25:16.336]  That's what the phone system does, and I don't know why most radio phone systems do that, but you think you're being hung up on, it goes BAH!
[01:25:16.496 --> 01:25:17.097]  when they go to you.
[01:25:17.597 --> 01:25:18.558]  Okay, great, thank you.
[01:25:19.898 --> 01:25:26.122]  I'm Prison Planet subscriber, I've been listening for a little bit, and I appreciate what you and your team are doing, thank you very much.
[01:25:26.923 --> 01:25:28.203]  Well done, yes, thank you.
[01:25:28.404 --> 01:25:31.946]  And I just wanted to let you know, I don't know if you heard, but
[01:25:33.064 --> 01:25:43.284]  I guess BBC's putting out some type of cover story it looks like, saying that poisoning's being ruled out after several cats and dogs ate the dead birds and suffered no illnesses.
[01:25:44.247 --> 01:25:51.490]  And that, uh, that they believe that it's the fireworks that have caused thousands of birds to fall from the sky of Arkansas town over New Year's Eve.
[01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:52.790]  And be pulverized.
[01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:58.952]  And I guess the latest ones to fall out of the sky last night, that was fireworks, too, in the middle of nowhere, uh, in Louisiana.
[01:25:58.972 --> 01:26:03.614]  Uh, again, I would love to believe that fireworks went off.
[01:26:03.754 --> 01:26:04.995]  I was shooting fireworks off.
[01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:10.697]  I drove out to the country, and there were doves and things sitting in trees 50 feet away that just flew off.
[01:26:11.457 --> 01:26:15.339]  I started shooting them off right as dusk hit on New Year's Eve on Friday.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.002]  I do like my fireworks, folks, the mortars and all the rest of them.
[01:26:19.902 --> 01:26:20.843]  And it was a lot of fun.
[01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:24.445]  But, I mean, it's just asinine.
[01:26:24.465 --> 01:26:26.827]  I mean, you don't have 5,000 birds.
[01:26:27.147 --> 01:26:31.670]  Notice how they always play it down, all being pulverized and being found dead.
[01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:33.351]  They were dead when they hit the ground.
[01:26:34.451 --> 01:26:37.534]  I mean, did 5,000 have a heart attack instantly?
[01:26:38.074 --> 01:26:38.355]  No.
[01:26:38.975 --> 01:26:40.196]  That isn't how this works.
[01:26:40.316 --> 01:26:41.177]  It's ridiculous.
[01:26:41.537 --> 01:26:43.158]  And we've not really said it's poisoning.
[01:26:43.599 --> 01:26:46.101]  More and more it looks like some type of magnetic weapon system.
[01:26:47.482 --> 01:26:50.804]  Or maybe it was some freak lightning storm.
[01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:52.926]  But where were the houses being hurt?
[01:26:53.006 --> 01:26:54.588]  Where were the trees being destroyed?
[01:26:54.888 --> 01:26:57.370]  I mean, starlings sit in trees at night.
[01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:58.631]  What do you think's going on?
[01:27:00.301 --> 01:27:04.484]  I personally think it's some of that crap that they're spraying up in the air.
[01:27:04.504 --> 01:27:07.306]  I mean like I'm living out here in California and I see that.
[01:27:07.366 --> 01:27:16.271]  I wake up in the morning early at like seven in the morning and I see that in the skies like above where I'm living and I live next to some sort of like larger agriculture area.
[01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.993]  Oh that's another great point you just made.
[01:27:19.053 --> 01:27:26.938]  I mean I tend to think it was some type of weapons test, some type of electromagnetic but I mean we're just you know striking out in the dark here but
[01:27:28.203 --> 01:27:29.584]  A cat is like a human.
[01:27:29.964 --> 01:27:32.425]  Birds are known to not be able to take a lot of toxin.
[01:27:32.465 --> 01:27:33.746]  That's why canary in the coal mine.
[01:27:34.046 --> 01:27:36.487]  That's why they've always used them in laboratories for hundreds of years.
[01:27:36.807 --> 01:27:39.848]  For other gases or chemicals, they'll act weird and fall over dead.
[01:27:40.169 --> 01:27:43.510]  You know, they're very delicate compared to something like a cat or a dog.
[01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:49.293]  I mean, a dog can eat a rotten possum off the highway and come back for seconds and not even get an upset stomach.
[01:27:49.853 --> 01:27:51.954]  You know, a human can't do that.
[01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:59.278]  So just because cats and dogs have had a little bit of a, you know, a meal doesn't mean that there isn't some type of toxin in them.
[01:27:59.479 --> 01:28:01.340]  Chemtrails, electromagnetic, I don't know.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:02.500]  Yeah.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:10.505]  I mean, I've got the mainline reports here about the honeybees and the bumblebees and all sorts of other wildlife, you know, dropping dead.
[01:28:12.379 --> 01:28:19.846]  It's funny because it does say, however, that the person, that she stopped sort of declaring that the mystery is solved by saying further tests.
[01:28:20.664 --> 01:28:24.826]  Yeah, well, I want to know how their organs were liquefied.
[01:28:24.846 --> 01:28:45.576]  I mean, I've shot plenty of dove and quail with a 12-gauge shotgun up in the air, and sometimes if they're close, normally you're shooting one at 50 yards away or 40 yards away or even further, but if you shoot one, say, 20 yards away, say some quail come up, and you hit them with three or four BBs, it doesn't pulverize it, it just shoots holes through them.
[01:28:46.608 --> 01:28:50.277]  It just tears through the meat, through the liver, through the guts, through the gizzard.
[01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:55.790]  I mean, I've shot birds with shotguns over and over again, and then you walk over, if you know what you're doing...
[01:28:56.721 --> 01:29:02.145]  Rip their breast meat out, pull out any BBs, throw the guts and the feathers down.
[01:29:02.405 --> 01:29:09.910]  You'll have a plastic bag with your A1 sauce or your Lee and Perrins Worcestershire with pepper.
[01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:15.133]  And when you get back, you get six or seven or more juicy quail or dove breast.
[01:29:15.494 --> 01:29:16.794]  Boom, they hit the skillet.
[01:29:17.055 --> 01:29:20.457]  Boom, green beans over here, mushrooms, whatever you're doing.
[01:29:20.717 --> 01:29:22.238]  Get the bottle of Jack Daniels out.
[01:29:22.278 --> 01:29:23.099]  Don't do that anymore.
[01:29:23.119 --> 01:29:24.139]  I'm just joking, folks.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.241]  And you know, you're off to Valhalla.
[01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.982]  Look, birds running into each other doesn't liquefy their organs.
[01:29:30.182 --> 01:29:30.502]  Got it?
[01:29:30.822 --> 01:29:33.723]  I've done my own post-mortem autopsies on plenty.
[01:29:34.784 --> 01:29:35.684]  We're on the march.
[01:29:36.184 --> 01:29:37.785]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:38.705 --> 01:29:41.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:48.432]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:49.013]  Number 1.
[01:30:49.673 --> 01:30:52.816]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:53.096 --> 01:30:53.636]  Number 2.
[01:30:53.957 --> 01:30:58.500]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.281]  It's true.
[01:30:59.581 --> 01:31:04.144]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:04.465 --> 01:31:05.005]  Number 3.
[01:31:05.285 --> 01:31:08.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:08.868 --> 01:31:12.571]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:12.771 --> 01:31:13.312]  Number 4.
[01:31:13.572 --> 01:31:15.934]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:16.334 --> 01:31:19.697]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:20.017 --> 01:31:20.218]  Number 5.
[01:31:20.798 --> 01:31:24.721]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:24.942 --> 01:31:29.706]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:29.986 --> 01:31:34.008]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:34.148 --> 01:31:35.729]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.004]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:32:02.764 --> 01:32:05.926]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:32:06.027 --> 01:32:09.769]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:32:12.535 --> 01:32:15.816]  I'm looking for America.
[01:32:15.876 --> 01:32:19.478]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:32:19.678 --> 01:32:22.419]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:22.439 --> 01:32:26.501]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:30.622]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:32:38.493 --> 01:32:43.138]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:32:46.642 --> 01:32:52.208]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:32:52.668 --> 01:32:55.211]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.232 --> 01:33:07.810]  Okay, we're going to Wayne Madsen here in about three minutes, then we're going to go to...
[01:33:09.571 --> 01:33:14.435]  Lucretia, Rashid, Angelo, Thomas, Sonny, and many others.
[01:33:15.055 --> 01:33:16.777]  And Wayne's only with us for one segment.
[01:33:17.177 --> 01:33:19.579]  I wanted to get him to briefly pop in on short notice.
[01:33:19.599 --> 01:33:20.460]  We appreciate him.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:37.534]  WayneMadisonReport.com, formerly with the NSA, syndicated columnist, to give us his breakdown on believing all these new bombings we're seeing, being provocateured, Operation Gladio programs, all these bombings popping up in Europe.
[01:33:38.468 --> 01:33:41.350]  And all these new announcements that the bombings are going to come here.
[01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:50.516]  And we see this on the heels of all these patsies being set up, these low-grade morons that the FBI keeps going out and finding and trying to get to blow up things.
[01:33:50.536 --> 01:33:51.997]  So we'll get Wayne Madsen's take on that.
[01:33:52.798 --> 01:34:02.404]  Also on the Chicago crime machine with Mr. Daley, William Daley, headed, former head of the Commerce Department when Ron Brown got whacked, headed into the
[01:34:04.807 --> 01:34:08.973]  A whole White House operation, chief.
[01:34:09.453 --> 01:34:13.459]  But before we go there, I do everything I can to promote Made in America.
[01:34:13.859 --> 01:34:21.669]  And if Americans would just try to buy American and would seek out American products, we would have some economy left in this globalist system.
[01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:25.971]  They've done everything they can to de-industrialize this country, to make us dependent.
[01:34:26.551 --> 01:34:30.792]  And so, when I heard this song and started promoting it on air, I thought, why not just play it?
[01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:37.813]  And why not promote it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and in the media section of InfoWars.com.
[01:34:38.153 --> 01:34:43.834]  We have American company teams up with country star Mark Wills to keep jobs in America.
[01:34:44.374 --> 01:34:45.575]  And it's a three and a half minute song.
[01:34:45.595 --> 01:34:49.415]  We're going to play it and then go right to Wayne Madsen when breaking information.
[01:34:49.455 --> 01:34:51.336]  But I hope everybody will get this single.
[01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:51.816]  It's free.
[01:34:52.636 --> 01:34:53.877]  And get it to everybody they know.
[01:34:54.237 --> 01:35:00.700]  We need music, whether it's rock and roll or country or classical, to have a political message of liberty.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.161]  And he's a very talented artist.
[01:35:03.221 --> 01:35:06.803]  I mean, I, you know, I promote people like Steve Voss and others.
[01:35:07.804 --> 01:35:08.784]  Or Dave von Kleist.
[01:35:08.824 --> 01:35:15.487]  I mean, this is another patriot promoting the ideas of Made in America.
[01:35:15.768 --> 01:35:18.189]  And this is what needs to be on the country music stations.
[01:35:19.069 --> 01:35:35.336]  uh... you know who claim they're so patriotic this is the type of music people need to hear it's from the album looking for america and the song is looking for america and the mp3 is posted upon info wars dot com uh... right now here it is
[01:35:50.271 --> 01:35:55.938]  I'm chasing down a memory of the way things used to be.
[01:35:56.599 --> 01:36:02.867]  Kids playing underneath an old streetlight, knowing they were safe when they laid down at night.
[01:36:03.387 --> 01:36:06.992]  I'm looking for something I ain't seen in a while.
[01:36:09.768 --> 01:36:30.049]  I'm looking for a factory Where a man can feed his family Not worried about them moving it south Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow I'm looking for America
[01:36:33.971 --> 01:36:37.513]  We're good to go.
[01:36:58.317 --> 01:37:12.022]  I'm searching for an old church steeple Where inside you'll find people Who live their lives unashamed And they ain't afraid to say God's name out loud
[01:37:23.161 --> 01:37:23.701]  We're good.
[01:38:00.069 --> 01:38:02.491]  I'm out here looking for the truth.
[01:38:02.951 --> 01:38:06.473]  A few folks to wave the red, white, and blue.
[01:38:07.053 --> 01:38:09.515]  Still believe freedom isn't free.
[01:38:09.615 --> 01:38:13.857]  And I guess it's up to you and me to find it.
[01:38:15.018 --> 01:38:18.420]  Yeah, we gotta find it.
[01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:25.645]  Cause we're looking for the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:38:25.665 --> 01:38:29.367]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was
[01:38:38.107 --> 01:38:42.849]  Well, that's Mark Wills.
[01:39:05.322 --> 01:39:13.068]  The new release of the song, Looking for America, and that's the type of message we need to see if we're going to get this country back through the popular culture.
[01:39:13.808 --> 01:39:25.477]  And so I just salute Diamond Gusset Jeans for promoting this and posting it on their site and getting behind it and giving away free copies of it when people visit the site and some of the special offers they have to get blue jeans made in America.
[01:39:25.857 --> 01:39:29.520]  And of course, that's gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:45.827]  Okay, I will hold him to the end of the hour, then I'll take calls in that first little segment, and I promise I'll take calls while Kaiser's on for everybody that's holding, because I want to get to everybody, but there's so much news to cover in the 21 minutes we've got left of this hour with Wayne Madsen.
[01:39:46.127 --> 01:39:47.608]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:50.629]  Our sites, of course, are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:59.335]  Between 85 and 99, Madsen held a series of jobs, first working for RCA as a government consultant and contractor for the National Security Agency.
[01:39:59.655 --> 01:40:02.798]  Later, he worked for the Navy's Naval Defense Automation Command.
[01:40:02.818 --> 01:40:05.219]  He actually hunted down submarines.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:12.785]  As a civilian employee after this, Madsen briefly established his own consulting firm, then worked for the National Bureau of Standards, and later for the State Department.
[01:40:13.365 --> 01:40:16.507]  In 1990, he joined the CSC, working in 1990 until 1997.
[01:40:17.828 --> 01:40:20.390]  Where he joined the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:21.031]  Great folks.
[01:40:21.371 --> 01:40:25.074]  As a senior fellow in late January 2005, Madsen left EPIC.
[01:40:26.215 --> 01:40:30.939]  And again, he just has written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.143]  And we appreciate him joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:40:35.183 --> 01:40:37.465]  But let me before we get into Operation Gladio.
[01:40:37.805 --> 01:40:41.008]  Gladio reprised more false flag operations.
[01:40:41.529 --> 01:40:44.251]  Everybody's really upset about the Byrd situation.
[01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:45.152]  Now they're finding
[01:40:45.612 --> 01:40:48.654]  A whole bunch more dead in Louisiana, not just in BB, Arkansas.
[01:40:49.134 --> 01:40:59.400]  The issue here is, as a bird hunter who's shot plenty of dove and quail, you shoot them with a shotgun, the pellets don't pulverize their flesh and liquefy their organs.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.841]  They say they're disease-free.
[01:41:02.221 --> 01:41:04.823]  This looks like some type of weird government test or something.
[01:41:05.403 --> 01:41:11.006]  Or, what else could it be, Wayne Madsen, from your wide, well-read brain?
[01:41:11.346 --> 01:41:12.547]  What's your gut on this, Wayne?
[01:41:13.194 --> 01:41:14.755]  Well, two things come to mind.
[01:41:14.975 --> 01:41:26.262]  We know that that particular part of Arkansas, very close by in Guy, Arkansas, has experienced a number of earthquakes, what they call an earthquake storm.
[01:41:26.662 --> 01:41:30.325]  We also know that a lot of migratory birds use
[01:41:30.985 --> 01:41:31.685]  We're good to go.
[01:41:51.153 --> 01:41:51.593]  We're good to go.
[01:42:12.525 --> 01:42:19.452]  So, the other thing is the drumfish, again, they are very susceptible to sound.
[01:42:19.492 --> 01:42:20.753]  They use sound, of course.
[01:42:20.853 --> 01:42:26.578]  So they're very susceptible to any kind of frequency.
[01:42:27.379 --> 01:42:31.923]  So I think there's obviously more to the story, and I'm not a scientist.
[01:42:31.943 --> 01:42:35.606]  I don't want to pretend that I am one, but I'm really not buying
[01:42:35.646 --> 01:42:42.771]  But you did deal with sonar in the Navy, and I mean, I'm a layman myself, but I know they don't just have the sound cannons.
[01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:48.995]  The military admits they've developed high-powered acoustic weapons that can literally shatter steel buildings.
[01:42:49.015 --> 01:42:55.379]  I mean, we're talking super-type weapons, or we know that when there have been earthquakes, it can even create...
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.181]  Bizarre fields that are even more powerful.
[01:43:00.442 --> 01:43:01.622]  So there's no telling here.
[01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:05.263]  It's just people are really wanting to know.
[01:43:05.343 --> 01:43:19.849]  But going back to these buoys they set up all over the world, and the correlation of beached whales and other marine mammals, whenever the Navy and other navies have done these high-powered ping tests, we know that
[01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:27.821]  Whales communicate over thousands of miles and now can't because there's so much acoustical pollution in the ocean.
[01:43:29.063 --> 01:43:30.705]  Is that an interesting line to follow as well?
[01:43:31.610 --> 01:43:50.454]  Well, yes, and of course, and again with earthquakes, of course, they will affect sound transmission, they will cause sound transmission, low frequency transmission in the ocean, and we've had a huge number of earthquakes reported just in the last
[01:43:51.254 --> 01:43:52.295]  We're good to go.
[01:44:21.175 --> 01:44:24.197]  Well, I'm glad you brought up the earthquake issue because that's where I was going next.
[01:44:24.217 --> 01:44:27.679]  Then we'll shift gears into the Gladio situation.
[01:44:28.539 --> 01:44:33.502]  Is the new Madrid fault earthquake zone coming to life?
[01:44:33.522 --> 01:44:43.068]  The American Dream blog wrote this up and links to a whole bunch of mainstream news articles that there are having all sorts of earthquakes all over the Midwest and onto the East Coast.
[01:44:43.108 --> 01:44:44.709]  And of course, for those that don't know,
[01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:56.978]  Just since the colonies have been colonized just the last 300 years the Mississippi River is what changed course twice that I know of in some cases by many miles after huge mega earthquakes.
[01:44:57.479 --> 01:45:02.903]  Imagine what a big earthquake would do to the Mississippi if that fault line becomes active again.
[01:45:02.923 --> 01:45:05.064]  I mean where I live in Austin has three
[01:45:06.205 --> 01:45:09.366]  Extinct, some argue dormant, volcanoes.
[01:45:09.426 --> 01:45:11.246]  I mean, this country is covered.
[01:45:11.326 --> 01:45:15.747]  We know the big super caldera that is Yellowstone has become very active again.
[01:45:16.347 --> 01:45:26.969]  So certainly, I think your point about the earthquakes, they've measured more than 500 earthquakes, some as high as 3.8 magnitude in places like Indiana.
[01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:29.890]  And it all seems to be building.
[01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:34.091]  So that would add more weight to what you're saying.
[01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:55.221]  Right, and the EU Commission actually came out with a statement last week saying that 2010 was a record year for quakes, and the Austrian government said that they had 50 registered in Austria, 10 in Tyrol province itself, and that was a record too.
[01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:59.763]  So we have European governments and institutions talking about
[01:46:00.444 --> 01:46:01.505]  This is not normal.
[01:46:01.745 --> 01:46:14.663]  The USGS on the other hand, the US Geological Survey, is always saying, oh, this is quite normal, when in fact, it is not normal, and we have the EU and Austria backing up the fact that it's just not normal.
[01:46:15.225 --> 01:46:19.187]  Sure, and investigators again are puzzled in Louisiana over bird deaths as well.
[01:46:19.567 --> 01:46:22.269]  That's up on InfoWars.com from TheAdvocate.com.
[01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:35.036]  Okay, Wayne, in the time we've got left, I really pay attention to everything you say, but I really pay attention when you start talking about Gladio, and we've got your report up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:39.718]  Gladio reprised more false flag operations.
[01:46:40.078 --> 01:46:42.360]  Why don't you briefly fill folks in on Gladio?
[01:46:43.487 --> 01:46:54.573]  And then, that's what I thought seeing these latest events, that it mirrors what we saw with Gladio in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, always rearing its head during political tumult.
[01:46:55.553 --> 01:47:02.337]  Well, Gladio was a CIA operation which actually used a lot of the assets of the Galen organization.
[01:47:02.377 --> 01:47:09.220]  Now, Reinhard Galen was a Gestapo officer in Hitler's secret police.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.581]  He was used by the CIA after
[01:47:12.942 --> 01:47:17.748]  World War II to help set up what were known as stay behind networks.
[01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:30.604]  In the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe, there would be these units, these cells that would have access to buried or hidden away caches of weapons and ammunition.
[01:47:31.204 --> 01:47:35.805]  To do guerrilla attacks on Soviet occupying forces.
[01:47:36.425 --> 01:47:50.047]  These not only existed in NATO countries, but also, more interestingly, in neutral countries like Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and a few others, Spain, before it joined NATO, and a few others.
[01:47:50.467 --> 01:47:58.989]  So, what happened in the 70s and 80s was we saw, with the rise of leftist
[01:48:00.090 --> 01:48:15.059]  Activists in Europe, there were false flag attacks done by Gladio units that had access to these weapons that were then blamed on the Red Brigades of Italy, the Red Army Faction in Germany.
[01:48:15.179 --> 01:48:20.523]  They kidnapped and assassinated former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro.
[01:48:20.603 --> 01:48:25.966]  That was blamed on the left when, in fact, it looks like that was carried out by these Gladio units.
[01:48:26.046 --> 01:48:26.627]  Also, there was a
[01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:28.088]  I think?
[01:48:41.773 --> 01:49:06.407]  The boogeyman of the Islamist jihadis is kind of fading, although we see roundups, but we've heard the Italian police commander say these recent bombings at embassies, or attempted bombings at embassies in Rome and similar bombings in Athens of embassies, are being carried out by a network of anarchists throughout Europe.
[01:49:06.767 --> 01:49:09.729]  That sounds amazingly like the charges we
[01:49:10.369 --> 01:49:22.553]  I heard from Denmark when they rounded up five people, they claim were trying to blow up a newspaper office in Copenhagen, that this was a pan-European network.
[01:49:22.613 --> 01:49:33.537]  I think with the impending general strikes and street demonstrations in Europe coming up this year on the austerity programs, the budget cuts, the pension cuts,
[01:49:34.558 --> 01:49:46.185]  We're seeing the bankers and the oligarchs in Europe trying to now link the left movement, the workers and students movement, to the jihadists.
[01:49:46.465 --> 01:50:03.537]  And we're going to see a full court press to try to link those two organizations and go after people who are out in the streets rightfully and justifiably protesting what the bankers have done to these various economies.
[01:50:05.014 --> 01:50:05.835]  Very well said.
[01:50:05.875 --> 01:50:06.775]  I mean, it's classic.
[01:50:06.815 --> 01:50:11.698]  And we see Gladio raising its ugly head really based on the NATO option.
[01:50:11.718 --> 01:50:15.081]  Gladio, as you mentioned, got its name because that was the one area that went public.
[01:50:15.361 --> 01:50:17.122]  The head of Italian intelligence went public.
[01:50:17.142 --> 01:50:18.683]  Later, the Italian president went public.
[01:50:19.183 --> 01:50:23.206]  That the CIA and NATO were in there blowing up school buses, trains, you name it.
[01:50:23.446 --> 01:50:29.610]  They love killing kids, but then blame it on whoever their political enemies were who were becoming politically popular.
[01:50:29.911 --> 01:50:31.892]  Well, now you got all these people mad at the big banks.
[01:50:32.472 --> 01:50:34.614]  So suddenly there's all these bombs going off.
[01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:36.316]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:36.336 --> 01:50:40.721]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:50:40.741 --> 01:50:42.564]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:50:53.317 --> 01:50:56.119]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:50:56.499 --> 01:50:56.899]  It's true.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:59.561]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:01.583]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:02.083 --> 01:51:06.786]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:07.307 --> 01:51:09.228]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:09.628 --> 01:51:14.231]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:14.431 --> 01:51:15.272]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:15.532 --> 01:51:21.875]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:22.215 --> 01:51:25.056]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:25.397 --> 01:51:27.297]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:27.618 --> 01:51:28.558]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:28.578 --> 01:51:28.778]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:28.818 --> 01:51:31.699]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.940]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.105 --> 01:51:44.445]  Hello.
[01:51:44.785 --> 01:51:49.186]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.

[01:51:54.327 --> 01:51:59.149]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:51:59.329 --> 01:52:04.210]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:05.470]  Boy, was I wrong.
[01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:08.771]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[01:52:08.931 --> 01:52:12.733]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[01:52:12.773 --> 01:52:15.755]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:16.375]  Wow!
[01:52:16.536 --> 01:52:17.796]  I watched the DVD last night.
[01:52:18.076 --> 01:52:19.157]  I was awestruck.
[01:52:19.277 --> 01:52:20.798]  What wonderful work you have done.
[01:52:20.978 --> 01:52:23.179]  This information can bless many people.

[01:53:51.792 --> 01:53:54.576]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:56.239 --> 01:53:57.601]  Alright, in closing, Wayne.
[01:53:58.914 --> 01:54:11.780]  How do you, how do we respond to the tried and trusted false flag attack that the Russians engage in, the Chinese, the British, Israel, the U.S.?
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:14.642]  I mean, this is a tool used by governments.
[01:54:14.722 --> 01:54:17.543]  It's been leaked and declassified literally hundreds of times.
[01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:20.745]  Some of the public still says governments would never do that.
[01:54:20.865 --> 01:54:23.028]  Yes, they'd inject foster children with syphilis.
[01:54:23.468 --> 01:54:25.431]  Yes, they'd radiate foster children.
[01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:27.213]  But they wouldn't do that.
[01:54:27.433 --> 01:54:29.416]  No, these are good people in government.
[01:54:30.016 --> 01:54:33.561]  I mean, what do you do, just attack the lie of terror?
[01:54:34.262 --> 01:54:35.804]  Okay, let's say the terror is real.
[01:54:35.884 --> 01:54:38.006]  Don't take my rights, I'll take my chances.
[01:54:38.367 --> 01:54:39.488]  I mean, is that the answer?
[01:54:40.249 --> 01:54:48.911]  It's this nanny state now of everything must be surveilled by our great protectors, but we have a better chance of dying from a bee sting every year than dying from terrorists.
[01:54:48.931 --> 01:55:03.955]  I mean, how do we respond, A, to things like staged terror, Gladio, and B, what does it signify that they're really heating this up in Europe and now we're seeing these kind of abortive, patsy failure operations here in the U.S.? ?
[01:55:04.761 --> 01:55:06.983]  Well, I think it takes critical thinking.
[01:55:07.844 --> 01:55:24.139]  There's really not a whole lot of ways to avoid the 24-7 news channels, but when they report something like this incident in Denmark, where rounding up these guys, one guy was actually innocent, he was released, because all he did was rent an apartment to some of these other guys.
[01:55:24.159 --> 01:55:29.464]  But when you see a guy like the Danish head of police intelligence,
[01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:30.564]  I think so.
[01:55:47.032 --> 01:55:47.513]  We're good to go.
[01:56:04.292 --> 01:56:05.432]  Well, that's the other issue.
[01:56:05.512 --> 01:56:08.954]  I mean, we learned in the Madrid bombings six, seven years ago.
[01:56:09.014 --> 01:56:12.555]  It came out in their news that intelligence agencies were involved.
[01:56:12.615 --> 01:56:14.536]  It came out in the 7-7 event.
[01:56:14.576 --> 01:56:18.698]  I mean, it just always comes out, but that's after the news cycle is over.
[01:56:19.078 --> 01:56:27.081]  It's a footnote that it's the intelligence agencies running it, and they may burn some drug addict, you know, Patsy occasionally, but that's it.
[01:56:27.853 --> 01:56:42.381]  And when people start hearing about anarchists doing responsible terrorist attacks in Europe and maybe here, remember, there were police caught changing in and out of the black guard that anarchists wear at the D20 and G8 conferences.
[01:56:42.401 --> 01:56:45.262]  They were the ones who were throwing the blitz through the stars.
[01:56:45.282 --> 01:56:47.423]  They've been caught in Denver, Canada.
[01:56:47.463 --> 01:56:49.284]  They've been caught in Toronto.
[01:56:49.504 --> 01:56:50.965]  They've been caught in Greece.
[01:56:51.045 --> 01:56:52.246]  I mean, they get caught everywhere.
[01:56:52.686 --> 01:56:53.607]  This is their MO.
[01:56:53.687 --> 01:56:55.868]  And also, when you hear of a new group
[01:56:56.568 --> 01:57:01.552]  claiming responsibility as we heard in Italy that no one's ever heard of before.
[01:57:01.972 --> 01:57:16.862]  Just think, it's another fakery organization, just like this quote-unquote Al-Qaeda and all of its McDonnell-like franchises that have now opened up around the world, North Africa, Arabian Peninsula.
[01:57:16.882 --> 01:57:24.247]  You've got Anwar al-Awlaki, you've got Gaddan, all of these guys are admitted government spooks.
[01:57:25.007 --> 01:57:45.772]  Absolutely, and we heard that the Spanish police intelligence guy, Sharve, basically trying to link what happened in Denmark to David Hedley, who was accused of being behind the Mumbai attacks, and now it turns out Hedley was working for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA.
[01:57:46.152 --> 01:57:55.519]  And by the way, the BBC is reporting that the police told everybody to evacuate and get away from the church that got bombed in Egypt.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:58.462]  We're not saying there aren't real Muslim terrorists, but they're very rare.
[01:57:58.482 --> 01:58:01.844]  It's like finding a leprechaun, you know, in your backyard.
[01:58:01.864 --> 01:58:08.549]  I mean, some of these people do exist, but in every case we see, it's always intelligence with its hands all over it.
[01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:11.332]  Same thing, same thing in Egypt, Wayne.
[01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:13.011]  Absolutely.
[01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:20.057]  And Egypt is another example, and there'll be, unfortunately, many more in the Middle East here... Hold on, this is too important.
[01:58:20.077 --> 01:58:22.699]  We gotta do five more minutes, and I promise I'll get to your calls, too.
[01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:23.239]  Stay there.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.862]  This is important.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:37.581]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:42.942]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:43.302 --> 01:58:45.063]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:58:45.363 --> 01:58:50.164]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:50.364 --> 01:58:51.325]  How much do you want?
[01:58:51.545 --> 01:58:52.285]  When do you want it?
[01:58:52.665 --> 01:58:54.266]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:58:54.546 --> 01:58:55.366]  When will you need it?
[01:58:55.626 --> 01:58:57.687]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:58:57.827 --> 01:58:58.807]  Will there be any food?
[01:58:59.147 --> 01:59:03.072]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:59:03.232 --> 01:59:05.755]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:05.955 --> 01:59:09.139]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:09.539 --> 01:59:13.044]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:13.364 --> 01:59:14.345]  How much will you need?
[01:59:14.585 --> 01:59:15.206]  We don't know.
[01:59:15.506 --> 01:59:16.408]  How much do you want?
[01:59:16.608 --> 01:59:17.329]  All you can get.
[01:59:17.349 --> 01:59:18.350]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:21.372]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:21.652 --> 01:59:22.012]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[01:59:23.853 --> 01:59:24.854]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:24.874 --> 01:59:26.034]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:26.074 --> 01:59:27.895]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:49.011 --> 01:59:53.233]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:59:53.833 --> 01:59:54.654]  You want answers?
[01:59:55.434 --> 01:59:56.375]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:56.975 --> 02:00:00.557]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.157 --> 02:00:05.259]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.199 --> 02:00:19.502]  Wayne Madsen of the Wayne Madsen Report.
[02:00:19.542 --> 02:00:20.963]  I want you to continue here.
[02:00:20.983 --> 02:00:25.428]  We've got your detailed report up at PrisonPlanet.com linking over to WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:00:25.828 --> 02:00:31.534]  Gladio reprised more false flag operations and the fact that
[02:00:32.395 --> 02:00:33.436]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:00:33.616 --> 02:00:41.585]  I'm a lot less scared of Muslims that are xenophobic and want to control their country and want people out.
[02:00:41.705 --> 02:00:50.814]  I know Christians have gotten along by and large with Muslims, so have Jews, except for during the Crusades and then in some of the more modern times, on average.
[02:00:50.834 --> 02:00:52.276]  That's an oversimplification, Wayne.
[02:00:54.699 --> 02:00:57.623]  I know that, again, it's out in the open.
[02:00:57.643 --> 02:01:00.908]  In fact, I need to pull the mainstream news article up.
[02:01:00.948 --> 02:01:02.170]  I'll do a search while you're talking.
[02:01:02.871 --> 02:01:09.200]  That the police in Egypt got everybody back, said get away from this Christian church before it got bombed.
[02:01:09.821 --> 02:01:11.243]  And it's just always the same.
[02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.163]  They always know.
[02:01:12.204 --> 02:01:13.825]  They always give warnings to insiders.
[02:01:14.226 --> 02:01:16.568]  Oklahoma City, first World Trade Center attack.
[02:01:16.948 --> 02:01:19.010]  Second World Trade Center attack on 9-11.
[02:01:19.331 --> 02:01:24.776]  And we see, as the whole world politically gets angry, the state's fingerprints all over these events.
[02:01:25.157 --> 02:01:27.179]  And now these internal warnings getting leaked.
[02:01:27.699 --> 02:01:39.351]  And even USA Today is hyping it that this year we're going to see massive truck bombs and terrorists and the head of the Justice Department says he loses sleep at night with domestic groups.
[02:01:39.451 --> 02:01:39.751]  Why?
[02:01:40.111 --> 02:01:49.481]  The militias are going to link up with Adam Gadahn and al-Awlaki and we've just got to go after the American people because they're now with the Muslim extremists.
[02:01:50.253 --> 02:02:07.145]  Well, one important thing is, the one measuring stick I use, anytime you see a wolf blitzer hyping a story like he did on the bombing in the church in Alexandria, Egypt, that usually tells me, because I know who he really works for, that tells me what's behind a lot of this.
[02:02:07.485 --> 02:02:18.133]  That was a remotely controlled car bomb that went off in Alexandria, and on Al Jazeera, they had a Middle Eastern journalist saying, this is new for Egypt, they haven't had a history of this.
[02:02:18.593 --> 02:02:42.362]  Not like they have in Lebanon, but remotely controlled car bombs are a telltale sign of particular intelligence agencies, and I would point out that what we saw in Egypt has now exacerbated tensions between the 10% Catholic Christian community and the 90% Muslim community in a country
[02:02:42.942 --> 02:02:46.963]  They've had problems in the past, but now it's really reached a crescendo.
[02:02:47.544 --> 02:02:51.145]  So, who benefits by this strife in Egypt?
[02:02:52.045 --> 02:03:00.408]  The Egyptians are saying that it is foreigners responsible, but they have not said Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:00.948 --> 02:03:03.691]  They haven't really pinpointed it, but they've said foreigners.
[02:03:04.271 --> 02:03:07.515]  That doesn't say it was necessarily jihadists.
[02:03:07.735 --> 02:03:15.622]  And notice, exactly, and notice just like with 9-11, we were shown old videos of Palestinians celebrating something.
[02:03:15.943 --> 02:03:17.805]  That was later confirmed to have been staged.
[02:03:18.425 --> 02:03:26.194]  Magically, there's video of a rent-a-mob, you know, celebrating the attack on the church right on time.
[02:03:26.515 --> 02:03:30.940]  This has all the makings of some type of Hollywood scripted situation.
[02:03:31.716 --> 02:03:38.983]  Absolutely, so I think we're going to see, we've also had the bombings of churches in Baghdad as well.
[02:03:39.463 --> 02:03:50.554]  I think it's the same type of scenario being played out there to exacerbate tensions we already had between the Shias and Sunnis in Iraq and now we have them with the Iranians.
[02:03:50.714 --> 02:03:54.698]  I've had Ray McGovern, the former top briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[02:03:54.738 --> 02:04:02.385]  talk about how our government blew up the Golden Mosque in Iraq to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[02:04:02.425 --> 02:04:03.306]  I mean, they've been caught.
[02:04:03.366 --> 02:04:13.255]  British MI6, as you know, Special Air Services arm, got caught dressed up like Sunnis running around shooting and killing Shiites.
[02:04:13.868 --> 02:04:15.089]  Same thing in Pakistan.
[02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:18.670]  We've seen the same thing play out there, where U.S.
[02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:22.652]  intelligence has been behind some of the attacks in that country as well.
[02:04:23.133 --> 02:04:26.054]  So this is pretty standard operating procedure these days.
[02:04:26.114 --> 02:04:29.956]  So it signifies things are really heating up, that suddenly this stuff's popping up everywhere?
[02:04:30.696 --> 02:04:31.297]  Absolutely.
[02:04:31.597 --> 02:04:32.577]  All right, Wayne Madsen.
[02:04:33.258 --> 02:04:36.079]  I guess it's pointing towards Iran, possibly, an attack there?
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.120]  Could be.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:39.921]  We never know when that's going to come.
[02:04:39.941 --> 02:04:40.521]  I hear you.
[02:04:40.842 --> 02:04:41.262]  I hear you.
[02:04:41.562 --> 02:04:42.582]  Wayne, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:04:42.602 --> 02:04:43.263]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:04:44.381 --> 02:04:45.522]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:04:45.562 --> 02:04:52.226]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:04:52.486 --> 02:04:54.767]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:04:55.028 --> 02:05:00.231]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:00.411 --> 02:05:03.192]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:03.453 --> 02:05:05.514]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:05.774 --> 02:05:11.698]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:12.018 --> 02:05:15.220]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:20.924]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:21.184 --> 02:05:22.485]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:22.825 --> 02:05:24.026]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:24.126 --> 02:05:26.667]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:26.788 --> 02:05:30.830]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:32.731]  You can find the video at www.
[02:05:33.812 --> 02:05:35.513]  End of America 3.com.

[02:06:43.459 --> 02:06:47.682]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:48.002 --> 02:06:48.282]  Number 1.
[02:06:48.922 --> 02:06:52.084]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:52.345 --> 02:06:52.905]  Number 2.
[02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:57.768]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:58.088 --> 02:06:58.549]  It's true.
[02:06:58.849 --> 02:07:03.392]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:03.712 --> 02:07:04.252]  Number 3.
[02:07:04.532 --> 02:07:07.814]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:08.115 --> 02:07:11.817]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:12.017 --> 02:07:12.578]  Number 4.
[02:07:12.818 --> 02:07:15.180]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:15.581 --> 02:07:18.964]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:19.265 --> 02:07:19.485]  Number 5.
[02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:23.970]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:24.210 --> 02:07:28.975]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:40.086 --> 02:07:49.476]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:49.796 --> 02:07:52.098]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:07.278 --> 02:08:14.847]  Well, we were unable to make connection to Max Keiser over in Europe last Friday, but we've got him today for the next 52 minutes.
[02:08:14.947 --> 02:08:21.374]  I promise for all the callers that are holding, we'll go to your calls early in the hour, then continue discussions into the end of the hour.
[02:08:21.914 --> 02:08:25.316]  Who knows, maybe even go into overdrive today with Max Keiser.
[02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:26.637]  Always great to have him on.
[02:08:27.418 --> 02:08:29.299]  We've got so many things to talk about.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:40.107]  We've got William M. Daley, former head of the Commerce Department under Clinton, with the mysterious death of Ron Brown, now to go in and head up the White House operations for Obama.
[02:08:40.407 --> 02:08:41.668]  Talk about influence peddling.
[02:08:42.309 --> 02:08:48.033]  And we've got Obama announcing that he's going to use executive authority to do whatever he wants in the country.
[02:08:48.873 --> 02:08:50.515]  So expanding things that Bush did.
[02:08:51.375 --> 02:08:53.977]  There's a lot of other important news we're going to be covering.
[02:08:53.997 --> 02:08:56.339]  The incredible explosion of silver and gold.
[02:08:57.099 --> 02:08:59.701]  Get Max Keiser's view of what's headed into the new year.
[02:09:00.782 --> 02:09:10.709]  We've got all these other announcements that are coming out showing more and more very serious storm clouds on the horizon.
[02:09:10.769 --> 02:09:14.292]  A lot of amazing police state developments that I haven't gotten to.
[02:09:14.612 --> 02:09:17.334]  Court OK searches of cell phones without warrant.
[02:09:18.311 --> 02:09:26.783]  And now the TSA is grabbing people's phones, downloading stuff off of them, their computers without a warrant, they're copying people's credit cards.
[02:09:27.525 --> 02:09:31.651]  But now the police are saying they can just do this to citizens.
[02:09:34.656 --> 02:09:36.237]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:09:36.257 --> 02:09:40.259]  I mean, your cell phone is your little computer, your little personal computer.
[02:09:40.819 --> 02:09:47.542]  And so they're saying that when the police arrest you, and you're taken into custody, they don't even need a warrant for that.
[02:09:47.583 --> 02:09:49.123]  I mean, this is really crazy.
[02:09:49.523 --> 02:09:51.004]  I mean, folks, this is bonafide.
[02:09:51.024 --> 02:09:53.586]  They're getting rid of the bedrock of the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:53.626 --> 02:09:58.028]  First they told you it was for Al Qaeda down the road, and now they say, no, it's for you, the American people.
[02:09:58.908 --> 02:10:01.229]  An iron curtain of tyranny is ascending around the world.
[02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:03.651]  I want to get into all the mysterious,
[02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:11.396]  Our last guest, Wayne Madsen, was saying it's clearly inside job terror attacks in Europe and the Middle East and all the evidence is there.
[02:10:11.997 --> 02:10:15.581]  But first off, Max, what do you think about the bird mystery?
[02:10:17.463 --> 02:10:18.424]  Microwaves?
[02:10:19.485 --> 02:10:20.266]  Fireworks?
[02:10:20.867 --> 02:10:21.768]  Secret weapons?
[02:10:23.409 --> 02:10:25.812]  What liquefies the innards of 5,000 birds, Max Keiser?
[02:10:28.476 --> 02:10:31.338]  Well, why ask about these birds right off the bat, man?
[02:10:31.358 --> 02:10:34.701]  I mean, you know, there's a lot happening in the banking sector.
[02:10:34.721 --> 02:10:38.784]  You know, the birds... Are the birds for the birds?
[02:10:39.145 --> 02:10:41.346]  Are the birds... The bees are all dying off.
[02:10:41.446 --> 02:10:44.189]  Remember a couple of years ago, the bees started dying.
[02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:46.230]  There's another huge die-off of bees.
[02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:51.955]  Bees without bees, there's no agriculture, there's no food, and then you have to rely on people like Monsanto.
[02:10:52.375 --> 02:10:54.117]  Birds are dying, the fish are dying.
[02:10:54.817 --> 02:10:56.758]  It's industrialization gone crazy.
[02:10:56.838 --> 02:10:57.578]  It's pollution.
[02:10:57.798 --> 02:11:03.440]  It's killing the natural habitat and it's causing premature human extinction.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.760]  That's been the trend.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:16.324]  So, yeah, the natural world can only take so much pollution and then it starts to die off, despite what some new members of Congress might feel is written in some ancient text.
[02:11:17.104 --> 02:11:23.986]  If you put a certain amount of garbage into the planet's ecosystem, you will kill the ecosystem.
[02:11:24.824 --> 02:11:37.534]  Well, Max, I agree with you on that, but we're told put a tax on what plants breathe, and in the history of this planet, they know that carbon dioxide has been many, many, many times
[02:11:39.403 --> 02:11:40.563]  Higher than it is now.
[02:11:41.064 --> 02:12:02.992]  Why do they focus on paying taxes to Al Gore and the UN instead of open-air genetic engineering, the German government studies connected to BT corn killing the bees, the electromagnetic studies out of Europe and even the US and Canada, that the electromagnetics are killing trees and grass nearby, retarding their growth.
[02:12:05.053 --> 02:12:10.542]  My problem is government isn't focused on anything that's actually causing problems.
[02:12:10.983 --> 02:12:12.766]  They just want to tax what I exhaled.
[02:12:14.373 --> 02:12:22.803]  Yeah, the response to this problem, you've got two responses, taxes and carbon trading in the area of carbon emissions.
[02:12:23.283 --> 02:12:35.417]  Now, the problem with taxes, as you point out, is if it's going to be controlled by the same corrupt government, then we have no expectation that they would do any better job at collecting any kind of tax in any reasonable way.
[02:12:35.977 --> 02:12:36.818]  Related to anything.
[02:12:37.158 --> 02:12:40.639]  As far as carbon trading goes, well, that goes to Wall Street.
[02:12:40.739 --> 02:12:49.103]  And Wall Street is going to use it as a scam to pocket themselves billions of dollars and destroy that market as well.
[02:12:49.384 --> 02:12:51.425]  Just like they destroyed every other market.
[02:12:51.965 --> 02:12:55.827]  And just like they're destroying what's coming on with Facebook.
[02:12:55.847 --> 02:12:59.208]  I don't know if you saw the news with Facebook, but they just did a deal with Goldman Sachs.
[02:12:59.268 --> 02:13:01.409]  Goldman Sachs now gets to buy $450 million worth of Facebook.
[02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:05.975]  Totally bypassing the SEC rules and regulations.
[02:13:06.115 --> 02:13:07.637]  They're just breaking the law openly.
[02:13:07.657 --> 02:13:11.102]  The SEC has said we've got to take a closer look at this.
[02:13:11.522 --> 02:13:15.528]  People who follow Wall Street tell you this is completely illegal what they're doing.
[02:13:16.009 --> 02:13:18.853]  They're just allowing folks to cash in on Facebook.
[02:13:19.233 --> 02:13:32.883]  Without giving the public a chance to cash in on Facebook, even though it's the public that has made Facebook the $50 billion company it is by uploading all of their photos and chats and all of the messages that they upload to Facebook.
[02:13:33.143 --> 02:13:35.785]  Well, that's worth $50 billion to Goldman Sachs clients.
[02:13:35.825 --> 02:13:39.868]  How much is it going to get to the people who actually created the value of Facebook?
[02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:41.870]  The public, they get absolutely nothing.
[02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:43.771]  And it's completely illegal.
[02:13:44.291 --> 02:13:55.236]  And don't forget also that Facebook uses Zenga, which is a virtual currency, and Zenga is a new way to load people up with another new wave, another huge wave of death.
[02:13:55.756 --> 02:13:59.538]  So they're going into a whole new virtual world of death.
[02:14:00.038 --> 02:14:12.364]  Just like Monsanto uses seeds to create agricultural debt, Wall Street uses debt to create debt, now you've got Facebook who's gonna use FarmVille and Zynga and virtual currencies to create virtual debt.
[02:14:12.825 --> 02:14:13.445]  Exactly!
[02:14:13.465 --> 02:14:15.206]  Seeds were always a...
[02:14:15.746 --> 02:14:31.695]  Ever-replicating renewable resource, but now Monsanto and two other big giants, as part of an admitted strategic takeover program, make them agents of death that take over and infect the rest of the DNA of the planet, of the biosphere.
[02:14:32.055 --> 02:14:37.878]  Not just mutilating, but irrevocably damaging, and then you've got to buy from them every year.
[02:14:38.038 --> 02:14:40.219]  It doesn't continue the life cycle.
[02:14:40.279 --> 02:14:44.722]  This is blasphemy according to all laws of nature or any religion.
[02:14:45.582 --> 02:14:47.104]  Uh, but where are the Christians?
[02:14:47.344 --> 02:14:50.166]  The Pope is out now promoting GMO.
[02:14:50.566 --> 02:14:51.647]  Now, it's of the Lord.
[02:14:51.667 --> 02:14:57.012]  I mean, this is so devilish, what we see... It is completely devilish.
[02:14:57.032 --> 02:14:59.094]  They monsanto what they call Terminator Seed.
[02:14:59.767 --> 02:15:00.728]  We're good to go.
[02:15:24.641 --> 02:15:28.748]  Blue into the field of a guy who was not growing Monsanto seed.
[02:15:28.969 --> 02:15:37.144]  Monsanto sued him for intellectual property violation because the wind blew their product into his farm without him even knowing about it.
[02:15:38.004 --> 02:15:43.307]  So this is what they're trying to control, the agriculture, the same way the Fed tries to control the money supply with debt.
[02:15:43.888 --> 02:15:48.630]  Monsanto's trying to control the food with Terminator seeds and intellectual property seeds.
[02:15:49.111 --> 02:15:55.654]  And Facebook now wants to control the cyberspace with virtual debt and Zynga-based virtual currency.
[02:15:55.675 --> 02:16:00.778]  Well, I have an analogy, Max, because it is a genetic issue.
[02:16:01.698 --> 02:16:10.865]  Monsanto, which literally owns the courts, has their former heads as the head of the EPA, the head of the FDA.
[02:16:10.885 --> 02:16:12.226]  They've got all the bases covered.
[02:16:12.666 --> 02:16:13.607]  Same thing in Europe.
[02:16:14.328 --> 02:16:21.713]  They get caught smuggling seeds in, and other companies do, into countries as literal military outposts.
[02:16:22.254 --> 02:16:23.895]  And it's the equivalent of this.
[02:16:24.375 --> 02:16:27.197]  They come and plant GMO canola.
[02:16:28.158 --> 02:16:48.789]  Right next to your field or GMO soybeans, whatever the case is, there have been many cases of this, or GMO corn, it blows into your field, they trespass and have planes drop roundup bombs on it, it kills an area, then they fly over and see that a few plants are alive, those were the few
[02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:56.613]  that were Monsanto from seeds getting in, or part of their genetics, and then they come sue you admitting that they infected you.
[02:16:56.633 --> 02:17:10.142]  That'd be like if a man, a next door neighbor, moved in, stalked your wife, raped her, and then when she got pregnant, he comes and demands the baby, saying it's his, instead of going to jail.
[02:17:10.442 --> 02:17:12.103]  That's what Monsanto does.
[02:17:12.679 --> 02:17:15.721]  Right, and they're doing it on an intercontinental basis.
[02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:20.384]  They've totally destroyed large parts of India's agricultural industry.
[02:17:20.444 --> 02:17:32.971]  This is why thousands of Indian farmers have committed suicide, because they are sold Monsanto seeds at the point of a gun, and then when they can't afford to upgrade because the seeds don't reproduce,
[02:17:33.711 --> 02:17:37.534]  And they are heavily in debt, because they have to go in debt to keep buying the seeds.
[02:17:37.574 --> 02:17:43.437]  And by the way, the fertilizer, the genetically modified fertilizer, only works with genetically modified seeds.
[02:17:43.597 --> 02:17:51.242]  So they get you, you have to buy the GM fertilizer, the GM seeds, and of course they go in deeper into debt, and thousands of them are killing themselves.
[02:17:51.702 --> 02:17:57.966]  And this is part of the Monsanto program, is that they're death merchants.
[02:17:58.326 --> 02:17:59.086]  And there are far more
[02:18:01.141 --> 02:18:05.062]  You know, if you do a little experiment, you can do an experiment right now.
[02:18:05.802 --> 02:18:11.624]  You know, they, the Monsanto lawyers are deeply embedded in the internet.
[02:18:11.704 --> 02:18:13.325]  Anytime, anyone can try this.
[02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:18.746]  If you write a blog about Monsanto, you know, they are right on you quickly.
[02:18:19.527 --> 02:18:24.288]  They are much more litigious than Exxon or the energy companies.
[02:18:24.368 --> 02:18:30.150]  They are really, in my opinion, of all the companies I've tracked over the years, they are the absolute worst.
[02:18:32.025 --> 02:18:44.747]  Well, finishing up with Monsanto and these other big GMO companies, if you go back to Henry Kissinger's State Department Memorandum 200, Kissinger said, we'll use food as a weapon.
[02:18:44.767 --> 02:18:46.068]  We'll take over the third world.
[02:18:46.868 --> 02:18:52.329]  And I mean, it's an amazing business model coming out of this coterie of companies.
[02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:54.809]  And I guess that's just the way it is.
[02:18:54.849 --> 02:18:57.030]  We've just got to submit to it and worship them.
[02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:58.110]  And it's wonderful.
[02:18:58.806 --> 02:19:10.913]  Well, it's debt, and of course they go in there with this idea that they're saving farmers and they're making food available, and they get them hooked on these intellectual property protected seeds that they administer like a central bank.
[02:19:10.993 --> 02:19:11.754]  It's a currency.
[02:19:11.814 --> 02:19:15.196]  It's a seed, an agricultural currency, but it's all debt-based.
[02:19:15.616 --> 02:19:17.497]  And so you have agricultural debt, you have
[02:19:17.857 --> 02:19:20.278]  And you predicted that it would be turned into a giant casino gulag.
[02:19:20.298 --> 02:19:23.218]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser with his outlook for this year.
[02:19:23.238 --> 02:19:23.819]  Stay with us.
[02:19:44.753 --> 02:19:45.714]  Go solar for cheap!
[02:19:45.934 --> 02:19:48.075]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?
[02:19:48.395 --> 02:19:53.437]  Now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200 at 123cheapsolar.com.
[02:19:53.637 --> 02:19:54.218]  Don't laugh!
[02:19:54.278 --> 02:19:56.999]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.
[02:19:57.199 --> 02:20:00.340]  Watch the step-by-step videos that even non-handyman types can use.

[02:20:03.942 --> 02:20:03.982]  800-713-0486.
[02:20:04.002 --> 02:20:06.563]  Reduce your foreign oil dependency when you go green with 123cheapsolar.com.
[02:20:14.147 --> 02:20:23.433]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:23.473 --> 02:20:24.214]  This capitalism?
[02:20:24.274 --> 02:20:30.418]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:30.558 --> 02:20:31.379]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:31.419 --> 02:20:34.541]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:20:34.681 --> 02:20:35.441]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:35.461 --> 02:20:36.822]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:20:36.882 --> 02:20:37.162]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:37.202 --> 02:20:37.483]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.487 --> 02:20:46.810]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:49.092]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:20:49.192 --> 02:20:51.915]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:20:52.416 --> 02:20:57.161]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:20:57.501 --> 02:21:01.706]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:02.006 --> 02:21:04.367]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:04.467 --> 02:21:06.889]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:07.249 --> 02:21:09.810]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:10.151 --> 02:21:17.755]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:18.109 --> 02:21:23.371]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:23.491 --> 02:21:26.312]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:26.352 --> 02:21:29.774]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:30.034 --> 02:21:30.934]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:31.094 --> 02:21:32.415]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:32.435 --> 02:21:33.435]  Invisible Empire.

[02:21:43.999 --> 02:21:48.144]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:21:48.184 --> 02:21:49.445]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:49.625 --> 02:21:53.329]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:53.609 --> 02:21:56.152]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:56.352 --> 02:21:58.154]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:58.335 --> 02:22:00.477]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:22:01.658 --> 02:22:10.410]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:22:10.690 --> 02:22:13.875]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:22:13.935 --> 02:22:17.039]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:22:17.239 --> 02:22:19.060]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:22.441]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:22:22.521 --> 02:22:23.101]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:22:23.241 --> 02:22:25.502]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:22:25.562 --> 02:22:26.162]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:22:43.288 --> 02:22:47.510]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:48.451]  Number one.
[02:22:48.751 --> 02:22:51.893]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:52.173 --> 02:22:52.733]  Number two.
[02:22:53.033 --> 02:22:57.596]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:57.916 --> 02:22:58.376]  It's true.
[02:22:58.656 --> 02:23:03.219]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:23:03.519 --> 02:23:04.060]  Number 3.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:07.643]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:23:07.943 --> 02:23:11.686]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:23:11.867 --> 02:23:12.407]  Number 4.
[02:23:12.647 --> 02:23:15.029]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:23:15.410 --> 02:23:18.793]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:23:19.093 --> 02:23:19.313]  Number 5.
[02:23:19.894 --> 02:23:23.817]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:23:24.038 --> 02:23:28.802]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:23:29.082 --> 02:23:33.109]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:23:33.249 --> 02:23:34.811]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:23:35.032 --> 02:23:37.095]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:23:37.295 --> 02:23:39.639]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:23:54.813 --> 02:23:56.574]  Okay, I want to get to your calls.
[02:23:57.775 --> 02:24:00.137]  I want to get into what's happening with the economy.
[02:24:00.818 --> 02:24:07.423]  But let's get Max Keiser's 2011 predictions for the economy.
[02:24:07.983 --> 02:24:08.664]  Max Keiser.
[02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:12.267]  Well, my prediction number one, ah, hell breaks loose.
[02:24:12.287 --> 02:24:14.048]  That's my number one prediction.
[02:24:14.849 --> 02:24:16.530]  Massive chaos everywhere.
[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:19.792]  It's economic chaos and ecological chaos.
[02:24:19.812 --> 02:24:21.514]  What I call the eco-eco
[02:24:22.415 --> 02:24:23.556]  Chaos scenario.
[02:24:23.796 --> 02:24:26.117]  E-E-C-S.
[02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:27.678]  Eco-eco chaos scenario.
[02:24:27.718 --> 02:24:29.059]  And they're feeding on each other.
[02:24:29.079 --> 02:24:42.507]  So like in Australia, because of the massive flooding, their coal industry is collapsing and the economy is going through a gut-wrenching change, which of course is going to force them to do something silly like increase the money supply, which will only cause more
[02:24:42.947 --> 02:24:43.207]  I don't know.
[02:24:59.318 --> 02:25:06.244]  I think, finally, you're going to see the silver shorts get their behinds kicked.
[02:25:06.344 --> 02:25:08.086]  For example, today is a good example.
[02:25:08.306 --> 02:25:10.929]  The price of silver is down 3% or 4%.
[02:25:11.289 --> 02:25:13.832]  But when I'm looking at the exchange-traded funds,
[02:25:14.492 --> 02:25:15.573]  I don't see any volume.
[02:25:15.813 --> 02:25:18.156]  There's nobody actually selling physical silver today.
[02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:21.518]  So where does that price action come from?
[02:25:21.619 --> 02:25:23.160]  It just comes from the paper market.
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:25.262]  Nobody's selling their physical silver today.
[02:25:25.522 --> 02:25:29.626]  They're just loading the boat with more of these naked short sales coming out of Wall Street again.
[02:25:30.226 --> 02:25:36.830]  But I think that this year, this game is going to end, because ultimately, there's a tipping point.
[02:25:37.390 --> 02:25:48.637]  I spoke with David Morgan on my show, Kaiser Report, and he reiterated the point that for every physical ounce of silver you take off the market, you kill 100 paper ounces.
[02:25:49.078 --> 02:25:52.820]  And that leverage is fantastic, and the bank stole
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:58.163]  Our wealth, now it's time to take our wealth back in the form of the silver.
[02:25:58.444 --> 02:26:09.551]  I think that's going to continue to rise in price, and the price rise is tied to how upset people are going to be.
[02:26:09.691 --> 02:26:12.513]  The greater the outrage, the higher the price will go.
[02:26:13.254 --> 02:26:19.518]  House prices look like they're going to another leg down, and interesting now, the commercial real estate
[02:26:20.302 --> 02:26:22.423]  It's going to go through a gut-wrenching decline.
[02:26:22.763 --> 02:26:26.785]  All the malls in America are pretty much empty.
[02:26:27.146 --> 02:26:28.506]  Sears, sales are down.
[02:26:28.786 --> 02:26:30.167]  Walmart, sales are down.
[02:26:30.187 --> 02:26:34.009]  So at the medium to bottom end, retail sales are crashing.
[02:26:34.109 --> 02:26:35.590]  All those malls are empty.
[02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:45.215]  You see some sales progress in the high end in places like Tiffany, because the kleptocrats and the aristocrats, of course, like to buy the occasional bauble.
[02:26:45.595 --> 02:26:49.217]  But for the mass consumer out there, sales are definitely down.
[02:26:54.610 --> 02:26:56.033]  Well, I have to agree with you.
[02:26:56.053 --> 02:27:03.885]  I mean, it's mathematically impossible right now to ever be able to pay back the
[02:27:05.975 --> 02:27:08.217]  1.5 quadrillion in false derivatives.
[02:27:08.657 --> 02:27:10.298]  But you can see what the system's doing.
[02:27:10.318 --> 02:27:12.639]  They're setting up a police state to politically suppress us.
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:19.904]  They have announced, and I have that report here, that they are starting to seize all or part of pension funds in Europe.
[02:27:19.944 --> 02:27:21.044]  That's the headline.
[02:27:21.645 --> 02:27:24.767]  I mean, and we know Europe's just a few years ahead of where we're at.
[02:27:25.387 --> 02:27:45.224]  And Max, I've got to rib you a little bit, but I know it's tongue-in-cheek a bit, but you live in France, because you don't like the police state here, but Europe is basically owned by the cousins of the people, so to speak, that own this country, the same ilk of kleptocratic mafia.
[02:27:46.085 --> 02:27:49.108]  And so we're all getting our goose cooked here.
[02:27:49.448 --> 02:27:51.890]  But how much will the population put up with?
[02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:58.936]  Because people just five years ago would blame a Sarkozy or a Gordon Brown or a George W. Bush or a Barack Obama.
[02:27:59.776 --> 02:28:03.840]  Almost no one now really thinks presidents actually run something.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:12.487]  I mean, doesn't the ruling oligarchy have a problem because they're up there running around like robber barons being pulled around by their white horses in front of everybody?
[02:28:13.567 --> 02:28:23.294]  Well, um, I'm like, as I've been saying on your show for a few months now, when I say, when I attack the U.S., when I say people should leave the U.S., I always talk about Brazil and Chile.
[02:28:23.934 --> 02:28:36.323]  Uh, you know, Brazil and Chile are two countries that are, um, really great opportunity, uh, for people looking for a stable government and real honest-to-goodness opportunities.
[02:28:36.343 --> 02:28:38.665]  Yeah, but can I own a gun to protect myself from kidnapping?
[02:28:39.065 --> 02:28:55.377]  I mean, I know pretty soon we're about to be just like Mexico, basically kidnapping capital, but... Yeah, but I mean, certainly there are, but you know, Brazil is an enormous country and there are cities and towns all over Brazil that are sleepy little towns that, or marginally active towns, that I think offer a greater
[02:28:56.237 --> 02:28:59.438]  I'm telling you, I might move to Brazil if I could have a Barrett 50 Cal, but I can't.
[02:29:24.272 --> 02:29:25.874]  Hey Max, over there in France.
[02:29:26.774 --> 02:29:30.177]  Hey Max, you got a boomstick in there under the pillow.
[02:29:30.197 --> 02:29:30.517]  Stay there.
[02:29:30.537 --> 02:29:31.638]  I want to talk to you about this.
[02:29:32.218 --> 02:29:33.079]  And take phone calls.
[02:29:33.099 --> 02:29:33.519]  Stay with us.
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:35.620]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.141 --> 02:29:37.722]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.663 --> 02:29:41.345]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.603 --> 02:29:49.227]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:29:49.627 --> 02:29:52.631]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:29:52.871 --> 02:29:57.636]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:29:57.656 --> 02:30:03.903]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:04.043 --> 02:30:06.306]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:06.826 --> 02:30:07.106]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:07.126 --> 02:30:07.546]  Bernanke?
[02:30:07.647 --> 02:30:08.247]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:08.327 --> 02:30:09.307]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:09.408 --> 02:30:11.829]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:25.737 --> 02:30:27.558]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:27.578 --> 02:30:32.661]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:33.001 --> 02:30:42.126]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:30:46.069 --> 02:30:49.690]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:58.152]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:58.892 --> 02:31:02.913]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:03.513 --> 02:31:14.335]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:14.955 --> 02:31:23.977]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:24.477 --> 02:31:29.538]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:29.899 --> 02:31:37.080]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:40.141]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:44.093 --> 02:31:45.234]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:45.274 --> 02:31:51.937]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:52.197 --> 02:31:54.478]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:54.739 --> 02:31:59.941]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:00.121 --> 02:32:02.903]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:03.163 --> 02:32:05.224]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:05.484 --> 02:32:11.407]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:11.728 --> 02:32:14.929]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:20.633]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:20.893 --> 02:32:22.194]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:22.534 --> 02:32:23.694]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:26.336]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:26.516 --> 02:32:30.538]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:30.718 --> 02:32:35.200]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:37.801]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:41.622]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:32:41.802 --> 02:32:43.523]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:32:45.244 --> 02:32:50.186]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:32:57.819 --> 02:33:02.787]  Okay, here's what I'm going to do, because I said I'd get to your phone calls and some of you have been holding for like 45 minutes.
[02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:11.982]  We're going to take your phone calls right now on any subject you want, but I know it was earlier for calls for witnesses about the dead and dying wildlife, and this is a big deal.
[02:33:13.254 --> 02:33:19.701]  And then we're going to hold Max Keiser, who's going to ride shotgun with us, at least 30 minutes into the next hour of Super Overdrive.
[02:33:19.721 --> 02:33:21.403]  It's actually just Overdrive.
[02:33:21.423 --> 02:33:23.525]  I guess if we went into a fifth hour, it'd be Super Overdrive.
[02:33:24.145 --> 02:33:24.846]  Rarely do that.
[02:33:24.866 --> 02:33:27.829]  Of course, we did the 27-hour broadcast last year.
[02:33:27.849 --> 02:33:29.731]  I think I'll do one of those again this year.
[02:33:29.791 --> 02:33:30.232]  Maybe two.
[02:33:30.292 --> 02:33:30.933]  That was fun.
[02:33:31.733 --> 02:33:34.617]  But Max Keiser is our guest for at least another hour.
[02:33:35.177 --> 02:33:42.705]  We will continue with your phone calls and a bunch of news and a key video I'm going to play in the last 30 minutes that's extremely powerful.
[02:33:43.787 --> 02:33:46.430]  But I do want to go ahead and get to your calls.
[02:33:46.450 --> 02:33:50.714]  And so without further ado, let's talk to Lucretia in Oregon.
[02:33:50.754 --> 02:33:51.575]  Thank you for holding.
[02:33:52.336 --> 02:33:52.636]  Welcome.
[02:33:53.464 --> 02:33:55.205]  Hey Alex, who am I?
[02:33:55.305 --> 02:33:56.767]  I'm an Infowarrior girl.
[02:33:56.967 --> 02:33:57.747]  Well done.
[02:33:58.488 --> 02:34:09.156]  Yeah, I finally got you on the local radio station KMED here after two years of working hard on the guy that owns the station.
[02:34:09.256 --> 02:34:10.036]  That is awesome!
[02:34:10.056 --> 02:34:12.799]  You know, I was talking to Lisa Lyon, the producer
[02:34:14.159 --> 02:34:15.640]  of Coast to Coast AM.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:18.221]  And she heard me on that station.
[02:34:18.241 --> 02:34:20.402]  That's where, you know, up in her neck of the woods.
[02:34:20.442 --> 02:34:21.882]  And she likes the station.
[02:34:22.443 --> 02:34:23.103]  She listens to it.
[02:34:23.123 --> 02:34:24.423]  We're on several there in Oregon.
[02:34:24.723 --> 02:34:28.545]  Tell folks again the call letters and the frequency of the fine station.
[02:34:29.298 --> 02:34:35.908]  K-M-E-D 1440 and sadly you're on at night so he broadcasts you later 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:34:36.809 --> 02:34:39.453]  Well it's not sad, we're glad to be on weekdays.
[02:34:40.955 --> 02:34:43.659]  And you are on live on Sunday so that's awesome.
[02:34:44.881 --> 02:34:48.102]  I gave them over a hundred of the Obama deceptions to give out.
[02:34:48.162 --> 02:34:49.443]  How is the station liking it?
[02:34:49.463 --> 02:34:59.066]  Because we're on so many new AM and FM's, getting two or three a week that are new, and we're talking about all these hardcore issues, and the stations are loving it.
[02:34:59.546 --> 02:35:07.889]  I mean, but again, ten years ago it was like I was a fourteen-headed, you know, goblin, but now people can see what we're covering is reality.
[02:35:08.689 --> 02:35:09.090]  Absolutely.
[02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:10.770]  I can see the difference in the callers.
[02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:12.031]  They're totally waking up.
[02:35:12.531 --> 02:35:13.171]  It's awesome.
[02:35:13.752 --> 02:35:21.156]  So yeah, I'm totally stoked about that, but I wanted to, you know, you asked about the birds, and so I wanted to cover the four main points.
[02:35:21.337 --> 02:35:24.158]  One is to consider having Lorraine Murray on.
[02:35:24.498 --> 02:35:29.241]  She talks about the dramatic increase in earthquakes since HAARP was put in.
[02:35:29.741 --> 02:35:35.605]  She also, being a whistleblower for Lawrence Livermore, knows about Gordon McDonald, who, as you recall, was
[02:35:36.138 --> 02:35:37.820]  I mean, I have Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97, in fact,
[02:35:51.917 --> 02:35:53.338]  I've got the quote here in my stack.
[02:35:53.378 --> 02:35:55.279]  I'll pull it out if I can find it.
[02:35:55.299 --> 02:35:56.459]  I've covered it on Coast to Coast.
[02:35:56.780 --> 02:36:06.825]  This is real and earthquakes are increasing and they're behaving like they haven't behaved in the several hundred years that the scientists
[02:36:07.886 --> 02:36:11.448]  The seismologist, the volcanologist, and others have been studying it.
[02:36:11.608 --> 02:36:19.434]  And I got Secretary of Defense Cohen in Army Times saying that our government and other governments have developed tectonic earthquake weapons.
[02:36:20.034 --> 02:36:25.178]  And just like they laughed at us years ago about weather modification, now it's all over the news.
[02:36:25.458 --> 02:36:31.002]  And they're not just spraying stuff out of airplanes, they've got these big antenna farms doing it from the U.S.
[02:36:31.022 --> 02:36:31.703]  to the Middle East.
[02:36:31.763 --> 02:36:32.463]  It's crazy.
[02:36:32.923 --> 02:36:34.825]  Let me get Max Keiser's take on that.
[02:36:36.314 --> 02:36:43.521]  Well, what about the earthquakes that our industry is putting together on purpose?
[02:36:43.621 --> 02:36:50.768]  I'm referring to shale fracking, where they're going in and they're fracking the crust of the Earth to get a little natural gas.
[02:36:50.848 --> 02:36:53.330]  I'm sure that disturbs the Earth's crust.
[02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:55.232]  And of course, it's a politically correct term.
[02:36:55.412 --> 02:36:58.435]  They don't call it cracking, they call it fracking.
[02:36:58.455 --> 02:36:59.356]  I mean, what a joke.
[02:36:59.946 --> 02:37:00.626]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:00.706 --> 02:37:11.308]  Now, this is just industry cracking and cracking the Earth's crust to get a little extra cubic feet of gas to power this industrial monstrosity for a few more months.
[02:37:11.628 --> 02:37:13.468]  Just leave the Earth's crust alone.
[02:37:13.628 --> 02:37:16.349]  You know, stop, stop, stop cracking.
[02:37:16.689 --> 02:37:26.331]  Well, we saw that with the Deepwater Horizon, a record deep well, and I was studying in many areas of the Gulf of Mexico, as deep as they were going is how thick the crust is.
[02:37:26.611 --> 02:37:27.851]  They're going into the mantle.
[02:37:29.007 --> 02:37:32.830]  Yeah, well that's going to disturb the way, you know, that's the point.
[02:37:32.850 --> 02:37:35.913]  Do you know how many drilled pits there are in the Gulf of Mexico?
[02:37:35.933 --> 02:37:37.254]  I was amazed during the BP crisis.
[02:37:37.294 --> 02:37:40.577]  There are thousands of these things going in there and screwing around.
[02:37:40.597 --> 02:37:43.319]  Yeah, I think there's 15,000 plus in the Gulf.
[02:37:43.419 --> 02:37:47.262]  I mean, if you go out there fishing now, when I was a kid, you go out fishing, you hardly saw rigs.
[02:37:47.542 --> 02:37:49.704]  It's now just rigs everywhere.
[02:37:50.264 --> 02:37:53.147]  And when it's night time, you see even more because now the lights stand out.
[02:37:53.647 --> 02:38:03.013]  They're just all over the place and you think about the butterfly effect or the lensing effect, the megaphone effect.
[02:38:03.033 --> 02:38:04.694]  What's the proper term?
[02:38:04.994 --> 02:38:05.734]  Amplification.
[02:38:05.894 --> 02:38:07.295]  Yes, the amplification effect.
[02:38:07.315 --> 02:38:07.756]  There you go.
[02:38:07.796 --> 02:38:08.396]  Thank you, Max.
[02:38:09.277 --> 02:38:12.038]  Of all of this, it's probably untold what it's doing.
[02:38:12.058 --> 02:38:13.239]  Lucretia?
[02:38:13.279 --> 02:38:15.200]  Well, that's what I was saying at the beginning of the show.
[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:19.783]  This is a year when Mother Nature finally says, go to hell.
[02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:31.342]  How do we know the globalists aren't launching a lot of these weather attacks themselves and then saying, oh, look at the weather, let us have our carbon taxes, buy Al Gore and other beachfront property, because the water's rising?
[02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:33.264]  Well, because...
[02:38:34.935 --> 02:38:42.557]  You have to have some sensitivity as an Earth-bound human being to what's happening with Mother Earth.
[02:38:42.797 --> 02:38:53.519]  You know, just listen to your own body and your own soul cry as you watch Earth crumble because it's being fracked to death and polluted to death.
[02:38:53.539 --> 02:38:54.319]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:38:54.399 --> 02:38:55.079]  I'll say this.
[02:38:55.219 --> 02:38:58.580]  I mean, I don't doubt that the global, who are the global?
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.420]  They're corporations.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:00.521]  We're talking about the same thing.
[02:39:00.741 --> 02:39:01.941]  They're just destroying
[02:39:02.721 --> 02:39:04.122]  Yeah, the last Lorax gets cut down, yeah.
[02:39:04.142 --> 02:39:05.002]  Dr. Al-Qaeda-Seuss?
[02:39:31.158 --> 02:39:32.498]  He criticizes the government.
[02:39:32.518 --> 02:39:33.139]  I don't like him.
[02:39:34.479 --> 02:39:35.639]  Lucretia, great job.
[02:39:35.799 --> 02:39:37.560]  Thanks for helping us get on that station.
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:39.781]  That's how we're getting on all these great stations.
[02:39:40.461 --> 02:39:43.562]  And the stations are having big success with it and reaching more people, and we love it.
[02:39:44.462 --> 02:39:47.403]  Rashid in New York, thanks for holding for eons.
[02:39:47.443 --> 02:39:50.204]  You're on the air with the one, the only, Max Keiser.
[02:39:51.004 --> 02:39:51.784]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:39:51.824 --> 02:39:52.544]  First time caller.
[02:39:52.584 --> 02:39:53.245]  How you doing, Max?
[02:39:55.639 --> 02:40:04.562]  I just wanted to know what you actually think about the call-out group purchasing a major supplement company called MBTY for 3.2 billion dollars?
[02:40:05.823 --> 02:40:06.723]  Well, I've got a comment.
[02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:08.864]  That's an inside operation.
[02:40:09.244 --> 02:40:21.289]  They know that supplements, they know that agriculture, metals, commodities, energy is going to be the future as paper currencies and other forms of paper are exposed as being
[02:40:22.449 --> 02:40:48.331]  uh... fraud ridden uh... instruments but but also this is all about inside baseball just like the obama crime syndicate has given over five hundred waivers to select campaign contributors companies will mcdonald's and others where they don't have to get insurance for their employees or if you gave the democrats you get to keep your chevy dealership this is big city chicago mafia merged with the uh... fewer precept unitary executive of bushy
[02:40:49.331 --> 02:40:52.434]  What a monster amalgamation that is.
[02:40:52.834 --> 02:41:07.366]  And so you're going to only have select insiders who are allowed in the future, under Codex Alimentarius, that by the way is in the House and Senate bill, the Food Safety Act, admits they selectively get to shut down who they want.
[02:41:07.607 --> 02:41:09.888]  That's the essence of insider baseball.
[02:41:10.169 --> 02:41:13.752]  Comments on that, on what Rasheed's asking there, Max?
[02:41:14.462 --> 02:41:26.765]  Well, we're talking about a food supplement company and it goes, it's part and parcel with this idea of unnatural synthetic food and replacing natural food.
[02:41:27.065 --> 02:41:31.546]  You know, as you talk about on your show all the time, they're cracking down on people growing their own food.
[02:41:31.806 --> 02:41:36.967]  People are not allowed to, the price of natural organic food is beyond the reach of most people.
[02:41:37.347 --> 02:41:40.548]  So a company like this that produces food supplements
[02:41:41.649 --> 02:41:48.353]  The price is going to continue to go up as people are going to be shut out from access to wholesome, whole food.
[02:41:48.593 --> 02:41:51.115]  So this is part of that prison mentality.
[02:41:51.375 --> 02:41:53.096]  You know, it's basically prison gruel.
[02:41:53.417 --> 02:41:56.899]  And this is what they're going to be serving the poor prisoners in the casino goop.
[02:41:57.039 --> 02:41:58.720]  And you're talking about a general spectrum.
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.461]  I don't know about Carlisle, very wicked company, buying the company you mentioned.
[02:42:03.481 --> 02:42:04.181]  I've never heard of it.
[02:42:04.422 --> 02:42:07.583]  They may just be angel cakes and so they got bought because they have a good product.
[02:42:07.963 --> 02:42:08.483]  I don't know.
[02:42:08.923 --> 02:42:13.125]  I'm just generally looking at who financed the food safety bill.
[02:42:13.445 --> 02:42:17.346]  It has nothing to do with food safety and is Codex Alimentarius.
[02:42:17.666 --> 02:42:19.107]  And for years we'd fight this.
[02:42:19.407 --> 02:42:25.149]  We'd have the official UN documents, Europe trying to pass it, basically where you can't get raw vitamins over the counter.
[02:42:25.409 --> 02:42:25.969]  You've got to get them
[02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:30.112]  All adulterated and patented and reformulated by big pharma.
[02:42:30.612 --> 02:42:38.137]  And it's big pharma, big genetic engineering mixed with the military industrial complex and the big banks.
[02:42:38.458 --> 02:42:44.422]  And it's all just a predatory, weaponized, cancerous, takeover paradigm.
[02:42:44.662 --> 02:42:46.043]  Rashid, anything else from New York?
[02:42:47.517 --> 02:42:49.279]  Uh, just a prediction for 2011.
[02:42:49.319 --> 02:42:52.304]  A lot of the colleges are probably going to close down in a sense.
[02:42:52.344 --> 02:42:59.555]  They're going to close their doors because I guess a lot of people are realizing that there are no jobs here and degrees are basically worthless.
[02:43:00.814 --> 02:43:09.784]  Well, I mean, unless it's something like being a doctor or an engineer where you've really got to have the technicals, I feel so sorry for folks that go and get, you know, philosophy degrees and things.
[02:43:10.344 --> 02:43:10.925]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:43:11.225 --> 02:43:16.871]  I know so many engineers that are literally working at Walmart now.
[02:43:17.632 --> 02:43:18.013]  I don't know.
[02:43:32.809 --> 02:43:35.872]  They were literally teaching me nothing.
[02:43:36.212 --> 02:43:39.194]  It was like 50-year-old baloney about the media system.
[02:43:39.495 --> 02:43:43.838]  I just went out and found a crack in the media and jammed myself into it, and here we are.
[02:43:44.218 --> 02:43:48.782]  Look, shoe leather, ladies and gentlemen, and brains and action and taking action.
[02:43:48.822 --> 02:43:49.783]  That's how you get things done.
[02:43:49.823 --> 02:43:50.964]  I appreciate your call, Rasheed.
[02:43:51.304 --> 02:43:54.847]  And yes, the big education bubble, we've been talking about that for years.
[02:43:54.887 --> 02:43:56.048]  Max Keiser, your take on that.
[02:43:56.618 --> 02:44:05.326]  Well, yeah, I think it's an interesting reflection of what's going on in the rest of the economy, because education is becoming a have-nots and have-yots.
[02:44:05.786 --> 02:44:15.875]  So, okay, the price of an Ivy League education is going up, and of course the people who can afford to go to those schools are financed by the children of the bankers on Wall Street.
[02:44:16.015 --> 02:44:31.396]  And that's really, and Max, as you know, that's really only about getting in with the in crowd so that even if you're not from the elite family, maybe you can be a secretary making a million a year, and they do on Wall Street, because you, you know, dated the captain of the football team at Harvard or Yale.
[02:44:31.636 --> 02:44:33.619]  I mean, it's all about being part of the White Shoe Boys.
[02:44:34.471 --> 02:44:44.674]  Well, and they teach you, in economics, they teach you the neoliberal school of economics, the Chicago school, the Obama, he's a graduate of that school of economics, the Milton Friedman school.
[02:44:45.234 --> 02:44:49.136]  And this school, Ben Bernanke is also a graduate of this school.
[02:44:49.576 --> 02:44:53.397]  It teaches you to look at the economy and only see deflation.
[02:44:54.077 --> 02:45:05.266]  And your response is always to pump more money, which of course makes the asset prices of the people who weathered your education by endowing the colleges that you went to in the Ivy League rich because their asset prices go up.
[02:45:05.687 --> 02:45:17.877]  But the people who are now deprived of education are getting bankrupted because the food and energy that they have to spend 20 or 30 or 40 percent of their after-tax income on to survive is going up along with those asset prices, so they're bankrupted.
[02:45:18.337 --> 02:45:34.698]  So it's an education system that bankrupts the lower classes and enriches the higher classes by making the cost of Ivy League schools that much higher and by making the access to all education totally indebted and privatized like the prison industry.
[02:45:34.718 --> 02:45:44.669]  That creates a race to the bottom, and they're already prepositioning for that in armored government and corporate redoubts, where the rest of us are basically just hunted down by their hunter-killer drones.
[02:45:44.969 --> 02:45:46.351]  That's not the Terminator movie.
[02:45:46.671 --> 02:45:50.055]  That's their actual plan, with a drone-operated Skynet.
[02:45:50.956 --> 02:45:52.958]  I mean, these people are completely out of control.
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:55.721]  Yeah, Max, I'm interrupting you!
[02:46:17.177 --> 02:46:21.759]  I'm interrupting you because your cell phone is in a watery position.
[02:46:21.799 --> 02:46:27.201]  The cell phone is better than landlines for some reason from Paris to Austin, Texas.
[02:46:27.681 --> 02:46:30.082]  Or I guess this call is going through Austin, Texas.
[02:46:32.042 --> 02:46:33.203]  Now it sounds crystal clear.
[02:46:33.543 --> 02:46:34.643]  Repeat what you just said.
[02:46:34.663 --> 02:46:40.425]  I hope it's doing it again.
[02:46:40.445 --> 02:46:41.766]  It's driving me insane.
[02:46:42.806 --> 02:46:44.227]  Are you using a hands-free, Max?
[02:46:45.399 --> 02:46:45.659]  Yeah.
[02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:47.321]  I'm using the cell phone.
[02:46:48.222 --> 02:46:50.404]  I've been getting my... I was trying to find it.
[02:46:50.424 --> 02:46:51.165]  I don't know what to do.
[02:46:51.205 --> 02:46:52.506]  No, I'm just using the cell phone.
[02:47:01.921 --> 02:47:05.402]  We're just going to, Max, Max, we're going to reconnect with you right now, okay?
[02:47:05.422 --> 02:47:06.443]  We're going to call you right back.
[02:47:06.463 --> 02:47:10.365]  We'll see if we lose him like last week, but hopefully we're going to get this done and go into overdrive.
[02:47:10.385 --> 02:47:11.165]  Stay with us.
[02:47:11.185 --> 02:47:14.667]  We're going to call Max right back because, well, I don't have to tell you the problem, you hear it.
[02:47:14.687 --> 02:47:17.389]  It sounds like we're talking to him from the bottom of a swimming pool.
[02:47:18.169 --> 02:47:19.870]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:25.133]  I hope Angelo can just talk a little on me because we're getting Max back on or I can relay a question to Max.
[02:47:25.513 --> 02:47:27.454]  Angelo in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:47:28.334 --> 02:47:29.295]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:47:30.334 --> 02:47:30.754]  Good, sir.
[02:47:30.834 --> 02:47:31.935]  Boy, your phone sounds good.
[02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:32.355]  Go ahead.
[02:47:33.295 --> 02:47:46.639]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, first of all, that when I was in high school and first for a few years in college, sorry, I'm kind of nervous a little bit, but when I was, I studied journalism and I really got into that.
[02:47:46.679 --> 02:47:55.022]  I wrote for my high school newspaper, was a lead writer for them, traveled the country a little bit, but I got out of it because I was kind of sick of the bias.
[02:47:55.082 --> 02:47:57.022]  So I'd like to get back into that.
[02:47:57.042 --> 02:47:58.923]  And if you're ever in a time cruncher of
[02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:00.774]  You need an article written on it.
[02:48:00.835 --> 02:48:02.361]  My services are definitely at your disposal.
[02:48:03.069 --> 02:48:05.531]  Well, my problem is we're just a small organization.
[02:48:05.591 --> 02:48:10.814]  I've got people that understand the New World Order, and then they just write articles, and usually I don't even review them.
[02:48:11.335 --> 02:48:15.878]  Occasionally, I'll just tell them, you know, there's a typo here, because we're all moving so quick.
[02:48:16.178 --> 02:48:28.246]  But I would suggest you just start your own website, your own blog, start doing YouTube videos, go buy a $200 video camera, that's all you can afford, and start shooting video reports and using free video editing programs.
[02:48:28.686 --> 02:48:29.727]  I mean, that's what I did.
[02:48:29.887 --> 02:48:31.628]  I would go out and shoot on like a $200 or less camera,
[02:48:34.829 --> 02:48:40.051]  I'd have to edit it on 3 quarter inch ancient 1970s equipment they had at AXS TV.
[02:48:40.711 --> 02:48:43.791]  Later they got new equipment, but I already knew how to use the old stuff.
[02:48:44.231 --> 02:48:51.453]  I used to hand cut audio tape with a splicer and I'm glad I had to do all of that by myself.
[02:48:51.933 --> 02:48:56.274]  Made my films, voiced them, you know, made the first three or four all by myself.
[02:48:56.594 --> 02:49:00.055]  The rest was with a computer at my house that took hours to render one minute.
[02:49:00.775 --> 02:49:02.656]  And so nowadays it's like Buck Rogers.
[02:49:03.596 --> 02:49:05.577]  But I mean, just do it, do it, do it.
[02:49:05.597 --> 02:49:07.918]  A lot of people say, I'm training to be a journalist.
[02:49:08.038 --> 02:49:08.998]  I'm getting involved.
[02:49:09.018 --> 02:49:10.059]  You know right from wrong.
[02:49:10.319 --> 02:49:11.779]  You're going to learn as you go along.
[02:49:12.399 --> 02:49:13.580]  Just get in the game.
[02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:14.500]  Get involved.
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:16.021]  Have your voice be heard now.
[02:49:16.461 --> 02:49:22.823]  You don't have to build, and I'm not putting you down, Angelo, I'm just telling you, towards, you know, someday I'm going to be a journalist.
[02:49:22.863 --> 02:49:29.786]  I mean, you've got the lady who, I've got the article here, who lied about aluminum tubes and nukes in Iraq.
[02:49:30.146 --> 02:49:33.528]  Criticizing WikiLeaks and saying they're not real journalists right now.
[02:49:34.108 --> 02:49:40.311]  I mean, that's like Beelzebub, you know, saying that John the Baptist is a wicked devil.
[02:49:40.731 --> 02:49:45.093]  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous, but great to hear from you, Angelo.
[02:49:45.133 --> 02:49:47.154]  Get in there and get involved and just start.
[02:49:47.194 --> 02:49:48.095]  You are a journalist.
[02:49:48.115 --> 02:49:49.175]  You are a researcher.
[02:49:49.435 --> 02:49:50.456]  You know right from wrong.
[02:49:50.496 --> 02:49:52.457]  You know taser deaths every day are wrong.
[02:49:52.757 --> 02:49:53.978]  You know the police state's wrong.
[02:49:53.998 --> 02:49:55.518]  You know the government is too big.
[02:49:56.139 --> 02:49:58.320]  Max Keiser, do you have any comments to Angelo?
[02:49:58.939 --> 02:50:00.621]  Yeah, I sure do.
[02:50:00.661 --> 02:50:01.703]  Here's the secret to life.
[02:50:02.784 --> 02:50:07.410]  Get yourself a copy of Webster's New College Dictionary.
[02:50:07.430 --> 02:50:08.992]  It costs about six bucks.
[02:50:10.009 --> 02:50:12.250]  And read the entire thing cover to cover.
[02:50:12.610 --> 02:50:16.212]  It might take you two years, but read the entire dictionary.
[02:50:17.092 --> 02:50:23.255]  That way, you give yourself an education, and you are ready to strike out on your own into the future world.
[02:50:23.275 --> 02:50:25.236]  And by the way, that's all they did with the Founding Fathers.
[02:50:25.296 --> 02:50:38.162]  Almost all of them were trained until about 14 at home, and they read the Encyclopedia, and Black's Law, and other dictionaries, and they could speak five, six languages, and were all incredible inventors, and had IQs of probably around 180.
[02:50:39.463 --> 02:50:40.684]  So, he's absolutely right.
[02:50:41.184 --> 02:50:41.765]  That's how you do it.
[02:50:41.785 --> 02:50:42.345]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:44.726 --> 02:50:48.008]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:50:48.809 --> 02:50:53.052]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:50:53.312 --> 02:50:59.236]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:50:59.476 --> 02:51:01.617]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:01.897 --> 02:51:07.861]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:08.001 --> 02:51:11.325]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:11.405 --> 02:51:13.107]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:13.267 --> 02:51:15.309]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:15.450 --> 02:51:20.115]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:20.335 --> 02:51:20.956]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:21.156 --> 02:51:25.201]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:25.441 --> 02:51:33.449]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:34.190]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:34.210 --> 02:51:35.031]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:45.347 --> 02:51:48.971]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:49.371 --> 02:51:52.375]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:52.615 --> 02:51:57.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:51:57.420 --> 02:52:03.647]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:03.807 --> 02:52:06.050]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:06.570 --> 02:52:07.010]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.310]  Bernanke?
[02:52:07.390 --> 02:52:08.151]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:08.191 --> 02:52:09.331]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:09.351 --> 02:52:11.592]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:25.478 --> 02:52:29.400]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:29.860 --> 02:52:32.402]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:52:32.762 --> 02:52:41.847]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:48.082]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:53:13.294 --> 02:53:14.375]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:14.535 --> 02:53:18.918]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:19.098 --> 02:53:24.822]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:24.902 --> 02:53:28.324]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:28.544 --> 02:53:31.146]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:31.266 --> 02:53:36.189]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:36.329 --> 02:53:36.550]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:36.570 --> 02:53:37.971]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:45.896 --> 02:53:58.987]  Alright, I'm going to continue in this segment into the next with Max Keiser on calls.
[02:53:59.027 --> 02:54:01.449]  Then I want to get into all the other issues with Max.
[02:54:01.469 --> 02:54:04.292]  Some of the just incredible police state developments.
[02:54:05.132 --> 02:54:11.478]  Like the courts, federal court ruling, police don't need a warrant to take your cell phone and download everything off of it.
[02:54:13.649 --> 02:54:23.113]  I mean this is happening and all these smart cameras to go and quote all the businesses to make sure you're not upset or angry right out of THX 1138.
[02:54:24.694 --> 02:54:26.695]  That's in the New York Times telling you how great it is.
[02:54:26.715 --> 02:54:27.475]  This is insane.
[02:54:27.995 --> 02:54:34.398]  Now more than ever we've got to speak out and say no and support alternative media and people that tell the truth.
[02:54:34.879 --> 02:54:35.299]  I've done
[02:54:37.222 --> 02:54:38.243]  Almost three hours now.
[02:54:38.263 --> 02:54:41.445]  We're doing the fourth hour coming up with Max Keiser and your calls and a lot of news.
[02:54:42.446 --> 02:54:45.007]  And I haven't plugged PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:45.828 --> 02:54:48.590]  Fifteen cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:54:49.390 --> 02:54:57.436]  For a few more weeks we're going to have the New Year special that we run in December into New Year's, where you can get five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:54:57.856 --> 02:55:05.902]  A higher quality audio commercial free podcast, the videocast, the video simulcast of the radio show, several more dimensions of information.
[02:55:06.718 --> 02:55:10.061]  PrisonPlanet.tv, and it is your memberships that make it possible.
[02:55:10.441 --> 02:55:13.644]  Every subject under the sun, every guest you can imagine, all there.
[02:55:13.724 --> 02:55:16.966]  Special interviews where I've got crews flying all over the country.
[02:55:16.986 --> 02:55:20.709]  We've got two new interviews going up this week, several the next week, several more.
[02:55:20.729 --> 02:55:21.430]  It's just endless.
[02:55:21.850 --> 02:55:27.095]  I'm gonna start just dumping whole archives of never-before-seen stuff, new stuff, all to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:27.315 --> 02:55:28.616]  We're upping our operations.
[02:55:28.676 --> 02:55:31.318]  Soon I'm starting a daily TV show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:31.518 --> 02:55:33.300]  It'll be developed into a weekly for television.
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:34.841]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:35.341 --> 02:55:36.783]  15 cents a day, 15 cents a day.
[02:55:37.243 --> 02:55:38.564]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:39.065 --> 02:55:40.306]  And the special's almost up.
[02:55:40.326 --> 02:55:42.427]  If you want to get 5-plus months free, sign up for a year.
[02:55:42.628 --> 02:55:45.210]  You pay for 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months free.
[02:55:45.490 --> 02:55:46.571]  That's what the special comes out to.
[02:55:46.851 --> 02:55:48.232]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:48.653 --> 02:55:51.595]  And spread the word about the free podcast, the free iPhone app.
[02:55:51.855 --> 02:55:53.317]  That's how we're reaching more people.
[02:55:53.937 --> 02:56:04.919]  It's good for you to talk yourself blue in the face to neighbors or give them copies of films that are, you know, covering these issues like Endgame, Invisible Empire, Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, that shatter the left-right paradigm.
[02:56:05.399 --> 02:56:18.502]  But it's even more important to get them to listen to the show, so then they'll hear Max Keiser's and Ron Paul's and Jesse Ventura's and Stefan Molyneux's and, you know, all these different ideas and Alan Watt.
[02:56:19.082 --> 02:56:22.206]  The website, of course, for Max Keiser is maxkeiser.com.
[02:56:22.226 --> 02:56:33.442]  That's maxkeiser.com, and he has a show on RT, BBC, Press TV, a Saturday morning radio show on Genesis, GCNlive.com.
[02:56:33.722 --> 02:56:36.165]  I mean, it's just amazing the output he's doing.
[02:56:36.946 --> 02:56:46.389]  As we go to the fourth hour, I want to finish up with calls and then get into other issues and things that are on your radar and where you see silver going and where you see the economy going.
[02:56:47.029 --> 02:56:51.070]  But Max, specifically, more about the alternative media.
[02:56:51.290 --> 02:57:00.513]  The system's coming in now, openly saying they want to censor it, and even mainstream news like CTV in Canada is reporting this is a corporate takeover of the web.
[02:57:00.533 --> 02:57:01.253]  They're getting scared.
[02:57:02.697 --> 02:57:10.906]  Yeah, well, did you see that news that came out, I guess, in the last couple of months, that actually they're going to open up the spectrum to community radio stations in the U.S.
[02:57:10.926 --> 02:57:15.711]  They're going to allow communities now to start up local radio stations.
[02:57:15.771 --> 02:57:19.916]  Yeah, they always say that, though, and then it's local communism promotion stuff.
[02:57:21.327 --> 02:57:26.489]  Well, I mean, it started out because they're in crisis in various communities.
[02:57:26.529 --> 02:57:33.512]  There was no way to inform people because all the local stations were national stations and they had no local way to reach out to people.
[02:57:33.932 --> 02:57:34.653]  So they passed.
[02:57:34.893 --> 02:57:44.837]  So there's some very aggressive, you know, radio-friendly people who got this passed, and they're going to start giving out local radio licenses.
[02:57:44.997 --> 02:57:45.658]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:57:45.678 --> 02:57:53.864]  It needs to be like AXS TV, though, on the radio and not be some kind of fake co-op where everybody's wearing red stars on their shirts.
[02:57:54.164 --> 02:58:02.630]  And that means as these licenses go out, good people need to get the license at the inception of this and make sure it's a real liberty message.
[02:58:02.650 --> 02:58:03.611]  Do you agree, Max Keiser?
[02:58:04.111 --> 02:58:04.832]  That's right.
[02:58:04.852 --> 02:58:11.337]  Look it up now and get in line now so you can grab the spectrum and you can all launch your free radio, local radio stations.
[02:58:11.377 --> 02:58:12.878]  This is the greatest thing to happen in the world.
[02:58:12.898 --> 02:58:14.780]  Or as long as you don't interfere with anybody.
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:20.624]  Just fire up a powerful pirate transmitter and say, New World Order, you want it, you got it.
[02:58:20.805 --> 02:58:21.966]  That's real renegade.
[02:58:22.126 --> 02:58:24.287]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with the Kaisi.
[02:58:24.688 --> 02:58:29.772]  On air, online, and on demand.
[02:58:30.072 --> 02:58:33.355]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:35.114 --> 02:58:37.715]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:38.115 --> 02:58:43.096]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:43.456 --> 02:58:45.197]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:58:45.497 --> 02:58:50.318]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:58:50.498 --> 02:58:51.459]  How much do you want?
[02:58:51.679 --> 02:58:52.419]  When do you want it?
[02:58:52.799 --> 02:58:54.400]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:55.521]  When will you need it?
[02:58:55.761 --> 02:58:57.823]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:58:57.963 --> 02:58:59.064]  Will there be any food?
[02:58:59.304 --> 02:59:00.645]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:00.825 --> 02:59:05.888]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:06.109 --> 02:59:09.231]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:09.671 --> 02:59:13.173]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:13.493 --> 02:59:14.494]  How much will you need?
[02:59:14.734 --> 02:59:15.354]  We don't know.
[02:59:15.634 --> 02:59:16.535]  How much do you want?
[02:59:16.735 --> 02:59:17.475]  All you can get.
[02:59:17.655 --> 02:59:18.516]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:18.756 --> 02:59:21.518]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:21.798 --> 02:59:23.559]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:23.579 --> 02:59:24.499]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:35.290 --> 02:59:38.152]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:38.872 --> 02:59:42.215]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:42.475 --> 03:00:00.227]  We are locked and loaded, dropping out of the atmosphere, down to ground level to engage the New World Order.
[03:00:03.932 --> 03:00:07.193]  It is the fourth and final hour of Overdrive Trends.
[03:00:07.353 --> 03:00:17.297]  Michon and Max Kaiser joining us from the land of the froggies in the main city, Paris.
[03:00:17.317 --> 03:00:20.378]  We're going to go to Thomas, Sonny, John and Cedric.
[03:00:20.658 --> 03:00:28.181]  And that's it for calls, though I love them because I've got a bunch of news I want to go over with Mr. Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com, linked up at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:31.208 --> 03:00:34.450]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:00:34.470 --> 03:00:42.955]  First I want to give you a big shout out and thanks for everything that you do.
[03:00:43.535 --> 03:00:55.202]  I was just calling because I'm a swim coach and I work with little kids every day and I just want to say that it's terrible seeing what some of these parents are doing with their little kids, you know, as far as nutrition goes and as far as the vaccines and the flu shots.
[03:00:55.802 --> 03:00:59.084]  I've seen little kids come in, you know, all excited and running around and happy.
[03:00:59.505 --> 03:01:05.614]  And then they go get their vaccines for school and jacked up with these flu shots and they come in and literally it's like they're a zombie.
[03:01:05.774 --> 03:01:07.016]  Oh yeah, mission complete.
[03:01:07.316 --> 03:01:08.097]  Read the insert.
[03:01:08.137 --> 03:01:09.039]  Total brain damage.
[03:01:09.059 --> 03:01:09.780]  The parents love it.
[03:01:11.019 --> 03:01:12.040]  They're not responding.
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:12.841]  They're walking around slow.
[03:01:12.861 --> 03:01:13.822]  I'm like, hey, what's up, man?
[03:01:13.882 --> 03:01:15.763]  And these are like six, seven-year-old kids.
[03:01:15.863 --> 03:01:16.804]  I'm like, hey, what's going on?
[03:01:16.824 --> 03:01:17.304]  What's going on?
[03:01:17.345 --> 03:01:18.265]  And they're just slow.
[03:01:18.586 --> 03:01:20.287]  And the parents are like, oh, they're tired today.
[03:01:20.327 --> 03:01:21.888]  And it's like, no, man, you can't do that.
[03:01:22.349 --> 03:01:23.189]  Oh, I know.
[03:01:23.370 --> 03:01:27.333]  Listen, I've known neighbor kids that were happy and everything, and they got all the flu shots last year.
[03:01:27.353 --> 03:01:29.014]  And they're just like, hello, are you there?
[03:01:29.335 --> 03:01:30.596]  And they ain't ever coming back.
[03:01:30.676 --> 03:01:32.958]  Mommy and Daddy have got a little zombie now.
[03:01:32.978 --> 03:01:34.419]  And Mommy and Daddy like that, though.
[03:01:34.639 --> 03:01:41.725]  They take their kid up like the Babylonians and the Cainites did and throw their kids into fiery pits to Baal or Moloch.
[03:01:42.066 --> 03:01:47.571]  No, now we throw them into fiery brain damage pits and the parents are just like, oh, the sacrament.
[03:01:48.532 --> 03:01:49.452]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:01:49.492 --> 03:01:49.853]  Go ahead.
[03:01:50.433 --> 03:01:51.334]  Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[03:01:51.354 --> 03:01:52.355]  They just don't even understand.
[03:01:52.375 --> 03:01:53.296]  They're not educated.
[03:01:53.316 --> 03:01:54.357]  And so the thing is,
[03:01:54.887 --> 03:02:03.613]  Our little girl, she comes home with a sheet and it says, you know, she had to have a list of five vaccines because she doesn't have a record of them because we never got her vaccinated.
[03:02:03.953 --> 03:02:08.817]  Listen, in order to go back to school, so we're like five vaccines a girl.
[03:02:08.857 --> 03:02:09.877]  By the way, it's not a law.
[03:02:09.918 --> 03:02:10.858]  It's all color of law.
[03:02:10.878 --> 03:02:11.799]  There's a waiver for that.
[03:02:12.774 --> 03:02:17.637]  Listen, listen, so I say, so we called up the principal, we're like, you know, what's this about the vaccines?
[03:02:17.677 --> 03:02:19.098]  We read the law, we don't have to do that.
[03:02:19.358 --> 03:02:21.060]  And they said, oh yeah, we know that.
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:24.082]  We just give it because we want the kids to be vaccinated.
[03:02:24.562 --> 03:02:26.043]  Oh, I know, it's so moral.
[03:02:26.243 --> 03:02:30.226]  And all the schools that got caught last year, we gave it even though the parents said no.
[03:02:30.606 --> 03:02:32.107]  Oopsie, we know best.
[03:02:32.307 --> 03:02:37.310]  You're like, well, here's all the Rockefeller Foundation documents, how they're putting sterilants and brain damaging chemicals by design.
[03:02:37.631 --> 03:02:38.351]  Oh, shut up.
[03:02:38.431 --> 03:02:39.192]  I'm with the government.
[03:02:39.392 --> 03:02:39.992]  Inject!
[03:02:40.553 --> 03:02:41.513]  Kids are having convulsions.
[03:02:41.533 --> 03:02:42.594]  They're like, yeah.
[03:02:43.014 --> 03:02:43.535]  I got two points.
[03:02:43.555 --> 03:02:45.996]  Number one, the kid should sue the parent for pharmacological abuse.
[03:02:46.017 --> 03:02:47.498]  They can make out like bandits.
[03:03:07.378 --> 03:03:10.019]  These kids should sue their parents.
[03:03:10.039 --> 03:03:15.000]  There's a lot of lawyers in America that will take on these cases, and they should go out and solicit these cases.
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:20.321]  They should advertise on kid shows, Saturday morning cartoons, to sue your parents for pharmacological abuse.
[03:03:20.841 --> 03:03:27.163]  Number two, I think a big growth industry in the next couple years is going to be wrongful birth insurance.
[03:03:27.791 --> 03:03:44.612]  People are going to sue their parents for having allowed them to be born in a world where people are jabbing them with flu shots and that the wrongful birth insurance for something like five or ten dollars a month is something that parents are going to be buying to protect themselves against their children suing them for wrongful birth.
[03:03:45.802 --> 03:03:48.684]  And by the way, Max isn't joking about this.
[03:03:48.704 --> 03:03:50.485]  I mean, he's predicted so much that's come true.
[03:03:51.366 --> 03:04:03.235]  But going back to Thomas, Thomas, it's your job to hand out to all the parents the actual drug insert and explain to them that even the British Medical Journal admits that that flu shot
[03:04:03.755 --> 03:04:06.816]  Double their chances of getting regular flu for the rest of their life.
[03:04:07.216 --> 03:04:09.837]  It's destroying their immune systems.
[03:04:10.357 --> 03:04:11.978]  And the government is not their friend.
[03:04:12.058 --> 03:04:13.818]  Stop being gullible slugs.
[03:04:14.258 --> 03:04:19.100]  But there's your criminality right there that the school would lie about this.
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:21.201]  Thomas, we got 20 seconds left.
[03:04:21.221 --> 03:04:23.601]  You got another question for Kaiser you can answer after the break?
[03:04:23.821 --> 03:04:25.122]  No, no, just real quick.
[03:04:25.162 --> 03:04:26.482]  I just wanted to say I was a step ahead.
[03:04:26.502 --> 03:04:28.623]  I already got emailed out to parents and stuff like that.
[03:04:28.923 --> 03:04:29.303]  Nice!
[03:04:44.801 --> 03:04:45.282]  Attention!
[03:04:45.462 --> 03:05:00.542]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:05:00.822 --> 03:05:09.265]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[03:05:09.445 --> 03:05:15.147]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[03:05:15.387 --> 03:05:21.129]  Silica is a precursor to calcium, meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[03:05:21.250 --> 03:05:26.752]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter.
[03:05:26.912 --> 03:05:27.912]  And with an unlimited
[03:05:28.012 --> 03:05:29.613]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:05:29.653 --> 03:05:31.094]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:05:31.114 --> 03:05:33.296]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:05:33.316 --> 03:05:38.240]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:05:57.094 --> 03:06:01.317]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:01.617 --> 03:06:03.918]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:03.938 --> 03:06:06.480]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:09.421]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:09.761 --> 03:06:17.366]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:22.942]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:23.083 --> 03:06:25.884]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:25.924 --> 03:06:29.367]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:29.607 --> 03:06:30.527]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:30.687 --> 03:06:31.988]  You're everyone else.

[03:07:45.091 --> 03:07:48.053]  Hello, it's me, Sid the Science Kid, and I have a question.
[03:07:48.353 --> 03:07:51.195]  I'm getting the H1N1 vaccination and I want to know why.
[03:07:51.635 --> 03:07:54.497]  Sid, I'm Governor Mark Parkinson, and I think I can help.
[03:07:55.138 --> 03:08:00.021]  Kids run a higher risk of getting the H1N1 flu and developing serious complications.
[03:08:00.581 --> 03:08:06.165]  That's why the H1N1 vaccination is the best way to keep you and your community safe and healthy.
[03:08:06.626 --> 03:08:08.187]  You can learn more at flu.gov.
[03:08:08.607 --> 03:08:09.307]  Thanks, Governor!
[03:08:09.708 --> 03:08:11.029]  See you later, scientists!
[03:08:14.451 --> 03:08:23.754]  Now that's one of the ads, but we have the actual TV piece where they're like, the teacher's like, it might hurt a little, but it'll help a lot!
[03:08:24.014 --> 03:08:29.895]  And it shows the older kids, they induct the little kid, and then he gets to be cool because he takes a shot.
[03:08:30.695 --> 03:08:32.936]  I used to have dreams and think a lot.
[03:08:33.336 --> 03:08:36.117]  Now I'm going to have an autoimmune response.
[03:08:36.357 --> 03:08:39.198]  I'm going to lose a few million brain cells and be toxic.
[03:08:39.498 --> 03:08:40.498]  And you'll get cancer.
[03:08:40.698 --> 03:08:41.838]  It's going to be fun.
[03:08:42.119 --> 03:08:43.439]  But see, they don't really tell the kid that.
[03:08:44.295 --> 03:08:45.356]  It's a chemical weapon.
[03:08:45.436 --> 03:08:46.637]  Alex has got all the U.N.
[03:08:46.677 --> 03:08:49.119]  documents posted in fullwars.com.
[03:08:49.459 --> 03:08:56.524]  Get ready to be brain damaged, kid, and have your IQ reduced and your sperm count drop when you become fertile.
[03:08:56.805 --> 03:08:58.366]  It's part of the official U.N.
[03:08:58.426 --> 03:08:59.306]  eugenics program.
[03:08:59.987 --> 03:09:00.567]  No, no, no, no.
[03:09:00.627 --> 03:09:02.729]  It's like, oh, Sonny, get your shot.
[03:09:03.049 --> 03:09:03.590]  Here it is.
[03:09:04.878 --> 03:09:05.639]  We'll go to Max Keiser.
[03:09:06.379 --> 03:09:10.102]  This gas chamber is a great opportunity.
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:32.882]  This firing squad's a great opportunity.
[03:09:32.902 --> 03:09:35.483]  Never mind the U.N.
[03:09:35.623 --> 03:09:37.764]  thought giving people syphilis.
[03:09:39.965 --> 03:09:44.988]  Never mind the fact, I will give it to you.
[03:09:45.529 --> 03:09:46.169]  Like the U.N.
[03:09:46.209 --> 03:09:48.230]  giving people iPolio.
[03:09:48.390 --> 03:09:49.611]  It's so much fun!
[03:09:49.631 --> 03:09:50.351]  Ho ho ho!
[03:10:04.517 --> 03:10:06.818]  Okay, isn't that sweet?
[03:10:06.838 --> 03:10:08.879]  It's so nice.
[03:10:09.279 --> 03:10:10.299]  It's so loving.
[03:10:10.359 --> 03:10:14.080]  Max Keiser, what do you think of that?
[03:10:32.469 --> 03:10:35.891]  Remember, you're never too young to sue your parents.
[03:10:38.971 --> 03:10:42.312]  You know, we sit here and laugh at this stuff, folks, but I mean, I've pulled it up on air.
[03:10:42.392 --> 03:10:44.513]  You can just, in fact, we'll do it live on air for everybody right now.
[03:10:44.893 --> 03:10:59.498]  Just type in Rockefeller Foundation Developed Sterilants and Vaccines, Infowars.com, and then we've got like a ten-part series, and then it links directly to the actual documents from the 60s.
[03:10:59.978 --> 03:11:03.419]  Or we can just type in, UN gave live polio to children.
[03:11:03.959 --> 03:11:05.881]  And you'll get CBS, AP, you name it.
[03:11:05.902 --> 03:11:07.904]  But it's always, they don't know why it happened.
[03:11:07.944 --> 03:11:08.685]  It was an accident.
[03:11:08.705 --> 03:11:09.626]  It killed a bunch of them.
[03:11:09.826 --> 03:11:11.769]  But it happens all over the world over and over again.
[03:11:13.051 --> 03:11:14.032]  Rockler Foundation.
[03:11:14.172 --> 03:11:15.253]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:11:16.678 --> 03:11:17.399]  Sterilize.
[03:11:17.459 --> 03:11:18.519]  Infowars.com.
[03:11:18.539 --> 03:11:19.340]  Then it should pop up.
[03:11:20.161 --> 03:11:21.161]  If not, you can call Watson.
[03:11:21.181 --> 03:11:21.982]  He knows where it's all at.
[03:11:22.002 --> 03:11:23.143]  We've got so many articles.
[03:11:23.623 --> 03:11:23.943]  There it is.
[03:11:24.003 --> 03:11:26.746]  Rockefeller Foundation article right there.
[03:11:26.786 --> 03:11:27.406]  We can click on that.
[03:11:27.746 --> 03:11:29.367]  I'm going to shut up and go back to Max Keiser.
[03:11:29.708 --> 03:11:32.810]  Max, what do you think of eugenics and the overall population program?
[03:11:32.830 --> 03:11:40.556]  I mean, you're kind of saying we've got a toxic environment, but is the answer just get rid of all the people so that the bankers can enjoy the planet for themselves?
[03:11:42.113 --> 03:11:50.298]  Well, the toxic environment is caused by corporations, and I don't see any differentiation between corporations and the globalists, as you call them.
[03:11:50.358 --> 03:12:04.806]  I mean, the corporations are mandated to make a profit, and that mandate does not include making any consideration for the risks that they're taking to the environment or to anyone's well-being.
[03:12:05.206 --> 03:12:16.109]  So the problem at the root is that the corporate charter, that what makes a corporation that needs to change, for example, corporations are protected under free speech.
[03:12:16.449 --> 03:12:31.213]  That even though they're making claims that are ridiculous, like these injections are going to be beneficial, and they're lying, they say we're protected under free speech because they say we're an individual.
[03:12:31.693 --> 03:12:34.176]  Now that's something that they lobbied for and that's completely false.
[03:12:34.396 --> 03:12:35.237]  That has to change.
[03:12:35.558 --> 03:12:39.262]  Corporations, the way that corporations are chartered needs to completely change.
[03:12:39.302 --> 03:12:49.774]  There's a state in Delaware where every corporation in America virtually is chartered and incorporated in Delaware because the laws in Delaware allow for corporations to do all these nasty things.
[03:12:50.054 --> 03:12:57.099]  First thing we need to do, shut down all the Delaware incorporation that's going on until further review.
[03:12:57.479 --> 03:13:02.963]  Force these companies to incorporate in the states where they do business and the countries where they do business.
[03:13:03.704 --> 03:13:10.768]  And that would immediately take away most of their ability to abuse the population in the name of profits without any accountability.
[03:13:11.109 --> 03:13:14.331]  Profits without any accountability is abuse.
[03:13:14.571 --> 03:13:22.876]  But it's profits that also phase us out and then leave them with all of the resources and with air in their lungs.
[03:13:23.276 --> 03:13:26.278]  Total domination just getting us completely out of the way.
[03:13:26.318 --> 03:13:28.680]  So these profits are a means to an end.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:30.581]  What do you think about the TSA?
[03:13:30.601 --> 03:13:31.642]  You know, the good news is
[03:13:32.182 --> 03:13:35.604]  Even Brian Williams, the anchor, is saying he doesn't like it that he's been groped.
[03:13:35.724 --> 03:13:36.365]  Ron Paul.
[03:13:36.765 --> 03:13:38.666]  All these prominent people are being abused.
[03:13:40.428 --> 03:13:41.849]  I think they're going to lose this fight.
[03:13:42.209 --> 03:14:01.842]  And what do you think a big sis trying to put, and are now putting, 9,000, I've seen the first videos of it going in Walmart, but other locations, not just Walmart's, 9,000 locations, telescreens, where government forces its way into your life, into the market, into the streets, with messages about spying on your neighbor.
[03:14:02.363 --> 03:14:08.158]  I mean, isn't that really just about us spying on each other instead of spying on the corrupt government, the real terrorist?
[03:14:09.104 --> 03:14:16.409]  Well, I think that the TSA is clearly an example of submission, which is psychological warfare, clearly.
[03:14:16.789 --> 03:14:25.755]  If you see your neighbor being sexually abused in public by a government official, and you don't do anything about it, they've got you.
[03:14:25.855 --> 03:14:29.738]  You're submitting to corporate power, and you are never going to be the same.
[03:14:30.178 --> 03:14:31.859]  And that's what that's all about.
[03:14:31.879 --> 03:14:33.961]  That's where our spying goes, our surveillance.
[03:14:34.601 --> 03:14:40.945]  Somebody somewhere sold the government on the idea that they could get a discount on buying 50,000 or 50 million cameras.
[03:14:40.965 --> 03:14:46.948]  And the government, the bureaucracy that it is, said, yeah, okay, we'll take that deal, never thinking about the consequences.
[03:14:47.228 --> 03:14:48.629]  There's no accountability in government.
[03:14:48.829 --> 03:14:50.871]  There's no accountability in the corporate space.
[03:14:50.971 --> 03:14:55.133]  Well, the corporate guys just pay off the politicians to buy their 50 million cameras.
[03:14:55.313 --> 03:14:55.913]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:55.953 --> 03:14:59.576]  So the, unfortunately, government is now beholden to corporations.
[03:14:59.656 --> 03:15:01.017]  Corporations beholden to the banks.
[03:15:01.617 --> 03:15:02.718]  And there's no accountability.
[03:15:03.058 --> 03:15:04.339]  There's no transparency.
[03:15:25.654 --> 03:15:34.453]  Immunity they are lobbying for big government to steal our wealth and so I understand the anarchist view well if you didn't have a big government
[03:15:35.242 --> 03:15:36.463]  They couldn't get away with that.
[03:15:38.865 --> 03:15:43.909]  I'm glad you said this about libertarians, because I'm more on the same page here.
[03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:48.713]  The libertarian arguments I find incomplete in many ways.
[03:15:49.333 --> 03:15:55.058]  For the reasons you just suggested, that you can't give carte blanche to corporations that repeatedly break the law.
[03:15:55.358 --> 03:15:57.500]  And like these banks, they get too big to fail.
[03:15:57.700 --> 03:16:00.042]  They get too big to obey the law, effectively.
[03:16:00.462 --> 03:16:18.617]  Plus, the idea of small government is okay as long as you have people obeying the law and not shrinking the government by getting rid of the laws to govern the corporations and the people who should be obeying some form of legal construct or constraint.
[03:16:18.877 --> 03:16:33.233]  Yeah, there's gotta be some kind of basic rules even to a wide-open game because the minute you have total anarchy, in five seconds a strongman's gonna get a cache of arms, form his army, and come and literally play polo with your skull.
[03:16:33.814 --> 03:16:36.295]  Competition thrives on the rules.
[03:16:36.835 --> 03:16:44.138]  You know, this is what makes competition exciting for the people who are engaging in the competition, is that they are all abiding by the same rules.
[03:16:44.518 --> 03:16:47.339]  Therefore, it's a game that they like to compete in.
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:17:03.686]  This is something that this government and this Obama administration doesn't seem to get through their thick skull, that by imposing stricter environmental rules, you actually are going to increase competition, increase alternative industries to compete with these entrenched oligarchs
[03:17:03.746 --> 03:17:03.966]  I think so.
[03:17:21.411 --> 03:17:27.096]  But again, the megabanks openly are the progenitors of the carbon tax environmental movement as we know it.
[03:17:27.597 --> 03:17:35.083]  Their system is only let the megas operate, shut everybody else down through a fake environmental iron fist.
[03:17:37.145 --> 03:17:43.771]  My solution to the carbon emissions problem, the global warming problem, is to let
[03:17:44.534 --> 03:17:50.079]  Well, Kaiser, what do you do about megacorporations always buying up all the new patents?
[03:18:02.830 --> 03:18:04.550]  Max, we have the coldest winter in a thousand years.
[03:18:04.890 --> 03:18:07.451]  I mean, I've really interviewed scores of scientists, looked at the history.
[03:18:07.491 --> 03:18:10.551]  Just 200,000 years ago, carbon dioxide was much higher than it is now.
[03:18:10.591 --> 03:18:14.732]  It's been dozens and dozens, something like 50-something times higher, you know, in the past.
[03:18:32.515 --> 03:18:44.546]  Just the whole way the environmental movement has been set up is they're a bunch of communists at the grassroots run by wicked bankers who don't want competition and they're going to use environmentalism to shut down all their competition.
[03:18:44.767 --> 03:18:46.028]  It's the opposite of what you're saying.
[03:18:47.082 --> 03:18:48.363]  It is the opposite of what I'm saying.
[03:18:48.704 --> 03:18:55.591]  I'm saying to encourage competition regardless of what your thoughts are on the global warming debate.
[03:18:56.953 --> 03:19:05.902]  Sure, no one can deny that oil is dirty and has all these toxic byproducts that they can't get rid of so they put it in your water saying it's a mineral, fluoride and all of this.
[03:19:06.022 --> 03:19:06.983]  I understand all that.
[03:19:07.864 --> 03:19:10.227]  Well, you know, there's a lot of alternative energies.
[03:19:10.247 --> 03:19:22.781]  You know, Buckminster Fuller invented an electric car back in the 1920s, I believe, but he was snuffed out by the three big players, Firestone Tires, Exxon Gas, and one other.
[03:19:22.841 --> 03:19:30.744]  That's like the tire makers and the car makers openly shutting down all the great trolleys that had been organically grown by people buying their tickets.
[03:19:31.064 --> 03:19:32.805]  And now we're designed for cars.
[03:19:33.345 --> 03:19:34.305]  We're sprawled.
[03:19:34.566 --> 03:19:41.468]  We have to have them because you now can't set up a transportation bus or train grid that'll work the way we're set up.
[03:19:41.488 --> 03:19:42.208]  They've got us.
[03:19:42.369 --> 03:19:43.109]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:44.818 --> 03:19:48.121]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[03:19:48.382 --> 03:19:49.463]  It ended on June of 2009.
[03:19:49.523 --> 03:19:53.867]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[03:19:54.087 --> 03:19:59.733]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[03:20:00.033 --> 03:20:02.015]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[03:20:02.175 --> 03:20:02.756]  They've begun
[03:20:02.776 --> 03:20:03.256]  I think so.
[03:20:19.252 --> 03:20:24.235]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[03:20:24.535 --> 03:20:29.738]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.

[03:21:44.145 --> 03:21:45.286]  A very wealthy U.S.
[03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:52.032]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:21:52.292 --> 03:21:54.574]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:21:54.854 --> 03:22:00.059]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:22:00.259 --> 03:22:03.060]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:05.340]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:22:05.520 --> 03:22:11.501]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:22:11.821 --> 03:22:15.022]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:22:15.202 --> 03:22:20.763]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:22:21.023 --> 03:22:22.344]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:22:22.664 --> 03:22:23.884]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:22:23.984 --> 03:22:26.525]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:22:26.665 --> 03:22:28.085]  He explains everything you need to know.
[03:22:28.365 --> 03:22:30.706]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:22:44.727 --> 03:22:47.290]  New year, new way to smoke, and it's Totally Wicked!
[03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:52.596]  Introducing Totally Wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes, the highest quality e-cigarettes in the world.

[03:24:20.442 --> 03:24:35.355]  Going up at Infowars.com the next 10-15 minutes is going to be Max Keiser's latest special on Monsanto that is very avant-garde for something like RT.
[03:24:35.415 --> 03:24:38.558]  I mean for mainline television it is pretty...
[03:24:39.719 --> 03:24:45.022]  Risque, because they are a litigious lot to say the least.
[03:24:45.762 --> 03:24:47.003]  But Max Keiser is our guest.
[03:24:47.023 --> 03:24:55.727]  We're going to take a few more calls and then in our final segment with Max, we're going to get more into some other news items I want to raise and other points that he thinks is important on the radar for 2011.
[03:24:58.468 --> 03:25:00.530]  Again, if you don't know who I am, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:03.853]  If you're driving along listening to us for the first time, I'm a syndicated radio host.
[03:25:03.873 --> 03:25:05.474]  I've been on air now almost 16 years.
[03:25:06.175 --> 03:25:07.896]  And, of course, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:25:08.176 --> 03:25:12.900]  And our news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:25:12.960 --> 03:25:20.887]  Max Keiser is the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange Predictive Trading System, widely used in a lot of other systems today.
[03:25:20.907 --> 03:25:26.151]  He also has hosted TV shows in the U.S., England, you name it.
[03:25:26.591 --> 03:25:30.292]  Hi Alex, it's so great to talk to you and thank you to you and Max and everybody on your team.
[03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:56.051]  Super empowering and inspirational.
[03:25:56.271 --> 03:25:59.813]  My family and I have been following you for six years now.
[03:26:00.753 --> 03:26:06.977]  And I called today, I just wanted to let you know about our efforts in the Infowar.
[03:26:07.497 --> 03:26:17.982]  My daughter is eight years old and we talked about it and decided that out of all the issues that you cover, chemtrails have been the most obvious.
[03:26:18.402 --> 03:26:19.323]  Everybody can see it.
[03:26:19.503 --> 03:26:21.424]  You know, all you got to do is walk outside and look up
[03:26:22.239 --> 03:26:29.823]  And she decided to make bracelets in an effort to fund the Coalition Against Geoengineering.
[03:26:29.843 --> 03:26:33.444]  And she has a little Etsy page.
[03:26:33.524 --> 03:26:37.106]  It's called blueskybracelets.etsy.com.
[03:26:38.127 --> 03:26:40.788]  And I just wanted to let you and your listeners know about that.
[03:26:42.075 --> 03:26:44.197]  Hopefully we'll raise some awareness.
[03:26:56.946 --> 03:27:07.433]  And Bill Gates has bought heavily into it, and we know that they can manipulate the weather, and Max, there's a lot of evidence that they are already engaging in drought creation and other things.
[03:27:07.733 --> 03:27:22.202]  We know the CIA's been caught releasing insects, you name it, different bacterial or fungus infections, and there's a lot of evidence that we're under attack here as well, not just by government, but big agribusiness.
[03:27:22.242 --> 03:27:23.483]  Max Keiser, appreciate the call, Sonny.
[03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:29.143]  Geoengineering is obviously a disaster.
[03:27:29.223 --> 03:27:37.069]  I mean, the same people who are destroying the geology and the environment, how are they going to come up with a plan to reverse it?
[03:27:37.129 --> 03:27:38.190]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:43.514]  Let me make two or three quick points, if I might, on the trend watch.
[03:27:47.305 --> 03:27:47.846]  Well, you know what?
[03:27:47.926 --> 03:27:49.027]  I would love to know what it is.
[03:27:49.067 --> 03:27:51.750]  We've got to reconnect again for the final segment coming up.
[03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:56.935]  You've been with us for an hour now, or over an hour, and your phone faded out once.
[03:27:56.955 --> 03:27:57.876]  Now it's doing it again.
[03:27:58.257 --> 03:28:02.481]  So we're going to call you right back, Max, with a fresh line, because I want to hear these trends.
[03:28:02.501 --> 03:28:05.244]  We're not going to just get your predictions, but your trends.
[03:28:08.186 --> 03:28:12.348]  2011 coming up, and what people can individually do to respond to all this corruption.
[03:28:12.948 --> 03:28:23.592]  And there's now a new video out that we've got up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that I'm really hot to play after Max leaves us, coming up here in about 15 minutes or so.
[03:28:23.612 --> 03:28:27.774]  I want to play this video slash audio on air for all the listeners.
[03:28:28.154 --> 03:28:32.375]  But while we're waiting for Max to come back, let's get John in Georgia on.
[03:28:32.455 --> 03:28:33.296]  John, you're on the air.
[03:28:33.336 --> 03:28:33.696]  Go ahead.
[03:28:35.333 --> 03:28:36.573]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[03:28:36.754 --> 03:28:37.734]  I'm doing alright, sir.
[03:28:38.554 --> 03:28:43.016]  Good, I'm a long-time listener and long-time researcher and first-time caller.
[03:28:44.296 --> 03:28:49.799]  First of all, I wanted to make a couple of real quick points to Max Keiser, if he's back on.
[03:28:51.019 --> 03:28:56.361]  He mentioned the pollution, you know, involved with the bird incident.
[03:28:56.401 --> 03:29:03.844]  I wanted to just mention that the biggest polluters in history, of course, have traditionally been totalitarian governments.
[03:29:04.938 --> 03:29:06.320]  Yeah, look at Russia.
[03:29:07.021 --> 03:29:07.642]  Look at China.
[03:29:07.662 --> 03:29:08.804]  I mean, it's just, it's classic.
[03:29:09.741 --> 03:29:10.241]  Exactly.
[03:29:10.281 --> 03:29:23.904]  And the second point was he had advised some young, aspiring young journalist to purchase a new dictionary and I would revise that to say he needs to buy an 1848 Webster's Dictionary and he might get some accurate definition.
[03:29:24.025 --> 03:29:25.925]  I tell you what, John, stay there.
[03:29:26.025 --> 03:29:30.886]  Not only is John cogent and focused and well-spoken, he has something I don't ever really hear anymore.
[03:29:30.926 --> 03:29:32.547]  A telephone I can actually understand.
[03:29:32.587 --> 03:29:34.087]  This is magic right now.
[03:29:34.687 --> 03:29:35.567]  We're on the march.
[03:29:36.087 --> 03:29:37.588]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:38.616 --> 03:29:41.418]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:44.401 --> 03:29:48.264]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[03:29:48.324 --> 03:29:52.107]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[03:29:52.512 --> 03:29:56.975]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[03:29:57.236 --> 03:29:59.177]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[03:29:59.337 --> 03:30:00.638]  Made me feel breathless.
[03:30:01.039 --> 03:30:05.082]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[03:30:05.482 --> 03:30:06.503]  Nothing did anything.
[03:30:06.583 --> 03:30:10.526]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[03:30:10.546 --> 03:30:14.008]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[03:30:14.669 --> 03:30:17.311]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[03:30:17.751 --> 03:30:22.375]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[03:30:22.776 --> 03:30:25.358]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[03:30:25.578 --> 03:30:30.183]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[03:30:32.905 --> 03:30:34.386]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[03:30:44.975 --> 03:30:48.619]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:30:48.999 --> 03:30:52.003]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:30:52.243 --> 03:30:57.008]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:30:57.028 --> 03:31:03.255]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:03.435 --> 03:31:05.678]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:06.138 --> 03:31:06.378]  Tim Geithner?
[03:31:06.398 --> 03:31:06.578]  Bernanke?
[03:31:06.598 --> 03:31:06.958]  They're arsonists!
[03:31:07.018 --> 03:31:07.659]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:07.739 --> 03:31:09.419]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:25.106 --> 03:31:32.050]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:31:32.370 --> 03:31:41.496]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:31:43.377 --> 03:31:44.639]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.679 --> 03:31:50.026]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:31:50.266 --> 03:31:54.912]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:31:55.292 --> 03:31:55.693]  It's true.
[03:31:55.773 --> 03:32:00.338]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:32:00.859 --> 03:32:05.540]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:32:06.081 --> 03:32:08.001]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:32:08.401 --> 03:32:13.003]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:32:13.203 --> 03:32:14.103]  And here's the best part.
[03:32:14.323 --> 03:32:17.064]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:32:17.084 --> 03:32:20.665]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:32:21.005 --> 03:32:23.826]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:32:24.186 --> 03:32:26.066]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:32:26.407 --> 03:32:27.327]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:32:27.347 --> 03:32:27.527]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:32:27.547 --> 03:32:30.488]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:32:30.988 --> 03:32:32.748]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:33:00.899 --> 03:33:12.263]  Look, we talk about a lot of negative stuff here.
[03:33:13.844 --> 03:33:15.545]  But that overall is positive.
[03:33:15.765 --> 03:33:20.106]  If we don't expose the bad, then we can't protect the good.
[03:33:20.686 --> 03:33:21.667]  And I just want to say this.
[03:33:21.707 --> 03:33:22.967]  We have a wonderful planet.
[03:33:23.387 --> 03:33:24.928]  There are so many good people.
[03:33:25.428 --> 03:33:29.630]  There are so many beautiful and wonderful and honorable things in this world.
[03:33:30.566 --> 03:33:33.647]  My family is so great, my wife, my children.
[03:33:33.748 --> 03:33:36.949]  It is just magic and wonderful how good it is.
[03:33:37.569 --> 03:33:49.015]  And that's why I get disgusted and angry at the globalists, at the New World Order system, because I know they've made decisions to hate their fellow humankind and to do really bad things.
[03:33:49.195 --> 03:33:51.656]  I know they've committed crime upon crime upon crime.
[03:33:52.878 --> 03:33:53.798]  And I'm tired of them.
[03:33:54.658 --> 03:33:58.879]  But John in Georgia, we got Max back on another line from France.
[03:34:00.180 --> 03:34:03.680]  Restate your questions quickly, and then I want to get Max's take, and then you, Counterback.
[03:34:03.700 --> 03:34:04.040]  Go ahead.
[03:34:04.941 --> 03:34:05.341]  Okay.
[03:34:05.381 --> 03:34:07.901]  Well, I just wanted to make that point about the dictionary.
[03:34:07.921 --> 03:34:16.443]  You know, he recommended that to an aspiring young journalist, and I would recommend that he get an 1848 Webster's Dictionary, and he might have some accurate definitions.
[03:34:17.062 --> 03:34:19.364]  Yeah, they have been memory-holding a lot of the definitions.
[03:34:19.604 --> 03:34:27.369]  But you also wanted to point out that authoritarian systems always create the worst environments, where the Russians would just throw reactors in a lake.
[03:34:27.689 --> 03:34:30.231]  Communist Chinese, their rivers just set on fire.
[03:34:32.172 --> 03:34:33.393]  Was that directed at Max?
[03:34:33.633 --> 03:34:36.235]  Absolutely.
[03:34:36.255 --> 03:34:36.655]  Go ahead.
[03:34:40.123 --> 03:34:46.526]  Yeah, no, well, I mean, just talking about the dictionary immediately opened up a conversation about the dictionary.
[03:34:46.746 --> 03:34:49.488]  You know, so immediately the knowledge is infectious.
[03:34:49.728 --> 03:34:50.989]  So you're saying, oh, 1848 dictionary.
[03:34:51.029 --> 03:34:51.889]  Oh, OK, I will.
[03:34:51.989 --> 03:34:53.250]  I'm going to check it out.
[03:34:53.550 --> 03:34:54.690]  So this is what we're talking about.
[03:34:54.911 --> 03:35:04.455]  When you start talking about the actual words that go into the sentences, that go into the paragraphs, that go into the pages, that go into the essays, that go into the screens, that go into the Constitution, it all starts with words.
[03:35:04.796 --> 03:35:07.017]  And when you're talking about words, there's a place to go find words.
[03:35:07.077 --> 03:35:09.538]  Most people you talk to today who say, oh, I'm a journalist,
[03:35:09.898 --> 03:35:15.364]  They don't really know much about words, and yet words are the fundamental particle of the journalistic trade.
[03:35:15.664 --> 03:35:17.266]  So get familiar with words!
[03:35:20.549 --> 03:35:21.690]  Yes, interesting point, Max.
[03:35:21.731 --> 03:35:22.531]  Anything else, John?
[03:35:23.693 --> 03:35:27.797]  Oh yeah, the reason for my call initially, the Byrd story.
[03:35:29.278 --> 03:35:32.582]  I was watching NBC Nightly News last night with Brian Williams.
[03:35:33.582 --> 03:35:41.949]  And he, they were trying to find all these possible explanations for these tens of thousands of blackbirds dropping out of the air.
[03:35:41.989 --> 03:35:43.130]  And I'm from Arkansas.
[03:35:43.170 --> 03:35:43.871]  I grew up there.
[03:35:44.632 --> 03:35:49.916]  And of course, it's one of the greatest duck hunting states or places in North America.
[03:35:50.717 --> 03:35:55.701]  So, you know, I thought I'd, you know, he mentioned, what he mentioned just blew me away.
[03:35:55.741 --> 03:36:01.185]  He said that, well, it could be fireworks combined with celebratory
[03:36:02.656 --> 03:36:30.210]  uh... gunfire and when he came up with that i thought wow that's that's amazing yeah Arkansas is not is not Baghdad there is not celebratory fire going on celebratory gunfire that blew me away so I thought I'd tell you a story maybe you know a little bit uh... back in the nineteen seventies I lived on the left coast and I was a manufacturers rep for firearms manufacturers and one of the companies we represented was Beretta
[03:36:30.751 --> 03:36:51.746]  They make a very high quality line of high end fire shotguns and so occasionally we'd run across the buyer that we'd want to take back to Arkansas to go duck hunting and you know I thought to myself oh yeah you know we'd go out in those soybean fields and we'd pop out of the blinds and fire you know two or three shots because we had over and unders or plugged you know barrels but
[03:36:52.458 --> 03:36:53.899]  You know, it didn't take much.
[03:36:53.939 --> 03:36:54.660]  You couldn't miss.
[03:36:54.680 --> 03:36:59.323]  There'd be clouds of half a million that would darken the sky, and, you know, one shot would be enough.
[03:36:59.363 --> 03:37:03.045]  You know, the rest would all die of heart attacks, and we'd just be pelted and rained on.
[03:37:03.085 --> 03:37:05.187]  You know, it would destroy the cars and everything.
[03:37:05.927 --> 03:37:18.136]  And if you believe that, why... I just wanted to comment and say, no, this is absolutely insanity that they actually believe that the American public would accept a story like that.
[03:37:20.523 --> 03:37:21.144]  Well, you're right.
[03:37:21.464 --> 03:37:22.725]  Max, what's your take on that?
[03:37:23.966 --> 03:37:25.347]  Well, you know, look this up.
[03:37:25.667 --> 03:37:28.229]  I think a lot of you will find this very fascinating.
[03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:31.312]  Do you remember that show, Flipper, on TV with the dolphin?
[03:37:34.735 --> 03:37:36.717]  Well, look, I mean, I know about... No, let me finish.
[03:37:36.877 --> 03:37:39.018]  Do you remember that show, Flipper, on TV?
[03:37:39.079 --> 03:37:40.880]  Yeah, I thought you were asking a question.
[03:37:40.920 --> 03:37:41.400]  Go ahead, yes.
[03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:42.321]  Yeah, okay.
[03:37:43.142 --> 03:37:47.886]  Flipper, at the end of his life, a lot of people don't realize this, but Flipper committed suicide.
[03:37:48.997 --> 03:37:51.019]  Flipper the Dolphin committed suicide.
[03:37:51.799 --> 03:37:56.103]  Animals can commit, look it up on Google, you'll find out that Flipper committed suicide.
[03:37:56.463 --> 03:37:58.285]  Animals commit suicide.
[03:37:58.325 --> 03:38:01.567]  Yeah, well, birds will pull their feathers out and pick themselves to death.
[03:38:01.627 --> 03:38:04.089]  I've had it with humans, and they're committing suicide.
[03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.830]  They've had it.
[03:38:04.890 --> 03:38:05.651]  They're sick of us.
[03:38:05.891 --> 03:38:10.955]  And they'd rather kill themselves than live another day with these disgusting pig human beings.
[03:38:11.555 --> 03:38:12.756]  Max, let me ask you a question.
[03:38:12.816 --> 03:38:16.319]  How do the birds pulverize their organs into liquid blood?
[03:38:16.739 --> 03:38:18.741]  They're claiming just bumping into each other would do this.
[03:38:19.061 --> 03:38:23.444]  I've shot plenty of dove and quail about the same size as these starlings.
[03:38:24.124 --> 03:38:31.109]  And let me just tell you, when little bee bees hit them with a lot more force than birds colliding, nothing turns to mush.
[03:38:31.290 --> 03:38:32.851]  It just shoots little holes through them.
[03:38:34.052 --> 03:38:36.514]  And then you take the breast out and marinate it and cook it.
[03:38:36.894 --> 03:38:38.055]  I mean, this is impossible.
[03:38:38.095 --> 03:38:43.159]  This liquefying of the organs, unless they had Ebola, and they don't have any disease.
[03:38:43.399 --> 03:38:45.881]  This is a real whodunit mystery here.
[03:38:46.102 --> 03:38:47.443]  What do you think's going on, John?
[03:38:47.643 --> 03:38:48.824]  Do you think Al Qaeda did it?
[03:38:49.622 --> 03:38:55.828]  I was joking, you know, about the gunfire and thinking that they would, you know, just masses would die of heart attacks.
[03:38:55.848 --> 03:38:57.509]  That's just absolutely ludicrous.
[03:38:57.569 --> 03:39:04.216]  But anyway, what I think did it, I think chemtrails are doing it, if you want my honest opinion.
[03:39:04.676 --> 03:39:08.640]  They're spraying aluminum oxide, barium, and strontium into the atmosphere.
[03:39:08.680 --> 03:39:11.242]  You can test the snow on Mount Shasta and find it.
[03:39:11.602 --> 03:39:15.346]  You can test it in, because that's the water supply for Northern California.
[03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:17.090]  And you can test it.
[03:39:17.230 --> 03:39:19.491]  There's been several places that it's been tested.
[03:39:19.531 --> 03:39:23.373]  And of course, you know, when they get caught, they claim they're not doing it.
[03:39:23.413 --> 03:39:24.633]  They're just planning to do it.
[03:39:24.693 --> 03:39:31.096]  Or they say that, well, you know, maybe we're trying to prevent global warming or whatever excuse they can.
[03:39:31.816 --> 03:39:38.586]  You know, the real reason, you know, the real motivation is absolutely that they want to do damage to the health of the average American person.
[03:39:38.606 --> 03:39:43.052]  Well, they're a bunch of chicken-neck eugenics lunatics like John P. Holdren.
[03:39:43.112 --> 03:39:44.815]  I mean, they put on TV ads.
[03:39:44.835 --> 03:39:46.056]  I had an article about this yesterday.
[03:39:46.076 --> 03:39:46.737]  I didn't get to it.
[03:39:47.378 --> 03:39:55.607]  Where they're now airing other ads where they're blowing kids up in school, they don't accept carbon taxes, where people are murdered.
[03:39:55.688 --> 03:40:01.414]  I mean, they're really pumping this anti-human view, and I understand Max
[03:40:02.435 --> 03:40:06.918]  He's angry about real, you know, legitimate decadence that's disgusting to all of us.
[03:40:06.998 --> 03:40:11.801]  But, I mean, I think empowering and uplifting humanity is the answer.
[03:40:11.841 --> 03:40:12.942]  I appreciate your call, John.
[03:40:13.282 --> 03:40:15.483]  Max, what do you see as the big trends in 2011?
[03:40:15.783 --> 03:40:18.285]  I mean, really getting mining down into brass tacks.
[03:40:18.965 --> 03:40:22.888]  What do you think the best investments are from a Max Keiserian perspective?
[03:40:23.803 --> 03:40:36.570]  Well, you know, just to follow up, you know, right now in the Southern Ocean, in Antarctica, the Sea Shepherd, which is a group of conservationists, are doing battle against Japanese whalers.
[03:40:37.011 --> 03:40:44.455]  Now, they've taken the fight right to the Japanese whalers on behalf of their clients, as they call them, the whales.
[03:40:45.285 --> 03:40:49.669]  That's the kind of direct action needed to protect the animal species.
[03:40:49.729 --> 03:40:57.417]  Because the animal species, as Einstein said about the bees, Einstein made a very famous quote about the bee population.
[03:40:57.697 --> 03:41:04.524]  If the bee population were to go extinct, humans would become extinct within, I think he said, something like two or three years.
[03:41:05.124 --> 03:41:06.546]  And this is what we're talking about.
[03:41:06.566 --> 03:41:19.297]  The bees cross-fertilize the agricultural products, and Monsanto is never going to come up with synthetic food to replace the entire ecosystem that's been in place for millions of years that we rely on for life.
[03:41:19.317 --> 03:41:24.862]  And direct action, like Captain Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd in the Southern Ocean is doing right now.
[03:41:24.922 --> 03:41:27.465]  They've got a brilliant show about this on Animal Planet.
[03:41:27.825 --> 03:41:37.573]  Well, I do agree that wiping out the elephants and the whales is abhorrent, but then they just get everybody upset with Animal Planet and then turn loose the
[03:41:49.082 --> 03:41:56.086]  You know, local animal police on you, who come and, you know, take your dog and euthanize it because it's barking.
[03:41:56.106 --> 03:41:59.689]  I mean, you know, there's a more sophisticated propaganda going on here.
[03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:17.920]  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, if you look at the individual cells of, you know, dog ownership and people have pets and it's, and the city is divided into various wardens in, you know, America.
[03:42:18.340 --> 03:42:24.765]  You can't compare that to the ecosystem of the globe and humanity's history on this globe.
[03:42:25.125 --> 03:42:29.509]  There's a symbiotic relationship between people and the environment.
[03:42:29.809 --> 03:42:44.680]  And you can't synthetically wedge yourself in between you and the environment with these synthetic food products and synthetic intellectual products without causing incredible species-wide dangerous situations like we're having now.
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:46.762]  Entire species are going extinct.
[03:42:47.302 --> 03:42:48.183]  Well, more than pollution!
[03:43:09.438 --> 03:43:10.919]  Yeah, Max, more than pollution.
[03:43:10.939 --> 03:43:11.100]  Sure.
[03:43:28.715 --> 03:43:29.196]  Sure, Max.
[03:43:29.216 --> 03:43:31.158]  I need to put something in here, though.
[03:43:43.505 --> 03:43:45.166]  I agree with a lot of what you're saying.
[03:43:45.186 --> 03:43:46.787]  I mean, it's common sense, much of it.
[03:43:47.247 --> 03:44:11.463]  The issue is, they are very intelligent and know that, so they've cornered the market and control the environmental movement, and the megacorporations that own the media spew a environmental-oid version of what you're saying that gives them more power to divert off into environmental solutions that don't actually fix anything, which you agreed with
[03:44:12.624 --> 03:44:18.288]  I mean, you understand that that's going on, but my bigger issue is not even so much pollution.
[03:44:18.368 --> 03:44:19.068]  I don't want to drink it.
[03:44:19.128 --> 03:44:19.749]  I don't want to breathe it.
[03:44:20.129 --> 03:44:22.551]  I know, ultimately, that it bioaccumulates.
[03:44:23.539 --> 03:44:27.901]  In Homo Sapiens Sapien, top of the food chain, and we're getting people getting Alzheimer's at 25.
[03:44:28.602 --> 03:44:32.984]  I understand this is really bad, bioaccumulation of heavy metals, but the Earth can deal with that.
[03:44:33.464 --> 03:44:43.949]  What it can't deal with is some type of mishap, which the physicists admit could happen with a strangelet or other things, with the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider, or with the genetic engineering.
[03:44:44.229 --> 03:44:51.773]  I mean, those are the areas where I've really done the study, and it's a mathematical probability that the more they do this, just open and wildly,
[03:44:52.313 --> 03:44:56.976]  The closer we are to not becoming a Type 1 civilization.
[03:44:57.737 --> 03:45:04.801]  Okay, so the issue is, how do you avoid becoming like a whack-a-mole situation?
[03:45:04.821 --> 03:45:10.005]  Because as you know, when you attack one of these guys, they pop up somewhere else.
[03:45:10.445 --> 03:45:18.070]  And what I've been saying all along, is if you go up the food chain, and you find out who's funding these guys, that takes you to the banks.
[03:45:18.891 --> 03:45:22.756]  And then you look at the banks, and you say, well, how can we attack the banks?
[03:45:23.137 --> 03:45:27.283]  And that's what ended up with the Crash JPMorgan Buy Silver campaign.
[03:45:27.503 --> 03:45:29.186]  Because we analyzed the situation.
[03:45:29.406 --> 03:45:33.432]  We said, who's funding these New World Order corporate no-goodniks?
[03:45:33.772 --> 03:45:42.561]  We figured out it was the banks, and there is one bank that is particularly vulnerable, JP Morgan, its silver position, and that resonated with people around the world.
[03:45:42.641 --> 03:45:47.366]  As you know, hundreds of videos have been made, people have been buying silver, and there's very little of it around.
[03:45:47.386 --> 03:45:53.472]  There's only maybe $20 billion worth of silver available for purchase, which is a fantastically small amount.
[03:45:53.912 --> 03:46:04.157]  And as my interview on this week's show said, David Morgan, for every physical ounce you take off the market, you are killing 100 paper ounces on the balance sheet of the bank.
[03:46:04.577 --> 03:46:10.040]  So that's my thought in terms of how to cut the head of the snake.
[03:46:10.180 --> 03:46:19.384]  The head of the snake, instead of playing whack-a-mole and just saying they're doing this bad and this bad and this bad, they all come down funding from the bank.
[03:46:20.044 --> 03:46:42.086]  Well sure Max, I had you on the show to launch all that, but at the same time it's good to go after big heads of the Hydra, but you've also got to wake up the general population to the wider paradigm, or you cut off one big head of JPMorgan Chase, if you haven't cut the heart out, it's just going to regenerate another slathering head that you've got to deal with.
[03:46:42.746 --> 03:46:48.891]  My thought on that is what we lack are wins.
[03:46:49.431 --> 03:46:50.412]  What I would call a win.
[03:46:50.432 --> 03:46:51.913]  What I would call a touchdown.
[03:46:51.973 --> 03:46:53.294]  Yeah, but what do you call a win?
[03:46:53.334 --> 03:46:58.178]  We blew that fake carbon credit tax thing out of the water and proved that
[03:46:58.878 --> 03:47:00.739]  Their whole climate change thing is a fraud.
[03:47:01.060 --> 03:47:03.461]  You don't believe that, because I think you've invested in it.
[03:47:03.701 --> 03:47:07.063]  Kind of like, and none of us are perfect, you kind of believed in Obama up front.
[03:47:07.344 --> 03:47:09.885]  I mean, maybe Max, I respect you, think you're a smart guy.
[03:47:09.905 --> 03:47:16.750]  We all have different perspectives, but maybe some of us that don't totally agree with you, maybe, maybe, maybe we got a few brain cells too, hmm?
[03:47:17.410 --> 03:47:24.314]  Well, the win that I would put in the column in the last six months would be the TSA scandal.
[03:47:24.414 --> 03:47:28.377]  Because clearly, through public pressure, that looks like a big win.
[03:47:28.397 --> 03:47:31.178]  Yeah, another torpedo we launched here on this show.
[03:47:32.279 --> 03:47:33.200]  It is another issue.
[03:47:33.260 --> 03:47:35.961]  But the TSA, I would say, is definitely a win.
[03:47:36.242 --> 03:47:38.323]  The Obama deception?
[03:47:38.863 --> 03:47:39.564]  Brilliant film.
[03:47:39.884 --> 03:47:40.304]  You're right.
[03:47:40.704 --> 03:47:48.230]  I gave Obama the benefit of the doubt and it turns out that the Obama deception film that you made was dead on accurate.
[03:47:48.270 --> 03:47:51.112]  The guy is a total puppet of the banking system.
[03:47:51.472 --> 03:47:54.214]  But I guess I misspoke by saying you don't have...
[03:47:54.754 --> 03:47:55.315]  Any wins.
[03:47:55.335 --> 03:48:01.922]  What I'm saying is that it would be nice to take down a $150 billion corporation.
[03:48:02.103 --> 03:48:03.204]  A major win.
[03:48:03.244 --> 03:48:04.525]  Let's put it that way.
[03:48:04.545 --> 03:48:05.586]  A big score.
[03:48:05.947 --> 03:48:08.750]  Because these guys are scoring heavily against us.
[03:48:09.210 --> 03:48:10.272]  I'd love to see us
[03:48:10.912 --> 03:48:27.738]  Really take down a hundred and fifty billion dollar corporation that would give everyone so much Positive energy and it would just get so much momentum behind that then we can then go after some of these other guys But if we get that big win Alex, I think it will just energize folks
[03:48:28.118 --> 03:48:29.038]  Sure, I totally agree.
[03:48:29.058 --> 03:48:35.659]  I mean the TSA thing is a big win because it just showed us we can stand up and say no and that we're the majority and we have common sense.
[03:48:35.699 --> 03:48:36.600]  That's just one battle.
[03:48:36.620 --> 03:48:37.520]  We haven't won that war.
[03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:54.163]  I think your silver thing's a great idea and it's got titanic legs and it's really scaring the system and I think overall a lot of positive things are starting to happen, Max, and you know that's why I try to bring on the Ron Pauls and the Max Keisers and the Jesse Venturas and countless others and
[03:48:55.263 --> 03:49:01.430]  Because I see so much understanding, so many different perspectives, that together are moving in the right direction.
[03:49:01.450 --> 03:49:08.657]  It doesn't mean we're all on the exact same page, but we're certainly not part of this cold-blooded, corporate, globalist, dehumanizing Borg.
[03:49:09.098 --> 03:49:13.743]  We're definitely moving away from that together, and then having a spirited debate on the way.
[03:49:13.783 --> 03:49:17.026]  And by the way, the top link on InfoWars.com
[03:49:17.927 --> 03:49:19.990]  26 brilliant minutes of exciting television!
[03:49:33.490 --> 03:49:34.111]  Absolutely.
[03:49:34.731 --> 03:49:40.756]  I'm not trying to belittle anyone's efforts here.
[03:49:40.796 --> 03:49:54.026]  I'm just saying that when I see birds falling out of the sky and thousands of fish washing up on the shore and the bee population going extinct, I'm just thinking the timeline is getting awfully close.
[03:49:54.106 --> 03:49:55.327]  I mean, how close do we want to come?
[03:49:56.709 --> 03:50:00.955]  I'm telling you, Max, I've done the research.
[03:50:01.255 --> 03:50:10.168]  They are trying to cause an environmental collapse to then offer a great green tyranny on top of it, and then they believe they can remake anything.
[03:50:11.329 --> 03:50:24.411]  In their image, through the genetic engineering, I had an IBM person tell me once that there is no such thing as a genetic malfunction because humans came from the earth and so we can do whatever we want and then it's part of a natural mutation because we did it.
[03:50:24.791 --> 03:50:26.212]  I mean, we are in crisis.
[03:50:26.252 --> 03:50:28.432]  Everybody can feel it in their gut, see it intellectually.
[03:50:28.452 --> 03:50:32.393]  I'm going to come back and play a key video, The Madness of a Lost Society Part 2.
[03:50:32.473 --> 03:50:33.193]  Very powerful.
[03:50:33.573 --> 03:50:35.373]  Max, we really appreciate you joining us.
[03:50:35.413 --> 03:50:35.913]  God bless you.
[03:50:35.933 --> 03:50:37.354]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[03:50:37.694 --> 03:50:39.314]  Key new video coming up.

[03:51:32.101 --> 03:51:37.543]  Biosafe1, the guaranteed, bio-friendly, money-saving way to clean your septic system.
[03:51:43.869 --> 03:51:45.010]  A very wealthy U.S.
[03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:51.757]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:51:52.018 --> 03:51:54.300]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:51:54.580 --> 03:51:59.786]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:51:59.986 --> 03:52:02.787]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:52:02.927 --> 03:52:05.068]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:52:05.268 --> 03:52:11.230]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:14.751]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:52:14.931 --> 03:52:20.493]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:52:20.753 --> 03:52:22.073]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:52:22.393 --> 03:52:23.574]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:52:23.714 --> 03:52:26.254]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:52:26.394 --> 03:52:27.815]  He explains everything you need to know.
[03:52:28.095 --> 03:52:30.459]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:52:30.639 --> 03:52:35.066]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:52:35.186 --> 03:52:37.670]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[03:52:43.874 --> 03:52:46.096]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[03:52:46.356 --> 03:52:50.460]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze-Dry Guy.

[03:53:33.221 --> 03:53:34.443]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:53:34.463 --> 03:53:35.444]  The best you can buy.
[03:53:44.170 --> 03:53:46.191]  We warned you that something was wrong.
[03:53:46.291 --> 03:53:51.392]  According to some estimates, we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions.
[03:53:51.712 --> 03:53:53.393]  That investigations were needed.
[03:53:53.713 --> 03:53:57.414]  Amazing, incredible that you were for the third time today.
[03:53:57.694 --> 03:53:59.375]  That our liberties were under attack.
[03:54:00.015 --> 03:54:02.977]  That the very fabric of our republic was being ripped apart.
[03:54:03.037 --> 03:54:04.558]  Report suspicious activity.
[03:54:04.679 --> 03:54:10.283]  And as a nation, we turned our back on our values, our principles, and our moral obligations.
[03:54:10.783 --> 03:54:16.187]  We allowed torture, we encouraged war, and we slept well as our nation was raped.
[03:54:16.687 --> 03:54:22.950]  Will you tell the American people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars?
[03:54:23.370 --> 03:54:27.873]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks, any bank that has access to the U.S.
[03:54:28.213 --> 03:54:29.053]  Federal Reserve's discount.
[03:54:29.073 --> 03:54:29.914]  Will you tell us who they are?
[03:54:31.094 --> 03:54:31.274]  No.
[03:54:31.734 --> 03:54:34.216]  Now, the day of reckoning is nearly upon us.
[03:54:34.576 --> 03:54:36.197]  And still, we warn you.
[03:54:36.337 --> 03:54:38.398]  We're heading for a hyperinflationary depression.
[03:54:38.738 --> 03:54:41.299]  This is the madness of a lost society.
[03:54:41.679 --> 03:54:42.560]  Final warnings.
[03:54:44.665 --> 03:54:46.186]  Well, we're heading for hyperinflation.
[03:54:46.366 --> 03:54:48.868]  The hard choices should have been made years ago.
[03:54:49.008 --> 03:54:54.652]  The Federal Reserve is borrowing $100 billion every 30 days.
[03:54:54.912 --> 03:55:01.516]  You could cut every penny of government spending, except for Social Security and Medicare, and you'd still be in deficit.
[03:55:01.677 --> 03:55:05.099]  The end game is everybody has zero purchasing power currency.
[03:55:05.379 --> 03:55:06.259]  Does this scare you?
[03:55:06.559 --> 03:55:08.280]  It ought to scare the pants off of you.
[03:55:08.380 --> 03:55:08.720]  The U.S.
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:14.681]  will be defaulting on its debt in the next five years because the numbers are so staggering.
[03:55:14.701 --> 03:55:18.242]  The world is going to go into a hyperinflationary depression everywhere.
[03:55:18.562 --> 03:55:23.704]  We have to have the deficit under control now if we want to avoid a hyperinflation.
[03:55:24.164 --> 03:55:24.884]  It's not going to happen.
[03:55:25.164 --> 03:55:29.725]  And there will be a global run to hard assets and it has already begun.
[03:55:29.965 --> 03:55:31.506]  I'm not saying this will scare you.
[03:55:32.226 --> 03:55:33.206]  Quite to the contrary.
[03:55:33.486 --> 03:55:39.048]  The government doesn't have the ability to raise taxes to pay for its needs, so what it does is it prints money.
[03:55:39.508 --> 03:55:41.689]  It gives you inflation, eventually hyperinflation.
[03:55:42.089 --> 03:55:42.409]  The U.S.
[03:55:42.449 --> 03:55:43.569]  dollar becomes worthless.
[03:55:44.089 --> 03:55:49.171]  I don't want you to prepare and spare yourself heartache and save your dinner table.
[03:55:49.371 --> 03:55:52.692]  That's the only reason I'm telling you these things, not to keep you awake at night.
[03:55:53.052 --> 03:55:56.493]  My contention now is that we're beyond control, we're beyond containment.
[03:55:56.793 --> 03:55:58.954]  The world has never seen what they're going to see.
[03:55:59.114 --> 03:56:01.094]  People ask me, you know, when is it all going to start?
[03:56:01.174 --> 03:56:05.396]  The question I ask in return is, what's it going to take for you to notice it's happening?
[03:56:05.676 --> 03:56:11.498]  There's nothing they can do to prevent hyperinflation here at an ultimate economic collapse.
[03:56:11.538 --> 03:56:11.918]  They know it.
[03:56:13.669 --> 03:56:16.530]  They immediately want America to collapse.
[03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:17.691]  I have been told this.
[03:56:17.891 --> 03:56:18.991]  They're just buying time.
[03:56:19.151 --> 03:56:22.733]  They're trying to push the bad news off as far as they can into the future.
[03:56:23.173 --> 03:56:28.215]  Would you like to know exactly what's going to happen so that you can spare your assets?
[03:56:28.435 --> 03:56:31.896]  Because the fact of the matter is, it's already unraveling.
[03:56:32.196 --> 03:56:34.057]  The deficit of $4-5 trillion.
[03:56:34.497 --> 03:56:37.758]  Let's say the government wanted to resolve the issue of taxes.
[03:56:38.018 --> 03:56:40.760]  It could raise personal income taxes to take 100%.
[03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:45.323]  Of individual income, it could take 100% of corporate profits.
[03:56:45.924 --> 03:56:47.265]  And you'd still be in deficit.
[03:56:47.506 --> 03:56:53.632]  If you look at the price of silver, for example, the low in silver was around $7 an ounce during the 08 crisis.
[03:56:54.012 --> 03:56:55.554]  Silver recently touched $30.
[03:56:55.734 --> 03:57:01.940]  There is no explanation for the move in silver outside of a global move away from the dollar.
[03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:03.602]  And that is absolutely happening.
[03:57:03.682 --> 03:57:04.723]  It's happening right now.
[03:57:04.983 --> 03:57:17.847]  As interest rates rise, the interest expense goes up, causing a bigger deficit, causing the government to borrow more, causing the Federal Reserve to do additional quantitative easing, further debasing the dollar, and ultimately meaning higher gold and silver prices.
[03:57:18.167 --> 03:57:20.968]  The dollar is going to have a severe sell-off at some point here.
[03:57:21.248 --> 03:57:30.892]  A panic sell-off, and along with that, you're going to see a sharp spike in precious metals as they tend to preserve the purchasing power of the dollars that go into them.
[03:57:31.732 --> 03:57:33.153]  This stuff is actually pretty simple.
[03:57:33.293 --> 03:57:36.654]  You want to own energy, agriculture and sound money.
[03:57:36.874 --> 03:57:40.096]  He said, get out of anything that is paper.
[03:57:40.276 --> 03:57:41.777]  Now, do you realize what that means?
[03:57:42.317 --> 03:57:51.241]  Unfortunately, my experience has been people won't take simple steps to protect themselves because they can't imagine the future changing as much as it's going to.
[03:57:51.441 --> 03:57:53.542]  You've got to make preparations right now.
[03:57:54.403 --> 03:57:57.365]  This quantitative easing, official debasement of the U.S.
[03:57:57.405 --> 03:57:59.687]  dollar, is beginning to have its effect.
[03:57:59.847 --> 03:58:09.674]  If you look at the amount of money that's been created over the last five years, to accomplish a 10% gold-backed currency, the price of gold would have to be around $10,000 an ounce.
[03:58:09.955 --> 03:58:12.817]  There's nothing they can do that's going to turn this economy around.
[03:58:13.357 --> 03:58:18.260]  Shy of shutting down the entitlement system, there's nothing they're gonna do to prevent the hyperinflation.
[03:58:18.660 --> 03:58:24.203]  The madness of a lost society, the rest of it is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:24.363 --> 03:58:29.325]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:30.346 --> 03:58:33.227]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:33.828 --> 03:58:36.149]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:38.390]  We are part of a new world order.
