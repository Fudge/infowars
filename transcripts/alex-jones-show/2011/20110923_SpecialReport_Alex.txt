[00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.647]  Is this the first time you've ever seen the mural?
[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:09.070]  No, actually I live here so I come through and check it out every now and then.
[00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.872]  I've taken pictures, I read about it online, looked it up.
[00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:14.493]  What do you think it means?
[00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:18.156]  I can only tell you what I read.
[00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:24.960]  Basically it seems like there's a soldier cutting through the dove of peace and his sword is an Arabian sword.
[00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.202]  I'm not sure about the
[00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:29.760]  I think it's very well done.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.400]  It's impactful.
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.741]  The color scheme is great.
[00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.904]  The theme seems a little austere for an airport.
[00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:57.268]  You don't think there's a nefarious hidden agenda, hidden meaning behind it or anything like that?
[00:00:57.288 --> 00:00:57.829]  I don't know.
[00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.189]  I've heard that theory a lot.
[00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.351]  Maybe, you know, underground prisons under Denver or DIA, all that stuff.
[00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:05.671]  Could be.
[00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:06.912]  I'm a little skeptical.
[00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:08.892]  So this is the first time you've ever seen this mural?
[00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:10.473]  Yeah, the first time I've ever seen it.
[00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:11.433]  Let's take a look.
[00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:14.354]  I mean, what are your thoughts when you look at something like that?
[00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.735]  Do you think it's kind of an odd mural to be put in an airport?
[00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:18.956]  Not necessarily.
[00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.316]  I think it explains a lot.
[00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:22.197]  Okay, such as?
[00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:26.568]  Such as just, you know, I mean, America and everything else.
[00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:32.351]  There's a lot going on in the world right now, and it pretty much shows what's going on.
[00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:40.116]  You know, there's a knight, he's taking care of things, there's people that are suffering, and he looks like he's taking over and taking care of it.
[00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:42.818]  So he's like a protector, you think?
[00:01:42.898 --> 00:01:44.599]  I think he's a protector, you know?
[00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.742]  I mean, you're wearing a gas mask and you have a sword in your hand, what else are you doing?
[00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.734]  Is this the first time you've ever seen the mural?
[00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:52.514]  Yes it is.
[00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:54.494]  I've seen it on the internet before.
[00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:58.336]  Alright, so you've seen it on the internet and then I saw you turn the corner and you're like, oh my god, here it is.
[00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.556]  So, alright, so what are your thoughts on it?
[00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:09.259]  I've heard some theories where there's like an underground facility in this airport and it's just like really dark and kind of scary looking.
[00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.660]  It is a little creepy looking.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.840]  Machine gun wielding.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.601]  And the crying innocence in the background.
[00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:17.321]  Yeah, it's kind of creepy.
[00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.002]  Like fleeing?
[00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:23.553]  It's just, I mean, this is kind of sad, obviously.
[00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:34.295]  A kid who died in Auschwitz, 14 years old, that, you know, basically their childhood was taken away from them through everything they went through, it looks like.
[00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:42.616]  You know, they hate, they hate enemies, they hope that one day they'll be able to wake up and laugh again.
[00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.597]  It's sad that there's people out there that think like that.
[00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:47.617]  Some people say it's put here to kind of get
[00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.972]  Distract people from what really goes on in D.I.A.
[00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:56.075]  Don't you think it's an odd place to put a mural like this in an international airport?
[00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.295]  I mean, it's kind of weird, isn't it?
[00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:57.976]  It is.
[00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:02.979]  If you wanted to send a message to someone, I mean, it's kind of the best place.
[00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.361]  So do you think this is more of an artistic endeavor, you know, with the symbolism and everything?
[00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:11.263]  You know, this guy kind of looks like a Nazi, but is there any hidden meanings?
[00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:12.964]  A dark hidden meaning?
[00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.846]  Or is this more kind of an artistic piece, you know?
[00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:24.840]  I think, I don't, I'm not someone who looks at things in a dark, hidden type of way, so to me, I don't look at it like that.
[00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:28.323]  You know, the most disturbing piece of this whole thing is just that.
[00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:30.304]  That's what gets me the most.
[00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:34.126]  What about the rumors that there's a whole underground type of bunker here?
[00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:35.307]  Have you heard of those as well?
[00:03:35.327 --> 00:03:36.007]  I've heard of those.
[00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:38.569]  Do you think there's any truth to that?
[00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.850]  Definitely.
[00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.570]  Possible.
[00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.992]  More possible than what they give you on the news.
[00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:46.254]  It looks funny the way that you can see when you're coming in.
[00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:54.671]  You can see that there's construction's been over for years here, but there's construction everywhere, all over, going on, on the grounds of the airport.
[00:03:55.671 --> 00:04:06.973]  Constantly, and you can see them actually working up, because once it's a hill, and they'll have a road that goes around it, and you come back a year later, and there's two roads, because the hill's kind of moved up, as if the hills are expanding upwards.
[00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:11.054]  Do you think it's an odd place to have a mural like this in an international airport?
[00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:11.774]  Absolutely.
[00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:13.014]  Absolutely.
[00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:15.835]  I don't know what its place is here, or why it's here.
[00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:20.176]  It's definitely not something you expect to see walking through an airport though.
