[00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:05.607]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:07.307]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:09.188]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:10.648]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:12.348]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.570]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:25.895]  We're good to go.
[00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:26.376]  I think?
[00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:50.702]  Military source who's given us a lot of really good information over the years that integrates him with other information we're getting from other sources will be popping in for about 10-15 minutes.
[00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:56.125]  At the bottom of the hour, Colonel Six, he's been a caller to the show and made a lot of predictions here that have come true.
[00:00:56.145 --> 00:01:03.110]  He's going to be popping in with the latest on the supposed group of SEAL Team Six people being killed a few days ago.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.701]  And all of the suspicious circumstances surrounding that.
[00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:10.822]  Another reported helicopter crash today over in Afghanistan.
[00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:18.985]  Webster Griffin Tarpley will be joining us to break down the S&P downgrade of the U.S.
[00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:27.969]  Treasuries and the credit rating of the United States that's now triggering downgrades, of course, at the state level and local level, as we told you it would.
[00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:29.069]  We've been positioned...
[00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.869]  For decades into total bankruptcy.
[00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:38.590]  The Federal Reserve first used us as a base of operations to give them military and political muscle globally.
[00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:41.871]  Now they're killing the golden goose because they're done with us.
[00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:47.492]  It's a scorched earth policy, bringing us deeper into financial tyranny.
[00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:59.234]  And then we have Nomi Prince, who, of course, herself was a high-level banker in her own right.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.621]  And she's going to be joining us to go over the latest developments in the economy.
[00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:17.264]  And then, of course, Dr. Steve Pachinik is going to be coming on because I want to get his view on the Navy SEAL situation.
[00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:21.965]  I don't know what his views are going to be, just like I didn't know what his view would be when I called him up.
[00:02:23.137 --> 00:02:30.620]  To get him on about the Norway shooting, even though some of you disagree with his views, and I think overall I don't concur with everything he's saying.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.902]  When I call up a guest to get the perspective, I don't call up and say, what's your view?
[00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.123]  And then if they don't agree with me, well, I'm just not going to have you on now.
[00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:46.006]  I have them on to genuinely see what they have to say, and so you can see what they have to say, and so we can debate it and discuss it.
[00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:49.307]  That's why sometimes you'll see divergent views and ideas here.
[00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:51.148]  This is not a radio show where...
[00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:53.881]  We're good to go.
[00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:54.161]  I think?
[00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.691]  We've got some other good news in all the bad news.
[00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:34.357]  Al Gore talked to the Aspen Institute, big globalist think tank, and it was documented by press that was allowed in that he completely blew up and said that their whole fraud of global carbon taxes and the rest of it is basically destroyed.
[00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:42.164]  And you've got the Rasmussen poll out last week where 69% of Americans believe scientists have been paid to basically lie.
[00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:45.965]  Well, they've been caught lying under government funding.
[00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:51.587]  So very exciting news there from Mark Moreno at Climate Depot.
[00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:54.488]  That's up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:57.169]  And I want to get Mark on later in the week if we can.
[00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:06.671]  To go over some of that, because it shows no matter how big these frauds are, and they're going to keep going ahead with it, but it's limping, it's on fire, it's bleeding out.
[00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:14.253]  But a dead elephant being dropped on you can still take you out, so they're not going to stop, but we're definitely slowing them down and having victories.
[00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:16.573]  We can do this on the war on terror fraud.
[00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:20.674]  We can do this when they tried to push torture and get us to accept torture as good.
[00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:23.935]  Nobody really bought it, so they had to stop that, at least on the surface.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.622]  The Federal Reserve is incredibly unpopular.
[00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:32.646]  Over 80% and most polls want it abolished or at least audited.
[00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:37.250]  We're winning the info war, as Hillary Clinton had to admit with horror.
[00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.232]  Pre-humanity worldwide is waking up.
[00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:41.293]  We're having a huge effect.
[00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:43.640]  There's so many other victories we're having.
[00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:54.249]  But let me get into the hardcore news, the economic news, straight ahead on the other side and what this downgrade means, right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.110]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.851]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:57.612]  We're simulcasting the radio at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:00.814]  We're good to go.

[00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:22.317]  Chaga is good for your heart and even helps support healthy arteries.
[00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:27.981]  Wild birch extract is the top source of betulin, a natural sterol needed by every cell of the body.
[00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.443]  And healthy cells mean a healthy body and a more powerful you.
[00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.865]  No wonder it's known as a king of all herbs.

[00:05:44.013 --> 00:05:44.853]  You deserve it!

[00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:07.749]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:19.062]  The Alex Jones Show
[00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.723]  You're watching an InfoWars.com special report.
[00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:33.747]  The stock market has tanked more than 500 additional points today, a total of 519 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:40.889]  On news, the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at zero or below for the next two years.
[00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:50.685]  There are riots and demonstrations taking place across the world, from Israel to England, and a massive increase in crime here in the United States.
[00:06:51.265 --> 00:07:00.527]  Joining us to break down exactly what this means and what's coming in the short and long-term future is Max Keiser of MaxKaiser.com.
[00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:06.848]  He is a former stock trader and, of course, the inventor of the virtual trading system, the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[00:07:07.128 --> 00:07:10.189]  And he joins us because he's predicted with great precision
[00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.910]  Much of what has now unfolded.
[00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.951]  Max Keiser joining us from Paris.
[00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:15.992]  Thanks for being with us.
[00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:17.072]  Sure, Alex.
[00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:17.533]  Anytime.
[00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:18.133]  Great to be here.
[00:07:18.753 --> 00:07:31.580]  Well, my friend, break down what we're seeing in the markets right now, what's happening with Bank of America, other bank stocks, and what this signifies to have the Fed announcing that interest rates will be held where they are for the next two years.
[00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:51.156]  Well, you mentioned the Fed talking about keeping interest rates near zero for another two years, and talking actually about alternative ways to juice the economy, monetarily speaking, which includes such things as negative interest rates we can get to in a second.
[00:07:51.217 --> 00:08:01.424]  But this whole giving way, monetary easing, typically markets would go up on that news, and as you see, markets are going down on that news.
[00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:17.961]  This is because after 20 years, 25 years of creating this massive Ponzi scheme of cheap money and creating a GDP in America that's tied to the banking system that's tied to cheap money, finally, in the last couple of years, that's no longer working.
[00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.482]  So no matter how cheap they make the money...
[00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:21.862]  We're good to go.
[00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:57.741]  And as a result, you've got this enormous disconnect where the message coming out of the Federal Reserve and from Washington is that we just need more stimulus and everything will be fine around the corner.
[00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:08.989]  And meanwhile, the economy is crashing, unemployment is rising, social unrest is rising, you've got riots all over the world, and they don't seem to make the connection that maybe what they're doing is completely wrong.
[00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:23.826]  Or maybe they have made the connection, and that's why in Europe, the United States, the UK, the social engineers, as soon as they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act back in the late 1990s, began setting up a very oppressive authoritarian police state.
[00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:28.468]  In the last decade, they've used the threat of the manufactured war on terror.
[00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:37.515]  As the excuse to build that, Max, but now they're basically admitting that the whole apparatus is for the people themselves.
[00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:43.480]  Do you think that the system will be successful in being able to suppress revolution?
[00:09:45.151 --> 00:10:11.973]  Well, okay, so you can take the point of view that this is a planned, controlled economic demolition, and the result is a return, really, to an economic model that you could call feudalism, really, because all the wealth is concentrated in the upper one-tenth of one percent, and everyone else is essentially an indentured servant, especially if they bring in these negative interest rates, which is guaranteed being an indentured servant from birth.
[00:10:12.293 --> 00:10:12.693]  So, yes...
[00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:25.544]  It's easy to say that this is the agenda of the banks because it's the easiest way to make money, and they've been very successful without anybody stopping them from putting this in place.
[00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:33.190]  Is it going to be successful keeping down the global insurrection against banker occupation, as I call it,
[00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:35.670]  I think that this is the war.
[00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.910]  Now it's on.
[00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.052]  We've been talking about it coming for a number of years, and clearly it's here.
[00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:45.253]  And it's here, obviously, in North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:45.993]  It's in Europe.
[00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:46.694]  It's in Athens.
[00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:47.394]  It's in Dublin.
[00:10:47.754 --> 00:11:01.199]  And now it's in London in a way that has caught everyone by surprise, really, because it's spread very, very quickly, and it's very violent, and it seems completely anarchistic.
[00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:24.832]  And yet, if you look at this at a more of a broader historical and global perspective, you can see that this is part and parcel of this tension that exists between the bankers who are stealing wealth on a minute-by-minute basis and getting better and better at it, and nobody's stopping them, and the rest of the world population, which is being disenfranchised, bankrupted, and thrown under the bus.
[00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:29.615]  And this is causing this conflict and interrupting different countries in different ways.
[00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:42.945]  Max, if you had to choose one geographic area in the world where more of the banksters, the oligarchs, the Ponzi scheme operators are based, wouldn't it be the City of London within London?
[00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:50.732]  And after you give us the answer, describe for folks what the City of London within the city is.
[00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:52.457]  Right, absolutely.
[00:11:52.497 --> 00:12:04.213]  The City of London has been the global center for the global hedge fund community because they're very lax in the regulatory environment for banks and hedge funds.
[00:12:04.774 --> 00:12:06.336]  And as a result, they attract...
[00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:11.119]  The hedge funds, they also attract many of these oligarchs that are fleeing their countries.
[00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:18.784]  For example, the Icelandic bankers who stole billions, they took up residency in London and they give them safe harbor.
[00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:28.691]  As a result, in a perverse way, the real estate in London is out of reach for the average person because of the price appreciation due to the inclusion now in the
[00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:39.114]  The arrival of all these oligarchs from Iceland or from Russia, different territories around the world, where they have been able to totally co-opt the system, confiscate wealth.
[00:12:39.194 --> 00:12:46.696]  But London is definitely the center of the global arbitrage and the global money laundering business as well.
[00:12:47.317 --> 00:12:53.539]  And as a result, it attracts all sorts of these kleptocrats and oligarchs.
[00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:57.900]  And the city of London, which is their quote-unquote Wall Street...
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:05.342]  It's a principality within London, and it fits amongst these other... There's a couple of other territories in the world.
[00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:07.522]  I believe Washington, D.C.
[00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:09.382]  is one of them, and so is the Vatican.
[00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:20.045]  These are three centers of... It's its own sovereign, if you will, and they have their own government, and they kind of communicate with each other.
[00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:20.725]  It's part of a...
[00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.531]  We're good to go.
[00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:39.833]  We're good to go.
[00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:09.568]  Of the public.
[00:14:09.888 --> 00:14:24.457]  And this shadow banking system is tied into the global derivatives business, the credit default swaps, for example, that are destroying Greece, the credit default swaps that destroyed Ireland, the credit default swaps that are now destroying America.
[00:14:24.477 --> 00:14:27.739]  You know, when the S&P rating agency downgraded the U.S.
[00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.539]  from AAA to AA+,
[00:14:30.046 --> 00:14:40.913]  Suddenly there's huge volatility and there's huge trading activity from the vultures who are now swooping in with credit default swaps and effectively attacking America with the financial weapons.
[00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:44.516]  And this is part of the collapse of the U.S.
[00:14:44.796 --> 00:14:47.658]  These guys have no sovereignty of their own.
[00:14:47.898 --> 00:14:52.401]  They're simply marauding rogue financial bankers or financial terrorists.
[00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:54.743]  And they go wherever they can go.
[00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:57.505]  Make the most money.
[00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:09.156]  That was my next question, and it's these very groups, these six big mega banks that are always pushing a global corporate government that we pay our VAT taxes to.
[00:15:10.378 --> 00:15:15.422]  They're not content now to just buy off our politicians in Europe, England, and the United States.
[00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:19.026]  Now they want open world government, but at the same time,
[00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:30.058]  The laws of nature, the laws of history show that they can't really be above the law forever, especially if they totally decimate their host nations.
[00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:33.842]  I mean, even here in the U.S., some municipalities are having to lay off 60, 70%.
[00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.111]  We're good to go.
[00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:38.292]  We're good to go.
[00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:38.892]  We're good to go.
[00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:05.767]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:12.071]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:14.352]  Number one, study the past.
[00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:16.633]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:16:17.273 --> 00:16:21.035]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:16:22.136 --> 00:16:24.357]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:28.484]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:16:29.064 --> 00:16:33.786]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:37.547]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:16:38.108 --> 00:16:40.969]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:45.470]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshells.com.
[00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.212]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:01.530]  We're good to go.
[00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:21.651]  We're good to go.

[00:20:00.249 --> 00:20:05.213]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:20:06.193 --> 00:20:09.116]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:17.642]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:18.102 --> 00:20:20.744]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:23.826]  Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.692 --> 00:20:32.734]  How do we reverse this?
[00:20:33.475 --> 00:20:43.364]  What are ideas or programs Max, that you think would be a good way to extricate ourselves out of the finance oligarchs global system?
[00:20:43.864 --> 00:20:48.589]  I mean, one thing would obviously be to get rid of the Federal Reserve here domestically and
[00:20:49.069 --> 00:20:49.790]  We're good to go.
[00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:49.950]  I think?
[00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.793]  I mean, it is truly us or them.
[00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:30.912]  As you said today on the radio, they are imploding our entire world into their own control, and we are going to see more riots, looting, things that actually just hurt the general public unless we reverse this system.
[00:21:31.843 --> 00:21:34.686]  Well, my favorite idea is to arrest the bankers.
[00:21:35.407 --> 00:21:46.518]  And you have a great example of that with the 1980s with Bill Black, the regulator at the time, who arrested and prosecuted more than 1,000 bankers who went to jail as a result of the savings and loan crisis.
[00:21:46.918 --> 00:21:55.207]  Now, everything is in place for a repeat of that event and to put these top bankers in jail for committing massive acts of financial fraud.
[00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.687]  And I think this would clean up the system.
[00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:05.529]  It would send a message to the public that looting is no longer tolerated, and it would be a great step forward.
[00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:07.309]  I mean, that's an obvious step.
[00:22:07.689 --> 00:22:10.110]  Now, why doesn't the Attorney General make that step?
[00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.970]  Why doesn't Barack Obama encourage that step?
[00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.351]  Because they're totally co-opted by the system.
[00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:23.432]  So the entire institutional approach, whether it's trying to go after them on a legal basis or try to reinstitute sound money,
[00:22:23.812 --> 00:22:24.493]  We're good to go.
[00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:42.331]  Or a violent reaction.
[00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:45.152]  Clearly, you would want a civil disobedience reaction.
[00:22:45.172 --> 00:22:46.192]  That's your first choice.
[00:22:46.712 --> 00:22:51.793]  And if you're trying to attack the banking system and you want to hit them where it hurts, I can think of a few ways.
[00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:57.915]  Number one, there could be a mass participation and a mass default on mortgages.
[00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:01.435]  This would destroy the banks and send a message.
[00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:03.656]  There could be a mass default on credit cards.
[00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:04.336]  I think.
[00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.310]  We're good to go.
[00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.011]  We're good to go.
[00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:29.511]  We're good to go.
[00:23:48.536 --> 00:23:52.938]  That has to happen if the system will return to any kind of integrity.
[00:23:52.958 --> 00:24:06.443]  And so it is that fundamental rebellion of people going back to what's valuable, gold, silver, food, land, information, and more and more just simply pulling out of the fiat system.
[00:24:06.803 --> 00:24:11.165]  That will then expose these financial vampires and will...
[00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:15.286]  Show that they've been engaging in naked shorts.
[00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:19.087]  Two final questions for Max Keiser of MaxKaiser.com.
[00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:21.848]  And it's a perfect segue.
[00:24:21.888 --> 00:24:23.049]  I want to talk about gold.
[00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:31.332]  It's now gone up to $1,800 today on the announcement that Western governments are going to accelerate the devaluation of their currencies.
[00:24:31.372 --> 00:24:34.873]  We saw other major commodities go up as well.
[00:24:35.753 --> 00:24:36.033]  J.P.
[00:24:36.073 --> 00:24:37.334]  Morgan two days ago.
[00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:38.475]  We're good to go.
[00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:02.853]  Well, as you know, gold and silver, it's a function of the relative price of the U.S.
[00:25:02.873 --> 00:25:03.293]  dollar.
[00:25:04.134 --> 00:25:06.195]  And the dollar is very weak.
[00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:10.237]  It's hitting new lows against Swiss franc and other currencies around the world.
[00:25:10.897 --> 00:25:18.201]  And obviously, if Ben Bernanke is saying that he's going to keep interest rates at 0% for an indefinite period of time...
[00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:21.763]  That means that there's no incentive to buy dollars at all.
[00:25:21.883 --> 00:25:30.649]  And Greenspan, Greenspan, don't forget on Meet the Press Sunday, Meet the Whores, said that, hey, we're not going to default, we're just going to print more money.
[00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:33.791]  That was a hyperinflationary Weimar Republic statement.
[00:25:33.811 --> 00:25:34.352]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:25:34.772 --> 00:25:35.853]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:25:36.113 --> 00:25:45.259]  And China immediately came out and said, we find your views irresponsible, and they're our largest creditor in the U.S., and they're actively buying gold.
[00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:46.880]  So the dollar, and the U.S.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.521]  policy...
[00:25:48.101 --> 00:25:51.343]  Really, if you think about it, the only possible way you can grow the U.S.
[00:25:51.383 --> 00:26:08.213]  economy, if you look at the various levers out there, what you could push, what you could pull to try to create some wealth, there's only one viable path, and that would be to debase the dollar, to try to make exports more viable in the global economy, in particular America's agricultural exports.
[00:26:08.253 --> 00:26:11.455]  America still does do a lot of agricultural exports.
[00:26:11.515 --> 00:26:13.016]  If they can crash the dollar...
[00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:17.020]  They will get more agriculture exported out of the U.S.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:26.249]  But it'll take years to get an industrial base back, even if our currency was comparable to the Chinese currency or something like the peso.
[00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:28.011]  I mean, this is asinine.
[00:26:28.573 --> 00:26:36.019]  Well, as I've said on your show before, I've made the prediction that before long, the biggest industry in America will be cotton picking.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.986]  And everyone should familiarize themselves with some of those old spirituals like jump down, pick a bale of cotton.
[00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:46.808]  But now, moving on to Bank of America.
[00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:56.236]  Bank of America, of course, bought into a couple of the failed lending institutions during the last crisis.
[00:26:57.071 --> 00:26:57.351]  I think.
[00:27:19.145 --> 00:27:19.626]  We're good to go.
[00:27:43.664 --> 00:27:47.326]  That they've had for years, but they've also been able to service those debts.
[00:27:47.486 --> 00:27:51.409]  Is a fall of the zombie banks, one after another, possible?
[00:27:51.849 --> 00:27:54.711]  And would that destroy the finance oligarchs?
[00:27:55.712 --> 00:27:56.392]  Yeah, of course.
[00:27:56.652 --> 00:28:01.375]  But it has to be... No one's going to escape it.
[00:28:02.216 --> 00:28:04.057]  And on the other end of this...
[00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:15.844]  There's going to be, the bankers are going to try to flee to territories more like Prince from that group of mercenaries.
[00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:19.867]  Yeah, he's over there in the Middle East now, UAE, without any extradition agreement.
[00:28:19.887 --> 00:28:23.490]  So you see more bankers going to UAE and other territories.
[00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.251]  It's a very important move there.
[00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:27.334]  So literally, we do see them running off with the lewd.
[00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:33.161]  And in a way, that's even more dangerous to see the elites running, you know, the Bushes buying all this land in Paraguay.
[00:28:33.441 --> 00:28:42.952]  That's even creepier to think that they know they've committed so many crimes that they're just fleeing, leaving us with the aftermath of what they've done.
[00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:44.274]  But I think at the end of the day...
[00:28:44.654 --> 00:28:45.255]  I think we're good to go.
[00:29:01.332 --> 00:29:06.818]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:10.022]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:29:11.223 --> 00:29:16.529]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.596]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:29:22.936 --> 00:29:29.203]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:29:29.504 --> 00:29:36.892]  Go to survivalrx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.

[00:32:50.206 --> 00:32:52.107]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?

[00:32:52.627 --> 00:32:53.527]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.823 --> 00:33:15.546]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.

[00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:33.455]  My friends, I can barely contain myself right now.
[00:33:33.475 --> 00:33:40.159]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com, you can read a detailed report that Paul Joseph Watson put out
[00:33:40.859 --> 00:33:48.062]  This morning, it's posted right up in the right-hand breaking news corner of DrugsReport.com, from InfoWars.com.
[00:33:48.402 --> 00:33:50.904]  Pollster, Americans are pre-revolutionary.
[00:33:51.664 --> 00:33:53.245]  Just 17% believe U.S.
[00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:55.906]  government has consent of the governed.
[00:33:56.526 --> 00:33:57.907]  Well, they know that you're awake.
[00:33:57.947 --> 00:34:02.589]  That's why they just transferred the power to the super congress, the austerity congress.
[00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:07.151]  Twelve members, with Obama with a veto, a 13-member council.
[00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:09.552]  And they've got Pat Cadell...
[00:34:10.606 --> 00:34:11.867]  Pollster at Rasmussen.
[00:34:12.347 --> 00:34:13.128]  Other major polls.
[00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:14.209]  I don't just believe one poll.
[00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.211]  We've got a whole index of polls showing the same numbers or worse.
[00:34:17.691 --> 00:34:19.592]  Some are as low as 9% approval rating.
[00:34:20.053 --> 00:34:24.356]  The results of this survey indicate that Americans are now pre-revolutionary.
[00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:24.996]  That's a quote.
[00:34:26.317 --> 00:34:31.541]  Says Pollster Pat Goodell, who described the outcome of the poll as unprecedented.
[00:34:32.498 --> 00:34:44.037]  This conclusion follows Cadell's observation last November that a sea of anger is churning amongst Americans who want to take their country back, and that the nation stood on the brink of pre-revolutionary movement.
[00:34:44.638 --> 00:34:45.360]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.243]  We've got to get the left and the right.
[00:34:48.118 --> 00:34:50.119]  And libertarians, everybody to go, wait a minute.
[00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:53.160]  It's not about Obama the puppet, as much as it's fun to hate him.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.721]  It's not about the puppet George W. Bush, as much fun as it is to hate him.
[00:34:57.221 --> 00:34:58.762]  It looks like a demon, acts like a demon.
[00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:03.643]  You've got to get past these people to the big megabanks.
[00:35:03.743 --> 00:35:07.245]  And the derivatives that they got us and Europe to sign on to that we don't owe.
[00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:11.566]  Look, our $14.5 trillion deficit, easy to deal with.
[00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:15.187]  They're trying to tell us it's about pension funds and Social Security.
[00:35:15.788 --> 00:35:16.768]  We're a rich country.
[00:35:17.984 --> 00:35:18.745]  It's a joke.
[00:35:18.865 --> 00:35:20.506]  The zombie banks are the problem.
[00:35:21.026 --> 00:35:22.467]  And they're going to hold us all hostage.
[00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:27.570]  Now, joining us for the next 20 minutes or so is Nomi Prins, journalist, best-selling author.
[00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.732]  She's got a new book coming out in October, and we'll have her on.
[00:35:31.213 --> 00:35:35.335]  Before becoming a journalist, Nomi couldn't watch what she was seeing anymore, so she left.
[00:35:35.756 --> 00:35:42.420]  She worked on Wall Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and running the international analytics group at Bear Stearns in London.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.981]  She was analyzing the big spectrum.
[00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:47.422]  So she was piloting a Star Destroyer for these people.
[00:35:48.443 --> 00:35:50.664]  And she joins us now, Nomi Prins.
[00:35:51.144 --> 00:35:52.305]  Not Naomi, Nomi.
[00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:55.246]  N-O-M-I Prins.com.
[00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.488]  Links up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:58.048 --> 00:36:02.030]  And I want to get her view on the Super Congress, on the...
[00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.891]  Hypocritical rating agency.
[00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:05.412]  She's got an article out under that title.
[00:36:05.852 --> 00:36:19.279]  I want to get her view on where we're going, because for my research, this is a planned implosion, but it's a black hole so giant they've created that it may suck them in with it, like Bank of America plunging in the stock right now.
[00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:21.820]  This could be the beginning of a major rout.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.381]  Could this be bigger than 2008?
[00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:24.982]  Nomi, what say you?
[00:36:25.874 --> 00:36:32.659]  Well, we've talked about this, and I continue to say we have never, since 2008, been in any kind of a recovery.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.944]  This has all been going on and down, behind the scenes, and also right out in public view.
[00:36:39.225 --> 00:36:52.635]  We don't have a handle on all of the assets, all of the toxicity, all of the debt, everything that was created by the banking system in the run-up to 2008's official crisis, and since then, that is still...
[00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:54.557]  We're good to go.
[00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:14.706]  Banks profited from the mess.
[00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:19.988]  And yes, some might go down and some might have their stocks go down, but they made a whole lot of money on the run-up.
[00:37:20.288 --> 00:37:31.610]  They can position themselves to short or to not value the securities that are still on their books because the financial accounting standards board says they don't have to and all sorts of other tricks.
[00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.931]  Meanwhile, they are floated.
[00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:46.355]  By the government, by the Federal Reserve, by a whole lot of subsidies that we have no control over, we don't vote for, and that is how they continue to thrive and do what they're doing with no repercussions.
[00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:55.338]  We feel the repercussions, and today's mess in the Dow is just one aspect of so many repercussions that we've been feeling and will continue to feel.
[00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:58.718]  Well, very well said, Nomi.
[00:37:58.858 --> 00:38:00.862]  So where are we going from here now?
[00:38:02.264 --> 00:38:07.394]  From your expert position of research and knowledge, where are we right now?
[00:38:08.925 --> 00:38:12.346]  Right now, we're in the middle of a massive global downfall.
[00:38:12.546 --> 00:38:17.767]  And that's because, for one thing, if you don't fix problems, they don't go away.
[00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:24.228]  The only group of people who think they might go away if they're not focused on fixing them are the people in Washington.
[00:38:24.248 --> 00:38:26.969]  And as you rightly say, it doesn't matter what party they're from.
[00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:31.070]  It doesn't matter who selected which Treasury Secretary.
[00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.130]  It doesn't matter who's even running the Fed.
[00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.451]  It's a concerted denial of...
[00:38:37.341 --> 00:38:40.202]  Today's problems, definitely, and problems that were emerging.
[00:38:40.242 --> 00:38:58.570]  And today's problems and today's debt, for example, the $4 trillion of extra debt that have been created in just the last two and a half years, as you rightly said, have not been created because we had to save Social Security or because we're giving too much away to workers and we're helping the labor economy and we're creating jobs.
[00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:58.750]  That's
[00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.811]  Obviously, clearly not what has been going on with the debt that's been created.
[00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:04.352]  And it's interesting.
[00:39:04.532 --> 00:39:07.453]  I think one of your listeners sent this to me.
[00:39:07.493 --> 00:39:08.053]  I'm not sure.
[00:39:08.073 --> 00:39:08.673]  There's a U.S.
[00:39:08.753 --> 00:39:12.735]  national debt infographic at the White House's website.
[00:39:12.775 --> 00:39:13.715]  The link's on my site.
[00:39:13.735 --> 00:39:14.435]  I'll send it to you.
[00:39:14.795 --> 00:39:21.978]  But they have $3.6 trillion worth of debt created in the last few years that they label economic and technical changes.
[00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:24.636]  No, I know.
[00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:26.158]  It's laughable.
[00:39:26.399 --> 00:39:29.963]  And by the way, that doesn't include... We do know that there was a stimulus package.
[00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:31.746]  That was an $800 billion package.
[00:39:31.926 --> 00:39:34.709]  That's not in that $3.6 trillion, right?
[00:39:34.729 --> 00:39:37.713]  The $3.6 trillion is just laughable, you know,
[00:39:38.516 --> 00:39:38.776]  Yeah.
[00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.411]  That's just one number of that $3.6 trillion.
[00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:11.873]  That's just $1.6 trillion of it, and it goes on.
[00:40:11.893 --> 00:40:13.754]  Well, look at the big six megabanks.
[00:40:13.914 --> 00:40:15.955]  Record bonuses, record profits.
[00:40:16.335 --> 00:40:23.319]  But at the end of the day, how are they going to operate when their parasite economy has destroyed what's left of the real economy?
[00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:29.383]  And I guess they say it's better to reign in hell than serve in heaven, because most of the experts we talk to know me.
[00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:31.204]  They say that we've really been...
[00:40:32.071 --> 00:40:32.391]  Well, you know,
[00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:51.764]  The term depression is definitely viable.
[00:40:52.244 --> 00:40:53.804]  I've used it as well.
[00:40:53.864 --> 00:41:01.126]  And you know how back in the early part of last century, before World War I, they called the First World War the Great War.
[00:41:01.586 --> 00:41:03.406]  And then we have the Great Depression.
[00:41:03.926 --> 00:41:08.968]  And then by the time we got to World War II, the Great War became World War I and we had World War II.
[00:41:09.048 --> 00:41:12.108]  And in that respect, we are in Great Depression II.
[00:41:12.528 --> 00:41:14.289]  Because we have no...
[00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:16.881]  We're good to go.
[00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:45.785]  The private banking system that was really funneling debt into the economy, toxic debt, high-rated debt that allowed it to be dispersed.
[00:41:45.825 --> 00:41:51.008]  So the rating agencies, going back to what's just happened today, were definitely a part of this puzzle.
[00:41:51.028 --> 00:41:54.450]  They didn't rate certain bad debts, certain bad assets, AAA.
[00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:02.954]  They wouldn't have been dispersed and sold throughout the global economy, bringing whole cities and municipalities and pension funds down with them.
[00:42:02.974 --> 00:42:04.595]  They were labeled wrong.
[00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.920]  And there's been no accountability for that.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.973]  And it's the same lack of accountability that's created this down-road spiral because if what is sustaining...
[00:42:13.877 --> 00:42:14.157]  That's right.
[00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:25.020]  We've invested our whole economy in a planned Ponzi scheme fraud, and now the Ponzi scheme operators are saying, go down with us, let us rule you, or you won't even get 10% of what you invested.
[00:42:42.737 --> 00:42:45.040]  We're good to go.
[00:43:00.337 --> 00:43:05.641]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:13.868]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking minds, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:43:14.188 --> 00:43:25.197]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:43:25.417 --> 00:43:27.299]  We're only a month away from launching
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.621]  Look in the mirror.
[00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:31.621]  You are the resistance.
[00:43:53.968 --> 00:43:59.539]  It is up to us, the info warriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.772]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[00:44:04.112 --> 00:44:09.514]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[00:44:10.135 --> 00:44:10.435]  Why?
[00:44:10.775 --> 00:44:14.757]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.
[00:44:15.117 --> 00:44:26.162]  With Le Cig e-cigarettes' revolutionary microelectronic technology, rechargeable battery, and unique replacement cartridges, you'll get all the satisfaction of smoking, but no smoking hazards.

[00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:42.982]  Me, Jerry D. Hi.
[00:44:43.002 --> 00:44:48.624]  Jerry and his family, like you, are very concerned about world conditions and have gathered many emergency preparedness items, including Turtle Tough Shelters.
[00:45:12.196 --> 00:45:12.877]  We're good to go.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.623]  Get your Turtle Tough Shelter and accessories included at turtletoughshelters.com.
[00:45:39.943 --> 00:45:42.484]  That's turtle, T-U-F-F, shelters.com.

[00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:49.108]  Turtle Tough Shelters, your all-season home away from home.
[00:46:00.575 --> 00:46:05.599]  Local Army-Navy surplus stores are hard to find these days, but not military-issue supplies.
[00:46:05.839 --> 00:46:08.962]  They're right here online at mainmilitary.com.
[00:46:09.262 --> 00:46:13.785]  That's right, just like the state, M-A-I-N-E, military.com.
[00:46:13.966 --> 00:46:16.507]  We have everything for true, total preparedness.
[00:46:16.728 --> 00:46:19.390]  Mainmilitary.com is not a typical website.
[00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.112]  It has much more than your old surplus store.
[00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:22.953]  We're good to go.
[00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:44.888]  Military manuals, sandbags by the bale, and a huge molly assortment of vests and pouches for every need.
[00:46:45.128 --> 00:46:45.468]  Call 207-989-6783.

[00:46:46.988 --> 00:46:47.989]  That's M-A-I-N-E Military.com.
[00:46:48.189 --> 00:46:50.009]  The main name in military supply.
[00:47:00.265 --> 00:47:02.067]  The GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:02.327 --> 00:47:04.929]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:47:05.209 --> 00:47:07.051]  GCN.
[00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:09.834]  Great talk radio starts here.
[00:47:14.518 --> 00:47:16.519]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.641]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:19.322 --> 00:47:20.823]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.814 --> 00:47:44.036]  Thank you for joining us for this Infowars.com special report.
[00:47:44.597 --> 00:47:51.101]  Paul Watson is a longtime reporter for Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the UK.
[00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.042]  We're now entering the fifth days.
[00:47:53.703 --> 00:47:54.183]  We're good to go.
[00:47:54.203 --> 00:47:54.504]  I think?
[00:48:16.537 --> 00:48:17.137]  Well, that's correct, Alex.
[00:48:17.157 --> 00:48:17.997]  Yesterday we reported that
[00:48:40.737 --> 00:48:51.532]  Quote, the lacklustre police response with numerous reports from the public that police stood back and allowed looters to pillage both large department stores and private small businesses for hours on end.
[00:48:52.418 --> 00:49:11.028]  And today that's been confirmed because sources from within Scotland Yard have confirmed to both the Daily Mail and the Times of London that police were ordered to quote, stand and observe on those first few nights of rioting as the looters, the rioters set fire to
[00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:16.752]  Buildings, both homes and small businesses, they were ordered to stand back and let it happen.
[00:49:17.152 --> 00:49:23.715]  And of course we said that this was going to be the case all along because it's routine, standard operating procedure.
[00:49:24.095 --> 00:49:38.782]  The authorities allow the chaos to spiral, to build, and it causes, it provokes the general public, specifically the middle class, to demand the police state measures which the government is all too keen on.
[00:49:39.355 --> 00:49:39.956]  We're good to go.
[00:50:04.889 --> 00:50:16.336]  It's a mistake to embrace what are essentially a group of drunk, mindless teenagers and pretend that they're on some kind of frontline war against the establishment, because they're not.
[00:50:17.777 --> 00:50:21.660]  You know, not every flash mob is a revolution, and to pretend that it is...
[00:50:22.892 --> 00:50:24.513]  It's, again, completely naive.
[00:50:24.533 --> 00:50:25.654]  It's wishful thinking.
[00:50:25.754 --> 00:50:27.134]  Well, you know why that's being done.
[00:50:27.815 --> 00:50:39.660]  They're blurring the lines so that now when anybody does have a political flash mob, or when anybody does actually go after real targets, like the banksters, then it can be demonized.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.141]  We've seen cases here in the U.S.
[00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:46.764]  where they send the army in plain clothes to spy on in-the-Fed peaceful demonstrations.
[00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:48.205]  And so...
[00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:50.074]  We're good to go.
[00:50:50.094 --> 00:50:50.275]  I think?
[00:51:14.111 --> 00:51:15.552]  Soccer games in South Africa.
[00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:26.159]  It's the same types all over the world, mainly the welfare class, that go out and do this as a sport and as a way to steal some loot and some goodies.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:35.966]  And so now their activities, targeting mom and pop shops and homes, is being transposed over legitimate political debate and discussion.
[00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:41.490]  And the fact that they've waited four days to finally get the parliament back and do this is incredibly frightening.
[00:51:42.992 --> 00:51:51.094]  Well, yeah, and that's why it's completely stupid to embrace them, because then that's what we're going to be labelled with, is the supporters of these mobs.
[00:51:51.134 --> 00:51:52.695]  I mean, just look what they're attacking.
[00:51:53.035 --> 00:51:55.475]  They're not laying siege to the Houses of Parliament.
[00:51:55.755 --> 00:51:58.516]  They're laying siege to JD Sports.
[00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:04.117]  They're attacking family-owned local businesses that have survived two world wars and raising them to the ground.
[00:52:04.438 --> 00:52:10.019]  They're attacking charity shops, cat rescue centres, hospitals that care for sick babies.
[00:52:10.479 --> 00:52:11.019]  We're good to go.
[00:52:31.571 --> 00:52:33.973]  And so I'm sorry, but that doesn't represent me.
[00:52:34.273 --> 00:52:47.480]  I don't think it represents our movement, and I think it's foolish to try and embrace it and say that it does, because later down the line, we will be discredited and blamed for all this chaos, just like the Tea Party's being blamed for the financial collapse.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.161]  They're going to pin it on us.
[00:52:49.301 --> 00:52:55.705]  Oh yeah, I wonder if the Tea Party's causing what's happening in Israel with the protest, or the protest ongoing in Egypt.
[00:52:57.359 --> 00:52:58.260]  Rand Paul put it well.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:04.325]  It's like the fire department shows up to put out your burning house, and you blame them for starting the fire.
[00:53:05.527 --> 00:53:15.796]  There is such a pent-up anger, though, at the corrupt system that people are hoping that this is the revolution that people are looking for.
[00:53:16.336 --> 00:53:18.218]  Now, Paul, there's another big issue here.
[00:53:18.258 --> 00:53:23.483]  You notice these riots are going on and these racial robberies and things are going on in Chicago.
[00:53:24.056 --> 00:53:24.896]  We're good to go.
[00:53:25.296 --> 00:53:25.997]  We're good to go.
[00:53:26.017 --> 00:53:26.797]  We're good to go.
[00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:47.652]  Look at England, where you've had people who've been robbed three times in a row in their own home.
[00:53:48.012 --> 00:53:49.193]  They get an illegal gun.
[00:53:49.573 --> 00:53:50.853]  They shoot one of the intruders.
[00:53:51.274 --> 00:53:52.734]  They get the book thrown at them.
[00:53:52.754 --> 00:53:57.677]  I've seen cases in England, people pushing someone down a flight of stairs that's robbing them.
[00:53:58.077 --> 00:53:59.458]  They get the book thrown at them.
[00:53:59.838 --> 00:54:07.562]  So there's a real desire by the social engineers in England to leave the general law-abiding public servile and dependent on the state
[00:54:08.351 --> 00:54:14.254]  So the state can prey on the public and then also menace them with the zombie welfare hordes.
[00:54:14.535 --> 00:54:16.035]  Do you concur with that analysis?
[00:54:17.576 --> 00:54:18.197]  Yes, I do.
[00:54:18.437 --> 00:54:26.161]  And for people to say that because we don't embrace these looting hooligans means that we somehow support the system is asinine.
[00:54:26.381 --> 00:54:30.084]  I mean, try and hold more than one concept in your head at the same time.
[00:54:30.124 --> 00:54:32.445]  I know it's difficult for some people, but try and do it.
[00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.890]  We're good to go.
[00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:34.130]  I think?
[00:54:54.485 --> 00:55:03.202]  You can talk to anyone who's lived amongst this in England, and with all due respect to Max Kaiser, who, I don't know, he may live in some swanky part of Paris.
[00:55:04.028 --> 00:55:05.389]  But, I mean, I grew up with it.
[00:55:05.489 --> 00:55:10.091]  I was born on a council estate in Sheffield, in a poor northern city.
[00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:12.232]  I went to school with some of these types of people.
[00:55:12.792 --> 00:55:17.974]  You know, my first property that I bought was across the road from a crack house in the poorest part of town.
[00:55:18.355 --> 00:55:21.436]  And this is what these mobs, these yobs, like to do.
[00:55:21.736 --> 00:55:25.238]  It's fun for them to go and burn things and steal things.
[00:55:26.258 --> 00:55:31.681]  As one person in The Guardian today described it, and he was actually involved in the riots in Liverpool back in the 80s,
[00:55:32.541 --> 00:55:35.744]  He said it's basically like Nintendo Wii come to life.
[00:55:35.824 --> 00:55:36.805]  It's just fun for them.
[00:55:37.165 --> 00:55:38.186]  They have no idea.
[00:55:38.206 --> 00:55:41.529]  They have no concept of some kind of backlash against the bank.
[00:55:41.609 --> 00:55:46.734]  It's fun to light somebody's house on fire and have a woman jump to firefighters and then attack the firefighters.
[00:55:47.194 --> 00:55:48.616]  And again, it's a complex issue.
[00:55:48.676 --> 00:55:56.583]  We know the government let this happen so they could then have shoot-to-kill orders for peaceful protesters because they know the resistance to them is mounting.
[00:55:57.103 --> 00:55:57.584]  We're good to go.
[00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:57.764]  I think?
[00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:23.847]  Living in England where people that are out defending their homes are being demonized right now.
[00:56:23.907 --> 00:56:38.038]  That's the one thing that the street thugs can't deal with and that the nanny-nanny state can't deal with is neighborhoods banding together, the baseball bats all selling out there in England, and people fighting back.
[00:56:38.098 --> 00:56:46.104]  And it's not even the police now that have been fighting back these crowds of miscreants, some of them as young as nine years old robbing liquor stores,
[00:56:48.052 --> 00:56:48.592]  We're good to go.
[00:56:48.612 --> 00:56:48.753]  I think?
[00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:23.853]  And the police attacked a peaceful crowd like Tiananmen Square, and then people took over the parliament, and people took over 10 Downing Street and stormed the palaces.
[00:57:24.413 --> 00:57:26.754]  I would say that's a legitimate rebellion.
[00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:33.937]  But pulling people out of cars and beating people to death and running over people is not that.
[00:57:34.297 --> 00:57:38.699]  And Paul, I hope that you can sit there and defend your country from these people.
[00:57:50.242 --> 00:57:51.423]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:58:17.524 --> 00:58:19.746]  Again, that's GCNlive.com.
[00:58:19.806 --> 00:58:29.072]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:58:29.112 --> 00:58:29.833]  This capitalism?
[00:58:29.913 --> 00:58:36.037]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:58:36.077 --> 00:58:39.700]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.641]  Call for your copy.
[00:58:40.661 --> 00:58:40.701]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:42.222]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:58:42.242 --> 00:58:42.402]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:58:42.422 --> 00:58:42.662]  That's
[00:58:51.348 --> 00:58:57.372]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:58:57.972 --> 00:59:00.954]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:03.323 --> 00:59:08.249]  Just to say that the people now out defending their property are not just white right-wingers.
[00:59:08.269 --> 00:59:13.014]  You've got Sikhs, you've got Muslims, you've got all kinds of races out there defending their property.
[00:59:13.034 --> 00:59:20.343]  And now the latest reports are that the police are actually moving these people away from the areas where the riots are expected to happen.
[00:59:21.103 --> 00:59:30.888]  I was about to say, they're telling Sikhs who are standing out front of their churches, their temples that are full of valuables, that you're not going to defend it.
[00:59:31.028 --> 00:59:34.290]  By the way, you shouldn't have a sword, because these guys have ceremonial swords.
[00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.230]  They're standing out front.
[00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.811]  A normal action of a man.
[00:59:37.831 --> 00:59:41.373]  I believe the three people that got run over by the car defending their property were Muslims.
[00:59:41.833 --> 01:00:00.165]  So I want to point out here, it's so much fun to demonize Muslims all day, but it's Sikhs, it's Muslims, it's right-wing pro-Englanders that are defending law and order, while it's the liberal, trendy, welfare, whites, blacks, Asians, you name it, running around doing this.
[01:00:00.626 --> 01:00:07.270]  And it's disgusting, Paul, to see it confirmed that the government is trying to stop the citizens from defending themselves.
[01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:11.353]  If that isn't evidence of how lawless and criminal your government is, I don't know what is.
[01:00:13.014 --> 01:00:13.474]  Exactly.
[01:00:13.514 --> 01:00:17.116]  And just don't confuse a flash mob with a revolution.
[01:00:18.257 --> 01:00:20.478]  Not every flash mob is a revolution.
[01:00:20.898 --> 01:00:25.060]  I mean, you had in the communist revolution, the mob was controlled from above.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.501]  It fed on the middle class.
[01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:29.263]  It looted people with small amounts of wealth.
[01:00:29.603 --> 01:00:31.404]  Not every revolution is positive.
[01:00:31.624 --> 01:00:33.325]  That's what the NKVD did.
[01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:40.709]  They would send out... Stalin took people out of the prisons and sent them to Ukraine and other places to thuggishly do this
[01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:54.538]  And that's what the founders talked about, a republic where no minority can be targeted, where everyone has rights, that the mob cannot vote away, or 51% will vote to enslave the other 49%.
[01:00:54.678 --> 01:01:06.046]  And that's why the social engineers, the offshore banks, are always pushing democracy, because they can dumb down the population and use these hordes of dependent people to absolutely rob and destroy us.
[01:01:06.086 --> 01:01:07.607]  That's why I'm so against the illegal aliens.
[01:01:08.147 --> 01:01:27.973]  Because no matter where they come from, they get a liberal handout once they get here, they get indoctrinated, and they get turned against the Second Amendment and private property, and pretty soon the illegals that are now becoming the majority of America are going to vote to take the guns, the property, everything, and the bankers will sit offshore laughing at this.
[01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:31.114]  Paul, looking in England, you're ten years ahead of the United States.
[01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:32.635]  Any final comments?
[01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:43.840]  Yeah, we've just got to be wary of the fact that these groups of disaffected youth are going to be used as a weapon to petrify the middle class into demanding the police state that is late to use them.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:51.667]  So try and look at it from a more sophisticated approach than saying, oh, if you don't support the rioters, then you support the establishment.
[01:01:51.907 --> 01:01:54.229]  You've got to be a little bit more sophisticated than that.
[01:01:54.489 --> 01:02:04.295]  The establishment is supporting the rioters by protecting them and giving them their liberation theology and leaving them alone and telling the vigilantes they don't have a right to defend themselves.
[01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:08.158]  And telling the police to stand down, which is now being revealed.
[01:02:08.298 --> 01:02:09.979]  That's what happened in the first three days.
[01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:12.741]  So we'll wait and see what Parliament says tomorrow.
[01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:17.704]  And undoubtedly it's going to be the start of more draconian crackdown in Great Britain.
[01:02:18.584 --> 01:02:24.826]  Absolutely, and we'll watch it all with you and your brother there in England, Steve Watson, in London itself.
[01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:29.947]  And we also have other reporters that have been popping in who have witnessed racial attacks, you name it.
[01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:41.531]  This is really bringing out the ugliest side of so many people, but also the best side of many others, like the Sikhs, the Muslims, and the, quote, England first, evil right-wingers that are being demonized.
[01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:44.552]  Paul Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:02:45.252 --> 01:02:45.752]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:47.863]  We're good to go.
[01:03:05.795 --> 01:03:09.556]  Again, thank you so much for tuning in to this special transmission.
[01:03:09.576 --> 01:03:13.738]  I want to thank PrisonPlanet.tv members for their support to make this possible.
[01:03:14.198 --> 01:03:23.281]  And don't forget we have the new nightly television show that will be condensed and focused and hard-hitting starting September 1st here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:31.645]  Well, that's it for this InfoWars special report with Max Keiser and, of course, Paul Watson and yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:37.288]  I want to say also, in closing, fabulous job to our dedicated InfoWars crew.
[01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:39.709]  We'll see you back tomorrow live on the radio.
[01:03:49.986 --> 01:03:53.491]  The American people think they live in a constitutional republic.
[01:03:53.711 --> 01:03:55.854]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:03:56.515 --> 01:03:56.875]  Right.
[01:03:57.175 --> 01:04:01.982]  Just try those lines on the judge when you get a ticket or have to deal with a big bad IRS.
[01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.246]  Instead, use escapeharassment.com.
[01:04:05.546 --> 01:04:13.872]  Since 1972, our volunteer group of researchers and educators have successfully taught how to escape tickets by law, and it works.
[01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:19.337]  Escape harassment has three different steps to follow, depending on where you are in the ticket process.

[01:04:50.062 --> 01:04:52.304]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:52.824 --> 01:04:55.607]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:05.187]  We are live.
[01:05:05.247 --> 01:05:05.927]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:05:06.007 --> 01:05:07.328]  It is Wednesday, the 10th day of August, 2011.
[01:05:07.388 --> 01:05:09.449]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:12.391]  Well, these are the times that try men and women's souls.
[01:05:30.965 --> 01:05:38.972]  Period of unrest and upheaval is now upon us as a society, as a world.
[01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:43.295]  We have been in the throes of a depression globally for at least three years.
[01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:58.328]  It is now intensifying and it's only going to get worse from here on out unless we remove the corrupt ruling class that have seized control of the world economy through fraud.
[01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:11.111]  Namely, through fractional reserve banking, and then the last 12 years through derivatives, which allow them to create unlimited counterfeit financial instruments.
[01:06:12.711 --> 01:06:29.377]  Now, it has always been the ruling class's established rule to control large cities going back thousands of years by having large different segments of the population living in welfare slums that are funded by the government.
[01:06:30.859 --> 01:06:32.940]  The Romans did this more than 2,000 years ago.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.222]  They had a bread and also a silver allotment.
[01:06:37.142 --> 01:06:56.712]  And anytime that the surrounding rural gentry did not pay the high taxes or do what they were told, the welfare crowds would be released, the Roman military would stand down, and the welfare hordes would exit the city and begin robbing and looting and stealing and burning.
[01:06:57.794 --> 01:07:11.442]  You could then not count on the Roman Fire Department to give you any assistance, also in the city, in your burning neighborhood, if you'd not paid them large amounts of protection money.
[01:07:11.942 --> 01:07:21.207]  No, it was not the American-Italian La Cosa Nostra that invented the threats of burning down your family clothier or grocery store or furniture store.
[01:07:21.867 --> 01:07:22.627]  We're good to go.
[01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:23.227]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.409 --> 01:07:55.830]  And of course, formerly the Empire, the Roman Empire based in the city of Rome.
[01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:57.191]  Okay.
[01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:14.375]  Before I get into the global financial meltdown, before I get into the day four of uncontrolled riots, the British Prime Minister says they might use water cannons and batons later if the rioters don't behave themselves.
[01:08:15.215 --> 01:08:16.856]  This is just like in Seattle in 19...
[01:08:39.733 --> 01:08:41.415]  A population of peaceful protesters.
[01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:43.116]  And that's all this is here.
[01:08:44.597 --> 01:08:46.458]  What we suspected is now coming out.
[01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:53.160]  Even the BBC is admitting that the police were ordered four nights ago to stand down in South Lyme where all of this began.
[01:08:55.061 --> 01:09:06.986]  We now have the reports that the rioters all over the country, all over what is England within the UK, that region, are being directed...
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:15.646]  And promised payments if they will riot by men claiming to be part of the media.
[01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:18.908]  Probably police operative provocateurs.
[01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:22.832]  We've also seen this go on in Greece as well.
[01:09:23.272 --> 01:09:29.117]  Going back two years ago, their national news documented it was police rioting and starting the riots.
[01:09:30.816 --> 01:09:46.464]  And then we also documented that, what, three years ago, National News had to admit it later in Canada, that the Royal Mount of Police did dress up like anarchists and begin breaking and smashing and stealing so they could then have the police attack the peaceful crowds protesting the North American Union meeting.
[01:09:48.465 --> 01:09:58.010]  So what they've done is they've primed the pump, they have provocateur-ed the first events, and then the larger hooligan mass...
[01:09:58.969 --> 01:10:09.012]  ...rushes in to expand the crisis, and then David Cameron's not in trouble for the News Corp hacking gate anymore and the mysterious deaths.
[01:10:10.772 --> 01:10:16.254]  David Cameron can move forward now with tax increases to satiate the welfare zombie mobs.
[01:10:17.974 --> 01:10:22.475]  This is a standard operating procedure, and I'm going to be going over it.
[01:10:23.555 --> 01:10:25.456]  But as for the individuals...
[01:10:27.498 --> 01:10:28.378]  That are doing this.
[01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:37.623]  As for the general mobs, some of it at the beginning was racially motivated.
[01:10:38.464 --> 01:10:40.505]  And I guess you could say in a way that's political.
[01:10:41.165 --> 01:10:57.033]  But from the hundreds of emails and comments I've gotten from reporters that live in the area that we've talked to on air, from Steve Watson, who lives in London, from Paul Watson, north of London, this is purely, purely
[01:10:57.759 --> 01:11:13.232]  In the second, third, and fourth day, groups of hooligans, the folks that like to go get drunk and get in fights at soccer games as part of their tribalism outlet, black, white, you name it, who were engaging in pure looting.
[01:11:13.572 --> 01:11:20.958]  In fact, I saw one report of an entire business district, shop district, burned, leveled, and looted except for a bookstore.
[01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:22.976]  The looters had no interest in that.
[01:11:22.996 --> 01:11:32.718]  Electronic stores, liquor stores, pawn shops, furniture stores, anything of value looted and stolen.
[01:11:33.639 --> 01:11:43.101]  And then you have the so-called left saying this is the beginning of the Stalinistic uprising against the bourgeoisie and then the ruling class.
[01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:46.181]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[01:11:47.241 --> 01:11:49.962]  You have the rise of hooliganism in South Africa.
[01:11:51.252 --> 01:11:51.612]  We're good to go.
[01:12:15.436 --> 01:12:24.261]  Counties and cities get together and then elect a sheriff or elect a mayor who creates a police force of men and women that have citizen's arrest power.
[01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:29.723]  You try to pull me out of my car and beat me up or kill me or rape my wife, I'm going to kill you.
[01:12:31.464 --> 01:12:33.605]  And that is under common law.
[01:12:34.126 --> 01:12:35.386]  Thousands of years old.
[01:12:36.427 --> 01:12:42.630]  And so you notice you don't have these type of things going on in Dallas, Texas.
[01:12:43.422 --> 01:12:46.443]  You don't have this type of stuff going on in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:12:47.243 --> 01:12:54.604]  You don't have this type of stuff going on because when you start burning buildings down, that is an act of arson in action.
[01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:59.305]  You are committing acts that could and probably will kill people.
[01:12:59.925 --> 01:13:07.667]  And if I catch people trying to burn my house or my neighbor's house, I'm going to put a bead on you and I'm going to unload into you and your cohorts.
[01:13:08.367 --> 01:13:09.507]  Understand that.
[01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:23.778]  The globalists want law and order to break down so they can come in after the looting rages for weeks or even months, as has been done in many other countries as part of the IMF World Bank plan that was leaked in 2002 that we've covered so much.
[01:13:24.098 --> 01:13:25.339]  They call it the IMF riot.
[01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:38.085]  And after it's run its course, the country's confidence is destroyed, the stocks are destroyed, the nation is in trouble, and the big offshore banks come in and take even more control.
[01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:43.588]  New York, Chicago, L.A., Boston to a certain extent.
[01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:13.212]  The first thing they do in a disarmed ninny state is disarm the public.
[01:14:14.173 --> 01:14:16.594]  Once that happens, they double or triple the police force.
[01:14:16.634 --> 01:14:18.676]  You go to New York, there's cops every 10 feet.
[01:14:18.696 --> 01:14:19.596]  They're not there to help you.
[01:14:19.996 --> 01:14:22.998]  They look like something out of a movie of a cartoon style.
[01:14:23.298 --> 01:14:25.320]  Police state, third world thug.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.541]  They're shaking people down.
[01:14:27.581 --> 01:14:28.742]  They're engaging in crimes.
[01:14:29.102 --> 01:14:30.743]  They leave the basic criminals alone.
[01:14:31.063 --> 01:14:35.466]  But if they see mainline productive citizens, they set upon you and feed on you.
[01:14:49.887 --> 01:14:53.910]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:14:54.351 --> 01:14:55.552]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:14:55.832 --> 01:15:04.319]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.902]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:15:08.183 --> 01:15:09.063]  But take heart.
[01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:12.726]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:15:13.027 --> 01:15:17.991]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Infowar.
[01:15:18.411 --> 01:15:21.952]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:23.692]  The globalists are scared.
[01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:24.972]  They've overreached.
[01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:28.433]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:15:48.217 --> 01:15:48.937]  We're good to go.

[01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:58.858]  They're right here online at mainmilitary.com.

[01:17:06.603 --> 01:17:09.285]  Mainmilitary.com is not a typical website.
[01:17:09.585 --> 01:17:12.007]  It has much more than your old surplus store.
[01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:12.847]  We're good to go.

[01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:54.803]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.682]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:25.719]  My friends, Alex Jones here from InfoWars.com with an important message concerning the 2012 presidential election.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:44.083]  In all of my years of studying politics worldwide and here in the U.S., I have never seen the establishment running scared like they are right now.
[01:19:44.263 --> 01:19:46.643]  A perfect storm is upon us.
[01:19:47.543 --> 01:19:54.866]  Everything Ron Paul talked about 30 years ago and three and a half years ago in the 2008 campaign has come true.
[01:19:55.306 --> 01:19:58.046]  The Federal Reserve has bankrupted the country by design.
[01:19:58.707 --> 01:20:03.568]  Open world government, global carbon taxes, VAT is being announced.
[01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:08.599]  Everything that he's warned us about is now unfolding.
[01:20:09.119 --> 01:20:11.259]  Our country is bankrupt from the welfare state.
[01:20:11.359 --> 01:20:12.100]  All these wars.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.880]  The federal government's out of control.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.360]  Obama's launching wars without congressional approval.
[01:20:16.781 --> 01:20:19.481]  A super congress now creates the spending bills.
[01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.982]  The president more and more is becoming a dictator.
[01:20:23.962 --> 01:20:27.763]  Our country is dominated by the Federal Reserve banking cartel.
[01:20:29.483 --> 01:20:32.564]  Ron Paul, Thursday night in the debate, had...
[01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:34.030]  We're good to go.
[01:21:02.623 --> 01:21:04.583]  Ron Paul is the American.
[01:21:04.843 --> 01:21:08.044]  Ron Paul is aligned with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[01:21:08.804 --> 01:21:11.705]  These globalists, they're the ones that aren't aligned.
[01:21:12.445 --> 01:21:16.425]  They're the ones that could care less about our republic and work for the special interest.
[01:21:16.685 --> 01:21:19.686]  You're not going to find a real constitutional president from the Democrats.
[01:21:19.966 --> 01:21:21.826]  You're not going to find it from the Republicans.
[01:21:22.646 --> 01:21:24.307]  And the media is coming after him.
[01:21:24.427 --> 01:21:31.148]  Liberal, conservatives, CBS, ABC, Fox, CNN, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh.
[01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:37.015]  On Friday, I saw the video clip of him in his studio saying, Ron Paul is dangerous.
[01:21:37.055 --> 01:21:38.516]  He'll destroy the Republican Party.
[01:21:39.197 --> 01:21:40.538]  It's nuts on parade.
[01:21:40.698 --> 01:21:42.500]  And he turned to the TV that he was watching.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.484]  He goes, look, there's Ron Paul talking in front of the ice cream stand in Iowa.
[01:21:47.984 --> 01:21:50.947]  It was funny because I had actually seen that myself that day live.
[01:21:51.487 --> 01:22:00.875]  And it was the hatred of this man who has the most conservative voting record in Congress, who is a true constitutionalist, a true libertarian.
[01:22:01.778 --> 01:22:05.901]  And there was this hate by this individual calling him a nut.
[01:22:05.982 --> 01:22:10.145]  This admitted hardcore drug addict.
[01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:18.832]  This rhino, this guy that supports all the neocons and the wars and the Patriot Act and the police state now being used against the American people.
[01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:19.672]  It's so disgusting.
[01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:21.214]  Then I learned Glenn Beck attacking.
[01:22:21.674 --> 01:22:23.075]  Remember the guy that supported the bailout?
[01:22:23.616 --> 01:22:26.478]  Who likes Mitt Romney, the Mr. Carbon Tax that Al Gore loves?
[01:22:27.395 --> 01:22:28.936]  I mean, these people are disgusting.
[01:22:28.956 --> 01:22:33.420]  They're put in there to lead conservatives and constitutionalists straight to Hades.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.741]  Just like Obama was there to lead Democrats.
[01:22:36.302 --> 01:22:37.803]  It's time for people to wake up.
[01:22:38.123 --> 01:22:43.247]  Ron Paul is popular with conservatives, libertarians, and even liberals that have any sense.
[01:22:43.971 --> 01:22:46.814]  Ron Paul at this key juncture in history is here.
[01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:49.637]  And the system is scared to death of him.
[01:22:49.697 --> 01:22:51.178]  He won the New Hampshire straw poll.
[01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.422]  In all the national polls, he comes in first, second, or third.
[01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.405]  And the media continues to put out this hoax.
[01:22:57.485 --> 01:22:58.606]  And this is the most important point.
[01:22:59.324 --> 01:23:03.726]  This mantra that he cannot win, he cannot win, he cannot win.
[01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:07.869]  Yeah, I like Ron Paul, and most talk show hosts say, but he can't win.
[01:23:07.889 --> 01:23:16.813]  This idea to try to go after the public and treat you like you're weak-minded so that you'll, quote, vote for a winner so you feel like a winner.
[01:23:17.274 --> 01:23:21.496]  Well, we've already won because Ron Paul's running and educating people about real issues.
[01:23:22.156 --> 01:23:25.238]  He is the only real candidate out there, period.
[01:23:25.798 --> 01:23:36.945]  And his decades-long work is now coming to fruition in an archetypal challenge right as America is imploding, right as everything he talked about is happening.
[01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.826]  And the system is ignoring him.
[01:23:38.846 --> 01:23:51.194]  In most news reports, even when he won CPAC two years in a row, in front of all the big conservatives, the key victory that Ronald Reagan and others won, Fox News wouldn't report it, and then finally they reported it and dubbed in booze from another speech.
[01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:53.816]  This is the deception.
[01:23:54.517 --> 01:23:57.542]  This is the level of manipulation.
[01:23:57.942 --> 01:24:04.733]  If you want to go against the establishment, if you want to go against the status quo, look at the entire status quo attacking Ron Paul.
[01:24:05.013 --> 01:24:07.457]  Look at how scared they are of him.
[01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:12.226]  Go back online and watch that debate from Thursday.
[01:24:12.507 --> 01:24:17.370]  How the questioners at the debate were trying to make him look bad and attacking him.
[01:24:17.611 --> 01:24:19.772]  How everyone on stage was attacking him.
[01:24:20.032 --> 01:24:21.574]  Because they're all establishment.
[01:24:21.594 --> 01:24:22.574]  They're all globalists.
[01:24:22.614 --> 01:24:26.618]  They're all bought and paid for by the special interests that run this country.
[01:24:26.718 --> 01:24:28.159]  America doesn't have long.
[01:24:28.886 --> 01:24:30.828]  We are at a crossroads, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:31.328 --> 01:24:34.591]  And don't be like Judas Iscariot, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and others.
[01:24:35.211 --> 01:24:37.833]  Don't wish later you wouldn't have taken that 30 pieces of silver.
[01:24:38.014 --> 01:24:46.220]  Rush, you said two years ago you were no longer going to carry the Republicans' water anymore, that you'd been a hack, and that they were basically corrupt and just as bad as the Democrats.
[01:24:47.181 --> 01:24:49.023]  But now you're flipping right back to it.
[01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:52.986]  You only did that to try to keep your dwindling audience that's waking up to you.
[01:24:53.846 --> 01:25:03.614]  You know, if you guys don't stand up for the Republic and Ron Paul, a true constitutionalist, because it's the right thing to do, you should do it because that's what's popular.
[01:25:04.435 --> 01:25:07.277]  You should because there's no future for this country.
[01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:20.628]  There is no future for a system where they laugh at Ron Paul because he wants Americans to be able to have trials, because he doesn't want Americans to be able to be killed by the government.
[01:25:21.224 --> 01:25:22.304]  That's now on the books.
[01:25:22.545 --> 01:25:25.606]  We have all of this tyranny taking place.
[01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:33.749]  And the entire system from all points of the compass is attacking Ron Paul because he is a major frontrunner.
[01:25:34.369 --> 01:25:37.550]  He is a major frontrunner in the top three in many polls.
[01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:38.651]  Number one.
[01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:39.671]  He could win.
[01:25:39.951 --> 01:25:41.112]  He could be our president.
[01:25:41.532 --> 01:25:41.992]  He could...
[01:25:42.732 --> 01:25:43.473]  We're good to go.
[01:26:03.394 --> 01:26:07.577]  He can't win kept you from voting for Ron Paul and supporting him.
[01:26:07.657 --> 01:26:08.818]  It's time for Republicans.
[01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:10.339]  It's time for Democrats.
[01:26:10.659 --> 01:26:11.740]  It's time for Libertarians.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:20.045]  It's time for everybody to really think about the fact that Ron Paul has never compromised and has always done what he said he would do.
[01:26:20.828 --> 01:26:28.555]  And that even if you don't totally agree with some of his policies, we need somebody who's bona fide, somebody who's real, somebody who can be trusted.
[01:26:28.815 --> 01:26:30.477]  The system is coming after him.
[01:26:30.577 --> 01:26:33.780]  That is a massive endorsement of Ron Paul.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:42.087]  And it is so sickening to watch those establishment whores up there on TV attacking and the cowardly Republicans in that debate
[01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.091]  Openly pushing tyranny like it's good.
[01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:49.853]  And to see Ron Paul like a lion in winter standing up to those hyenas, to those jackals.
[01:26:50.293 --> 01:26:53.555]  I'll be covering it more on the radio and at Infowars.com.
[01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:56.616]  We've got key reports up there dealing with the hoax.
[01:26:57.535 --> 01:26:58.716]  That Ron Paul can't win?
[01:26:59.016 --> 01:27:01.338]  Dealing with the fact that the establishment is scared to death.
[01:27:01.358 --> 01:27:02.999]  They're scared to death for a reason.
[01:27:03.299 --> 01:27:04.760]  They know they're bringing in tyranny.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.441]  They know the people are waking up to them.
[01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.963]  They know that the Federal Reserve is unpopular.
[01:27:09.183 --> 01:27:12.825]  And they know that Ron Paul could become president.
[01:27:13.265 --> 01:27:14.446]  We're at a historic point.
[01:27:15.006 --> 01:27:18.709]  Get out there and defend Ron Paul and expose the hoax that he can't win.
[01:27:18.729 --> 01:27:21.471]  I'm Alex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:27:25.757 --> 01:27:28.119]  We're good to go.

[01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:24.953]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:30:25.113 --> 01:30:30.855]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for retirement.
[01:30:30.935 --> 01:30:34.297]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:30:34.577 --> 01:30:37.179]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:31:53.224 --> 01:31:53.984]  Search no more.
[01:31:54.104 --> 01:31:55.125]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:55.145 --> 01:31:55.585]  Big Brother.
[01:31:55.605 --> 01:31:56.586]  Mainstream Media.
[01:32:11.489 --> 01:32:13.733]  Government cover-ups.
[01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:15.435]  You want answers?
[01:32:15.976 --> 01:32:17.878]  Well, so does he.
[01:32:18.039 --> 01:32:24.227]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:32:35.909 --> 01:33:01.540]  You know, if you're watching us on prisonplanet.tv as we stream the radio show in London Colour, you could see the footage we're about to play in Vancouver, Canada, of people rioting and burning things when their team lost, or when people's teams win, large areas in major cities of Brazil being burned.
[01:33:03.061 --> 01:33:04.262]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.302 --> 01:33:04.783]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.803 --> 01:33:05.443]  We're good to go.
[01:33:21.849 --> 01:33:22.790]  This is beautiful.
[01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:23.611]  This is wonderful.
[01:33:24.091 --> 01:33:33.480]  No, it's not revolution when San Francisco Giants fans post on Craigslist, beat a Dodger day, encourage murder of a Dodgers fan.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.520]  That's a quote.
[01:33:36.062 --> 01:33:46.111]  And Twitter is saying that they're going to continue to leave the accounts up of people who are calling for violence, burning, and looting on Twitter.
[01:33:46.676 --> 01:33:52.419]  Well, of course, Twitter was used to overthrow the old dictator, Hazi Mubarak.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.563]  It was used to then help put in the Muslim Brotherhood and oppress people even more.
[01:34:00.964 --> 01:34:03.145]  Because that's what the CIA and MI6 wanted.
[01:34:04.298 --> 01:34:18.070]  And now Twitter is being used over in England according to looting and robbing and burning because the government's going to use it to ram through curfews and martial law rules and to shoot people on site for politically protesting.
[01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:24.775]  You see, this is a more drawn-out version of what happened in 1999 when, for 24 hours, the hired...
[01:34:28.715 --> 01:34:32.177]  Warehoused anarchists were flown in by major foundations.
[01:34:32.237 --> 01:34:34.339]  I have it all on video in Police State 2.
[01:34:34.379 --> 01:34:35.920]  The takeover.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:44.805]  The police on tape admitting they were ordered to stand down and let the looters attack and burn in Seattle so the news could say, why don't they do something?
[01:34:45.306 --> 01:34:46.827]  Why don't they stand up against them?
[01:34:47.327 --> 01:34:56.213]  So then the looters could pull back, move into a government building right next to the police department under police guard, flown in,
[01:34:57.179 --> 01:35:05.023]  And so the police could then attack old ladies who were part of the protest against the World Trade Organization.
[01:35:07.344 --> 01:35:09.385]  Now, that's all that's happening here.
[01:35:10.945 --> 01:35:23.591]  That's all that's happening here is the police stood down Sunday, they stood down Monday, they stood down Tuesday, and now David Cameron, that carbon tax-promoting, New World Order slimebag...
[01:35:24.864 --> 01:35:29.806]  Is saying that we might use water cannons on a 24-hour notice.
[01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.167]  It's ridiculous.
[01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.247]  They know who these people are.
[01:35:36.228 --> 01:35:44.550]  They could have three days ago, off of positive IDs of thousands of these people, arrested them, put them on the news, made an example of them.
[01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:53.173]  But instead, they're going to let it get out of control, out of control, out of control, until finally the police start shooting people with real bullets.
[01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:59.533]  And then the precedent's going to be set not to shoot somebody trying to burn your house down.
[01:36:01.894 --> 01:36:04.916]  Not to shoot somebody trying to burn your house down.
[01:36:07.838 --> 01:36:08.058]  No.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.802]  But shooting someone who goes and protests at the Parliament.
[01:36:14.831 --> 01:36:19.675]  You know, for several years, you haven't been allowed to protest anywhere around Parliament.
[01:36:20.095 --> 01:36:22.677]  I went there to peacefully speak on a bullhorn.
[01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:27.140]  And even though it was a week before the law went into place, they told me to leave or I'd be arrested.
[01:36:27.441 --> 01:36:28.401]  That's in Terror Storm.
[01:36:29.883 --> 01:36:30.543]  One of my films.
[01:36:31.464 --> 01:36:35.467]  If you tried to go down and burn areas of Parliament, you would have been shot Sunday.
[01:36:36.087 --> 01:36:37.628]  Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
[01:36:38.949 --> 01:36:43.653]  But, because the hooligans, that's all this is, is a branch of the soccer hooligans...
[01:36:45.094 --> 01:37:00.242]  Because they're burning down five-generation clothiers and four-generation watch shops and four-generation furniture shops because they're dragging people out of their cars at barricades and beating them up.
[01:37:01.103 --> 01:37:10.488]  Because that's happening, the police are standing down to let this get out of hand so the giant police state the British government has set up, the UK government has set up, can be...
[01:37:11.505 --> 01:37:15.628]  Drop down like a hammer vice on the public of England.
[01:37:16.769 --> 01:37:20.091]  And so I agree with Steve Watson from one angle.
[01:37:20.611 --> 01:37:29.297]  If you're just looking at this in a two-dimensional way, knee-jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters on sight.
[01:37:30.919 --> 01:37:32.960]  Well, that would mean somebody out after dark, wouldn't it?
[01:37:34.494 --> 01:37:42.540]  But then it goes on, the Member of Parliament said, time to get tough, bring in the Army, shoot looters and arsonists on site.
[01:37:43.601 --> 01:37:45.642]  Arsonists should be shot on site.
[01:37:46.163 --> 01:37:53.608]  And people attacking fire department people, already risking their lives, battling fires with women jumping out of it, they should be shot.
[01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:55.249]  That's attempted murder.
[01:37:56.510 --> 01:38:01.214]  Setting fires to people's houses and businesses is an act that could kill a lot of people.
[01:38:02.248 --> 01:38:07.732]  If I ran up to you with a burning torch and said, I'm going to set you on fire, would you have a right to defend yourself?
[01:38:07.852 --> 01:38:08.433]  Absolutely.
[01:38:08.953 --> 01:38:16.038]  But see, this is the psychological manipulation to where now they're going to hold back, not do what they're supposed to do.
[01:38:16.539 --> 01:38:17.900]  Did you tell me we had him because I didn't hear you?
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.261]  Okay, good.
[01:38:19.301 --> 01:38:19.621]  Thank you.
[01:38:21.222 --> 01:38:21.462]  Great.
[01:38:23.084 --> 01:38:24.525]  Because I didn't hear anything over the mic.
[01:38:27.627 --> 01:38:28.708]  What's going on here?
[01:38:30.254 --> 01:38:33.900]  Is very simple at one level, but also very sophisticated.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.964]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[01:38:36.801 --> 01:38:40.185]  And you've got generation after generation of people dependent on welfare.
[01:38:40.445 --> 01:38:41.446]  You've got globalism.
[01:38:41.486 --> 01:38:43.047]  You've got deindustrialization.
[01:38:43.448 --> 01:38:46.491]  You've got people living on subsistence level, handouts.
[01:38:46.511 --> 01:38:49.975]  You've got a middle class scared of the giant swelling underclass.
[01:38:50.275 --> 01:39:00.045]  And you've got the social engineers who've all got their mountain retreats outside of England, outside of Europe, outside of the U.S., sitting back and manipulating the whole thing.
[01:39:00.525 --> 01:39:02.385]  And I predicted it all with precision.
[01:39:02.405 --> 01:39:25.070]  I told you a year ago, six months ago, over and over again, find the clips where I said society's going to degenerate, the austerity's going to come in, the welfare hordes are going to riot, an expanded version of a sports riot, the middle class is going to get scared, the globalists are going to stand back, let the riots run their course, and then later...
[01:39:26.235 --> 01:39:30.301]  When the public is begging for total tyranny, come in and beg for it.
[01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:37.050]  Come in and beg for the end of Magna Carta, the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution.
[01:39:38.531 --> 01:39:39.072]  We're good to go.
[01:40:00.289 --> 01:40:01.390]  Well, you do what you can, obviously.
[01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.492]  But, I mean, this is a big story we've got today.
[01:40:03.512 --> 01:40:04.352]  The police were ordered to...
[01:40:20.285 --> 01:40:27.790]  Because the police have been ordered to stand back and do nothing, we've got videos of these vigilante groups springing up now.
[01:40:50.555 --> 01:41:19.877]  Which are a very complex thing because they're made up not only of people that genuinely do want to protect their community and rightly so and their families and stuff like that in the absence of the police doing so but you know these groups are also made up of a different kind of a different kind of yob mentality and it's this sort of division between these communities that is
[01:41:25.394 --> 01:41:28.095]  Absolutely, as society breaks into gangs.
[01:41:28.575 --> 01:41:31.897]  And the article is at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:41:32.397 --> 01:41:34.898]  This is big news when you get this out to everybody.
[01:41:35.258 --> 01:41:42.141]  But we also need to point out that the police many times, if they can't get welfare folks to riot, they'll go out and do it themselves, dressed as anarchists.
[01:41:50.029 --> 01:41:55.534]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[01:41:55.874 --> 01:41:58.996]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:56.721]  GCN.
[01:45:57.261 --> 01:45:59.522]  Great talk radio starts here.
[01:46:00.422 --> 01:46:05.524]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:05.844 --> 01:46:08.145]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:18.842]  Well, 12 years ago in England, the United States, Europe, they all started getting the riot police ready.
[01:46:19.842 --> 01:46:31.046]  We've covered the flash mob reports by the British Ministry of Defense four years ago, the Department of Defense three years ago, laying out how all this would happen and how a police state would be needed.
[01:46:31.849 --> 01:46:36.410]  And it'll be executed against the general population that's non-violent and non-criminal.
[01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:43.732]  That's why under this social engineering system, it is absolutely imperative that the general public be disarmed.
[01:46:44.352 --> 01:46:56.936]  Because you can't play the giant, poor, welfare, disenfranchised, thug culture that's been popularized by MTV and made to be sexy.
[01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:05.077]  Off against the scared chicken-necked middle class if you don't have a scared chicken-necked middle class.
[01:47:05.848 --> 01:47:15.772]  And joining us is an American journalist who's lived in London for many years, and he's done great reports for us from Copenhagen Summit and other events, is Patrick Henningsen.
[01:47:16.552 --> 01:47:20.874]  And Max Keiser's coming up in about 30 minutes to give us his view on this.
[01:47:21.154 --> 01:47:23.835]  He scolded us in an email that we had it all wrong.
[01:47:23.875 --> 01:47:29.138]  This was a glorious liberation happening of the iPods and things.
[01:47:29.158 --> 01:47:32.119]  And I don't usually disagree with Keiser, but...
[01:47:33.298 --> 01:47:35.479]  But he'll straighten me out here in a moment.
[01:47:36.179 --> 01:47:37.759]  After all, I'm just a dumb American.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.281]  Patrick Henningsen, you're an American over in London.
[01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:48.262]  You witnessed attacks, barricades, what appeared to be racial attacks.
[01:47:48.362 --> 01:47:51.383]  Obviously, most of this now is just general criminal looting.
[01:47:51.623 --> 01:47:55.525]  Can you give us the full spectrum analysis of exactly what's happening?
[01:47:55.545 --> 01:47:56.665]  Because this can't happen
[01:47:57.285 --> 01:48:00.008]  In a country, in a city, where the public is armed.
[01:48:00.028 --> 01:48:06.053]  This could only happen in places like Chicago, New York, or Greater England.
[01:48:06.113 --> 01:48:09.696]  And, of course, we have the secret immigration program of Tony Blair.
[01:48:09.736 --> 01:48:13.580]  Now they've brought in the entitled groups.
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:21.226]  They have the disheveled, drunken British kids that were born there, just as out of control.
[01:48:21.927 --> 01:48:23.889]  And it is quite a recipe.
[01:48:25.982 --> 01:48:26.222]  Yeah.
[01:48:26.462 --> 01:48:27.022]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:27.062 --> 01:48:27.322]  Thanks.
[01:48:27.823 --> 01:48:50.650]  Yeah, listen, what you have here, what's been expressed in the last three or four days in this country is the culmination of a social experiment that's been going on starting with Margaret Thatcher through 10 years of Tony Blair government and now obviously into the David Cameron's coalition, conservative liberal Democrat government.
[01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:52.170]  It's a social experiment.
[01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:53.611]  It's failed horribly.
[01:48:54.472 --> 01:49:12.382]  And I'll top it off with the point that I wanted to make yesterday, which I didn't make, was the government and this country have set their priorities over the last 10 years of bombing and pillaging innocent people in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently in Libya.
[01:49:13.421 --> 01:49:20.505]  We're spending $800,000 per cruise missile, dropping 7,000 of those in the first week.
[01:49:20.965 --> 01:49:22.086]  That's where our money's going.
[01:49:22.346 --> 01:49:23.646]  That's where their priority is.
[01:49:24.227 --> 01:49:26.488]  And they've taken their eye off the ball in this country.
[01:49:27.048 --> 01:49:34.732]  And sadly, I could have told you this is coming a long time ago, and so could everybody else in my neighborhood and anyone else who's lived in the city.
[01:49:35.552 --> 01:49:36.793]  It's particularly vulnerable.
[01:49:37.413 --> 01:49:40.656]  To the sort of escalation that we've seen in the last 72 hours.
[01:49:40.676 --> 01:49:45.421]  You know, you've got young kids who've had their culture imported from America.
[01:49:45.901 --> 01:49:57.892]  What's meaningful for British young kids between the age of 12 and 18, American baseball caps, Nike trainers, track suits, hip-hop, Snoop Doggy dog.
[01:49:58.253 --> 01:50:00.215]  This is a culture which isn't even British.
[01:50:01.176 --> 01:50:13.167]  And let's be honest, that fake MTV culture that's only about 20 years old is a gang prison culture.
[01:50:13.187 --> 01:50:19.213]  You know, the young kids don't know that when they let pants hang down over their hind end, that means I am a...
[01:50:20.294 --> 01:50:20.874]  We're good to go.
[01:50:20.894 --> 01:50:21.034]  I think?
[01:50:40.783 --> 01:50:41.624]  We're good to go.
[01:50:41.664 --> 01:50:41.924]  I think?
[01:51:04.385 --> 01:51:13.142]  With just zombie-like creatures running around in all directions, this is a genius psychic warhead that they've launched into us with precision.
[01:51:15.063 --> 01:51:23.887]  From an objective point of view, you can say very safely that in this country, and in America it's the same, you have millions of disaffected youth.
[01:51:24.248 --> 01:51:25.168]  They have no vision.
[01:51:25.188 --> 01:51:30.971]  They have no opportunity, because all the jobs have been exported to the Far East and elsewhere.
[01:51:30.991 --> 01:51:32.832]  They have essentially no future.
[01:51:33.332 --> 01:51:35.313]  All they have is this cheap import culture.
[01:51:35.593 --> 01:51:36.814]  They have brands.
[01:51:37.134 --> 01:51:38.655]  They have brands they can look up to.
[01:51:38.995 --> 01:51:42.837]  They have music artists who are way overpaid, footballers,
[01:51:43.257 --> 01:51:44.718]  That's it.
[01:51:44.778 --> 01:51:45.659]  That's all they get.
[01:51:45.779 --> 01:51:53.243]  So these retail riots, the mainstream media are saying that, oh, this is because of austerity cuts and social services have been cut.
[01:51:53.503 --> 01:51:56.625]  But you know why this has kicked off into commercial riots?
[01:51:56.945 --> 01:51:58.386]  It's not because of the government.
[01:51:58.566 --> 01:52:01.008]  The state hasn't necessarily failed these people.
[01:52:01.268 --> 01:52:04.330]  It's because the cheap credit was cut off three years ago.
[01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:06.312]  No, they are totally desperate.
[01:52:31.152 --> 01:52:31.853]  We're good to go.
[01:52:59.586 --> 01:53:02.529]  But here's the bigger issue, Patrick.
[01:53:03.029 --> 01:53:05.091]  The police now have admitted they were ordered to stand down.
[01:53:05.671 --> 01:53:10.255]  And Cameron's letting this get worse and worse and worse, so they can then bring in...
[01:53:11.281 --> 01:53:13.302]  Starting tomorrow, all perfectly timed.
[01:53:13.322 --> 01:53:16.123]  He didn't call back Parliament on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:53:16.463 --> 01:53:18.624]  He called it on Tuesday back for Thursday.
[01:53:19.144 --> 01:53:31.428]  At its height, with more burning and nothing being done, they will come in and pass totally draconian laws that will restrict the general public's rights ahead of true austerity and crackdowns.
[01:53:31.768 --> 01:53:36.430]  And they will probably go ahead and say, we're going to start shooting to kill anybody who politically protests.
[01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:50.271]  I mean, what they've done, for the first time on British mainland, this is not counting Northern Ireland, they're now authorizing that the police can have rubber bullets or plastic bullets in their rounds, and they will shoot losers on sight.
[01:53:50.531 --> 01:53:54.054]  This is something that is, it's the first time in history on the British mainland.
[01:53:54.334 --> 01:53:55.695]  This is normal in Belfast.
[01:53:55.775 --> 01:53:57.036]  Of course, if you live in Belfast,
[01:53:57.416 --> 01:54:11.393]  And I've spoken to Northern Irish people, and they're just kind of shaking their heads, like, because if this happened in Belfast, basically, water cannons would be out, they would just be spraying these kids all over the street, plastic bullets would be shot, and you can disperse crowds quite quickly.
[01:54:11.714 --> 01:54:16.600]  It's a fine line to walk between law and order and the security police state.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.063]  Normally we'd have this debate 15 years ago, and it'd be a totally different discussion.
[01:54:21.383 --> 01:54:25.506]  But now the police state has moved so far forward into people's lives.
[01:54:25.826 --> 01:54:30.050]  The state has moved so far forward into people's lives that this is a natural progression.
[01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:38.676]  For people who are anarchists, for people who say they were doing this for freedom and against the establishment, they've just kicked the ball into their own goal.
[01:54:39.457 --> 01:54:43.142]  And the root of this is first they had to disarm the Brits.
[01:54:57.532 --> 01:54:58.172]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.212 --> 01:54:58.493]  I think?
[01:55:18.286 --> 01:55:24.849]  This has all been allowed because the public can't defend themselves and the police stood down and let it get to this point.
[01:55:25.309 --> 01:55:26.470]  People do have a right.
[01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:34.794]  I mean, if you were inside that pub barricaded in Sunday night and they were trying to set fire to you inside of it, you would be insane to not go out and defend yourself.
[01:55:35.154 --> 01:55:39.436]  But in this gelded, castrated world, that is the ultimate crime.
[01:55:40.532 --> 01:55:42.054]  Yeah, that's what we've come to.
[01:55:42.094 --> 01:55:45.237]  People are waiting for the state to come and sort it out.
[01:55:45.457 --> 01:55:47.539]  People are saying, oh, the police, are they going to be there?
[01:55:47.559 --> 01:55:48.480]  Are the police going to be there?
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.804]  Listen, if this goes down again, I'm talking to my neighbors.
[01:55:53.145 --> 01:55:54.566]  We're going to exchange phone numbers.
[01:55:54.846 --> 01:55:56.188]  We're going to have a list.
[01:55:56.208 --> 01:55:57.269]  And everyone's going to have
[01:55:57.689 --> 01:56:01.973]  And by the way, as you restore order, they will send the cops and tell you you can't do it.
[01:56:21.539 --> 01:56:30.883]  Well, the Prime Minister would save a whole lot of money and a whole lot of resources if you let communities self-organize a little bit.
[01:56:30.923 --> 01:56:36.225]  But what that will be, that's forbidden because that's basically saying you're no longer dependent on the state.
[01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.589]  We're good to go.
[01:57:05.384 --> 01:57:07.665]  Thanks again for listening to GCNlive.com.
[01:57:07.705 --> 01:57:09.606]  Again, that's GCNlive.com.
[01:57:09.846 --> 01:57:10.886]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:57:10.966 --> 01:57:15.268]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:57:15.448 --> 01:57:21.090]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:57:21.170 --> 01:57:24.491]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:57:24.531 --> 01:57:25.772]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:57:25.792 --> 01:57:25.932]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:57:25.972 --> 01:57:27.152]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
