[00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:10.146]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:11.728]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.289]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:23.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.780]  Well, we are live!
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.602]  We are entering our number 25.
[00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.210]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.313]  I know a lot of you are watching out across the world on the free video streams up at InfoWars.com and InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:43.054]  Tyranny Crusher 2 just went for $3,500 on eBay.
[00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:48.677]  I want to thank the folks that are supporting us so we can get more equipment and do things like that.
[00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:51.838]  We've got a lot of other stuff, different auctions going.
[00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:59.301]  We've signed pro-liberty memorabilia, InfoWars memorabilia, all up at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.727]  That has a link on it to the eBay area.
[00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:05.807]  We've had a big successful Money Bomb so far.
[00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:10.989]  We're doing about like the Money Bomb the year before last.
[00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.990]  We're at about $250,000 right now.
[00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.730]  I'm told they're about to update it.
[00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.091]  And of course there's a lot of mail come in and a lot of things we're auctioning.
[00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:25.433]  And the Money Bomb will continue on out into the weekend as it always does.
[00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.754]  And so I would imagine we're probably gonna get up to
[00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.878]  Around $400,000, which is really a good goal.
[00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:39.003]  I mean, I'd like to fill the rocket so we can launch it at the globalist of the info war all the way.
[00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.527]  But I want to thank all of you that have supported the money bomb.
[00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:47.171]  And I've told people, it needs to be middle class people.
[00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:51.535]  It needs to be folks that have extra money that donate to the alternative media.
[00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:53.457]  I'm not like a preacher up here saying, you know.
[00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.317]  You know, sell whatever and support us that way.
[00:01:56.317 --> 00:01:57.878]  Just spread the word about the show.
[00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:00.718]  That's the most important thing anybody can do.
[00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:04.299]  When you buy the books, the videos, support our sponsors, it just does an incredible job.
[00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.179]  And again, I want to thank everybody.
[00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.559]  The Money Bomb's still going right now.
[00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.620]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com is your chance to donate and be part of it.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.221]  But as we stand right now, it's a little over a quarter million, which will let us hire at least three people, more equipment, and more bandwidth and things.
[00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.482]  That's going to be a big help, to put that 100%.
[00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.250]  I don't
[00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:42.686]  I think?
[00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:11.775]  It's just our overall output against the Globalist has absolutely intensified.
[00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.379]  And so I want to commend and thank everybody out there.
[00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.063]  Again, I just cannot thank you enough.
[00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.785]  I'm obviously a little bit punch drunk here.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.381]  I think I'm even more tired than I was last year.
[00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:27.942]  Man, I am just absolutely hammered right now with being tired.
[00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:29.342]  I'm a wimp.
[00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.723]  I don't know how people do these.
[00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:32.763]  What's the record, guys?
[00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:34.084]  Google record filibuster.
[00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:39.145]  I know it's the Texas House of Representatives, maybe the Texas Senate back in the 60s.
[00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:40.045]  It's over two days.
[00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:48.328]  I mean, can you imagine not being able to sit down, not being able to eat, not being able to go to the bathroom, and not being able to shut up?
[00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.328]  I mean, I just...
[00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:52.331]  Can't even imagine that.
[00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:57.512]  I am certainly a wimp, compared to the people like that.
[00:03:57.512 --> 00:04:04.293]  We got Alan Watt, always extremely informative, coming up in the next segment on world events.
[00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:08.974]  Jesse Ventura, I'll tell more of him when we come back from break, called me last night.
[00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:13.835]  He's set to have a press conference in about 55 minutes out front of the federal courthouse in Minneapolis.
[00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:18.256]  And then he's going to try to call in after that, or he may even call in before, but I think he said he'll probably call in after.
[00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:24.857]  He doesn't carry a cell phone, but his wife has one, Terry, and he's got the hotline number.
[00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:33.348]  So if Ventura calls him, whatever guests we've got on, whether it's Jim Mars or Alan, I'm sure they'll be able to, they'll be happy to go into timeout.
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.290]  Time out like I was a kid.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.203]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.104]  Number 1.
[00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:09.547]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.547 --> 00:05:10.407]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:15.291]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:16.031]  It's true.
[00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.915]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:21.736]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:25.318]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:29.021]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:30.021]  Number four.
[00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:36.463]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.463 --> 00:05:37.243]  Number five.
[00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:41.384]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:46.446]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:50.627]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:52.408]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:57.009]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:58.270]  877-327-0365.
[00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.293]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:08.616]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:10.137]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:18.942]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:27.187]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:35.212]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:42.597]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.584]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:50.828]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:53.071]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:05.492]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:08.733]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:13.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:07:13.895 --> 00:07:19.916]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.157]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:22.997]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:23.277]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:23.837]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:24.638]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:26.278]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:43.725]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:48.887]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.887 --> 00:08:01.153]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:06.696]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.902 --> 00:08:12.523]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:22.046]  It is Friday, the fourth day of November 2011, and we have been live now for 24 hours.
[00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:28.769]  We've been live for 24 hours, going into the 25th, 26th, and 27th hour today.
[00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:33.831]  And coming up, we have Paul Joseph Watson, our PrisonPlanet.com reporter.
[00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:37.953]  We also have Cutting Through the Matrix researcher, always informative.
[00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:42.217]  And thought-provoking and incisive information.
[00:08:42.217 --> 00:08:51.946]  Alan Watt, Jim Marr's best-selling author, crime reporter, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, first person to teach a JFK-level, college-level course.
[00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:55.830]  He's going to be joining us to talk about world events and what's happening coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.250]  Now listen.
[00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:06.479]  Jesse Ventura called me last night while I was on air while I was interviewing Alfred Adask because we're doing this 27-hour marathon broadcast and I saw it was Ventura.
[00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:11.144]  I answered the phone and I'd already had a call from Tyrell who's flying out of Los Angeles.
[00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:16.048]  He's on the plane, his son, with the bad news that the federal judge threw out the case.
[00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:16.989]  You don't get a day in court.
[00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:29.053]  TSA, I mean, you know, lamp poles with microphones in them, cancer viruses in the vaccines, totally open borders, the super congress running everything, the president legalizing...
[00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.332]  Aggravated felons who are illegals.
[00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:35.193]  Just total lawlessness.
[00:09:35.193 --> 00:09:37.014]  Peace prize to warmongers.
[00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:41.636]  Torture, secret arrest, the troops openly growing opium in Afghanistan publicly.
[00:09:41.636 --> 00:09:44.898]  Just complete and absolute abject evil.
[00:09:44.898 --> 00:09:47.459]  And Ventura was not even angry.
[00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:49.280]  He was more just speechless.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.081]  He said stunned.
[00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:53.883]  And he said I'll let you know as soon as the ruling came through.
[00:09:56.992 --> 00:10:00.053]  I even knew about it before it hit the news wires, about 10 minutes before.
[00:10:00.053 --> 00:10:01.793]  It was funny to get the news first.
[00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:04.794]  I got that from Tyrell, and Vern Turek called me about an hour later to let me know.
[00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:15.656]  But the point is, he's... I'm a big cell phone user, and he will be mobbed, probably at the press conference at noon, coming up in about 50 minutes, at the federal courthouse.
[00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:20.717]  And guys, I want you guys to find the local news there, because undoubtedly they're probably going to have it live.
[00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:23.118]  At least on the web.
[00:10:23.118 --> 00:10:24.760]  We'll carry a few minutes of that.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:35.308]  And then with our guests, I'm sure our guests will understand, if and when Ventura calls in, and he said he would, but he's going to call the hotline and stuff, so we'll see what happens with that.
[00:10:35.308 --> 00:10:36.969]  He may end up calling in in the third hour.
[00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:45.695]  Quite frankly, I was going to punch out in the third hour and have Watson come in, because I'm not tough like other people.
[00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:47.216]  Bill Mayer,
[00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.345]  That has the longest filibuster in U.S.
[00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:53.487]  history.
[00:10:53.487 --> 00:11:06.118]  And in May of 1977, near the close of the regular session, he spoke for 43 hours against a workers' compensation bill.
[00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:10.122]  So, and you're not allowed to go to the bathroom, you're not allowed to sit down, you're not allowed to lean.
[00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:11.603]  You could talk continually.
[00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:12.484]  I cannot imagine that.
[00:11:13.578 --> 00:11:16.581]  Now, a lot of times they just start babbling after a while and ho-ho them.
[00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.285]  The problem is here, you've got guests on, I find it all to be thought-provoking.
[00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:23.107]  I'm actually paying attention to what people are saying.
[00:11:23.107 --> 00:11:26.370]  I'm actually paying attention to what people are doing.
[00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.594]  I'm thinking, so I think that's what is so incredibly exhausting about it.
[00:11:29.594 --> 00:11:35.039]  Now, some of the news, obviously, Obama tells allies the U.S.
[00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.941]  will attack Iran by fall of
[00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:44.758]  2012, so now there may be some can kicking, but Israel said they're getting ready to strike.
[00:11:44.758 --> 00:11:49.242]  Who knows what's going to happen.
[00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.663]  Also, we got another report here.
[00:11:50.663 --> 00:11:53.405]  Fluoride, the calcifier of the soul.
[00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:57.469]  Again, Jesse Ventura to give a statement about judge dismissing TSA lawsuit.
[00:11:57.469 --> 00:12:02.132]  Thanks to Obama, the Al-Qaeda flag is now flying high and proud over Libya.
[00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:02.773]  That's confirmed.
[00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:04.194]  Al-Qaeda has been given control.
[00:12:04.194 --> 00:12:05.975]  The media here won't cover it, but it's in the foreign news.
[00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:08.017]  We got the David Icke interview up there.
[00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:09.338]  It was pretty powerful yesterday.
[00:12:09.338 --> 00:12:10.639]  I remember who we are.
[00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:14.541]  George Norrie was also joined us and so many others.
[00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:18.144]  SWAT team kills a Marine veteran at their home.
[00:12:18.144 --> 00:12:21.066]  They wouldn't let the ambulance help in the new report from Courthouse News.
[00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:23.327]  More details on that case.
[00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:28.991]  And then obviously we've got all the regular stuff that's happening and going on around the world.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.023]  Continuing here, they're lying and still saying unemployment is 9%.
[00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:36.964]  Every real economist says it's above 22%.
[00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:42.589]  Israeli Navy boards Gaza-bound boat, orders Flotilla to change course.
[00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:43.109]  No go.
[00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:45.091]  Judge tosses Jesse Ventura airport scans.
[00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:46.412]  I'm reading drudge here.
[00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:50.095]  Nearly 200 tons of prescription drugs have been turned in.
[00:12:50.095 --> 00:12:55.419]  Part of this DEA, turn your pills in thing.
[00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:56.080]  Continuing.
[00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:01.762]  Too much time sitting increases risk of developing cancer.
[00:13:01.762 --> 00:13:02.182]  No kidding.
[00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:04.802]  Your body's then not oxygenated.
[00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:06.543]  All of that is going on.
[00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:15.405]  ACORN officials scramble, firing workers and shredding documents that were exposed as players behind the scenes trying to take over Occupy Wall Street.
[00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:19.466]  Union chief says we need more militancy to occupy protesters.
[00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:23.067]  But the left's always claiming anybody that's into the Constitution is violent.
[00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.367]  You're for freedom, you're violent.
[00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:27.368]  Ron Paul and Alex Jones, MSNBC, say they want violence.
[00:13:27.368 --> 00:13:27.648]  Really?
[00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:31.868]  Really like your peace president?
[00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:34.869]  And Greece is in turmoil over debt plan.
[00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:37.370]  EU is weighing an exit.
[00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.691]  Sarkozy's asking the U.S.
[00:13:38.691 --> 00:13:39.011]  for help.
[00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:40.771]  You've already given trillions, obviously.
[00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:43.412]  Not to the banker bailout, but to the banker tax.
[00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:45.773]  China is jailed.
[00:13:45.773 --> 00:13:47.534]  A grandmother organized a protest.
[00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:49.405]  I don't know.
[00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:11.897]  InfoWarsMoneybomb.com
[00:14:31.178 --> 00:14:41.396]  We're gonna restream it 27 hours straight, including the premiere of the behind-the-scenes skull-and-bone information from the lady who first released the information to Anthony Sutton back in the 80s.
[00:14:42.978 --> 00:14:45.119]  So you can write America's Secret Establishment.
[00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:46.099]  She's now released even more.
[00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:50.181]  Of course, her dad and others in her family was, I don't know, two of them were skull and bones.
[00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.662]  And we sent a crew up there, and we weren't sitting on the interview.
[00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:56.583]  We're just so busy with other things, we never got that interview out, because there's eight hours of it.
[00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:59.204]  And Aaron's put out an hour of it, and that premiered at 7 a.m.
[00:14:59.204 --> 00:15:02.186]  this morning at PrisonPlanet.tv in the streams for everybody.
[00:15:02.186 --> 00:15:07.208]  If you want to support us, you can also do a 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv, if you like it.
[00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:07.608]  Continue.
[00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:09.494]  That's going right now.
[00:15:09.494 --> 00:15:11.596]  If you just joined us, I sound a little bit different again.
[00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:14.058]  I've just done 20 plus, 24 hours here.
[00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:17.881]  And a little bit tired.
[00:15:17.881 --> 00:15:21.123]  Okay, let's go to Alan Watt.
[00:15:21.123 --> 00:15:24.086]  Alan, so much is happening in the world.
[00:15:24.086 --> 00:15:27.969]  I've got all my questions, but I want to get into what you think is most important right now.
[00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.492]  But we're seeing just an acceleration of the program.
[00:15:31.492 --> 00:15:33.494]  The street lamps, we already knew, had microphones.
[00:15:33.494 --> 00:15:34.615]  Many of them, now they're admitting it.
[00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:36.896]  The chemtrails, they're now admitting it and saying it's for your own good.
[00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:51.568]  The plan to give us forced inoculations and release mosquitoes that put nanotech viruses into us to re-engineer our brains, give us basically servile lobotomies where we can't get angry or whatever, that's all being announced.
[00:15:51.568 --> 00:15:52.889]  Eugenics is being announced.
[00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.131]  I think it could be partly that because of the ones who are following this whole program.
[00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:58.612]  But you've got to remember that most of the populations
[00:16:23.804 --> 00:16:28.008]  Um, uh, are not following the program and they've never really been awake.
[00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:31.651]  Uh, they follow mainstream and lots of entertainment.
[00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:42.361]  Uh, I think they're pushing now because it's time to push for this whole amalgamation into the, they call it the Great Transformation, that's the official title of it, at this stage of it.
[00:16:42.361 --> 00:16:46.085]  And, uh, the transformation of the whole planet into the system.
[00:16:47.406 --> 00:17:01.435]  The Quigley touched on, he talked about the economic side of it, mainly the economic side, as it amalgamates the continents and the central banks into one system under the Bank of International Settlements.
[00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:04.737]  He talked about this in the 60s.
[00:17:04.737 --> 00:17:07.598]  So we're on course with all of this.
[00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:10.360]  And I think the public are so dumbed down today, to be honest with you.
[00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.717]  It's time now to push for the next part.
[00:17:13.717 --> 00:17:23.842]  All the public really know from watching mainstream is that all economies are in bad shape pretty well except for China and that we've got to do something about it.
[00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:35.166]  So they're preparing the public's minds for a new type of economic system which is to be introduced in different countries, probably a starter in Europe and then eventually into America.
[00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:38.628]  It's a new economic system based on resources,
[00:17:39.665 --> 00:17:39.845]  I'm
[00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:08.240]  Your region or your local area for communitarianism and what it started off in Britain is going parallel there and it's being introduced to into the States.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:18.006]  In fact, I've just stopped the steam organization that started in Britain has just launched their big movements in the US as well.
[00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:21.968]  So it's it's it's a whole new way of living.
[00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:24.029]  They call it scientific economy.
[00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:25.052]  I think?
[00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:44.226]  Well, they also admit, as you know, that it's designed to shut things off.
[00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:46.327]  That you will live at a lower standard.
[00:18:46.327 --> 00:18:51.209]  The government, publicly, to kind of the unwashed masses, as they see them, say, we're trying to make your life better.
[00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:58.392]  But in all the public manuals and even public statements, it's like, we're going to shut everything off from these people and start euthanizing.
[00:18:58.392 --> 00:18:59.632]  And don't you like that, slaves?
[00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:01.113]  And the slaves go, yeah, we're trendy.
[00:19:01.113 --> 00:19:02.453]  Kill us.
[00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:03.013]  We're trendy.
[00:19:03.013 --> 00:19:04.074]  Yeah, we like it.
[00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:25.257]  All the old values that kept society strong, that kept communities, real communities, natural communities strong, and that also gave you your values between each other, have been destroyed, demolished since the 1960s.
[00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:28.089]  No, they don't want us.
[00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:28.930]  We're going to break out.
[00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.691]  I want you to continue along that line.
[00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:32.132]  They admit it in all these handbooks.
[00:19:32.132 --> 00:19:32.972]  We've shown them on air.
[00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:36.614]  They teach it to the regular social workers at UT in the handbook.
[00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:37.655]  The family's a disease.
[00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:38.915]  It's got to be removed.
[00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:40.296]  But they really don't think it's a disease.
[00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:41.857]  It's a disease to the globalists.
[00:19:41.857 --> 00:19:45.039]  They don't want you having any sense of identity, any real roots.
[00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:48.781]  You've got to be like a blank slate they just download trendiness into.
[00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:52.222]  And then you just go, oh my god, I take a shot, I get brain damage!
[00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:53.463]  It's so much fun!
[00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:55.064]  Wow, I'm dying of cancer!
[00:19:55.064 --> 00:19:57.405]  People are dying all around me, it's trendy!
[00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.526]  Fluoride in the water, it's trendy!
[00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:01.867]  Government gang raping me, it's trendy!

[00:24:04.158 --> 00:24:05.839]  All right, let me bring this up for Ellen Watt.
[00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:09.202]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:24:09.202 --> 00:24:13.545]  We'll get it linked up at Infowars.com as well.
[00:24:13.545 --> 00:24:16.847]  But this is out of NBC, Los Angeles.
[00:24:16.847 --> 00:24:20.149]  Russian genius, live with 26 corpses.
[00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:24.653]  Some skeletal remains reportedly dressed up as a doll and a teddy bear.
[00:24:25.393 --> 00:24:27.394]  Well, I'm a better newsreader when I'm totally tired.
[00:24:27.394 --> 00:24:31.835]  I get so excited normally, I can't even read stuff when I'm not burnt out.
[00:24:31.835 --> 00:24:38.957]  A Russian man who speaks 13 languages and lectured at Museum Head, the corpses of 26 women in a small apartment,
[00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:55.254]  Anatoly Moskvin, 45, had dug up many of the mummified bodies from graves and some were dressed up and arranged around his three-room apartment in Western Russia.
[00:24:55.254 --> 00:25:02.257]  According to BNO News, the bodies were discovered after his parents came for an unexpected visit.
[00:25:02.257 --> 00:25:03.558]  I'm sorry, it's just so sick.
[00:25:03.558 --> 00:25:05.299]  I'm laughing because it's sick.
[00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:06.919]  Russian, imagine his parents walking in.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.722]  Oh, he's such a nice man.
[00:25:09.722 --> 00:25:11.164]  See, this is what government is like.
[00:25:11.164 --> 00:25:12.245]  It's far worse than this.
[00:25:12.245 --> 00:25:16.651]  And as the IQ goes up, this gets even more common.
[00:25:16.651 --> 00:25:20.936]  Russian media reportedly reported the bodies were females ages between 15 and 26 who died years ago.
[00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:33.762]  But it goes on, Life News said that he's a historian who sneaked into graveyards at night, dug up bodies and took them home in plastic bags.
[00:25:33.762 --> 00:25:38.044]  Back in his apartment, he dressed up the bodies as dolls wearing dresses and stockings.
[00:25:38.044 --> 00:25:39.384]  That's actually a phenomenon.
[00:25:39.384 --> 00:25:41.745]  I've seen cases of that in the U.S.
[00:25:41.745 --> 00:25:44.826]  People are in love with corpses now, skeletons actually.
[00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:58.171]  But you know, it's funny, Alan, this comes out, they're calling this guy sick, and I agree, it's completely insane, but the Royal Family, it just came out, has been, you know, recently, not just in Vlad the Impaler days, eating human body parts.
[00:25:58.171 --> 00:26:01.612]  They believe it's nutritious, which adds to all the lore.
[00:26:01.612 --> 00:26:13.116]  This is a short segment, long one's coming up, but from your research of the British Royal Bloodline, which German, it's really Transylvanian, and all of this, why are so many of these elitists into this stuff?
[00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:23.287]  It's an ancient myth or belief in regeneration, basically.
[00:26:23.287 --> 00:26:38.411]  Especially if you get, I mean, we know in ancient times and probably into the Middle Ages, they would actually collect the menstrual fluids of women and drink that, bleeding its restored youth to them.
[00:26:38.411 --> 00:26:41.372]  The same thing is still going on in some circles today to do with
[00:26:42.498 --> 00:26:43.620]  I don't know.
[00:26:56.974 --> 00:26:58.595]  Yeah, here's what the commenters are saying.
[00:26:58.595 --> 00:27:01.216]  They were actually Chicago registered voters.
[00:27:01.216 --> 00:27:07.339]  The next one said, everyone thinks this is funny and strange, but here in Chicago, these people, these dead people would all be called voters.
[00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:09.360]  The other one says he wanted his mummy.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.941]  The other says what some guys will do to get a date.
[00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:17.163]  How much lead time does one need to put away 26 corpses before mom and dad come to visit?
[00:27:17.163 --> 00:27:23.046]  I mean, again, but this is seen as sick, but when the Royals are into this stuff, it's seen as loving.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:48.756]  Yeah, and we know too that you understand that Kabbalah was very, very high in the Middle Ages and especially in France and England too, but in France they have found some of the paraphernalia they used in the royal courts during that time for the king and they found the skinned babies, you know, the skin of the babies.
[00:27:49.685 --> 00:27:50.086]  I don't know.
[00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:18.668]  And immortality, and this is part of the capitalistic rituals they went into right through to King Louis XVI.
[00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:28.212]  Why is Prince Charles now making such a big deal about he's a Transylvanian, he's got a house there, the Impaler's old house, and he loves it?
[00:28:28.212 --> 00:28:31.975]  Well, he's trying something, but I wouldn't go too far with it.
[00:28:31.975 --> 00:28:40.522]  But, I mean, Charlie is an unskilled too, and he's really pretty stupid, I mean, even at school.
[00:28:40.522 --> 00:28:44.145]  I talked to one of his headmasters once, and he said the same thing to me.
[00:28:45.005 --> 00:28:49.267]  And, um, but, uh, Charlie had no purpose for a long, long time.
[00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:57.451]  He said that he, as descended from David, he said he was an Olympian, from the old gods of the Olympics, and there's a secret society, too.
[00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:03.594]  And he was defender of faith, the faith that was his Christian faith, and he changed it to defender of all faiths.
[00:29:04.506 --> 00:29:07.168]  And I was trying to say that it's Transylvanian.
[00:29:07.168 --> 00:29:17.075]  What they're trying to make out is that their ancestors were Saxon people or Prussian people that once dominated Transylvania as well as one of their biggest states.
[00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.611]  In reality, it's Saxe-Coburg-Gotha are the three main houses they come from.
[00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:25.832]  They were Prussian-German estates, basically.
[00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:29.113]  They were all from the same family, interbred.
[00:29:29.113 --> 00:29:39.856]  And eventually, in the 1800s, in the early 1800s, in fact, 18th century, as you say, they brought in merchants, very rich merchants, and they married into them.
[00:29:39.856 --> 00:29:41.477]  They became the dominant strain.
[00:29:41.477 --> 00:29:41.897]  Stay there.
[00:29:41.897 --> 00:29:42.617]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:43.117]  Stay right there.
[00:29:43.117 --> 00:29:45.438]  I want to talk more about that with Alan Watt and a lot more.
[00:29:45.438 --> 00:29:45.838]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.838 --> 00:29:46.278]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.137 --> 00:29:54.058]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.058 --> 00:30:00.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.401]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:08.682]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:08.768]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.768 --> 00:31:11.329]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:16.710]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.750]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.811]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:28.316]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:28.316 --> 00:31:31.698]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.698 --> 00:31:37.482]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.482 --> 00:31:39.123]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:39.123 --> 00:31:40.424]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.424 --> 00:31:43.086]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:43.086 --> 00:31:47.309]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:47.309 --> 00:31:49.911]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:31:50.091 --> 00:31:51.912]  End of America 3.com.
[00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:53.052]  That's End of America.

[00:32:01.476 --> 00:32:03.176]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:08.499]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:10.019]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:18.803]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:19.543 --> 00:32:27.086]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:27.086 --> 00:32:35.089]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:40.311]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:33:36.638 --> 00:33:38.679]  We are back live!
[00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:43.062]  Alan Watt, CodenameTheMatrix.com is our guest.
[00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:49.085]  And we are bringing you the fourth annual Money Bomb to expand this independent media operation.
[00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:56.550]  The nightly news reports that then are put out to the four winds of the web after they first air at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.178]  We haven't quite updated that yet.
[00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:07.379]  And it'll really help us expand.
[00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:08.900]  So I want to thank all of you.

[00:34:30.925 --> 00:34:33.788]  I'm getting a little bit of weirdness on my mic here.
[00:34:33.788 --> 00:34:34.769]  I don't know what's going on with this.
[00:34:34.769 --> 00:34:36.691]  I'm getting a little bit of that flutter thing it does every once in a while.
[00:34:37.905 --> 00:34:38.366]  I don't know.
[00:34:57.967 --> 00:35:02.530]  Alan, the reason I keep going back to this is knowing the enemy, knowing the global elite, knowing what they're into.
[00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.852]  Obviously, I don't believe there's real vampires running around.
[00:35:05.852 --> 00:35:09.894]  People have archetypes for all of this where they can say it's vampires, it's reptoids.
[00:35:09.894 --> 00:35:12.415]  Because, you know, we're saying these aren't humans.
[00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:13.676]  They don't act like humans.
[00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:15.137]  Psychopaths don't act like humans.
[00:35:16.208 --> 00:35:18.411]  But really, they're just, I guess, genetically different.
[00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:19.752]  They don't have empathy.
[00:35:19.752 --> 00:35:22.915]  In fact, a lot of them enjoy hurting innocent people.
[00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:27.599]  But is that, from your research, that's why every culture has these legends of vampires and stuff.
[00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:32.144]  And because, well, in a lot of cultures, it wasn't even, I mean, they were doing human sacrifice.
[00:35:32.144 --> 00:35:33.585]  They were blood drinking.
[00:35:33.585 --> 00:35:36.128]  And you study the elites, they're obsessed with this.
[00:35:36.128 --> 00:35:39.811]  And that's why they do the things that they're doing.
[00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:40.212]  Alan Watt.
[00:35:41.414 --> 00:35:54.883]  Well, yeah, it's a very primitive thing, because way back into ancient times, even when some of the tribes did, and some still do in Africa, drink the blood of the cattle as they move, which is a more practical thing, you understand that.
[00:35:55.615 --> 00:36:02.278]  But of course when it comes into the psychopathic type, they want to stun those they want to subdue.
[00:36:02.278 --> 00:36:06.379]  They want to stun them by doing something which terrifies them.
[00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:12.001]  And it wouldn't surprise me if they did this in ancient times publicly at times as well.
[00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:16.083]  Drinking the blood of humans or a sacrifice or something like that.
[00:36:16.083 --> 00:36:21.045]  But then again, as I say, in the Middle Ages you had the magic parchment coming into it from the Eastern Europe.
[00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:28.547]  And blending with it, and that became very popular in the circles of royalty and up to the present time too.
[00:36:28.547 --> 00:36:29.767]  There's a lot of strange things they do.
[00:36:29.767 --> 00:36:32.828]  I mean, a psychopath has no inhibition.
[00:36:32.828 --> 00:36:34.289]  You've got to understand that.
[00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:43.791]  It doesn't matter what culture that they instill upon the people, but they always put a culture on the people and have their managers to manage that culture.
[00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:49.913]  Today it's all sociologists that do it for us, you know, and psychologists and neurologists and neuroscientists, they call them.
[00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:57.675]  So, they give us the present culture, they work with industry, they work with the media, they work with all entertainers today.
[00:36:57.675 --> 00:36:59.415]  And they have for a long, long time.
[00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:04.997]  So, the psychopath himself doesn't follow that culture except in public for PR shots.
[00:37:04.997 --> 00:37:07.457]  He'll seem fairly normal, read scripts.
[00:37:07.457 --> 00:37:11.078]  But in private life, they have no inhibitions whatsoever.
[00:37:11.078 --> 00:37:14.819]  The laws that apply to the general population never apply to them.
[00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:29.246]  They're above the laws and they can actually break a lot of laws and be untouched because you always find, if you go into the law books, royalty cannot be charged or fined for anything.
[00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.546]  They're above all law.
[00:37:30.546 --> 00:37:34.228]  They can only be tried by a peer group, which is other members of royalty.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.603]  And that's why you get cried by a jury of your peers.
[00:37:38.603 --> 00:37:41.466]  Commoners are not the peers of royalty, you see.
[00:37:41.466 --> 00:37:44.068]  So they've got a completely different way of doing things.
[00:37:44.068 --> 00:37:46.871]  But there's nothing new in this whatsoever.
[00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:49.774]  There's a famous club in London.
[00:37:51.379 --> 00:37:53.940]  That's still on the go, I think.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:00.385]  Lord Mountbatten used to take little boys, underage boys, into this club.
[00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:04.788]  It was a lot of money to get in at the door, unless you were a member, so it kept the public out of it.
[00:38:04.788 --> 00:38:08.330]  Many reporters, actually, from Fleet Street got in there.
[00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.953]  And they'd often see Mountbatten sitting with a little boy and getting him piss drunk.
[00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:19.636]  And going up to one of the rooms with him, no one ever reported on that, except one later on years ago.
[00:38:19.636 --> 00:38:26.761]  Actually, he did by word of mouth, but he couldn't report it and flee straight, or he'd have been fined and charged.
[00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:31.124]  The newspapers would be closed down, actually, if he actually published something like that.
[00:38:31.124 --> 00:38:32.685]  So there are both all the things.
[00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:37.809]  Now, a psychopath, too, really enjoys all sensations.
[00:38:38.703 --> 00:38:40.825]  They flourish on sensations.
[00:38:40.825 --> 00:38:44.348]  Whatever drug turns them on gives them a bitter high.
[00:38:44.348 --> 00:38:51.475]  Whatever, the more weird, weirdest, kinkiest sex they can possibly get gives them a bitter high.
[00:38:51.475 --> 00:38:56.660]  That's what they live for is the highs in life and they jet all over the place to have their little orgies and things like that.
[00:38:57.574 --> 00:39:03.256]  But of course, that's just the nature of the psychopath.
[00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:09.377]  Lower level psychopaths have to put a better show on to the public, pretend they're one of you.
[00:39:09.377 --> 00:39:15.539]  But at the top royalty, apart from the PR shots, they live a completely different lifestyle than you can ever imagine.
[00:39:17.735 --> 00:39:40.149]  And really, that's what modern civilization has become, is a psychopath playground, and they've created the artificial culture, the culture creators, and more and more are trying to convert a large servant class over to not just do this ritually here and there, but they want to go into mass-scale war, mass-scale death.
[00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:41.550]  You or I would look at the video
[00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:51.314]  The three-year-old girl with her lower mandible blown off, tongue hanging out in absolute panic, and that rips our heart out, rips our guts out.
[00:39:51.314 --> 00:39:53.775]  But the globalists, for them, that's beautiful.
[00:39:53.775 --> 00:39:55.076]  That's a sensation.
[00:39:55.076 --> 00:39:57.657]  That is just grand.
[00:39:57.657 --> 00:40:01.079]  And that's why they make the joke, this is peace, ha ha ha.
[00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:05.541]  Well, they've done many, many studies with a psychopath and have wired them up to
[00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:07.162]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:23.265 --> 00:40:24.707]  Don't have a horror.
[00:40:24.707 --> 00:40:26.350]  They don't have recoil with horror.
[00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.594]  It's gruesome pictures.
[00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:32.701]  There's a neutral image in the brain.
[00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:34.884]  Sexual things like that.
[00:40:34.884 --> 00:40:36.267]  Even torture might turn them on.
[00:40:38.598 --> 00:40:56.010]  I mean I believe it's healthy and normal to recoil from all that, but then there's a place in good people where I wouldn't enjoy it, but I do have a compulsion
[00:40:57.225 --> 00:41:01.831]  A compulsion in my mind that these people need to be routed out.
[00:41:01.831 --> 00:41:09.180]  I'm somebody who wouldn't hurt a flea, but when I see the globalists, I have an overwhelming drive.
[00:41:10.356 --> 00:41:11.777]  to see him hang high.
[00:41:11.777 --> 00:41:14.939]  I mean, and of course that's a natural instinct.
[00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:18.722]  They're trying to get that out of the general public, so we'll just sit here and take it.
[00:41:18.722 --> 00:41:32.152]  As a father, as a human, as a warrior, as a guardian, nothing special, just a man, I have absolute, total energy, even though I'm exhausted right now just thinking about these people, to want to defeat them.
[00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:34.574]  And I would imagine you have that same view as well.
[00:41:35.154 --> 00:41:40.997]  Oh yeah, I mean, you understand, we have our figureheads that still have power, like Prince Charles.
[00:41:40.997 --> 00:41:49.120]  There's articles recently where he can actually veto or just nullify any law that's going to affect him and his party.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.101]  In fact, let me stop you.
[00:41:50.101 --> 00:41:57.984]  Guys, pull up London Guardian headline, Prince Charles offered vetoes, I think it's 50 times, but they admit, oh he has a loophole where he runs everything.
[00:41:57.984 --> 00:42:01.926]  He is still, he's the ruler, and he runs, anything he wants is his.
[00:42:02.506 --> 00:42:06.009]  And I tell Canadians this, I go, you know, the Queen suspended your Parliament three times.
[00:42:06.009 --> 00:42:08.772]  And they go, no, you're a liar.
[00:42:08.772 --> 00:42:12.635]  So I show articles, and then they go, well, that's just ceremonial.
[00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:14.757]  But again, I mean, this is how it works.
[00:42:14.757 --> 00:42:15.858]  Go ahead.
[00:42:15.858 --> 00:42:20.703]  Well, there's no law can be passed in any of the British Commonwealth countries.
[00:42:20.703 --> 00:42:28.350]  Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain, even India still follows a lot of those rules because they're part of the British Commonwealth.
[00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:35.559]  And so, no law can be passed in those countries without the final permission of the Queen.
[00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:41.281]  She must stamp it, basically, to pass it or nullify it.
[00:42:41.281 --> 00:42:48.384]  So, they're still very powerful, but they also have, again, their pals, their cousins, too, because they're interrelated with the big bankers.
[00:42:48.384 --> 00:42:50.865]  They're intermarried with them.
[00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:54.086]  Interrelated bankers who lend donations.
[00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:57.099]  And so they're in trouble with those guys too.
[00:42:57.099 --> 00:43:03.209]  They're also inbred psychopaths that have been at this for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:43:03.209 --> 00:43:07.596]  And so we have... See, everything runs from the top down by money.
[00:43:08.924 --> 00:43:09.184]  I don't
[00:43:31.557 --> 00:43:32.939]  And this is how it really works.
[00:43:32.939 --> 00:43:39.325]  That's why Rothschild said, give me control of your money system and I care not who rules the country.
[00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:45.470]  Because he knew from previous experience that whoever rules the money rules the whole country anyway.
[00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.411]  And the Prime Minister.
[00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:54.479]  The Prime Minister must go to the banker for a cap in hand every year for his cash, you know.
[00:43:55.234 --> 00:43:59.617]  So, money rules, and as I say, they're interbred psychopaths too.
[00:43:59.617 --> 00:44:05.401]  And you find the Rothschilds are intermarried with the royal families of Britain and Europe as well.
[00:44:05.401 --> 00:44:08.103]  So, we're run by psychopaths on all levels.
[00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:11.105]  Some of the other ones too, by the way, it's interesting, go into the military.
[00:44:11.105 --> 00:44:19.730]  They just shoot up through the ranks naturally, probably highly attended in fact, but they end up being in charge at the top levels of military.
[00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.653]  So, there you have your royal powers for ultimate laws.
[00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:30.054]  You have your financial industry boys there that govern the whole finance of the whole country.
[00:44:30.054 --> 00:44:35.797]  They use the people like peasants for taxation to fund their wars and their loans and all the rest of it.
[00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:43.040]  And then you have guys at the top of the military who decide to take you off to war.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.201]  So they have the little plans that really are secret plans from the public.
[00:44:47.201 --> 00:44:49.962]  The public's never to know the real reasons for anything and they never do.
[00:44:49.962 --> 00:44:51.603]  They're never told the real reasons for any war.
[00:44:52.783 --> 00:44:56.605]  Uh, are there real reasons for anything happening within their country?
[00:44:56.605 --> 00:44:58.586]  So, it's psychopaths, really.
[00:44:58.586 --> 00:45:06.230]  I've said this, all people who are going to be in charge are getting power over any citizen that should be tested for psychopathy.
[00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.191]  You've got to start with that, number one.
[00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:09.632]  That rule right off the bat.
[00:45:10.453 --> 00:45:18.599]  And that goes for your money system and every other system there is, because psychopaths, once they get in, they can cause so much damage so quickly.
[00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:21.461]  And by the way, they recognize each other.
[00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:24.022]  They find each other very quickly.
[00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:35.110]  They instantly recognize another psychopath, and they form little societies that end up ruling big chunks of the world, like it comes from foreign relations.
[00:45:36.857 --> 00:45:39.820]  They are a cancer and they must be routed out.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:48.209]  They are the vampires, not physical vampires, but spiritually and they have to be routed or they will continue to feed on us.
[00:45:48.209 --> 00:45:49.710]  Look at this headline out of CBS News.
[00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.553]  Denver collects fines on drivers who stop at red lights.
[00:45:53.895 --> 00:46:04.201]  And if their bumper just goes one inch over the white line again just but then the system can commit any crimes they want.
[00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:06.802]  Alan Watt is our guest right now.
[00:46:06.802 --> 00:46:13.125]  Jesse Ventura called me last night about the whole TSA thing and said he would try to call us after the press conference.
[00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:14.786]  We'll see what happens with that.
[00:46:14.786 --> 00:46:16.067]  That's scheduled to happen around noon.
[00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:20.709]  Well, I was pretty certain of how geopolitics was going to run this one, and it has turned out this way.
[00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:55.098]  I knew that Israel would... You see, Israel put out... If you read the old newspapers from Israel, you'll find that for the new American century, they put out their list of countries they wanted to take down.
[00:46:55.098 --> 00:47:03.163]  They had Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, they had Libya, they had Iran, Egypt, etc.
[00:47:03.163 --> 00:47:04.945]  All on a list.
[00:47:04.945 --> 00:47:08.067]  And, of course, Obama is just following the same list.
[00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:10.909]  He was even congratulated by Rumsfeld for doing so.
[00:47:13.353 --> 00:47:15.095]  But Israel kept telling the U.S.
[00:47:15.095 --> 00:47:20.359]  and the Israeli papers, don't stop, don't stop at this country, keep going, keep going.
[00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.121]  They were really ticked off that the U.S.
[00:47:22.121 --> 00:47:24.243]  wasn't going through them all one after another.
[00:47:24.243 --> 00:47:27.465]  They have these long pauses in between.
[00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:35.312]  So this time I thought, well, Israel will have to, for world, for appearances sake, and that's as far as for appearances sake,
[00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:46.799]  Israel will come up and stand up and say we're going to attack and then the media will come out and say that's putting pressure on the US who doesn't want a full-scale attack on Iran.
[00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:52.898]  And therefore, they'll step up their sanctions, they'll step up, they'll take over.
[00:47:52.898 --> 00:47:55.099]  And that's exactly how they're playing it out.
[00:47:55.099 --> 00:48:04.744]  They get Israel to come out first with a threatened strike on Iran, and the US will step in saying, we're the protector, we'll handle that.
[00:48:04.744 --> 00:48:12.488]  And then the US takes the blame, pays the cost of it, financially and in blood as well.
[00:48:12.488 --> 00:48:15.150]  And that's the whole region then cleared.
[00:48:15.774 --> 00:48:20.577]  There's only one dominant country to be allowed in that whole region.
[00:48:20.577 --> 00:48:24.939]  That was decided and talked about before they even set up the State of Israel.
[00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:31.863]  So you're simply watching a very old plan worked out on time, on cue, the way that they planned it.
[00:48:31.863 --> 00:48:34.584]  Yep, let's go ahead and talk to John in Wisconsin.
[00:48:34.584 --> 00:48:35.725]  John, you're on the air.
[00:48:35.725 --> 00:48:36.045]  Welcome.
[00:48:37.932 --> 00:48:40.452]  Hi, it's a real pleasure to speak to you guys.
[00:48:40.452 --> 00:48:48.634]  Obviously in Four Wars Prison Planet and Cutting Through the Matrix, they're daily visits for me and most of the audience out there, so I mean that's about as high a praise I can offer.
[00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:49.634]  Thank you.
[00:48:49.634 --> 00:48:53.135]  I kind of want to change the subject just a little bit.
[00:48:53.135 --> 00:49:04.317]  I saw this movie recently about Lyme disease and just how it's spreading all over the place and the fact that there's a real ignorance as far as, you know, how to treat the disease and
[00:49:05.172 --> 00:49:14.077]  It seems like the medical establishment, through their publishing and through all their indoctrination, have all these doctors under wraps, you know?
[00:49:14.077 --> 00:49:22.662]  I kind of wonder if they have this giant roving horde of infected deer and infected ticks that they're controlling through the DNR.
[00:49:22.662 --> 00:49:24.544]  I mean, how integrated is all this?
[00:49:24.544 --> 00:49:27.866]  Well, we know Lyme disease is pretty much on record.
[00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.568]  Deer swam from Plum Island over to New York.
[00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:32.949]  It's less than a mile.
[00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:34.070]  Deer do that.
[00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.271]  And it was a zoological weapons base.
[00:49:36.271 --> 00:49:39.053]  They brought Nazis over there after World War II.
[00:49:39.053 --> 00:49:39.714]  It's on record.
[00:49:39.714 --> 00:49:43.896]  And so Lyme disease is a souped-up, weaponized system.
[00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:48.740]  And yeah, it's all part of their degenerative disease weapon program.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.422]  And then they just shelve and then don't cover under insurance all the real treatments for things.
[00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:54.063]  Alan?
[00:49:54.063 --> 00:49:55.404]  It's actually older.
[00:49:55.404 --> 00:49:57.846]  It was invented in Canada during World War II.
[00:49:59.054 --> 00:50:05.581]  And there's a good book out there, it's called Deadly Allies, Canada's Secret War.
[00:50:05.581 --> 00:50:10.727]  Canada has led the field in bacterial and viral warfare during and since World War II.
[00:50:10.727 --> 00:50:17.694]  Yeah, I knew about that, but the word I got, but the main spread point they said was they particularly weaponized it even more at Plum Island.
[00:50:17.694 --> 00:50:20.938]  Yeah, they sent it down to Plum Island and the states to be worked on.
[00:50:21.707 --> 00:50:35.603]  And the vector that they chose was, of course, at the time it was ticks, they dropped it from plains at one point across the western part of Canada onto deer herds to see how it would spread and then spread amongst the populations.
[00:50:35.603 --> 00:50:39.287]  And then eventually, of course, they've actually weaponized it now.
[00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:42.831]  It's been in the papers in Canada that mosquitoes can carry it now as well.
[00:50:43.758 --> 00:50:47.861]  They're just going to dole out all this in a loving way to kill you and your family, your children.
[00:50:47.861 --> 00:50:51.523]  They love degenerative diseases.
[00:50:51.523 --> 00:50:53.524]  It's just another little loving goody-good.
[00:50:53.524 --> 00:50:55.626]  Do you want to add anything else, John?
[00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:58.851]  Do I add a little bit?
[00:50:58.851 --> 00:50:59.652]  All right, stay there.
[00:50:59.652 --> 00:51:00.934]  We're going to come back with the government legend.
[00:51:00.934 --> 00:51:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.706]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.706 --> 00:51:15.093]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:16.174]  It's true.
[00:51:16.174 --> 00:51:21.879]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:21.879 --> 00:51:25.462]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.462 --> 00:51:30.187]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:32.949]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.949 --> 00:51:36.272]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:37.393 --> 00:51:41.534]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:46.596]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:50.758]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:52:50.686 --> 00:52:52.187]  The war is here.
[00:52:52.187 --> 00:52:54.087]  It's an info war.
[00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:56.028]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:53:00.444 --> 00:53:05.648]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:21.275 --> 00:54:24.337]  But, you know, we're selling books for $5 a piece.
[00:54:24.337 --> 00:54:26.358]  That's what it basically cost us to have them.
[00:54:26.358 --> 00:54:26.978]  Well, not basically.
[00:54:26.978 --> 00:54:29.840]  It actually cost more than that.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.021]  Like, say, Mark Dice's book.
[00:54:32.363 --> 00:54:39.108]  Um, or when we're giving out, selling bumper stickers at cost, you know, it just doesn't, it doesn't fund things.
[00:54:39.108 --> 00:54:43.310]  Uh, and so pure capital expenditures, allowing us to continue and grow.
[00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.651]  It's, it's thanks to you.

[00:55:16.328 --> 00:55:26.913]  Okay finishing up John on the loving Lyme's disease, which you can go research is a bio weapon and It's just all part of the nastiness of the globalist
[00:55:28.117 --> 00:55:33.078]  Do either of you guys know if there's like a correlation between chronic wasting disease and Lyme disease?
[00:55:33.078 --> 00:55:35.698]  Is that sort of the same condition?
[00:55:35.698 --> 00:55:41.919]  Yeah, there's all sorts of little carrier weapons they can put into ticks and other systems.
[00:55:41.919 --> 00:55:46.080]  And now Bill Gates has said they're releasing the mosquitoes that are genetically engineered.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.001]  They'll put whatever they want in them and they're going to give it to you.
[00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:51.301]  And that's the way it is because he's smiling and dances around and we're all trained.
[00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:53.802]  If it's an authority figure, they can kill us.
[00:55:53.802 --> 00:55:54.682]  And that's just how it works.
[00:55:56.459 --> 00:56:02.467]  I want to control the hinterland so that, you know, any rebels that are gathering will just die of some kind of disease because they've been infected.
[00:56:02.467 --> 00:56:03.489]  It's even more than that.
[00:56:03.489 --> 00:56:04.891]  You're on the right track, though.
[00:56:05.796 --> 00:56:26.858]  He was a bit obscure here a few years ago, and where I am, at this whole northern area, and they tried to say that not just Lyme's disease, but also the various other diseases spread by mosquitoes was on the way, and that everybody terrified, people were wearing full jackets of the mesh, you know, the mosquito mesh.
[00:56:27.538 --> 00:56:32.366]  Hey, it's even in mainstream news, Alan, interrupt you, that West Nile came out of a government weapon program.
[00:56:32.366 --> 00:56:33.328]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:42.338 --> 00:56:46.420]  Yeah, yeah, and that kind of fizzled away, that one, and terrified people too.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:50.722]  But you start to get the impression it's just not safe to live in the country anymore.
[00:56:50.722 --> 00:57:00.547]  And of course, what they'll do, and what they have been doing, is say, well, we can actually spray and keep down the mosquitoes around cities, but we cannot, of course, spray outside of the cities, etc., etc.
[00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:04.628]  So everything now is to get everyone in, off of the rural areas.
[00:57:04.628 --> 00:57:07.510]  That's all part of the big agenda written in lots of different programs.
[00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:16.798]  And by the way, it's all on record that our government, other governments, sterilizing people, killing foster children, pesticides, half the native kids they get their hands on die in Canada, mainstream news.
[00:57:32.093 --> 00:57:37.098]  And biological, chemical, radiological, injecting people with syphilis, polio.
[00:57:37.098 --> 00:57:41.963]  I mean, the government's been caught thousands of times doing this, radiating little children.
[00:57:41.963 --> 00:57:43.384]  And people are like, but it's the government.
[00:57:43.384 --> 00:57:44.805]  Don't be anti-government.
[00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:46.467]  Love your psychopaths.
[00:57:46.467 --> 00:57:47.848]  Hand your guns in.
[00:57:47.848 --> 00:57:48.769]  They want to help you.
[00:57:48.769 --> 00:57:51.892]  The troops need to use DU, which kills them.
[00:57:51.892 --> 00:57:53.153]  But it takes 20 years.
[00:57:53.153 --> 00:57:53.994]  Be patriotic.
[00:57:53.994 --> 00:57:55.556]  Let the troops be killed by the government.
[00:57:57.541 --> 00:58:00.602]  And remember, too, that you're quite right.
[00:58:00.602 --> 00:58:04.743]  We're under... People keep asking me all the time, when is this all going to start?
[00:58:04.743 --> 00:58:06.824]  I say, well, it's already started.
[00:58:06.824 --> 00:58:10.905]  Since the 50s onwards, the cancer rates have just massively exploded.
[00:58:10.905 --> 00:58:14.106]  There's no panic about it, by the way.
[00:58:14.106 --> 00:58:17.287]  When there's no panic about it, that means it's under their control.
[00:58:17.287 --> 00:58:19.948]  They're behind it all, the big boys.
[00:58:19.948 --> 00:58:23.949]  They know what's causing it because they made sure they gave us all the products, the injections and so on.
[00:58:23.949 --> 00:58:24.849]  They do cause it.
[00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:28.717]  Stay there, I want to hear about more of their love!
[00:58:28.717 --> 00:58:30.698]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.242 --> 00:58:56.928]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:58:56.928 --> 00:59:03.355]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:59:03.355 --> 00:59:05.638]  Number one, study the past.
[00:59:05.638 --> 00:59:08.041]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:11.765]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:59:12.867 --> 00:59:15.969]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:19.812]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:59:19.812 --> 00:59:28.858]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:59:28.858 --> 00:59:32.281]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:35.903]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:41.689]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:59:41.689 --> 00:59:46.313]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:46.313 --> 00:59:53.900]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.282]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.282 --> 00:59:59.065]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.646 --> 01:00:10.468]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.468 --> 01:00:12.048]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:13.609]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:17.790]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:26.992]  Jesse Ventura says this is not the country I was born in.
[01:00:26.992 --> 01:00:29.495]  We're a fascist nation now.
[01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:33.319]  We're in a scientific kill grid now with basically Prozac in the water.
[01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:35.041]  That's what fluoride is.
[01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:38.120]  I guess the main ingredient.
[01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:07.575]  You know, there's got to be some way to get people out of their trance, because, I mean, I understand this is frightening information, but it's all verifiable.
[01:01:07.575 --> 01:01:19.542]  I mean, do people... It'd be funny, I mean, if I went over in somebody's yard, and they had a bunch of pebbles or gravel in their yard, you know, one of these xeriscape things, and I took a rock out of their yard, the neighbor would run out and bow up.
[01:01:23.408 --> 01:01:33.771]  And, you know, I get all crazy, but if the government murders them 20, 30 years young, or kills their kid with a cancer injection, it's like they don't want to hear it.
[01:01:33.771 --> 01:01:34.992]  It's like they don't even care.
[01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.232]  It's like, kill me!
[01:01:36.232 --> 01:01:45.195]  I mean, it's like almost fun to toady around and like the government and like the PSAs and all of it, and thank you for groping me, TSA.
[01:01:45.195 --> 01:01:48.576]  You know, just all of this, it's mind control.
[01:01:48.576 --> 01:01:49.276]  Is it not, Alan?
[01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:53.082]  It is mind control, but it's also propaganda.
[01:01:53.082 --> 01:02:04.488]  It's the effect of mass propaganda of the authoritative system versus those who have not been given authority by government or whatever.
[01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:06.309]  They want to believe in government.
[01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:10.471]  They want to believe that people could never be so awful and terrible and nasty to them.
[01:02:11.191 --> 01:02:13.774]  And the propaganda is perfect for every culture.
[01:02:13.774 --> 01:02:19.521]  They give you the guys at the top that say the traditional phrases that you're used to hearing, and those are your guys.
[01:02:19.521 --> 01:02:21.403]  They could never do things like that to you.
[01:02:21.403 --> 01:02:22.824]  They're caring, etc.
[01:02:22.824 --> 01:02:24.746]  They fall for all the PR.
[01:02:24.746 --> 01:02:26.288]  They fall for all the deportment.
[01:02:26.288 --> 01:02:30.533]  These guys are taught, and the scripts are written by professionals.
[01:02:31.173 --> 01:02:33.354]  Um, they fall for propaganda.
[01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:36.296]  This is a, this is a propaganda war we're in.
[01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:37.797]  It's an information war.
[01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:40.759]  And this is what they said would come before they gave us the internet.
[01:02:40.759 --> 01:02:44.001]  They said there will be a massive information war.
[01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:46.242]  And of course they didn't sit back and wait for it happening.
[01:02:46.242 --> 01:02:52.846]  They made sure they had the biggest, most professional, well-funded teams to make sure we'd always have information wars.
[01:02:53.686 --> 01:03:05.412]  Even on the other side, too, there's been fakes over the years who've come out on the Patriot side, and later we find out, like Bogright, that they're actually still working for the government.
[01:03:05.412 --> 01:03:08.894]  So, this is a real war.
[01:03:08.894 --> 01:03:10.134]  A real war for the mind.
[01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:12.515]  When the mind goes, the body's no choice but to follow it.
[01:03:14.736 --> 01:03:24.223]  So, there's a war for the mind, and until people literally become informed and then paranoid about their governments, nothing will happen.
[01:03:24.223 --> 01:03:26.965]  The majority will go along with it, unfortunately.
[01:03:26.965 --> 01:03:41.515]  And now you have the big propaganda push for conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories, and it was the main line that put that term out there, and now everyone's labeled a conspiracy theorist, like some kind of nuts, like the guy that collects corpses there instead of stamps.
[01:03:43.196 --> 01:03:44.337]  That's how they label you.
[01:03:44.337 --> 01:03:51.920]  So a phrase can literally knock you out of action because it's already embedded in the people's mind through propaganda.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.521]  Just like Nazi, it shuts them up right away.
[01:03:54.521 --> 01:03:55.861]  There's no response to it.
[01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:58.002]  There's no reasoning through logic.
[01:03:58.002 --> 01:03:59.263]  It happens.
[01:03:59.263 --> 01:03:59.923]  Amazing.
[01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:04.945]  Alan, thank you so much for spending time with us and I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:06.166]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com

[01:04:18.975 --> 01:04:22.799]  Uh, and, uh, Lauren and Patrick and Robert will at least get to those folks.

[01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:17.397]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:17.397 --> 01:05:21.081]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:06:50.816 --> 01:06:54.759]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:54.759 --> 01:06:56.420]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[01:07:34.786 --> 01:07:38.629]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:07:38.629 --> 01:07:39.870]  Others don't.
[01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.011]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:07:58.383 --> 01:07:59.264]  Others don't.
[01:08:09.028 --> 01:08:22.082]  From Nazareth they came with ragtag bands to bring a revolution.
[01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:28.229]  Some would make them king, others couldn't stand for that.
[01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.712]  The cross was a solution.
[01:08:36.027 --> 01:08:42.090]  Wise men follow him where he roams again.
[01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.791]  Wise men follow him.
[01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:55.795]  Thank God for the renegades and the lives they leave for the hell of their time.
[01:08:55.795 --> 01:09:01.698]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where
[01:09:04.056 --> 01:09:09.700]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:29.273]  They railed against the crown, Another red tag man, Declaring independence.
[01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:51.242]  Lay their bodies down On a bloody wall And liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades We're free today Thanks to the renegades
[01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:19.288]  Lord knows where we'd be when it comes to heroes, renegades of mine.
[01:10:19.288 --> 01:10:25.950]  Well, Jesse Ventura sued, had a great suit against the TSA, and the federal court just threw it out and said it was the wrong federal court.
[01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:29.431]  I mean, his lawyer checked all that.
[01:10:29.431 --> 01:10:31.452]  It's just a total punt.
[01:10:31.452 --> 01:10:33.112]  So it's not a complete defeat, though.
[01:10:33.112 --> 01:10:34.853]  I think you should refile it.
[01:10:36.303 --> 01:10:40.548]  In that court, and just continue it when, you know, first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[01:10:40.548 --> 01:10:41.969]  Jesse's giving a press conference right now.
[01:10:41.969 --> 01:10:44.392]  We've been able to find it, unable to find it in the media.
[01:10:44.392 --> 01:10:49.577]  He called me last night and said that he would try to call in after the press conference.
[01:10:49.577 --> 01:10:50.498]  That could be any time.
[01:10:50.498 --> 01:10:53.841]  Jim Mars, of course, best-selling author, researcher.
[01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:59.246]  The first person to teach a college-level course on JFK.
[01:10:59.246 --> 01:11:01.309]  Former Fort Worth Star-Telegram crime reporter.
[01:11:01.309 --> 01:11:02.951]  Good friend of mine.
[01:11:02.951 --> 01:11:03.451]  Great guy.
[01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:04.953]  He's been with us for the hour.
[01:11:04.953 --> 01:11:06.034]  But if Jesse calls in...
[01:11:07.321 --> 01:11:18.088]  Anytime in this hour or the next hour, you know, when Watson's on with me, we'll go, you know, we'll go into a holding pattern with the guests for about 10 minutes, give them a breather, and then bring Jesse on.
[01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:24.712]  And he's got the hotline number, and so that's going on, obviously.
[01:11:24.712 --> 01:11:27.233]  Man, last night he was calling me saying, you know, what do you think about this?
[01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:30.415]  And I had a guest on, Alfred Adask, and I saw it was Jesse Collins.
[01:11:30.415 --> 01:11:33.978]  I'm sitting there talking to him while Alfred's talking, and I'm like, uh, I'm like, well,
[01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:55.891]  Because you know then it was it had been thrown out then I saw the judges said it was the wrong venues that's not it's technically it's thrown out but it's not really thrown out so I don't know what Jesse's gonna do but it's a big deal this is the fight against this national Gestapo force now rolling out on the streets before we get into all these issues of Iran, Occupy Wall Street, the New World Order, all the things that Jim wants to get into.
[01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:57.052]  Jim what do you think of the
[01:11:57.372 --> 01:11:59.994]  I mean, we already knew this was going on 13 years ago.
[01:11:59.994 --> 01:12:05.079]  It's in my film, Police Day 2000, from 12 years ago, but I knew about it 13 years ago.
[01:12:05.079 --> 01:12:15.609]  I saw the federal grants, streetlights that have cameras and microphones hidden in them, power transformers that have them hidden in them, smart meters can actually, with an algorithm, tell what you're watching on TV.
[01:12:15.609 --> 01:12:17.050]  That was mainstream news yesterday.
[01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:19.753]  They're connecting to them 10,000 times a day.
[01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:22.715]  They're now putting switches in all the new appliances that
[01:12:23.436 --> 01:12:29.144]  That, uh, data over power actually couples with and then, and then tracks you in the house.
[01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.447]  I mean, this is beyond Orwell.
[01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.289]  Uh, TSA are now coming out on the streets.
[01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:36.213]  They've got PSAs running in hotels saying, spy on everybody.
[01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:40.860]  They're now running video PSAs where it shows TSA at football games and at hotels.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.062]  And just everyone being searched.
[01:12:43.062 --> 01:12:44.083]  Lied up everywhere.
[01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:45.184]  Total prison.
[01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:47.506]  I mean, this is even crazier than I thought it would be.
[01:12:47.506 --> 01:12:50.008]  And moving so quickly, Jim.
[01:12:50.008 --> 01:12:52.190]  Do you think the globalists are doing this because they're scared?
[01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:55.573]  I mean, because I've never seen them move the timetable so fast.
[01:12:56.834 --> 01:12:57.354]  Absolutely.
[01:12:57.354 --> 01:13:00.295]  I think the New World Order is coming apart at the seams.
[01:13:00.295 --> 01:13:18.039]  But before we continue with that, let me just say, if Jesse Ventura comes in, I'll be more than happy to jump off and listen to what he says because I, for one, am quite grateful to his suit against the TSA because it's about time somebody does something.
[01:13:18.039 --> 01:13:20.899]  We had a great opportunity in Texas.
[01:13:20.899 --> 01:13:24.580]  A lot of your listeners may not know this or may not remember this.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:40.569]  But the Texas House actually voted on a bill that would provide for a prison term and a hefty fine for any TSA officer that touched your genitals, okay?
[01:13:40.569 --> 01:13:50.355]  And 30 of the 31 senators were all set to sign it, and even that New World Order stooge, Rick Perry, had indicated he would sign the bill.
[01:13:50.355 --> 01:13:52.796]  And then the Justice Department came in and said,
[01:13:54.204 --> 01:13:59.729]  TSA can't guarantee flights in Texas, then we'll just cancel all flights in Texas.
[01:13:59.729 --> 01:14:03.932]  In other words, turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[01:14:03.932 --> 01:14:04.252]  Okay?
[01:14:04.252 --> 01:14:06.014]  And of course, thanks.
[01:14:06.778 --> 01:14:13.801]  Thanks to the Lieutenant Governor and the Governor, they immediately caved to their New World Order bosses.
[01:14:13.801 --> 01:14:16.222]  And so they withdrew the legislation.
[01:14:16.222 --> 01:14:17.863]  But what an opportunity!
[01:14:17.863 --> 01:14:25.986]  We should have said, yeah, go ahead and declare Texas a no-fly zone and we'll just stop tax revenues here and not send them to Washington.
[01:14:25.986 --> 01:14:27.967]  We'll cut off your money supply.
[01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:29.387]  How do you like that?
[01:14:29.387 --> 01:14:33.269]  But of course, they're a weak need and they're paid for.
[01:14:34.449 --> 01:14:49.914]  The solution, as you well know, Alex, would be to elect people at a local level, particularly the local county sheriff, who, by tradition and by law, is the highest law enforcement officer in the land.
[01:14:49.914 --> 01:14:53.475]  And there are a bunch of courageous sheriffs
[01:14:54.294 --> 01:15:00.767]  Uh, as you well know, taking part in trying to protect the freedom in this country.
[01:15:00.767 --> 01:15:03.654]  I know there was one up in, I want to say Montana.
[01:15:04.525 --> 01:15:05.246]  We're good.
[01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:25.969]  I'm in total agreement.
[01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:27.551]  I think they are scared to death.
[01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:30.133]  That's why they're tightening down.
[01:15:30.133 --> 01:15:40.683]  And it may be suicidal, Alex, because the more they tighten down, the more people wake up and the more people bow their back and say, no, wait a minute, stop that.
[01:15:40.683 --> 01:15:43.686]  And so it's an escalating type thing.
[01:15:50.495 --> 01:15:51.796]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:15:51.796 --> 01:15:53.957]  I mean, you say you think the New World Order is in trouble.
[01:15:53.957 --> 01:15:54.597]  I think they are.
[01:15:54.597 --> 01:15:55.718]  I don't think they're invincible.
[01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:59.560]  I mean, they've got all their plans laid, but I mean, people are waking up to them.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.521]  Why do you say the New World Order is in trouble?
[01:16:01.521 --> 01:16:06.223]  Well, because as you yourself said, it's all escalating.
[01:16:06.223 --> 01:16:10.146]  They're timing down harder, faster, more openly.
[01:16:10.146 --> 01:16:12.507]  I mean, they've been in stealth mode.
[01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:14.248]  We're good to go.
[01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:32.325]  First he says, oh, well, we'll have a referendum.
[01:16:32.325 --> 01:16:34.428]  And then he says, no, we won't have a referendum.
[01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:40.878]  And then I think they finally said, no, we're not going to do that because he's in the pocket of the international bankers.
[01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:45.685]  But, uh, and of course, the prime minister in England, he won't allow a referendum.
[01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:52.912]  So, wait a minute, people begin to wake up and say, well, wait a minute, if we're free people, why can't we vote on what we want to do?
[01:16:52.912 --> 01:16:59.819]  You know, for example, we see the same thing in this country with all the economic problems we've had and with all the
[01:17:00.453 --> 01:17:02.436]  Stuff that's going on with Wall Street.
[01:17:02.436 --> 01:17:13.910]  When has the public ever had a chance to vote on whether we wanted to have the TARP bailouts or whether we wanted to send $14 trillion over to prop up foreign banks?
[01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:15.552]  When do we get a chance to vote on this?
[01:17:15.552 --> 01:17:19.797]  It makes a mockery of the whole concept of democracy, doesn't it?
[01:17:21.753 --> 01:17:27.538]  It does and we even see MSNBC and Bloomberg and all these channels saying it's bad the Germans might not vote for this.
[01:17:27.538 --> 01:17:28.860]  We need to get rid of freedom.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.641]  We need to get rid of their right to vote.
[01:17:30.641 --> 01:17:31.622]  I mean it's just like open.
[01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:33.653]  It is.
[01:17:33.653 --> 01:17:50.182]  And, you know, when you start talking about the technical details and financial details of derivatives and things like that, most people, their eyes glaze over because we're just, you know, it's all we can do to just pay our light bills.
[01:17:50.182 --> 01:17:56.205]  But when you start talking about do you get a chance to vote or not, that's pretty understandable, isn't it?
[01:17:58.188 --> 01:18:02.553]  Well, it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:04.635]  Let's start getting a little bit into Occupy Wall Street.
[01:18:04.635 --> 01:18:08.399]  I mean, it's coming out now that they basically called out a crowd.
[01:18:08.399 --> 01:18:10.080]  Well, many people showed up.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.822]  The Soros folks tried to co-opt it.
[01:18:11.822 --> 01:18:14.205]  Now they admit Acorn's there, but it didn't work very well in my view.
[01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:17.630]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:31.756]  But the thing in New York is interesting, too, because that park that they're in has recently just gotten a big, the company that owns it has gotten a big grant from the Obama administration.
[01:18:31.756 --> 01:18:37.098]  And so, in other words, it's like, and of course Obama himself is more or less sympathized
[01:18:37.958 --> 01:18:40.900]  So we can see, wait a minute, what's happening here?
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:47.163]  Here are people protesting the establishment and the leader of the establishment says, we're all for you.
[01:18:47.163 --> 01:18:51.245]  Doesn't that, that should ring some bells with somebody.
[01:18:51.245 --> 01:19:04.652]  But again, this is a, this is a thing where you have to go back and understand who's really in charge and who's really in charge of these people who inhabit these secret societies like yourself.
[01:19:05.262 --> 01:19:19.297]  I went out to Bohemian Grove and you understand totally and I think most of your listeners understand what I'm talking about and you know this goes back and of course you know one of their key mottos is order out of chaos.
[01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:25.443]  Well to promote order out of chaos first you have to create chaos and that's what they're doing right now.
[01:19:27.216 --> 01:19:33.803]  Jim, I want to take phone calls at the bottom of the hour, but when we come back, there's so many subjects I could raise, but what else is on your radar screen?
[01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:34.844]  What are you working on right now?
[01:19:34.844 --> 01:19:36.345]  We're going to get a break.
[01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:37.867]  Tell us about that.
[01:19:37.867 --> 01:19:42.271]  On the other side, I'm not seeing bumper music from Genesis, but we'll...
[01:19:43.072 --> 01:19:44.093]  Cut off.
[01:19:44.093 --> 01:19:46.654]  We'll stop if we get the music.
[01:19:46.654 --> 01:19:48.735]  Here we go.
[01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:52.397]  We're going to be right back.
[01:19:52.397 --> 01:19:52.898]  Stay with us.
[01:19:52.898 --> 01:19:54.018]  Jim Mars is our guest.
[01:19:54.018 --> 01:19:56.700]  We're into hour number 26 of Global Transmission.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.041]  You can watch the free video streams and spread that out.
[01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:01.783]  That link to everybody to help spread the truth at Infowars.com.
[01:20:02.663 --> 01:20:03.044]  November 4th, 2011.
[01:20:03.044 --> 01:20:03.985]  Gold opened this morning at $1758.40.
[01:20:03.985 --> 01:20:07.108]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1801.73, $900.86 for a half ounce, or $450.43 for a quarter ounce.
[01:20:07.108 --> 01:20:07.608]  That's $1801.73, $900.86, or $450.43.
[01:20:20.902 --> 01:20:21.923]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:20:21.923 --> 01:20:23.143]  Hi, I'm Ted Anderson.
[01:20:23.143 --> 01:20:23.764]  And I get it.
[01:20:23.764 --> 01:20:27.146]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed the government is doing a great job.
[01:20:27.146 --> 01:20:30.047]  The Fed will stop handing out trillions like bailout candy.
[01:20:30.047 --> 01:20:31.648]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:20:31.648 --> 01:20:34.630]  If all looks rosy, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:38.612]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify.
[01:20:38.612 --> 01:20:40.313]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:20:40.313 --> 01:20:42.694]  dollar index has tanked, while gold has risen 1,600%.
[01:20:44.275 --> 01:20:46.916]  Savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:48.076]  Find out what they know.
[01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:51.758]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:20:51.758 --> 01:20:52.098]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:52.478]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.478 --> 01:20:52.878]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.878 --> 01:20:53.899]  What happened, man?
[01:20:53.899 --> 01:20:56.519]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[01:21:06.323 --> 01:21:09.768]  Now you fall asleep on the couch, irritable and out of shape.
[01:21:09.768 --> 01:21:11.130]  Don't be that guy!
[01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:20.804]  Call now for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.
[01:21:20.804 --> 01:21:22.547]  No injections, no appointments.
[01:21:22.907 --> 01:21:30.292]  With healthy testosterone levels, you can feel that energy again, that great outlook again, and yes, even a healthy sex drive.
[01:21:30.292 --> 01:21:33.294]  Right now, you can try Ageless Male risk-free.
[01:21:33.294 --> 01:21:35.035]  There's nothing to lose, guys.
[01:21:35.035 --> 01:21:42.520]  If you're a man who's noticed changes in your body, your mood, your sex life, call now for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.461]  Be the guy you used to be.
[01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:45.141]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:46.202]  Don't wait another day.
[01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.086]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:52.086 --> 01:21:56.428]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:56.428 --> 01:22:05.091]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:06.592]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:22:06.592 --> 01:22:15.016]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:22:15.476 --> 01:22:16.997]  Yes, my friends.
[01:22:16.997 --> 01:22:18.918]  Evil is rising.
[01:22:18.918 --> 01:22:19.818]  But take heart.
[01:22:19.818 --> 01:22:23.760]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.182]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:22:29.182 --> 01:22:32.644]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:22:33.004 --> 01:22:34.725]  The globalists are scared.
[01:22:34.725 --> 01:22:36.065]  They've overreached.
[01:22:36.065 --> 01:22:39.566]  The future of the InfoWar is in your hands.

[01:24:21.675 --> 01:24:23.136]  Yep.
[01:24:23.136 --> 01:24:24.317]  It's high noon.
[01:24:24.317 --> 01:24:26.438]  Jesse Ventura's up there in the middle of his press conference.
[01:24:26.438 --> 01:24:36.504]  It's high noon for all of us.
[01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.445]  Freedom is safety.
[01:24:42.051 --> 01:24:43.732]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:24:43.732 --> 01:24:45.673]  Our domestication is just ongoing.
[01:24:45.673 --> 01:24:47.774]  But, you know, I don't understand the globalists.
[01:24:47.774 --> 01:24:50.615]  They're expert psychological warfare experts.
[01:24:50.615 --> 01:24:52.155]  That's been proven.
[01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:57.378]  But at the same time, they study populations, but they're pushing and pushing.
[01:24:57.378 --> 01:25:04.781]  It's getting the sheep more into line, but for large segments of the public, it's just enraging people and really getting them moving.
[01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:06.662]  But I guess that happens throughout history.
[01:25:06.662 --> 01:25:11.164]  But getting back to, I was asking you before the break, what's big on your radar screen, Jim?
[01:25:12.757 --> 01:25:30.462]  This is November, after all, and I know that you and I have both had that long-standing interest in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, so I've been going back and digging up through some of the details, some of the things that can get lost in the whole thing.
[01:25:30.462 --> 01:25:38.725]  As you'll recall, one of the big arguments they made was they said that Lee Harvey Oswald, who was accused of being the assassin,
[01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:46.616]  And I say accused because he never got a fair trial, never got a fair hearing, never was convicted of anything.
[01:25:46.616 --> 01:26:03.199]  In fact, the Warren Commission heard secret testimony, cherry picking their evidence behind closed doors, refused to let anyone represent Oswald in a legal sense, and then came out and said, well, we think he did it and acted alone.
[01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:06.720]  Or as Gerald R. Ford always said,
[01:26:07.418 --> 01:26:12.219]  Over and over and over again, we could find no evidence of conspiracy.
[01:26:12.219 --> 01:26:17.340]  Well, no, they couldn't because they didn't allow anything that smacked of conspiracy in there.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:24.462]  But one of the key things they used quite effectively was that Oswald was accused of shooting a Dallas policeman, J.D.
[01:26:24.462 --> 01:26:31.183]  Tippett, out in South Oak Cliff at the intersection of 10th and Patton.
[01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:37.453]  And the argument went, well, if he hadn't shot the president, then why did he shoot the cop?
[01:26:37.453 --> 01:26:42.156]  And so he shot the cop, so therefore he must have shot the president.
[01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:49.980]  Well, I think I could prove to any reasonable, open-minded person that Oswald did not shoot the cop.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:54.243]  So now we can reverse the argument and say, well, he didn't shoot the cop.
[01:26:54.243 --> 01:26:56.344]  Maybe he didn't shoot the president.
[01:26:56.344 --> 01:27:00.346]  And the way I can prove he didn't shoot Officer Tivitt is pretty simple.
[01:27:02.757 --> 01:27:11.004]  In years past, and in my book, Crossfire, The Plot to Kill Kennedy, I pointed to three separate witnesses.
[01:27:11.004 --> 01:27:24.075]  An insurance salesman, a young boy who is now a Dallas Evangelist, or was a few years ago, named Jack Davis, and Butch Burroughs, the assistant manager of the Texas Theater.
[01:27:24.925 --> 01:27:32.040]  All of whom told me that they encountered Lee Harvey Oswald, who was arrested in the Texas theater about 1.30.
[01:27:33.554 --> 01:27:36.256]  Uh, no later than just a few minutes after 1.
[01:27:36.256 --> 01:27:43.501]  Officer Tibbett was shot about 1-10 or 1-15 blocks away at Tenth and Patton.
[01:27:43.501 --> 01:27:51.347]  So, in other words, there are three separate witnesses who placed Oswald in the theater at the time Officer Tibbett was shot.
[01:27:51.347 --> 01:27:54.429]  So, obviously, he can't be in two places at the same time.
[01:27:54.429 --> 01:27:57.211]  So, he was not at Tenth and Patton shooting the cop.
[01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:00.912]  Now, well, so why did they believe he did it?
[01:28:00.912 --> 01:28:03.413]  Well, there was another Dallas policeman named J.M.
[01:28:03.413 --> 01:28:18.379]  Poe, and Poe arrived at the scene of the Tippett shooting and was given some shell cases that witnesses had picked up off the ground that they said had been left behind by the killer of Officer Tippett.
[01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:25.922]  Officer Poe, being a good, trained police officer, scratched his initials, J.M.P., in the
[01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:28.238]  We're good to go.
[01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.101]  We're good to go.
[01:29:23.553 --> 01:29:33.638]  It has a little bit longer than the normal shell bullet, but it holds more powder, so it has more power.
[01:29:33.638 --> 01:29:46.865]  Finish up with that on the other side, but I mean, look, you're getting into important minutiae that proves this, but I mean, I've talked to the Undertaker guy where they came in and put the ink on Oswald's hand and put the gun in it, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:29:46.865 --> 01:29:49.847]  The whole thing, and now we have all these insiders going public.
[01:29:50.467 --> 01:29:53.475]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.475 --> 01:29:57.063]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.324 --> 01:30:06.584]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.584 --> 01:30:10.525]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.525 --> 01:30:12.766]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.766 --> 01:30:18.627]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:30:18.627 --> 01:30:24.849]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.289 --> 01:30:31.233]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.233 --> 01:30:35.456]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.456 --> 01:30:39.739]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.739 --> 01:30:45.683]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.683 --> 01:30:49.246]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.246 --> 01:30:51.207]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.207 --> 01:30:51.648]  It's here.

[01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:10.622]  Saving means to make money.

[01:31:27.653 --> 01:31:35.657]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:00.697 --> 01:32:02.298]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.298 --> 01:32:08.603]  This holiday season more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[01:32:08.603 --> 01:32:12.626]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[01:32:12.626 --> 01:32:16.209]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.
[01:32:16.209 --> 01:32:17.890]  A supply of delicious easy

[01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:19.468]  You are listening to the tip of the spear, the front lines in the info war.
[01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:21.689]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.689 --> 01:33:24.389]  Tim Mars, a true historian, is our guest.
[01:33:24.389 --> 01:33:27.310]  I want to go to your calls, folks that are holding.
[01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.512]  Again, I'm waiting for a call from Jesse Ventura.
[01:33:30.512 --> 01:33:32.452]  I want to hear what he said at the press conference.
[01:33:32.452 --> 01:33:36.974]  He said he wants to call in after the press conference, but who knows what's going to be going on.
[01:33:38.519 --> 01:33:42.360]  I don't know.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.101]  He's pretty wound up.
[01:33:43.101 --> 01:33:44.001]  You might talk for an hour.
[01:33:44.001 --> 01:33:45.221]  Who knows?
[01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:48.042]  But we're looking for that call to come in.
[01:33:48.042 --> 01:33:49.643]  Jim Mars again running shotgun with us.
[01:33:49.643 --> 01:33:50.543]  Paul Watson coming in.
[01:33:50.543 --> 01:33:53.404]  I got a bunch of geopolitical news I'll be also smattering in here.
[01:33:55.365 --> 01:33:59.027]  But before I go any further, why are we having the money bomb?
[01:33:59.027 --> 01:34:14.816]  Well, why did we build this studio and the TV studio and hire reporters and crew and IT people and everything else we're launching here and trying to finish the social network and really have a quality one and all the other projects we're trying to get done here.
[01:34:17.469 --> 01:34:19.410]  We're not funded by the Globalist.
[01:34:19.410 --> 01:34:21.530]  We're not funded by the New World Order.
[01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:33.614]  We're funded by you, buying the books, the videos.
[01:34:33.614 --> 01:34:36.194]  Now, continuing here, I...
[01:34:41.764 --> 01:34:56.188]  We've gone up to 300,000, which sounds like a lot, but when you're hiring crew and buying equipment, really the TV equipment we need, even the moderate grade stuff, is 150,000 or so.
[01:34:56.188 --> 01:35:01.850]  I've spent, there's got to be more than a million dollars of equipment in here right now.
[01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:03.931]  And then crew members and things like that.
[01:35:05.479 --> 01:35:17.385]  And I want to thank all of you that have donated, but I'm quite frankly very exhausted, so I can't really express the whole spectrum of reasons, but the globalists take your money at gunpoint.
[01:35:18.592 --> 01:35:20.734]  Because if you don't pay it, they're coming with guns.
[01:35:20.734 --> 01:35:24.597]  So it's at gunpoint, that's implied, and it's carried out.
[01:35:24.597 --> 01:35:29.240]  We're here just saying, buy the books, buy the videos, donate to the Money Bomb if you want to see us expand and you like what we're doing.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.041]  And folks have responded to that.
[01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:36.386]  We're also a platform for Ron Paul and all these other authors and researchers, and we try to support their work.
[01:35:36.386 --> 01:35:39.968]  That's why it's such an important juncture in the global awakening.
[01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:42.190]  And I'm not here to do this half-speed.
[01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:43.471]  I'm not here to play games.
[01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:46.153]  That doesn't mean I do a perfect job, far from it, but I'm going 110%.
[01:35:47.654 --> 01:35:56.402]  I'm doing the best job I can and, you know, asking God every day to help me be strong and focused and to be given discernment and to have courage.
[01:35:56.402 --> 01:36:00.206]  And I just appreciate all of you that have donated at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:36:00.206 --> 01:36:03.429]  You can also call if you want to call and talk to the crew and donate.
[01:36:03.429 --> 01:36:03.609]  It's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:03.609 --> 01:36:03.829]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:13.689 --> 01:36:18.332]  Or infowarsmoneybomb.com and uh... I think we've got the technical capability.
[01:36:18.332 --> 01:36:30.418]  I told them about it yesterday, but everybody's exhausted up here to restream the twenty seven hours in the video boxes that are already at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com when the broadcast ends in an hour and uh... twenty five minutes from now or so.
[01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:35.761]  But it's twelve thirty six central right now uh... and uh... restream that over the audio streams.
[01:36:35.761 --> 01:36:41.405]  We'll have to turn all the encoders off and do some stuff and actually on the restreams and stuff uh...
[01:36:42.455 --> 01:36:47.816]  I'm not even sure how to do that because some stations carry the fourth hour as we do that live a lot.
[01:36:47.816 --> 01:36:48.817]  How do we turn everything off?
[01:36:48.817 --> 01:36:52.397]  We're sending the video over the systems.
[01:36:52.397 --> 01:37:04.480]  Perhaps we'll re-air the first hour in the fourth hour and that gives them time to get the video stuff all ready and then relaunch that and all the video boxes and players that so many people are tuning into and watching right now.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.721]  I want to thank folks for going to InfoWars.com and
[01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:16.009]  Getting that article up there that's red-linked, titled, InfoWars Launches 24-Hour Plus Offensive Against Tyranny.
[01:37:16.009 --> 01:37:19.552]  You go to that, it's got the rundown of who's been on, who's coming up.
[01:37:19.552 --> 01:37:23.475]  It's got our video streams, it's got backup video streams.
[01:37:23.475 --> 01:37:28.659]  It's all there right now at InfoWars.com, and so it will continue.
[01:37:28.659 --> 01:37:33.163]  And we're going to preempt the nightly news tonight, just restream all of this, because there's so many incredible guests.
[01:37:33.163 --> 01:37:34.605]  A lot of it overnight, people missed.
[01:37:35.627 --> 01:37:38.190]  Again, I just want to thank my crew as well.
[01:37:38.190 --> 01:37:39.271]  Going back to Jim.
[01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:40.972]  Jim, finishing up with JFK.
[01:37:40.972 --> 01:37:42.533]  Look, you're the expert.
[01:37:42.533 --> 01:37:45.296]  I mean, you go into all the minutiae, all the facts, you're picking through it.
[01:37:45.296 --> 01:37:46.737]  It would take years to cover it all.
[01:37:46.737 --> 01:37:51.481]  Literally, it's ridiculous how much evidence there is that this fairy tale is a fairy tale.
[01:37:52.262 --> 01:37:57.604]  The official story, and over 90% of the American people in average polls don't buy the fairy tale.
[01:37:57.604 --> 01:38:03.366]  So we pretty much won on the facts and in the court of public opinion.
[01:38:03.366 --> 01:38:12.970]  But now you've had, as you know, the historian released the tapes with Jackie Kennedy saying that LBJ killed her husband.
[01:38:13.570 --> 01:38:16.351]  People say that's covering up, saying JFK.
[01:38:16.351 --> 01:38:17.732]  I mean, LBJ killed him.
[01:38:17.732 --> 01:38:19.453]  That's as high as she knew.
[01:38:19.453 --> 01:38:21.094]  Obviously, there's folks above that.
[01:38:21.094 --> 01:38:24.035]  People are like, that's disinfo to say LBJ killed Kennedy.
[01:38:24.035 --> 01:38:25.776]  You know, it was the New World Order.
[01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:26.957]  Yes, I understand that.
[01:38:26.957 --> 01:38:33.860]  I'm saying that's as high as E. Howard Hunt, who did the deathbed confession on video, audio, and text said.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:38.162]  And you've got Barr McClellan, the lawyer of LBJ, writing a book a few years ago and saying that.
[01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:40.804]  You've got all these people.
[01:38:40.804 --> 01:38:47.309]  I mean, Jackie Kennedy, the black ops CIA hitman, E. Howard Hunt, the lawyer for him.
[01:38:47.309 --> 01:38:50.432]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[01:38:50.432 --> 01:38:59.599]  So the whole fact that the system has invested so much time and energy in selling this fable, it really hurts them that people don't buy it.
[01:38:59.599 --> 01:39:01.420]  And of course, people question other things.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:02.121]  We have a government
[01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:11.247]  That's been caught injecting people with syphilis and radiating foster children and just a few years ago testing pesticides on children in New York State until they died.
[01:39:11.247 --> 01:39:12.168]  That's New York Daily News.
[01:39:12.168 --> 01:39:14.609]  This is my film, Endgame, the articles.
[01:39:14.609 --> 01:39:19.292]  I mean, you'd be crazy to not then always, and the New World Order says there's too many of us.
[01:39:19.292 --> 01:39:20.133]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:39:20.133 --> 01:39:21.414]  They want to put stuff in the water.
[01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:22.535]  The White House science czar.
[01:39:23.115 --> 01:39:27.182]  And he's a protege of others that were... I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:39:27.182 --> 01:39:27.963]  It's craziness.
[01:39:27.963 --> 01:39:33.733]  And I know people have trouble coming face to face with something this bad to be able to deal with it.
[01:39:33.733 --> 01:39:35.055]  But the facts are still the facts.
[01:39:35.055 --> 01:39:35.455]  Jim Mars.
[01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:37.803]  That's exactly right.
[01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:51.107]  And well, what it boils down to is that they have control over the five multinational corporations that control the mass media, the electronic media, and therefore they control the masses.
[01:39:51.107 --> 01:39:55.768]  This is why you don't hear politicians refer to the republic anymore.
[01:39:55.768 --> 01:39:56.748]  We're not a republic.
[01:39:57.689 --> 01:40:00.231]  Uh, they simply refer to democracy.
[01:40:00.231 --> 01:40:08.158]  Democracy gotta go and attack people around the world, bomb their villages, kill their children, uh, to bring them democracy.
[01:40:08.158 --> 01:40:09.400]  Well, what is democracy?
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:12.803]  Democracy, by definition, is rule by the majority.
[01:40:13.363 --> 01:40:19.426]  Okay, which sounds great on paper, but the classic example is a lynch mob, and we don't want that.
[01:40:19.426 --> 01:40:27.249]  We want a democratic republic where we elect officials, and we have checks and balances, and we operate under the rule of law.
[01:40:27.249 --> 01:40:32.712]  And that's why we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, but it's been pretty much thrown out the window.
[01:40:35.592 --> 01:40:40.013]  Obama decides we're going to launch missiles and bomb Libya.
[01:40:40.013 --> 01:40:46.635]  He didn't even bother to go to Congress to get a resolution like George W. Bush did before he attacked Iraq.
[01:40:46.635 --> 01:40:49.795]  I mean, we're just in... Jim, I got to preempt you for 10 minutes.
[01:40:49.795 --> 01:40:53.476]  I appreciate your... Jesse Ventura has called in.
[01:40:53.476 --> 01:40:56.397]  He's, I guess, completed the press conference there in front of the federal...
[01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:57.518]  I don't
[01:41:17.611 --> 01:41:20.733]  Thanks Alex, always a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:41:20.733 --> 01:41:24.714]  Not so much a pleasure to talk to the other media, but always a pleasure talking to you.
[01:41:41.010 --> 01:41:43.972]  Well, sir, a lot of people appreciate your courage and what you've done.
[01:41:43.972 --> 01:41:50.017]  Please tell us what you said at the press conference and what the rat establishment media was behaving like.
[01:41:50.017 --> 01:42:06.228]  Well, they mainly just listened to what I had to say and I basically told them that I've now been stripped of my patriotism, that I have no more feelings for this government that runs this country today because, quite simply, they deny me my right in court.
[01:42:06.228 --> 01:42:06.889]  It seems that
[01:42:07.529 --> 01:42:10.550]  Going after veterans seems to be the trend right now.
[01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:18.892]  Every time veterans try to exercise their, uh, their rights, constitutional rights, we seem to be getting tramped down.
[01:42:18.892 --> 01:42:32.216]  I mean, the one serviceman that was beaten up, uh, exercising his right to protest, and now myself wanting to exercise my right to have a trial by jury, and the government won't allow it to happen.
[01:42:32.216 --> 01:42:32.956]  It's that simple.
[01:42:34.653 --> 01:42:48.627]  Now Governor, I mean obviously I was stunned even though I knew it was possible when you were kind enough to call me last night and keep me abreast of what happened and you said that they'd thrown it out and then I went and looked it up and it showed up in the media.
[01:42:48.627 --> 01:42:56.554]  But the way this judge did it, correct me if I'm wrong because you've got the actual ruling not just what the news is saying, said well this was the wrong venue.
[01:42:59.938 --> 01:43:03.540]  What they claim, Alex, is they have no jurisdiction.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:13.144]  Well, if the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction over a constitutional question, who the hell does?
[01:43:13.144 --> 01:43:23.548]  Okay, because the way I read it was they were saying that it needed to be another circuit court, but you're saying, your lawyer's saying in the ruling, no, they're just saying that the feds don't have jurisdiction over the TSA.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.661]  Well, what they're saying is that I have to go to the Court of Appeals.
[01:43:27.661 --> 01:43:33.142]  In other words, I'm guilty, and I have to go to the Court of Appeals to be proved innocent.
[01:43:33.142 --> 01:43:35.403]  I can't have a jury trial.
[01:43:35.403 --> 01:43:47.106]  It has to be... They're stating it has to go to the Court of Appeals, which are three federally paid judges who will make the decision, and they say it's because of secrecy reasons.
[01:43:47.726 --> 01:43:58.057]  So clearly they won't allow an open trial to happen concerning the Fourth Amendment of illegal search and seizure of our Constitution.
[01:43:58.057 --> 01:44:01.901]  Governor Jesse Ventura, two days ago when you were on with us,
[01:44:02.942 --> 01:44:09.105]  You made the central point that it's martial law when you go to the airport, and now they're on the highways.
[01:44:09.105 --> 01:44:10.806]  And look at this ruling.
[01:44:10.806 --> 01:44:20.290]  They're saying national security, it's secret, we can't tell you, you're a governor, you're a Navy veteran, you know, honorably discharged, highly decorated, all of this, well known.
[01:44:20.290 --> 01:44:22.451]  You have to be groped by somebody.
[01:44:22.451 --> 01:44:30.455]  And when I was going through the TSA in Las Vegas, when I was out there with you a few weeks ago, when I was flying back to Austin, I said, how do I know you're not a terrorist?
[01:44:31.095 --> 01:44:34.216]  How do I know you're not guilty until proven innocent if I'm guilty?
[01:44:34.216 --> 01:44:35.777]  And the guy said, I can be trusted.
[01:44:35.777 --> 01:44:36.877]  The government's checked me out.
[01:44:36.877 --> 01:44:39.498]  I mean, it's this idea that we're all criminals.
[01:44:39.498 --> 01:44:40.339]  We're all prisoners.
[01:44:40.339 --> 01:44:47.181]  Can you elaborate on your statement of what this country's now become and your statement about martial law?
[01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:52.843]  Well, clearly, Alex, is that, you know, we're all guilty now until we prove we're innocent.
[01:44:52.843 --> 01:44:56.805]  And the problem is we can't even prove we're innocent in front of a jury.
[01:44:57.737 --> 01:45:02.860]  You know, I always thought we were guaranteed the right of a jury trial in this country.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:06.042]  A trial of your peers, of your citizens.
[01:45:06.042 --> 01:45:11.586]  Clearly the government doesn't want this going in front of citizens because obviously they'd lose.
[01:45:11.586 --> 01:45:15.028]  And if they lost it would open up Pandora's box.
[01:45:15.028 --> 01:45:26.776]  And the other thing they don't want, the other question they don't want out there is the question that why is it the government's job to provide security for the airlines when the airlines are a private sector business?
[01:45:29.025 --> 01:45:32.848]  Well what about, you're a governor, you know more about the 10th Amendment than I do.
[01:45:32.848 --> 01:45:45.237]  Since when do the feds, I mean I can send you the PSAs, they're now airing TV ads showing TSA at Buccaneers games and at shopping malls searching people and Governor, they're now rolling out on the streets.
[01:45:46.448 --> 01:45:47.589]  Absolutely they are.
[01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:52.872]  When you drive around the country now, our border agents are no longer at the border.
[01:45:52.872 --> 01:45:54.033]  They're out in the deserts.
[01:45:54.033 --> 01:45:56.394]  They're out on our interstate highways.
[01:45:56.394 --> 01:46:07.761]  I predict, Alex, that within the decade, you will have to show ID to travel state to state in this country because the Constitution is no more and the Bill of Rights are no more.
[01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:11.463]  That was proven to me today when I wasn't allowed to go to court on them.
[01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:18.575]  Governor, you know, you've always told me that you stay focused, you don't give up.
[01:46:18.575 --> 01:46:30.843]  I mean, I think the answer is, and obviously you'd run to win, but run for president to try to, you know, say, restore the Bill of Rights, restore the Constitution, legalize freedom, legalize America.
[01:46:30.843 --> 01:46:35.786]  I mean, you would get a lot of attention and could really put the heat on these people.
[01:46:35.786 --> 01:46:40.009]  And I understand, you know, there's a lot of other countries, but you love this nation.
[01:46:40.009 --> 01:46:41.810]  It's not America that went wrong.
[01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:42.951]  It's this corrupt system.
[01:46:43.631 --> 01:46:49.236]  I mean, obviously you're percolating right now, you're thinking, but what's racing through your mind?
[01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.377]  I mean, what's next?
[01:46:50.377 --> 01:46:57.844]  Well, I talked about it at the press conference today that I guess the only recourse I could have would be to win the presidency.
[01:46:57.844 --> 01:47:02.148]  And then could I get my day in court as the President?
[01:47:02.148 --> 01:47:04.129]  You know, that would be my next question.
[01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:08.133]  As President of the United States, could I go to court over my Fourth Amendment rights?
[01:47:09.193 --> 01:47:10.074]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:47:10.074 --> 01:47:23.346]  I mean, I can't run for president because I don't have ballot access in all 50 states and that would require a great deal of money, a great deal of time, and the system is set up so that you're not, you can't achieve that.
[01:47:23.346 --> 01:47:35.117]  That way the Democrats and Republicans, the two-party dictatorship, they hold the stranglehold on all our elections because an independent like me cannot get ballot access in all 50 states.
[01:47:35.717 --> 01:47:47.607]  Well, Governor, you've always been a winner, and you won as a trailblazer in Minnesota, out of nowhere as Governor, and the people are more angry and more awake than they've ever been.
[01:47:47.607 --> 01:47:52.251]  You've got one group of people that are more sheeple than ever, but a lot of folks are really waking up.
[01:47:52.251 --> 01:47:55.414]  Ron Paul is saying, hey, I might run as third party.
[01:47:56.134 --> 01:47:58.156]  The Libertarians are saying, come on over.
[01:47:58.156 --> 01:48:15.827]  If Paul doesn't take it, they're the ones that have ballot access, I think it's time for them to right now approach you and say, because you've got the name, you've got the knowledge, you've got the track record, and again, I understand the instinct, because I have it myself, to just get out of here.
[01:48:16.267 --> 01:48:28.484]  And I won't blame you if you do that, because, you know, you're a Navy guy, there's such a thing as abandoning ship, but you've been a captain, you've been a governor, and I think we need you to, you know, try to save the Republic.
[01:48:28.484 --> 01:48:31.268]  I mean, you've already done so much, I hate to say do more, more, more, but...
[01:48:32.253 --> 01:48:34.275]  Well, let me put it to you this way, Alex.
[01:48:34.275 --> 01:48:36.597]  The ball's in the Libertarian court now.
[01:48:36.597 --> 01:48:44.623]  They have to approach me, or they have to approach Congressman Paul, whoever they want to approach to be their presidential candidate.
[01:48:44.623 --> 01:48:46.105]  I'm not going to approach them.
[01:48:46.105 --> 01:48:48.527]  They will have to approach me.
[01:48:48.527 --> 01:48:54.912]  What is your mental... I mean, when you got the call from your lawyer and heard about the ruling, what was the first thing that went through your mind?
[01:48:54.912 --> 01:48:59.316]  And please give us any other points that you made at the press conference, sir.
[01:49:00.137 --> 01:49:03.738]  Well, what went through my mind, it was very disheartening.
[01:49:03.738 --> 01:49:07.200]  It was like having your guts pulled out of you.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:10.021]  They gutted me as far as my patriotism goes.
[01:49:10.021 --> 01:49:14.223]  I have no patriotism whatsoever to this government today.
[01:49:14.223 --> 01:49:18.484]  You know, as my t-shirts say, I love my country, not my government.
[01:49:18.484 --> 01:49:22.166]  And I think that speaks volumes to the way I feel right now, Alex.
[01:49:22.166 --> 01:49:25.747]  I have no love for the government of the United States of America today.
[01:49:25.747 --> 01:49:29.569]  How's Terry taking your wife?
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.001]  Ah, like always, she's a battler.
[01:49:33.001 --> 01:49:36.403]  She'll do... She stands by me no matter what I do.
[01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:43.587]  I couldn't ask for a better person that way and not... She'll grit her teeth and get through it, I hope.
[01:49:43.587 --> 01:49:48.810]  Well, we were hoping for sanity in government, but it's just, you know, we tried in Texas.
[01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:52.172]  It's not gonna happen, Alex, when a citizen can't go to court.
[01:49:53.061 --> 01:49:56.362]  To, to fight for the Bill of Rights.
[01:49:56.362 --> 01:50:04.504]  His rights, his basic Bill of Rights in this country, when they won't allow you to go to court over that, well that tells you.
[01:50:04.504 --> 01:50:12.927]  I will now refer to this country no longer as the United States of America, I will refer to it as the Fascist States of America.
[01:50:12.927 --> 01:50:15.408]  Because that's what I believe we are, Alex.
[01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:16.568]  We are Fascists now.
[01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:19.350]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:24.212]  In fact, there's a quote in the Associated Press where you said, uh, this is not the country I grew up in.
[01:50:24.212 --> 01:50:26.753]  America is now a fascist nation.
[01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:30.655]  Yeah, and I quoted Kevin Costner today at the press conference.
[01:50:30.655 --> 01:50:36.857]  I said, this is not the country I was born in, and it's certainly not going to be the country I die in.
[01:50:36.857 --> 01:50:41.799]  Well, look, the country's been hijacked, and yes, the people... We gotta take it back.
[01:50:43.902 --> 01:50:47.467]  Well, I know you're a busy man.
[01:50:47.467 --> 01:50:49.870]  As soon as you leave, I'll have 50 questions that pop in my head.
[01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:52.574]  This is all stunning.
[01:50:52.574 --> 01:50:58.943]  Unfortunately, Alex, I've got to take off, so we've got to end it now, but I'll try to get back to you if you'll have me on next week.
[01:50:58.943 --> 01:51:00.926]  We'll talk about it more in depth next week.
[01:51:01.386 --> 01:51:07.351]  Absolutely, and perhaps we need to talk later when you get home or next week off-air about strategy.
[01:51:07.351 --> 01:51:15.157]  I know Ty called me last night, he was getting on a plane to come be with you there and we were talking strategy and I was going to send him some information.
[01:51:15.157 --> 01:51:28.508]  I think one way to go after him, and then I'll let you go because I know you're busy, is the fact that statistically there are such criminals, only criminals or crazy people would want to be groping people all day and they're constantly caught stealing money, pedophiles,
[01:51:29.289 --> 01:51:33.136]  Uh, I think the health issue of the scanners is a way to go after him.
[01:51:33.136 --> 01:51:37.003]  Uh, but, uh, is there anywhere we can read the ruling?
[01:51:37.003 --> 01:51:40.269]  No, because the rulings are secret.
[01:51:40.269 --> 01:51:41.572]  My court case said that.
[01:51:42.657 --> 01:51:46.538]  You cannot know what's legal for the TSA to do or not.
[01:51:46.538 --> 01:51:53.341]  It's considered national security, so there's no way to know if you're being abused or not.
[01:51:53.341 --> 01:51:57.042]  I'll let you go in 60, because I know you've got to go, but this is big news.
[01:51:57.042 --> 01:51:58.343]  This is not in the news.
[01:51:58.343 --> 01:52:07.906]  I've scanned 50-something articles up there of a hundred and something that are on Google with Jesse Ventura's name in it today, and it doesn't ever say that.
[01:52:07.906 --> 01:52:10.867]  Your lawyer told you that he can't even see the ruling.
[01:52:11.227 --> 01:52:13.730]  I mean, give us the specific, because that's big news.
[01:52:13.730 --> 01:52:20.196]  This is like 1984, or Kofka, where you can't find, or the Soviet Union, you can't find out what you've been charged with.
[01:52:20.196 --> 01:52:21.217]  Exactly.
[01:52:21.217 --> 01:52:25.422]  You have no way, and even the judge said it in a ruling.
[01:52:26.033 --> 01:52:40.316]  That it's secret and we have no way of knowing whether the governor was abused or not because, again, you don't know the rules and they can change them anytime they want and there's no way to hold them accountable, the government, in any way, shape, or form.
[01:52:40.316 --> 01:52:54.819]  Well, Governor, that is martial law when the courts say it's secret when you try to bring up your rights and you've got to go to a star chamber at the appeals court and so you're not even going to seek going to the appeals because that's not a jury, that's a fraud, that's giving in to the sham.
[01:52:55.706 --> 01:52:56.826]  Well, I don't know yet.
[01:52:56.826 --> 01:52:59.728]  I haven't discussed my alternatives with my lawyer yet.
[01:52:59.728 --> 01:53:04.870]  We'll probably do that early next week of whether I want to try to take it to the Court of Appeals.
[01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:08.851]  But again, Alex, that's three paid judges by the U.S.
[01:53:08.851 --> 01:53:09.592]  government.
[01:53:09.592 --> 01:53:12.413]  You think for one second they're going to rule in my favor?
[01:53:14.013 --> 01:53:14.433]  No.
[01:53:14.433 --> 01:53:17.795]  Well, in closing, I appreciate you calling us first after the press conference.
[01:53:17.795 --> 01:53:24.599]  I'm very honored, and I want to tell you that Jim Mars, who of course wrote the book that was used in the film JFK, is on hold.
[01:53:24.599 --> 01:53:27.060]  He just said he wants to really thank you.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.501]  When he heard you were probably going to be coming on,
[01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:33.044]  Thank you Alex and give my best to Jim and tell him to stay on the trail of the assassins.
[01:53:33.044 --> 01:53:33.784]  Alright, bye bye.
[01:53:58.971 --> 01:53:59.712]  Well there you go.
[01:53:59.712 --> 01:54:03.317]  Me and Jesse have gotten to be good friends.
[01:54:03.317 --> 01:54:04.079]  He's real.
[01:54:04.079 --> 01:54:07.664]  People attack him.
[01:54:07.664 --> 01:54:09.687]  He cares about freedom.
[01:54:09.687 --> 01:54:13.212]  I've flown with him a few times.
[01:54:15.444 --> 01:54:17.045]  I mean, he really is a real guy.
[01:54:17.045 --> 01:54:18.887]  He's a quiet guy.
[01:54:18.887 --> 01:54:19.607]  He's a nice guy.
[01:54:19.607 --> 01:54:21.689]  You can tell he gets very upset.
[01:54:21.689 --> 01:54:26.432]  I mean, he started shouting in a controlled way when they were rubbing all over him and stuff.
[01:54:26.432 --> 01:54:27.973]  And they were laughing.
[01:54:27.973 --> 01:54:28.834]  It's Jesse Ventura.
[01:54:28.834 --> 01:54:31.656]  And the idiots asked him for autographs after they groped him.
[01:54:31.656 --> 01:54:32.136]  And he was like, no.
[01:54:33.517 --> 01:54:37.421]  And then I was like, hey, I shot video and photos of it.
[01:54:37.421 --> 01:54:38.662]  And he's like, let me see it.
[01:54:38.662 --> 01:54:39.884]  And he goes, well, it's embarrassing.
[01:54:39.884 --> 01:54:40.724]  Erase it.
[01:54:40.724 --> 01:54:42.366]  And later, it would have been good, actually, for court.
[01:54:42.366 --> 01:54:43.547]  But I said, OK.
[01:54:43.547 --> 01:54:47.291]  But I mean, he literally, he was in a good mood until he did that.
[01:54:47.291 --> 01:54:49.393]  And then our plane was delayed for like three hours.
[01:54:49.393 --> 01:54:51.776]  And he was just sitting there going, mmm.
[01:54:51.776 --> 01:54:55.739]  And he would go over to troops that were all flying out of Atlanta and say, do you like this?
[01:54:55.739 --> 01:54:56.640]  Do you know what's going on?
[01:54:57.501 --> 01:55:02.864]  I mean, by the time he got on the plane, I mean, he was just like, you know, controlled rage.
[01:55:02.864 --> 01:55:04.304]  I mean, it's like a joke.
[01:55:04.304 --> 01:55:07.566]  The media is all, Ventura claims he's been abused.
[01:55:07.566 --> 01:55:13.649]  Ventura claims he's, I mean, flying hundreds of times a year with him going up in his legs, you know.
[01:55:14.369 --> 01:55:18.492]  Again, I told the guy, I'm gonna probably sue you if you grope me, so he didn't do all that stuff.
[01:55:18.492 --> 01:55:20.393]  He did, he goes, well, I have to check the waistband.
[01:55:20.393 --> 01:55:22.674]  He just barely, it was still a violation.
[01:55:22.674 --> 01:55:24.315]  People say, well, man up.
[01:55:24.315 --> 01:55:30.019]  The pilots, most of them combat pilot veterans that came out last year, we're going back to Jim.
[01:55:30.019 --> 01:55:30.359]  They
[01:55:32.441 --> 01:55:35.662]  Would physically go, it was reported, and vomit.
[01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.303]  Or they were unable to fly.
[01:55:37.303 --> 01:55:42.305]  And then their union said, that's it, we're shutting air traffic down.
[01:55:42.305 --> 01:55:45.207]  And they said, okay, now you can go through your own line, and we'll stop groping you.
[01:55:45.207 --> 01:55:49.929]  And they quit for a few months in that new special line, but then now have started it again with some of the pilots.
[01:55:50.709 --> 01:56:01.215]  And people say, well why would some guy who's been a Vietnam combat pilot, one of them, you know, perfect flying record, whatever, why would you have to leave and then get home and vomit in your parking lot?
[01:56:01.215 --> 01:56:10.360]  Because you live your whole life as a man, as an upstanding good person, who's all about your personal space, your family, and walking around with people in uniforms, this is like being sent to prison!
[01:56:11.766 --> 01:56:13.007]  This is like being sent to prison.
[01:56:13.007 --> 01:56:18.330]  I'll tell you, I got in a fist fight one time with a guy who was a lot bigger than me, and boy, that's when there's trouble.
[01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:24.753]  That's when, you know, I go into that caveman mode, and some big 250-pound guy, and I'm 170 pounds then, starts really hurting me.
[01:56:24.753 --> 01:56:25.974]  You know, it's kind of blackout time.
[01:56:25.974 --> 01:56:26.874]  People get hurt.
[01:56:26.874 --> 01:56:39.141]  So a couple times I was sent to jail as a juvenile, but one time it was really bad at Terrell, and I had the pervert guard come get me and say he was going to go take a shower with me, and I told him.
[01:56:39.895 --> 01:56:41.396]  You know, I said, you're going to pay for this.
[01:56:41.396 --> 01:56:42.958]  And he, and I said, you will pay.
[01:56:42.958 --> 01:56:47.582]  And I said, and my dad, because I know my dad, he's a really sweet guy, but I knew him.
[01:56:47.582 --> 01:56:48.843]  I said, you're going to pay.
[01:56:48.843 --> 01:56:51.625]  There's still such a thing as Texas justice.
[01:56:51.625 --> 01:56:55.089]  I said, so, and I wasn't going to, I said, you're going to pay for this.
[01:56:56.149 --> 01:57:25.469]  He said you just get back in there then I was in solitary for like three days till they got in the court and got me out because I didn't start the fight that you know you know the big tough guy wrestling champion started it he got his brains basically bashed out because you start hurting me man that's you know I mean that's what the switch gets thrown and and and you know in this country you should be able to to to defend yourself and my point is the feeling of that guy pushing me into that shower and I was dressed he goes take your clothes off for touching me the feeling of that was wanted to throw up
[01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:28.349]  I mean, that must be what it's like for a woman when somebody rapes them.
[01:57:28.349 --> 01:57:29.790]  You know, they say, well, just enjoy it.
[01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:31.450]  Bull crap!
[01:57:31.450 --> 01:57:33.670]  Bull crap!
[01:57:33.670 --> 01:57:35.311]  Okay?
[01:57:35.311 --> 01:57:43.132]  I mean, listen, I, you know, growing up, dating girls, the first time you're out with some girl and you're in the movie theater and she puts her hand in your lap, it's kind of like electricity.
[01:57:43.132 --> 01:57:46.553]  And even though you like her, it's exciting, but it's kind of weird.
[01:57:46.553 --> 01:57:49.994]  You know, that's how it is for me with my wife.
[01:57:49.994 --> 01:57:51.254]  You know, it's that electric thing.
[01:57:52.094 --> 01:57:54.316]  That's my wife I've had children with.
[01:57:54.316 --> 01:57:57.540]  I don't want some man or woman touching me.
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:00.643]  Do you get it through your little pea brain, you bastards?
[01:58:00.643 --> 01:58:02.946]  I mean, I'm sick of your garbage, New World Order.
[01:58:02.946 --> 01:58:03.887]  I want you to know that.
[01:58:03.887 --> 01:58:05.608]  Alright, I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:58:05.608 --> 01:58:06.469]  Jim, we're going to break.
[01:58:06.469 --> 01:58:07.330]  I'll come back with you some.
[01:58:08.561 --> 01:58:10.581]  We're on a break, but what did you think of that Ventura interview?
[01:58:38.046 --> 01:58:41.733]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.733 --> 01:58:45.279]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.279 --> 01:58:47.423]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.138 --> 01:58:55.681]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.681 --> 01:58:56.601]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.601 --> 01:59:00.024]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.024 --> 01:59:00.884]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.884 --> 01:59:05.767]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.767 --> 01:59:06.528]  It's true.
[01:59:06.528 --> 01:59:11.391]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.391 --> 01:59:12.211]  Number 3.
[01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:15.814]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.814 --> 01:59:19.516]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.696 --> 01:59:20.497]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.497 --> 01:59:23.260]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.944]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.944 --> 01:59:27.744]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.744 --> 01:59:31.889]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.889 --> 01:59:36.654]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.934 --> 01:59:41.097]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.097 --> 01:59:42.878]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.878 --> 01:59:45.139]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:45.139 --> 01:59:47.481]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.481 --> 01:59:48.742]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.742 --> 01:59:49.963]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.021 --> 02:00:10.863]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.863 --> 02:00:12.444]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.444 --> 02:00:13.985]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.985 --> 02:00:18.187]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.187 --> 02:00:22.289]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.289 --> 02:00:31.312]  Paul Watson is coming up.
[02:00:31.312 --> 02:00:32.793]  I'll introduce him and bring him in.
[02:00:32.793 --> 02:00:35.337]  He's interviewed Bob Chapman.
[02:00:35.337 --> 02:00:39.302]  Closed out the 27th hour, so I'll do 26 hours here off and on.
[02:00:39.302 --> 02:00:43.607]  I want to appreciate Aaron coming in for a few hours and Paul Watson earlier in the morning.
[02:00:45.689 --> 02:00:54.696]  I'm not sure about the whole scheduling, but we're going to attempt to restrain the 27 hours again when the show is over today or somewhere thereafter, so we'll leave the video boxes up.
[02:00:54.696 --> 02:00:58.199]  If not, it's all going to be archived at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:58.199 --> 02:00:59.720]  Finishing up with Jim Mars.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:13.750]  Jim, I guess we let you go when Ventura was on so it wouldn't cross lines, but he said, I told him that you were saying that you appreciate him with his lawsuit and his attempt, and he said, stay on the trail of the assassins and thank you, Jim, since you missed that.
[02:01:14.651 --> 02:01:22.196]  Hey, why don't we all jump in and refile his suit as a class action suit?
[02:01:22.196 --> 02:01:23.416]  I'm ready to sign on to it.
[02:01:23.416 --> 02:01:25.197]  I'm really thinking about suing him anyways.
[02:01:25.197 --> 02:01:26.478]  I am too.
[02:01:26.478 --> 02:01:28.640]  Have you ever considered this, Alex?
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:32.382]  At the height of Hitler's Nazi Third Reich,
[02:01:33.177 --> 02:01:38.739]  The Gestapo, who admittedly, if they got you alone in the basement, would do almost anything.
[02:01:38.739 --> 02:01:49.182]  But, still and all, even the Nazis, at the height of their power, did not have the audacity to try to grope people in a public place.
[02:01:49.182 --> 02:01:53.603]  Because those Europeans in the 30s and 40s would not have put up with that.
[02:01:53.603 --> 02:01:55.364]  Why are we putting up with this?
[02:01:55.364 --> 02:01:56.424]  I don't understand it.
[02:01:59.736 --> 02:02:00.597]  I don't know either.
[02:02:00.597 --> 02:02:03.379]  It just absolutely makes my head spin.
[02:02:30.096 --> 02:02:33.558]  And you need to support Alex, you really do.
[02:02:33.558 --> 02:02:41.761]  And I appreciate everyone who has put their money up to do that and I congratulate you.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:59.226]  Well Jim, I want to congratulate the people that have donated to the Infowars Money Bomb and that continue throughout the weekend because it's having a huge effect and look what we've built.
[02:02:59.226 --> 02:03:00.266]  I've got to have you back down now.
[02:03:00.266 --> 02:03:03.188]  We've doubled the size of the studio.
[02:03:03.188 --> 02:03:08.431]  We've built the whole, the TV is now reaching overall about another million people a week.
[02:03:08.431 --> 02:03:12.753]  You've doubled that big warehouse area you had?
[02:03:12.753 --> 02:03:13.454]  Yep.
[02:03:13.454 --> 02:03:16.676]  You must be covering about most of South Austin by now.
[02:03:17.563 --> 02:03:19.925]  No, look, we found it the cheapest.
[02:03:19.925 --> 02:03:24.448]  It is out here by the airport, and it is an industrial area, and we had to put a lot of stuff in.
[02:03:24.448 --> 02:03:25.809]  That was why we got it so cheap.
[02:03:25.809 --> 02:03:30.353]  This is the cheapest, cheapest square foot in the city.
[02:03:30.353 --> 02:03:36.878]  Weldon Henson's the one that actually found this place four years ago, and then it took us about six, eight months to move in and everything, and then the rest is history.
[02:03:38.899 --> 02:03:43.501]  Let me tell you folks, any place in Austin is not cheap.
[02:03:43.501 --> 02:03:45.661]  Austin is not a cheap place to live.
[02:03:45.661 --> 02:03:51.063]  So, you know, Alex needs all the help he can get.
[02:03:51.063 --> 02:03:55.445]  Well, when it comes to the rent, it's a nut to crack compared to the bandwidth and stuff.
[02:03:55.445 --> 02:03:58.886]  The point is the economy is so bad they couldn't lease the thing next door, so I got that.
[02:04:00.031 --> 02:04:01.032]  I thought this was a good deal.
[02:04:01.032 --> 02:04:03.594]  I got that for like half of what I got this.
[02:04:03.594 --> 02:04:05.715]  And so it is big.
[02:04:05.715 --> 02:04:06.936]  We haven't even filled it all up.
[02:04:06.936 --> 02:04:07.857]  It's got room to grow.
[02:04:07.857 --> 02:04:10.479]  That's my plan, because I don't want to leave here.
[02:04:10.479 --> 02:04:11.900]  And we've put a lot of time and energy into it.
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:12.621]  We could have done all this.
[02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:13.562]  Folks, look what we've built.
[02:04:13.562 --> 02:04:14.262]  Go watch the videos.
[02:04:14.262 --> 02:04:15.423]  You see the shows.
[02:04:15.423 --> 02:04:17.765]  Our output against the globalists is a lot bigger.
[02:04:17.765 --> 02:04:24.550]  You can call toll-free and donate 888-253-3139 or infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:27.052]  And of course, there's jimmars.com, right?
[02:04:27.052 --> 02:04:28.253]  What's the best website to visit?
[02:04:28.253 --> 02:04:29.174]  And check out your stuff, Jim.
[02:04:29.454 --> 02:04:30.374]  That's it.
[02:04:30.374 --> 02:04:32.455]  Interestingly enough, Jim Mars dot com.
[02:04:32.455 --> 02:04:34.976]  In fact, I've got a whole new look.
[02:04:34.976 --> 02:04:42.020]  Just recently put up a whole new website with bells, whistles, and it's really looking up to date.
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:44.301]  Bells, whistles, and thingamajiggers.
[02:04:44.301 --> 02:04:45.441]  That's right.
[02:04:45.441 --> 02:04:47.522]  And whiz banger.
[02:04:47.522 --> 02:04:48.903]  Hey, God bless you, brother.
[02:04:48.903 --> 02:04:50.223]  Always good talking to you.
[02:04:50.223 --> 02:04:51.023]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:51.023 --> 02:04:51.884]  Good luck to you.
[02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:56.506]  And let's all press on because always remember my motto.
[02:04:56.506 --> 02:04:58.347]  None of us are as smart as all of us.
[02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:00.658]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.658 --> 02:05:01.279]  Bye.
[02:05:01.279 --> 02:05:09.382]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.382 --> 02:05:11.923]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.923 --> 02:05:17.306]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:17.306 --> 02:05:20.347]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.347 --> 02:05:22.408]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.668 --> 02:05:28.912]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.912 --> 02:05:32.294]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:32.294 --> 02:05:38.078]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:38.078 --> 02:05:39.719]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.719 --> 02:05:41.020]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:43.682]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.682 --> 02:05:47.924]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.924 --> 02:05:50.506]  You can find the video at www dot
[02:05:50.706 --> 02:05:52.530]  End of America 3.com.
[02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:55.116]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:05:55.116 --> 02:05:58.985]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:58.985 --> 02:06:00.008]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:02.864 --> 02:06:06.825]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.825 --> 02:06:15.687]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:15.687 --> 02:06:20.308]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:20.308 --> 02:06:31.130]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:41.279]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:41.279 --> 02:06:46.704]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:46.704 --> 02:06:54.210]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:54.210 --> 02:06:56.612]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:02.122 --> 02:07:06.146]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:06.146 --> 02:07:09.390]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:14.195]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:07:14.195 --> 02:07:20.582]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.582 --> 02:07:22.825]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:23.365 --> 02:07:23.665]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.665 --> 02:07:24.166]  Bernanke?
[02:07:24.166 --> 02:07:24.846]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.846 --> 02:07:26.127]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:26.127 --> 02:07:28.368]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:42.256 --> 02:07:44.378]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:44.378 --> 02:07:49.542]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:49.542 --> 02:08:02.433]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:02.433 --> 02:08:08.018]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.374 --> 02:08:16.577]  If you missed it, it is breaking news.
[02:08:16.577 --> 02:08:19.719]  Jesse Ventura was with us for about 15 minutes.
[02:08:19.719 --> 02:08:27.525]  In the last 15 minutes of the second hour after his press conference, went right over to his car and called in on the show.
[02:08:27.525 --> 02:08:33.130]  He said, this is no longer the United States of America, it's the United States of Fascism.
[02:08:35.222 --> 02:08:36.623]  Not the United States of America.
[02:08:36.623 --> 02:08:40.385]  Or the Fascist United States, that's what he called it.
[02:08:40.385 --> 02:08:40.985]  Just amazing.
[02:08:40.985 --> 02:08:48.350]  Paul Watson will obviously get an article out on that and send it up to the Supreme Internet Commander Matt Drudge, who knows.
[02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:51.492]  But regardless, it'll be at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:51.492 --> 02:08:53.173]  We are in a fight with the TSA.
[02:08:53.173 --> 02:08:54.453]  People are sick of it.
[02:08:54.453 --> 02:08:55.234]  They're tired of it.
[02:08:55.974 --> 02:09:03.306]  It is the 2011 money bomb and we've raised upwards of $300,000 in this depressionary economy.
[02:09:03.306 --> 02:09:04.047]  I think that's great.
[02:09:04.047 --> 02:09:08.955]  The best we've ever done is $435,000 and that took into the next week for that to come in.
[02:09:08.955 --> 02:09:10.417]  I would guess when all said and done,
[02:09:12.066 --> 02:09:12.306]  I don't
[02:09:34.770 --> 02:09:37.052]  Sleeping in the IT closet, leaning over a thing.
[02:09:37.052 --> 02:09:45.417]  We've got a couple couches you ought to be laying down in there, but I don't know what we're going to do at the end of the show with 27 hours trying to stream it up and all the stuff that's going on.
[02:09:45.417 --> 02:09:55.464]  We've got the special reports area that the server's full on, so we're having to put all the special reports into the regular news file at PrisonPlanet.tv where it's all in one spot.
[02:09:55.464 --> 02:09:55.964]  And oh my gosh, that
[02:09:58.766 --> 02:10:02.091]  That, uh, Skull and Bones, Charlotte Iserby thing that we premiered at 7 a.m.
[02:10:02.091 --> 02:10:04.435]  this morning, that's gonna be up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:04.435 --> 02:10:05.477]  That's another way to support us.
[02:10:05.477 --> 02:10:10.184]  Get a 15 cent a day, 5.95 a month, or get a year membership, get three months free.
[02:10:10.184 --> 02:10:13.429]  We got a 15-day free trial membership we've never done before.
[02:10:14.210 --> 02:10:20.035]  I intend to do the special we do in December, uh, also where you can get like five and a half months of a year membership free.
[02:10:20.035 --> 02:10:22.357]  You pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free.
[02:10:22.357 --> 02:10:25.359]  So, um, books, videos, when you buy all that stuff, it supports us.
[02:10:25.359 --> 02:10:27.241]  Plus you get tools to help spread the word.
[02:10:27.241 --> 02:10:28.622]  Now, I'm going to punch out.
[02:10:29.963 --> 02:10:36.371]  And Paul Watson is going to, we'd always planned this, to take the last bit of the transmission.
[02:10:36.371 --> 02:10:42.118]  So I've been, we've been going 26 hours and 10 minutes pretty much here.
[02:10:42.118 --> 02:10:48.645]  And Watson, who popped in and covered for us a little bit this morning, he is going to close it out.
[02:10:49.426 --> 02:10:53.668]  And job well done to everybody, but again on this Sunday we'll be back 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:10:53.668 --> 02:10:59.452]  and obviously next Monday, you heard Ventura, he said he'll be back here next week when they learn more.
[02:10:59.452 --> 02:11:11.038]  And it's just despicable that the ruling is secret, he can't even see it and his lawyer can't, but it's national security and he doesn't get to have a jury trial.
[02:11:11.038 --> 02:11:14.360]  I mean, you can't in America basically sue the TSA.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:16.441]  They're announcing immunity.
[02:11:16.441 --> 02:11:17.722]  The government is totally criminal.
[02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:19.951]  And they're telling you driving's a privilege.
[02:11:19.951 --> 02:11:21.692]  They're telling you owning guns are privileges.
[02:11:21.692 --> 02:11:25.294]  I've got the cases where they say driving is not a privilege.
[02:11:25.294 --> 02:11:27.375]  Commercial driving is.
[02:11:27.375 --> 02:11:28.956]  It's all a load of bull.
[02:11:28.956 --> 02:11:34.660]  It's just this government is now... No one 50 years ago would imagine they'd have cameras and microphones and streetlights.
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:35.420]  And now they just do it.
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:36.181]  They go, that's freedom!
[02:11:37.009 --> 02:11:38.550]  The police will tape you in public.
[02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:40.512]  We will arrest you if you tape us.
[02:11:40.512 --> 02:11:41.893]  But the law doesn't say that.
[02:11:41.893 --> 02:11:44.314]  We're still going to have a jury send you to prison.
[02:11:44.314 --> 02:11:46.016]  I mean, the government's got cancer.
[02:11:46.016 --> 02:11:47.557]  The government is crook-run.
[02:11:47.557 --> 02:11:48.978]  Does that mean every level is criminal?
[02:11:48.978 --> 02:11:51.039]  No, but at the top, they're a bunch of crooks.
[02:11:51.039 --> 02:11:53.161]  Amazing information.
[02:11:53.161 --> 02:11:59.305]  I want to just say hi to Bob, because it's always one of my high points of the week to get to talk to Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:12:00.726 --> 02:12:02.869]  And, uh, lots going on in the economy, gold and silver.
[02:12:02.869 --> 02:12:04.971]  I should try to rope Ted in here towards the end of the hour.
[02:12:04.971 --> 02:12:06.233]  I know we got phones, too.
[02:12:06.233 --> 02:12:07.514]  I never got to them.
[02:12:07.514 --> 02:12:10.658]  I'm the only person on the radio I know who doesn't lean on the callers.
[02:12:10.658 --> 02:12:14.682]  In fact, even though I'm exhausted, I want to be here and talk about stuff because I don't like being a slave.
[02:12:14.682 --> 02:12:16.244]  I want to fight!
[02:12:16.244 --> 02:12:16.464]  And, um...
[02:12:18.467 --> 02:12:39.479]  It's just up to all of us to do our bit, and these poor brainwashed TSA people who, there's no radiation coming out of those, they've shown me the documents, they said in Las Vegas, when I was out there doing a shoot with Ventura, out at some rocket bases and stuff, when I was flying back out, and I have government, what'd they say, administrative privileges over you.
[02:12:39.479 --> 02:12:40.059]  I mean it's just...
[02:12:41.735 --> 02:12:46.437]  They really believe all this bull that they tell these people.
[02:12:46.437 --> 02:12:48.939]  Would you like to go in a private area to be fondled?
[02:12:48.939 --> 02:12:52.780]  You know, that's where all of this is going and we better do something about it.
[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:57.643]  Bob Chapman, what do you think of Jesse and his lawyer being told it's a star chamber?
[02:12:58.183 --> 02:13:00.064]  You can only go to the appeals court before judges.
[02:13:00.064 --> 02:13:01.285]  That will be secret.
[02:13:01.285 --> 02:13:04.086]  You can't see the ruling, but it's national security.
[02:13:04.086 --> 02:13:15.311]  And you don't have a right to come here and challenge your Fourth Amendment being violated, to travel having your genitals grabbed over and over again, and being put in the microwave by the machines.
[02:13:15.311 --> 02:13:17.152]  Well, it's typical.
[02:13:17.152 --> 02:13:25.016]  It was something that one would have expected, considering the direction that government is headed in America.
[02:13:26.116 --> 02:13:29.078]  And it's still reminiscent of the 1930s in Germany.
[02:13:29.078 --> 02:13:35.542]  I don't have to go into any detail on that because I think most people know about it.
[02:13:35.542 --> 02:13:49.390]  And we've just got to expose exactly what they're doing, make it front page news, and make sure everybody in the country and outside the country sees it as well.
[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:54.393]  Because they are telling you you're going to do what we tell you to do.
[02:13:55.485 --> 02:14:01.430]  And I think it's going to cause a lot of people probably to leave the country who have the ability to do so.
[02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:08.475]  And I know Jesse is spending half of his year down in Baja.
[02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:10.436]  And don't blame him, it's a very nice place.
[02:14:10.436 --> 02:14:13.799]  And he doesn't have to put up with that.
[02:14:14.707 --> 02:14:16.087]  But when he comes back, he does.
[02:14:16.087 --> 02:14:20.409]  Yeah, in a third world collapsed society, he doesn't have to put up with that.
[02:14:20.409 --> 02:14:25.850]  North Korea, they don't grab your genitals unless you're pulled out and they take you for a strip search.
[02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:26.570]  They're not doing that.
[02:14:26.570 --> 02:14:32.112]  I mean, land of the slave, home of the coward.
[02:14:32.112 --> 02:14:32.952]  You're right.
[02:14:32.952 --> 02:14:37.033]  And this is all leading us to the next election.
[02:14:37.033 --> 02:14:39.974]  And if we have it, it'll probably be the last one.
[02:14:41.432 --> 02:14:47.354]  And hopefully we can get Ron Paul and people like him elected through the system.
[02:14:47.354 --> 02:14:50.235]  And then we get a shot at turning this thing around.
[02:14:50.235 --> 02:14:54.917]  And if we all work toward that, then maybe we can get it accomplished.
[02:14:54.917 --> 02:14:56.198]  Because it's so important.
[02:14:56.198 --> 02:14:57.078]  Because this is it.
[02:14:59.275 --> 02:15:03.020]  Well, I'm going to hand the baton over to Paul Watson for the last 45 minutes.
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:04.102]  We've got callers on hold.
[02:15:04.102 --> 02:15:11.151]  Hopefully, you guys will get to those at the bottom of the hour or whenever you wish, whenever Paul wishes, whenever you wish, Bob.
[02:15:11.151 --> 02:15:16.438]  But obviously, right now, Paul's probably going to bring up your perspective on what really happened with Papandreou.
[02:15:17.099 --> 02:15:19.382]  You know, first they're gonna have a referendum and they're not.
[02:15:19.382 --> 02:15:20.243]  Then they are, then they aren't.
[02:15:20.243 --> 02:15:21.005]  Then he steps down.
[02:15:21.005 --> 02:15:22.567]  I mean, all this circuses.
[02:15:22.567 --> 02:15:25.972]  What's really going on with Bob Chapman?
[02:15:25.972 --> 02:15:28.315]  And I'm signing off, folks.
[02:15:28.315 --> 02:15:29.416]  I think I've done my duty here.
[02:15:29.416 --> 02:15:32.981]  I've broadcasted the 27 hours I've broadcasted.
[02:15:34.605 --> 02:15:36.186]  Twenty-one of them or something.
[02:15:36.186 --> 02:15:37.107]  That's fun.
[02:15:37.107 --> 02:15:38.268]  That's a good day's work.
[02:15:38.268 --> 02:15:41.390]  And it's good to know we're fighting the globalists.
[02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:43.611]  And I appreciate all of your support out there.
[02:15:43.611 --> 02:15:46.393]  If you want to be part of this money bomb, Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:15:46.393 --> 02:15:51.477]  You can also find the eBay auction area link on the bottom there.
[02:15:51.477 --> 02:15:54.639]  A lot of one-of-a-kind items that we've got around the office.
[02:15:54.639 --> 02:15:56.741]  Bullhorns, George Bush mask.
[02:15:58.422 --> 02:16:06.348]  Stuff like that, we only do this like once a year, if that, that are available there that go towards the money bomb.
[02:16:06.348 --> 02:16:09.130]  You can also just purchase books, videos, things like that.
[02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:16.855]  But the prices we've got now, what, 14 of my films for $99.95, it's only $300 and something.
[02:16:16.855 --> 02:16:18.977]  Bumper stickers, packs at cost.
[02:16:18.977 --> 02:16:20.458]  I mean, I went and found out the cost.
[02:16:21.465 --> 02:16:22.266]  And that's it.
[02:16:22.266 --> 02:16:26.449]  What it costs to have the guy ship it, the postage, and what the stuff costs.
[02:16:26.449 --> 02:16:29.652]  And those are going gangbusters at Infowars.com.
[02:16:29.652 --> 02:16:31.634]  Paul Watson, go ahead and bring you in here briefly.
[02:16:31.634 --> 02:16:34.276]  What do you think of the Ventura situation?
[02:16:34.276 --> 02:16:39.921]  And I'm just going to say bye and listen to you, and then get into the whole Euro thing, whatever else you want to cover, my friend.
[02:16:39.921 --> 02:16:44.345]  Paul Watson, who heads up PrisonPlanet.com, joining us via video Skype.
[02:16:44.345 --> 02:16:45.266]  That was our tail gunner.
[02:16:45.646 --> 02:16:50.369]  I hand you the baton in the final 45 minutes of the official Money Bomb.
[02:16:50.369 --> 02:16:53.990]  It'll continue throughout the weekend for folks that want to donate over the weekend.
[02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.751]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[02:16:55.899 --> 02:16:57.120]  Thanks Alex.
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.584]  Yeah, just a comment on the TSA and Ventura.
[02:17:01.584 --> 02:17:11.812]  I would add that we have had some achievements specifically as a result of people like Ventura and others standing up against the TSA.
[02:17:11.812 --> 02:17:19.558]  They've now had to dispense with the naked images for the body scanners they're having to put in software which shows a generic outline image.
[02:17:20.499 --> 02:17:21.940]  Um, that's an achievement.
[02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:28.343]  Again, this doesn't stop the groping or anything, but it's, you know, we're chipping away at it, if you like.
[02:17:28.343 --> 02:17:35.587]  In Britain, they've, in Britain's biggest airport, Heathrow, they've had to change the technology they use for the scanners.
[02:17:35.587 --> 02:17:39.790]  No longer are they using the radiation firing technology.
[02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:49.015]  They had to change it to what some corporations like Sony are already using for their employees, which involves a different system, which isn't harmful to health.
[02:17:49.015 --> 02:17:49.135]  So,
[02:17:49.815 --> 02:17:49.895]  Yeah.
[02:18:04.758 --> 02:18:20.145]  The difference between Communist China, which is renowned for torturing and imprisoning its political dissidents, and the experience you have with Homeland Security entering, you know, land of the free, in China you just go straight through the metal detector.
[02:18:20.945 --> 02:18:26.967]  Don't set it off, you go straight through, there's no pat-down whatsoever, stamp your visa, you're in the country, bang.
[02:18:26.967 --> 02:18:39.070]  Homeland Security, you have to literally, and this was seven years ago, iris scan, five fingerprints, you know, grope down and everything, so the difference is stark and it shows.
[02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:42.391]  How deep America has fallen into this tyranny.
[02:18:42.391 --> 02:18:45.453]  But as I said... By the way, just interrupting, I'm back.
[02:18:45.453 --> 02:18:47.094]  Now I don't want to leave.
[02:18:47.094 --> 02:19:01.101]  We've now confirmed that in Miami, we got an email about it in a photo, but now we've checked it out, to get video games, they're now having people, or to sell them back, which they have a lot of places, they biometrically scan you with the police department.
[02:19:01.101 --> 02:19:03.022]  So normal commerce is now criminal.
[02:19:03.022 --> 02:19:03.603]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:19:03.603 --> 02:19:04.303]  I'm out of here, folks.
[02:19:04.303 --> 02:19:05.224]  Great job, everybody.
[02:19:05.224 --> 02:19:05.584]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:10.741]  Yeah, so, again, normal commerce is criminal.
[02:19:10.741 --> 02:19:15.243]  Again, they're trying to outlaw cash in, um, Louisiana and other places in Britain.
[02:19:15.243 --> 02:19:21.767]  They're trying to outlaw cash by blaming the fact that people are stealing copper and metal because of the crumbling economy.
[02:19:21.767 --> 02:19:25.029]  It's worth more and more people trying to sell it on the black market.
[02:19:25.029 --> 02:19:29.091]  And, of course, the government is blaming the fact that they have transactions in cash.
[02:19:29.611 --> 02:19:38.655]  So it's a widespread assault against our freedoms, our personal liberties and our individual convenience down to the level of using cash.
[02:19:38.655 --> 02:19:42.197]  But as I said, you know, if we weren't here it'd be a hell of a lot worse.
[02:19:42.197 --> 02:19:47.319]  So we're chipping away at it and, you know, we're going to keep on doing so.
[02:19:47.319 --> 02:19:51.181]  So we're going to move to Bob Chapman now, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:19:53.092 --> 02:19:54.616]  Actually, we're going to go to break.
[02:19:54.616 --> 02:19:57.042]  Come back with Bob after the break and your calls.
[02:19:57.042 --> 02:19:57.864]  Stay tuned.
[02:19:57.864 --> 02:19:59.488]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com

[02:21:01.226 --> 02:21:02.526]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.526 --> 02:21:08.128]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:08.128 --> 02:21:13.130]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:18.172]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:21:18.712 --> 02:21:23.936]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:21:23.936 --> 02:21:26.237]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:21:26.237 --> 02:21:31.040]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.161]  And here's the best part.
[02:21:32.161 --> 02:21:35.243]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:21:35.243 --> 02:21:38.866]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:21:38.866 --> 02:21:42.048]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:42.048 --> 02:21:44.269]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[02:21:53.076 --> 02:21:57.900]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:21:57.900 --> 02:22:00.903]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:00.903 --> 02:22:02.004]  Storable foods?

[02:23:56.977 --> 02:23:59.960]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:24:13.812 --> 02:24:24.060]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show live in Bob Wars Moneybomb.com and we're joined by Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:37.850]  Of course, earlier in the week we saw the Greek Prime Minister Papandreou threaten to call this referendum on the EU bailout package, which in itself was largely political bluffing, even if the Greek people had
[02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:40.010]  Being allowed to vote.
[02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:53.415]  History tells us, in the case of Ireland, Denmark and France, when Europeans vote against the EU, the EU simply ignores the referendum, or keeps having more referendums until they get the vote they want.
[02:24:53.415 --> 02:24:56.816]  As any good dictatorship would.
[02:24:56.816 --> 02:25:06.639]  But again, Papandreou, he brings up this idea of a referendum literally the day after Sarkozy and Merkel have a quiet word in his ear, and it's promptly dropped.
[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:14.608]  And so we have this euro bailout crisis bandwagon black comedy rolling on and on.
[02:25:14.608 --> 02:25:22.558]  The euro swings from one extreme to the other against the dollar on each little rumour that comes out on a day-by-day basis.
[02:25:22.558 --> 02:25:23.239]  Bob Chapman.
[02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:27.270]  I mean, give us the latest on this Euro crisis.
[02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:41.592]  I want to know, how can a problem with Greece and these other pigs countries that was caused by taking on too much debt possibly be solved by taking on yet more debt?
[02:25:41.592 --> 02:25:44.133]  Well, obviously it cannot.
[02:25:44.133 --> 02:25:46.633]  That's easy to figure out.
[02:25:46.633 --> 02:25:53.915]  It's a saving of the Euro in the Eurozone and the European Union, and I think
[02:25:55.024 --> 02:26:10.674]  That Papandreou probably first introduced this referendum thinking that it might get him out of the situation that he was in as easily as possible.
[02:26:10.674 --> 02:26:17.919]  And of course when he went to Cannes yesterday he was told unceremoniously, I'm sure, what are you doing?
[02:26:17.919 --> 02:26:19.420]  Why would you do a thing like that?
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:22.962]  You know the polls show 60-70% of the people are going to vote no.
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:36.769]  And even if you twist the question that's to be answered yes or no, you're not going to fool that many people because they expect you to post something like that.
[02:26:36.769 --> 02:26:45.196]  And so now they're having a meeting to see if they want to keep Mr. Papandreou in office.
[02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:50.280]  A confidence or non-confidence vote, which is very, very close.
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:53.102]  And I'm sure that somebody there from
[02:26:55.350 --> 02:27:06.078]  Tasek is running around with a bushel basket of 500 euro notes saying, we want you to vote for us.
[02:27:06.078 --> 02:27:08.700]  That's probably what's going on.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:13.223]  Some of us, it is a shade better, but no great shake.
[02:27:13.223 --> 02:27:18.246]  Those two are roommates at Harvard, for those of you who don't know that.
[02:27:18.246 --> 02:27:21.609]  And they used to be in the same party together until I had a minor falling out.
[02:27:22.501 --> 02:27:27.863]  And Samaras has formed his own party, and I don't think he's going to do that much to help.
[02:27:27.863 --> 02:27:39.708]  But they simply, they, the people in Greater Europe, in the powerful positions, want a yes on the second bailout.
[02:27:39.708 --> 02:27:41.569]  That's what they're interested in.
[02:27:41.569 --> 02:27:43.950]  They don't want anybody leaving the euro.
[02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:45.630]  That's really what it's about.
[02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:48.412]  But the problems don't end there.
[02:27:48.412 --> 02:27:51.853]  You've got the German Constitutional Court before the end of the year is going to say,
[02:27:52.498 --> 02:28:18.867]  Whether the second bailout and the committee of 12 that they formed to bypass legislation in Germany and the ability to leverage is legal under the German constitution and the politicians have already been told in Germany it's not legal and so
[02:28:19.813 --> 02:28:20.873]  Where is that going to go?
[02:28:20.873 --> 02:28:23.134]  It's going to be interesting to see.
[02:28:23.134 --> 02:28:31.995]  You can go allocate the money, but until the German Constitutional Court makes their decision, they can't leverage it.
[02:28:31.995 --> 02:28:40.857]  And they do that by using derivatives instead of having just about $500 billion, of which Germany put up half of it.
[02:28:40.857 --> 02:28:47.718]  That money would grow to $1.4 trillion if leverage is allowed.
[02:28:48.337 --> 02:28:50.578]  And derivatives are allowed.
[02:28:50.578 --> 02:28:53.579]  But the hook is this.
[02:28:53.579 --> 02:28:58.360]  What's it going to cost to clean up the six nation mess?
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:01.721]  Before between four and six trillion dollars.
[02:29:01.721 --> 02:29:03.301]  They don't have that kind of money.
[02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:06.222]  And even if they printed it.
[02:29:06.222 --> 02:29:09.223]  Inflation in Europe would go ballistic.
[02:29:09.223 --> 02:29:12.124]  And so you haven't seen the end of this thing yet.
[02:29:15.233 --> 02:29:22.337]  But, say Greece leaves the Euro, it goes back to the Drachmar, it rebuilds its economy from the ground up.
[02:29:22.337 --> 02:29:24.518]  You know, it's a haven for tourism.
[02:29:24.518 --> 02:29:25.999]  It's possible that it could do that.
[02:29:25.999 --> 02:29:31.502]  Why are they so afraid of what would happen if Greece was to leave the Euro?
[02:29:31.502 --> 02:29:35.244]  Is it because it's going to be a domino effect for the whole Eurozone?
[02:29:35.244 --> 02:29:38.786]  We'll get your answer after the break, Bob, because we're going to commercial now.
[02:29:39.406 --> 02:29:41.348]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:29:41.348 --> 02:29:42.009]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:42.009 --> 02:29:45.753]  We're talking to Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:29:45.753 --> 02:29:50.799]  Stay there.
[02:29:50.799 --> 02:29:52.181]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.181 --> 02:29:53.782]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.782 --> 02:29:57.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.702 --> 02:30:07.383]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:30:07.383 --> 02:30:13.805]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:30:13.805 --> 02:30:16.085]  Number one, study the past.
[02:30:16.085 --> 02:30:18.486]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:30:18.486 --> 02:30:22.207]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:30:23.328 --> 02:30:26.431]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:30:26.431 --> 02:30:30.274]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:30:30.274 --> 02:30:39.323]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:30:39.323 --> 02:30:42.746]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:30:42.746 --> 02:30:46.369]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:52.157]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:30:52.157 --> 02:30:56.783]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:56.783 --> 02:30:58.946]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:00.934 --> 02:31:02.115]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.115 --> 02:31:09.039]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.039 --> 02:31:11.601]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.601 --> 02:31:16.984]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.984 --> 02:31:20.026]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.026 --> 02:31:22.087]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.327 --> 02:31:28.591]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.591 --> 02:31:31.953]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.953 --> 02:31:37.737]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.737 --> 02:31:39.378]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.378 --> 02:31:40.679]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.679 --> 02:31:43.361]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.361 --> 02:31:47.583]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.583 --> 02:31:50.185]  You can find the video at www dot
[02:31:50.605 --> 02:32:02.234]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:33:04.663 --> 02:33:05.936]  I'm good.
[02:33:14.858 --> 02:33:28.505]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show, final hour here on this Friday, November 4th, Moneybomb Marathon Special, InfoWarsMoneybomb.com, talking to Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:33:28.505 --> 02:33:38.230]  Bob, just finishing up on the Euro issue, what happens if Greece leaves the Euro and why are the G20 elite so afraid of that possibility?
[02:33:41.448 --> 02:34:02.855]  Well, I talked about this a couple of years ago on radio and television, as well as in the press in Greece, and I told them that they should default in totality, go to the Dakmar and devalue it versus the Euro by 50%, and clean up their act, and in five years they'd be out of the woods.
[02:34:02.855 --> 02:34:06.256]  And I think that's the way it's going to end up.
[02:34:06.256 --> 02:34:08.537]  They're playing this game that they've got going.
[02:34:09.415 --> 02:34:14.658]  And not the Greeks, the powers of Europe will call them.
[02:34:14.658 --> 02:34:30.567]  And again, as I said at the beginning of the conversation, saving the Euro is extraordinarily important for them, because once it goes, then they have to reconfigure everything they're doing, and do it on a national sovereign basis.
[02:34:30.567 --> 02:34:37.491]  They won't be able to put the links in place to create their world government, and that's really what they're up to.
[02:34:37.491 --> 02:34:37.831]  And so,
[02:34:38.825 --> 02:34:49.212]  If Greece were to fail, and it will in time, because it can't carry that load, and I don't think the people will cooperate.
[02:34:49.212 --> 02:34:56.877]  They are absolutely outraged, and have been for two years, and they'll be in the streets, and they just won't play.
[02:34:56.877 --> 02:35:00.079]  The revenuers won't come in to pay the interest of the bonds.
[02:35:00.079 --> 02:35:03.021]  But you're right, Paul.
[02:35:03.021 --> 02:35:06.624]  The look of all of this is
[02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:12.974]  We got to keep the euro together and no matter what.
[02:35:12.974 --> 02:35:15.736]  But they're really just buying time.
[02:35:15.736 --> 02:35:20.259]  I think they know they're beyond the pale, that they can't make it work.
[02:35:20.259 --> 02:35:23.181]  And I think they've known this from the very beginning.
[02:35:23.181 --> 02:35:27.284]  They should have never let the banks make the kind of loans that they did.
[02:35:27.284 --> 02:35:28.224]  The banks didn't care.
[02:35:28.224 --> 02:35:34.889]  They made the loans out of money out of thin air and expected the public to pay them back.
[02:35:34.889 --> 02:35:36.510]  And that's essentially what's happening.
[02:35:36.963 --> 02:35:40.045]  But I don't think it's going to continue to go on that way.
[02:35:40.045 --> 02:35:44.409]  And Greece would go bankrupt eventually.
[02:35:44.409 --> 02:35:46.590]  Three months, six months down the line.
[02:35:46.590 --> 02:35:47.871]  Very possible.
[02:35:47.871 --> 02:35:52.715]  And of course they would take Ireland and Portugal with them.
[02:35:52.715 --> 02:35:56.077]  And Ireland is a terrible mess.
[02:35:56.077 --> 02:35:58.880]  The politicians have sold their people out.
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:02.342]  And they've assumed the debts of the banks.
[02:36:02.342 --> 02:36:04.564]  Most of the foreign banks in Ireland.
[02:36:05.359 --> 02:36:14.926]  And the amount of money that they're on the hook for to pay interest on and guarantee the bonds is far beyond the capacity.
[02:36:14.926 --> 02:36:18.889]  They'll be in depression for 20, 30 years.
[02:36:18.889 --> 02:36:24.173]  And so that Greece going under will take the others with it.
[02:36:24.173 --> 02:36:25.454]  And they're definitely afraid of that.
[02:36:25.454 --> 02:36:27.315]  And they almost got to that point.
[02:36:27.315 --> 02:36:32.840]  And they still may be at that point if Bob Andreou loses the confidence vote.
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:33.880]  Because the next step is
[02:36:35.328 --> 02:36:35.728]  I don't
[02:37:00.416 --> 02:37:02.819]  Okay, switching gears for the moment.
[02:37:02.819 --> 02:37:05.803]  Story out today which has interested me.
[02:37:05.803 --> 02:37:13.153]  HSBC customers impacted by quote, worldwide meltdown of all retail services.
[02:37:13.153 --> 02:37:17.178]  Now, a few weeks ago we had problems with Bank of America ATMs.
[02:37:18.239 --> 02:37:33.253]  And now we have what's being dubbed a worldwide meltdown in which online banking, ATMs and debit cards appear to have been blocked and no customer access is available and that's for HSBC customers, obviously one of the biggest banks in the world.
[02:37:33.253 --> 02:37:40.780]  Bob, is this just technical gremlins or is there something deeper at work with all these ATM failures we've seen recently?
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:43.563]  Well, it's very hard to say.
[02:37:44.644 --> 02:38:01.707]  Knowing the people that we're dealing with, there is a possibility they would take the systems down over here and over there for a day or two to get the people warmed up to the fact that maybe that would happen again and maybe for a longer period of time.
[02:38:01.707 --> 02:38:12.449]  As we all know, they want to get people out of cash and into debit and credit cards in totality to be followed at some time in some way with
[02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:18.994]  I don't think the people will ever stand for that.
[02:38:18.994 --> 02:38:23.358]  We don't know until we get there, but I don't think it's anywhere imminent.
[02:38:23.358 --> 02:38:29.923]  But I can't venture a guess on HSBC's system going down.
[02:38:29.923 --> 02:38:31.024]  And it is extensive.
[02:38:31.024 --> 02:38:32.405]  It's all over the world.
[02:38:34.824 --> 02:38:54.021]  Well it's interesting because last year we had the article where Citigroup was sending out an advisory to its customers where basically it said we reserve the right, although it's not in place, we reserve the right to require seven days advance notice before permitting a withdrawal from all checking accounts.
[02:38:54.021 --> 02:39:01.907]  So they've got these rules and regulations on the books which you agree to when you sign up for a checking account with them where they can say
[02:39:02.828 --> 02:39:06.789]  Right, you want to withdraw $1,000, you're going to have to wait a week.
[02:39:06.789 --> 02:39:20.174]  So it seems to me that definitely preparing for this day when, if this financial collapse does come and it comes down quickly, then they're going to have massive restrictions on people withdrawing cash to, in their words, prevent panic.
[02:39:20.174 --> 02:39:22.895]  So, it's very interesting to see how that develops.
[02:39:24.784 --> 02:39:33.989]  On the jobs figures, the phony unemployment figure, which isn't even the real number, has dropped by 0.1% today.
[02:39:33.989 --> 02:39:38.372]  And the talking point is, quote, things are so bad, this looks good.
[02:39:38.372 --> 02:39:44.535]  I mean, Bob, is this 0.1% drop a cause for a big celebration?
[02:39:44.535 --> 02:39:48.137]  Well, of course not.
[02:39:49.068 --> 02:39:51.289]  And, uh, employment hasn't come down.
[02:39:51.289 --> 02:39:52.589]  They're just Mickey Mouse there.
[02:39:52.589 --> 02:39:56.090]  The birth-death ratio figures again.
[02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:59.531]  And that is the birth of and the death of businesses.
[02:39:59.531 --> 02:40:03.252]  And government guesses at that every month and has for a long time.
[02:40:03.252 --> 02:40:07.013]  And it's an excuse to create jobs that were never created.
[02:40:07.013 --> 02:40:08.853]  And they do it all the time.
[02:40:08.853 --> 02:40:12.214]  And, uh, uh, what you gotta look at it as, uh, is, uh, M6.
[02:40:16.327 --> 02:40:20.550]  The figure you just referred to, 9%, is M3.
[02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:23.031]  That's short-term unemployment.
[02:40:23.031 --> 02:40:28.555]  You've got the others in there, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, with 6 being the total.
[02:40:28.555 --> 02:40:32.237]  6 including the Brit death ratio.
[02:40:32.237 --> 02:40:39.782]  And I don't know what today's figure is, but it was 16 and 5 eighths percent unemployment.
[02:40:39.782 --> 02:40:42.104]  Now, if you remove the Brit death ratio, you get 22.6%.
[02:40:45.194 --> 02:40:59.519]  And so that's really what the unemployment rate is, and that's why people subscribe to my publication to see what the real number is, or John Williams, who's the best at figuring all that stuff out.
[02:40:59.519 --> 02:41:12.543]  And the government is not getting away with what they're doing, but on the other hand, unfortunately, everybody isn't listening to what we're telling them about this figure, 9%,
[02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:23.093]  That comes across on all the wire services and on the television programs and everybody believes it because they don't know any better.
[02:41:23.093 --> 02:41:28.139]  And they're not expected to know any better unless they listen to programs like Alex Jones.
[02:41:30.953 --> 02:41:43.361]  Now, we've been talking at length on this show, certainly about the war-fussing that Israel, the US and the United Kingdom have put themselves on, regarding an attack on Iran within the next 12 months.
[02:41:43.361 --> 02:41:51.826]  We've got the article up at Prison Planet and InfoWars.com right now, which is, Obama tells allies US will attack Iran by Fall 2012.
[02:41:53.507 --> 02:42:00.931]  And basically that's out of Debka file which is an Israeli intelligence outlet which has been proven accurate in the past.
[02:42:00.931 --> 02:42:11.738]  They predicted almost precisely when the Libya conflict would be wound up, when NATO would go in and attack Tripoli and then obviously immediately after Gaddafi went on the run.
[02:42:11.738 --> 02:42:15.020]  So they've been proven accurate in the past and now they're saying that
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:30.448]  Immediately after NATO wound down operations on Monday in Libya that Obama told Germany, Italy, Israel and Saudi Arabia that if Iran does not give up its nuclear, they call it nuclear weaponization program
[02:42:30.768 --> 02:42:35.191]  The only evidence that's really being presented is that it's for energy.
[02:42:35.191 --> 02:42:48.019]  If they don't give up that program by September 2012, because they're afraid they'll move it underground and they won't be able to bomb it out of existence, then Obama has given the green light for this invasion.
[02:42:48.019 --> 02:42:48.659]  Of course we had
[02:42:49.679 --> 02:43:08.151]  Yesterday the former Israeli intelligence chiefs out of Mossad and Shin Bet came out that they're basically leaking information about these attack plans in a bid to derail them and in an effort to bring down Netanyahu, take him out of office before he can oversee this.
[02:43:08.151 --> 02:43:10.333]  So we've got massive war footing, we've got
[02:43:11.073 --> 02:43:12.914]  Anecdotal reports.
[02:43:12.914 --> 02:43:15.396]  Alex Jones said his cousin told him the same thing.
[02:43:15.396 --> 02:43:16.957]  I've seen other reports of U.S.
[02:43:16.957 --> 02:43:19.158]  troops being sent to Kuwait.
[02:43:19.158 --> 02:43:25.002]  This is supposedly, after the withdrawal from Iraq, it's about rearranging U.S.
[02:43:25.002 --> 02:43:30.645]  forces in the Persian Gulf, specifically for targeting Iran.
[02:43:30.645 --> 02:43:31.466]  Now Bob, I mean,
[02:43:33.287 --> 02:43:41.992]  If it comes to pass and we do see this attack on Iran in the next 12 months and it escalates in the region, what's the economic impact going to be?
[02:43:41.992 --> 02:43:49.456]  Are we going to see another rush to safety with the gold and the dollar or could it cause even greater problems?
[02:43:49.456 --> 02:43:57.860]  Well, I think the immediate effect would be on the price of oil and that would be followed by gold and silver and commodities.
[02:43:58.818 --> 02:44:00.540]  The stock market would go down.
[02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:09.868]  I would think that the bond market, which would usually be somewhat buoyant, would probably be relatively unchanged.
[02:44:09.868 --> 02:44:10.289]  The U.S.
[02:44:10.289 --> 02:44:17.775]  government will be in the markets trying to manipulate them, as they always do now, legally.
[02:44:17.775 --> 02:44:25.102]  And so it'll be a hard fight for commodities gold and silver to move up, but they will.
[02:44:26.148 --> 02:44:34.571]  And they're going to try to save the Wall Street market and the bond market, which is 100 times bigger.
[02:44:34.571 --> 02:44:37.351]  And that won't last very long.
[02:44:37.351 --> 02:44:47.274]  I think they'll go down and the yields will increase on bonds because that's a very, very difficult event.
[02:44:47.274 --> 02:44:53.056]  You know, they continue to use the ability to
[02:44:54.829 --> 02:45:02.835]  Use lightning strikes and large amounts of munitions to accomplish what they want to do.
[02:45:02.835 --> 02:45:13.823]  And if they do attack Iran, and they don't have Iran in a difficult position within two or three weeks, that could last for years.
[02:45:13.823 --> 02:45:17.706]  And maybe Russia and China might get involved.
[02:45:17.706 --> 02:45:19.387]  We don't know.
[02:45:19.387 --> 02:45:22.770]  And so, yes, they probably will do that.
[02:45:23.391 --> 02:45:26.294]  When they will do it, I don't know.
[02:45:26.294 --> 02:45:28.836]  But it's on the plate for a long time.
[02:45:28.836 --> 02:45:32.980]  And a lot of people have projected different date periods.
[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:35.342]  And they've all been wrong, obviously.
[02:45:35.342 --> 02:45:38.584]  And you shouldn't do that because you don't know.
[02:45:38.584 --> 02:45:43.249]  I mean, unless you work for the Mossad or the CIA.
[02:45:43.249 --> 02:45:50.375]  And so you'll just have to be happy with the projection that it's going to happen in all probability.
[02:45:51.397 --> 02:45:57.841]  But we don't know when, but over the next year looks like a possible time.
[02:45:57.841 --> 02:46:03.766]  Now, I saw an interesting video earlier this week and it got a lot of attention and that was Peter Schiff.
[02:46:05.009 --> 02:46:23.822]  Representing the quote 1% he went down to Occupy Wall Street and he basically confronted the protesters and he was saying look you know I've got a company that employs 150 people how many people do you employ and he was trying to make the point to them that many of the Occupy Wall Street protesters are
[02:46:24.002 --> 02:46:44.512]  We are calling for solutions that would not target the super rich elite, but would cripple the American middle class and middle class businesses by supporting this Warren Buffett tax plan, which is also advocated by the Obama administration, which wouldn't even affect the top 1% who all hide their wealth in offshore accounts.
[02:46:44.512 --> 02:46:50.154]  It would affect the American middle class and real businesses that employ American people.
[02:46:50.154 --> 02:46:53.416]  Bob, if you could go down there to Occupy Wall Street,
[02:46:54.116 --> 02:47:07.703]  Um, what would you say to these protesters who, in many cases, are arguing for solutions, uh, that would lead to more draconian, uh, worse economic conditions for most American citizens than is already the case?
[02:47:07.703 --> 02:47:11.745]  What would you say to Occupy Wall Street?
[02:47:11.745 --> 02:47:17.908]  It doesn't work, and their manifesto of answers looks like it was written by Karl Marx.
[02:47:17.908 --> 02:47:20.790]  But that's only the segment that is running the thing.
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:31.544]  You have an equal amount of people now participating that are telling people who are there, that doesn't work, and here's why it doesn't.
[02:47:31.544 --> 02:47:36.986]  And we've got to get rid of the Fed Reserve, and yes, Wall Street are a bunch of criminals.
[02:47:36.986 --> 02:47:46.329]  I mean, we just had a company go under yesterday, and they're missing a billion, or a billion and a quarter, or $700 million.
[02:47:50.584 --> 02:47:54.285]  And this sort of thing goes on frequently.
[02:47:54.285 --> 02:47:59.007]  And so, yes, there has to be changes on Wall Street.
[02:47:59.007 --> 02:48:06.030]  And the changes have to start with the SEC and the CFTC, the regulatory arms of the government.
[02:48:06.030 --> 02:48:08.871]  Because they just do what the government tells them to do.
[02:48:08.871 --> 02:48:12.052]  And the big firms very seldom get touched.
[02:48:12.052 --> 02:48:18.795]  And if anything, they might get a fine and have their hands slapped.
[02:48:19.488 --> 02:48:23.349]  When they're stealing billions of dollars, it's incredible!
[02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:41.214]  And so, the thing started off being funded by people, I think, who wanted it to turn into a confrontation which would lead to violence, and then martial law.
[02:48:41.214 --> 02:48:43.374]  That's what I think they were up to.
[02:48:43.374 --> 02:48:46.575]  And that's why a lot of those old-time communists
[02:48:47.139 --> 02:48:48.160]  Are in there.
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:52.643]  Some of whom I've met and know from the 60s.
[02:48:52.643 --> 02:48:55.105]  And they've been neutralized.
[02:48:55.105 --> 02:49:00.389]  I think the public has gotten into the ranks and they've neutralized it to a great extent.
[02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:01.450]  And I'm happy about that.
[02:49:04.068 --> 02:49:09.911]  Okay, we're going to go to the break shortly, but I'm going to come back with Bob Chapman for the final segment.
[02:49:09.911 --> 02:49:13.774]  Again, I want to direct people to infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:49:13.774 --> 02:49:18.957]  We're in the final ten minutes of the donation drive today.
[02:49:18.957 --> 02:49:20.278]  Again, as I've said before,
[02:49:21.078 --> 02:49:23.219]  You know, we're not funded by George Soros.
[02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:25.539]  We're not funded by the Carnegie Institute.
[02:49:25.539 --> 02:49:28.160]  We don't get handouts from these kind of people.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:42.745]  We're completely funded by our listeners and our readers, and this is how we've been able to challenge the establishment media, particularly over the past two years with building the TV studio and reaching more people than ever.
[02:49:42.745 --> 02:49:48.807]  We get more traffic to Infowars.com than MSNBC.com, for example.
[02:49:49.307 --> 02:49:55.150]  Which of course is funded by General Electric and we're not which is why we need your support.
[02:49:55.150 --> 02:50:17.001]  But that just illustrates really how many people we've been able to reach on an independent media platform that does not get handouts from NGOs or billionaire philanthropists as many of the leftist foundation websites do like moveon.org, Think Progress and Media Matters and of course
[02:50:17.461 --> 02:50:28.251]  We get more traffic than all of them as well because at least we try to tell the truth and our message is not poisoned by political influences from either the left or the right.
[02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:30.673]  We're going to take a break shortly.
[02:50:30.673 --> 02:50:32.475]  We're going to get back to Bob Chapman.
[02:50:33.729 --> 02:50:40.295]  Again, the major issue at the moment on InfoWars.com is this upcoming attack on Iran.
[02:50:40.295 --> 02:50:53.287]  Earlier I was talking to Brian Gerrish about how the Israeli lobbies have actually got in with BBC and Sky News editors and made them, quote, change their narrative on Israel and Iran.
[02:50:53.287 --> 02:50:56.590]  So we're going to see a lot more of that, an article, big article on that coming up.
[02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:58.972]  Stay tuned, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:51:02.796 --> 02:51:11.281]  Whatever winter activity you enjoy, from snowmobiling, snowshoeing, skiing, or camping, there's inherent danger that you may find yourself having to stay warm.
[02:51:11.281 --> 02:51:15.864]  Be ready with Instafire, a revolutionary safe, simple, and versatile fire starter.
[02:51:15.864 --> 02:51:18.185]  Instafire is a patented blend of volcanic rock,
[02:51:18.365 --> 02:51:22.128]  Wood pellets and paraffin wax that gets a fire blazing in just minutes.
[02:51:22.128 --> 02:51:27.753]  Instafire is self-sustaining fire that starts right on top of snow or water and even burns wet wood.
[02:51:27.753 --> 02:51:28.753]  Sound incredible?
[02:51:28.753 --> 02:51:29.414]  It is.

[02:51:31.576 --> 02:51:33.737]  A must for any outdoor winter activity.
[02:51:33.737 --> 02:51:36.920]  Instafire easily lights with matches or flintlock lighters.
[02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:38.441]  Is environmentally friendly.
[02:51:38.441 --> 02:51:39.282]  Stores easy.
[02:51:39.282 --> 02:51:39.982]  Is lightweight.
[02:51:39.982 --> 02:51:41.444]  Comes in a variety of sizes.
[02:51:41.444 --> 02:51:46.868]  And starts at $1.25 for a single pack or only $59.95 for a 5-gallon pail with free shipping.
[02:51:47.088 --> 02:51:52.473]  Go to instafire.com spelled I-N-S-T-A fire.com or call 888-482-4868.
[02:51:52.473 --> 02:51:52.734]  That's 888-482-4868.
[02:51:52.734 --> 02:51:52.894]  Safe.
[02:51:52.894 --> 02:51:53.054]  Simple.
[02:51:53.054 --> 02:51:53.314]  Versatile.
[02:51:53.314 --> 02:51:53.855]  Instafire.
[02:52:01.437 --> 02:52:07.261]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[02:52:07.261 --> 02:52:10.483]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[02:52:10.483 --> 02:52:21.791]  We promote premium quality health, energy, and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.

[02:52:41.464 --> 02:52:42.485]  Want to find out more?
[02:52:42.485 --> 02:52:49.149]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[02:52:49.149 --> 02:52:51.571]  That's the initials MZ at InfoWarsTeam.com.

[02:52:56.815 --> 02:52:58.276]  And these are phenomenal.

[02:53:01.238 --> 02:53:03.499]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.

[02:54:11.169 --> 02:54:14.970]  Welcome back, it's the final segment of the Money Bomb Marathon.
[02:54:14.970 --> 02:54:21.711]  You made it to the end, and we're talking to Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:21.711 --> 02:54:27.872]  Bob, tell people how they can subscribe to The International Forecaster.
[02:54:27.872 --> 02:54:36.534]  Well, the easiest way is probably to get a hold of the people at MIDAS, and that number is 877-479-8178.
[02:54:41.365 --> 02:54:43.846]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:54:43.846 --> 02:54:46.666]  That's toll free.
[02:54:46.666 --> 02:54:56.469]  And they will send you a copy either of the email version or the hard copy version of the International Forecaster.
[02:54:56.469 --> 02:55:03.711]  And they also have a offering for a full one year free subscription.
[02:55:03.711 --> 02:55:07.712]  And the deal that they're offering I think is terrific.
[02:55:07.712 --> 02:55:10.793]  We have many, many, many people take advantage of it.
[02:55:11.454 --> 02:55:13.975]  And it's a purchase of one coin.
[02:55:13.975 --> 02:55:17.476]  I don't know the price of it today, but I'll guess at $360.
[02:55:17.476 --> 02:55:27.880]  And if you do that, and that's a very competitive price that they're offering them at, you can get a free one-year subscription.
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:32.042]  So if you want to be a subscriber, that's certainly an inexpensive way to do it.
[02:55:34.727 --> 02:55:39.412]  Now, I mean, we've got all this financial turmoil swirling.
[02:55:39.412 --> 02:55:42.495]  How can people best protect their wealth?
[02:55:42.495 --> 02:55:49.643]  What can they do to thrive and prosper even in these difficult times, Bob?
[02:55:49.643 --> 02:55:51.745]  There's only one way.
[02:55:51.745 --> 02:55:55.269]  And that's to buy gold and silver coins, bullion and shares.
[02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.750]  And that's it.
[02:55:57.089 --> 02:55:58.971]  I've been in the markets for 53 years.
[02:55:58.971 --> 02:56:02.213]  I owned my own brokerage firm for many years.
[02:56:02.213 --> 02:56:05.856]  I was on Wall Street for almost 30 years.
[02:56:05.856 --> 02:56:11.560]  And now I have a second avocation for 23 years, which is writing the International Forecaster.
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:15.443]  But debt is the only way.
[02:56:15.443 --> 02:56:16.704]  Markets will go up and down.
[02:56:16.704 --> 02:56:18.725]  There'll be a lot of volatility.
[02:56:18.725 --> 02:56:24.750]  But if you look at history, you'll see that it is the only way for you to preserve your wealth.
[02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:26.171]  And that's really what you're trying to do.
[02:56:26.713 --> 02:56:29.755]  You happen to make money at it, well that's fine.
[02:56:29.755 --> 02:56:32.216]  But that's not the intention.
[02:56:32.216 --> 02:56:36.879]  The intention is wealth preservation.
[02:56:36.879 --> 02:56:39.020]  And I mean, gold's taken a breather.
[02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:43.122]  It went up past 1800, it's back to 1750.
[02:56:43.122 --> 02:56:45.804]  When do you envisage the 2000 level?
[02:56:45.804 --> 02:56:50.546]  Is it going to be next year or before the end of the year, Bob?
[02:56:50.546 --> 02:56:53.508]  I think very much so that it'll be 2000 to 2200 by the end of the year.
[02:56:56.133 --> 02:57:00.294]  And usually January and February are very good months for gold.
[02:57:00.294 --> 02:57:06.316]  And so with that said, we have a shot at $2,500 or higher, maybe $3,000.
[02:57:06.316 --> 02:57:13.379]  And you always have to remember that the government's your enemy because they're in rigging those markets all the time.
[02:57:13.379 --> 02:57:14.859]  There are no free markets left.
[02:57:14.859 --> 02:57:21.481]  And it's not only gold and silver, but it's commodities and bonds and stocks worldwide.
[02:57:21.481 --> 02:57:23.842]  And so you're going to have to contend with that.
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.740]  And there's going to be a lot of volatility.
[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:28.521]  So expect it.
[02:57:28.521 --> 02:57:38.243]  But there's nothing in which you can invest today that doesn't have volatility unless it's flat on its pants.
[02:57:38.243 --> 02:57:40.123]  And you could take real estate as an example.
[02:57:40.123 --> 02:57:41.083]  It's still going down.
[02:57:41.083 --> 02:57:42.804]  It'll continue to go down.
[02:57:42.804 --> 02:57:46.005]  It may not recover for 20 or 30 years.
[02:57:46.005 --> 02:57:50.245]  So you really don't want to be there for any reason.
[02:57:50.245 --> 02:57:52.806]  And so the safest place to be
[02:57:53.398 --> 02:57:56.495]  Is in the gold and silver related venue.
[02:57:57.745 --> 02:58:01.607]  Hey guys, Alex Jones here, interrupting in customary fashion right at the end.
[02:58:01.607 --> 02:58:03.208]  I want to thank Bob Chapman.
[02:58:03.208 --> 02:58:06.809]  I want to thank Aaron Dykes.
[02:58:06.809 --> 02:58:08.490]  I want to thank Paul Watts.
[02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:12.672]  I want to thank the entire crew and everybody and all the folks that were here.
[02:58:12.672 --> 02:58:18.515]  I want to thank the people that have donated to the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:58:18.515 --> 02:58:26.159]  And I never even made my point, because I don't like asking for donations, that Red McCombs last week, Richard Reeves pointed this out to me,
[02:58:27.179 --> 02:58:29.800]  Gave six million dollars to the University North of Austin.
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:31.941]  What's the name of that university?
[02:58:31.941 --> 02:58:33.241]  Yeah, Southwestern.
[02:58:33.241 --> 02:58:35.722]  For their football team.
[02:58:35.722 --> 02:58:39.123]  Folks, we need the heavy hitters to donate.
[02:58:39.123 --> 02:58:43.685]  Stay there, we're coming back with more news.
[02:58:43.685 --> 02:58:46.506]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.506 --> 02:58:47.506]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.791 --> 02:58:57.216]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:58:57.216 --> 02:59:01.180]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:15.914 --> 02:59:21.859]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:21.859 --> 02:59:26.063]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:59:26.063 --> 02:59:30.367]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:30.367 --> 02:59:36.312]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:36.312 --> 02:59:39.875]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:39.875 --> 02:59:41.836]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:41.836 --> 02:59:42.277]  It's here.

[02:59:52.460 --> 02:59:56.062]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.062 --> 02:59:59.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.863 --> 03:00:11.027]  Big Brother
[03:00:12.466 --> 03:00:15.228]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:15.228 --> 03:00:17.771]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:17.771 --> 03:00:19.772]  You want answers?
[03:00:19.772 --> 03:00:21.674]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.674 --> 03:00:27.959]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.704 --> 03:00:37.428]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now 27 plus hours into this transmission, and I've decided to go for another hour.
[03:00:37.428 --> 03:00:38.669]  No, I'm just joking.
[03:00:38.669 --> 03:00:40.110]  I actually have hit my second wind.
[03:00:40.110 --> 03:00:41.751]  I feel great!
[03:00:41.751 --> 03:00:43.973]  Man, I felt hammered this morning when I woke up.
[03:00:43.973 --> 03:00:48.636]  I went to sleep for a few hours while Watson filled in, and he came back, of course.
[03:00:48.636 --> 03:00:54.339]  And, uh, coming up, we're gonna turn off all the converters and things here in about five minutes.
[03:00:54.339 --> 03:00:58.502]  Well, guys, we can't turn it off, because some stations actually carry this next hour.
[03:00:59.881 --> 03:01:00.761]  Genesis will do it.
[03:01:00.761 --> 03:01:02.102]  Okay, you guys have already all worked it out.
[03:01:02.102 --> 03:01:03.683]  Here I am worrying about all this.
[03:01:03.683 --> 03:01:10.446]  But if you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv, we're going to 27 hours restream the entire show.
[03:01:10.446 --> 03:01:11.586]  And I don't know what they're doing.
[03:01:11.586 --> 03:01:18.229]  We were talking about airing the middle of the night first and then, you know, kind of mixing it up for people that miss that.
[03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:22.471]  We got a Skull & Bones special, never-before-behind-the-scenes stuff with Charlotte Israeli.
[03:01:24.639 --> 03:01:25.619]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:01:25.619 --> 03:01:32.783]  And what the streams and the links you've got that are on InfoWars.com will be dead for about 10-15 minutes?
[03:01:32.783 --> 03:01:34.844]  15-30.
[03:01:34.844 --> 03:01:38.425]  And it'll all fire back up so those pages you have, those video links.
[03:01:38.425 --> 03:01:39.666]  Again, Bob Chapman's here with us.
[03:01:39.666 --> 03:01:44.088]  I just want to point this out because I never really got up here and started pitching all this.
[03:01:44.088 --> 03:01:46.429]  And I just had a lady who wanted to talk to me on the phone.
[03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:47.990]  I'm about to leave, folks, so I can't talk.
[03:01:48.843 --> 03:01:53.328]  And another fellow said he wanted to make a big donation, and I think we wrote the number down wrong or something, but whatever.
[03:01:53.328 --> 03:01:59.835]  The point is, is that I do not want people's little donations if you don't have the money.
[03:01:59.835 --> 03:02:03.760]  If you're worth $10 million and want to give me $5, that's great, we appreciate it, thank you.
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:06.943]  Or spread the word about the show, or buy my DVDs and make copies and get them out to people.
[03:02:06.943 --> 03:02:08.005]  It's all about getting the word out.
[03:02:08.703 --> 03:02:14.610]  But you see Red McCombs, you guys find that article I saw last week in the newspaper, six million dollars.
[03:02:14.610 --> 03:02:24.302]  Red McCombs, I think the headline was, donors, because it was two of them, McCombs one other, gave six million dollars for the lacrosse and football program of the University North of Austin up in
[03:02:26.127 --> 03:02:28.308]  I've been up there at Georgetown.
[03:02:28.308 --> 03:02:30.089]  What's the name of the university again?
[03:02:30.089 --> 03:02:30.610]  Southwestern.
[03:02:30.610 --> 03:02:31.770]  My memory's not working right now.
[03:02:31.770 --> 03:02:32.551]  I normally would know that.
[03:02:32.551 --> 03:02:33.971]  I have friends that went there.
[03:02:33.971 --> 03:02:35.232]  It's a great school, I'm told.
[03:02:35.232 --> 03:02:37.594]  The point is, $6 million for football.
[03:02:37.594 --> 03:02:49.880]  I can see $6 million for a planetarium to study astronomy, or $6 million for nuclear physics, or $6 million for whatever, or a Second Amendment foundation or something.
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:52.282]  But $6 million for football.
[03:02:52.282 --> 03:02:53.723]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[03:02:54.617 --> 03:03:00.181]  So, in closing, I want to hit our goal of 500,000, because then I could really hire a bunch of people.
[03:03:00.181 --> 03:03:02.843]  You know, reporters, crew, really kick butt.
[03:03:02.843 --> 03:03:04.584]  Have a budget for travel.
[03:03:04.584 --> 03:03:06.225]  That's what really kills us.
[03:03:06.225 --> 03:03:11.489]  But if you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, we've raised over 300,000, and usually more trickles in over the next four or five days.
[03:03:11.489 --> 03:03:13.090]  I think we'll hit 350 or so.
[03:03:13.090 --> 03:03:15.832]  But InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:03:15.832 --> 03:03:18.554]  A comment on donating to worthy causes.
[03:03:18.554 --> 03:03:23.258]  The system's scared of us pooling our money together and actually building an alternative media system, Bob.
[03:03:25.652 --> 03:03:26.372]  And they should be.
[03:03:26.372 --> 03:03:35.394]  The public certainly isn't getting the truth on the mainline media, and they know that.
[03:03:35.394 --> 03:03:40.976]  They want an alternative, and were you able to do that, it certainly would be inviting.
[03:03:40.976 --> 03:03:51.318]  I'm sure it would also bring all kinds of further harassment, and, you know, the way they've attacked the station before.
[03:03:51.318 --> 03:03:54.819]  But they're terrified, and they should be.
[03:03:55.663 --> 03:03:59.360]  Yeah, here it is, Red McCones supporting Everett's to bring football back to Southwestern.
[03:04:00.533 --> 03:04:06.937]  And it's a total of six million dollars for that and lacrosse, women's lacrosse.
[03:04:06.937 --> 03:04:08.718]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:04:08.718 --> 03:04:10.599]  This country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[03:04:10.599 --> 03:04:12.920]  Fifteen million kids are starving to death a year.
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:14.581]  This is obscene.
[03:04:14.581 --> 03:04:16.562]  And it's his money, he can do what he wants with it.
[03:04:16.562 --> 03:04:18.423]  But that's who I'm calling on.
[03:04:18.423 --> 03:04:20.625]  It's the rich people out there.
[03:04:20.625 --> 03:04:22.806]  I mean, I don't understand it.
[03:04:22.806 --> 03:04:25.367]  You're mad about what's happening, but we're the tip of the spear.
[03:04:26.758 --> 03:04:29.659]  You know, I don't see as many big donations this year as we've seen in the past.
[03:04:29.659 --> 03:04:31.600]  I've seen a lot of little ones.
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:39.682]  And quite frankly, I don't like little donations from people that don't have money because then I worry about when I'm spending it that I do it just right and make the right decision.
[03:04:39.682 --> 03:04:47.245]  It's all you rich people out there that need to step up and go to InfoWorksMoneyBomb.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:04:47.245 --> 03:04:51.367]  Paul Watson, I want to commend you and say great job, my friend.
[03:04:51.367 --> 03:04:52.327]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:04:53.655 --> 03:04:58.658]  By the way, I almost forgot to tell you, and we'll just skip this break now because the network's gone off on its own.
[03:04:58.658 --> 03:05:02.619]  And we are going to break.
[03:05:02.619 --> 03:05:04.080]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:09.923]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[03:05:09.923 --> 03:05:13.665]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[03:05:13.665 --> 03:05:18.927]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious, easy to fix,
[03:05:19.707 --> 03:05:22.228]  Call eFoods today at 800-409-5633 or visit them online.

[03:05:48.881 --> 03:05:54.744]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[03:06:13.659 --> 03:06:24.632]  Cats like me and you have got laws that they adhere to.
[03:06:24.632 --> 03:06:28.617]  Laws outside the law house as they down.
[03:06:32.927 --> 03:06:34.348]  Okay, folks.
[03:06:34.348 --> 03:06:41.713]  Again, I meant to end the Money Bomb as we hit the 27th hour, but now internet only, video streams, Infowars.com, audio streams.
[03:06:41.713 --> 03:06:51.138]  We're back for just a few minutes, finishing up with Paul, because I didn't hear music going out, and so we kind of butchered that break, but 27 hours in, you're going to start doing stuff like that.
[03:06:51.138 --> 03:06:56.962]  My point is that the government takes your money, and then
[03:06:58.431 --> 03:07:07.261]  uses it against you, and then as people have less, then they even give less to their own families, or to their church, or their community.
[03:07:07.261 --> 03:07:13.007]  And that's why the globalists want to impoverish society so people don't have money to give it to political or media organizations.
[03:07:13.427 --> 03:07:15.008]  I mean, we're building alternative media.
[03:07:15.008 --> 03:07:26.679]  George Soros gives all these tens of millions to groups like Media Matters who just spew lies and twisted disinformation and other prattle and spittle at us, which is great.
[03:07:26.679 --> 03:07:28.681]  It's a badge of honor.
[03:07:28.681 --> 03:07:35.367]  But again, people like Soros, a lot of that's money he's gotten out of all sorts of global swindles, and he couldn't even overturn his conviction in France.
[03:07:35.367 --> 03:07:36.408]  That came out a few weeks ago.
[03:07:37.589 --> 03:07:38.890]  It's just disgusting.
[03:07:38.890 --> 03:07:41.252]  Shell, that's why we do this, because the system always freaks out.
[03:07:41.252 --> 03:07:45.496]  My gosh, people that are into liberty are selling videos and writing books.
[03:07:45.496 --> 03:07:50.139]  Oh my gosh, don't educate people politically while funding yourself.
[03:07:50.139 --> 03:07:50.940]  That's dirty.
[03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:57.525]  It's only good to take money at gunpoint as government and give it to the MSNBC to spew anti-gun garbage.
[03:07:57.525 --> 03:07:59.327]  I can tell you we're having a national effect.
[03:07:59.327 --> 03:08:00.468]  We're having a global effect.
[03:08:01.323 --> 03:08:03.626]  We're having a bigger and bigger effect all the time.
[03:08:03.626 --> 03:08:04.887]  In fact, it's scary.
[03:08:04.887 --> 03:08:07.990]  And I know we have a responsibility to go to the next level.
[03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:11.494]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:08:11.494 --> 03:08:15.078]  Because, man, I tell you, they're like, this person really wants to talk to you.
[03:08:15.078 --> 03:08:16.520]  And I got on the phone with some really nice lady.
[03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:21.782]  And then I have the idea, oh my gosh, the Red McCombs thing, I forgot to make that point.
[03:08:21.782 --> 03:08:25.024]  And so I run back in and say, put me back on, right as the main show's ending.
[03:08:25.024 --> 03:08:28.747]  Put me back on, because I meant to cover this the entire time.
[03:08:28.747 --> 03:08:30.548]  This was going to be my pitch.
[03:08:30.548 --> 03:08:32.689]  My pitch is always what I believe in the truth.
[03:08:32.689 --> 03:08:38.273]  I mean, I was going to get a bunch of examples of people giving, I've seen $10 million gifts to football programs.
[03:08:38.273 --> 03:08:40.574]  And here it is, I mean, Red McCombs, $6 million.
[03:08:40.574 --> 03:08:41.635]  I mean, it's just un...
[03:08:42.695 --> 03:08:44.616]  Unbelievable!
[03:08:44.616 --> 03:08:45.796]  But that's his money.
[03:08:45.796 --> 03:08:47.317]  He can do what he wants with it.
[03:08:47.317 --> 03:08:49.818]  I have First Amendment right to say that's ridiculous.
[03:08:49.818 --> 03:08:53.860]  That's why football makes me sick and sports where it's the God.
[03:08:53.860 --> 03:08:55.881]  I'll tell you this.
[03:08:55.881 --> 03:09:07.706]  If I had six million dollars to give away, I would create my own Second Amendment Foundation that did things like educate and would also try to fundraise so you can keep doing it and that would sue government when it violates people's rights.
[03:09:08.772 --> 03:09:09.052]  I don't
[03:09:33.542 --> 03:09:34.683]  That's a lot of money.
[03:09:34.683 --> 03:09:37.184]  So we talk about trying to raise a half million.
[03:09:37.184 --> 03:09:50.310]  It takes a lot to have 30 employees and contractors and $50,000, $60,000 IT bills just for bandwidth a month and $16,000 rent and all the equipment and all the garbage.
[03:09:50.310 --> 03:09:56.893]  And then we fly in the system, even though we know the Federal Reserve is a fraud, the IRS is their collection agency, I pay the stinking taxes.
[03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:59.212]  And boy, do we pay them.
[03:09:59.212 --> 03:10:01.154]  Because people are like, well then, it's going to that.
[03:10:01.154 --> 03:10:04.058]  Well, I mean, we buy equipment and gotta pay taxes on it.
[03:10:04.058 --> 03:10:06.080]  It's pure bull.
[03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:07.422]  And so, um...
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:13.703]  We have these money bombs that can go right to those employees and they're nailed down for the year.
[03:10:13.703 --> 03:10:15.865]  It can go right to the equipment we need.
[03:10:15.865 --> 03:10:17.546]  And it's just so great.
[03:10:17.546 --> 03:10:19.127]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:10:19.127 --> 03:10:22.750]  Paul, I want you to close it out here for three or four minutes.
[03:10:22.750 --> 03:10:26.552]  I'm going to say sayonara to everybody, but comment on what I've just talked about and what I've said.
[03:10:26.552 --> 03:10:30.895]  I mean, it's because people don't see themselves as active participants fighting tyranny.
[03:10:31.716 --> 03:10:34.697]  And it's somebody else's job, that's why we've gotten in this position.
[03:10:34.697 --> 03:10:39.458]  I know why we went into even super overdrive here, 27 plus hours now.
[03:10:39.458 --> 03:10:45.740]  Ventura, the other big facet is, Ventura was not allowed to see the ruling, it was told national security.
[03:10:45.740 --> 03:10:51.041]  So now, you have the same jury system in England, so this is where the common law came from, 12-15.
[03:10:54.363 --> 03:11:02.591]  Paul, you know, they told him and his lawyer, you can't see it, it's national security, and you don't even get to have a jury trial in America over the Fourth Amendment.
[03:11:02.591 --> 03:11:03.892]  I mean, that is martial law.
[03:11:03.892 --> 03:11:04.953]  That is star chamber.
[03:11:04.953 --> 03:11:06.675]  That is unbelievable.
[03:11:06.675 --> 03:11:09.177]  So that's going to be a powerful article you're going to get out.
[03:11:09.177 --> 03:11:10.358]  And great job, my friend.
[03:11:10.358 --> 03:11:14.863]  But what's your view on the money bomb and being with now almost, what is it, 10 years now?
[03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:17.846]  It is 10 years that you've been in the info war, my friend.
[03:11:19.795 --> 03:11:24.903]  Well, back in 2005, you remember, we visited when you were at the old studio.
[03:11:24.903 --> 03:11:32.153]  And even back then, I mean, we were hard-working and focused and we were having an impact, but it was literally...
[03:11:33.601 --> 03:11:37.284]  What, five or six people, employees?
[03:11:37.284 --> 03:11:44.769]  Now it's like, it's grown so much just over the course of the past six or seven years, and that's because people have supported us.
[03:11:44.769 --> 03:11:52.854]  And that's why Infowars.com gets more traffic than MSNBC.com, because everything that our supporters have poured into it
[03:11:53.695 --> 03:11:57.738]  We've, in turn, poured back into the information war.
[03:11:57.738 --> 03:12:01.700]  That's why Hillary Clinton says that they're losing the information war.
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:05.402]  You're right, and then meanwhile, Paul, and then I am punching out and letting you finish.
[03:12:05.402 --> 03:12:07.704]  Feds worried hackers can open prison doors.
[03:12:07.704 --> 03:12:08.784]  They want to pass cyber security.
[03:12:08.784 --> 03:12:09.625]  That's made up.
[03:12:09.625 --> 03:12:13.087]  Terrorist scare at post office after light bulb pops.
[03:12:13.087 --> 03:12:16.669]  It's the nation of ninnying cowards running from their own shadow.
[03:12:16.669 --> 03:12:18.470]  So I need to get Steve to write about that.
[03:12:18.470 --> 03:12:20.332]  Suspicious package contained cookies.
[03:12:21.632 --> 03:12:28.796]  I mean, just absolute, absolute, just the wicked flee when none pursue.
[03:12:28.796 --> 03:12:29.316]  I'm done.
[03:12:29.316 --> 03:12:30.317]  Plugged the money bomb.
[03:12:30.317 --> 03:12:31.057]  God bless you, Paul.
[03:12:31.057 --> 03:12:31.537]  Great job.
[03:12:31.537 --> 03:12:32.738]  God bless the whole crew.
[03:12:32.738 --> 03:12:33.818]  I'm out of here.
[03:12:33.818 --> 03:12:35.219]  I'm now going to stop.
[03:12:35.219 --> 03:12:36.059]  I am leaving the building.
[03:12:36.059 --> 03:12:36.980]  God bless you all.
[03:12:36.980 --> 03:12:38.280]  Thank you for the support.
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:40.582]  Don't give us money if you don't have money.
[03:12:40.582 --> 03:12:46.064]  It's time for all the middle class and wealthy fat cats that claim they love liberty to step up at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:12:46.064 --> 03:12:46.765]  Okay, sayonara.
[03:12:46.765 --> 03:12:47.285]  Good job, Paul.
[03:12:48.729 --> 03:12:50.310]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:12:50.310 --> 03:12:58.834]  Yeah, so we're going to leave the Money Bomb links up over the weekend on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as we did last time.
[03:12:58.834 --> 03:13:09.839]  So again, we're not calling on people who are struggling to pay the bills and live in paycheck to paycheck, we're calling on people who have got disposable income to give and who want to donate
[03:13:10.359 --> 03:13:10.779]  I don't know.
[03:13:27.913 --> 03:13:40.499]  You know, they try to focus on charities that they know and organisations that they know will do good work and that's where their money goes and so that's why we appeal to people to support InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:13:40.499 --> 03:13:45.001]  As I said, we're not funded by billionaire philanthropists.
[03:13:45.001 --> 03:13:47.702]  George Soros doesn't hand us five million dollars.
[03:13:48.942 --> 03:13:49.383]  Dispute
[03:14:09.625 --> 03:14:29.564]  Give us that firepower where we can strike back and we can rise above and we already are rising above because we're defeating all of them in terms of traffic, we're defeating them in terms of activism and grassroots people really getting out there and having an impact rather than constant backbiting and infighting with each other.
[03:14:29.564 --> 03:14:32.687]  We're actually trying to get the issues on the front burner of
[03:14:33.047 --> 03:14:54.987]  The National Agenda and of course that's exemplified no better than with the presidential campaign of Congressman Ron Paul which is basically now what we're a platform for in the political sense going forward into 2012 because there are going to be many more attacks against Congressman Paul and they're going to try and derail his momentum as a top
[03:14:55.367 --> 03:15:18.004]  TIA candidate as he is right now and so we're going to be fully committed to that fight in the InfoWars which according to none other than Hillary Clinton we're winning and they're losing so we're going to roll out now with some music as I said InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com links are going to be kept up over the weekend and please support us
[03:15:18.684 --> 03:15:20.085]  Obviously, keep up with the website.
[03:15:20.085 --> 03:15:25.387]  It's got breaking news coming up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:15:25.387 --> 03:15:34.410]  So, we're going to sign off now on this 27-hour, 15-minute marathon with InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:15:34.410 --> 03:15:36.091]  Restreams are coming up.
[03:15:36.091 --> 03:15:40.752]  Alex will be back 4 to 6 for the Sunday Show and we'll all be back next week.
[03:15:40.752 --> 03:15:42.493]  Stay tuned to the websites over the weekend.
[03:15:42.493 --> 03:15:43.613]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:15:45.134 --> 03:15:51.758]  Keep checking the websites and everybody take care and please support us at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:15:51.758 --> 03:15:52.158]  Goodbye.
