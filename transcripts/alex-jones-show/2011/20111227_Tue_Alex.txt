[00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.590]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:08.311]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:10.171]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:13.352]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:17.513]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:22.214]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:38.443]  It is Tuesday, the 27th day of December 2011.
[00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:50.547]  Obviously throughout the week I'm going to produce some special reports for the radio and TV dealing with 2011, a year in review, and looking forward into the big 2012 that's only a few days away.
[00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:07.766]  And as you notice, as we prepare to enter 2012, there is intensifying reportage by the establishment mouthpiece media that a strike on Iran is imminent.
[00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:09.227]  We're going to be going over that today.
[00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:18.734]  Also, there's a big whitewash article in the Los Angeles Times announcing to the general public what we've known for over nine years.
[00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:25.390]  The TSA is going to occupy every city and every major highway and there is no escaping.
[00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.933]  They are going to grab your wife's breasts and your children's genitals and your genitals in an act of total federal domination and prisoner training.
[00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:34.054]  Here's the Los Angeles Times.
[00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:37.235]  TSA screeners aren't just for airports anymore.
[00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:47.640]  Roving security teams, that's martial law, federal teams, that's what that is, increasingly visit train stations, subways and other mass transit sites to deter terrorism.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.922]  Critics say it's largely political theater.
[00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:51.142]  No.
[00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:52.724]  Critics say it's groping.
[00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.548]  Critics say it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment.
[00:01:56.928 --> 00:01:58.570]  Critics say it's martial law.
[00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:06.579]  Critics who have a pulse and have brain cells know that it is theater and that it's not to protect you from terrorists.
[00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:21.446]  You don't randomly say, let's just have federal police go set up on this highway and pull people out of their cars and search their vehicles and then search their bags and then give them frisk.
[00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:33.827]  While they have less searches going on at the ports and the containers coming in and less border patrol actually engaging in action on the border.
[00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:42.076]  And the government saying legalize all the illegals including felons but anybody that criticizes
[00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:56.836]  You know, the open borders is an extremist, but we've got to set up random checkpoints in the middle of Tennessee, in the middle of Michigan, in the middle of Florida, in the middle of California, in the middle of Colorado, and you pull up to these.
[00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:58.737]  There's newscasts of this.
[00:02:58.797 --> 00:02:59.598]  We played them.
[00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.660]  They've been beta testing for at least five years.
[00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:09.897]  And even as it would happen, we'd show people local news and still, Jones is an extremist, National News reported.
[00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:16.243]  He believes that there's a plan to put troops on the streets and Federal TSA, he's a lunatic!
[00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:25.491]  In fact, just last week, more than 200 news articles in newspapers, CBS, ABC, you name it,
[00:03:26.454 --> 00:03:28.776]  Saying Ron Paul is nuts.
[00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:34.220]  He goes on Alex Jones' show and they talk about plans to put troops on the streets.
[00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:41.406]  As Stars and Stripes, as the major newspapers, Army Times, report it.
[00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:42.807]  As local news reports it.
[00:03:43.127 --> 00:03:44.408]  I mean local news, we can play them.
[00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:49.072]  The local preachers have secretly been trained to tell their flock to turn their guns in when the time comes.
[00:03:49.432 --> 00:03:52.475]  Red alert, totally creepy, off the chart, red dawn.
[00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:56.274]  And then it's like, look at these lunatics.
[00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:57.817]  They're worried about a plan to do this.
[00:03:58.498 --> 00:04:00.081]  And now it's all being announced.
[00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:03.287]  Oh, it's just political theater to make you feel like you're safe.
[00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:04.589]  No, it's not to make you feel like you're safe.
[00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.353]  It's to make you feel scared.
[00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.548]  And to have the local police go under federal control.
[00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:34.148]  I've seen the newscast from all over the country, and I've had state reps on from Florida, Tennessee, you name it, who've been out at these things, because sometimes they go all day long, and you pull up and there's state police out there, in many cases in Marine Corps hats, in their drill sergeant hats, bugging their eyes out, scaring the daylights out of people, and guys with MP5 submachine guns and police dogs screaming at people and getting in their face.
[00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:36.690]  It's total criminal evil.
[00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:39.689]  And it has nothing to do with protecting this nation.
[00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.489]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:41.890]  The Iran situation.
[00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.211]  The total demonization of Ron Paul.
[00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.232]  Gerald Salente popping in.
[00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.872]  Hadn't been on with us in about two and a half weeks.
[00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:51.034]  To give us an update on MF Global and how that ties into everything.
[00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:54.535]  That incredible footage a few weeks ago.
[00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.136]  We haven't gotten Gerald's response to this.
[00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.057]  Where Corzine gets caught lying.
[00:04:58.117 --> 00:04:58.957]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:59.037 --> 00:05:00.278]  And your phone calls stay with us.
[00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:05.449]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:06.369]  Number one.
[00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.831]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:10.672]  Number two.
[00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:15.515]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:16.296]  It's true.
[00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:21.159]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:22.019]  Number three.
[00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:25.581]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:29.564]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.784 --> 00:05:30.325]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:32.947]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:33.327 --> 00:05:36.731]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:37.231]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:41.735]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:46.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.022]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:52.743]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:55.045]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:57.546]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:06.519]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:14.961]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:19.742]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:31.144]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:31.784 --> 00:06:40.787]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:46.349]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:53.892]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:56.973]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:07:02.108 --> 00:07:05.712]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:09.136]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:14.161]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:20.388]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:20.568 --> 00:07:22.811]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:23.771]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:24.071]  Bernanke?
[00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:24.751]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.032]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:26.052 --> 00:07:28.332]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:44.078]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:49.202]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:59.430]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:06.516]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:09.139]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:19.618]  Here we are, my friends.
[00:08:19.698 --> 00:08:25.121]  It feels like a Monday, but it's a Tuesday, the 27th day of December 2011.
[00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:35.168]  And I'm going to open the phones up throughout the three-hour broadcast, except when Gerald Salente is on with us for 30 minutes.
[00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:38.110]  At the bottom of the next hour.
[00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.712]  We haven't had Gerald Celente on in about two and a half, three weeks.
[00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:50.077]  And I want to go back to the testimony a week and a half ago of the head of MF Global, John Corzine, saying he didn't know where the money went.
[00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:58.282]  And then the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange saying, no, we talked to his people.
[00:08:58.323 --> 00:08:59.643]  We talked to his top staff.
[00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:03.466]  He's the one that ordered the money transferred illegally.
[00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:09.781]  So, we're now a couple weeks into this, and Corzine was not instantly clapped in irons.
[00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:17.308]  And that's because all the different heads of the federal agencies... All the different heads of the federal agencies...
[00:09:19.682 --> 00:09:27.426]  Are former Goldman Sachs, and what, three of them are former deputies of John Corzine himself, who was the head of Goldman Sachs.
[00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:38.132]  So, it's his deputies, they've all gotten tens of millions of dollars out of the financial destruction of our republic, and they think it's real funny.
[00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:47.437]  And you see, Paulson, who gave himself a waiver to give himself hundreds of millions of dollars of your bailout money, of your tax money, who was the former head of Goldman Sachs himself,
[00:09:48.757 --> 00:10:03.601]  Also the head of the Treasury four years ago with the 2008 mega banker takeover bailout that launched this latest destruction of our currency and deepening of our debt to these criminals.
[00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:07.062]  What he did was publicly illegal.
[00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:10.756]  On the face of it, but he gave himself a waiver.
[00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:21.480]  So at this point, can these guys give themselves a waiver to, I don't know, grab babies out of baby carriages and give them cement shoes and throw them into the ocean?
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:28.023]  I mean, after all, they've put all their people over the different federal agencies, so why not?
[00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:34.025]  And they worked hard to get their people in all the major regulatory agencies in every major European country.
[00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:36.007]  Every post!
[00:10:36.447 --> 00:10:48.833]  Now they have the power to force Berlusconi to step down, to have their old minion in Greece step down, and they put in new former heads of European Goldman Sachs divisions, and former heads of the European...
[00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:50.381]  Central Bank.
[00:10:50.842 --> 00:11:04.329]  I mean, it's a small corporate takeover group that lobbied to put politicians into power, who then put their other people into all the other major positions, and now they've recruited even more of their people in.
[00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.951]  We're probably, I don't know, in the U.S.
[00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:10.293]  almost a hundred years into this with the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:11.994]  Europe's a couple hundred years into this.
[00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:41.162]  And so it's total gangster government, run by the bankster gangsters, imploding the world economy, funding fake environmental groups to create corporate collectivism to shut down all of their competition and only allow them to operate, while they fund all the nanotech and GMO companies that are publicly destroying the Earth's actual genetic code and irrevocably damaging human DNA, which on record is mutating quickly.
[00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:45.706]  Because of the mercury in the shots and the dioxins in the food.
[00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:47.186]  But none of that's an issue.
[00:11:47.206 --> 00:12:02.311]  You're not going to hear word one from the major environmental groups because they're all on record founded and funded by the Rockefellers, the Gothas of England, the Gothas of the Netherlands, the Rothschilds of England.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.040]  Every stinking one of them.
[00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:10.562]  You know what Henry Paulson did with the hundreds of millions of dollars, 200-something mil he gave himself?
[00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:16.063]  He gave, you can go look this up, most of it to environmental groups.
[00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:21.145]  That's his tithe to their religion.
[00:12:21.865 --> 00:12:24.726]  Their anti-human religion of shutting down human activity.
[00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:26.146]  Nothing to do with the earth.
[00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:29.187]  Alright, I'm already ranting.
[00:12:29.427 --> 00:12:30.007]  Here's the deal.
[00:12:30.087 --> 00:12:32.428]  I've told myself in the new year it is a
[00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:42.895]  Resolution, and I told myself this a month and a half ago, that I was going to lose 60 pounds, and I've lost 21.
[00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:49.638]  And my plan was to just by this time next year, lose the 60 pounds.
[00:12:49.698 --> 00:12:50.758]  I'm already 20 pounds there.
[00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:52.679]  It's easy for me to lose 20 pounds.
[00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.000]  I've got to go all the way to 60.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.560]  I'm going to go down to 180 pounds.
[00:12:58.285 --> 00:12:59.726]  And I'm well on my way, and I'm going to do it.
[00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:02.167]  Running twice a day is the main key.
[00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:03.828]  But that's a side issue.
[00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:13.212]  The other big resolution is to simplify and categorize everything I do.
[00:13:14.813 --> 00:13:23.879]  And so on the radio show, and on the nightly news show, I am going to continue to cover complex issues and continue to cover little side issues that are part of the larger system.
[00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:30.102]  For people that really tune in and study deeply, it's key that we all grow together with a deeper understanding.
[00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:37.247]  But also for the general public, it's important to come out, basically, with the handbook of the New World Order in different video reports.
[00:13:37.987 --> 00:13:54.201]  That have all the documents in them on every major subject so people understand the globalist main philosophy, they understand their greatest systems of control, they understand how the global finance system works, how the GMO takeover works, why the globalists are playing God.
[00:13:54.221 --> 00:14:03.710]  I need to really get this stuff on record because the only fear I have of being imprisoned or killed or set up
[00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:07.195]  Which, thanks to your prayers, hasn't happened, but certainly could.
[00:14:07.215 --> 00:14:09.556]  I mean, make no mistake, we're at the very tip of the spear now.
[00:14:09.876 --> 00:14:11.897]  We are reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:17.301]  We are growing exponentially, and we are definitely on the globalist radar screen in a big way.
[00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:23.059]  And so, I have no fear except for really laying it all out.
[00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:24.360]  And I've done a lot of that in the films.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.242]  But I need to do it in, say, 20 reports.
[00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:28.664]  Might be 30 reports.
[00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:31.507]  I mean, there's a lot of things I've got to categorize and set up.
[00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:35.791]  And instead of just writing a book that limited people read, making film books.
[00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:40.133]  That's really what my special reports have been over the years before I started The Nightly News.
[00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:44.635]  Those little 10-15 minute reports that would be watched millions of times a piece in many cases.
[00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:46.456]  We put them out for free on YouTube.
[00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:51.178]  I want to codify every subject and then once they're all
[00:14:52.904 --> 00:14:53.925]  We're good to go.
[00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:12.917]  I've got a goal to start a newspaper nationwide that is printed locally in your town, distributed by Patriots.
[00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:15.739]  Half of it's national news, the other half's your local news.
[00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:18.820]  I guarantee it'll succeed like gangbusters.
[00:15:19.081 --> 00:15:25.564]  Everything's going high-tech, we go low-tech, while hitting them at the same time high-tech, and the latest systems there, hit them with the low-tech.
[00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:30.849]  I've got the goal, because I'm always trying to finish other things I'm doing, to finally launch the social network.
[00:15:30.869 --> 00:15:32.150]  Because I want to launch it right.
[00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.053]  We've launched one before that got, you know, 30,000 members in crash.
[00:15:35.113 --> 00:15:37.355]  And, you know, because it was just an off-the-shelf system.
[00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:38.737]  That's pretty much done.
[00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:41.059]  We've just got to get the personnel then in to run it.
[00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.861]  And then it's a finance issue.
[00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:43.802]  We've got that coming up.
[00:15:43.822 --> 00:15:47.806]  I'm just giving you kind of a quick state-of-the-info-war report here.
[00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:52.608]  But another big one I've got is to cover the news.
[00:15:52.808 --> 00:16:02.490]  Because I stay up all night, I get up at 5 a.m., I read all this news, then I just get upset and angry, and I come in here and maybe hit 20% of the news in three hours.
[00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.752]  Don't hit it in enough depth because I end up just going to guests or spinning out or ranting on one issue.
[00:16:10.132 --> 00:16:18.554]  Because it is exhausting to actually pick up this article and give you a real analysis of it and go into all those connections and information and integrate it and put it out.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:26.691]  I mean, a lot of times, Mike Adams was here a few weeks ago to do the nightly news, and he wanted to have a meeting with me about some issues, about some news issues we're working on.
[00:16:27.552 --> 00:16:33.941]  He was sitting in here, right in here in this office, in this studio, right there, and he's like, well, I'm sorry, I'm bugging you.
[00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:35.704]  And I'm like, no, Mike, I invited you here.
[00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:40.215]  But I was totally out of it and yawning the entire time.
[00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:44.437]  And then I've always intended to call Mike and apologize to him and never done it.
[00:16:44.457 --> 00:16:45.298]  So I'll just do it here on air.
[00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:50.000]  And then he was patting me on the back when he was here, you know, going over news and stuff.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.661]  He was saying, well, thanks for having me out.
[00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:57.363]  I hope I'm not bugging you because I was being rude in that I was so exhausted.
[00:16:57.444 --> 00:17:01.385]  I was trying to actually pay attention to him and listen to him.
[00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.387]  I had invited him here, but I couldn't do it.
[00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:17.435]  And so that's another reason I've got to get in absolute shape and get the best nutrients and operate at the highest capacity because I can't just do this off adrenaline.
[00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:30.623]  I can't just do a three hour show and then prepare for two or three hours of more research with the guys and do a nightly news every night without getting myself completely mentally and spiritually and physically a hundred percent.
[00:17:31.553 --> 00:17:35.194]  Because by the time I get home at seven or eight o'clock at night, I mean, I'm like a zombie.
[00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:36.774]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:17:37.735 --> 00:17:43.696]  But now that I've been exercising and eating right a lot better, I've suddenly actually had the energy to do it.
[00:17:44.157 --> 00:17:44.717]  It's good.
[00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:54.339]  So pray for me to stay on track here, folks, and to really try to be disciplined like somebody like Ron Paul and to, you know, take care of myself fully.
[00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:56.460]  I mean, one big issue I discovered
[00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:01.572]  Is that over the years I might drink two glasses of water a day.
[00:18:01.792 --> 00:18:02.833]  You've got to have at least eight.
[00:18:03.613 --> 00:18:05.914]  And I was dehydrated for years.
[00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:08.435]  And irritable and crazy because of it.
[00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:13.497]  Now I'm making myself and I'm asking the crew most days to drink the eight glasses of water.
[00:18:13.897 --> 00:18:22.780]  But yet over the weekend I didn't do that and I remembered it and started doing it again and felt that incredible energy and understanding and my old near photographic memory came back.
[00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:26.546]  So, point is, I'm trying to take it to the next level.
[00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:29.467]  And lastly, and let's see if this goal can be attained now.
[00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:34.028]  I'm not going to cover mainstream news announcing TSA to take over the streets of America.
[00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:35.368]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:45.111]  I'm not going to get into the giant stack of World War III being basically escalated into some incredible realms.
[00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:51.593]  Or the communist Chinese confiscating people's property and land and trying to take their children if you have more than two children.
[00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:54.016]  Now that's the model here in the U.S.
[00:18:54.876 --> 00:19:05.923]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, every major GMO crop does this.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:16.789]  And I've talked to top scientists on air who come to their people and say, this is sterilizing all the mice and we've got to not have this go on the market.
[00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:18.190]  And they say, shut up, that's part of the plan.
[00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:21.497]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:19:21.537 --> 00:19:22.758]  But I'm not getting to all that.
[00:19:23.699 --> 00:19:24.940]  I'm going to discipline myself.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.800]  I'm going to do it.
[00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:34.046]  And I'm going to take your phone calls, because I love hearing what you have to say, the news items you raise, the issues you bring up, the questions, the comments you have.
[00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:35.307]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:19:35.628 --> 00:19:37.409]  Nothing but your calls for the rest of this hour.
[00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:42.913]  Then, at the 8 after, at the second segment next hour, I'm going to blitz news.
[00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:46.916]  And then I got Gerald Cilente on, and I'm going to continue with news and your calls in the third hour.
[00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:48.638]  And the news is all coming up.
[00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:51.652]  But first, I'm going to take your call straight ahead.

[00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:40.975]  This capitalism?
[00:20:41.035 --> 00:20:47.179]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:48.120]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.262]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:22:06.788 --> 00:22:15.232]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:15.672 --> 00:22:18.853]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:19.994]  But take heart.
[00:22:20.154 --> 00:22:23.675]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:23.956 --> 00:22:28.918]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:29.338 --> 00:22:32.899]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:34.620]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.900]  They've overreached.
[00:22:36.241 --> 00:22:39.402]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:24:16.318 --> 00:24:18.460]  Watch the tyrants become gods.
[00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:22.683]  Watch him become a god.
[00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:25.345]  Watch the heads roll.
[00:24:27.086 --> 00:24:29.228]  Watch people's heads all roll.
[00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:31.270]  The poet Dave Mustaine.
[00:24:36.534 --> 00:24:37.494]  Countdown to Extinction.
[00:24:37.534 --> 00:24:38.715]  I was listening to that this morning.
[00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:40.436]  That is a good song right there.
[00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:43.017]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:46.198]  You know, I agree with Dave, too, man.
[00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:50.520]  Canned hunts, where people love to kill almost extinct animals.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:25:02.024]  I've seen videos of these on YouTube, where people go out to these ranches or whatever, and they'll, like, release birds or whatever right out of containers, or animals.
[00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:05.826]  Some people go up to the cage and shoot the animal in the cage and then have a trophy put up.
[00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:08.091]  I don't know, it's pretty crazy.
[00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:17.867]  Okay, uh, let's go ahead and it's one thing if you like to hunt with a bow or something and then you actually go and process it or butcher it yourself and eat it, that's great.
[00:25:18.885 --> 00:25:24.146]  But let's go ahead and go to John Illinois, then Mark, Bobby, Nick, and others.
[00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:25.446]  You're on the air, John.
[00:25:25.466 --> 00:25:27.226]  Hi, Alex.
[00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:30.847]  I appreciate your show and have been a listener for several years.
[00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:34.488]  You know, and I struggle with some of the same things you struggle with.
[00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:38.688]  I mean, people not wanting to be informed and knowing truth.
[00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:44.809]  And I appreciate the vast array of different sources that you bring to the table.
[00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.010]  I do have one question, though, in regards to
[00:25:49.158 --> 00:25:54.821]  You know, how do you prevent yourself from being played?
[00:25:54.841 --> 00:26:03.765]  As an example, I know your guest Robert Chapman has said that he expected gold to be over $2500 at the end of this year.
[00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:10.794]  You know, because I think it was Goldman Sachs was saying, you know, we're going over $2,500.
[00:26:10.854 --> 00:26:14.075]  They expected it to be at $2,500.
[00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:18.576]  So Mr. Chapman said he expected it to be higher, as a matter of fact.
[00:26:19.756 --> 00:26:26.197]  Because if they're saying $2,500, you can say that they're just afraid that they're trying to suppress it.
[00:26:26.937 --> 00:26:28.798]  And obviously at today's price of around $1,600,
[00:26:31.118 --> 00:26:33.120]  Well, John, I mean, let's be clear here.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.922]  It's not being played.
[00:26:37.343 --> 00:26:44.408]  I mean, if you look at a 12-year gold graph, it was 260 12 years ago, and it's gone right up to 2,000.
[00:26:44.948 --> 00:26:52.554]  And then the globalists have done desperate things, destroying their own commodities market, raising the margin.
[00:26:53.447 --> 00:27:13.079]  Where there basically is almost no speculation now, and they've got tens of tons of gold, and JP Morgan, I guess that was a sucker punch, because normally, when they come out with an analysis, it's right, because they're at the top of the heap, even above Goldman Sachs, and that's what most analysts believe, was 2,500 or higher, and Bob, I'd say Bob's right about 95% of the time.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.563]  And, uh, but they just kept, and then MF Global has hurt the gold market.
[00:27:19.023 --> 00:27:33.694]  I mean, they've never in the 150 plus years of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME Group, ever allowed people to take private sequestered accounts, uh, you know, private segregated accounts, and keep it.
[00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:38.898]  Uh, and then have a guy lie and say, I don't know where it went, as if the Feds don't know where that money was wired to.
[00:27:38.938 --> 00:27:42.401]  It was wired to London, and they know which banks it was wired to.
[00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:43.602]  JP Morgan's one of the big ones.
[00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:48.270]  And there's a 12-year graph, so we have it on screen.
[00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.631]  There is a 12...
[00:27:51.158 --> 00:27:52.419]  Oh, that's a 35-year graph.
[00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:53.340]  Yeah, I asked for a 12-year.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.281]  They gave me a 25-year.
[00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:55.582]  I mean, that's gold.
[00:27:56.202 --> 00:28:02.348]  And if you look at the last 12 years there, from, you know, 2009 up until now, it's going straight up.
[00:28:02.688 --> 00:28:08.413]  And so that little dip you see there is pretty much nothing when you put a 12-year graph in.
[00:28:08.433 --> 00:28:10.835]  So, listen, I've always said this.
[00:28:10.895 --> 00:28:13.057]  What we say here is what I would do personally.
[00:28:13.457 --> 00:28:14.338]  I'm not telling you.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:23.482]  That firearms are a great thing, even though I said they're only going to go up in value, and now Wall Street Journal had the headline last week, Guns and Ammo, the New Gold.
[00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:24.443]  In fact, show people that.
[00:28:24.843 --> 00:28:25.923]  Guns and Ammo, the New Gold.
[00:28:26.003 --> 00:28:27.384]  Click News, I think it was Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:29.344]  I know it was Wall Street Journal, but maybe another one too.
[00:28:29.704 --> 00:28:33.525]  Saw a couple saying that, different ways, different slight variants of the headline.
[00:28:36.112 --> 00:28:41.475]  Again, I said guns, ammo, storable food, gold, silver, they've been the best investments.
[00:28:41.715 --> 00:28:49.920]  Within a year, it's gone up and down several times because the system is doing everything it can to knock it down because it exposes paper currency.
[00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:54.503]  But as global paper currency gets devalued, they can't hold it down forever.
[00:28:54.843 --> 00:29:00.006]  So, I haven't sold gold that I bought at $260, and I haven't sold silver I bought at $5 an ounce.
[00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:05.929]  Not when silver hit $49, not when gold hit $1,900 and something.
[00:29:06.449 --> 00:29:07.950]  So that's what I believe.
[00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:16.954]  Playing you would be if I thought gold and silver was a bad investment and then I got up here and I said get it and then and and
[00:29:17.234 --> 00:29:21.796]  Then it came out later that I thought that was a bad idea, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
[00:29:21.816 --> 00:29:39.423]  Remember last year, John, or two years ago, that the JPMorgan emails came out from Timberwolf, where they were selling their customers stock, housing stocks, housing commodities that they thought were horrible, but then
[00:29:40.717 --> 00:29:43.721]  They were telling the people it was a good thing to buy, unloading garbage.
[00:29:44.101 --> 00:29:45.563]  That was being played.
[00:29:45.844 --> 00:29:49.148]  John, I want you to be able to come back, counter what I said, then others, stay with us.
[00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.531]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.032 --> 00:29:53.634]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.555 --> 00:29:57.239]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.501]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:07.883]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:08.124 --> 00:30:12.766]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:13.546]  It's true.
[00:30:13.606 --> 00:30:16.188]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:30:16.428 --> 00:30:18.169]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:18.709 --> 00:30:23.412]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.933 --> 00:30:25.854]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:30:26.254 --> 00:30:30.858]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:31.058 --> 00:30:31.958]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:32.178 --> 00:30:34.940]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:38.523]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.843 --> 00:30:41.685]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:43.926]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:44.246 --> 00:30:45.027]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:45.047 --> 00:30:45.307]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:45.347 --> 00:30:48.349]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:50.610]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.896 --> 00:31:02.137]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:02.497 --> 00:31:08.319]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:05.768]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:06.128 --> 00:32:09.810]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.272]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:17.716]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:18.156 --> 00:32:24.420]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:30.384]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.804 --> 00:32:34.467]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:38.949]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:44.752]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:45.193 --> 00:32:48.174]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.754 --> 00:32:50.175]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:51.216]  It's here.
[00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:58.660]  Secure your copy today at Infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:17.003]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.052 --> 00:33:26.001]  Now this is the problem with taking calls, because they'll ask complex, serious, piercing questions that need to be answered in detail.
[00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:28.784]  But again, no investments are bulletproof.
[00:33:29.284 --> 00:33:32.868]  None of them are silver bullets, as I've said about silver, a pun intended.
[00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:35.190]  But it's the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:38.918]  If you're some insider, well then stocks and bonds are great.
[00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:50.025]  But again, being played is like what JP Morgan's division of Timberwolf did, selling housing stocks that Congress then got the emails on.
[00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:54.729]  They said, we're selling total bleeping you know what to our customers.
[00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:56.710]  Ah ha ha, they're idiots.
[00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.691]  Ah ha ha.
[00:33:58.351 --> 00:34:01.693]  Here, I'm saying gold and silver, wherever you buy it.
[00:34:02.294 --> 00:34:05.156]  And if you're going to buy gold and silver, Midas Resources has great deals.
[00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:09.638]  Ted Anderson thinks they've hit the bottom with it going down a couple hundred bucks.
[00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:13.980]  But that's because the world is in a depression.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.561]  The head of the IMF now admits that.
[00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:20.503]  Again, being played is the mainstream media that's not really the mainstream.
[00:34:20.523 --> 00:34:23.885]  The folks that pose as the mainstream
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:41.654]  Getting up there and saying unemployment's at 8.9 and inflation's at 6% when every other private respected group that advises the Fortune 500 like John Williams, Shadow Stats, and the rest of it use the old way the government broke it down.
[00:34:42.034 --> 00:34:44.776]  Unemployment's at 22 or more depending on what state you're in.
[00:34:44.996 --> 00:34:47.599]  California's above 30 because of their carbon tax laws.
[00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.101]  By the way, California knows what it's doing.
[00:34:50.161 --> 00:34:51.362]  They want to bankrupt people.
[00:34:51.562 --> 00:34:52.523]  It's all about control.
[00:34:53.903 --> 00:34:59.631]  And then expanding on that, you've got inflation well above 11%.
[00:35:01.215 --> 00:35:04.758]  So, the so-called mainstream media are paid deceivers.
[00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:08.081]  In fact, they'll take a lot of true news, but spin it.
[00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:13.145]  Oh look, the TSA screenings aren't just for airports anymore, LA Times reports.
[00:35:13.625 --> 00:35:14.766]  They're gonna be everywhere.
[00:35:14.886 --> 00:35:17.488]  They've been everywhere for five, almost six years.
[00:35:18.189 --> 00:35:23.673]  It's been a public plan where to have a job, you're gonna be federally certified as a citizen.
[00:35:24.074 --> 00:35:25.655]  You haven't paid all the taxes, they say?
[00:35:26.616 --> 00:35:28.718]  People that hire you will be given felonies.
[00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:31.167]  Felony federal charges.
[00:35:31.487 --> 00:35:32.849]  The illegals will be above the law.
[00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:37.373]  This is all a plan to destroy the middle class.
[00:35:38.674 --> 00:35:41.676]  The TSA is going to run everything.
[00:35:41.776 --> 00:35:42.417]  It's public!
[00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:44.479]  And I sit here with horror.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:52.046]  Going to the urban warfare drills, reading Army documents, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, now four years ago, five years ago, 2007.
[00:35:52.086 --> 00:35:55.108]  I mean, the 2007 Defense Act
[00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.725]  They're horrible every year of the new stuff they have.
[00:35:59.745 --> 00:36:02.034]  This latest one abolishes the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:36:07.149 --> 00:36:10.771]  In the least that, you know, you did something intentional.
[00:36:10.851 --> 00:36:17.053]  I'm saying that just a caution that these people can, you know, play other people.
[00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:27.298]  And then, you know, like we, you know, heard, you know, one example, Mr. Chapman, give his thoughts based on what they said.
[00:36:29.139 --> 00:36:30.220]  Oh, I do agree with you.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:30.740]  No, no, no.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.422]  In hindsight, because J.P.
[00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:47.493]  Morgan is so desperate, because according to Max Keiser and many other experts I agree with who have been proven right, they couldn't physically deliver gold because they had been in the market shorting it to try to drive it down.
[00:36:47.933 --> 00:36:51.997]  And then if it didn't go down, they were going to be basically bankrupted.
[00:36:52.317 --> 00:36:55.800]  So they did stuff like MF Global, didn't deliver the gold.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:08.947]  They did stuff like raise the margin calls over and over again through their control of governments worldwide, and they did stuff like con the public into believing that it was going to go up.
[00:37:09.507 --> 00:37:17.211]  And so, yes, you never know what curveballs they're going to throw, but they can only play these games for certain short periods of time.
[00:37:17.751 --> 00:37:22.834]  As they globally devalue currencies, which they're accelerating, what's going to happen to commodities long term?
[00:37:23.882 --> 00:37:24.605]  They should go up.
[00:37:24.886 --> 00:37:26.874]  They should, should go up.
[00:37:27.577 --> 00:37:29.444]  If true economics prevails.
[00:37:30.484 --> 00:37:34.987]  Exactly, so all we can do is, is go with free market economics.
[00:37:35.327 --> 00:37:47.393]  They've got a rigged market, but history shows, Ron Paul agrees, the Von Mise Institute agrees, Austrian economics, even the Keynesian... I mean, bottom line economic law is what goes up must come down.
[00:37:47.574 --> 00:37:51.856]  And so their currency system is going to catch up with them.
[00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:52.676]  It already has.
[00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.878]  Man, I go to shops now to buy stuff.
[00:37:55.938 --> 00:37:57.020]  I go to the grocery store.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.943]  The inflation is horrible.
[00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:07.520]  And they're telling us that inflation is 3, 4, 5, 6 percent, depending on what group you're looking at, John.
[00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:09.294]  That's right.
[00:38:09.474 --> 00:38:09.674]  Yeah.
[00:38:10.375 --> 00:38:11.996]  I mean, so who knows what's going to happen?
[00:38:12.276 --> 00:38:12.876]  I mean, who knows?
[00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:13.816]  They could do anything.
[00:38:14.377 --> 00:38:17.098]  They could outlaw gold and silver again and say, turn it in.
[00:38:17.118 --> 00:38:25.002]  I mean, when you're living under tyranny, that's why societies fall apart, because there's no security to invest.
[00:38:25.282 --> 00:38:26.703]  There's no security to build.
[00:38:26.963 --> 00:38:28.323]  There's no security to hire.
[00:38:28.603 --> 00:38:30.084]  There's no security.
[00:38:30.764 --> 00:38:34.986]  Except if you're a big globalist, Fortune 100, you know how things are going to go.
[00:38:35.107 --> 00:38:35.947]  You know how to plan.
[00:38:36.327 --> 00:38:37.808]  Everybody else is shut down.
[00:38:40.478 --> 00:38:41.900]  Well, I appreciate your show.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.701]  Thank you very much.
[00:38:42.981 --> 00:38:43.802]  Thank you, John.
[00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:45.604]  And again, I said I'm going to take a lot of calls.
[00:38:45.644 --> 00:38:46.925]  I've taken one in 15 minutes.
[00:38:47.606 --> 00:38:50.589]  By the way, he was listening on... Well, what was that station?
[00:38:50.649 --> 00:38:52.772]  I need to plug stations when people call in on him, John.
[00:38:52.792 --> 00:38:52.852]  1520 AM.
[00:38:58.644 --> 00:38:59.924]  WLUV in Illinois.
[00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:03.085]  Thank you so much, all of you great affiliates out there.
[00:39:03.105 --> 00:39:03.845]  I am going to more and more.
[00:39:03.865 --> 00:39:11.267]  You know, we never really screen your calls, but it is good for people to tell us how they're listening so we can plug XM or local AM and FM stations.
[00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:11.848]  That's important.
[00:39:13.168 --> 00:39:14.028]  Man, I get wound up.
[00:39:14.108 --> 00:39:17.409]  I take off a couple days and I am so wound up right now.
[00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:21.690]  All right, let's try to go quickly now to Mark, Bobby, Tom, Wadeep, and others.
[00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:23.971]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:26.160]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:26.980]  Hey, buddy.
[00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:28.242]  Hey, man.
[00:39:29.543 --> 00:39:38.391]  My old radio friend, I just want to sincerely wish and I do pray for the best year yet coming up.
[00:39:39.215 --> 00:39:42.559]  For you and your family, of course, for all of us.
[00:39:43.841 --> 00:39:44.481]  Thank you, sir.
[00:39:45.062 --> 00:39:47.124]  You contribute and you give so much personally.
[00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:51.870]  I think you deserve a special prayer and I believe God's going to make it that way for you.
[00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:54.713]  I notice you're striving for more excellence.
[00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:56.335]  You've already achieved excellence.
[00:39:56.696 --> 00:39:57.897]  You're now polishing up.
[00:39:58.678 --> 00:40:01.200]  Well, my problem is I'm too wound up.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.684]  I mean, I'm like a horse that comes out of the gate and runs through the wall, runs over the fence instead of staying on the track.
[00:40:07.724 --> 00:40:14.089]  I've got to grow up and polish and focus, but I do feel like I've got 600 horsepower under the hood.
[00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:22.054]  It'll just take a little bit more of what you're doing nutritionally and diet-wise and exercise, and you're just about there, man.
[00:40:22.114 --> 00:40:22.775]  You really are.
[00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:23.295]  Well, thank you.
[00:40:23.315 --> 00:40:24.016]  God bless you, sir.
[00:40:24.056 --> 00:40:26.938]  What do you think about all the incredible things that are unfolding?
[00:40:29.117 --> 00:40:48.056]  I mentioned to you on the show, going back a couple of years, about two years, Alex, that, you know, I noticed the speed, and so did you, their rate of implementation of their global agenda economically, as well as tyranny-wise, destroying our Constitution and destroying other countries.
[00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:49.116]  We're good to go.
[00:41:11.105 --> 00:41:26.650]  Only game plan in town and it's the one in the Bible where we're to expose evil and To defeat it and we can only try our best to do that and God honors that so God bless you I just wanted to mention one thing Alex really asked you a question.
[00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:27.430]  Have you heard about?
[00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.632]  House bill 46 46 Fill me in on it.
[00:41:33.672 --> 00:41:36.233]  I think I have but I want to make sure I'm accurate.
[00:41:36.253 --> 00:41:36.273]  I
[00:41:37.165 --> 00:41:53.768]  Well, from a source, a radio source who I've always found very reliable through the years, this bill has already been passed through Congress, but it's not taken effect yet, nor has it been announced publicly, but that it will go into effect
[00:41:54.582 --> 00:41:56.223]  Right after the New Year begins.
[00:41:57.484 --> 00:41:59.746]  I heard specifically the date January 1st.
[00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:08.232]  Now what this bill does, Alex, is it exacts a transaction tax on all bank transactions.
[00:42:08.332 --> 00:42:14.856]  That means if one gets a Social Security check and they deposit it, 1% goes to the U.S.
[00:42:14.896 --> 00:42:15.317]  government.
[00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:23.015]  Well, I know Europe is trying to create that financial fee system that will really just affect the general public.
[00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:25.516]  And so I'll have to look into that.
[00:42:26.036 --> 00:42:31.099]  If that is the case, I will look into it.
[00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:31.799]  So it's HB 4646?
[00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:44.894]  Yes sir, and it will exact after your initial deposit, it will exact a 1% transaction tax on any debit card or check in payment for any goods or services at the bank.
[00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:51.561]  So it's not just your initial deposit, it's everything that you buy after your initial deposit out of that deposit.
[00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:55.044]  Well it's funny you say that because that's why they want a cashless society.
[00:42:55.064 --> 00:42:55.844]  We've been sold
[00:42:56.525 --> 00:43:06.107]  That it's such a great idea, and that it's just going to make everything so easy, and you just wave your hand with a microchip, or you get face scanned, and then your face is your money.
[00:43:06.908 --> 00:43:08.108]  And I appreciate your call, Mark.
[00:43:08.148 --> 00:43:22.692]  The problem is, from studying public globalist think tank documents, and big symposiums they've had in Chicago and other cities, where they get the big companies together for IT development and for commerce,
[00:43:25.206 --> 00:43:29.908]  Discussions about the future of banking, transactions, all of it over the years.
[00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:49.378]  The system admits once they've got you on a cashless society, they can track everything, they can manage the economy to consolidate it, not to help people, and they can knock out the black market, the underground, that's just barter and humans living like normal people.
[00:43:51.064 --> 00:43:55.771]  So everything the globalists are bringing in is about cracking down on the general public.
[00:43:56.412 --> 00:43:58.636]  It's all about shutting down mom and pop.
[00:43:59.317 --> 00:44:00.258]  And that's why you see...
[00:44:02.145 --> 00:44:25.911]  Well, it was even Forbes a few months ago, you know, had the headline, you know, why is there a giant purge and crackdown on lemonade stands, people being arrested, Girl Scouts being fined for selling cookies, even though it turns out they were paying the taxes, total harassment of high school bake sales, church bake sales, just enforcers everywhere, because
[00:44:27.674 --> 00:44:31.015]  Under this system, it's not just the Amish.
[00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:36.557]  Every day I hear about them arresting or raiding Amish who are just selling milk to their neighbors.
[00:44:36.597 --> 00:44:37.918]  I mean, that's what they've always done.
[00:44:39.258 --> 00:44:45.780]  They moved here from Germany and Russia and Switzerland in the last 200 years because they were being persecuted there.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.142]  And they said, we can come here and live on the land and work and practice our religion?
[00:44:51.162 --> 00:44:51.802]  They said, yeah.
[00:44:53.763 --> 00:44:54.163]  And you know what?
[00:44:54.183 --> 00:44:56.224]  The Amish and Mennonites, they'll just pick up and leave.
[00:44:57.708 --> 00:44:58.248]  Where are they going to go?
[00:44:58.268 --> 00:44:58.729]  Paraguay?
[00:44:58.749 --> 00:45:00.270]  They're even now being persecuted there.
[00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.794]  Just trying to produce food and sell it for almost nothing to the locals.
[00:45:05.874 --> 00:45:08.457]  They're good for economies, but the system doesn't want that.
[00:45:08.797 --> 00:45:10.578]  Because it's all about a consolidation.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.521]  I mean, here's a Daily Mail headline.
[00:45:15.402 --> 00:45:18.645]  The rise of pernicious laws that criminalize the law abiding.
[00:45:20.106 --> 00:45:21.327]  And this is an article out of England.
[00:45:23.106 --> 00:45:26.487]  How they're just coming out with all these new laws and regulations.
[00:45:26.507 --> 00:45:33.410]  I mean, I saw one where a 90-year-old woman's been feeding ducks since she was a child at a local lake, and they arrested her.
[00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:37.452]  And what, fined her for $1,000 for feeding them some bread.
[00:45:37.472 --> 00:45:41.674]  I mean, I take my children once a month or so down to Town Lake to feed bread to the ducks.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:51.306]  I see articles where woman given $2,000 fine for throwing cat litter in the trash can.
[00:45:52.067 --> 00:45:55.710]  You see these articles where the police are only there to raise money.
[00:45:57.632 --> 00:46:02.456]  And now they're setting up federalized rural affairs systems.
[00:46:03.277 --> 00:46:05.519]  And this Bureau of Rural Affairs, this
[00:46:08.479 --> 00:46:09.019]  Commission.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.062]  This Council of Rural Affairs is the technical name.
[00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.684]  And then most of it is federalized locals.
[00:46:14.704 --> 00:46:17.547]  They're wearing your local state game warden and county game warden.
[00:46:17.827 --> 00:46:19.368]  They're wearing local BLM.
[00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:28.977]  But they're under the feds and they march up and literally get in your face and treat you like absolute trash.
[00:46:30.258 --> 00:46:33.500]  The EPA a year ago said dust off of a plow
[00:46:35.302 --> 00:46:38.844]  $1,000 fine for every incident and they just sit there.
[00:46:38.984 --> 00:46:39.644]  It's on the news.
[00:46:40.085 --> 00:46:41.625]  They're sitting there.
[00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:42.046]  Okay.
[00:46:42.106 --> 00:46:47.068]  I watched you plow for eight hours and every row you plowed was a new fine.
[00:46:47.568 --> 00:46:48.529]  That is going to be $65,000.
[00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:52.411]  No judge, no jury.
[00:46:52.431 --> 00:46:53.071]  You can't appeal.
[00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:55.132]  Now the Congress just passed.
[00:46:55.932 --> 00:46:57.413]  Obama says he's going to veto it.
[00:46:57.873 --> 00:46:59.934]  A bill saying you're allowed to have dust off your field.
[00:47:00.254 --> 00:47:01.275]  They said, Hey,
[00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:05.370]  is a toxic waste.
[00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:13.158]  You know, splicing all the crops together where they, in three generations, sterilize every mammal that eats them, that's not a problem.
[00:47:15.981 --> 00:47:22.307]  Oh, if there's any runoff from your field into any type of stream, they're going to take your property.
[00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.053]  But if you're a big global corporation, you can do whatever you want.
[00:47:28.959 --> 00:47:43.386]  I remember an AP article back in the late 90s, where there were thousands of violations at one Tyson plant, or complex of plants, for chicken production, and then another local had a couple violations and they got shut down.
[00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:51.810]  That's why the big corporations always lobby for more regs, because they're not enforced on them.
[00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:56.773]  That's the essence of the New World Order.
[00:47:59.093 --> 00:48:00.915]  And Republicans aren't going to tell you that.
[00:48:00.975 --> 00:48:08.581]  They're not going to tell you why Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are supporting Obamacare.
[00:48:11.303 --> 00:48:14.025]  Because that's what the insurance companies under the big banks want.
[00:48:14.846 --> 00:48:21.151]  It lets government take over medicine and cut back what you get, and it makes 35 million people buy the insurance.
[00:48:23.413 --> 00:48:25.815]  It's on record the big banks wrote that bill.
[00:48:27.136 --> 00:48:29.817]  Of course Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are for it.
[00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:32.678]  See, it's a cover that it's even socialism.
[00:48:32.718 --> 00:48:35.139]  That's bad enough, because it always leads to control.
[00:48:35.719 --> 00:48:43.542]  But you think these big mega-ruthless corporations that in Africa and Latin America send in military to kill indigenous people for their property?
[00:48:44.863 --> 00:48:47.724]  Under environmental auspices, but then they go ahead and cut it all down?
[00:48:48.824 --> 00:48:50.925]  Do you think they care about you or I?
[00:48:51.085 --> 00:48:51.345]  No!
[00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:52.306]  The answer is no!
[00:48:56.038 --> 00:48:57.424]  I'm gonna get to it all in the next hour.
[00:48:57.484 --> 00:48:58.910]  Let's continue with your calls quickly here.
[00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.019]  Bobby in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:49:02.498 --> 00:49:13.406]  If you go to Google and type in BPA and retail workers, you'll find a report from the Environmental Working Group stating that retail workers carry an average of 30% more BPA, estrogen than other adults.
[00:49:13.987 --> 00:49:18.230]  Everyone should print that article off and give it to every cashier you buy something from.
[00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.092]  Yeah, and of course most of them will look at you like you're a complete moron.
[00:49:21.452 --> 00:49:28.638]  You mean you're bringing me a mainline government report that of thousands of plastics, the one they've chosen for printer ink?
[00:49:29.578 --> 00:49:37.365]  For the plastics, for everything, there's an estrogen mimicker that lowers male fertility and hyper accelerates women.
[00:49:37.385 --> 00:49:38.826]  I mean, it's aging women inside.
[00:49:38.866 --> 00:49:40.467]  That's why breast cancer is off the charts.
[00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:49.374]  And I warn people and read the reports and CBS News comes out and says Alex Jones hates gay people and says the chemicals want to make us gay.
[00:49:49.855 --> 00:49:52.657]  They make a joke out of it because it's a chemical weapon attack.
[00:49:53.057 --> 00:49:54.438]  And the women, you know, hey, you know what?
[00:49:54.598 --> 00:49:58.662]  CBS reporters, so what if their wife dies of breast cancer or their daughter or grandma?
[00:49:59.232 --> 00:50:00.073]  Whoop-dee-doo!
[00:50:00.514 --> 00:50:08.465]  Let's not actually warn people that it hyper-feminizes women and gives them breast cancer, and then feminizes men and gives us testicular cancer.
[00:50:08.645 --> 00:50:11.709]  Well, we can just make a joke about how I'm bashing gay people.
[00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:16.115]  Has nothing to do with that, because they're chemically altering who we are.
[00:50:17.512 --> 00:50:25.514]  And just like in the movie The Last Man on Earth, when he's trying to cure him, they go, no, we don't want that, and throw a spear right through him.
[00:50:25.554 --> 00:50:26.774]  Omega Man's the remake.
[00:50:26.794 --> 00:50:28.755]  It's like, hey, I know what they're doing to us.
[00:50:29.895 --> 00:50:30.955]  You don't want the cancer.
[00:50:31.135 --> 00:50:31.975]  Here, don't do this.
[00:50:32.056 --> 00:50:33.036]  It's like, shut up!
[00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:33.956]  I want it!
[00:50:33.996 --> 00:50:35.436]  They changed me, and that's me!
[00:50:35.456 --> 00:50:35.836]  Ah!
[00:50:35.876 --> 00:50:37.037]  And it's like, ugh!
[00:50:37.497 --> 00:50:40.017]  And it's, I mean, we ought to pull that up from Omega Man.
[00:50:40.418 --> 00:50:42.038]  Do you get my analogy, Bobby?
[00:50:43.254 --> 00:50:52.765]  Yeah, is it anti-gay for a doctor who prescribes hormones for transvestite to say that these hormones are going to make you more feminine?
[00:50:52.845 --> 00:50:54.707]  Is that anti-gay for that doctor to say that?
[00:50:55.368 --> 00:50:57.290]  Because it's basically... Exactly!
[00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:58.512]  We should have a choice!
[00:50:58.592 --> 00:50:59.112]  Stay there!
[00:50:59.132 --> 00:50:59.533]  Stay there!
[00:50:59.553 --> 00:51:00.153]  We'll be right back!

[00:54:04.072 --> 00:54:10.956]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:54:10.996 --> 00:54:12.896]  You know, this is my frustration.
[00:54:12.936 --> 00:54:15.378]  This is my spinning of wheels sometimes.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:38.798]  Another report I want to do, because I hit a nerve three years ago reading big scientific reports that were out about bisphenol A. I've been talking about it for over a decade, but it was finally coming out in mainline government reports in Europe and other places, that bisphenol A that's used in the printer ink, the receipts at the store, the plastic lining when you microwave that food.
[00:54:39.238 --> 00:54:41.300]  You wonder why boys are so feminine.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.662]  And confused why girls are so hyper-feminine.
[00:54:44.702 --> 00:54:46.623]  Some of them are going into puberty at age 3 now.
[00:54:47.324 --> 00:54:48.625]  And I did a big report on it.
[00:54:49.445 --> 00:54:58.151]  And hundreds of George Soros affiliated groups, he has hundreds, came out and said, Alex Jones says the government wants to make us gay.
[00:54:58.692 --> 00:55:02.254]  Well actually, I do have government documents we covered in Endgame 1.5.
[00:55:04.281 --> 00:55:21.473]  With Professor and Dr. Kaufman, who came across documents where they said, we will promote promiscuity because the studies show that people then won't have lasting relationships and the state will get the children, which you've now seen, somebody who's, you know, out of wedlock, four times more likely to be in prison.
[00:55:22.013 --> 00:55:24.895]  It's not, and then they spin it, oh you're bashing single mothers.
[00:55:25.015 --> 00:55:25.295]  No!
[00:55:25.795 --> 00:55:27.096]  We're saying it's a lot harder.
[00:55:27.897 --> 00:55:29.358]  The state wants you isolated.
[00:55:30.788 --> 00:55:31.128]  Okay?
[00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:32.609]  They want to break up the family.
[00:55:32.649 --> 00:55:38.674]  It's not a... So, then we say, uh, yes, this is, uh, massively... My main report was about breast cancer.
[00:55:39.114 --> 00:55:42.777]  Number one in the world in the U.S., up several thousand percentage points.
[00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:44.999]  It is a hellish scourge.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.341]  My grandmother has breast cancer.
[00:55:49.062 --> 00:55:49.342]  Okay?
[00:55:50.363 --> 00:55:52.464]  And, uh, in fact, that was three years ago.
[00:55:52.484 --> 00:55:53.305]  She's had it that long.
[00:55:54.706 --> 00:55:56.067]  And, uh, it's slow-growing.
[00:55:56.107 --> 00:55:58.289]  She's opted just to, you know, not do it.
[00:55:58.869 --> 00:55:59.450]  Not deal with it.
[00:56:00.846 --> 00:56:10.710]  But the point is, that I was talking about that, and by the time it hit CBS News and ABC News last week, oh, this guy Ron Paul talks to says they want to make you gay.
[00:56:11.031 --> 00:56:20.135]  No, what I said was, is that fish are hermaphrodites, frogs are hermaphrodites, all over the Western world, when our sewage dumps into the water.
[00:56:21.175 --> 00:56:25.017]  This stuff coming out of us is so strong, it's destroying them as well.
[00:56:25.477 --> 00:56:29.879]  Because their life cycles are quicker, and it mutates more each generation.
[00:56:30.871 --> 00:56:36.636]  Just type in human DNA massively damaged from heavy metals, and there's all the big reports.
[00:56:36.736 --> 00:56:46.043]  So, for those that don't know what Omega Man is, it's a remake of that Vincent Price movie, What the Last Man on Earth, or whatever it's called.
[00:56:46.263 --> 00:56:51.828]  They're both excellent sci-fi movies, where there's a virus that basically turns people into these undead.
[00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.593]  And some of them retained their intelligence.
[00:56:57.174 --> 00:57:00.096]  And he's got a cure for them, and at the end he's like, I can cure you!
[00:57:00.577 --> 00:57:02.799]  I figured out how to reverse the virus, he's a scientist.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.461]  And they kill him.
[00:57:05.876 --> 00:57:10.079]  And so I was using the analogy of, hey, did you know the system wants to reduce our population?
[00:57:10.099 --> 00:57:11.200]  They want to break up the family.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:20.587]  So they're using hormones on us, just like they have genetically modified mosquitoes they release that then breed with the other mosquitoes with a genetic trait to produce a hormone.
[00:57:20.607 --> 00:57:21.347]  So they're sterile.
[00:57:21.847 --> 00:57:24.970]  The mad scientists are manipulating us.
[00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:29.541]  And their answer is, you're not supposed to tell people they have a choice.
[00:57:30.261 --> 00:57:37.084]  They're supposed to say, it's trendy, be glad you want to put makeup on, you know, as a man out there because you've got so much estrogen.
[00:57:37.344 --> 00:57:38.845]  Be glad you feel like a woman.
[00:57:39.045 --> 00:57:40.666]  Be glad you've got male breast.
[00:57:40.946 --> 00:57:43.087]  Be glad your wife's dying of breast cancer.
[00:57:43.307 --> 00:57:45.248]  Be glad your mother's dying of breast cancer.
[00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:51.411]  And you're anti-homophobic or homophobe or whatever if you don't embrace it.
[00:57:51.892 --> 00:57:53.012]  See how that's all scientific?
[00:57:53.032 --> 00:57:58.716]  They're just cold scientists destroying our humanity, destroying our sexuality, artificially changing us.
[00:57:59.161 --> 00:58:01.443]  Then the argument is, oh, there weren't gay people in Rome.
[00:58:02.164 --> 00:58:04.105]  Of course that stuff's gone on in history.
[00:58:04.365 --> 00:58:06.207]  I'm not making even a moral issue here.
[00:58:06.507 --> 00:58:07.988]  I'm saying I have a choice.
[00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:12.192]  They shouldn't be trying to spike everything with female hormones, man.
[00:58:12.232 --> 00:58:13.013]  That's uncool!
[00:58:13.713 --> 00:58:13.973]  Okay?
[00:58:14.073 --> 00:58:15.875]  I don't want to take female hormones.
[00:58:16.475 --> 00:58:17.336]  I want to be a male.
[00:58:18.217 --> 00:58:18.577]  Okay?
[00:58:19.018 --> 00:58:23.641]  And I don't want my wife to be bombarded and my daughters with so much they get breast cancer.
[00:58:24.382 --> 00:58:24.802]  Okay?
[00:58:26.007 --> 00:58:28.188]  And now, oh, you're anti-woman, you don't want them to die.
[00:58:28.528 --> 00:58:29.848]  See how they use political correctness?
[00:58:29.868 --> 00:58:32.188]  I'm like, folks, this is hurting us, it's killing our women.
[00:58:32.388 --> 00:58:33.569]  Shut up, you just don't like women.
[00:58:33.769 --> 00:58:35.689]  No, no, no, they're putting the harm on them and it's hurting women.
[00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:37.150]  Shut up, you just want to hurt women.
[00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.490]  It's all nonsensical political correctness.
[00:58:43.831 --> 00:58:47.812]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.693 --> 00:58:57.077]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[00:59:03.502 --> 00:59:18.453]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:59:20.718 --> 00:59:24.579]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:59:25.299 --> 00:59:28.420]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:29.940]  Others don't.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.261]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:32.521 --> 00:59:34.021]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:59:46.504 --> 00:59:48.545]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:49.365]  Others don't.
[00:59:54.167 --> 00:59:56.071]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.572 --> 00:59:59.337]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.987 --> 01:00:10.189]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.809 --> 01:00:11.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.310]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:17.552]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:22.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:29.276]  Alright, I'm continuing with your calls a little bit here, and then I'm gonna get into more of the news and more of your calls, and Gerald Salente's joining us.
[01:00:29.977 --> 01:00:33.238]  Bobby just brought up a subject that when I started hitting it,
[01:00:34.244 --> 01:00:39.805]  Well, more than a decade ago, but sort of getting attention about three years ago, the system is really scared of this.
[01:00:40.405 --> 01:00:53.828]  Because they are jacking the GMO to sterilize men and women, but they're also adding feminizing, sterilizing, fertility-reducing hormones, as the Rockefeller Foundation said they would do in the mid-60s.
[01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:58.009]  We've republished those documents that are public, but link to them at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:59.688 --> 01:01:01.388]  They are feminizing men.
[01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:05.969]  They're not just adding sodium fluoride to brain damage you and reduce IQ.
[01:01:06.769 --> 01:01:10.290]  And I guess the political correctness now if you say that is, don't call people dumbed down.
[01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:12.690]  He's making fun of you saying you've been dumbed down.
[01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:13.851]  Drink more fluoride!
[01:01:14.111 --> 01:01:16.391]  But they don't do that there because it's too obvious.
[01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:26.093]  But when you say, hey, bisphenol A alone in most plastic products and linings and in the printer ink is massively increasing breast cancer in women in major studies.
[01:01:28.356 --> 01:01:32.542]  They don't know what to do, but I added it also feminizes men, and men are the main target.
[01:01:32.942 --> 01:01:38.290]  It's a byproduct for women dying of the breast cancer, and women are going into fertility now younger and younger.
[01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.633]  Some as young as three, if you can believe that.
[01:01:41.314 --> 01:01:43.196]  They're having babies at seven and eight.
[01:01:44.383 --> 01:01:47.504]  Fertility 100 years ago was on average 13 or 14.
[01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:53.625]  So all of that's going on, all of that's happening, and their answer is, shut up, you hate gay people.
[01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:59.906]  And so, not debating the morals of it here, so I can get through to some of you that are mind-controlled out there.
[01:02:00.526 --> 01:02:03.707]  Do I have a right to not have the government put female hormones in me?
[01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:06.868]  And a lot of folks have joined the cult.
[01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:14.877]  And I'm saying a cult aspect of that, and they're like, shut up, we're going to get you, you know, might as well, might as well give in to it.
[01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.297]  And it becomes a body snatcher type deal.
[01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:31.961]  If you want to force people artificially to join something, and see, as more and more of the public goes under the influence, and they also have the social stuff pushing it on the TV, so people act on the hormones, then as you're like, well, I don't want to take it, they're like, you're going to take it.
[01:02:32.361 --> 01:02:33.101]  You're going to join us.
[01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:38.565]  And so that's really the point it's now reached, is that you're going to join us, you're going to do this.
[01:02:40.146 --> 01:02:45.570]  And a lot of it is repressed families, people that are really into things that they think are shocking.
[01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:49.293]  And so it's, ooh, it's the bad thing, and we're going to make you do the bad thing.
[01:02:49.594 --> 01:02:56.339]  But for the globalist on top, it's just cold-blooded, put the sterilants into the water, screw up the society.
[01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.521]  And then when somebody pops up and says, here's all these government documents,
[01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:03.524]  Use political correctness and say you're attacking people's identity.
[01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.707]  And that's why I use the Omega Man analogy where he's like, I have the cure!
[01:03:06.727 --> 01:03:08.508]  You know, they're putting chemicals in you.
[01:03:08.988 --> 01:03:10.650]  They're like, shut up, kill him!
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.631]  And so that's basically the answer.
[01:03:12.911 --> 01:03:17.375]  So if you like dying of breast cancer and testicular cancer and prostate cancer, knock yourselves out.
[01:03:17.955 --> 01:03:19.036]  Okay, I'm the bad man, I guess.
[01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.738]  Because that stuff hyper-ages those organs.
[01:03:22.379 --> 01:03:29.165]  Because it's also, you know, a toxic form of the hormone that creates a lot of other retrograde hormones that it breaks down into.
[01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.466]  I don't want to get all into the science.
[01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:31.227]  You can go look at it yourself.
[01:03:31.527 --> 01:03:33.709]  Bobby, give people that latest report you mentioned.
[01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:41.276]  I've seen probably 50 or 60 over the last few years, but give us the latest and then we'll pull that up and see if I've seen that in the past.
[01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:47.917]  Yeah, you just Google BPA and retail workers and it's a report from the Environmental Working Group.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:57.122]  And it just shows how they tested the retail workers about 30% more estrogen from handling receipts and money and whatever else.
[01:03:57.542 --> 01:04:03.424]  And imagine what this is doing to pregnant mothers who are getting 30% more estrogen with that fetus inside them.
[01:04:04.004 --> 01:04:05.645]  And they're getting more miscarriages.
[01:04:05.705 --> 01:04:13.827]  They tend to, when you have too much estrogen and, what is it, not enough of the other hormones, progesterone, they have that second trimester
[01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:16.459]  Miscarriagement?
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.822]  Why tell women how to not have all those miscarriages that are epidemic?
[01:04:20.082 --> 01:04:21.743]  Just be- You're not trendy!
[01:04:22.323 --> 01:04:23.664]  You need to just shut up.
[01:04:23.684 --> 01:04:24.805]  You don't like gay people?
[01:04:26.243 --> 01:04:41.846]  We're being bathed in it, and all this post-consumer recycle stuff they're pushing, they're finding that even the toilet paper is exposing humans to harmful amounts of BTA because of the store receipts, which have been found to contain 2%, up to 2% BTA in total weight.
[01:04:42.147 --> 01:04:47.648]  So all this stuff that's being recycled and being, you know, pushed as a better alternative, these bags are being...
[01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:50.049]  It's all seen as animals.
[01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:52.610]  They put it in the money, the paper, the printer ink.
[01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.672]  All sitting back, scientifically laughing at us.
[01:04:55.912 --> 01:04:56.772]  Finish up, Bobby.
[01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.212]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:58.093]  I want to hear more from you.
[01:05:01.223 --> 01:05:05.466]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.766 --> 01:05:06.047]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:09.829]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.670]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:15.514]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:16.294]  It's true.
[01:05:16.614 --> 01:05:21.158]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.478 --> 01:05:22.018]  Number 3.
[01:05:22.299 --> 01:05:25.601]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:29.584]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.784 --> 01:05:30.345]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.585 --> 01:05:32.947]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:36.730]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:37.570]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:41.734]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.974 --> 01:05:46.738]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:47.018 --> 01:05:51.001]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:52.742]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:52.962 --> 01:05:55.064]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:55.224 --> 01:05:57.825]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:58.046 --> 01:06:03.709]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:08.973]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:10.594]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:10.774 --> 01:06:19.560]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:27.403]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:27.823 --> 01:06:35.426]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:40.748]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:41.048 --> 01:06:43.209]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:48.916]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:06:49.216 --> 01:06:51.521]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:53.705]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:07:02.003 --> 01:07:05.624]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.024 --> 01:07:09.025]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.265 --> 01:07:14.026]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:14.046 --> 01:07:20.267]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:20.447 --> 01:07:22.688]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:23.508]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:23.528 --> 01:07:23.968]  Bernanke?
[01:07:24.028 --> 01:07:24.388]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:25.149]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:27.509]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:43.974]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:49.055]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:59.339]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:07.902]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.793 --> 01:08:11.954]  Globalists like to play God.
[01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:19.138]  And one reason I enjoy taking phone calls is because they take us in directions I wouldn't have normally hit today.
[01:08:19.239 --> 01:08:22.841]  Bobby has been on with us since the last segment of the last hour.
[01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:24.857]  And you can pull it up.
[01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:30.700]  In fact, guys, we're going to show a video clip here in a moment, but then pull up BPA retail workers 30% higher.
[01:08:31.081 --> 01:08:31.741]  I do remember that.
[01:08:31.781 --> 01:08:32.822]  That came out months ago.
[01:08:33.722 --> 01:08:36.884]  BPA is on record triggering breast cancer.
[01:08:37.325 --> 01:08:40.547]  It's on record triggering prostate and testicular cancer.
[01:08:40.887 --> 01:08:43.169]  And if people think that's funny, that's wonderful.
[01:08:44.065 --> 01:08:54.375]  But CBS News and others last week attacked Ron Paul and said he goes on the show of Alex Jones who says the government puts chemicals in the food to make us gay.
[01:08:56.718 --> 01:09:02.564]  Now, this is a good thing that they're attacking on this subject because they're attacking because they're scared.
[01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:15.471]  What I pointed out is that it reduces male fertility, and makes girls go into puberty early, and causes the artificial aging, the accelerated aging of sexual tissues.
[01:09:15.892 --> 01:09:18.052]  Tissues that have a high hormonal flux.
[01:09:18.593 --> 01:09:23.294]  The ovaries, the breast, the prostate, the testicles.
[01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:28.076]  Those are areas affected heavily by hormone flux.
[01:09:28.937 --> 01:09:31.758]  To boil it down and simplify it, sharks do not get cancer.
[01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:34.612]  Because sharks do not operate off of hormones.
[01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:36.073]  They're cold-blooded.
[01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:36.953]  We're warm-blooded.
[01:09:38.334 --> 01:09:44.216]  That's why cancer is so high in mammals and marsupials, for that fact.
[01:09:45.237 --> 01:09:48.978]  One of the reasons is because we are hot-blooded creatures.
[01:09:49.038 --> 01:09:50.139]  Our hearts beat fast.
[01:09:50.559 --> 01:09:51.459]  We have hormones.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.500]  We're supercharged.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.360]  We're jacked up.
[01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.542]  Now, the system, and that wears out cells.
[01:09:59.383 --> 01:10:01.184]  Now, there's the Centers for Disease Prevention.
[01:10:02.659 --> 01:10:06.285]  Found BPA in 93% of Americans over age 6.
[01:10:08.148 --> 01:10:13.416]  And it goes on to get into the fact that workers in
[01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:19.465]  Retail have a 30% more BPA in their bodies.
[01:10:20.165 --> 01:10:22.227]  That was as of May 2009.
[01:10:22.607 --> 01:10:24.528]  So that's the federal government's own report.
[01:10:24.589 --> 01:10:25.829]  You can link right there.
[01:10:25.869 --> 01:10:31.934]  We have it on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers to that federal disease control and prevention in Atlanta.
[01:10:32.254 --> 01:10:38.079]  And they were forced a few years ago to report on it because it was all over Japanese, all over Russian, all over European news.
[01:10:38.419 --> 01:10:41.181]  I mean, again, I've been covering this since I got on air 16 years ago.
[01:10:42.802 --> 01:10:56.625]  And we knew then, this is added to our food, through the lining, through the microwavable stuff, through the glasses we buy, the bottles, but the printer ink, the money, and again, they have thousands of plastics they could use.
[01:10:57.325 --> 01:10:59.626]  Now, Bobby just brought up something that was key.
[01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:02.767]  BPA has proliferated.
[01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:08.408]  If you go back 10 years ago, aspartame was only in a couple hundred products.
[01:11:09.218 --> 01:11:13.040]  Now because the public's become aware of it, it's in over 10,000 last time I checked.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:16.742]  You can't buy sugar gum at a major store that doesn't have it.
[01:11:16.782 --> 01:11:18.963]  It says sugar, but it's got aspartame in it.
[01:11:19.783 --> 01:11:20.183]  And why?
[01:11:20.223 --> 01:11:21.724]  Because you're going to get addicted to that gum.
[01:11:22.825 --> 01:11:25.426]  All those food additives just aren't additives for flavor.
[01:11:25.486 --> 01:11:26.627]  They're addicting.
[01:11:28.087 --> 01:11:29.188]  They're addicting.
[01:11:31.304 --> 01:11:42.709]  They got a federal law passed decades ago where major fast food restaurants can use in their, the dough on things that are fried on the batter, they can put silicone in it.
[01:11:43.969 --> 01:11:46.190]  No wonder kidney failure is off the charts.
[01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:47.551]  No wonder liver failure.
[01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.031]  No wonder fatty liver.
[01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.152]  They're poisoning everything.
[01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:54.033]  And you study these elites, they don't eat any of this.
[01:11:54.073 --> 01:11:55.534]  They are obsessed with organic.
[01:11:56.754 --> 01:11:58.275]  They are obsessed with it.
[01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:01.482]  They know what they're doing.
[01:12:01.842 --> 01:12:03.143]  And, and, you know, this is what's funny.
[01:12:03.563 --> 01:12:04.604]  It's not funny, it's very sad.
[01:12:05.004 --> 01:12:11.648]  I get up here and I just showed you the federal government's own documents on screen, told you what to search to find them.
[01:12:11.968 --> 01:12:15.050]  You can get literally, there's the CDC's own report.
[01:12:20.173 --> 01:12:27.937]  But, separately, when you read into the deeper studies on bisphenol A, hyperfeminizes women,
[01:12:29.326 --> 01:12:29.906]  We're good to go.
[01:12:53.484 --> 01:12:54.885]  They're doing this on purpose.
[01:12:54.925 --> 01:13:00.089]  They're selling the culture, they're selling the ideas, they're injecting it while putting the chemicals in.
[01:13:01.329 --> 01:13:07.173]  And they've done studies, you can pull them up, where you give this to monkeys, you give it to dogs, you give it to frogs.
[01:13:07.694 --> 01:13:12.277]  Male frogs, even reptiles operate similarly, will start acting like females.
[01:13:12.897 --> 01:13:18.381]  And then when you scientifically get up here and try to warn people, they make a joke out of it.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.442]  I'm not attacking anybody for what their identity is.
[01:13:25.622 --> 01:13:26.763]  Quite frankly, I don't care.
[01:13:27.344 --> 01:13:32.807]  People get off on this stuff so much and love it when they get attacked for their identity, whatever they're into.
[01:13:32.947 --> 01:13:33.468]  I don't care.
[01:13:33.528 --> 01:13:34.288]  Stay out of my way.
[01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:35.189]  Okay?
[01:13:35.449 --> 01:13:41.513]  Leave my Second Amendment, my private property, my freedom alone, and don't try to brainwash my children to your thinking, no matter what it is.
[01:13:43.815 --> 01:13:44.275]  It's simple.
[01:13:44.435 --> 01:13:45.556]  I want to be independent and free.
[01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:53.132]  But let's be honest, we're in artificial habitat with the system on record jacking with our food and our water.
[01:13:53.773 --> 01:13:55.615]  And by the way, it's not just with the sexual hormones.
[01:13:55.975 --> 01:13:59.498]  They're adding over 350 chemicals are added.
[01:13:59.538 --> 01:14:05.104]  Generally, it's only a couple hundred, but there's 350 plus that tend to be added to your water in what they call fluoride.
[01:14:05.324 --> 01:14:08.167]  We're talking about radium, strontium, uranium.
[01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:21.221]  Now, if those had sexual effects, which they do, they reduce fertility, increase cancer, but they don't really flip you one way or the other sexually, they would say, don't criticize uranium in the water, you don't like gay people.
[01:14:21.422 --> 01:14:22.943]  And you're like, what does that have to do with gay people?
[01:14:23.303 --> 01:14:25.725]  It's all just a politically correct game they play.
[01:14:26.225 --> 01:14:32.450]  And CBS and ABC and all these other big publications were the talking point now that Alex Jones
[01:14:34.255 --> 01:14:36.696]  Says they're putting stuff in the food to make you gay.
[01:14:37.176 --> 01:14:38.777]  That's what's so good about this.
[01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:43.539]  When they attack us, people are actually going out and finding what I've really said.
[01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:48.461]  And saying, you know what, I don't want to get testicular cancer, and I don't want my wife to die of breast cancer.
[01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:51.682]  I'm going to look into this bisphenol A. And you find out it's all true.
[01:14:51.702 --> 01:14:54.463]  And you're like, wow, Alex Jones tried to warn me.
[01:14:54.803 --> 01:14:56.564]  Which, by the way, is not some favor, folks.
[01:14:57.064 --> 01:14:58.525]  We're all under attack by this.
[01:14:59.085 --> 01:15:01.767]  I'm not some hero for telling you this, but I'll tell you this.
[01:15:02.187 --> 01:15:07.810]  CBS News and the rest of them are wicked devils who know exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:10.092 --> 01:15:16.276]  There is a talking point out that, oh, this guy's trying to warn people we're jacking their food and water with hormones and toxins.
[01:15:16.936 --> 01:15:18.837]  That's why the public can't wake up as in a trance.
[01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:22.900]  We're drugged, folks, only by being conscious to the drugging.
[01:15:23.823 --> 01:15:34.952]  And then the fact that we're in a trance from television that puts you in a literal, in between waking and sleeping, sleepwalking phase, literal brainwave, only by being conscious and finally shaking somebody out of it.
[01:15:35.212 --> 01:15:37.394]  You've heard the political term, wake people up.
[01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:38.334]  I woke up.
[01:15:38.715 --> 01:15:39.875]  That's not a figure of speech.
[01:15:40.196 --> 01:15:40.676]  You do.
[01:15:40.796 --> 01:15:41.997]  You wake up.
[01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:43.858]  And you know what?
[01:15:43.878 --> 01:15:44.979]  You're going to be groggy.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.821]  It's going to feel like a hangover.
[01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:48.102]  It's going to be frightening.
[01:15:49.349 --> 01:15:51.291]  But then you realize, well, I was already in this position.
[01:15:51.652 --> 01:15:52.613]  At least I'm awake now.
[01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:57.198]  Because all the stuff going on around us, it's going on whether you want to deny it or not.
[01:15:58.239 --> 01:15:59.240]  Reality's there.
[01:15:59.581 --> 01:16:02.404]  I've used the analogy, and I'm going back to your calls, of somebody on PCP.
[01:16:04.587 --> 01:16:05.588]  And they do it all the time.
[01:16:07.472 --> 01:16:09.473]  Because the governor is taking off their mind.
[01:16:09.793 --> 01:16:11.494]  They are put in a dream state.
[01:16:12.174 --> 01:16:15.315]  A hallucinatory lower brain sleep state.
[01:16:15.335 --> 01:16:18.997]  Not only are they in a sleep state, it's not the cerebral cortex in a sleep state.
[01:16:19.477 --> 01:16:22.458]  Like when you're walking around on Prozac, that puts you in a sleep state because it's a toxin.
[01:16:23.999 --> 01:16:25.860]  A fluoride toxin that's made out of fluoride.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.322]  There are a lot of poisons that make you feel good.
[01:16:30.682 --> 01:16:32.903]  It's in the hallucinogen psychotropic class.
[01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:33.403]  Go look it up.
[01:16:35.543 --> 01:16:39.245]  But people on PCP can beat up 10 cops, they can punch through windshields.
[01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:41.146]  I talked to Derek Einkoff about it.
[01:16:41.386 --> 01:16:45.808]  He ran into guys fighting on PCP, killing each other as an ambulance.
[01:16:46.428 --> 01:16:48.089]  They got the call, shut it before the cops.
[01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.730]  I've talked to police who've seen people on PCP.
[01:16:52.251 --> 01:16:56.873]  Because the governor's gone, and they will just run and jump off a 20-story roof thinking they're a bird.
[01:16:58.854 --> 01:16:59.574]  But, you know what?
[01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:12.400]  Just because the public thinks the government loves them and everything's fine, everything's sweetie cake, and those reporters that work for the sellout system know they're BSing people but still feel like they're part of the power structure, you're just at a different level of delusion.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.881]  There's no making a deal with this system.
[01:17:19.003 --> 01:17:24.945]  And so, you think you're just gonna go jump off the cliff and it's really, you're a butterfly and you're gonna go flutter down to the ground?
[01:17:25.286 --> 01:17:25.926]  Not gonna happen.
[01:17:27.421 --> 01:17:42.186]  And that's why for those of us that are awake, we watch propaganda, we see the messages implanted in TV, movies, anti-family, anti-male, endless brainwashing, and it's laughable to those of us that are awake.
[01:17:42.206 --> 01:17:43.547]  We're like, look at it, it's right there!
[01:17:43.947 --> 01:17:46.188]  And it becomes obnoxious, it's everywhere!
[01:17:47.348 --> 01:17:49.989]  And we tend to get angry at the general public who's in a trance.
[01:17:50.009 --> 01:17:51.650]  These are zombie victims!
[01:17:53.148 --> 01:18:05.296]  This is like breaking into a Dr. Ewing Cameron CIA mind control base that's been declassified, where they had school kids they kidnapped all hooked up with drugs and recording audio brainwashing them.
[01:18:06.437 --> 01:18:17.564]  Just because you take the earmuffs off somebody who's being brainwashed and being injected with PCP and a cocktail of LSD and mescaline, just because they don't know who you are, they're not bad people.
[01:18:17.624 --> 01:18:18.445]  These are victims!
[01:18:19.557 --> 01:18:21.780]  And the police officers listening right now are victims.
[01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:24.724]  The bureaucrats listening right now are victims.
[01:18:24.744 --> 01:18:26.025]  The military are victims.
[01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:31.793]  And now that we're in a trance, the system can sell all this publicly.
[01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:44.588]  I mean, I remember seeing six, seven years ago in Wired Magazine, the article was called the Marshall Plan, because the head futurist at the Pentagon is called Dr. Marshall, and he was saying, you know, we put the troops on drugs in Afghanistan.
[01:18:44.969 --> 01:18:49.013]  After they go in and do some particularly nasty work, we all give them amnesiacs now.
[01:18:49.394 --> 01:18:52.056]  Did you know they're doing that in a large part of the force now?
[01:18:52.998 --> 01:18:58.581]  They actually now part of the regiment is hypnosis and amnesia cocktails.
[01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:01.263]  This is public mind control now going on.
[01:19:01.523 --> 01:19:03.304]  This isn't going on in some laboratory now.
[01:19:03.584 --> 01:19:08.567]  They hide it in plain view because the public is in a trance as well, not deeply in one.
[01:19:08.867 --> 01:19:11.329]  They're bringing the public deeper into a trance.
[01:19:11.989 --> 01:19:28.021]  With the chemicals, with the hormones, with the electromagnetic, with all of it, getting people into this state where they'll accept almost anything, including weird, fat, pot-bellied men groping your daughters at the airport, now to be on the highways.
[01:19:28.361 --> 01:19:32.885]  But Bobby, I appreciate you, we're going to break here, but I appreciate you raising those points, sir.
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:48.025]  Thank you, and one more thing, those smart meters, those are directly in our houses, and people need to call up the electricity company every month and complain, because there's no, who's to say they're overcharging, who's to say they're not overcharging people?
[01:19:48.045 --> 01:19:50.486]  No, no, they've been caught, and they track everything in your house.
[01:19:51.326 --> 01:19:52.306]  They admit that, sir.
[01:19:52.366 --> 01:19:54.447]  They admit pure or welling in evil.
[01:19:55.127 --> 01:19:57.388]  They'll put poison in our water, of course they're surveilling us.
[01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:04.873]  Does being over 40 make you feel like half the man you used to be?
[01:20:04.893 --> 01:20:06.034]  Do you feel tired?
[01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:06.915]  Out of shape?
[01:20:07.175 --> 01:20:08.757]  Is your romantic life suffering?
[01:20:09.077 --> 01:20:10.058]  It's not your fault.

[01:22:05.097 --> 01:22:06.278]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:22:06.598 --> 01:22:15.043]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:22:15.483 --> 01:22:18.645]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:22:18.925 --> 01:22:19.925]  But take heart.
[01:22:19.985 --> 01:22:23.487]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:22:23.787 --> 01:22:28.750]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:32.691]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:34.431]  The globalists are scared.
[01:22:34.711 --> 01:22:35.731]  They've overreached.
[01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:39.192]  The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[01:22:57.236 --> 01:22:58.436]  The Info War now.
[01:22:58.536 --> 01:23:00.217]  Now goes into high gear!
[01:23:01.338 --> 01:23:01.758]  Warning!

[01:24:26.038 --> 01:24:28.359]  Here's the guy and the last man on earth.
[01:24:28.399 --> 01:24:32.962]  He tried to warn them he's got the cure for the disease they've got, but they just kill him.
[01:24:33.522 --> 01:24:34.382]  They don't want to be helped.
[01:24:35.063 --> 01:24:35.603]  They like it.
[01:24:37.424 --> 01:24:38.985]  They don't want to know what was done to them.
[01:25:07.879 --> 01:25:08.440]  All of you.
[01:25:09.461 --> 01:25:10.442]  All of you freaks!
[01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:18.289]  Mutations!
[01:25:22.193 --> 01:25:27.758]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:25:28.219 --> 01:25:30.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:25:39.366 --> 01:25:42.089]  Alright, let's go to Muad'Dib in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:42.129 --> 01:25:44.993]  Gerald Cilente is coming up on the latest on the world economy.
[01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:47.015]  Muad'Dib, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:47.035 --> 01:25:49.258]  Is this that evil Alex Jones?
[01:25:50.259 --> 01:25:56.447]  I'm the guy telling folks they're putting stuff in there to increase our cancer and our cancer rates several thousand times off the charts.
[01:25:56.567 --> 01:25:57.247]  I'm the Batman!
[01:25:58.131 --> 01:25:59.611]  You're the bad man, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:59.991 --> 01:26:04.213]  Anyway, I'm calling from Pennsylvania with some new news and two questions.
[01:26:04.273 --> 01:26:20.477]  The first news, as a Pennsylvania water customer, I just got a new letter today stating that they're changing from processing the water and cleaning it from chlorine to chloramine.
[01:26:21.517 --> 01:26:27.579]  And I have no idea what the difference is, but I spoke to a chemist.
[01:26:27.659 --> 01:26:31.460]  I spoke to, uh, to... I don't know what they're called.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.101]  They're biological guys.
[01:26:33.161 --> 01:26:35.121]  They, they... A toxicologist!
[01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:36.762]  A biological toxicologist.
[01:26:36.802 --> 01:26:37.542]  Go ahead.
[01:26:37.602 --> 01:26:37.842]  Yeah.
[01:26:38.142 --> 01:26:41.103]  Ten times more deadlier than chlorine.
[01:26:41.143 --> 01:26:46.645]  So, all of Pennsylvania is going to switch from chlorine to chloramine.
[01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:56.619]  So I'd like to fax you so before when we're done, you can have your guys, you know, not hang up on me, pick up the line, give me your fax number, I'll send you this.
[01:26:57.319 --> 01:27:03.906]  And then the two things, I know it's an info war and I know that you hate for people to ask,
[01:27:04.506 --> 01:27:15.293]  But I have to ask, just basically because you have to go by your gut, and I'm much, much older than you, and I have to go by my gut, and my gut's telling me something different.
[01:27:15.353 --> 01:27:25.239]  So, what I'd like you to give me, if you can, a straight answer on, one, when does it change from an info war to a hot war?
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.122]  And two, when will the people have to fight?
[01:27:29.622 --> 01:27:30.863]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:27:31.643 --> 01:27:32.964]  Look, you're asking for a fax number?
[01:27:33.424 --> 01:27:35.005]  We never even give a fax number out.
[01:27:35.185 --> 01:27:41.028]  I know we have one here in the office, but put him on hold, and will somebody give John Harmon up there at the network our fax number?
[01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:44.010]  Because I do want to see this information this gentleman wants to send us.
[01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:47.851]  So we'll put him on hold, and then give that gentleman our fax number.
[01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:49.092]  I haven't given it out, and I forget it.
[01:27:49.112 --> 01:27:50.473]  I should have a fax number in here.
[01:27:51.093 --> 01:27:54.575]  Please, not more than four or five pages, once I do get it and give it out on air.
[01:27:56.934 --> 01:27:59.216]  Again, that is such an incredibly complex issue.
[01:27:59.636 --> 01:28:12.786]  A caller called in and brought up the government admitting that bisphenol A, BPA, is massively causing infertility in men and hyperfeminism in women.
[01:28:15.448 --> 01:28:17.970]  And I've seen some media spin it like, oh, you'll be like Wonder Woman.
[01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:22.513]  No, you'll have the breast of an 80-year-old woman when you're 30 and die of breast cancer.
[01:28:22.573 --> 01:28:23.234]  It's not fun.
[01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:24.495]  Okay?
[01:28:27.453 --> 01:28:28.514]  It's such mass murder.
[01:28:28.654 --> 01:28:31.916]  Most of us who've lost family members to cancer and other disorders like that.
[01:28:33.197 --> 01:28:33.818]  The government did it.
[01:28:34.098 --> 01:28:35.339]  The globalists did it.
[01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:36.840]  They're called eugenicists.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.881]  They've written public plans to do it.
[01:28:39.142 --> 01:28:40.623]  They're horrible murderers.
[01:28:41.663 --> 01:28:42.864]  And they've got to be dealt with.
[01:28:42.944 --> 01:28:46.647]  But you don't deal with them by saying, when do we start getting violent?
[01:28:46.667 --> 01:28:47.748]  I mean, who do you get violent with?
[01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:52.711]  The fluoride head cop down the street who's just as poisoned and brain damaged as everybody else?
[01:28:53.632 --> 01:28:55.934]  You try to wake him up and get him out of the zombie state.
[01:28:57.008 --> 01:28:58.589]  They've all are in a little zombie state.
[01:28:58.609 --> 01:29:01.089]  They've all got their little mindset of why they do what they do.
[01:29:01.349 --> 01:29:02.670]  You've got to break that shell.
[01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:06.831]  You've got to get in there and get them to see the wider world.
[01:29:08.612 --> 01:29:10.072]  You've got to expose the globalists.
[01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:13.654]  I mean, look at Ron Paul, now the leading candidate under total demonization.
[01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:14.774]  Look at where we've come.
[01:29:16.174 --> 01:29:19.516]  20 years ago, he couldn't get one co-sponsor in Congress or in the Fed.
[01:29:19.776 --> 01:29:20.716]  He passed it in the House.
[01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:22.016]  The Senate uses procedure to kill it.
[01:29:22.497 --> 01:29:23.357]  We do better next time.
[01:29:24.389 --> 01:29:26.950]  Ron Paul, if he doesn't win this time, he goes and retires.
[01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:29.270]  The idea of liberty is there.
[01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.370]  He was one focal point.
[01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:33.431]  We are succeeding.
[01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:41.293]  Look, White House memos talk about how great a new Oklahoma City would be for them to blame their political opposition.
[01:29:42.353 --> 01:29:43.534]  Now, when do you get violent?
[01:29:44.414 --> 01:29:48.075]  When someone is unjustly trying to hurt you, whoever they are.

[01:29:50.595 --> 01:29:53.601]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:03.938 --> 01:31:08.964]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:09.244 --> 01:31:10.606]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.786 --> 01:31:19.576]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:20.297 --> 01:31:27.401]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:35.445]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.845 --> 01:31:40.767]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:32:00.814 --> 01:32:02.074]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.114 --> 01:32:07.456]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.716 --> 01:32:12.338]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.718 --> 01:32:13.118]  It's true.
[01:32:13.198 --> 01:32:15.779]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:32:16.019 --> 01:32:17.760]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:23.001]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.521 --> 01:32:25.442]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.842 --> 01:32:30.443]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.643 --> 01:32:31.543]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.743 --> 01:32:34.524]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.824 --> 01:32:38.105]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.445 --> 01:32:41.286]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.626 --> 01:32:43.506]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.847 --> 01:32:44.767]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.787 --> 01:32:45.167]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.187 --> 01:32:47.928]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.428 --> 01:32:50.188]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:12.675 --> 01:33:18.078]  Who are you, you globalist crooks?
[01:33:18.158 --> 01:33:19.719]  Who are ya?
[01:33:41.067 --> 01:33:43.007]  What if I say I'm not gonna surrender?
[01:33:44.348 --> 01:33:47.068]  What if I say YOU'RE the pretender?
[01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:56.190]  What if I say 1776 is the answer to 1984?
[01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:58.991]  You're the pretender!
[01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:01.791]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:34:05.212 --> 01:34:09.893]  What if I say you're the pretender?
[01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:12.258]  I am fired up!
[01:34:12.278 --> 01:34:16.202]  You know, that last caller was asking, when do we get violent?
[01:34:17.283 --> 01:34:18.965]  The first person to shoot loses.
[01:34:20.507 --> 01:34:25.852]  We're not looking for a fight, but I'll tell you, my ideology, my worldview is not like Gandhi's.
[01:34:26.753 --> 01:34:29.296]  It's a mix of George Washington and Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:34:31.091 --> 01:34:38.773]  I understand the globalists want violence up front, and they want to characterize people who are against their tyranny as the criminals and as the disorder.
[01:34:39.213 --> 01:34:40.513]  The globalists are criminals.
[01:34:40.593 --> 01:34:48.275]  They are the disorder, hiding behind their three-piece suits, and behind their stolen billions, and the military and police that they've tried to brainwash.
[01:34:48.495 --> 01:34:53.476]  But the good news is the police and military are waking up, and you know ten years ago I wasn't saying that.
[01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:56.673]  I can go over all the evidence, but I want to go to Gerald Cilente.
[01:34:57.253 --> 01:35:03.777]  The point is, 70 plus percent of all donations for the military are to Ron Paul.
[01:35:04.118 --> 01:35:04.798]  For both parties.
[01:35:05.258 --> 01:35:06.299]  All presidential candidates.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.501]  Police are supporting Ron Paul.
[01:35:09.221 --> 01:35:16.826]  Bloomberg bemoaned it last month, saying, give this man your money so he can fire you, and pointed out, guess who gets the majority of federal employee donations?
[01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:18.487]  Ron Paul.
[01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:21.709]  That tells you the folks inside the federal government know what's going on.
[01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:23.611]  They're sitting there watching what's happening.
[01:35:24.608 --> 01:35:28.316]  They're just paymasters who pay the stolen money out to the megacorporations!
[01:35:30.438 --> 01:35:30.958]  They know.
[01:35:31.338 --> 01:35:31.839]  They know.
[01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:37.121]  In fact, it's easier to wake up military and police than anybody else because they actually live in the real world.
[01:35:37.361 --> 01:35:39.062]  They're seeing what we're talking about.
[01:35:39.302 --> 01:35:42.723]  I can't tell you how many letters I get, how many emails, how many calls.
[01:35:42.923 --> 01:35:52.027]  You've heard them, where police officers say nothing made sense, I've been on the force 20 years, 10 years, whatever the case is, until I started listening and everything I'd always questioned didn't understand.
[01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:53.148]  Now it makes perfect sense.
[01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:55.629]  You took me outside the compartmentalization.
[01:35:55.929 --> 01:35:57.490]  You didn't show me how to see.
[01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:59.251]  You pointed out what was already there.
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:01.951]  You woke me up!
[01:36:04.612 --> 01:36:06.492]  When you wake somebody up, all you do is say, get up!
[01:36:06.592 --> 01:36:08.052]  You're not doing the work, you're just, get up!
[01:36:08.232 --> 01:36:09.813]  You're up, you're awake, now you see!
[01:36:10.233 --> 01:36:11.513]  You see the same thing I see!
[01:36:12.653 --> 01:36:17.454]  You're not believing what Alex Jones is saying, you're not buying into what I'm saying, you're seeing!
[01:36:17.974 --> 01:36:19.314]  You're seeing it!
[01:36:19.334 --> 01:36:29.096]  Alright, Gerald Salente is just a great friend of the show and we really appreciate him coming on right here near the end of the year to give us
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.743]  He is 12 Trends First here.
[01:36:33.645 --> 01:36:38.912]  For our audience, you can get the full details at TrendsResearch.com, where his trend alerts and everything else are posted.
[01:36:38.933 --> 01:36:40.255]  But he's giving it to us here first.
[01:36:40.575 --> 01:36:42.878]  I tried to get him on the last two weeks, and he said, well, I'm traveling.
[01:36:43.159 --> 01:36:46.083]  Plus, Alex, I'm riding the 12 Trends deep analysis.
[01:36:47.193 --> 01:36:49.656]  I'd love to come on, but I've got to come on once this is ready.
[01:36:49.956 --> 01:36:54.582]  So you're hearing it here first, and he'll be with us, I guess, five minutes to the next hour, then he's got to go.
[01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:58.407]  But we're very honored to have Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[01:36:58.767 --> 01:37:01.130]  And I have here in my hot little hands the top 12 trends of 2012.
[01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:06.057]  But Gerald, let me ask you the question this way today.
[01:37:06.397 --> 01:37:07.378]  Because I've read over these trends.
[01:37:07.418 --> 01:37:09.859]  Some of it is new.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.022]  Some of it is, you know, basically tweaked analysis that you've already gone over.
[01:37:14.042 --> 01:37:15.863]  But a lot of this is key groundbreaking material.
[01:37:15.883 --> 01:37:20.266]  And we respect your analytical mind when it comes to this.
[01:37:20.326 --> 01:37:25.710]  But do you want to give us an MF Global update first or get into the top trends first?
[01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:29.973]  And then I want to air this clip of the head of the CME Group confirming.
[01:37:30.693 --> 01:37:36.217]  So he's gone from criticizing you to now agreeing with you and saying Corzine did take the money and is lying.
[01:37:37.358 --> 01:37:38.859]  Well, the update is this.
[01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:48.807]  So far I've gotten, um, they've reinstituted about 70% of the lost funds in my type of account.
[01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:52.750]  Having said that, it's only part of the story.
[01:37:53.390 --> 01:38:04.159]  Because what happened is, when they closed out my positions, I remember I bought gold at $1,443 an ounce that I was going to pick up in December.
[01:38:05.342 --> 01:38:11.123]  When they took all the money out, they closed the positions down the day they went bankrupt.
[01:38:12.003 --> 01:38:15.744]  And they, remember I showed you the corrected statement?
[01:38:16.204 --> 01:38:22.146]  It was now $1,765 an ounce, not $1,443.
[01:38:22.826 --> 01:38:31.828]  So, when they went bankrupt, and they closed, and my positions closed out in December, I had to sell them.
[01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:36.271]  And I didn't buy him according to them at $14.43.
[01:38:36.672 --> 01:38:38.013]  I bought him at $17.65.
[01:38:38.113 --> 01:38:41.436]  So I had to eat those losses.
[01:38:41.897 --> 01:38:44.119]  So now I have that problem on my hand.
[01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:47.122]  Now here's the best part of the deal.
[01:38:47.142 --> 01:38:51.085]  You know, I want whatever money I have, I want to get it back, right?
[01:38:52.046 --> 01:38:53.767]  So I call up the broker.
[01:38:53.827 --> 01:39:00.351]  Remember, the way they got the name broker is that you're broker than when you started.
[01:39:01.231 --> 01:39:02.652]  That's how they made the name up.
[01:39:03.233 --> 01:39:04.453]  So now I call them up.
[01:39:04.573 --> 01:39:07.535]  I said, listen, wire transfer whatever money I have in there.
[01:39:07.835 --> 01:39:08.956]  Get it into my bank.
[01:39:09.156 --> 01:39:09.737]  Check it out.
[01:39:10.257 --> 01:39:11.538]  We can't do that.
[01:39:12.418 --> 01:39:14.459]  We're gonna send you a check.
[01:39:15.239 --> 01:39:17.300]  I said, what do you mean you can't wire transfer me?
[01:39:17.541 --> 01:39:19.562]  I said, you guys never quit.
[01:39:19.982 --> 01:39:26.865]  You're really quick to take the money when I wire transfer it in, but you won't get it out.
[01:39:27.966 --> 01:39:28.146]  So...
[01:39:29.332 --> 01:39:31.133]  They won't wire transfer the money.
[01:39:31.153 --> 01:39:33.375]  I haven't received it yet.
[01:39:33.735 --> 01:39:35.557]  And now you know that story.
[01:39:35.957 --> 01:39:39.500]  Now it takes time for the check to clear and on and on.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:54.651]  Now, in saying this, it's very important because, as you well know, I went public with this to warn people that what you think you have in your account really isn't yours.
[01:39:55.432 --> 01:39:58.735]  Because they have all of these loopholes in place
[01:39:59.395 --> 01:40:04.596]  Where your money is only as safe as the last loophole that they put in.
[01:40:05.176 --> 01:40:07.017]  And I don't care who it's with.
[01:40:07.857 --> 01:40:09.257]  It makes no difference.
[01:40:09.277 --> 01:40:18.260]  By the way, I tried to go to a local bank and follow my own advice and get out some cash and it wasn't even, quote, above the amount where they file a FinCEN deal.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:27.667]  And they acted like my wife was a crook, freaked out, and then started calling me saying, we need to know your wife's occupation.
[01:40:27.727 --> 01:40:30.950]  It's got to go in the Federal Financial Crimes Enforcement file.
[01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:33.352]  And I'm like, for less than $10,000?
[01:40:33.392 --> 01:40:34.013]  But even if it was $10,000...
[01:40:36.955 --> 01:40:37.935]  I mean, what on earth?
[01:40:38.015 --> 01:40:41.216]  I mean, this country is a giant prison, Gerald.
[01:40:41.596 --> 01:40:43.456]  Everywhere you're treated like trash.
[01:40:43.897 --> 01:40:48.958]  And then all these little people, they get off on enforcing it on others.
[01:40:49.598 --> 01:40:50.058]  It's sick.
[01:40:50.098 --> 01:40:51.598]  It's like a nation of maggots.
[01:40:52.498 --> 01:40:53.619]  You know, you really hit on it.
[01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:58.580]  You know, as I've been saying, you know, your money isn't yours unless you have it.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.040]  End of story.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:04.341]  Last Wednesday, I called up HSBC.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:13.342]  And I told them that I was coming in Thursday morning at 9.30 in the morning to make a withdrawal.
[01:41:13.622 --> 01:41:14.642]  I gave them the amount.
[01:41:16.323 --> 01:41:21.784]  They said they only could give it to me in hundreds and fifties if I wanted to wait until Monday I could get it in hundreds.
[01:41:21.844 --> 01:41:24.225]  I said, that's fine, I'll take it in hundred and fifties.
[01:41:25.005 --> 01:41:29.547]  I couldn't make it at 9.30, I had my assistant call him up, Mrs. Slenty will be in at 2.30.
[01:41:31.272 --> 01:41:38.575]  I go there with the check, hand it to the person I was talking to on the phone, it was like I never called.
[01:41:39.335 --> 01:41:48.439]  Now they tell me I have to go over, I have this video on our site, I have to go over and talk to the bank manager.
[01:41:49.559 --> 01:41:57.643]  I go over there, I sit down, she looks at me, and you talked about it, these power-hungry little people, she said to me,
[01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:02.192]  This is a sizable amount of money.
[01:42:03.232 --> 01:42:05.592]  What are you going to use it for?
[01:42:06.593 --> 01:42:10.334]  So I said, how about none of your business?
[01:42:10.354 --> 01:42:13.794]  He said, that's not very friendly.
[01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:17.575]  I said, how about none of your effing business?
[01:42:18.976 --> 01:42:24.697]  How dare you ask me what I'm going to do with my money?
[01:42:26.072 --> 01:42:28.093]  She said, well you have to comply.
[01:42:28.413 --> 01:42:34.877]  I said, you didn't ask me how I got the money in there, and now you're asking me what I'm gonna do with it?
[01:42:34.917 --> 01:42:36.017]  They're saying you're a criminal.
[01:42:36.037 --> 01:42:37.618]  They imply you're a criminal.
[01:42:38.179 --> 01:42:38.799]  Exactly.
[01:42:39.759 --> 01:42:41.961]  This went on for 40 minutes.
[01:42:43.061 --> 01:42:47.283]  I'm talking to people all over the HSBC chain.
[01:42:47.744 --> 01:42:49.885]  First she tells me to leave the office.
[01:42:50.225 --> 01:42:52.746]  She has to talk to compliance officers.
[01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:55.008]  Yeah, that's like these people that get arrested now.
[01:42:56.385 --> 01:42:57.987]  For trying to get their own money out.
[01:42:58.187 --> 01:43:01.470]  Wait, wait, are you saying you have a video where you break this down or there's video of this?
[01:43:01.671 --> 01:43:03.613]  No, no, I have video where I break it down.
[01:43:03.633 --> 01:43:04.994]  I wish I did have a video.
[01:43:05.014 --> 01:43:05.955]  You want to go back in there?
[01:43:06.015 --> 01:43:07.837]  Oh my God, tell us what else happened, Gerald.
[01:43:07.857 --> 01:43:09.058]  Break this, oh my gosh.
[01:43:09.639 --> 01:43:10.800]  And I'll tell you her name.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.422]  Her name was Penny Demo.
[01:43:13.283 --> 01:43:14.784]  Tried demolition.
[01:43:15.165 --> 01:43:18.548]  And I told her, I said, you know, I'm going to make you famous.
[01:43:19.349 --> 01:43:35.929]  I'm gonna tell everybody what a jerk you are and how dare you ask me what I do with my money and now you're telling me you have to make a call to somebody and I can't be in the room as you talk about my money.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.803]  Said, ah, this goes on and it goes on, and I'm demanding to talk to other people.
[01:43:42.163 --> 01:43:48.928]  I get some woman, said, Mr. Sellenti now, you should have called the bank up ahead of time.
[01:43:49.188 --> 01:43:50.549]  I said, I called yesterday.
[01:43:50.889 --> 01:43:52.650]  My assistant called again today.
[01:43:53.130 --> 01:44:00.255]  She said, but we have to, we have to know what you're doing with your money.
[01:44:01.175 --> 01:44:01.896]  I said, listen,
[01:44:03.277 --> 01:44:05.678]  If she didn't tell you, I'll tell you.
[01:44:06.379 --> 01:44:12.422]  It's none of your damn business what I do with my money.
[01:44:12.742 --> 01:44:17.364]  Now listen, I know I could have said, I'm gonna buy a car, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that.
[01:44:17.804 --> 01:44:20.265]  I said screw this, I'm not telling him anything.
[01:44:20.626 --> 01:44:25.208]  She said to me, well Uncle Sam wants to know.
[01:44:25.828 --> 01:44:26.689]  I said listen,
[01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:31.994]  Tell Uncle Sam to give me a call and we could talk about it.
[01:44:32.014 --> 01:44:32.915]  Well, let's stop right there.
[01:44:33.136 --> 01:44:34.918]  I did the same thing, but I didn't go in.
[01:44:35.278 --> 01:44:40.664]  I came in here Friday so angry that I was bouncing off the walls because they were calling me over and over again.
[01:44:40.704 --> 01:44:46.471]  Thursday, I finally start talking to him at this local bank and the guy's like, sir, we've got to fill out this report on you to the feds.
[01:44:46.511 --> 01:44:46.892]  And I'm like,
[01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:49.831]  Well, why is it in either business?
[01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:51.812]  He goes, sir, we're not spying on you.
[01:44:52.172 --> 01:44:53.872]  And I said, what do you mean you're not spying?
[01:44:53.892 --> 01:44:56.133]  You got to fill a report out to me on the feds.
[01:44:56.153 --> 01:44:59.095]  He goes, well, new rules are coming in and blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:59.115 --> 01:45:00.655]  I said, I thought it was above this amount.
[01:45:00.695 --> 01:45:01.816]  This is below that amount.
[01:45:02.376 --> 01:45:03.296]  We're sorry, sir.
[01:45:03.336 --> 01:45:04.197]  Don't be paranoid.
[01:45:04.257 --> 01:45:05.837]  We know about your radio show.
[01:45:06.218 --> 01:45:10.539]  Oh, so I'm the paranoid one that in America, this isn't even that much money.
[01:45:10.559 --> 01:45:13.180]  I mean, I might be able to buy a golf cart with it, maybe.
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.081]  I mean, not even a car.
[01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:20.125]  That in America, I can't even get some cash out without being treated like trash.
[01:45:20.525 --> 01:45:27.010]  And that's what this whole system is about, with Patriot Act compliance, is turning everybody into little agents, having them all spy.
[01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:28.531]  So then I start yelling at them.
[01:45:29.192 --> 01:45:30.292]  It was in the morning at home.
[01:45:30.573 --> 01:45:31.733]  My wife runs in, what's wrong?
[01:45:31.774 --> 01:45:32.714]  I say, you talk to him.
[01:45:32.734 --> 01:45:33.395]  She calls him back.
[01:45:33.715 --> 01:45:36.117]  She starts yelling because they start telling her she's paranoid.
[01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:37.538]  Then I call them back.
[01:45:37.838 --> 01:45:38.939]  Then they're acting all weird.
[01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.100]  Then they wouldn't come to the phone.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:41.360]  Yeah, I got my money.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:47.223]  But what I'm telling you, and this is why I kept going public with what's going on, they don't have the money!
[01:46:08.533 --> 01:46:13.179]  Yeah, they have the money, but they need your money so they can keep gambling.
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.922]  Doesn't anybody get it?
[01:46:15.422 --> 01:46:23.873]  That's why, that's why the CME Group, although that big mouth Clarence Terry is saying that Terrence Duffy...
[01:46:24.594 --> 01:46:27.537]  Is saying that they have a hundred billion dollars.
[01:46:27.797 --> 01:46:31.941]  They couldn't come up with 1.2 billion to cover the bad bets.
[01:46:32.461 --> 01:46:38.487]  That's like all of Las Vegas closing down because one casino can't cover the bets.
[01:46:38.947 --> 01:46:40.709]  They don't have the money.
[01:46:41.309 --> 01:46:47.914]  This whole thing is financially leveraged beyond what Ponzi could have ever imagined.
[01:46:48.014 --> 01:47:00.543]  So what they're doing is they're trying to make it as impossible as it can be for you to get your hands on your money because they need it to gamble.
[01:47:01.063 --> 01:47:07.908]  So what I'm telling everybody is if you don't have your money in your pocket, you don't own it.
[01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:08.888]  Period!
[01:47:08.988 --> 01:47:09.749]  Paragraph!
[01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:19.432]  And as I said, the first trend, and I broke it on your station, before anybody else, I told you, watch out for economic martial law.
[01:47:19.772 --> 01:47:20.452]  It's coming!
[01:47:21.873 --> 01:47:23.833]  Well, that is trend number one, and I thought we only had you for 30.
[01:47:24.113 --> 01:47:28.655]  You've been gracious enough, Jaron, told me in my ear, you've said you're staying a little bit into the next hour, so that's, that's good news.
[01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:35.497]  And I want to go over these, but in closing to the guy, I said, I'm not going to tell you what my wife does here at my company.
[01:47:35.537 --> 01:47:37.598]  I said, this is a private checking account.
[01:47:38.098 --> 01:47:39.480]  This is after tax money.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:43.284]  This is how we pay for, you know, our gas, our food, everything.
[01:47:43.644 --> 01:47:45.927]  This is how we pay for babysitters.
[01:47:45.947 --> 01:47:48.549]  I said, you understand this is a private checking account.
[01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:50.091]  And he said, I still need to know this.
[01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:50.872]  I need to know that.
[01:47:50.932 --> 01:47:53.515]  And, you know, we have to tell the feds what you're doing with the money.
[01:47:54.155 --> 01:47:55.076]  And I said to the guy,
[01:47:55.797 --> 01:48:02.822]  I said to him, I said, you tell them then I'm not a criminal like them caught laundering trillions of dollars of drug money in the last decade.
[01:48:03.203 --> 01:48:09.067]  I'm not like Wells Fargo caught laundering $376 billion, source Bloomberg AP.
[01:48:09.507 --> 01:48:13.690]  I said, I'm not like the big banks that run this country and have stolen trillions of dollars.
[01:48:13.971 --> 01:48:21.076]  I said, you realize I'm in a little local bank because the big mega banks are the ones that run the country and run the Ponzi scheme.
[01:48:21.396 --> 01:48:23.337]  And the guy finally said, yes, I understand.
[01:48:24.138 --> 01:48:27.359]  I apologize for implying that we're not spying on you.
[01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:44.728]  We're good to go.
[01:49:01.983 --> 01:49:03.584]  That's what my wife said.
[01:49:03.724 --> 01:49:06.505]  This is my money and they won't give it to me.
[01:49:06.625 --> 01:49:13.487]  Oh, by the way, I wrote about this before when I used to deal with Key Bank.
[01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:24.972]  It was the same bunch of crap and I brought one of my colleagues with me when it started getting really ugly so I would have proof.
[01:49:25.672 --> 01:49:27.295]  They don't have the money.
[01:49:27.576 --> 01:49:29.239]  They don't want to give it to you.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.405]  And I'm warning everybody, do what you want to do.
[01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:33.547]  I could care less.
[01:49:34.028 --> 01:49:35.330]  All I'm saying is...
[01:49:36.633 --> 01:49:38.154]  They're gonna screw you!
[01:49:39.194 --> 01:49:43.435]  And these are, and you keep using the word globally, on and on.
[01:49:43.756 --> 01:49:46.657]  Let's make it really clear during this Christmas time.
[01:49:47.317 --> 01:49:58.241]  The only time that Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, became violent is when he picked up a whip to drive the money changers out of the temple!
[01:49:58.901 --> 01:50:01.622]  If Jesus Christ become violent,
[01:50:02.342 --> 01:50:06.883]  I could become angry when the money changers are giving it to me!
[01:50:07.424 --> 01:50:16.186]  And the money changers now are in charge of every temple in Athens, in Rome, in Washington.
[01:50:16.626 --> 01:50:29.290]  It's the bankers, the criminals that Christ violently beat out of the temple that are ripping this nation and the world apart because they're money junkies.
[01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.650]  They're addicts!
[01:50:30.971 --> 01:50:32.211]  They can't get enough!
[01:50:33.091 --> 01:50:36.533]  We're about to go to break, but in 20 seconds, how long did it take for you to get your money?
[01:50:36.553 --> 01:50:37.633]  You had to go get witnesses?
[01:50:37.653 --> 01:50:39.074]  40 minutes!
[01:50:39.094 --> 01:50:41.795]  40 minutes it took me to get my money!
[01:50:43.622 --> 01:50:49.268]  I'd find out what they put in that report to Papa Fed.
[01:50:49.768 --> 01:50:55.794]  I tell you, we've got to fill out a report to give it to the criminals that grow the opium in Afghanistan, known as the U.S.
[01:50:55.834 --> 01:50:56.234]  government.
[01:50:56.995 --> 01:50:58.096]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[01:50:58.116 --> 01:50:59.618]  We'll get into his top trends straight ahead.
[01:50:59.638 --> 01:51:00.939]  He's with us into the next hour.
[01:51:00.979 --> 01:51:01.399]  Then your calls.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:02.640]  Warning!
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:08.782]  The unprepared may not survive the next natural disaster, terrorist attack, pandemic, or economic collapse.
[01:51:09.022 --> 01:51:16.464]  In light of recent global unrest and natural disasters, we bring you this urgent message from David Morris, author of the acclaimed Urban Survival Course.
[01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:20.605]  Because this message is urgent, we won't waste time on the why you should act now.
[01:51:20.805 --> 01:51:21.845]  You already know why.
[01:51:22.065 --> 01:51:25.466]  It's the very real and growing dangers reported in the media every day.
[01:51:25.706 --> 01:51:27.147]  Now it's the what you must do.

[01:51:51.984 --> 01:51:52.665]  Or call 800-366-5138.
[01:51:52.685 --> 01:51:52.725]  800-366-5138.
[01:51:52.785 --> 01:51:53.606]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:52:03.638 --> 01:52:07.680]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:11.081]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:52:11.441 --> 01:52:15.523]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[01:52:15.843 --> 01:52:16.423]  Here's why.
[01:52:16.844 --> 01:52:22.646]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:52:22.966 --> 01:52:27.448]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:52:27.828 --> 01:52:33.912]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:52:34.212 --> 01:52:37.795]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:52:38.055 --> 01:52:43.619]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:52:43.999 --> 01:52:49.362]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:52:49.623 --> 01:52:52.465]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[01:52:52.625 --> 01:52:54.886]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:53:02.050 --> 01:53:05.772]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:12.295]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:12.435 --> 01:53:16.017]  Go to MySafeDoor.com right now and watch the amazing video.
[01:53:16.177 --> 01:53:20.999]  At MySafeDoor.com, you'll learn how to turn your home into a fortress with the Door Sentinel.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:22.240]  16 kicks later...
[01:53:23.925 --> 01:53:26.249]  And the door sentinel is still holding strong.
[01:53:26.429 --> 01:53:27.732]  MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:27.832 --> 01:53:29.314]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:31.210]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:35.773]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:35.953 --> 01:53:41.677]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:41.777 --> 01:53:45.179]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:45.419 --> 01:53:48.021]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:48.241 --> 01:53:53.044]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:53:53.184 --> 01:53:53.425]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:53.485 --> 01:53:54.826]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:05.251 --> 01:54:10.373]  Alright, we've only got Gerald 15 to the next hour, then I'll finish up with the callers that are holding, then I'm gonna get into Iran.
[01:54:11.253 --> 01:54:13.754]  And boy, they are really trying to prod Iran into action.
[01:54:13.794 --> 01:54:15.915]  Iran's doing a bunch of drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:54:16.635 --> 01:54:17.876]  I've got Ron Paul news.
[01:54:19.332 --> 01:54:20.773]  And a bunch of other economic news.
[01:54:20.813 --> 01:54:22.073]  Gerald Salente is our guest.

[01:54:28.937 --> 01:54:32.819]  Also, if you go to Infowars.com, we've got three new films we're carrying.
[01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:38.801]  We've got A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, exposing that false flag event like no other film's ever done.
[01:54:39.422 --> 01:54:43.724]  Scientists Under Attack, Genetic Engineering, and The Magnetic Field of Money, where they persecute these scientists.
[01:54:43.784 --> 01:54:44.544]  Very powerful.
[01:54:45.105 --> 01:54:47.366]  And Outside the Law, stories from Guantanamo.
[01:54:48.126 --> 01:54:51.047]  By the way, has Obama signed NDAA yet?
[01:54:51.307 --> 01:54:52.967]  Guys, Google Obama NDAA.
[01:54:53.068 --> 01:54:55.148]  He's supposed to sign it today or tomorrow.
[01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:56.128]  He says he's going to sign it.
[01:54:57.029 --> 01:54:59.730]  We're going to get more trends from Gerald here in a moment.
[01:55:00.630 --> 01:55:13.854]  It is your purchase of the books and videos at Infowars.com that funds much of this growing media operation in the face of the globalists, in the face of the money junkies, the criminals, the money-changing cartel, the Ponzi operators.
[01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:17.036]  But don't forget, we also have the Everything Special.
[01:55:17.517 --> 01:55:25.784]  You can get all 18 of my films for 70 plus percent off, $99.95 instead of $360 at Infowars.com.
[01:55:25.804 --> 01:55:29.848]  That special is going until the end of the year, and I want to thank all of you for your support.
[01:55:30.328 --> 01:55:34.392]  Okay, going back to Gerald, we only got about five minutes in this little segment, and the next hour starts.
[01:55:35.153 --> 01:55:38.799]  Let's start getting into more of your economic trends, Gerald.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:47.435]  Economic martial law, they're even calling it that now, months and months after you first started using that about a year ago, they're calling it that in multiple states now.
[01:55:48.786 --> 01:55:52.528]  Yes, and you have to really look at what's going on over in Europe.
[01:55:52.948 --> 01:55:55.289]  Hungary is a real close one to watch.
[01:55:55.869 --> 01:55:57.670]  They're in real financial trouble.
[01:55:58.490 --> 01:56:04.233]  They can't even meet the IMF, the International Mafia Federation's demands to get more money.
[01:56:06.434 --> 01:56:07.535]  Liberty is gone.
[01:56:08.055 --> 01:56:10.177]  Freedom of the speech, they're taking over.
[01:56:10.978 --> 01:56:13.419]  This new government is taking over the government.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.721]  So that's a model to watch.
[01:56:16.161 --> 01:56:27.290]  Because all throughout Europe, what they're doing, as the economic systems collapse, they're throwing more and more actual martial law on top of the people to keep them in control.
[01:56:27.850 --> 01:56:38.313]  When this system finally implodes, and we believe it's going to happen, in Europe, the first quarter of 2012, they're going to call bank holidays.
[01:56:39.114 --> 01:56:52.138]  There's a videotape that you could, anybody could Google it up, we sent it to you, of Joe Biden talking to Corzine, when Corzine was running for re-election of governor, 2009, June.
[01:56:55.479 --> 01:57:05.947]  And I said that when Obama got elected, the economy was so bad that they might call a... Alright, we just lost our Skype connection.
[01:57:05.967 --> 01:57:06.667]  Bank holiday.
[01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:10.410]  Your Skype cut out for a moment.
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:11.171]  Repeat that, Gerald.
[01:57:15.882 --> 01:57:16.684]  Gerald, you're back.
[01:57:16.904 --> 01:57:17.445]  Go ahead.
[01:57:18.066 --> 01:57:19.188]  Yeah, you cut out for a moment.
[01:57:19.228 --> 01:57:19.669]  Repeat that.
[01:57:19.689 --> 01:57:22.795]  You said that they were talking about declaring a bank holiday.
[01:57:23.156 --> 01:57:23.697]  That's right.
[01:57:23.997 --> 01:57:24.799]  This is June 2009.
[01:57:24.879 --> 01:57:25.640]  Biden's words are...
[01:57:30.293 --> 01:57:41.860]  As soon as we got sworn in, the first thing at the top of our list, we had the transition team there and 30 economists, was whether or not to call a bank holiday!
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.121]  This is no holiday, folks.
[01:57:44.602 --> 01:57:45.962]  You can't get your money!
[01:57:46.343 --> 01:57:48.264]  You think it's bad trying to get it now?
[01:57:48.604 --> 01:57:49.565]  You can't get any of it.
[01:57:49.885 --> 01:57:53.807]  And when you do get it, they'll do like they did the last time they called a bank holiday.
[01:57:54.268 --> 01:57:56.089]  They'll devalue the currency.
[01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:58.310]  So that's what we're warning.
[01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:00.731]  They've already said they were going to do it.
[01:58:00.951 --> 01:58:07.614]  Now, remember, Alex, that happened before there was a European crisis.
[01:58:08.255 --> 01:58:12.977]  That happened before the United States was $15 trillion in debt.
[01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:26.487]  That happened before the Federal Reserve, when you add it all up, pumped in $26 trillion into the Ponzi scheme to keep it afloat.
[01:58:26.607 --> 01:58:27.688]  Yeah, we have that clip.
[01:58:27.928 --> 01:58:29.530]  I know Kurt Nimmo wrote an article about it.
[01:58:29.590 --> 01:58:31.491]  If we can remember the headline, we'll dig that up.
[01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:39.497]  We also have the head of the CMT coming out, or CME coming out, and talking about Corzine.
[01:58:39.517 --> 01:58:39.897]  Stay there.
[01:58:41.779 --> 01:58:42.999]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.112 --> 01:59:06.576]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:59:07.577 --> 01:59:11.258]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:12.273 --> 01:59:24.284]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:59:25.025 --> 01:59:32.311]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:59:32.992 --> 01:59:42.578]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:59:43.359 --> 01:59:46.621]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[01:59:54.205 --> 01:59:56.147]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.607 --> 01:59:59.349]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.936 --> 02:00:10.117]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.757 --> 02:00:11.577]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.357 --> 02:00:13.197]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.917 --> 02:00:17.478]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.078 --> 02:00:22.199]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.799 --> 02:00:27.960]  Top Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente is our guest for this segment and part of the next.
[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:33.161]  In the next segment, I'm going to play the clip of the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
[02:00:34.682 --> 02:00:41.528]  A month after denying Corzine a runoff of the money, changing his testimony and saying he did know where it went and ordered it.
[02:00:41.949 --> 02:00:51.757]  And then we're going to play the clip that Gerald was just mentioning, but we're queuing it up right now to write when Biden says it, that they were talking about a bank holiday with their advisor, Corzine.
[02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:54.079]  But we're going to come back to that in a moment.
[02:00:54.319 --> 02:00:59.304]  Let's hurry through some of the other top 12 trends, then we'll revisit those clips at the end of the interview.
[02:00:59.924 --> 02:01:01.446]  Battlefield America, Gerald.
[02:01:03.712 --> 02:01:05.033]  Economic Martial Law.
[02:01:05.554 --> 02:01:10.358]  They've taken our rights away from us with the National Defense Authorization Act.
[02:01:10.898 --> 02:01:14.981]  Everyone that's read it knows it, or read the information coming out about it.
[02:01:15.442 --> 02:01:23.589]  So my belief is that this system is breaking down and they're ready now to make sure that we don't get out of line.
[02:01:24.029 --> 02:01:27.392]  So Battlefield America, here we are.
[02:01:27.712 --> 02:01:29.213]  That's what Lindsey that
[02:01:30.134 --> 02:01:36.420]  Cracker from North Carolina, South Carolina calls America, and that's what they're making it.
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:41.805]  So, the battlefield is lining up so that they could instill martial law.
[02:01:42.065 --> 02:01:48.571]  And also, very important, Alex, is that these people are not as stupid as we think they are.
[02:01:49.011 --> 02:02:03.576]  They know what's going on and they're just playing a con game to keep us calm as they keep moving forward to rip us off more and more and subject us deeper and deeper into their psychopathic sickness.
[02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:07.631]  By the way, it got no attention.
[02:02:08.692 --> 02:02:12.775]  Obama signed it Friday, and I did Google searches and couldn't find it.
[02:02:12.795 --> 02:02:14.336]  The guys just found it Politico.
[02:02:14.916 --> 02:02:22.561]  It was a minor footnote in an article on Politico with no headline associated with it that Obama signed it.
[02:02:22.861 --> 02:02:26.463]  So they even signed it and didn't want the public to know.
[02:02:27.984 --> 02:02:28.845]  Yeah, I didn't know.
[02:02:28.925 --> 02:02:30.166]  I didn't know he signed it either.
[02:02:31.578 --> 02:02:33.140]  Yeah, I've got the signing statement right here.
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.325]  And this never made the major news.
[02:02:38.745 --> 02:02:54.421]  It was buried on page A31 in the bottom corner of the toilet paper of record, the New York Times, with a bland headline that mentioned nothing about what this law did.
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:00.402]  Wow, but they know they're going to end up devaluing the money and stealing it.
[02:03:00.582 --> 02:03:02.824]  And I guess they think the military is going to protect them?
[02:03:03.124 --> 02:03:06.286]  What's going to happen when the military's checks don't cash?
[02:03:07.227 --> 02:03:14.331]  Well, you know, the military, though, whatever happens in this country, it's happening like they happen in other third world countries.
[02:03:14.732 --> 02:03:20.255]  The military and the police become the enforcers for the criminal crime bosses.
[02:03:20.576 --> 02:03:25.359]  They'll steal enough to pay them because they'll get every nickel out of us.
[02:03:27.956 --> 02:03:31.017]  Let's continue into your third trend.
[02:03:31.317 --> 02:03:34.818]  Let's get into invasion of the Occupy.
[02:03:35.678 --> 02:03:37.439]  Yes, this is really huge.
[02:03:37.499 --> 02:03:46.801]  What's happened with the Occupy, we call it an octopi, a tentacle creature that's reaching out all over the world.
[02:03:47.201 --> 02:03:52.843]  Its strength is that it doesn't have a head to cut off, like a Julian Assange.
[02:03:53.343 --> 02:03:59.566]  WikiLeaks is putting out valuable information, but when they cut the head off, the information died.
[02:03:59.906 --> 02:04:05.869]  This octopi is a symptom of the war that's going on worldwide.
[02:04:06.309 --> 02:04:13.653]  As I said before, when the money stops flowing down to the man on the street, the blood starts flowing in the streets.
[02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.894]  These octopi's are in
[02:04:16.734 --> 02:04:20.557]  80 countries in 1,200 different cities.
[02:04:20.898 --> 02:04:22.679]  They're going to continue.
[02:04:22.999 --> 02:04:28.623]  And when you cut off one tentacle, another one grows and the old one regenerates.
[02:04:29.004 --> 02:04:35.128]  This is the beginning of that movement, Alex, that may change things in another direction.
[02:04:35.328 --> 02:04:39.832]  Okay, let's race through the other seven or eight points.
[02:04:39.892 --> 02:04:40.953]  Climax time.
[02:04:41.473 --> 02:04:42.734]  Technocrat takeover.
[02:04:44.075 --> 02:04:44.936]  Repatriate.
[02:04:46.587 --> 02:04:55.173]  Secession Obsession, Safe Havens, Big Brother Internet, Direct vs. Fox Democracy, Alternative Energy 2012.
[02:04:56.754 --> 02:04:57.154]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.174 --> 02:04:57.774]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:57.834 --> 02:04:59.115]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[02:05:01.215 --> 02:05:02.436]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.796 --> 02:05:08.600]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:12.722]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[02:05:13.123 --> 02:05:16.325]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.

[02:05:47.185 --> 02:05:51.307]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:51.327 --> 02:05:55.049]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:56.710]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:06:17.335 --> 02:06:28.216]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:06:30.496 --> 02:06:34.379]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:38.202]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.923 --> 02:06:39.744]  Others don't.
[02:06:40.164 --> 02:06:42.045]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:42.306 --> 02:06:43.807]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:44.087 --> 02:06:46.649]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.969 --> 02:06:51.033]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[02:06:58.679 --> 02:06:59.560]  Others don't.
[02:07:03.607 --> 02:07:04.147]  Other police action.
[02:07:04.928 --> 02:07:05.849]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:09.711]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.731 --> 02:07:12.333]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.353 --> 02:07:17.797]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.217 --> 02:07:24.442]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.882 --> 02:07:30.444]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.844 --> 02:07:34.525]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:35.025 --> 02:07:39.006]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.326 --> 02:07:44.828]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.268 --> 02:07:48.229]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.829 --> 02:07:50.230]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:51.230]  It's here.

[02:08:01.054 --> 02:08:16.481]  I mean, literally, one of the early discussions we had in Chicago in preparation for the administration, our transition team out there, we got together, I think it was 30, 35 economists, all left, right, center, and what do we talk about?
[02:08:16.501 --> 02:08:20.223]  The first question they want to raise with us is whether we might have to call a bank holiday.
[02:08:21.147 --> 02:08:25.049]  A bank holiday on the day after we were sworn in.
[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:30.832]  Ladies and gentlemen, the President and I weren't back there blaming John Corzine.
[02:08:30.872 --> 02:08:31.753]  They know what we were doing.
[02:08:32.173 --> 02:08:34.935]  We were on the phone calling John Corzine.
[02:08:35.455 --> 02:08:35.895]  Literally.
[02:08:36.555 --> 02:08:49.302]  I literally picked up the phone and called John Corzine and said, John, what do you think we should do?
[02:08:49.382 --> 02:08:50.023]  Big Brother.
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.721]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:54.222 --> 02:08:55.343]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:56.765 --> 02:08:57.786]  You want answers?
[02:08:58.726 --> 02:08:59.727]  Well, so does he.
[02:09:00.668 --> 02:09:07.014]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:08.319 --> 02:09:12.365]  Alright, it's our final segment with Gerald Cilente and then I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:09:12.966 --> 02:09:14.868]  I have the signing statement, buried.
[02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:17.632]  I couldn't find it, the guys found it.
[02:09:17.672 --> 02:09:21.177]  I mean, no one that I knew talked about the fact that Obama signed this last Friday.
[02:09:22.453 --> 02:09:24.476]  I guess going into a Christmas weekend, nobody noticed.
[02:09:25.056 --> 02:09:28.560]  Gerald Salente of TrendsResearch.com is with us going over his top 12 trends.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:34.546]  He says he'll come back for a full hour before the year ends or early next week to really break these down.
[02:09:34.587 --> 02:09:36.148]  But he mentioned that clip.
[02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:41.934]  Yeah, there's Corzine, the former head of MF Global, the former head of Goldman Sachs, the global kingpins.
[02:09:42.655 --> 02:09:45.659]  And, uh, I don't blame Goldman Sachs for what happened.
[02:09:45.739 --> 02:09:47.982]  I called them and asked them how to fix it.
[02:09:48.342 --> 02:09:50.705]  Yeah, they really know how to fix things, don't they, Gerald?
[02:09:51.126 --> 02:09:52.187]  Oh yeah, they're great at it.
[02:09:52.548 --> 02:09:54.010]  And remember that clip, Alex.
[02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:55.431]  That was great that you played it.
[02:09:55.952 --> 02:09:57.013]  Think of what that means.
[02:09:57.033 --> 02:09:58.275]  A bank holiday?
[02:09:58.555 --> 02:09:59.617]  This is no holiday.
[02:10:00.117 --> 02:10:02.338]  You want to hear an Orwellian word, that's one.
[02:10:02.718 --> 02:10:05.579]  Do you realize what this country will look like?
[02:10:05.999 --> 02:10:08.359]  With people not being able to go to work?
[02:10:08.659 --> 02:10:10.340]  With the banks closed?
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.481]  With mayhem and bedlam?
[02:10:13.601 --> 02:10:16.922]  All hell will break loose and then they'll get to use the military they've got.
[02:10:17.702 --> 02:10:18.662]  You got it!
[02:10:19.163 --> 02:10:21.724]  That's why they pushed this through!
[02:10:22.304 --> 02:10:29.126]  So they'll have all the people in place to crush any rebellion or outrage.
[02:10:29.506 --> 02:10:32.267]  When, could you imagine, who did we call?
[02:10:32.748 --> 02:10:39.870]  John, I can't find 1.2 billion dollars cause line to help us fix this thing.
[02:10:40.110 --> 02:10:41.651]  Who could get away with this crap?
[02:10:43.244 --> 02:10:47.886]  Now, let's talk about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[02:10:48.106 --> 02:11:02.612]  Their head, a month and a half ago, criticized you, but since then he's come out, Mr. Duffy, before Congress at the same hearing as Corzine, and said that, hey, what you were told by him is not true.
[02:11:02.973 --> 02:11:05.934]  Our people were talking to him and at the meetings he knows where the money went.
[02:11:07.049 --> 02:11:18.388]  Everybody I know in the business, and I know guys that had firms, I know guys whose names I can't mention, top guys, laughed when they heard Corzine.
[02:11:19.716 --> 02:11:26.244]  Repeat the alibi that his mouthpieces fed him to the Senate at the last hearing.
[02:11:26.344 --> 02:11:29.448]  And here's what I like the best about the whole charade.
[02:11:29.468 --> 02:11:32.131]  Do you see the plaque in front of his name?
[02:11:32.732 --> 02:11:35.495]  The Honorable John Corzine!
[02:11:36.316 --> 02:11:38.999]  The Honorable John Corzine!
[02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:41.430]  This is what's going on.
[02:11:41.490 --> 02:11:42.831]  It's just a front.
[02:11:43.511 --> 02:11:45.812]  Corzine doesn't do any time.
[02:11:46.213 --> 02:11:48.814]  The feds aren't busting down his door.
[02:11:49.194 --> 02:11:50.575]  I can't get my money.
[02:11:50.875 --> 02:11:53.257]  You can't get your money that's our money.
[02:11:53.597 --> 02:11:59.160]  But Corzine can't find 1.2 billion dollars and the cat's honorable.
[02:11:59.701 --> 02:12:02.262]  So no, Alex, the whole thing is collapsing.
[02:12:02.702 --> 02:12:05.024]  That tape that you played proves it.
[02:12:05.604 --> 02:12:06.745]  A bank holiday.
[02:12:07.065 --> 02:12:08.586]  That should be headline news.
[02:12:08.686 --> 02:12:11.968]  And by the way, Ron Paul gets criticized for saying something like that's coming.
[02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:13.389]  He's on the banking committee.
[02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:14.430]  He knows it's being discussed.
[02:12:14.710 --> 02:12:19.634]  You've got to leave in a minute, but you've agreed to come on later in the week to go over the rest of your 12 points.
[02:12:20.054 --> 02:12:22.796]  But briefly, I want to play Terrence Duffy two weeks ago.
[02:12:24.158 --> 02:12:33.909]  Proving that Corzine's lying and Corzine has still not gotten in any trouble and his former deputy was over the federal agency that allowed this and has disappeared.
[02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:36.993]  But the media doesn't care about that because they're bought and paid for.
[02:12:37.273 --> 02:12:39.816]  They're whores, bought and paid for by these people.
[02:12:39.836 --> 02:12:40.998]  They're not media.
[02:12:41.198 --> 02:12:41.779]  Here's the clip.
[02:12:42.199 --> 02:12:54.664]  After receiving this information, CME remained at MF Global while MF Global attempted to identify funds that could be transferred into segregation to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy.
[02:12:55.784 --> 02:13:09.829]  A CME auditor also participated in a phone call with senior MF Global employees wherein one employee indicated that Mr. Corzine knew about the loans that had been made from the customer segregated accounts.
[02:13:12.029 --> 02:13:20.658]  CME Group has provided this information to these individuals to the Department of Justice and the CFTC who are investigating these matters.
[02:13:21.846 --> 02:13:24.887]  All right, so, understand something, folks.
[02:13:24.907 --> 02:13:28.347]  That's the whole mercantile exchange above this who had their people in there.
[02:13:28.907 --> 02:13:34.549]  Now, obviously, if Gerald Solente's pulling out, you know, $15,000 or whatever it was, and they're freaking out.
[02:13:34.589 --> 02:13:36.889]  If I'm pulling out $5,000, they're freaking out.
[02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.350]  Oh, but they don't know where billions went.
[02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:40.070]  Yeah, they do.
[02:13:40.130 --> 02:13:41.270]  It went to Goldman Sachs.
[02:13:41.330 --> 02:13:42.070]  It went to J.P.
[02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:42.370]  Morgan.
[02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:43.050]  It's on record.
[02:13:43.630 --> 02:13:47.731]  So, in closing, there it is, Gerald, and he's not gotten in trouble.
[02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:51.332]  So, if he doesn't get in trouble, it sets the precedent they can do anything.
[02:13:51.874 --> 02:13:52.995]  They have done anything.
[02:13:53.015 --> 02:13:57.278]  You haven't seen one head roll on Wall Street with this whole financial crisis.
[02:13:57.538 --> 02:13:59.559]  What a joke, the Justice Department.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.120]  You know it's just us.
[02:14:01.821 --> 02:14:03.422]  Us, the little people, not them.
[02:14:03.442 --> 02:14:06.184]  And the CFTC, you pointed it out.
[02:14:06.684 --> 02:14:08.786]  Who's the head of the CFTC?
[02:14:09.466 --> 02:14:10.647]  Gary Gensler.
[02:14:10.987 --> 02:14:12.408]  Who's Gary Gensler?
[02:14:12.849 --> 02:14:20.454]  Gary Gensler was John Corzine's lieutenant when John the Don Corzine was the head of Goldman Sachs.
[02:14:20.894 --> 02:14:23.255]  I mean, only an imbecile can't put this together.
[02:14:24.896 --> 02:14:25.176]  Wow.
[02:14:26.677 --> 02:14:28.098]  Gerald, we don't have time.
[02:14:28.118 --> 02:14:29.858]  You've got to go in about a minute to go through.
[02:14:31.431 --> 02:14:38.476]  The other six or seven trends, but just in 60 seconds, what's one of the other really important ones that we're going to cover later in the week when you join us?
[02:14:39.076 --> 02:14:40.797]  Oh, climax time.
[02:14:41.398 --> 02:14:45.500]  Everybody's going to wake up this year and there's going to be two things that are going on.
[02:14:45.981 --> 02:14:50.704]  Number one, there is no recovery, there never was a recovery, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:14:51.064 --> 02:14:57.408]  Number two, they're going to start getting the message that the first great war of the 21st century has begun.
[02:14:59.750 --> 02:15:07.799]  So we're going to start seeing all these geopolitical and financial problems that have been building up come to a conclusion.
[02:15:08.721 --> 02:15:09.902]  So strap yourself in.
[02:15:10.322 --> 02:15:13.586]  We'll talk to your crew and find out a good day for you to come on.
[02:15:14.147 --> 02:15:18.192]  We'll pencil in some day this week, Gerald, to come on and go through the rest of it and take calls.
[02:15:18.812 --> 02:15:19.312]  I'd love to.
[02:15:19.352 --> 02:15:20.032]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:20.613]  Thank you.
[02:15:20.653 --> 02:15:22.833]  There goes Gerald Cilente, my friends.
[02:15:23.433 --> 02:15:25.314]  And yes, strap yourselves in.
[02:15:25.594 --> 02:15:26.274]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[02:15:26.294 --> 02:15:28.495]  We've had callers holding since I got Gerald on.
[02:15:29.055 --> 02:15:34.537]  And so we're going to go to Tom and then others that are patiently holding here in just a moment.
[02:15:34.557 --> 02:15:37.298]  And then I'm getting into the latest I ran.
[02:15:37.318 --> 02:15:41.579]  And it's a big stack, probably 15 articles I'm going to scan over.
[02:15:42.479 --> 02:15:45.941]  We've got incredible tyranny in China that our criminal government won't criticize.
[02:15:46.342 --> 02:15:47.462]  We've got TSA.
[02:15:47.963 --> 02:15:50.104]  Screeners aren't just for airports anymore.
[02:15:50.564 --> 02:15:53.326]  Shopping malls, highways, everywhere.
[02:15:53.446 --> 02:15:53.967]  They're coming.
[02:15:54.107 --> 02:15:55.487]  They're coming for your wife and children.
[02:15:55.748 --> 02:15:57.789]  They know if they can grab the genitals, they can do anything.
[02:15:58.249 --> 02:15:59.710]  It's an act of total domination.
[02:16:00.110 --> 02:16:02.532]  Like a big dog hiking on its leg and urinating on a little dog.
[02:16:03.112 --> 02:16:04.293]  This is pure pimp time.
[02:16:04.613 --> 02:16:06.775]  They're gonna break you and let you know you're their slave.
[02:16:07.415 --> 02:16:08.336]  You're their crack whore now.
[02:16:09.276 --> 02:16:10.737]  The government is here to dominate.
[02:16:10.957 --> 02:16:11.877]  This is called slavery.
[02:16:12.298 --> 02:16:17.300]  And the main reason I've been told by insiders for TSA is to get you ready for forced inoculations.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.841]  It's about the hands go on.
[02:16:18.881 --> 02:16:20.782]  We've confirmed with documents they've trained the preachers.
[02:16:21.122 --> 02:16:24.043]  When the time comes to say it's of the Lord, take the shot, turn your guns in.
[02:16:24.524 --> 02:16:32.027]  They're not training preachers, tens of thousands, well it's hundreds of thousands now, nationwide and putting them on secret FEMA payroll because they want to play tiddlywinks.
[02:16:32.608 --> 02:16:36.610]  This is super creepy, super premeditated, super evil.
[02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:40.972]  And if you don't get super angry and super involved, they're going to get away with it.
[02:16:41.513 --> 02:16:44.955]  This is the total takedown of America from the inside by the megabanks.
[02:16:45.355 --> 02:16:46.396]  Total criminal grips.
[02:16:47.837 --> 02:16:49.558]  I mean, heaven help us.
[02:16:49.598 --> 02:16:52.560]  This next year is going to be bonker land.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:54.962]  Let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[02:16:55.002 --> 02:16:55.542]  You're on the air.
[02:16:55.642 --> 02:16:56.423]  Thanks for holding, Tom.
[02:16:58.259 --> 02:17:19.055]  Hey, last Monday a friend of mine called me and he was working, he's from Pennsylvania as well, but he was working up in Rochester, New York and one of the other contractors he was working with told him that over that weekend he was together with his father over some kind of family get-together and his father is a prison guard at one of the local prisons there
[02:17:20.334 --> 02:17:46.814]  And his father told him that they had gotten a memo and then were asked for a sit-down meeting and they suggested that all the prison guards apply for work at the FEMA camp because they were anticipating within the next six to eight months that the prisons would have to close due to funding.
[02:17:48.456 --> 02:17:54.121]  And then they also suggested that they store two months' worth of food in the water.
[02:17:55.022 --> 02:17:56.143]  Yeah, well, you know what's funny?
[02:17:56.183 --> 02:18:01.468]  I've actually seen blurbs where they do tell federal and state employees and private groups to dig in.
[02:18:01.488 --> 02:18:07.454]  I know police departments for about five years have been digging in for war with the American people, not to fight guys with turbines on.
[02:18:07.694 --> 02:18:09.976]  That's a total, total smokescreen.
[02:18:10.016 --> 02:18:10.677]  Always has been.
[02:18:10.697 --> 02:18:11.677]  The memos prove that.
[02:18:12.678 --> 02:18:15.680]  But I'd like you to get your friend on the show or to send us that memo.
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.883]  In fact, if anybody's got memos like that, send them to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:18:19.903 --> 02:18:26.867]  If you don't hear it on the show a day later, send it five times until we get it, because it's such a limited crew and funding to have folks digging through it all.
[02:18:26.887 --> 02:18:28.628]  But we do get a lot of hot tips, obviously.
[02:18:28.908 --> 02:18:29.949]  Break a lot of news that way.
[02:18:29.989 --> 02:18:33.911]  But specifically, though, that's how they always work.
[02:18:33.931 --> 02:18:37.393]  They build prisons for nonviolence, but also violence.
[02:18:37.834 --> 02:18:40.756]  Then when things implode, they pack the prisons with political dissidents.
[02:18:41.756 --> 02:18:44.177]  And a lot of police departments have said, buy guns!
[02:18:44.197 --> 02:18:46.237]  We're not going to be able to protect you.
[02:18:46.897 --> 02:18:48.538]  We've been ordered to just revenue generate.
[02:18:49.378 --> 02:18:51.579]  And it's just a total criminal government.
[02:18:51.719 --> 02:18:55.520]  I mean, I can keep saying that over and over again, but words don't describe it.
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:59.021]  Was the person you were talking to concerned about this?
[02:18:59.041 --> 02:19:05.622]  Yeah, well the person I was talking to, he's been listening and he turned me on to you.
[02:19:08.311 --> 02:19:11.313]  But he was just surprised that somebody else just came up to him out of the blue.
[02:19:11.353 --> 02:19:14.314]  I don't think he's ever had any kind of discussion like this with him before.
[02:19:14.374 --> 02:19:18.797]  Well, by the way, they are running around hiring state, federal, and private prison guards.
[02:19:18.817 --> 02:19:20.358]  Well, private for state and federal.
[02:19:20.678 --> 02:19:23.419]  That's who they put in the 36 camps in Iraq.
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:31.704]  And they would actually go find guys who have been kicked out for rape or abuse and hire them for Abu Ghraib, where they rape children in front of their parents.
[02:19:32.304 --> 02:19:33.964]  I mean, remember, that's what America signed on to.
[02:19:34.044 --> 02:19:37.165]  I mean, this is... You think Jack Bauer's cool because he tortures the bad guy?
[02:19:37.405 --> 02:19:40.926]  That's fantasy, folks, to get you to accept torture as cool.
[02:19:41.966 --> 02:19:43.487]  So, get us that document.
[02:19:43.507 --> 02:19:44.767]  I want that document, Tom.
[02:19:44.807 --> 02:19:46.647]  Good job calling in with that information.
[02:19:47.228 --> 02:19:47.728]  Anything else?
[02:19:49.468 --> 02:19:57.710]  Well, one thing I was thinking it'd be a good idea if you had some kind of suggesting reading list, because a lot of times I've heard you refer to books that you've read or... We need to do that.
[02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:58.630]  That's a great point.
[02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:00.631]  More calls straight ahead than the big news.
[02:20:00.651 --> 02:20:01.031]  Stay with us.
[02:20:04.568 --> 02:20:09.291]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:20:09.751 --> 02:20:11.472]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:20:11.612 --> 02:20:14.814]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:20:15.155 --> 02:20:22.319]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:20:22.619 --> 02:20:26.842]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:20:27.122 --> 02:20:32.866]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:20:33.186 --> 02:20:34.767]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:20:34.987 --> 02:20:39.470]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com.
[02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:40.991]  Or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:20:41.091 --> 02:20:45.293]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[02:20:45.514 --> 02:20:47.455]  So get one for you and one for a loved one.
[02:20:47.595 --> 02:20:50.316]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:20:50.617 --> 02:20:52.178]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:20:54.239 --> 02:20:56.080]  Or go to faketv.com.
[02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:57.681]  Faketv.com.
[02:20:58.021 --> 02:20:59.282]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:21:01.013 --> 02:21:02.995]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.

[02:21:06.878 --> 02:21:08.659]  Introducing MDS Forte.
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:12.663]  A concentrated super straight extract formulated for those who are looking for relief.
[02:21:12.863 --> 02:21:14.624]  What can MDS Forte do for you?

[02:21:38.286 --> 02:21:39.907]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:21:40.107 --> 02:21:42.288]  With MDS Forte, there are none.
[02:21:42.588 --> 02:21:45.349]  Order a 25-day treatment of MDS Forte by calling 213-405-5355.
[02:21:45.369 --> 02:21:45.449]  213-405-5355.

[02:21:46.829 --> 02:21:49.731]  That's BestBloodSupport.com for MDS Forte, a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:22:00.715 --> 02:22:04.736]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:22:05.156 --> 02:22:06.356]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:22:06.656 --> 02:22:15.098]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:22:15.538 --> 02:22:18.739]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:22:18.979 --> 02:22:19.819]  But take heart.
[02:22:20.039 --> 02:22:23.560]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:28.801]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:22:29.221 --> 02:22:32.723]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:23:00.482 --> 02:23:07.785]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan, and making its way across the entire U.S.
[02:23:07.825 --> 02:23:10.587]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[02:23:10.827 --> 02:23:13.608]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[02:23:13.849 --> 02:23:20.572]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S., unless you do something to protect yourself.
[02:23:20.832 --> 02:23:21.132]  How?
[02:23:21.392 --> 02:23:23.854]  With liquid zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[02:23:29.397 --> 02:23:34.021]  It safely removes toxins and heavy metals, boosts energy levels, and promotes a strong immune system.
[02:23:34.241 --> 02:23:37.823]  Liquid Zeolite is so powerful, it was used to clean up contamination in Chernobyl.
[02:23:37.963 --> 02:23:40.045]  Yet so gentle, you won't even know you're taking it.
[02:23:40.265 --> 02:23:45.768]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but is only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[02:24:08.678 --> 02:24:17.664]  It's time for me to fire the Batman spotlight into the sky and ask Paul Watson to look into this.
[02:24:18.364 --> 02:24:20.666]  Obama has not signed the NDAA.
[02:24:22.027 --> 02:24:31.353]  I think this political thing is a typo because it's talking about a Defense Authorization Act but it's a separate one and some supplemental to an older one.
[02:24:31.373 --> 02:24:34.415]  There's so much defense spending and it's got language about
[02:24:35.751 --> 02:24:42.335]  Detainees and same subsections and no wonder people were confused by this.
[02:24:42.415 --> 02:24:43.376]  I tell you, this is getting crazy.
[02:24:43.856 --> 02:24:46.678]  I'm going to dig into this because if he hasn't signed it, what's going on?
[02:24:48.859 --> 02:24:50.480]  I'm going to have to look into this a lot closer.
[02:24:51.461 --> 02:24:52.141]  Very bizarre.
[02:24:52.861 --> 02:25:01.527]  Let's continue with your calls and then I'm going to play Wesley Clark on C-SPAN, former head general at NATO, former U.S.
[02:25:01.547 --> 02:25:01.807]  general.
[02:25:03.334 --> 02:25:07.075]  Admitting it was a plan to attack seven countries and they're following that plan now.
[02:25:08.075 --> 02:25:10.316]  And Iran is next up as well as Syria.
[02:25:11.216 --> 02:25:13.017]  Let's talk to Bill in Connecticut.
[02:25:13.057 --> 02:25:13.897]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[02:25:15.558 --> 02:25:16.298]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:25:17.298 --> 02:25:18.779]  Hi.
[02:25:19.139 --> 02:25:23.840]  Yeah, briefly you were talking about why Obama didn't sign the bill yet.
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:29.842]  And it could be, I remember listening to a Lindsey Williams YouTube saying that
[02:25:32.099 --> 02:25:36.543]  The globalists aren't very happy with Obama because he's been resisting them.
[02:25:37.744 --> 02:25:44.250]  But he has to play along to a certain degree in order to keep his job, if you will, and other things.
[02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:47.473]  So that may be playing into this whole thing.
[02:25:49.034 --> 02:25:49.855]  Well, I know this.
[02:25:49.875 --> 02:25:51.896]  I mean, he certainly said a lot of things.
[02:25:53.089 --> 02:25:57.452]  Like end war, stop torture, whenever he was running that he went back on.
[02:25:57.472 --> 02:26:00.254]  But his advisors are top New World Order.
[02:26:00.314 --> 02:26:04.416]  And I'm not saying Lindsey's wrong, but I know who his big oil company source is.
[02:26:04.837 --> 02:26:07.318]  You know, there are splits within the power structure itself.
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:10.580]  Okay.
[02:26:11.361 --> 02:26:15.243]  Um, uh, I'm just, I put that out there because that was the last thing I heard on the radio.
[02:26:15.303 --> 02:26:15.563]  No, no.
[02:26:15.664 --> 02:26:16.724]  I think that might be it.
[02:26:16.844 --> 02:26:19.606]  I mean, I mean, who knows why hasn't he signed it yet?
[02:26:19.986 --> 02:26:20.286]  Sorry.
[02:26:20.427 --> 02:26:20.807]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:26:21.556 --> 02:26:23.037]  Yeah, well that's what I'm thinking.
[02:26:23.237 --> 02:26:28.520]  Just going back, there may be some problems with Obama not playing along with these guys.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:41.968]  But the main point was, you know, I often hear you say that resistance is victory, and to a degree I agree with that, but I think that's only one step in a procession of other steps.
[02:26:42.028 --> 02:26:42.909]  Yeah, if we resist...
[02:26:43.769 --> 02:26:45.090]  The right thing in the right way.
[02:26:45.111 --> 02:26:47.853]  I'm just trying to get folks moving out of their trance.
[02:26:48.354 --> 02:26:52.358]  And once you get on the field, you'll you'll get a better understanding, but.
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:56.542]  Well, I was listening to you at Bruce Fine on it.
[02:26:57.983 --> 02:27:02.708]  He was thinking along the same lines that I was thinking of it that we need to.
[02:27:04.144 --> 02:27:06.985]  You know, subpoena these people and prosecute them.
[02:27:08.206 --> 02:27:18.550]  And he was even talking about impeaching the congressmen that are not holding their oath to the Constitution, which is virtually all of them at this point.
[02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:24.573]  And so what I was thinking, if you could get Ron Paul or Rand Paul to form a subcommittee
[02:27:25.553 --> 02:27:26.294]  Oh, you're right.
[02:27:42.534 --> 02:27:42.874]  You're right.
[02:27:42.934 --> 02:27:45.696]  Imagine a House Committee on Un-American Activities.
[02:27:45.736 --> 02:27:53.622]  You could haul in all the globalists who openly have quotes in written books saying, get rid of sovereignty, get rid of our industry.
[02:27:53.662 --> 02:27:55.544]  Maury Strong, all of them.
[02:27:56.798 --> 02:27:59.420]  You can haul in there George Soros, all of them.
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:00.720]  Here's the issue.
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:03.342]  Our power is starting to approach that level.
[02:28:03.782 --> 02:28:09.385]  We first got to wake people up to realize Obama and people are puppets and look at the banksters themselves.
[02:28:10.285 --> 02:28:12.026]  And we're in that process now.
[02:28:12.066 --> 02:28:14.588]  That's why they're trying to finish their endgame and launch their wars.
[02:28:15.902 --> 02:28:19.344]  Clamp down because they know we're close to getting our country back.
[02:28:19.884 --> 02:28:21.485]  That's why they've gone into this mode.
[02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:22.085]  But you're right.
[02:28:22.465 --> 02:28:23.946]  Talking about how they're criminals.
[02:28:24.366 --> 02:28:25.787]  Talking about how they're gangsters.
[02:28:26.307 --> 02:28:30.770]  Pulling down this aura of the wise men in suits that care about us.
[02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:32.431]  No, these are organized crime scum.
[02:28:33.721 --> 02:28:36.042]  And where are the grand juries, federal and state?
[02:28:36.642 --> 02:28:37.702]  Where are the people?
[02:28:38.122 --> 02:28:42.043]  I mean, here's Corzine committing crimes publicly, so I hammer it every day.
[02:28:42.763 --> 02:28:44.724]  Highest level of the administration advisor.
[02:28:45.124 --> 02:28:51.946]  Here is the Attorney General caught shipping drugs in, shipping guns out.
[02:28:52.266 --> 02:28:53.366]  In federal court, caught!
[02:28:53.866 --> 02:29:02.291]  Even in the New York Times now, eight agencies under him, all involved, of course, shepherding the $500 billion in drugs a year, that's then laundered by big banks.
[02:29:02.331 --> 02:29:18.000]  We have the entire chain, every angle, the money, the drugs, the weapons to secure them, all there, guns into Honduras, guns into Nicaragua, guns into Illinois, Indiana, Florida, Texas, using it to then shut down the Second Amendment, false flag.
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:20.962]  We have them, but we've got to get the word out.
[02:29:21.563 --> 02:29:24.220]  And if that, I mean if everybody went to city council on TV.
[02:29:25.327 --> 02:29:26.227]  And just talked about it.
[02:29:26.287 --> 02:29:28.568]  Where's our city putting out a resolution against this?
[02:29:28.948 --> 02:29:30.949]  Where's our... It's all about the buzz.
[02:29:31.689 --> 02:29:33.150]  It's a committee of correspondents.
[02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:35.051]  We've, like, 15 years before 1776.
[02:29:35.211 --> 02:29:42.233]  We've got to educate people that the bad men run the country.
[02:29:43.114 --> 02:29:45.575]  And you can't just remove a politician, put a new one in.
[02:29:45.835 --> 02:29:46.655]  Those are puppets.
[02:29:47.275 --> 02:29:50.317]  You've got to discredit the whole system to get America back.
[02:29:50.577 --> 02:29:51.477]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.977 --> 02:29:53.478]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.478 --> 02:29:57.259]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:27.874 --> 02:30:35.479]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[02:32:00.575 --> 02:32:04.798]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.118 --> 02:32:05.719]  Number one.
[02:32:06.039 --> 02:32:09.181]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.462 --> 02:32:10.022]  Number two.
[02:32:10.322 --> 02:32:14.866]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.206 --> 02:32:15.646]  It's true.
[02:32:15.946 --> 02:32:20.510]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:21.370]  Number three.
[02:32:21.651 --> 02:32:24.933]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.233 --> 02:32:28.936]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.136 --> 02:32:29.677]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.937 --> 02:32:32.299]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.699 --> 02:32:36.082]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.382 --> 02:32:36.583]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.163 --> 02:32:41.086]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.307 --> 02:32:46.071]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.351 --> 02:32:50.396]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.536 --> 02:32:52.098]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.318 --> 02:32:54.401]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:54.561 --> 02:32:56.924]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:11.394 --> 02:33:24.126]  Tyranny, if I had to give it a layman's simple definition, is government by criminals or criminals against the general population.
[02:33:25.608 --> 02:33:26.429]  And that's what we face.
[02:33:26.729 --> 02:33:29.412]  And it's happened over and over and over again in history.
[02:33:29.432 --> 02:33:31.514]  You know, I had a trailer
[02:33:33.382 --> 02:33:43.573]  A year or two ago for Fall of the Republic and in the trailer I talk about hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century.
[02:33:44.534 --> 02:33:53.202]  In that video trailer I saw one of the talking points was like, look at him, he says hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century.
[02:33:53.463 --> 02:33:55.184]  There's not even hundreds.
[02:33:57.441 --> 02:33:59.862]  Yeah, there's about 185 countries.
[02:34:00.662 --> 02:34:13.404]  Subdivisions within them, there's a total of about 300 or more major ethnic enclaves or sub-sub-states on top of the 185 or so nations.
[02:34:15.005 --> 02:34:17.165]  Plus or minus a few, depending on how you slice it.
[02:34:22.126 --> 02:34:24.006]  And I should revise it.
[02:34:24.046 --> 02:34:26.147]  In a century, there's been thousands
[02:34:27.182 --> 02:34:33.247]  I mean some Latin American countries and African and Asian countries might have two, three, four governments in a year.
[02:34:35.128 --> 02:34:41.634]  Different forms of tyranny and they tend to fall deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper as the corrupt
[02:34:43.089 --> 02:34:44.470]  Just wear out society.
[02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:49.233]  See, an average person thinks, well, why would the system want to screw things up?
[02:34:49.253 --> 02:34:51.054]  You know, that messes up the economy.
[02:34:51.074 --> 02:34:52.015]  They'll make less money.
[02:34:52.055 --> 02:34:52.796]  You don't understand.
[02:34:53.516 --> 02:34:57.719]  They'd rather burn the house down, so they're the only one with a house.
[02:34:57.759 --> 02:35:01.121]  They'd rather burn down every house in the neighborhood, so they're the only one in the house.
[02:35:01.181 --> 02:35:02.662]  Because it's about their control.
[02:35:02.742 --> 02:35:03.663]  It's about their power.
[02:35:04.103 --> 02:35:05.584]  It's about their will to power.
[02:35:06.305 --> 02:35:09.067]  It's the psychology of the corrupt.
[02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:13.513]  And good people who are stronger and smarter in every way than evil.
[02:35:15.055 --> 02:35:15.996]  Except in one area.
[02:35:16.036 --> 02:35:22.662]  We're blind because we think the world operates and basically works like we do.
[02:35:22.862 --> 02:35:23.943]  And that's not how it works.
[02:35:26.805 --> 02:35:32.831]  And I use the parallel, the analogy to serial killers.
[02:35:34.457 --> 02:35:39.439]  Every time you read about one of these cases, it's like, why would somebody want to grab little kids or women and do this?
[02:35:39.499 --> 02:35:42.020]  I mean, why would you want to torture somebody?
[02:35:42.181 --> 02:35:43.241]  It's just so horrible.
[02:35:43.281 --> 02:35:51.065]  It seems so anathema, so you'll tend to not even read that part of the newspaper or not read that book or watch that TV show.
[02:35:52.505 --> 02:35:56.387]  But then there's childlike people that kind of get off on it and are into it.
[02:35:57.588 --> 02:36:00.169]  And I can understand the fascination to understand evil.
[02:36:01.391 --> 02:36:05.472]  But still, there's some people who kind of get into it and fantasize that they're kind of part of it.
[02:36:07.532 --> 02:36:10.193]  And it's very, very sick.
[02:36:10.753 --> 02:36:17.034]  And if you look at our society, we're being trained that preemptive war, secret arrest, torture, torture people's kids.
[02:36:17.494 --> 02:36:27.876]  I remember a caller, probably like 98, 99, called and said, I was just at a 7-Eleven and bought, I think it was Weapons and Technology of Law Enforcement magazine.
[02:36:27.896 --> 02:36:28.576]  I'm going from memory.
[02:36:30.799 --> 02:36:31.680]  And you ought to see it.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:35.742]  It talks about torturing people's kids in front of them to stop an anthrax attack.
[02:36:36.622 --> 02:36:37.383]  And how it's good.
[02:36:38.143 --> 02:36:41.425]  So I literally ran out to 7-Eleven, went in, there it was.
[02:36:41.985 --> 02:36:43.306]  This person was calling from another city.
[02:36:43.726 --> 02:36:54.832]  And sure enough, opened it up, and it was law enforcement, former military trainer, counter-terrorism about, well, they're going to release anthrax bombs, and it's going to kill thousands if you don't.
[02:36:55.192 --> 02:36:56.573]  You got the person's kid.
[02:36:57.253 --> 02:36:58.054]  Do you torture them?
[02:37:01.067 --> 02:37:03.268]  And then I saw several other articles like that over the years.
[02:37:03.308 --> 02:37:05.388]  I'm probably giving you a composite from memory, that's all.
[02:37:06.129 --> 02:37:11.890]  The point is, is I saw another, was it Weapons and Tactics of Law Enforcement?
[02:37:11.930 --> 02:37:22.094]  Because there was another one, Law Enforcement Technology, was another one that I'm remembering had the thing about, if you see somebody with a Get Out of the UN sticker on the back of their car,
[02:37:23.430 --> 02:37:29.553]  Why, go ahead and take them to jail, and chiefs don't get mad at them, because they're probably just already an extremist.
[02:37:30.373 --> 02:37:36.476]  And again, that sounds crazy when you hear it, but it's about pushing the envelope, pushing the Overton window.
[02:37:38.177 --> 02:37:40.077]  Tabbing the TSA, stick their hands down your pants.
[02:37:40.698 --> 02:37:42.359]  It's supposed to be extreme.
[02:37:42.379 --> 02:37:46.060]  And I know if you're police out there and read those, you've read all that kind of stuff.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:46.821]  I know new listeners.
[02:37:47.341 --> 02:37:49.582]  In fact, I shouldn't even probably go from memory, because it's all foggy.
[02:37:50.563 --> 02:37:56.307]  And I tend to, when stuff gets foggy, splice and mix, and it's one magazine said it when the other didn't.
[02:37:58.148 --> 02:38:00.330]  By the way, I know there are people out there that collect all that stuff.
[02:38:00.390 --> 02:38:08.876]  I've lost more magazines than most people will ever have that they could send to me, but if you're out there and collect all those, highlight those, mail them to us, and I'll do a whole report.
[02:38:09.697 --> 02:38:11.378]  And not just those issues.
[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:16.162]  But all the issues that cover this and go over this.
[02:38:16.482 --> 02:38:18.244]  Okay, I said I'm going to get into more of the news now.
[02:38:18.264 --> 02:38:20.865]  I've already mentioned a lot of it, but let me get into quite a bit of it now.
[02:38:20.885 --> 02:38:23.287]  And if we have time, I'll get to the other callers that are holding.
[02:38:25.709 --> 02:38:32.513]  Before I get into this incredible Iran crisis and the corporate media globally
[02:38:33.581 --> 02:38:41.003]  The establishment mouthpieces slowly but surely trying to sell the public on the same lies that took us to war with Iraq.
[02:38:41.343 --> 02:38:43.684]  They've now shut that down and are ready to go to the next phase.
[02:38:46.305 --> 02:38:49.386]  I want to play a clip from a couple years ago on C-SPAN.
[02:38:50.126 --> 02:39:01.610]  This is the former head of NATO, former commanding general of NATO, Wesley Clark, on C-SPAN talking about being in
[02:39:03.496 --> 02:39:11.902]  A meeting with some folks who showed him some classified information concerning seven countries the West planned to strike, and this is a long time ago.
[02:39:12.462 --> 02:39:22.869]  Now the thing is, Clark doesn't know, because obviously he hasn't researched it, and the world's so full of information, I mean none of us can know everything obviously, that there was an Israeli plan in 1982
[02:39:25.103 --> 02:39:25.603]  to do this
[02:39:45.388 --> 02:40:08.969]  on corn and things like that and wheat that it was going to make these countries where half the public is on subsistence level two dollars a day or less more than half their food is spent on more than half their money spent on food so when you cut their food off it's going to cause problems and so they knew right at the time when to then take control of the revolutions and send in their al-qaeda and
[02:40:10.126 --> 02:40:13.187]  Libya, Egypt, and now Syria.
[02:40:13.327 --> 02:40:17.648]  And it's on record, they are Al-Qaeda, real Al-Qaeda, and they publicly work for the U.S.
[02:40:17.668 --> 02:40:18.008]  government.
[02:40:19.088 --> 02:40:22.349]  And it's in the news, they did.
[02:40:23.109 --> 02:40:33.292]  I was having Christmas dinner with my parents this weekend with the family, and my dad was like, man, he goes, it's all over the news, Alex, that Al-Qaeda's the main force that NATO uses.
[02:40:34.574 --> 02:40:36.255]  And it's all true what you said.
[02:40:36.315 --> 02:40:39.836]  He's just like, I can't believe the system thinks we're that dumb.
[02:40:39.876 --> 02:40:41.357]  And I'm like, Dad, they're in a trance.
[02:40:42.097 --> 02:40:45.579]  Good old boys just know men exist with beards and turbans.
[02:40:45.779 --> 02:40:51.321]  I will literally slit my wrist or cut my children's heads off because I'm a trendy, you know, good old boy.
[02:40:51.341 --> 02:40:56.083]  And, you know, just burn Bill of Rights, kill Arabs.
[02:40:56.943 --> 02:40:57.704]  You don't understand.
[02:40:58.044 --> 02:41:00.865]  The entire government attack plan is for you.
[02:41:01.994 --> 02:41:05.759]  The men in the turbans with the beards openly work for the bankers.
[02:41:06.901 --> 02:41:09.685]  Saudi Arabia was created by British intelligence.
[02:41:10.246 --> 02:41:15.494]  Al Qaeda was created by US, British, Israeli, and Pakistani intelligence on record.
[02:41:17.642 --> 02:41:20.344]  The leadership is global triple agents.
[02:41:20.744 --> 02:41:28.348]  They have underlings that they get out of dirt villages whose mama, you know, got blown up or whatever by a smart bomb, who are willing to go out and do stuff.
[02:41:28.868 --> 02:41:30.249]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[02:41:30.809 --> 02:41:33.231]  They've got real converts that'll go blow themselves up.
[02:41:33.611 --> 02:41:39.034]  The CIA doesn't have to brainwash you and put you on drugs for two years to make you a mind control assassin.
[02:41:40.134 --> 02:41:52.008]  They pick you up out of some Palestinian village, and you've seen your whole family killed over the years, and they take you and give you money and train you, and sure enough, they help you get on the airplane.
[02:41:52.028 --> 02:41:57.414]  A nice white guy from the CIA comes, because you're so stupid, and gets you on the airplane.
[02:42:00.649 --> 02:42:01.849]  I mean, this is how they work.
[02:42:01.889 --> 02:42:02.650]  It's real simple.
[02:42:02.890 --> 02:42:12.393]  The globalists want to take over the world, so they'll hire groups to attack, or groups to take the blame when the military itself attacks itself, as a pretext to make that place a battle zone.
[02:42:14.854 --> 02:42:15.855]  It's called a frame-up.
[02:42:16.035 --> 02:42:23.037]  It's so elementary, and it's the enemy's key tool they use against us to sell us on this total takeover of our society.
[02:42:23.437 --> 02:42:27.919]  Now, I've told you for almost 10 years, they were going to put TSA on the streets.
[02:42:29.141 --> 02:42:30.562]  They're going to be at the shopping malls everywhere.
[02:42:30.622 --> 02:42:31.322]  Why did I know that?
[02:42:31.402 --> 02:42:39.787]  Because I read law enforcement publications, I have sources, and I watch C-SPAN, and I'm going to tell you, you're not going to do anything without Homeland Security saying so.
[02:42:40.788 --> 02:42:44.910]  Your local police are all going to take orders from the TSA and Homeland Security.
[02:42:45.610 --> 02:42:45.931]  Everything.
[02:42:47.011 --> 02:42:50.153]  And they're going to set up checkpoints everywhere, and they're going to put their hands on you.
[02:42:50.393 --> 02:42:51.554]  This is about domination.
[02:42:53.029 --> 02:42:58.232]  And when people get mad and decide to fight back, you're going to be called terrorist on the news.
[02:42:58.872 --> 02:43:04.336]  And they're going to say, and they're already saying, criticizing it is incitement to violence, and then they're going to try to come arrest people.
[02:43:05.376 --> 02:43:07.037]  And you're like, but a shooting war will start.
[02:43:07.257 --> 02:43:08.158]  That's the plan.
[02:43:10.539 --> 02:43:16.943]  Just like they're blowing up stuff in Iran and pushing them and pushing them and cutting off their oil and cutting off their resources.
[02:43:18.018 --> 02:43:20.762]  The plan is to prod them into responding.
[02:43:20.782 --> 02:43:22.004]  And now that's even mainstream news.
[02:43:22.304 --> 02:43:23.646]  Lindsey Williams said it here a month ago.
[02:43:25.449 --> 02:43:26.330]  Let's get him back on.
[02:43:28.193 --> 02:43:30.316]  So all of this is happening.
[02:43:31.958 --> 02:43:32.740]  And it's a plan.
[02:43:33.874 --> 02:43:38.537]  And the people running America hate America, but they wrap everything they do in the flag.
[02:43:38.937 --> 02:43:40.458]  That has two big effects.
[02:43:40.518 --> 02:43:50.085]  The world then sees torture of kids, evil, toxic waste, GMO, drugs that have been tainted by design, blood full of HIV.
[02:43:51.343 --> 02:43:53.744]  All of it as the American flag.
[02:43:53.804 --> 02:43:57.586]  People worldwide see the American flag, it's like the Nazi flag or the Communist flag.
[02:43:57.626 --> 02:43:59.486]  I mean, they run in screaming fear.
[02:44:00.187 --> 02:44:10.511]  It's on the news, a lot of our troops have 666 on the tanks, human heads and skulls stuck on them, helicopters with 666 on them, heavy metal music blaring out.
[02:44:11.772 --> 02:44:15.453]  And, I mean, can you imagine all these third world people seeing this coming?
[02:44:16.153 --> 02:44:19.455]  And they've grown up malnourished their whole life and can't even really fight back.
[02:44:20.458 --> 02:44:22.539]  And if they do grab up a gun, they don't know how to shoot it right.
[02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:23.739]  And it's just a big joke.
[02:44:23.799 --> 02:44:25.020]  It's a big carnage, Bill.
[02:44:26.761 --> 02:44:31.302]  And all of those sins are now going to come back here and manifest tenfold.
[02:44:32.303 --> 02:44:32.803]  I mean, whoo!
[02:44:33.523 --> 02:44:41.046]  The 51 million aborted babies, all of it, just get ready, in spades, seven times over, God's going to give it all back to us.
[02:44:41.166 --> 02:44:43.207]  And I'm just telling you, repent now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:43.547 --> 02:44:46.448]  Repent now, because the New World Order hates you a lot more than they hate Iraqis.
[02:44:47.109 --> 02:44:48.529]  You think the globalists hate Iranians?
[02:44:48.889 --> 02:44:49.910]  They hate you a lot more.
[02:44:50.802 --> 02:44:53.411]  And it's the sickest joke that they've staged terror attacks.
[02:44:56.459 --> 02:45:05.181]  To get well-meaning good ol' boys to decry the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and then we get the manuals from good police that give them to us and good feds that give them to us.
[02:45:05.861 --> 02:45:09.042]  And the whole thing is about the American people.
[02:45:09.182 --> 02:45:12.322]  It is a domestic takeover right out of Red Dawn.
[02:45:12.462 --> 02:45:15.203]  It is a... And it's not just to loot us.
[02:45:15.343 --> 02:45:19.064]  They want to arrest, they want to torture, they want to run a red terror in this country.
[02:45:19.164 --> 02:45:21.044]  A total re-education purge.
[02:45:22.288 --> 02:45:28.514]  And military and police, if this does get triggered, I would guess they're going to die by the hundreds of thousands.
[02:45:29.014 --> 02:45:29.715]  Conservatively.
[02:45:30.536 --> 02:45:32.598]  The citizens are going to die by the millions.
[02:45:33.218 --> 02:45:34.620]  And I'm not kidding when I tell you that.
[02:45:35.942 --> 02:45:37.503]  Okay, this is not going to be pretty.
[02:45:37.964 --> 02:45:48.732]  This is going to be absolute war, guerrilla warfare in all directions, and the globals are going to sit back and watch it wreck America and come in five years later and reorganize everything and buy everything at the pace of the dollar.
[02:45:49.432 --> 02:45:53.195]  It's in the IMF World Bank plans to implode countries like this, to have civil unrest.
[02:45:53.475 --> 02:45:54.416]  We do not want it.
[02:45:54.496 --> 02:45:55.297]  We do not need it.
[02:45:55.557 --> 02:45:57.178]  We need the military and police to stand down.
[02:45:57.658 --> 02:46:00.681]  And we need the public to stop shooting their mouths off about violence all day.
[02:46:02.059 --> 02:46:05.641]  The globalists are sitting in Europe and on private islands and on giant yachts.
[02:46:07.622 --> 02:46:10.884]  They brag they've got yachts so they can stay offshore for a year if they need to.
[02:46:11.725 --> 02:46:17.048]  Okay, you know, you're not going to hurt the New World Order killing a cop or some military people.
[02:46:17.864 --> 02:46:20.166]  You know, you want to shoot your mouth off about killing people?
[02:46:20.347 --> 02:46:21.508]  How about you go talk to them?
[02:46:21.908 --> 02:46:23.009]  How about you go educate them?
[02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:25.232]  And that means slapping them upside the head with your voice.
[02:46:25.472 --> 02:46:26.133]  They're laughing at you.
[02:46:26.173 --> 02:46:27.594]  Say, listen, I warned you!
[02:46:27.614 --> 02:46:30.037]  It doesn't mean be polite to them if they laugh at you.
[02:46:30.417 --> 02:46:31.738]  But a lot of them aren't going to laugh at you.
[02:46:32.299 --> 02:46:37.925]  You've got a responsibility long before we talk about violence to try to talk to these people now.
[02:46:40.233 --> 02:46:41.314]  We got to turn this around.
[02:46:41.534 --> 02:46:42.695]  Now let's go to Wesley Clark.
[02:46:42.735 --> 02:46:49.322]  Here he is on C-SPAN talking about a decade before all this happened, the plan for these countries they were going to take down.
[02:46:49.942 --> 02:46:54.967]  But the trigger, as PNAC says, would be a giant terror attack on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[02:46:55.207 --> 02:46:55.888]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000.
[02:46:55.928 --> 02:46:56.108]  9-11 did.
[02:46:56.148 --> 02:46:56.829]  There's a phony $3 bill.
[02:46:56.849 --> 02:46:58.290]  Here it is.
[02:47:01.326 --> 02:47:06.910]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:08.551]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[02:47:08.611 --> 02:47:09.992]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[02:47:10.532 --> 02:47:18.257]  He said, he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, he said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs from the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[02:47:18.297 --> 02:47:30.706]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[02:47:32.671 --> 02:47:34.692]  And the full clip's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:47:34.712 --> 02:47:35.772]  He talks about it for like an hour.
[02:47:36.732 --> 02:47:39.073]  Okay, now let me show you what's going on here.
[02:47:39.673 --> 02:47:41.354]  This is just in the last two days, okay?
[02:47:43.094 --> 02:47:47.356]  Here's CNN, from Wolf Blitzer, wrote this.
[02:47:47.516 --> 02:47:48.676]  Iraq could break apart.
[02:47:49.316 --> 02:47:55.898]  I told you in 2001, in 2002, and when they launched the war in three, they always planned to break it in three parts.
[02:47:56.659 --> 02:48:00.600]  They always planned the west, the pullout, it's all staged.
[02:48:01.687 --> 02:48:02.048]  All of it.
[02:48:02.228 --> 02:48:04.029]  The President of Iraq works for the globalists.
[02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:09.955]  This ruse that America got forced out is all complete and absolute bull.
[02:48:10.796 --> 02:48:17.803]  There are more than a dozen giant, quote, embassies that are giant armored compounds with mercenaries in them.
[02:48:18.083 --> 02:48:19.885]  The entire government and military is trained.
[02:48:19.905 --> 02:48:21.647]  They're going to try to break it in three parts.
[02:48:22.047 --> 02:48:23.209]  The south of the Shiite
[02:48:24.363 --> 02:48:32.910]  The middle part for the Ba'athist and others, you know, the old Ba'athist relics and Sunnis and the rest of it, and the north for the Kurds.
[02:48:33.270 --> 02:48:33.811]  That's the plan.
[02:48:33.851 --> 02:48:34.711]  It's always been the plan.
[02:48:35.092 --> 02:48:38.755]  And now they're just now acting like this plan just got developed.
[02:48:39.075 --> 02:48:42.398]  Kind of like TSA screeners aren't just for airports anymore.
[02:48:43.198 --> 02:48:43.499]  L.A.
[02:48:43.539 --> 02:48:46.221]  Times, they're coming to the malls and they're going to grab your genitals.
[02:48:48.985 --> 02:48:51.425]  But they know how to sheep-train you first, dog-train you.
[02:48:51.445 --> 02:48:54.686]  You know, first, just go to the checkpoint, check the car for bombs.
[02:48:54.766 --> 02:48:55.586]  Oh, we care about you.
[02:48:55.926 --> 02:48:57.786]  Next, we're going to check your vehicle inside.
[02:48:57.826 --> 02:48:59.747]  Next, we're going to check your papers, and now we're going to touch you.
[02:49:01.387 --> 02:49:04.288]  Because you might be a terrorist, because you're guilty until proven innocent.
[02:49:04.508 --> 02:49:10.149]  Meanwhile, you're looking at government representatives who may not be bad men and women, but they do work for the people that are staging the terror.
[02:49:10.549 --> 02:49:11.509]  These are the terrorists.
[02:49:12.049 --> 02:49:14.209]  You know, they say the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.789]  It's true!
[02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:18.230]  The globalists attacked us because they hate our freedom, and now they've taken it.
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:20.140]  Here's another one.
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:22.582]  Iran begins naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:49:22.602 --> 02:49:23.642]  This started two days ago.
[02:49:23.723 --> 02:49:28.225]  Tehran's largest display of military power will bring it into close proximity with U.S.
[02:49:28.265 --> 02:49:30.386]  warships and strategic oil route.
[02:49:32.007 --> 02:49:32.668]  And they did.
[02:49:32.688 --> 02:49:35.750]  Iran says it warns off foreign helicopters.
[02:49:35.770 --> 02:49:37.050]  The word is now it was a U.S.
[02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:39.692]  helicopter that came into their territorial waters.
[02:49:39.732 --> 02:49:42.934]  They, on the third time, threatened to blow it up.
[02:49:43.774 --> 02:49:44.535]  And so it pulled back.
[02:49:46.212 --> 02:49:51.874]  So Iran is starting to take the bait after having their military bases blown up and saboteurs and all the rest of it.
[02:49:52.574 --> 02:49:54.235]  Again, we're not saying Iran's good either.
[02:49:54.755 --> 02:49:58.416]  These governments, it's like one little system versus the big New World Order system.
[02:49:58.897 --> 02:50:01.117]  I just know the Iranians do not put sterilisers in their water.
[02:50:02.018 --> 02:50:07.880]  You can say whatever you want about the Persians all day long, they do not, they haven't killed 51 million babies.
[02:50:09.722 --> 02:50:10.322]  I don't know.
[02:50:28.735 --> 02:50:29.115]  Rule?
[02:50:30.096 --> 02:50:31.757]  And now they've had some other judges rule.
[02:50:32.478 --> 02:50:34.639]  Maybe they can rule that the Easter Bunny is real.
[02:50:35.300 --> 02:50:36.741]  And so I'll tell you about that when we come back.
[02:50:36.761 --> 02:50:38.362]  I mean, they said Iraq did that.
[02:50:38.742 --> 02:50:44.726]  They said every other country over there did it, but Saudi Arabia, who was actually involved with the globalists, in it.
[02:50:44.746 --> 02:50:46.748]  15 of the 19 are from there.
[02:50:47.028 --> 02:50:50.150]  We've talked to the embassy heads who said they were ordered to let the hijackers in the U.S.
[02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:51.031]  and told they were U.S.
[02:50:51.071 --> 02:50:51.711]  government agents.
[02:50:51.731 --> 02:50:53.413]  I mean, this is on record!
[02:50:54.602 --> 02:50:55.623]  This is on record?
[02:50:55.643 --> 02:50:57.824]  Oh, but not Saudi Arabia.
[02:50:57.864 --> 02:50:58.744]  No, Iran.
[02:50:58.784 --> 02:50:59.445]  You're behind it.
[02:50:59.505 --> 02:51:00.345]  Yes, yes.
[02:51:01.406 --> 02:51:07.129]  When the food collapse happens, if trucks stop delivering food to supermarket shelves tomorrow, what will you do?
[02:51:07.629 --> 02:51:10.210]  How well is your family prepared for a food crisis?
[02:51:10.651 --> 02:51:12.031]  How long will you survive?
[02:51:12.692 --> 02:51:20.576]  Getting a biodome which produces food for you and your family year-round, even in the dead of winter, is easy, cheap, and extremely liberating.
[02:51:20.856 --> 02:51:24.721]  Find out how in an all-new webinar at domerevolution.com.
[02:51:25.222 --> 02:51:35.254]  Biodome expert Kasper Postavsky shows you the three actions you must start taking right now to start preparing your family for food shortages and survive the economic collapse.
[02:51:35.455 --> 02:51:38.659]  How to quickly and easily build your own geodesic biodome.

[02:52:08.899 --> 02:52:09.419]  We're good to go.
[02:52:31.454 --> 02:52:33.736]  It is you that defines the reward level.

[02:54:11.648 --> 02:54:14.289]  This is the final segment of the official radio transmission.
[02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:18.091]  I'll do five minutes overdrive to talk to Emily, Carolyn, and Mike.
[02:54:18.111 --> 02:54:21.673]  That'll be PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com, audio stream only.
[02:54:22.693 --> 02:54:27.355]  Then I'll be back tonight doing InfoWars Nightly News, very important transmission coming up this evening.
[02:54:29.076 --> 02:54:30.297]  Look, we can turn this around.
[02:54:32.432 --> 02:54:34.474]  We can turn around so many things that are happening.
[02:54:35.014 --> 02:54:39.298]  Ten years ago, if you talked about bisphenol A sterilizing people and giving them cancer, you'd get laughed at.
[02:54:39.338 --> 02:54:40.639]  Now the government's been forced to admit it.
[02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:48.006]  Ten years ago, you told people GMO is basically designed to attack the human body, you'd get laughed at.
[02:54:48.086 --> 02:54:52.470]  Now, there's a big report out of the International Journal of Bioethical Sciences.
[02:54:54.372 --> 02:54:58.133]  Analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian health.
[02:54:58.193 --> 02:54:58.813]  That's mammals.
[02:54:59.433 --> 02:55:04.714]  Researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto's GMO corn is linked to organ damage in rats.
[02:55:04.774 --> 02:55:06.775]  Gee, they knew that 20 years ago, depending on the type.
[02:55:08.095 --> 02:55:09.435]  And, wow, it's weird.
[02:55:09.955 --> 02:55:18.177]  The three main varieties of GM corn, MON-863, MON-810, and NK-603.
[02:55:18.577 --> 02:55:19.558]  It's just so funny.
[02:55:19.598 --> 02:55:20.958]  They're all real bad for you.
[02:55:21.823 --> 02:55:26.346]  Well, Jeepers Creepers, if bugs won't eat it, or if they do, they die.
[02:55:26.366 --> 02:55:27.287]  You think it's good for you?
[02:55:27.827 --> 02:55:30.609]  It grows a, quote, natural pesticide.
[02:55:31.029 --> 02:55:33.731]  You know, I love people that are into drugs, because I'm not.
[02:55:33.751 --> 02:55:36.994]  I guess I do drink coffee and stuff, but the point is illegal drugs.
[02:55:37.014 --> 02:55:38.655]  They'll say, but it's natural.
[02:55:38.675 --> 02:55:41.177]  You know, this drug is natural.
[02:55:42.998 --> 02:55:43.338]  Really?
[02:55:43.358 --> 02:55:44.639]  Cyanide.
[02:55:44.659 --> 02:55:46.821]  There are plants out there that got cyanide in it that are natural.
[02:55:47.241 --> 02:55:48.922]  Silver nightshade's got poison in it.
[02:55:48.942 --> 02:55:49.883]  It'll kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:55:50.783 --> 02:55:51.324]  It's natural.
[02:55:53.348 --> 02:56:00.951]  So their argument is, well, we trigger the plant to grow at 1,000 times or higher, this poisonous fungus inside of it that naturally grows on it.
[02:56:01.291 --> 02:56:04.953]  Yeah, at 1,000th or less.
[02:56:09.214 --> 02:56:10.175]  It just goes on and on.
[02:56:10.215 --> 02:56:12.816]  I mean, the honeybees eat this stuff and they fall over deader than a hammer.
[02:56:13.236 --> 02:56:18.518]  I mean, look, look, I'm just here saying, oh, hey, this bisphenol A, they knew when they adopted it in the 50s.
[02:56:18.938 --> 02:56:19.698]  Here's the documents.
[02:56:19.738 --> 02:56:21.019]  They did it to sterilize people.
[02:56:22.267 --> 02:56:24.928]  You might be concerned, oh shut up you nut, they wouldn't do that.
[02:56:24.948 --> 02:56:27.609]  Oh yeah, they have been and it's on record.
[02:56:27.629 --> 02:56:28.690]  And you know what, they're not stopping.
[02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:34.913]  You know when it comes out that this stuff's in baby formula?
[02:56:36.932 --> 02:56:42.153]  Melamine and misphenol A. Every other government removes it, but our government comes out and says, we say it's good for you.
[02:56:42.593 --> 02:56:46.074]  Kind of like radiation levels go up, they just say, we'll raise the level of what we say is safe.
[02:56:46.574 --> 02:56:47.915]  This is an insanity.
[02:56:48.455 --> 02:56:51.396]  To buy into this system is an insanity.
[02:56:51.416 --> 02:56:52.716]  And I see all these yuppies.
[02:56:53.716 --> 02:56:56.417]  Because I went to see a movie this weekend, it was sold out, so we went to the mall.
[02:56:57.917 --> 02:56:58.498]  Walked around.
[02:56:59.838 --> 02:57:00.158]  And uh...
[02:57:02.878 --> 02:57:13.183]  Yeah, I watch the sharp, in-shape yuppies and the people with their families and they're real into playing the corporate game, not sticking their heads up, saying yes, yes, yes to get some chicken feed money.
[02:57:13.783 --> 02:57:17.765]  Listen, listen, you're not winning going along with this.
[02:57:18.145 --> 02:57:21.146]  I don't care if you got a big house and a bunch of crud you got to take care of, okay?
[02:57:22.707 --> 02:57:28.450]  You know, that's something I've really been liberated in, and I was always somewhat of a centered person and a decent person.
[02:57:29.341 --> 02:57:32.384]  But I still thought it'd be really cool to know movie stars and stuff.
[02:57:32.424 --> 02:57:35.307]  I mean, I was like, ooh, movie stars, they live on Mars or something.
[02:57:36.187 --> 02:57:40.431]  And then I never even reached out to movie stars, and I was reached out to and still am, even more so than ever.
[02:57:40.912 --> 02:57:44.155]  And then it's kind of like, okay, I've met some of the most famous people in the world.
[02:57:47.998 --> 02:57:48.619]  It means nothing.
[02:57:49.761 --> 02:57:54.107]  So everybody thinks bigger house, big car, movie stars, be famous.
[02:57:54.387 --> 02:57:56.010]  They think that that's unattainium.
[02:57:56.270 --> 02:57:58.753]  That's something they, oh my gosh, it's like living on another world.
[02:57:59.154 --> 02:58:01.657]  I'm here to tell you, none of that will fulfill you.
[02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:03.961]  Helping an old lady across the street.
[02:58:06.130 --> 02:58:09.872]  Or, uh, somebody comes in to rob you and taking them out, that's gonna satisfy you.
[02:58:10.392 --> 02:58:13.073]  Uh, planting a garden in your backyard, that's gonna satisfy you.
[02:58:13.093 --> 02:58:20.496]  Uh, being a good, decent person and teaching others skills and helping build humanity, that is gonna fulfill you.
[02:58:20.837 --> 02:58:23.638]  And I'm telling you, they are moving towards war with Iran big time.
[02:58:26.164 --> 02:58:28.226]  I mean, it's got top generals in the U.S.
[02:58:28.266 --> 02:58:29.787]  and Israel saying they're getting ready to hit them.
[02:58:29.807 --> 02:58:32.749]  They're certainly trying to scare Iran into some type of provocative move.
[02:58:33.449 --> 02:58:36.551]  And the war is already going on inside Iran, like Gerald Salente said.
[02:58:37.792 --> 02:58:39.233]  This thing is just starting to escalate.
[02:58:43.256 --> 02:58:44.657]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:53.151 --> 02:58:56.794]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:57.114 --> 02:59:05.241]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.981 --> 02:59:10.024]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.625 --> 02:59:21.434]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:22.054 --> 02:59:31.077]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.577 --> 02:59:36.619]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:36.999 --> 02:59:44.182]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:44.482 --> 02:59:47.243]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:59:52.082 --> 02:59:55.003]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.663 --> 02:59:58.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.324 --> 03:00:06.165]  Alright, I'm gonna be back tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:00:06.185 --> 03:00:09.126]  A lot of news I got to, a lot of it I didn't.
[03:00:09.146 --> 03:00:13.407]  We'll be covering the news I didn't get to and more tonight, 7 o'clock central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:13.727 --> 03:00:15.907]  Let's jam in three calls right now that have been holding the longest.
[03:00:16.247 --> 03:00:17.308]  Emily, Carolyn, and Mike.
[03:00:17.688 --> 03:00:19.028]  Emily in California, you're on the air.
[03:00:20.854 --> 03:00:21.194]  Alex!
[03:00:21.594 --> 03:00:24.636]  Wow, my gosh, it is... Oh my God, it's amazing to speak with you, sir.
[03:00:24.696 --> 03:00:27.397]  I'm such a... I have so much respect for you.
[03:00:27.617 --> 03:00:28.757]  Well, I respect you as well.
[03:00:28.777 --> 03:00:29.457]  Thank you for calling.
[03:00:30.818 --> 03:00:31.398]  Quick question.
[03:00:31.438 --> 03:00:36.380]  This may seem like the dumbest thing in the world, but there's a documentary out there called September Clues.
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:37.741]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[03:00:37.761 --> 03:00:40.242]  Have you heard of it?
[03:00:40.402 --> 03:00:41.742]  Vaguely, it rings a bell.
[03:00:42.303 --> 03:00:47.945]  It's about... It's about no aircraft hitting the towers, period, right?
[03:00:48.746 --> 03:00:49.466]  Correct, yeah.
[03:00:50.147 --> 03:00:57.631]  And then there's another one where they talk about how the scientific way that there's actually like the pod, and then they put the planes over it.
[03:00:57.651 --> 03:00:59.673]  I don't know, you know, it was pretty convincing.
[03:00:59.953 --> 03:01:02.955]  I don't think it's ever bad to question.
[03:01:03.555 --> 03:01:16.143]  I can tell you that some of the people pushing that theory, I don't know about that, I have to go back to memory, but that film aside, the progenitors of the no-plane theory, one of them came out in a big documentary
[03:01:17.083 --> 03:01:21.869]  That have been filmed in 2000 by this big visionary technologist.
[03:01:22.450 --> 03:01:35.627]  I never gave it attention at the time because the person has subsided off into the background and it turned out that it was a big CIA drill and that it was a CIA social experiment they did in New York and the one of the main characters in it
[03:01:36.778 --> 03:01:38.220]  It's a documentary, it's non-fiction.
[03:01:38.540 --> 03:01:40.322]  He is the person that created all that.
[03:01:40.963 --> 03:01:48.450]  And so, you're not bad, you're asking my opinion, I don't like getting into the infighting, because they want to create division in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[03:01:49.289 --> 03:02:00.655]  Is that they put all that out and say it's all completely fake stuff on TV, and then I say, really, I talked to good friends I've known for years that saw the second plane, and they say, no, you're CIA, shut up.
[03:02:00.735 --> 03:02:15.343]  And then, later, one of the researchers runs in and says, have you seen this big documentary about the social networking documentary about the guy that envisioned where the internet was going, this top scientist, you know, computer technologist, and then it all turned out to be true, and then there at the center of it,
[03:02:18.205 --> 03:02:21.427]  Is the individual admitting ties to the CIA 12 years ago.
[03:02:22.108 --> 03:02:24.910]  So totally staged, totally to get us fighting with each other.
[03:02:25.251 --> 03:02:25.491]  Emily.
[03:02:26.512 --> 03:02:26.972]  Good to know.
[03:02:27.112 --> 03:02:27.693]  Thank you sir.
[03:02:27.933 --> 03:02:28.373]  Thank you.
[03:02:28.634 --> 03:02:28.994]  Thank you.
[03:02:29.054 --> 03:02:29.434]  You bet.
[03:02:29.655 --> 03:02:31.476]  And again, I don't want to get off into a whole fight about that.
[03:02:35.029 --> 03:02:35.990]  People can have their views.
[03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:37.651]  I'm not saying everybody that believes that's bad.
[03:02:37.671 --> 03:02:41.393]  It's just that's what the media always uses about, you don't believe there are any airplanes.
[03:02:41.433 --> 03:02:43.774]  And I'm like, yep, that's your go-to, isn't it?
[03:02:44.295 --> 03:02:46.496]  Go ahead and poison the pot with disinfo.
[03:02:47.377 --> 03:02:48.697]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[03:02:48.757 --> 03:02:49.418]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:02:51.007 --> 03:02:58.148]  Yeah, Alex, just to kind of bring home the pounding of the drum about the federalization of all local law enforcement.
[03:02:58.808 --> 03:03:04.149]  Just several weeks ago I went to, I live in a small community west of Fort Worth, still have a town square, etc.
[03:03:04.789 --> 03:03:11.090]  And went to a program to listen to my son and his students do some Christmas carols and so on and so forth.
[03:03:11.871 --> 03:03:19.232]  And probably about 40 law enforcement people in a small town square, I look out the window and there is this mammoth
[03:03:20.272 --> 03:03:26.017]  Um, law enforcement vehicle painted beautifully red and white with gold leaf that says, Incident Command Center.
[03:03:27.078 --> 03:03:31.102]  And of course, that caught my eye and went out there and finally got the attention of an officer.
[03:03:31.122 --> 03:03:39.069]  Of course, it startled everybody that was with me, that's been listening to me talk about what's going on, and was so excited about all the cool things that it had.
[03:03:39.109 --> 03:03:44.814]  And I said, well, I see on the back of there, in paint, funded by Department of Homeland Security.
[03:03:46.058 --> 03:03:51.423]  And it really brought it home for the people that I was with, especially when I was speaking to the officer.
[03:03:51.763 --> 03:03:53.124]  And he said, it's got everything.
[03:03:53.164 --> 03:03:54.045]  He was so excited.
[03:03:54.065 --> 03:03:55.366]  And I said, well, what do you do with it?
[03:03:56.267 --> 03:03:58.268]  He said, we basically go wherever we're needed.
[03:03:58.809 --> 03:04:00.830]  I said, well, who tells you where to go?
[03:04:00.850 --> 03:04:03.513]  I said, does the Fed tell you where to go?
[03:04:03.533 --> 03:04:04.573]  He said, yeah, but don't worry about it.
[03:04:04.593 --> 03:04:06.975]  It's funded by the local county and the local authorities.
[03:04:07.096 --> 03:04:08.537]  I said, yeah, but that's what I pay for.
[03:04:09.791 --> 03:04:15.292]  Yeah, usually about 70% of it is from the locals, and the Threat Fusion Center is fed run.
[03:04:16.012 --> 03:04:17.693]  And they'll lie to you and tell you it isn't.
[03:04:17.793 --> 03:04:18.153]  It is.
[03:04:19.353 --> 03:04:21.714]  And believe me, they're training to spy on you, everything.
[03:04:21.774 --> 03:04:22.494]  It's so horrible.
[03:04:22.874 --> 03:04:26.075]  Those poor moron local cops have no idea what they're going to be asked to do.
[03:04:27.195 --> 03:04:27.635]  Absolutely.
[03:04:27.655 --> 03:04:29.395]  He said, we just go where we're told.
[03:04:29.535 --> 03:04:32.696]  And it just floored the five or six people that were with me.
[03:04:33.196 --> 03:04:36.557]  And they got goosebumps when I said, I'm telling you, they're federalizing everything.
[03:04:38.166 --> 03:04:39.787]  Did the police officer listen to you?
[03:04:42.067 --> 03:04:47.449]  No, I was talking, I had friends and family with me while I was speaking to them and when I said, does the Fed tell you where to go?
[03:04:47.950 --> 03:04:49.670]  That's when he cut the conversation off.
[03:04:50.230 --> 03:04:51.751]  Oh yeah, he's been trained you're a terrorist.
[03:04:52.111 --> 03:04:54.712]  If you can string a sentence together, they've been told you're a terrorist.
[03:04:55.112 --> 03:05:00.154]  You're just supposed to drink fluoride and give all your money to the banks and help destroy America, or you're a traitor.
[03:05:02.335 --> 03:05:05.556]  Did you know that gold and silver contain healing properties?
